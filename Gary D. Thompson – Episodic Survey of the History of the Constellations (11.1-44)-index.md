1: Ice-age star maps?
A Great Bull painted image (#18 (fourth bull), main hall, right wall) in the "Hall of Bulls" in the Lascaux cave in France. Of the nearly 2000 images there are 915 images of animals and the other images comprising various geometric symbols. At Lascaux, specially carved stone bowl lamps (holding burning lumps of animal fat) were used to light the cave. It is clear that wooden ladders and/or scaffolding was also used to reach high walls and ceilings. Traces of these have recently been discovered. A flickering flame in the cave may have conjured impressions of motion. As example: High on the Nave's right wall, an early artist had used charcoal to draw a row of 5 deer heads. The images are almost identical, but each is positioned at a slightly different angle. Viewed one at a time with a small circle of light moving right to left, the images seem to illustrate a single deer raising and lowering its head as in a short flipbook animation. When Lascaux cave was discovered in 1940, more than 100 small stone lamps that once burned grease from rendered animal fat were found throughout its chambers. Unfortunately, no one recorded where the lamps had been placed in the cave. At the time, archeologists did not consider how the brightness and the location of lights altered how the paintings would have been viewed.

Lascaux is probably the most famous cave in Western Europe. It goes without saying that the single most striking characteristic of the Lascaux cave is its lavish decoration.
The Lascaux cave in southwest France, near the town of Monrignac, was discovered by children in 1940. Lascaux is a natural limestone cave. Upper Palaeolithic cave art was first discovered in 1856 in the cave of Niaux in France. The first real claim for the existence of Palaeolithic cave art was that made in 1880 for the Spanish cave of Altamira by a local landowner (an amateur natural historian who was fond of archaeology), Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola, who first discovered the cave in 1879. His views were treated with scepticism. Palaeolithic cave art remained largely ignored, even suspected by some as a hoax because of its sophistication, until the first decade of the 20th-century. The discovery of the Altimara cave in northern Spain in 1879 initiated 15 years of controversy before the acceptance of the cave paintings as Paleolithic art.
Some of the most splendid Paleolithic cave art locations are Lascaux (discovered in 1940), Altamira (discovered in 1879 and only fully explored in the 1950s), Chauvet (near Marseilles) (discovered in 1994), and the (now) underwater cave Cosquer (also near Marseilles) (discovered in 1991). The Chauvet cave holds the earliest paintings - dated to circa 30,000 BCE. The purpose of the Palaeolithic cave paintings in Europe is not known with any certainty. According to Jean Clottes "Paleolithic Cave Art in France." (Adorant Magazine, 2002): "Wall images are perfectly compatible with the perceptions people could have during their visions, whether one considers their themes, their techniques and their details. The animals, individualised by means of precise details, seem to float on the walls ; they are disconnected from reality, without any ground line, often without respect of the laws of gravity, in the absence of any framework or surroundings. Elementary geometric signs are always present and recall those seen in the various stages of trance."
The earliest expert research attempting a systematic study of the artwork in Palaeolithic caves in southwest Europe was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s by Annette Laming-Emperaire (1917–1977; a French archeologist) and André LeroiGourhan (1911–1986; a French archaeologist, paleontologist), working independently of each other. In a series of publications between 1957 and 1965, Annette Laming-Emperaire and Andre Leroi-Gourhan revolutionized the study of Palaeolithic art. André Leroi-Gourhan studied and statistically analysed over 2000 representations in 65 caves. Another important publication was Palaeolithic Cave Art (1967) by Peter Ucko and Andsrée Rosenfeld (both British prehistorians). The authors critically reviewed the theories and speculative assertions, of experts and amateurs - up to that date - concerning the meaning Palaeolithic cave art. The more recent research of Michel Lorbblanchet (French prehistorian) has demonstrated the importance of giving adequate attention to the forces of corrosion and concretion when recording artwork images in Palaeolithic caves. To recover deteriorated artwork Michel Lorbblanchet used different lighting and photographic enlargements. (See: Secrets of the Ice Age by Evan Hadingham (1979).)
The paintings in the cave at Lascaux remain the most well-known Palaeolithic cave paintings. Many are beautiful but some are simple and primitive. The great artistic tradition of the Palaeolithic period ended with the last Ice Age circa 10,000 BCE.
The Lascaux cave contains some 600 paintings and 1500 engravings dating from the Palaeolithic Period. The very few symbols are limited to isolated or grouped dots (mostly black) and to variously coloured dashes. The animals depicted onthe cave wall are horses, bulls, and deer. (But deer do not dominate the art work.) Horse, bison, and wild cattle dominate the cave walls. Most figures in the Lascaux cave pictures are horses. Horse and bison are the most common animals painted. The "Hall of Bulls" mural is dated circa 15,000 BCE. (The radiocarbon dating of charcoal recovered from the cave floor indicates occupancy circa 15,000 BCE to 14,000 BCE.) Lascaux's Hall of Bulls is approximately 18.5 metres long, 7 metres wide, and 6.5 metres high. The largest painted bulls are approximately 6 metres long. Several researchers have offered an astronomical interpretation of Great Bull #18. (The bulls are actually aurochs, a large species of wild cattle. Wild auroch bulls were over 2 metres high at the shoulder and weighed over 2 tons (approximately 2000 kilograms).
There are 2 sets of painted dots closely associated with this bull. One set of dots is placed above the shoulder of the bull and the other set of V-shaped dots are located on the bull's face. Also, there is a row of 4 painted dots to the left of this bull. (A number of types of elementary geometric signs/shapes and patterns appear on the cave walls, scattered between the animal figures. It has been remarked that these non-figurative signs such as dots, rectangles, and lines often appear to be of equal importance.)
Posted at the Portal to the Heritage of Astronomy in collaboration with the IAU (International Astronomical Union) (http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?idunescowhc=85) under the heading: The Astronomical Rock Panels in the Lascaux Cave, France: "Brief inventory: A number of the Lascaux pictures have a possible astronomical significance. These include the 'Chinese horse' and 'fronting ibex' in the Axial Gallery and the 'crossed bison' in the Chamber of Felines (natural calendars); the stag-and-horse motif and related dots in the Axial Gallery and the five 'swimming stags' in the Nave (astronomical almanacs); the aurochs (no. 18) in the Hall of the Bulls with its clusters of dots (representations of asterisms); and two pictograph panels in the Shaft (cosmography). ... Archaeological / historical / heritage research: There exist numerous authoritative archaeological, historical and heritage studies concerning the cave and its artwork. Many of the astronomical interpretations, by contrast, have been unscientific and highly speculative, arguably undermining more serious research in this area."
It is believed by some persons that attempts to demonstrate the astronomical knowledge of Paleolithic people has been successful. At least initially, the claim largely centred on rather simple arguments for the constellation Taurus and the Pleiades asterism being depicted in the Lascaux Cave. However, this is simply a case of wishful thinking. The "proofs"

offered are hardly convincing. The tenuous and unverifiable nature of the evidence offered has not limited the types of claims made. Several persons now claim to offer evidence of a complex Paleolithic astronomy including a complete zodiac and "cosmovision." However, the social and religious context from which the art emerged will never be known. They are part of an unknowable cultural world - unless hubris as an investigative method is introduced. The material conditions of the production of the art is more within our understanding. The conditions of reception is not.
Several people pursued independent inquiries, at roughly the same time, regarding the possibility of the Hyades and the Pleiades being depicted among the bulls at Lascaux. In their respective publications, however, the authors develop the argument beyond simply a single array of dots. In Lascaux, for example, the argument for Taurus is extended by the Vshaped arrangement of dots on the face of bull/auroch #18 including a large dot which helps form the eye, which is marked by the bright star Aldebaran in Taurus. The group of six "Pleiades" stars is held to be just above the shoulder of bull #18, in a position analogous to the Pleiades in Taurus. (In his 1999 book Eine Himmelskarte aus der Eiszeit? [A Skychart from the Ice Age?] Michael Rappenglück discusses the extensive world-wide literature written on the topic of the possibility of a Palaeolithic astronomy, extending from the end of the 19th-century up to mid 1999.) Rappenglück's book is considered the most comprehensive and the most disciplined on the subject.
The Spanish researcher Luz Antequera Congregado in her doctoral thesis Arte y astronomia: evolución de los dibujos de las constelaciones (1991 (though frequently given as 1992)) first set out the astronomical interpretation that the dots above the shoulder of the bull depict the Pleiades open star cluster and the dots on the bull's face depict the Hyades open star cluster.In her later paper "Altamira: Astronomía y religión en el Paleolitico" (1994) she interpreted the row of (what are) 4 dots tothe left of Great Bull #18 as the stars of the belt of the constellation Orion. (Luz Antequera Congregado has also investigated Palaeolithic art in other European caves from an astronomical perspective. See her essay: "Practicas Astronomicas en la Prehistoria de la Peninsula Iberica y los Archichipielagos Balear y Canario" (1994).) This paper appeared in Arqueoastronomia Hispanica: Practicas Astronomicas en la Prehistoria de la Peninsula Iberica y los Archichipielagos Balear y Canario edited by Juan Antonio Belmonte Aviles. In this essay, which appeared prior to FrankEdge's article, Luz Antequera Congregado speculates on possible asterisms represented in the paintings in Altamira and Lascaux caves, including recognition of the Pleiades.
The American dentist and pseudo-nutritionist Weston Price (1870-1948) (at a date that I have not yet been able to identify) also made the identification of 10 painted dots on a Neanderthal cave painting with the Pleiades. (However, there is no indication of any firm methodology being used. His identification seems to be based on pattern recognition. The identification was linked to his assertions of the benefits of early human diets - keen eyesight being one of them.) Price did not mention where the cave painting is located. It has not been identified by any other investigator.
Some people believe that the #18 Lascaux auroch with the two associated sets of dots represents the constellation Taurus. This idea was firmly set out by the American college teacher Frank Edge in his 35-page booklet "Aurochs in the Sky"(1995) and later article "Taurus in Lascaux" (Griffith Observer, September, 1997). Ed Krupp, the editor of the Griffith Observer, restricted Edge's commentary to what were believed to be the most plausible assertions. (He began his studies inthis area in 1991. His ideas were first published in Atlantis Rising; a magazine that has been described as making the magazine Fate look respectable.) Frank Edge holds that at least one of the Great Bull images (#18) in the "Hall of Bulls" inthe Lascaux cave can be identified as celestial by the simple comparison of the associated dot markings with two particular star groupings as they were viewed on the horizon circa 15,000 BCE. Specifically that a group of 6 dots painted above the shoulder of auroch #18 represents the Pleiades open star cluster, and that another group of V-shaped dots painted on the auroch's face represents the Hyades open star cluster. (Edge states that he was particularly persuaded by the six dots above the shoulder of the bull, which he identified with the Pleiades.) It is Edge's position that the aurochs depicted in Figure 18 in the Great Lascaux Cave accurately depicts the constellation Taurus. It is Edge's belief that the image of the Taurus constellation has remained unchanged for 17,000 years. The ideas/identifications of Edge, who is not a professional astronomer as some persons mistakenly claim, arose from the casual application of pattern recognition.
The German scholar Michael Rappenglück, University of Munich, believes the art of the Lascaux cave not only involves the depiction of constellations but is also a cosmographic depiction by Palaeolithic shamans. His idea that the Pleiades were depicted in the Lascaux cave were first presented at an astronomy conference in 1996 and later published in his essay "The Pleiades in the "Salle des Taureaux" Grotte des Lascaux" (1997). (He has worked on the subject of "Paleoscience" since 1984.) His ideas that the Lascaux cave paintings depict shamanistic cosmography were first set out in his doctoral thesisEine Himmelskarte aus der Eiszeit? (1998; published and in need of revision). (Michael Rappenglück has also investigated Palaeolithic art in other European caves from an astronomical perspective i.e., the Cueva di El Castillo in Spain. The art in this cave is dated circa 12,000 BCE.)
Another earnest proponent of constellations being depicted in Palaeolithic cave art (especially at Lascaux) is Jesper Christensen. See: his article: "Heaven and Earth in Ice Age Art: Topography and Iconography at Lascaux." (Mankind Quarterly, Spring/Summer, 1996, Volume 36, Numbers 3-4, Pages 247-259). Christensen adopts the archaeoastronomy approach to the interpretation of Paleolithic cave art. Danish-born Jesper Christensen Ph.D. is an accomplished art historian with prehistoric art as a specialty. Ph.D. thesis, Svend Wiig Hansen (1922-1997) : the human figure in art after World War II (published 2002). He has been on the staff of the University of Louisville, teaching a graduate class in "Cave art and religion" (2003). His first article on cosmology in the Lascaux cave was printed in a Danish art journal, Kunst, in 1970. An article on astronomy in art was published in the Bulgarian journal, Orpheus, 2003/2004 ("Astronomy in Thracian Art."

Pages 55-69). (His biographical details are sometimes confused with those of the Danish actor of the same name.) More recently Jesper Christensen wrote (Hastro-L, 18-4-2015): "Hastro-L subscribers with an interest in prehistoric astronomy may find it worth their while to read the extensive discussion of palaeolithic astronomy that I have posted on my website, iceageiconology.net. Chapter XI of that site traces the ancestors of the present Taurus, Capricornus, and Leo via systematic analysis of the images of aurochs bulls, ibexes, and lions in some major, well-dated, caves, notably Chauvet (about 37,000 years old) and Lascaux (about 23,000 years old). Some minor caves that are contemporary with these giants are considered as well. Visual representations of the three species are analyzed with respect to color, orientation (within caves), size, and juxtaposition/superimposition. The findings are discussed relative to the effects of precession and to the seasonal themes of the individual caves. A part of Chapter XI (to be posted later, this summer) will pursue the stellar imagery in half a dozen, fairly well dated, caves of the magdalenian age (between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago)." He posted again to Hastro-L on 2nd June 2017 regarding and addendum to Chapter XI: "A chamber in the decorated cave of Tuc d'Audoubert is entirely given to a great number of moon-like signs arranged in long files, which on closer inspection have distinct features of an eight-year lunar/solar calendar. Some subscribers--even if less than enthused about Palaeolithic astronomy--may be interested in the evidence found in Tuc and other caves of the Pyrenees and in northern Spain, all dating to about 17,000 BP. Discussion and documentation is included as an addendum to the chapter on astronomy (chpt. XI) at my web-site: iceageiconology.net." The discussion is unavoidably focused on speculation/conjectures. His website is very extensive.
A somewhat recent proponent of an astronomical interpretation of the Lascaux cave paintings is the independent French researcher Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez who has a PhD in Humanities. (Like all persons who make any type of study of this nature she is termed an archeoastronomer/ethnoastronomer.) Her investigations first began in 1992 with the Chalcolithic period cave engravings in the Vallée des Merveilles. In 1998, in partnership with Jean-Michel Geneste (Curator of Lascaux cave), she began studying the caves and Paleolithic ornamented shelters in France. The particular research study was conducted in 1999-2000. From this she believes she has uncovered evidence to demonstrate that the Paleolithic painters were astronomers. (Over a wider period of 7 years, Jègues-Wolkiewiez visited 130 cave sites featuring Paleolithic drawings, identifying believed solar alignments throughout the seasons, and leading to her claim that 122 of the 130 sites had optimal orientations to the solstitial horizons.) At the 2000 international conference on cave art in Val Camonica, Italy she made the claim that the people who painted the Lascaux cave were astronomers and that they also painted a zodiac on the walls of the cave. She has proposed that the Lacaux cave paintings record the constellations of a prehistoric version of the zodiac which also included solstice points and major stars. I think that Frank Edge also claimed that Lascaux's Hall of Bulls pictured the stars of the ecliptic. ("Lascaux, View of the Magdalenian Sky." by Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez (Symposium of Cave Art, Val Camonica, Italy, 2000.) The study was based on a series of astronomical measurements. They used astronomical software to recreate the night sky at Lascaux 17,000 years ago, and models of the modern Western constellations. They made measurements of the astronomical alignments of the cave paintings and also compared the outlines of the paintings in the Hall of the Bulls with the night sky in Magdelenian times. (For a (French-language) summary of her work and conclusions see: "Lascaux planetarium prehistorique?" by Pedro Lima (Science & Vie, Number 999, December, 2000.) Her central claim is the Great Hall figures comprise a prehistoric zodiac. (See also Appendix 1 below.)
Interestingly, during the first decades of the 20th-century the French prehistorians Marcel Baudouin and Henri Breuil speculated about the possibility of constellations being represented in prehistoric art. (To a considerable extent Alexander Marshack and his ideas of Palaeolithic lunar calendars (developed during the 1970s) fostered renewed interest in the possibility of Palaeolithic constellations.) During the last decades of the 20th-century they were followed by the Swiss engineer Amandus Weiss, the astronomer Heino Eelsalu, and the German art historian Marie König who considered the possibility of constellation representation in the Lascaux cave art. Also, the eccentric German ethnologist Leo Frobenius in his book Kulturgeschichte Africas (1934) conjectured that the animals painted in the Magdalenian caves of Southern France and Northern Spain represented stars. Largely forgotten are the proponents of astral theories, Morris Spivack (Morris J. (Redman) Spivack) (1903-?) (Cosmic Dance at Lascaux: New Theory of Paleolithic Art and Religion, 13-page hand-typed manuscript filed in the Library of Congress, 1961, but also published in French and English), and Elaine Mills (The Prehistoric Puzzle and the Key to Paleolithic Art, unpublished Junior Honors Project in Anthropology, May 1972 - August 1973, Sweet Briar College). However, the main proponents remain Luz Antequera Congregado, Frank Edge, and Michael Rappenglück (and more recently Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez). All were involved in independent and lengthy research prior to their first publications.
Luz Antequera Congregado, Frank Edge, Michael Rappenglück, and Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez converge on some similar ideas. However, each of them utilises a different level of speculation. Luz Antequera Congregado largely bases her ideas on the application of the art-historical approach and does not employ archaeological or astronomical analysis. Frank Edge also utilises art-historical and psychological approaches as well as simple constellation projections onto particular paintings. Michael Rappenglück applies a wider interdisciplinary methodology. Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez uses multiple methods of astronomical analysis (including astronomical measurements and constellation projection).
Michael Rappenglück presented his first paper about the Pleiades in the Lascaux grotto "The Pleiades in the "Salle des Taureaux," Grotte de Lascaux. Does a Rock picture in the cave of Lascaux show the open Star Cluster of the Pleiades at the Magdalénien era (ca 15.300 BC)" at the SEAC conference in Salamanca. It was published in 1997 in Actas del IV Congreso de la Sociedad Europea por la Astronomia en la Cultura, "Astronomía en la cultura." edited by C. Jaschek and F. Atrio Barandela. Rappenglück is investigating Lascaux from the viewpoint of a possible cosmovision of Paleolithic man. He believes the best evidence for this cosmovision at Lacaux is to be found in the so-called "shaft of the dead man." Rappenglück believes the rock panels there show a complete scene of the sky - somewhat like a panorama - as seen at the



2022. 02. 21. 18:17 History of Constellation and Star Names

epoch 16,500 BCE. The second part of his book Eine Himmelskarte aus der Eiszeit? (his published PhD thesis) contains a long chapter about shamanistic cosmovisions combined with a totemistic worldview referring to the rock panel in the shaft of the Lascaux grotto. According to Rappenglück his analysis agrees with the recent published studies from Jean Clottes and Lewis Williamson about the topic, but he extends these in a broader field, including mythology and sciences of religions.
The German prehistorian (archaeologist) Marie Köenig (1899-1988) interpreted the horse in Paleolithic art as the symbol of the sun, and the bull as the symbol of the moon. According to Köenig the ascending young mares in the rotunda (hall of bulls) of the Lascaux cave show the morning sun, and the descending horses in the small cave area at the rear end of the axial gallery symbolize winter. (See: Köenig, Marie. (1970). "Etude des incisions repestres comme manifestation d'un stade d'evolution de esprit humaine." In: Anati, Emmanuel. (Editor). Symposium international d'art préhistorique: Valcamonica, 23-28 Septembre 1968, (Pages 515-530). (Further, Am Anfang der Kultur Die Zeichensprache der frühen Menschen by Marie Köenig (1973).) Also, New Perspectives of Prehistoric Art by Günter Berghaus (2004).)
The pre-historian and independent researcher Mary Settegast, who focuses on the Neolithic period, also adheres to the idea that constellations are depicted in the Lascaux cave. See her book, Plato prehistorian (1990). Settegast has a graduate degree in anthropology from Columbia University and a graduate degree in educational psychology from the University of California at Berkeley.
There are multiple depictions of bulls (aurochs) in the Lascaux Cave. What do all these other bulls (aurochs) have to do with the deemed astral bull (auroch)? Any answer can be nothing more than speculation.
The investigation of possible astronomy in Palaeolithic cave art has obviously been to search for sky maps in prehistoric imagery. Most investigators start with and stay with the method of comparing dot-by-dot mirroring between stars andimages. It it with this method that Frank Edge, Luz Antequera Congregado, Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez, and David Bossard, etc. claim to find constellation configurations in select parts of cave figures. The prime example is the claim for Taurus. Hover, their results still remain contradictory. The method of dot-by-dot mirroring for parts of cave figures is also questionable. More likely - as in the case of the ancient Greeks - the figure encompassing a grouping of stars is the visual representation of the constellation.
To date none of the arguments attempting to show the existence of some sort of Palaeolithic astronomy can be considered convincing. No research into prehistoric European cave art has led to the definitive identification of astronomical information of any kind. All of the various hypotheses put forward identifying astronomy in prehistoric European cave art ultimately lack objective scientific evidence to support them. The positions of the cave drawings plus the numerous signs that exist do not appear to readily correspond to any particular stars or constellations. It is possible to 'prove' almost anything by selectively choosing sets of dots or a particular drawing. There are simply many sets of dots existing within European caves containing prehistoric art. "... the dots are just one example of an element in Lascaux art, and in all cave art .... [There is a] ... profusion of nonrepresentational [i.e., abstract] patterns. In addition to dots, there are grids and chevrons, curves and zigzags, and more. Many kinds of patterns are to be found, sometimes superimposed on animal images, sometimes separate from them. The coincidence of these geometric motifs with representational images [of animals] is one of the most puzzling aspects of Upper Paleolithic Art. (Origin's Reconsidered (1992) by Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin)" Frank Swetz has conjectured (1994) "that such primitive patterns may have emerged as a visual analogue of sound patterns." It is more meaningful to look at the totality of drawings and signs within prehistoric caves and identify whether there are patterns which are repeated throughout different caves. There are numerous prehistoric European caves containing, overall, a large number of, and variety of, animal drawings and signs. In his recent book The Cave and the Cathedral (2009) Amir Aczel has emphasised: "It is important to adopt some form of statistical reasoning here; otherwise, anyone can claim almost anything. A systematic order must be evident in a majority of locations in order to have statistical and logical significance."
The problem of the enormous chronological gap and passage of knowledge quite accurately through some 600 generations and across cultures remains. Simply suggesting the continuity of (conjectured) constellation images from the Upper Paleolithic claims a remarkable conservation of imagery. Claims for unchanged constellation continuity from their origins in the Palaeolithic period to the Hellenistic period are nothing less than remarkable. More than likely they are untrue especially the claims for the existence of a Palaeolithic zodiac. Simply, there is a lack of convincing evidence. Also lacking is any knowledge of when images appeared. This was most likely over a period of time - not 'immediately.' What then, was the sequence of their appearance?
The closest constellation in time to the conjectured Bull constellation in the Lascaux cave is the Babylonian Bull constellation GUD.AN.NA/gu4.an.na (Heavenly Bull/Bull-of-Heaven/the bull of Anu). The Greek zodiacal Bull (Latin, Taurus) has been identified with the Babylonian GUD.AN.NA. As this is most likely, the Greek Bull constellation is not evidence of supposed transmission from the Palaeolithic period. The Babylonian Bull constellation shared only a few stars with the Greek Bull constellation. The Babylonian Bull constellation encompassed the descriptors "Bright star of Bull of Heaven" and "Jaw of the Bull" = alpha Tauri (Aldebaran) and the Hyades. The Pleiades asterism has been identified with the Babylonian MUL.MUL/mul.mul (the stars/the hair brush). The early Greek Bull constellation was comprised of 18 stars: alpha Tauri and also beta Tauri (Elnath), the open clusters the Pleiades and the Hyades. The Hyades comprised the face of the Bull. The Pleiades marked part of the hind section of the Bull. In Michael Rappenglück's match of painted bull #18 in the Lascaux Cave with stars in the modern constellation Taurus (Latin: Bull) he has the Hyades forming the upper head/forehead of the Bull, and the Pleiades positioned over the Bull's shoulder. In some modern depictions of the main stars

of Taurus matched with the animal's image the Hyades comprise the mid face area, the Pleiades are positioned on the shoulder, Aldebaran is an eye, and Elnath is at the tip of a horn.
In summary, some of the important problems with the various arguments which attempt to identify constellations amongst the Paleolithic cave paintings are: (1) The proposed constellation depictions are always separated from their contexts amongst the other painted figures surrounding them. The more numerous other figures forming the cave paintings are generally ignored. (2) Numerous depictions of aurochs are found in cave paintings with dots placed nearby. The claimed correspondences identified in the representations selected would appear to be more coincidental than intended. In the Lascaux cave, for example, there is another Auroch with 'Pleiades' type dots around one of its eyes. In Iberian caves ‘Pleiades' dots also appear. (3) Significantly, there is circa a 12000 year time gap between proposed Paleolithic constellations and the classical constellation figures of Western Europe. The assertion of constellation continuity is without any supporting evidence from similar depictions being identified from the Neolithic/Bronze Age. (4) It is simply assumed, rather than established, that determining and marking the equinoxes and solstices was significantly important in ordering the affairs of prehistoric communities. There is little evidence for such being important to the later Neolithic period or Bronze Age communities.
Problems also exist with non-astronomical explanations. Many researchers have believed that the animals painted by the Ice-age hunter-gatherers at Lascaux (the Magdalenian culture) were simply those that they hunted. Certainly the animals they depicted comprise the most dangerous in the world of the Ice-age hunters and were both prey and food. The painted dots are thought by some persons to be perhaps no more than a tally of hunting kills. However, the concepts of hunting magic and hunting tallies would seem to be wrong. The 'hunting magic' theory of the paintings, by the French archaeologist Salomon Reinach that was particularly promoted by the French pioneering prehistorian Henri Breuil, has been subject to increasing criticism since the early 1960s. This is primarily due to the discrepancy between the animals that were eaten and the animals that were depicted. The hunted animal remains on the cave floor were largely reindeer but reindeer are entirely unrepresented in the cave art. A single possible depiction of a reindeer is engraved in the mesh of lines in the Apse (vaulted recess).) However, there are scores of red deer images.
Some recent investigations suggest that beliefs involving connection to the spirit-world, through trance and hallucination, are perhaps the key to understanding the cave paintings (including the dot patterns). See especially the remarkable book The Mind in the Cave by David Lewis-Williams (2002). (David Lewis-Williams, born 1934, is Professor Emeritus of Cognitive Archaeology at the University of the Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg.) Perhaps the most currently prominent theory of Palaeolithic cave art presently belongs to Jean Clottes (a French paleontologist and cave art specialist) and David LewisWilliams with their shamanic ritual/trance theory of Palaeolithic art. An important article is "Paleolithic Cave Art in France." by Jean Clottes (Adorant Magazine, 2002). (See also: The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the Painted Caves by Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams (1998).) Their Palaeo-shaman/trance theory is presently the prominent model. However, it is not without problems and critics. Their ideas have their effective critics in Derek Hodgson (2000) and Paul Bahn (most recently 2010). (Derek Hodgson is with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto; Paul Bahn is a British archaeologist.) Clottes builds on Mircea Eliade's concept of shamanism. Eliade's claim that shamanism was an early universal religion remains an unsubstantiated claim. Harvey Graham (1995) criticized Eliade's concept of shamanism (and Eliade's inventiveness that went with it) as poorly defined and historically incoherent. (Harvey Graham is with the Arts Faculty, Open University, Walton Hall, UK.) The existence of 'Palaeo-shamanism' has not been demonstrated. It has even been described as a "pseudo-scientific myth." An informed, solid critique of Clotte/LewisWilliams and their theory is set out in Prehistoric Rock Art: Polemics and Progress by Paul Bahn (2010). Clottes is identified as being too conjectural-deductive in his approach. His ideas have been described as a "blind alley/dead end."
The only representation of a person is located in what is called "the Pit" or "the Shaft of the Dead Man" section of the cave. Painted on the yellowish mineral surface is what appears to be a bison, possibly injured from a hunt, attacking a stick figure representing a man, while a prehistoric rhinoceros is shown walking away nearby. Next to the man is a bird on a long stick. Of the over two thousand representations on the cave walls of Lascaux, this is the only one to clearly show a person.
The apparent avoidance of painting the human image is contradicted by 155 engraved human portraits found on the floor of a cave at La Marche in France. Professor R[ussell]. Dale Guthrie (Emeritus Professor in the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks; and author of The Nature of Paleolithic Art) proposed in 2006 that the art was largely produced by adolescent males and is somewhat akin to modern teen graffiti. (Guthrie points out that considerable female sexual imagery appears.) Guthrie analysed the dimensions of the hands in European cave art, and compared them to 1000 photocopies of modern hands of men and women of different ages. His conclusion was men and women and boys and girls of all ages left their marks but, statistically, teenage males dominated. (Most of the footprints in Palaeolithic caves in France and Spain appear to be those of children.) Guthrie determined that female artists accounted for less than 20 percent of the cave art. Guthrie has also suggested that Palaeolithic people quite likely painted the majority of their paintings in accessible public (open) places. Only the paintings placed in inaccessible (protected) locations are the ones to have survived.
The notion of the recognition/use in the Palaeolithic period of conspicuous asterisms to track the season is not particularly remarkable. It is well established that nomadic hunters and gatherers such as the Australian Aborigines observed the sky and kept track of the seasons in terms of the appearances of key stars/asterisms. The Pleiades, however, have little importance in the constellations depicted by the ancient Egyptians - and these depictions on the ceilings of tombs are the most ancient we have with certainty. However, as Rolf Sinclair advised in exploring possibilities of Palaeolithic astronomy: "We must be

careful lest we act out a Matthew Principle: "... seek and ye shall find .... he that seeketh findeth ...."" We are too distant in time and space, and too limited by the vagaries of archaeological discovery, to legitimately understand the thoughts of prehistoric people. Asserting what prehistoric people must have thought or meant is surely hubris.
Appendix 1: Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez
Chantal Jegues-Wolkiewiez insists there was a long cultural tradition of skywatching among the people of the Cro-Magnon Age of Europe (encompassing circa 30,000BCe to 10,000 BCE).
Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez is an independent French researcher who has studied at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (France). Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez has a Docteur ès Lettres et Sciences Humaines, anthropology. Her doctoral research involved a decade of work studying rock engravings in the Valle des Merveilles, in the southern French Alps. In this area there are an estimated 35,000 rock engravings carved between circa 2500 BCE and circa 1500 BCE. According to one source she defended her thesis on 25 March, 1997 at the UNSA Ethnology Laboratory (Laboratoire d'Ethnologie de l'UNSA). This is also the date given when she presented her thesis at a seminar at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azu. In part, in her thesis (under the supervision of J-Pierre Jardel and J-Michel Le Contel) Des gravures de la vallée des merveilles au ciel du Mont Bego (Dissertation, 1997, Laboratoire d'Ethnologie, UNSA), she attempted to compare the position of some engravings to the constellations of the bronze age sky and the visible paths of the Moon and of the Sun. She received her doctorate with special honours and the congratulations of the Jury. She also has a MA in psychology. After obtaining her PhD she then began to study the paintings in the Lascaux Cave. In 1999 and 2000 she conducted an intensive study at Lascaux.
Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez is a Paleolithic researcher who has now specialized in attempting to discover the time-keeping and astronomical capabilities of the people of Lascaux Cave in France. (Supporters tend to refer to her as a paleoastronomer. However, this is nothing more than an informal popular title devoid of academic status.) Chantal JèguesWolkiewiez has theorized that the Lascaux murals are a celestial map of the night sky, no less than a zodiac. She believes there was a long cultural tradition of sky watching in the Upper Palaeolithic period. She holds that many of the Lascaux paintings of animals align with celestial positions essentially revealing a highly sophisticated map of the constellations. She proposes most of the constellations are represented by paintings of animals and these accurately depict their coloring and coats during the corresponding seasons of the year. Chantal Jegues-Wolkiewiez uses complex anthropological methods involving astronomical measurement and constellation projection.
Her theory is typically based on the discovery of numerous dots and tracings superimposed on the paintings of bulls, aurochs and horses at the Lascaux cave. She claims these correspond to the patterns of constellations/asterisms, the most notable of which are Taurus and the Pleiades and the stars Aldebaran and Antares. Her theory is typically based on the discovery of numerous dots and tracings superimposed on the paintings of bulls, aurochs and horses at the Lascaux cave.
Her 1st book (2011) is, Sur les chemins étoilés de Lascaux. She has more recently published, L'ethnoastronomie, nouvelle appréhension de l'art préhistorique (2012). According to Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez there existed a relationship between the way in which cave art animals were depicted and the time of year when the Sun shone on specific animals in caves. Over a period of 7 years, Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez has visited 130 cave sites featuring Palaeolithic drawings, making identifications of their solar alignments throughout seasons. According to her work, 122 of the 130 sites had optimal orientations to the solstitial horizons. Jègues-Wolkiewiez claims that her work shows that prehistoric cave painting sites in the region of southwest Europe were mostly selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the winter solstice. She also claims to have determined through computer modeling that the sun's setting rays during the summer solstice illuminated the painting of the Red Bull on the back wall of the Hall of Bulls in Lascaux 17,000 years ago. In her books and publications Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez asserts her conclusions that sky lore is essential to the interpretation of Palaeolithic cave art in Europe. According to Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez, hunter gatherers spent long nights observing the sky, calculating, and recording their discoveries either on the walls of caves or on animal bones. Their analyses enabled them to measure time and adapt to seasonal change. Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez concludes that prehistoric men chose their caves according to the orientation of the sun, created measuring tools such as a lunar calendar, and their wall paintings were the first maps of the sky and stars.
Appendix 2: The Strange Case of David Bossard
A more recent advocate of Palaeolithic constellations at the Lascaux Cave is David Bossard ("Astronomy at Lascaux Cave", unpublished article placed on the web). Abstract: "Two aurochs paintings in the cave at Lascaux, France form a single sky chart from 15,300 BC. The paintings depict the fall of Orion below the horizon as viewed from Lascaux, an event visible nightly between late June and December, and which may have been used to mark the solstices -- the beginnings of Summer and Winter. Internal evidence indicates that these aurochs were painted between 13,200 BC and 17,000 BC, nicely bracketing the radiometric estimate of 15,300 BC. This is the earliest known sky chart and earliest "naming" of the constellation Taurus, which implies that the association with a bull was already set in deep pre-history. The skillful execution of the paintings as sky charts, to an accuracy of 30 arc minutes, is evidence of highly developed technological skill." About the author: "Interdisciplinary Biblical Research Institute, Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Bio: Dr. Bossard earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1967 after a B.Sc. (Drexel) and A.M. (Dartmouth) in Physics. His thesis in probability theory was published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society (1971). He also earned a M.Div.

from Biblical Theological Seminary in 1982. His primary work has been in scientific computer modeling and simulation, with emphasis on military applications. He has had a particular interest in ocean science, and this eventually led him to the H.M.S. Challenger Exploratory Expedition of 1872-1876, which was perhaps the most extensively documented deep ocean voyage of exploration. All of the reports of this Expedition are posted at the 19th Century Science website, which includes along with the Challenger reports, some contemporary accounts of this and similar voyages, in the HMS Challenger Library. From that work, he turned his attention to the development of the Geological Sciences in the 19th Century, and posted many of the prominent books from this era in the Golden Age of Geology Library. Dr. Bossard has had a lifelong interest in understanding the parts of the Bible that relate to science, and has used his scientific knowledge to explore that relationship. He believes that the Bible is inspired by God the Creator, and therefore it is accurate in the statements it makes of a scientific nature — understanding that the Bible was written for all people, not just for scientists, and that language by its very nature is metaphorical, so any scientific content can be expected to be explained in ways that could and can be understood in all ages by the typical intelligent person of the time, using the common language, figures of speech, analogy and other literary devices, to make the message relevant and clear (unless it is intentionally obscured), without misstatements of fact. Many silly statements pointing out supposed scientific errors in the Bible, result when modern notions of accuracy, grammar and scientific expression are erroneously projected onto the Biblical writings." (Source: http://www.christianscientific.org/memberpages/david-bossard/) This is simply fantasy and hubris.
"The Purpose of this website. This website is my personal reconstruction of the Creation Narrative: how God created the Universe and Life, based primarily on the findings of Science. This narrative is a direct gift from God, the "Silent Speech" in Psalm 19, a miraculous record of his handiwork in creation, woven into the fabric of the natural world. As science has advanced in recent decades, it has revealed astonishing and totally unexpected insights into the actual ways that God carried out his creative work. This insight -- this speech -- was woven into the creation from the very beginning of time, and has been lovingly nurtured by God as a special witness to his glory and handiwork, a record preserved for its unfolding in these modern times. Who would have had the arrogance to expect that such a witness is possible? Or that God would grant special favor to the modern times in this way? Indeed, as this witness has unfolded over the decades and centuries, it has always been met with initial doubt and disbelief until its truth becomes overwhelmingly evident. Because of the totally unexpected and astonishing depth of understanding that it yields, I see this witness as a firm indication of God's intense desire to share his glory with humanity in these rudderless days. The remarkable scientific discoveries of the past 50 years—especially in genetics and astrophysics—have revealed more "signs and wonders" about God's handiwork in creation than has any comparable time in history, except when Jesus walked the earth. It makes me wonder what God has in store for humanity, why this unfolding of natural revelation at this time?" (Source: http://19thpsalm.org/) This is simply more fantasy and hubris.
Extracts from customer review by David Bossard: "... The fact is, there is all sorts of evidence for intelligent design in creation, and in life itself. Budding biologists have to be carefully trained to ignore this evidence, or be shamed into ignoring it. In the early 1800s, before the juggernaut of Darwinism stoked up, many scientists, and in particular geological scientists, acknowledged the overwhelming evidence for intelligent design: read the large selection of 19th century science books available on the web and in print, including early geologists such as Hugh Miller, Baron Georges Cuvier and Sir Charles Lyell. Because Dr. Miller is clearly respectful of Biblical religion, I would consider him a sympathetic participant in the evolution/religion debate. I loved his observation that even the Bible says that humans were created out of pre-existing material (the dust of the earth). I happen to agree with the implications of his observation. The Biblical creation of Adam and Eve involved two components: the dust of the earth and the image of God. Many Creationists seem to miss this and assume that the genes determine the human: not so -- the genes only determine the physical body; the image determines the soul. ..." (http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MRIBWS7HYMR) This is simply even more fantasy and hubris.
David Bossard Ph. D. Mathematics Dartmouth College is one of over 800 members of the scientific community who challenge evolutionary theory and have signed A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism. The document's leading statement is: "We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged." (Source: https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120603165239AAoYVXG) As such, "David Charles Bossard Ph.D. Author and Lecturer. His Ph.D. is in Mathematics from Dartmouth College" is among those listed in the Creation Science Hall of Fame, "Honoring those who honored God's Word as literally written in Genesis." (http://creationsciencehalloffame.org/defenses/darwin-skeptics/)
Bossard refers to the planetarium program Cartes du Ciel for his precessional needs. However, he seems not to have assured himself that the program is reliable as far back as the last Ice Age. At least he supplies no details.
Bossard assumes the Lascaux cave paintings are an accurate map of stars comprising constellations. Based on this assumption he overlays such with the star maps obtained from Cartes du Ciel. The procedure is rather naive. It does not consider the random distortions from projecting onto the uneven surface of the cave wall. (It is worth noting that constellation/sky depictions from cultures that we know for certain preferred images instead of dots, etc. to represent stars i.e., New Kingdom Egypt and the Carolingian Aratea, these images cannot be accurately matched with planetarium software print-outs.) But if the conjectured Palaeolithic artists wanted to accurately map stars then why didn't they simply paint stars?
Bossard appears to misunderstand and misrepresent the effects of motion of the perihelion (perihelion precession). Also Bossard's assertion that previous studies produced wrong results because they did not take the motion of the perihelion into

account is wrong. It is with this issue that Bossard is introducing key errors.
Appendix 3: Issues With The Interpretation of Palaeolithic/Neolithic Art
The interpretation of astronomy in Palaeolithic/Neolithic art is based on what people believe they can recognise as being astronomical depictions (i.e., multiple-rayed disks and crescents). Simplistically, some people believe they can interpret a direct link between these types of graphic depictions in Palaeolithic/Neolithic and astronomical objects (i.e., the multiplerayed disk = the sun (solar disk), and the crescent = the moon (waxing/waning)). Note: Multiple-rayed disks or heads do not appear in the oldest Palaeolithic art. However, radiate figures do. Also, there is a so-called Palaeolithic "star" in Bernifal in the Les Eyzies region of Dordogne, France. All these types of depictions are relatively rare in Palaeolithic art. Whether representations of stars do or do not appear in Palaeolithic art, especially in the Lascaux Cave, is controversial. However, there is acceptance that Neolithic/Bronze Age art (including rock art (and including rock cup markings)) depict obvious star patterns involving the brighter stars. Some of the the oldest and largest open-air rock art sites in the world are to be found in Australia (Aboriginal) and South Africa (San (Bushman). The oldest reliably-dated rock art in Australia is 28,000 years old .However, engravings found in the Olary region of South Australia are dated as being more than 35000 years old, the oldest dated rock art on earth. Researchers assume that there are more than 100,000 significant rock art sites in Australia. The socalled Bushmen of the Kalahari (San or Basarwa) are amongst the best witnesses of the earliest known culture of homo sapiens. The San/Basarwa are the original modern inhabitants of southern Africa. For over half a century scholars have argued there is a cultural continuity between the San/Basarwa and African peoples living 30,000 or 40,000 years ago. (See: Anthropology and the Bushman by Alan Barnard (2007).) The Great Murals rock art on the walls and ceilings of natural rock shelters in the mountains of northern Baja California Sur and southern Baja California, Mexico comprises one of the largest prehistoric rock art sites in the world, spanning thousands of square kilometres. Based on an analysis of paint samples one site (Cueva San Borjitas) is dated to circa 5500 BCE. A few astronomical motifs have been identified. Anthropological/ethnographical studies of rock art in North America have shown that the astronomical symbols do not resemble the objects they represent (i.e., the rock art of the Luiseño Indians of southern California). Anthropological/ethnographical studies of Australian rock art shows the same. More importantly, there are very few graphic depictions that are recognisable as astronomical. The paucity of celestial symbols in rock art extends to the San in South Africa, the Aboriginals in Australia, to the Native American rock art sites including the Great Murals rock art sites and the rock art of the Luiseño Indians.
The chronology for the appearance of Palaeolithic period engravings/paintings on rocks and in the caves is impossible to establish. Interestingly, it is reasonably established that most of the Palaeolithic peoples lived far away from the caves where major art works appear.
The claim that 2 patterns of painted dots on the wall of the Lascaux Cave are representations of the Pleiades asterism and the Hyades asterism is based simply on graphic similarity. The "proof" does not extend beyond this point. Also, it is the "proof" that makes the particular bull (auroch) an "astronomical bull" = constellation. With this type of "proof" people are accepting what they should be proving. It is deprived of any evidence. The interpretation of prehistoric rock art/cave painting with the assistive knowledge of anthropology/ethnology offers some scope for understanding their meaning/purpose. The issue is: Can we really expect to reasonably understand the thinking of those people who created Palaeolithic rock art? The exact meaning/purpose of the Palaeolithic cave paintings that have generated so much modern interest is not known and is likely to remain unknown.

Lascaux. Le geste, l’espace et le temps by Norbert Aujoulat (2004)
Somewhat overlooked is, Lascaux. Le geste, l'espace et le temps by Norbert Aujoulat (2004). Aujoulat's book is a reexamination of previous work and the result of his own 15 years of research. In May 1980, the French Ministry of Culture decided to create a team (Research and Technology Mission) within the Centre National de Préhistoire for the research and documentation of the many decorated caves and shelters in France. Norbert Aujoulat was appointed the team's Director since that date and his team began the investigation of Lascaux in 1988.
Some issues discussed in the book include:
Absolute dating of the Lascaux paintings is not possible because the pigment used does not contain charcoal. The range of radiocarbon dates from material contained within the floor, together with the analysis of the style of the paintings on the walls, continues has become the focus of dating efforts. The proposed dating of the Lascaux paintings range from the Solutrean (16,600 BCE), the Magdalenian (13,500 BCE), with consideration of the possibility of some other period which left no debris on the cave floor. (Jesper Christensen advises - personal communication, 5 June 2017 - that "Scholars are presently getting accustomed to 22,000 BP -- which is also the conclusion in the late Norbert Aujoulat's monograph." Norbert Aujoulat, in his 2004 book accepted the radiocarbon 14 date of 18,600 BCE (obtained in 1998) and rejected the older 14C dates of maximum 15,000 BCE. Aujoulat's book was published in 2004, on the eve of the calibration debacle, which added some 4,000 years to dates in the era of Lascaux. Hence the possibility of circa 20,000 BCE.)

https://web.archive.org/web/20181013084007/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-1.html 10/16
The iconography of the art does does not assist the dating debate in any conclusive way. As example: Françoise Delpech, Francoise Delpech, a French paleontologist at the Institut de Prehistoire et de Geologie du Quanternaire at the University of Bordeau, pointed out that there is little palaeontological evidence for the aurochs during the cold conditions of the Solutrean, However, it has also been argued that the climate may have experienced short and abrupt warm period during the Last Glacial Maximum (the Lascaux interstadial - circa 15000-14000 BCE), sufficient to permit the temporary migration of aurochs. See: Cave Art and Climate Change by Kieran O’Hara (2014).
Aujoulat devotes half the book to a detailed description and analysis of the art. Almost 2000 individual figures have been recorded and Lascaux remains one of the most richly decorated sites known, and also one of the most complex. Despite the casual impression that images are found everywhere throughout the cave, analysis shows that over half occur in the Apse (Abside), on only 6% of the total decorated area, closely followed by the large number within the Passage. (The Apse contains over 1000 often superimposed engraved "graphic units.") The most commonly represented animals are horse (60%) and deer (15%). Aurochs and bison are found in some of the most striking compositions but numerically represent only a small proportion (4.6% and 4.3% respectively). The animals and signs are not uniformly distributed - there is the contribution made by the natural relief to composition.
According to Aujoulat it is suggested from a study of the coats of the animals depicted that a sequence of horse-aurochsdeer reflected a biological cycle of spring-summer-autumn. Aujoulat concludes that the complementary nature of these themes (‘an ode to life’) provides unity in the compositions. The French prehistorian Abbé André Glory (1906-1966), who carried out researches at Lascaux between 1952 and 1963, considered that there were six major phases of work at Lascaux but Aujoulat calls into question by the analysis of the friezes. Because of the cohesion of the compositions Aujoulat concludes that the principal decoration was produced in a limited time, perhaps a single generation.
Appendix 4: The Pleiades
It is perhaps unlikely that Palaeolithic people were already depicting various constellations in their artworks (the Pleiades, for example). Considering that the various constellations, including especially the Pleiades, are all but absent from such early works as the Egyptian Pyramid Texts - the most ancient body of religious texts in the world, and renowned for their astronomical content - it seems unlikely that Palaeolithic people some 10,000 years earlier were already drawing the Pleiades. It is doubtful whether there is a single unequivocal depiction of the Pleiades from anywhere in the world prior to 2000 BCE. Six or seven dots on a cave face does not readily indicate the depiction of the Pleiades. In Neolithic rock art, depictions of stars seems certain. Also, sun-like objects (i.e., at Dowth). It seems there are no Palaeolithic representations of sun-like objects. The point being: If there is little or no evidence that Palaeolithic people were representing the sun or other familiar celestial objects, how likely is it that they were depicting the Pleiades and other asterisms/constellations?
Appendix 5: The Origin and Date of the Constellation Taurus
Dates in the 3rd millennium BCE are commonly given for the existence of constellation Taurus. However, this is based on an interpretation of the bull in early literary epics and iconography. The name of the "Bull of Heaven" (mul gu4.an.na) in the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven has the same name as the bull constellation Taurus. Bulls appear on cylinder seal iconography (Sumerian and Akkadian Period 3200-2000 BCE), and Babylonian boundary-stone (kudurru) iconography (Cassite Period 1530-1160 BCE). However, it not established that constellations or constellation symbols are being depicted. It is established that - at least in the case of kudurru - god/goddess symbols are depicted. 'Prayer to the gods of the night' texts (Old Babylonian Period 1830-1530 BCE) list a bison, not a bull. It is unlikely that bison = bull. (Bison lived in the hilly flanks of the Mesopotamian low-land.) The Star-List from Boghazköy (VAT 7445) lists 2 asterisms forming part of the later constellation Taurus. The tablet VAT 7445 (published in KUB, Volume 4, Number 47) recovered from Boghazköy (the capital of the Hittite empire) in the early 19th-century, preserves a Hittite prayer/haruspicy ritual (based on the Old Babylonian Period Prayer to the Gods of the Night) that enumerates 17 stars/constellations (belonging to the path of Ea). VAT 7445 is dated to circa 1300/1200 BCE. It is possible that the Boghazköy prayer/haruspicy ritual and star-list was earlier than the "astrolabe texts." Two constellations/asterisms listed include (1) MUL.MUL ["The Stars" = The Pleiades.] and (2) is le-e [The Jaws of the Bull.]. It could be argued that Taurus is indicated as existing through these asterism names, however, the assurance is not certain. The constellation GU4.AN.NA (the Bull) first appears in entirety in Astrolabe B (at the end of the Kassite Period circa 1100 BCE), and the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil (consolidated circa 1100 BCE). Also, the star lists forming the Mul.Apin series (dated on statistical grounds by Brad Schaefer to circa late 2nd millennium BCE).
Appendix 6: Big Dipper Constellation Possibly Represented on Prehistoric Amulet

From Maud Makemson's 1954 article.
From Marcel Baudouin's 1921 article.
There is perhaps archaeological evidence that the big dipper stars were anciently recognised as a constellation. In her 1954 article on "Astronomy in Primitive Religion." (The Journal of Bible and Religion, Volume 22, Number 3, July, Pages 163171) the noted astronomer Maud Makemson reproduced a drawing of what she also believed was a representation of stars in Ursa Major and Boötes incised on a fossilised and silicified sea-urchin (Echinus), on an amulet from stone-age northern Europe. The drawing used by Makemson was likely taken from a detailed article ("Luminosities, Colors, Diameters, Densities, Masses of Stars.") relating to the history of stellar astronomy by the Swedish astronomer Knut Lundmark (who had migrated to the USA but after a few years returned to Sweden). Lundmark's article appeared in Handbuch der Astrophysik, Volume 5, Part 1, Chapter 4, 1932, Pages 209-697 (Appendices to Chapter 4 in Volume 5, Part 2, Pages 107711501). On page 221 there are 2 figures of the amulet (figure 5 and figure 6). Makemson has reproduced figure 5 as figure a and also adopted Lundmark's discussion of the amulet. Marcel Baudouin also thought he had identified the constellation Ursa Major on a number of palaeolithic bones and rocks (as well as the amulet). Makemson is apparently relying ultimately on the work of the pioneer French archaeoastronomer Marcel Baudouin (1860-1941, Secretary of the Societe Prehistorique Francaises). Baudouin's work with the fossilised and silicified sea-urchin (Echinus) was published in 1921 (Baudouin, Marcel. (1921). "La Grande Ourse et le Phallus du Ciel. [Spongiaire phalliforme à gravures]." Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française, Tome 18, Number 11, Pages 301-308). Baudouin has made the original constellation identifications. It is likely that Makemson never sighted Baudouin's original article. Through at least Lundmark's article she endorsed the interpretation of the amulet that included: (1) that the engraver had taken care to indicate the differences in brightness of the stars by varying the sizes of the cavities, and (2) the depicted configuration of the big dipper stars indicated a high age for the origin of the amulet. Discussions of the amulet and its possible astronomical interpretation are rare. The obvious question is: If the amulet is correctly described by Marcel Baudouin then is the astronomical interpretation reasonable on the evidence? The mention of the amulet by Elizabeth Baity in 1973 likely relies on knowledge of the relevant publication by

Maud Makemson and nothing further. Arjan Smit (January, 2011) kindly informed me where Makemson's article can be accessed on the internet. I finally sighted Baudouin's article in April, 2011. (Baudouin also believed that 1 group of 7 cup marks (out of a total of 18) on a stone excavated from Aurignacian cultural deposits at La Ferrassie, France, was a representation of the Big Dipper (= Big Bear) constellation.)

Source: Schütte, Gudmund. (1920). Primæval Astronomy in Scandinavia. (Off-print of his article "Primæval Astronomy in Scandinavia." from The Scottish Geographical Magazine, Volume XXXVI, October, 1920, Page 244-254.) The cup marks (cavities) - distributed without any obvious/certain plan - likely had ritual importance. However, in some cases the outlines of some of the more obvious/prominent constellations are indicated. This suggests that at least some cavities have originally been designed to form approximate "charts" of at least some star groups. More interesting, the star depictions seem to distinguish between different magnitudes. In a few cases the stars are of unequal size and indicate the possibility that (apparent) star brightness (magnitude) is being indicated/depicted.

Throughout parts of Europe and Asia (also Africa, the Americas, and Australia) many rocks and stones – mostly exposed are decorated with prehistoric hollowed cup markings. A cup-mark is a roughly circular depression produced by human hand into a stone or rock. They appear singly, in lines, or as the basis for further patterns, called cup-and-rings, so as to cover a whole or portion of rock. Almost all cup marks are between 1.5 and 10 centimetres in diameter and their average depth is between 10 and 12 millimetres. They occur on horizontal, sloping, or vertical stone/rock surfaces. The occurrence of single cup marks is unusual. They typically occur in groups, often numbering up to 200 (or even 1000) in a single location. They would likely have been made using a hammer and chisel type instrument. Archeologists have studied the cup markings for over 100 years. New ones are also constantly being discovered during the course of survey work, etc. The reason, or reasons, behind these carvings is unknown. Various suggestions have been put forward since early antiquarians identified them as prehistoric; including maps of the world, maps of the stars, sites where fat was set alight for religion (or to replicate the night sky), records of ownership or boundaries, etc. Despite the multiplicity of the suggested ideas there are common features in the setting of the 'art' forms - they are usually on highland overlooking open land. The cup marks are very difficult to date. They bear no direct relation to known prehistoric settlement sites. It is believed that cup markings were made during all three eras of the Stone Age - Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. However, dating remains debatable - both Neolithic and Bronze age dates being suggested. Cup marks seem to have lost favour in the middle Bronze Age. Similar cup markings appear on stones and rocks hundreds of kilometres apart and with no obvious connection. Archaeologists view cup marks as an abstract form of art, because there are never any representations recognisable as animals or people. Despite many vigorous arguments their meaning, dating and placing is likely to remain a puzzle. Cup marks are now interpreted as a pattern of behavior throughout the prehistoric world. Most current theories associate cup marks with fertility rites. For instance, the archaeologist Robert Bednarik cites a report by the eminent amateur Australian archaeologist/ethnologist Charles Mountford who witnessed the making of cup marks in Central Australia in 1948 as an 'increase ritual' for the pink cockatoo. The term "cupule" was invented recently (2003) by the archeologist Robert Bednarik, in an attempt to provide a consistent name for a phenomenon.
Since the early 20th-century attempts have been made to interpret the distribution of these cup marks as the patterns of constellations. Perceived patterns of these cup marks have frequently been compared to constellations. Some researchers, both academic and amateur, believe that prehistoric cup marks on stones are grouped together in the shape of well-known constellations. During the late 19th-century and early 20th-century several academics attempted to identify patterns among the cup marks on stones in Europe (especially Sweden) that they believed corresponded (or could correspond) to constellations. (The Big Dipper was a common constellation identified.) However, there is still no consensus about their meaning. The debate whether prehistoric cup marks on stone in Europe can be interpreted as representations of ancient constellations is not yet settled. However, recent interpretations are not supportive of this view. Three early academics who attempted to demonstrate that prehistoric 'astronomers' used cup marks to represent individual constellations on rock and stone were Gudmund Schütte (1920), George Browne (1921), and Marcel Baudouin (1926). Gudmund Schütte (1872-1958) was Danish philologist and historian, George Browne (1833-1930) was a British clergyman and archaeologist, and Marcel Baudouin (1860-1941) was a French historian and pioneering archaeoastronomer. Basically, Browne and Baudouin only 'identified' instances of single constellations. Schütte believed he could identify examples (stones at Venslan, Denmark, and Dalby, Denmark) of 'star maps' (= multiple constellations/groups of constellations) portrayed on stones and rocks. One of the earliest proponents of prehistoric astronomical theories (focused on Scotland) was the Scottish medical doctor and amateur archaeologist George Moore (1803-1880(?)) (Ancient Pillar Stones (1865)). One of the most enthusiastically persistent early proponents of prehistoric astronomical theories (focused on Scotland) was the Scottish amateur archaeologist Ludovic Mann (1869-1955) (Archaic Sculpturings (1915)). In 1930 Mann reported in the science journal Nature he had interpreted markings on two stones at Langside and Cleuch (near Glasgow), as having astronomical significance. The markings he interpreted consisted of a series of rings, arcs and cup mark depressions. According to Mann some of the groups of cup marks resemble the Sickle in Leo and (more doubtfully) a star-group in Scorpio. Mann also claimed he calculated that there had been an eclipse on March 28, 2983 BCE from markings on the stone itself. He stated that afterwards he found from German astronomers that there had been an eclipse on that date. According to Mann he obtained the year by his interpretation of the system of wheel-like markings on the stone, which he interpreted to be cycles of years. In spite of the difficulties of interpretation - such as the difficulties due to the effects of weathering and aging being able to create cup marks, and also the frequent looseness of the matches made - the belief still exists that prehistoric 'astronomers' used cup marks engraved on rocks and stones to represent individual constellations.

Appendix 8: Neolithic Whorl Markings
The abundance of whorls as a decorative motif on stones and pottery during the Neolithic period may simply derive from the importance of hand-spindles (spindle whorls) for weaving. Spindle whorls were usually made of stone or clay. In China, however, Deborah Porter (From Deluge to Discourse (1996, Pages 96-97)) suggests the decorative whorl may indicate an early association between weaving and its metaphorical application to cosmology.
Appendix 9: Some Issues Regarding the Possibility of Paleolithic Constellations
From Alan Salt's webpage, Ancient Science and the Science of Ancient Things (http://alunsalt.com/2011/11/14/the-earliestastronomers/):
"Hayden & Villeneuve examined many ethnographies and found almost all peoples had a concept of the extreme limits of the Sun, the solstices. They also tied lunar cycles to environmental events, like the appearance of first berries. In some ways this is similar to Hesiod's astronomy which is a factor in a wider cosmological view that ties astronomy, weather and nature into one whole cosmos to be observed. They also — and this is big — found no evidence of observation of the equinoxes, except for one group. This ties neatly with the Clive Ruggles paper "Whose Equinox?" where he has argued that looking for equinoxes in pre-Greek astronomies is an anachronism. Solstice observations could be accurate, but they say the observations used "trees, posts or rock alignments" they give an example of a man sitting on a certain stump watching the shadow from a specific tree, and we know this astronomical activity happened because an anthropologist was there recording it, but what debris did it leave? If people used a similar technique in the Palaeolithic what would you look for in the archaeology? Hayden & Villeneuve reflect on how these special places and the techniques for using them translate into social relationships. They argue that it leads to what is effectively a 'secret society' of people with astronomical knowledge. Archaeologically this raises the possibility of equipment being stored in secret spaces, that might be marked with art for those in the know. A secret society implies specialist knowledge, but that creates a problem. If you don’t have writing how to you transmit knowledge? This is a major topic for the paper. One way is to embed tales in constellations. A survey of 26 modern hunter-gather groups revealed 18 constellations, with some complexities. The interesting findings are that surprisingly few constellations or stars were recognised by more than a third of peoples. Orion was known to 16 groups, Venus 15, the Pleiades 12 and the Milky Way and Ursa Major 10. There's a long tail of other stars with many being important to only one or two groups. That, to me, suggests that astronomical knowledge is often local and specific." (Hayden, Brian. and Villeneuve, Suzanne. (2011). "Astronomy in the Upper Palaeolithic?"

The Arles-Fontvieille Megalithic Monuments: astronomy and cosmology in the European Neolithic by Morgan Saletta (PhD thesis, University of Melbourne, 2014) (Url: https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/55083)
Abstract: "This thesis is an archaeoastronomical study of a group of megalithic sites in the south of France, the Arles/Fontvieille monuments, as well as a historiographical and epistemological study of the context of these sites within megalithic studies more generally. The Arles-Fontvieille monuments were deliberately aligned to the setting sun so as to be illuminated at important times of the year for cosmological and seasonal, ritual purposes. I have documented this seasonal illumination at three of the 4 intact sites and used 3D modelling to demonstrate the illumination in the fourth monument, the Grotte de Cordes. My archaeoastronomical research and interpretation of these monuments intervenes in debates concerning Neolithic and late prehistoric astronomy, cosmology and the origin, diffusion and evolution of megalithic monuments in Europe. Firstly, the similarity between the illumination at the Arles-Fontvieille monuments and the well-known illumination of monuments such as Maeshowe in Scotland and Newgrange in Ireland converges with a growing body of archaeological evidence suggesting that cosmological principles and practices, including those related to megalithic architecture such as passage graves, diffused in Western Europe by way of long distance contact and exchange networks during the late 4th and early 3rd millennia BC, a period which saw the florescence of major monumental centers in Atlantic Europe as well as at Arles-Fontvieille. Secondly, there is a growing amount of archaeological evidence suggesting that megalithic monuments were conceived of as 'houses of the dead' and were symbolically and cosmologically related to the houses of the living, a connection that is also strongly supported by ethnographic analogy. Building on this, I argue that the solar orientation of megalithic monuments in late prehistoric Europe- which is strongly suggested by statistical surveys- had its origin in the functional orientation practices, cosmological symbolism and lived experience of domestic architecture. Thirdly, the discovery of previously unknown seasonal illumination events in a major group of monuments suggests that illumination may have been a predominant factor in the orientation of many more, perhaps even the majority, of chambered megalithic monuments. I argue that archaeoastronomers need to think more like architects and anthropologists in their interpretation of the relationship between monumental orientation, astronomy and cosmology. For many megalithic monuments, seasonal illumination for cosmologically symbolic and ceremonial purposes offers a much stronger interpretive framework than the paradigmatic assumption that chambered megalithic monuments are targeting the position of a celestial body on or near the horizon. Solar illumination, and/or the creation of zones of light and shadow within monuments, was cosmologically symbolic and exploited for cyclical ceremonial practices linked to the social dynamics, temporal rhythms and beliefs about life, death and ancestry of the people that built and used them."
Appendix 11: Archaeoastronomy
Archaeoastronomy(/archeoastronomy) is generally defined as the study of how people in the past "have understood the phenomena in the sky, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures." Clive Ruggles, a distinguished authority on the subject, states that it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is usually/frequently twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.
Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for people termed as 'archaeoastronomers.' Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky is used to reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.
Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture. However, are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs. The need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy likely led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: "...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other." Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of pseudo-historical accounts.
During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled Germanische Himmelskunde [Teutonic Skylore]. The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the Ancient Near East in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the so-called Aryans (Indo-Europeans) over the Semites.
Since the 19th-century, numerous scholars have sought to use archaeoastronomical calculations to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE. However, David Pingree, a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned "the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers."

More recently Gallagher, Pyle, and Fell interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic Ogham alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical claims, to describe it as an example of "cult archaeology."
Archaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of Archaeocryptography, when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulcán at Chichen Itza.
Appendix 12: Homo Migration Out Of Africa And Into Europe
By the late 20th-century a combination of genetic and paleontological techniques allowed scientists to confirm that our own peculiar species originated in Africa. Anatomically-modern representatives of Homo Sapiens originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago, and populations of our species began to disperse out of Africa by circa 70,000 years BCE. Much remains to be discovered about human evolution during the past 500,000 years. Modern evidence indicates that multiple human lineages left Africa and dispersed throughout Europe and Asia. A combination of fossil and genetic data has given significant support to the theory that many of these disparate populations interbred with each other. The earliest remains of modern humans in Europe date to circa 45,000 BCE. The single skullcap (dated circa 55,000 BCE) evidence from the Manot Cave (discovered 2008) in northern Israel indicates that humans left their evolutionary cradle in Africa and passed through the Middle East on their way to Europe. Prehistoric humans left Africa far earlier than circa 70,000 BCE but these migratory populations appear to have eventually become extinct. (Circa at least 250,000 BCE small groups of Homo heidelbergensis, an early human species, migrated across Africa and into Europe.) At the Qafzeh cave in Israel ochre was used by hominins there circa 80,000 BCE. (Hominins = members of the human clade/species (all the evolutionary descendants of a common ancestor).) The recently found Qesem Cave teeth (4 of) in Israel and the identification and origin of the Quesem Cave humans remains unclear. The teeth are presently dated to circa 300,000 BCE. Genetic studies relating to the evolution of Homo sapiens are summarised in "A new view of the birth of Homo sapiens." by A. Gibbons (Science, Volume 31, Pages 392-394). The ancestors of modern humans emerged in Africa circa 200,000 years BCE. Some migrated from Africa. Later, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa several times in the past circa 100,000 years BCE. A substantial dispersal of Homo sapiens occurred circa 50,000 BCE. Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals and also with Denisovans in Asia. (Denisova hominin is an extinct species of human in the genus Homo that lived in eastern Eurasia.)
During the last glacial maximum the west European landscape was mainly covered by cool steppe vegetation. There is some evidence for forest stands in the Mediterranean region and tundra shrubs in France. (A forest stand is a close community of trees having a common border that distinguishes it from adjacent communities of trees. A forest is a "collection of stands." A tundra shrub is a dwarf shrub. Temperature warming turns tundra shrubs into trees.) After the end of the last glacial maximum the mean temperature increased and there were progressively larger woods and forests. See: Peyron, O. et al. (1998). Climatic reconstruction in Europe for 18000 yr B.P. from pollen data." (Quarternary Research, Volume 49, Pages 183-196).

B: Palaeolithic Siberian-North American Constellations
2: Ice-age bear constellation?
The drawing the astronomer Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687) made of Ursa Major for his great celestial atlas Uranographica which was published in 1690. The constellation is drawn as if being viewed from outside the celestial sphere. The issue of its pre-contact antiquity is somewhat vexing. There are suitable reasons for believing its existence is post-contact.
The three most obvious groupings of stars in the northern sky are (1) the Dipper, (2) Orion, and (3) the Pleiades. (Readily apparent star patterns liable to grouping as constellations by any culture include (1) the Pleiades, (2) the Hyades, (3) the Big Dipper (in Ursa Major), (4) Orion, (5) Orion's Belt, (6) the Northern Cross (in Cygnus), (7) Cassiopeia, (8) Castor and Pollux, and (9) the Southern Cross.) The ethnographic evidence indicates that the Big Dipper asterism that presently forms part of our modern Ursa Major constellation was anciently identified as a bear constellation throughout many parts of the world.
There is perhaps archaeological evidence that the Big Dipper stars were anciently recognised as a constellation. In her 1954 article on "Astronomy in Primitive Religion." (The Journal of Bible and Religion, Volume 22, Number 3, July, Pages 163171) the noted astronomer Maud Makemson reproduced a drawing of what she also believed was a representation of stars in Ursa Major and Boötes incised on a fossilised and silicified sea-urchin (Echinus), on an amulet from stone-age northern Europe. The drawing used by Makemson was likely taken from a detailed article ("Luminosities, Colors, Diameters, Densities, Masses of Stars.") relating to the history of stellar astronomy by the Swedish astronomer Knut Lundmark (who had migrated to the USA but after a few years returned to Sweden). Lundmark's article appeared in Handbuch der Astrophysik, Volume 5, Part 1, Chapter 4, 1932, Pages 209-697 (Appendices to Chapter 4 in Volume 5, Part 2, Pages 107711501). On page 221 there are 2 figures of the amulet (figure 5 and figure 6). Makemson has reproduced figure 5 as figure a and also adopted Lundmark's discussion of the amulet. Marcel Baudouin also thought he had identified the constellation Ursa Major on a number of palaeolithic bones and rocks (as well as the amulet). Makemson is apparently relying ultimately on the work of the pioneer French archaeoastronomer Marcel Baudouin (1860-1941, Secretary of the Societe Prehistorique Francaises). Baudouin's work with the fossilised and silicified sea-urchin (Echinus) was published in 1921 (Baudouin, Marcel. (1921). "La Grande Ourse et le Phallus du Ciel. [Spongiaire phalliforme à gravures]." Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française, Tome 18, Number 11, Pages 301-308). Baudouin has made the original constellation identifications. It is likely that Makemson never sighted Baudouin's original article. Through at least Lundmark's article she endorsed the interpretation of the amulet that included: (1) that the engraver had taken care to indicate the differences in brightness of the stars by varying the sizes of the cavities, and (2) the depicted configuration of the Big Dipper stars indicated a high age for the origin of the amulet. Discussions of the amulet and its possible astronomical interpretation are rare. The obvious question is: If the amulet is correctly described by Marcel Baudouin then is the astronomical interpretation reasonable on the evidence? The mention of the amulet by Elizabeth Baity in 1973 likely relies on knowledge of the relevant publication by Maud Makemson and nothing further. Arjan Smit (January, 2011) kindly informed me where Makemson's article can be accessed on the internet. I finally sighted Baudouin's article in April, 2011. (Baudouin also believed that 1 group of 7 cup

marks (out of a total of 18) on a stone excavated from Aurignacian cultural deposits at La Ferrassie, France, was a representation of the Big Dipper (= Big Bear) constellation.) Note: A discussion of the occurrence of representations of the Big Dipper on Paleolithic artefacts was also given by Baudouin in, Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, Tome 36, avril-may, 1922, Pages 158-170-221-228.
Stone-age amulet from northern Europe as representation of representation of stars in Ursa Major and Boötes from "Astronomy in Primitive Religion." by Maud Makemson (The Journal of Bible and Religion, Volume 22, Number 3, July, 1954, Pages 163-171). Makemson drew on the work of the pioneer French archaeoastronomer Marcel Baudouin in analysing a map of the stars in Ursa Major and Boötes incised on a fossilized sea-urchin amulet from stone-age northern Europe. Makemson wrote: "The representation of Ursa Major ... is remarkable for two reasons: first because the relative positions of the stars point to a very great antiquity for the amulet; and second, because the engraver has taken pains to indicate the difference in brightness of the stars, by varying the size of the cavities."
Original drawing from "La Grande Ourse et le Phallus du Ciel. [Spongiaire phalliforme à gravures]." by Marcel Baudouin (Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française, Tome 18, Number 11, 1921, Pages 301-308). A possible criticism is it is a case of interpreting images on the basis of what they look like to us.
Early folklorists were intrigued that the early Greeks (but only a few other Europeans before the Middle Ages) and some Native Americans (i.e., the Mi'kmaq, Algonquin, and the Zuni) identified the Big Dipper as a bear (and hunters). Most did not (i.e., the Egyptians, Arabs, and Germans, and Native Americans). Other versions don't have hunters, or feature other animals. For folklorists, making comparisons became an interesting subject of analysis and discussion. It was suggested that if the Greeks and some Native Americans thought the Big Dipper was a bear, then the narrative must have originated before both groups became geographically isolated more than 10,000 years ago. For many people it seemed unreasonable to suggest that there was a likelihood for 2 independent cultures to have independently formulated a similar simple story. The theme of a man or men pursuing one or more animals, and they are all changed into constellations is not uncommon.

Hunting is a common worldwide activity. The Greeks have a myth in which Orion the hunter pursued Scorpius the scorpion, and Zeus then placed them both among the stars.
Native American tribes of the northeastern part of North America commonly identify the 7 key stars of Ursa Major (the "Big Dipper" asterism) as a bear. In his 1906 article "Cherokee Star Lore." (Boas Anniversary Volume, (Pages 354-366)) Stansbury Hagar remarked that generally among the Native American Indians the most important constellations were Ursa Major (= the Big Dipper) and the Pleiades. The identification of Ursa Major (or more accurately the stars forming the Big Dipper asterism) as a bear in North America largely exists in the Algonkin (Algonquin) speaking groups but also in the Plateau groups.
Clan bears are not to be confused with a bear constellation. "Bears are also one of the most important and widespread clan animals in Native American cultures. Tribes with Bear Clans include the Creek (whose Bear Clan is named Nokosalgi or Nokosvlke,) the Chippewa (whose Bear Clan and its totem are called Nooke,) Algonquian tribes such as the Mi'kmaq and Menominee, the Huron and Iroquois tribes, Plains tribes such as the Caddo and Osage, the Hopi (whose Bear Clan is called Honngyam or Hona-wungwa), the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of New Mexico, and Northwest Coast tribes such as the Tlingit, Tsimshian, Nisgaa-Gitksan, and Salishan tribes. Bear was an important clan crest on the Northwest Coast and can often be found carved on totem poles. And many eastern tribes, such as the Caddo, Lenape, and Iroquois, have a Bear Dance among their tribal dance traditions." (Native Languages of the Americas website: http://www.native-languages.org/legendsbear.htm (accessed 2015).)
The Cherokee language is related to the languages spoken by the Iroquois peoples - linguistically the Cherokee are connected to the Iroquois. The Iroquois people occupied the area comprising New York state and the Great Lakes region. At some time the Cherokee left this homeland area and migrated further south, occupying the region of the southeastern USA primarily the region of present-day Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia. (The Algonquin tribes, numbering as many as 100 at one time, were also living along the Great Lakes, and St. Lawrence River, and the Eastern Seaboard from present-day Maine down to Virginia.) By the 19th-century, European settlers in the USA called the Cherokee one of the "Five Civilized Tribes," because they had adopted numerous cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers. (As example of (complete) loss of Native American knowledge: For a brief comment by the ethnologist James Mooney that by the end of the 19th-century the Cherokees had entirely lost their their old calendrical system and had adopted the European calendrical system see The American Antiquarian, Volume XVI, Number 4, July, 1894, Page 244.) The Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia and the Iroquois along the St. Lawrence seaway share the same story about the Big Bear constellation. In the story, the quadrangle of the Big Dipper represents a bear that is pursued by 7 hunters; the 3 closest hunters are the handle of the Big Dipper. The Iroquois story is that the constellation of the Big Dipper was formed when 3 giant hunters chased and wounded a bear, whose blood spread on the autumn leaves as he climbed a mountain and jumped into the sky. The hunters followed. The 3 hunters became the 3 stars of the Big Dipper's "handle," and the bear became the 4 stars of the 'dipper." (Perhaps because the 4 bright stars were seen as the 4 paws of the bear. The hunters continue the chase forever. (Interestingly, the Iroquois oriented their long houses according to the 4 cardinal directions so that the Sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn, and set in the direction of the exit.) The Cherokee also had a story of the Big Dipper as a bear pursued by hunters. It is obviously suggested that the particular story has a common origin.
Bear hunting has a vast history throughout Europe. Bear hunting was common in Europe, even in the 19th-century. Bear hunting is still popular in Russia and conducted for tourists (able/willing to pay the fee) in Romania. Europe's largest brown bear population is now in Romania, their main home territory spreading along the Carpathian Mountains. The early French settlers at least, continued bear hunting in North America. The Mi'kmaq hunted black bears inhabiting the region. Interestingly, a small number of Basques (from the western Pyrenees and Cantabrian seacoast region of southern France and northern Spain) immigrated to America as part of the California gold rush (1848-1855).
Whether the North American bear constellation is an indigenous pre-contact constellation or a post-European contact development has been long discussed. Also, how freely Native Americans borrowed and adapted European tales is still being researched. The answer may be that it was a comparatively late introduction from Siberia/Asia. It is commonly held that the existence of certain parallels between Siberian/Asian star lore and North America star lore relating to the Big Dipper asterism establishes a pre-Columbian origin for the latter and also an Ice-Age antiquity for such. Proponents maintain thatthe Big Dipper bear constellation entered the American continent with a wave of immigrants circa 14,000 years ago. The eminent astronomer and science historian Owen Gingerich, in his article "The origin of the zodiac." (Sky and Telescope, Volume 67, 1984, Pages 218-220) proposed that a bear constellation crossed the Bering Straits with ancient migrants. (It is generally treated as a reasonable claim by other historians of astronomy and also some folklorists rather than appreciated as a speculative remark. It is somewhat puzzling that it has become something of a standard "argument" as to why the bear constellation in North America must have been introduced very early. Gingerich has also essentially endorsed Willy Hartner's highly speculative "Lion-Bull combat" as early constellations claims as reasonable. Hartner's claims for such are ignored by archaeologists, assyriologists, and art historians.) Gingerich acknowledges Campbell's chapter "Circumpolar Cults of the Master Bear." (Pages 147-151) in his book The Way of Animal Powers: Historical Atlas of World Mythology. Volume 1 (1983). The ultimate source for the contents of Campbell's chapter may have been Geographische Kulturkunde by Leo Frobenius (1904). In this book Frobenius examined world-wide diffusion. In his approach to mythology Joseph Campbell was influenced by Leo Frobenius. Leo Frobenius was involved in the study of the circumpolar bear cult. In 1899, Richard Allen, in his book Star-Names and Their Meanings, and in 1900 Stansbury Hagar, in a journal article on the Mi'kmaq celestial bear, both proposed an ancient origin in Asia for the North American bear constellation. However, the

idea is problematic and remains highly controversial. Today, archaeological methods have largely replaced the previous method that made almost exclusive use of ethnographic parallels in determining the history of arctic peoples, including Eskimos (Inuit). The final blow to the kulturkreise theory of frobenius, etc. came from archaeology. Excavations failed to produce evidence for it. As example: "To put it negatively, there were not Kulturkreis-like movements across Bering Strait of specific traditions, physical types, or linguistic stocks from Asia that then spread out along specific routes in the New World." ("Men Out of Asia; as Seen From the Northwest Yukon." by Richard McBeath (Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska, Volume 7, Number 2, May 1959, Pages 41-70, Page 53).) Archaeology gives a somewhat different picture regarding possibilities. Grant Keddie (Royal British Columbia Museum), 1989, in tracing the diffusion of the labret, set out a case ("Symbolism and Context: The World History of the Labret and Cultural Diffusion on the Pacific Rim." (Paper presented at the Circum-Pacific Prehistory Conference, Session VIII Prehistoric Trans-Pacific Contacts, Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., August 1-6, 1989) that the Pacific Rim area circa 3000 BCE saw intensive interaction over broad areas and involving extensive sea travel.
Anthropologists currently believe the Inuit (Eskimo) of Alaska and Canada are relatively recent arrivals in North America, from northeastern Asia, arriving only during the last 5000-6000 years. Likely beginning circa 4000 BCE (circa middle Holocene) and routinely continuing into the 1st-millennium BCE. Arriving by boat in Alaska they migrated across the top of Canada as far east as Greenland.
Stansbury Hagar remarked in his 1900 article ("The Celestial Bear." (Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 13, Number 49, Apr.-Jun., Pages 92-103)) on the Native American bear constellation: "When we seek legends connected with the Bear, we find that in spite of the widespread knowledge of the name there is by no means a wealth of material." In his 1906 article "Cherokee Star Lore." (Boas Anniversary Volume. (Pages 354-366)) Stansbury Hagar also remarked that the Mi'kmaq tradition of the Three Kings (= the three stars of Orion's belt) is evidently of European origin.
In 1896 Stansbury Hagar published an article which in part identified the Mi'kmaq snake dance symbolised the Pleiades. (The work for this was conducted several years earlier.) However, no early ethnologist/investigator seems to have made the effort to investigate and argue for a pre-Columbian origin for all or most of Mi'kmaq uranography/star lore. Even William Gibbon simply summarised secondary sources for his two papers setting out the existence of certain parallels between Siberian/Asian star lore and North America star lore.
Ignoring Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie by the Recollect Order missionary Father Chréstien Le Clerq (1691) the 1900 article by Stansbury Hagar appears to be the sole source for the details of a Mi'kmaq celestial bear tale. This is unfortunate. Hagar was never a professional anthropologist/ethnologist. At the time Stansbury Hagar began investigating Mi'kmaq lore he was only 22 or 23 years old. To his credit he did actual field work. Whether he paid his informants (consultants) is not recorded. Throughout the 1800s the Mi'kmaqs had been living in rather wretched conditions on reservations. Also, the government had attempted to suppress their traditions. The celestial bear tale may have been obtained when he was 26 years old (and concluded his investigations of Mi'kmaq lore. (It is also unfortunate that he does not identify his sources. It appears the story was gathered whilst literally sitting around a number of Mi'kmaq camp-fires. There was no specific "follow-up" with the particular story-tellers. There is doubt regarding the accuracy of at least one of Hagar's claims. In their book, The Micmac Indians of Eastern Canada (1955), Wilson Wallis and Ruth Wallis (Pages 155 & 260) state no confirmation could be found of Hagar's observation that "a form of water-burial analogous to the Norse, was once practiced by the Micmac at the funeral of chiefs." Also, another modern researcher has written that Hagar's claim of hermits living in the mountains has not been able to be verified.) Professional anthropology was not established in Canada until 1911 with the newly-established Anthropology Division. The Baptist missionary Reverend Silas Rand (1810-1889) recorded in 1850 (A Short Statement of Facts Relating to the History, Manners, Customs, Language, and Literature of the Micmac Tribe of Indians in Nova Scotia.) that the Mi'kmaq call the Great Bear constellation, 'Muen' (the bear). (The celestial bear tale is not among the Mi'kmaq tales later collected (during 1915 and 1922) by the ethnologist Frank Speck.) Not answered is the question of whether the celestial bear story is a rigid embedded part of Mi'kmaq traditional culture. Certainly the sole particular example of a Mi'kmaq celestial bear which has been given by Stansbury Hagar does not validate that the Big Dipper as a bear is the product of a stable and relatively widespread Mi'kmaq belief. Exactly where Hagar travelled is vague. (However, the Mi'kmaqs were mostly living on reservations.) We only know he visited the Digby area of the province. At the time of Hagar's visits to Digby (Nova Scotia) there were only 160 Mi'kmaq in Digby County. Most of these would have been of mixed French Acadian descent and only a few would likely have been "full-bloods." (It is, at least, a traditional 19th-century belief of the Mi'kmaq informants (consultants) as recorded by non Native-American.) Earlier references are far briefer. It has been noted by the ethnologist Jesse Fawkes that "... in observations on the traditions of the Indian tribes, the tendency of the listener to add his own thoughts or interpretations is very great. Moreover, no two Indians tell the same story alike." (See: "Contributions to Passamaquoddy Folk-Lore." (Journal of American Folk-Lore, October-December, 1890).) In the same article the (untrained) ethnologist Jesse Fewkes also wrote: "Mr. Leland's work [The Algonquin Legends of New England by Charles Leland (1884).] exhibits throughout want of exactness in recording." Even Frank Speck's study of the Mi'kmaq has been shown to be frequently flawed - especially his model of pre-European Mi'kmaq riverine fisheries (but mostly because of problems with methodology). (See: "The Perfect Disguise: Frank Speck's Pilgrimage to Ktaqamkuk - The Place of Fog - In 1914." by David McNab (American Review of Canadian Studies, March, 2001).) The premise of knowledgeable informants (now called consultants) and competent researchers requires examination. (The historian Michael Coe considers that the most complete study of the starlore of any American Indian group was the Navajo and was accomplished by Berard Haile (1947).)

In his monograph Naskapi: The Savage Hunters of the Labrador Peninsula (1935) Frank Speck provides numerous examples of the extensive cultural integration (genetic, "spiritual" and material) that has taken place in Labrador (with the Algonkins (Algonquins)) over the past 400 years. Dating oral traditions can be exceedingly difficult. It is a well established that oral traditions tend to confuse fairly recent events as being "ancient or old" - anything over a hundred years or so can be retold as an original myth. There are many instances in the anthropological literature where events which can be historically placed have been incorporated into tribal lore as very old.
The term "Micmac" for the Native Americans of Nova Scotia (the Atlantic Provinces and Southern Gaspe Bay Peninsula) dates to English records from the end of French rule. Basically it is a mispronunciation of the word Mi'kmaw. The term Nova Scotia = New Scotland (replacing the previous French term "Acadia" (sometimes mispelled, Arcadia)) also dates to the same period. (Samuel de Champlain arrived in Nova Scotia on May 12, 1604. The establishment of French outposts in Atlantic Canada led to the founding of Acadia.) In 1604-1605, with the founding of Port-Royal, in Acadia (later named Nova Scotia) the first serious attempt was made to encourage permanent French settlement of of Acadia. By 1671 there were some 500 French settlers in Acadia, 300 of these were at Port-Royal. (Father Chréstien Le Clerq's account of 1691 was not made prior to other French contact. He came some 50 years at least after French settlers had been engaging with Mi'kmaqs for some time.) There are several explanations offered for the term "Micmac" or "Mi'kmaq." One is that before European contact the Mi'kmaq called themselves L'nu'k meaning simply "the people." Mi'kmaq is the plural form of the singular Mi'kmaw. The present name "Mi'kmaq" derives from "nikmaq" which means "the people." Mi'kmaq also presently live in New England, particularly in Maine and Massachusetts.
Both of William Gibbon's papers on "Asiatic Parallels in North American Star Lore." (published 1964 and 1972 in Journal of American Folk-Lore) present a strong case for the common origin of the bear constellation in Asia and America. Gibbon tracks a number of astronomical stories from the Caucasus to America. I would, however, hesitate to conclude that he has conclusively presented the case for the such. (The folklorist Alan Dundes deemed that Gibbon had conducted limited analyses. See the article: "North American Indian Folklore Studies." by Alan Dundes (Journal de la Société des Américanistes, 1967, Tome 56, Numero 1, Pages 53-79). Dundes does not indicate he believes there was a prolific borrowing of European tales by Native Americans.) In 1902 Waldemar Bogoras published a study ("The Folklore of Northeastern Asia, as Compared with that of Northwestern America." (American Anthropologist, Volume 4, Number 4,
December, Pages 577-683)) showing that many folklore tales of northeast Asian peoples had often striking similarities to the folklore tales of the Inuit and Northwest American tribes. (Note: Best used with some caution.) (See also: Asiatic Influences in American Folklore by Gudmund Hatt (1949).) Obviously the question is: How to account for the similarities? However, the issue is perhaps more complex and uncertain than simply arguing for Ice-Age diffusion. Both the ancient Asian and the North American cultures were bear-hunting cultures. If persons wish to maintain that the Native Americans brought the bear constellation with them circa 14,000 years ago when they entered the America continent then they need to make a suitably convincing case that can deal with problematic issues. (Paul Shepard and Barry Sanders (The Sacred Paw (1985), whilst admitting that not every Native American tribe knew of a bear in the sky, simply state: "Some, apparently, had forgotten.") The conclusive case for the early entry of the bear constellation into the Americas has perhaps yet to be incisively made. An early (i.e., pre-Columbian) Native American depiction of the Great Bear constellation would be a convincing discovery. Overall, the Native Americans had few constellations.
See the recent (interesting) investigation: d'Huy, Julien. (2013). "A Cosmic Hunt in the Berber sky: a phylogenetic reconstruction of a Palaeolithic mythology." (Les Cahiers de l'AARS, Number 16, Pages 93-106). (Les Cahiers de l'AARS = L'association de Amis de l'Art Rupestre Saharien.) See also: "Scientists Trace Society's Myths to Primordial Origins." by Julien d'Huy, in Scientific American, September, 2016). The cosmic/astral bear hunt motif is unique to Northern and Central Eurasia and to the Americas. Usually the 3 stars of the handle of the Big Dipper are hunters and the Dipper itself is an animal (a deer or a bear).
The late Danish ethnologist Kaj Birket-Smith (once Curator of Ethnology at the National Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark) wrote: "The cultural link between northern Eurasia and North America is so close that the two parts should be regarded as a single circumpolar cultural district in which a similar environment forms the basis for common development."
The wider question of Palaeolithic connections between Europe - in addition to Eurasia - and the American continent (as example: suggested by artifacts from the Kogruk site, Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska) is not settled. The likely period for Palaeolithic Europeans to use the Bering Strait land bridge to cross into the American continent is the Wisconsin maximum (glacial period) circa 23000-19000 BCE. (See the 1963 publication on the Kogruk complex by the American archaeologist John Campbell. Campbell, John. (1963). "Ancient Alaska and Paleolithic Europe." (Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska, Volume 10, Number 2, April 1963, Pages 29-49. (Note: Based on his work (tool discoveries) at the Kogruk site, Anakturvuk Pass, Alaska in 1956. John Campbell (1927-2013) was an archaeologist and faculty member of the University of New Mexico (rejoining 1964 until retirement).)
Currently archaeology and ethno-history both have an emphasis on cultural interaction. The evidence associated with the history of the pre-contact period and also the post-contact period of the Americas shows that cultural groups do not exist for any extended periods of time in total isolation and that cultural interaction has shaped even those cultural groups who lived in remote and sparsely populated regions. For the northeast region of Canada there is now sufficient archaeological and historical knowledge to understand the inter-related history of the Paleo-Eskimo, Inuit, Dorset, Beothuk and the Mi'kmaq and Abenaki cultures. These cultures largely shared the same climate and geography and their worlds often intersected.

(Frank Speck mentions cultural affinities between the Beothuk and the Eskimo.) The arctic and sub-arctic regions and their adjacent coasts are increasingly recognised as longstanding "highways" rather than as barriers to the flow of plants and animals, peoples and cultures. Siberian influence in several early Alaskan cultures is now recognised, and Bering Strait sources are known for many features of Eskimo cultures found across the Arctic. The evidence reinforces the intimate relation that exists between culture and environment and it shows that climate, in particular, often plays a determining role in cultural interaction and technological innovation. (See: A History of the Native People of Canada. Volume 1. (10,0001,000 B.C.) by James Wright (1995); and Ancient People of the Arctic by Robert McGhee (1996).)
Native American groups have always "borrowed culture" from one another. This includes stories. For an example of the dispersion of myths between Native American tribes (i.e., "The Story of the Waiwailus" from the Bella Coola to the Chilcotin) see A Guide to B. C. Indian Myth and Legend by Ralph Maud (1982, Page 85). The German-American pioneering anthropologist Franz Boas wrote a paper ("Northern Elements in the Mythology of the Navaho," American Anthropologist, Volume X, November, 1897, Pages 371-376.) discussing the evidence for the influence complex elements of of Northeastern Indian mythology on Navaho mythology. The Navaho lived in the Southwest. Historically, the diffusion of agriculture throughout the Americas probably originated from the Valley of Mexico. The diffusion of the Sun Dance throughout much of North America probably originated from the Plains Area. The Algonquin who moved into North Carolina borrowed from their southern neighbours as they adapted to the geographical and climatic conditions of the area. The people of the Woodland Period in the Champlain Valley borrowed from other groups around them. (See also: "Some Aspects of the Aztec Religion in the Hopi Kachina Cult." by Susan James (Journal of the Southwest, Volume 42, 2000). The author also comments on the similarities between Native American tales and folklore and those in other parts of the world. A paleolithic "universal mythology" is postulated with myths being carried away from a common site of origin as early humankind migrated across the world.)
The rival twins theme incorporated into Mi'kmaq cosmology is identified as borrowed from the Iroquois. The trickster tales of the Huron and Seneca are identified as borrowed from their Algonquian neighbours. (See: Dictionary of Native American Literature edited by Andrew Wiget (1974, Page 71); reissued as Handbook of Native American Literature edited by Andrew Wiget (2013, Page 73).)
Rarely discussed is early Mi'kmaq knowledge of a number of European languages. Soon after European contact some Mi'kmaqs apparently acquired a limited knowledge of a number of European languages.
In his book The Building of Culture (1928) the ethnologist and historian Roland Dixon showed numerous identical mummification practices existed between the ancient Egyptians (21st dynasty, circa between 1090 BCE and 945 BCE) and the remote Torres Strait Islanders of the 19th-century. However, there were also numerous differences. (The island cluster of the Torres Strait lies in a 200 kilometre wide passage of water between the southern coast of New guinea and the tip of the Cape of York (Queensland, Australia).) Naturally cultural borrowing (diffusion) was out of the question (except for some extreme diffusionists). A nineteenth-century paper by John Murdoch ("On the Siberian Origin of Some customs of the Western Eskimos." (The American Anthropologist, Volume 1, Oct., 1888, Pages 325-336)) holds that use of tobacco, fishing nets, and the bird-bolas amongst the Western Inuit originated from contact with Siberia. Such offers the prospect of a pathway for other cultural borrowing. Tobacco use literally diffused around the world within 100 years of the European discovery of the American continent. In his book The Beothucks or Red Indians (1915) James Howley held that the spear design (for killing seals), and also the technique for such, used by the Beothuks of Newfoundland was borrowed from the Eskimos (Inuit). (The last Beothuk died in captivity in 1829.) The antiquity is unknown for certain but it is now generally agreed that they were relatively recent migrants to the Americas from northeast Asia, spreading across the top of North America from west to east over the course of the past 6,000 years. (The Eskimo-Aleut migration circa 4,000 BCE populated (for the first time) the Arctic coastal zone of North America. Another migration took place more recently, circa 1,000 CE.) At Blue Hill Bay on the central Maine coast at least one stone tool found there that was made from non-native stone is made in the style of the Dorset Culture, a prehistoric Eskimo (Inuit) people. It is evidence that before European contact, the Indians living in the coastal Maine area had long-distance relationships through trade with people living in the far north.
Chinese and Japanese coins, as well as Taoist temple talismans, have been found in British Columbia, the oldest of the Chinese coins dating from 1125 CE. The Japanese coins pre-date European contact. They are obviously items brought across the Bering Strait.
Native American origin stories make no mention of a historic arduous crossing, such as the crossing of the Bering Strait, and then a journey southwards away from an ice-bound northern land. (On the basis of their myths they tend to believe they were always in the American continent.) However, we are asked to believe that they have successfully kept a 14,000 year old memory of a bear constellation. It is obvious that among Native American groups their stories and lore do not primarily serve an historical purpose. (Another theory holds that the first Americans may have used boats to make the crossing into North America. There is a growing viewpoint that the first people to enter the American continent were skilled sailors who came by boat circa 11,000 BCE, island hopping from Siberia all the way to the coast of California.) In their recent paper ("Linguistic Origins of Native Americans." in Scientific American, November, 1992, Pages 94-99) Joseph Greenberg and Merritt Ruhlen propose, on linguistic grounds, 3 major Asian migrations; the first circa 12,000 BCE (Amerind speakers i.e., Maya); the second somewhat later (Na-Dene speakers i.e., Apache); and the third circa 3000-2000 BCE (Eskimo-Aleut speakers i.e., Inuit). The colonisation of the Americas was more recently discussed in "The First Americans." by Heather Pringle (Scientific American, November, 2011, Pages 20-27).

If we uncritically maintain that the Big Dipper bear constellation entered the American continent with a wave of immigrants circa 14,000 years ago then we would have to argue similarly for the dragon myth and many others. (Also, there is no one homogenous Native American mythology.) It is well understood that storytellers borrow from storytellers. It is often impossible to determine how folktales and stories originated (i.e., where and when) and how they have migrated and been adopted elsewhere. But the transference has to be done through individual story tellers. The term migration is used when we can distinguish the bearers of the culture and the term diffusion is used when we cannot. European scholars have long believed that Glooscap (Glooskap), the legendary cultural hero of the Mi'kmaqs who appears in a numbers of their tales, is ultimately European in origin. (For Stansbury Hagar the Mi'kmaq hero Glooscap was but one version of the world-wide story of of the solar hero (See: "Weather and the Seasons in Micmac Mythology." (The Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 10, April-June, 1897, Number 37, Pages 101-105).)
"The indigenous stories with the most similarity to European fairy tales are those that depict the adventures of an unprepossessing central character, often an orphan, who lives on the margins of a community, sometimes with a grandparent. Through his or her personal efforts and talents, the assistance of spiritual beings or forces, or luck, the protagonist attains power, prestige, and occasionally material wealth." ... Stith Thompson (Tales of the North American Indian (1929)) concluded that ""The Seven-Headed Dragon" from an Ojibwe source, an Assiniboine version of "John the Bear,"' a Zuni retelling of ''Cinderella,'' and a text of the ''The Clever Numskull'' from the Micmac" were tales borrowedfrom Europeans and deftly included into Native American narrative repertoires. (Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art edited by Charlie McCormick and Kim White (Volume E-L, 2011, Page 61).) Also, the Zuni also had a folktale about a kitten (The Little Kitten). (See; The American Journal of Folklore, Volume 31, 1918, Pages 452-453.) The cat is a late introduction to the American continent. It was introduced by Europeans. The domestic cat is thought to have come from the African Wild Cat. The breed was domesticated in ancient Egypt to control vermin which harmed crops and caused diseases. During the 15th/16th centuries CE cats were used on European ships on voyages of discovery to control rodent population and disease. When Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas cats from his ships were left behind and flourished. Domestic cats accompanied the Pilgrim Fathers on ships such as the Mayflower, and also later settlers to North America. It is now considered inappropriate to compare American Indian narrative traditions to Europeanfairy tales. However, the Mi’kmaq had French-Canadian sources to draw on for European folk-tales, and mingle their native tales with. (Note: The normal form of "The Dragon-Slayer" tale likely emerged in France.)
For Frank Cushing telling a folktale (The Cock's Whiskers) from Thomas Crane's Italian collection to the Zuni and it quickly (within a year) becoming adapted by them see, The Folktale by Stith Thompson (1977, Pages 222-223). Thompson writes: "It had become so thoroughly adapted to Zuni ceremonialism, however, that its original cumulative nature was hardly recognizable." See also: Italian Popular Tales by Thomas Crane (1885). The tale is known only in a few locations in Europe and amongst the Zuni of New Mexico.
It is difficult to know how much influence the pioneering American anthropologist, Daniel Brinton (1837-1899) may have had. Brinton was an advocate of solar mythology. The European (French) story of John, the son of the bear (Bear Son tale), faithfully appears in the tales of a number of Native American tribes. (The European Bear Son tales have also passed into the folk tales of the French, Spanish, and English speaking areas of the Caribbean.) This European story obviously was not carried by immigrants across a land bridge circa 14,000 years ago. The same may be said of the Cinderella story. (The "Cinderella" story (or rather a variation of it) was told by a Mi'kmaq storyteller circa 1870 and is obviously a reworking from some French-Canadian storyteller. Even the Bear Son tale appears in Mi'kmaq story telling.) (A useful publication is: European Tales Among the North American Indians by Stith Thompson (1919).) See also, Tales of the North American Indians by Stith Thompson (1929, Page xx): "Not fewer than fifty well-known European tales are current among the American Indians." some were told in their entirety, and parts of others were incorporated in existing Indian tales. Also see, The Folktale by Stith Thompson (1977). In his book The Algonquin Legends of New England (1884) Charles Leland frequently makes reference to French influence on Indian stories. The Americanist Earl Count identified that the EarthDiver stories of the Native Americans had basic similarities to the Earth-Diver stories told by European nations; especially the Slavs. The presence of the Swastika in North America is able to be convincingly explained as a separate parallel development. (Another point of caution with Native America beliefs relate to Creation and Flood legends. This class of myths provides a very useful and important way to assess the issues of European influences.)
The Mi'kmaq story of "The Orchard Keeper" (recorded by Silas Rand; see his: Legends of the Micmac, Volume 2, Pages 242-251) has been considered a French tale (or French influenced tale).
For an example of Hagar's capacity for error with Mi'kmaq myths see: "Angels of Light: A Mi'kmaq Myth in a New Archê." by Jennifer Reid (Canadian Journal of Native Studies, Volume 25, Number 2, 2005, Pages 463-475). Also: Mi'kmaw Myth: Finding Kluskap by Jennifer Reid (2011). Both involve the study of the Mi'kmaw mythic hero Kluskap, and of a ritual space that is the site of an annual Mi'kmaw mission to St. Anne. The author (an academic who has spent time with the Mi'kmaq) suggests that Kluskap myths are linked to a series of 17th-century treaties negotiated with the British, and that both the treaties and Kluskap are enmeshed in a distinctive structure of Catholic ritual through which Mi'kmaw peoples express a unique critique of modernity. The association between the Mi'kmaqs and the Roman Catholic Church dates to the earliest fur trade alliances at the turn of the 17th-century. There are parallels between Glooskap (Kluskap / Koluskap) and St. Anne (Mary's Mother). Hagar (1897), no doubt utilising a range of already established interpretive categories, believed Kluskap was a sky god and an example of a universal solar hero.

Other studies for assessing the issues of European influences (with identified limitations) are: (1) Mythology of the Thompson Indians by James Teit (1912) (edited by Lucy Kramer) which has a section of "Tales Based on European Folklore"; (2) the further selection James Teit in 1916 in Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 29, Pages 301-329; and (3) the short study "Romance Folk-lore Among American Indians" that Franz Boas contributed to his book Race, Language and Culture (1940, Pages 517-524). A more recent study worthy of note is: "The Bible in Western Indian Mythology." by Jarold Ramsey in Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 90, 1977, Pages 442-454. For an interesting view of the diffusion of Native American mythology before European contact see: "The Growth of Indian Mythologies." by Franz Boas (The Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume IX, January-March, 1896, Number XXXIL, Pages 1-11).
A relevant but overlooked article is "The Migration of Folktales: Four Channels to the Americas." by Francis Utley (a specialist in folklore and linguistics) (Current Anthropology, Volume 15, Number 1, March, 1974, Pages 5-27 (then additional comments pages)). The late Francis Utley was Professor of English at Ohio State University, He received his PhD in 1936 from Harvard University (Department of Medieval English Studies). He was also a Fellow of the American Folklore Society. In his article he identifies 4 major routes through which culture, including folklore, has traveled or might have traveled into the American continent. The 4 routes identified are: (1) from Northeast Asia across the Bering Strait; (2) from Southeast Asia across the Pacific islands; (3) from Europe across the North Atlantic; and (4) from Africa across the South Atlantic (due to the slave trade in South America). (See: "African Tales Among the North American Indians." by Alan Dundes (Southern Folklore Quarterly, Volume 29, 1965, Pages 207-219). The essay was also reprinted in the book, Mother Wit from the Laughing Barrel edited by Alan Dundes (1973, Reprinted 1981).) Regarding early European influence. The English were established in the north; the French and the Spanish were established in the south. The Spanish in the southwest remained undisturbed throughout the 18th-century. Influence was exerted through the Spanish missions. The French military (French garrisons) and French traders also exerted influence. The French were well established in lower Louisiana. At one time the Choctaw nation was virtually reduced to a French protectorate. A French trading post was established on the Arkansas but eventually advance to western Pennsylvania.
"The mythic figure of the bear is ubiquitous in Christian mythology. The are countless numbers of saints known by a name based on the French or Latin words for bear - Saint Ours, Saint Ursin, and so forth - as well as names based on other similar etymological associations (such as Saint Bernard - from bär, a Germanic source, and -art, the Celtic name for this animal) (Christianity: The Origins of a Pagan Religion by Philippe Walter (2003, Page 176))."
Hagar lacked the means to date tales. A lot of European folklore and beliefs were introduced to Native Americans (especially in Canada) by the early French settlers. Amongst the early French settlers were singer, fiddlers, dancers, and storytellers. The Mi'kmaq relationship with the early French colonists in Canada's Maritime provinces was very close and intermarriage was common. In the early 17th-century several hundred French settlers came to settle in the Maritime Region. (According to the work of Genevieve Massignon the original French farmer settlers who called themselves Acadians came from the region around the city of Loudun. Effectively they all knew each other and were often related to each other.) During the 17th-century many Mi'kmaq children attended French schools on a daily basis. The Mi'kmaqs also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. (The baptism of the aged Chief Membertou and his family at Port Royal, in 1610, was followed in a few years by the conversion, chiefly under Recollet friars, of the whole Mi'kmaq tribe to Roman Catholicism.) By the early 18th-century the British found it difficult to distinguish the French Acadians from the Mi'kmaqs. The French Acadian and the Mi'kmaq population were inseparable. Partly in reaction to Jesuit resistance to sexual relations between Indians and French settlers, the French Crown began a policy in 1668 of encouraging intermarriages. In his recent history of the Mi'kmaq, the historian Harald Prins notes that given the close interaction and relationships between the French settlers and Mi'kmaq in Acadia, and the fact that their communities were so small in number, the result of the policy of the French Crown (began in 1668) of encouraging intermarriages between Indians and French settlers was that few of the local Mi'kmaq and French Acadians would have been "full-bloods" by the mid-1700s. (See: The Mi'kmaq Resistance, Accommodation, and Cultural Survival by Harald Prins (1996), Page 68.) The French Acadian influence was simply enormous. Currently most Mi'kmaqs have French surnames.
There were efforts made in the 20th-century to recover French narrative tradition in North America. (The early French settlers of Canada came in the 17th-century. Quebec was the core of French presence in North America.) The selfproclaimed pioneer ethnographer/folklorist Marius Barbeau (1883-1969) - the founder of professional folklore studies in Canada - recognised that many French Canadian folktales had been assimilated into Native American folklore. (Charles Marius Barbeau is known more commonly as Marius Barbeau.) He obtained a degree in Anthropology at Oxford University. In 1911, as an anthropologist, Barbeau joined the National Museum, (at that time part of the Geological Survey of Canada), and remained until his retirement in 1949. Marius Barbeau frequently lectured on anthropology and folklore (in a structured and comprehensive manner) at at the University of Montreal and at Laval University. Barbeau and others obtained from French communities or individuals within those communities. Also collected were folktales from Native American communities or individuals within those communities. During his work for the National Museum of Canada he built up the French-Canadian archives in the National Museum by collecting (mostly by fieldwork) some 400 French folk tales, aside from other material (such as artifacts and songs). (See: Tradition and Modernity: The Cultural Work of Marius Barbeau by Andrew Nurse (Unpublished PhD thesis, Queen's University, 1997).) Since Barbeau's original field work folklorists have collected literally thousands of Canadian French tales. His student, Luc Lacourcière, a noted folklorist, founded the Archives de folklore et d'ethnologie at the University of Laval (Quebec City). (The Archives of Folklore and Ethnology, founded in 1944 by Luc Lacourcière contains records and material relating to historical French-Canadian customs, legends and tales, songs and music, crafts, costume, etc. They are mainly based on field surveys.) Interestingly, before the decay of

oral narrative tradition there were both male and female narrators/storytellers. See: The Two Traditions: The Art of Storytelling Amongst French Newfoundlanders by Gerald Thomas (1993, Pages 15-16). Emphasis has also been given to to understanding how folklore functioned amongst those who used it. Hagar simply collected folklore/mythology.

The French-Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau (1883-1969) relates that in 1914, during the course of a meeting of the Anthropological Association, that Franz Boas at Columbia University told him that Native American folktales as far south as Mexico could only be French in origin and were likely transferred through the influence of French Canadians. See: "Mythology and Folk-Tales of the North American Indians." Franz Boas (The Journal of American Folklore, Volume 27, Number 106, October-December, 1914, Pages 374-410).) (See also: "Notes on Mexican Folklore." by Franz Boas (Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 25, 1912, Pages 204-260).) The anthropologists Franz Boas, Elsie Parsons, and Aurelio Espinosa held the view that except for the Huichol people, and possibly the Cora people (both groups residing in Western Central Mexico), the folklore of all Native American groups studied in Mexico is primarily European in type (i.e., European in origin). The anthropologist Ralph Beals also commented on the scarcity of tales among many Mexican Indian groups. (See: "Comparative Notes on New Mexican and Mexican Spanish Folktales." by Aurelio Espinosa (Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 27, 1914, Pages 211-231; and also "Problems of Mexican Indian Folklore." by Ralph Beals (Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 56, Number 219, Jan.-Mar., 1943, Pages 8-16.) The anthropologist Gladys Reichard wrote in her Introduction to An Analysis of Coeur D'Alene Indian Myths (1947) that the Coeur d'Alene Indian mythology "has many evidences of white influence." This European influence included French Canadian fur traders. (The Coeur d'Alene traditionally lived in what would become the Panhandle region of Idaho.) The bear constellation of the Coeur d'Alene Indian mythology was a grizzly bear. The Coeur d'Alene lived in the Plateau country of northern Idaho and were well familiar with grizzly bears.
The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales by Maria Tatar (1987, Page 42): "The critic who undertakes the task of interpreting a tale without first studying the relation of a folkloric text to its variant forms may find himself drawing generalizations based on false premises. The Prairie Band Potawatomi may be able to state with impunity that the folktale hero P'teejah is a full-blooded American Indian boy, but the folklorist who fails to recognize that P'teejah is the French folk hero Petit Jean masquerading as an Indian will find himself drawing embarrassing conclusions about Amerindian culture."
The French presence in Canada began in 1534, but permanent settlement did not begin until Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec City in 1608. The French eventually carved out an enormous territory stretching as far east as the Maritime provinces and south to the Gulf of Mexico. After France's defeat in the French and Indian Wars, Britain won control of New France, formalized by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Under British rule, the French Canadians remained a distinct cultural group. The preservation of their cultural identity was aided by the influence of the Catholic Church, the tendency to marry within their own community, and the tradition of having large families. When the Dominion of Canada was established in 1867, French Canadians accounted for one-third of the new country's population. The French-Canadian folklore tradition was strengthened by colonial laws that made it crucial for French Canadians to transmit their culture orally across the generations. Popular characters in French Canadian folklore include a hero figure named Ti-Jean (short for petit Jean, or Little John) and a hunter named Dalbec.
"Important Metis Mythological Figures. Since the Metis are primarily of mixed French, Cree and Ojibway origins, it is not surprising that their folklore contains many traditional stories and mythological figures from all three of these traditions. Here are some common characters from Metis stories: Nenabush, Wisakechak or Ti-Jean. These are benevolent trickster/transformer figures that have largely merged together in traditional Metis folktales. Nenabush is the Michif pronunciation of the Ojibway hero Nanabozho and is the most common name given to the Metis hero; Wisakechak is a traditional Cree trickster; and Ti-Jean is a Michif pronunciation of the French Canadian folk hero Petit Jean ("Little John.") Although the original Petit Jean is quite different in character from the two Algonquian heroes Nanabozho and Wisakechak, Metis storytellers tend to use the three characters interchangeably, and the same story can be heard ascribed to any of these three trickster figures. Nenabush is pronounced similar to nay-nah-boosh, Wisakechak is pronounced similar to wee-sahkay-chock (and is often called "Whiskey-Jack" by English speaking Metis people), and Ti-Jean is pronounced tee-zhawn."

Another popular figure in early French Canadian folklore was Dalbec the hunter. Stories involved him with bears, but not as far as I know, bear hunting.
Due to the French settlers calling the general region of the Maritime Provinces by the name "Acadia" (l'Acadie), possibly from a Mi'kmaq word meaning "fertile land", the French settlers there became known as Acadians. (The establishment of fur posts in 1603-1608 by Samuel de Champlain marked the beginning of Acadia. After the capture of Acadia by Britishcolonial forces in 1710 it became known as Nova Scotia. At that time there was a population of some 2000 French farmers and fishermen.) There was a 100 year period of uninterrupted close relationships and harmony between the Mi'kmaq and French Accadians.
"About 10,000 aboriginals lived in what is now Atlantic Canada before European contact. This included about 1,000 Beothucks who dwelt in Newfoundland, but few if any lived along the south coast by 1670. Epidemic diseases substantially reduced the number of Algonkian-speaking Mi’kmaq long before the early seventeenth century when the French established their first small trading posts in Acadia. As early as 1611, Father Pierre Biard, sj recorded increasing mortality among the Mi’kmaq inhabitants of Nova Scotia. Population densities may have been relatively high among these seminomadic hunters of the sea as well as of the eastern boreal forests, but by 1670 they probably numbered about 2,000 after more than a century and a half of contact with European fishermen and traders. The decline continued into the second quarter of the eighteenth century. A 1705 estimate claimed there were two French for every Indian in Acadia ...." (In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670-1730 by James Pritchard (2004, Page 5).)
"The astonishing population growth of Acadian colonists was due to unique conditions that prevailed in the colony, where sweeping epidemics were unknown and infant mortality was low. Population growth, however, did not occur in the isolation once thought to be characteristic of the Acadians. Some growth may have been due to Acadian absorption of Mi’kmaqs. Abbé Pierre Maillard claimed that racial intermixing had proceeded so far by 1753 that in fifty years it would be impossible to distinguish Amerindian from French in Acadia." (In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670-1730 by James Pritchard (2004,Page 36).)
In 1755 the "Great Expulsion" ("Great Upheaval") occurred. In 1755, just prior to (or at) the outbreak of the British-French war (the Seven Year's War), the British deported all the French Acadian population of Nova Scotia (including their Mi'kmaq families), at least 10,000 persons, for their refusal to take an oath of allegiance to Britain (and fight against the French). Of the estimated 10,000 Acadians in 1755 about 8,000 were deported. Thousands more Acadians were killed for resisting deportation and many Acadian homes were burnt. The Acadians had wanted to keep a neutral position regarding the constant wars between Britain and France. They were initially dispersed along the southern Atlantic seaboard. mostly amongst the 13 colonies, and lived a destitute existence. Many Acadians eventually settled in Louisiana which was still under French rule), becoming known as the Cajun culture ("Cajuns"). (The name Cajun is derived from Acadia.) In 1763, after 7 years of war, the British Government gained effective control and after 1764 the proscription against their presence was lifted. Initially only a small number of Acadians were allowed to return to Acadia. Eventually many Acadians returned to Nova Scotia and were resettled on inferior land at the periphery of the settlements established by British settlers. British settlers now occupied much of their former homeland. (For the duration of the war the area had remained largely unoccupied. At the end of the war the British encouraged British settlement of the area.) Most of the Acadians who returned to Nova Scotia were those displaced Acadians who had settled in Louisiana.
Despite this, some Acadians and Mi'kmaqs went to Newfoundland and, due to lack of suitable government systems, remained there. There were both French and German settlers in Nova Scotia.
In the west the marriages between early French settlers with Native Americans created the Métis (a French term) of western Canada. The Métis were the result of marriages of Woodland Cree, Ojibway, Saulteaux, and Menominee Native Americans to French settlers circa the mid-seventeenth century. The Métis homeland consisted of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories. It also included parts of the

northern United States (specifically Montana, North Dakota, and northwest Minnesota. (The Hudson's Bay post in the northwest USA was also another likely source of influence.)
The early Spanish conquerors also were influential in passing European folklore and beliefs to Native Americans (especially in Mexico). Dispersion of European tales was likely from the southeast through the trade routes. Early Christian missionaries introduced some 50 biblical themes into Indian beliefs across the USA. Influences for the post-Columbian introduction of some European star lore and constellations to the Native Americans include: missionaries, explorers, traders (including coureurs de bois ("wood rangers") who were free traders who accompanied the Native Americans on their hunting expeditions), colonists, trappers, captives, military alliances, inter-marriage, tribal relocations (migrations and reservations), Indian schools, and ethnologists (exchanging tales). Of these early cultural contacts the key ones were French commercial connections and frequent intermarriage with Native Americans (i.e., Canada), and Spanish military and religious contact (i.e., the mission system) (in Mexico and the Southwest USA). By the 17th-century European colonists had made direct contact with most Native American communities. Some assimilation had also taken place by this early date. Fascinatingly, it was apparently common for early European maps of North America to call it America Septentrional (= Great Bear constellation (Big Dipper)). It is not too difficult to expect that some European constellation beliefs were transmitted to Native Americans after Columbus.
It is particularly among Native American lore that the 4 stars of the 'dipper' are seen as a bear being pursued by the 3 stars of the 'dipper handle.' This is an idea comparable to the Greek constellation myth of Callistro being pursued by hounds.
In his Introduction to Cushing's book Zuni Folk Tales (1901, Pages xvi-xvii) the noted ethnologist John Powell (1834-1902) relates how a Seneca Indian, the nephew of a Seneca shaman, was taken by the Spaniards to Europe and educated as apriest. On his return the nephew related numerous Bible stories to his uncle who proceeded to compound a number of thesewith Seneca folk tales and then establish these new stories among the Seneca. (In his early article "Micmac Customs and Traditions" (American Anthropologist, January, 1895, Volume 8, Number 4, Pages 31-42), Stansbury Hagar stated it was his purpose to make a record of the rapidly disappearing Micmac stories in order that they could be preserved. In this article he narrates a Micmac folktale about the water fairies, and notes its resemblance to a Chippewa legend ("The Magic Circle in the Prairie"), and even to the biblical story of Moses and the Red Sea crossing.)
Comparison of key features of Seneca and Mi'kmaq bear constellation stories. The variation in completeness is likely due to different gathering techniques.
Seneca (per Arthur Parker, 1923). The Seneca are indigenous Iroquoian-speaking people native to North America who historically lived south of Lake Ontario. (The Seneca nation was one of the original members of the Iroquois League.)
Mi'kmaq (per Stansbury Hagar, 1900). The Mi’kmaq are indigenous to Canada's Maritime Provinces and the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec.
7 hunters (brothers). 7 hunters (Mi'kmaq as brothers).
Bear pursued as prey. Bear pursued as prey.
Bear blood staining foliage = Autumn. Bear blood staining foliage = Autumn.
Bear revives annually and is hunted again. Bear revives annually and is hunted again.
The differences between European and Native American bear constellations does not pose a problem for late borrowing. Europe and North America have 2 different bear constellations. The European bear constellation is inherited from ancient Greece. The Greek bear constellation has a long tail (but modern bears have no tail). With the Greek sky-bear the stars of the Big Dipper form the hindquarters and tail of the bear with other forming the head and paws. The Native American bear constellation has no tail. In most North American folk-tales the 4 stars comprising the cup of the Big Dipper is the bear and the 3 stars comprising the handle of the Big Dipper are warriors chasing the bear (around the pole). However, it has been recognised that the wide familiarity of the seven Big Dipper stars would tend to make them readily susceptible to the influence of European star lore. For several examples of this see The Arctic Sky by John MacDonald (1998). The later movements of Native American tribes would have assisted in the diffusion of these beliefs. One of the interesting effects of post-colonization was that Native Americans borrowed (copied) some of each other's tribal dress as they were forced into closer contact. They also adapted some articles of European clothing to their own style. (The Mi'kmaq early adopted forms of European dress.)
The astronomer Ed. Krupp pointed out (personal communication, 28 April, 2006): "I am not aware of any European tradition, including French, that incorporates a myth that parallels the content and meaning of the Micmac tale. In fact, the French seem to have taken a different and typically European turn with the Big Dipper and referenced the Bear only because they also inherited the Classical tradition." This comment by Ed. Krupp is, as always, astute and to the point, and requires answering. More so since the European (Greek) bear myth involves both the Great Bear and the Little Bear. (Only a few tribes of Native Americans reflect this scenario.) I can only offer, without the benefit of having made a detailed examination, that the Mi'kmaq bear tale recorded by Stansbury Hagar over 100 years ago is likely a story constructed out of Mi'kmaq seasonal lore and post-contact European star lore. Hagar relates a very short story. A legitimate question is whether it is a "full version" or a "condensed" (i.e., truncated) version that he was told. It has been noted that the Mi'kmaq tale accurately portrays the relative positions as well as their appearance and disappearance in the sky at 45 degrees north latitude (in Nova

Scotia). However, the establishment of these details would not be difficult in post-Columbian America. The Mi'kmaq have one of the longest records of interaction with Europeans and North American settlers of any North American Native Indian people. Hagar really doesn't tell us anything detailed about his informants (consultants). We appear to have no information about them - we really know nothing about them regarding their attainments, or status in the tribe. Nothing was done by Hagar to establish the age of the story or its genuineness as a product of Mi'kmaq thought. In his book The Algonquin Legends of New England (1884) Charles Leland wrote: "I have often heard French fairy tales and Aesop's fables Indianized to perfection...." (In European star lore Boötes and his dogs were in perpetual pursuit of the Great Bear constellation.) It is also relevant that Stansbury Hagar had strong preconceptions. His misguided attempts to reconstruct the constellations of the Inca were made on his erroneous assumption that they were identical to Greek and Roman constellations.
The Alabama tribe of the southeastern USA possess a seasonal myth involving the Big Dipper stars as a boat (i.e., celestial canoe with occupants). (The Alabama Indians lived along the Alabama River in the State of Alabama.) In some ways it has similarities with the Mi'kmaq seasonal myth involving the Big Dipper stars as a bear. Also, one version of the Alabama myth holds the Big Dipper stars are a large canoe and a small canoe. The work of ethnologists to recover Native American folklore from the southeastern region of the USA began in the late 1800s. By this time the Alabama had sustained a long history of European contact. In contrast, Blackfoot lore had the 7 stars of the Big Dipper 'Ishkitsi-kammika' comprising 6 legendary brothers and their sister. (See: The Blackfoot Papers: Volume 3, by Adolf Hungry-Wolf, 2006, Page 128.)
There is a paucity of material dealing with the critical analysis of storytelling practices of the Mi'kmaq. One source is Micmac Documented Oral Accounts as Historical Source Material by Scott McKeen (unpublished MA Thesis, 1995). In it he points out that Mi'kmaq storytelling was flexible and "freeform." The storyteller could easily (and did) incorporate changes to suit the audience. He also states that the form of Mi'kmaq stories did change over time.
Without reliable sources from the early period of European contact with Native Americans it is very difficult to decide just how much a story may have been influenced by European beliefs. The first Jesuits, the Frenchmen Pierre Biard and Ennemond Massé, set foot in what is now Canada, at Port Royal, May 22, 1611. They went first to the Mi'kmaqs, next to the Montagnais, then to the Algonquins. Stansbury Hagar acknowledges that Native American legends of the "Big Dipper" as a celestial bear is given most fully by the Mi'kmaqs. The earliest European reference to a Native American belief in the starsof Ursa Major representing a celestial bear is by the Recollect Order missionary Father Chréstien Le Clerq in Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie (1691). (The Recollect Order began work on the St. Lawrence in 1615 and the Jesuits joined them in 1626. Father Chréstien Le Clerq was a missionary to the Mi'kmaq on the Gaspé peninsula in the mid 1600s. The Gaspesienswere a Mi'kmaq band inhabiting the area of Cape Gaspé, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River.) In the Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie book he relates that, in 1677, he heard a Mi'kmaq tale of the "Big Dipper" being a celestial bear during his explorations in North America.) I have never seen anybody reproduce the relevant passage(s) from the book and discuss it. (See Appendix 3 below.) The possibility of miscommunication and contamination from the interplay between the priest(s), his informants, and any interpreter(s) during the process of questioning and discussion to acquire information exists. The Native Americans had no written language. Native American oral traditions were written and modified by non-Indians. Indeed, the definition of primary reference appears to include Native American oral traditions that were written down by non-Indians. Native Americans were also forced to learn English. Also, there is some degree of confusion amongst ethnologists and authors regarding which Native American peoples (including Inuit) actually identified the seven (or four) stars of the Big Dipper asterisms as a bear (or some other figure).
See the important discussion comprising Chapter Two, "Jesuit Biases in Interpreting Non-Christian Cultures" (Pages 47-80) in The Jesuit Mission to New France: A New Interpretation in the Light of the Earlier Jesuit Experience in France by Takeo Abé (2011). Takeo Abé notes that several critics of the Jesuit Relations (= Annual Reports) have not been able to offer very effective examples of Jesuit bias. However, it is clear the recorded material, including anthropological/ethnological material, has no relationship to modern anthropological/ethnological reports. Abé, page 47: "Historians today agree that the Jesuit interpretation of foreign nations was biased and needs to be treated carefully." Abé, page 78: "The written observations represent what image and idea the missionaries wished their readers to hold about the indigenous people and their culture, not what they actually were." Abé, page 79: "The Euro-Christian cultural framework employed for interpreting nativeculture was first restricted by the cultural framework of priests, and then further distorted by the personal priorities of reporters. ... Second, the Euro-Christian biases and the observational or interpretive mistakes can be attributed to the missionaries failure to understand the native culture in a native way, and in their misconception that they understood it well."
In the few details set down by Father Chréstien Le Clerq in Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie (1691) it is not self-evident that the pursuit theme in connection with "this bear" means the Great Bear. No explicit mention is made of any pursuit of the Great Bear. The pursuit might well be connected with the Little Bear as the Three Hunters in a Canoe are stars belonging to that constellation. (Circling behaviour around the Great Bear is not mentioned.) Yet in Stars of the First People by Dorcas Miller (1997) the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor) is basically identified with Three Hunters in a Canoe circling the Great Bear. (Though Father Chréstien Le Clerq is mentioned the interpretation is likely based on the much later account by Stansbury Hagar.) It is obvious from the brief accounts of the missionaries Father Chréstien Le Clerq and the Reverend Silas Rand that the Mi'kmaq, at least by 1677, had called the stars of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor the Big Bear and the Little Bear respectively, and the Milky Way was also called the Milky Way. Just as the European celestial bear is not the hunter but the hunted (i.e., Boötes the Bear-keeper/Bear-guard chases both the Big Bear and the Little Bear) in the Mi'kmaq myth the bear is not the hunter but, at least with one bear constellation, is the hunted.

In their book The Micmac Indians of Eastern Canada (1955, page 98), authors Wilson Wallis and Ruth Wallis write" "The stars are called aklo we'djiwi. Many of them have names, for example, ohtadab'an, morning star seen in the east. The North Star, called go'gwadane glo'go wetc, meaning "north," was a guide to travellers. The constellation of the Great Dipper is called mu'in (bear), or adjalkatc. In the seventeenth century it was called mouhinne, and mouhinchiche was the Little Bear or Little Dipper. The three guards of the North Star are three Indians in a canoe who embarked to catch the bear but have not done so yet."
In his Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie (1691, Page 103) Father Chréstien Le Clerq records that he found that the Mi'kmaq tribes at Miramichi (near present-day Chatham) revered and worshipped the cross (or an emblem very similar to a cross) in connection with sun-worshipping rites. It appears they wore the cross on their clothes, carried a cross next to their skin, put it in their cabins, took it with them on their journeys, and had cemeteries with these crosses. This degree of of rather obvious European influence seems hardly surprising. (Some Mi'kmaq claimed their use of the cross was pre-contact.) "By the 1670s the Mi'kmaq of the Gaspé Peninsula and Acadia were quite familiar with Catholic missionaries - since the colonies founding in 1604" (Paper Talk: a history of libraries, print culture, and Aboriginal peoples in Canada before 1960 by Brendan Edwards (2005, Page 30)).
The noted anthropologist James Mooney (1861-1921), an ethnographer with the Bureau of American Ethnology from 1885 to 1921, in his review of Legends of the Micmacs by Silas Rand (1894) wrote (The American Anthropologist, Volume 7, Number 1, January, 1894, Pages 118-120): "[T]heir mental life has been strongly influenced by three centuries of contact with French Catholic priests and fishermen, a fact which becomes apparent as soon as we examine the legends. As a contribution to aboriginal mythology the book is a grievous disappointment. ... The book shows ... an utter inability to to discriminate between the true and the false, and a complete ignorance of the aboriginal range of thought with the result that we find the Arabian Nights and Grimm's Fairy Tales given as Micmac legends. The same mistake was made by Father Petitot [a missionary], who publishes the story of "Brother Lustig" as one of a volume of Indian tales, although it contains not a single aboriginal idea. [It is from Household Tales by the Brothers Grimm.] ... Indians are fond of stories, and readily learn and repeat anything in that line that strikes their fancy. They have been learning fairy stories from French voyageurs and Highland trappers for at least two centuries, and have had descriptions of heaven and hell, of angels and devils for as long a period. There is probably today not a tribe on the continent that has not assimilated some of this material .... The author himself, in his introduction, unconsciously shows us how these "white man stories" come among the Indians and how direct is the line of descent. His first instructor in the language was a Frenchman "who had lived among the Indians nearly all his life and could talk both French and Micmac very fluently." This man's father had been a French sailor who had drifted to Nova Scotia. "The son lived among the Micmacs, married one of them, and translated his name, Joseph Ruisseaux, into Joseph Brooks. He rendered me great service in mastering the Micmac language, and it was from his lips that I first learned of the wonderful legends that, after confirmation by many old Indians, I subsequently gave to the world." Then he goes on to tell us genuine Indian stories of Glooscap, of Kitpooseagunow, and other aboriginal gods and heroes, stories ... which are so mixed up with such tales as "The Prince and the Peasant Girl" and "The King's Daughter and the Man Servant" that it is hardly worth while to try to separate Micmac from missionary. ... Their legends delight in making tiny, insignificant things perform great wonders." Is it possible he never heard of Tom Thumb?" For comments on the gullibility of Silas Rand also see: "Glooscap Encounters Silas T. Rand." by Thomas Abler in Earth, Water, Air and Fire edited by David McNab (1998, Pages 127-141).
There are few reasons to believe that Father Chréstien Le Clerq engaged in meticulous research on the issues concerning Mi'kmaq belief and European influence. Hagar as an ethnologist lacks any details of field methodology. There is nothing to indicated that Hagar was a trained ethnologist. The method he used appears somewhat casual. It appears the celestial bear story was gathered whilst literally sitting around a number of Mi'kmaq camp-fires. Basically Hagar recorded in writing what he heard. It is not indicated that he had an assistant. Speeds of speaking and writing are not commented upon. There is no indication that the narration was interrupted. No quotes are used. It is not stated whether the stories were related in Mi’kmaq, French, or English. There is reason to believe they were given in English (= the translation was done by the informants/consultants). This being so, they were not obtained from native language. It is not clear whether Hagar understood Mi’kmaq or French. It is not clear that Abraham Glode spoke English. His son, Newell Glode certainly did. It is not clear whether Newell Glode translated for his father. Hence, it is indicated that Hagar did not face the problem of language. Whatever the original Mi’kmaq wording was is unknown. The claim of authenticity is based on the congenial relationship and the Mi’kmaqs being so-called "pure blood."
There is no reason to believe that the Reverend Silas Rand engaged in meticulous research on such. Rand lacked any formal schooling and it is recognised that he had limitations as a linguist.
At the "talking circles" or "kikwtoqiaknutmátimk" held at University College of Cape Breton in 1993 Patrick Johnson, a Mi'kmaq participant, remarked that in the early 1900s a number of Mi'kmaq informants (consultants) lied to ethnologists/anthropologists.
The origin of American anthropology/ethnology took place during the period between 1860 and 1890. During the 19thcentury in North America ethnology was a branch of anthropology which focused on recording the rapidly disappearing traditional cultures and beliefs of the Native Americans. Only after 1875 did American ethnologists conduct extensive fieldwork among living Native Americans. For decades they simply concentrated on collecting reminiscences of traditional cultural beliefs from a few elderly native informants (now called consultants) who: (1) claimed to remember what life had

been like in their youth, and/or (2) have knowledge of historic cultural beliefs and practices. However, as many Native American peoples were so radically altered by European influence by the time they were studied the (salvage) ethnologists were quite unable to verify what they were being told. Often they only spent limited time with their native informants (now called consultants) - a number of hours per day for up to several weeks. Evidence of significant cultural change was usually simply ignored. By the 20th-century the Mi'kmaq had lost nearly everything in their culture and a number of them actually became engaged in the process of borrowing from other Native American cultures - predominantly those located across the border in the USA. (An example of this is the late adoption by the Mi'kmaq of the feathered head-dress.) For a time even the Mi'kmaq language was at risk. It had largely ceased to be spoken and had been diluted by the French language.
The Mi'kmaq Indians were among the first Native Americans to have contact with Europeans. This contact began in the early 1500s with the exploration of Cape Breton by the French Bretons. (In 1497 the British seaman John Cabot discovered the northeast coast of America and also reported an abundance of cod on the Newfoundland Banks.) Virginia Miller (who taught at Dalhousie University) believes there was intensive contact between the Mi'kmaqs and Europeans throughout the 16th-century (and earlier). (See: "The Decline of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Population, A.D. 1600-1850." in Culture, Volume 2, Number 3, Pages 107-120.) Beginning in 1501, a variety of European fishing (Basque, Spanish, French, British, and Irish) boats (comprising some 10,000 fishermen) visited the Grand Banks every summer and returned to Europe in the autumn. A few crew members stayed over the winter, past their seasonal fishing tasks, to maintain the shore installations. A few persons even resided permanently as "liveyers." By 1519 these fishermen were coming ashore to dry their catch. (At the beginning of the 16th-century, news of the rich fishing waters off the coast of Nova Scotia spread quickly in Europe.) During the early contact period it was estimated that the Mi'kmaq population numbered approximately 4000 people. Estimates of Mi'kmaq numbers at this time vary and have been placed at 12,000 and substantially higher. According to A Gazetteer of the World ((Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain), Volume 5, 1856, Pages 224): "The Micmacs were once scattered over the entire extent of the eastern coast of Canada, of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and some of the adjacent islands - who now inhabit the SW coast of Nova Scotia and the interior of Newfoundland." (Following European contact there was a dramatic decline in population due to disease. In 1617, at the height of a disease epidemic (likely "chicken pox") caused by English slave raiders, large sections of the coast of New England were completely depopulated. In 1746 (or 1747) the French apparently spread typhus (or smallpox) to the Mi'kmaq Indians and this resulted in the death of up to 75% of the Mi'kmaq population. For example see: Pox Americana by Elizabeth Fenn (2003). Also, in 1738 smallpox killed half of the Cherokees. In 1779-1783 there was a massive smallpox epidemic from Mexico to Canada. (The introduction of alcohol also had a devastating cultural effect.) Many Mi'kmaq died during the crop failures of the 1840s and 1850s. The (largely potato) crop failure circa 1845 to 1848 was particularly devastating for the Mi'kmaqs. (See: "The Decline of Nova Scotia Micmac Population, A.D. 1600 - 1850. (Culture, 1982, Volume 2, Number 3, Pages 107-118).)) In 1830, New Brunswick (which separated from Nova Scotia in 1784) counted less than 1,000 Mi'kmaq, Ma;iseet, and Abenaki. (See: Canada's First Nations by Olive Dickason (1992).) According to the Census of 1871, the first opportunity for obtaining reliable knowledge of Mi'kmaq numbers, the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia numbered 1,666 persons.) The accuracy of Mi'kmaq population counts encounter the problem of the migratory habits of the Mi'kmaq and also the reluctance of many families to identify themselves as being Mi'kmaq. By the early 1600s missionaries had established solid contact with the Mi'kmaqs and were living amongst them. (An example is the Jesuit Pierre Biard who had a missionary station among the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia from 1611 to 1612. By this time there was also an immense amount of contact with fur traders and European fishing fleets.) However, the first Frenchman to master the Mi'kmaq language was the Catholic missionary Abbé Antoine-Simon Maillard. From 1735 to 1762 he lived with the Mi'kmaq Indians at Restigouche on the Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec. For the early influence of European Catholic beliefs upon Mi'kmaq religion see: "Culture Change in the Making: Some Examples of How a Catholic Missionary Influenced Mi'kmaq Religion." by Carlo Krieger (American Studies International, Volume 40, Number 2, June, 2002, Pages 37-56). Stansbury Hagar was one of the first ethnologists to collect Mi'kmaq tales. (At the time that Hagar carried out his work there was no established standard for anthropological/ethnological certification.) Hagar's work among the Mi'kmaq's was conducted in 1895, 1896, and 1897. For his several studies of Micmac lore Stansbury Hagar nearly always based himself in the town of Digby (Nova Scotia). At the time of these studies there were only 160 Mi'kmaq in Digby County. (The local Digby Weekly Courier (the local newspaper at this time) is perhaps a source of information regarding the visit by Stansbury Hagar. It was acknowledged as being a quality newspaper.)
Pre-contact and post-contact Native American population figures vary considerably. Also, since the 1960s there has been a move by some demographers to revise Native American population figures arbitrarily upwards. (Some modern estimates range from a population of 2 million to 10 million circa 1492.) The anthropologist Keith Cunningham (American Indians: Folk Tales and Legends (2001)) conservatively holds the pre-contact Native American population of North America (i.e., USA, Canada, and Alaska) was over 300,000 people but by 1850 had declined to less than 150,000 people, and by 1900 had declined to less than 16,000 people. Other estimates hold the pre-contact Native American population of the USA alone to be no more than 850,000. (The Indian Commissioner estimated that by 1880 only half the population of Native American were "full bloods.") According to one estimate circa 1600 CE (at the time of their first meeting with the French in 1603) the various bands of Algonquin Indians comprised a total population of about 6,000 persons. By 1768 the British estimated their population totalled 1,500. Other persons conservatively estimate a pre-contact Native American population of NorthAmerica of between 1.2 million - 2.6 million people. Whatever the population before 1492, by 1800 it was estimated thatonly about 600,000 Native Americans remained in present-day Canada and the USA. A series of pandemics was the mainreason for the decline in population figures. By 1900 this was estimated to have declined drastically, to about 350,000 people. (See the population discussion in 1491 by Charles Mann (2006).) A large number of Native American folktales and legends were collected by anthropologists and others during the period of drastic decline of Native American tribes. For a

relatively recent discussion of pre-contact population figures as high as approximately 50,000.000 see: "How Many People Were Here Before Columbus?" by Lewis Lord (U.S. News & World Report, August, 18-25, 1997, Pages 68-70). The author concludes that the pre-Columbian population figure is forever unknowable.
Two factors commonly overlooked are Native American dislocation (due to the consequences of the westward expansion of European settlers) and forced migration (forced (or agreed) removal and resettlement). By 1837 Andrew Jackson had removed 46,000 Native Americans from their land east of the Mississipi. Also, Indians of the eastern part of the USA who survived annihilation (e.g., the Mandans, and the Apalachee) were deculturised. Interestingly, the French and British from Canada had penetrated Mandan territory before the Lewis and Clark expedition starting May 1804. In the 18th-century Native American dislocation was significant. There were scattered groups of Indian refugees living in settlements, refugee camps, or with other tribes. Throughout the 18th-century (and 19th-century), through outcomes of warfare or migratory resettlement (forced or agreed), various Native American tribes merged with each other. In the early 1800s the Chicksaws were removed to share land with the Choctaws. The Natchez (after surviving a massacre) mixed with the Creeks. In the early 18th-century there was an attempt to settle the Seminoles among the Creeks. In the early 18th-century, displaced Indians such as the Creeks in Alabama wandered throughout the USA. About 2,500 joined the Cherokees. The Cherokees displaced from Georgia moved to other parts of the USA. Apart from this there were intertribal unities. The Ohio tribes, especially the Shawnees, kept active contacts with the Southern Indians (= the territory south of Ohio). In the late 1800s the so-called Indian Territory (comprising most of Oklahoma and Kansas) became the home of many diverse tribes due to the removal policy of the USA government. Approximately 90,000 Native Americans were moved there. Indian tribes living in close proximity included at least: Cherokee, Commanche, Chicksaw, Creek, Choctaw, Delawares, Iowas, Sauks, Kickapoos, Osage, and Poncas. (See: A History of the Indians of the United States by Angie Debo (1970).) Without discussing this aspect we have the observation: "Although a few people had unique interpretations of constellations, most shared their approach with other people. The groupings of people who shared beliefs make patterns that must reflect some sort of historical interaction." (Lankford, George. (2007). Reachable Stars: Patterns in the Ethnoastronomy of Eastern North America.(Page 34).)
The generic 'Thunderbird' (giant bird) tale is rather widespread amongst Indian tribes. (See "The Thunder-Bird amongst the Algonkins." by Alexander Chamberlain (The American Anthropologist, Volume III, January, 1890, Pages 51-54).) The particular details of a hunter being carried away by a giant bird to its nest and escaping by using the wings of a nestling, are identical among the Micmac, Cherokee, and the Menominee (in Wisconsin). (See: Thunderbirds by Mark Hall and Mark Rollins (2008).)
Perhaps the earliest European reference identifying that a Native American people named the key 7 stars (Big Dipper) of Ursa Major a "a bear" appears Key to the Languages of America by Roger Williams (1643). Roger Williams (circa 1600circa 1683/4) was a British-born Baptist theologian who several times resided in North America. (He was the founder of the city of Providence, Rhode Island in New England). His (now very rare) first book Key to the Languages of America was written during a return voyage to England (and published in London). He briefly remarks that just as the Greeks and others call the 7 stars of the Big Dipper asterism the bear so do the Narragansett tribe of New England call these stars a bear. (The modern English quote is: "As the Greeks and other nations, and our selves call the seven stars, or Charles Wain, the bear; so do they [using the words] Mosk or Paukunnawaw, [which both mean] the bear.") (At least one other early source identifies that in the language of the Narragansett tribe the words mosk and paukúnauwaw both mean "a bear," and also have several other meanings.) However, Roger Williams also claimed he found their language had a great affinity with the Greek language. This claim has not been taken up by any specialist in Native American languages. The Narragansett tribe occupied the area surrounding Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island (and also parts of Connecticut and eastern Massachusetts). Most of the New England tribes spoke Algonquin languages. The Narragansett tribe were prolific traders. It is estimated that up to 75 percent of Native Americans in New England died of European diseases in the 1500's and 1600's.
In 1712 Cotton Mather wrote that he asked the Native Americans in Boston about their astronomical knowledge and was told that they always called the constellation known by the Europeans as "the bear" by the name of paukunnawaw, meaning "the bear." In the case of both Roger Williams and Cotton Mather we really have no knowledge of how critically the information was gathered, an assessment of their informants, and the reliability of both the information and the informants.
Probably one of the best (but uncritical) collections of Native American star lore is to be found in Stars of the First People by Dorcas Miller (1997). However, no one seems to have really examined the possibility of mistaken cross cultural equivalences. Undoubtedly we need a more critical assessment of sources - not simply repetitive assembling of references. The issue is raised by the astronomer John Eddy in his article "Archaeoastronomy of North America." in In Search of Ancient Astronomies edited by Ed. Krupp (1978). The astronomer John Eddy has made it clear on several occasions that he is somewhat skeptical of the argument for widespread Native American belief in Big Dipper = bear constellation prior to European influence.
The identification of Ursa Major (or more accurately the 7 stars forming the Big Dipper asterism) as a bear constellation in North America largely exists in the Algonquin speaking groups of northeastern North America and also in the Plateau groups living in the northern part of East Oregon. (The Plateau group lived in the area between the Cascade Range on the west and the Rocky Mountains on the east and north of the Great Basin. The Plateau group culture was not stable.) It would seem that few of the southwestern Indian tribes (some 18 approximately) identified the Big Dipper with a bear constellation. (It all depends on who is included in the list and vice-versa who is excluded. The Zuni and Jemez are commonly excluded.)

The southwestern Indian tribes tend to call the stars of the Big Dipper as "the seven." (An exception are the Southern Paiute who identify the Big Dipper as a bear. The Keresan Sia (a Pueblo tribe) also appear to identify the Big Dipper as a bear.) It is commonly held that apart from some very early and transient Spanish (and Portuguese) contact the southwestern tribes appear to have remained almost untouched by European influence (but not European contact) until the late 1800s. However, in her 1936 article "Riddles and Metaphors among Indian Peoples." (Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 49, Numbers 191/192, Jan.-Jun., Pages 171-174) Elsie Parsons observed: "The Pueblo Indians have been exposed for centuries to Spanish riddles and tales; they have taken over the tales but not the riddles." Jesuit missionaries seem to have had far-reaching contact with most other tribes during the 1500s. (See also: Pueblo Indian Folk-Tales, probably of Spanish Provenience." by Elsi Parsons in Journal of American Folklore, 1918, Volume 31; and "Spanish Tales from Laguna and Zūni, New Mexico." by Elsie Parsons and Franz Boas in Journal of American Foklore, 1920, Volume 33.) Few southwestern tribes appear to have a bear constellation. Also, it is recognised that the astronomical information that has been recorded in this region by ethnologists is frequently very confused and contradictory. (It has been pointed out that the publication Ethnography of the Tewa Indians by John Harrington (1916) needs to be used with some caution (and this includes the astronomical information on star names and constellations) as his willingness to pay for information resulted in him being misled by some informants (now called consultants). The Tewa are part of the Pueblo Indian group.) The reference(s) used by William Gibbon have the Zuni Indians and the Jemez Indians identifying the Big Dipper as a bear constellation. It is doubtful, however, that the Zuni can be included in the list for the Zuni identification of the Big Dipper as a bear constellation usually relates to references to Stansbury Hagar or Frank Cushing.
"The Blackfeet know the principal stars of Ursa Major as seven boys, all save the youngest of whom (Dubhæ) had been killed by their sister. The Sioux call the four body stars the coffin. It is borne by four men who are followed by mourners. Mizar and Alcor are called 'She who comes with her young ones weeping.' The Ojibwas also called these stars 'the Fisher' .... (Hasting's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 23, Page 71.)"
Interestingly, in his book Myths and Folk-lore of the Timiskaming Algonquin and Timagami Ojibwa (1915, Pages 22-23) the ethnologist Frank Speck states that in the folklore of the Timiskaming Algonquin (who are located in Canada near Quebec) the constellation Ursa Major is called "fisher" or "black cat." The 4 main stars (of the asterism "the dipper") form the body of the animal and the 3 stars trailing behind (the "handle of the dipper") represent the fisher's tail. In his book Beothuk and Micmac (1922), focusing on Newfoundland, Frank Speck makes no mention of a bear story. In the book In Indian Tents: Stories Told by Penobscot, Passamaquoddy and Micmac Indians to Abby Alger (1897) no mention is made of any bear story. It is easy to conclude that a celestial bear story was not widespread amongst the Micmacs.
Neither Stansbury Hagar or Frank Cushing can be considered reliable. The work of both is generally ignored by modern anthropologists/ethnologists. Both worked within a period known as salvage ethnology (also known as the Dark Ages of ethnology). Salvage ethnography is generally associated with the anthropologist Franz Boas. It is the recording of the practices and folklore of believed rapidly disappearing cultures. In the late 19th-century there was concern with the rapidly disappearing traditional cultures of aboriginal Canada. Stansbury Hagar's work with the Mi'kmaq simply focused on oral testimony from informants (now called consultants) but it does not appear that he had a command of the Mi'kmaq language. (By the end of the 19th-century - at the time of Hagar's investigations - many Newfoundland Mi'kmaqs had ceased speaking their own language.) Hagar was not a seasoned ethnologist when he collected Mi'kmaq stories. There is no indication ofhow they were recorded. Also unresolved is the question: Did Hagar pay his informants (consultants) an honorarium? Unlike Cushing who lived with the Zuni for years Hagar only made brief visits to them where they had an encampment near an established town (i.e., Digby) and used several informants (now called consultants) only. This leads to the issue of how hurriedly the stories were collected. It is perhaps likely that Hagar never spent more than several weeks at a time in Digby. (By way of interest the town of Digby dates to the latter half of the 18th-century and the rail line to Digby was completed in 1891.) Hagar was obviously dealing with members of the Digby-Annapolis tribe which occupied the area of the Digby and Annapolis counties. (By the late 19th-century the Mi'kmaqs lived in abject poverty in small communities near European towns that had been trading centres.) Additionally, Hagar did not always specify who exactly gave him what information. (Two early informants (now called consultants) were Abram (Abraham) Glode and Newell [Newel] Glode, both Elders of the Bear River Band, Bear River Reserve. Their recollections were the basis for much of the information collected by Hagar.) No critical study of the ethnological contributions of Stansbury Hagar has been made (or at least published). There is no reason to believe Stansbury Hagar had any command of the Mi'kmaq language. He likely never obtained any stories in Mi'kmaq. (Franz Boas (1858-1944) is considered to be the first professional anthropologist to do field work in Canada. This was first carried out in the 1880s.) In their critical discussion of Zuni constellations and star names ("Ethnoastronomy: The Zuni Case." In: Williamson, Ray. (Editor). Archaeoastronomy in the Americas. (1981, Pages 183-191) Mary Young and Ray Williamson state that "the "seven stars" is ordinarily used by the Zuni for the Western constellation the Big Dipper." It is worth mentioning that it is recognised that the pioneer ethnologist Frank Cushing extensively reworked Zuni stories. Cushing did not hesitate to add his own inventions to the original Zuni stories. This has been made clear by both Dennis Tedlock and Eliza McFeely. In his generous Introduction to Cushing's book Zuni Folk Tales (1901) the noted ethnologist John Powell (1834-1902) wrote: "Mr Cushing has introduced a hybrid tale into his collection entitled "The Cock and the Mouse." Such tales are found again and again among the Amerinds. In a large majority of cases Bible stories are compounded with native stories ...." (The German-American anthropologist Franz Boas (1858-1942), an admirer of Cushing's ability, nevertheless remarked that Cushing's work would have to be done all over again.) For a critical assessment of Cushing and his lack of rigorous methodology see especially: The Zuni and the American Imagination by (the historian) Eliza McFeely (2002). Further, John Powell has described Cushing's book Zuni Folk Tales as discredited mythology. See also "Identity and Difference." in the Translation of Native American Oral Literatures: A Zuni Case Study

by William Clements (SAIL, Series 2, Volume 3, Number 3, Fall, 1991, Pages 1-13). (It is also on record that Cushing caused deep offence to the Zuni's with his eagerness to relate their stories, and display their artifacts, to Europeans.) William Newell, the editor of The Journal of American Folk-Lore, wrote of Zuni creation myths furnished by Cushing: "... the impression of philosophic reflection is intensified by the biblical language favored by the reporter." (See: The Journal of American Folk-Lore, Volume 10, April-June, 1897, Number 37, Page 163.) Also see the informed critical article on the issue of European sources: "Proceed with Caution: Using Native American Folktales in the Classroom." by Debbie Reese (Language Arts, Volume 84, Number 3, January, 2007, Pages 245-256).
Gibbon uses Reagan for the Jemez beliefs. The article ("Notes on Jemez Ethnography." (American Anthropologist, New Series Volume 29, 1927, Pages 719-728)) by Albert Reagan, who spent a lot of time with the Jemez, relates a story involving the turning of the Bear into a constellation in the "cold northern heavens." Gibbon, however, does not identify which stars are identified as the Bear by the Jemez as Reagan cannot make the identification of a Jemez bear constellation with the stars of the Big Dipper. Reagan does not know which stars are meant. (The implication of the bear constellation being described as being placed in the cold northern heavens is that it is the stars comprising the Big Dipper.) According to Von Del Chamberlain the Jemez saw the stars of Taurus as forming a celestial bear (the Hyades as the face and the other stars of Taurus as the body). Both Gibbon and Chamberlain can't both be correct. Also, Taurus as the Jemez bear constellation does not qualify as being in the cold northern heavens. The issue clearly needs to be resolved by other means than simply preferential choice that it is likely that the stars of the Big Dipper are meant.
Another example involving southwestern Indians. Navajo belief in a celestial bear = the Big Dipper is not supported by the anthropologist Berard Haile (Starlore Among the Navajo (1947)) who worked with the Zuni for 50 years. Chamberlain, like Haile, also identifies the Navajo constellation of The Revolving Male (not identified as a bear) with the Big Dipper (= the primary stars of Ursa Major) plus the Pole Star. Paired with this constellation is the constellation of The Revolving Woman formed by the stars of Cassiopeia.
Interestingly, Franciscan friars established a mission at Zuni (Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico) in 1629.
When the same motif is found both in Eurasia and Americas, we can have 4 separate explanations:
1. Common origin. Which implies ancestors of American Indians brought the story across the Bering Strait 15,000 (10,000) years ago.
2. Independent invention. Usually preferred explanation, but in some cases it's really stretching belief.
3. Late contact across Bering Strait. As example: It is well known that contacts between Siberian and Alaskan Eskimos continued for the last 2000 years. It is indicated that some cultural elements penetrated by this route.
4. European impact. This is pretty simple – Indians could have acquired some folklore elements from European settlers after discovery of America. After all, most of American Indian mythology was collected by anthropologists in 19th and 20th centuries, hundreds of years after first contact with Europe.
The more direct source for the observed similarities would be the influx of European priests and missionaries throughout the Americas in the centuries after 1492. They would have received an education that included the Greek and Latin classics, and one way for them to engage with local peoples would be through the sharing of stories and myths about the natural world.
In summary: A large number of tales diffused from European settlers to Native American peoples. Also, a large number of Native American myths/folktales became a syncretic fusion of traditional indigenous tales and post-contact European tales. The case for acceptance of a pre-contact Native American bear constellation needs to deal with (1) problems existing with the reliability of early ethnological work; (2) possibility existing for post-contact influence and diffusion; and (3) possibility existing for the late introduction of the bear constellation from southeast Asia across water "highways" and diffusion. The case for rejection of a Bering Strait migration / pre-contact Native American bear constellation needs to deal with (1) seeming distinct form of Native American bear constellation tales compared to European tradition; (2) early post-contact reports of a Native American bear constellation; and (3) existence of certain parallels between Siberian/Asian star lore and North America star lore relating to the Big Dipper asterism. The possibility existing of the late (pre-contact) introduction of the bear constellation from southeast Asia across water "highways" rejects the Bering Strait migration theory but accepts the pre-contact Native American bear constellation theory.
Table summary of possibilities for the introduction of the bear constellation into the Americas. (Basically there are only 4 possibilities.)
(1) Bering Strait crossing theory (circa 12000 BCE). The original migrations to the American continent brought the bear constellation with them. They then remained isolated from the rest of the world until European contact in the 15th-century CE. [Rated as unlikely.]
(2) 'Recent' pre-European contact across the Bering Strait "sea road" (beginning circa 3000 BCE) - for which there is archaeological/ethnographic evidence. The Bering Strait is presently 83 kilometres (51 miles) wide from Siberia to Alaska. Circa 2013 the marine scientist Sonya Baumstein crossed the Bering Strait on a stand-up paddleboard. [Rated as likely.]
(3) Post European contact (beginning circa 15th-century CE). There is a strong case for the introduction of the bear

Major prolonged events disrupting the continuity of Native American cultural life:
(1) Population collapse (mainly disease/also warfare and starvation).
(2) Geographic displacement (European settler land claims/establishment of reservation system).
(3) Tribal assimilation (re-establishment of previously distinct Native American groups into new tribes).
(4) European interaction/Cultural mixing (constant European-Native American contact/intermarriage.
Appendix 1: New Worlds for All: Indians, Europeans, and the Remaking of Early America by Colin Calloway (1997).
Calloway deals with a neglected aspect of possible European influences on Native American traditions - European captives.
Page xiii: "In many ways, the worlds Indian peoples had created in North America over countless centuries did fall to pieces after European Christian missionaries and others came to their country. But the story did not end there. Indian people-those who survived the new wars, diseases, economic disruption, and societal disintegration generated by European invasionpicked up the pieces and set about rebuilding their world. They saved what they could from the old and used what they could that was new."
Page 3: "Anthropologist Jack Weatherford thinks that the "scramble of peoples and cultures in North America has created a cultural mixture that probably will not be repeated in world history until we encounter life on another planet." Historian Gary Nash points out that the continuous interaction of diverse cultural groups in colonial America produced "a conglomeration of cultural entities." People tend to construct their cultures in interaction with one another, not in isolation. Frank Shuffleton, considering the people of early America "a mixed race," defines ethnicity not as something static and constant but as "a dynamic relation between different cultural groups," who continually modify their understanding of themselves in light of shifting relationships with others."
Page 5: "Colonists from different regions of Europe developed varying relations with different Indian tribes, and did so in a variety of circumstances. Hispanic people in the Southwest and Frenchmen in Canada, the Great Lakes, and Louisiana generally intermingled more freely with Indian peoples than did English settlers on the Atlantic seaboard. A Franciscan friar in 1631 complained that Spaniards in New Mexico were "reared from childhood subject to the customs of [the] Indians," and the Indian imprint on society is visible today more clearly in New Mexico than in New England. In the Great Lakes region, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Frenchmen and Algonkian Indians created what ethnohistorian Richard White calls "a middle ground," where the French and Indian worlds "melted at the edges and merged" and where it became unclear "whether a particular practice or way of doing things was French or Indian." According to cultural geographers Terry Jordan and Matti Kaups, interactions and cultural exchanges were greatest in "Midland America," where Swedish and Finnish settlers in the Delaware Valley established good relations with the local Indians and produced a mixed backwoods culture that later pioneers carried to large areas of America. The culture of immigrant Saro-Karelian Finns, joined to the indigenous culture of the Delaware Indians, "yielded all the essential ingredients of a syncretistic Midland American colonizing system." Subsequent generations of Scotch-Irish immigrants adopted the Finnish-Indian techniques of forest colonization they found in the Delaware Valley and pushed west and southwest. They added their own genetic and cultural input to early American backwoods culture and society, and only rarely replicated the patterns of peaceful coexistence forged by Finns and Delawares. New York's Mohawk Valley was the scene of bitter fighting during the American Revolution, but the eighteenth-century valley was more often a place where Indians and Europeans talked, traded, and intermarried, where some Indians drank tea and some Europeans tattooed their faces."
Page 6: "Early America in the wake of European invasion became a cacophony of languages, peoples, and cultures. In this "kaleidoscope of human encounters, "Indians and Europeans made what historian T. H. Breen calls "creative adaptations" to new places and new peoples. What emerged was something different, for both Indians and Europeans, from what had gone before. In his excellent history of the Catawba Indians, James Merrell has shown how invasions from Europe created a new world for Native peoples in North America. At first, European colonists had to fit into an Indian world and adapt to the Indians' ways of doing things. As the Europeans adapted to and then transformed America, however, eventually the Indians had to fit into a European world. "Like their new neighbors;' writes Merrell, "Indians had to blend old and new ways that would permit them to survive in the present and prepare for the future without utterly forsaking the past." Both groups of peoples had to make adjustments, but not at the same time, place, or rate. By the end of the colonial era, Indians and

In the late 19th-century the so-called Indian Territory (comprising most of Oklahoma and Kansas) became the home of many diverse tribes due to the removal policy of the USA government.

constellation into North America being either late and/or (re)introduced by European Americans, especially, for example, the French settlers. The French settlers eventually occupied an enormous territory stretching as far east as the Maritime provinces and south to the Gulf of Mexico. The French folklore tradition was strengthened by frequent intermarriage with Native Americans and the French practice of proactively transmitting their culture orally across the generations.

Europeans alike had created new societies in America. The European societies displayed evidence of change; many Indian societies had changed beyond recognition."
Page 23: "By 1800, the landscape of North America had changed in another significant way. There were far fewer Indian people. A country that John Winthrop described as ''full of Indians" early in the seventeenth century, was now largely emptied of Indians. Those Indian people who survived, did so by adapting to a world that was very different from the one their forefathers had known and created."
Page 34: "The population collapse continued in the seventeenth century. Governor Diego de Rebolledo reported in 1657 that the Guale and Timucua Indians were few "because they have been wiped out with the sickness of the plague and smallpox which have overtaken them in past years." Two years later the new governor of Florida said 10,000 Indians had died in a measles epidemic. According to one scholar, the Timucuans numbered as many as 150,000 people before contact; by the end of the seventeenth century, their population had been cut by 98 percent. The Apalachee Indians of northern Florida numbered 25,000-30,000 in the early seventeenth century; by the end of the century, less than 8,000 survived. Two and a half centuries after contact with the Spaniards, all of Florida's original Indian people were gone. The pattern repeated itself elsewhere. In 1585, the English established a colony at Roanoke Island in Virginia. Almost immediately, local Indians began to fall ill and die. "The disease was so strange to them," wrote Thomas Hariot, "that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it." Across the continent, Pueblo Indians in New Mexico may have suffered from a huge smallpox epidemic that spread as far south as Chile and across much of North America in 1519-24. When they first encountered Europeans in 1539, the Pueblos numbered at least 130,000 and inhabited between 110 and 150 pueblos. By 1706, New Mexico's Pueblo population had dropped to 6,440 people in 18 pueblos. When de Soto's Spaniards passed through the area now known as Arkansas in 1541-43, the region was densely populated. Thousands of people lived in large towns, cultivating extensive cornfields along rich river valleys. One hundred thirty years later, these thriving communities were gone, victims of disease and possibly drought. When French explorers arrived in the mid-seventeenth century, they found Caddoes, Osages, and Quapaws living on the peripheries of the region, but central Arkansas was empty. Epidemic diseases continued their devastation. In 1698, Frenchmen found less than one hundred men in the Quapaw villages after a recent smallpox epidemic killed most of the people. "In the village are nothing but graves," the French chronicler reported."
Pages 34 & 35: "Indian peoples in eastern Canada who had been in contact with French fur traders and fishermen since early in· the sixteenth century experienced the deadly repercussions of such commerce. Jesuit Father Pierre Biard, working among the Micmacs and Maliseets of Nova Scotia in 1616, heard the Indians "complain that since the French mingle and carry on trade with them they are dying fast, and the population is thinning out. For they assert that before this association and intercourse all their countries were very populous and they tell how one by one different coasts, according as they traffic with us, have been reduced more by disease." Deadly pestilence swept the coast of New England in 1616-17. Indians "died in heapes," and the Massachusett Indians around Plymouth Bay were virtually exterminated. As reported by Governor William Bradford, the Pilgrims found cleared fields and good soil, but few people, the Indians "being dead & abundantly wasted in the late great mortalitiy which fell in all these parts about three years over before the coming of the English, wherin thousands of them dyed, they not being able to burie one another; their sculs and bones were found in many places lying still above ground, where their houses & dwellings had been; a very sad spectacle to behold.""
Pages 35-37: "Smallpox struck New England in 1633, devastating Indian communities on the Merrimack and Connecticut Rivers. Bradford reported how "it pleased God to visite these Indeans with a great sickness, and such a mortalitie that of a 1000 above 900. and a halfe of them dyed, and many of them did rott above ground for want of buriall." The epidemic reduced the Pequots in southern Connecticut from perhaps as many as thirteen thousand people to only three thousand, setting the stage for their defeat by the English in 1637, and it may have reduced the Mohawks in eastern New York from almost eight thousand to less than three thousand. Such mortality rates were not unusual when virulent new diseases cut through previously unexposed populations. Indians from the Hudson River told Adriaen Van der Donck in 1656 "that before the smallpox broke out amongst them, they were ten times as numerous as they are now." John Lawson estimated that in 1701 there was "not the sixth Savage living within two hundred Miles of all our Settlements, as there were fifty Years ago." A recent smallpox epidemic in the Carolina upcountry had "destroy'd whole towns." At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Huron Indians numbered as many as 30,000-40,000 people, living in perhaps twenty-eight villages on the northern shores of the Great Lakes in southern Ontario. The French identified them as crucial to their plans for North American empire. The Hurons were the key to extensive trade networks reaching far beyond the Great Lakes, and their villages could also serve as "jumping-off points" for Jesuit missionary enterprises among more distant tribes. French traders and missionaries arrived in Huronia, and it was not long before the new diseases were reaping a grim harvest among the Hurons. Their longhouses were transformed into death traps. The smallpox epidemic that ravaged New England in 1633 reached Huronia in 1634. Smallpox or measles was thinning Huron numbers in 1635-36. A Huron elder, blaming the epidemic on the Jesuits, said, "The plague has entered every lodge in the village, and has so reduced my family that today there are but two of us left, and who can say whether we two will survive." Influenza struck in 1636-37. Smallpox returned in 1639. Huron population was scythed in half between 1634 and 1640. In 1648-49, famine and the attacks of the Iroquois completed the deadly work the diseases had begun. The Hurons scattered, most of the survivors being absorbed by other tribes. Smallpox continued throughout the eighteenth century. It killed half the Cherokees in 1738 and returned in 1760; the Catawbas of South Carolina lost half their number to the epidemic of 1759. In 1763, the British doled out blankets from the smallpox hospital at Fort Pitt to visiting Indians; smallpox erupted among the tribes of the Ohio Valley soon thereafter. Outbreaks of smallpox were reported among Indian populations in New Mexico in 1719, 1733, 1738, 1747, and 1749; in Texas recurrently between 1674 and 1802; and in California, where Indian neophytes congregated in Spanish mission

villages made easy targets for new crowd-killing diseases. The massive smallpox epidemic that ravaged western North America between 1779 and 1783 illustrates the speed with which the disease could spread its tentacles throughout Indian country. The epidemic seems to have broken out in Mexico, and it afflicted Indian peoples in Peru and Guatemala. Spreading north to Spanish settlements like San Antonio and Santa Fe, it was picked up by Indians who visited the area to trade for horses. It was then quickly transmitted north and west, through the Rockies and across the plains, slaughtering as it went. It spread into the Canadian forests, killed as many as go percent of the Chipewyans in the central subarctic, and by 1783 was killing Cree Indians around Hudson Bay."
Pages 37 & 38: "Smallpox was probably the number-one killer of Indian people, but it was by no means the only fatal disease. Epidemics of measles, influenza, bubonic plague, diphtheria, typhus, scarlet fever, yellow fever, and other unidentified diseases also took their toll. Alcoholism added to the list of killer diseases imported from Europe. "A person who resides among them may easily observe the frightful decrease of their numbers from one period of ten years to another," said John Heckewelder, lamenting the impact of alcohol. "Our vices have destroyed them more than our swords." Recurring epidemics allowed Indian populations no opportunity to bounce back from earlier losses. They cut down economic productivity, generating hunger and famine, which rendered those who survived one disease more vulnerable to affliction by the next. New diseases combined with falling birth rates, escalating warfare, alcoholism, arid general social upheaval to turn Indian America into a graveyard. Decreased fecundity hindered population recovery. Nantucket, off the coast of Massachusetts, was once described as "an island full of Indians" and is estimated to have had a population of about 3,000 in the mid-seventeenth century. By 1763, there were 348 people. An epidemic of yellow fever that year left only twenty survivors. Some 3,000 Indians inhabited· Martha's Vineyard in 1642; 313 survived in 1764. Mohawk population continued to decline to little more than 600 by the time of the Revolution. At the western door of the Iroquois confederacy, Seneca population remained stable, but this was largely because they adopted captives and immigrants from other communities ravaged by war and disease. The Illinois Indians of the Great Lakes region numbered more than ten thousand people in 1670; by 1800, no more than five hundred survived. On the banks of the Missouri in present-day Nebraska, the Omaha Indians numbered more than three thousand in the late 1700s; cholera and smallpox cut their population to less than three hundred by 1802. In years when Indian peoples needed all their resources to deal with Europeans and to cope with a world that was changing around them, their numbers were being steadily eroded by disease. Survivors, many of them disfigured by pockmarks, faced the future bereft of loved ones and without the wisdom of elders to guide them. Societies woven together by ties of kinship and clan were torn apart. After disease struck Martha's Vineyard in 1645-46, one survivor lamented that all the elders who had taught and guided the people were dead, "and their wisdome is buried with them." In 1710, Indians near Charleston, South Carolina, told a settler they had forgotten most of their traditions because "their Old Men are dead." In some cases, power struggles followed the deaths of traditional leaders. Old certainties no longer applied, and long-established patterns of behavior must sometimes have seemed irrelevant. The impact of such losses on Indian minds and souls is incalculable."
Page 39: "Not all Indian populations suffered 75 percent or 90 percent mortality rates-indeed, in some areas of the country Indian populations were on the rise in the eighteenth century-but the result was a world newly emptied of Indian inhabitants. Europeans arriving in Indian country in the wake of one or more epidemics made inaccurate estimates of precontact Indian population size on the basis of head counts of survivors. Seeing remnant populations, they gained a distorted impression of the size and sophistication of the societies that had once existed-and that distorted impression entered the history books. America, many believed, was an "empty wilderness," a "virgin land." If the country was empty, that was a recent development; it was depopulated rather than unpopulated. The new world of opportunity, which "free lands" opened for Europeans in North America, was in itself a by-product of European invasion. Historians working to revise the old view of the European settlement of America as a story of progress and triumph have rightly stressed the biological cataclysm that followed European "discovery.""
Page 40: "Though scholars disagree widely in their estimates, it is likely that in what is today the United States, Indian population stood at somewhere between 5 million and 10 million in 1492. By 1800, the figure had fallen to around 600,000."
Page 42: "In 1719, William Tapp or Taptico, the last werowance (district chief) of the Wicomoco Indians of Chesapeake Bay, died. Three Englishmen compiled and appraised the inventory of his estate. Tapp owned goods and livestock valued at £100. His wardrobe consisted of English-style clothing - hats, vests, breeches, garters, and shoes. His house was furnished with chests, tables and chairs, and four feather beds, and there was an assortment of spoons, pewter plates, table linen, old books, and paper. The chief had lived in a manner comparable to that of neighboring English planters. But he also left fishhooks and line, a canoe, guns, and axes, indicating that he had continued to practice the traditional activities of an Algonkian male-fishing, hunting, and clearing the land. The presence of sheep, cattle, chickens, and a spinning wheel indicated that his wife, Elizabeth, had added spinning, knitting, and dairying to the traditional tasks of an Algonkian woman preparing food, making pottery, and rearing children."
Page 74: "In New England, meanwhile, Indian peoples encountered a different brand of Christianity as English missionaries introduced them to the tenets of Puritanism. Puritan missionaries demanded what amounted to cultural suicide from their Indian converts, insisting that they live like their English neighbors if they intended to practice the Christian religion. Nevertheless, many Indian people accepted conversion as they sought spiritual meaning in an increasingly chaotic world. Thomas Mayhew Jr. began preaching to the Wampanoag Indians on Martha's Vineyard in the 1640s but with relatively little success. Then, epidemic diseases swept the island in 1643 and 1645. The shamans, the traditional spiritual leaders and

healers, were unable to cure the sick. Scores of Indian people looked to Christianity to provide new explanations, if not new cures, and to fill a void left by the decline of traditional communal rituals. The Indians built their own church community and passed the Gospel from generation to generation."
Page 80: "The Franciscan friar Junipero Serra brought Catholicism to the Indians of California in 1769. Traveling north to the San Francisco Bay area, his expedition established the first Catholic mission at San Diego. Other missions followed until a chain of twenty-one missions stretched more than 650 miles. By 1800, Indian neophytes-as the converts were callednumbered some twenty thousand, testimony to the disintegration of Native societies under the hammerblows of new diseases as much as to the power of Christianity."
Page 99: "Captive taking was a traditional part of the culture of war in many Indian societies, and Iroquois warriors regularly brought captives back to their villages for ritual torture or for adoption into the community, in either case assuaging the grief of relatives who had lost loved ones. Now, Iroquois warriors went to war both to acquire captives and to maintain access to hunting grounds. In 1649, Iroquois war parties smashed the confederacy of their Huron trade rivals, laying waste to Huronia and adopting many survivors. In subsequent years, the Iroquois overran the neighboring Petuns, Neutrals, and Eries. By the 1660s, they were fighting Indian peoples from the St. Lawrence to Virginia, from New England to the Great Lakes."
Page 125: "The new world created by the interaction of Europeans and Indians produced many individuals capable of fulfilling such roles. Many captives, former captives, and children of mixed marriages found a valuable niche in Indianwhite relations, since they, and sometimes they alone, had the experience, expertise, and contacts in both worlds to act as intermediaries and communicators. Jacques Cartier took two sons of the Iroquoian chief Donnacona with him to France in 1534. They learned French and returned with Cartier on his second voyage the next year, and Cartier's conversations with them produced a small French-Iroquoian dictionary."
Page 135: "Nevertheless, Indians did travel frequently and extensively long before Europeans arrived. Moccasin paths and canoe routes, networks of commerce and communication, crisscrossed the country and linked Indian communities as far apart as the Ohio Valley and the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes and New England. Indian paddlers covered immense distances following the watercourses of North America."
Page 142: "American history textbooks, and some books on Indian history, frequently contain maps that purport to show the location of Indian tribes in 1492, thus "setting the stage" for what was to follow. Such maps often underestimate or totally ignore the reshuffling of Indian populations that occurred in the wake of European contact. The mobility and movement that were integral parts of traditional Indian life gave way to forced migrations. Indian peoples fled new diseases, were scattered by warfare, pursued new economic opportunities and new ways of life, were attracted or repulsed by mission villages, were edged out by white settlers, retreated from white soldiers, or gravitated toward forts for trade or protection. They jostled for position with new neighbors, and sometimes they created new communities and even new tribal or individual identities in the crucible of change and movement that was early America."
Page 143: "Spanish invasion of America generated demographic disruption across large areas of what is now the southern United States. As de Soto's conquistadors cut through the Southeast the human landscape of the region changed forever. War and disease sent populations plummeting. Survivors reeled out of the invaders' way: villages relocated downriver or into the uplands, and much of northwestern Georgia and eastern Tennessee became depopulated, allowing Cherokee-speaking peoples to move into the area. Florida suffered massive depopulation in the century after de Soto's men passed through. Those Timucuans, Guales, and Apalachees who survived resettled around Christian missions after Spaniards built St. Augustine in 1565. In 1703-4, South Carolina militiamen and their Indian allies destroyed Florida's mission communities, carrying thousands of Timucuans and Apalachees into slavery. The rest scattered, and one group fled west. With the exception of a few Native enclaves huddled around St. Augustine, Florida had become a virtual population vacuum. By the time William Bartram traveled through the Southeast on the eve of the American Revolution, the loose alliance of towns stretching across Georgia and Alabama known as the Creek confederacy consisted of "many tribes, or remnants of conquered nations, united." But the fluid nature of the confederacy allowed groups to move away and establish new communities. During the eighteenth century, various groups of Creeks gradually separated from the parent confederacy and went to the depopulated areas of northern Florida."
Page 155: "Taking captives had traditionally appeased sorrowing relatives and assuaged the spirits of deceased kinfolk; after European invasion, it became a way of maintaining population levels as well as patching the social fabric torn by war and disease. Indian peoples who adopted members of other tribes into their communities afforded white captives the same courtesy. War parties often embarked on raids specifically for captives, taking thongs and extra moccasins for the prisoners."
Page 157: "When Peter Kalm visited Canada in the mid-eighteenth century, his party hired an Indian guide from the Huron mission village at Lorette. "This Indian," observed Kalm, "was an Englishman by birth, taken by the Indians thirty years ago when he was a boy and adopted by them according to their custom in the place of a relation of theirs killed by the enemy." He became a Roman Catholic and married an Indian woman. He dressed like an Indian, and he spoke English, French, "and many Indian dialects." Captive taking had been so common during the French and Indian wars that many Indians whom Kalm saw in Canada were mixed-bloods, "and a large number of the Indians now living owe their origin to Europe." Joseph Louis Gill, a prominent Abenaki chief at Odanak at the time of the American Revolution, was the son of two English people

who had been captured, adopted, converted to Catholicism, and married each other. Gill-"the white chief of the St. Francis Abenakis"-was English by blood but Abenaki by upbringing and allegiance."
Page 185: "When the French and the English penetrated the southern interior, refugees from the chiefdoms and new immigrants had rebuilt, or were rebuilding, new societies from the ruins. Living in relatively small villages, Indian people banded together in loose confederacies, becoming the Catawbas, Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and other tribes and confederacies of the South. The Indian peoples encountered when English traders first penetrated the Southeast after the founding of Charleston (1670) were already "postcontact" societies. The new societies of North America were ethnically as well as tribally mixed. Indian communities that adopted captives added a European strand to their social fabric. And many new communities, especially on the frontier, were almost from their beginnings multiethnic societies. Arriving at Charlestown, New Hampshire, then the northern frontier of New England, as a girl in 1744, Susanna Johnson found nine or ten families living in cabins, and numerous Indians "associated in a friendly manner with the whites." Looking back in her old age to that time, she recalled: "In these days there was such a mixture on the frontiers of savages and settlers, without established laws to govern them, that the state of society cannot easily be described."
Appendix 2: Two of Stansbury Hagar's early informants (now called consultants) were Abram Glode and Newell Glode. (Much of what is known about Mi'kmaq lore has come from Abram and Newell Glode. Another source of Mi'kmaq lore was Pierre Clemeau, "a famous Micmac storyteller" whom Stansbury Hagar interviewed at least once. I have been unable to find any information about Pierre Clemeau.) At the time Hagar published his 1895 article on "Micmac Customs and Traditions" Abram Glode was 73. Abram Glode was considered to be a very reliable Micmac by Stansbury Hagar. Abram Glode would have been initially interviewed in 1894 by Hagar for his article published in January 1895. It is most likely that Stansbury Hagar first met Newell Glode (Abram Glode's son) in New York City. In 1890 Newell Glode (who appears to have been well educated) had presented a somewhat controversial paper (talk) to the New York Academy of Sciences on his views of the nature of folklore and mythology. Earlier, in 1888, in several published articles, Newell Glode had emphasised the need to collect Native American material on folklore, myths, and tales. (See: American Folklore Scholarship by Rosemary Zumwalt (1988).) Both Abram Glode and Newell [Newel] Glode were Elders of the Bear River Band, Bear River Reserve. During the 19th-century and during the early 20th-century there seems to have been considerable Mi'kmaqs with the family name Glode, including: Sam Glode, Jim Glode, Joseph Glode, Charles Glode, Louis Glode, and Joan Glode. The date of birth for Newell Glode appears to be unknown. His wife's first names may have been Mary Ann. Abram Glode attending school in 1843 is mentioned in L'sitkuk: The Story of the Bear River Mi'kmaw Community by Darlene Ricker (1997). See also the lengthy (German-language) dissertation Der Heilbringer by Arie Deursen (1931). It is indicated that Newell Glode served with the Canadian Forces during World War I, with the rank of Private. He was described as a good canoe paddler.
"My information about the customs and traditions of the Micmac Indians of Nova Scotia has been derived almost entirely from Abram and Newell Glode, the first a man of seventy-three years, the latter somewhat younger and of exceptionally pure blood for a time when none are wholly so. These two Indians have justly achieved a reputation among their tribe for intelligence and knowledge of their native lore. During the many days I' have spent with them at Digby and elsewhere I have invariably found them all eager and interested in being questioned as I was in catechizing them. However, in most cases I have confirmed what they told me by information obtained from others, and I have read to them what I have written in order to avoid mistakes." ("Micmac Customs and Traditions." by Stanbury (sic) Hagar (The American Anthropologist, Volume VIII, January, 1895, Page 31.)
Two other sources Stansbury Hagar relied upon for Mi'kmaq traditions were Silas Rand and Charles Leland. Both are considered somewhat unreliable. However, Stansbury Hagar considered both persons to be capable investigators of Mi'kmaq tradition/lore.
The issues arising here are: (1) Has Hagar recorded the evidence fully and accurately; (2) Were all possible informants used, or simply those who were considered the 'best;' (3) Were all available variants recorded.
Worth noting is the fact that Franz Boas (1858-1942) who, in 1886 worked among American Indian tribes in British Columbia, used the technique of recording the reminiscences of informants as a valuable supplement to ethnography.
Appendix 3: Quote from the Introduction of The Algonquin Legends of New England by Charles Leland (1884). (Charles Leland was a 19th-century amateur anthropologist and largely armchair folklorist. Much of his work is now discounted as unreliable.)
"There has always been intercourse between Greenland and Labrador, and in this latter country we find the first Algonquin Indians. Even at the present day there are men among the Mi'kmaqs and Passamaquoddies who have gone on their hunting excursions even to the Eskimo. I myself know one of the latter who has done so, and the Rev. S. T. Rand, in answer to a question on the subject, writes to me as follows:-
"Nancy Jeddore, a Mi'kmaq woman, assures me that her father, now dead, used to go as far as the wild (heathen) Eskimo, and remained once for three years among the more civilized. She has so correctly described their habits that I am satisfied that her statements are correct.""

"Although our Indians exist in an ignorance so gross that, as we have said, they do not know how to read or how to write, they have nevertheless some knowledge of the Great and the Little Bears, which they call, the first Mouhinne, and the second Mouhinchiche, which mean exactly in our language the Great and the Little Bears. They say that the three guards of the North Star is a canoe in which three Indians are embarked to overtake this bear, but that unfortunately they have not been able to catch it." [Note: (1) This is hardly a detailed systematic description for purpose of comparison. (2) According to Stansbury Hagar the Mi'kmaqs identified 2 bear constellations to him.]
Part of the translator's footnote comments relating to the above passage are: "These words are pure Micmac. Rand gives Mooin for "bear" (in his Dictionaries), while chiche is the inseparable suffix, very commonly used, meaning "little." Our author evidently believed that the Indians had independently named these constellations the Great and Little Bear, but one's first thought must be that this were too remarkable a coincidence, and the Indians must have obtained the names from early fishermen or other Europeans."
The identification of a Little Bear constellation by the Mi'kmaqs is somewhat problematic. There is every reason to believe the constellation of Ursa Minor (Little Bear) is a late Occidental invention; perhaps introduced to the Greeks from Phoenicia by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus circa 600 BCE. (According to the Greek historian Strabo (63/64 BCE - circa 24 CE) Ursa Minor (known as the Phoenician bear) was introduced as a superior navigational aid.) Mi'kmaq knowledge of a Little Bear constellation seems very much like a borrowing from Europeans.
Appendix 5: Quote from Legends of the Micmacs by Silas Rand, (2 Volumes, 1894), Volume 1, Pages 56-57.
"They have some knowledge of astronomy. They have watched the stars during their night excursions, or while laying wait for game. They know that the North Star does not move, and call it okwotunuguwa kulokuwech (the North Star). They have observed that the circumpolar stars never set. The call the Great Bear, (Muen (the Bear), and they have names for several other constellations. The morning star is ut'adabum and the seven stars ejulkuch. And "What do you call that?" asked a venerable old lady a short time ago, who, with her husband, the head chief of Cape Breton, was giving me a lecture on astronomy, on Nature's celestial globe, through the apertures of the wigwam. She was pointing to the Milky Way. "Oh, we call it the Milky Way, the milky road," said I. To my surprise she gave it the same name in Micmac."
For a critical discussion of Silas Rand see: Earth, Water, Air and Fire: Studies in Canadian Ethnohistory. edited by David McNab (1998).
Appendix 6: Quote from "Some Customs of the Micmacs." by Greta Bidlake (in Christian Guardian (a newspaper)) which appeared in The Register (a Nova Scotia newspaper) June 14, 1922. (The information is obviously taken from Silas Rand.)
"The Micmacs knew something of astronomy. They had observed that the North Star did not move and, more than that, they called it by a name which meant exactly what those two English words mean., They discovered, too, that the stars around the Pole star did not set and called several constellations by Indian names. It is a strange and puzzling fact that they spoke of the Great Bear as "Muen," the Micmac term for "bear" and of the Milky Way by a phrase which meant precisely the same as our English."
Appendix 7: Stansbury Hagar graduated from Yale University in 1892 and he graduated from the New York Law School in 1897. His work with the Mi'kmaqs is usually identified as being conducted in 1895, 1896, and 1897. At some time Stansbury Hagar obviously decided to gather some original ethnographic data and travel access to the Mi'kmaqs was rather easy. The first two research episodes usually identified i.e., 1895 and 1896, were conducted when he was enrolled at the New York Law school. It is difficult to believe that he was studying law "part-time." What other work he was perhaps doing at the time to support himself is not known. The third research episode was perhaps conducted after he had graduated from the New York Law School. (In fact his work with the Mi'kmaqs began as early as 1894. The New York Times for Wednesday, August 21, 1894, page 3?/8? reported that Stansbury Hagar gave a 30 minute address "Notes on the Customs and Traditions of the Micmacs" at the recent proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.) It is not known if he had conducted research with other Native American tribes prior to his work with the Mi'kmaqs. The research work seems to have been arranged by himself as an independent project. It is likely that it was his first experience as an (amateur) ethnologist. I have never seen a review of the competence of his work by an experienced professional ethnologist. At least in 1897 he had confidence in the reliability of Silas Rand.
Appendix 8: An entry on the "Star Lore of the Micmacs of Nova Scotia" by Stansbury Hagar appeared in Appleton's Annual Cyclopædia and Register of Important Events of the Year .... (1899, Page 46).
Appendix 9: The highly respected Canadian anthropologist Charles Barbeau (C. Marius Barbeau) ("The Field of European Folk-Lore in America." The Journal of American Folk-lore, Volume 32, 1919, Pages 185-197) identified 4 key "primary sources" of intrusive folk-tradition (in Native American lore). These are: (1) the Spanish elements located in the southwest, (2) the French elements located in the northeast, (3) the British elements located in the centre, and (4) the later German oral tradition (initially) located in the German colony in Pennsylvania beginning in 1683.
Appendix 10: "In 1954, Makemson extended her speculation about the power of primitive astronomy in ancient belief in an article in the Journal of Bible and Religion called, "Astronomy in Primitive Religion." Telling "a dramatic story of a distant past when religion included the worship of the celestial bodies," with evidence from China, Mesopotamia, ancient Rome,

Greece, and Egypt, Makemson drew on the work of the pioneer French archaeoastronomer Marcel Baudouin in analyzing a map of the stars in Ursa Major and Boötes incised on a fossilized sea-urchin amulet from stone-age northern Europe. "The representation," she asserted, "of Ursa Major...is remarkable for two reasons: first because the relative positions of the stars point to a very great antiquity for the amulet; and second, because the engraver has taken pains to indicate the difference in brightness of the stars, by varying the size of the cavities." After discussing a variety of star-worship artifacts, including a relatively contemporary account of a star cult reported by the "apostle to the Muslims," American missionary Sameul Zwemer, she concluded "that in general the various star-cults led ultimately to the seasons of the agricultural year, and to the sun from whose light and warmth all living creatures draw their sustenance."" (Source: Vassar Encyclopedia: (Entry) Maud W. Makemson, 2008 CJ, MH.)
Appendix 11: The earliest sources in chronological order are:
1643: Perhaps the earliest European reference identifying that a Native American people named the key 7 stars (Big Dipper) of Ursa Major a "a bear" appears Key to the Languages of America by Roger Williams (1643). Roger Williams (circa 1600circa 1683/4) was a British-born Baptist theologian who several times resided in North America. (He was the founder of the city of Providence, Rhode Island in New England). His (now very rare) first book Key to the Languages of America was written during a return voyage to England (and published in London). He briefly remarks that just as the Greeks and others call the 7 stars of the Big Dipper asterism the bear so do the Narragansett tribe of New England call these stars a bear. (The modern English quote is: "As the Greeks and other nations, and our selves call the seven stars, or Charles Wain, the bear; so do they [using the words] Mosk or Paukunnawaw, [which both mean] the bear.") (At least one other early source identifies that in the language of the Narragansett tribe the words mosk and paukúnauwaw both mean "a bear," and also have several other meanings.) However, Roger Williams also claimed he found their language had a great affinity with the Greek language.
1691: Quote from Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie by Father Chréstien Le Clerq (1691), Pages 135-136, (translated and edited by William Ganong (1910)). "Although our Indians exist in an ignorance so gross that, as we have said, they do not know how to read or how to write, they have nevertheless some knowledge of the Great and the Little Bears, which they call, the first Mouhinne, and the second Mouhinchiche, which mean exactly in our language the Great and the Little Bears. They say that the three guards of the North Star is a canoe in which three Indians are embarked to overtake this bear, but that unfortunately they have not been able to catch it." [Note: (1) This is hardly a detailed systematic description for purpose of comparison. (2) According to Stansbury Hagar the Mi'kmaqs identified 2 bear constellations to him.] Part of the translator's footnote comments relating to the above passage are: "These words are pure Micmac. Rand gives Mooin for "bear" (in his Dictionaries), while chiche is the inseparable suffix, very commonly used, meaning "little." Our author evidently believed that the Indians had independently named these constellations the Great and Little Bear, but one's first thought must be that this were too remarkable a coincidence, and the Indians must have obtained the names from early fishermen or other Europeans." In the few details set down by Father Chréstien Le Clerq in Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie (1691) it is not self-evident that the pursuit theme in connection with "this bear" means the Great Bear. No explicit mention is made of any pursuit of the Great Bear. The pursuit might well be connected with the Little Bear as the Three Hunters in a Canoe are stars belonging to that constellation. (Circling behaviour around the Great Bear is not mentioned.)
1712: In 1712 Cotton Mather wrote that he asked the Native Americans in Boston about their astronomical knowledge and was told that they always called the constellation known by the Europeans as "the bear" by the name of paukunnawaw, meaning "the bear." In the case of both Roger Williams and Cotton Mather we really have no knowledge of how critically the information was gathered, an assessment of their informants, and the reliability of both the information and the informants.
1850: The Baptist missionary Reverend Silas Rand (1810-1889) recorded in 1850 (A Short Statement of Facts Relating to the History, Manners, Customs, Language, and Literature of the Micmac Tribe of Indians in Nova Scotia.) that the Mi'kmaq call the Great Bear constellation, 'Muen' (the bear).
1900: Ignoring Nouvelle relation de la Gaspésie by the Recollect Order missionary Father Chréstien Le Clerq (1691) the 1900 article by Stansbury Hagar appears to be the sole source for the details of a Mi'kmaq celestial bear tale. This is unfortunate. (It is also unfortunate that he does not identify his sources. It appears the story was gathered whilst literally sitting around a number of Mi'kmaq camp-fires. There was no specific "follow-up" with the particular story-tellers.) (The celestial bear tale is not among the Mi'kmaq tales later collected (during 1915 and 1922) by the ethnologist Frank Speck. Nor is it included in Part Two: Folktales and Traditions of The Micmac Indians of Eastern Canada (1955) by Wilson Wallis and Ruth Wallis. The book, Part Two of which consists of 144 stories (137 being collected in 1912), was written by 2 ethnologists who had spent considerable time studying the Mi'kmaq since 1912.) Not answered is the question of whether the celestial bear story is a rigid embedded part of Mi'kmaq traditional culture.
Translation, and the tendency for 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century writers to dismiss/ignore and/or reframe what they heard and saw, created an unfortunate legacy. The term Euroform (introduced by Barbara Mann, 2000) means to reframe indigenous ways/knowledge/understanding/etc. and to force them into forms fitting European shapes. The issue is whether Euroforming was done in the early collection of Native American 'dipper' constellation stories.

Appendix 12: In the appendices of his book Man in Northeastern America (1946) Frederick Johnson mentions "A Micmac Manuscript." by John Prince (ICA-P, Quebec: 87-124). (Other sources give the reference as: ICA-P 15.i. 87-124.) Johnson states: "This manuscript was written in Indian-English by a Micmac Indian for Stansbury Hagar, just when is not stated." Other references to this document give the year as 1906 and also 1907.
Appendix 13: Social Sciences: An evaluation of "Micmac Customs and Traditions" (http://www.wangniao.net/bbs/read-htmtid-48828.html) posted 7 June, 2010. It seems to be a reproduction of an essay included in the databases of WriteWork, Data Researchers Network, and also Atlants.lv Internet Library (where the author is identified by the tern "taramanky").
A rare critical review/assessment of Hagar's investigative method (or lack of it) amongst the Mi'kmaq. Hagar would have been following the ethnological techniques and fashions of his day. Unfortunately I can not presently locate any details of the author. The review/assessment written in 2004 by a university student studying for a Bachelor's degree (in the social sciences?) It's style is similar to the Public Anthropology critiques of the (internet) Anthropology Journal Archive Project. It is valuable for its insights into the problems with Hagar's investigative approach. (In reproducing the essay I have only clarified some words.):
"An evaluation of "Micmac Customs and Traditions"
In his article " Micmac Customs and Traditions", Stansbury Hager ethnographically records some of the traditions and customs of the Micmac people. After a short introduction including the methods of collecting the data, as well as information about its source, Hager jumps right into a description of some Micmac traditions and customs. He begins with a description of "a system of communication [for use] while in the woods" (Hager 1895:31) followed by an extensive description of a complex board game, named "wŏltĕstômkwŏn", played by the Micmac (Hager 1895:31-35). Following this is a description of the Micmac's version of football named "tooâdijik" (what we now refer to as soccer) (Hager 1895:35-36). Hager then goes on to describe the serpent dance, named "choogichoo yajik", which is then related to similar practices and beliefs held by other native groups of North America. He points out that the similarities are likely indicative of a somewhat shared heritage among the native groups. Hager exemplifies this point with folk-tales, one of which closely resembles another told by the Chippewa natives (Hager 1895:40). A small conclusion is included at the end of this article containing a short commentary on how, "in spite of the years of research [...,] the knowledge of these myths is rapidly disappearing" (42). In whole, this article is reminiscence of the historical particularism viewpoint.
Although it is difficult to place this article into a specific school or tradition, I believe it comes from historical particularism (typical to the school of American anthropology) because, other than the fact the article is published in "The American Anthropologist" (a possible, yet unreliable, indicator), it deems a focus on the traditions and customs of a group of people as a valid study. Another indicator that further indicates a categorization of historical particularism is the author's use of comparison with other native groups of North America as he describes the similarities between legends told by the Micmac and other native groups. In doing comparisons such as these, Hager illustrates the likely connections between the groups and the shared heritage and past. In addition to this, he includes the example of the game of football which illustrates how new activities can be introduced and how they gradually become part of the culture. Though the article makes no note as to its origin, I could guess that priests or missionaries may have introduced it as a replacement for banned traditional practices.
This article is primarily ethnographic as it focuses on the description of the Micmac, however it is partially ethnologic in the sections about the Serpent Dance and Micmac folklore. In the example of the Serpent Dance, the existence of the rattlesnake symbol among native groups is discussed and related to evidence of shared folklore and dances. In further support of this, the folk story of the water fairies is told which has been found to be a "variant of the Chippewa legend of the 'Magic Circlein the Prairie'", in which the "under world of the stars" is replaced with the "underworld of the sea" (Hager 1895:40). Otherthan these few ethnologic comparisons, Hager sticks to a primarily ethnologic approach.
The data is written in third person narrative with short interjections of first person where the author is present. The data for the article was collected from two local informants, Abram and Newell Glode, who were interviewed while Hager visited Digby (Hager 1895:31). What resulted was a description of nearly lost customs and traditions that, in 1895, were rarely seen. Little was written about the way of life or the current traditions and customs of the Micmac. Perhaps only traditional customs, those held by the Micmac previous to exploration, were considered appropriate to report on. The author says little about the circumstances in the field but implies that is was fairly easy to find the answers to his questions as his informant were "eager and interested in being questioned" (Hager 1895:31). The article contains some discussion as to the meanings and significance of the traditions but none seem to be from the author's point of view. Any interpretations appear to have come directly from the informants as is the case the description of the meaning of wŏltĕstômkwŏn (Hager 1895:37). Much of the data presented by Hager is written in ethnographic present and if it were not for a few statements by Hager, one may think that these traditions were still dominant during Hager's research. For the case of the Serpent Dance, much had already been forgotten. For example, the song that goes with the dance, as the tradition was practiced less and less frequently, was forgotten, yet in reading the description, one may be lead to believe the dance was still a common practice. Male bias is also present in the article. Indications of this are that male-dominated traditions are the only ones described in this article. This is likely due to the fact that both Hager and his informants were male and this male bias was also a common trend for the period in which this article was written.

The article doesn't appear to stem from any of the great debates of its time. Instead it seems to result from the belief that native groups and their traditions were quickly disappearing and that they had to be recorded before they were lost forever. This created a type of salvage anthropology. In this particular article the style of writing seems to emphasis the quick disappearance of the traditions of the Micmac and the need to record them before they vanish. This article also supports the idea of rationality among all people as the Micmac traditions and customs are described in a way that shows their actions to be logical. One example of this is the game of "wŏltĕstômkwŏn" in which there are complex rules and a distinct beginning and end to the game. It is mostly a game of chance, however a certain degree of strategy is required in order to succeed.
In general Hager seems to have a fair amount of respect towards his informants as they are presented as a valuable, reliable and useful commodity. Within the article Hager does not question or argue against the descriptions or interpretations given to him by his informants. He also does not directly quote them but, based upon the research design, it can be said that much of the article is just a re-wording of their statements. A certain degree of ethnocentrism is also present. The natives are not portrayed as savages but their way of life is considered inferior. The disappearance of their traditions and customs is by no means portrayed as a tragedy but instead as the result of change and influences on their culture. Hager's views in this regard may be influenced by his anthropological training caused by the school of historical particularism where culture is seen as a mixing of elements based largely on the environment. The changes could be explained as a diffusion of some of the European ways into the culture of the Micmac. Hager refers to the Micmac as being misfortuned by the priest who forbade them from attending the public schools which caused the real tragedy in that they were not allowed to learn the "Roman characters" (the alphabet) (Hager 1895:31). Despite all the description of the traditions of the Micmac, only the tradition of football was still a common practice at the time this article was written and in its description a rather crude practice is mentioned where by " scalping was anciently employed as a means of disposing of an opponent" (Hager 1895:36). This makes the traditional ways of the natives look quite gruesome and savage and in turn, as it changed (likely as a result of European priest), it emphasizes the now more civilized way of playing the game.
Hager is not arguing with another writer, nor is he critical of another view or theory. He presents no new methods or theories. In writing this article he only succeeds in describing a small selection of Micmac traditions and in supporting some commonly held beliefs from his time - that all people are rational, culture is an agglomeration of elements and can change largely over time, and the idea that native cultures are rapidly disappearing they must be recorded before they are assimilated into the broader culture. Put simply, Hager's goal was to describe a selection of Micmac traditions and customs before the informants were gone.

Appendix 14: Abraham (Abram) Glode: Without Stansbury Hagar indicating that the Abram Glode he interviewed in 1894 was 73 years old when Hagar published his paper in 1895 it would be very difficult to identify with any certainty which Abram Glode was meant. This age information indicates the Abram Glode that was the informant/consultant to Hagar was born circa 1822. Using the, 1891 Census of Canada it is possible to identify Abraham Glode born circa 1821, spouse: Nillie Glode, residence: Digby, Nova Scotia. For the 1892 Census his age was given as 70 years old and that of Nillie Glode as 40 years old. Their 2 children were Nenel Glode (20 years old in 1891) and Stephen Glode (10 years old in 1891). The problem is that Nenel does not seem to equal Newell. Also, it would make Nenel/Newell very young for lecturing in New York City in 1890 (perhaps 19 years old). At time of publication of several articles in 1888 he would perhaps be 17 years old. Also, I am unsure how he could be a tribal elder at such a young age.
Appendix 15: Abraham (Abram) Glode as a Common Name in Nova Scotia and Source of Possible Confusion: As example: Abraham (Abram) Glode (born 1.April.1867, Nova Scotia-died 25.September.1932, Springhill, Cumberland, Nova Scotia) died aged 65 years, after being in poor health for some time. Cause of death was carcinoma of the stomach and intestines. Abram Glode was a farmer. He married Ann McGrath, possibly in Maine. (Annie McGrath had 2 sisters; Mary and Elizabeth McGrath.) It appears Ann McGrath was previously married to Joseph Privell (a Native American, married possibly in Maine). Abram Glode and Ann had 2 daughters (Lena May Glode (1902-1990) (Mrs Stephen Gilroy of Fenwick), and Annie, still at home in 1932) and 2 sons (George Dewey, a stepson (George of Maccan), and James (circa 1921-1999), still at home in 1932). (Lena was born in Newville. She was 28 years old, single, living at home in Newville, Roman Catholic when she married Stanley Albert Gilroy, 22 years old, farmer, Baptist, born in Linden, living in Stanley. They married 4-March-1930, St Brigid's Rectory.) Abram Glode's usual residence for many years later in life was Newville. It appears that following his death his wife resided at Halfway River, Nova Scotia. He died in All Saint's Hospital and his funeral service and burial was held 3 days later (27.9.1932) at St. Brigid's (Catholic) Church (Parrsboro, Nova Scotia). The undertaker was Stanley W. Smith. Strangely, neither Lena May nor George Dewey mention a sister. James Glode was a foster son. (He was born in Halfway River. His mother was Sarah Knockwood.) He served overseas during WWII, with the Carleton York Regiment. He worked at the Sifto Salt Plant for 30 years, retiring in 1978. He married Beluah Chapman and they had 3 daughters and 2 sons. He died 6.10.1999 aged 78 years, in Highland View Regional Hospital, Armherst (heart disease?/stroke?). See: Springhill Record, Thursday, September 29, 1932, Page 5; Cumberland County death registrations, Halifax, Nova Scotia; The Halifax Herald Limited, Thursday, October 7, 1999.
Appendix 16: The Mi'kmaq Name Glode: Glode was a common Mi'kmaq surname. It has been seen as a form of the French Glodeau but originally it is from the Latin Claudius (English, Claude). Glodeau appears as a French name in Acadia/Nova Scotia. The name Glode was one of the (French) names given by the French clergy to the Mi'kmaqs who were first baptised

in the early 1600s. When Mi'kmaq bands began to convert to Catholicism in 1610, the Mi'kmaq converts were given French names at baptism and introduced to the concept of a first name and a surname. (The Mi'kmaqs were converted to Roman Catholocism in the 17th-century by French missionaries.) Surnames were created by taking the original Micmac name as a last name. However, this later became complicated when children began taking their father's first Christian name as their last name. The result is there are many Mi'kmaq families with surnames such as Peter, Paul, Tony, etc., many of whom were not related to others with the same family name. Mi'kmaqs also adopted the surnames of hunters and explorers for whom they acted as guides. It has also been mentioned that in mixed marriages children took the name of their Acadian father. (It is generally recognised that nearly all present-day Mi'kmaqs (and likely the case circa the 1900s) have Acadian "blood." The name Claude was common among the Mi'kmaqs of Nova Scotia. Claude became Glode. They would usually write it as Glode, but their were several variant spellings. The Mi'kmaqs gave the French C a gutteral sound, like G, Claude became Glode. The French "au" is pronounced "o." Newal (Noel), and Glode (Claude) appear in the Indian list for the year 1855 [NSARM, MG15, Volume 5, Number 69] in Chester and Gold River district.

Appendix 17: The Greek Bear Constellation: As early as Homer's time the group of stars comprising the modern-day asterism the 'dipper' was known to the Greeks as the 'Bear,' (not the 'Great Bear'). Also, to Homer the Bear is female. A tradition exists that the 'Little Bear' was introduced to the Greeks by Thales (circa 600 BCE) in his book Nautical Astronomy. However, the book is also attributed to Phocus of Samos. Homer knew the 7 stars of the 'dipper' as both the 'bear' and the 'chariot' or 'wain.' This is the earliest reference to the constellation of the (Great) Bear. (The double name of the 7 stars of the 'dipper' asterism, '(great) bear'/'wagon' has resulted in 2 different names to the constellation that follows it: Arktouros "bear-watcher" and boötes "the wagoner.") It is apparent that the designation 'chariot' or 'wain' is Babylonian in origin. (Wain = a wagon or cart, usually four wheeled.) Perhaps the Bear is to be dated to the Greek Archaic Period.
Thales was reported to have introduced Ursa Minor (Little Bear) as a constellation for Greek mariners in place of Ursa Major (Great Bear). The Little Bear star group was originally designated 'Phoinike' by the Greeks.
For Homer and Hesiod the bear constellation seems to have been the only recognised constellation in the northern sky.
The origin of the Bear constellation in Greek uranography remains unknown. The name and constellation are usually discussed in the context of being borrowed by the Greeks. However, there were populations of Eurasian brown bears in ancient Anatolia and ancient Greece and Macedonia.
A theory that is still promoted is the constellation title originated in prehistoric times among the Indo-Europeans. It is claimed that the earliest known religions were those of the bear cults. However, The origin of the Greek Bear constellation may be connected to the myth of Callisto. To the ancient Greeks, Ursa Major represented Callisto (Kallisto). The bear was an (totemic) animal sacred to the cult of Artemis. The goddess Artemis had a bear cult in Attica. The name Artemis is possibly related to the Greek word ārktos meaning "bear." Homer was familiar with Artemis as the Mistress of Animals. (Principally Artemis was a goddess of animals and hunting.) A cult title of the goddess Artemis was Calliste/Kalliste (Artemis Kalliste) (= Callisto?). It is understood that the story about Callisto was originally about Artemis. The popular Greek goddess Artemis originated in the pre-Greek era. Artemis worshipers were found all over the ancient Greek world. "The identification of the constellation of the Bear with Artemis occurs at PGM VII. 687. The Great Bear was believed to be Callistro, Artemis' fellow huntress, who was transformed into a constellation. Callistro was a manifestation of Artemis

herself, who play an important role as a she-bear, especially at Brauronia." [This refers to the bear cult of Artemis at Brauron.] (The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation by Hans Betz (1996, Page 333).)
In Greek mythology the goddess Artemis is involved in the origin of 3 prominent constellations: Ursa Major (the Great Bear), Ursa Minor (the Little Bear), and Orion (the Hunter). According to late Greek myth Ursa Minor is the son of Callistro. (Artemis by Claire O'Neil (2007, see pages 35-39).) See also the discussion: Blomberg, Peter. (2007).

C : Chalcolithic / Early Bronze Age Levant Constellations
3: Lion iconography as constellation?
Introduction
The term Levant is most usually intended - geographically and historically - to define the western area of the Near East, along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
In her 2002 doctoral thesis The moon and stars of the southern Levant at Gezer and Megiddo: Cultural astronomy in Chalcolithic/Early and Middle Bronze Ages. (based on her archaeological experience at both sites) Sara Gardner identifies certain pavement drawings at Gezer and Megiddo as representations of constellations. (Particularly a drawing of a lion at Gezer which dates from 1600 BCE and another drawing of a lion at Megiddo which is dated to the Chalcolithic Period.) Sara Gardner holds that astronomy was used in the southern Levant before any significant contact with the civilisations of either Egypt or Mesopotamia. However, it is generally accepted that in the Jamdat Nasr period particularly, i.e., about 3200 BCE the evidence of cylinder seal impressions found in Megiddo and in Byblos shows there was strong Mesopotamian influence in the Levant in what is now modern-day Syria and Palestine. This is also recognised as the time during which the art of late Predynastic Egypt was being assimilated to Mesopotamian models.
There is no evidence for the constellation Leo existing in Mesopotamia in the 3rd-millennium BCE. I am not aware of any textual evidence for a Sumerian lion constellation at this early period (i.e., 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE). Any claim for such relies on cylinder seal iconography. It is not established that constellations/constellation symbols are being depicted on any early cylinder seals. The earliest solid reference (i.e., textual evidence) to a lion constellation in Mesopotamia is Hilprecht's Nippur Text (HS 245 (= HS 229)) which is dated to the Cassite Period circa 1530-1160 BCE. Any claim for an earlier lion constellation in the Levant likely indicates an independent origin.
The idea that credible 3rd-millennium BCE constellation and astral material may be found outside of Mesopotamia is worth investigation. It may be that early Middle East constellations made their way into Mesopotamia. The earliest mention of the lion constellation (Leo) in Mesopotamia is in the astrolabe genre.
The inclusion of a discussion of the possible identification of a symplegma constellation comprising a wolf on the back of a bull (comprising the stars of Ursa Major) was not proceeded with by Gardner. It was felt the evidence would not withstand critical scrutiny. The constellation section of Gardner's doctoral dissertation dealt only with the possible identification of Leo and Orion. A possible dual-figure wolf-bull constellation in the early Middle East is likely to be as speculative as Willy Hartner's hypothetical dual-figure lion-bull constellation in the early Near East. Interestingly, it would appear that in the iconography of northern Medieval Europe the biblical lion was represented by a wolf. The wolf is an established figure in Old Norse mythology.
The southern Levant basically encompasses the territory of modern-day Israel and Jordan. The Chalcolithic Period covers circa 4500-3500 BCE; the Early Bronze Age covers circa 3000-2000 BCE; and the Middle Bronze Age covers circa 20001500 BCE. Two important archaeological sites are at Gezer and Megiddo. Gezer is located on the edge of the foothills of the Judean Range, 3 km south south east of Ramaleh. Megiddo is the only site in the southern Levant that is mentioned by every great power in the ancient Near East. This is undoubtedly because Megiddo guarded the Via Maria - the important highway that connected Egypt with Mesopotamia.
Images of the sun, the moon and the stars are common decoration motifs in the southern Levant from as early as the Chalcolithic Period. As decorating motifs they are found on pavements, walls, pottery, and seals.

Abstract: "Astronomical images are found on monumental structures and decorative art, and metaphorically in seasonal myths, and are documented by calendars. In Israel and the southern Levant, images of the sun, the moon, and the stars were common decorating motifs. They were found on walls, pottery, and seals and date to as early as the Chalcolithic period; for example, the wall painting of a star at Teleilat Ghassul (North 1961). This dissertation establishes that the people of the Levant were aware of the apparent movement of the sun, and this will be discussed in Chapter 4. They began recording through representation drawings, astronomical phenomena no later than the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age and continued to do so late into the Middle Bronze Age. The argument moves beyond the simple use of symbols to the use of images to represent constellations, with the focus on the constellation Leo in Chapter 5. Furthermore, the use of astronomy as a power and political tool is also suggested in Chapter 6. Nonetheless, the primary purpose that is addressed here is the tendency in Syro-Palestinian archaeology has been to attribute technological evidence found in the northern and southern Levant as diffused from Egypt or Assyria, particularly astronomy. This dissertation firmly establishes that astronomy was used in the southern Levant before any significant contact with the civilizations of Egypt or Assyria."

Teleilat el-Ghassul
An example of the use of the star motif is the numerous star depictions found at Teleilat el-Ghassul (an archaeological site in modern-day Jordan, located in the lower Jordan Valley northeast of, and close to, the Dead Sea) dating to the 4th millennium BCE. (The uppermost level, Ghassul IV, existed until the beginning of the Bronze Age period.) The main design motif at Teleilat el-Ghassul is an elaborate eight-pointed star. Teleilat el-Ghassul was occupied till circa 2000 BCE. The undistinguished 50-acre site is the largest known Chalcolithic site in the Jordan Valley. The murals with the star depictions were discovered during the 1931-1932 and 1932-1933 excavations.
Eight-pointed star painted on interior wall at Teleilat el-Ghassul. It is called the 'Star Painting' of Teleilat el-Ghassul. If I understand correctly, the large Star Painting was destroyed during a failed attempt to detach it from the wall. Importantly, for a possible explanation of the eight-pointed star at Teleilat el-Ghassul, see: "Die Erde als Stern des Kosmos im vierten Jahrtausend am Toten Meer (telēlāt ghassūl)." by Eckhard Unger (Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palastina-Vereins (1953-), Band 77, 1961, Pages 72-86).
A particular example of the star as a decoration motif is the particular wall sized painting (mural) of a star at Teleilat elGhassul. Inside one building there is an unusual wall painting of an eight-pointed "star" within a larger eight-pointed "star," culminating in a burst of eight rays. This most outstanding wall painting is the so-called Star of Ghassul. It is almost 2 metres across and is surrounded by various mythological creatures. The star is painted with red, black, and white mineral paints. The function of this particular painting is unknown. Andrea Polcaro has suggested that the large Ghassulian Star Painting of a big star is identifiable with the Sun. (The only important astral objects it can likely be identified with are the Sun or Venus.)

"Fresco fragments were executed in many rooms, and it was assumed that the paintings were executed in a domestic context. These wall paintings, it should be noted, were not single creations. Rather, they were continuously plastered over and repainted. ... It has recent been speculated that the painted rooms were in fact shrines situated within the dense building clusters. ... The most remarkable segment is the star fresco. It consists of a large eight pointed [i.e., rayed] star, 1.84 meters in diameter. [It is located on a west wall that is opposite an eastern entrance.] Its center is composed of concentric circles and contains two more eight-pointed stars. The innermost star is white on a black background; the second is white, bordered with black, on a red cross-hatched background; and the outermost star has alternating red and black rays. [The star is surrounded by depictions of masks, animals, and temples and these testify to the cultic nature of the painting and the room.] The execution is most precise." (Rivka Gonen "The Chalcolithic Period." In: Amnon Ben-Tor (Editor). The Archaeology of Ancient Israel. (1992) (Chapter 3).)
In another building, on the west wall, a painted wall mural depicts a row of people (the first two of whom are seated) and a luminary (either the sun or the moon, and indicated by a double circle) rising above what are obviously mountains. Also, there is a (faint) depiction of a rayed sun or star behind a another person. It is possible that a cultic ceremony is being depicted.
The culture predominant in the Levant during the Chalcolithic period in Palestine is known as the 'Ghassulian Culture' named after Teleilat el-Ghassul. The Ghassullian culture has been identified in numerous places in what is now southern Israel, especially in the area of Beersheba. The settlement at Teleilat el-Ghassul occupied a large area and was perhaps the primary settlement in the southern Levant. The function of the houses with paintings Teleilat el-Ghassul remains controversial.
Gezer
The Gezer site has 10 standing stones and a cave that has drawings of the stones against a horizon that presently still exists (or did circa 2000 CE). The Gezer site dates from circa 2900-1600 BCE. The cave dates back to circa 2900 BCE.
A votive altar (incense altar) with a star-motif (star-like object) on it was discovered at Gezer. The star-motif (star-like object) is in the field (or background). Included in this particular iconography is a badly drawn lion with a man. According to one interpretation the lion in the foreground is being slain. The lion is depicted with a shoulder ornament (a second star) that may have an astral significance. The shoulder ornament (star) has been interpreted as the star Regulus, which also marks the shoulder of the lion constellation Leo. However, the depiction of shoulder (or body) ornaments on lions does not conclusively demonstrate an astral significance. The application of example-by-example analysis throughout the ancient Near East indicates that the depiction of shoulder ornamentation on lions can denote (but not always) an astral significance. This votive altar at Gezer (with badly drawn lion and star-like object) has been incorrectly dated to circa 7th-century BCE but correctly is to be dated to circa 1600 BCE-1400 BCE. A lion figure is also etched on a paving stone at Megiddo and dated to the Early Bronze Age.
Sara Gardner (personal communication, 5-March-2001) advised that the lion appears at Gezer in 1400 BCE in a drawing with a star on the shoulder and above its back This motif is repeated in constant use until at least circa 800 BCE. (Note: Helene Kantor ("The Shoulder Ornament of Near Eastern Lions", Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 6, Number 4, October, 1947, Pages 250-274) holds that the shoulder ornament depicted on lions designates a constellation. However, it appears there are 2 types of shoulder ornaments on lions - one being interpreted as a planet designation i.e., Venus = Inanna. See also: "The Lion with Body Markings in Oriental Art" by Anne Vollgraff-Roes, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 12, Number 1, January, 1953, Pages 40-49.)

A depiction on a votive altar at Gezer is comprised of a badly drawn lion with a man, with a star-like object in the background. The lion is depicted with a shoulder ornament that can denote (but not always) an astral significance. This votive altar (and iconography) at Gezer has been incorrectly dated to circa 7th-century BCE by some but correctly is dated to 1400 BCE. (See: Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel by O. Keel and C. Uehlinger (1998, Page 331, Figure 372.) Sara Gardner believes that the star-like object depicted in the background above the lion is the sun rising at the time of the summer solstice above the constellation of the lion. (She believes the ornament (astral image) on the body of the lion is most probably the star Regulus or the heart of the lion.) (The identification of lion iconography with the constellation Leo is not uncommon speculation.) A different plausible interpretation is that the star-like object above the lion is Venus.
Franz Kugler in his booklet Sibyllinischer Sternkampf und Phaėthon in naturgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung (1927) shows that in the ancient Near East the lion was associated with Venus as morning star. The identification with a comet has also been made.
According to Sara Gardner, the lion depicted on the votive altar at Gezer was positioned as it would have been seen rising above the horizon as the lion constellation, i.e., with the head upwards.
The Gezer lion is discussed within an astronomical context in Religion in Judah under the Assyrians by John McKay (1973). It formed part of his PhD dissertation. The scope of the astral discussion is quite wide ranging. McKay interprets the drawing as the lion being slain. McKay thinks the shoulder star on the Gezer lion may be the "King Star" Regulus (mul LUGAL). McKay also refers to another similar lion on a plaque from Tell es-Safi but provides no illustration. Sara Gardner (personal communication, 10 April 2001) comments: "... that the Gezer lion is not being slain in 1400 BCE, prior to Assyrian contact and/or occupation. Furthermore the lion from Megiddo dates to 3300 BCE, a firm date. It is most probably "the lion of wrath" that is associated with Judah. By the Assyrian occupation, if you look at the seals from Assyrian (sic) the lion is being slain by the king perhaps. But that is not to say that the Israelites will have the same perspective. I would agree that [the] Assyrians alter the imaging to the king defeating the lion because we have too many images that demonstrate that. But that is not applicable to the images from Syria to Judah at these early periods."
Note: On some depictions of the Assurbanipal lion hunting reliefs the lion being slain by the Neo-Assyrian period king has a hair whorl in the star shape. However, hair whorls may be naturalistic detail.
An excellent scholarly text on ancient Near Eastern and Greek and Roman symbolism is Dictionary of Symbolism by Hans Bierdermann (1992). It is based on Knaurs Lexicon der Symbole and was translated into English by James Hulbert. The German-language edition by Hans Bierdermann (1930-1990) was published 1989.
Megiddo
The Megiddo site has 36 drawing found as of circa 2000. Among the drawings Sara Gardner identifies several with stars, comets, and a crescent moon. The Megiddo site date is circa 3300 BCE.
Paving stones at the Bronze Age city of Megiddo are believed by Sara Gardner to contain representations of astral images. The date of the pavement at Megiddo where the figures appear date to the Chalcolithic Period (3400-3300 BCE).

Megiddo has a large paved open area sloping eastwards toward Mount Tabor and Mount Moreh. A stone altar was situated in the centre of the pavement. Thirty-six of the paving stones located at the stone altar (at the cult centre at Megiddo) are incised with a variety of figures (both human and animal) and geometric shapes. Five are astral symbols that include representations of stars, comets, and the crescent moon. A lion figure is also etched on a paving stone at Megiddo (dated by some to the Early Bronze Age). Sara Gardner holds that the constellation Leo appears on the Chalcolithic pavements at Megiddo (dating to 3,300 BCE). "To date the earliest image of a single lion juxtaposed across from a man is found at Megiddo. Generally, the man is identified as either a fallen enemy or a king/hero (The moon and stars of the southern Levant at Gezer and Megiddo by Sara Gardner (2002, Page 133)."
Three of the figures at the stone altar have astral symbols: (1) a figure with a harp (lyre) ("Megiddo Harper") in upraised left hand appears with the crescent moon to his right; (2) a star symbol appears to the right of 3 human figures (which partly surround it); and (3) a star appears together with an irregular rectangle. (These are dated circa 3300 BCE.) Sara Gardner identifies the figure of a Harper at Megiddo with the constellation Orion.
Sara Gardner's interpretation of the lion and fallen man (enemy?) iconography at Megiddo as a constellation depiction (imposed over the constellation Leo). She believes the lion constellation can be dated to the Chalcolithic Period in the southern Levant. In her interpretation the lion is equivalent to the zodiacal Leo. The man is usually identified as a fallen enemy or king/hero. The top right 'streaming' shape is believed by Sara Gardner to be a depiction of a comet, possibly Halley's comet.

Reception
A presentation on the Standing Stones of Gezer was presented (1998) at the ASOR (The American Schools of Oriental Research) annual meeting (Stream: A5, Hebrew Bible, History, and Archaeology) and then at the Oxford VI conference. The audience at the Oxford VI conference (held in the town of La Laguna on the island of Tenerife, Spain, 1999) proved more skeptical. This is unsurprising. There is the involvement of considerable speculation in the formation of Sara Gardner's ideas.
Presentation 1998 ASOR Annual Meeting (San Antonio, Texas, November 16-19): The Gezer Standing Stone, Cave 30: IV Graffiti and Joshua 120:12-13: Astronomical Observatory and Astral Records. Abstract: "Archaeoastronomy provides principles through which we can understand the place of the standing stones at Gezer in Canaanite and Israelite culture: not as stone monuments or stone deities, but as astronomical monuments used to regulate calendars and marl important celestial events such as the solstices, equinoxes, and lunar standstills. The standing stones at Gezer were placed on a True North/South alignment and the alter on the west side of the stones faced east to the direction of the equinoxes, which indicates that the stones were used for astronomical observation. The placement of the stones is not the only evidence though. Joshua 10:12-13 recorded the phenomena of the sun and moon standing still at Gibeon and the valley of Aijalon, and both standstills would have been visible on the northeastern horizon as viewed from behind the standing stones at Gezer. Furthermore, in Cave 30:IV graffiti was found by Macalister around a ledge at approximately eye level, and several of the drawings show the standing stones in relationship to the eastern or western horizon with animals rising above them. These

animals represented constellations as the ancient Canaanites perceived them, not as the modern constellations we see today. This evidence demonstrates that Gezer was an astronomical observation site."
Essays From, Archaeoastronomy & Ethnoastronomy News, the Quarterly Bulletin of the Center for Archaeoastronomy, Number 31, March Equinox, 1999; News Notes: "LUNAR STANDSTILLS? Sara L. Gardner a graduate student at the University of Arizona, has speculated that the text from Joshua 10: 12-13 provided the earliest mention of this phenomenon. She also suggested that the site of Gezer in Israel with its standing stones might have been a place from which such observation were made. She presented her data on Gezer at the 1998 American Schools of Oriental Research Conference in Orlando where it was well-received, including the text connection between Joshua and lunar standstills. The biblical scholars at this conference accepted her data as evidence that the people of Gezer had a basic knowledge of astronomy. With the help of Ray White of Steward Observatory, the data show that the ten standing stones at Gezer mark the June solstice, equinoxes and the southern lunar excusion (sic, [excursion]), all within 1 degree. The stones date to 1600 BCE. Nearby drawings in a cave that show how the stones were used date to before 2900 BCE, before Egyptian contact with this site. The Joshua text doesn't fit with Gezer as the place of his observation, but the organization of this site indicates the type of observations were made."
Leopard Temple
In a recent posting on the Internet (2009) Sara Gardner stated she also believes the "Leopard temple" in the Negev (semidesert region of southern Israel) and Sinai (desert land that is Israel's border with Egypt) are celestial images on the ground but is currently unable to make any further interpretation. The so-called "Leopard temple" in the Uvda Valley in the Negev is dated to circa 7,000 BCE, and amongst the stones bearing carvings of feline figures there is also a carving of a leopard. The leopard was identified by having darker stones to emphasise where the spots were. (The leopard was common in the Levant in biblical times and survived in Palestine up till at least circa 1950. A small population of Sinai leopards still exist (2007) in the Sinai Peninsula.)
Miscellaneous Evidence for Early Canaanite Astral Mythology and Astral Worship (Astral Gods/Goddesses)
Canaanite astral beliefs precede the Assyrian period of domination beginning circa 6th-century BCE. The kings of Judah became associated with astral cults. The newer astral cults became popular in the 8th-century BCE. The astral cults (star worship and other cults) purged by Josiah (king of Judah, 7th-century BCE) may have had their origins in the indigenous religion of Northwest Semitic culture or in the imperial religion of Assyria. Prior to the time of Assyrian domination the Palestinian mother-goddess in her own right had astral attributes, and was sometimes regarded as an astral goddess (Queen of Heaven). She was represented as an astral goddess at Ugarit, Megiddo, Gezer, Bethshan, and Tell es-Safi. On a bronze plague from Ras Shamra (Ugarit) the mother goddess is portrayed standing on the back of a lion which has a star imprinted on its shoulder. It is thought that this star was likely Regulus. The evidence suggests the sun cult at least was Canaanite rather than Assyrian. More widely, it seems indicated that the roots of Baal (a Canaanite storm god), sun and moon (Moon god) worship existed in pre-Assyrian Judean cultic practice. (The worship of the sun was widespread throughout the ancient Near East. The most famous of the approximately 6 (known) Canaaanite sun cult sites is Beth-Shemesh ('house of the sun').)
The god 'Athtar in the Baal poems is identified with Venus as the morning star in Canaanite religion.
Astral medallions in the form of an 8-rayed star, centrally placed inside a bowl, goes back to the Canaanite religious and artistic background of the Bronze age (possibly a Phoenician motif).
At Ugarit, the occurrences of the terms kbkb and kbkbn in the context of several passages makes it clear they refer to luminaries in the night sky, in a religious context. (See: R. E. Whitaker, A Concordance of the Ugaritic Literature (1972, Page 343).)
Anne Jeffers believes (Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria (1996)) that the Ugaritic material shows that astrology was widely spread and practised at a very early time. Also, that there are quite definite traces of Israelite) astrology during the pre-exilic period. The use of a lunar-solar calendar in the Old Testament times necessitated reasonably precise astronomical data. In addition to knowledge of elementary astronomy, astral religion was widespread in the Ancient Near East, including the Israelite world (for example the worship of the "Queen of Heaven" in Judah at the end of the 7thcentury BCE). This mother-goddess was also characterized as an astral goddess at Ugarit, Megiddo, Gezer, Beth-shan, and Tell es-Safi. Later prophetic invective against astral worship shows the extent to which astral worship was an integral part of the popular practice of Israelite religion.
The astral god kakkab was worshipped at Ebla.
An unprovenanced astronomical bowl (possibly from ancient Syria) in the Shlomo Moussaieff collection (he is a businessman and antiquities collector) depicts Orion as a hero and the Pleiades as '7 dots.' The possibility (but uncertain) that the Pleiades is depicted on a terracotta model shrine from Tell el-Farah North (Stratum VIIb) 11th-10th century BCE has been discussed by William Dever (See: Dever, William. (1994) "The Silence of the Text: An Archaeological Commentary on 2 Kings 23." In: Coogan, M[?]. et al. (Editors). Scripture and Other Artefacts – Essays on the Bible and Archaeology in Honor of Philip J. King. (Pages143-168).) Above the entrance to the shrine a crescent moon with multiple dots is depicted.

However, Peter van der Veen comments that Dever's case for this interpretation is not strong and contrary evidence has been raised by W[?]. Zwickel.
The stars of the Pleiades were often associated with Tanit, the Phoenician 'mother earth.'
Astral gods/goddesses were widely established/venerated in ancient Southern Arabia where an astral cult known as Sabaeanism prevailed. The religion of South Arabia was essentially a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moongod prevailed.
Archaeological evidence supports the existence of early astral cults in ancient Israel. As well as at Gezer and Megiddo, motifs of stars have been found at Ugarit and Beth-shan. Anne Jeffers (Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria (1996, Page 154)): "The words designating stars, moon or sun, or even constellation seem to be part of a common stock of semitic (sic) words." All this before the Assyrian conquest in the 8th-century BCE. In 732 BCE king Tiglath-Pileser conquered and annexed large portions of northern Israel. All but the small kingdoms of Palestine were conquered by Assyria by circa 725 BCE. In 701 BCE the Assyrians, under king Sennacherib returned, devastated Judah and occupied the province.
The Song of Deborah in Judges 5:20, and the statement in Joshua 10:12c-13c, make an indirect reference (former), and a direct reference (latter), to the belief in the influence/intervention of stars upon human events. Anne Jeffers Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria (1996, Page 155)): "The "star worship" mentioned by the Deuteronomist should not be understood as worship of the stars per se, but as evidence that the stars and constellations were studied and that conclusions were drawn from them. The Ugaritic texts certainly attest to such a practice and even list it among the things educated people are supposed to know about."
The period of Assyrian vassalage saw the revival/development of astral cults in Judah. This was accompanied by the building of altars (2 Kings 21:5) and the manufacture of suitable cult objects for the host of heaven (2 Kings 23:4). A reference to the cult of the host of heaven appears in Zephaniah 1:5. (The host of heaven = starry host = the celestial bodies.) Manasseh, king of Judah 697(co-regent with his father until 687)-642 BCE) built altars in Jerusalem for the 'host of heaven' (2 Kings 21:5). People also built rooftop altars. (Cultic practice included burning incense.) There is general agreement that Assyria's imperial astral cult, whether by imposition (obligation) or imitation (assimilation), influenced the development of astral cults in Judah (including star worship). The word mazzālōt (= 'constellations' or perhaps 'planets' (which were worshipped throughout the Near East)) may reflect Assyrian astrological practice. It is indicated that Ahaz (king of Judah, 8th-century BCE) introduced Assyrian astral cult practice. During the reign of Manasseh and Josiah in the 7th-century BCE (of a completely independent Judah) Judah was the submissive ally of Assyria.
That the Pleiades played some part in astral religion in Israel is hinted at by the 8th-century BCE. The Pleiades and Orion (with some other astral bodies) appear to have become objects of worship. According to Peter van der Veen, astral worship (Israelite and Judahite local cult(s)) was mostly limited to the monarchy period only, and originated under the influence of foreign nations (neo-Assyrian period and Babylonian period). He states that astral worship seems especially to have been dominant in Juhadite state worship during the reign of Manasseh (697-642 BCE), who as an Assyrian vassal may well have adopted important elements of the religion of his foreign overlords. (See: van der Veen, Peter. (2008). "The "Seven Dots" on Mesopotamian and Southern Levantine Seals – An Overview." In: Reinhold, Gotthard. (Editor). Die Zahl Sieben Alten Orient: Studien zur Zahlensymbolik in der Bibel und ihrer altorientalischen Umwelt. (Pages 11-22).)
West Semitic religion has been influenced by astral religion. Astral mythology appears in the Old Testament in Isaiah 14:12ff in a fragmentary form; and is based on the Canaanite and Phoenician myth describing the fall of the "Dog Star, Son of Dawn."
The existence of a strong indigenous astral element in Syria, the Levant, and Mesopotamia is indicated. In ancient Ugarit and Judah astral religion, at one time, held a place of importance before being displaced by other god's cults. Not known is whether there was an archaic West Semitic astral cult or whether astralization was introduced by the impact of the Assyrian conquest. However, the existence of a small (18cm diameter, 3.5cm deep) bronze Aramaic bowl (dated circa 8th-century BCE) portraying an astral scene involving constellations, is evidence for the the existence and antiquity of a strong Aramean or West Semitic astronomical tradition. The astral scene depicting constellations is not a "sky map" (an actual astral scene is not depicted) but is perhaps based on a "sky map." It is likely the bowl was used for astral divination. See: "Another Look at an Aramaic Astral Bowl." by K. Lawson Younger Junior (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 71, Number 2, October 2012, Pages 209-230).

Summary
Sara Gardner only identifies 1 figure at Gezer as an astral image. This is the lion figure from circa 1600 BCE onwards which she connects with the stars of our constellation Leo. Sara Gardner does not identify any other drawings at Gezer, such as the drawings of animals (referred to as graffiti) in Cave 30:IV at Gezer, as representations of constellations. (There is a possibility though that additionally the animal graffiti in Cave 30:IV can also be identified as constellations.) Sara Gardner identifies 2 constellation figures at Megiddo from circa 3300 BCE onwards: (1) lion, and (2) harper. Needless to say these constellation identifications are somewhat subjective. There is a possibility if the examples given for constellations are actually late they may have been influenced by Babylonian uranography.

Note: See also: Goldfarb, Amanda. (2013). "Reinterpreting Iconography with Astronomy." (Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Volume 50, Pages 215-236). [Abstract: "This paper focuses on Canaanite and Phoenician iconographical depictions of astronomical events. It draws on star mapping programmes that provide new insights into the ancient night sky. It is argued that well-known narratives such as the lion/bull attack, common in the Near East, had astronomical significance. The different depictions of seasonal events - especially those decorating metal bowls - indicate that artefacts bore multivalent iconographies often with clear astronomical associations. Phoenicians and Canaanites practised at least a basic level of observational astronomy, although their mathematical determinations remain conjectural." Likely an extension of her (2012) MA thesis (University of Melbourne), Canaanite and Phoenician Astronomy: From the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. Abstract: "The Phoenicians and Canaanites were renowned sailors, and have long been hailed as excellent astronomers by ancient writers such as Strabo and Aratus. Owing to their well-known maritime expertise, even today’s scholars assume their knowledge of the night sky to have been great. Yet very little modern study has been dedicated to determining the extent of their astronomical knowledge — were they just observational astronomers, or was there a more mathematical approach undertaken? It is thus the purpose of this thesis to introduce the topic and identify evidence of Canaanite and Phoenician astronomy. Both cultures had pantheons featuring astral gods and a rich mythology known today only through fragments. In order to determine if these astral gods are indicative of Canaanite and Phoenician practices, these pantheons were studied in comparison to contemporary Mesopotamian and Egyptian religions (as they were both known to practise observational astronomy). Ancient calendars were also reviewed, as these could indicate an understanding of the solar versus lunar year. From this assessment, it became clear that many important deities within the Canaanite and Phoenician cultures had astronomical significance — they were associated with planets, constellations and weather phenomena. Furthermore, it appears they had luni-solar calendars, akin to the Mesopotamians, indicating the importance of the moon, rather than the sun, as a time-keeping object. Armed with this knowledge, Canaanite and Phoenician iconography was then examined, in order to determine if well-known narratives, such as the lion/bull attack scenes (common over the Near East), had any possible astronomical significance. After reviewing several differing iconographical narratives, it was determined that there were clear astronomical associations apparent on artefacts with multivalent iconographies. The equinoxes, solstices and even eclipses were represented on bowls and mugs, found from Ugarit through to Italy, crafted by Phoenician and Canaanite tradesmen. While no mathematical approaches could be determined from this study, it was possible to show (rather than hypothesise) that the Phoenicians and Canaanites practised at least a basic level of observational astronomy."]

The use of astronomy by the inhabitants of Palestine has interested scholars as early as the turn of this century, when their examination of biblical texts led them to make comparisons with Greek and Mesopotamian astronomy and mythology. About twenty years later mythological tablets (13th century BCE) were found at Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) on the coast of Syria in 1929. The language and syntax of the Ugaritic tablets are similar to the Bible, and mythological motifs of the Ugaritic texts reflect motifs of biblical and extra-biblical texts. For example, they recorded how the gods influenced the changing seasons, and how the god of the Hebrews created the seasons in Genesis. Extra- biblical texts are used to study the development of Jewish astronomy and its calendar in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE. The list is lengthy, but the Astronomical Books of Enoch should be mentioned. They were written in the 2nd century BCE, and described the heavens

as they were perceived by the ancient Jews. The ancient Hebrew literature as well as archaeological artifacts are rich in astral imaging.
Astral images began in the Chalcolithic period (4500-3300 BCE) at Teleilat Ghassul in Jordan near the Jordan River. The Ghassul Star, the image of a luminary rising above the mountains, and a faint image of a rayed sun or star behind a worshiper testify to an understanding of astronomy in this early period. Astral images continued throughout the history of ancient Palestine at many sites such as Hazor where instruments that marked the path of the sun, moon or star were depicted; for example, an altar showed a star image rising above two columns, and a stele showed the moon rising above two arms and hands that were postured as columns. The data collection of astral images from literature and artifacts is extensive, but nonetheless, this information has not been collected into a study on the practice of astronomy and/or its role in society. Nonetheless, these studies are prolific when compared to studies on the relationship between architecture and the movement of the sun, moon, and stars. Research to date has established one site, Rujim el-Hiri (Golan Heights in northern Israel), was built for the primary purpose of marking the June solstice from approximately 3000-2000 BCE, but its potential as an astronomical observatory has not been fully developed (Mizrachi 1993: 112-18).
The primary interest of biblical scholars is to establish a precise orientation of the entrances of temples to the eastern horizon, or to establish that there is not an orientation. Excavators are cavalier in their interpretations, and casually remark that the entrance of cult building or its cult object caught the rays of the rising sun--without any substantiating studies. Unfortunately, excavation records do not consistently record precise directions, either True or magnetic north (see Taylor 1993). While numerous scholars insist that orientation of temples should be studied, these calls have not mentioned what the premise for orientation should be-- beyond an assumption that the cardinal directions are somehow important.
Problems for scholarship exist beyond the collection of data and its interpretation for the land of the Bible, because it conflicts with current religious beliefs. The primary sources for data come from sacred Hebrew and Christian writings--the Torah and the Bible--and from sites mentioned in these texts. Research has in the past--and continues now--to be an exercise in proving that the modern interpretation of the Torah and the Bible is literal and written in stone, so to speak, while a few scholars approach the subject from an academic perspective and not religious. If research in archaeoastronomy in Palestine is to be initiated, it must be from a secular perspective such as Syro-Palestinian archaeology led by William G. Dever (1990). Through the combination of biblical and extra-biblical texts, astral images found on artifacts, archaeology, and astronomy the potential exists to open a new rich field of study for archaeo/ethnoastronomy as well as add another chapter in the history of astronomy.

Appendix 2
The Levant is technically the Eastern Mediterranean region. The Levant is a geographical term referring to the large geographical region bordering the Mediterranean, roughly between Egypt and Anatolia (modern Turkey). The area encompassed lies south of the Taurus Mountains, is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east. (It stretches 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert, and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert.) The term Levant normally does not include Anatolia (although at times Cilicia may be included), the Caucasus Mountains, Mesopotamia or any part of the Arabian Peninsula proper. The Sinai Peninsula is sometimes included.
The Levant has a record of continuous human existence beginning circa 90,000 BCE. Neanderthals are known to have lived in the Levant. Agriculture is first attested during the Neolithic Age (10,000–4300 BCE). During the Chalcolithic Age (43003300 BCE) people occupying the Levant became urbanized and lived in city-states, including Jericho. Some of the world's earliest known cities were established in the Levant.
During the Uruk phase, colonists and traders from Southern Iraq established important quarters in settlements throughout the northern part of the Levantine region (e.g. Amuq). The East Semitic Akkadians living on the Arabic peninsula north of the Sumerian city-states invaded the lower Mesopotamian valley under Sargon I and established their supremacy over the Sumerians, and extended their control into Syria as far as the coast.
The area's location at the center of routes linking three continents made it the meeting place for religious and cultural influences from Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor.

The Sumerian term mul.mul "The Stars" (= Pleiades) occurs in a Sumerian-Eblaite list as an equivalent of the Eblaite term mul ka-ma-tu "The Family." Four more entries in lexical lists from may be names for stars in Sumerian. (Of the 15,000 tablets recovered from Ebla approximately 80% are written in Sumerian. The date of the tablets is circa 2250 BCE.)
Also, the astral god kakkab was worshipped at Ebla.
During the 3rd-millennium BCE the city of Ebla in Syria was the third ranking civilization centre in the Near East. The 2 two higher ranking civilization centres were Mesopotamia (Bilad al-Rafidayn, the cradle of civilisation) and Pharaonic Egypt.

During the Late Bronze Age (circa 1375-1175 BCE) in Syria (at least in Emar, a town on the Syrian Euphrates) the transmission of Babylonian/Assyrian scholarship was enabled through the activities of diviners, who acted as high-ranking scribes and cultic functionaries. This was undoubtedly a means for communicating the astral sciences also.

Recent (2010) archaeological finds in the northern Jordan Valley indicate that the ancient site of Pella was a formidable citystate and urbanised (a massive mega-city) circa 3600 BCE until civilisation there abruptly stopped circa 2800 BCE (due to possibly a devastating earthquake and climate change).

The site name, Rujm el-Hiri, means "stone heap of the wild cats" in Arabic. More recently, the site name, Galgal Refaim/Gilgal Refa'im, meaning the "wheel of ghosts" (wheel of giants"?) in Hebrew, was given. The site was first discovered just northeast of the Sea of Galilee in the Golan Heights area of Israel during an archaeological survey conducted in 1967-1968 after the Six-Day War (in which Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria). Following the survey, fullscale archaeological excavations were carried out from 1989 to 1992 by Moshe Kochavi and Yonathan Mizrachi through the Land of Geshur Project of Tel Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology.

Rujm el-Hiri stands upon a land dotted with ancient dolmens or tombs dated before the great urban centers of civilization arose in Mesopotamia and Egypt. It consists of a series of 4 concentric circles (or 5 or 9, depending how counted). At its centre is a tumulus (artificial burial mound) of stone 20 metres (65 feet) in diameter and 4.5 metres (15 feet) tall. It has been identified as a ceremonial complex. It is located 515 metres above sea level on the Golan Heights approximately 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the Sea of Galilee, Syria. Based on the few artifacts recovered it was originally dated to circa 3000 BCE (Late Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age).
Descriptions of the site tend to vary somewhat.
Description 1: The site consists of a 158.5 metre (520 foot) diameter circle of basalt stones, encompassing 4 smaller, concentric circles of stacked stone walls that become progressively narrower in width. The walls of the circles are connected perpendicularly by variously placed smaller stone walls. Altogether the stone walls are made up of an estimated 37,500 metric tons of partially worked stone, with the walls presently standing up to 2 metres (6.6 feet) in height, with the outer wall as high as 2.5 metres (8 feet). It is thought by archaeologists that these are the remains of massive walls that once rose as much as high as 30 feet. It is an enormous feat of construction. In the center of this concentric structure lies the central tumulus or cairn (interpreted as a tomb) built of smaller stones. No human remains were found within the tomb (but it was likely subject to tomb robbers). At the core of the tumulus is a buried dolmen, or burial monument, consisting of two 1.5 metre (5-foot) tall standing stones that support a large horizontal stone. The dolmen overlies a chamber, connected to a 3 metre (10 foot) long access corridor.
Description 2: The concentric circles are constructed from an estimated 42,000 rocks/stones (uncut, black volcanic basalt, field stones); piled and wedged into place. The outermost circle is 150 metres (490 feet) in diameter (measured north-south). (Note: Other measurements given are 155 metres (500 feet) north-south.) The walls are between 3.2-3.3 metres (10.5-10.8 feet) thick, and in places reach 2.5 metres (8 feet) in height. (Note: Other measurements given are the walls reach a height of 2 metres (6 feet) in places.) Some of the rings are connected by a series of 36 apparently randomly spaced spoke-like walls, which comprise chambers. The central burial mound, built 1000-1500 years after the construction of the rings (the Late Bronze Age of the late 2nd millennium BCE) is an irregular stone heap measuring some 20-25 metres (65-80 feet) in diameter and 4.5-5 metres (15-16 feet) in height. There are 2 wide access ways, blocked by fallen boulders, (northeastern opening about 29 metres (95 feet) wide; southeastern opening about 26 metres (85 feet) wide.) into the rings.
The circular structure was built with dimensions and scales common for other structures of the period. It is indicated it was at least in part – built for an astronomical purpose. Research indicates the structure is partly based on the positions of stars. It has been suggested the site was used for observations of stars/constellations for aiding religious calculations. After lengthy studies beginning in the late 1980s, Yonathan Mizrachi and Anthony Aveni proposed the structure could have served an astronomical purpose. Their investigations have shown the entrance way to the center is aligned to the summer solstice. Notches in the walls suggest the spring and fall equinoxes are indicated. Calculations for when the proposed astronomical alignments would have matched stars gives further support for the construction of the rings being dated to circa 3000 BCE. If the wall notches pointed to star-risings they may have been a method for predicting the rainy season (important for pastoralists herding livestock, with concerns for pasture/forage and water).
Abstract: Aveni, Anthony. And Yonathan, Mizrachi. (1998). "The Geometry and Astronomy of Rujm el-Hiri: a Megalithic Site in the Southern Levant." (Journal of Field Archaeology, Volume 25, Number 4, Pages 475-496).: "Research at Rujm elHiri, a Bronze Age megalithic monument in the southern Levant provides a broad insight into two episodes in the prehistory of the Levant—the construction and usage of the Early Bronze Age (EBA) ceremonial complex, and the erection of a cairn at the center of the monument some 1500 years later. (The last use of Rujm el-Hiri was no later than 1500-1200 BCE (the Late Bronze Age).) Excavations in 1988–1991 provide information on Rujm el-Hiri's geometry, alignment associations between the architecture of the complex and celestial bodies and events, physical elements in the landscape, and local ecology-related phenomena. We also examine the significance of timekeeping and its implications for the agricultural calendar and cosmological domains of the local cultures. Data drawn from archaeological, astronomical, ethnohistorical, and biblical sources reveal the sophistication of the 3rd millennium B.C. construction phase of the Rujm el-Hiri complex. Among the finds reported are the systematic use of a measuring unit to construct the site; the establishment of an accurate alignment system for both celestial and non-celestial elements in the landscape; the organization of an orientation calendar as a basis for economic activities; and the hints of a rich cosmology. Overall, our study of the Rujm el-Hiri megalithic phenomena reveals a level of cultural complexity not previously documented in the Levant of the 3rd millennium B.C."
The site, and other ancient settlements nearby, were originally dated by archaeologists to the Early Bronze Age II (30002700 BCE) time period. This dating was based on artefact finds. A reassessment was made when the site was later excavated by Yosef Garfinkel and Michael Freikman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2007. Freikman also returned in 2010 to further investigate the site's date and function. Michael Freikman suggested that the tomb in the centre, thought to have been built in the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 B.C.) was built at the same time as the rings. He also proposed that the site was built for both funerary purposes and as a means for "excarnation," the removal of flesh from the bones of the deceased for placement in ossuaries, or bone boxes, by the ancient Chalcolithic inhabitants of the area.
The function of Rujm el-Hiri is not known. One theory is it served as a landmark for a mortuary cult associated with an important leader or religious figure. The paucity of artifacts recovered indicates the site was not used as either a residence or as a storage facility. A recent theory by Dr. Rami Arav attempts to take into account the archaeological evidence at the site and also the cultural contexts of ancient Chalcolithic practices and the surrounding Chalcolithic archaeological sites. In an

article published in the Biblical Archaeology Review (November/December, 2011), Dr. Rami Arav, long-time co-director of the Bethsaida excavations northeast of the coast of the Sea of Galilee and Professor of Religion and Philosophy at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, proposed that the site was built for both funerary purposes and as a means for "excarnation," the removal of flesh from the bones of the deceased for placement in ossuaries, or bone boxes, by the ancient Chalcolithic inhabitants of the area.
Appendix 9
Numerous interpretations have been proposed for the functions of the enigmatic tower and wall (dating to circa 8300 BCE) at Early Neolithic Jericho. They comprise the oldest known monumental structures. One explanation proposes they comprise a cultic (a ritual precinct and/or astronomical device). Ran Barkai and Roy Liran propose the Jericho tower is aligned to celestial (the summer solstice sunset; and helped to keep a calendar when agriculture was beginning to be introduced) and geographical elements (i.e., the Mount Quruntul peak some 1300 metres to the west, and rising 350 metres above sea level), and was used by its builders as a link between the town and the universe. The Jericho tower rises to a height of 8.25 metres from its base and has a base diameter of approximately 9 metres and a top diameter of approximately 7 metres. The Jericho tower is hollow and inside is an enclosed stairway (comprising a climbing system for the builders). As an astronomical instrument (if this is the correct interpretation) it enabled Mount Quruntul and the setting sun to be revered by a single 'instrument.' (See: "Midsummer Sunset at Neolithic Jericho." by Ran Barkai and Roy Liran (Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture, Volume 1, Issue 3, November, 2008, Pages 273-284).)

Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop - Notre Dame X, July 6-10, 2011. Morgan Saletta, Melbourne University (Presentation): "The Functional Equinoctial Alignment of the Arles-Fontvieille Monuments: The Equinoctial Hierophany, the Pleiades, and Orion."
Abstract: "Based on my ongoing research into the sites, I will present evidence of a functional solar equinoxal alignment of the Arles/Fontvieille monuments. I will also suggest a probable association with the Pleiades and the constellation of Orion of at least one of the sites. The talk will present evidence for both claims, including photographic documentation of a functional and hitherto undocumented purpose of the astronomical alignment of the sites. The functional nature of the equinoctial alignment can presently be demonstrated for three of the five sites.
The large and impressive Neolithic monuments of Arles/Fontvieille appear to have been at the center of a major local megalithic culture that extended its influence over the local territory as evidenced in the orientation of megalithic monuments of the surrounding area. These monuments, frequently termed hypogées, are some of the largest, most impressive, and probably among the most important Neolithic monuments in France and Europe.
These subterranean monuments are aligned on an east/west axis, opening on the west. It will be proposed that these monuments have a functional astronomical alignment to the equinox sunset such that a large shaft of sunlight penetrates the long passage and strikes the back wall, producing a striking hierophany. There is a spectacular display of illumination in the one site whose opening is unobscured by plant growth and is visibly present at two of the others. Unlike the so-called passage tombs or passage mounds of the British Isles, Ireland, and Brittany, the Arles/Fontvieille monuments are subterranean, and it is not at all obvious that it would be possible for the sun rays to penetrate these passages or hypogées at all, at least to any depth, let alone to their entire length as documented by the author.
While the east/west orientation of the monuments has been noted by several authors as being toward the setting equinox sun, and recently researchers have highlighted this unusual orientation within the context of European and Mediterranean megalithic orientations, the possible functional (in terms of producing a hierophany) nature of this alignment seems to have been entirely ignored for a number of reasons, including the difficulty of access to all but one of the sites.
It is my contention that in order to understand the place of these important monuments within the European Neolithic, the discovery of a functional phenomenon of the astronomical alignment of these sites is of fundamental importance. It may shed light on the relationship of these sites to other European monuments as well as indicating the need for similar investigations of sites where such phenomenon may have been overlooked in the past. To this purpose these sites need to be examined within a large geographical context and within an analysis of the way cosmological knowledge, ritual practice, belief, and social power were constructed into the landscape and territory in the form of these monuments."

:DEarly Mesopotamian Constellations
4: Sumerian constellations and star names?
Gudea cylinder A. The two Gudea cylinders (both enormous hollow clay cylinders) and thousands of clay tablets were excavated by the French at Lagash between 1877 and 1900. Both Gudea cylinder A and Gudea cylinder B are held in the Louvre museum, Paris. The Cylinders of Gudea are the longest continuous Sumerian text. They are both inscribed with lengthy hymns to the god Ningirsu (= Ninuta) and his temple at Lagash. They were among the first Sumerian monuments to be recovered. Lagash was one of the oldest Sumerian cities in the state of Lagash, and in the late 3rd-millennium BCE was also one of the largest cities in the world, if not the largest.
Sumer (incorrectly, Sumeria) was a region of city-states (not a country).
Some time after 4000 BCE the Sumerians migrated from the northeast of Mesopotamia to the southernmost coastal region of of Mesopotamia (the floodplain along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers of modern-day southern Iraq and Kuwait). Small settlements of farmers had already occupied this area during the 5thmillennium BCE. There is no evidence the Sumerians had a formal academic discipline of astronomy. The number and variety of of Sumerian names for stars/constellations does not prove the existence of a Sumerian uranography. Babylonian astronomy in the 2nd-millennium BCE likely developed rapidly without a Sumerian antecedent.

It is a widely held popular belief that the constellations and the zodiac originated with the Sumerians circa 3000 BCE. This is wrong on both counts. The existence of reasonable evidence for Sumerian constellations and star names dating to the 3rd-millennium BCE has been lacking until recently. The topic still remains controversial and somewhat speculative. It cannot even be said that we have an indirect knowledge of Sumerian astronomy. The best evidence for early Mesopotamian constellations and star names still remains with texts dated to the 2nd-millennium BCE (circa 1800 BCE). There is no evidence of any established system of any of astral omens or astronomy in the Sumerian sources. There are no cuneiform texts from the 3rd-millennium BCE containing records of astronomical observations. However, the eminent assyriologist Hermann Hunger ("The Cultic Calendars of the Ancient Near East." in The Journal of the American Oriental Society, October-December, 1996) states: "While there is no doubt that the sky was observed in Sumerian times for the purpose of omens and probably also in connection with cultic actions, this is not astronomy, which involves measuring and computing." Systematic astronomical observations are not indicated as being part of Sumerian tradition. Their cosmology contains mythic elements. The extent to which Sumerian myths related to astronomical objects i.e., planets, remains uncertain.
There is no formal astronomy in Sumerian texts. Sumerian literary texts, however, contain astronomical references. (Some knowledge of Sumerian astronomy exists in literary texts and references to calendars.) The Sumerian term UDU.IDIM.MES (Akkadian bibbu) = wild sheep = planets. In the religious text NannaSuen Hymn 1 (Sumerian period, 3rd-millennium BCE), the mention of cows is an allusion to the stars in the night sky. (Nanna-Suen (Bronze Age Mesopotamian moon god) Hymn I (of 15 hymns to Nanna-Suen known) has a section on stars and cows. There is an allusion to stars and planets as cattle and the sky as a cattle pen. In a later text the sun and the moon are herdsmen who keep the sky ordered. There is no evidence that the Sumerians were familiar with domes. For the Sumerians the sky is like the curved roof of a cattle pen.) In the religious text the Exaltation of Istar (Middle Babylonian period, circa 1150-1000 BCE), the sun and moon are herdsmen keeping the stars (as cattle) in their order.
"The scribes of the Old Babylonian period were very zealous copyists and went to great lengths to preserve the literature that came down to them from the past, especially the archives of the Third Dynasty at Ur [the Neo-Sumerian Empire, 22nd to 21st century BCE]. There were as well, however, many marvellous and original works put together by these Akkadian scribes themselves." ("Syro-Mesopotamia: The Old Babylonian Period" by Ronald Veenker. In: Mesopotamia and the Bible edited by Mark Chavalas and K. Younger Junior. (2002; Pages 149-167, Page 163).
Evidence for Sumerian celestial observation consists of: (1) calendar establishment and regulation, (2) likely observations of the heliacal risings of particular stars, and (3) their knowledge that Venus was both a morning and evening star.
Evidence for Sumerian celestial divination consists of: (1) the association of the goddess Nisaba with the stars, and (2) Nisaba consulting a star tablet for guidance on architectural matters. (One commentator writes: "A tablet decorated with stars is mentioned among Nisaba's scribal tools.")
Evidence for Sumerian star names/constellations consists of: (1) the goddess Nisaba consulting a star tablet, (2) the earliest kings in The Sumerian King List sharing names with constellations, and (3) fragments of star lists/constellation mentions may go back to the 3rd-millennium BCE.
The earliest known astral name in Mesopotamia is for Venus and dates to the early 3rd millennium BCE. Circa 3500 BCE the Sumerians recognised Venus was both a morning and evening star. The Sumerian Inanna myth, centred on the city of Uruk, is readily interpretable as referring to the periodic disappearance of the planet Venus from sight in the western sky and the planet's later reappearance in the eastern sky. Also, the two epithets húd 'morning' and sig 'evening' describe the goddess Inanna (Venus) as two manifestations of the planet Venus, one shining in the morning sky and one shining in the evening sky. Bendt Alster believed astronomical observations could be discerned in Sumerian compositions dated as early as circa 3500 BCE, which refer to the movement of the heavenly bodies and the constellations. Note: It is worth noting that the assyriologist Lorenzo Verderame has pointed out that in Mesopotamian civilisation oral communication was the main method of transmitting tradition. Writing was an addition, not an alternative/substitution for oral transmission of knowledge.

Circa 3300-3200 BCE A cylinder seal from the Uruk period in the Eldermeyer Collection has 3 star symbols at the top which may represent the Sun, Moon, and Venus. The cylinder seal also contains 2 symmetrical curved signs, one star, and a reed pole with a pennon - corresponding to the symbol for Inanna. The decipherment may be dingir.Inanna.Údsig = "Goddess Inanna [star] of sunrise and sunset." (The earliest symbol for Inanna is a tall bundle of reed stalks, tapered upwards, tied in 3 places, rolled (at the top) into a ring ('knot') on the outside, or with a pennon at the top.)
Circa 3000 BCE (Archaic Period) the Sumerians were able to regulate an intercalated lunar calendar by inserting a 13th lunar month approximately every third year.
Circa 3000 BCE there may have been knowledge of the 1.6 year synodic period of Venus, also the 8 year synodic period of Venus.
Circa 2900 BCE Sumerian pictographic texts discovered on monuments of the Sumerian city-states Uruk and Jemdet Nasr refer to the 29th century BCE, show evidence of calendar inscriptions and records of the rising and setting of Venus, and (supposedly) delineations of several constellations.
Circa 2900-2700 BCE (Early Dynastic I period) a highly schematic cylinder seal showing an animal and a star. (See: The Sumerian World edited by Harriet Crawford (2013, page 323).)
Circa 2700 BCE the goddess Nisiba [note: early and current spelling Nisiba but now usually spelled Nisaba or Nidaba] (the patron goddess of scribes, and also the goddess of the agricultural cycle) had a knowledge of astronomy attributed to her and her temple in Ereš was called the "House of the Stars." She had a lapis-lazuli tablet which is sometimes called the "tablet with the stars of the heavens" or "tablet with the stars of the pure heavens." It was kept in her "House of Wisdom." It is possible that this lapis-lazuli tablet - which was connected with astronomy - was a kind of star-map or symbolic representation of the heavens.
Circa 2400 BCE Sumerian records provide evidence for the government practice of arbitrarily inserting calendar months to keep in order to keep the traditional month of the barley harvest (Nisanu of the Babylonians) in the harvest season.
Circa 2200 BCE Cylinder A of Gudea has a reference to the heliacal rising of a star marking the month. It has been speculated that the star was possibly Aldebaran (though this does not mean that the constellation of Taurus was established). A system of named stars is also indicated. (Also, recognition of Nidaba mul ku-ba as constellation of the 'corn-goddess'?)
Circa 2100 BCE Šulgi, king of Ur (reigned circa 2100 to circa 2150 BCE), recorded that he had learned how to calculate the appearance of the new moon while a student in a scribal school. Also in the Post Sargonic/Ur III Period the Sumerian term "house" (é) is (apparently) used to denote the celestial positioning of the moon. (Hermann Hunger ("The Cultic Calendars of the ancient Near East." in The Journal of the American Oriental Society, October-December, 1996) makes the informed and elucidating comment: "I find it misleading to mention the zodiac (and its subdivisions), which was invented around 400 B.C., in connection with the term "house" of the moon, since the meaning in the older texts is clearly not the same as in the younger. Even if the passages quoted refer to places in the sky, they could not be defined by fixed stars, because the moon is not in the same place on the same calendar date each year. Also, e-[u.sub.4]-7 seems to me to mean "house of day seven" and not "seventh house." And that could be a building on earth, as are the other "houses of the moon" mentioned.")
For the possibility that 2 lunar eclipses described in EAE 20 and 21 date to the Ur III period, and incorporate observational material, see particularly the discussion: "On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology." by V. G. Gurzadyan (Akkadica, Volume 119-120, 2000, Pages 175-184).
One of the earliest and clearest references to a celestial sign dates to the Sumerian Gudea Cylinder A where the goddess Nisaba tells Gudea, with a sign sent in the form of a bright star, when to begin construction of Ningirsu's temple. Also, several lines of inscription on Gudea Cylinder A, in a section dealing with his commission to build the Eninu [Eninnu], suggest astronomical observations in the 3rd-millennium BCE. (The clay cylinders of Gudea, known as Cylinder A and Cylinder B comprise a very important text corpus. They were found as foundation deposits in the temple Eninus [Eninnus] devoted to the god Ningirsu. Both the cylinders contain texts devoted to the achievements of Gudea (a king). The texts are quite long with

about 1300 lines each. They are the most ancient complete Sumerian literary composition and are an important source for understanding Sumerian. (The language on the cylinders is actually called New Sumerian. Most of our present knowledge of Sumerian is derived from texts in an era in which Sumerian as a spoken language was already extinct.) The assyriologist Francesca Rochberg believes the poetic inscription describing Gudea's building of Ningirsu's temple suggests the existence of dream omens, extispicy, and even celestial signs, and places divination in the context of a temple building ritual.

BCE. (The lexical series Urra = hubullu) in its classical 24tablet form known from first millennium exemplars, presents lists of Sumerian entries and their Akkadian equivalents.)

Discussed in 2.2 Pre-Old Babylonian Celestial Sciences (Pages 32-43). Cooley states: "There are no celestial-science texts extant from the pre-OB periods." On pages 33-42 the author discusses evidence of celestial observation and celestial divination.

Studies in Astronomy and Its History Offered to Salvo De Meis. (Pages 51-67). According to Gebhard Selz, in the dream vision of Gudea (and its interpretation by the goddess Nanše, the dream-interpreter of the gods) the shining stars of heaven are perceived as divine writing providing ominous signs and revealing divine schemes (ĝarza). The underlying notion is that of the sky being the writing tablet of the gods. (Page 65): "This article has demonstrated that not only the motion of the planet Venus was known around the time when writing was invented, but that already in the 22nd century BCE the concept of the stars as Heavenly Writing was securely established. Presently we are not able to date with more precision when writing and the heavenly stars entered this close connection. However, there can be no doubt that already during the 3rd millennium Sumerian astrology – astronomy gained a considerable significance. The references to the dub mul-an, and in elliptic use the mul-an, are clear forerunners of the Babylonian šiṭir šamê, the Heavenly Writing. The fact that at least two kings are attested to "have become a star" some time after their death shows close parallels to the apotheosis of the Roman emperors. The locomotion of the dead Mesopotamian kings was certainly "symbolized" by rituals, probably involving a boat journey and / or perhaps by setting free a bird. The connection the Heavenly Writing has to the Sumerian concepts of the 'Me' and the Ĝarza is noteworthy, albeit not yet entirely clear. Being stars, these kings became elements of the Heavenly Writing and their afterlife was thus ensured for eternity. Their names were inscribed into the eternal heavenly tablet.")
The latter paper by the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz is an important discussion of the topic. The Sumerian literary work Enki and the World Order (288-289) refers to two constellations. These are "The Field" (= the Pegasus-square) and "The Chariot." Cylinder B of Gudea (ix, 15) refers to the chariot of Ningirsu ("The Chariot" constellation mul.giš gigir). He also expresses the possibility that constellation/star names written in Sumerian but appearing in late texts may actually be genuine survivors from the 3rd-millennium BCE. The name of the "Bull of Heaven" (mul gu4.an.na) in the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven has the same name as the bull constellation Taurus. In the epic Lugalbanda I there are two references (201-3, and 484) to "morning star(s). Two Sumerian hymns to the Moon-god indicate knowledge of stellar movement where mention is made that Nanna-Suen herds cattle (= herds stars). The term cattle meaning stars is obvious from the passage.
Wayne Horowitz concludes ("Some Thoughts on Sumerian Star-Names and Sumerian Astronomy." In: An Experienced Scribe Who Neglects Nothing, edited by Yitzhak Sefati et. al. (2005)): (1) Sumerian texts, dating back to the time of the earliest archives of cuneiform texts, do directly and indirectly indicate evidence of astronomical/astrological activities. (2) The state of present cuneiform evidence indicates that the Sumerians of the 3rd- and 4th-millennium BCE had no formal system of astral sciences (astronomy/astrology) that can be compared to astronomy/astrology in Akkadian texts of the 2nd-millennium BCE. There is no evidence that Mul.Apin is a compendium of late-Sumerian astronomical lore or that the astrolabes derive from lateSumerian astral lore.
The Spanish Sumerologist Miguel Civil, (1926-2019), writing on the influence of astronomy in Mesopotamian agriculture in his book, The Farmer's Instructions: A Sumerian Agricultural Manual (1994) translates line 38 (pages 30/31): "Once the sky constellations are right, do not be reluctant to take the oxen force to the field many times." (See also page 79 of the Commentary.) The manual comprising 111 lines was restored from 9 fragments and dates to circa 1500 BCE (perhaps 1700 BCE).

Steinkeller. et al. (Pages 131-147). The article has been described as a sophisticated take on astral underpinnings in (Sumerian) mythology.
The Old Babylonian Period (circa 1800-1500 BCE)
The astral sciences of the Old Babylonian Period include:

(1) Star lists (2 examples are known).
(2) Astral omens (12-13 tablets containing a variety of astral omens are known).
(3) A quantification of the change in the length (duration) of day and night over the course of the year.
(4) The oldest surviving mathematical-astronomical work - the Venus tablet record (Tablet 63 of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil dealing with the appearance and disappearance of Venus (and related omens), over 21 years.)
Note: The Babylonian astronomers of the late 2nd-millennium BCE had an understanding of the basic rules of the motion of Venus and the other planets.
The earliest evidence of extensive astronomical/astral activity in Mesopotamia is found in the great omen series Enūma Anu Enlil (the major series of celestial and atmospheric omens). This series comprises omens for both astronomical and meteorological events such as lunar and solar eclipses, the appearances of planets, and thunder and lightning. It is generally believed that, whilst astral omens had long been studied during the second millennium BCE, the omen series was not compiled in its final form until the beginning of the first millennium BCE. Tablet 63 of the Enūma Anu Enlil series, frequently referred to as the "Venus Tablet of Ammiṣaduqa," contains a sequence of omens derived from the first appearance and the first disappearance of the planet Venus. Unlike other omens in this series, however, they are associated with specific dates covering 21 years in the reign of King Ammiṣaduqa of the Babylonian First Dynasty. Because of this association, it has been suggested that these omens relate to actual observations of the movements of Venus. However, this would be unusual, omen statements are not reports of actual observations, but refer only to potentially observable events. This is made clear from the large number of omens that relate to celestial events which are in fact impossible.
Appendix 1: Problems with use of Sumerian words.
Sumerian existed as a language until circa 2500 BCE. Then it was replaced by Akkadian. Circa 800 BCE Aramaic then became the dominant language; then circa 550 BCE, Persian. Sumerian words continued to be used throughout the Akkadian period (in poetry, legal, astronomical, and mathematical texts). Akkadian continued to be used up until about the 1st-century CE as the language of scholars, especially in mathematics and astronomy. In this respect it was like Greek and Latin.
Developed during the late 4th-millennium BCE, the Sumerian language flourished during the 3rdmillennium BCE. (Only circa mid 3rd-millennium BCE can we be confident that cuneiform signs actually were a written language.) After some 1000 years, Sumerian changed from a spoken language to a literary language. Circa 2000 BCE Sumerian became obsolete as a living language but continued to be used as a language of scholarship by non-native speakers (such as the Akkadian speaking Babylonians and Assyrians) until the end of the 1st-millennium BCE. However, Sumerian texts from the 3rd-millennium BCE enable a more accurate understanding of the original Sumerian language than later Sumerian language texts influenced by Akkadian grammar and the grammatical understanding of Akkadian speakers. During the Hellenistic period (332-63 BCE) there are tablets with Sumerian words transcribed in Greek letters. The Semitic Akkadians borrowed the Sumerian-invented cuneiform script for writing their own language. For Akkadian scribes Sumerian was a language learned during scribal education. Though no longer used as a spoken language, Sumerian remained in use as a written language of scholarship and education. "In the Old Babylonian period the bulk of a student's elementary education consisted of learning Sumerian, by then a dead language. (Christine Proust, Tablettes mathématiques de la collection Hilprecht, 2008)" The Akkadians not only borrowed the idea of cuneiform but also retained numerous Sumerian logographs and phonetic signs (Sumerograms). (A logogram is a single symbol, that, for the purpose of brevity, represents an entire word of phase.) Additionally they added many of their own. (By circa 2000 BCE the Akkadian use of the Sumerian script had developed many modifications to Sumerian orthography with the Semitic equivalents for many signs becoming distorted or abbreviated to form "phonetic" values.) Because of their shortness Sumerian symbols remained in use in Akkadian writing. The Sumerian language (i.e., cuneiform signs) provided logograms for expediting the writing of Akkadian (i.e., Babylonian and Assyrian). The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of Akkadian. Akkadian texts are mostly (approximately 90 per cent) syllalograms. Syllables were frequently represented by signs. An Akkadian word was separated into

individual syllables, and each syllable was represented by a Sumerian sign. Most of the signs used to spell Akkadian represent syllables. Most signs had 2 or more values or readings. However, in some cases, 1 symbol could have up to 12 syllabic values. The terms ideograms and logograms are applied to the Sumerian language. The terms Sumerograms and logograms are applied to the Akkadian language. They are used in the graphic representation of a language other than Sumerian. In Akkadian Sumerian logograms are often named Sumerograms because they originate from Sumerian cuneiform signs. A Sumerogram is the use of a single, or group, of Sumerian, cuneiform signs as an ideogram or logogram rather than a syllabogram. An ideogram is a graphical symbol representing an idea rather than a word i.e., graphical wayfinding signage at airports. A logogram is a meaningful cuneiform sign that stands for an entire word. A logogram is a written symbol representing an entire spoken word without expressing its pronunciation i.e., $ for dollar. The term ideogram is also commonly used to describe logographic writing systems.
Cuneiform is a script not a language. It can be used to render any language. Different versions of cuneiform writing were used to write various Near Eastern languages. Overall the Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian languages.
Proponents of a Sumerian origin for the Babylonian constellations like to argue that the names of many constellations are originally Sumerian, not merely Sumerograms (i.e., logograms, or ideograms) for Akkadian. However, the issue is not a simple one. Even late Babylonian astronomical records have a high logographic content. According to Wayne Horowitz it was common practice in 1st-millennium BCE astronomical texts to write star-names with Sumerograms. Akkadian syllabic writings of star-names are rare in the 1st-millennium BCE. Beginning circa 2500 BCE the Akkadians adapted the Sumerian cuneiform writing system for writing Akkadian. (Akkadian was the language of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires. It seems the Akkadians were the first Semites to borrow the Sumerian writing system.) Most cuneiform signs were taken from the Sumerians. Though the Akkadians spelled their words phonetically they still made use of the old Sumerian system. Semitic scribes preferred to avoid syllabic spelling. Long Akkadian words were preferentially written as Sumerograms. It is generally stated that the term logogram is used to describe a Sumerian word that is used in Akkadian cuneiform writing i.e., has been borrowed into the Akkadian language. But it is not always the case that Sumerograms mean the use of Sumerian loan words. It may be that there has been an Akkadian adaptation of a Sumerian logogram. In Akkadian texts Sumerian words are frequently used to stand for their Akkadian equivalents. A Sumerian word that is used in Akkadian writing usually indicates meaning (words) (i.e., are mostly used for common nouns i.e., "king" or "horse") rather than a syllable or sound. (Present day example: The use of 4 for "four" illustrates a single symbol representing an entire word without expressing its pronunciation.) Use of a Sumerian word is represented by 1 sign in the case of a simple logogram or by 2 signs in the case of a composite logogram. (Composite logograms are separated by a dot.) Use of logograms in Akkadian cuneiform texts are recognisable either because (1) a syllabic reading of the sign makes no sense in the context, or (2) cuneiform scribes usually add (preceding) signs (determinatives) that act as logogram identifiers and indicate the class the (following) logogram belongs to. (See: Beyond Babel by Steven McKenzie and John Kattner (2002).)
Sumerian loan words were written just as they were written in Sumerian. However, it is not (always) possible to decide whether the Sumerian words (word-signs or 'ideograms') used in later (non-Sumerian) times are actually Sumerian in origin or are just later Babylonian notions recorded in anachronistic Sumerian. (According to the cuneiform philologist John Heise, Akkadian speakers systematically used the Sumerian language at least to the Old Babylonian Period. It was the language of the Akkadian-speaking scholars.) Because of the ability of the Sumerian language to express multiple words with the brevity of a single logogram the Sumerian language was later used for either technical or ritual purposes. Sumerian logograms offered the advantage of brevity enabling technical terms to be written with a single symbol. (A Sumerogram can be symbol (sign) and would mean one word, or compound symbols (signs) - separated by spacings representing multiple words.) A logogram used in an Akkadian text could represent either a loan word from Sumerian or a native Akkadian word. Sumerograms did not necessarily represent Sumerian loan words in the Akkadian language. Sumerograms were actually read in Akkadian only. The Sumerian symbols were used because of their shortness. To write the word meaning 'scales' (Akkadian zibanitu(m)), for the constellation Libra, either the single Sumerian logogram RIN could be used or the four Akkadian cuneiform signs zi-bani-tum. "Logograms are used in Sumerian to write nominal and verbal roots or words, and in Akkadian as a kind of shorthand to write Akkadian words which would otherwise have to be spelled out using syllabic signs. For example, an Akkadian scribe could write the sentence "The king came to his palace" completely syllabically: šar-ru-um a-na e-kal-li-šu il-li-kam. He would be just as likely, however, to use the common

Sumerian logograms for "king" and "palace" and write instead LUGAL a-na É.GAL-šu il-li-kam. (Introduction to Sumerian Grammar by Daniel Foxvog (2011, Page 12))"
Understandably, logograms were used as short-cuts in order to write faster and save space on a tablet. Sumerian word signs were frequently used as technical terms in mathematics and astronomy. In some ways the later use of Sumerian in Babylonian texts is somewhat similar to the continued use of Latin in the Middles Ages in Europe (termed 'Classical Latin'). It was the language of a cultural elite (i.e., the lingua franca). Long after the end of the Roman empire, Latin continued in use as the lingua franca of the educated classes, and of law, diplomacy, religion, and university teaching. Latin was used as an international lingua franca until the end of the 18th-century. It was a general convention in ancient Mesopotamian scientific texts to use Sumerian word-signs to render Akkadian vocabulary words. As such no conclusion can be confidently drawn from the later use of Sumerian terms regarding the time or place of the origin of the content of the texts. Also, there are very few original Sumerian tablets containing any significant astronomical references.
Interestingly, Erica Reiner states (Astral Magic in Babylonia (1995, Page 22)): "Some prayers are written , it appears, in the Sumerian language, but in fact are simple transpositions of Akkadian phraseology into Sumerian words and phrases. They may have been recited - as in various rituals - by the priest or exorcist utraque lingua eruditus ('learned in both languages') while the client's prayer was couched in the vernacular, Akkadian."
In 2006 Martin Worthington (Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Cambridge) stated: "Translating Sumerian is a particularly demanding and intricate task, as the language presents many more difficulties than modern or even other ancient ones. Sumerian (whose very existence was still disputed just over a century ago) is still not fully understood, and many nuances are provisionally lost to us. Research tools are inadequate -- a comprehensive up-to-date dictionary is lacking. The number of scholars working in the field is small. The literary compositions themselves have to be pieced together painstakingly from thousands of clay fragments housed in museums all over the world. The content of the compositions is often far removed from modern aesthetics and ethics and not always easy to comprehend."
Note: Wilfred Lambert (1999) expressed the "extremely plausible proposition" that there may have been more than one Sumerian system of writing in early times.
Some persons have argued that if there are no conclusions to be drawn from the use of Sumerian words (word-signs or 'ideograms') used in later (non-Sumerian) times then it would have to be concluded that there are no conclusions to be drawn from the fact in Western uranography that we use Arabic and Latin names for the stars. However, the weight of evidence between the two is vastly different. There is literally no direct evidence for establishing Sumerian astronomy - but some people like to make deductive assumptions for such based on selective reasoning. We have lots of sources for for understanding why Arabic and Latin star names are used and we can confidently reach conclusions.
Appendix 2: The Ur III Period.
The Ur III period (2112-2004 BCE) (not to be confused with the earlier Uruk III period reaching up to circa 3000 BCE) is generally considered the best (most abundant) documented century in antiquity. This was due to a state organisation that was very bureaucratic. The Third Dynasty of Ur was a highly bureaucratized empire with a cohesive, literate elite. It was also a relatively short-lived empire. There is an abundance of surviving documentation. Large numbers of cuneiform records have been recovered. The many tens of thousands of tablets recovered (many from looters) have been long studied.
It is also termed the Neo Sumerian period or the "Sumerian Renaissance." The tens of thousands of cuneiform tablets that have survived document an immense range of activities. This has resulted in nearly 100 years of intense scholarly work on the Ur III period. Within the context of the active intellectual endeavour recorded at this period no astronomy emerges.
Note: Some scholars now contest the traditional view of a resurgent Sumerian 'Renaissance' in the Ur III period, after the Akkadian rule of Sargon, as little more than a modern construct.
Appendix 3: Sumerian Astral Omens?

https://web.archive.org/web/20210411143623/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-4.html 9/11
No astral omens in the Sumerian language have been found. However, there is some evidence that ominous signs were observed and interpreted. The somewhat sole example is Gudea of Lagaš looking for signs from extispicy before beginning the rebuilding the temple of his city's god, Ningirsu. Nothing recovered to date from Sumer matches the Old Babylonian omens.
Appendix 4: Star Names in Sumerian-Eblaite List.
The oldest Semitic star name presently known is kà-ma-tù (a name for the Pleiades asterism) which occurs at Ebla in cuneiform tablets comprising the palace archive dating to the late 3rd-millennium (circa 2500 BCE2250 BCE).
The Sumerian term mul.mul "The Stars" (= the Pleiades) occurs in a 3rd-millennium BCE bilingual lexical list (Sumerian-Eblaite bilingual vocabulary text) from Ebla as an equivalent of the Eblaite term mul kà-ma-tù "The Family" (mul-mul=ka\-ma-tu\). The lengthy text was reconstructed from 114 tablets. from the 3rdmillennium BCE. (See: Giovanni Pettinato (1934-2011), Materiali Epigraphici di Ebla [MEE], Volume 4, 1982, Page 288. Giovanni Pettinato, "Vocabulary of Ebla." ["Ebla Vocabulary."] [VE], Materiali Epigraphici di Ebla, Volume 4, 1982, Page 792 [= Giovanni Pettinato, Testi lessicali bilingui della Biblioteca L. 2769, MEE 4, 1982.]. It is considered that kà-ma-tù is cognate (similar, having the same linguistic derivation) to the late biblical Hebrew name for the Pleiades (or thought to be), Kimah (i.e., Job 38:31 ). Four more entries in lexical lists from Ebla may be names for stars in Sumerian. (Of the 15,000 tablets recovered from Ebla approximately 80% are written in Sumerian. The date of the tablets is circa 2250 BCE.)
Appendix 5: The Greek Constellation of the Charioteer.
Regarding the Charioteer constellation in Babylonian and Greek uranography, and seen by Wayne Horowitz as also a possible Sumerian constellation. The stars of the Greek constellation Auriga (= Charioteer) were the stars of the Babylonian constellation Gamlu/Gam (= the Crook (= possibly the Babylonian sickle implement)). The source for the perpetuating error that Gamlu = Babylonian charioteer is Robert Brown Junior in his totally unreliable Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans. (1899-1900; 2 Volumes). In the Babylonian scheme of the Stars of Amurru SHU.GI (Su.gi/Sibu) was - until rather recently - identified as Old Man or Charioteer. This was done by Waerden in Science Awakening II. However, SHU.GI (in both the Astrolabes / Mul.Apin) is now identified as Old Man (See: Mul.Apin or Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia by Hunger/Pingree). Hunger/Pingree identify SHU.GI as the stars of Perseus.
Appendix 6: Sumer and Venus/Inanna
Many of the important Sumerian cities were dedicated to goddesses. Uruk/Kullaba and Zabala were dedicated to Inana. The association of Inana/Istar and Venus was made very early. Sumerian hymns reveal that already in the third millennium the planet Venus was seen as the astral form of the goddess Inana or Istar. Inanna's name is documented first in the archaic tablets found in Uruk/Warka, which date back to circa 3500 BCE. At that time Inanna was already connected with the planet Venus and was called dINANAUD/húd (Inanna 'evening) and dINANA-sig (Inanna 'morning'). The name dINANA-KUR (Inanna of the Netherworld) is also attested, but less frequently. The early Uruk tablets that are used to identify Inanna with Venus have only very concise information, with expectation of reader knowledge. The three names would seem to reflect the three phases of the visibility of Venus. Inana was the goddess of the morning and evening star (Venus), waking people and signaling the end of their working day. It is indicated that the Sumerians preferred Venus as the evening star, which was usually endowed with female qualities. Inanna of Uruk was identified with the Semitic Ishtar, also a Venus goddess worshiped primarily at Akkad. In Sumerian liturgy, the radiance of the goddess Inana is a principal element in her description as the planet Venus. She was hailed as "the great lady of the horizon and zenith of the heavens" and she was addressed as "the radiant star, Venus the great light which fills the wholly heavens." (See: A Companion to the Ancient Near East edited by Daniel Snell (2008; Page 326).) In Babylonia the Semitic Ishtar was equated with the Sumerian goddess Inanna. The Akkadians of northern Babylonia venerated Ishtar (= the Sumerian Inana) as a goddess of lust and war, and she was also regarded as goddess of the planet Venus. Ishtar’s astral aspect in the form of the Venus star is symbolized by an octoradial rosette (= can be divided into eight identical pieces).

The association of the graphic in Mesopotamia with the synodic astronomical behaviour of Venus is speculative. I am uncertain regarding how the recognition of such was accomplished and the pentagram developed. (It is a fiction that it is possible to draw a pentagram by marking on the ground the position in the sky each time Venus appears as a morning star during an 8-year cycle.) Egyptian use (circa predynastic period 5500 - 3100 BCE) seems to precede Mesopotamia (= use in Sumer). For early Egyptian astronomical origin – preceding use in Mesopotamia - and discussion of later astronomical association with Venus (at least in Mesopotamia); See: In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy editedby Juan Belmonte and Mosalam Shaltout (2009, Page 336).
The appearance of the pentagram symbol is in Mesopotamian is dated to potsherds from Ur circa 3000 BCE (or perhaps earlier). See David Brown below for its association with Venus.
"The two-tablet series known by its incipit as Mul.Apin 'the Plough Star' (this is not Ursa Maior, incidentally) outlines many similar schemes, but also includes star lists and omens. It is known from texts dating no earlier than the Neo-Assyrian period, but contains much material that is undoubtedly older. It has long been thought of as an early astronomical text, but again contains nothing that would have permitted the scribes to know in advance when an astronomical phenomenon would occur to even a moderate degree of accuracy. Its schemes are still no more then (sic) elaborations based on fundamental ideal periods, such as 30 days for the Moon, and 360 days for the Sun, idealisations that were common currency from the beginning of the third millennium at least (Brown 2000a: 106). The symbol of an eight-pointed star is known from prehistoric times, and its association with the goddess Inanna and thus Venus is assured from the mid-third millennium onwards (Black and Green 1992: 169–70). It can hardly be coincidence that the shortest period in years after which Venus repeats one of its characteristic phenomena is approximately eight. I would add, then, the eight-year synodic period of Venus to the list of ideal periods known throughout the third millennium BC. A related ideal pattern of Venus's behaviour is attested in the second section of the sixtythird tablet of Enūma Anu Ellil, the first part of which records phenomena dating to the reign of an Old Babylonian king (Brown 2000: 249 §9). Attuned as we are to seeking antecedents to modern thinking, we tend to regard the awareness on the part of the Mesopotamian scholars of the periodicity of the heavens, their assignment to those periods of round and ideal numbers, and the numerical elaboration therefrom, as in someway antecedent to our own exact science of astronomy. We confuse, though, the potential of such ideal periods to make accurate predictions with their intention, which, I argue, was instead to make the date and or time of an observation interpretable (Brown 2001). The ideal periods served the same purpose as the broad categories into which the visible phenomena of the heavens were divided – the constellations of the ecliptic, the four colours, the four cardinal directions, above and below, brightness and faintness, and so forth. Both reduced what would otherwise have been an infinite number of variables in any observation to a manageable few, all of which could be encoded with a particular value, and thereby made the heavens interpretable: 'If Nergal [meaning Mars] stands in [the constellation] Scorpius; a strong enemy will carry off the land [an illboding prognostication for the land, expressed as an enemy attack, since Nergal is associated with "the enemy"]' (Hunger 1992: no. 502: 11)." ("Mesopotamian Astral Science." by David Brown (Free University, Berlin), In: The Babylonian World edited by Gwendolyn Leick (2007), Pages 460-472; see Page 462.)
Gebhard Selz (University of Vienna) holds that circa 3000 BCE there may have been knowledge of the 1.6 year synodic period of Venus. (See: "Remarks on the Empirical Foundation and Scholastic Traditions of Early Mesopotamian Acquisition of Knowledge." In: The Empirical Dimensions of Ancient Near Eastern Studies edited by Gebhard Selz (2011, Pages 49-70; see page 63).
Jeffrey Cooley (Boston College), in his article, "Early Mesopotamian Astral Science and Divination in the Myth of Inana And Šukaletuda." (Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions, Volume 8, Number 1, 2008, Pages 75-98), holds the myth is related to the synodic activity of the planet Venus. Abstract: "The Sumerian tale of Inana and Shukaletuda recounts how the goddess Inana is raped by a homely gardener upon whom she seeks and ultimately finds revenge. Though this general plot has long been understood, certain elements of the story have remained largely unexplored. Previous scholarship has often suggested that within Inana and Shukaletuda, the goddess Inana is often described in her astral manifestation (e.g. S. Kramer 1961, 117; K. Volk 1995, 177-179 and 182-183; B. Alster 1999, 687; J. Cooper 2001, 142-144). Nevertheless, to date there has been no systematic treatment of this assumption and this study seeks to fill this gap. It is my thesis that certain events of the story (i.e. Inana's movements) can be related to a series of observable celestial phenomena, specifically the synodic activity of the planet Venus. This also explains the heretofore enigmatic

climax of the story, in which Inana crosses the entire sky in order to finally locate her attacker, as a celestial miracle required by the planet Venus' peculiar celestial limitations. Furthermore, since in ancient Iraq the observation of astronomical phenomena was often done for the purpose of celestial divination, I suggest that certain events within the story may be illuminated if situated within that undertaking."
Most of the Babylonian tablets concerned with the planets give calculated dates (and longitudes) for the synodic phenomena. Very few tablets give data for the planet between the phenomena. The synodic phenomena for an inner planet are: (1) its first appearance in the morning, MF, (2) its subsequent disappearance, ML, (3) its appearance and disappearance in the evening, EF and EL, and (4) its stationary points. The synodic phenomena for an outer planet are: (1) its appearance (in the morning) MF, (2) its disappearance (in the evening) EL, (3) opposition, and (4) the beginning and end of retrogression, BR and ER. In late texts the Babylonians recorded the longitude of the planet at each occurrence in signs (of the zodiac) and thirtieths of a sign.
Since the Neo-Sumerian period (21st-century BCE) in literary and religious texts the astral status of Inanna is determined by the epithet U4-zal-le (the morning star) and the expressions using the word usan (the evening star).
Appendix 7: Elamite Celestial Iconography
Ancient Elam is situated to the east of Mesopotamia. The capital city of Elam was Susa. Elamite written records begin circa 3100 BCE. The territory that comprised ancient Elam is now part of Iran.
Carving of a sun-disc, a crescent moon, and an 8-pointed star (positioned next to a goddess seated on lion(s)) is included on an Elamite cylinder seal (from Susa?) dated circa 2500 BCE. See: Alt-Iran : Die Kunst in vorislamischer Zeit by Edith Porada (with the collaboration of Robert Dyson and with contributions by Charles Wilkinson) (1962, Pages 30-31).
Image of a crescent moon, and an 8-pointed star with a central dot (positioned next to a standing figure) is included on a "Jiroft" (proto-Elamite) vase dating to the late 3rd-millennium BCE. See: "L'iconographie de Jiroft." by Jean Perrot (Dossiers d'Archéologie (special issue: Jiroft, fabuleuse découverte en Iran), Number 287, October, 2003, Pages 96-113). [Note: The vase is a plundered item that is unprovenienced; apparently taken from an ancient cemetery south of the old city of Jiroft.]
Willy Hartner brought attention to carvings of stars on an Elamite cylinder seal dated circa 2500 BCE. He thought they were possibly related to celestial stars and possibly that astronomy was being indicated.

:DEarly Mesopotamian Constellations
5: Elamite lion-bull iconography as constellations?
Persian lion-bull combat/contest scene decorating a wall (central panel, east stairway) of the apadana at Persepolis. (The stone figures are carved in relief (embossed, likely circa 515 BCE.) The finely chiseled detail of the figures is obvious.) The lion-bull combat/contest scene also appears on the west stairway of the central panel of the apadana. Further figures of the lion-bull combat/contest appear on the corner angles of the southern facade of the Palace of Darius at Persepolis. In all examples the lion is depicted attacking the bull from behind. The actual meaning of the lion/bull composites will likely always remain a guess. At this date the depiction is seen as a symbol of kingship and power. The depiction is variously described as a "lion devouring a bull," a "lion fighting a bull," or "the rear attack." Both figures are shown standing and both are in a rearing posture.

Colour photograph of Lion-Bull section of the central facade of the eastern stairway, Apadana, Persepolis. The Apadana Staircase, similar to the Great Staircase, was designed to allow a solemn access to the audience hall. The lion-bull combat/contest is depicted at many other places in the Apadana and other palaces. As example: It appears at the tachara (the Palace of Darius) stairway.
Willy Hartner's Astronomical Interpretation for the Lion-Bull Symplegma (Composite)
Attempts to reasonably identify animal contest scenes (such as lion-bull combat/contest scenes) have broadly varied between naturalistic and astronomical explanations. It is certainly not established, however, that the lion-bull iconography has a single intended meaning. (Two influential studies for an astronomical interpretation of lion-bull combat/contest scenes are: "The Lion and the Unicorn" by the art historian Cyril Bunt (Antiquity, Volume IV, 1930, Pages 425-437); and "The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat" by the science historian Willy Hartner (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume XXIV, 1965, Numbers 1 and 2, Pages 1-16, and Plates I-XVI).) Both Bunt and Hartner argued for Lion and Bull constellations being depicted. Hartner's method for relating preliterate era lion-bull combat/contest iconography to the sky consisted of working back in time, on the basis of precession, to achieve a "matching" situation with the positions of the historical lion and bull constellations. Hartner interpreted/speculated that the Lion was the constellation Leo and that the Bull was the constellation Taurus (their earliest appearances in the sky as constellations). This method invites scepticism. (In his article "On the Origin of the Zodiacal Constellations" (Vistas in Astronomy, Volume 36, 1993, Page 181) the astronomer and historian Alexander Gurshtein credits Hartner's 1965 article as a strong stimulus for his own method of constellation reconstruction.) Hartner was actually seeking to substantiate Hezfeld's earlier conjecture.
Hartner termed the lion-bull symplegma motif the "Lion-Bull Combat." He associated this motif with the development of the Near Eastern agricultural calendar; specifically the marking of the beginning of Spring (in February, 4000 BCE) by the meridian crossing of the Lion constellation and the simultaneous setting of the Bull constellation. Hartner's 'calculations' were for the latitude of the city of Ur, for the night of February 10, 4000 BCE. Some problems with Hartner's assumption's and claims were discussed in the Bulletin (1988, Issues 13-24) of the (Canadian) Society for Mesopotamian Studies. Some kind of system for determining key times in the agricultural cycle would have been very important to the early farmers of the ancient Near East. However, calendars were not a prerequisite for the development of agriculture. In the period before the development of writing early farmers may have simply depended on knowledge of the seasons from changing seasonal temperatures, changes in vegetation, animal births, the flight of birds, onset of rains, or the flooding of rivers.
Hartner's influential interpretation of the lion-bull combat/contest motif, as evidence for fourth millennium BCE Lion and Bull constellations being used as seasonal markers (a 4-constellation zodiac), has received later endorsement by several other astronomers. However, both Assyriologists and historians of Mesopotamian art, with the exception of Ernst Herzfeld, have not done so. (Peter van der Veen has stated (2008) the Pleiades are depicted on many Mesopotamian cylinder seals by the so-called '7 dots' symbol.) As recent as 2002 the David Stronach, the British Archaeologist and expert on ancient Iran, denied the validity of Hartner's interpretation. (See: "Icons and Dominion", Iranica Antiqua, Volume 37, 2002.) (Hartner believed that by February 4000 BCE the Sumerians had originated (for agricultural purposes) a quartet of constellations (i.e., a simple proto-zodiac), comprising the Bull, the Lion, the Scorpion, and the Ibex (later to become the Water Carrier?) marking the 4 tropical points of the sky. A fundamental problem is the "internal evidence" approach to solely argue the case whilst not being able to show that there are any direct supporting statements (or even "hints") contained in any type of texts. (For support by astronomers see: "The Origin of the Zodiac" by Owen Gingerich

(It would appear that the archaeologist and art historian Ernst Herzfeld was the first person to draw attention to the combat/contest depictions on cylinder seals.)
The Appearance of the Lion-Bull Symplegma at Persepolis
The Archaemenid Empire is dated 550 to 330 BCE. Persepolis, the dynastic national shrine of Archaemenid Persia, was constructed from circa 520 to 450 BCE, to the commands of the great Archaemenid kings. It was a monumental architectural complex that was occupied for nearly two centuries before being burnt by Alexander the Great. The lionbull combat/contest was an important symbol at Persepolis and is commonly asserted to be symbolically related to the spring equinox and thus is one of the reliefs connected with the depiction of the New Year's festival (i.e., the spring festival Norouz). However, the assertion that the lion-bull combat/contest reliefs at Persepolis depict the New Year's festival (i.e., the spring festival Norouz) is not firmly established. (The story of the Norouz/Nowruz tribute has a late origin.)
A number of academics (Cyril Bunt (1930), Ernst Herzfeld (1941), and Willy Hartner (1965)) held the view that the lionbull combat/contest scenes depicted on earlier Mesopotamian cylinder seals and other items also have an astronomical significance. Willy Hartner in particular argued for an interpretation involving the establishment of Mesopotamian Lion and Bull constellations circa 4000 BCE. However, the earliest depiction of a lion-bull combat/contest is on a pitcher from Uruk dated circa 3300 BCE.
A recent and different interpretation has been offered by the young historian Francisco Prado-Vilar in his article "Circular Visions of Fertility and Punishment: Caliphal Ivory Caskets from al-Andalus." (In: Gülru Necipoglu (Editor). Muqamas XIV: An Annual on the Visual Culture of the Islamic World (1997). Pages 19-41.): "The lion-bull combat is common motif used for the glorification of royal power; it has a long tradition in political iconography, with well-known occurrences in artistic enterprises related to strong monarchic territorial structures like the Assyrian and Persian empires." Perhaps a correct interpretation has been offered by Elspeth Dusinberre, an art historian and expert on the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire, in her book Aspects of Empire in Achaemenid Sardis (2002). Page 278 has an illustration of a recently recovered seal from Sardis which depicts the lion-bull combat/contest with sun and moon motifs placed above them. The seal supports the conclusion that the Achaemenid lion-bull iconography represented the perpetual day-night revolutions. The lion stood for the sun and the bull stood for the night.
The lion-bull symplegma at Persepolis should not be interpreted in isolation to the other bull images. Recent scholarly studies have emphasised the importance of understanding the art and artifacts of Achaemenid kings in their historical, social, and political contexts. Importantly, Achaemenid art had a distinct role in defining royal power/authority within the empire. It represented the power and might of the kings enhanced/reflected their power and might. On the staircases of the Apadāna at Persepolis the scene of the lion-bull fight are rendered in large scale in contrast to other scenes, and reflect a message of control and order. See the excellent article: "Who Has the Biggest Bulls? Royal Power and the Persepolis Apadāna." by Janett Morgan (Iranian Studies, Volume 50, Issue 6, 2017, Pages 1-31). Abstract: "Relationships between power and architecture are a feature of all great civilizations and the Achaemenid world was no exception to this. The architecture of Achaemenid buildings and their relief sculpture was designed to reflect and reinforce the power and status of the Great King. At the heart of this visual program lay the audience hall (apadāna) at Persepolis. In seeking to explain and understand the messages written into this building, we tend to approach the structure as a completed work and view it from the last point in its lifecycle. As a result, we focus on its tribute procession relief and allow ideas of empire to dominate our gaze. This limits our ability to understand how and why the building’s intended audience and message of power might have diverged at different stages in its construction. This article re-examines the art and architecture of the audience hall at Persepolis and redirects the viewer’s gaze to the images of bulls rather than the tribute procession. In focusing on the role of bulls in the scheme of decoration, the article presents a more nuanced reading of the building in its historical, social and architectural context. It shows how Darius I used the Persepolis apadāna to display his authority to rule and to assert the primacy of his status amongst his fellow elites." Janett Morgan Ph.D. is (2017) an interdisciplinary ancient Greek historian at Royal Holloway, University of London, Department of Classics (Egham, Surrey).
Objections to an astronomical origin and significance of the lion-bull combat/contest iconography are grounded in the complete absence of any type of supportive archaeological evidence.
The perceived problems with Hartner's Mesopotamian Lion-Bull constellation theory are:
(1) It is not established that the lion-bull iconography has a single intended meaning.

(2) The lion-bull combat/contest depictions are not consistent - in some of the earliest depictions both animals are depicted as achieving supremacy over each other.
(3) There is a complete lack of any type of supportive evidence for an astronomical interpretation i.e., from written sources such as mythological themes.
(4) The stylized lion-bull "symplegma" on an Elamite seal from circa 4000 BCE seems hardly convincing - the figures are barely touching and hardly make a convincing combat/contest scene.
(5) Hartner's earliest convincing lion-bull iconographic evidence (on a pitcher from Uruk) originated some 700 years later than the 4000 BCE seasonal marker date he identified.
(6) The earliest depiction of the eight-petaled rosette as a shoulder ornament on lions (circa 2500 BCE on a statue depicting lions supporting the throne of Innina) does not necessarily have an astral meaning.
(7) The sheer variety of animal combatants/contestants depicted in iconography makes an astronomical interpretation difficult.
(8) No one has attempted to show that changes in iconographic animals depicted in combat/contest scenes match constellation changes/additions due to the requirement for new seasonal markers to deal with the effect of precession.
(9) Splitting the lion-bull symplegma to interpret it is controversial and is not a requirement supported by recent interpreters of animal combat/contest scenes.
(10) Hartner did not track the (origin of the) lion-bull symbol to Elam - we do not know the culture responsible for originating the lion-bull symbolism.
(11) It has not been demonstrated that the lion-bull iconography at Persepolis has an astronomical/seasonal significance.
(12) It has not been demonstrated that the lion-bull iconography at Persepolis formed part of the depiction of a New Year's festival and it has not been demonstrated that a New Year's festival was held at Persepolis circa 500 BCE.
(13) A seal from Achaemenid Sardis supports the conclusion that the Achaemenid lion-bull combat/contest represented the perpetual day-night revolutions with the lion representing the sun and the bull representing the night.
(14) The lion-bull pairing ("symplegma" or otherwise) is not attested in later Mesopotamian cuneiform astronomical and astrological texts.
The lion-bull is not clearly astronomical. Even Hartner conceded there is no literary evidence for his astronomical interpretation.

Appendix 2: Lion Behaviour in the Wild
"Lion and Bull: I usually hesitate to read books about art. Art historians always seem to directly start with the interpretation of the paintings or sculptures. Somehow, they often appear to ignore that beautiful things can also be made to be precisely that: beautiful things. Art is meant primarily to be enjoyed, not studied. Take the fight of the bull and the lion that is shown so very often in Achemenid art. I once read that it represented the eternal cosmic struggle between the forces of good and evil; I also read that they represent two constellations, Taurus and Leo; and I also read that these two theories are not mutually exclusive. But the truth is that we don't know what it symbolizes. Actually, we do not even know what it represents. I once believed that the struggle was equal, until I showed one of these reliefs to a man who worked at a zoo. He told me that the lion had already lost the fight, because this animal kills its prey by attacking its victim's head. Obviously, that's not what we see: the lion has leaped and has landed on the wrong place – the bull will escape. I recently told this to someone who had lived in Tanzania. She said that she had once witnessed this very type of fight, and added that the lion always leaps to the lower part of an animal’s back. He will remain hanging over there, until his prey is tired. It is only then that the lion kills its victim. ... So, next time I have to explain this relief, I will do what I always do: explain why we don't know. Meanwhile, I learned one thing else. The astronomical explanation is almost certainly incorrect. The next example of an animal representing a celestial sign is the horoscope at Nemrud Daği, which is four centuries younger. Under the Roman Empire, this type of picture rapidly spread, which is why we're accustomed to it, but it simply had not yet been invented when Persepolis was built. (Blog maintained by Jona Lendering and Bill Thayer. http://rambambashi.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/lion-and-bull/)"
Appendix 3: Possible Early Lecture by Willy Hartner
It is indicated by a single source that circa 1949, Willy Hartner presented a lecture on the connection of art and astronomy entitled, "Early Traces of the Zodiac in the Near East," that was published in 1949 by the University of Chicago. The reference is given by Dr Ida Bobula (a controversial linguist) in her paper, "The Great Stag, A Sumerian Divinity and its Affiliation." in Yearbook of Ancient and Medieval History (1953, University of Buenos Aires). Ida Bobula, who resided for most of her life in the USA, was also regarded as a Sumerologist. I have not been able to reasonably establish that the reference is mistaken/erroneous. The list of Hartner's publications compiled by Matthias Schramm and published in 1982 does not mention such a publication. The only Hartner paper published by the University of Chicago Press in 1949 was titled "Goethe and the Natural Sciences." A search of the catalogue of both the University of Chicago library, and the Library of Congress, has also failed to locate any mention of a publication by Hartner in 1949. Perhaps the article "The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat" (1965) is the written version of a 1949 lecture by Hartner. The only 2 publications by Hartner on the subject that are mention by Schramm in his bibliography are: (1) The Conquering Lion, the Life Cycle of a Symbol" and (2) "The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat." This latter paper does mention (page 2?/4?) that Hartner once (year not specified) gave a lecture in Boston on the astronomical aspects of

the Lion-Bull Combat motif to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Possibly this is the lecture alluded to by Ida Bobula. Somehow she was familiar with the material comprising Hartner's 1949 lecture. (Perhaps she asked for and obtained a copy of the lecture from Hartner. It seems rather odd that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences would leave the lecture unpublished.) Her single reference to Hartner's lecture concerned his reference to disc or bird solar symbolism between the horns of the ibex. On pages 12 to 14 of his 1965 paper, Hartner discusses the solar symbols between the horns of the ibex. In the late 1940s Hartner was associated with the University of Chicago but in late 1949 it would appear he had returned to Germany.

6: Kassite kudurru iconography as constellations?
BM 102485. Kassite kudurru (height: 14.25 inches/37 cm, greatest width: 9.25 inches/23 cm, greatest width: 5 inches/13 cm) circa 1100 BCE in the British Museum, London. (See: Babylonian Boundary-Stones and Memorial-Tablets in the British Museum by Leonard King (1912) Pages 76-79, Plates I-IV.) Kudurrus are attested from the 14th-century BCE up until the 7th-century BCE. A kudurru had to be reasonably large to contain the administrative text of the grant and the images that accompanied it. The BM 102485 kudurru consists of a boulder of dark limestone that is tapered more toward the top than towards the base. The faces (i.e., obverse and reverse) have been slightly flattened by rubbing in order to take inscriptions and sculptures in relief. Approximately 40 kudurru from the Kassite period have survived, however, about half of these are damaged or unfinished. There is no convincing evidence that the kudurrus constitute an astronomical observational record. Kudurrus are a class of Babylonian documents, often in the form of stone monuments or smaller stone tablets, that commemorate specific economic relationships and interests, such as real estate, tax exemptions, temple offices, and personal property. The translation "boundary stone" is a misnomer as there is very little evidence that in ancient Mesopotamia kudurrus were actually used to mark property boundaries. In addition to kudurru, there are few other Babylonian names for these objects, such as naru, "stele," asumittu, "inscribed slab," and abnu, "stone." Note: BM 102485 records a land grant to a man named Gula-eresh, by Eannashum-idina (the governor of Sealand). The square box directly underneath the scorpion symbol represents the altar supporting the s corpion symbol of the goddess Ishara. (See: Ursula Seidl or Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Archäologie.)
Babylonian narū, traditionally named kudurrētu (singular kudurru), were stone monuments with god/goddess representations (generally through their god/goddess emblems/iconography) and figurative scenes with anthropomorphic figures, together with an administrative text about a land grant. Kudurru (narū) texts are confirmation of a royal grant. These narū originated in Kassite Babylon. Some 178 Babylonian kudurru are known. The great majority of the items have been discovered in Susa in decontextualized archaeological contexts, but the items found in situ indicate that their original geographical dispersion must be located in the territory of Lower Mesopotamia.
The Kassites (late Bronze period Babylonia) introduced the use of small stone steles known as kudurrus, a practice that was maintained by later dynasties until the 7th-century BCE. (A few have been comprised of clay.) There are estimated to be 110 kudurrus scattered around the world, in different museums. The term "boundary-stone" originating with the early publications implies they were markers set up to indicate a boundary (in a field). One of the earliest significant Mesopotamian monuments to be brought to Europe was a kudurru (boundary-stone). It was found in 1788 south of Baghdad on the west bank of the Tigris River by the French amateur botanist Antoine Michaux and brought by him to Paris (France) in 1800. It was named the Caillou de Michaux. (The French word 'caillou' means 'pebble.') Kudurrus were usually pillar-shaped. Some later kudurru were tablet-shaped. A kudurru is a small conical block covered with symbols and an inscription recording a grant of agricultural land. They sometimes have a conical/pointed or slightly rounded top and often have an insert base (characterised by a much rougher surface than the upper part) for fitting them onto a mud brick platform, for display. (The assyriologist Kathryn Slanski has demonstrated (2003) that these stones were called nargūs by the Babylonians. The Babylonians labelled them narū "stele.") Stone was rare and expensive in Mesopotamia and the kudurrus were intended to be a permanent and indestructible record.
Kudurrus are part of a land tenure system that dates back to the Sumerian period (almost from the beginning of cuneiform writing). (La nd tenure was important to the general economy.) Some 15 Sumerian kudurrus dating to the Uruk III period (circa 3100-2900 BCE) and Early Dynastic II-III period (circa 2900-2600 BCE) are known. Early kudurrus have been recovered from Sumerian locations that include Lagash, Nippur, Adab, and Ur. All these locations were subject to Semitic influence. The ancient Sumerian period kudurrus dealt with small land purchases (and rentals?) conducted within a family group or clan. Kassite dynasty kudurrus typically represented royal grants of land or confirmed earlier grants of land made by the king after prolonged litigation. Later Kassite and post-Kassite kudurrus also dealt with gifts of land within a family group or with land sale or purchase involving both related and non -related individuals. (See the monumental work: Earliest Land Tenure Systems in the Near East: Ancient Kudurrus by Ignace Gelb, Piotr Steinkeller, and Robert Whiting Junior (1989-1991, 2 Parts: Part 1: Text, Part 2: Plates).) From the 11th-century BCE kudurrus were no longer simply concerned with royal land grants. It was in the 2nd Isin dynasty that their use was extended to include also private transfers of property. From this period directly made royal land grants declined.
The name "Kassite" is derived from the Akkadian word kassu and identifies Kassite speaking peoples, not ethnic identity. The term Kassite kudurru = Kassite period kudurru. The cultural beliefs inherent in Kassite period kudurru iconography and inscriptions is Mesopotamian/Babylonian. The nomadic Kassites were horse riders with superior mobility in a terrain where only the camel and the donkey were known. The Kassites were neither builders nor de stroyers. Prior to the Kassite conquest the Assyrians had been subjects of Babylon but these ties were cut and Assyria became a nation state. Circa 1160 BCE the Elamites swept in from Susa and overthrew the Kassites.

The use of kudurrus became typical for the Kassite period. The Kassites were established in Babylonia during the period 1600-1500 BCE. The Kassites ruled Babylonia in the 16th-12th-centuries BCE. The origin of the Kassites is obscure. The original homeland of the Kassites is not known. No text in the Kassite language has been preserved. The Kassites, moving westward from Iran, captured the city of Babylon after it was sacked by the Hittites. Kassite rulers retained power in Babylonia for almost 400 years (circa 1530-1155/1160 BCE), and for longer elsewhere. The power of the last rulers of the Kassite Dynasty in Babylonia (2nd Isin dynasty, late 12th-century BCE) was weakened by decades of conflict with Assyria to the north and Elam to the west. Raids by Aramaean tribal groups living outside the Babylonian cities caused major difficulties and the kings were unable to maintain control of the country and the Kassite dynasty came to an end. The Kassites brought order, stability, peace, and prosperity to Babylonia. Kudurrus were used in (southern) Mesopotamia from at least the 14th-century BCE to the first half of the 7th-century BCE. Most were produced during circa the late Kassite period. (Overall, some 150 or 160 exemplars are known.) The Kassites introduced a system of land grants in which the King awards extensive tracts of land to a wide variety of favoured subjects. (For a discus sion of the form of documentation of royal land grants, and attached symbols, in a later period see: Neo-Assyrian Royal Grants and Decrees by John Postgate (1969).) The kudurrus are almost the only artworks to survive from the period of Kassite rule. Other material for the study of Kassite period iconography includes cylinder seals and sealings, and pottery.
Source: Aspects of the early history of the Kassites and the archaeology of the Kassite Period in Iraq (c. 1600-1150 BC) by Tim Clayden (1989 (Volume 1, Pages 157-158), 2 Volumes; Unpublished PhD Thesis; Wolfson College, Oxford).
The kudurrus were a form of document. The function of the kudurru was first and foremost administrative. The frequent use of kudurrus - the classical form - was introduced under the Kassite rule and was likely connected with problems of a weak central government during the late Kassite period. Perhaps associated with this was the land owner asked the gods/goddesses for assistance to protect his property. The land and the privileges granted in co nnection with it were placed under the protection of the gods/goddesses. This amounted to kudurrus being inscribed with curses on any later official who tried to undo the land transaction. Officials are threatened with divine punishment if they try to upset the assignment of land that has been recorded. According to John Brink man in his important 2006 article ("Babylonian royal land grants, memorials of financial interest, and invocation of the divine." (Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient [JESHO], Volume 49, 2006, Pages 1-47)), kudurrus were not legal documents - rather they commemorated/marked the acquisition of land (perpetual income).
The primary concern of most of the studies of kudurrus has been the interpretation of the symbols that are found on most of them.
The kudurru recording a land donation made by king Melisipak (1186-1172 BCE) to Princess Hunnubat-Nanaya is one of the few examples of integrated text and iconography. Contrary to the standard system of symbolic invocation of the powers of gods/goddesses to guarantee the charter, the pictorial element of this kudurru seems to be an illustration of the land grant itself.

A kudurru (entitlement stone) is an economic document comprising a small polished stone stele (usually about half a metre high, though they ranged between being 40 to 90 centimetres tall) recording royal land donations (and sometimes other privileges) granted by the reigning King. (Whilst the vast majority of inscribed material from Mesopotamia is preserved on clay, stone - because of its permanence - was used to create kudurru. Stone had to be imported to Babylonia.) They are inscribed with cuneiform writing and sculpted with low relief images/symbols of the gods/goddesses. The narrative part of a kudurru was a description of a legal (land) transaction. The purpose of a kudurru was to confirm the existence of a legal transaction. The artistic designs are quite striking. They were originally documents (deeds) given by the king to accompany any royal grants of land (and tax exemptions) by the King to his loyal offic ers (for special services). (The land grants were conferred unconditionally and for all time i.e., in perpetuity to the person and his descendents.) Whether kudurrus were established in the field is undecided. The 3 kudurrus archaeologically discovered in their original locations were all found in temples. There is only one reference to a kudurru possibly being placed in a field, but the text is ambiguous. According to several sources it was practice to use 2 documents with all royal grants of agricultural land. The original was kept in the temple (or a private document was also held by the owner as proof of his ownership?) and a copy (a public document) was (perhaps) placed as a public marker upon the donated property for the information of people in general. (A kudurru was set up in the middle of the field. The actual field kudurru was perhaps a more simple marking stone.) It was not intended to be removed. (Title deeds were placed under the protection of the gods/goddesses. The gods/goddesses depicted on the kudurru acted as guarantors of the document.) They were referred to by the Akkadian term kudurru which can mean "boundary" or "frontier." (A kudurru then, not only acted as a record of land grants but also as a boundary stone.) The area of land was usually extensive enough to feed two hundred people. Kudurrus, properly, were introduced during the Kassite Period (circa 1600-1150 BCE). Kudurru consist of decorating symbols representing gods and goddesses and an inscription in which the King detailed what area of land was given to whom. The iconography that decorates kudurrus shows little variation except for the increasing abstraction of god/goddess symbols. (Numerous Mesopotamian gods/goddesses have thermiomorphic representations i.e., have an animal form.) Amongst other information kudurrus recorded the name of the King and the year of his reign. The reason for the land grants were rarely given. (For an informed alternative view of the purpose of kudurrus see "Classification, Historiography and Monumental Authority: The Babylonian Entitlement Narus (Kudurrus)" by Kathryn Slanski (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 52, 2000, Pages 95-114). For a detailed discussion of the field and/or temple placement of kudurrus see the essay: "The Kudurrus as Monuments." by Giorgio Buccellati (Cinquante-deux reflexions sur le Proche-Orient ancien offertes en hommage a Leon de Meyer (1994, Pages 283291).
The prolific use of kudurrus appear some 2 centuries after the beginning of the rule of the Kassite Dynasty. The death of the last Kassite king was in 115 5 BCE. After this date the use of kudurrus continued but was reduced considerably. Kudurru ceased to be used by the end of the Neo-Babylonian period (circa 650 BCE).
Kudurrus are found only in Southern Mesopotamia. The extant kudurrus show no signs of weathering. Also, none were found in fields. Many have been recovered from ancient Elam where they were taken as booty. At least one has been recovered from a temple. (In 1882 the kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar was found by Abd al Ahad Thoma in the Ebabbar temple of the god Shamash at Sippar. Other kudurrus in the British Museum perhaps also came from the Shamash temple.) The archaeological evidence indicates that kudurrus were usually placed in or around temples or sacred precincts. Presumably this was to give divine sa nction to the economic relationships described in the inscription. It appears that eventually they were placed on the boundaries of the lan d involved. Some 160 kudurrus and kudurru fragments are presently known. Of these approximately 160 examples of kudurrus known, 75 percent have been dated to the period circa 1330-1050 BCE.
The somewhat free arrangement of images/symbols on kudurru is typical. However, there is an established hierarchy in which the celestial gods/goddesses with the highest rank are placed above the next highest ranking gods/goddesses. (The division into hierarchal zones also appears on cy linder seals.) It has been remarked the images/symbols often seemed to float above the baseline of the field.
The lower part of the obverse and the whole of the reverse are devoted to the text. The inscription on BM 102485 informs us the stone is a deeds parcel from Governor Eanna-shum-iddina to his subordinate Gula-eres about 1125-1100 BCE. (The kudurru is undated and does not refer to any Babylonian king by his name. However, the assignment of the date (i.e., fixing its period within a generation) is certain due to (1) the dated men tion of Governor Eanna-shum-iddina on the stone tablet of Nabu-shum-iddina, and (2) also on epigraphic grounds in that the forms of several of the cuneiform signs used are identical with those used in inscriptions dating to the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar I and Enlil-nadin-aplu.) Eanna-shum-iddina was the governor of the Sealand, one of the wealthiest regions of Babylonia. (In the 15th-century BCE the Kassite rulers of Babylonia defeated the rulers of the Sealand who had controlled the coastline (coastal marshland) region of the south of Iraq. They then appointed governors to administer the region. Historically Sealand was quite isolated from the rest of Babylo nia and enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy, and on at least 2 occasions independent Sealand dynasties are attested.) Amurru-bel-zeri is named as the surveyor who laid out the boundaries of the land. The two officials who completed the transfer of the five gur of corn land are also named. The end of the text also invokes curses on any person who removes, ignores, or destroys the kudurru. (The text on the kudurru invokes nine gods/goddesses to protect it. These are: (1) Anu, (2) Enlil, (3) Ea, (4) Ninmakh, (5) Sin, (6) Nabu, (7) Gula, (8) Ninib, and (9) Marduk. Apart from the god/goddess symbols kudurrus are characterised by the long drawn-out curses that appear on them.)
The upper portion of the obverse is basically devoted to engravings, in low relief, of a series of emblems. Seventeen divine symbols are depicted. Near the top of the stone the eight-pointed star of Ishtar (Venus) is accompanied by the crescent of Sin (the Moon), in the middle, and the rayed disk of Shamash (the Sun), on the right. A snake is prominently depicted down one side of the kudurru. Other symbols on the monument refer to other deities (i.e., the triangular spade to Marduk, and the wedge-shaped stylus to Nabu) and some may also have astral connotations i.e., be related to constellations (but this is not certain ). It not established that constellations or constellation symbols are being depicted on kudurru. It is established that god/goddess symbols are depicted. The view that the symbols on the kudurru represent the signs of the zodiac, or in part signs of the zodiac and in part other constellations, was accepted by many early Assyriologists. However, neither the zodiac or a scheme of 12 zodiacal constellations existed as early as the Kassite Period. What is presented is symbolic re presentations of certain gods/goddesses. Some gods/goddesses, the Sun, Moon and Venus, are astronomical bodies and naturally their symbols are representations of these astronomical bodies. There are four classes of items represented by the symbols: (1) the seats or shrines of the gods/goddesses, (2) the weapons of the gods /goddesses, (3) the animals of the gods/goddesses, and (4) the bas-reliefs of the gods/goddesses.
Babylonian boundary-stone (kudurru) iconography of the Kassite Period (circa 1530-1155/1160 BCE) includes the following depictions:
Bull Lion Furrow (= Virgin) Scorpion-Archer Hired-Man (= Ram) Goat-Fish (= Goat)
The symbols on kudurru have no relevance to Mesopotamian astronomy. In the early period of assyriology it was common to identify these symbols as de pictions of the zodiacal constellations. Further work in assyriology has changed this assumption. It is not certain they represent gods/goddesses in an astral character. It is not established that constellations or constellation symbols are being depicted and the gods/goddesses are identifiable with certain stars/constellations. It is established, however, that god/goddess symbols are depicted. The symbols on kudurru are the symbols of gods/goddesses who are invoked in the curses on anybody who breaks the terms of the land deed recorded on the monument. The symbols on Kassite kudurrus consolidated the Babylonian tradition of abstract representation of gods/goddesses. Kassite artists created and used symbols to represent gods/goddesses. In the Neo-Assyrian period abstract representation symbols were used for writing the names of kings. Interestingly, during the Kassite period, at the Išhtar temple at Warka the anthropomorphic depictions of gods/goddesses was continued.
Kudurrus contain an astral component in which iconographic symbols represent the abode of the the gods/goddesses of the highe st rank. The so-called astral trinity of the kudurrus comprises the astronomical bodies the Sun, the Moon and the Star (= the planet Venus).
Recent speculations and misunderstandings about kudurru symbols interpreted as astral
The group of 3 astral gods/goddesses - Shamash (the Sun), Nanna/Sin (the Moon), and Inanna/Ištar as Ninsianna (Venus) - whose grouping in iconography (especially kudurru) gives rise to speculation. (Interestingly, all 3 of these celestial bodies are each capable of casting a shadow on the earth.) There has recently (late 2015) been an upsurge on Hastro-L for the reintroduction of an astral interpretation of kudurru iconography. The issue involves little more than "going over old ground." The arguments being presented are characterised by their simplicity and superficiality. The methodology lacks any critical structure. The case is largely one involving inference. Criticisms are usually side-stepped/ignored. The use of the premise/argument "It makes no sense that Venus, Moon and Sun are accepted as celestial symbols [on kudurru], but other symbols are not." lacks demonstrated reliability. The Middle Babylonian kudurru have some astral symbols (but not

constellation symbols). Venus, the Moon, and the Sun are astronomical bodies (not constellations) and their symbols on Middle Babylonian kudurrus are representations of the gods/goddesses of these astronomical bodies: Ishtar, Sin, and Samas (not to be confused with con stellations and claims for constellation symbols). Because of their position in the sky the Sun, Moon, and Venus could oversee the earth and they were patrons of both justice and divination. The Storm-god Adad was also included with the Sun, Moon, and Venus. This is particularly evident in "The prayer to the gods of the night" where the 4 are referred to as "the gods and goddesses of the country." These 4 gods/goddesses are also those who order the 4 chapters/sections of the great divinatio n series Enūma Anu Enlil. There is an established hierarchy on kudurru in which gods/goddesses with the highest rank are placed above the next highest ranking gods/goddesses. That is why these celestial symbols are grouped together near the zenith of the kudurru. (The division into hierarchal zones also appears on cylinder seals.) (However, see Stanislaw Iwaniszewski (2003).) Assyriologists such as Ursula Seidl who have specifically studied kudurru conclude that god/goddess symbols are depicted on kudurru. The presence of the god/goddess symbols invoked the protection of the gods/goddesses depicted i.e., served as an appeal to or mark of god/goddess support. Specifically, they are the symbols of the gods/goddesses who are being invoked in bringing curses on those persons who desecrate the kudurru or break the land deed recorded on the kudurru. Though looking like a combination of "Scorpio" and "Sagittarius" both figures might readily symbolise the curses on the kudurru. The scorpion is a terrestrial agent of death. The other symbol of Išhara was the serpent or dragon (baśmu). What the scorpion and serpent have in common is the poisonous and deadly nature of both. As the scorpion (or serpent), Išhara can inflict pain. However, perhaps when the snake and the scorpion are p laced on the lowest register/panel (= ready to strike?) they represent the the Chtonian gods/goddesses of the underworld.

What some people loosely term astronomical symbols on kudurrus need to be divided into: (1) astral bodies, (2) the claim for constellations, (3) possible astral omens, and (4) the claim for such things as symbols coding the 3 stellar paths (shrines of Anu, Enlil and Ea - representing the paths in the heavens) and astronomical movements (the path of the Sun, Moon, and Venus (ecliptic/zodiac) intersects the Milky Way right between Sagittarius and Scorpius). The origin of this type of claim seems to date at least to the 2003 article by Stanislaw Iwaniszewski. Regarding claims for constellation iconography on kudurru. Not proven is their appearance on kudurru as constellations during the Kassite period. Regarding the latter claims. The few surviving early star lists show that the 3 stellar paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea were likely established in the Old Babylonian period (early 2nd-millennium BCE). I have never seen any professional assyriologist or art historian claim that the symbolic representations of the Enlil, Anu, and Ea on kudurru are intended to represent or infer the 3 stellar paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea. If the astral symbols for Venus, Moon, and Sun, and the symbol for the snake god Nirah, were placed between the Centaur and Scorpion symbols then perhaps the claimed astronomical interpretation would be regarded as more than speculation. People who want to make these sorts of claims need to offer a reasonable standard of evidence or identify that they are offering speculation. Also, no explanation is offered for exactly why this sort of astronomical symbolism/'information' would be included on commercial documents.
The assertion that kudurrus - even in some instances - constitute an observation record of some sort - remains unconvincing. Most usually overlooked is the explanation they are possibly connected with astral omens. David Brown (Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology (2000, Page 253)) remarks: "The symbols could equally well reflect "astrological" concerns different from that which pertained in the sky on the occasion of the kudu rru's manufacture, and/or the stylisation of the situation could be such as to make dating hopeless."

Morton Wagman incorrectly maintains (Lost Stars (2003)) that Sagittarius appears for the first time in Mesopotamian astronomical literature in the 8th-century BCE. The constellations scorpion-archer, scorpion, twins are attested during the Kassite period from star lists. (For a discussion of problems and confusions with the various 'Twins' constellations see: The Three Stars Each by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Page 114). Two different lists of 7 'Twins' constellations are known. Lists of 7 'Twins' appears in the so-called Great Star List.)
Kudurrus lack labels (excepting those from Susa) identifying the symbols with specific gods/goddesses. (Seven kudurrus, all from Susa have explanatory labels on a few of the symbols but it is not known who or where the labels were carved. As none of the kudurrus found in Babylonia bear labels identifying the gods/goddesses it seems likely that these labels were carved by the Elamites.) The kudurrus recovered from Susa had been brought as booty by Elamite invaders of Babylonia. However, numerous other types of objects have the name of the god/goddess written adjacent to the symbol. The Kassites have n ot left any type of testimony that symbols on kudurrus were intended to convey the astral nature of god/goddess attributes/associations. Regardless, there have been ongoing attempts to interpret the symbols as a representation of the night-sky constellations. The usual interpretation is to interpret the god/goddess symbols as legal witnesses to the land grant, since a number of gods/goddesses are invoked in the curses that constitute a section of the text. The idea that constellations are represented is the least convincing. The presence of the god/goddess symbols may have been merely to secure the protection of the gods/goddesses, since some similar memorial objects expressly implore the gods/goddesses depicted on them. This is likely connected with the fact that kudurrus - by their nature - lacked the endorsement of a royal seal. Kudurrus lack the impression of the royal seal as evidence of the king's sanction and authority. (Kudurrus - because they lacked a seal impression - were not a legal document. Sealing had fundamental importance.) The large and systematic Old Babylonian period AN=Anum series sets out a list of god/goddess names used in curses. It was well-known - and used - in the Late Kassite period.

The goddess Išhara is identified with label on a kudurru recovered from Susa. Regarding Sb 31: No 64; Sb is the prefix number from the French excavations at Susa.
The scorpion was a common symbol during the First Dynasty of Babylon and also the Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Seleucid periods. The scorpion symbol appeared on cylinder seals and also has been found carved on a stone bowl dated to the reign of King Rimus of Akkad (circa 22 00 BCE).
According to F. Wiggerman, Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (1992, Page 180), the appearance of the scorpion-man dates at least to the 3rdmillennium BCE, and is associated with the sun-god. (There are several traditions of scorpion men.) A scorpion-man could be depicted as an archer in a number of hybrid (composite) combinations. The picture of a scorpion is very common on kudurrus and there sometimes occurs a what is termed a "scorpion-archer." (The later constellation Sagittarius = a centaur with bow and arrow.) There are several different depictions of a centaur archer on kudurru. A strange hybrid (composite) creature as archer appears on a kudurru (BM 80858) alongside the goddess Gula and her dog. It comprises a half man (human head and arms holding a stretched bow, a scorpion's body and tail, and bird's feet. The representation of a 2-headed centaur archer that is a half-man, half horse with wings, and 2 tails - one a scorpion tail - is both early and late. It appears at the top of a Kassite dynasty kudurru in the British Museum and also appears on a Hellenistic/Seleucid period stamp seal. The late stamp seal image is interpreted as a depiction of the zodiacal constellation Sagittarius. All of the signs of the zodiac can be recognised on stamp seal designs of the Hellenistic period. (See: Catalogue of Western Asiatic Seals in the British Museum by Terence Mitchell and Ann Searight (2008 Page 218, and also see Pages 238-239).) For a recent study of Babylonian composite figures see: Composite Beings in Neo-Babylonian Art by Constance Gane (unpublished PhD thesis, 2012).
The 'evidence/proof' offered for a range of astronomical symbols on kudurru is frequently nebulous and most usually offered by a self-informed amateur. It is in many cases only opinion. There is a modern trend towards rejection of expertise and the blurring of the important distinction between facts and opinions. Plato stated that "Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance. Simply, statements by experts in his/her field are far more likely to be true than statements from a non-expert in the field. There are good reasons why we don't let amateurs design commercial aircraft and tall 'skyscraper' buildings.

Kudurru of King Marduk-zakir-shumi (854-819 BCE) with interesting iconography (including a fox). Underneath the serpent do we have the scorpion constellation and the Pleiades or Išhara and her 7 children the Sebetti/Sibitti (the 7 benevolent demon gods)? Peter van der Veen (2008) has pointed out the '7 dots' (commonly symbolising the Pleiades) do not appear on Kassite kudurrus, but only on post-Kassite Babylonian kudurrus from year 8 of Nabu-shuma-ishkun (circa 760-746 BCE) and Shamash-shum-ukin (667-648 BCE). The 7 dots (2 horizontal rows of 3 plus 1 to the right) are an Assyrian convention of rendering the sibitti. Only later were the 7 sibitti/sebittu associated with the Pleiades.

Several views of VA 3031 dating to reign of Nabu-shuma-ishkun (circa 760-746 BCE). VA 3031 (VAS 1 36/VS 1, 36) from Borsippa is tablet shaped. The 7 dots (2 horizontal rows of 3 plus 1 to the right) are in this post-Kassite period associated with the Pleiades. (Peter van der Veen (2008) has pointed out the '7 dots' (commonly symbolising the Pleiades) do not appear on Kassite kudurrus, but only on kudurrus from year 8 of Nabu-shuma-ishkun (circa 760-746 BCE) and Shamash-shum-ukin (667-648 BCE).)
It cannot be suitably determined whether the 8-pointed star was intended for Išhtar's symbol or had vaguer astral significance. The star as symbol of the goddess Išhtar was usually 8-pointed and was associated also with the crescent of Sin and the sun-disk of Samas. But the 8-pointed star was often introduced in a sense which had no obvious connection with the goddess, and in such cases it cannot be suitably determined whether it was intended for Iš htar's symbol or had a vaguer astral significance. In addition to the symbols of a number of gods/goddesses there are also images of 3 anthropomorphic gods/goddesses depicted. The iden tification of these 3 gods/goddesses is deemed uncertain by some. However, Joan Westenholz has pointed out the identification of th e god is readily established as Mar-biti (the Kassite god of war and the chase). She has also made the point that it can be confidently inferred that one of the goddesses is Nanaya (a goddess of war and seduction). The other goddess has been proposed as Ištar but as her symbol already appears the other goddess could be the goddess Sutitu, as she is mentioned in the text.
Regarding BM 102485 (see top illustration). That the serpent (snake) depicted starting at the top of kudurru and down one side is there to represent the Milky Way is, as far as I can see, speculation originating from Babylonian mythology. The claim that the Milky Way (= serpent/snake) intersects the ecliptic by the constellation Scorpius is easily demonstrated to be speculation. (The actual serpent on Kassite kudurrus is the magically protective MUS-SA-TUR.) The scorpion (gir.tab) appears during the Kassite period as a constellation (on astrolabes and star lists). That does not automatically mean its appearance on kudurrus = the constellation scorpion. The assertions of positional astral information include the concept that the identification of such was determined during the Kassite period. The scorpion is the symbol of the goddess Išhara (who dates at least to the 3rd-millennium BCE). The association between the scorpion and Išhara occurred during the Kassite period. (The earlier evidence is indefinite.) On a kudurru the scorpion is the symbol of the goddess Išhara (and may also be interpreted as meaning the scorpion constellation). But perhaps there is some connection with the male figure of the scorpion in Babylonian demonology. There may be another explanation. The goddess Išhara is identified with 'The Scorpion' in the Astrolabe star catalogues. See: The Three Stars Each by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Page 149) for the identification of mulGIR.TAB ('The Scorpion') as the Goddess of Heaven and Earth per Išhara as bēlet dadmē ('Lady of the World'), in Mul.Apin I ii 29.
Note: Regarding snakes in Mesopotamian uranography and on kudurrus. In Mesopotamian uranography, by the Old Babylonian period, the position of the north pole was constellated with a snake (Draco) and it can be surmised that by the Kassite period a snake constellation (Hydra) extended along part of the region of the celestial equator (and into the southern celestial hemisphere). Is there a possibility that a snake along the top of a kudurru represented the north pole region and/or a

snake down the side of a kudduru represented the celestial equator region (accepting that there is no specific evidence the Mesopotamians at that time specifically identified the celestial equator)? (I have not traced the history of this idea.) No room here for the Milky Way being represented by a snake. However, see Babylonian Creation Myths by Wilfred Lambert (2013, Page 240): "The snake [Irhan] on boundary stones often surrounds the other symbols since it is the river encircling the universe." The cult of Irhan, a god of the city of Ur representing the river Euphrates (represented as a snake), remained independent until the period of the 3rd Dynasty of Ur, but was later syncretised with the cult of the snake-god Nirah, a god of the city-state of Der. In 3rd-millennium BCE texts dMUS spells both Irhan and Nirah. The god Irhan/Nirah has been identified with the Euphrates. The syncretic Nirah/Irhan is both a river-god and a snake-god.
"In Old Babylonian oathtaking, the hydra (bašmu) was the symbol of Išḫara ..., but on boundary stones the scorpion represents her ... . In neither case is the reason for the attribute apparent, nor the grounds for the change. ... Astrologically the scorpion-star is identified with Išḫara, and she in turn with Tiāmat (mulgir-tab = dišḫa-ratam-tim." (Babylonian Creation Myths by Wilfred Lambert (2013, Pages 234 & 245.)
An interesting statement is made in: Cloudsley-Thompson, John. (1990). "Scorpions in Mythology, Folklore and History." In: Polis, Gary. (Editor). The Biology of Scorpions. (Pages 462-485). The author discusses in a popular style astral scorpions in different cultures. Where he discusses the history of astronomy he is generally unreliable. Professor John Leonard Cloudsley-Thompson (1921-2013) was a British naturalist renowned for his work on desert fauna and a pioneer in the study of desert wildlife. On page 464 of his 1990 article he writes: "A Kassite boundary stone of Melishihu found at Susa and dating from the twelfth century B.C. has two signs for the equinoxes - the vernal one being an arc with degrees, and the autumnal sign with a scorpion and the word n'ibiru, "crossing." No reference is given for this incredible statement. Unfortunately the article is cited by academics such as Victor Monserret (2012) when discussing anthropods in Mesopotamian art. The kudurru of Melishihu is black (sometimes described as grey) limestone and 65 centimetres high. It is now housed at the Louvre. The ob verse is composed of 5 iconographic registers, with representations of gods, humans and animals. There are 24 symbols. The reverse is a semicircular surface-in-the-round with 3 columns of cuneiform text.
The kudurru of Melishihu (1186-1172 BCE). It is inscribed in Akkadian and dates to the early 12th-century BCE. On many of the kudurrus found at Susa (the principal city of Elam/Elamite empire) the inscriptions are effaced or otherwise damaged. However, the kudurru of Melishihu is in almost perfect condition. (This kudurru is one of a number of Mesopotamian works found in Susa. They were brought there by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte (late 12th-century BCE) as part of the spoils of his victorious campaigns in Mesopotamia.) The lengthy inscription of the Kassite king Melishihu (alternative reading is Meli-Shipak) records a land gift by Melishihu to his son Marduk-apla-iddina I. Register V has 3 symbols including a snake and a scorpion.

Enlarged view of Register V of the kudurru of king Melishihu. The claim by John Cloudsley-Thompson (1990) of "an arc with degrees" is at the underneath of the head of the 'snake' (far right above the scorpion). What is actually being depicted in this area of the kudurru is a horned head. Depicted (and frequently identified as a snake) is a horned serpent (dragon/serpent-dragon) named Mushussu, an animal attribute (sacred animal/emblematic animal/symbol) of the god Marduk. The "arc with degrees" is an illusion created by the lighting on the surface of the kudurru when the photograph was taken from the particular position. This should also be evident from the "arc" not being an arc and the "degrees" being odd-shaped (and perhaps forming part of the lower head of the serpent-dragon).
BM 90858. White limestone kudurru for Ritti-Marduk (late 12th-century BCE). The scorpion is on a separate register to the "centaur archer" and they are both on a separate register to the astral symbols for Venus, the Moon, and the Sun.
The identification of the scorpion representations on kudurrus with the goddess Išhara is enabled through accompanying inscriptions. Assured representations of Išhara as a scorpion are identified by kudurru inscriptions dating to the 12th-century BCE. Išhara appears as a scorpion together with an inscription of her name on the registers/panels of the late Kassite kudurrus of Meli-Shipak (1188-1174 BCE) and Marduk-apla-iddina I (1173-1161 BCE). An additional 45 kudurrus depict a scorpion, but with no identifying inscription. (See: Seidl (1989; Pages 156-157).) Išhara is associated with the goddess Gula. Gula is usually the wife of Ninurta. The title of Pa-bil-sag was "vicegerent [= delegated earthly representative] of the Nether World," and he was also identified as the husband of Gula.
BM 102485 (see illustration at top of page) records a land grant to a man named Gula-eresh by Eanna-shum-idina (the governor of Sealand). The square box directly underneath the scorpion symbol represents the altar supporting the scorpion symbol of the goddess Išhara. (Consult Ursula Seidl (1989) or Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Archäologie. (Dritter Band 3, 1957-1971, Pages 483-490.)
The names provide no aid to interpret what is meant. Gir.tab simply means scorpion. Pa.bil.sag as the name of the centaur cannot be interpreted because it never occurs in any other context. (The hybrid (composite) loosely described as "scorpion archer" or "scorpion-tailed bird-man" is identified as Pabilsag.) The interpretation is given that the "scorpion-tailed bird-man" drawing a bow has a feathered body - or is wearing a feather robe. It is reasonably suggested that the scorpion-man is somewhat distinct from the "scorpion-tailed bird-man" and similar. Implying that the scorpion and centaur were not distinct is a mistake. The

symbol of the scorpion-archer is identified with Ninurta the fiery god of war and the south wind. Ninurta (depicted as an archer with the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion) standing on the back of a monster has also been identified with the planet Saturn. Pabilsag was identified with the god Ninurta.
Two depictions of hybrid centaur archers on Kassite period kudurrus. On the left is the so-called bird-man centaur drawing a bow, and on the right is a winged horseman centaur drawing a bow. Kudurru image on left is on a side of BM 90858. It is a limestone kudurru from ancient Sippar. It records the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (Second Dynasty of Isin) granting Šitti-Marduk freedom from taxation for services rendered during his invasion of Elam. Kudurru image on right is on a side of BM 90829. It is a limestone Kassite period (1186 BCE-1172 BCE) kudurru from ancient Sippar. There are numerous symbols carved onto the kudurru. The text contains a deed of gift of corn-land by Meli-Shipak to Khasardu.
A discussion of some Mesopotamian scorpion hybrids. Source: The Triumph of the Symbol: Pictorial Representations of Deities in Mesopotamia and the Biblical Image Ban by Tallay Ornan (2005, Page 123).
The triangular spade (blade; also appearing in some iconography with a long handle) of Marduk is a symbolic representation of the god (as is the horned dragon). I do not recall having seen either referred to as a representation of Jupiter. In my view it does not make sense (and doesn't c onstitute evidence) to suggest along the lines of: The spade symbol = Marduk; Marduk = Jupiter; the spade symbol = necessarily Jupiter. Circa the Kassite period the triangular-spade of Marduk was likely connected with agriculture. Also, the triangular spade of Marduk is depicted on a square box representing an altar. Similarly , the detective comparative approach of using Greco-Roman astral beliefs to substantiate claims for Mesopotamian beliefs only seems impressive if you already believe that on Kassite kudurru approximately 1000 years earlier the snake = Milky Way and the scorpion = constellation. This cannot be proven and also is not even indicated by what we already know. (The argument is made: According to Heraclides of Pontum, Herakles joined the gods by the gate near Scorpius. Centuries later, Macrobius wrote that the gates of the afterlife are at the intersections of the Zodiac (path of planets) and the Milky Way (Commentary on the Dream of Scipio; see: Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, translated with notes by William Harris Stahl (1990)). (Macrobius was explicit on what constituted a "gate" - the zodiacal/Milky Way crossings.) But this is a superficial coincidence at best. Also, unexplained is why Babylonian iconography is being associated with far later Roman poetry having no iconography. Associating a late Roman textual description with the speculated similarity and purpose of an early Mesopotamian graphic ought to be recognised as having the scope to be misleading. The natural snake depicted on the side of Kassite kudurrus is taken to represent the snake god Nirah(/Irhan) a god of the city-state of Der and the minister of the god Istaran (also worshipped at Der). The reading Nirah owes to Benno Landsberger but is perhaps more likely Irhan. (It is doubtful whether such an important figure such as the great serpent could be reliably associated with the obscure god Nirah. The natural snake association still has problems. The name of Nirah only (apparently) appears twice on all the kudurrus.)

Excursus 1: Vergil/Virgil placed Centaurs at the entrance of the underworld (Aeneid, Book 6 (The Entrance to Hades), Line 286), "And many other monstrous shapes of varied creatures, are stabled by the doors, Centaurs and bi-formed Scylla, and hundred-armed Briareus, and the Lernean Hydra, hissing fiercely, and the Chimaera armed with flame, Gorgons, and Harpies, and the triple bodied shade, Geryon." (Line 286 in bolden.) The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 BCE and 19 BCE. Franz Boll (Sphaera, (1903)) has shown that all the so-called "Hades-constellations" of the Sphaera Barbarica (Charon, Acheron, Acherousian Lake, kaphos, the ship of the dead) are located in Sagittarius. Vergil/Virgil (Georgics, Book 1. Line 34) has: "... where, between the Virgin and the grasping Claws [= the later constellation Libra], a space is opening (lo! for you even now the blazing Scorpion draws in his arms, and has left more than a due portion of the heaven!) – whatever you are to be (for Tartarus hopes not for you as king, and may such monstrous lust of empire nev er seize you, though Greece is enchanted by the Elysian fields ...." (= Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo-Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius.) (The entrance is in bolden.) But see Marcus Varro (apud Servius in Georgics, Book 1.

Maurus Servius Honoratus was a late 4th-century and early 5th-century CE grammarian, with the contemporary reputation of being the most learned man of his generation in Italy; he was the author of a set of commentaries on the works of Virgil. Marcus Terentius Varro (116 BCE-27 BCE) was a Roman scholar and writer. He is sometimes called Varro Reatinus to distinguish him from his younger contemporary Varro Atacinus.
Excursus 2: Some comments regarding connecting Jacob's ladder (i.e., Jacob's ladder dream, Genesis 28: 10 -17) and similar with the Milky Way. The ladder-toheaven motif can be found world-wide (See: F52 in Motif-index of Folk-literature by Stith Thompson (revised edition 1955-1958)). The ladder-to-heaven theme includes stairway-to-heaven, and heavenly rope. Various interpretations of the ladder-to-heaven (road to the sky) tales include: polar axis, Milky Way, world tree, as a ladder to heaven. There are traditions of a ladder (staircase) associated with a sun-god (i.e., solar ladders). Akkadian literature contains 3 explanations for ways the gates of heaven can be reached: (1) to fly like Etana (an ancient Sumerian king of the city of Kish) and the eagle, (2) to take a roadway, and (3) to climb a stairway. There is no implied association with the Milky Way. It might be argued that there is an implied association with the sun-god Shamash and his gateway(s) (gate(s) of heaven). In an Old Babylonian prayer (uttered at dawn) the sun-god Shamash opens the doors of heaven and ascends into heaven by a stairway to preside over a judicial assembly of the 7 great gods/goddesses (at dawn). Ereskigal, the goddess of the land of the dead (underworld), ascended the stairs of heaven to visit the gods/goddesses of heaven. Volk identifies that Manilius' ladder is simply a metaphor for the poets present work i.e., Astronomica. Within Christian mysticism, beginning with St. Perpetua's dream, the ladder became a common Christian symbol for the ascent to God (the transition from earthly to heavenly life). St. Perpetua was a Christian martyr of the 3rd century. It is recorded that Perpetua had multiple dreams prior to her martyrdom. Her first dream is categorised as a 'dragon-laddershepherd' dream. "Perpetua's first dream involves her avoiding a dragon, climbing a ladder, seeing a white-haired shepherd in an immense garden and tasting some cheese which the shepherd offers her." (Interpreting Perpetua and her Dreams by Jerrold Mitchell (unpublished PhD thesis, Episcopal Divinity School, 2001, Page 7).) Per a Christian telling: "Perpetua had a dream that seemed to foretell her fate. In it she saw a ladder going up to Heaven. At the foot of the ladder was a fierce dragon, and attached to the sides of the ladder were knives, lances, and other sharp instruments set in such a way that anyone ascending the ladder would be severely cut. In her dream she saw Saturus, her Christian teacher and fellow prisoner, calling from the top of the ladder for her to f ollow him up. She saw many people in white robes standing in a garden and they were led by a man with white hair dressed in shepherd's clothing. The dragon actually placed his head so she could step up on it to reach the ladder. She climbed up, and the white haired man gave her some sweet curds to eat as the people cried "Amen"." (http://www.jaysromanhistory.com/romeweb/christns/perpetua.htm) See also: Volk, Katharina. (2004, 2009). ""Heavenly Steps": Manilius 4.119–121 and Its Background." In: Boustan [sometimes mistakenly Boustant], Ra'anan. and Reed, Annette. (Editors). Heavenly Realms and Earthly Realities in Late Antique Religions (Pages 34-46).
Sometimes well-intended efforts establish misunderstandings. As example: The illustrations and captions in Astrological Reports to Assyrian Kings by Hermann Hunger (1992) contain speculative statements. One caption (page 134) reads: "FIG 11. Sun, moon, eight-pointed star (Venus), Hydra and Scorpio depicted on a boundary stone from the time of Melisipak. The function of the astral symbols on the boundary stones is disputed, but recent research indicates that they record actual astronomical observations made at the time the stones were erected and can thus be used for establishing the absolute dates of these monuments. BM 90827." According to my understanding all the illustrations and captions in Hermann Hunger's 1992 book were included by the publisher without the knowledge of the author. Whoever wrote this caption and the others was apparently influenced by the publications of Vladimir Tuman and Ulla Ko ch, 1987 to 1991. Whether the constellations 'Hydra' and 'Scorpio' are being depicted cannot presently be proven. In their article "Eine neue Interpretatio n der Kudurru-Symbole." (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 41, 1990/1991, Pages 93-114) the authors Ulla Koch, Joachim Schaper, Susanne Fischer, and Michael Wegelin make a modern attempt to identify and date constellations. They proposed that the symbols placed on kudurrus were star maps for a given date. This has not been acknowledged as successful. Attempts to date kudurru by assuming their iconography has astral significance and then using the arrangement of their iconography to establish astronomical dates remains both speculative and unproven.
The more astute interpretation is to interpret the god/goddess symbols in connection with the purpose of the kudurrus as property documents: (1) Representing the gods/goddesses invoked as guardians of the property title. (2) As legal witnesses to the land grant, since a number of gods/g oddesses are invoked in the curses that constitute a section of the text. (3) To secure the protection of the gods/goddesses, since some similar memorial objects expressly implore the gods/goddesses depicted on them. The texts themselves clearly state that the symbols served as additional protective agencies to the kudurru and the land transaction. Placed on the kudurru is the emblem of each god/goddess involved.

Daniel Potts makes the point that: Divine symbols also appear in oaths and legal texts where, in taking the oath, the oath-taker swears by the symbol of a particular god/goddess. One example given is the depiction on the Stele of Vultures. (Source: Mesopotamian Civilization: The Material fo undations by Daniel Potts (1997, Page 193).) The stele known as the Stele of the Vultures is a monument from the Early Dynastic III period (2600–2350 BCE) in Mesopotamia. It was erected in 2450 BCE by this King of the city-state of Lagash to commemorate his victory over the city of Umma. The stele was originally carved out of a single slab of limestone but only seven fragments are known today. The fragments were found at Tello (ancient Girsu) in southern Iraq in the late 19th-century and are now on display in the Louvre.
Interestingly, the claim has also been made that echoes of the impact of the Akkadian empire can be found in Roman times. It has been claimed that an omen-text concerning Sargon of Akkad has been traced down to Roman poets. (See: Vladimir Schileico, "Eine Omentext Sargons von Akkad und sein Nachklang bei römischen Dichtern." Archiv für Orientforschung, Band 5[-6?], 1928-1929, Pages 214-18.) However, a dissenting opinion exists. (See: Piotr Michalowski. "Memory and Deed: The Historiography of the Political Expansion of the Akkad State." In: Mario Liverani. (Editor). Akkad, The First World Empire (1993; 86f.).)
Scorpion-people opening and closing the gates of the sun does not prove that the scorpions were a single figure constellation. There is only 1 scorpion constellation. There were at least 2 scorpion-people guarding/opening and closing the gates of the sun god. The Babylonian scorpion constellation is a natural scorpion. (But this does not mean that it can be readily accepted that the depiction of a natural scorpion on Kassite period kudurru can be taken as a constellation. Varieties of scorpion symbols were prolific during the Kassite period, and later.) The scorpion-people - as the term implies - were composite beings = scorpion and human compositional elements. The scorpion-people were powerful servants of the sun god Utu (Samas). Also, what are we to make of scorpion-bird-people and scorpion-fish-people depicted on Kassite stamp/cylinder seals?
In the Gilgamesh epic the scorpion man and scorpion woman guarded the cosmic mountain. In a Neo-Assyrian seal scene they are also guardians of the so-called Assyrian Tree of Life. Scorpion-people were created by Tiamat as one of her weapons against Marduk. In the later Babylonian world map the scorpion -person is placed by Marduk to the area on 'top of the restless sea.'
Older publications of kudurru need to be used with caution. The astronomical interpretation of kudurru dates back to Astronomisches aus Babylon (1889) by Joseph Epping and Johann Strassmaier. The publication of Babylonian Boundary-Stones and Memorial-Tablets in the British Museum by Leonard King (1912 (accompanied by an Atlas of Plates)) was a key publication in helping to cement the mistaken idea of an early zodiac. In the Preface by Ernest Budge (E. A. Wallis Budge) and in the Introduction by Leonard King both (mistakenly) speculate that the kudurru symbols have an astral connection with zodiacal constellations. In this speculation Ernest Budge is less cautious than Leonard King. The concept of zodiacal constellations along the ecliptic did not exist as early as the Kassite period. The undoubted primary purpose of the symbols is representing the gods/goddesses invoked as guardians of the property title. Attempts to ide ntify the symbols with a set of constellations quickly breaks down because of the varying order and number on different kudurru. Attempts at identification with various constellation positions in the sky, using the register positions of the symbols, has also been unsuccessful.
In equating the scorpion on kudurrus to the constellation Scorpius, Sara Pizzimenti (2014/2015) is in some ways maintaining previously expressed (and similar) views. Gwendolyn Leick (an anthropologist and assyriologist) maintains that the scorpion-archer on kudurru is the constellation Sagittarius or Scorpio (The Babylonian World (2009, Page 163)).

There are additional issues. The texts which we have concerning Babylonian zodiacal iconography are few in number. It is difficult to say whether the signs of the zodiac of the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE) are derived from the god/goddess symbols inscribed on kudurrus. We do not know the constellation boundaries of the figures. How the ancient Mesopotamians viewed the configurations of the constellations and the boundaries between them is not presently known and may remain unknown.
The attempt to use kudurru symbols to draw a map of the Babylonian constellations was undertaken by the Panbabylonists. An early, fully elaborated, (but erroneous) theory of kudurru symbols as zodiacal signs was proposed by Fritz Hommel (Aufsätze und Abhandlungen, 1900, Pages 236 -272, 350-372, and 434-474). The most detailed attempt was also later made by Fritz Hommel (Zu den babylonischen Grenzsteinsymbolen (1920)) who perceived in the kudurru symbols an equatorial zodiac dating to the 5th-millennium BCE. In their article "Eine neue Interpretation der Kudurru-Symbole." (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 41, 1990/1991, Pages 93-114) the authors Ulla Koch, Joachim Schaper, Susanne Fischer, and Michael Wegelin also attempt to identify and date constellations. They proposed that the symbols placed on kudurrus were star maps for a given date. This has not been acknowledged as successful. A large part of kudurrus are comprised of abstract god/goddess symbols. In kudurru imagery there is a tendency to avoid anthropomorphic representations of gods/goddesses by replacing them with symbols. Attempts to date kudurru by assuming their iconography has astral significance and then using the arrangement of their iconography to establish astronomical dates is both speculative and unproven. Over 40 symbols appear on kudurru. The arrangement of symbols do not occur in a fixed order on kudurru but vary. Each kudurru is unique. Variation exists in the number and choices of gods/goddesses that appear on kudurru.
The interpretation of scenes in ancient Mesopotamian art is deemed immensely difficult. According to Edith Porada, the late eminent authority on ancient Near East imagery, mythological, ritual, or other scenes remain unintelligible due to our inability to identify most of the principal figures and their actions. Some of the major gods/goddesses can be identified on the basis of textual descriptions. Kudurru are a genre of administrative documents (monument documents). Finding astronomical connections with the symbols - without over-interpreting - has been demonstrated to be fraught with difficulty. The exact meaning of the god/goddess symbols on kudurru remains unclear. It is now recognised that the use of acknowledged astral symbols can embody many meanings, such as the involvement of gods/goddesses in the human/terrestrial sphere.
Ursula Seidl, a present-day kudurru expert, maintains in her article "Göttersymbole und -attribute." (Reallexikon der Assyriologie (Dritter Band 3, 1957-1971, Pages 483-490)) that kudurru iconography has no astral significance. (See also her book: Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten
(1989). In this book, regarded as the standard study of kudurru iconography, she maintains her scepticism that kudurru symbols have an astral significance.) This would appear to except the 8-pointed star, the crescent, and the solar symbol. The Middle Babylonian kudurru have some astral symbols (but not constellation symbols). As example: The first register of the kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar 1 (reigned 1124-1104 BCE) show the 8-pointed star (Venus), the lunar crescent, and the solar symbol (solar disk, wavy-lined, 4-pointed sun disk). The same applies to the kudurru of Meli-Shipak II. See also kudurru BM 102485 above. More recently (2008) Peter van der Veen has pointed out the '7 dots' (commonly symbolising the Pleiades) do appear on kudurrus, but only on kudurrus from year 8 of Nabushuma-ishkun (circa 760-746 BCE) and Shamash-shum-ukin (667-648 BCE).
Note: On page 140 of her book, Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten (1989), Ursula Seidl mentions a kudurru with a lion symbol that the French archaeologist and assyriologist Franēois Thureau-Dangin identified with the constellation Leo. Some of the "sitting dogs" = lions on kudurrus have been interpreted to be depictions of the (pre-zodiacal) constellation Leo. (In Mesopotamia lions were grouped with dogs simply because their names were derived from the same Sumerian ideogram.) In his 1907 pioneering study of kudurrus (A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur), William Hinke makes the connection of Leo with the kudurru symbols. Leonard King, Babylonian Boundary-Stones and Memorial Tablets (1912, 2 Volumes) identifies the sitting dog on kudurru as as possibly the "zodiacal" Leo. These speculations get copied. In his article "Origins of Ancient Constellations: 1, The Mesopotamian Traditions." (JBAA, February 1998), John Rogers (using Hinke, (possibly) King, and also Seidl (1989)) identifies the sitting dog on kudurru as possibly the "zodiacal" Leo. There was no zodiac established in the 2nd-millennium BCE; what can only be sensibly meant is a pre-zodiacal lion (Leo). A definite mention of a Mesopotamian lion constellation first appears in Hilprecht's Nippur Text HS 245 (= HS 229) (Kassite Period 1530-1160 BCE), and the Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru (Kassite Period circa 1350 BCE).
See further: Van Buren, Elizabeth. (1939-1941). "The Seven Dots in Mesopotamian Art and their Meaning." (Archiv für Orientforschung, Band 13, Pages 277-289). Van Buren proposal: The seven dots in Mesopotamian art are thought to have perhaps originally represented bones used for casting oracles then changed to representing (or encompass representing) the seven gods, then, by Assyrian times, to have represented the Pleiades. For an informed criticism of the basic tenets of the article see Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopotamia by (the historian) Beatrice Goff (1963) Pages 122-123. The identification of the seven dots is first known with certainty in Mitannian glyptic art circa 1500 BCE (where they form a ring or rosette). During this early period they were also arranged in two rows of three headed by a seven dot. Earlier use of (seven) dots have no precise order and no uniform size. The seven dots perhaps originally repr esented the Sibittu, the seven unnamed gods (who may have been associated with the Pleiades). (There were actually two groups of Sibittu, the good gods and the evil demons.) The identification of the seven dots with the (seven) incantation stones/pebbles used for giving oracles by casting lots is not firmly established. At least from the Middle Assyrian Period (1400-1050 BCE) the seven dots appear in close association with clearly established astral symbols such as the solar disk and the lunar crescent. During the Assyrian Period they also became shaped like stars. This substitution of the seven dots by seven stars during the Neo -Assyrian Period (934-610 BCE) and Neo-Babylonian Period (626-539 BCE) may be an identification with the Pleiades. Only much later are they firmly identified in texts with the Pleiades. The Seleucid Period tablet (circa 3rd-century BCE) VAT7851 has the seven dots labelled MUL.MUL (= Pleiades).

Appendix 1: Symbols Depicted on BM 102485
Upper register: (1) Solar disk, (2) Crescent, (3) Eight-pointed star, (4) Horned head-dress upon a shrine, (5) Horned head-dress upon a shrine, (6) Turtle upon a shrine, (7) Twin spirals upon a shrine (the spirals curl inward and spring from a stem), (8) Wedge upon a shrine (the thicker edge of the wedge is indented, and its face is ornamented with a decorative band), (9) Spear-head upon a shrine.
Lower register: (10) Lightning-fork upon a shrine, (11) Lamp upon a shrine, (12) Yoke upon a shrine (the shrine depicted here is of a quite unusual type), (13) Scorpion upon a shrine, Dog upon a shrine, (15) Lion-headed mace upon a shrine (the portion below the head is scaled like a serpent). (The emblems on the lower register are separated from the shrines on which they rest by a plain band.)
Below the second register: (16) Sheaf of corn (the stems are continued below the horizontal band suggesting we have a sheaf or bundle).
Top of kudurru: (17) Serpent (snake) (engraved down one side of the kudurru).
Appendix 2: The Earliest Surviving Boundary-Stone
The oldest surviving boundary-stone (the Cone of Entemena) dates to the Sumerian king Entemena of Lagash circa 2400 BCE. It is a national boundary -stone - a record of a treaty of delimitation. It records a line of division between respective territories.
Appendix 3: Claims for Association Between Milky Way and Labyrinths
The claim that labyrinths represent the Milky Way is simply speculation. John O'Neill in his informed (but somewhat speculative) 2-volume study of what he believed was astral symbolism, The Night of the Gods (1893-1897), has a chapter on the labyrinth in Volume 2 but does not associate it with the Milky Way. The recent revision of the detailed study, Through the Labyrinth (2000) by Hermann Kern discusses and rejects the explanations of planetary associations. For a reasonable detailed discussion of Babylonian labyrinths see: "The Babylonian Labyrinths." by Richard Shelton in Caerdro: The Journal of Mazes and Labyrinths, Volume 42, March 2014, Pages 7-29. The article includes discussion of a number of little known labyrinthine clay tablets from the Near East.
The late Iranian art expert Phyllis Ackerman in her bold essay "The Dawn of Religions" (Chapter 2 of Ancient Religions: A Symposium edited by Vergilius Ferm (1950)) frequently included interpretations of the importance of the Milky Way. (It's possibly her better speculative essay on the topic.) She does not make any associated between the Milky Way and labyrinths.

George Latura wrote (Hastro-L, 4-12-2015): [snip] "The Mesoamerican Milky Way crocodile god that is killed finds parallel in Mesopotamian myth where Tiamat's corpse is flung into the heavens by Marduk (Jupiter)." [snip]. No reference are provided to establish the parallelism claimed. My check of relevant scholarly references demonstrates they contradict or fail to support Latura's claims:
(1) In Mesoamerican creation mythology there is the sacrifice/killing of a crocodile/monster in order to create the earth and sky. (Palenque by Damien Marken (2007, Page 215.)
(2) Karen Bassie-Sweet (Maya Sacred Geography and the Creation Deities (2008/2014, "The Milky Way Crocodile" Pages 266-268) does mention that the god GI performed the "decaptitation" of one or more crocodiles. She does not mention Marduk or Tiamat.
(3) The diffusionist John Sorenson (Sino-Platonic Papers, Number 195, December 2009) though claiming every sort of parallelism between Mesoamerica and the Old World is silent on this "correspondence."
(4) The claim of a Mesoamerican-Mesopotamian parallel is made by Graham Hancock in his 1995 book (Page 144), Fingerprints of the Gods. He has Quetzalcoatl = Marduk, and Cipactli = Tiamat.
(5) Hancock cites (a) Pre-Hispanic Gods of Mexico by Adela Fernandez (1992, Page 59), and (b) Aztecs by Inga Glendinnen (1995, Page 177).
(6) According to Inga Clendinnen (Page 251) in the Nahuatl version of the myth 2 sky gods, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca are said to have seized the limbs of the great Earth Monster (not specifically identified with a crocodile) as she swam in the primeval waters, and wrenched her body in half, one part forming the sky and the other part forming the earth. I have not yet seen the book by Adela Fernandez.

Tabular Astrolabe B (VAT 9416 (KAV 218) dating to the 12th-century BCE). Astrolabe B is the main example of the "3 stars each" genre (a tabular/rectangular astrolabe). Astrolabe B is not exclusively nor primarily an astronomical document. Astrolabe B is a multifunctional text - serving as an astronomical treatise as well as a theological treatise. It is more strongly a theological treatise. The astronomical content of Astrolabe B is highly schematised. Astrolabe B was composed in the same political context as Enūma eliš and reflects the victory of Nebuchadnezzar I over Elam circa 1100 BCE. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz, an expert on Mesopotamian "astrolabes," states (1998, Page 157): "Although Astrolabe B (KAV 218), the earliest known example of the "Astrolabes," is found on a Middle Assyrian tablet, it is probable that the first "Astrolabe" was composed no later than the Middle Assyrian Period and perhaps as early as the Old Babylonian Period." (See the detailed discussion: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Pages 157-161.) Within his discussion Horowitz makes the point that the earliest surviving evidence for month-stars and for the division of the sky into 3 paths belonging to Anu, Enlil, and Ea is found in the Middle Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night from Boghqazkoi (KUB 4 47) dated to the 13th-century BCE, and the Middle Assyrian star-catalogue from Nippur (HS 1897). A Middle Babylonian or older origin for the first Astrolabe is indicated by evidence provided by the Babylonian fragment VAS 24 120 and KAV

Late 19th-century drawing by the British assyriologist Theophilus Pinches of the obverse and reverse sides of the circular Babylonian star calendar fragment/"astrolabe" SM 162 from (from CT 33 11) in the British Museum. (Obverse fragment on left and reverse fragment on right.) The fragment was recovered from Nineveh. The fragment is on display in the British Museum, London. Multiple fragments of late 2ndmillennium circular star calendars are in the British Museum collection. (Two of the fragments of circular astrolabes in the British Museum can be joined.) Unfortunately it appears some of these fragments can no longer be located within the collection of cuneiform material. Extant circular exemplars include: CT 33 11 (= Sm. 162) and CT 33 12 (= K. 14943 +); extant list (tabular) exemplars: KAV 218 (= VAT 9461), LBAT 1499 (= 34713) and LBAT 1500 (= BM 34387). Also, BM 82923. This late 1st millennium BCE star catalogue preserves identification of Astrolabe month-stars. The stellar system that lies at the core of the Astrolabe: 36 stars rise in sequence, 3 stars per month (each star in a different stellar path in the sky), over an annual (ideal) 360-day year circuit. However, the empirical structure of the astrolabe was subject to divinatory beliefs. A fragment is signed by the scribe Nab-Zuqup-Kenu, who lived during the reigns of Sargon II (720-704 BCE) and Sennacherib (703-680 BCE).
The so-called astrolabes constitute a fundamental corpus of early Babylonian astronomical texts. The Astrolabes helped people determine the months of the year. The star calendar/"astrolabe" genre first appeared in tabular form and then later in circular form. According to the assyriologists Wayne Horowitz and David Brown, the Mesopotamian 'astrolabes' (only) purport to name the 36 stars that define the 12 months of the schematic (ideal) astronomical year by the method of identifying 1 star for each month in each of the 3 stellar paths. The use of the planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter as month-stars in the astrolabes is problematic. It may indicate the astrolabes were intended to be used for a single year or that the gods associated with the planets (at least Inanna/Venus and Marduk/Jupiter) had important roles in New Year ceremonies. The empirical structure of the astrolabes was subject to divinatory beliefs.
These circular star calendars are popularly but erroneously called "astrolabes" or "planispheres" but correctly are perhaps calendars related to the tradition of the ideal astronomical year (of 360 days) and have the Babylonian title mul.meš.3.ta.àm (= "the stars, three of each"). (See CT 33, Plate 12.) Wayne Horowitz has succinctly explained (The Encyclopedia of Ancient History): "The term "Astrolabe," as it is used in the context of ancient Mesopotamian astronomy, is a misnomer, having no relation to the antique astronomical instrument of the same name." The star calendars ("astrolabes") were closely related to the tradition of the ideal astronomical year of 12 months x 30 days each. (John Steele succinctly explains: "The schematic 360day year was used as a simplifying tool in Babylonian accounting practice and astronomical calculations.") Their apparent purpose is to identify stars that rose each month in the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. As such

they list 36 month-stars, one for each Path every month. The name "Astrolabe" originates with George Smith's description of Sm. 162 (as it was later registered at the British Museum) on pages 407-408 of his book, Assyrian Discoveries (1875).
"It is only in the 2nd millennium BCE that texts appear which are dealing with phenomena in the sky. In these texts we see a desire to find out how the skies are organised, and a belief that this organization can be understood and described in relatively simple ways. The use of observation is limited: while obviously one must look at the sky to be able to say something about it, schematic approaches were predominant .... An example for this are the so-called Three-stars-each texts which probably go back to between 1500 and 1000 BCE. They list, for each month of the Babylonian calendar, three constellations which are supposed to become visible in this month: one constellation to the North, one near the equator [there is no word for equator in these texts], and one to the South; it is furthermore stated that the same constellations disappear again after six months. This gives a neat scheme of 36 constellations from whose risings one could tell the time of year. However, it would not work in practice: first of all, the period of visibility is different for stars depending on their declination; it is simply incorrect to assign all of them a visibility of six months. Then, the Babylonian calendar is not easily attuned to the solar year so that helical risings of stars will not stay in the same month every year. And, just to indicate that we are far from a secure interpretation, the lists also include planets, which are subject to entirely different visibility conditions, independent of the time of the year; finally there are even variant forms of the list which have only ten constellations - instead of 12 - which makes an alignment with the months of the year impossible. The Three-stars-each lists may be seen as attempts to organise what is known about stars. At about the same time an astronomical text was compiled, called Mul-Apin (which means Plough star) after its first word. It is only attested on tablets from the 7th century [BCE] onwards, but probably goes back to the 13th century BCE." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and society." In: Valls-Gabaud, D. and Boksenberg, A. (Editors). The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture. Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Pages 62-33).)
By convention is it usual to call examples of Mesopotamian star calendars 'astrolabes.' (A true astrolabe is used to measure the angular height of a celestial object.) It is not correct to call examples of Mesopotamian star calendars 'planispheres.' The astrolabes are not actually planispheric. They are not a star chart representing a sphere or part of a sphere on a plane surface. Astrolabes are not planispheres, and planispheres are not astrolabes. The function of an 'astrolabe' is to 'depict' the entire sky over the course of a schematic (model) year. Examples of Mesopotamian astrolabes are Astrolabe B (tabular), Astrolabe Z (tabular), K 14943 + 81-7-27, 94 (= 1881,0727.94) (circular), and SM. 162 (circular). (The tabular astrolabes have multicolumn text.) The only 2 surviving planispheres known are K 8538, and a Neo-Babylonian tablet (from Sippar) showing the ziqpu (zenith) stars. Both of these planispheres are disk-shaped, both divide the circles of the sky into equal parts, and both make use of dots to represent stars. The astrolabes map out stars (and even planets) and constellations in various parts of the sky for the 12 months of the ideal (schematic) year. This is either done by: (1) use of a diagrammatic form (i.e., astrolabe), or (2) by listing. The star calendars are an example of simple mathematical astronomy. Their functions are to: (1) correlate the heliacal risings of chosen stars with calendar dates; and (2) set out a numerical system for estimating the changing length of day hours and night hours throughout the year. Johannes Koch made the point that the purpose of the circular astrolabe was: (1) an orientation guide, and (2) an aid to remembering which stars appear in particular parts of the sky.
The stars visible in the Babylonian night sky were originally divided into into 3 paths (ways) = the night sky was divided into 3 parts = northern, central, and southern regions. The stars of the path of Enlil in the northern region of the sky are, in modern terms, estimated to be within + 17 degrees of declination north. The stars of the path of Ea in the southern region of the sky are, in modern terms estimated to be within - 17 degrees of declination south. The stars of the path of Anu, located between the north and south paths, in the central region (but not strictly an equatorial band), are in modern terms, estimated to be within + 17 degrees of declination north and - 17 degrees of declination south. This system originated in the Old Babylonian period and continued until the Neo-Babylonian period.
Circular star calendar (astrolabe) fragments in the British Museum:
SM 162 is a copy of an older text. The text in the British Museum is a copy by Nabû-zuqup-kēnu. He was a scribe who flourished during the reigns of Sargon II (720-704 BCE) and Sennacherib (703-680 BCE). The

information contained on SM 162 probably dates back to circa 1100 BCE.
Three circular star calendar fragments (apparently not all presently locatable) are briefly described in the Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets of the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum by Carl Bezold (5 Volumes; 1889-1899):
The description of Fragment Sm. 162 (in Volume IV. Page 1385) is: "Portion of the section of a sphere or astrolabe, 2 9/16 in. by 2 in.; 7/8 in. high. The flat side is inscribed with the names of the months, names and figures of certain stars and numbers of certain degrees." (See also CT 33 11.)
The description of Fragment Number 83-1-18, 608 (Page 1904) is: "Portion of a sphere or astrolabe, 2 3/8 in. by 1 5/16 in.; 5/8 in. high. The flat side appears to have been inscribed with the names and figures of certain stars." (See also CT 33 12.) (Astrolabe K = K 14943 (+) 83-1-18, 608 (CT 33 12).)
The description of Fragment Number 81-07-27, 94 (Page 1803) is: "Portion of a sphere or astrolabe, 3 3/4 in. by 2 1/8 in.; 1 in. high. The flat side appears to have been inscribed with the names of the months, and names and figures of certain stars."
Modern descriptions by the British Museum of the circular star calendar fragments in its possession are:
(1) BM registration number: SM 162; clay tablet, fragment, length: 6.35 centimetres, width: 5.71 centimetres, acquired by BM in 18??; excavated by George Smith; excavated/findspot - Kouyunjik (Niniveh); associated with library of Ashurbanipal; period/culture - Neo-Assyrian (circa 911-612 BCE); fragment of a circular clay tablet with a record of constellations (planisphere), 4 curved + 13 lines of inscription and diagram.

However, according to Wayne Horowitz (The Three Stars Each (2014)), to date only 3 fragments of circular astrolabes have been recovered from 2 surviving original examples, both dating to the Neo-Assyrian period.
"The division of the heavens into three 'paths' (KASGAL) is found already in second-millennium texts and acts as the principal way of categorizing stars in second millennium and early first-millennium texts such as MUL.APIN, the so-called 'Astrolabes', and omens from Enūma Anu Enlil , as well as literary texts. No text explicitly states that the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea together comprise the entire sky. As first recognized by Bezold, the stars in the path of Anu rise in a region extending about 15 degrees north and south of the eastwest line, those in the path of Enlil rise above the horizon to the north of this, and those in the path of Ea to the south of it. The three paths were interpreted by Weidner, Schaumberger (who increased the boundaries of the path of Anu to about 17 degrees), and others as extending in declination bands stretching across the sky. By contrast, Pingree has argued that the three paths did not cover the whole sky but instead were conceived of only as arcs along the horizon over which stars and planets rise or set. Lambert and Horowitz, however, have argued from literary evidence than the three paths were indeed considered to cross the sky from east to

west. ("Celestial Measurement in Babylonian Astronomy." by John Steele (Annals of Science, Volume 64, Number 3, 2007, Pages 293-325.) The accepted identification of the Three Ways is: Enlil (god of the earth) = North; Anu (god of the sky) = Central; and Ea (god of the water) = South. However, at time, some authors identify differently. In Mesopotamian Astrology (1995) Ulla Koch has: Ea = North; Anu = Central; and Enlil = South. In Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (1999) Wayne Horowitz has: Anu = North; Enlil = Central; and Ea = South.
The Astrolabes helped people determine the months of the year. A 1934 reconstruction of a Babylonian circular star calendar by the German Assyriologist Albert Schott. Fragments only of these clay discs were found in Ashurbanipal's library. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz, an expert on astrolabes - he has been studying them for some 2 decades - states the astrolabe group of tablets never reached a canonical form. Competing versions circulated. "For the Astrolabes ... the group never reached a canonical form which could be passed down from generation to generation. Hence, the four sections of the earliest and most complete form of the Astrolabes, the so-called 12th-century Berlin Astrolabe, better known as Astrolabe B, never occur together on any earlier or later tablet belonging to the group, although each of the four sections survives separately into the first millennium." (Writing Science before the Greeks by Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz (2011, Page 13).) (See also the (English-language) essay review, "What and How Can We learn from the Babylonian Astronomical Compendium MUL.APIN?" by Liz Brack-Bersen in Annals of Science, Volume 69, Issue ?, 2012, Pages 1-5.)
The last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE gave rise to the Astrolabe tradition. The so-called astrolabes constitute a fundamental corpus of early Babylonian astronomical texts. The earliest exemplar originates from the Middle Assyrian period reign of Tiglath-Pileser I (1115-1077 BCE). It is thought to be a copy from an earlier - perhaps Old Babylonian period - source. The particulat text was still being copied in the Seleucid period (circa 3rd-century BCE). It has been speculated by the assyriologist David Brown that the foundation of the Astrolabe tradition may go back to the 3rd-millennium BCE.

The circular Astrolabe (example: CT 33, 10) is a late 2nd-milennium BCE astronomical text. The Enuma Anu Enlil is a late 2nd-millennium BCE omen series comprising approximately 70 tablets. In the commentary to tablet 50 of this omen series the traditional gods Anu, Enlil, and Ea make the constellations. The Enuma Elish is a 1st-millennium BCE literary text/composition. (The Enuma elish is essentially a narrative of the sacred city of Babylon and the construction of its central shrine, Esagila.) The organisation of the sky and arrangement of the stars (i.e., per the Astrolabes) is done by Marduk, instead of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. In the Enuma Elish, the god Marduk arranges the stars in the sky in the image of the Astrolabes. In Ee V 3-4 Marduk drew boundary lines in the sky; an apparent reference to the boundary lines drawn on the circular astrolabes to divide the star paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. (Also, the 12 divisions of the year are the months of the schematic year, and not a reference to any zodiac or any zodiacal constellations.)
Examples of early Babylonian star calendars (so-called "astrolabes" (actually a modern misnomer), properly the Three Stars Each (kakkabū 3ta.am)) exist in both original circular form and later tabular (list) form. The confusing term "astrolabes" was introduced 1900 by the pioneering assyriologist Theophilus Pinches (likely because some texts are circular and therefore have a superficial resemblance to the modern astrolabe). However, the so-called Babylonian astrolabes are only diagrams, not observational instruments. Only 2 fragmentary examples of circular star calendars are known. Both date to the Neo-Assyrian period. A larger number of tabular star calendars exist. The theory of the Three Stars Each is briefly explained in KAV 218 D 13-36 (Astrolabe B), and the creation epic Enuma Elish V 1-8. The Three Stars Each group of texts date from the Kassite period.
The Babylonian circular astrolabes are a primitive type of schematized planisphere. (Simply (at face value) a crude star map on a clay disc, without a grid.) The early Babylonian "astrolabes" only list the names of selected constellations (and planets) that were placed into schematic arrangements. Thus they are not correctly/truly a planisphere. However, whilst the circular astrolabes are not planispheric they do, however, map out particular (idealised) calendar stars. With the circular astrolabes the stars are shown in diagrammatic form within 3 concentric circles. The groups of stars used are defined by their locations with respect to the horizon.
The Babylonian circular star calendar was divided into 36 individual stellar sectors (with one sector for each of the 36 stars) comprising 3 concentric bands (rings) (marking the borders between the 3 stellar paths) each divided by 12 radial lines (demarking the 12 months of the year). The stars of Ea comprise the outer band (ring) = the southern part of the sky; the stars of Anu comprise the middle/central band (ring) = the central band of the sky; and the stars of Enlil comprise the inner band (ring) = the northern part of the sky. (There is no word for 'equator' in the astrolabe texts. The concept of a celestial equator was not recognised.) The 12 radial segments represent the 12 months of the unintercalated (i.e., "ideal") year. The names of each month of the year, from Nisan to Adar, appear in clockwise order/direction in the outer band segments. In surviving fragments of circular "astrolabes" the stars are either drawn as 6-pointed star figures (CT 33 11) or as circles (CT 33 12).
Wayne Horowitz (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (1998, Page 166) writes: "Terms for star-sectors, the areas surrounding stars and constellations, may be related to the spaces surrounding each star on the circular "Astrolabes." These terms include qaqqaru 'territory' and pirku 'sector.'"
The term concentric describes the "three ways" drawn on the circular astrolabes but they were not 3 concentric spheres (layers) in the sky but rather 3 parallel bands (of stars), with the central band occupying (but not identifying) the equatorial region. Ernst Weidner, and other, in the early 20th-century thought the circular astrolabes indicated 3 concentric spheres for the three paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil.
Examples of star calendars from the late 2nd-millennium BCE are known to us in both circular format and list format. It has been believed that the circular format is the earlier. However, this may not be correct. It appears unlikely that the circular star calendars originated as early as the Old Babylonian Period. More likely, they originated during the latter half of the 2nd-millennium BCE - and certainly no later than the Middle Babylonian Period, possibly originating circa 1150 BCE earliest. For the Babylonian origin, rather than the Assyrian origin of of the "Astrolabes," see the discussion in Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (Pages 158-159). Horowitz concludes the earliest surviving evidence for both the monthstars and the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea dates to the Middle Babylonian Period (1532-1000 BCE) and suggests the first "Astrolabe" was produced at this time.

The Three Stars Each texts purportedly each set out a calendrical system. For each of the 12 months of an unintercalated (i.e., "ideal") year an "astrolabe" lists 3 stars - allegedly one from each of the "three paths." However, it is easily identified that month-stars for each path are not always properly positioned in their allocated path. The Mesopotamians used 3 different calendar year schemes. Likely the earliest was the lunar year scheme comprising 12 lunar cycles. However, 12 lunar cycles comprise 354-355 days. This is 10 less days than the true solar year and required the intercalation of leap months every 3rd year. Using the solar calendar had problems that included the sun is too bright to readily observe excepting at sunrise and sunset. Use of a sidereal calendar (a true astronomical calendar) avoids the shortcomings of both the lunar and solar calendars. It it easy to monitor the movement of the stars at night, and the stars return to their original positions every 365 days. However, solar and sidereal calendars do not provide a direct means for determining the months. A solution with the use of a sidereal calendar is to correlate the sequence of months with a sequence of heliacal risings of selected stars (which of course occur at the same time annually). However, the use of a star calendar to determine the months of the year is not without some awkward issues. To solve the mismatch between the year of 3651⁄4 days and the use of 12 lunar months - the former not dividing equally into the latter - an ideal/schematic calendar of 12 months comprising 30 days each was introduced. The system of intercalating a (leap year) month was introduced to keep the sidereal and lunar calendars synchronised. By the Neo-Assyrian period a more accurate approximation of the sidereal and solar years was known and was stated in Mul.Apin as a year comprising 12 month plus 10 additional days.
It is widely accepted that the Mesopotamian star calendars had the function of identifying "stars" that rose (ideally) each month in the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. Each month was marked by 3 calendar "stars" (one lying in each of the star Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil) with the year being marked by a total of 36 calendar "stars." One star in each of the 3 stellar paths rose during each of the 12 months of the year. Thus the scheme of 36 stars served to fix the 12 months of the yearly calendar astronomically in place. It was initially thought that each of the 36 stars comprised a scheme similar in purpose to the Egyptian scheme of decan stars - each of the 36 stars in the astrolabes marking one-third of an ideal month (of 30 days length). Put another way, the assignment of 3 stars for each month were first interpreted as based upon their order of heliacal risings, being specifically chosen so they rose heliacally at regular intervals of 10 days. The 3 stars assigned to each month in the astrolabe schemes are now interpreted as rising together to mark each month. (The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, 1998): "It is not explicitly stated in the "Astrolabes" which day the month-stars were supposed to rise, but there is indirect evidence that the Ea-star for each month, at least, were meant to rise on the first of the month.") This sufficiently enabled the Mesopotamians to know when the lunar months were shifting out of correlation with the seasons. (There are, however, certain problems with this idea.) The numbering system on the star calendars, that has values assigned to each of the month-stars, relates to a system for calculating the length of day hours and night hours over the ideal 12-month calendar year. (The presence of some planets as month-stars suggests that the star calendars had been intended to predict heliacal risings for a single year.)
A number of surviving fragments of both the circular and tabular types preserve supplementary (and other) information to the listed month-stars. (Especially the tabular "astrolabes" Astrolabe B, BM 82923, and LBAT 1499.) Sm. 162 has similarities to HS 245. The reverse side of Sm. 162 (from CT 33 11) contains text (illustrated in one section by a geometrical figure) that seems to be related to HS 245 (formerly designated HS 229 but more commonly known as the "Hilprecht Text"). HS 245 contains a mathematical problem (most likely a student exercise) utilising a number of stars/constellations. A number of stars and constellations are listed (Moon and Stars, Bull, Arrow, Yoke, Scorpion, and Habasiranu) and their "positions" described in a way that suggests an illustrative mathematical problem.
Johannes Koch in his book Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels (1989) suggests that the circular astrolabe was used as a graphic aide-mémoire. According to Koch the circular astrolabe was not devised as an astronomical device/tool, but rather as an orientation guide and an aid to remembering which stars appeared in which parts of the sky. It was turned counterclockwise, the dividing line on the right side representing the eastern horizon. (The horizon at least, if not the actual sky, was divided into the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil.) The stars of Enlil would rise in the north, the stars of Anu would rise in the centre, and the stars of Ea would rise in the south.
Erica Reiner and David Pingree (Babylonian Planetary Omens, Part Two (1981)) state that the constellation names appearing in the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil assumed Tablets 50-51 closely follow the constellation names (and refer to the same groups of stars) listed in the early star texts - the Astrolabes and the Mul.Apin

series. They identify that the order of the constellation names in Enūma Anu Enlil assumed Tablet 51 is derived from Astrolabe B, and the order of the constellation names in the commentaries on assumed Tablet 50 is also derived from Astrolabe B. The star list in Astrolabe B (VAT 9416 (KAV 218)) dates to circa 1180 BCE but is compiled from older sources.
The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz has, since 1998 (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography), clearly shown the close connection between Tablet V, lines 1-8, of the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Elish (comprised of 7 tablets) and the astrolabes. Both the Enuma Elish and the group of cuneiform astronomical texts commonly known as "the astrolabes" (called by the Babylonians "the stars, three of each") describe the same arrangement for the division of the sky. (The stellar system described in the Enuma Elish Tablet V, lines 1-8, matches the organisation of the sky in the astrolabes.) Tablet V of the Enuma Elish refers to the already existing system of assigning 3 constellations to each month (of the ideal year). The astrolabes comprise the earliest surviving group of cuneiform astronomical texts. The parallels between the Enuma Elish and the astrolabes (1) helps establish the late 2nd millennium BCE date for the composition of Enuma Elish (though some of the material is much older), and (2) demonstrates that the astrolabes are not only astronomicalcalendrical works (presenting an astronomical-calendrical theory), but also have important religious and theological implications.
Astrolabe B (KAV 218) is the earliest and best preserved (it is almost completely preserved) version of an astrolabe. The tablet measures 18.8 cm in height and 11.4 cm in width. The assyriologist Ernst Weidner identified Astrolabe B (= KAV 218 = VAT 9416) as coming from the library of the 12th-century BCE Assyrian King Tilgath-Pileser I. Astrolabe B is a copy made by the scribe Marduk-bālassu-ērĕs. (The colophon does not give a provenance, but the Akkadian of the menology shows Middle Babylonian grammatical forms.) The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz identifies Astrolabe B (dating to circa mid 12thcentury BCE) as being more than simply an astronomical aid for calendar keeping and serving as a sort of theoretical and practical astronomical handbook. Four sections of information are given on Astrolabe B. Wayne Horowitz (In: Calendars and Years, edited by John Steele (2007)) lists these as:
Section 1. A menology for the 12 months of the Babylonian year in which 10 months of the year are assigned month-stars.
Section 2. A star-catalogue listing 12 stars for each of the Paths of Anu, Ea, and Enlil, yielding a repertoire of .36 stars.
Section 3. A list-Astrolabe with its list of 36-month stars (1 star for each path per month) in which the repertoire of stars is slightly different from that given in Section 2.
Section 4. A list of 36 rising and setting stars in which the stars listed in Section 3 (incorrectly including the planet Venus (mul dili.bad) and "The Plough" constellation (mul apin)) rise in their path in their assigned month, and then set 6 months later. (KAV 218, Section D, states that all 36 stars with the two exceptions of the planet Venus (mul dili.bad) and "The Plough" constellation (mul apin), set 6 months after rising.)
The nature and widths of the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea still continues to create some uncertainty. Opinion still differs whether they were conceived as bands in the sky or arcs along the horizon, and whether they marked declinations of 15, 16 or 17 degrees (with the Path of Anu naturally comprising one of these figures x 2). Hunger/Pingree state (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia, Page 61): "It is clear that the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea meant something different to the author of the second edition of "Astrolabe B" and the compiler of the first list in MUL.APIN."
Note: The standard authoritative publication on Babylonian "Astrolabes" is: The Three Stars Each: The Astrolabes and Related Texts by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Archiv für Orientforschung, Beiheft 33). This monumental study is unlikely to be superseded in the foreseeable future.
Appendix 1: The Relationship of Omenology to the Ideal Scheme of Cosmic Order Established by Marduk
The assyriologist David Brown has discussed several times the general rule of celestial divination. Coherence with the ideal scheme of cosmic order established by Marduk (per the description in Enūma Elis, tablet 5 = the astrolabe system) boded well. Non-coherence boded ill.

Appendix 2: Problems Associated With the "Three Stars Each" as Star Calendars
Firstly, after a lengthy discussion of the issues Hunger/Pingree state (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia, Page 63): "The "astrolabe" lists provide no information useful for identifying the constellations because we do not know the principles of their categorizations."
Heliacal risings are also a problematic issue. Reiner/Pingree in Babylonian Planetary Omens, Volume Two (1981, Page 3) discussing two issues to be understood in relation to 'Astrolabe B' state: "... the association of a constellation with a particular ideal month does not signify that that constellation had its heliacal rising in that ideal month, and that the three paths do not correspond to bands located between certain circles parallel to the equator. ... We presume that these associations with ideal months and with the three paths are influenced by mythological as much by astronomical considerations ...."
There are several significant problems associated with interpreting the "three stars each" lists as identifying ideal heliacal risings. (Only KAV 218 (Astrolabe B) specifically states the listed stars are connected with monthly heliacal risings in the three Paths.) Firstly, the associations of the stars with particular months and also the "three paths" seems to be in part purely religious/mythical. Secondly, some of the month-stars listed are actually planets (i.e., Venus, Mars, and Jupiter), with no annual cycles able to be preserved in the "three stars each" calendrical system. (Planets do not rise in the same position of the sky at annual intervals. Therefore they cannot be used as month-stars if the "three stars each" calendrical system is to be used for more than a single year.) Thirdly, two of the stars (in the northern Path of Enlil) are actually circumpolar (the Wagon and the Fox), and it problematic to see how these could have been used in the "three stars each" calendrical system. (Four more circumpolar stars (making a total of 6) were included in the Path of Enlil in the later Mul.Apin series. The 'fixed-star' catalogue of the Mul.Apin series contains 60 rising and setting stars, 6 circumpolar stars, and 5 planets.)
It is possible that "three stars each" texts listing planets as month-stars may not have been intended to predict heliacal risings for longer than a single year. Another possibility is that certain months were identified with the planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter for religious or mythological reasons. ("Names of fixed stars and constellations may have varied and constellations whose names remained constant may have been composed of different stars in different periods. (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz, 1998)"
Summary of Views of Wayne Horowitz and David Brown on Astrolabes and Star Lists: Astrolabes were an Old Babylonian or early Middle Babylonian creation. The Babylonian circular star calendar was divided into 36 individual stellar sectors (with one sector for each of the 36 stars) comprising 3 concentric bands (rings) (marking the borders between the 3 stellar paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil) each divided by 12 radial lines (demarking the 12 months of the year). The astrolabe genre was a scheme in which 3 stars, 1 lying in each star path, were meant ideally to rise heliacally, in each of the 12 months of the 'ideal year.' (No days, only months are noted in the astrolabes.) Astrolabes were not a sidereal calendar, though a residue of certain traditional seasonal-stellar associations may have filtered in to them. It may be that star lists – including Mul.Apin – were never intended accurately to reflect reality. There may have been (overriding) divinatory reasons. There was precedence of divinatory thinking over astronomical reality. Even lists of simultaneously rising and setting stars likely include ideal propositions. Star data were produced 'artificially' only corresponding very broadly to reality. The best preserved text of Astrolabe B is Schroeder KAV 218 from Assur and dated to circa 1100 BCE. Its relationship to EAE omen series is very close. It shares the same ideal year attested in EAE 14, and omens in EAE 51. Horowitz has provided reasons to believe the content of the Pinches-type astrolabes and the Hilprecht text HS 245 derives from a common Old Babylonian tradition that leads ultimately to the compendium we know as Astrolabe B.
Appendix 3: Three Key "Astrolabes"
The term 'astrolabe' was introduced by Theophilus Pinches in 1900. Three key astrolabes are Astrolabe P, Astrolabe B, and Astrolabe Z. The other texts of interest are those dealing with the Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru.
Astrolabe P (for Pinches) is not a specific physical astrolabe (cuneiform tablet/text) but a modern composite reconstruction (compilation) by the British assyriologist Theophilus Pinches from other astrolabe (and star list) fragments in the British Museum. In 1900 Pinches combined information from 4 tablets (comprising

circular and tabular astrolabes) and additionally 2 star lists to form the composites called 'Pinches Astrolabe.' It was studied by the German assyriologist Albert Schott (1901-1942/45). The construction by Pinches was in a tabular (list) format. This tabular format was able to be used by Schott to reconstruct a circular astrolabe with the stars arranged in 3 concentric rings.. Schott realised, correctly, that systematic scribal error with some entries indicated copying from a preceding circular format. Schott published his reconstruction of a circular astrolabe (the earliest astrolabe format) in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, Band 88, 1934, Pages 302-337.
Astrolabe B (KAV 218) (tabular format) was studied and autographs published by the German assyriologist Otto Schroeder (1851-1937), in a monograph titled Keilschrifttexte aus Assur verschiedenen Inhalts: Autographiert, mit Inhaltsübersicht und Namenlisten, I. Heft (Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft, 35, 1920). Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen der Deutschen OrientGesellschaft (WVDOG) is a series publication of the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft. Astrolabe B is a clay tablet from Assur and dated to the Middle Assyrian period (circa 1400-1000 BCE). The text language is Akkadian. The Assur-version of Astrolabe B is the best preserved source for this genre. A partial (poorly preserved and fragmented) copy from Babylon (dated to Middle Babylonian period, circa 1532-1000 BCE) is in the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin (VAT 17081). Another copy of Astrolabe B (also poorly preserved) is the star list HS 1897 from Nippur.
Astrolabe Z (tabular format) in Brussels was studied and published by the German assyriologist Heinrich Zimmern (1862-1931), in Zeitschrift für Assyriologie, Band 32, 1918/1919.
The unifying principle behind all the of "Three Stars Each"/Astrolabe class of cuneiform texts is a star heliacally rising in each of the "three ways" during each of the 12 months of the unintercalated 'ideal' year, and that a total of 36 stars astronomically fixed the months of the yearly calendar (i.e., fixed the months astronomically in place). The format for presenting the lists of 36 month-stars was not standardised. The 36 month-star lists could appear in either circular or list format. In the tabular (list) "Astrolabes" (such as "Astrolabe B"), the texts are divided into 12 paragraphs, 3 lines each. Each line contains the name of a star, constellation or planet, the explanation of this name and a number. Each paragraph deals with one Babylonian month and each line with a specific Path of the sky (Path of Ea, Anu, or Enlil). Supposedly, the selected stars, constellations, and planets rose heliacally in exactly that month in that Path of the sky. The Path of Ea (south of -17 degrees declination; first line of each paragraph). The Path of Anu (between +17 degrees declination and -17 degrees declination; second line of each paragraph). The Path of Enlil (north of +17 degrees declination; last line of each paragraph).
(1) The Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru
There are two cuneiform texts containing lists of 12 stars of Elam, 12 stars of Akkad, and 12 stars of Amurru. (The Babylonian tablets are K 250 and K 8067. Both were published in Cuneiform Texts in the British Museum, Volume 26, See Plates 40-41 and 44.) The names Elam, Akkad, and Amurru reflect the political situation in Old Babylonian times. This enables the assumption that the lists are old and come from the Old Babylonian Period. (However, the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz cautions the lists of Elam-, Akkad-, and Amurru- stars may not be as old as the Old Babylonian period as suggested by Bartel van der Waerden.) The stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru are identical with the stars of Astrolabe B and in each text their order corresponds exactly with the order of the twelve months in Astrolabe B. This verifies that the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru are month stars, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Bartel van Waerden (Science Awakening II, Page 68) commented: "There is no astronomical principle to be found in the distribution of the stars over the three countries."
(2) Astrolabe Berlin (Astrolabe B)
Astrolabe Berlin (Astrolabe B) was discovered by the young German assyriologist Ernst Weidner amongst the cuneiform tablets collected by the Berlin Museum. Weidner identified Astrolabe B as belonging to the library of king Tilgath-Pileser I. Astrolabe B (= VAT 9416, KAV 218) is a rectangular (list) Astrolabe and is a bilingual Sumerian/Akkadian text. The text of Astrolabe B was copied in Asshur in the late 2nd-millenium BCE and is the oldest of the Astrolabes known. (It is thought the tablet was likely copied in the reign of King Ninurta-apil-Ekur (1190-1178 BCE).) Astrolabe B, in contrast to the other Astrolabes known, states



2022. 02. 21. 19:44 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20210420083503/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-7.html 12/37
explicitly that the stars named rise in their month. According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz it appears the content of Astrolabe B is a compendium compiled from independent sources of information.
Part A (Section 1) of Astrolabe B associates each of the twelve months with a constellation, a god, mythological events (rites and rituals), and agricultural activities associated with the particular months. The 'mythological notes' in Part A comprise a bilingual menology for the 12 months of the Babylonian year. For each monthly section the Sumerian-language description is given first and this is followed by the Akkadianlanguage description. In 10 of the 12 months the first item noted in the Sumerian-language version of the menology is the month-star for that month.
Part B (Section 2) of Astrolabe B is a list (star-catalogue) of 36 stars - comprised of 12 stars for each of the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. Part B usually notes the position of each star by referring to their locations relative to each other, and occasionally refers to the colour of the star, or to particular parts of the constellation. The division into Stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil (zones approximately parallel to the celestial equator) has scientific characteristics.
Part C (Section 3) of Astrolabe B (lines 1-12) systematically lists three constellations in each of the three Paths, for each month (= 36 stars), according to the sequence of their presumed helical rising. The star list is slightly different to that of Part B (Section 2).
Part D (Section 4) (lines 13-36) states that the 3 constellations of each month rise in that month, and that three other constellations set (i.e., the constellations in the 7th month from it set in that same month). Part D (Section 4) of Astrolabe B also states that those constellations which it states set are specifically those constellations which rise six months later. This schematic 6 month difference is not astronomically possible. Also, the astronomical theory that non-circumpolar stars rise and set at half-year intervals is false. (Actually it is noted that 34 of the 36 stars set exactly 6 months after rising. Part D, states that all 36 stars with the two exceptions of the planet Venus (mul dili.bad) and "The Plough" constellation (mul apin), set 6 months after rising.)
The information in Parts A, B, C and D are unique to Astrolabe B. The information does not occur together in any of the other Astrolabes.
In Astrolabe B, Marduk's star is described as being in the central/middle path of Anu, between the old and new year; i.e., marking the passage between the old and new year. (On the Astrolabe tablet Marduk's star is written without marking stars in the outer path of Ea and the inner path of Enlil. The outer path of Ea is left blank and also the inner path of Enlil is left blank.)
(3) Astrolabe Pinches (Astrolabe P)
Astrolabe Pinches ("Pinches' Astrolabe" or Astrolabe P) is not a cuneiform text, but a modern composite reconstruction (compilation) made by the pioneering British assyriologist Theophilus Pinches from four different texts in the British Museum and published in 1900. Two of the star lists that were used by Pinches remain unknown. However, it is known that Pinches' transcription of the sources he used is accurate (and can be treated as if it were a cuneiform text). Also, it is known that BM 34713 (LBAT 1499 (= LBAT 1500)) was a major source for Pinches in constructing his composite Astrolabe. At least one text used was the circular Astrolabe fragment Sm 162. (Hunger/Pingree in Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999) identify the tablets Sm 162, K 14943 + 81-7-27, 94, and 83-1-18, 608, as well as 2 additional star lists.) Astrolabe P remains important.
Astrolabe P does not always identify stars that rise in each of the months. Four of the month-star are actually planets, and 2 (Wagon and Fox) are circumpolar and so they never rise or set.
Appendix 4: Rumen Kolev's Claim for Dating the Astrolabes to 5500 BCE
Rumen Kolev (1960- ) (Bulgaria) Astrologer and astrology software developer, mathematician, and amateur astronomer. Born in Varna (Bulgaria) in 1960; became a naturalised American citizen in 1995. (States he has a BA in Economics (1992); and MD (Doctor of Medicine) (2000) from the Medical Academy of Bulgaria. (Apparently (2007) PhD student at Rousse University, Bulgaria (Department of Computer Systems and Technologies?).) (John Halloran's website has: "He holds a B.A. in Economics and the equivalent in

Mathematics from the University of Washington in Seattle, USA. He has spent one year in the Ph.D. program in Economics at UCLA where he studied mathematical models for predictions in Macro Economics and chaos theory. He holds also a MD degree from the Bulgarian Medical Academy in Varna.") Self-declared expert on Babylonian astronomy and astrology. Trenchant critic of most professional assyriologists (both pioneering and modern). Avid supporter of the discredited Panbabylonism of Alfred Jeremias and Ernst Weidner. (Believes Alfred Jeremias was a pioneering assyriologist!) Kolev, who lacks any training or reputation as an assyriologist, chooses to reject modern assyriology (especially the scholarship of outstanding professional scholars such as Neugebauer, Sachs, Pingree, and Hunger) as some sort of conspiratorial fraud to hid their own, and also Franz Kugler's errors, and seeks to frame issues and discussion within the framework of Panbabylonian tenets propagated by Jeremias and Weidner during the period circa 1900 to 1925. Historic issues long over and irrelevant to modern assyriology are regarded as still currently valid. Kolev's Babylonian Astrosophy (Astrosophy meaning literally 'Star Wisdom') is indicated by his statements as involving belief in some form of mystical and causative Babylonian astrology. (His beliefs are set out in his book The Restoration of the Astral Teachings of the Golden Age (2010, 370 Pages).) It perhaps is taken from the use of the term 'Astrosophie' by Alfred Jeremias. Kolev has developed 2 astrological software programs 'Placidus,' and ' Porphyrius Magus;' and ostensibly 1 astronomy software program 'Babylonia.' Currently (2009) promotes his radical and eccentric ideas through his own journal. (Where he establishes matters to his own satisfaction only.) He rejects the conclusions of modern scholarship (the conclusions of almost all scholars in Assyriology since the end of WWII) as incompetence. He has succinctly stated his own radical chronological framework: "The first coordinate system going back to 5,500 BC [± 300 years] was an equatorial system consisting of 3 circles-paths each divided in 12 sections." (It needs to be noted that Kolev has also claimed it was an ecliptic system. The Mesopotamians did not have a concept of either the celestial equator or ecliptic.) He believes he has correctly dated all (or most of) the Babylonian 'astrolabes' to the middle of the 6th-millennium BCE. His work on heliacal risings and atmospheric extinction has the support of a number of professional and amateur astronomers. However, he is unreliable on issues regarding the history of Babylonian astral sciences.
In essence, with such claims as an ecliptic system established in Mesopotamia circa 5,500 BCE, Kolev is seeking to establish the view that Mesopotamian astrology (not simply a system of astral omens) developed much earlier than the results of modern scholarship establish. At the MELAMMU VI Symposium 2008, Kolev claimed that not only were the path-positions of the starts in Astrolabe B originating in 5,500 BCE, but the complete Astrolabe! Because of his prior assumptions about dates proposed by the Panbabylonist Alfred Jeremias, a caveat on his finding would be in order. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz, an expert on Mesopotamian "astrolabes," states (1998, Page 157): "Although Astrolabe B (KAV 218), the earliest known example of the "Astrolabes," is found on a Middle Assyrian tablet, it is probable that the first "Astrolabe" was composed no later than the Middle Assyrian Period and perhaps as early as the Old Babylonian Period." (See the detailed discussion: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Pages 157-161.) Within his discussion Horowitz makes the point that the earliest surviving evidence for month-stars and for the division of the sky into 3 paths belonging to Anu, Enlil, and Ea is found in the Middle Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night from Boghqazkoi (KUB 4 47) dated to the 13th-century BCE, and the Middle Assyrian star-catalogue from Nippur (HS 1897). A Middle Babylonian or older origin for the first Astrolabe is indicated by evidence provided by the Babylonian fragment VAS 24 120 and KAV 218. The tablet containing "Astrolabe B," VAT 9416 (KAV 218) dates to the 12th-century BCE.
The core of Kolev's technique is simply to look for the common period when all the stars (or at least maximum numbers) are in their deemed path/way. He seems unable to appreciate that within the nature of the normal Mesopotamian scheme there was (normally) an inexact match between the months and the heliacal risings of their associated constellations. (Also, only a few astrolabe texts - but including the complete Astrolabe B - are used in this way by Kolev.)
Kolev also has a mystical belief at the core of his approach and beliefs. On October 31, 2010 at ACTastrology.com he posted: "Ultimately, the pre-diluvial Hermes should be no-one, but En Meduranki- the true prophet of God given the true knowledge of Astrology in a Revelation somewhere around 5,500 BC or earlier. More on this will be in my own research on the Babylonian Astrolabe soon to be published in the 'Proceedings of the Melammu VI symposium' [expected in the end of 2010 or early 2011 ....The main topic is the dating of the Babylonian Astrolabe, but one of the consequences of the research is exactly the conclusion: Hermes Trismegistus = En Meduranki. This should be the initial point for the next stage of the research to reconstruct the original teachings of EnMeduranki {since now we have a thread we can follow

straight to the begin of mythological time}." Earlier, January 10, 2009, at ACTastrology.com, Kolev posted: "I started from both ends: from the Renaissance moving back in time and at the same time from the Babylonian moving forward in time, reading in Latin and Akkadian. Since couple of years I was lucky to close in on the center- the Greek-language Astrology. Doing the research on the original texts was an Enlightment ! The whole process of the Astrology stood before my eyes. I saw the bright Light of Enmeduranki- the pre-deluvial proto-Sumerian king (from around 5500 BC according to my research) moving through the latest 7500 years of Time. Enmeduranki- the pen-ultimate king-prophet before the Deluge from Old Sipar (sic) received his knowledge directly from the conference of the 'Gods' being lifted there by the Sun-god (Utu) and the god of the Wind (Adad). What I saw was a clear picture of a brilliant Light getting dimmer and dimmer as it approached my own time. [[[ Read my Post in HELLENISTIC ASTROLOGY titled 'HELIACAL APPEARANCES (Phaseis):GREECE/BABYLON' for a very concrete and detailed example of this process that I would call 'Corruption and Profanation of the AstrologyRevelation ' ]]] The Babylonians gave hints here and there, but they kept the secret tradition from the uninitiated with an immense instrumentarium of code-words. They rarely put explanations on their 'paper' of clay tablets. The Greeks though were more fond of talking. I found in their writings many traces of the original Revelation handed to Enmeduranki- the prophet of Astrology." Kolev has written elsewhere his belief that the tenets of Babylonian astrology was received by Enmeduranki all at once in an "Illumination."
Kolev's claims have already been uncritically picked up (in a distortive context) and - along with mention of Gavin White's speculative ideas of an early Mesopotamian constellation set - included in The Dawning (2011) by the Australian astrologer Terry MacKinnell (who appears quite uninformed of the critical issues).
Some initial issues: The key is whether the astrolabe texts (and the Mul.Apin series served a calendrical purpose (a system of month-stars established within the scheme of an ideal year) or a divinatory purpose (and was only loosely connected with observational reality). It is difficult to understand why this supposed early system of 36 month-stars did not diffuse to either Elam or Ebla at least. Also, Wayne Horowitz is cited for the claim by Kolev that the celestial system of three 'paths' are mentioned in the Old Babylonian Period. The claim is false. Wayne Horowitz specifically states no Old Babylonian material preserves evidence for either month-stars or the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. (See: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (1998, Page 158).) Further, the Ur III period (2112-2004 BCE) (not to be confused with the earlier Uruk III period reaching up to circa 3000 BCE) is generally considered the best documented century in antiquity. It is also termed the Neo Sumerian period or the "Sumerian Renaissance." Note: The term "Sumerian Renaissance" is now discredited. Suggested as more apt is "Ur III florescence." The tens of thousands of cuneiform tablets that have survived document an immense range of activities. This has resulted in nearly 100 years of intense scholarly work on the Ur III period. Within the context of the active intellectual endeavour recorded at this period no astronomy emerges. There is no compelling reason for assuming that the astronomical texts from the 2nd-millennium BCE relied upon astronomical texts from the 3rd-millennium BCE. There is no formal astronomy in Sumerian texts. Sumerian literary texts, however, contain astronomical references. The Sumerian term UDDU-IDEM (Akkadian bibbu) = wild sheep = stars/planets. In the religious text NannaSuen Hymn 1, the mention of cows is an allusion to the stars in the night sky. In the religious text, The Exaltation of Istar, the sun and moon are herdmen keeping the stars (as cattle) in their order.
Trying to understand Rumen Kolev's own explanations for how he reached the date of 5,500 BC [± 300 years] for some of the information on 1 or more of the 'astrolabes' (?) - or this date for all of the information on all of the 'astrolabes' (?) - has proved confusing (and continues to be so). (It appears Kolev expects people to buy his book in order to gain a detailed explanation.) Kolev claims that circa 5,500 BCE is the date when the Path positions of the 36 month-stars in the Astrolabes are correct. It seems he has primarily used the month-star list information in Astrolabe B and used one of his computer programs to precess backwards in time until a 'best match' was achieved between them and the "three ways" (for heliacal rising only (?)). How the set times are dealt with is unknown (i.e., not yet (March, 2010) explained by Kolev). Also, how the planets and circumpolar constellations are dealt with is unknown (i.e., not yet (March, 2010) explained by Kolev). This selective use of data is only one problem associated with Kolev's early dating claims for the 'astrolabes.' A binomial analysis is used for the data. His 2008 presentation "Astronomical Dating of the Babylonian Astrolabe." remains unpublished to date (but is currently being printed, June, 2011). The Proceedings of the Melammu VI Symposium 2008 (containing his presentation) is being printed (June, 2011). (The symposium was organised by the assyriologist Simo Parpola, who is sympathetic of the Panbabylonism of Winckler and Jeremias.) To presently access his claims in detail (March, 2010) Kolev imposes a requirement to purchase his publications. Even though his ideas (1) have not yet been clearly

communicated, (2) have not been communicated in any detail, (3) have not been able to be suitably assessed, and (4) have not been acknowledged as accepted by any professional assyriologist; Kolev is confidently treating his claim for the early dating of the Astrolabe star lists as being established.
The unifying principle behind all the of "Three Stars Each"/Astrolabe class of cuneiform texts is a star heliacally rising in each of the "three ways" during each of the 12 months of the unintercalated 'ideal' year, and that a total of 36 stars astronomically fixed the months of the yearly calendar (i.e., fixed the months astronomically in place). The format for presenting the lists of 36 month-stars was not standardised. The 36 month-star lists could appear in either circular or list format. In the tabular (list) "Astrolabes" (such as "Astrolabe B"), the texts are divided into 12 paragraphs, 3 lines each. Each line contains the name of a star, constellation or planet, the explanation of this name and a number. Each paragraph deals with one Babylonian month and each line with a specific Path of the sky (Path of Ea, Anu, or Enlil). Supposedly, the selected stars, constellations, and planets rose heliacally in exactly that month in that Path of the sky. The Path of Ea (south of -17 degrees declination; first line of each paragraph). The Path of Anu (between +17 degrees declination and -17 degrees declination; second line of each paragraph). The Path of Enlil (north of +17 degrees declination; last line of each paragraph). However, Jeffrey Cooley, relying on BPO 3, Pages 1516, writes (2013, Page 63): "... it seems as though the Path of Enlil began about 13 degrees north of east, Ea extended south beginning at about 11 degrees south of east, and Anu would have been the area between these two points."
"Since the various astrolabes do not all agree about which stars belong to a particular Path, it seems that the precise limits of each Path probably varied according to the particular celestial observer and the circumstances of his locality ... that is, which landmarks the individual would choose to define the limits of each Path." (See a suitable summary discussion in: Poetic Astronomy in the Ancient Near East by Jeffrey Cooley (2013, Page 63, Note 4). See also: BPO 2, Page 17; and BPO 3, Pages 15-16.) Also, the fact that often the stars/constellations do not actually reside in their named star-paths - the paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil, suggests that the star-paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil were introduced later than the stars/constellations assigned to them.
Geoffrey Elton (1921-1994) (The Practice of History, 1967) counselled: "Those determined to put their faith in 'sophisticated' mathematical methods and to apply 'general laws' to the pitifully meagre and very uncertain detail that historical evidence often provides for the answering of interesting and important questions, are either to be pitied because they will be sinking in quicksand while believing themselves to be standing on solid earth, or to be combated because they darken counsel with their errors." It will be interesting if the constellation anunitu (formed by part of the stars comprising our Pisces), one of the rising stars of Astrolabe B (and in the Path of Enlil), is included and used. No Sumerian word is used for this constellation, the name appears in Akkadian only. (Another example of the absence of a Sumerian word as a name is the star/constellation tultu "the Worm," in the Path of Ea. Though this is likely to be a late additional/alternative name for an existing constellation.) The Mesopotamian month-star lists comprising 36 stars, and the system of the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil, are connected not only with the "Astrolabe" texts (they originate as the month-stars) but also with the Creation Epic (Enūma Elish), and the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil. Any attempt to date the contents of these documents to circa 5,500 BCE can be dismissed. Both the month-star lists and the texts were being developed at the same period. They date to the time of Assyrian independence and expansion, starting circa 1350 BCE. In this sense all are Assyrian Period documents and there is an interconnectedness between them. (For the Babylonian origin, rather than the Assyrian origin of the "Astrolabes," see the discussion in Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (Pages 158-159). Horowitz concludes the earliest surviving evidence for both the month-stars and the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea dates to the Middle Babylonian Period (1532-1000 BCE) and suggests the first "Astrolabe" was produced at this time.) Also, according to the investigations of Wayne Horowitz, the 10-star tradition (AO 6769) and the 30-star catalogue/list (BM 55502) were a development that preceded the 3 x 12 = 36 month-star lists. Kolev's ideas of the system of 36 month-stars, allocated into 3 defined Paths, dating to circa 5,500 BCE needs to take all of this into account.
Aspects of early lunar and planetary astronomy are embedded in the Enūma Anu Enlil omen series, the content and finalisation of which is clearly dated to the late 2nd-millennium BCE. Astrolabe B is closely related to tablet 51 of the Enūma Anu Enlil omen series. (The ideal Astrolabe is reflected in the Enūma Anu Enlil tablets 50-51.) If the star-list content of the "Astrolabe texts" (which also appear in the Enūma Anu Enlil omen series) are to be dated to circa 5500 BCE then it is odd that astronomical development then

remained static for another 4000 years. Also, the earliest Mesopotamian list of relations between months and gods/goddesses seems to be Astrolabe B. Dūzu, the 4th month of the Babylonian calendar, was named after the god Dumuzi ("Dumuzi of Uruk"). The text of Astrolabe B reflects this Old Babylonian tradition (mythology surrounding Dumuzi) referring to the month Dūzu as "the month in which the shepherd Dumuzi, was captured."
The evidence is against the use - in the late 2nd-millennium BCE - of an 'inherited' use system of 36 monthstars (from 5500 BCE) that was not further developed for some 4000 years. (For an expert discussion by a professional assyriologist regarding the date of composition of Astrolabe B see The Three Stars Each by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Pages 30-33. He identifies the astrolabe genre as late 2nd-millennium texts including astronomical content.) Circa 1400 BCE we had the development/composition of a list of 30 heliacally rising stars, 10 each in the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. (10 = completeness.) It appears these were the original lists from which both the Astrolabes and the Mul.Apin lists were derived. The Kassite period (Middle Babylonian period) texts VS 24 120 (from Babylon) and HS 1897 (from Nippur) (and BM 55502) provide antecedents to Sections 1 and 2 respectively of Astrolabe B. The 2 Middle Babylonian period 10 star catalogues HS 1897 and (the somewhat later text) BM 55502 parallel the star-catalogue of Astrolabe B (KA5 218). The evidence clearly shows the precedence, durability and influence of the 10-star tradition. The roughly contemporary text KUB 4 47 Prayer to the Gods of the Night, from Boghazköy, provides the earliest direct evidence for the division of the night sky into the three Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. (Not used, however, is the term harranu (= paths).)
The Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. There are two cuneiform texts containing lists of 12 stars of Elam, 12 stars of Akkad, and 12 stars of Amurru. (Both were published in Cuneiform Texts in the British Museum, Volume 26, See Plates 40-41 and 44.) The names Elam, Akkad, and Amurru reflect the political situation in Old Babylonian times. The stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru are identical with the stars of Astrolabe B and in each text their order corresponds exactly with the order of the twelve months in Astrolabe B. This verifies that the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru are month stars, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Bartel van der Waerden (Science Awakening II, Page 68) commented: "There is no astronomical principle to be found in the distribution of the stars over the three countries." This is because the system comprises a regional division rather than an astronomical one.
Astrolabe Berlin (Astrolabe B) was discovered by the young German assyriologist Ernst Weidner amongst the cuneiform tablets collected by the Berlin Museum. Weidner identified Astrolabe B as belonging to the library of king Tilgath-Pileser I. Astrolabe B (= VAT 9416, KAV 218) is a rectangular (list) Astrolabe and is a bilingual Sumerian/Akkadian text. The text of Astrolabe B was copied in Asshur/Ashur in the late 2ndmillennium BCE and is the oldest of the Astrolabes known. (It is thought the tablet was likely copied in the reign of King Ninurta-apil-Ekur (1190-1178 BCE).) Astrolabe B, in contrast to the other Astrolabes known, states explicitly that the stars named rise in their month. According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz it appears the content of Astrolabe B is a compendium compiled from independent sources of information. Astrolabe B is an assemblage of various data originating from as yet unidentified sources, different in both their origin and purpose. Regardless, the text in Astrolabe B describing the risings and settings of stars clearly indicates its schematised design. (See for example the discussion by Johann Schaumberger, Ergan. 3, (1935).) Also, what is definitely not demonstrated is the standardised use of Astrolabe "path stars" from supposedly the 6th-millennium to the 2nd-millennium. It is not demonstrated that there was a standard list of Astrolabe stars. Wayne Horowitz makes the point that there is no such thing as an authoritative, standard Mesopotamian star list.
Astrolabe B (VAT 9416, published as KAV 218) is an almost completely preserved tablet measuring 18.8 centimetres in height and 11.4 centimetres in width. Part A (Section 1) of Astrolabe B associates each of the twelve months with a constellation, a god, mythological events (rites and rituals), and agricultural activities associated with the particular months. The 'mythological notes' in Part A (Section 1) comprise a bilingual menology for the 12 months of the Babylonian year. (Menologies prescribe by month and day what actions are advisable or not. They are related to divinatory texts.) For each monthly section the Sumerian-language description is given first and this is followed by the Akkadian-language description. In 10 of the 12 months the first item noted in the Sumerian-language version of the menology is the month-star for that month. Part B (Section 2) of Astrolabe B is a list (star-catalogue) of 36 stars - comprised of 12 stars for each of the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. Part B usually notes the position of each star by referring to their locations relative to each other, and occasionally refers to the colour of the star, or to particular parts of the constellation. The

division into Stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil (zones approximately parallel to the celestial equator) has scientific characteristics. Part C (Section 3) of Astrolabe B (lines 1-12) comprises a list-Astrolabe that systematically lists three constellations in each of the three Paths, for each month (= 36 stars), according to the sequence of their presumed helical rising. The star list is slightly different to that of Part B (Section 2). Part D (Section 4) (lines 13-36) states that the 3 constellations of each month rise in that month, and that three other constellations set (i.e., the constellations in the 7th month from it set in that same month). Part D (Section 4) of Astrolabe B also states that those constellations which it states set are specifically those constellations which rise six months later (= a list of 'stars that rise as others set.' This schematic 6 month difference is not astronomically possible. Also, the astronomical theory that non-circumpolar stars rise and set at half-year intervals is false. (Actually it is noted that 34 of the 36 stars set exactly 6 months after rising. Part D, states that all 36 stars with the two exceptions of the planet Venus (mul dili.bad) and "The Plough" constellation (mul apin), set 6 months after rising.) The information in Parts A, B, C and D are unique to Astrolabe B. The information does not occur together in any of the other Astrolabes.
Horowitz, Wayne ("The Astrolabes: An Exercise in Transmission, Canonicity, and Para-Canonicity." In: Banks, Michaela et al. (Editors). (2013). Between Text and Text: The Hermeneutics of Intertextuality in Ancient Cultures and Their Afterlife in Medieval and Modern Times. (Pages 273-287)) writes: "[T]he individual elements of Astrolabe B (Sections I, II, III, and IV) each on their own, and sometimes in other combinations, find numerous parallels and duplicates, both before the twelfth century date of Astrolabe B, and later throughout the first millennium. For example Astrolabe B II is also known in a 30 star format, 10 stars for each path rather than 12, in two parallels that are separated in time by about a millennium, each in a different setting than in Astrolabe B. The earlier one is the Middle Babylonian Nippur tablet HS 1897, which is slightly older than Astrolabe B and is dedicated in full to the 30 star-catalogue. This would appear to be a precursor, in Assyriological jargon a "forerunner," to the 36 star-catalogue of Alb B Section II. Later is the Hellenistic period Astrolabe compendium, BM 55502, which gives the list of the 36 rising and setting stars best known from Alb B IV, but also a 30 star-catalogue that nearly duplicates that of HS 1897, and so differs from the star-catalogue Alb B Section II which gives 12 stars per path. This comes as somewhat of a surprise since one might expect the 36 star-version known from Astrolabe B II from ca. 1160 to have entered the canon and have been repeated in the first millennium, rather than the earlier 30 star-version found on HS 1897."
Tom Peters (Hastro-L, 12 November, 2009), struggling with a lack of clear explanation writes a succinct critique: "I gather that Mr. Kolev derives an age for the data of this list by playing around with precession until he gets a best match for actual rising and setting of these stars in some distant past. If this is correct, then this approach is problematic.
- You always get a best match, however poor it actually is.
- The result is completely dependent on your interpretation of the meaning of the data.
As has already been brought forward, how reliable are the identifications of the objects in the list with actual stars? And how sure can we be that it is actually the kind of list that we think it is? Also, any systematic deviation will lead to a (large) error in dating this way - for instance, for what latitude was it made?"
Problems associated with the "three stars each" as star calendars are apparently not dealt with by Rumen Kolev. Firstly, after a lengthy discussion of the issues Hunger/Pingree state (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia, Page 63): "The "astrolabe" lists provide no information useful for identifying the constellations because we do not know the principles of their categorizations."
There are several significant problems associated with interpreting the "three stars each" lists as identifying ideal heliacal risings. (Only KAV 218 (Astrolabe B) specifically states the listed stars are connected with monthly heliacal risings in the three Paths.) Firstly, the associations of the stars with particular months and also the "three paths" seems to be in part purely religious/mythical. Secondly, some of the month-stars listed are actually planets (i.e., Venus, Mars, and Jupiter), with no annual cycles able to be preserved in the "three stars each" calendrical system. (Planets do not rise in the same position of the sky at annual intervals. Therefore they cannot be used as month-stars if the "three stars each" calendrical system is to be used for more than a single year.) Thirdly, two of the stars (in the northern Path of Enlil) are actually circumpolar (the Wagon and the Fox), and it problematic to see how these could have been used in the "three stars each"



2022. 02. 21. 19:44 History of Constellation and Star Names

calendrical system. (Four more circumpolar stars (making a total of 6) were included in the Path of Enlil in the later Mul.Apin series. The 'fixed-star' catalogue of the Mul.Apin series contains 60 rising and setting stars, 6 circumpolar stars, and 5 planets.)
Heliacal risings are also a problematic issue. Reiner/Pingree in Babylonian Planetary Omens, Volume Two (1981, Page 3) discussing two issues to be understood in relation to 'Astrolabe B' state: "... the association of a constellation with a particular ideal month does not signify that that constellation had its heliacal rising in that ideal month, and that the three paths do not correspond to bands located between certain circles parallel to the equator. ... We presume that these associations with ideal months and with the three paths are influenced by mythological as much by astronomical considerations ...."
Regarding Habasirānu in the Path of Ea. There remains some uncertainty about how to transcribe the Sumerian name (logogram) of this star/constellation, as well as its exact identity. Various transcriptions such as Hasirānu / Habasirāttu are used. Thought by early assyriologists to be a star name but, perhaps correctly, by contemporary assyriologists to be a constellation (figure of a mouse (mouse-like creature) or rodent (?)) occupying most of the stars of Centaurus. (The name infers a mouse or rodent.) In Astrolabe B, Section C, Habasirānu is replaced by nu.muš.da ('Swarm') (and the Hyades - also in the Path of Ea - are replaced by gula (gula) (Aquarius)). The identification of nu.muš.da is uncertain, and also whether it is a name for a constellation or single star (but Hunger/Pingree (1999) identify the star η or κ Centauri).
Taken as "astronomical" texts it is possible that "three stars each" texts listing planets as month-stars may not have been intended to predict heliacal risings for longer than a single year. Another possibility is that certain months were identified with the planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter for religious or mythological reasons. ("Names of fixed stars and constellations may have varied and constellations whose names remained constant may have been composed of different stars in different periods. (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz, 1998.))"
Basic questions are: how astronomical were the astrolabes? What genre of literature are they connected with? Their purpose was not to regulate the calendar. It is certain that astrolabes were not intercalation devices. The Babylonian national epic Enuma Elish is the earliest written creation myth. It sets out that the chief god of the Babylonians (also the most powerful of the Babylonian gods), Marduk, created an ordered world out of the original state of chaos. He then created time by establishing/devising the first calendar. He establishes the year, divides the length into 12-months, and assigns three stars to each month. (3 stars – 1 in each star path were meant to rise heliacally in each of the 12 months of the 'ideal year.') Simply, Marduk arranges the stars in the image of the astrolabes. The ideal year set out in the astrolabes matches the ideal year established by Marduk (360 days, comprising 12 months of 30 days each). The ‘ideal astrolabe’ was underpinned by the ‘ideal year’ created by the god Marduk. This artificial construction meant they did not fulfil the role of a sidereal calendar. David Brown makes the point: "They were based only very loosely on observational reality." The 'stars' listed were never intended to accurately reflect reality (i.e., what could be actually observed). Divinatory thinking/tradition was given precedence over strict astronomical reality. The order of the 'astrolabe constellations' and the dates of their ideal first appearances are also listed in Enūma Anu Enlil tablet 51, and in the commentaries on Enūma Anu Enlil tablet 50. Thus the genres are associated. In tablet 51 of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil the astrolabe stars are used to predict good or evil. Thus the astrolabe star lists had magical/divinatory purposes.
Essentially the "astrolabe" texts comprised a scheme in which 3 stars, one lying in each of the 3 star-paths, were meant/(supposed?) to rise heliacally in each of the 12 30-day months of the of the "ideal year." (The dates - per Astrolabe B - reflect their ideal first appearances. However, no days, only months, are noted on the Astrolabe texts.) The "ideal astrolabe" was thus underpinned by the "ideal year." It is likely that the "Astrolabe texts" as well as the Mul.Apin series, comprise an invented scheme and not an observation-based scheme. The assyriologist David Brown thinks it highly unlikely that the "astrolabe texts" served the astronomical purpose of enabling a calendar and marking seasonal events. He instead states (Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology (2000, Page 115)): "They were, instead, learned elaborations based only very loosely on observational reality with regard to the heavens, whose purpose was not to regulate the calendar, but to permit celestial diviners to interpret the occasion of a star's first appearance as good-boding if it corresponded with the scheme and ill-boding if it did not."

Kolev has also stated he has extended his "precess method" to the Mul.Apin series. The Mul.Apin series is usually considered to be "astronomical" (an "astronomical compendium") with the primary aim of regulating the luni-solar year. However, many of the stars/constellations listed appear to be out of order. David Brown (Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology (2000, Page 116)) suggests this "may be because the star lists were never intended accurately to reflect reality." The star-lists reflect divinatory purposes. Tradition and divinatory purpose often determines content rather than a strict observance to observed fact. The dates given in Mul.Apin for heliacal risings of stars - though ultimately observation-based - were produced artificially. Both the "Astrolabe texts" and the Mul.Apin series are ultimately ideal schemes that do not accurately correspond to reality but serve the purpose of being useful for divinatory purposes.
The nature and widths of the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea still continues to create some uncertainty. (David Brown has proposed that the system of "Three Ways" was awkwardly imposed on an already established (earlier) system of 36 stars. This has clear implications for assumptions of an astronomically accurate scheme.) The 3 broad Paths (Ways) of the great gods Enlil, Anu, and Ea are roughly demarcated bands of varying declination. Opinion still differs whether they were conceived as bands in the sky or arcs along the horizon, and whether they marked declinations of 15, 16 or 17 degrees (with the Path of Anu naturally comprising one of these figures x 2). The Mesopotamian definition of the Paths is connected to the eastern horizon. Hunger/Pingree state (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia, Page 61): "It is clear that the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea meant something different to the author of the second edition of "Astrolabe B" and the compiler of the first list in MUL.APIN." (Ernst Weidner, and others, in the early 20th-century thought the circular astrolabes indicated 3 concentric spheres for the three paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil.) An example of the lack of observational reality is the astrolabe texts place the Pleiades (located near the celestial equator) in the Path of Ea rather than in the Path of Anu (which the later Mul.Apin series does).
Interestingly, Weidner (1915) assumed the scheme of the '3 Ways' represented in Mul.Apin went back to very ancient times. For this scheme, Weidner opted for a date of circa 4500 BCE when the Vernal Equinox was near the stars comprising the feet of the constellation Gemini.
Just how rigidly the boundaries of the "3 Ways" were defined over time is an assumption based on late texts and is not established by any early texts or myths/literature with dates to the 6th-millennium through to the 3rd-millennium BCE. This has implications for the basis for Kolev's claims.
The recent doctoral thesis The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C.E. by Russell Hobson (2009) includes examination of Enuma Anu Enlil tablet 63 (the 'Venus Tablet') and the Mul.Apin series. Of interest is the concluding statement (Page 494) regarding the lack of stabilisation in the transmission of astronomical/omen cuneiform texts. The latter is interesting. Hobson's examination demonstrates persistent error-making by the trained scribal elite in copying cuneiform astronomical/omen texts. And this errormaking occurred over a relatively short period of time. For errors, misreadings, and uncertain signs connected with Mul.Apin see, "Mul.Apin - Catalog of Variants - R. Hobson 2012" (33 pages; http://www.aneapps.com/downloads/mul-apin.pdf). A tradition of oral transmission existed in Mesopotamia. (The numerous variants of popular myths is used as an argument for an oral tradition in Mesopotamia. A group of 'experts' and later, in the Neo-Assyrian period (circa 950-600 BCE), 'chief singers' is identified with oral tradition. It is accepted by a number of scholars that these persons would make slight changes. It appears that in Mesopotamia there was an early reliance/preference for scribes trained to accurately copy texts. According to The Cambridge History of the Bible (Volume 1, 1975, Page 40): "In Mesopotamia oral tradition played only a limited part in the transmission of literary texts after 2,700 B.C., the scribe using an oral source only when all else failed." It is quite evident that scribal tradition = variation and copyist errors. Even the text of the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil exhibits divergences and was not really fixed.
In N.A.B.U. (Nouvelles Assyriologiques Brèves et Utilitaires) 2010, Number 2, Juin, Pages 53-56, and 2010, Number 3, Pages 59-67, Johannes Koch, the late German expert on Babylonian astronomy, in a 2-part article, analyses and rejects Kolev's claims regarding an early date for the astrolabe scheme ("Stammte Astrolab B aus dem 6 Jahrtausend vor Chr. ?"). (Current issues of N.A.B.U. are not readily available electronically. Access is by subscription (27 Euros per year). It amounts to about 120 pages, issued in 4 fascicles. The intention is to publish short notes (4 pages maximum) relatively quickly to current scholarly discussions, or simply for information, without review. Most of N.A.B.U. is very technical Assyriology. Address for subscriptions is: Dominique Charpin (one of the 3 editors), SEPOA, 14, Rue des Sources, 92160 Antony, France.) Kolev's reply to the 1st part of Koch's critique appeared in N.A.B.U. 2010.3, Pages 67-69 ("The



2022. 02. 21. 19:44 History of Constellation and Star Names

Real Age of the Babylonian Astrolabe"). Kolev stated his reply to the 2nd part of the critique by Johannes Koch ("Nochmals: Stammte Astrolab B aus fruhsumerischer Zeit ?"; N.A.B.U. 2010.3) would appear in N.A.B.U. 2010.4. However, with the death of Johannes Koch the editors of N.A.B.U. have stopped accepting further papers on the subject. Undaunted, Kolev, at his website page on the issue (2013), writes: "Kolev, R.: "The Three Celestial Paths in Babylonian Astronomy" (in English) (submitted on May 6th 2011 to N.A.B.U. for publication and as of January 2013 not yet published) (The answer of Kolev to the second article of Koch)."
Kolev uncritically accepts that astronomical ideas of 5500 BCE have/would come down unaltered. There is no evidence to give the claim credibility. We know nothing of Mesopotamian astronomical ideas dating to circa 5500 BCE. Only a particular statistical analysis by Rumen Kolev exists for the date he claims. Earlier claims by Panababylonists based on archaeological evidence were clearly based on misdating. That Kolev claims to have established a date that he has previously promoted - the date claimed by the Panbabylonist Alfred Jeremias - signals caution. But Kolev aims to set aside the results of modern assyriology. According to Kolev modern assyrologists are unreliable. Exclaiming his mathematical analysis to be a conclusive argument simply lacks rigorous reasoning. It is an odd result and one that is at odds with the historical evidence. The claim excludes the necessary use of all the related archaeological evidence and what it indicates. This evidence is scattered across time and place and text genres. The genres involved comprise astronomical, literary (religious), and omen texts. One searches in vain for any conference presentation or published paper by an assyriologist that is supportive of Kolev's claims. As far as I am aware even Simo Parpola has not done this. Kolev's statistical argument is not evidence until it is demonstrated to be relevant and objective. The limitation of the statistical analysis is the certainty of its validity. What other ways exist for an analysis of the data? Presently, the validity of Kolev's approach is questionable and the conclusion he has reached is not unassailable.
In a series of 3 ranting postings to Hastro-L, 13-17 June 2011, titled: KOCH JOHANNES & THE ASTROLABE (THE 5500 BC SAGA of NABU) [Part 1, 2, and 3], Kolev restarted his campaign against Johannes Koch (who was then ill and died a few weeks later) and the editor of N.A.B.U. One Hastro-L member posted (15 June, 2011): "Kolev's Parts I and II contain nothing except his usual delusive statements about and attack on Koch without clearly explaining why and where he disagrees with Koch." Kolev is unable to accept that, with the death of Johannes Koch in mid June, 2011, and the standard of unacceptable conduct exhibited by himself [Kolev], the editor of N.A.B.U. declines to print Kolev's further response to Koch's critique. Kolev sees this as part of an 'establishment' conspiracy to to suppress the truth of his 'revolutionary findings.' This same Hastro-L member who [posted on 15 June also posted (17 June, 2011): "You seem to have ignored the fact that, in the absence of an irrefutable proof, modern elucidation of a set of ancient data does not necessarily equate with its original/contemporary interpretation. In your case, you have fitted a set of old Babylonian observations to a modern mathematical model that apparently holds for the 6th millennium BC and, with no solid proof, expect everyone to accept your preferred model. Please explain why you so vehemently attack Koch's arguments and accuse him of "inventing" a model to deceive the readers of his articles? Do you have access to a contemporary Babylonian source that backs your dates and rejects those concluded by Koch? If another model finds an equally good match dating to ca. 25,000 years earlier than your dates, can we insist that the prehistoric inhabitants of Babylonia had devised the Astrolabe in question? Considering little else and putting your arguments and those of Koch on the balance of probabilities, ca. 1500 BC is a far more likely date than 5500 BC for the data set in question."
Kolev's focus on Koch ignores the article - independently supporting Koch and refuting Kolev - by M[?]. Nickiforov and J[?]. Tabov "Problems of dating of the Babylonian "Astrolabes." (1991?) in which they write: "The calculations show, that there is no historical epoch or turn of the heavenly sphere on a longitude, for which the hypothesis that the order of the constellations in the "astrolabe" follows the order of their declinations is correct. Conclusions: 1. The verifications based on the content of the "astrolabes", the order of the constellations by longitude and the order of the constellations by declination show that the traditional view on the "astrolabes" [as astronomical documents] causes many contradictions. 2. It is possible that the Babylonian "astrolabes" actually do not represent real observations of the star sky. They could be related to some ritual or could be religious or astrological texts. 3. If the "astrolabes" mirror real astronomical observations, probably some basic parts of the Babylonian astronomical texts are deciphered incorrectly, and at least the identification of the constellations, stars and planets for all texts are incorrect. 4. Even if we assume, that the "astrolabes" reflect real astronomical observations, it is difficult to say if the available information could be used for astronomical dating of these observations. Most probably, the "astrolabes" are

[to be] dated by some archaeological data or by other reasons." The authors make the point that the Astrolabes texts are at odds with astronomical reality. This raises the question of the relationship between reality and practice; and why their originators were seemingly unbothered by their contradictions with reality.
If the astrolabe genre was earlier than the 2nd millennium BCE it does not mean the earlier texts would be the same as those we have from the 2nd millennium BCE. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz, an expert on astrolabes - he has been studying them for some 2 decades - states the astrolabe group of tablets never reached a canonical form. Competing versions circulated. "For the Astrolabes ... the group never reached a canonical form which could be passed down from generation to generation. Hence, the four sections of the earliest and most complete form of the Astrolabes, the so-called 12th-century Berlin Astrolabe, better known as Astrolabe B, never occur together on any earlier or later tablet belonging to the group, although each of the four sections survives separately into the first millennium." (Writing Science before the Greeks by Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz (2011, Page 13).)
There is no way in which an orator can identify whether the story being recited is identical to one that was recited thousands of years prior. Modern anthropological work has shown that and oral tradition is not frozen in time. (At least a written record is frozen in time.) The concept that the so-called astrolabe text dates from thousands of years prior to being written down has the problem that there is no evidence of it existing before the first written record discovered. Also there is no plausible mechanism of transmission during the preceding millennia. Everything indicates that Kolev's analysis and results are flawed.
To summarise the views of the British assyriologist David Brown who writes of the "divinatory genre of astrolabe texts": The astrolabe texts, like all cuneiform texts, need to be placed in their cultural, social, and intellectual contexts. Divinatory purposes underpin all 3. The wide array of cuneiform texts on astral sciences ultimately had a divinatory purpose and divinatory lore and purpose shaped the content of the astrolabes - not accurate observational astronomy. The ideal (but not standardised) astrolabe is reflected in Enūma Anu Enlil tablets 50-51. Furthermore astral practices and beliefs of the 2nd-millennium BCE shaped later astral practices and beliefs (those of the 1st-millennium BCE). This is an important point. (Note: There is no reason to believe the 'Astronomical Diaries' were compiled for astrological reasons; rather they were compiled for astronomical reasons.) The assyriologist Alasdair Livingstone, dealing with problems posed by the claim by Werner Papke for a high standard of astronomical knowledge being achieved shortly after the invention of writing, pointed out that it must be envisaged: (1) this astronomical knowledge did not subsequently develop and was ultimately forgotten, and (2) this astronomical knowledge had no appreciable effect on the rest of Babylonian "science." These same points apply to Kolev's claim.
Kolev, being mathematically focused also does not deal with the 10-star tradition and 30-star catalogue. Two Middle Babylonian Period astronomical tablets (HS 1897 and BM 55502 (82-7-4, 76) contain close examples of a star/constellation catalogue in KAV 218 (= Astrolabe B). However, though related to the 36star tradition of the Astrolabes they also contain a 30-star tradition (i.e., 10 stars each in the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea). The Middle Babylonian tablet HS 1897, from Nippur, sets out the earlier 30-star catalogue. (In Babylonian number symbolism 10 was a number of finality or completeness.) When complete the star lists/catalogues of both HS 1897 (late 2nd-millennium (early middle period)) and, what is taken to be the reverse of, BM 55502 (late middle period) list only 30 stars (i.e., 3 x 10; 10 stars in each of the 3 paths of the sky - Enlil, Anu, and Ea. (What is taken to be the obverse of BM 55502 lists 36 rising and setting stars matching Astrolabe B, Section 4 (and parallels).) The use of 30 stars of Enlil, Anu, and Ea would appear to show a 2nd-millennium BCE tradition of listing stars in groups of 10 in each of the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea. These would be important - not monthly - stars for each of the 3 stellar paths. They may have been used to help define the limits of the 3 stellar paths. The Prayer to the Gods of the Night is the earliest surviving evidence of a 10-star tradition. The 10-star version of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (preserved on tablet AO 6769) matches the Sumerian version of the bilingual menology in Astrolabe B, Section 1. In 10 of the 12 months the first item noted in the Sumerian-language version of the menology is the month-star for that month. BM 55502 demonstrates a knowledge of both 30-star and 36-star traditions existing alongside each other for nearly 1000 years. This scheme was later replaced by a scheme of 12 stars for each of the three paths of the sky (3 x 12 = 36). (One star for each country/path and each month. The paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil perhaps derive from the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. The Astrolabe stars are correlated with the lists of Elam-, Akkad-, and Amurru-stars.) However, the 30-star tradition scheme existed alongside the later 36-star scheme for circa the millennium between HS 1897 and BM 55502. The late mention of the 30-star

tradition in the 1st-century BCE writings of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus is likely a garbled form of the 30-star tradition in Babylonia. For the complexity of the astrolabe genre see: Horowitz, Wayne. (2013). "The Astrolabes: An Exercise in Transmission, Canonicity, and Para-Canonicity." In: Banks, Michaela et al. (Editors). Between Text and Text: The Hermeneutics of Intertextuality in Ancient Cultures and Their Afterlife in Medieval and Modern Times. (Pages 273-287).
The Kassite period text VS 24 120: 8-9 is identified by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Page 65) as a forerunner to the menology of Astrolabe B. Also, "It is likely that the 36-star catalogue of Alb B II [Astrolabe B Section II] and the 30-star catalogue first known from HS 1897 have a common ancestor; a star catalogue of the type HS 1897 without the short astrological comments." (The Three Stars Each by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Page 102).)
In his journal The Babylonian Sky Observer (Volume 3, September, 2008) Kolev claims that modern mainstream assyriology is falsifying history. He writes: "[T]he aim of the modern Minimalistic mainstream assyriology seems to be to deny any antiquity to the birth of the Sky Knowledge in Mesopotamia and to push its beginning [forward] somewhere around 1600 BC and even 1200 BC. This is without doubt the most important task of the minimalists. ... Who are these people? Who are the minimalists? They are the vast majority (but not all) of the leading modern scholars who research Mesopotamia - assyriologists, historians, astronomers .... just any well established scholar with interest in the field. Most of them seem to be brainwashed people who really believe in what they say. I, however, do not exclude the possibility that some are conscious or semi-conscious perpetrators. Their ultimate aim is to keep under veil the ancient Knowledge of Mesopotamia. They reach this trough many different ways of manipulation, indoctrination, censorship and outright suppression of research. Some methods may be very rude including sacking of 'dangerous' scholars and their gradual elimination from the academic life." No evidence is offered for any of these uninformed claims. The ferocity of these absurd attacks have increased in his lengthy article "The Destruction of the panBabylonism or pan-Babylonian Fantasies becoming reality." in Volume 5 of The Babylonian Sky Observer (Published 2010). The Babylonian Sky Observer, which is produced and edited by Rumen Kolev, is the vehicle for his views. None of his articles on the Astrolabe have, to date, been published in a professional refereed journal. Unacknowledged (unknown?) to Kolev is the early dates of the Panbabylonists were tied to a flawed chronology.
The absurdity of Kolev's position is his own decision. The knowledge gained by sophisticated modern assyriology is rejected as deliberately distorting/obscuring the knowledge established by the German Panbabylonists Alfred Jeremias and Ernst Weidner - and Kolev seeks to vindicate their original dating for Babylonian astronomy. Ignored is the fact that Ernst Weidner (an assyriologist) started his own assyriology journal circa the 1930s and continued to edit and publish it until his death in 1976 - yet, except for (inappropriately) dating some star-lists to the 3rd-millennium BCE, never attempted to defend his earlier positions, nor those of Alfred Jeremias.
Rumen Kolev also supports the flawed system of astrological 'primary directions' developed by the 17thcentury Italian monk Placidus de Titus.
At his website Kolev has posted (June, 2011) his 5-page: *THE CRITIQUE of GARY THOMPSON CONCERNING THE 5,500 BC DATING of THE ASTROLABE*. (Kolev apparently thinks they were my sole comments when in fact they were only my initial comments.) Kolev 'cherry picks' material to reply to and ensure he keeps the focus purely on his claims for accuracy with mathematical/statistical analysis. Needless to say he avoids/misunderstands arguments concerning the interrelatedness of multiple 2ndmillennium BCE documents. Completely ignore are the concepts of omen astronomy controlling/distorting the literal observational accuracy of the Astrolabes and Mul.Apin. Both Wayne Horowitz and David Brown have made the point that the star/constellation data in in the Astrolabes and Mul.Apin were never intended to accurately reflect reality. There is no convincing reason to consider the Astrolabes and the Mul.Apin series to be primarily astronomical documents. Ignored by Kolev is the relationship between the Astrolabes and the Enūma Elish and the Enūma Anu Enlil. The Astrolabes are connected to the creation epic Enūma Elish and all are connected with the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil, very much a late 2nd-millennium BCE text. This is a 'sticking point' for Kolev's dating arguments. Combined with the fact that he refuses to acknowledge he is dealing with omen astronomical (astral omenology) documents his arguments are unpersuasive, except to himself. Nothing recovered to date from Sumerian period texts matches the Old Babylonian omen texts. Interestingly, Kolev also denies statements that he has made.

at ACT Astrology (actastrology.com) he posted "The first coordinate system going back to 5,500 BC was an equatorial system consisting of 3 circles-paths each divided in 12 sections." I have mentioned this statement above, adding his accuracy criteria that he had mentioned elsewhere: [± 300 years]. However, in his supposed "*THE CRITIQUE of GARY THOMPSON ...." he writes (very first statement): "Gary Thompson quotes me as having said: "The first coordinate system going back to 5,500 BC [± 300 years] was an equatorial system consisting of 3 circles-paths each divided in 12 sections." This is not true." It very much is true that I have reliably quoted Kolev.
Kolev commits what David Fischer termed the fallacy of the overwhelming exception which occurs when the historian/person excludes evidence that is vital to constructing the whole picture. This leaves to one side the issue of the fallacy of statistical sampling which occurs in generalisations resting upon an insufficient body of data. There is sufficient completeness of archaeological/philological evidence from Mesopotamia to conclude there is an association between Astrolabes and 2nd-millennium BCE omen astronomy and creation epic astronomy. Kolev's acknowledgement of associated evidence playing a role is given in his response that a correlation date of 25,000 BCE would not be realistic as it would not fit with other (historical) evidence.
Regardless of any claimed statistically significant outcome independent archaeological/philological confirmation is necessary. Tests of significance can be very misleading, especially where small data sets are involved. Quoting p values as an indicator that error is unlikely is a fallacy. Depending, the opportunities for error (so-called false positives) could be 30-40 percent or higher. A statement of p value and confidence intervals is one issue. Because of opportunities for error in statistical/experimental procedures, techniques such as the Bonferroni procedure and the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure, have been developed. Two questions that go with claims for statistical significance: Why is it considered statistically significant? What is the chance of getting statistically significant results? The significance test and its result should perhaps be regarded as a prima facie test only with the results being open to question if further supportive evidence is not to be found.
As previously remarked, tests of significance can be very misleading. A statistical analysis of misleading data produces misleading conclusions. The reliability of the data used is a problem. The Astrolabe data is viewed as a literally accurate star calendar. however, there is no expert consensus that this is the case. The possibility of a false discovery with the data set is ignored. The statement of p value and confidence intervals is one issue. The p value is neither as reliable nor as objective as most people assume. Though p values are called confidence values they are not measures of accuracy. In spite of what Kolev claims for statistics, a high p value for significance does not rule out error. When British statistician Ronald Fisher introduced the p value in the 1920s, he did not mean it to be a definitive test. He intended it simply as an informal way to judge whether evidence was significant and worthy of a second look. Kolev needs to report effect sizes and confidence intervals as these convey what a p value does not: the magnitude and relative importance of an 'effect.' The p value cannot be construed as a statement about the underlying reality. Kolev's conclusion requires a lot more evidence than simply a p value. It is an exploratory study which should be treated with skepticism unless other tangible supporting evidence is found. The plausibility of the outcome is an important factor in an assessment. The more implausible the hypothesis - sophisticated astronomy in Mesopotamia circa 5500 BCE - the greater the chance that a finding is a false alarm, no matter what the p value is. Also, the reminder, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. An analysis not using a p value would be more convincing. It is actually possible to 'fish' for significant p values (known as p-hacking (= data dredging or significance chasing)).
For his conclusions to be regarded as reliable, Kolev needs to include examples from earlier researches (by anybody) that demonstrates the methodological success of his approach. Otherwise, we can rest assured that statistics can prove anything.
Kolev's claim that: "If the Astrolabe was not an astronomical text, then its model would be a random model." lacks any demonstration or explanation on Kolev's part. Why would randomness be the most probable alternative?

See Kolov's restated critique of parts of my rebuttal at: http://www.babylonianastrology.com/index2.php? option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=31&Itemid=33. No document interrelatedness discussion is entered into.
UPDATE NOTE (July 11, 2013; from Page 3): Kolev, Rumen. (2013). The Babylonian Astrolabe: The Calendar of Creation. [Note: It is surprising to see this published as State Archives of Assyria Studies 22, Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project – NATCP. Though it claims to be the first full critical edition of all currently known astrolabe texts it is written from the perspective of the Panbabylonism of Alfred Jeremias. Kolev particularly supports the Panbabylonian ideas of Alfred Jeremias. Alfred Jeremias) thought that Mesopotamian/Sumerian astrology originated in the supposed zodiacal age of Gemini (circa 5,000-6,000 BCE) and is the foundation of all the religions and cultures throughout the world. Kolev claims that with his book (The Babylonian Astrolabe: the Calendar of Creation (2013)) he has reestablished the veracity of all the claims of the Panbabylonists! Of course Kolev has done no such thing, excepting in his own imagination. Kolev has avoided the peer review process of his ideas in professional publications. Part of the critical issue is (1) the existing divergence of views on the width of the "three ways each," (2) contradictions in astrolabe texts for stars and their associated months, and (3) astrological considerations rather than astronomical considerations regarding placement of stars and planets in the paths of the "three ways each." (See a suitable summary discussion in: Poetic Astronomy in the Ancient Near East by Jeffrey Cooley (2013, Pages 58-63).) Kolev's book will be redundant with the publication of The Three Stars Each: The Astrolabes and Related Texts by Wayne Horowitz (in press 2013). Publisher's description of Kolev's book: "The Babylonian Astrolabe, or "Three Stars Each (Month)," as it was called in antiquity, is an enigmatic document that has been the subject of much controversy and debate ever since its discovery in the 1870s. It comes in two versions, a circular star map divided in three concentric "paths" and 12 month sectors, and a multicolumn text specifying the times of the heliacal risings of the stars and associating them with the main divinities of the Mesopotamian pantheon and the main events of the Mesopotamian cultic year. Both texts were of fundamental importance to Mesopotamian astral sciences, religion, and royal ideology, all of which were ultimately based on the 360-day "perfect year" of the astrolabes. This is the first full critical edition of all currently known astrolabe texts and a ground-breaking study of their astronomical content, showing that the text as it has come down to us consists of three redactional layers dating from different time periods, the earliest of which is to be dated to prehistoric times (ca. 5000 BCE). The appendixes to the book include 255 first-hand observations of heliacal phases of stars and planets and an appendix explaining in detail the heliacal phases." Rumen Kolev is a Bulgarian astrologer, astrology software developer, mathematician, and amateur astronomer. Kolev's practical astronomy work specialises in heliacal rising phenomena and he has been mistaken on Hastro-L as an (amateur) astronomer (and not wearing any other 'caps') for his excellent work on the heliacal risings of stars and planets. However, it is all simply all 'grist for the mill' for his astrological software. Simo Parpola is a somewhat uncritical Panbabylonist who has mentored the astrologer Rumen Kolev who is also a Panbabylonist (with a particular misplaced venom against Franz Kugler). The 3part critique of Kolev's claims by the late Johannes Koch in NABU will likely be brushed aside by Kolev. Kolev will also likely produce a book on Panbabylonism. A number of years ago he had an arrangement with a publisher to do this, but lacked the core publications. Both Parpola and Kolev probably did not know that Wayne Horowitz had (finally) completed his book on the astrolabes (likely to be the definitive study); or if they did it was a race to get into print first. Luckily, Wayne Horowitz's book (The Three Stars Each: The Astrolabes and Related Texts) is 'in press' 2013 and will likely appear 2015 latest.]
I am not aware of any publication by Rumen Kolev regarding his Astrolabe dating claims appearing in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. As Kolev dates his original discovery to July 2005 it appears this is unlikely to happen. (I am aware that Kolev claims (http://alabe.com/placidus.html) that the Mesopotamian module for his Placidus 7 astrology software program (released 2012) "... brings to life the astrology practiced in Mesopotamia from 5500 BC to 70 AD.") Peer Review is a process that academic/scientific journals use to ensure the articles they publish represent the best scholarship currently available. The peer review process for journal publication is essentially a quality control mechanism. An article submitted for publication is submitted to experts in the field who then carefully evaluate the quality of the submitted manuscript. The reviewers check the manuscript for accuracy and assess the validity of the research methodology and procedures. (Reviewers would ideally critique how the data analysis was done and how results were reported and interpreted.) If appropriate, they suggest revisions. If they find the article lacking in scholarly validity and rigor, they reject it. Because a peer-reviewed journal will not publish articles that fail to meet the standards established for a given discipline, peer-reviewed articles that are accepted for

publication exemplify the best research practices in a field. Peer-reviewed articles provide a trusted form of scientific communication.
Finally, one reliable investigator has written (Hastro-L, 27-7-2013): "I am reading your book (which is now part of history;-) and I have tried to calculate the same graphs and distributions (page 35-64) as you did in your book (except I am using Schaefer's heliacal rise theory). And I agree that your date of around 5600 BCE makes sure that most star paths (EN.LIL/ANU/EA) (using Pingree's azimuthal model) map the astrolabes (like the Berlin one). Using the same method: the MUL.APIN would be from around 900 BCE. This is indeed very interesting! What would be interesting to know: Why the Babylonians kept presenting this 'old'/historic data (star's heliacal rise azimuth of around 5500 BCE) while over time these would have changed (and they even knew that, like in the MUL.APIN [~900 BCE])? So a kind of history of astronomy in Babylonian times..." Kolov has not responded to this issue.
Summary of Views of Wayne Horowitz and David Brown on Astrolabes and Star Lists: Astrolabes were an Old Babylonian or early Middle Babylonian creation. The Babylonian circular star calendar was divided into 36 individual stellar sectors (with one sector for each of the 36 stars) comprising 3 concentric bands (rings) (marking the borders between the 3 stellar paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil) each divided by 12 radial lines (demarking the 12 months of the year). The astrolabe genre was a scheme in which 3 stars, 1 lying in each star path, were meant ideally to rise heliacally, in each of the 12 months of the 'ideal year.' (No days, only months are noted in the astrolabes.) Astrolabes were not a sidereal calendar, though a residue of certain traditional seasonal-stellar associations may have filtered in to them. It may be that star lists – including Mul.Apin – were never intended accurately to reflect reality. There may have been (overriding) divinatory reasons. There was precedence of divinatory (astral omenology) thinking over astronomical reality. Even lists of simultaneously rising and setting stars likely include ideal propositions. Star data were produced 'artificially' only corresponding very broadly to reality. Babylonian omen astronomy included parameters that could not actually occur astronomically. The best preserved text of Astrolabe B is Schroeder KAV 218 from Assur and dated to circa 1100 BCE. Its relationship to EAE omen series is very close. It shares the same ideal year attested in EAE 14, and omens in EAE 51. Horowitz has provided reasons to believe the content of the Pinches-type astrolabes and the Hilprecht text HS 245 derives from a common Old Babylonian tradition that leads ultimately to the compendium we know as Astrolabe B. The astrological omina underpinning the purpose of the astrolabes and exhaustively collected in the Enuma Anu Enlil are controlled by rules, codes, and categorisations, and the use of ideal periods (year, month, day) for practical astrological purposes. Summary of Views of Wayne Horowitz on Affinities Between Texts: There are affinities between the Astrolabes, the Enuma Elish, and the Enūma Anu Enlil omen series. The Enuma Elish relates the origin of the 36 star astrolabe genre. In Tablet 5 lines 1-8 of the Enuma Elish (dated by some to the early Kassite era circa 1800-1600 BCE but likely circa 1200 BCE), the newly established principal god Marduk decides to establish a system of 36 stellar sectors (3 stars for each of the 12 months of the year i.e., 1 per sector) by bringing into existence 3 stellar paths (the path of Enlil, the path of Anu, the path of Ea) divided by 12 radii. No Sumerian writing offers a definitive creation account of the type found in the Babylonian Enuma Elish.
The evidence indicates that in Mesopotamia, aside from calendrical matters, astral omens preceded scientific astronomy. The earliest collections of celestial omens in Mesopotamia emerge in the Old Babylonia period, and reflected a purely Akkadian genre. Their main focus is indicated a lunar eclipses. The idea of signs in the heavens was, however, already established at least at Lagash in the late 3rd-millennium BCE (Cylinders of Gudea). (Lagash (modern Telloh) was one of the oldest and most important cities in ancient Sumer, located midway between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in southeastern Iraq.) Also, the believed divine origin (and hence revealed character of its knowledge) of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil made the text fundamentally unalterable. However, the evidence indicates that text standardisation (literary stabilisation) involving deemed official scientific texts (involving the disciplines of divination, medicine, and magic) took place only in the Kassite period (1595-1155 BCE). Regardless, texts continued to appear that were produced by a different stream of tradition (para-canonicity). Additionally, there is the problem that texts may well have been corrupted, edited, and added onto.
Kolev's claim that the Panbabylonists were correct in their early dating for Babylonian astronomy is unfounded and unsupported by his own radical claims. With his controversial astrolabe dating claim Kolev only manages to introduce more controversial and flawed evidence. Nowhere does Kolev show that the original evidence and arguments of the Panbabylonists have veracity. Working against the high antiquity of scientific astronomy in Babylonia is the fact that in the Old Babylonian omen literature the Babylonians used

to predict eclipses by the risings, settings, and colours of the planets, and by liver- and oil-divination, and astronomical omens such as halos, and fog. (See: Antike Beobachtungen farbiger Sterne by Franz Boll (1916, Page 24); "Babylonian Celestial Divination." by Erica Reiner. In: Ancient Astronomy and Celestial Divination edited by Noel Swerdlow. (1999, Pages 21-37; Page 23); Observations and Predictions of Eclipse Times by Early Astronomers by John Steele (2000); and "Eclipse Prediction in Mesopotamia." by John Steele (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 54, Number 5, February, 2000, Pages 421-454; See Page 426).) Not until the Assyrian period were attempts made to predict eclipses using sound astronomical knowledge. Circa the early 7th-century BCE lunar eclipses could be predicted only shortly before their occurrence. There is no evidence that the Babylonians possessed a physical theory of eclipses.
The (English-language) book review by John Steele, "Review of R. K. Kolev, The Babylonian Astrolabe: The Calendar of Creation," is in preparation to appear in the journal Archiv für Orientforschung.
Appendix 5: The Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru
Two texts (K 250 and K 8067) give 12 Stars of Elam, 12 of Akkad, and 12 of Amurru. (These are actually constellations.) The cuneiform texts are published in CT XXVI (Plates 40-41 and 44). Due to damage to the surviving texts we presently know 27 of the 36 stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. These 27 stars also occur in the "Astrolabes" and likewise are listed in order of their heliacal-risings. This establishes that the Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru are month-stars.
The term "Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru" may indicate different local traditions. Wayne Horowitz (MCG) states that the names of 27 of the 36 Elam-, Akkad-, and Amurru-stars are presently known. All of these 27 occur in the 'Astrolabes.' Horowitz also states that while these stars are month-stars their exact function (for example, omen function for the 3 countries Elam, Akkad, and Amurru - 1 star for each country and each month) is not certain. (At this period the different parts of the moon were also associated with Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. Akkad was the old designation of Babylonia.) The Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil perhaps derive from the earlier month-star system of the politically-based stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. However, how the correspondence was determined is unknown. In 1949 Bartel van der Waerden suggested that the paths of Ea, Anu, and Ellil derive ultimately from the "Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru." The assyriologist Ulla Koch-Westenholz (Mesopotamian Astrology (1995, Pages 49-50)) in part of her translation of the directions for observing and interpreting an eclipse given in tablet 4 of the Astrological Commentary Šumma Sin ina tāmartišu gives the statement "The Path of the stars of Enlil is for Akkad, the Path of the stars of Anu is for Elam, the Path of the stars of Ea is for Amurru." More recently, Wayne Horowitz states that no principle for the relationship between the Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru and the 'Astrolabes' and the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil is presently discernable. However, in his Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (Page 175) he writes: "A missing link between the "Astrolabe" lists and the [earlier] lists of Akkad, Elam, and Amurru-stars may be found in the astrological fragment 81-7-27, 81 - a learned commentary (mukallimtu) to the series Enuma Anu Enlil."
There were 3 major ethno-political forces during the late 3rd-millennium BCE (Neo-Sumerian Period) and early 2nd-millennium BCE (the Old Babylonian Period); Sumer and Akkad, Elam, and Subartu and Amurru. (Amurru, the land of the Amorites, was Syria.) The lists of Elam-, Akkad-, and Amurru- stars may not be as old as the Old Babylonian period as suggested by Bartel van der Waerden. In terms of the "Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru," Elam was the land to the east and was connected to the left, Amurru was the land to the west and was connected with the right, and Akkad, the home country, was located in-between (i.e., central). The god Anu was associated with Elam, the god Ea was associated with Amurru, and the god Enlil was associated with Akkad. In the 'Astrolabes' Anu was the god for the central part of the sky, Ea was the god for the southern part of the sky, and Enlil was the god for the northern part of the sky.
The earliest evidence for the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil dates to the 2nd-millennium BCE. The final section of a Hittite version of the Old Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night (on VAT 7445, dated circa 1300/1200 BCE) enumerates 17 stars belonging to Ea and also refers to the stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. Not used, however, is the term harranu (= paths). Wayne Horowitz states (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography): "The earliest surviving evidence for harranu itself dates to the late second millennium; the Middle Babylonian "forerunner" to the "Astrolabes" HS 1897 from Jena and the slightly later Middle Assyrian Astrolabe KAV 218 (Astrolabe B)."

Note: Regarding en-te-na-bar-hum/sig (Habasirānu). There remains some uncertainty about how to transcribe the Sumerian name of this star/constellation, as well as its exact identity. Various transcriptions such as Hasirānu / Habasirāttu are used. Thought by early assyriologists to be a star name but, perhaps correctly, by contemporary assyriologists to be a constellation (figure of a mouse (mouse-like creature) or rodent (?)) occupying most of the stars of Centaurus. (The name infers a mouse or rodent.) In Astrolabe B, Section C, Habasirānu is replaced by nu.muš.da ('Swarm') (and the Hyades are replaced by gu-la (gula) (Aquarius)). The identification of nu.muš.da is uncertain, and also whether it is a name for a constellation or single star (but Hunger/Pingree (1999) identify the star η or κ Centauri).

Appendix 9: The Identification of Stars and Constellations
After a lengthy discussion of the issues Hunger/Pingree state (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia, Page 63): "The "astrolabe" lists provide no information useful for identifying the constellations because we do not know the principles of their categorizations."
The primary effort in successfully identifying the constellations and star names listed in BM 86378 (Mul.Apin tablet 1) was carried out by first by Franz Kugler and then by Carl Bezold and August Kopff. The type of information contained in the constellation/star lists in Mul.Apin tablet 1 (BM 86378), an autograph copy of which was first published by the British Assyriologist Leonard King in 1912, provided a unique opportunity for the identification of Babylonian constellations. The Kopff-Bezold results (Zenit- und Aequatorialgestirne am babylonischen Fixsternhimmel (1913)) largely agree with the identifications made by Franz Kugler in his Supplement 1 (1913) to his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. Further work by later scholars largely confirmed their results.
The two tablets comprising the Mul.Apin series are essentially a series of structured lists grouped into 18 sections. Tablet 1 basically contains eight sections (including five star lists):
(1) A list of 33 stars in the Path of Anu, 23 stars in the Path of Enlil, and 15 stars in the Path of Ea.
(2) A sequential list of (heliacal rising) dates in the ideal calendar (i.e., based on a year comprised of 12 months of 30 days each) on which 36 fixed stars and constellations rose heliacally.
(3) A list of simultaneously rising and setting constellations.
(4) Time intervals between the heliacal rising dates of some selected stars.
(5) The visibility of the fixed stars in the East and the West.
(6) A list of 14 ziqpu-stars (i.e., stars which culminate overhead).
(7) The relation between the culmination of zipqu-stars and their heliacal rising.
(8) A list of stars and planets in the path of the moon. (The beginning of the second tablet continues the listing of (8) in tablet 1.)

The data contained in the Mul.Apin series is not quantifiable (i.e., precisely defined) and appropriate assumptions are required to be made (i.e., of the stars forming each constellation and which of these stars were listed to rise heliacally).
Kugler in his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Erg. 1, used lists (2) (3) and (6) and computed for 500 BCE at Babylon. Kopff used the same lists and computed for 600 BCE at Nineveh. I am presently unsure what lists Weidner used and what date and location he computed for. Later researchers used different lists. The German assyriologist Johann Schaumberger in his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Erg. 3, used lists (1) and (2). The Dutch mathematician Bartel van der Waerden in his Anfänge der astronomie (1966) used lists (2) and (4). List (4) is compiled from list (2) and its data is most subject to inaccuracy. Many significant differences exist between the identifications made by these four scholars. Erica Reiner and David Pingree, Babylonian Planetary Omens: Part Two (1981), using lists (3) and (6) in conjunction with a planetarium projector, concluded that the data best fit the date 1000 BCE and the location of Nineveh (circa 36° north). List (3) is independent of the schematic dates of risings in list (2).Also, the simultaneously setting constellations of list (3) are clearly determined by observation. List (3) was also the foundation for the constellation identifications (and the date and place of the observations) made by Herman Hunger and David Pingree in their Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999).
Appendix 10: Earliest Babylonian Constellation/Star Records
The first formal compendium of constellation/star lists only appear circa the mid 12th-century BCE. These are the Three Stars Each (kakkabū 3ta.am) texts (i.e., star calendars). These constellation/star lists also appear in the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil which was consolidated sometime in the last quarter of the 2ndmillennium BCE. The second formal compendium of constellation/star lists appears circa 1100 BCE. This second (expanded) and more accurate compendium, basically derived from the Three Stars Each texts/lists, appears in the two-tablet Mul.Apin series. Both schemes are based on a tripartite division of the sky: the northern path of the god Enlil, the middle path of the god Anu, and the southern path of the god Ea. In the Three Stars Each scheme the 12 stars in each path are also individually placed into 12 sectors dividing the 3 paths. Two Middle Babylonian Period astronomical tablets (HS 1897 and BM 55502 (82-7-4, 76) contain close examples of a star/constellation catalogue in KAV 218 (= Astrolabe B). However, though related to the 36-star tradition of the Astrolabes they also contain a 30-star tradition (i.e., 10 stars each in the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea). The Middle Babylonian tablet HS 1897, from Nippur, sets out the earlier 30-star catalogue. (In Babylonian number symbolism 10 was a number of finality or completeness.)
However, the earliest records of Babylonian constellations/stars date to the Old Babylonian Period. One astronomical (observational) text survives (the so-called Venus text (Tablet 63 of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil)), one astral omen text survives (related to the crescent moon becoming visible at the beginning of the new year - but no constellation/star names are recorded), and one prayer text (in two slightly variant versions) also survives (Prayer to the Gods of the Night).
The one astronomical text survives as a corrupted 7th-century copy, from the library of King Ashurbanipal (Tablet 63 of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil), of observations of the planet Venus (and also 59 associated astral omens) most probably made during the 21 year reign of King Ammisaduqa. No constellation/star names are recorded. (The recorded observations of Venus comprised the first and last appearances of Venus in the morning or evening sky, on the occasion of each conjunction with the sun, for 21 years.)
The one known astrological text was published by the Russian assyriologist Woldemar (Vladimir) Shilejko in 1927 (in the Russian journal Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR). The text contains predictions based on the state of the sky on the day when the crescent moon just becomes visible, at the beginning of the new year. (A summary of the paper was also later published in German.) No constellation/star names are recorded. The text of the Shilejko omen tablet contains 9 omens concerning the appearance of the sky, some omens concerning lunar phenomena, and some omens concerning atmospheric phenomena. Since then a number of other omen texts dating to the Old Babylonian period have become known (4 Old Babylonian tablets containing lunar eclipse omens have been identified in the British Museum): 5 or 6 tablets deal with lunar eclipse omens, 1 tablet deals with solar eclipse omens, and 1 tablet deals with planetary omens. (See: Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology by David Brown (2000).) Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 29 by Oliver Rouault (2011) discusses a (new?) fragment of a divinatory report dated to the Old Babylonian period.

Star names and constellations are mentioned in the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (also called Prayer for a Haruspicy at Night). (The relevant texts include AO 6769, K 2315, and K 3507.) This prayer was used in the course of a divination ceremony carried out at night. The great gods who ordinarily control the affairs of the world during the day are regarded asleep and resting during the night. These gods are therefore represented by several of the constellations of fixed stars. These constellations/stars are asked to witness the ritual and to guarantee that a true answer will be divined. One of two known texts of Prayer to the Gods of the Night dating from the Old Babylonian Period (preserved on AO 6769) refers to the names of 10 stars/constellations. The other (slightly variant) version was published by the Russian assyriologist Woldemar (Vladimir) Shilejko and lists only 9 stars/constellations. The earliest version of these is dated circa 1700 BCE. (A 3rd Old Babylonian version was identified in 1996 by Wayne Horowitz and Nathan Wasserman.) Two later versions are known: Hittite (circa 1300/1200 BCE) and Assyrian (circa 700 BCE from the library of king Assurbanipal (the latter actually exist as several fragmentary copies)). The breaks in the fragmentary texts involve the star-list. (A few constellations in this later version vary from those listed in the earliest version i.e., Ferry (= nēberu = Jupiter).) The Hittite version (on tablet VAT 7445 (published in KUB, Volume 4, Number 47) recovered from Boghazköy, the captial of the Hittite empire), embeds in a Hittite ritual a transcription by a Hittite scribe of an Old Babylonian Period text and enumerates 17 stars/constellations (belonging to the path of Ea). The Prayer to the Gods of the Night is the earliest surviving evidence of a 10-star tradition (i.e., 10 stars are assigned to the 12 months of the year). The use of 30 stars of Enlil, Anu, and Ea would appear to show a 2nd-millennium BCE tradition of listing stars in groups of 10 (i.e., 3 x 10; 10 stars each in the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea). That is a division into 30 individual sectors comprising 3 concentric bands (rings) each divided by 10 radial lines. These would be important - not monthly - stars.) Both BM 55502 and HS 1897 preserve catalogues listing 30 stars - 10 stars each for the three paths of the sky. This scheme was later replaced by a scheme of 12 stars for each of the three paths of the sky (3 x 12 = 36). (One star for each country/path and each month. The paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil perhaps derive from the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru.) However, the 30-star tradition scheme existed alongside the later 36-star scheme for circa the millennium between HS 1897 (late 2nd-millennium (early middle period)) and BM 55502 (late middle period). The 1st-millennium BCE tradition of Tikpi-, Māšu-, and Lumāšu-stars was based on the number 7. In K 250 and K 2067 (correctly K 8067?) (CT XXVI, Pages 40-41, 45) certain stars are arranged in groups of 7 Tikpi, 7 Lumāšu, and 7 Māšu.
The Tikpi-stars: (a) (1) mul su-gi (Perseus), (2) mul gu4-an-[na] / mul gu-an-na (Taurus), (3) mul sipa-zi-anna / mul sitaddalu (Orion), (4) mul ur-gu-[la] / mul urgu[lu] (Leo), (5) mul mus / mul siru (Hydra (+ β Cancer) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has Hydra), (6) mul gir-tab / mul zuqaqipu (Scorpius), and (7) mul lu-lim (Andromeda + Cassiopeia) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has Cassiopeia). (b) (1) mul gumlu (Auriga) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul gam = Auriga), (2) mul sarru (Regulus) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul lugal = α Leonis), (3) mul a-zu(?)-in (not yet identified) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul u5-ri-in = (?)), (4) mul ka-mus.niku.a (Andromeda-fog (?) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul ka-mus-ni-ku-e = α Cassiopeia), (5) mul gisli (Taurus) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul is li-e = Hyades), (6) mul siru (Hydra + β Cancri), and (7) mul us.si (Antares) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has mul NE-gun = α Scorpii). The Babylonians had 7 Tikpi-stars (i.e., red coloured stars) assigned to the planet Mars.
The Māšu-stars: (1) mul tu'amu rabuti / mul mas-tab-ba-gal-gal (α + β Gemini), (2) mul tu'amu sihruti / mul mas-tab-ba-tur-tur (λ + ζ Gemini (or τ + ν Gemini)), (3) mul tu'amu sa ina mihrit sitaddali izzazu / mul mastab-ba vis-à-vis the mul sipa-zi-an-na (? α + γ Orionis (ε + γ Geminorum)) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") has Orion + ε + γ Geminorum), (4) mul nin.sar and mul ur(?).ra.gal (mul ir-ra-gal) (? not yet identified / η + θ Lyrae ?), (5) mul pa and mul lu.gal (? not yet identified) (mul hanis mul sullat (α + β Centauri), (6) mul sar.ur and mul sar.gaz (λ + ν Scorpii), and (7) mul zibanitu / zi-ba-an-na (variation mul ku-an-na / mul ku-ki-sikil-la (The Scales (Libra / α + β Librae)). The 7 Māšu-stars were pairs of stars i.e., 'twin stars.'
The Lumāšu-stars (= Jupiter stars) (CT XXVI) (K250 and VAT 9418): (1) mul su-gi (Perseus), (2) mul u4-kadu-a / mul nimru (Cygnus + Cepheus, (3) mul sipa-zi-an-na / mul sitaddulu (Orion), (4) mul kak-si-sa / mul sukudu (Sirius + Procyon) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") simply has Sirius), (5) Habasiranu (Centaurus) (Ernst Weidner (RLA "Fixsterne") has mul en-te-na-bar-sig = Centurus?), (6) mul nasru (Eagle (Aquila)), and (7) mul pa.bil.sag (Sagittarius). In Akkadian the term Lumāšu referred to (1) one of several stars whose heliacal risings fell at or near the solstices and equinoxes, and thereby served to divide the year, and (2) the zodiacal constellations, or a zodiacal constellation. Franz Boll believed the 7 lumāšu-stars were selected on

the principal of the resemblance of their colour to that of Jupiter (planet of Marduk). The lumāšu-stars listed in late sources lie along the Milky Way.
Appendix 11: Apparent Scheme of Babylonian Star Lists to Mul.Apin/Possible Development of the Astrolabes (Three Stars Each)
(1) The Prayer to the Gods of the Night is the earliest surviving evidence of a star-list (and this star-list indicates a 10-star tradition). The Prayer dates to the Old Babylonian period and was perhaps extant circa 1800 BCE. The 10-star version of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (preserved on tablet AO 6769) matches the Sumerian version of the bilingual menology in Astrolabe B, Section 1. In 10 of the 12 months the first item noted in the Sumerian-language version of the menology is the month-star for that month. The Prayer to the Gods of the Night listing 10 stars/constellations anticipates the 10-star astrolabe tradition. This 10-star list refers to Ištar, Sîn, Šamaš, and Adad bringing judgement. This reflects the 4 divisions of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil.
(2) Development of 30-star tradition astrolabe. Circa 1400 BCE development/composition of a list of 30 heliacally rising stars, 10 each in the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. Note: The original list from which both the Astrolabes and the Mul.Apin lists were derived. The Kassite period texts VS 24 120 (from Babylon) and HS 1897 (from Nippur) provide antecedents to Sections 1 and 2 respectively of Astrolabe B. The roughly contemporary text KUB 4 47 Prayer to the Gods of the Night, from Boghazoköy, provides the earliest direct evidence for the division of the night sky into the three Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. (Not used, however, is the term harranu (= paths).) No known precursors of any kind are presently known for Sections 3-4 of Astrolabe B. (BM 55502 (obverse unpublished) is also an "Astrolabe" text from Babylon and is dated to the Late Babylonian Period. The reverse of the tablet (published) contained a star catalogue listing 30 stars. Like the earlier "Astrolabes" the text is divided into three groups of ten stars from the Paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil.) When complete the star lists/catalogues of both HS 1897 (late 2nd-millennium (early middle period)) and, what is taken to be the reverse of, BM 55502 (late middle period) list only 30 stars (i.e., 3 x 10; 10 stars in each of the 3 paths of the sky - Enlil, Anu, and Ea. The use of 30 stars of Enlil, Anu, and Ea would appear to show a 2nd-millennium BCE tradition of listing stars in groups of 10 in each of the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea. These would be important - not monthly - stars for each of the 3 stellar paths. They may have been used to help define the limits of the 3 stellar paths. Often the stars/constellations do not actually reside in their named star-paths - the paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil. This suggests that the star-paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil were introduced later than the stars/constellations assigned to them.
(3) Development of the Stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru. 12 stars of Elam, 12 stars of Akkad, and 12 stars of Amurru. (These are actually constellations.) The Babylonian cuneiform tablets are K 250 and K 8067. Circa 1200 BCE tabular lists of the 12 stars of Elam, the 12 stars of Akkad, and the 12 stars of Amurru. Note: The names Elam, Akkad, and Amurru reflect the political situation in the Old Babylonian Period. (Note: It was suggested by Bartel van der Waerden (Science Awakening II) that these star lists preceded, and formed the basis for, the Three Stars Each texts. However, Wayne Horowitz (In: Calendars and Years, edited by John Steele (2007)) writes: "It was suggested at one time that the lists of 36 Elam, Akkad, and Amurrustars found in The Great Star List were forerunners to the Astrolabe lists, but this idea must now be abandoned given the discovery of the 30 star precursor in HS 1897.") It is thought likely that the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru formed part of the divinatory background to the astrolabes.
(4) Development of 36-star tradition astrolabe. What is taken to be the obverse of BM 55502 lists 36 rising and setting stars matching Astrolabe B, Section 4 (and parallels). BM 55502 demonstrates a knowledge of both 30-star and 36-star traditions existing alongside each other for nearly 1000 years. This scheme was later replaced by a scheme of 12 stars for each of the three paths of the sky (3 x 12 = 36). (One star for each country/path and each month. The paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil perhaps derive from the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru.) However, the 30-star tradition scheme existed alongside the later 36-star scheme for circa the millennium between HS 1897 and BM 55502. Circa 1150 BCE circular planispheres (astrolabes) of the "three stars each" star calendars (12 stars of Ea, 12 stars of Anu, and 12 stars of Enlil). The astrolabes may have developed from the early star lists - 10-star tradition and expanded tradition, such as the 17-star list from Boghazköy (VAT 7445). Note: The omen fragment 81-7-27 provides a link between the lists of Akkad, Elam, and Amurru stars and the (later) Astrolabe lists. Sections 3-4 of Astrolabe B preserve the earliest surviving lists of 12-month stars for each of the three traditional stellar paths of Mesopotamian astronomy, giving a total of 36 stars.

(5) The Assumed Tablet 51 of the Omen Series Enūma Anu Enlil. The consolidation of the Omen Series Enūma Anu Enlil was achieved circa 1100 BCE. (The text was never actually 'fixed.') The star list (and their Paths) of the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil, after Reiner/Pingree Babylonian Planetary Omens 2 (1981).
(6) Circa 1000 BCE the tabular form of the "three stars each" star calendars ("Astrolabes"). (The circular astrolabes preceded the list astrolabes.)
(7) Circa 1000 BCE the list of 71 stars of the "3 ways" - path of Ea, path of Anu, path of Enlil - of the Mul.Apin series. Note: The Mul.Apin list and the "Astrolabes" have 24 constellations in common. The Mul.Apin series does not completely abandon the earlier tradition of 36 stars that serves as the basis for the "three stars each" star calendars ("Astrolabes").
Appendix 12: Star Names and Constellations Mentioned in The Prayer to the Gods of the Night (AO 6769 and Erm. 15642)
AO 6769 preserves one of two of the earliest examples of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night. The prayer is addressed to the nocturnal stars and constellations. Though preserved on a Middle Babylonian copy (from Uruk-Warka) the text is dated to the Old Babylonian Period circa 1700 BCE. Most of the 10 stars / planets / constellations listed are on or near the ecliptic. The Prayer to the Gods of the Night is the earliest surviving evidence of a 10-star tradition (i.e., 10 stars are assigned to the 12 months of the year). (See also: "Another Old Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night" by Wayne Horowitz and Nathan Wasserman (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 48, 1996, Pages 57-60), for a discussion of a 3rd version of the prayer on a tablet that is probably from Sippar.) Of the 3 copies of likely early versions of the text of the prayer one or more of the tablets are likely Middle Babylonian copies of Old Babylonian originals.
Another prayer/haruspicy also identifies as a "god of the night": the goddess Ninsiana, as the planet Venus in
the planet's male manifestation. Also identified in a text as "gods of the night" are mulNe-bi-ru (usually a name of Jupiter), Orion, Ursa Major, the Kidney Star, the Boar Star, Dilgan, Musirkesda, and also Sulpae. (Some commentators believe that Nebiru originally meant a constellation in or near Libra.)
10-Star Text/Version (AO 6769):
1. the god Girra (Fire God) [Note: = Mercury? / Mars?. The astral identity of the Old Babylonian constellation Girra is uncertain (= Sirius?). Girra the Fire God is both a son of Anu and also a constellation in Girra and Elamatum. In Babylonian uranography Sirius is also identified with the constellation of the Arrow.]
2. the god Erra [Note: The astral identity of the Old Babylonian constellation Erra is uncertain (= Mars?). Erra is a god of the nether world.]
3. the Bow [Note = A constellation or the star Sirius?]
4. the Yoke [Note: Approximately our Boötes (or Arcturus?).]
5. the True Shepherd of Anu [Note: = Orion.]
6. the Dragon [Note: The mythical snake-dragon was the sacred animal (symbol) of Marduk. The Dragon is one of two 'serpent' constellations listed. mušhuššum (Akkadian loan-word of Sumerian MUŠ.HUŠ). An unidentified constellation (= the large circumpolar constellation Draco?). mušhuššum (mušhuššum-dragon) was a 'furious snake' or 'aweful snake': "The Snake"/"The Serpent" (= 'Snake-Dragon' or 'Serpent-Dragon' (Horned-Serpent) of the god Marduk). The god Marduk was associated with snakes.]
7. the Wagon [Note: = Ursa Major (specifically 'Big Dipper' asterism).]
8. the She-Goat (= Goat Star) (= Lyra (or Vega?)
9. the Bison [Note: = Capricorn (or Ophiuchus / Serpens?). The stars comprising this constellation have not yet been reliably identified.]

10. the Horned-Serpent [Note: The sacred animal of Marduk. The symbolism of Babylonian snakes is different to that of dragons. bašmum was a mythical poisonous snake, a horned viper (a kind of serpentdragon or snake-dragon) possessing several tongues and jaws. Provisionally identified as a constellation north of Libra but also provisionally identified with Hydra. Hydra is a very long constellation - the largest in the sky - located in the region of the celestial equator.]
9-Star Text/Version (Erm. 15642):
ERM. 15642 preserves one of two of the earliest examples of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night. (The cuneiform tablet ERM. 15642 is in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum (Russia).) In this variant version published by the Russian assyriologist Woldemar (Vladimir) Shilejko, and also dated to the Old Babylonian Period circa 1700 BCE, the following 9 constellations are listed:
1. the god Girra
2. the god Erra
3. the Elamite Bow [Note: The Elamite Bow is not attested in later astronomical texts. (But the Bow does
appear in Mul.Apin with the descriptor: The Bow, the Elamite dIstar, the daughter of dEnlil)]
4. the Stars [Note: = Pleiades. Conceived of as the 'mane' of the constellation Taurus.]
5. the True Shepherd of Anu
6. the Dragon
7. the Wagon
8. the She-Goat
9. the Bison
In this version both the Yoke and the Horned-Serpent (Hydra) are omitted and the Pleiades (the Stars) included.
A translation of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (by F. J. Stephens) in Ancient Near Eastern Texts relating to the Old Testament edited by J. B. Pritchard (1950) lists the stars/constellations: (1) Gibil, (2) Irra, (3) Bow (star), (4) Yoke (star), (5) Pleiades, (6) Orion, (7) the Dragon, (8) Ursa Major, (9) Goat (star), and (10) the Bison. I am uncertain of the source text for the list until I can sight my copy of the book.
Appendix 13: The Star-List from Boghazköy (VAT 7445)
The tablet VAT 7445 (published in KUB, Volume 4, Number 47) recovered from Boghazköy (the capital of the Hittite empire) in the early 19th-century, preserves a Hittite prayer/haruspicy ritual (based on the Old Babylonian Period Prayer to the Gods of the Night) that enumerates 17 stars/constellations (belonging to the path of Ea). VAT 7445 is dated to circa 1300/1200 BCE.
1. a-ha-ti [= "Outside" (= Star/Constellation of the Outside) but W. G. Lambert proposes "Sister (of)." Franz Kugler had "Star of the Side" and identified part of Herculis.]
2. Ga-ga [A god.]
3. dDUMU.ZI [A god = Tammuz.]
4. dNin-ki-zi-da [Sumerian serpent god.]
5. E-pa-e
6. MUL.MUL ["The Stars" = The Pleiades.]

Appendix 14: The 10-Star Tradition and 30-Star Catalogue
When complete the star lists/catalogues of both HS 1897 (late 2nd-millennium (early middle period)) and, what is taken to be the reverse of, BM 55502 (late middle period) list only 30 stars (i.e., 3 x 10; 10 stars in each of the 3 paths of the sky - Enlil, Anu, and Ea. (What is taken to be the obverse of BM 55502 lists 36 rising and setting stars matching Astrolabe B, Section 4 (and parallels).) The use of 30 stars of Enlil, Anu, and Ea would appear to show a 2nd-millennium BCE tradition of listing stars in groups of 10 in each of the paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea. These would be important - not monthly - stars for each of the 3 stellar paths. They may have been used to help define the limits of the 3 stellar paths.
The Prayer to the Gods of the Night is the earliest surviving evidence of a 10-star tradition. The 10-star version of the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (preserved on tablet AO 6769) matches the Sumerian version of the bilingual menology in Astrolabe B, Section 1. In 10 of the 12 months the first item noted in the Sumerian-language version of the menology is the month-star for that month.
BM 55502 demonstrates a knowledge of both 30-star and 36-star traditions existing alongside each other for nearly 1000 years.
This scheme was later replaced by a scheme of 12 stars for each of the three paths of the sky (3 x 12 = 36). (One star for each country/path and each month. The paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil perhaps derive from the stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru.) However, the 30-star tradition scheme existed alongside the later 36-star scheme for circa the millennium between HS 1897 and BM 55502.
The late mention of the 30-star tradition in the 1st-century BCE writings of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus is likely a garbled form of the 30-star tradition in Babylonia.
Appendix 15: Star Names and Constellations Mentioned in Hilprecht's Nippur Text (HS 229 now HS 245)
Based on the discussion of tablet HS 245 in Science Awakening II: The Birth of Astronomy by Bartel van der Waerden. This tablet (setting out an illustrative example for a school mathematical problem-solving text) dates to the Kassite Period (1530-1160 BCE) and the tablet is specifically dated between 1300-1000 BCE. Though purporting to measure distances in the sky The Hilprecht Text preserves preserves part of a mathematical exercise text concerning astronomical distances rather than a serious attempt to investigate distances between stars.
1. MUL.MUL [mul.mul] (the Pleiades)

2. SIBA.AN.NA [sipa.an.na] (Orion)
3. KAK.TAG.GA [kak.tag.ga] (Sirius?)
4. star SHU.PA [šu.pa] (Boötes (Arcturus))
5. star BAN [pan] (the "bow" consisting of δ Canis Maioris and neighbouring stars)
6. star GIR.TAB [gír.tab] (Scorpio)
7. AN.TA.GUB (the "Outermost")
Appendix 16: Language Used to Record Star-Names in Mesopotamian Texts
According to Wayne Horowitz it was common practice in 1st-millennium BCE astronomical texts to write star-names with Sumerograms. Akkadian syllabic writings of star-names are rare in the 1st-millennium BCE.
As examples: (1) The reverse of Sm. 162 preserves a geometric drawing followed by 13 lines of text divided into 2 sections. The reverse of Sm. 162 preserves 5 star-names, some in syllabic Akkadian. In Sm. 162 4 of the 7 star-names are written in syllabic Akkadian. (2) In the Prayer to the Gods of the Night (K 3507; 1stmillennium BCE), 7 of the 8 preserved star-names are written with Sumerograms. (3) The Akkadian portion of the bilingual hemerology on the Middle-Assyrian Astrolabe tablet KAV 218 (Astrolabe B) preserves 6 of 7 star-names with syllabic Akkadian script. (4) Only 6 star-names are written in syllabic Akkadian in all of the 2-tablet series Mul.Apin.
Appendix 17: Egyptian Decan System Unrelated to Babylonian system of the "Three Stars Each"
The system of Egyptian decans did not originate in the Babylonian astral system. There were two systems of decanal stars. The first (and original) system (Old Kingdom period, circa 2800 BCE) used heliacal risings. The second (and later) system used meridian transits (New Kingdom period, circa 1500 BCE). The original system of Egyptian decan stars independently established during the Old Kingdom period were a set of 36 rising stars/asterisms along a single linear star path likely south of the ecliptic. The Babylonian Enuma Elish/Astrolabe/Mul.Apin system of 3 x 12 stars dates to the late 2nd-millennium BCE. The later Babylonian system comprised what may be termed an 'equatorial' system of 3 bands with 12 stars in each band. It is indicated that in the developing Babylonian uranography constellations came and went before the scheme eventually became fixed.

8: Babylonian Mul.Apin series
Copyright © Gary D. Thompson
WA 86378 [now BM 86378]. Mul.Apin tablet 1 (obverse side and reverse side) in the British Museum, London. (The tablet, the most complete surviving copy, is 8.4 cm high and is considered to be a masterpiece of miniature cuneiform writing.) The modern reconstruction of the Mul.Apin series was accomplished by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (Mul.Apin: An Astronomical Compendium in Cuneiform (1989)). The broad astronomical content and significance of the (two-tablet) Mul.Apin series had been identified by the English assyriologists Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet in a journal article published in 1880. The first part of the Mul.Apin series to be published (transcribed but not translated) was BM 86378 in Cuneiform
Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum: Part XXXIII (Plates 1-8) by Leonard King (1912). This tablet is almost complete copy of tablet 1. (No complete text of Mul.Apin has survived. However, it has been reconstructed from fragments. Hunger and Pingree used 41 exemplars for their edition of the text.) See also "A Neo-Babylonian Astronomical Treatise in the British Museum and its Bearing on the Age of Babylonian Astronomy." by Leonard King (Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology, Volume 35, 1913). This article by the English assyriologist Leonard King drew attention to the importance of this text for identifying the Babylonian constellations. In the next two years numerous articles and books appeared that utilised its star list information in the attempt to identify the Babylonian constellations and the stars that comprised such. The astronomical compendium Mul.Apin is an astronomical anthology of materials drawn from more than one original source.

Note: Based on the recent study by Hunger/Steele I have changed (16-8-2018) the header from Assyrian Mul.Apin series to Babylonian Mul.Apin series. "Our conclusion must therefore be rather unsatisfactory: We simply do not know when MUL.APIN was composed. ... We similarly have no definite evidence for the place of composition of the text, although there are enough hints in the text to point towards a Babylonian rather than an Assyrian origin. ... We therefore lean towards a Babylonian rather than an Assyrian origin for the work. In conclusion, therefore, it seems likely that MUL.APIN was composed sometime in the late second or (more likely) early in the first millennium BC in Babylonia." (MUL.APIN by Hunger/Steele (2018, Pages 18-19).)
The 2 tablet text known as Mul.Apin was the most widely copied work in the astral sciences written in ancient Mesopotamia. It was the most important work of early Babylonian astronomy. It also provided the foundation for many later 'schematic astronomy' (= schemes describing recurring astronomical events) texts. Mul.Apin contains a concise and organised collection of astronomical material covering all of the main topics that were the subject of Babylonian astronomical concern in the 2nd-millennium and early 1stmillennium BCE. The text of Mul.Apin is divided into sections that are separated from one another by horizontal rulings. It has been thought that Mul.Apin is a compilation of texts but the consistency between sections is evidence against this conclusion. Also, no examples of earlier texts containing exact parallels to sections of Mul.Apin are known. The Three Stars Each, Enūma Anu Enlil, and Mul.Apin present a quite coherent overview of early Babylonian astronomy. These astronomical texts are primarily descriptive rather than providing procedures for making astronomical calculations. The description of astronomical phenomena is not primarily empirical. Knowledge of observed astronomical phenomena was combined with simple mathematical models to provide a coherent schematised model. Mul.Apin was not used to calculate astronomical phenomena in the context of making astronomical predictions. Rather, it provided an ideal that could be compared with observed reality purely for divinatory purposes. Mul.Apin was a well-known standard text by the period of the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal. There were numerous texts containing lists of stars/constellations that circulated during the neo-Assyrian period. However, the lists of stars/constellations in Mul.Apin are indicated as the most important and influential. (The content of this paragraph owes to Mul.Apin by Hunger/Steele (2018).)
MUL.APIN (mul.apin) is the conventional title given to a Babylonian compendium that deals with diverse aspects of Babylonian descriptive astronomy (and astrology). The Mul.Apin series is a compendium of star lists and schematic methods of calculating astronomical phenomena. The text has been preserved best on a pair of tablets - the earliest copies of the text so far discovered - dated to the 7th-century BCE. (The majority of assyriologists believe that the Mul.Apin material was originally compiled around 1000 BCE. However, some assyriologists suggest a date of circa 1200 BCE. Modern scholarship considers Mul.Apin to be Babylonian in origin - an original single author text dating to the late 2nd-millennium BCE. (See: Mul.Apin by Hunger/Steele, 2018). The latest copies of Mul-Apin are currently dated to circa 300 BCE.) (Mul.Apin may only have reached its final form circa the 8th-century BCE. However, texts recovered show remarkable consistency rather than versions.) The text is named for the incipit (the opening words of the text),
corresponding to the first constellation of the year, MULAPIN "Plough," the modern identification being the stars Triangulum and Gamma Andromedae. Mul.Apin belongs to the tradition of the earlier star catalogues, the so-called Three Stars Each ('Astrolabe') lists, but represents an expanded version based on more accurate observation, and inclusion of more descriptive information. On statistical grounds the American Astrophysicist Bradley Schaefer believes that the material compiled in the tablets dates to circa 1370 BCE and the region of Assur. The 1st tablet of the series is the most important resource for any potential reconstruction of Babylonian uranography as its various sections locate the constellations in relation to each other and to the calendar. The 2nd tablet of the series is of greater interest to historians of science as it provides many of the methods and procedures used by Babylonian astrologers of that early period to predict the movements of the sun, moon and planets as well as the various methods used to regulate the ideal (schematic) calendar.
This principal copy of tablet 1 (WA 86378 [now BM 86378]) probably dates to circa 500 BCE and is a late Babylonian copy of tablet 1 of the astronomical compendium Mul.Apin. The earliest copies were recovered from the royal archives of the Assyrian King Assurbanipal (667-626 BCE) in Nineveh (and also from Assur). The Mul.Apin series contains the most comprehensive surviving star/constellation catalogue. It is largely devoted to describing the risings and settings of constellations/stars in relation to the schematic calendar of twelve 30-day months. Tablet 1 is an important source for an attempted reconstruction of Babylonian

uranography. Tablet 2 sets out methods and procedures to help predict the movements of the sun, moon, and planets, and regulate the calendar.
The text of tablet 1 was able to be completely restored with the aid of five copies - one dated to the NeoBabylonian Period, two from Assurbanipal's library (hence written before 612 BCE), and two from Assur.
The principal copy of the second tablet is VAT 9412 from Assur, dated 687 BCE. (This is the oldest of the texts.) Multiple copies of tablet 2 are known: principally 3 from Assur, 3 from Assurbanipal's library, and 1 dated to the Neo-Babylonian period.
In its standard form Mul.Apin is written on 2 clay tablets and is comprised of almost 400 lines of cuneiform text. Each tablet contains 4 columns with about 50 lines of text per column. The text of Mul.Apin is divided into a number of sections and subsections, usually marked by horizontal dividing lines by the scribes. There are also texts of Mul.Apin in which the two tablets are combined in one large tablet. The connection of a third tablet to the Mul.Apin series, by some modern commentators, was probably only an occasionally added (explanatory) appendix to Mul.Apin. (But see the brief discussion in Mul.Apin by Hunger/Jones (2018).)
Many copies of Mul.Apin texts exist from across the entire Neo-Assyrian Period, and it was still being recopied as late as the Seleucid Era.
Alexander Jones (Mul.Apin, 2018): "Mul.Apin is the earliest surviving general work on astronomy in which a wide range of theoretical and practical information relating to the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets is presented."
The Mul.Apin series (the name being derived from its opening words) is obviously a compilation (concise summary) of nearly all astronomical knowledge of the period before 700 BCE. Some statements in the Mul.Apin text (i.e., stars in the paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea appear in other, much earlier, cuneiform texts; the astrolabes and in the omens of Enuma, Anu, Enlil. Mul.Apin is the first reasonably full exposition of the knowledge developed within the almost millennium-old written tradition of cuneiform astronomical and astral omen texts. Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz (Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Treatise MUL.APIN (2011)) state (Pages ?-175): "The consolidation of the MUL.APIN text marks the emergence of a formal written astronomical science. ... MUL.APIN may not represent fully developed science, but it does offer a unique, even vital, window onto its beginnings, and the dynamic, reflective processes involved in the emergence of a formal written science." Also (Page 174): "The observational science of MUL.APIN appears to occupy a pivotal role in the development of the late, more sophisticated mathematical-astronomy of the ACT [Astronomical Cuneiform Texts] tradition."
The content of Mul.Apin was likely assembled from component material that existed independently prior to being assembled together in the Mul.Apin series. There is lack of evidence to determine the nature of the historical process leading to the composition/establishment of the Mul.Apin text. It is generally agreed Mul.Apin represents a cumulative body of astronomical knowledge (with some data originating in the late 2nd-millennium BCE) organised in a systematic manner. Because the Mul.Apin series is most a compilation from various sources no single date is assignable.) It is difficult to identify the history of the text or the sources for its parts. However, it is reasonably certain the origin of the Mul.Apin series dates to the Assyrian Period circa 1000 BCE. (Component parts of Mul.Apin date at least to the early first millennium BCE.) The Mul.Apin series contain improvements to the older astrolabe lists of the stars of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. Various facts make a Babylonian origin of the series probable. Everything that is known about the astronomy of this period is in some way related to the series Mul.Apin. The Mul.Apin series follows the "astrolabe" system (i.e., "three stars each" calendrical system) very closely, but at the same time, it also makes some substantial improvements.
According to Wayne Horowitz, the Mul.Apin series was likely edited in Babylonia rather than in Assyria.
The Mul.Apin text includes star lists (catalogues), detailed descriptions of lunar, solar, stellar, and planetary phenomena, observational science (observations (the seasons, diurnal (night and day) events in the different seasons), measurements (gnomon tables), calculations (the calculation of leap years)), and predictions of weather and human events (omens, and astrological and mythological material). All the information is presented without accompanying explanative text.

A systematic organisation of the Babylonian constellations appears in the the Astrolabes (but is limited to 36 'month stars') and also more extensively the Mul.Apin series (which lists nearly double the number of constellations).
Mul.Apin is essentially a series of structured lists grouped into 18 sections. (It is a compilation of short texts on a variety of astronomical matters.) Each of the various component sections of Mul.Apin relates to a different set of observable or measurable astronomical phenomena.
Tablet 1 basically contains eight sections (including five star lists):
(1) a list of 33 stars in the Path of Anu, 23 stars in the Path of Enlil, and 15 stars in the Path of Ea;
(2) a sequential list of (Morning Rising) dates in the ideal calendar (i.e., based on a year comprised of 12 months of 30 days each) on which 36 fixed stars and constellations rose heliacally;
(3) a list of simultaneously rising and setting constellations;
(4) time intervals (periodicity) between the Morning Rising dates of some selected stars;
(5) the visibility of the fixed stars in the East and the West;
(6) a list of 14 ziqpu-stars (i.e., stars which culminate overhead as more fundamental stars helically rise) [May be deemed secondary stars.];
(7) the relation between the culmination of zipqu-stars and their Morning Rising; and
(8) a list of stars and planets in the path of the moon. (The beginning of the second tablet continues the listing of (8) in tablet 1.)
Tablet 2 basically has ten sections dealing with:
(9) the path of the sun and the planets and the path of the moon;
(10) Sirius data (rising dates) relating to the equinoxes and solstices;
(11) the heliacal risings of some further fixed stars, wind directions;
(12) data relating to the five planets (i.e., the planetary periods);
(13) the four corners of the sky;
(14) the astronomical seasons (i.e., the sun's risings on the eastern horizon on the days of the solstices and equinoxes);
(15) Babylonian intercalary practice (i.e., a scheme (actually two schemes) of intercalary months);
(16) gnomon tables detailing shadow lengths and water clock data (i.e., weights of water for their clocks) [A list showing, by mathematical calculations, when the shadow of a gnomon (vertical rod) one cubit high is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, cubits long at various seasons.];
(17) the length of a night watch on the 1st and 15th day of the month, tables of the period of the moon's visibility (Rules for calculating the rising and setting of the moon.); and
(18) astral omens connected with fixed stars and comets.
A list of 17/18 stars/asterisms in the path of the moon is given. A statement that the Sun, Moon, and five planets were considered to move on the same path also appears. Reports of lunar eclipses dating from the 7th-century BCE are also recorded.

The fixed star comprise a dominate feature of Mul.Apin. The Mul.Apin series contains the earliest (surviving) full description of the Mesopotamian constellations. Its detailed constellation material dates to the late 2nd-millennium BCE possibly relates to the Mesopotamian constellations being largely formalised around the time of the completion of the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil.
The data contained in the Mul.Apin series is not quantifiable (i.e., precisely defined) and appropriate assumptions are required to be made (i.e., of the stars forming each constellation and which of these stars were listed to rise heliacally). In a Hastro-L posting (June 5, 2007) the assyriologist Hermann Hunger explained: "The tablets contain no observations. They state on which calendar date certain phenomena (mostly risings and settings) are supposed to occur. Since that calendar used real lunar months, and years consisting of either 12 or 13 such months, the date of a stellar rising, e.g., cannot occur on the same date each year. Assuming that the dates given in the text are the result of averaging, one can use them as if they were observations."
Analysing all of the star list data in the Mul.Apin series the American astronomer Brad Schaefer has concluded (2007) that the epoch for the data comprising Mul.Apin star lists is 1370 ± 100 BCE with a latitude of 35° ± 1.2°. The actual observations to establish the data through averaging were obviously a little earlier. This corresponds with the cuneiform evidence (the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil, the astrolabes (i.e., star calendars), the creation epic Enuma Elish) indicating that most of the Mesopotamian constellation set was established during the late 2nd millennium BCE.
The older types of astronomical information (i.e., star lists) appears in the early sections of the canonical Mul.Apin text. Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz (Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Treatise MUL.APIN (2011)) state (Page 171): "The sequence of sections in MUL.APIN, on our view, ... parallels the history of the development of ancient Mesopotamian astronomical texts, starting with lists and ending with procedural instructions."
According to the noted assyriologist Francesca Rochberg, Mul.Apin comprises an 'itinerary' of the heavenly region in the form of a practical astronomy. A function of Mul.Apin is to 'map' major celestial objects, their locations on certain 'paths' designated in the sky, and their relative positions. A practical astronomy enabling an understanding of the natural environment and a means of 'control' over the environment (i.e., rules of prediction relevant to a schematic fixed calendar). Mul.Apin does not contain technical mathematical astronomy that is typical of the later Persian and Hellenistic periods in Babylonia.
The Mul.Apin series is usually considered to be "astronomical" (an "astronomical compendium") with the primary aim of regulating the luni-solar year. However, many of the stars/constellations listed appear to be out of order. David Brown (Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology (2000, Page 116)) suggests this "may be because the star lists were never intended accurately to reflect reality." The star-lists reflect divinatory purposes. Tradition and divinatory purpose often determines content rather than a strict observance to observed fact. The dates given in Mul.Apin for heliacal risings of stars - though ultimately observation-based - were produced artificially.
The inclusion of an anthology of 47 celestial omens (drawn from a variety of Mesopotamian celestial divination texts) at the end of the Mul.Apin series suggests its goal was to serve as an introduction to celestial omen literature and the practice of celestial divination. The data contained in the Mul.Apin series was functionally important in the practice of celestial divination in Mesopotamia. The intended audience for the text would have been scribes receiving practical training in celestial divination. (See: "Teaching the Stars in Mesopotamia and the Hellenistic Worlds." by Jeffrey Cooley (Humanitas, Volume 28, Issue 3, Spring, 2005, Pages 9-15). Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz (Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Treatise MUL.APIN (2011)) state (Page 170): "MUL.APIN provides the methods and procedures which underlie the raw observations and astrological interpretations of the Neo-Assyrian royal astronomers, which are preserved for us in letters and reports to the Assyrian king ...." The Mul.Apin series is a compendium of numerous sources. It does not introduce new scientific ideas or given sufficient information to be regarded as a real astronomical series. It evidently served an astral divination purpose.
During the late 2nd-millennium BCE the astronomical knowledge summarised in the Mul.Apin series had spread to the Middle East, Greece, Iran and India. It was the Mul.Apin series that formed the basis for interrelatedness between astronomical systems in these regions outside Mesopotamia.

Mul.Apin only survives in late copies. It was obviously a text that was thought worthy of preserving. However, it is not known whether it fully reflects the astronomy and celestial divination of the period before circa 750 BCE. It is unknown whether the way Mul.Apin was used in the late period differs from how it was originally used, when first compiled circa 1000 BCE or earlier.
"It is only in the 2nd millennium BCE that texts appear which are dealing with phenomena in the sky. In these texts we see a desire to find out how the skies are organised, and a belief that this organization can be understood and described in relatively simple ways. The use of observation is limited: while obviously one must look at the sky to be able to say something about it, schematic approaches were predominant .... An example for this are the so-called Three-stars-each texts which probably go back to between 1500 and 1000 BCE. They list, for each month of the Babylonian calendar, three constellations which are supposed to become visible in this month: one constellation to the North, one near the equator [there is no word for equator in these texts], and one to the South; it is furthermore stated that the same constellations disappear again after six months. This gives a neat scheme of 36 constellations from whose risings one could tell the time of year. However, it would not work in practice: first of all, the period of visibility is different for stars depending on their declination; it is simply incorrect to assign all of them a visibility of six months. Then, the Babylonian calendar is not easily attuned to the solar year so that helical risings of stars will not stay in the same month every year. And, just to indicate that we are far from a secure interpretation, the lists also include planets, which are subject to entirely different visibility conditions, independent of the time of the year; finally there are even variant forms of the list which have only ten constellations - instead of 12 - which makes an alignment with the months of the year impossible. The Three-stars-each lists may be seen as attempts to organise what is known about stars. At about the same time an astronomical text was compiled, called Mul-Apin (which means Plough star) after its first word. It is only attested on tablets from the 7th century [BCE] onwards, but probably goes back to the 13th century BCE." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and society." In: Valls-Gabaud, D. and Boksenberg, A. (Editors). The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture. Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Pages 62-33).)
Note 1: Some differences between the "Astrolabes" and Mul.Apin include: (1) The Mul.Apin star-catalogue listing of 71 stars exceeds the 36 month-stars of the Astrolabes and indicates the stars listed in the Mul.Apin star-catalogue are not simply used as month-stars (but must serve another purpose). Wayne Horowitz states (1998, Page 169) that it is apparent from the descriptor identifications given for stars in the first section of Mul.Apin 1 that one of the functions of the star-catalogue was to help locate important stars at nighttime; and intended to define the borders of the 3 stellar paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. (2) The stars listed in section 1 of
Mul.Apin 1 and the "Astrolabes" are placed in different stellar paths in Mul.Apin. As example: muliku ("the field") the first Ea-star in Astrolabe B is the first Anu-star in Mul.Apin.
Note 2: The Mul.Aping series does not completely discard the earlier 36 star usage by the Astrolabes. They are encompassed in the Mul.Apin star lists. The Mul.Apin related CT 33 9 text, a Neo-Assyrian astronomical tablet recovered from Aššurbanipal's library preserves star-lists for the paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea per the Astrolabe genre. The 28 stars listed on the damaged text indicates that when complete it listed 12 stars for each stellar path. According to Wayne Horowitz (1998, Page 174) the 1st-millennium BCE tablet: "... CT 33 appears to represent a Neo-Assyrian attempt to update the astronomical information in the "Astrolabes" on the basis of Mul.Apin, while preserving the "Astrolabe" format. Also, the star list in the damaged tablet N.V. 10 (from Nineveh, now in Istanbul) is similar to CT 33 9. See: V. Donbaz and J. Koch, "Ein Astrolab der dritten Generation: NV. 10" (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 47, 1995, Pages 63-84). It is identified by the authors (specifically Koch) as a "third generation" Astrolabe. Three constellations, one for each of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, are listed for each of the 12 months. A list of 36 stars of Elam, Akkad, and Amurru in The Great Star List (a cuneiform astrological work dating to the Neo-Babylonian (Chaldean) Period (626-539 BCE)) is indicated as being related directly to the Astrolabe genre.
Note 3: Ziqpu-stars were stars "so chosen that one crosses the meridian before dawn, in the middle of each month, as another constellation is rising heliacally." (See: Mul.Apin by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1989) Page 142.) The ziqpu-stars were useful if, for whatever reason, the eastern horizon was obscured and the heliacal rising of important stars was unable to be directly observed. The most common version of the ziqpu-star list contained 25 stars. The use of ziqpu stars for measurement can be described in terms of the measurement of the positions of 3 stars: 'star a' at the apex of the sky (ziqpu point), 'star b' at halfway point between east horizon or west horizon and apex of the sky, and 'star c' at the east horizon or west horizon.

Appendix 2: The Identification of the Mul.Apin Series Star Catalogue by Hunger/Pingree
The primary focus of Mul.Apin is calendric. The fixed-star catalog of Mul.Apin contains 60 rising and setting stars/constellations, 6 circumpolar stars/constellations, and 5 planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). (Hunger and Pingree (1989) propose that the original Mul.Apin star-catalogue contained only 60 rising and setting stars/constellations.) The stars/constellations are arranged into 3 groups according to the 3 "Paths" on which they supposedly rise and set. The Path of Enlil is to the north, the Path of Anu is in the centre, and the Path of Ea is to the south. These Paths are only roughly demarcated bands. The Enlil stars are listed first, the Anu stars are listed next, and the Ea stars are listed last (see: CT XXXIII Plate 9). There are 33 stars in the Path of Enlil (tablet 1, column 1, lines 1-39), 23 stars in the Path of Anu (tablet 1, column 1, lines 39-44 & column 2, lines 1-18), and 15 stars in the Path of Ea (tablet 1, column 2, lines 19-35). Hunger/Pingree (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia) date the Mul.Apin series to circa 1000 BCE but also allow that some parts comprising the compendium may be earlier (i.e., circa 1200/1100 BCE). Mul.Apin does not completely abandon the "astrolabe" tradition of 36 month-stars (see: Mul.Apin tablet 1, Section 2, which lists 36 stars that heliacally rise consecutively over the course of the year. The following table relies heavily on Mul.Apin (1989) by Hunger/Pingree.

Appendix 3: The Mul.Apin list of (17/18) constellations/stars that marked the path of the Moon (See: Note 2 below)
The list begins with MUL.MUL (Pleiades) and concludes with mulLU.HUN.GA (Hired Man = (Greek) Aries). The list draws from SA2 by Bartel van der Waerden.
MUL.MUL [mul.mul] (= "The stars/the hair brush" (Pleiades).)
mulGUD.AN.NA [gu4.an.na] (The "Bull of Heaven [the bull of Anu];" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations. (Greek zodiac: Taurus (the Bull).)
mulSIPA.ZI.AN.NA [sipa.zi.an.na] (= "The true shepherd of Anu" (Orion).)
mulSHU.GI [su.gi] (= The old man (Perseus).)
mulGAM [mulZUBI] [zubi] (= The sickle sword [The hooked staff] (Auriga).)
mulMASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL [mash.tab.ba.gal.gal] (The "Great Twins;" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Gemini (the Twins).)
mulAL.LUL al.lul] (The "Crab;" [or Prokyon], later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Cancer (the Crab).) Note: In June 2015 I received a query regarding a possibly error in suggesting Procyon as part of an ancient constellation Cancer. Basically, "If the Greek constellation is Cancer and Cancer only, "Procyon" should say "Praesepe". If "Procyon" is correct, the Greek constellations would be Cancer and Canis Minor, because Procyon is the alpha star of Canis Minor." Some additional discussion is indicated as required. Part of the issue is the comparison is being made with early Greek constellations. There really is no exact identifications between Babylonian and later Greek constellations. The boundaries of the Babylonian constellations are not known. The Greek constellations and their boundaries only mostly became canonical with Eudoxus (there were later changes), but we do not know what the boundaries were until after the period of Aratus (circa 3rd-century BCE). Aratus does not mention Canis Minor in his Phainomena (but has Procyon among the weather signs). Until the 2nd-century BCE there is no evidence the Greeks recognised Canis Minor as a separate constellation/asterism. Ptolemy, in his Almagest catalogued only 2 stars comprising Canis Minor (1 being Procyon). The ancient Greek constellation boundaries generally lay beyond the visible stars. The article was written in the early 1990s and basically simplifies Bartel van der Waerden's 1952 article on the history of the zodiac. When writing the article I have begun considerations from 1952. Waerden has Procyon in his 1952 article and later book published 1974 in English. Werner Papke who I consider unreliable made the identification KAK.SI.DI = Procyon (not Sirius per Franz Kugler)) + AL.LUL = Sirius = Cancer. Ernst Weidner would have alluttu (crab) = Capricornus, not Cancer. Most have AL.LUL (= alluttu) = Cancer (crab). Most have NANGAR/NAGAR = Praesepe/Cancer,

especially Praesepe. Some consider AL.LUL = allutu is likely but not suitably demonstrated, but the later NANGAR/NAGAR as suitably demonstrated. The conclusion that AL.LUL (Sumerian logogram) and alluttu (Akkadian) = Praesepe = (in) Cancer is still recent. Hunger and Pingree in Astral Sciences (1999) have other identifications (i.e., some particular stars in Cancer). Gennadij Kurtik and Alexander Militarev (2005) have:
(1) for mulal.lul (mulal.lub) 'crayfish' or 'crab,' located in the area of modern Cancer; and (2) late use of NAGAR as name of constellation and zodiacal sign Cancer. Wayne Horowitz in his 2014 book on Babylonian "Astrolabes" has alluttu = Cancer.
mulUR.GU.LA [ur.gu.la] (The "Lion;" [or Lioness], later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Leo (the Lion).)
mulAB.SIN [ab.sin] (The "Furrow [The barley-stalk];" [or Spica], later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Virgo (the Virgin).)
mulZIB.BA.AN.NA [zi-ba-ni-tum] (The "Scales of Heaven [The balance];" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: originally "the Claws" (of the Scorpion) but the Romans later (re)introduced Libra (the Scales).)
mulGIR.TAB [gir.tab] (The "Scorpion;" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Scorpius (the Scorpion).)
mulPA.BIL.SAG [pa.bil.sag] (The "Grandfather [Pabilsag (a god)];" [archer?], later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Sagittaurius (the Archer).)
mulSUHUR.MASH [suhur.mas.ku6] (The "Goat fish;" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Capricornus (the Goat).)
mulGU.LA [gu.la] (The "Great One [The giant/the great star?];" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Aquarius (the Water-Carrier).)
mulZIBBATI.MESH [mulKUN.MESH] [kun.mes] (= The tails (Pisces).)
mulSIM.MAH [sim.mah] (The "Great Swallow (SW Pisces [+ epsilon Pegasi);" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Pisces (the Fish).)
mulA.NU.TI.TUM [a-nu-ni-tum] (= Anunitum (a goddess) (NE Pisces (+ middle part of Andromeda)).)
mulLU.HUN.GA [lu.hung.ga] (The "Hired Man;" later to be one of the 12 ecliptic constellations.) (Greek zodiac: Aries (the Ram).)
Note 1: On the uncertainty of 17/18 constellations Bartel van der Waerden (Science Awakening II: The Birth of Astronomy, 1974, Page 80) states: "The number 18 is not quite certain, because the 'tails' zibbati.mesh are probably to be taken together with both the following names ('tails of SHIM.MAH and Anunitum').
Note 2: As the exact identification of Babylonian constellations is still under debate the modern constellations listed as equivalents can, at best, only be considered as partly identical to them. In writing the constellation/star names I have attempted to follow modern convention and give the usual constellation transliterations which variously appear in both capitals or normal (roman) script (conventionally used to indicate Sumerian logographic spelling) and italics (conventionally used to indicate Akkadian) and a mix of the two conventions indicating joint use of both scripts.
Appendix 4: Accuracy of Text Transmission
The recent doctoral thesis The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C.E. by Russell Hobson (2009) includes examination of Enuma Anu Enlil tablet 63 (the 'Venus Tablet') and the Mul.Apin series. Of interest is the concluding statement (Page 494) regarding the lack of stabilisation in the transmission of



2022. 02. 21. 19:46 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20180920001304/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-8.html 17/18
astronomical/omen cuneiform texts. The latter is interesting. Hobson's examination demonstrates persistent error-making by the trained scribal elite in copying cuneiform astronomical/omen texts. And this errormaking occurred over a relatively short period of time.
A tradition of oral transmission existed in Mesopotamia. (The numerous variants of popular myths is used as an argument for an oral tradition in Mesopotamia. A group of 'experts' and later, in the Neo-Assyrian period (circa 950-600 BCE), 'chief singers' is identified with oral tradition. It is accepted by a number of scholars that these persons would make slight changes. It appears that in Mesopotamia there was an early reliance/preference for scribes trained to accurately copy texts. According to The Cambridge History of the Bible (Volume 1, 1975, Page 40): "In Mesopotamia oral tradition played only a limited part in the transmission of literary texts after 2,700 B.C., the scribe using an oral source only when all else failed." It is quite evident that scribal tradition = variation and copyist errors. Even the text of the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil exhibits divergences and was not really fixed.
Appendix 5: Dating of Mul.Apin Data
It is not known with any exactness when Mul.Apin was originally compiled in cuneiform. It is known, however that it was copied many times.
David Pingree (1933-2005) believed that some parts of the Mul.Apin material dates to the 2nd-millennium BCE.
The Panbabylonist Werner Papke and his dating of Mul.Apin is worth mentioning. Werner Papke (born 1944 in Olsztyn, Poland) is a German historian of science and religion in antiquity and scholar of religion. His university studies encompassed biophysics, history of science, and Ancient Near Eastern Studies. In 1978 he received his PhD from the University of Tübingen with a controversial thesis on the MUL.APIN series. (Papke, Werner, Die Keilschriftserie MUL.APIN, Dokument wissenschaftlicher Astronomie im 3.
Jahrtausend, Dissertation, Tübingen, 1978. Papke states the aim of the study is to disprove the alleged late composition of the astronomical cuneiform series Mul.Apin.) Since 1983 Papke has worked at the Institute for the History of Science at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Since 1985 he has taught at the LudwigMaximilians-University Munich. He gained academic notoriety for his controversial book Die Sterne von Babylon (1989), where he gave an astronomical interpretation of the Epic of Gilgamesh. A recent supporter of Paple's ideas is Dieter Koch of Zürich, Der Stierkampf des Gilgamesch - Vom Ursprung menschlicher Kultur (2007). Papke's speculative theories, however, have not been found acceptance by specialists in Assyriology. This is especially so with his claims to date the Mul,Apin series to the 3rd-millennium BCE. This dating was critiqued by Johannes Koch. Papke's books are now self-published.
Werner Papke is similar to the Panbabylonist Peter Jensen in holding the entire Bible is based on Babylonian astral mythology. Papke interpreting the epic of Gilgamesh as an astronomical poem dating to the 3rdmilennium BCE dates back to the early Panbabylonists. Papke uses the Pleiades to interpret an early date for the Mul.Apin series. Though the Pleiades are stated in cuneiform texts to be in the Path of Anu, Papke places them in the Path of Enlil. See David Pingree's critical remarks on Papke's methodology and results in: "Zwei Plejaden-Schaltregeln." (Archiv für Orientforschung, Einunddreissiaster Band, 1984, Pages 70-71; Babylonian Planetary Omens, Part Two (with Erica Reiner), 1981, Page 6, Footnote 10; Mul.Apin (with Hermann Hunger), 1978, Pages 10-11).

Argues that information in the Mul.Apin series can be dated to the 3rd-millennium BCE. Unreliable because of how his argument is constructed.

The data contained in the Mul.Apin series is not quantifiable (i.e., precisely defined) and appropriate assumptions are required to be made (i.e., of the stars forming each constellation and which of these stars were listed to rise heliacally). In a Hastro-L posting (June 5, 2007) the assyriologist Hermann Hunger explained: "The tablets contain no observations. They state on which calendar date certain phenomena (mostly risings and settings) are supposed to occur. Since that calendar used real lunar months, and years consisting of either 12 or 13 such months, the date of a stellar rising, e.g., cannot occur on the same date each year. Assuming that the dates given in the text are the result of averaging, one can use them as if they were observations." The most recent informed attempt to use the data contained in the Mul.Apin series was carried out by the American astronomer Brad Schaefer. The Mul.Apin series collectively contains nearly 200 different 'idealised' astronomical observations, including measurements related to several constellations. This included the day each year that certain constellations first appeared in the dawn sky. These dates change over the millennia because of a tiny wobble in the Earth's axis. By studying these dates and other astronomical information, such as the dates certain constellations were directly overhead, Schaefer statistically determined the period involved. However, where historians had previously based their arguments on single stars or constellations on the tablets Schaefer's statistical analysis included of all the different data recorded on the tablets. By statistically analysing all of the star list data in the Mul.Apin series the American astronomer Brad Schaefer has concluded (2007) that the epoch for the data comprising Mul.Apin star lists is 1370 ± 100 BCE with a latitude of 35° ± 1.2°. The actual observations to establish the data through averaging were obviously a little earlier. Schaefer also determined that the ancient observers lived within roughly 100 kilometres of 35.1° North - an area that includes the ancient Assyrian cities of Niniveh (Nineveh) and Assur. The assyriologist Hermann Hunger has stated Schaefer's work will help settle a long-standing debate. The rough date of circa 1000 BCE for the tablets, that most historians have settled on, agrees rather well with Schaefer's analysis.
In 2007 the Dutch assyriologist and astronomer Teije de Jong published the results of his analysis of the date of the rising star lists (2) and (4) in Mul.Apin. Only those stars/constellations securely identified with known stars were used in the analysis. He concluded: (1) "The observations underlying the dates of the first appearance of stars and constellations in star list II and IV of MUL.APIN date from -1300 ± 150 BC." (2) "The observations were carried out in Babylon or at some other location with geographic latitude -32°." (See: de Jong, Teije. (2007). "Astronomical dating of the rising star list in MUL.APIN." (Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, Band 97, Pages 107-120).)

9: Late Babylonian (Neo-Assyrian) planisphere
Photograph of obverse of K 8538 on display in British Museum. The 8 zones contain dot-and-line diagrams of constellations, cuneiform labelling, and rows of repeated syllables.. The repeated syllables are possibly incantations. Johannes Koch (1989) has made the point that K 8538 is an instrument rather than an image. "The geometrical diagrams or figures within the sections apparently represent constellations, the lines in most cases joining or enclosing stars, their positions being indicated by large or small holes impressed in the surface of the clay; the triangular impressions possibly represent stars of a greater magnitude. Some of the notes which have been added by the scribe, give the names of the stars or constellations; other evidently refer to particular portions of the sphere, and in one place give measurement in figures. The majority of the diagrams are purely geometrical, but one, which is partly preserved and labelled ..., was possibly intended to represent a bird." (CT Part XXXIII, 1912, Page 6.)

The obverse of K 8538 (drawn by the British Assyriologist Leonard King (See CT 33, (1912), Plate 10) and corrected by Johannes Koch (1989)) in the British Museum, London. This neo-Assyrian star map (commonly referred to as a "planisphere" (the reproduction of a spherical surface as a flat map)) was recovered from the library of King Assurbanipal [Ashurbanipal] in Nineveh and dated to circa 800 BCE by early investigators. (The city of Nineveh was the last of the successive capitals of Assyria. At Kouyunjik/Nineveh though it is the tablet collection of the South-West Palace that formed Assurbanipal's [Ashurbanipal's] library (libraries), the tablets from the North Palace are also considered to belong to this library.) Johannes Koch has more recently (roughly) dated it to circa 650 BCE. It is a circle divided by radial lines into 8 equal 45-degree sectors. The 8 lines radiating from the centre of the circular tablet have the intention of defining eight equal stellar sectors of 45 degrees each. (First pointed out by Fritz Hommel.) Unfortunately considerable parts (comprising approximately 40%) of the planisphere are missing. Two large damaged (missing) areas account for most of the damage. This damage dates to the sack of Nineveh. It was partly vitrified in antiquity during the destruction of the place where it was found. (The planisphere was restored - quite heavily, using plaster - from fragments, hence its incompleteness. One description states the missing sectors were later restored by similarly coloured clay.) The reverse of the tablet is not inscribed. Some sources describe the restored tablet as approximately 18 centimetres in diameter; the British Museum describe it as: diameter 14.1 centimetres, thickness: 3.2 centimetres. It is on public display in Room 55 in the British Museum. K 8538 (also referred to, as least in early publications, as Astrolabe K) was one of the earliest cuneiform documents found at Nineveh by Austen Henry Layard. (It was recovered after a brief dig.) Constellations on the planisphere are identifiable by name or shape (schematic figures).

Source: Mesopotamian Archaeology by Percy Handcock (1912, Page 104).
K 8538 is the best preserved of 2 surviving planispheres. (K 8538 has been loosely known as an 'astrolabe' since its discovery. However, it is more correctly a planisphere. (The word planisphere (Latin planisferium) was first used in the 2nd-century by Ptolemy to describe the representation of a spherical Earth by a map drawn in the plane. This usage continued into the Renaissance. As example: Gerardus Mercator described his 1569 world map as a planisphere. The first star chart to have the name "planisphere" given to it (for describing the representation of the starry celestial sphere on the plane) was made in 1624 by Jacob Bartsch. Bartsch, the son-in-law of Johannes Kepler.) Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer's latitude; stars below the horizon are not included. The function of an 'astrolabe' is to 'depict' the entire sky over the course of a schematic (model) year. The exact purpose of K 8538 remains uncertain.) Star figures are found in 6 of the 8 sectors. God names are also written in addition to the star/constellation names. The tablet has always proved very difficult to to interpret. It is one of the very few known tablets which illustrates how the Assyrians (at least) depicted schematically the constellations (and constructed sky maps). For drawings of constellations see: VAT6448, VAT7847, and VAT 7851.
The tablet was catalogued and briefly described by the assyriologist Carl Bezold in his Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum (5 Volumes, 1889-1899; See: Volume 3, 1893, Page 937). The most detailed study of the tablet was the 1989 study by (the competent German amateur assyriologist) Johannes Koch in his book Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels (Chapters 7-16, Pages 56-113). He concluded it represents the night sky of 3-4 January 650 BCE over Nineveh. The constellations depicted would most likely be the principal constellations.
The planisphere K 8538 is a circular star map, divided into 8 equal 45-degree sectors, with star constellations depicted in addition to written constellation names, star names, and symbols. (Writing and diagrams appear in each of the sectors. Both so-called Sector 0 and Sector 1 have closed triangles.) The intact parts comprise (1) cuneiform writing naming stars and constellations, and (2) points and diagrams (the drawn shapes include arrows, triangles, intersecting lines, and an ellipse) comprising schematic drawings of 6 stars and constellations. The constellation(s) depicted in each sector are drawn as dots (representing stars) connected by lines.

Sector numbering from 0 to 7, following Koch (1989). Weidner (1915) (following Jeremias (1913) ?) numbered the sectors from 1 to 8. Where Koch has 0, Weidner has 8, otherwise their sector numbering matches. North is approximately at the
section depicting mulSipa-zi-an-na (= Orion) and south is approximately at the section depicting mulĂS-iku (Field = Pegasus square).
Constellation figures are identifiable in 6 of the 8 sectors (i.e., the 6 undamaged sectors). In addition to the figures, the constellations on the planisphere are identifiable by name or phrase. Following Ernst Weidner (1915) and Johannes Koch (1989) the sectors, and the stars and constellations shown and/or named, can be described/identified (counterclockwise) as: Sector 0 - sector (only a small section of which is destroyed) with arrow figure, the long arrow in Sector 0 is quite dominant, covering almost half of the Sector, Sirius (Arrow); Sector 1 - sector with figures of two triangles, Pegasus square + Andromeda (Field + Plough); Sector 2 - sector damaged, nothing identifiable; Sector 3 sector with ellipse containing triangles, the Pleiades + Taurus ("Jaw"); Sector 4 - sector with text at upper and lower part and in the middle a figure with pointed rod (not identifiable?), Gemini [also Orion]; Sector 5 - sector damaged and almost completely lost, Crater + Corvus + Virgo; Sector 6 - sector (a large section of which is destroyed) with scales (balance) figure, Libra + Centaurus; Sector 7 sector with small figures/text, magical incantations (?). Ernst Weidner was of the opinion that Sectors 3 and 4 (?) belonged together. John North (Cosmos, 2008, Page 47) gives the identification (starting with Sector 1 but not identifying the Sectors) as: Sirius [Sector 1], Pegasus, Andromeda (Field and Plough) [Sector 2], Aries [? see below], Pleiades [Sector 3], Gemini [Sector 4], Hydra [? see below], Corvus + Virgo [Sector 5], and Libra [Sector 6]. Not explicitly mentioned are Taurus and Orion. However, Aries would seem to be the "Hired Man" = figure holding pointed staff = Orion [Sector 4]. (But there is a mismatch as Aries and Orion are different constellations.) Hydra appears to be an error. Hydra is obviously a mistake for Hyades (= Jaw of the Bull) [Sector 3].

The following is reliant on Francesca Rochberg (2012) who has relied on Koch (1989). Beginning with Sector 0 and running counterclockwise. The arrow figure in Sector 0 is inscribed as Išhtar and Dumuzi. Koch's explanation is that because Išhtar is associated with the Bow Star, Dumuzi must be the Arrow. In Sector 1 there are 2 triangular figures. One is labelled mulIku,
"The Field," the other triangular figure is labelled mulApin, "The Plow." (It is interesting that the Pegasus-square (mul Aš-iku) formed by 4 bright stars is pictured in K 8538 as a triangle.) There is no star/constellation name(s) preserved in Sector 2. Sector 3 contains an ellipse with 2 enclosed wedges. Written in Sector 3 are the names mulIs lè, "The Jaws of the Bull," and
mulMUL, "Pleiades," and also Sipazianna, "Orion." (Note: Rochberg placing Orion in Sector 3 must be an error as Koch places Orion in Sector 4.) Sector 4 contains a figure with 3 dots (stars) in a row and a long pointer with a wedge shaped tip at the end, which is pointing directly to the middle/centre of the circle. Sector 4 contains the names of "The Twins who stand in front of Orion." Sector 4 also contains the divine name Lātarāk (a lion-headed minor god). Inside one of the small pointed figures on Sector 5 are the names Regulus, "The King," and Corvus, "The Crow." Inside another pointed figure on Sector 5 is the sign BE which Koch has identified with mulAB.SIN, "Libra." In Sector 6 a balance figure is inscribed with the name of
Libra, written mulGI.GI (= mulZI.BA.AN.NA = zibānitu). Rochberg does not discuss Sector 7. Ernst Weidner was of the opinion that Sector 7 contained numerous magicalformulas.
Thus the circular star map divides the night sky into 8 (equal) 45-degree sectors and illustrates the most prominent constellations.
Leonard Kings description of the "planisphere" in CT 33, (1912), Page 6, includes: "The planisphere is circular in shape, with a slightly rounded Reverse, the Obverse being flat and surrounded with a raised edge or rim; it has been partly vitrified and some parts are missing. The flat portion of the Obverse, within the rim, is evidently intended for the heavenly sphere, and is divided into eight equal sections. The geometrical diagrams or figures within the sections apparently represent constellations, the lines in most cases joining or enclosing stars, their positions being indicated by large of small holes impressed in the surface of the clay; the triangular impressions possibly represent stars of a greater magnitude. Some of the notes, which have been added by the scribe, give the names of the stars or constellations; others evidently refer to particular portions of the sphere, and in one place give measurements in figures. The majority of the diagrams are purely geometrical, but one, which is partly preserved and is labelled ..., was possibly intended to represent a bird."
The reason for a division of the celestial sky into 8 parts is unclear. However the number 8 was of considerable importance to the Babylonians. Ernst Weidner (HBA) thought the division into 8 sectors could simply go back to the symbol AN "sky" which in earliest times was an 8-pointed star. It may be that it was comprised of the four cardinal quadrants north, south, east and west, and the four midpoints of such. However, other reasons may exist. Cuneiform sources identify that Sargon II built 8 gates of the city of Babylon in 8 directions of the Winds. (See the illustration of the 8 gates and their names on page 46 of Nebuchadrezzer and Babylon by Donald Wiseman (1991).) In ancient Mesopotamia the number 8 had considerable significance. The practice of dividing celestial space into 8 sectors is held by some scholars to be quite old. (It was practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, India and China.) The depictions of Venus on kudurrus from the time of king Melishipak II (Cassite period, circa 1188-1174 BCE) are 8-pointed. Similarly, on kudurrus from the same period, the solar disk is depicted with four axis points and four solar rays intercalated. A later cuneiform tablet records the Assyrian king Sargon II (721-705 BCE) proclaiming that "in all the sides opposite to the eight winds, I opened eight great gates." The circular zodiac depicted on the fragment VAT 7851 (dated to circa 2nd-century BCE) is indicated is indicated as having an 8-zone division.
Li Xueqin (in a paper presented in 1992) has referred to physical evidence in the form of a Neolithic Chinese jade tablet for the antiquity of the conception that the heavens are round and divided into 8 parts.
Within Etruscan/Roman legendary tradition the dome of the night sky was divided into quadrants and further subdivided into 8 sectors. Each sector represented a potency of nature and a designation of a meaning of omens located there. (See: The Etruscans by Massimo Pallotinno (1955).)
As pointed out by Asia Haleem in her essay "The Iconography of Ancient Astronomy," the Panbabylonists offered another reason. A number of Panbabylonists believed a Venusian calendar was devised in Elam and Venus cycles used as the basis of the calendar. In his pamphlet, Das Venusjahr (1910) Ferdinand Bork held there was an ancient Elamite tradition of an 8-fold

https://web.archive.org/web/20210714081605/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-9.html 6/18
division of the year based on the synodic period of Venus. Bork attempted to show that there existed in ancient Elam a year that was determined by the synodical period of the planet Venus, and that this Venus-year was more ancient than the lunar [lunar-solar] year. This was not supported by Friedrich Hrozny in his pamphlet, Das Venusjahr und der elamische kalender (1911). Hrozny contended that the facts adduced by Bork were insufficient to prove that the Elamites had a Venus-year. In his book, Der Palaeozodiakus, die prähistorische Urform unseres Tierkreises (1912) F[?]. Röck claimed that an 8-division zodiac was earliest (and was used, for example, in Java). (See: American Journal of Archaeology (1912, Page 259 and 1913, Page 272.).)
Interestingly, the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz has mentioned that a tradition of dividing the starry sky into 7 parts is perhaps suggested by a passage in Šurpu (II 165–67): "May the stars of the south wind, north wind, east wind, and west wind, the seven winds, blow upon him and release his oath." In Mesopotamia, as in modern practice, the winds are named for the direction of their origin, not the direction in which they are blowing, i.e., a northwind blows from north to south.
The purpose of the planisphere is also unclear. In their 1880 study of the planisphere Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet concluded that it had largely an astrological and calendrical purpose. In his detailed 1915 study of the planisphere (in Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie) the Assyriologist Ernst Weidner concluded that it had both astronomical and astrological significance and was probably a magical tablet used in exorcisms. However, he remained puzzled about the sensible meaning of the repeating syllables along the 45 degree lines. However, they are still interpreted as comprising some form of astro-magical ritual (and possibly related to incantations). (Circular astronomical and astrological texts and diagrams exist. Circular astral-magic texts/diagrams should not be unexpected.) In A Guide to the Babylonian and Assyrian Antiquities (British Museum, 1922) K 8538 (likely following Weidner) is explained as "an astrological instrument for making astrological calculations and for casting nativities." Whatever the actual use, the circular star map illustrates the most prominent constellations.
Weidner made a study of 'planisphere' K 8538. He described it as one of the most mysterious Babylonian documents. He copied the text and published part of it in Babyloniaca, Volume VI, Page 157. A lengthy analysis and discussion forms part of Weidner's HBA. Weidner did rather accurately date it (or at least maintain the conventional dating) to circa 700 BCE, and that the 'planisphere' use is relevant to this date. Weidner sets out his conclusion that the document served the purposes of divination and sorcery, with the aid of astrology. The apparently pointless, multiple repeated syllables strung together are spells. Examples of such are already known and published by Carl Bezold (Catalogue IV), Alfred Jeremias (Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur, Page 110), and François Thureau-Dangin (RA, IX, Page 80; Text AO 5399 from the Old Babylonian period). The magic involves the frequent repetition of syllables. The constellations drawn are not in their correct order/relation to each other. That only a few important constellations are shown refutes the assumption of K 8538 as a sky map. The constellations and incantations appear in conjunction with each other. The assumption can be made that the formulas relate to astrologically important star positions (i.e., dawn, culmination, etc).
Weidner's 1915 study was the last serious study of K 8538 until the detailed 1989 study by Johannes Koch in his book Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels (Chapters 7-16). (In many respects the discussion by Koch supersedes those by Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet, and by Ernst Weidner.) Koch places K 8538 within the Mul.Apin tradition. He also identifies that it was used at Niniveh circa 650 BCE. Koch suggests that the disk should be rotated to a particular position for each sector, which then literally pictures the heliacal rising or setting of the constellations involved as they were visible above the horizon of Niniveh circa 650 BCE. (It facilitates a type of alignment system. This makes it an instrument. Ernst Weidner (HBA) wrote that the joining of various stars through lines made for easier orientation in the starry sky.) The results of Koch's explanation of K 8538 challenges a number of the traditional identifications of Babylonian constellations.
Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet believed that K 8538 was a star map. Ernst Weidner believed that it was a diviner's tool. Johannes Koch believed it was a star map having a practical purpose (i.e., assistive to naked-eye observation). Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell (see below) believe that it is a Sumerian period 'field note'! Asia Haleen ("The Ancient Theory of Correspondences." (2008)) finds agreement with Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet, that it had a calendrical purpose. Its design and use helped to estimate the start of the New Year/New YearFestival.
K 8538 is considered similar to a Neo-Babylonian (1st-millennium BCE) circular tablet from Sippar depicting a ziqpu-star planisphere. The planisphere is on the obverse of the circular tablet and a list of ziqpu-stars is on the reverse. Basically the Neo-Babylonian tablet from Sippar shows the ziqpu (i.e., zenith) stars (as dots) in a circular arrangement of 12 (equal) 30degree segments (marked by lines). (See: Horowitz, Wayne. and Al-Rawi, Farouk. (2001). "Tablets from the Sippar Library IX. A Ziqpu-Star Planisphere." (Iraq, Volume LXIII, Pages 171-181).) Within the genre of circular planispheres we have the examples: (1) "Three stars each" dating to the late 2nd-millennium BCE: Extant circular exemplars include: CT 33 11 (= Sm. 162) and CT 33 12 (= K. 14943 +); extant list (tabular) exemplars: KAV 218 (= VAT9461), LBAT 1499 (= 34713) and LBAT 1500 (= BM 34387). Also, BM 82923. This late 1st millennium BCE star catalogue preserves identification of Astrolabe month-stars; (2) A tablet perhaps depicting helically rising stars within key constellation figures, divided into 8 equal sectors: The sole exemplar being: K 8538 dating to the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE; and (3) A tablet depicting ziqpu-stars: A tablet dated to the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE depicting a ziqpu-star planisphere: The sole exemplar being: A NeoBabylonian (626/625-539 BCE) tablet from Sippar.
Appendix 1: A Recent Fantasy Interpretation of K 8538

An amount of often confused comment has been generated by the recent (apparently self-published) book A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event (2008) by Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell. The authors state it is the result of 8 years of research. Alan Bond is Managing Director of Reaction Engines Limited and Mark Hempsell is Senior Lecturer in Astronautics at the University of Bristol. The latter author holds that any criticism of the book is precluded until it is read. (This "mantra" is repeated in his more recent personal communication dated July 24. A suitable response would seem to be: Why don't you send out copies for people to read?) This argument for excluding criticism also precludes any support for the book until it is read. There seems to be a clear intention to ensure the book sells. The expectation that people will first purchase the book in order to be deemed to be able to review it simply turns the traditional process on its head. (I am not aware that the authors have submitted a copy of their book for critical review.) The co-author seems unfamiliar with the concept and function of the "executive summary" that is included as a part of book length reports. Sufficient information is available to comment on the claim by the co-authors that K 8538 records the path of a meteoroid/asteroid (over one kilometre in diameter) in space within one degree accuracy to reference stars to enable the co-authors to determine an atmospheric meteor path (trajectory) ending at Köfels. The co-authors claim the impact of the disintegrated meteor at Köfels resulted in a giant landslide five kilometres in diameter and 500 metres thick. Ignoring conventional dating Mark Hempsell also linked the back plume from the explosion to the destruction of the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. (According the science reporter Lewis Smith (The Times, March 31, 2008) the connection was explicitly made by Mark Hempsell. In his personal communication, July 28 Mark Hempsell agrees he gave this example "[W]ithout thinking through the implication ....") The traditional timeline of biblical chronology (placing Sodom and Gomorrah circa 1900 BCE) makes this assertion impossible. There is a complete lack of archaeological evidence for Sodom and Gomorrah. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is likely one of the many fictional stories that underpin the Old Testament books.
The British authors, both scientists (but not assyriologists or historians), claim to have successfully translated K 8538 as a copy of a Sumerian "night diary" record of an asteroid impact which in 3123 BCE hit Köfels, Austria. Note: K 8538 is not marked as a "regular observation" or similar. (The issue of copying is ignored by the British authors. In 2nd and 1st millennium BCE practice the so-called canonical texts were copied regularly - others, including astronomy texts, were not.) Just exactly how a supposed Sumerian skywatcher at night managed the feat of quickly recording exact details on the tablet of the trajectory of the supposed meteoroid/asteroid through the constellations is passed over. According to Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell the information on the path of the asteroid is in what is designated Sector 0 of the planisphere. The Sumerian/asteroid idea is little better than fantasy. There is no substantial evidence for a Sumerian system of constellations and star names. There is no evidence for any sophisticated Sumerian astronomy; especially the concept of Sumerian "astronomical diaries." It also needs to be reiterated that half of the face of K 8538 is missing (i.e., has been obliterated). Also, there is no text on the tablet stating it is a copy of an earlier tablet. This was certainly the usual practice with Seleucid tablets.
As first critical comments: There is no evidence of Sumerian observers keeping a "night diary" of their skywatching. There is no evidence of systematic skywatching during the Sumerian period. The claim of a Sumerian "night diary" is an unsupported supposition - a fantasy.
Mark Hempsell claims (personal communication, June 16) that "... ALL the constellations and star names in the later Semitic languages of Mesopotamia are purely Sumerian. This suggests a) Sumerians had astronomy and b) they are the source of the later Babylonian astronomy." This oversimplification shows complete ignorance of the issues. (In his personal communication, July 24) he has conceded this indeed is not correct.)
There are problems associated with the later Babylonian and Assyrian use of Sumerian words. (For Semitic Akkadian scribes Sumerian was a language learned during scribal education.) Overlooked by Bond and Hempsell is Sumerian was used long after it ceased to be a commonly spoken language. It is not possible to decide whether the Sumerian words used in later (nonSumerian) times are actually Sumerian in origin or are just later Babylonian notions recorded in anachronistic Sumerian. Because of the ability of the Sumerian language to express multiple words with the brevity of a single logogram the Sumerian language was later used for either technical or ritual purposes. In some ways the later use of Sumerian in Babylonian texts is somewhat similar to the continued use of Latin in the Middles Ages in Europe (termed 'Classical Latin'). It was the language of the cultural elite (i.e., the lingua franca). As such no conclusion can be confidently drawn from the later use of Sumerian terms regarding the time or place of the origin of the content of the texts. Also, there are very few original Sumerian tablets containing any significant astronomical references. One of the very few possible astronomical references relates to the "House of the Stars." Circa 2700 BCE the goddess Nisiba (the patron goddess of scribes) had a knowledge of astronomy attributed to her and her temple in Eres was called the "House of the Stars." She had a lapis-lazuli tablet which is sometimes called the "tablet with the stars of the heavens" or "tablet with the stars of the pure heavens." It was kept in her "House of Wisdom." It is possible that this lapis-lazuli tablet - which was connected with astronomy - was a kind of star-map or symbolic representation of the heavens.
The common use of Sumerian logograms for constellations and star names amongst the Semitic peoples inhabiting Mesopotamia is, as far as I am aware, a late occurrence. Most of the names of all celestial bodies were Sumerian throughout the later periods of Mesopotamian history. (Just as the invention of many Mesopotamian constellations was a late occurrence dating to circa the last quarter of the 2nd millennium BCE.) Even so, it was not complete. Not all of the names used were Sumerian. For example, I do not recall any use of Sumerian words for the Assyrian period star/constellation names anunitu, mul he-gal-a-a-a, and tultu. (Interestingly, no Sumerian term for constellation has been identified. However, in his e-book Introduction to Sumerian Grammar (2008, Page 13) Daniel Foxvog has: "Determinative: mul, Meaning: star, Category: planets, stars and constellations." The Assyrian period reign of Asshurbanipal (668-627 BCE) saw a renaissance in things

Sumerian. The later reign of Nabonidus over Babylon (559-539 BCE) also saw a similar renaissance in things Sumerian. (The Late Babylonian Period broadly encompasses the last seven centuries BCE. By the beginning of the Late Babylonian Period (circa 750 BCE) Assyrian domination began to decline. In 612 BCE the Assyrian capital Niniveh was sacked and the Assyrian Empire was more or less extinguished.) Numerous Sumerian-Akkadian syllabary's existed (but Sumerian and Akkadian are vastly different languages).
Mark Hempsell (personal communication, July 28), in an attempt to correct my statement "Interestingly, no Sumerian term for constellation has been identified." writes: "The Sumerian word for "constellation is very well established. It is the same as for star; that is MUL. This is the entry in Halloran ....." (In their book John Halloran is mistakenly called Holloran (page 12).) As much as I respect the efforts of John Halloran and his publication Sumerian Lexicon I would note that the standard (and most complete) professional publication is The Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary (PSD). (Rather amazingly this monumental publication seems to have been completely ignored by the authors.) The electronic edition of PSD basically states: mul (shine) means "star; to shine, radiate (light) ...." and references Early Dynastic IIIb Period (circa 2540-2350 BCE); Lagash II Period (circa 2141-2122 BCE), and Old Babylonian Period (circa 1900/1800-1600 BCE). The assyriologist John Heise (Akkadian Language (1996) discussing signs used as determinatives has: "MUL (before) stars and constellations ... meaning Sum[erian] mul 'star', Akk[adian] kakkabu(m) 'star'.") The assyriologists Michael Rolf and Annette Zgoll also state ("Assyrian Astroglyphs." ZA, Volume 91, 2001) that MUL is a Sumerian logogram that means "star." (To date I have only seen 2 sources state that MUL can mean 'a star' or 'a star constellation.' However, no date references are given for this latter assertion. The assyriologist Jeanette Fincke states that 'MUL' refers to individual stars as well as constellations. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (2014) writes that the determinative mul (Sumerian) = kakkabu (Akkadian) was used to "refer to to a full range of observed astronomical phenomena including the fixed stars, but also constellations, planets, mirages, comets, shooting stars, etc." Horowitz adds that most often what is meant is a constellation.) A cursory read of the literature shows that the replicated MUL.MUL means "the stars." Also, MUL.MEŠ means 'stars.' According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (2014), the term MUL.MEŠ may refer to the plurality of stars in constellations. Whilst some people would hold that MUL-AN means "constellation" the PSD basically states: mulan, written mul-an (star), means "heavenly star" and references the term to the Old Babylonian Period. The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) identifies that the (Akkadian) term lumāšu means constellation. (According to CAD, the word lumassu can refer to one of several stars whose heliacal rising or setting falls at or near solstices or equinoxes, can be simply a poetic word for stars in general, or can refer to zodiacal constellations.) In Akkadian the term lumāšu referred to the zodiacal constellations and logographically lumāšu was written as MUL.LU.MAS or LU.MAS.ŠI (lumāšu-stars). Picking up on this John Steele writes "The zodiacal signs as a group were referred to using the term LU-MASŬ (Akkadian: lumāsŭ), literally meaning 'constellation'." (See: "Celestial Measurement in Babylonian Astronomy." by John Steele (Annals of Science, Volume 64, Number 3, 2007, Pages 293-325).) It is indicated that MUL, the Sumerian determinative for 'star,' was also generally used to denote all other astral phenomena. There is no exclusive word for constellation. This use/application of MUL in multiple ways is a reason why the identification of star names/constellations remains elusive.
Also, the late Erica Reiner pointed out that the Sumerian dil.bat (DIL.BAT) = "bright or brilliant" = star, and also = Akkadian nebu/nabu (= bright); and Assyrian kakkabu = star. The Spanish Sumerologist Miguel Civil, (1926-2019) in his book, The Farmer's Instructions: A Sumerian Agricultural Manual (1994) writes (page 79) that the constellations are called idāt erēši (the signs of sowing (time)), in the Gula hymn. The Akkadian Gula Hymn of Bullutṣa-rabi is a late composition dated circa the Persian period.
It is not clear how many assyriologists and sumerologists accept/agree with the etymologies given by John Halloran. In his posting on ANE (Thursday, 13 May, 2004) E. Adams stated all assyriologists and sumerologists he had spoken to did not accept Halloran's etymologies. No examples of use of words are given and also no sources are given for the derivation of meanings.
Johannes Koch has identified that K 8538 is placed in the Mul.Apin astronomical/omen tradition of circa 1200 BCE. The idea that the tablet information could be copied and recopied for some 2000 years without copyist errors being introduced is rather difficult to believe. The so-called "Venus tablets" from perhaps circa 1600 BCE contain evidence of numerous copyist errors. The date given for the Sumerian/asteroid theory takes us back to the early proto-cuneiform period beginning circa 3100 BCE. Tablets from this early period simply list goods. The co-authors hold that later copyists could accurately deal not only with the complex (and inefficient) proto-cuneiform pictographic script but could also successfully deal with the earlier astronomical concepts expressed in proto-cuneiform pictographic script. Modern expert assyriologists, with the benefits of modern professional schooling and examples of tablets from all periods, point out that proto-cuneiform (circa 3200-3000 BCE is a rudimentary language that is extremely difficult to decipher. For perhaps the first 500 years (or perhaps 1000 years) script remained limited in its ability to render language, and script signs were were primarily a mnemonic device. Cuneiform is a script not a language. It can be used to render any language. Different versions of cuneiform writing were used to write various Near Eastern languages. (The 7th-century BCE Assyrian language and cuneiform script was a version of Akkadian. The Babylonian language and cuneiform script of the 1st-millennium BCE was a variant version of Akkadian.) If K 8538 is evidence of Sumerian astronomy then it is an extraordinary "stand-alone" tablet. There is a bigger case to be made for it as extraordinary proof of the existence of Sumerian astronomy - and a sophisticated Sumerian astronomy at that. I find it impossible to believe their particular claimed "translation."
The confidence of the co-authors in their translation is bolstered by the fact that K 8538 lacks flowing text and only contains short "notes." These short "notes" (containing highly repetitious use of terms) have presented problems to experienced cuneiform philologists.

decided on the type of information recorded on the tablet (i.e., an asteroid hit with earth). (Quite fantastically, Mark Hempsell has several times claimed their translation success was enabled by their knowing the content of the tablet prior to making the translation!) This may well explain why the authors identify 4 planets in the text whilst assyriologists do not identify any planets are being named. Another issue is the authors replace terms such as UR.SUB.TI with UR.SUB.DI. This, of course, involves a change of meaning. It strengthens the case that an inaccurate/misleading translation has been made. Well worth reiterating is the fact our knowledge of the Sumerian language is incomplete. Anyway, the tablet is not written in Sumerian. According to the authors the (Sumerian) proto-cuneiform has been replaced with 7th-century BCE (Assyrian) cuneiform. Proto-cuneiform script represents a very early stage in the development of writing and the symbols are not always clearly decipherable. Exact meanings are open to interpretation.
Several other fantastic claims by the authors are: (1) the Pisces sector of the tablet shows the position of the celestial equator (page 5), (2) the marking of the celestial equator possibly enabled later (Assyrian) scribes to gain knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes more than 500 years before Hipparchus (page 5), and (3) there is an Aries sector marked on the tablet. Regarding this latter claim they also assert that Aries was identified in Sumerian times as a zodiacal constellation (page 41). However, all the evidence indicates that Aries first appeared in the Greek zodiac. It replaced the Babylonian constellation of the Hired Man (which became one of their 12 ecliptic constellations). (Even though they do their "sheep" philology "thing" in their book Mark Hempsell now claims (personal communication, July 24) the Aries identification they made was simply "another opps [oops]."
In his personal communication (July 24) Marl Hempsell writes: "I am not sure why you have such a problem with the celestial equator and the precession of the equinoxes points...." The point is I really wouldn't have an issue with such if the evidence could be "rolled out." All the available evidence is clearly on the "against" side. The authors seem to be misled by the publications of Werner Papke and Vladimir Tuman that argue the Mul.Apin information existed in the 3rd-millennium BCE.
Mark, Hempsell, one of the authors, informs me that both he and co-author Alan Bond did the translation themselves "with some help from the British Museum" (whatever that means). The nature of this assistance is not even made clear after its acknowledgement on page xiii of their book. It tends to suggest a legitimacy for their translations. Neither of the authors of the book are cuneiform philologists and neither is an expert on the history of the Ancient Near East. Between the study of K 8538 by the competent assyriologist Ernst Weidner (published 1915) and the more informed study by Johannes Koch (published 1989) relatively little interest has been shown in it. (A detailed discussion of the history of attempts to understand K 8538 is contained in Egypt: "Image of Heaven": The Planisphere and the Lost Cradle by Willem Zitman (2006).) (Mark Hempsell (personal communication, July 24) writes I "seem to indicate ... [this] book .... is a perfectly credible work." This assumption is not justified by the reason I mention it.) One Dutch author in a relatively recent book has linked the interpretation of K 8538 with the Egyptian god Horus.
In a more recent personal communication (July 24) Mark Hempsell states: "In mentioning the British Museum I was simply pointing out experts had seen what we were doing before we published." In the next paragraph he quite amazingly states: "So far (despite many comments such as yours on our amateur status) we have not received one negative comment on its accuracy." One can only ask the two obvious questions: Does this include the experts at the British Museum? Can we accept their absence of criticism (or rather absence of public criticism) as de facto support for the accuracy of the translation? It appears the authors simply relied heavily on some "text books" on the Sumerian language by René Labat, Alain Lassine, and John Halloran. (On his website Alain Lassine refers to the PSD as a better resource.)
Nic Fleming, Science Correspondent, The Telegraph, March 31, 08, 2008 reports Mark Hempsell saying: "All previous work has drawn a blank on what the tablet is about." (This comment by Hempsell is not strictly correct.) It is certainly not, however, the work of a Sumerian astronomer. There is a total absence of evidence for this claim.
The geological evidence indicates the so-called Köfels landslide (and forming of pumiceous glass) did not occur from a single event (such as a meteor impact, or impact of a disintegrated meteor) but was a process involving multiple large conventional landslides. Also, the evidence indicates these landslides occurred thousands of years earlier to the date claimed for the Köfels impact impact event. Excepting for the need to force-fit facts to accommodate eccentric theories there is no reason to question the conventional dates for the landslides. The enormous size of the landslide process (approximately 2 to 3 cubic kilometres in mass) provides sufficient kinetic heating to melt the rock. (See: Lehoux, H., and Doukhan, J-C. (1993). "Dynamic deformation of quartz in the landslide of Köfels, Austria." (European Journal of Mineralogy, Volume 5, Number 5, Pages 893-902); Deutsch, A., et al. (1994).

(Engineering Geology, Volume 83, Numbers 13, Pages 94-108). Currently (2009) the authors A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event (2008) are claiming that the content of the asteroid has contaminated the Kőfels site and affected the current dating attempts.

There is every indication that the authors of A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event need to sharpen their pencils. Both the philological and geological arguments fail. Submitting a paper to a relevant refereed journal would seem a good suggestion.
Update: The Wikipedia entry for Alan Bond includes: "The landslide is normally dated to about 9800 years ago long before the tablet was recorded and over 4500 years before the Bristol researchers date. Bond and Hempsell have suggested that there was contamination, a claim that has been denied by other research. The impact theory had already been proposed in 1936 by the Austrian scientist Franz Eduard Suess and later on by Alexander Tollman, who hypothetized impacts in around 7640 BCE and 3150 BCE, respectively. The issue of whether an impact caused the landslide has been researched and no evidence was found for an asteroid, meteorite or comet, and geologists believe it was caused by other factors such as 'deep creep'."
Regarding the meaning of the Akkadian terms lumāšu = constellation and lumāši = constellations. The assyriologists Michael Rolf and Annette Zgoll also state ("Assyrian Astroglyphs." ZA, Volume 91, 2001) that the terms were used in the sense of a form of writing with astral pictographs or 'astroglyps.' The god Marduk drew the 'constellations of the gods' (lumāši ša itani) on the (jasper) stone surface of the starry sky (= the Lower Heaven).

Fire in the Sky
by Jeff Medkeff & Martin Rundkvist
According to A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels Impact Event, an asteroid entered the Earth’s atmosphere in 3123 BC and exploded above the Austrian Alps, triggering a major landslide. The authors also argue that during the final minutes of the object’s approach, it was observed by an astronomer in Mesopotamia who made detailed notes of the event, and by Neolithic people in coastal Croatia, who were inspired to depict it on their pottery.
The landslide is real. The Croatian pottery is real. The asteroid and the Sumerian astronomer, however, are in our opinion very poorly founded speculation. We take it that the authors are quite sincere about their work. But their assumptions are so many, and so outlandish, that this book would no doubt make William of Ockham’s head explode if he even glanced at it.
When considering the argument, we first need to know whether or not any extraterrestrial body did in fact contribute to the giant landslide at Köfels in Austria. If not, then the Sumerian connection is moot.
The Köfels deposit is about half a kilometre thick and measures five kilometres in diameter. It is very young in geological terms, dating from after the end of the last ice age. In 1936, geologist F. Suess published an extraterrestrial impact hypothesis to explain the formation. There is a lot of glass in it: a pumice-like mineral named köfelsite. Most geologists today believe that it formed when rock melted through friction in the landslide, but others still think it is more plausibly from an impact. Such impact events have created glass at other sites. The age of the Köfels deposit has been measured using radiometric methods, indicating that it formed at least 8,000 years ago — not 5,000 years ago as the book suggests.
As the authors readily admit, there is nothing resembling an impact crater at Köfels. Perhaps the strongest evidence for an impact origin of the structure was the reported presence of planar deformation features in quartz. They are microscopic features of silicate (e.g. quartz and feldspar) grains; basically very thin planes of glass arranged in parallel sets that have particular orientations with respect to the containing crystal’s structure. Such deformation is utterly diagnostic of impact events: no other geological event can form it, not even highly energetic volcanic eruptions. However, upon re-examination, Deutsch et al. found that shocked quartz with planar deformation is not present at Köfels. Instead, they saw quartz with lamellar deformation features typical of tectonic processes. Indeed, shocked quartz does not form through meteoritic airbursts: it requires a ground impact. Also, Hermanns et al. have shown that the Köfels features did not form through a single landslide, but are the result of several separate slides at different times. Currently, the consensus of scientific opinion is that Köfels is not an impact site. It is not listed in the Earth Impact Database, not even as a possible site. We need to know no more to discount the main argument of A Sumerian Observation.
Touchingly, the authors suggest that the reason that their asteroid exploded was that it struck a still apparently quite unharmed mountaintop a glancing blow some ways from Köfels. Yet by far the greater part of the book’s text is not about the Köfels deposit, nor about the movements of asteroids. It mainly deals in great detail with a fragmentary cuneiform tablet, most likely hailing from Layard's mid-19th century excavations at Niniveh, and kept in the British Museum. To give A Sumerian Observation a fair airing, let us assume for a moment (credulously) that there was a meteoritic airburst at Köfels 5,000 years ago, and examine the Sumerian angle.
The first thing to note about the tablet is that it is not 5,000 years old, but dates from the 7th century BC. The authors suggest that it is a copy of a Sumerian astronomer’s observation log from a summer night in 3123 BC. The copier(s) has reproduced all diagrams on the original tablet exactly, but replaced the original’s early Sumerian script with updated 7th century cuneiform. The reason that this uniquely early piece of scientific documentation, and only this particular piece, survives is



2022. 02. 21. 19:47 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20210714081605/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-9.html 11/18
that according to the authors the asteroid airburst soon acquired great religious significance in Mesopotamia. In fact, they explain (p. 104) that "There are many ancient European and Asian myths that are not only indicative of a NEO [Near-Earth Object] impact, but contain detail very suggestive of this specific event. It was consideration of these myths that was the original focus of this study."
Only about three fifths of the tablet’s surface survives, but even the well-preserved parts are almost incomprehensible. Though the script is clear, its contents are laconic and repetitive, more poesie concrète than narrative. Professional cuneiform scholars agree that the tablet has something to do with astronomy, but hardly anyone believes that any detailed meaning is recoverable. Again, touchingly, the authors admit in the preface that the tablet is only really comprehensible if one decides beforehand what it is supposed to say. "The third (and key) assumption is that [the tablet] records an observation of an Aten class asteroid that impacted the Austrian Alps at the locality of Köfels at the end of the Fourth Millennium BC."
Sumerian script is the earliest known form of writing, first appearing some time between 3500 and 3300 BC. All extant inscriptions from c. 3100 BC and earlier are terse lists of goods. Almost a thousand years of writing pass before any sentence with a verb appears. The authors’ argument for ascribing their hypothetical original tablet such an early date is that it shows something they interpret as the celestial equator in something they interpret as the constellation Pisces. With a more cautious attitude, and with a bit more respect for the current state of Sumerian philology, we of course argue the reverse: since an original tablet cannot realistically date from 3100 BC, the tablet cannot be taken to depict the celestial equator in Pisces.
Even assuming against good evidence that an asteroid did explode at Köfels in 3123 BC, there is no reason to believe that the cuneiform tablet in question has anything to do with that event. Any half-crumbled hieroglyphic papyrus or weathered Mayan bas-relief, yes, any graffiti-covered restroom wall, could be pressed into service in the same way. But the tablet is the sole data source for the authors’ interpretive model of the supposed event, and the focus of most of the book. (The Croatian astropottery, mercifully, makes only a few brief appearances.)
The authors’ attempts at geology and Sumerian philology are far off the mark. Since this invalidates the astronomical inferences drawn, we shall only make two points on that subject. First, the hypothetical incoming object was, according to the authors, an asteroid of the Aten class with a density below that of water. This is nonsense. Aten class asteroids by definition spend all their time in the inner solar system. But low-density compounds do not survive for long in small bodies there, because volatiles evaporate or sublimate near the sun. This is a process we see with comets: sublimation creates the comet’s coma and tail. What remains after a few centuries of solar heating and mass loss in the inner solar system is rock. And wellobserved Aten asteroids are known to have had fairly stable orbits for millions of years.
Second, according to the authors, the mechanism by which the Sumerians learned that the asteroid had hit the Earth and were inspired to re-write their mythology, is this. The non-impact threw up a plume of deadly ejecta directed back along the path the body had arrived on, which at that moment formed a low-pressure tunnel through the atmosphere. They have picked this idea up from what happened when the comet Shoemaker/Levy 9 hit Jupiter in 1994. But that impact was into a dense gaseous atmosphere with no solid surface, and the dynamics were very different from solid-body impacts. The mechanism that created the Jovian plumes does not apply on Earth. A low-pressure region on Earth cannot achieve as large a pressure difference as on Jupiter, and our atmosphere is significantly less dense to begin with. Furthermore, no ejecta form without a crater. The process that forms the crater causes the ejecta: WHAM. Yet there is no crater of a matching date anywhere on Earth. The lack of a Jovian-density atmosphere on Earth means that you cannot have Shoemaker/Levy-9 style plumes from your crater, and the absence of any crater means that you cannot have any ejecta in the first place.
Is this work pseudoscience or simply bad science? Whatever it is, it most certainly is a case of severe amateurism. The authors make radical inferences from philological, archaeological and geological data outside their area of expertise, and happily arrive at something they are not professionally equipped to understand: the movements of a celestial body. In the preface they suggest that their inspired insight has enabled them to interpret the cuneiform tablet in a completely new way. They explain the reason that no academic journal or book series has accepted their work is that academic reviewers are too narrowly specialized (and thus, it is politely hinted, narrow-minded) to appreciate this kind of interdisciplinary research. But good interdisciplinary research is done when specialists in different fields collaborate closely: not when specialists in a single field (here, astronautical engineering) make inspired forays onto the territory of disciplines they know little about.
Another writer who has spun tall tales about the enigmatic cuneiform tablet is Zecharia Sitchin. In his 1976 book The Twelfth Planet, the tablet is an astrogator's chart from a time when space aliens ruled the Earth. And although A Sumerian Observation contains not one word about aliens, this is the company the book belongs with: the works of Sitchin, von Däniken, and Velikovsky.

Appendix 4: Recent Supporters of the Fantasy Interpretation of K 8538 by Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell
Joachim Seifert (who describes himself as a climate author, and tablet translator), and Frank Lemke (who sells modelling software) both jointly and individually publish papers and correspondence on the internet, that create controversy. Two of their joint papers are an impact(s) from space speculation using K 8538 as a historical source for the late 3rd-millennium BCE. The theme is that cosmic impacts are a contributor to climate change effects. Seifert believes the book, A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event (2008), by Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell has merit. Also, like Bond and Hempsell, Seifert believes the K 8538 planisphere contains a generally understandable astronomical message with sufficient celestial details given to understand the content of the tablets. Instead of an impact event in the Alps (Köfels, Austria) proposed by Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell, the claim by Joachim Seifert and Frank Lemke now is an impact event in the TigrisEuphrates marshes is being recorded. (Regarding the title "tablet translator": I have yet to see any evidence that Seifert has any professional credentials in cuneiform philology, is employed by academic bodies to do translations of cuneiform tablets, has a history of publishing translations of cuneiform tablets in professional journals, and has done a collation of K8538.)
Article abstracts and announcements:
"The destruction of the city of Akkad by a cosmic asteroid impact and the link to global climate change." by Joachim Seifert and Frank Lemke (Published online on: May 15, 2013 (15 pages)). Abstract: "We focus on one of the most important events in human history, the 4.2 kiloyear event, when great civilizations around the world collapsed into anarchy and social chaos. From this moment on, climate cooling and widespread aridification began, lowering agricultural food production and human living conditions. Various hypotheses exist about its cause; the most promising approach links the 4.2 kiloyear event to a cosmic asteroid crash into Mesopotamia. The asteroid landed in a densely populated area; we examine at first major translations of preserved Sumerian documents on details and progression of this catastrophic event. We quote major impact features as observed by historical Sumerian eyewitnesses. The impact, as a full strike, eradicated the Imperial city of Akkad. The impact damaged all other Sumerian towns to different degrees. Based on our findings, we identify the location of the missing city of Akkad. We analyze the onset of global cooling and severe aridification in the framework of our cosmic climate footprint analysis for a selected 1,000 year timeframe. This footprint analysis of Holocene climate change affirms the occurrence and date of the impact event. We also identify volcanic mega-eruptions, which are responsible for multi-decadal global temperature dips but which cannot cause centennial-long climate changes. The footprint analysis takes 5 climate macroforcings into account and explains global cooling and aridification based on impact-related causes."
An unsolicited paper announcement received by e-mail Monday, 5 May 2014: "Dear Colleagues, We are pleased to announce the decoding and translation of the Babylonian cuneiform tablet K8538 in our new paper "The Sumerian K8538 tablet - The great meteor impact devastating Mesopotamia". The importance of the tablet decoding concerns two fields of science: One is Ancient History of mankind, the other concerns Abrupt Climate Change from a benign to a malign climate and vice versa, which in turn, supports or ends civilizations. At first, an introduction of our work to climate scientists: The abrupt climate change event at 4.2 kyears BP ended various ancient civilizations on the globe. Its cause was simulated in climate GCMmodels focussing on SST, AMO, NAO, PDO, TSI, LULC etc. None of these simulations successfully identified the real cause, because cosmic impact events remain excluded. The 4.2 kyear BP climate change consists of a short episode of torrential flash flooding, followed by 300 years of mega-drought. The occurrence of a flash flood and an ensuing megadrought is standard feature for more than 10 identified sizable cosmic impacts in the Holocene. The K8538 tablet

documents the 4.2 kyear BP event as the cosmic meteor impact in Mesopotamia in 2,193 BC, presenting accurate scientific astronometrical measurements for the cometary impact in Sumer. For this reason, continued exclusion of cosmic impacts has lost credibility in climate change analyses. Second, an overview for historians of ancient Near Eastern Civilizations and assyriologists: The K8538 tablet was the most difficult of all Assyrian tablets, because of its sparse cuneiform explanations in midst of drawings, for which the explanatory code was missing. For this reason, almost nobody dared to translate the tablet over the past 100 years since William King made his transliteration available in 1912. We present a profound detail analysis as an interdisciplinary combination of assyriology, astronomy, meteor impact science and symbol interpretation. The utmost important feature of the tablet is that it reports neither fiction nor poetical script, but rather hard fact scientific trigonometry, conducted by an ancient astronomer on top of his sky observation ziggurat. His scientific observations, documented on K8538, concerns the comet's approach and final impact in Sumer from an about 100 km distance to the impact site. The historical significance: The tablet demonstrates that the Akkadian Empire and civilization came to an abrupt end through a direct cometary hit, next to its capital Agade. After the impact and with the onset of the consequential mega-drought, neighboring Gutian nomadic herdsman tribes left their regions and moved with their livestock into the now devastated and depopulated Mesopotamian area. The current assumed lemma is that mountain tribes scored an undocumented victory over the largest standing professional army of the time, which was equipped with weaponry of world standard for the following 2000 years until Roman times. The tribes are further blamed of dismantling the capital city of Agade entirely with all building foundations. The K8538 tablet is the documented scientific prove (sic) for the real end of Akkad in 2,193 BC: A result of a direct cometary impact in Mesopotamia. The full paper is available at: http://www.knowledgeminer.eu/climate/papers.html Thank you. The authors"
"The Sumerian K8538 tablet - The great meteor impact devastating Mesopotamia." by Joachim Seifert and Frank Lemke (Published on: April 25, 2014 (20 pages)). Abstract: "The K8538 is the world's first scientific documentation on approach and terrestrial impact of a large comet on Earth. Observations were made on top of an astronomical tower, located 100 km close to the impact site. The report is presented in form of a sequence of eight pictures, explaining the comet's first astronomical sighting, the appearance of comet tail and coma, the growing comet size, the comet flight across the sky and finally, its visible impact beyond the horizon, i.e. the impact flash lighting of the sky and the subsequent elevation of ash plumes, glowing beyond the horizon, spreading North and West. The impact itself is not described as a blast pressure wave but rather as an ash and dust tempest, rising out of mud sediments from the Tigris and Euphrates river delta, where the hot comet found its burial. The astronomical observer carried out trigonometrical measurements to record the flight path in the sky, flying distances and flying times. The observer started his measurements as soon as the comet showed its spectacular size, coma and tail, which convinced the observer, that an extraordinary celestial event was about to take place. The K8538 is a full comprehensive analysis of the comet event; its eight-picture sequence is cohesive. The tablet is a masterly work, explaining with as little text a maximum amount of impact event features. The tablet is a late Babylonian copy of the early old Sumerian original. Written cuneiform signs of two zodiacal constellations, Orion and Triangulum, are later Babylonian copy scribe additions and were not part of the Sumerian original. The K8538 tablet had high priority in Babylonian times, because it provided the documented evidence that the comet emerged out of the constellation Triangulum, Mul-Apin, onto which late Babylonian astronomy and religion rested. The tablet eyewitness account shows Mul-Apin as celestial seat of Gods and celestial source of destructive meteors on Earth. For this reason, the K8538 was guarded, copied and refreshed over more than 1,500 years, until the late Babylonian period, after the observed meteor impact in 2,193 BC. The tablet does not deal with any Babylonian zodiacal astrology. The described cosmic impact on Earth is the so-called 4.2 kyr event, shown in our other Holocene climate change studies. The comet impact is responsible for a 300 year long drop in global temperatures combined with lasting megadroughts, which led to the collapse of various ancient civilisations around the world."
In their several papers and publication announcements (see above) both Joachim Seifert and Frank Lemke involve the use of K8538 in a manner reminiscent of A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event (2008) by Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell.
Their historical reconstructions are without the support of the community of assyriologists and geologists.
On Thursday, 7 March 2019 I received another unsolicited e-mail from Joachim Seifert notifying of an adjunct article to the 2014 article. (Included with the e-mail was the advice that I am a disgrace to science and I should take up kangaroo breeding.) The new article is: "The Sumerian K8538 Tablet. The Great Meteor Impact Devastating Mesopotamia." by Joachim Seifert and Frank Lemke (Uploaded to ResearchGate.net, February 2019 (11 pages)). Abstract: "The paper adds new translation knowledge to our 2014 paper: "The Sumerian K8538 tablet, the great meteor impact devastating Mesopotamia". We present an improved, detailed fixing of the meteor impact day and impact hour, according to data provided on the tablet. A sky map for Northern Taurids meteor showers shows the comet flight path in the sky. Other useful information is given concerning climatic change, following the meteor impact, the meteor impact aftermath and new details for the relation of the cosmic impact to the Christian Bible, in particularly to Genesis and Apocalypse. The meteor impact occurred at 10:56 am, on September 22, 2193 BC, after the meteor emerged at 5:34 am at dawn and after a flight time of 5 hours 22 minutes. These numbers can clearly be deduced out of observation data entries in the tablet's pictographic records and in comparison to LOD (length-of-day tables) for the corresponding Mesopotamian latitude. The K8538 tablet is property of the British Museum. Unfortunately, the museum is staunched in its opinion that this tablet represents the Babylonian sky as a so-called

"planisphere". This opinion is based on an interpretation, which we, for the first time, analyze in comprehensive detail, item by item, in this paper. Result: The planispheric concept of the Babylonian sky on this tablet is a hoax: Not one single correct argument proves alleged recorded planispheric constellations on the tablet, except one, already found by L. W. King, over 100 years ago, back in 1912. As translated in our 2014 K8538 paper, the tablet has never been a planisphere, but is a pictographic "cartoon" story, probably the first recorded cartoon of the world, consisting of a sequence of 8 subsequent pictures, to be turned while reading, to advance the story. All 8 pictures exclusively show observations, recorded measurements and specific details of flight and impact of this disastrous meteor, which destroyed the nearby Akkadian capital in Mesopotamia. Because Southern Iraq in the impact area was swamp and marshland until recently, an exploration of the discovered impact crater, Umm-al-Binni, was impossible. For the first time, it is feasible from 2019 on, and a first crater inspection will soon be conducted. Due to missing explorations of the impact crater, Near-East historians, until now, did not recognize the historical cosmic impact event, but we may expect that this will change in the near future." The essay has not appeared in any academic journals.
This particular sentence sets out the fantastic nature of the article: "The meteor impact occurred at 10:56 am, on September 22, 2193 BC, after the meteor emerged at 5:34 am at dawn and after a flight time of 5 hours 22 minutes." Obviously skilled use of sundial at night time. It is worth noting that 3rd-millennium BCE texts do not attest to the use a Sumerian hour or minute. From the Ur III period there is the artificial administrative division of the workday in 60 parts. The proposed search for the supposed meteor crater reminds me of the searches for the biblical Ark on Mount Ararat.
The eminent assyriologist Hermann Hunger ("The Cultic Calendars of the Ancient Near East." in The Journal of the American Oriental Society, October-December, 1996) states: "While there is no doubt that the sky was observed in Sumerian times for the purpose of omens and probably also in connection with cultic actions, this is not astronomy, which involves measuring and computing." The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz concludes ("Some Thoughts on Sumerian Star-Names and Sumerian Astronomy." In: An Experienced Scribe Who Neglects Nothing, edited by Yitzhak Sefati et. al. (2005)): (1) Sumerian texts, dating back to the time of the earliest archives of cuneiform texts, do directly and indirectly indicate evidence of astronomical/astrological activities. (2) The state of present cuneiform evidence indicates that the Sumerians of the 3rdand 4th-millennium BCE had no formal system of astral sciences (astronomy/astrology) that can be compared to astronomy/astrology in Akkadian texts of the 2nd-millennium BCE. There is no evidence that Mul.Apin is a compendium of late-Sumerian astronomical lore or that the astrolabes derive from late-Sumerian astral lore. A good succinct summary is given by the physicist Professor Robert Logan (The Poetry of Physics and the Physics of Poetry, 2010; Chapter 3, Pages 1121): "Systematic astronomical observations were not part of Sumerian tradition but were begun by the Akkadians, worshippers of the sun god Shamash. Their observations were somewhat crude ... and it was only with the flowering of the Assyrian empire in approximately 700 B.C. that accurate quantitative measurements were made ...." Sumerian cosmology contains mythic elements. The extent to which Sumerian myths related to astronomical objects i.e., planets, remains uncertain.
Evidence for Sumerian celestial observation consists of: (1) calendar establishment and regulation, (2) likely observations of the heliacal risings of particular stars, and (3) their knowledge that Venus was both a morning and evening star. Evidence for Sumerian celestial divination consists of: (1) the association of the goddess Nisaba with the stars, and (2) Nisaba consulting a star tablet for guidance on architectural matters. Evidence for Sumerian star names/constellations consists of: (1) the goddess Nisaba consulting a star tablet, (2) the earliest kings in The Sumerian King List sharing names with constellations, and (3) fragments of star lists/constellation mentions may go back to the 3rd-millennium BCE. The Ur III period (2112-2004 BCE) (not to be confused with the earlier Uruk III period reaching up to circa 3000 BCE) is generally considered the best (most abundant) documented century in antiquity. This was due to a state organisation that was very bureaucratic. It is also termed the Neo Sumerian period or the "Sumerian Renaissance." The tens of thousands of cuneiform tablets that have survived document an immense range of activities. This has resulted in nearly 100 years of intense scholarly work on the Ur III period. Within the context of the active intellectual endeavour recorded at this period no astronomy emerges.
There is no evidence for any Sumerian "astronomical diaries." It also needs to be reiterated that half of the face of K 8538 is missing (i.e., has been obliterated). Also, there is no text on the tablet stating it is a copy of an earlier tablet. Incredibly, William Russeth (at his Blogspot) claims: "... that part of the inscription mentions this tablet was copied from a tablet made 2000 years earlier."
Johannes Koch has identified that K 8538 is placed in the Mul.Apin astronomical/omen tradition. (Though the Mul.Apin tradition can be dated to circa 1200 BCE, Koch dates K 8538 to 650 BCE Niniveh.) The idea that the tablet information could be copied and recopied for some 2000 years without copyist errors being introduced is rather difficult to believe. The socalled "Venus tablets" from perhaps circa 1600 BCE contain evidence of numerous copyist errors. The date given for the Sumerian/asteroid theory takes us back to the early proto-cuneiform period beginning circa 3100 BCE. Most tablets from this early period simply list goods. Not demonstrated by those holding the "transmission theory" for K 8538 is how later copyists could accurately deal not only with the complex (and inefficient) proto-cuneiform pictographic script but could also successfully deal with the earlier astronomical concepts expressed in proto-cuneiform pictographic script. Modern expert assyriologists, with the benefits of modern professional schooling and examples of tablets from all periods, point out that proto-cuneiform (circa 3200-3000 BCE is a rudimentary language that is extremely difficult to decipher. (The 7th-century BCE Assyrian language and cuneiform script was a version of Akkadian. The Babylonian language and cuneiform script of the 1st-millennium BCE was a variant version of Akkadian.) If K 8538 is evidence of Sumerian astronomy then it is an

extraordinary "stand-alone" tablet. There is a bigger case to be made for it as extraordinary proof of the existence of Sumerian astronomy - and a sophisticated Sumerian astronomy atthat.
Well worth reiterating is the fact our knowledge of the Sumerian language is incomplete. Exact meanings are open to interpretation. Anyway, K 8538 is not written in Sumerian. According to Seifert the Sumerian cuneiform has been replaced with 7th-century BCE (Assyrian) cuneiform.
I can only conclude that in the papers mentioned above a number of astronomical claims made are only fantasy and speculation.
Working from the abstracts/announcement above, as readers are perhaps unlikely to access the full articles, I give statements and then my remarks:

"The astronomical observer carried out trigonometrical measurements to record the flight path in the sky, flying distances and flying times."
Weidner sets out his conclusion that the document served the purposes of divination and sorcery, with the aid of astrology. The apparently pointless, multiple repeated syllables strung together are spells. Examples of such are already known and published by Carl Bezold (Catalogue IV), Alfred Jeremias (Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur, Page 110), and François ThureauDangin (RA, IX, Page 80; Text AO 5399 from the Old Babylonian period). The magic involves the frequent repetition of syllables. For other examples of incantations involving multiple repetition of the same signs see: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Pages 214-215), and "An Old Babylonian Letter and Two Amulets." by Wilfred Lambert in Iraq, Volume 38, Issue 1, March, 1976, Page 62 A.

order/relation to each other. That only a few important constellations are shown refutes the assumption of K 8538 as a sky map. The constellations and incantations appear in conjunction with each other. The assumption can be made that the formulas relate to astrologically important star positions (i.e., dawn, culmination, etc).
"The tablet is a late Babylonian copy of the early old Sumerian original."
This has to be an assumption. There is no evidence for any sophisticated Sumerian astronomy; especially the concept of Sumerian technical "astronomical diaries." There is no text on the tablet stating it is a copy of an earlier tablet. Not demonstrated by those holding the "transmission theory" for K 8538 is how later copyists could accurately deal not only with the complex (and inefficient) proto-cuneiform pictographic script but could also successfully deal with the earlier astronomical concepts expressed in proto-cuneiform pictographic script. Modern expert assyriologists, with the benefits of modern professional schooling and examples of tablets from all periods, point out that proto-cuneiform (circa 3200-3000 BCE is a rudimentary language that is extremely difficult todecipher.
"Written cuneiform signs of two zodiacal constellations, Orion and Triangulum, are later Babylonian copy scribe additions and were not part of the Sumerian original."
The supposed late addition of 2 constellation names and 2 constellation figures has to be an assumption. The most detailed study of the tablet was the 1989 study by (the competent German amateur assyriologist) Johannes Koch in his book Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels (Chapters 7-16). He concluded it represents the night sky of 3-4 January 650 BCE over Nineveh. The constellations depicted would most likely be the principal constellations. No need to invoke late scribaladditions."

period, after the observed meteor impact in 2,193 BC."
"The tablet does not deal with any Babylonian zodiacal astrology."
Who claimed that it ever did? Babylonian zodiacal astrology was later than the date determined for the tablet. The repeating syllables along the 45 degree lines are still interpreted as comprising some form of astro-magical ritual (and possibly related to incantations). Ernst Weidner was of the opinion that Sector 7 contained numerous magical formulas. Ernst Weidner believed that the tablet was a diviner's tool. Johannes Koch believed it was a star map having a practical purpose (i.e., assistive to naked-eye observation).
It is worthwhile repeating that Johannes Koch (1989) has made the point that K 8538 is an instrument rather than an image. It
is certainly not a report. Interestingly, the name of the Assyrian capital, Assur, is written near the outline of mulab-sín (= Virgo) in section 5. The city of Assur was founded circa 1900 BCE on the site of a pre-existing community that had been built by the Akkadians at some point during the reign of Sargon the Great (2334-2279 BCE) of Akkad.
Interestingly, Seifert (in several unsolicited e-mails to me in 2014 - in which he does not establish any credentials for himself) believes I have not read his 2 articles, nor Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels by Johannes Koch, nor Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie by Ernst Weidner. He is completely mistaken. Apart from copies of Seifert's articles I have 2 copies of Koch and 3 copies of Weidner. The conjecture that Koch could employ i.e., his 1995 analysis of the DAL.BA.AN.NA text (see: Koch, Johannes. (1995). "Der Dalbanna-Sternenkatalog" (Die Welt des Orients, Band 26, Pages 43-85)), [to make his assessment of K 8538] is not evident in his Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels. [Note: At the time of writing I have not made the sentence readily sensible and I need to review how to clarify it. For the time being I have added some additional comments.] (The so-called DalbannaText/DAL.BA.AN.NA Text (a Mesopotamian star-list), combines several stars into a "string." Fragment exemplars, known for almost 100 years, (mostly?) form part of the Kouyunjik collection in the British Museum. (One exemplar is from Babylon.) The so-called Dalbanna-Text also mentions "straight, taut strings" (GU SI-SA DUB-BA), also "slack strings." Christopher Walker has remarked the "star-list is distinct in character from the other known texts of this genre." Unfortunately the meaning of terms used in the text are difficult to understand.)
For interest, see also the earlier article "Geografie van de Goden." [Geography of the Gods.] by Wim Zitman in Frontier Magazine, juli/augustus, 2001, jaargang 7, nr. 4, pages 30-34. Wim Zitman's interpretation of K 8538 is it is a map of northern Africa and the Middle East at the time of the Egyptian and Sumerian empires.
Update: It is evident that Joachim Seifert is intolerant of anything that contradicts his own ideas concerning K 8538. In July 2016 I received 3 abusive/whining e-mails in quick succession from Joachim Seifert (1 e-mail termed annex: 20-7-2016; and 2 e-mails (both with the earlier annex included again): 25-7-2016; sent 5 minutes apart). In his e-mail dated 20-7-2016 it is obvious that Seifert does not like what Koch has written on K 8538 and believes that nobody should be repeating it. In the last of his e-mails (25-7-2016) Seifert states I have not read Koch's book, states that Koch has been involved in invention and lies

and deceit, and also Koch is not a scientist but a churchman, a disgrace to science, and does not keep to scientific standards. Seifert then sets out that I should remove any praise for Koch from my essay. For some reason Seifert thinks that K 8538 and my essay - is related to the zodiac. Both are clearly not. Also, I am accused of sitting around and sulking in Australia. In the last of his e-mails (25-7-2016) Seifert states that Koch has deceived the British Museum with his translation and identification. This is quite extreme, even for a rant. The allegations are absurd and invidious. It appears that Seifert believes that nobody at the British Museum has expertise with cuneiform script. Also, apparently Seifert believes he is setting the benchmark for standards. Impressively, Seifert refers to himself as a "tablet translator."
Update: Seifert, Joachim. and Lemke, Frank. (2019). "The Sumerian K 8538 Tablet ... - A 2019 Translation Addendum." Note: Freely downloadable at ResearchGate. Interestingly the article describes Johannes Koch as a hobby clergyman. Not mentioned is that Bond and Hempsell reached their particular conclusions prior to attempting their translation.
Appendix 5: The Ziqpu Planisphere
The noun ziqpu (meaning 'height, altitude' as a mathematical term) comes from zaqapu (having a technical sense relating to vertical distance) and refers to consecutive culminations of stars moving in a 'ferris-wheel' type motion over the sky from the perspective of an earth-based observer. The 'recently' published (by Horowitz and al-Rawi in the journal Iraq, Volume 63, 2001) ziqpu-star planisphere from Neo-Babylonian period Sippar has a rosette at its centre. The diagram on the planisphere set out consecutive risings of ziqpu-stars over the course of the schematic year; represent the 'ferris-wheel' type motion of the ziqpu-stars as they ascend, reach their zenith in the centre of the sky, and then descend. Rochberg (2012) writes: "It is inscribed on both sides. The obverse of the tablet shows parts of twelve 30-degree segments indicated with straight lines radiating out from a central rosette. The names of ziqpu stars and arrangements of dots [representing stars] are preserved in six of the twelve segments. The ziqpu star names show the disk is to be read in a clockwise direction. ... The circular arrangement of the ziqpu stars ... on the obverse of the disk corresponds to the list of ... stars on its reverse. The list [of ziqpu stars] ... seems to parallel the astrolabe's presentation of stars both in lists [list/rectangular astrolabes] and in circular diagrams."
The Babylonians circa 1000 BCE used a physical instrument known as a ziqpu (a type of pole). It is likely the ziqpu-stars obtained their name from this instrument. Both would entail the use of a vertical line to assist in making other observations. Ziqpu-stars are the means by which an observer observes the rising (and setting) of other stars.
Obverse of the ziqpu-star planisphere from Sippar. The stars are listed on the reverse. Per the number labelling of the planisphere: Segment 1: "Hands of of the Crook" no dots preserved), and "The Twins" (Nabu and Nergal) (2 dots). Segment 2: "Crab" (10 dots), and "The Two Stars of the Head of the Lion" (2 dots). Segment 3: "The Four Stars of his Chest" (of the Lion) (4 dots), and "The Two Stars of his Tail" (2 dots). Segment 4: "The Single Star of Its Tail" (1 dot), "The Frond" (6 dots), and "The Harness" (1 dot). Segment 5: "The Yoke" (2 dots), and "The Rear Harness" (3 dots). Segment 6: "The Circle" (circle of dots).

Appendix 6: Mesopotamian Archives
As an outline sketch:
Southern Mesopotamia is taken to mean Sumer and Babylonia. Northern Mesopotamia is taken to mean Assyria. Babylon was one of the great southern Mesopotamian cities. Nineveh was one of the great Assyrian cities of upper Mesopotamia.
The storage of cuneiform tablets shows little relationship to modern administrative ideas. There was no library system as we know it. Archival collections were not necessarily centralised i.e., kept in one place. Tablets could be stored across multiple buildings.
Uruk, Babylon, Sippar, and Nineveh were Mesopotamian cities with important astronomy and omenology activities and archives. However, the scholars who regularly observed the night skies were not all attached to major temples or all located in the major capital cities.
In the palace and temple archives there were both "public" and "private" documents. By the 1st-millennium BCE there were private libraries in addition to palace and temple archives. At times the boundaries that existed between the public and private documents were blurred - such as identified at the Syrian site of Ugarit. In 1st-millennium BCE Mesopotamia, the boundaries between public and private temple collections were not rigidly established.
Private archives of astronomical tablets existed. Interestingly, private libraries of cuneiform texts held by families of masmassu's (e.g., Uruk in the late 5th and late 4th centuries BCE) suggests a tight social network of scholarly families. Some of the texts they copied/possessed did not originate in Uruk.
Most writing (record keeping) in ancient Mesopotamia was directed toward specific and practical ends - that of administration. In comparison to administrative documents only a relatively small number of clay tablets were devoted to myths, epics, speculations about the meaning of life, and similar themes. By far the greatest number were administrative texts, letters, texts of commercial or legal import, and those dealing with priestly concerns or those of omen takers, stargazers, and a host of temple administrators. This has led to a practice amongst assyriologists of dividing cuneiform tablets into 2 general types: so-called "stream of tradition" texts and the "day-to-day" texts.
A survey of a major collection of "stream of tradition" cuneiform texts recovered from the library assembled circa 650 BCE by the Assyrian king Assurbanipal in Nineveh, the Assyrian capital at that time, suggests that the collection was a diviner's/omenologist's reference source - traditional texts to be consulted for advising and guiding the king in his many royal obligations and activities.

E: Late Mesopotamian Constellations
10: Late Babylonian constellation depiction
Description of constellations: There is one published text from Assyria (8th – 7th century BCE) that describes constellations in words (VAT 9428, published by Weidner in 1927). In Hellenistic times, pictures of constellations were drawn on a few tablets (Weidner 1967). In some texts, relations between stars are expressed by geometrical figures (in a loose sense), but these are only partly understood. See: Pingree and Walker 1988; Walker, Welt des Orients 26, 27-42). Whether K 8538 P397674 with its drawings has an astronomical or rather a magical purpose, is disputed (Koch 1989).
"Abstract: Sumerian and Akkadian names of stars and constellations occur in cuneiform texts for over 2,000 years, from the third millennium BC down to the death of cuneiform in the early first millennium AD, but no fully comprehensive list was ever compiled in antiquity. Lists of stars and constellations are available in both the lexical tradition and astronomical-astrological tradition of the cuneiform scribes. The longest list in the former is that in the series Urra = hubullu, in the latter, those in Mul-Apin. Introduction: Cuneiform texts bearing names of stars and constellations are available from the early second millennium BC down to the time of the last available cuneiform tablets of the first-century AD ..., but there is no such thing as an authoritative [standardised] Mesopotamian star list, that is, a standard list of all the stars, or the main stars, known to a set of Ancient Mesopotamians in any one time or place. ... [W]hen speaking of Mesopotamian star lists, what is generally meant is a collection of names of constellations, with the occasional name of a fixed star or planet included. Star lists are found in two very different parts of the cuneiform corpus. First are dictionary lists in the lexical tradition that is best known from the canonical Sumerian-Akkadian series Urra = hubulla ... And the second, sets of star names in the astronomical/astrological tradition. For example, the stars of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea - the traditional divisions of the Mesopotamian sky. The Lexical Tradition: The canonical version of series Urra = hubulla, dating to ca. 1000 BC, was comprised of 24 tablets with a total of more than 10,000 entries when complete. Included in Tablet 22 of the series was list of star names with a Sumerian name on the left translated by its Akkadian name equivalent on the right. As is typical of the series as a whole, the list begins with the standard sign for stars, that is, the star determinative, Sumerian mul = Akkadian kakkabu, the latter being cognate to terms for stars in the other Semitic languages." (Horowitz, Wayne. (2014). "Mesopotamian Star Lists." In: Ruggles, Clive. (Editor). Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy. (Pages 1829-1833).)
The exact configuration and boundaries of Mesopotamian constellations are not known.
Surviving sketches/depictions and descriptions of the constellations are rare. Cuneiform texts contain very few diagrams/illustrations of celestial topics. Cuneiform texts contain very few diagrams/illustrations of celestial topics. Many of the diagrams/illustrations that exist from the Neo-Assyrian period down to the Hellenistic period are circular.

In some texts, relations between stars are expressed by geometrical figures (in a loose sense); these are only partly understood (Pingree and Walker 1988; Walker, Welt des Orients 26, 27-42).

Steele (2017) Description: This book presents a newly recovered group of cuneiform texts from first millennium Babylonia and Assyria that provide prose descriptions of the drawing (eseru) of Mesopotamian constellations. The group describes these constellations in terms of their parts: body parts for constellations in human or animal form, parts of a wagon for "The Wagon" and "The Wagon of Heaven" (the Big and Little Dipper), and so forth. The descriptions also typically speak of the clothing that constellations in human form wear, their beards if they are male, and paraphernalia that they hold or carry. In the case of "The Crab" and "The Wagon," there is also reference to the Babylonian geometric shape apsamakku, a four-sided figure. The tablets include descriptions of the celestial constellations Cancer, Pisces, Pegasus, Perseus, and many others, and focus on their parts: body parts for constellations in human or animal form; parts of a wagon for ‘The Wagon’ and ‘Wagon of Heaven’ (the Big and Little Dipper). The depictions also typically speak of the clothing that constellations in human form wear, their beards if they are male, and paraphernalia that they hold or carry. A typical passage reads in translation: The True Shepherd of Anu (i.e., Orion) ... is a human figure, clothed, bearded, supplied with a kurkuru-container(?), and grasping a lock and key. The Twins (i.e., Gemini), whostand in front of the True Shepherd of Anu..., are two human figures, clothed. The front figure is bearded, the back figure has the face of (the demon) Latarak; they carry a large jug in their right hands. The celestial body that stands below the True Shepherd of Anu is the Rooster (Lepus).
During the Seleucid Era (last few centuries BCE) in Uruk a set of 12 clay tablets showing representations of the 12 zodiacal signs for astrology were made. (Free-hand drawing on clay.) Unfortunately only examples of 3 of them survive: (1) Taurus with Pleiades (VAT 7851 (= VAN 786 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)), (2) Leo with Corvus standing on Hydra (VAT 7847 (= VAN 784 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin), and (3) Virgo with her ear of corn (VAT 6448 = AO 6448). Regarding VAT 7851: In the lunar disk positioned in between the Pleiades and Taurus the god Marduk is wrestling a lion eclipse.
VAT 7847, Obverse. (Free-hand drawing on clay.)
A Seleucid era astrological tablet. Two astrological texts from Uruk, VAT7847 and Louvre Museum's AO 6448, have long been recognized as two pieces of one large tablet (zodiac compilation tablet). The tablet deals with the division of Zodiac into subzodiacs, and the connection of these subzodiacs to different cities/towns, temples plants, trees and stones. (In tabular form, for each constellation of the zodiac, a tradition of the connection of each constellation of the zodiac with a certain city, temple name, and the designations for wood and stones are dealt with.) AO6448 has drawings of the constellations Corvus and Virgo with the planet Mercury in attendance.
VAT 7847 (= VAN 784 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) contains drawings with names of stars/constellations. VAT 7847, Obverse. Constellation depiction on a Seleucid astrological tablet (from 2nd-century BCE Uruk). The depiction shows a lion standing on the back of a winged serpent. The two constellations depicted are Hydra and Leo. (They are shown "from the other side" - facing left instead of right.) The eight-pointed star to

VAT 7847 is a part of a larger tablet that had broken into two parts. The join for VAT 7847 appeared in Textes cunéiformes du Louvre by François Thureau-Dangin, Tome XII (Tablettes d'Uruk, à l'usage des prêtres du temple d'Anu au temps des Séleucides), 1922, catalogued as AO 6448. VAT 7847 is in the State Museum, Berlin, and AO 6448 is in the Louvre Museum, Paris. Both sides show in their upper part drawings of labelled drawings of constellations. As a completed tablet VAT 7847 and AO 6448 form an astrological calendar. The text contains omens and hemerological predictions. The tablet deals with the Babylonian zodiac and depicts 12 divisions corresponding to the months and the signs of the zodiac and is concerned with lunar eclipses near zodiacal constellations. The tablet is dated to the Hellenistic period circa 200 BCE by one source and circa 323363 by Klaus Wagensonner, University of Oxford, and originates from Uruk (modern Warka).

The identification of the stars forming the Mesopotamian scheme of constellations is fairly certain for the zodiacal belt but becomes increasingly uncertain the further we move to the north or south of such. There are 5

tablets (comprising 3 types of sources) which aid our understanding, both descriptive and graphic, of how the Babylonians visualised the constellations.
Also, dot and line drawings of some of the constellations are preserved on the circular Neo-Assyrian planisphere K.8538 (dating perhaps to 650 BCE). Constellation figures are identifiable in 6 of the 8 sectors (i.e., the 6 undamaged sectors). Following Johannes Koch the stars and constellations shown are summarily identified as: (1) Libra, (2) [not identified], (3) Sirius (Arrow), (4) Pegasus + Andromeda (Field + Plough), (5) [not identified], (6) the Pleiades, (7) Gemini, (8) Hydra + Corvus + Virgo. (See Page 11-9 for a more detailed discussion.) This circular star map divides the night sky into 8 (equal) 45-degree sectors and illustrates the most prominent constellations. (The Pegasus-square (mul Aš-iku) formed by 4 bright stars is pictured in K 8538 as a triangle.) K 8538 is the sole source providing an iconographic representation of constellations.
Two tablets are descriptive sources. There is one published text from Assyria (8th–7th century BCE) that describes constellations in words (VAT 9428). Several of the constellations, including the Twins (mul.mas.tab.ba.gal.gal.la), Perseus (mul.su.gi), Cancer (mul.al.lu5), and Ursa Major (mul.mar.gid.da), are described star by star in an incomplete text (VAT 9428, a Neo-Assyrian text) from Assur. The complete text originally contained a systematic star by star description of the Babylonian constellations. Effectively the text describes how to draw the constellations. (VAT 9428 was first discussed by the Assyriologist Ernst Weidner in "Eine Beschreibung des Sternenhimmels aus Assur." (AfO, Band 4, 1927, Pages 73-85).) Paul-Alain Beaulieu recently (American Oriental Society, 209th Meeting, 1999) discussed two similar genre texts, both unpublished and both fragmentary, in the Yale Babylonian Collection. The larger text, dated to the year 97 of the Seleucid period, is MLC 1866, and the smaller fragment, undated but believed to also be from the Hellenistic period, is YBC 7831.
A recently identified Babylonian text (the GU text on BM 78161) describing lines of stars in the sky (perhaps meridian or azimuth related) describes that the Arrow star (Sirius) was visualised as being fired by a humanfigure, having an elbow and foot, from the Bow at Orion ("the faithful shepherd of Anu"). (BM 78161 dates between the seventh and fifth centuries BCE.) The tablet, though acquired by the British Museum in the late 19th-century, was only identified as being a star-list circa 1985 during preparation for the 8th volume of the British Museum's Catalogue of Babylonian Tablets. (In their book, Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999), Hermann Hunger and David Pingree explain that the Babylonian GU text arranges stars in so-called "strings" that lie along declination circles and therefore measure right-ascensions or time intervals, and the GU text also employs the stars of the zenith (ziqpu stars), which are also separated by given differences in right-ascension.) (The Babylonians circa 1000 BCE used a physical instrument known as a ziqpu (a type of pole). It is likely the ziqpu-stars obtained their name from this instrument. Both would entail the use of a vertical line to assist in making other observations. Ziqpu-stars are the means by which an observer observes the rising (and setting) of other stars.)
Note: The Babylonians used the ziqpu or pole (and astronomical instrument, basically a gnomon/polus), an upright split (separated) stick (stile), to measure shadow-lengths. Originally this pole was used as a crude transit instrument to make out the north-south orientation of buildings, later to secure an approximate idea of the altitude of stars. (See: Origins of Astrology by Jack Lindsay (1971, Page 69). See also the Babylonian astronomical/astrological compendium Mul.Apin.) No illustrations or examples of the Babylonian ziqpu have come down to us. However, we have examples of ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese gnomons.
Three tablets are graphic sources. One graphic representation is a fragmentary Assyrian "planisphere" (K 8538) recovered from the library of King Assurbanipal in Nineveh. Remaining on it are schematic drawings of six stars and constellations (i.e., the constellations depicted in each sector are drawn as dots (representing stars) connected by lines). Whether K 8538 with its drawings of constellations has an astronomical or rather a magical purpose, is disputed. Two astrological tablets from 2nd-century BCE Uruk are our only source of actual constellation drawings. (One of these tablets is in two fragments and is formed from VAT 7847 and AO 6448.) One of the two tablets (VAT 7851) shows the Pleiades, Moon and Taurus. The other of the two tablets (VAT 7847) (obverse side) shows Jupiter, Hydra and Leo. (Both Hydra and Leo are facing an 8-pointed star, Marduk (= Jupiter).) The constellation depiction on AO 6448 (forming the reverse side of the completed VAT
7847 + AO 6448 tablet (= TCL 6, 12)) shows Mercury (the eight-pointed star captioned dingirGUD.UD), Virgo and Corvus (the Raven) (standing on the tail of Hydra). The name AB.SIN engraved on the drawing (above the star to the left) denotes either the zodiacal sign Virgo or the brightest star Spica in the constellation Virgo.
Drawings of zodiacal constellations are also found on many seal impressions from Hellenistic Uruk.

A Ziqpu-Star Planisphere from Sippar, dated to the 1st millennium BCE, largely preserves on the outer ring of its obverse side both star-names and dots (representing the stars comprising the ziqpu-star constellations.). See: "Tablets From the Sippar Library IX. A Ziqpu-Star Planisphere." by Horowitz and Al-Rawi (Iraq, Volume LXIII, 2001).
Additionally, the Bull of Heaven (Taurus) is drawn on an esoteric tablet dated to the Seleucid era. See: Textes cunéiformes du Louvre by François Thureau-Dangin, Tome VI (Tablettes d'Uruk, à l'usage des prêtres du temple d'Anu au temps des Séleucides), (Plate 91), 1922. (The plate is reproduced in Astrological Reports to Assyrian Kings by Hermann Hunger (1992), Page 40.)
Bull of Heaven (Taurus) drawn on an esoteric tablet (= diagram of Kettledrum Ritual) dated to the Seleucid era (from Tablettes d'Uruk by François Thureau-Dangin (1922)). The kettledrum was made of bronze and covered with the skin of a bull. The kettledrum ritual is mentioned in texts dating to the Neo-Assyrian period (8th – 7th centuries BCE) and the Hellenistic period but it may be much older. The drum was used by temple exorcists in religious ceremonies as a means of averting the anger of the gods/goddesses.
"[W]e can test the extent to which some Babylonian constellations taken over by the Greeks retained their original shapes by comparing the data in the GU text with those in Ptolemy's star catalogue (Almagest VIIVIII)" (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1999, Page 97). (The GU text (BM 78161) containing star names, likely recovered from Babylon or Sippar and dating between the 7th- and 5th-century BCE, is divided into 20 sections by the Sumerian word GU (meaning "string") which concludes each section of text (written on both obverse and reverse sides of the tablet).) The Mesopotamian arrangement of constellations has survived to the present day because it became the basis of a numerical reference scheme the ecliptic.

Publisher's description: "This book presents a newly recovered group of cuneiform texts from first millennium Babylonia and Assyria that provide prose descriptions of the drawing (eseru) of Mesopotamian constellations. The group describes these constellations in terms of their parts: body parts for constellations in human or animal form, parts of a wagon for "The Wagon" and "The Wagon of Heaven" (the Big and Little Dipper), and so forth. The descriptions also typically speak of the clothing that constellations in human form wear, their beards if they are male, and paraphernalia that they hold or carry. In the case of "The Crab" and "The Wagon," there is also reference to the Babylonian geometric

shape apsamakku, a four-sided figure. The tablets include descriptions of the celestial constellations Cancer, Pisces, Pegasus, Perseus, and many others, and focus on their parts: body parts for constellations in human or animal form; parts of a wagon for 'The Wagon' and 'Wagon of Heaven' (the Big and Little Dipper). The depictions also typically speak of the clothing that constellations in human form wear, their beards if they are male, and paraphernalia that they hold or carry. A typical passage reads in translation: The True Shepherd of Anu (i.e., Orion) ... is a human figure, clothed, bearded, supplied with a kurkuru-container(?), and grasping a lock and key. The Twins (i.e., Gemini), who stand in front of the True Shepherd of Anu..., are two human figures, clothed. The front figure is bearded, the back figure has the face of (the demon) Latarak; they carry a large jug in their right hands. The celestial body that stands below the True Shepherd of Anu is the Rooster (Lepus).
In 1927, Ernst Weidner published an article in Archiv für Orientforschung (vol. 4, pp. 73-85) that presented a most interesting tablet from Assur in Neo-Assyrian script, describing how to draw a number of the Mesopotamian constellations. For most of the 20th century this remained a unique member of the cuneiform corpus. In the 1990s, working independently, Paul-Alain Beaulieu identified three more exemplars of the same type of text in the tablet collections of Yale University, and Wayne Horowitz identified another exemplar at The British Museum, thus giving us a group of five tablets of the type published by Weidner. John Britton, who knew of Beaulieu's work on the Yale exemplars, met with Dr. Horowitz in 2005. The result was to be a joint publication of the group. John Steele agreed to take the place of John Britton as the project’s astronomical expert after Britton's untimely death and Eckart Frahm of Yale University later joined the author collaboration."

2. BM 91899. Amulet with divine symbols.
Appendix 2: The Origin and Date of the Constellation Taurus
Dates in the 3rd millennium BCE are commonly given for the existence of constellation Taurus. However, this is based on an interpretation of the bull in early literary epics and iconography. The name of the "Bull of Heaven" (mul gu4.an.na) in the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven has the same name as the bull constellation Taurus. Bulls appear on cylinder seal iconography (Sumerian and Akkadian Period 32002000 BCE), and Babylonian boundary-stone (kudurru) iconography (Cassite Period 1530-1160 BCE). However, it not established that constellations or constellation symbols are being depicted. It is established that - at least in the case of kudurru - god/goddess symbols are depicted. 'Prayer to the gods of the night' texts (Old Babylonian Period 1830-1530 BCE) list a bison, not a bull. It is unlikely that bison = bull. (Bison lived in the hilly flanks of the Mesopotamian low-land.) The Star-List from Boghazköy (VAT 7445) lists 2 asterisms forming part of the later constellation Taurus. The tablet VAT 7445 (published in KUB, Volume 4, Number 47) recovered from Boghazköy (the capital of the Hittite empire) in the early 19th-century, preserves a Hittite prayer/haruspicy ritual (based on the Old Babylonian Period Prayer to the Gods of the Night) that enumerates 17 stars/constellations (belonging to the path of Ea). VAT 7445 is dated to circa 1300/1200 BCE. It is possible that the Boghazköy prayer/haruspicy ritual and star-list was earlier than the "astrolabe texts." Two constellations/asterisms listed include (1) MUL.MUL ["The Stars" = The Pleiades.] and (2) is le-e [The Jaws of

the Bull.]. It could be argued that Taurus is indicated as existing through these asterism names, however, the assurance is not certain. The constellation GU4.AN.NA (the Bull) first appears in entirety in Astrolabe B (at the
end of the Kassite Period circa 1100 BCE), and the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil (consolidated circa 1100 BCE). Also, the star lists forming the Mul.Apin series (dated on statistical grounds by Brad Schaefer to circa late 2nd millennium BCE).
Appendix 3: Babylonian Catasterisms
"Line 17 [Old Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night]: Qaštum, "bow." Here qaštum refers to the Bow constellation, probably part of Canis Major .... This constellation features prominently in Enūma eliš as Marduk's prized weapon, which is installed in the sky and adopted by Anu as his own daughter (VI 82–91). That passage is a rare example of catasterism in Mesopotamian literature. (See also Astrolabe B B1:14–16 [KAV 218] and MUL.APIN I ii 7.) (Cooley, Jeffrey. (2011). "An OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night." In: Lenzi, Alan. (Editor). Reading Akkadian Prayers and Hymns. (Page 77).)" In detail: The goddess Istar, daughter of Anu, was identified with the heavenly Bow as a result of the declaration by Anu in Tablet VI of Enuma Elis (The Creation). In Enuma Elis, Marduk fashions a bow, designates it as his weapon (IV 35), and defeats Tiamat with it (IV, 101); later Anu lifts it up, kisses it, calls it "my daughter (= Istar of Elam)," and fixes it as a constellation in the sky (VI 82-92). The constellation of the "Bow Star," adopted by Anu as his daughter, is Canis Minor (the Bow likely comprised: δ, ε, σ, ω Canis Minor and κ Puppis). In Astrolabe B (KAV 218 B i 14–16), the Bow-star is identified as Istar of Elam and called the daughter of Anu. Istar represents the Bow Star; specifically qastu (Akkadian), a star in the constellation Canis Minor).
Appendix 4: The GU Text (BM 78161)
Tablet BM 78161 (dated circa between 7th and 5th centuries BCE) lists (Ziqpu) stars grouped in over 20 strings. Each "string" (gu) contains 2 to 4 stars arranged along a declination circle.
The recently identified (circa 1980s?) Babylonian GU Text is preserved on tablet BM 78161 and is dated to the period between the 7th and the 5th centuries BCE (700/500 BCE). Its precise provenance was not recorded at time of excavation it was likely recovered in the area of Babylon or Sippar. The Babylonian GU text (1) arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time intervals, and also (2) employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences. BM 78161 is a collection of star names (a star catalogue), organized in. (at least) 20 sections, each section ending with the word GU, a string. Except for the first and last sections the GU Text contains (a) either the name of a ziqpu star or a time interval; (b) one or more star names; and (c) the word GU. The GU Text lists/arranges lines of stars in the sky in so-called "strings" that are perhaps meridian or azimuth related. In their book, Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999), Hermann Hunger and David Pingree explain the Babylonian GU text arranges stars in so-called "strings" that lie along declination circles and therefore measure right-ascensions or time intervals, and the GU text also employs the stars of the zenith (ziqpu stars), which are also separated by given differences in right-ascension. The so-called Dalbanna-Text/DAL.BA.AN.NA Text (a Mesopotamian star-list), combines several stars into a "string." Fragment exemplars, known for almost 100 years, (mostly?) form part of the Kouyunjik collection in the British Museum. (One exemplar is from Babylon.) The so-called Dalbanna-Text also mentions "straight, taut strings" (GU SI-SA DUB-BA), also "slack strings." Christopher Walker has remarked the "star-list is distinct in character from the other known texts of this genre." Unfortunately the meaning of terms used in the text are difficult to understand.
Appendix 5: Ziqpu-stars
Accadian term Ziqpu = 'upright stars'. Ziqpu-stars are the means by which an observer observes the rising (and setting) of other stars. There are approximately 30 ziqpu-stars. The Accadian word ziqpu is used in astronomical contexts to refer to the highest point 'culmination' of a celstial body. Ziqpu-stars are stars which culminated near the meridian (centre/middle of the sky) when viewed from Assyria or Babylonia. They were used to measure the intervals between these culminations (i.e., ziqpu intervals) as an aid to time-keeping and maintaining the calendar. Ziqpu-stars were a system of 'secondary' stars which culminated (crossed the meridian) at the same time as the more fundamental stars (stars by whose position time and calendar were calculated) were heliacally rising on the eastern horizon. The ziqpu-stars aided a more reliable measure of time when the horizon was obscured by atmospheric turbulence or dust. Ziqpu-stars were stars "so chosen that one crosses the meridian before dawn, in the middle of each month, as another constellation is rising heliacally." (See: Mul.Apin by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1989) Page 142.) The ziqpu-stars were useful if, for



2022. 02. 21. 19:49 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20211217130957/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-10.html 11/11
whatever reason, the eastern horizon was obscured and the heliacal rising of important stars was unable to be directly observed. The most common version of the ziqpu-star list contained 25 stars (but apparently there was no canonical list). The Babylonians circa 1000 BCE used a physical instrument known as a ziqpu (a type of pole). It is likely the ziqpu-stars obtained their name from this instrument. Both would entail the use of a vertical line to assist in making other observations. The use of culminating stars to keep track of time dates to at least the early 1st-millennium BCE, but may predate this period. See the extended explanations in: Rising Time Schemes in Babylonian Astronomy by John Steele (2017. Page 13); and In the Path of the Moon by Francesca Rochberg (2010 Page 291).
Note: Normal stars = a group of reference stars. Babylonian 'Normal Stars' were used as reference points in the sky to track the movement of the moon and planets. There are instances of normal stars being used as ziqpu stars. Modern scholarship has compiled a list of 32 Normal Stars distributed unevenly in a band of about 20 degrees width around the ecliptic.
Appendix 6: Difficulty of constellation identification
As an example of the difficulty of constellation identification: (1) Franz Kugler (SSB. Ergän. II. Teil (1914)) identifies (Northern Path of Enlil) ĸ. AN-KU-A-MEŠ (an-dur-a-meš) šú-ut E-kur -- Ophiuchus - Southern portion of Ophiuchus is named ĸ. il Za-mà-mà; (2) In the 10-Star Text AO 6769 (Old Babylonian period circa 1900 BCE) it has been tentatively suggested the Bison = Capricorn (or Ophiuchus / Serpens?) but see Hunger/Pingree, Astral Sciences, 1999, Pages 108-109; (3) Hunger/Pingree (Mul.Apin (1989) identify Zababa (Central Path of Anu) with parts of Ophiuchus. It is indicated that in the developing Babylonian uranography constellations came and went before the scheme eventually became fixed. However, there is no evidence of a canonical list of Mesopotamian constellations. The sign/word MUL, the Sumerian determinative for 'star,' was also generally used to denote all other astral phenomena. There is no exclusive word for constellation. This use/application of MUL in multiple ways is a reason why the identification of star names/constellations remains elusive.

BM 92687 (82-7-14, 509) "Mappa Mundi." Babylonian "map of the world" in the British Museum, London. The tablet measures 122 millimetres x 82 millimetres (4.75 inches x 3.25 inches). There is a mix of Babylonian mythology and geography depicted on the map. (This photograph of the map was likely taken prior to some small fragments being rejoined by Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum (currently (2016) Assistant Keeper of Ancient Mesopotamian script.) The so-called Babylonian "map of the world" is a rare visual (graphic) depiction of the world. It is the single example of an ancient Mesopotamian world map. The earth is depicted in the drawing and the heavens are treated principally in the accompanying text. (The text on the reverse is divided into 9 sections comprising 27 lines of text.) The world in this map is conceived of as a disk (i.e., as circular and flat). Irving Finkel (2014) states: "It is one of the most remarkable cuneiform tablets ever discovered ...." Francesca Rochberg (2012) states: "Its provenance is uncertain but its British Museum catalog number [BM 92687], and the onomastics of the scribe who copied the tablet point to the city of Borsippa. (One source states it was most likely recovered from Sippar.) The hole in the centre is probably the place where one leg of the compass was fixed. (Curved lines are rare on cuneiform tablets but in this case it is obvious a compass was used.) Above the central hole, an oblong shape is marked "Babylon"and has 2 lines running through it from north to south, perhaps depicting the 2 banks of the river Euphrates. This river takes its rise from the north-west mountains and runs into the oblong marsh or swamp in the south. Around the city of Babylon are located the known lands within the area surrounded by a circular outer ocean/great river. Some cities and lands are indicated by circles. (Within the centre of the map are 7 labelled areas that may represent cities.) To the right of Babylon, Assyria is situated, and north of it Armenia. There are (were) 7 triangles ("islands") pointing outward from the edges of the surrounding ocean/great river. The top section is a cuneiform inscription describing the various regions, plus great kings and heroes (king Sargon and the hero Utnapishtim who survived the flood and who attained immortality) and mythical beasts/monsters. This literary section is incomplete due to damage. However, it obviously sets out an imagined cosmical landscape. Note: To right is reverse of the world map tablet per British Museum. The bottom of the obverse side is simply flipped over.

(1) The Babylonian "map of the world"
BM 92687 (82-7-14, 509) "Mappa Mundi" is a Babylonian "map of the world" in the British Museum, London. The term "Mappa Mundi" is derived from it best matching the category of medieval period maps termed "mappamundi." Medieval "mappamundi" typically show a spherical world picture encircled by the "ocean sea." The tablet contains a diagrammatic image of the world as conceived late 8th- or 7th-century BCE, and a written description. (Wayne Horowitz has pointed out that the description written to accompany the map has an integral,

but complicated relation to it.) The "Mappa Mundi" is the earliest extant map having such a wide scope. Earlier known maps are limited to local areas (immediate environment), town maps, etc. The earliest cuneiform map discovered is a regional map dating to the late 3rd-millennium BCE. (The earliest examples of historical maps originate in the ancient Near East. A coherent tradition of Mesopotamian cartography is not evident.) The map is unique from other Mesopotamian maps because it is not merely local but international in its scope, and contains features that appear to indicate a cosmological intention. Rochberg (2012, Pages 33-34) writes: "The historical and literary references in the description accompanying the map resonate with the historical and cosmical atmosphere of its iconographic representation of the world." Typically for Mesopotamian maps, it is drawn as if looking down from above. Also, it is not drawn to scale. It is not of course a surveyed and measured image. Unfortunately, the tablet is badly damaged. The clay tablet is 12.2 cm tall. The map occupies two-thirds of the obverse. (The actual map is only 8 cm by 8 cm in size.) The remainder of the obverse and the entire reverse contain related textual information. The actual map is considered enigmatic in its implications regarding content and scale. However, it confirms that the ancient Mesopotamians believed that the earth's surface consisted of 3 main components: a central continent, a cosmic sea, and land(s) across the sea. (The Babylonians at least believed that a cosmic ocean encircled the continental portion of the earth's surface.) Texts provide little information about the distant lands across the seas at the far reaches of the earth's surface. The map was composed in Babylonia and is the only Babylonian map drawn on an international scale. It includes the local geographic environment and also attempts to depict quite distant regions i.e., as triangular "regions" beyond the sea and the limits of empirical knowledge. Its provenance and date of composition is uncertain. The tablet is placed within the 82-7-14 collection at the British Museum. This particular collection primarily comes from Sippar. (It has been usual to state it was excavated in 1881 by Hormuzd Rassam while excavating a site near the ancient Babylonian city of Sippar. Rassam, who could not read cuneiform, did not realise it was a map. It was not until the late 20th-century that cuneiform scholars at the British Museum deciphered the tablet's text.) However, because it has been given the out-of-sequence number 509 within the 82-7-14 collection this suggests it is not from Sippar. The colophon information suggests the tablets actually comes from Borsippa. It is usually stated it is a Neo-Babylonian (Persian Period, circa 500 BCE) copy of an original dating to the Sargonid Period, circa late 8th- or 7th-century BCE. In his 1998 discussion Wayne Horowitz states on philological grounds the World Map tablet can be dated to between the 9th- and the 7th-century BCE. (The map at least is no older than the 9th-century BCE.) From the colophon information again it is known that there was at least one earlier map. Whether BM 92687 represents older concepts is difficult to say.
The actual meaning behind the content of the map is uncertain and subject to scholarly dispute. It has been thought that the map was intended to convey the entire contents of the world.Wayne Horowitz writes (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, (1998, Page 40): "The emphasis on distant places in the texts accompanying the map suggests that the purpose of BM 92687 was to locate and describe distant regions. The map illustrated where these distant areas were located in relation to familiar locales, such as Babylon, Assyria, and the Euphrates. The obverse related these distant places to familiar literary figures and exotic animals, and the reverse conditions in far-away regions. The ancient author's interest in distant places reflects a general interest in distant areas during the first half of the first millennium, when the Assyrian and Babylonian empires reached their greatest extents." Also (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, (1998, Page 42): "... it is possible that geometric conventions, as well as cosmographic traditions, influenced the development of The Babylonian Map of the World."
The map is unique in its inclusion of the regions/islands beyond the ocean. The ocean was most usually considered the end of all lands. 7/8 triangular areas labelled as 'Regions' or 'Islands' surround the Ocean (Bitter Water/Salt Sea). These triangular areas are labelled with distances, descriptions of the regions, and descriptions of great heroes and mythical beasts that live in each region. The 18 mythological beasts mentioned in the writing on the map allude to the so-called Babylonian Epic of Creation where the new world was created after the mythological animals were expelled to the 'Heavenly Ocean.'
The German assyriologist Felix Peiser, during a stay in London to access tablets in the British Museum, came across the tablet. Johann Strassmaier made a drawing of the tablet for Felix Peiser to publish in his article Eine babylonische Landkarte (ZA, Band 4, 1889, Pages 361-370). (At least one source mistakenly states the article as a book title published 1899.) The clay tablet is a drawing and textual description of the Babylonian cosmos. It is now concluded that it is oriented to the north-west. However, no directions are actually indicated on the map. (It is uncertain whether the accompanying cuneiform text was composed together with the map. Rochberg (2012), relying on Horowitz (1988) writes: "It has an integral, but complicated, relation to the image.") It is the only known map of the world dating from the Neo-Babylonian Period. All other maps have a purely local focus.
Wayne Horowitz states: "In 1906, R. C. Thompson re-copied the tablet as CT 22, 48. This second copy served as the basis for later studies by E. F. Weidner in BoSt 6 (1922), 85–93 and E. Unger in Unger, Babylon, 254–8 (1931)." Wayne Horowitz also points out: "Unfortunately, neither the early copy by Peiser, nor CT 22, 48, is



2022. 02. 21. 19:54 History of Constellation and Star Names

completely reliable. The two copies disagree on a number of points, and a new collation of the tablet revealed a number of errors. For instance, Peiser drew two nagū at the bottom of the map which are omitted in CT 22, 48, and both copyists read the label in the lowest oval inside the circle (no. 8) sideways!" (According to Irving Finkel in The Ark Before Noah (2014), a lost nagū has recently been located by a volunteer worker at the British Museum. Portions of 5 nagū are preserved on the World Map, and are located across the circular ocean, and 8 nagū are described on the reverse side of the tablet.
The map depicts a "bird's-eye" view of the world (the world as seen from above) and shows a flat, round world with the city of Babylon in the centre. (Circa 500 BCE Babylon was still a flourishing city and regarded as the centre (i.e., the "hub") of the world. In the 3rd millennium BCE Nippur was considered to be the city at the centre of the world.) It is likely that the Sumerians made the city of Nippur the centre of the universe (a Sumerian Rome) from about 2300 BCE (just prior to the Ur III Period). Political supremacy was regarded as conditional on the possession of Nippur. With the rise to political supremacy of the Babylonian kings, from the early 2ndmillennium onwards, it was possible for Babylon to claim the central position and replace Nippur as the centre of the universe. Note: During the reign of Assunasirpal II (883-859 BCE) and Sargon II (722-705 BCE) the ideology of Babylon as the new Nippur, the centre of the world and the linchpin of heaven and the underworld was formed.
The map depicts the world as two concentric circles, with triangular areas/projections (most likely 7 or 8 when complete) radiating outwards from the outer of the 2 circles. The area of the map within the inner circle represents the central continental area of the Earth's surface where Babylon and Assyria are located (= the oikumene (the known part of the inhabited world)). The continent is surrounded by the circle of salty ocean (designated as the "Bitter River"). The area/band between the two circles represents the (earthly) circumambulating cosmic (?) ocean (or great river). (The circular body of water is called the id marratu ("the Salt (Bitter) River").) The area beyond the outer circle (i.e., outside the ocean) consists of the triangular areas, which are the uncharted distant transoceanic regions, or distant region across or associated with the sea in Babylonian texts. Only 5 of these triangles survived of the original 7 or 8. However, further damaged has occurred to these. (The several (originally 7?/8?) outer triangular 'distant unspecified regions' or 'islands' are called nagū. The term nagū has the sense of "island.") The mythical 7 (or 8) regions/islands are depicted as equal triangles, only 2 of which are now completely preserved. The text on the reverse describes 8 nagū and there is room for this number.
The continent on the map contains various geometric shapes representing places and topographic features. The place names include the countries of Assyria (indicated north-east of Babylon), Urartu (Armenia) (indicated north of Assyria), the land of Habban (South Yemen) (indicated south-west of Babylon) and the city of Babylon. (Wayne Horowitz identifies that the kingdom of Urartu is placed among the most important places of the ancient world.) (In some descriptions it is stated the map is labelled with Babylonia, Assyria, and Elam.) The topographic features include a mountain, a swamp, and a channel. (The mountains are located at the top, in the north.) Babylon is represented by a large rectangle encompassing almost half the width of the central continent. Assyria is represented as a small oval. (Various nameless places are also indicated by ovals.) The Euphrates River is shown originating in the mountains at the top of the map, running through Babylon, and flowing into the marshes at the bottom of the map. (A curved line near the top shows the Zagros Mountains and the southern marshes are indicated at the bottom of the map by 2 parallel lines.) The map schematically portrays the entire kingdom of Babylonia. The text contains the names of countries and cities but, on the reverse side, the text is largely concerned with a description of the 7 (or 8) unnamed outer regions ("islands") which are depicted in the form of equal triangles rising beyond the encircling earthly (cosmic?) ocean. Some parts of the map cannot be identified. As example: According to Wayne Horowitz thinks the crescent-shaped area extending from the east bank of the Euphrates River may represent either an arm of the ocean separating southern Babylonia from Elam, or might be an arm of the Euphrates River, a canal, or even a road.
Rochberg (2012) relying on Horowitz (1998) writes: "Circles represent cities ... and parallel lines rivers. The largest demarcated area, shown as a rectangle on the upper central portion, is Babylon, the point of view from which the map was presumably made. Also on the map are the states of Urartu and Assyria .... The cities of Der and Susa and the territory of Bit Yakin are included. The regions, cities, and other geographic features such as the swamp and the water channel are all arranged inside a circle bounded by the waters of the ocean, designated as the "Bitter River" around the entire circling band."
There is text accompanying some parts of the map. The text (on both sides of the tablet) shows that the map attempts to depict the entire world. The emphasis on distant places in the text accompanying the map indicates that the likely purpose of the map was to locate and describe distant regions. The text of the reverse of the tablet describe the "7 islands" (8 islands?) in detail. (From the paucity of the information given it is evident that the Babylonians knew little about these "islands." Mostly, the description given is mostly about their various degrees of brightness.) From the text on the reverse of the tablet, and the inscriptions on the map itself, it can be

determined that the first "island" lay in the south-east. the second "island" lay in the south-west, and so on, so that the sequence of the "islands" is somewhat analogous with the hands of a modern clock. The descriptions of the first and second outer regions are not preserved. (The Babylonians, like many ancient peoples, believed that distant lands were home to legendary beasts, strangely formed peoples, and mysterious natural phenomena.)
Other textual sources describe the earthly ocean as being enclosed by a double range of mountains, those to the east and those to the west (the "sunrise" and "sunset" range, respectively.
The orientation of the map proved to be unclear to early investigators. More recent analysis seems to have clarified the issue. The map has a definite orientation - it is inclined. The orientation is such that the top of the map corresponds to the northwest. Thus the Babylonian system of orientation did not follow the perpendicular plane - north, west, south, and east - of our Western cardinal points. The Babylonian system of orientation was based upon the prevalent winds. The northwest wind was sent from the goddess Ishtar and was a favourable wind.
For a detailed early discussion of the Babylonian world map see "From Cosmos Picture to the World Map." by Eckhard Unger (Imago Mundi, Volume 2, 1937, Pages 1-7). A detailed recent discussion of the Babylonian world map is by Irving Finkel in The Ark Before Noah (2014). Irving Finkel dates the cosmological system set out on the Babylonian world map to the Old Babylonian period in the 2nd-millennium BCE.
"The most important element is the drawing, which takes up the lower two-thirds of the obverse. (Wayne Horowitz states the drawing occupies the lower half of the obverse.) It is a brilliantly accomplished piece of work. The known world is depicted from far above as a disc surrounded by a ring of water called marratu in Akkadian. Two concentric circles were drawn in with some cuneiform precursor of a pair of compasses whose point was actually inserted south of Babylon, perhaps the city of Nippur, the 'Bond of Heaven and Earth'. Within the circle the heartland of Mesopotamia is depicted in schematic form. The broad Euphrates River runs from top to bottom, originating in the northern mountainous areas and losing itself in canals and marshes in the south. The great river is straddled by Babylon .... [A] ... great ring of water ... surrounds everything, while even further beyond is a ring of vast mountains that marks the rim of the world. These mountains are projected as flat, projecting triangles; each is called a nagū. Originally they numbered eight." (Irving Finkel, The Ark Before Noah (2014; Pages 262263).)
It has been pointed out that the Babylonian world map deals with a mythologised landscape, not any actual scientific physical geography. As example: The text refers to the "ruined gods" who are likely the 11 composite beings of Tiamat defeated by Marduk in the Enuma Elish.
For a complete description and account of the "Mappa Mundi," see: Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, (1998), Pages 20–42.
The pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaximander (circa 610-circa 546) who lived in the Ionian city of Miletus was a pioneering cartographer who also drew a map of the world. (The Babylonian map of the earth is approximately contemporary with Anaximander's world map. Anaximander's map being made at a slightly later date). Unfortunately a specimen of his map has not come down to us. The method of mapmaking introduced by Anaximander replaced the Babylonian and Egyptian traditions of making maps of the earth. (It excluded mythical elements. The Babylonian and Egyptian maps may be characterized as a mixture of mythological and symbolical or schematic features.) Although his representation of a flat earth still remained within the limits of the archaic world picture, it may be concluded that Anaximander created a new paradigm in geographical mapmaking. An early Egyptian world map that has survived is drawn on a 4th-century BCE (30th dynasty) Egyptian coffin. On this picture, the goddess of the heaven, Nut, arches over the world that is carried by two arms making the ka sign. There is also a depiction of an encircling Ocean. Inside the Ocean is a ring with the names of the neighbouring countries, then a ring with the hieroglyphs of the Egyptian districts, and in the innermost circle the underworld is represented. Neither the Babylonian world map nor the Egyptian world map have a geographical meaning. They both have only a religious or mythological meaning. (The triangular "mountains" outside the Bitter River on the Babylonian map, and the goddess Nut arching over the world on the Egyptian map are considered essential features of these maps.) Moreover, the Babylonian and Egyptian world maps maps do not show contours of lands and seas (apart from the depiction of the encircling Ocean). There are only a few schematic lines on the Babylonian world map, and a list of geographical names on the Egyptian world map.
Appendix: There is a limited knowledge of Mesopotamian understanding of geography. The so-called Sargon Geography traditions (modern name) are known from 2 texts. The main text is the Neo-Assyrian VAT8006 (KAV 92) found in 1910 at Assur, and also the Neo-Babylonian duplicate BM 64382 (82-9-18, 4361), which duplicates

(overlaps) lines 23-47 of the main Neo-Assyrian text (the last 25 lines) and has 14 additional lines (lines 23-61). The exact date and provenance of the Neo-Babylonian tablet are unknown. The Sargon Geography is composed basically of lists of place-names (and in one section the names of peoples, such as the Amorites) interspersed with information relating to the reign of Sargon of Akkad. Though both texts date to the 1st-millennium BCE, Wayne Horowitz states that some traditions may date to locations that were important circa the Old Babylonian period. Wayne Horowitz (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, (1998, Page 93) states: "Sargon's empire in The Sargon Geography, excluding the lands across the seas, corresponds to the continent on the World Map."
(2) The levels of the Babylonian universe
The longest single extant account of the building of the Babylonian universe is found in the 7 tablet epic Enuma Elish. The Babylonian Enuma Elish sets out a political cosmology i.e., (1) a theogony culminating in the victory of Marduk, and (2) connecting civil order to kingship. Human kingship is a reflection of divine kingship and the earthly king is the earthly keeper of order and justice. In this epic poem the god Marduk constructs heaven and earth (but not the underworld) from the body of Tiamat, and organises some other features of the universe such as fashioning the cosmic bonds between heaven, earth, and the Apsu, and the building of Babylon. From the Enuma Elis account it appears that the Apsu already exists when Marduk separates heaven and earth. A number of other Sumerian and Akkadian texts preserve lengthy and brief accounts of creation. In the earliest of these texts the creators/rulers of the universe are the gods Anu, Enlil, and Enki/Ea. In later texts the creator god is Marduk.
The assyriologist Wilfred Lambert (1926-2011) and Wayne Horowitz have pointed out there is no direct evidence that the ancient Mesopotamians thought the visible heavens comprised a (solid) dome. They had no clear word for sphere or dome. The ancient Babylonians viewed the cosmos as a series of flat, superimposed layers of the same size separated by space, held together by ropes (cosmic bonds).
Basically, they had 6 superimposed levels of the universe, 3 heavens and 3 earths (but some texts indicate slightly greater detail. The vertical levels of the (generalised) Mesopotamian (Sumero-Akkadian) universe are indicated as:
Region Above the Heaven of Anu (See: The Etana Epic, Section B 30-43) (Open space implied by The Etana Epic)
Upper Heaven (High Heaven) of Anu (Highest Region of the Universe)
Middle Heaven (Intermediate High Heaven) of (300) Igigi (One source assigns 300 Igigi to the Upper Heaven)
Lower Heaven of the (Visible) Sky (Stars, Planets, Sun, and Moon) (Thought to be circular in shape)
The "Atmosphere" (Either not specifically listed (not considered a separate level of the universe) or identified as Part of Visible Sky (Lower Heaven); or Separate Geographical Level)
Upper Earth (Humankind, The Level of the Earth's Surface (Dry Land and Sea))
Middle Earth, Apsu of Ea (Enki/Ea) (Cosmic Subterranean Water)
Lower Earth, Underworld of Nergal (King) and Ereškigal (Queen) (Realm of the Dead) (Lowest Region of the Universe) (300/600 Anunnaki are locked in the Lower Earth/Underworld)
The existing accounts of Mesopotamian cosmology are rather limited. Unfortunately they are also conflicting. (The 2 key tablets are KAR 307 and AO 8196.) For a detailed discussion of Mesopotamian cosmology, including the Babylonian world map, see Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998). Babylonian cosmology distinguished 3 heavens. The lower two only were considered to be visible to humankind: the heaven of Enlil, where the main god Marduk/Bel had his particular dwelling, and the heaven of Ea, or lower sky on which the movements of the stars and planets could be observed. The mystical religious text KAR 307 states that the sky (the lowest of the 3 heavens) is made of jasper (modern jasper is generally opaque but in ancient descriptions jasper is often described as translucent), the middle heaven above the sky is made of saggilmud-stone (a variety of the blue lapis-lazuli), and the upper heavens (the heaven of Anu) are made of luludānītu-stone. Jasper from Persia was sky blue. Generally, the Mesopotamian accounts of the structure of the universe remained constant throughout the approximate 2500 years from the earliest evidence to the end of cuneiform writing. Some change in Mesopotamian conceptions of the universe did occur as Mesopotamian astronomy improved. No text deals with the bounds of the physical universe or what might exist beyond the described structure/limits of the universe. It was believed that the floor of the Middle Heaven could be seen through the floor of the Lower



2022. 02. 21. 19:54 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20201030194138/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-11.html 12/44
Heaven. It was also believed that nothing existing above the blue saggilmud-stone floor could be seen (i.e., the residences of the gods/goddesses and the Upper Heaven).
The Sumerian cosmological account, The Duties and Powers of the Gods sets out the distinction between the (300) Igigi (the great gods) of the heavens and the Anunnaki of the underworld.
(3) The physical structure of the heavenly regions
Cuneiform texts of the 1st millennium BCE record a tradition of 3 superimposed heavenly realms. The High Heaven belonged to the god Anu and was also the abode of 300 Igigi or great gods. The Middle Heaven belonged to the Igigi, and Marduk also had his throne there. The stars and constellations were drawn (etched) directly upon the surface of the Lower Heaven. It is indicated that all astronomical activity takes place in the lower heavens. (Invocations to 7 heavens and 7 earths occurring in Sumerian incantations have magical than cosmological significance and are not related to the 3 heavens and 3 earths found in other texts.) The texts recording a cosmological picture of 3 heavens also contain poetic speculation about the heavens being made of different stones of varying colours. (It is to be assumed that what is meant is the floors of each level of the heavens were composed of a different type and colour of stone, and that there was open space between each stone floor, just as there is open space between the level of the Upper Earth and the Lower Heaven. Also to be assumed is each stone floor was visible from below and served as a roof for the region below. See: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Page 9).) The High Heaven of Anu was reddish, speckled with white and black; the Middle Heaven was blue like lapis lazuli; the Lower Heaven was translucent jasper, either blue or grey. This concept is not an attempt at empirical description but has a likely connection with mythological and/or other associations between stones and gods. The statement that the stars were drawn, or inscribed as 'writing,' upon the stone surface of the heavens is also poetic. This metaphor stressed the meaning of the stars as signs 'written' by the gods for people to observe and use to make forecasts about the future. In literary/mythological texts the term 'firmament' (and sometimes the term 'base of heaven') is used to denote the celestial realm of the planetary deities.
The term 'sky,' not 'firmament,' was used in the terminology of astronomical texts to refer to the place where celestial phenomena were observable. Both celestial divination and astronomical texts required a terminology to specify the positions and times for the occurrence of celestial phenomena. A variety of systems denoted celestial positions (without the use of the conception of the celestial sphere and its coordinates). A major frame of reference was the horizon. The 3 systems of importance were: (1) The 3 'paths.' The terminology of the 'paths' of Anu, Enlil, and Ea was used in early astronomical texts. The path of the god Anu had its gate in the center of the 'cattle pen,' or eastern horizon; the path of the god Ea lay to the south, and the path of the god Enlil lay to the north. The stars may have been associated with the gods Anu, Ea, and Enlil even earlier than the establishment of the path system, but were assigned to these paths according to where on the horizon their risings were observed (= according to their circles of declination, the distance north or south of the celestial equator). (2) Another system implied to denote celestial positions is implied in the device called a 'string.' The Babylonian GU text on BM 78161 arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and therefore measure right-ascensions or time intervals. A 'string' established a relation between stars of similar right ascensions that crossed the meridian at the same time. (3) The other 'path' of importance was 'the path of the moon,' marked by 17/18 constellations, and used at least by circa 750 BCE. The 17/18 constellations in 'the path of the moon' were unequal in size and could not be used as a standard of reference for the calculation of 'distance' along 'the path of the moon.'
(Mul.Apin tablet 1 describes the Path of Sin (= the way of the Moon) which crossed the boundaries between the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. This referred to 17/18 constellations/stars marking the path of the Moon ("gods standing on the path of the moon."). It was a fixed path in the sky. (When the ecliptic started to become a primary reference line the 17/18 (depending on how you interpret the list) constellations/stars marking the path of the Moon were basically formed out of the "three stars each" (i.e., monthly calendar star) system of menologies and other constellations/stars were added.))
Later, these 17/18 constellations were reduced to 12 to form the basis for the zodiac, to mark the passage of the sun with respect to the fixed stars through the months of the year. Because the planets were observed to hold close to the path of the sun (the ecliptic), a larger group of ecliptical stars was identified for the purpose of observing the movement of the planets. "Although the twelve constellations of the zodiac gave their names to the zodiacal signs, once the signs were defined by longitude rather than constellation, they became a mathematical reference system of twelve 30-degree parts, counted from a defined starting point. In this way, no geometrical dimension was attributed to the heavens in mathematical astronomical texts, whose predictive schemes were strictly arithmetical and linear, and consequently shed no light on the question of the spatial structure of the heavens. (Rochberg, Francesca. (2005). "Mesopotamian Cosmology." In: Snell, David. (Editor). A Companion to the Ancient Near East. (Pages 316-329).)"

The stars of the zenith were also separated by right-ascension differences. Zenith stars were a group of stars whose culminations are used for keeping time, known as ziqpu-stars after the Akkadian term for culmination, ziqpu. Ziqpu-stars were stars "so chosen that one crosses the meridian before dawn, in the middle of each month, as another constellation is rising heliacally." (See: Mul.Apin by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1989) Page 142.) The ziqpu-stars were useful if, for whatever reason, the eastern horizon was obscured and the heliacal rising of important stars was unable to be directly observed. (According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz the use of ziqpu stars for measurement can be described in terms of the measurement of the positions of 3 stars: 'star a' at the apex of the sky (ziqpu point), 'star b' at halfway point between east horizon or west horizon and apex of the sky, and 'star c' at the east horizon or west horizon.) The most common version of the ziqpu-star list contained 25 stars. Another major frame of reference was a fixed celestial frame of 33 bright stars, so-called 'normal stars,' unevenly distributed along the ecliptic within a few degrees of the paths of the sun, moon, and planets. (10 degrees north latitude and 7.5 degrees south latitude (of the ecliptic).) The reasons for the uneven distribution are not understood. 'Normal stars' were used as reference points in the sky to indicate the relative position of the moon and planets and a (normal) star, where the (normal) star becomes the reference point. In the astronomical texts the position of the moon or of a planet is given by stating that it is 'in front of' a Normal Star (which means to the west of the star), or that it is 'above' 'below,' or 'behind' (which means to the east of the star) the star, often in terms of the Babylonian units cubit and digits (finger(s)). In the late Babylonian period celestial phenomena were recorded in terms of the 31/33 Normal Stars (the Akkadian term is Mul.Sid) that were marked along the ecliptic path. The Babylonian astronomical terms used with the Normal Stars have not yet been absolutely clarified. (There would appear to be 32 normal stars usually identified in the Astronomical diaries and Normal Star Almanacs. However, there appears to be a total of 34 stars known to be used as Normal Stars. A list of 32 usual Normal Stars is given in Astronomical Diaries, Volume 1, by Abraham Sachs and Herman Hunger (1988). It is pointed out in this volume that stars other than those identified in the list are occasionally used as Normal Stars.)
The 17/18 stars in 'the path of the Moon' were recognised at least by the 2nd-quarter of the 1st-millennium BCE. Hence circa 750 BCE the use of 17/18 'counting stars' along the path of the moon to measure the progress of the moon through the month. In the Mul.Apin series (Tablet 1, Section 4, Lines 38-39) the list of the stars in 'the path of the Moon' is defined as: "All these are the gods who stand in the path of the Moon through whose regions the Moon in the course of a Month passes, and whom he touches." The system of Normal Stars was in use at least as early a circa 600 BCE. The system of 36 stars marking the 'three ways/paths' gave way to a system involving 31/33 (perhaps 34) 'normal stars' (= reference stars) being placed along the ecliptic, to serve as markers (primarily) for the paths of the planets. Actual (particular) 17/18 stars in 'the path of the Moon' were not denoted in the Mul.Apin series - those 'stars' used were basically asterisms. The 31/33 stars used in the scheme of Normal Stars were not necessarily the same as those used previously in the Mul.Apin scheme for 'the path of the Moon.'
(4) The cosmic waters (Apsu)
Mesopotamian texts preserve a number of different views of the Apsu.
In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology there was a cosmic realm called Apsu (the Abyssal (subterranean waters) comprising watery depths beneath the earth. The Apsu was located directly beneath the earth's surface. The Apsu contained the freshwater ocean and provided the source of water for all the springs, wells, streams, rivers, and lakes of the world. The Persian Gulf, which lay to the south of Sumer, was believed to be a source of an outflow of the Apsu. The Apsu was the creation, abode, and kingdom of the god Enki. The temple of Enki in the very early Sumerian city of Eridu was called the E-Abzu 'House of the Abyss.' Enki's son, Marduk, was known as 'first-born son of the Apsu.' Because Enki was associated with wisdom, magic, and incantations, the Apsu was thought of as the fount of wisdom and source of the secret knowledge of incantations. The later temple of Marduk in erected in Babylon was explained as the replica of Apsu. As the counterpart to Enki's cosmic abode, Marduk's temple was also the home of all the gods. Enki's shrine in Eridu too was known as the 'holy mound.' The association of the Apsu with the 'holy mound' showed the cosmic importance of Ea's domain as a place for the divine assembly and where destiny was decreed. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (1998, Page 342)) that the Apsu and the underworld were, in some texts, confused with each other.
There is not enough information to decide whether the interior of the Apsu was completely filled with water. There are reasons for supposing the Apsu was a cosmic subterranean lake that maintained a constant level of water. No figure is mentioned for the depth of the Apsu beneath the earth's surface (or the actual depth of the Apsu itself). One text indicates the Apsu had borders and it was possible to travel from the underworld to the higher regions by passing outside the borders of the Apsu.

In KAR 307, the Apsu is the middle earth, is located between the earth's surface and the underworld, and belongs to Ea. In Ee V 119-122, Marduk indicates that the city of Babylon on the earth's surface is to be located above the Apsu. In some texts the Apsu is a cosmic region on a par with the heavens.
The gate of the Apsu is mention in Ee V 73-76.
(5) The realm of the dead
The furthest realm in the direction downward was 'the netherworld.' The underworld was the lowest region of the Mesopotamian universe. There were various ideas of the land of the dead in literary texts. In the only known text where cosmic regions were placed relative to one another within an overall scheme the location of the netherworld was specified as being below the Apsu. As such it was the lowest of all regions. In literary texts the netherworld was depicted as a land that was dark and distant, inhabited by ghosts, demons, or gods who ruled over the dead or who brought death.
Eric Burrows in The Labyrinth (Eric Burrows (Jesuit assyriologist/epigraphist), "Some Cosmological Patterns in Babylonian Religion." In: The Labyrinth edited by Samuel Hooke (1935, Pages 45-70).) considers evidence for the relation of the Babylonian temples to (1) heaven, (2) earth, and (3) the underworld, proposed that the Babylonians held the idea that the temple was a vertical column stretching up to heaven (expressed by the height of the temple) and down to the underworld (expressed by placement of drains or pipes for libations to the underworld). These ratu/arutu were found at Ur. According to the CAD A/2 324, clay pipes (arutu) were placed in the earth as conduits for libations to the dead.
There is almost no evidence for the size and shape of the underworld. No text provides any dimensions. It was indicated to be very large and a single text indicates it to be circular in shape, like the heavens and the earth's surface. The distance/depth of the underworld beneath the earth's surface varies with texts. One text gives the exact distance of 100 leagues. Given that a league is approximately 5.5 kilometres the distance under the earth to the netherworld is 550 kilometres. The underworld is generally in darkness (referred to in literary texts as the "House of Darkness") but the sun-god passes through the underworld at night on his way from the western horizon to the eastern horizon.
Wayne Horowitz states (1998, Page 350): "Almost all known features of the underworld are architectural rather than topographical." There are few details describing the underworld river, its source and outlet, and size. One text describes it as a great river.
Note: The Enuma Elish does not mention the Lower Earth/Underworld. There is little clear information regarding creation of the underworld. In one text it was apparently a part of earth.
(6) The gates the stars, moon, and sun use when rising and setting
There are numerous sources (i.e., Enuma Elish, Prayers to the Gods of the Night) mentioning gates which the stars, moon, and sun pass through when entering and departing the sky. Both Sumerian and Akkadian texts mention the stars, moon, and sun come out of gates on the eastern horizon and enter back through gates on the western horizon. These gates exist for both the (nonvisible) high heavens and the visible heavens. Various gods/goddesses open (unbolt) the gates (or open a particular door) of heaven. Texts do not explain how the sun, moon, stars, and planets reach the gates of heaven. Akkadian literature contains 3 explanations for ways the gates of heaven can be reached: (1) to fly like Etana (an ancient Sumerian king of the city of Kish) and the eagle, (2) to take a roadway, and (3) to climb a stairway.
For the mountains of sunrise and sunset (the Sun-god depicted as rising and setting through a gate by mountains) see: (1) "The Sun at Night and the Doors of Heaven in Babylonian Texts." by Wolfgang Heimpel, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 38, Number 2, Autumn, 1986, Pages 127-151. [Wayne Horowitz gives: W. Heimpel, JNES, Volume 38, Pages 143-146.] (2) JoAnn (Jo Ann) Scurlock, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 108, 206, Number 1?/2?, 1988, Pages 18-23. [I have yet to fully identify this reference.] (3) "At the Edge of the World: Cosmological Conceptions of the Eastern Horizon in Mesopotamia." by Christopher Woods (Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions, Volume 9, Issue 2, 2009, Pages 183-239). Every morning the sun god Shamash enters the sky through the eastern gateway of the Mashu mountains. At the end of the day Shamash exits the sky through a gateway located on the western peak of the Mashu mountains. Guardians of the gateway in this mountain are depicted as hybrid creatures like scorpion-men or bull-men. The god Nergal is mentioned in relation to the 'Gate of Sunset' in a damaged text. Also, the god Nergal, the king of the underworld, is associated with a mountain of sunrise in one text.

The gate of heaven is guarded by heavenly (cosmic) beings. There are also gates to the underworld. Texts commonly mention a road to the underworld but give no exact details of the route. Some texts state this road leads to the underworld gates and others state it ends at the underworld river which must then be crossed. Steps leading down into the underworld is also indicated. In The Death of Gilgamesh it is indicated that it may have been possible to enter the underworld by crossing distant mountains. The gates of heaven and the gates of the underworld were identical in structure to city gates on the earth's surface.
(7) Names of key parts of the sky
There are Sumerian terms and Akkadian equivalents that name parts of the sky, including: (1) Horizon (Heaven's base/The base of heaven; also Heaven's edge). Referring to the lower portion of the sky, including the actual horizon where heaven and earth meet, and a band above the horizon (= the lower part of the eastern sky above the horizon that is tinged red by the approaching sun). (2) Zenith (Heaven's top/The heights of heaven; also Heaven's tip/The tip of heaven). (3) Middle of the sky (The middle of the heaven). Regarding "middle of the sky" Wayne Horowitz states: (1998, Page 239): "Although it may be assumed that the "Middle of Heaven" included the center of the sky around the apex of the celestial dome, it is not possible to determine how far the "Middle of Heaven" extended downward." Wayne Horowitz also comments (1998, Page 233): "These terms [horizon, zenith, and middle of the sky] are not used in a consistent manner. They often seem to be synonymous with one another or to refer to overlapping areas." The border between Horizon and Zenith is not defined in any known Sumerian or Akkadian text.
Appendix 1: Babylonian Pole Star(s)?
Introduction
Due to precession the pole star (whether for northern sky or for southern sky) is temporary. The pole star (polestar)/north star refers to the star that happens to be nearest to the north celestial pole (pole of the celestial equator) around which all the stars seen from the northern hemisphere appear to rotate. In other words: Usually, pole stars are simply those stars nearest to the vacant (northern) apex.
Pole of the equator
In brief: north celestial pole (star) = pole of the (celestial) equator. Some definitions: (1) The celestial north pole is the imaginary point in the sky directly above the earth's geographic north pole around which the stars appear to rotate over the course of the night. (2) A pole star is a visible star that is approximately aligned with the earth's axis of rotation, that is, a star whose apparent position is close to one of the celestial poles, and which is positioned approximately directly overhead when viewed from the earth's geographic north pole or geographic south pole. The current north pole star (north star) is the bright star Polaris. There is no bright star presently coinciding with the Earth's south celestial pole. Sigma Octantis (in the dim constellation Octans) is presently the closest naked-eye to the south celestial pole. It is over 1ŗ away from the pole, with a barely visible magnitude of 5.5 (requiring a clear night to see it). (3) The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator. In other words it is an imaginary projection of the terrestrial equator out into space. Because of the axial tilt of the earth the celestial equator is inclined 23.4ŗ with respect to the ecliptic plane.
For the last 10,000 years the only star to come within 1ŗ of the equatorial North Pole (circa 3000 BCE, and remaining there for 200 years) was Thuban (Bayer designation Alpha Draconis (α Draconis)), a 4th magnitude (presently + 3.65 but may have been brighter in the historic past) yellow star in the constellation Draco. (It is calculated that Thuban (α Draconis) was the northern pole star from 3942 BCE when it moved farther north than Theta Boötis, until 1793 BCE.)
Pole of the ecliptic
The ecliptic pole is the point on the celestial sphere where the celestial sphere meets the imaginary line perpendicular to the ecliptic, the path the Earth travels on its orbit around the Sun. The obliquity of the ecliptic is the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic to the plane of the celestial equator. The 'ecliptic north pole' (as it is called by modern astronomer) is entirely separate from, and 23.4 degrees distant from, the 'celestial north pole' (as it is called by modern astronomers) which is tilted away from the vertical by 23.4 degrees. (The so-called obliquity of the ecliptic.) Unlike the pole of the celestial equator, the pole of the ecliptic is permanently located (it does not move). The north pole of the ecliptic (north ecliptic pole) is in the constellation Draco. Draco is circumpolar (i.e., never setting), and can be seen all year from northern latitudes. The south pole of the ecliptic (south ecliptic pole) is in the constellation Dorado. Dorado is circumpolar (i.e., never setting), and can be seen all

year from southern latitudes. There are no bright stars near the north pole of the ecliptic. The pole of the ecliptic (northern ecliptic pole) is located in the coils of the constellation of Draco (the Dragon), approximately between the stars Zeta Draco (magnitude 3.17) and Al Tais (Altais) (magnitude 3.07). (The northern pole of the ecliptic is also described as between the stars Grumium (magnitude 3.75) and Chi Draconis (magnitude 3.55).) Its location is almost impossible to detect within one or many lifetimes.
The ecliptic plane passes through the 12 zodiacal constellations.
Precession
Due to precession the celestial pole is in continual motion, revolving round the pole of the ecliptic. The celestial north pole makes a complete revolution round the pole of the ecliptic approximately every 25,700 years. Owing to this motion of the celestial pole the celestial equator moves also, continually sliding along the ecliptic, and carrying the equinoxes with it.
In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon, and, to a lesser extent, of the planets, on the equatorial bulge of the earth. The term "precession" typically refers only to the largest part of the wobbling motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis - nutation and polar motion - are much smaller in magnitude.
Precession causes the Earth to wobble on its axis with a period of approximately 25,700 years. The Earth rotates once a day around its rotational axis; this axis itself rotates slowly (similar to a wobbling top), completing a rotation in approximately 25,700 years. (Looking down on the ecliptic plane from the north, the earth's axis is pivoting clockwise.) The traditional/historical term, precession of the equinoxes, refers to the motion of the equinoxes along the ecliptic (the plane of Earth’s orbit) caused by the cyclic precession of Earth’s axis of rotation. Earth's precession was traditionally/historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic.
Discussion
Discussion on whether or not the Babylonians, and perhaps even the Sumerians were aware of both the Pole of the Equator and the Pole of the Ecliptic (or one or the other) is, at times, confused. The discussion of an alleged Babylonian pole star (by convention = north pole of equator) by Robert Brown Junior in his Primitive Constellations, Volume II, 1900, Pages 176-191 is muddled, unreliable, and outdated. According to Brown Junior (Primitive Constellations, Volume II) "The Pole Star is Dugga-Kaga-gilgatil." In an early article (The Babylonian and Oriental Record, Volume 1, 1887) Brown maintained Vega was the pole-star, called in Akkadian Tir-anna, ("Life-of-heaven"), and in Assyrian Dayan-samź ("Judge-of-heaven"), as having the highest seat or throne. Persons who maintain the Babylonians, and perhaps even the Sumerians were aware of both the Pole of the Equator and the Pole of the Ecliptic basically use out-dated references to try and prove it. (The attempted argument by Gavin White in his book Babylonian Star-Lore (2007) ) that the celestial pole was stressed in Babylonian star-lore is erroneous and is likely influenced by reliance on outdated references (but the author gives very few references for the content of his book; but years later did publish them separately on the internet).) However, there is no credible proof the Sumerians and/or Babylonians had established a Pole of the Equator and a Pole of the Ecliptic.
Update note: Gill Zukovskis (6/10/2012) has kindly brought to my attention that a bibliography for Babylonian Star-Lore has appeared at Solaria Publications website: "Reference Notes to Babylonian Star-lore, 2nd Edition, posted on April 11, 2012" by Gavin White. Amongst the references is "Page 135 §1: Identified as Pole star. Reiner 1995, pages 20-1." See below for Reiner's dated (and sole) source.
It is puzzling that people want keep using Peter Jensen and Alfred Jeremias. Likely it is because few other persons make these kind of statements. However, Peter Jensen is outdated and Alfred Jeremias is biased and dated. Neither can be regarded as authoritative. In his very early book (1890) on Babylonian astronomy, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier the pioneering Assyriologist Peter Jensen includes a diagram associating Anu with the North Pole of the Ecliptic and Bil-Enlil with the North Pole of the Equator (which is opposite to the assignments given later (1913) by Alfred Jeremias), but in his brief discussion on Page 19 Jensen also offers that the assignments could be reversed. In his Die Kosmologie der Babylonier (Pages 190-191), Jensen also indicates a knowledge of the two poles when he writes (English translation courtesy Leroy Ellenberger (Hastro-L)): "Since it is absolutely unthinkable that the sun and the moon, as also the 'god stars' Anu and Bil (that is, the two north

poles!), could be related to the Earth in any shape, form or fashion, we shall break neither our or anyone else's noggins over VR 46, 15-16ab. This text presents no problem unless one is dead set to create difficulties where there [really] are none."
The cuneiform text VR 46 is a star list dated to the Late Babylonian Period - for simplicity it can be dated circa 500 BCE. The text equates stars/constellations with gods/goddesses and it associates Anu with the 'wolf star.' However, the late 'theological' cuneiform text KAR 142 associates Enlil with the 'wolf star.' Hunger/Pingree Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999) have Wolf as alpha Trianguli. (The Plough constellation is α. + β Trianguli and γ Andromedae.) However, it was also associated with Sirius. It is difficult to understand how the text relates to the Pole of the Equator and the Pole of the Ecliptic being established/identified in Babylonian astronomy.
In the entry for "Enlil am Himmel" in the scholarly fascicle Reallexikon der Assyriologie Volume II, Page 389, the claim that the Babylonians identified the Pole of the Equator and the Pole of the Ecliptic is repeated: "Wo der »Standort« des Enlil am Himmel zu lokalisieren ist, läßt sich nicht mit Sicherheit entscheiden. Es kann sich um den Höhepunkt des scheinbaren Sonnenlaufes zur Zeit der Sommersonnenwende (unter der Breite von Babylon etwa 7,5° südlich vom Zenit) oder um den Pol der Ekliptik (s. Jensen Kosmologie, S. 19ff. und KB VI, I, S.347; Weidner Handb. babyl. Astron., S. 33) handeln." Reallexikon der Assyriologie Volume II is a dated publication (and the author of the entry is using dated references). Volume 2 was published circa the mid 1930s. There is no mechanism for updating RLA entries. (Weidner is actually simply repeating the claims he made in his book Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie. For example, in Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie Weidner holds that (Pages 32-34) Nibiru is the Pole of the Ecliptic (= Enlil is the Pole of the Ecliptic), and (Page 97) kakkab MU-SIR-KEŠ-DA = kakkab Niru, is the Pole of the Equator (= Anu is the Pole of the Equator).) Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie by Ernst Weidner (1914) was written from the Panbabylonism standpoint and is a veritable wonderland of Panbabylonism. (It was completed several years prior to its publication in 1914, and was in press from 1913.) In Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie Weidner declared a sophisticated Babylonian astronomy existed at least circa 2,000 BCE, misunderstood and incorrectly used 'The Hilprecht Text' (HS 245) – which he could not date (but is Middle Babylonian Period circa latter part of the 2ndmillennium BCE) - as evidence of an early sophisticated mathematical astronomy (before the Kassite Period), and asserted texts from the library of King Ashurbanipal go back to at least 4,500 BCE. (For Weidner 'The Hilprecht Text,' which he believed likely dated to the 3rd-millennium BCE, provided evidence for an equator-based system of coordinates for measuring the locations of fixed stars.)
Recently Gavin White in his popular (and misleading) book Babylonian Star-Lore supported the identifications made by Alfred Jeremias in 1913 and identified Bil-Enlil with the Pole of the Ecliptic (Plough-star) and Anu with the Pole of the Equator. However, Gavin White, though quite knowledgeable, is not an expert on Babylonian astronomy and astral lore. Simply, since 1920 there has been a vast increase in our knowledge of how to interpret cuneiform languages. Cuneiform translations prior to 1920 may be unreliable and involve questionable interpretations. What the pioneering Assyriologists sometimes thought they were reading is simply mistaken. Even the Assyriologist (and staunch Panbabylonist) Ernst Weidner warned that interpretations and translations earlier than 1920 needed to be used with caution.
Auguste Bouché-Leclercq in L'Astrologie grecque (1899, Page 122) writes: "On sait que le pole par excellence était pour les Chaldéens le pole de l'écliptique, lequel est dans la constellation du Dragon." Here Bouché-Leclercq briefly mentions a late source, Diodorus Siculus (1st century CE), for the Chaldeans identifying Anu with pole of the ecliptic in the constellation of the Dragon. Bouche-Leclercq is relying on what Diodorus Siculus (1st century AD) had to say on Mesopotamian astrology/astronomy in their own day. The reputation of Diodorus Siculus for accuracy and reliability is rather dubious. He basically copied his information from other sources, without updating it. He was a writer, not a researcher. Some of the information he gives on Mesopotamia is confused.
Persons having a preference for uncritically using old material to make their case need to present supportive reasons for maintaining their continued adoption. In his bibliography in Die Rolle der Astronomie in den Kulturen Mesopotamiens (1993) the Assyriologist Christopher Walker comments that Weidner“s Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie is "now very out of date." In the same volume (?) (or elsewhere) the Assyriologist Francesca Rochberg cautions against reliance on Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur (2nd edition 1929) by Alfred Jeremias. On Page 134 of the 2nd edition Jeremias insisted that 'Nibiru' in all star texts of later times indicated Canopus. (Also, Francesca Rochberg has remarked in a personal communication (4 December 1995) to Leroy Ellenberger regarding her translation of section 94, "Die Offenbarung der vier Planeten in den Erscheinungen der Sonne und des Mondes," in Jeremias' Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur (1913) (Ellenberger, Hastro-L, 10 December 2009): "I find this Jeremias passage to be totally incomprehensible. I may not have produced a thoroughly correct translation, but I think it is close enough. The evidence, such as it is, is

not presented in such a way as anyone can use it, and the very passages that you were interested in ... are not given in Akkadian and no text refs are provided. The whole notion of the representation ... of the planets ... in various guises of the moon and/or sun is hard to understand. If these are genuine astrological correspondences, we do not understand what their purpose might have been. Jeremias never comes clean with what he thinks it all means either. ..."
A pioneering study of Mesopotamian astronomy was initiated with the 3 articles by Archibald Sayce and Robert Bosanquet published during 1879-1880 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. By at least 1887 Sayce was identifying a Pole Star (Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religions). He held that "The Star/Constellation of Anu was the "Yoke of Heaven" = Draco, alpha Draconis. In an early Volume of Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology he stated: "The Akkadian term "Ditar-Anki" ("the Judge of Anki") and the Assyrian term "Dayen-Same" are designations of the Pole Star (North Celestial Pole). The assertion by Sayce of ""Yoke of Heaven" = Draco, alpha Draconis" may possibly be matched to the modern translation "Hitched Yoke" which Hunger/Pingree (1999) tentatively identify with α Draconis. (Note: The Yoke star, mul.SUDUN/nīru, is equated with (approximately Boötes (or Arcturus (and parts of Boötes).)
For an another early attempt to identify the Pole Star in Babylonian astronomy see: Verhandlungen des Fünften Internationalen Orientalisten-Congresses, Erster Theil, 1881, Page 71.
In his Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie Weidner explained "man-za-az il Enlil" as the north pole of the ecliptic. (Relying on K 13 774?) Jensen went for similar in his book Die Kosmologie der Babylonier. However, he later withdrew this argument (changed his interpretation) in his book Assyrische-babylonische: Mythen und Epen (1906). This does not seem to be widely known by persons who like to quote his earlier book. (It also helps to demonstrate the lack of any real familiarity with these early authors.)
The term Nēberu ("Crossing") is also discussed regarding its meaning/s. The term Nēberu ("Crossing") first appears in Astrolabe B as the name of a star in month XII. Astrolabe B was composed in the same political context as as the so-called creation story Enūma eliš and reflects the victory of Nebuchadnezzar I over Elam circa 1100 BCE.
In the early history of Assyriology the term "Nebiru (Neberu)" was sometimes interpreted as meaning the Pole Star, Pole, or Pivot (especially in the Enuma Elish). The Assyriologist Leonard King, using K 13 774, interpreted "man-za-az Neberu" as the Pole Star of the Equator in his book The Seven Tablets of Creation (1902). Anu is identified as the Pole Star of the Ecliptic. In his Babylonien und Assyrien (1920-25, 2 Volumes) the Assyriologist Bruno Meissner identifies 'Nibiru' with the celestial north pole (but likely is simply following Weidner). According to the Dutch assyriologist Francisco Bohl, the station of Nebiru was the point of entry of Jupiter into the path of Anu observed during the night of the vernal equinox, the Babylonian New Year. (According to Astrolabe KAV 218, during this period, the equinox occurred when the sun entered the constellation Mul Aš-Gan (= Iku) which was the "Field" constellation (= Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Pegasus + Andromedae). The "Field" was enclosed by the rivers of paradise (the constellation of Pisces).)
The concept of nēberu changed over time. Nēberu, written MULNe2-bi-ru (the term is usually transliterated
nebiru, neberu, or nibiru.), can mean Jupiter in culmination or in other specific positions, but can also denote the North Star (α Ursa Minor) and Canopus (α Carina), and even the constellation Perseus or a meteor. (It is presently rather usual to explain that the Akkadian name/term Nebiru is the planet Jupiter and the astral name of Marduk.) It is clear that the Mesopotamians used the term 'Nebiru' to mark an astronomical event; a "crossing" at some point in the sky of Jupiter, Mercury, and a star. Nēbiru perhaps defines a turning point (kunsaggū) of the sky. "Station" appears to refer to position in the sky. (One text has "If Mercury crosses the sky and stops it is Nebiru.")
The concept/astronomical meaning of nēberu in the Enuma Elish (2nd millennium BCE) is not clear. It has been stated that the early concept of nēberu as a star in the centre of the sky (i.e., fixed) is not reconcilable with the later (1st-millennium BCE) conception of Marduk as a planet (or planets) (i.e., mobile). In the Enuma Elish the pole star idea is seen, by some scholars, as imminent in nēberu. In the circular astrolabes Marduk's own star is deemed to be in the centre of the inner circle (i.e., the centre of the Stars/Path of Enlil; the centre of the sky). "In [tabular] Astrolabe B, Neberu and the stations of Enlil and Ea are identified with either the last month of the old year (Adar), or the first month of the new year (Nisan). Astrolabe B lists Mardul's star, Neberu, as the Adar-star for the Path of Anu and identifies this star with the New Year (KAV 218 B ii 29-32). The station of Enlil can be
identified as mulapin 'The Plough Star', the Enlil star for Nisan in KAV 218 B iii 1-3. Here this star is identified as
'Enlil who determines the destinies'. The station of Ea can be identified with mulku6 'Piscis Austrinus', the Ea star for Adar in Astrolabe B .... Thus, Neberu and the stations of Enlil and Ea apparently regulate the heavens by

leading the remaining stars of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea through their annual courses." (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Page 116).) In the Enuma Elish priority is given to the organisation of the stars. In the Enuma Elish the god Marduk is stated to have (in order): (1) organised the (stars into) constellations, (2) organised the calendar, (3) fixed the stand of nēberu, and (4) gave the moon and sun orders about their motion. The organisation of the calendar was achieved by 3 constellations of stars being established for each of the 12 months, to fix the days of the year. They are simply placed in their cosmic position as constellations in the 3 Ways/Paths. Marduk does not create the stars - they are the 'great gods.' In her book, Mesopotamian Astrology (1995, page 117), Ulla Koch-Westenholz states the astronomical meaning of nēberu (both in the Enuma Elish and elsewhere) is not clear.
Among modern scholars who, based on the Enuma Elish, identify nēberu with the pole-star are B. Landsberger and J. Wilson ("The Fifth Tablet of Enuma Elish." JNES, Volume 20, 1961, page 173). As well as holding that Marduk fixing the stand of nēberu refers to the pole-star some scholars also hold that the statement in Tablet V:911 where Marduk placed the zenith in the belly of Tiamat is also a reference to the pole-star. Also,Nēberu/Nēburu = "the Ford," or "Ferry," a star in the path of Enlil = a name of Jupiter, associated with Marduk. CDA (page 248) also suggests Nēberu may be a name for the North Star. (CDA = Black, Jeremy, Andrew George, and Nicholas Postgate. (2nd edition 2000). A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian.)
Donald Mackenzie (Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (1915) and The Migration of Symbols (1926)) has the Babylonians calling the pole star Ilu Sar ("the god Sar (Star)" or Anshar ("Star of the Height" or "Star of the most High") but cites no reference(s). According to James Bonwick, Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought (1878), the Chaldean pole-star was Cagagilgate. In his book, Myths and Legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916), Lewis Spence writes (mistakenly) that "Anu is the Pole Star of the ecliptic, Bel the Pole Star of the equator, while Ea, in the southern heavens, was identified with a star in the constellation Argo" (Chapter VIII, Page 235).
Felix Gössmann Planetarium Babylonicum oder die sumerisch-babylonischen Stern-Namen (1950) comments that 'nibiru' appears to be used for various stars or regions of sky including: (1) north celestial pole or pole star (= Alcor?), (2) Canopus, near the Pisces-Aries region of the zodiac, and (3) Jupiter. (Though Nibiru could be Jupiter (the texts that place Marduk "in the centre of heaven" support the identification of Jupiter, which is located in the centre of the line of planets) it was once identified with Mercury.) Some modern authors still translate 'Neberu' as 'Pole Star.' Recent examples are the Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (1998)) who is followed by the British Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley (translating and interpreting the Enuma Elish) and the British cuneiform philologist and mathematician Eleanor Robson (who is likely simply following Dalley). The particular text is Astrolabe B, 'Rising Stars' list, Month 12 (Adar) for the Path of Anu (Column 2, Lines 29-32). The term 'Neberu' which has the determinative dinger = god (= Marduk) - preceded by the determinative MUL = star - is translated as 'Pole Star' (MUL BI dingir Né-bé-ru dingir AMAR.UD). There is nothing in the text that compels the identification as 'Pole Star.' The translation simply is "This star is Nibiru-Marduk." The full passage translates: "The red star which stands in the south after the gods of the night [the stars] have been finished, dividing the sky in half, this star is Nibiru-Marduk." (Wayne Horowitz translates: "The red star, which stands at the rising of the south-wind after the gods of the night have finished their duties and divides the heavens, this star is Neberu, Marduk.") (The 'red star' suggests an identification with Mars - but this would be incorrect. Comparing Astrolabe B, Column 2, Lines 29-32 with BM 86378 (Mul.Apin, Tablet 1), Column 1, Lines 36-38 the interpretation Jupiter is seemingly valid. Mul.Apin, Tablet 1 set out: "When the stars of Enlil have disappeared, the great, faint star [Jupiter remaining faintly visible in the morning when the other stars have disappeared], which bisects the heavens and stands, is mul dinger Marduk-Niribu, mul SAG.ME.GAR; he (the god) changes his position and wanders over the heavens." Wayne Horowitz (The Three Stars Each (2014)) has identified that in the Astrolabe texts and Enuma Eliš, Marduk's star (= 'red star') is the planet Mercury. Regarding again the term 'Neberu' which has the determinative dinger = god (= Marduk) - preceded by the determinative MUL = star - and translated by some 'Pole Star' (MUL BI dingir Né-bé-ru dingir AMAR.UD). The 'Pole Star' (of the equator) identification is likely done, however, because in the cuneiform texts Nibiru is not only described as mobile but is also described as a 'fixed' star. It needs to be kept in mind the Babylonians had no concept of a celestial equator.
The northern constellation of the Wagon had small rotations and served as a "pole star" (of the equator) and general indicator for the north. The Neo-Assyrian literary fragment K 7067 contains the lines: "The great gods divided up the st[ations ... / In the station, the pole [... ." There is no definite indication of a pole star in this fragmented text.
In her book Astral Magic in Babylonia (1995) Erica Reiner, discussing HUL.BA.ZI.ZI ('Begone, Evil') a collection of incantations, writes (pages 20-21): "A magic effect is sought by praying to a deity called First-born of Emah: O First-born of Emah, First-born of Emah, you are the eldest son of Enlil. You are descended from Ekur and you stand in the middle of the sky with the Wagon. The stellar nature of this divine being addressed is evident

from the middle line, where he is described as standing in the middle of the sky, with the Wagon Star. As for the astronomical identity of the "first-born of Emah," such a star, described as "first-born son of Anu," is listed in an astronomical compendium from about 1000 B.C. [MUL.APIN] as the star that stands in the "rope" of the Wagon, and has been identified with the Pole Star. A prayer to it is prescribed in the hemerology for the month of Ulūlu (month VI)." Reiner is reliant on studies by Carl Bezold and Franz Kugler dating almost 100 years earlier. The star that stands in the rope of the Wagon of Heaven was identified as the Pole Star by the pioneering assyriologists Carl Bezold (Zenit- und Aequartorialgestirne am babylonischen Fixsternhimmel (1913, page 43) and Franz Kugler (Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. Ergänzungen zum ersten und zweiten Buch. I. Teil. (1913, page 57)) as β Ursa Minor (in Ursa Minor).
Both Reiner/Pingree (Babylonian Planetary Omens 2 (1981)) and Hunger/Pingree (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999)) simply render the Month 12 for the Path of Anu in Astrolabe B (Column 2, Lines 29-32) as Neberu. In the composite so-called "Pinches Astrolabe" (which combines information from 4 astrolabe tablets and 2 star-lists) Month 12 for the Path of Anu has Fox (sometimes translated as Jackal), which is circumpolar and usually identified as a star (associated with the Great Bear constellation). The Fox (Sumerian MUL.KA.A or MUL.KA5.A , Akkadian sēlebu) has been variously identified. Felix Gössmann (1950) has 80-86 [= 80] Ursa Major (?) (= Alkor), and in a circular astrolabe it appears in the Path of Enlil; whilst other have ε (?) Ursa Major, or the magnitude 4.0 star Alkor(Alcor) ?, a star on the tail of the Great Bear (Ursa Major); or the constellation Canis Minor. (The modern Vulpecula, the Fox, is a small constellation with no bright star.) The 'Fox Star' is one of the 7 names of Mars. In the Star-list K 250 the 'Fox Star' is a name for Mars. The celestial movements of the 'Fox Star' represent Erra (= Irra).
It is worth noting that the British Assyriologist Stephen Langdon, in his detailed discussion of the astrolabes (The Babylonian Epic of Creation (1923, Pages 154-156)) does not make - or even suggest - a pole star identification for various descriptors applied to Marduk.
Some translate the term 'Nusku' as the Pole of the Equator. In her article "The Shape of the Cosmos According to Cuneiform Sources." (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Third Series, Volume 7, 1997, Pages 189-198) Margaret Huxley brings together evidence from a range of sources and argues that in ancient Mesopotamia the sky was thought to be a rotating sphere with a polar axis. Nusku is the Babylonian and Assyrian god of light and fire altar - and a symbol of the heavenly and terrestrial fire. The god Nusku is indistinguishable from the god Girra. I have not seen any details of why Nusku would be translated as the pole of the equator.
Franz Kugler's brief analysis/discussion of a Babylonian pole-star appears in SSB, Ergan. I. Teil, 1913, "III. Die babylonische Gruppierung der Gestirne." Kugler, based on Mul.Apin Tablet I, line 21, suggested that
mulIBILA.E2.MAḪ = β Ursę Minoris was the Babylonian pole-star. Kugler thought it is natural that the
Babylonians, of all stars that region, attached particular importance to what was then the Pole Star, the place/region around which the Wagon constellation rotated in its daily movement around the sky. Circa 1000 BCE, within the 3 Ways system of Mul.Apin, it was β Ursę Minoris. Felix Gössmann (1950, Pages 75-76, Number 191, followed Kugler in this identification.
A Babylonian concept of a pole star - that is, a star around which the other stars rotate - is not specifically identified (with certainty) in any Babylonian text. I do not know of any cuneiform text that explicitly mentions/establishes/describes a Pole Star (equator or ecliptic) in Babylonian astronomy. This is also the verdict of the eminent assyriologist Hermann Hunger. (The poorly preserved Neo-Assyrian literary fragment K 7067 has opening lines describing the great gods apparently arranging the stars in the sky. Two of the opening lines (both damaged) are usually translated: "In the station, the pole [..." and "[...] the pole [..." but I am presently not aware of the transcriptions.) A modern case, using principally Astrolabe B has been made by Wayne Horowitz. (Astrolabe B is a combination of menology and star lists compiled from older sources.) The god Marduk's pivotal position was at the centre of Astrolabe B. This places Marduk at the centre of the sky (= Marduk being associated with the pole-star of the equator). It was connected with Marduk's role in controlling/regulating the movement of the stars. The star of Marduk is stated/identified in Astrolabe B as the last month of the year (Adar) or the first month of the new year (Nisan). This is clearly associated with Marduk's role to control/regulate the movement of the stars. (The star of Marduk marked the passage from the old year to the new year.) Hence Wayne Horowitz translating text of Astrolabe B as: "The red star, which stands at the rising of the south-wind after the gods of the night have finished their duties and divides the heavens, this star is the pole star [Neberu], Marduk." Wayne Horowitz (The Three Stars Each (2014)) has identified that in the Astrolabe texts and Enuma Eliš, Marduk's star (= 'red star') is the planet Mercury. Marduk's star Nēberu, the 12th star in the Path of Anu, divides the stars of of the outgoing old year from those of the incoming new year. Referring to the (now completed) Chicago Assyrian Dictionary should help to clarify matters. It would be helpful for proponents of a Babylonian pole star to cite: (1)

catalogue number of relevant cuneiform text, (2) relevant transcription, (3) translation, (4) possible date, and (5) reference for such.
The Menology KAV 218 A and Astrolabe KAV 218 C (2 sections of Astrolabe B = KAV 218) list the Iku-star (GĮN (Ikū) = α, β, γ Pegasi and α Andromedae) of (the month) Nisannu as the new year's star. The heliacal rising of the Iku-star would have occurred on the eastern horizon just before dawn on Nisannu 4. However, the akitu festival, which included a celebration of the turning of the New Year, actually began on Nisannu 1. Though the akitu festival began on Nisannu 1 it appears the start of the Babylonian New Year actually began on Nisannu 4, with the heliacal rising of the Iku-star.
The most recent informed discussion of the topic is by the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz at the 2007(?) CAENO Foundation conference. But now see also his The Three Stars Each: The Astrolabes and Related Texts (2014 (but actually published 2015?)).

Note: Mercury is the star of Marduk when it is the New Year star. Mercury as Nebēru is apparently only found in Neo-Assyrian reports by scholars.

A Near Eastern/European Polar God/Goddess?
In Mesopotamia, for whatever reason, the Wagon constellation (= modern Big Dipper asterism) was apparently regarded as the (pivotal) centre of the sky and served as a 'pole star.' The association the god Marduk = Nebiru = Pole Star (variously identified with different stars) has been made. Also, I think the identification of the god Nusku has been made. But these associations may be erroneous.
There is a slight indication that at least in medieval European theology the north celestial pole had a status in relation to divinity (as it did in China). It appears that in (some) medieval German theological literature Mary is termed the pole-star. See: The Dark Figure in Medieval German and Germanic Literature, Volume 448 of Göppinger Arbeiten zur Germanistik, Editors: Edward R. Haymes and Stephanie Cain Van d'Elden (1986, Page 58). David Barrie wrote (Sextant, 2014): "The theologian Alexander Neckham (1157-1217) likened Mary to the Pole Star standing at 'the fixed hinge of the turning sky' by which the sailor at night directs his course." In the later Middle Ages Mary was frequently associated with the moon.

There are 3 important sources/primary material of ancient Occidental astronomy: (1) Original cuneiform tablets. (2) Later manuscript copies of classical Greek treatises. (3) Papyri (most of them in Greek, some in demotic Egyptian).
The earliest sophisticated astronomy arose in ancient Babylonia (central Mesopotamia). Basically there were 3 contributing reasons: By circa 2000 BCE celestial omenology established an enduring pattern of skywatching; the establishment of temple scribes as ongoing sky observers ('a civil service'/bureaucracy) who recorded their celestial observations on clay tablets, which were then securely stored in temples (and broken tablets recopied). By the 7th-century BCE, astronomical diaries were in existence. (The earliest data collectors were the Assyrians.) The ancient Babylonian observations were not very precise, but it is far more important to have a long run of observations than to have precise ones.
Almost all preserved source material for the astral sciences date to only 2 time periods: the 8th and 7th centuries BCE Assyria, and Babylon between the 4th century and the 1st century CE. A small number of astronomical tablets from Babylonia are known from the 8th to the 5th centuries BCE. A small number of astronomical tablets are known from before the 8th century BCE from either Assyria or Babylonia. Our knowledge of the astral sciences in the earlier period relies mostly on late copies of works that are believed to have been composed in the 2nd or early 1st millennium BCE. This is likely only a small part of the early astronomical activity. The development of astronomy within Mesopotamia shows overlap between cultural traditions. As example, whilst there are distinct differences between Assyrian and Babylonian astronomy; the astronomy of the Neo-Assyrian period overlapped with the beginning of Late Babylonian astronomy by approximately a century.
For 2000 years the city of Babylon and its stable bureaucracy was the centre for astronomy in the Near East. (However, it is worth noting that in Uruk, the full range of Babylonian astral science is best represented in the Late Seleucid library of the Rēš temple of the sky god Anu. This is simply yo do with what has come down to us. Also, most tablets from Uruk were excavated scientifically, unlike those from Babylon.)
"The astronomical heritage from Mesopotamia is largely in two forms: (i) tangible moveable heritage, namely cuneiform tablets containing astronomical texts; and (ii) intangible heritage, namely the legacy of Mesopotamian astronomy in the astronomy of other cultures. No tangible immovable heritage is known; for example, no buildings have been identified as astronomical observatories or sites, there is little evidence for the use of astronomy in town planning, etc." (Portal to the Heritage of Astronomy. https://www3.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-theme?idtheme=12)
Three types of astronomy were practiced by Babylonian scribes: observational, predictive, and mathematical. These 3 aspects of Babylonian astronomy coexisted throughout the 1st-millennium BCE. Their developed/sophisticated form took place during the 1st-millennium BCE. (1) Observational astronomy: The large number of astronomical observations preserved in the so-called astronomical diaries demonstrate that from circa the mid-eighth century BCE the Babylonian scribes/astronomers made regular and systematic observations of astronomical phenomena. The preserved observations indicate that the Babylonians were primarily interested cyclical celestial phenomena. Observations of irregular astronomical phenomena (comets, meteors, aurorae) are only recorded very occasionally. Overall, the Babylonian scribes/astronomers mostly observed astronomical phenomena that were capable of being predicted in advance. (2) Predictive astronomy: Predictive astronomy was a core interest of Babylonian scribes/astronomers. The identification of the characteristic periods of the moon and planets provided the means by which future lunar and planetary phenomena could be predicted from past observations. This has been termed goal-year astronomy. The cuneiform texts related to predictive astronomy are termed goal-year texts. (3) Mathematical astronomy: The cuneiform tablets with mathematical astronomy were all recovered from Babylon, and Uruk. These were 2 major Babylonian cities and centres of learning. The mathematical astronomical tablets were written between 380 BCE and 48 BCE. The beginning of Babylonian mathematical astronomy is dated to circa 400 BCE, when Babylonian scribes/astronomers invented the zodiac of 12 equal divisions.
There are 23 main types of Babylonian astronomical texts: ephemerides and procedure texts. The ephemerides give computed phenomena for the Moon and 5 Planets. Procedure texts, however, outline - albeit rather obliquely - the rules for computing the ephemerides. The mathematical astronomical texts can be described as being broadly theoretical. However, the non-mathematical astronomical text scan not be legitimately described as observational. The astronomical diaries contain mainly observations but predictions are also reported. Texts such as almanacs and normal star almanacs contain only predictions.
Together, the Astronomical Diaries, lunar and planetary compilations, Goal-Year Texts, Almanacs, and the Normal Star Almanacs form a complete and integrated astronomical system.

Three mathematical tools were commonly used in Babylonian astronomy: period relations; zigzag functions; and step functions.
Several different systems of calculation are known for each of the 5 planets. These can be grouped into 2 categories: those that use step functions to calculate the synodic arc (Δλ), which are usually referred to as "System A" type schemes, and those that use zigzag functions to calculate the synodic arc, usually referred to as "System B" type schemes. System A type schemes are known for all of the planets; System B schemes were apparently only used for the outer planets.
Two types of calendar were used in Mesopotamia during the 2nd and 1st millennia BCE: a civil or cultic calendar and a schematic calendar.
Until the late Mesopotamian period the lunar calendar was governed by observation. The Babylonian calendar and hence chronological system used in ancient Mesopotamia was based on a year of 12 synodic months; i.e., 12 complete cycles of phases of the Moon. This lunar year of about 354 days was more or less reconciled with the solar year, or year of the seasons, by the occasional intercalation of an extra month. The Assyrian calendar - with different month names - was a lunar calendar as was the Babylonian calendar. Whether a month had 29 or 30 days was already watched for in Assyrian times, i.e. middle of the 7th-century BCE. In Babylonia, from about 380 BCE the beginning of the first month of the year, Nisanu, was maintained near the onset of spring by the use of a regular cycle (similar to the Greek Metonic cycle) of intercalations.
Mesopotamian science/astronomy was the product of an academic scribal culture. Scientific astronomy, in the sense of the use of recorded observations, started in Babylonia, an ancient cultural region occupying southeastern Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Because the city of Babylon was the capital of this area for centuries centuries, the term Babylonia has come to refer to the entire culture that developed in the area from the time it was first settled, circa 4000 BCE. Before Babylon's rise to political prominence (circa 1850 BCE.), the area was divided into two countries: Sumer in the southeast and Akkad in the northwest. Mesopotamian astral science was applied science. For most of its history Babylonian astronomy was observational (but not rigidly so) and descriptive, and based on an ideal scheme of the universe per the astrolabe astronomy organised by the god Marduk. It never really became theoretical and mathematical until the Neo-Babylonian period circa 500 BCE. (Marduk used the body of Tiamat to create the celestial sky, and he also the stars and the progression of time.) The study of the sky by the Babylonians was undertaken with the intention to acquire advanced knowledge of future events for the king and/or state. The work continued uninterrupted by political turmoil. The scholars and scribes involved in studying astronomy and astrology were based at the palace or in temples. Early Babylonian astronomy was very much concerned about astronomical phenomena at the horizon. The horizon was a key reference point. It provides the basis for accurate measurements of how things are changing in the sky. It is more difficult to accurately measure items above the horizon i.e., overhead. (The horizon is the apparent line that separates earth from sky. It is the line that divides all visible directions into two categories: those that intersect the Earth's surface, and those that do not. At many locations, the true horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc., and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the visible horizon. When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing.) Also, by the 1st-millennium BCE there was much within Babylonian astronomy that was theoretical rather than empirical. Aspects of Babylonian astronomy also conformed to/were shaped by beliefs involving omenology. Mesopotamian celestial omenology was established upon the belief that omens related to the ruler and state were signalled from the gods/goddesses using the stars (the celestial objects) in the night sky. (The Greco-Egyptian tradition of astrology, centered in the Ptolemaic-Egyptian capital of Alexandria, was established upon an inherited body of knowledge from Mesopotamia, in addition to bringing together Greek and Egyptian concepts.) Babylonian omenology was based on the belief that what happens in the sky indicates terrestrial events - but did not influence them. Changes were able to be implemented through appropriate priestly rituals.
"Celestial omens are among the oldest ones attested so far. The first collections of them appear in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE, and concern mostly lunar eclipses. These texts already have a highly structured form, which suggests that they were developed by scholars skilled in the observation of patterns of astronomical phenomena. It should be emphasized, however, that omens from the sky did not play an important role in early times. Divination from the liver of sheep was far more frequent. Only in the first millennium BC did celestial divination become a dominant source of signs. The interest in it, however, had existed for centuries before that, and the pertinent omens were collected like others too. This finally lead to the organisation of celestial omens into an extensive edition comprising about 70 tablets [Enuma Anu Enlil]." Hunger, Hermann. (2011).

possible to say exactly when the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil was compiled but it is thought it was done in the late 2nd-millennium BCE.
A high level of mathematical thinking emerged in the early 2nd-millennium BCE. These mathematical achievements then stagnated for some 1000 years. The invention of the zodiac in the 5th-century BCE was the impetus for the development of new mathematical models required for highly sophisticated mathematical astronomy. Note: It is possible that the basic elements of Old Babylonian mathematics was Sumerian in origin i.e., dating to circa 2500 BCE.
Early Babylonian astronomy was computational. Only from the Seleucid period were there any attempts by the Babylonians to construct mathematical models. The earliest form of mathematical astronomy exists in cuneiform tablets from Babylon and Uruk. Babylonian astronomy acquired complex numerical methods in the Hellenistic Period. (The Mesopotamians used arithmetic and a kind of proto-algebra. The Greeks used geometry.) By at least 600 BCE, methods of predicting the beginning of the new month (indicated by the new moon crescent) up to 18 years in advance had been developed, long with techniques for predicting the months and times at which eclipses of the sun and moon were likely to happen, and certain planetary phenomena. By the end of the 5th-century BCE, complex mathematical techniques were being applied to theoretical systems for calculating lunar and planetary phenomena. Most of the astronomical mathematical texts are ephemerides for the moon and the planets, and also procedure texts which contain rules for computing the ephemerides. There are approximately 300 mathematical astronomical texts known. There are approximately 1500 observational texts (mostly Astronomical Diaries) known.
Also, other considerations added to the development of ideal schemes. A 12-month, 360-day year for administrative purposes appears in documents from Uruk from the end of the 4th-millennium BCE (circa 32003000 BCE), and is well consolidated by the Ur III period a millennium later. The earliest influential schematic calendar (12 months of 30 days each) dates from the Ur III period (Third Dynasty of Ur i.e., based in the city of Ur) in the last part of the 3rd-millennium BCE (circa 2112 BCE to circa 2004 BCE).

"We have to reconstruct it [Babylonian astronomy] exclusively from texts and a few schematic drawings accompanying them. No instruments relating to astronomy have been found. These texts were written on clay in cuneiform script which was used in the Near East from ca. 3000 BCE to 100 [CE]. It was completely forgotten and only deciphered in the middle of the 19th century Since then, hundreds of thousands of clay tablets have been found in archaeological excavations, mostly in present-day Iraq. Among these are a few thousand [fragmented] tablets related to astronomy. Many have been published, but more still need to be worked on. And of course an unknown number of such texts is still buried under the sands of Iraq." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and society."

Rigorous technical science originated with the Semitic Babylonians. The idea is still common that astronomy in Mesopotamia developed from an observational basis to a purely computational basis. However, this is not supported by the extant textual sources. "Observations were of far less importance than we would expect; simple schematic models for the movement of the celestial bodies were for a long time considered sufficient." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011).

Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Page 62).) The city of Babylon's rise to power and prominence began in 1894 BCE when SumuAbum, an Amorite chieftain, founded the first royal dynasty there. The city reach its first peak during the reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE) its sixth king. During Hammurabi's reign it became the centre of the first great Babylonian empire. After his death the Babylonian empire began to become smaller, due in part to the rise of a new rival dynasty called the Sealand (which originated in the marshlands of southern Mesopotamia). Note: With the Hittite raid in 1595 BCE and the collapse of the Old Babylonian political system much in the way scribal culture also disappeared, and with it disappeared much in the way of mathematics. Babylon reached the zenith of its greatness with the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar (604-562 BCE). This was followed by a long period of decline. Of the surviving astronomical records by far the greatest number are from Babylon, covering effectively the period 731 BCE - 75 CE. (As comparison, only after circa 300 CE are there extensive astronomical records still preserved in China.) Most of the astronomical tablets recovered from the site of Babylon are from the period between circa 380 BCE and 60 BCE, with the extreme dates being 731 BCE and 75 CE. (Also as comparison, the extant astronomical records from Greece in Classical times are largely found in the Mathematike Syntaxis by Claudius Ptolemy circa 140 CE.)
Astronomical schools existed at Babylon, Borsippa, Sippar, Uruk, and likely Nippur. It is customary to equate the term "oppida Hipparenum" with Sippar; but it is also thought by some to be Nippur. More than 4000 astronomical tablets have been recovered from Babylon. Several hundred astronomical tablets have been recovered from Uruk and approximately the same number from Nineveh. A small number of astronomical tablets have been found at Ashur and Nimrud. A handful of astronomical tablets have been recovered from Sippar, and likewise Nippur and Ur. Outside of Mesopotamia proper, a small number of astronomical cuneiform tablets have been found at the Neo-Assyrian city of Sultantepe. A single astronomical text from Nippur dates to the Seleucid period. All mathematical astronomical texts known presently come from Babylon or from Uruk. The astronomical texts from Nineveh come from the library of king Assubanipal - not from an astronomical school situated in Nineveh. The bulk of the Mesopotamian astronomical texts come from only 3 locations: Nineveh (Kouyunjik), Babylon, and Uruk. Mathematical astronomy texts of known provenance come from a number of sites scattered over ancient Mesopotamia. Most of the omen texts - centred on the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil - come from Ashurbanipal's library in Nineveh. The 2-tablet Mul.Apin series - quite astronomical in content - comes from Ashurbanipal's library in Nineveh. Most of the observational texts i.e., nonmathematical texts (Astronomical Diaries, Almanacs, and Goal-Year texts) come from the city of Babylon from what must have been an extensive astronomical archive somewhere in the city. Mathematical astronomy texts also come from the city of Babylon. A group of mathematical astronomy texts also come from Uruk. The Royal Reports (Sargonid period) dealing with astral omens come from various cities within Assyria. The mathematical astronomy texts date from the last 4 centuries BCE.
There is no formal astronomy in Sumerian texts. Sumerian literary texts, however, contain astronomical references. (Some knowledge of Sumerian astronomy exists in literary texts and references to calendars.) The Sumerian term UDU.IDIM.MES (Akkadian bibbu) = wild sheep = planets. In the religious text Nanna-Suen Hymn 1 (Sumerian period, 3rd-millennium BCE), the mention of cows is an allusion to the stars in the night sky. (Nanna-Suen (Bronze Age Mesopotamian moon god) Hymn I (of 15 hymns to Nanna-Suen known) has a section on stars and cows. There is an allusion to stars and planets as cattle and the sky as a cattle pen. In a later text the sun and the moon are herdsmen who keep the sky ordered. There is no evidence that the Sumerians were familiar with domes. For the Sumerians the sky is like the curved roof of a cattle pen.) In the religious text the Exaltation of Istar (Middle Babylonian period, circa 1150-1000 BCE), the sun and moon are herdsmen keeping the stars (as cattle) in their order.
The first explanations of the origin of constellations date to the 2nd-millennium BCE. The earliest known Mesopotamian astronomical and astral omenology texts date from the Old Babylonian period onwards. (Ominous phenomena were visible phenomena. In celestial omens the phenomena considered ominous were expected to 'appear' or be 'observed.') A few texts (i.e., lists) also mentioning stars and constellations date to the 3rd millennium BCE. However, Hermann Hunger points out that no principle is evident in the order of these celestial objects. Cuneiform evidence of systematic observation of astronomical phenomena and schematization of the celestial sky is first attested in Old Babylonian versions of Enūma Anu Enlil dated circa the 18th-century BCE. The passage at the close of Enūma Anu Enlil Tablet 22 (a lunar eclipse tablet) has Anu, Enlil, and Ea 'draw' the

constellations as likenesses of the gods/goddesses. In the Enuma Elish, Marduk "constructed stations for the gods[/goddesses], aligning their astral likenesses as constellations." It is only in the 2nd millennium BCE that texts appear which are dealing with phenomena in the sky. In these texts we see a desire to find out how the skies are organised, and a belief that this organization can be understood and described in relatively simple ways. The use of observation is limited: while obviously one must look at the sky to be able to say something about it, schematic approaches were predominant .... An example for this are the so-called Three-stars-each texts which probably go back to between 1500 and 1000 BCE. They list, for each month of the Babylonian calendar, three constellations which are supposed to become visible in this month: one constellation to the North, one near the equator [there is no word for equator in these texts], and one to the South; it is furthermore stated that the same constellations disappear again after six months. This gives a neat scheme of 36 constellations from whose risings one could tell the time of year. However, it would not work in practice: first of all, the period of visibility is different for stars depending on their declination; it is simply incorrect to assign all of them a visibility of six months. Then, the Babylonian calendar is not easily attuned to the solar year so that helical risings of stars will not stay in the same month every year. And, just to indicate that we are far from a secure interpretation, the lists also include planets, which are subject to entirely different visibility conditions, independent of the time of the year; finally there are even variant forms of the list which have only ten constellations - instead of 12 - which makes an alignment with the months of the year impossible. The Three-stars-each lists may be seen as attempts to organise what is known about stars. At about the same time an astronomical text was compiled, called Mul-Apin (which means Plough star) after its first word. It is only attested on tablets from the 7th century [BCE] onwards, but probably goes back to the 13th century BCE." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and society." In: Valls-Gabaud, D. and Boksenberg, A. (Editors). The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture. Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Pages 62-33).) Note: Hermann
Hunger dates the composition of both the Astrolabe/Three-stars-each texts and the Mul-Apin compilation to the same period circa 13th-century BCE. (See: Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and Society." In: Valls-Gabaud, D. and Boksenberg, A. (Editors). The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture. Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Pages 62-73).)
Mesopotamian astronomers focused on collecting (planetary) data and analysing them for periodic returns of similar situations. Cuneiform tablets from the 3rd-millennium BCE reveal for the first time some knowledge of the planet Venus (i.e., Inanna as morning star, Inanna as evening star). (We have no convincing hints from nonliterate cultures that the difference between fixed stars and planets were known.)
The Venus tablets of Ammisaduqa are the oldest surviving texts on planetary astronomy. (The early observations of Venus recorded for 17 years during the reign of Ammi-zaduga does not imply any elaborate astronomical knowledge by the Babylonians. The especially bright planet would have attracted systematic observation and a series of astronomical omens. With Venus having a nearly circular orbit no water-clock or instrument for measuring angles was required.) However, the formation of Babylonian astronomy was not primarily dependent upon observation but more upon the development of schematic models. Babylonian astronomy - at any stage was not primarily observational. Babylonian astronomy was concerned with the description of celestial phenomena by numerical schemes. In early Babylonian astronomy observations played a minor role. In the development of late Babylonian astronomy observations still played a minor role. (However, from circa mid 8thcentury BCE onwards observations/skywatching became systematic.) The absence of exactness in Babylonian astronomy existed until the last half of the 1st-millennium BCE. The last stage of Mesopotamian astronomy dated from the Persian period to the end of cuneiform writing. This late and final phase of Mesopotamian astronomy involves the production of precise mathematical tables describing lunar, solar, and planetary theory (i.e., motion). This genre of late mathematical astronomy represents a departure from traditional astronomical materials such as the so-called "Astrolabes" and Mul.Apin. The earlier traditional astronomy of the "Astrolabes" and Mul.Apin were concerned with the course of observable events in the sky and the endeavour to correlate astronomical activity with the passage of time (i.e., with the days of the ideal astronomical year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each). A typical observational event was the helical risings of stars (i.e., fixed stars, constellations, and planets).
Based on the nature of the surviving texts, astronomy in Mesopotamia divides historically into 2 approaches/methods. The first approach existed during the late 2nd- and early 1st-millennia BCE; the second approach existed during the Seleucid period. The earliest examples of astronomical texts show that a characteristic feature of the first approach of Babylonian astronomy was to deal with numerical schemata. Early Babylonian astronomy was highly schematic. This early schematic computational means of predicting phenomena without use of detailed observations prepared the way for the eventual development of lunar and planetary theories. This late approach appeared in the Seleucid period (after 300 BCE). The foundation of Babylonian mathematical astronomy was built upon the recognition of period relations. These took 2 forms - lunar and

planetary periodicity. Periodicity was a central preoccupation. It was conceived of and dealt with in a quantitative arithmetical way (i.e., through counting). The goal of Babylonian astronomy was the determination of the date and position of individual phenomena. The determination of the motion of a planets - and the idea of continuous motion along a circular path - was irrelevant. (See the recent article: Rochberg, Francesca. "Periodicities and Period Relations in Babylonian Celestial Sciences." (2014). In: Kozuh, Michael. et al. (Editors). Extraction & Control: Studies in honor of Mathhew W. Stolper. (Pages 211-218).)
Circa the beginning of the 20th-century, the pioneering work of of Jesuits Joseph Epping and Franz Kugler showed that there existed in the ancient Near East an astronomical tradition that was different to that known from the works of the Hellenistic astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy and his successors. Cuneiform tablets recovered in the 19th-century from Babylon and Uruk revealed details of an astronomy that was both observational (but not rigidly so) and computational, and based on arithmetical functions rather than kinematic/geometrical models. The primary goal of Babylonian astronomy was the calculation of certain phenomena for the moon and the planets, such as the length of the lunar month, the eclipses of the sun and moon, the first and last visibilities of the planets, rather than the determination of the position of the celestial bodies at an arbitrary time. The methods by which the Babylonian astronomers calculated these phenomena were not based on kinematic/geometrical models such as those used by Claudius Ptolemy. Instead they used arithmetical functions based on the periodicities in the motions of the sun, moon, and planets. (The empirical rules of eclipse prediction in Babylonia did not require a physical explanation.)

The progress in astronomy made at different periods of Babylonian history is now quite well understood. During the first 2-3 millennium of Mesopotamian history there is really only limited empirical observations and the development of schematic models. A scheme of continual empirical observations was only begun during the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE. In the mid 8th-century BCE, under king Nabonassar (first king of the 9th dynasty of Babylon, ruled circa 747–734 BCE), there was a revival of interest in astronomy. In the 7th-century BCE, for the first time, Babylonian scholars try to foresee when and where certain phenomena in the sky will happen. During the reign of Nabonassar (mid 8th-century BCE) there was a significant increase in the quality and frequency of astronomical observations. A system of sophisticated mathematical astronomy was only developed during the last half of the 1st-millennium BCE. Babylonian astronomy activity during the 1st-millennium BC included astronomical observation, the prediction of future astronomical events using cycles, the development of mathematical astronomy, and the use of astronomical data in various kinds of astrology. Most of the preserved astronomical texts date from the Achaemenid and Seleucid periods and attest to an already fully developed practice. Recently identified tablets containing material from the early Neo-Babylonian period, however, show that there was considerable development in the kind of astronomical observations that were made between the middle of the 7th and the middle of the 6th centuries BCE. Also, these texts show that methods of astronomical prediction which relied upon the identification of astronomical periods and the use of past observations were developed and used during this same period. This was a key stage in the formation of Babylonian astronomy.
The earliest recorded use of astronomy among the Greeks appear in the poems of Homer and Hesiod (circa 8thcentury BCE). In Babylonia/Mesopotamia observational astronomy had been systematically practiced and recorded since the 8th-century BCE and astronomical systems (for periodic motions of the celestial bodies i.e., moon and planets) were already being developed.
Basic stages in the development of Babylonian astronomy are: (1) the astronomy of the Astrolabe genre; (2) the more accurate astronomy of Mul.Apin (a compendium of star lists and schematic methods of calculating astronomical phenomena); and (3) the principles of the emerging mathematical astronomy of the Late Babylonian

period. "Major deities such as Marduk, Anu, Enlil, and Ea were believed to have arranged the stars in heaven in early times, and gods are often identified with stars and constellations in astronomical works such as the "Astrolabes" and Mul-Apin." (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Page 8).) Note: Mul.Apin does not contain technical mathematical astronomy that is typical of the later Persian and Hellenistic periods in Babylonia.
It was understood the planets ("wild sheep") do not appear in the same place with respect to the eastern or western horizons at their first and last visibilities. This prompted a rough estimate of the intervals of their visibility and invisibility to be made.
The methods of Babylonian astronomy were different from anything else known and were considered to be unique. However, traces of it began to be found in Greek and Indian astronomy, and then in Demotic texts from Egypt. (Demotic script is Egyptian hieroglyphic writing of cursive form that was used in handwritten texts from the early 7th-century BCE until the 5th-century CE.). With the discovery by Alexander Jones of nearly 200 Greek astronomical texts (dating from the 1st-century CE) amongst the papyri in Demotic script recovered in the 19th and 20th centuries at Oxyrhynchus (a city in Upper Egypt, located about 160 km south-southwest of Cairo) it is now known that astronomy reflecting cuneiform sources was contemporary with Claudius Ptolemy. The astronomical papyri contain 2 types of astronomy being practiced at Oxyrhynchus: Greek kinematic/geometrical and Babylonian arithmetical. The astronomy being practiced at Oxyrhynchus was computational; no evidence of astronomical observations exist. The majority of the astronomical papyri were connected with practical astrology. In his book, Alexander Jones has grouped the astronomical papyri into 5 categories (Astronomical Papyri from Oxyrhynchus (2 Volumes, 1999): (1) theoretical and instructional texts, (2) primary tables, (3) ephemerides and almanacs, (4) miscellaneous tables, and (5) horoscopes.
The 3 fundamental coordinate systems in astronomy are the horizon system, the equator system, and the ecliptic system. The Babylonian method of designating celestial positions went through 3 stages of development. The early method involved the use of the horizon. The natural horizon, especially in a level region, was the first readily available reference device. In Mesopotamia the horizon system was important. (By the early 1stmillennium BCE ways to measure time at night was the rising, culmination, and setting of stars/constellations.) Also, the 3 ways of Ea, Anu, and Enlil (= the stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil) were developed in the early 2ndmillennium BCE. It was loosely equatorially based. (There is no word for 'equator' in the astrolabe texts. The celestial equator was not known for most of the history of Mesopotamian astronomy. In Mesopotamian astronomy there was no coordinate system based on the celestial equator.) The stars visible in the Babylonian night sky were originally divided into into 3 paths (ways) = the night sky was divided into 3 parts = northern, central, and southern regions. The stars of the path of Enlil in the northern region of the sky are, in modern terms, estimated to be within + 17 degrees of declination north. The stars of the path of Ea in the southern region of the sky are, in modern terms estimated to be within - 17 degrees of declination south. The stars of the path of Anu, located between the north and south paths, in the central region (but not strictly an equatorial band), are in modern terms, estimated to be within + 17 degrees of declination north and - 17 degrees of declination south. This system originated in the Old Babylonian period and continued until the Neo-Babylonian period. Celestial reference systems: The 1st reference system of the Paths of Ea, Anu and Enlil are interpreted either as arcs across the celestial sky, or as the eastern horizon. The 2nd reference system was the 17 ecliptical constellations describing the Path of the Moon. The 3rd reference system was the system of (approximately) 30 'normal stars.' The 4th reference system was the zodiacal signs. Prior to circa 1100 BCE, in the so-called astrolabe texts (based on the 3 ways/paths of Ea, Anu, and Enlil), the positions of celestial bodies were cited with respect to the particular path at the horizon. After circa 1100 BCE the system of 17/18 marking stars/asterisms "in the path of the moon" was used. Later, this system was replaced by the zodiac (which has survived to the present day in the Greek constellation set). The method used in the Seleucid period (312/311 BCE-64/63 BCE) for non-mathematical astronomical texts involved the positions of celestial bodies (longitudes) being located with reference to another system of marking stars; the approximately 30 "standard" stars/asterisms along the ecliptic called (after Epping's terminology) Normalsterne/Normal-stars (but 'counting stars' is a better descriptor). Concurrently, the Seleucid period mathematical astronomical texts expressed longitudes in degrees within the 12 zodiacal signs, estimated from a "vernal point" (established by a bright star).
Circa 700 BCE a system of "counting stars" were established - but for some reason unevenly distributed - around the proximity of the ecliptic (i.e., within the path of the moon and planets). The Normal Stars were used as observational reference points and provided the basis for a positional system. Distance with respect to a particular Normal Star was noted in cubits and fingers. Normal Stars are particularly used in the Astronomical Diaries. There is no standardised/complete list of Normal Stars - about 34 Normal Stars are known.

Late Babylonian astronomers used a reference system based on a local observer. Babylonian astronomers measured the sky with their hands. When the arm is extended out the little finger has an apparent width of 1° and the hand span (the distance between the ends of the thumb and little finger) has an apparent width of 15°. The positions of stars in the night sky were measured according to: (1) their altitude (the angle above the observer's horizon), or elevation, in degrees between the horizon (0°) and the zenith (90°) and (2) their azimuth (the angle measured clockwise from north along the horizon to the point on the horizon that lies beneath the star) in degrees from north (0°), east (90°), south (180°) or west (270°). The meridian is an imaginary large circle that passes through the zenith from north to south, dividing the sky in two: the eastern and the western halves. When an object crosses the meridian it has reached its maximum height in the sky. The Sun, or any star culminates when it crosses the (line of the) meridian. (The Sun crosses the line of the meridian around noon every day.) The meridian covers a total angle of 180° (-90° to 90°) and the horizon a total angle of 360°.
A sophisticated system of Babylonian stellar coordinates did not exist until circa the 3rd-century BCE. From the earliest period of Babylonian astral science - the Old Babylonian period dating to the early 2nd-millennium BCE to the 8th-century BCE a system of 3 "paths" and constellations was used. From the 8th-century BCE to the Seleucid period the position of the moon and planets was given by describing their distance from nearby bright stars or constellations. However, there was no rigidly defined standardised system in place. The earliest known systematic use of spherical coordinates is found in Babylonian astronomical texts dating to the Seleucid period. It comprised a form of ecliptic coordinates. During the last 3 centuries BCE systematic ephemerids for the moon and planets were computed. (According to Otto Neugebauer the completeness of the Babylonian source material makes it unlikely that lunar and planetary ephemerids were computed earlier than the middle of the 3rd-century BCE.) In the ephemerids ecliptic coordinates are used by giving longitudes expressed in degrees in relation to zodiacal signs, and - in the case of lunar ephemerids only - latitudes in degrees north and south of the ecliptic.
Likely the Babylonians used a simple instrument - similar to the medieval Jacob's staff, which used a graded movable cross-bar - which simplified calculating angular distance between 2 celestial objects (i.e., stars or planets). A Jacob's staff was in use in 284 BCE by Aristarchus.
In marking the celestial sphere the concepts used represent the projection of features of the terrestrial environment and scheme of cartography i.e., the 3 celestial roads/paths, and the horizon as the "cattle pen" with the celestial bodies designated the "cattle" and "sheep." In Sumerian and Akkadian mythological poetry heaven and earth were counterparts. Heaven (divine AN) was paired with "earth" (divine KI). "Earth" (ersetu) included everything that lay under heaven. (The most common names for 'heaven' in all periods - both as a whole and for individual levels - is Sumerian singular noun AN (also a god name) and Akkadian plural noun šamū. Numerous examples of AN = šamū appear in bilingual texts and lexical lists.) In texts AN frequently occurs as a name for all of heaven with KI ('earth'), forming the cosmic pair AN.KI. AN and KI were the 2 principal and inseparable parts of physical space. This idea led to terrestrial cartography/metrology terms being used to describe celestial cartography. According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz the Mesopotamian sky was geometric in nature - it was created using rectangles.
During the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE knowledge of Babylonian astronomy and omenology reached Egypt, Palestine/Israel, Anatolia, India, Greece, and eventually even China. Interchange of Babylonian astronomy with the west was particularly prevalent during the Hellenistic period.

Babylonian astral records comprise 3 main groups of materials: (1) a large omen literature going back to the early 2nd-millennium BCE; (2) the Letters and Reports by scribes to the Assyrian kings (dating mostly from the mid 7th-century BCE); and (3) the Astronomical Cuneiform Texts, Goal Year Texts, Almanacs, etc. (dating from the late 4th-century BCE), that incorporated sophisticated arithmetical models. (Goal-year texts contain collections of past astronomical records, likely abstracted from the Astronomical Diaries, used in the prediction of astronomical events. for a particular "goal-year." Surviving goal-year texts are dated within the period 236-24 BCE.) The early omen literature and so-called astrolabe texts are from Babylonia. The Assyrian period astrological reports are from Nineveh. Cosmology and the observation and interpretation of astral phenomena formed a major field of 1st-millennium BCE Mesopotamian scholarship. During the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, reports of astronomical observations and their interpretation per omenology were regularly sent to the Assyrian kings in Nineveh. The largest variety and largest number of astronomical texts are from Babylon. Astronomical texts (both observational and mathematical) have also been recovered from Uruk but date circa 500 BCE to 150 BCE. There is no firm evidence for similar long-term systematic observational programs in other Mesopotamian cities other than Babylon and its circa 800 year Astronomical Diary program. At Babylon, systematic observations of celestial events began during the mid 8th-century BCE and continued to the 1st-century CE. By the 4th-century BCE sophisticated/complex mathematical schemes had been developed for calculating lunar and planetary phenomena.

Two types of astronomical records were established in the early 1st-millennium BCE. During the Assyrian period regular celestial observations of 2 sorts were implemented. During the 8th and 7th centuries BCE the Assyrian imperial court was the centre for the regular observation of celestial signs. The astronomical reports to the Assyrian kings ceased after the fall of the Assyrian empire in 610 BCE. A celestial observation program called the 'regular watch' was established in Babylon. The observational records resulting from this program continued until the 1st-century BCE, and are known today as the Astronomical Diaries. Some information in the Astronomical Diaries was not observed but calculated. As example, equinox and solstice dates. Uruk was also an important centre for astronomical activity.
The 2 important centres of Mesopotamian (mathematical) astronomy/astrology were the cities of Babylonia and Uruk. In the late 1st-millennium astronomy/astrology were centred in the temples. During the second half of the 1st-millennium BCE most of the Babylonian astronomers were employed in the main temples of Babylon and Uruk. This was not the case earlier.
There is a paucity of astronomical texts between the Hittite solar omen ("omen of the sun god")/solar eclipse (unknown whether referring to total or annular of several solar eclipses at that period) text (KUB 14.4) of 1335 BCE during the reign of the Hittite king Mursilis II (circa 14th-century BCE) and the reign of Bel-ibni, a Babylonian nobleman who served as king of Babylon for several years as the nominee of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (circa late 8th-century BCE). All that exists in between is the limmu (eponym) list of Bur Sagale (Bur Saggile) (in the reign of king Assur-din III), who witnessed an Assyrian total solar eclipse in 763 BCE. What does exist as records of general Mesopotamian astronomy of the late 2nd-millennium BCE and early 1stmillennium BCE are: (1) the astrological omen series Enuma Anu Enlil, (2) the compendium Mul.Apin, (3) various star lists, and (4) Late Assyrian astrological reports. Note: The claim that the oldest recorded eclipse in human history describes the shadow of a total solar eclipse falling across the Bronze Age city of Ugarit in 1223 BCE is disputed. The issue of whether the wording on the tablet actually records a solar eclipse is at least uncertain. The lack of first-hand knowledge of ancient eclipse data, recorded in languages that are no longer communicable or difficult to decipher, transmission and translation errors have frequently beset investigators searching for ancient eclipse reports/data. There is a problematic report of a supposed solar eclipse mentioned on a cuneiform tablet (KTU 1.78 = PRU 2.162 = RS 12.061) found in 1948 among the ruins of Ugarit (Ras Shamra, Syria). A possible translation of this enigmatic report is "The day of the Moon of Hiyaru was put to shame: the Sun went in, (with) her gate(keeper), Rashap [Mars?]." It was first linked by Sawyer & Stephenson (1970) to the solar eclipse of 3 May 1375 BCE on the assumption that it had been total as viewed from Ugarit. A later analysis by de Jong and van Soldt (1987/89) re-dated the report to 5 March 1223 BCE. More recently, the text has been linked to the solar eclipses of 21 January 1192 BCE and 9 May 1012 BCE. These are all deemed matching eclipse dates (due the non-unique interpretations of the Ugaritic tablet KTU 1.78). Other scholars question whether the solar eclipse was total or whether the tablet actually refers to an eclipse at all. The assyriologists Christopher Walker and Hermann Hunger have quite convincingly shown that the Ugaritic (Syrian) clay tablet KTU-1.78 (originally dated to 1374 BCE but dating later revised to 1223 BCE) does not contain a record of an eclipse as claimed. One early translation of the tablet gave: "the day of the new moon in the month of (April-May) was put to shame. The sun went down in the daytime with Mars in attendance. This means the overlord will be attacked by his vassals." The assyriologist Christopher Walker (Nature 338 (1989) 204-205) wrote: "The translation of this Ugaritic text is not beyond doubt, to put it mildly. In particular, "was put to shame" was also translated as "on the sixth" (day) and again differently by others. "went down" is the same word as that used for "to set" (said of celestial bodies) in cognate languages. "in the daytime" is not in the text. The last sentence has also been translated as: "Livers were inspected: (it meant) danger". This probably suffices to show that there is no reliable solar eclipse record from Ugarit." The assyriologist Hermann Hunger wrote (2002?): "Please exclude the supposed solar eclipse of -1374 from your list. As you quote yourself, the word used means "to set". The beginning ("put to shame") is also uncertain. There is no indication of an eclipse, but just to sunset, and (the god) Reshep being in attendance. Whether Reshep is Mars here, is also open to doubt. If it is, we have an observation of Mars at (after) sunset. It is used as an omen, so no astronomy is involved." See the discussion of the text in: Drought, Death, and the Sun in Ugarit and Ancient Israel by Ola Wikander (2014). A summary of the various differing translations of the text is given in Religious Texts from Ugarit by Nicolas Wyatt (2nd edition, 2002, Pages 366-367).
Extant Babylonian tablets containing serious records of astronomical observations fall into 2 groups separated by some 1000 years: (1) The list of Venus dates made during the reign of King Ammisaduqa (first half of 2nd millennium BCE, perhaps circa 1645-1625 BCE). It is essentially a single text. (2) The 'astronomical diaries' originating in Babylon (dating from 7th-century, but likely beginning a circa mid 8th-century BCE). The letters written by various astronomers/astrologers to the royal court in Assyrian in the 7th-century BCE are not included with the 2 groups of serious observational texts. The first astronomical phenomena computed by the Babylonians

were: (1) the duration of day and night, (2) the rising and setting of the moon, and (3) the appearance and disappearance of Venus. They date to the 2nd-millennium BCE.
The earliest records of Babylonian astronomical observations are the so-called Venus tablets which were written to catalogue Venus omens for the king Ammisaduqa (reigned 17th-century BCE). These particular Venus observations were made in order to provide empirical material for omina. (Some scholars believe, however, that Venus tablet data, or a least some of it, was calculated.) Note: Regarding Tablet 63 of the Enūma Anu Enlil series. The issue is whether it contains real observations or not. An astronomical text with omens, or an omen text related to actual observations or not? The tablet contains a sequence of omens relating to the first visibility/appearance and the last visibility/first disappearance of Venus. Uniquely, unlike the other omens in this omen series, they are associated with specific dates covering the 21 years of the reign of king Ammisaduqa. (Ammisaduqa was the 10th and next to last king of the Old Babylonian dynasty (= First Dynasty of Babylon) The last king of the Hammurabi dynasty was Samsuditana, the successor of Ammisaduqa.) The tablet supposedly records an actual series of observations of Venus. Because the omens are associated with actual dates it has usually been accepted that the omens relate to actual observations of the phenomena of Venus. However, it is well understood that omen statements are not reports of actual observations, but refer only to potentially observable events. This fact is clear from the large number of omens that relate to events that are in fact impossible.
Mesopotamian astronomy until the Assyrian period is largely qualitative. Observations during this period of the history of Mesopotamian astronomy show little exactness. It is only from the Assyrian period that systematic observational reports begin to appear and the mathematical treatment of astronomy begins. See also: George, Andrew and Al-Rawi, Farouk. (1991[-1992]). "Enuma Anu Enlil XIV and other early astronomical tables." (Archiv für Orientforschung, Band 38-39, Pages 52-73). The cuneiform material shows the Babylonians used simple mathematical relations for the length of daylight as a function of day of the year. Originating during the Old Babylonian period, it was retained in use. Also, the Babylonians retained their belief that their computations applied only within the narrow area from Uruk to Babylon.
The Babylonian astral sciences were carried out by a group of priestly literati within the institutional framework of the great and enduring temples of Babylon and Uruk. In effect, Babylonian professionals systematically observing the sky for purposes of celestial divination developed possession of a quantitative and predictive astronomy. There is nothing in the texts comprising mathematical astronomy that set out: (1) what the practitioners believed they were doing, and (2) what the practitioners believed the heavens were doing. Babylonian astronomy, though technically sophisticated, was not theoretical. Speculation was confined to the content of myths. Babylonian astronomers were analytical (as example: focused on the predictability of astral phenomena) but never tried to explain observational facts. Also, primitive forms of celestial divination or astrology did not stimulate the growth of scientific astronomy. From the Old Babylonian period onwards, astronomical observation and divination went hand-in-hand until at least the 8th-century BCE. The American assyriologist Erica Reiner (1924-2005) believed that omen astronomy and mathematical astronomy were separate disciplines of scholarship; especially from the 5th-century BCE onwards. The period between 400/450? and 200 BCE might be considered the last period of innovations in Babylonian astral science It was during this period that the zodiac and the horoscope were invented. The Babylonian zodiac developed from the tradition of a series (17/18) constellations (stars/asterisms) marking the path of the moon.
Within Babylonian invention and usage it is indicated there was one canonical version of the zodiac, at least after consolidation. However, there was a later Greek version of the Babylonian zodiac, incorporating some changes when borrowed. There were also some Greek/Roman changes after borrowing.
The zodiac was designed to be an accurate way of charting celestial movements in a map-like form. Beginning in the 5th-century BCE, the zodiac was marked by 12 30-degree arcs fixed on the celestial sphere. The positions of the moon and planets are marked in astronomical diaries using degrees within the zodiacal signs (but without recognising an actual celestial sphere). Babylonian texts usually expressed the position of the moon and the planets by both the zodiacal sign and the degrees in it, measured from the beginning of that sign. Thus the location of the moon and planets are not only related to other celestial objects, but determined in relation to space itself. Additionally, the zodiac was also concurrently combined with ideas of celestial influences over human affairs and this stimulated the appearance of new genres of astral magic and astral medicine.
It has been remarked that Babylonian mathematical astronomy appears rather suddenly, without any apparent connection with earlier astronomical texts. This is not quite correct. Several important improvements in observational techniques established the basis for mathematical astronomy. These were the keeping of Astronomical Diaries beginning under king Nabonassar (Nabū-nāşir) in the 8th-century BCE and the later recording of helical rising phenomena beginning circa 500 BCE (but tracing back to the period of the last

Sargonids in the 7th-century BCE). The basis for Babylonian mathematical astronomy was the information recorded in the so-called Astronomical Diaries. The fundamental observational text of the Babylonian astronomers, for astronomical, and meteorological data such as types of clouds, rainbows, etc., was the Astronomical Diary. They also contained predictions based on astronomical observations. Additionally, the Astronomical Diaries contain the same kinds of entries for solstices and equinoxes and the Sirius phenomena as recorded in the Almanacs and the Normal Star (NS) Almanacs. The Astronomical Diaries recording project was conceived of and designed circa the middle of the 8th-century BCE (and likely the beginning was the 1st year of king Nabū-nāşir, 746 BCE.
The evidence that astronomical records were diligently kept from the reign of Nabu-nasir onwards implies that the format of Astronomical Diaries (= astronomical records) were began at this time. The project was then dependably implemented for at least 700 years. The evidence supports the conclusion that detailed records of various things and not just astronomical phenomena were kept from the reign of Nabu-nasir. The Astronomical Diaries are divided into sections, each section covering the almost day-to-day events of one month. Most of the phenomena recorded are of an astronomical or meteorological nature but at the end of each section there are statements about market prices, the height of the river, and matters of historical interest, etc. The type of information collected and recorded remained almost stable. From the earliest, the astronomical data recorded is also accompanied by terrestrial data: historical comments, ominous events, river levels, market prices, and such.
[Note: Haubold, Johannes., Steele, John., and Stevens, Kathryn. (2019). Keeping Watch in Babylon: The Astronomical Diaries in Context. Extact from BMCR review (2020.02.02) by Erlend Gehlken, Universität Frankfurt/Main: "In the first article John Steele examines the early history of the Diaries. There are only a few examples from the time before 400 BC. According to common doctrine, the first Diary was written at the beginning of the reign of King Nabonassar (747–734 BC). Nabonassar has given his name to a whole era – the socalled "era of Nabonassar". Not only is the compilation of the Diaries (and also the "Babylonian Chronicles") supposed to have been started in this period by order, systematic observational astronomy is believed to have originated in it. Steele carefully balances the arguments of individual scholars for the introduction of an "era of Nabonassar". The results are impressive: that era is definitively a modern fiction (as is mentioned by the author, this was postulated as early as 1968 by J. A. Brinkman, but not proven in detail). The first preserved "standard" Diary was only written under Nebuchadnezar II, in 568 BC."]
The Astronomical Diaries began by recording data in a simplistic manner but soon used a more exact terminology. The Astronomical Diaries rapidly became records of those phenomena that were recognised to be predictable, with the aim of providing a database that made these phenomena still more accurately predictable. (In the Astronomical Diaries the phenomena dealing with the moon were the most important of the astronomical events recorded. In addition to recording a variety of observed astronomical and atmospheric phenomena, the Astronomical Diaries also record historical, economic, and ecological observations.) The fact that only astronomical phenomena which are periodic and therefore capable of being described mathematically are included - and almost all of the phenomena regarded as ominous in the series Enūma Anu Enlil were constantly ignored, even though still constantly observed, recorded, and interpreted for the royal court at Nineveh - leads to the conclusion that the astronomical observations entered into the Astronomical Diaries (both observations and approximate estimates when observations were unable to be made) were from the beginning of the project intended to be the basis of a mathematical, predictive system. (See: Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia by Hunger/Pingree (1999) Page 144.) The Babylonians used criteria (not yet known) to estimate the "ideal" dates of the planetary phenomena. The ability to predict astronomical phenomena offered new scope for prognostication.
Circa the 7th-century BCE, at the time of Assurbanipal, the class of sky observers were beginning to understand that the 'mechanics' of the sky is geometric in nature and working with this realisation mathematically eventually led to the more precise mathematical astronomy of the Seleucid period. The establishment of ziqpu stars in the Path of Enlil, and ponderings on stellar motion in the Path of Enlil, contributed to such. Astronomical cuneiform texts from the 6th to the 4th centuries BCE show intermediate stages before the emergence of the fully developed systems of Babylonian mathematical astronomy.
The later Astronomical Diaries and related texts include some 200 records of eclipse observations and predictions. It was only circa the middle of the 7th-century BCE that the practice of keeping permanent records of regular (systematic) astronomical observations began in Babylon. During the pioneering period it had been thought that Babylonian astronomy was almost entirely observational and almost completely atheoretical (independent of theory). Only the Babylonian Diaries were predominantly observational and even they included a lot of predictions. The eclipse tables the almanacs, and the ephemerides mainly comprise predictions whose ingenious mathematical bases approximate observational data. The record-keeping is preserved in the so-called Astronomical Diaries. (The Astronomical Diaries are one of the largest collections of observed data for any

period in world history before the modern era. They also the most important source on various aspects of Late Babylonian history.) Note: There are reasons for regarding the so-called Astronomical Diaries and Chronicles as being closely connected. The Mesopotamian (i.e., Assyrian and Babylonian) Chronicles are histographical texts (official records of the royal court) dealing mostly with the 2nd half of the 2nd-millennium BCE and the entire 1st-millennium (to the first century BCE).

The Diaries represent records of daily astronomical observations made in the Neo-Babylonian period by professionals who, according to excavated late documents, were employed and paid specifically to make these observations. Their job also included recording their observations in the diaries and preparing astronomical tables and yearly almanacs. For at least half of the history of the astronomical diaries it would perhaps it would be more convenient to speak of Babylonian activities for recording astronomical data instead of Babylonian astronomy. Initially there was mostly information gathering. The information gathered was not utilised for astronomical purposes until the 4th-century BCE. A diary usually covered six months of observation. It should be emphasized that although the major bulk of the celestial phenomena referred to in the diaries are actual observations, some of the recorded events are not observations but rather predictions based on certain mathematical calculations. Sometimes this is clearly stated whereas on other occasions it is implicit, as in the case when the sky is mentioned as having been overcast. In addition to the astronomical data, the diaries also contain some non-astronomical information: on the weather, the prices of six basic commodities, the height of the river Euphrates, and certain historical events.
Translations of the Diaries are published in the multi-volume Astronomical Diaries and Related Texts from Babylonia, edited by Abraham Sachs and Hermann Hunger (1988-2014). The volumes are the outcome of immense labour embracing the collection, collation, transcription, translation, and the synchronization of precise dates with astronomical events recorded in the diaries from Babylonia.

Note: The Diaries are called Astronomical Diaries because they mostly record astronomical and meteorological phenomena. They list astronomical phenomena for a given year in chronological sequence, like a calendar. The Diaries are divided into sections with each section recording the almost day-to-day events of one month. At the end of each section there are statements about market prices, the height of the river, and matters of historical interest.
The observational (empirical) data on which Babylonian theoretical astronomy is based is recorded in the so-called Astronomical Diaries. The Astronomical Diaries were a system for accurately describing astronomical phenomena based on regular daily observations. These were meticulously maintained daily records of certain celestial events, kept for circa 800 years from circa 8th-century BCE to the 1st-century CE. The Astronomical Diaries show that the Babylonians were primarily interested in observing cyclical phenomena. The observations in the Astronomical diaries are written in a very abbreviated form of cuneiform script. The later mathematical basis of Babylonian planetary theory (derived from Astronomical Diaries) is set out in the form of either 'procedure texts' (containing collections of rules for the computation of 'ephemerides') or as (tabular) 'ephemerides' i.e., tables enabling at least approximate prediction of future lunar and planetary phenomena. Babylonian Goal-Year texts contain collections of 'raw' astronomical observations (derived from Astronomical Diaries) to make predictions of future astronomical (lunar and planetary) phenomena (for a given year = the "goal year") using known lunar and planetary periodicities. (John Steele makes the point that Goal-Year texts contain collections of (mainly) observational data that could be used in making predictions for that year (rather than a coming "goal-year").) Babylonian almanacs contain collections of predicted astronomical phenomena for a given year. However, the Almanac data is not excerpted from observational texts (Astronomical Diaries) but is computed. Almost all lunar and planetary ephemerides date from the 3rd to the 1st centuries BCE. The so-called 'Goal-Year' texts are contemporary with the ephemerides. During the 2nd-half of the 1st-millennium BCE prediction, calculation, and observation were practiced together by the same scribes. Note: The work of Otto Neugebauer (ACT (1955)) shows there is no evidence of empirical corrections within ephemerides.
The Astronomical Diaries give the time of heliacal phenomena of the planets to the day of the calendar month and the location by zodiacal sign, sometimes specifying beginning or end of zodiacal sign. Also recorded in the Astronomical Diaries was the planets' passings of the Normal Stars, and each other. The moon and the planets are usually stated to be "above," "below," "in front of" (= to the west), or "behind" (= to the east), a Normal Star, and the distances are given in 'cubits' and/or 'fingers.' The only aspects of solar motion recorded in the extant Astronomical Diaries are the dates on the occurrences of the solstices and equinoxes and of the heliacal rising and setting and the acronychal rising of Sirius. Some of these dates for solstices may be based on actual observations, and not computed (= the statement "I did not watch"). The Astronomical Diaries provide a full listing of both lunar and solar eclipses, observed and predicted. Most Astronomical diaries extant cover the period from 385 BCE to 60 CE.
Over the 700-800 years covered by surviving cuneiform tablets (since the 8th-century BCE) dealing with astronomy there is an identifiable development in both accuracy and regularity of observation. The few surviving cuneiform tablets dealing with astronomy during the 8th-century BCE indicate an advanced level of both skill and observation. There are insufficient surviving/recovered astronomical tablets to trace the earlier history of astronomy in Babylonia and understand how many centuries it took to develop these capabilities.
The assyriologist David Brown (2000) has made a compelling case that prior to the mid 8th-century BCE there was no interest in predicting celestial events. (Over 100 years ago Franz Kugler, the pioneer of much of our knowledge of Babylonian astronomy, made a similar case.) The period schemes, intercalations, rules, etc. found in such late 2nd millennium texts as Enūma Anu Enlil, and Mul.Apin are aspects of celestial divination, not primitive astronomy or inaccurate astronomy. Even the so-called 'astrolabes' are primarily astrological documents.

Only after the mid 8th-century BCE was there a goal to predict celestial phenomena accurately (i.e., to perhaps a day). The Babylonian astronomical techniques that reached their highest point in the Seleucid period circa 200 BCE originated a half a millennium earlier, circa 700 BCE, when prediction became an all-important skill to the astronomers who practised astrological divination in the service of the Assyrian kings. According to David Brown (2000) through divinatory thinking an ideal state (scheme) of the universe was devised. In general, astral omens were not based on empirical observations. Rather they were developed through the application of a strict code. Observations were contrasted with this ideal representation of the universe and mismatches were interpreted as bad omens.
According to David Brown, the importance of celestial divination texts in the Neo-Assyrian period, and the special place of omen specialists in the royal court brought about the circumstances that eventually led to mathematical astronomy. Prediction of events in the sky began to be a key purpose of the activity of scholars at the Assyrian court in the 7th-century BCE who were involved with the interpretation of celestial omens for the king. Centuries later the prediction of some celestial events was achieved by both mathematical and other procedures. The class of Babylonian scholars who produced the non mathematical astronomical-astrological texts later created the the mathematical astronomical-astrological texts.
After circa 750 BCE Babylonian astronomy was developed primarily as mathematical theory (for being able to know/determine (predict) where the positions of the moon and planets would be in the night sky). In the 7thcentury BCE, for the first time, Babylonian scholars try to foresee when and where certain phenomena in the sky will happen. (Babylonian mathematical astronomy can be divided into 2 main areas: lunar theory and planetary theory.) The main focus of their effort was solving predictive problems relating to the motions of the moon and planets. In the late 1st-millennium BCE the Babylonians developed sophisticated theories for the motions of the planets. (Babylonian planetary theory was based more on conjunctions with the sun and moon than on conjunctions with the stars.) The high astronomical achievements of the Babylonians are found in the Hellenistic period in the ephemerides, the tables for calculations of new moons and eclipses, and in the planet tables. (By the Seleucid Era, the Babylonians had developed tables for predicting eclipses.) The Babylonians are the first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets. They produced individual planetary tables, in particular of Venus. Swerdlow has proposed that adverse weather led the Babylonian scribes to develop a mathematical theory of the moon and planets. When the skies were clear then observation of astronomical data for inclusion in the Diaries. When the skies were cloudy/rainy then computation of astronomical phenomena for inclusion in the Diaries.
Calendar issues contributed to the development of Mesopotamian astronomy. A nearly perfect calendar was not developed until the reign of king Nabonassar (first king of the 9th dynasty of Babylon, ruled circa 747–734 BCE) when Babylonian astronomers recognised that 235 lunar months are almost identical to 19 solar years. (The difference is only 2 hours.) They concluded that 7 out of 19 years ought to be leap years with 1 extra (intercalary) month. The intercalary months were at first announced by the king (on the advice of his astronomer) but, after the capture of Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus in 539 BCE, priestly officials took over the function. They investigated the introduction of a standard procedure for the intercalation of months. The standard procedure for regulating the calendar was introduced in 503 BCE (but perhaps earlier) by Darius I the Great.
All cuneiform tablets with mathematical astronomy have been found in the ancient cities of Babylon and Uruk. Both were major Babylonian cities and centres of learning. The most important collection of astronomical material was kept in the temple library of Esagila (Esagil) in Babylon, which included the so-called Astronomical Diaries and numerous texts related to astronomy and astrology. Under Seleucid and Parthian rule Babylon became a major centre for astronomical research. (In Uruk the Resh temple held important scholarly libraries.) A lot of recovered astronomical tablets that went to the British Museum were from Esagila. The mathematical astronomical texts were written between circa 380 BCE and 48 BCE. The mathematical astronomical texts from Babylon cover this entire period. The majority of extant tablets were written after circa 220 BCE. The mathematical astronomical texts from Uruk are fewer and none are later that circa 170 BCE. Mathematical astronomy was used for predicting a wide range of phenomena connected with the Moon, the Sun, and the planets. The earliest known form of mathematical astronomy in antiquity was developed in Babylonia in the 5thcentury BCE. Rapid development of mathematical astronomy is indicated with the algorithms reaching their final stage of development by circa 350 BCE - 310 BCE. Hence the formative period of Babylonian mathematical astronomy is circa 400 BCE - 330 BCE. The beginning of Babylonian mathematical astronomy is dated to circa 400 BCE with the invention of the zodiac of 12 equal divisions as a coordinate system. The zodiacal coordinate system became an essential part of mathematical astronomy for computing (predicting) the positions of the Moon, the Sun, and the planets. The lunar tables are the most sophisticated and may contain up to 21 columns, each column tabulating a different astronomical quantity. Babylonian mathematical astronomical texts are dominated

by synodic tables. However, the application of such is unidentified. In the Seleucid era the beginning of the lunar month was no longer established by observation of the first lunar crescent, but by predicting it. However, apparently this was not done using the algorithms of mathematical astronomy.
There are 2 important classes of texts in Babylonian mathematical astronomy: ephemerides and procedure texts. Babylonian astronomy, in its most developed and valuable form, comprised the establishment of numerical relationships with the succession of specific celestial phenomena that preoccupied them. During the late period of Babylonian mathematical astronomy various different predictive methods were in use at the same time (there were 5 major systems), and all were considered equally legitimate.
Wayne Horowitz suggested in 2013 that Mesopotamian predictions of Venus phenomena could potentially date back the the emergence of mathematical astronomy if it turns out that the scribes of EAE were able to foretell the planets movements.
The mathematical basis of Babylonian planetary theory is set out in the form of either 'procedure texts' or as (tabular) 'ephemerides' i.e., tables enabling at least approximate prediction of future lunar and planetary phenomena. 'Procedure texts' contain collections of rules for the computation of 'ephemerides' i.e., explain the calculations for synodic or heliacal phenomena comprising the 'ephemerides.' Most of the predictive Babylonian planetary models that have survived are usually empirical and arithmetical (based on numerical sequences), and usually do not involve geometry, cosmology, or speculative philosophy. 'Procedure texts' date from the Seleucid era. A 'procedure text' (or 'proto-procedure text' representing a non-ACT approach to calculating solar and lunar motion) that may antedate the Seleucid era is BM 36712. During the Seleucid period (3rd-century BCE) 'goalyear texts' (related to the nontabular 'diaries' (= based on information excerpted from at least more than 12 diaries) and involving simple predictive methods) were used to predict the movements of the planets for a given year. Specifically, 'goal-year texts' "present for a given year the planetary data (dates of the Greek-letter phenomena [synodic or heliacal] and of the passing by of the Normal Stars by the moon and planets) for a certain number of years previous to the given year for each planet. ... There is also a column of lunar phenomena, that is, the occurrences of lunar eclipses and the "Lunar Six," .... (Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1999, Pages 167-168)." (Goal-year texts, in summary, contain Lunar Sixes, planetary phases, conjunctions of planets and (= with) Normal Stars, and eclipses.) During this period use of mathematical models replaced use of records of past observations to enable prediction. Most of the 'ephemerides' give calculated dates and longitudes for the synodic phenomena (including distinguishment of conjunctions, oppositions, and stationary positions). Very few give data for the planet between the synodic phenomena. For an inner planet (Mercury, Venus) the synodic phenomena are (1) its first appearance in the morning, Morning First; (2) its subsequent disappearance, Morning Last; (3) its first appearance in the evening, Evening First; (4) its disappearance in the evening, Evening Last; and (5) its stationary points. For an outer planet (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) the synodic phenomena are (1) its first appearance in the morning, Morning First; (2) its disappearance in the evening, Evening Last; (3) opposition; (4) the beginning of retrogression, Beginning Retrogression; and (5) the end of retrogression, End Retrogression.
System A and System B are arithmetical schemes for computing the position of the sun, moon, and the planets. The variable velocity of the sun, moon, and planets was taken into account in 2 ways: (1) either by the abrupt alternation of larger and smaller values, or (2) by means of values zigzagging up and down between 2 constant extremes. System A uses 'step functions' and System B uses 'linear zigzag functions.' When graphed, the motion of System A looks like a series of steps up and down, and so it is called a 'step' function. System A is more primitive than System B. The earliest preserved System A clay tablets (BM 36651, 36719, 37032, 37053) calculate an ephemeris for the planet Mercury from 424–401 BCE. Even though System B might appear to be a very rough tool for modelling periodic phenomena it is a very convenient computation. It is constructed in such a way that it exactly satisfies a certain period relation. Though at any given time the function may deviate from the empirical (observational) data, there is no accumulation of errors. There are large differences between lunar systems A and B and the planetary systems A and B.
The zigzag and step are useful labels but potentially misleading as the Babylonians are not known to have used graphs. There is no evidence that the Babylonians constructed kinematic/geometrical models of the motions of celestial bodies. There is no evidence they were concerned about the causes of the motions. Also, there is no evidence that they were curious about the physical composition of the celestial bodies. The goal of ancient Babylonian astronomy was to predict astronomical appearances but not to make any further sense of them. Predicting positions did not require any theoretical ideas about the celestial bodies. The Babylonians made astronomical observations and formulated algebraic rules for predicting future positions of the planets, the Sun, and the Moon. They studied how the celestial motions went but not why. Nor did they try to develop a single

comprehensive mathematical scheme that encompassed all their data. Otto Neugebauer concluded that Babylonian astronomical texts of the Seleucid period are scientific because everything has been eliminated from the astronomy except observations and the mathematical consequences of an initial hypothesis about the fundamental character of the movements. (Greek astronomers dealt with planetary motions differently to the Babylonians.)
Within the genre of mathematical astronomy texts, copies of texts are recognizable when numbers that are obviously errors (usually typical copyist errors) do not affect the subsequent calculations recorded.

Babylonian astrology was concerned with the welfare of the state and the king (and it was not horoscopic). The invention of the zodiac, which was fundamental to the development of mathematical astronomy, also enabled the

creation of new techniques within astrology. The astronomical data used to construct horoscopes seems to have been taken from both the Almanacs and the Ephemerides. Only in Hellenistic astrology was the horoscope of the individual introduced. Omens had importance in the Neo-Assyrian empire (Neo-Babylonian/Assyrian period). The rulers of the Persian (Achaemenid) and Macedonian/Greek (Seleucid and Parthian) empires who successively conquered Mesopotamia took little interest in traditional Babylonian omenology and its focus on the State. Introduced by the Babylonians was horoscopic (zodiacal) astrology involving forecasting the future for individual patrons. All the Babylonian horoscopes are dated to the birth of an individual. The pinnacle of Babylonian astrological influence was reached during the Hellenistic period. Astrology, based on an ancient Babylonian and Egyptian astral beliefs, took shape in the 3rd-century BCE. Extispicy (divination using entrails of sacrificed animals) was astrology's closest rival. Also, "The computational systems of Babylonian mathematical astronomy, which emerged at about the same time as did horoscopic astrology, cannot be accounted for by reason of their serving astrological purposes." (Rochberg, Francesca. "Babylonian Horoscopy: the Texts and their Relations." In: Swerdlow, Noel. (Editor). Ancient Astronomy and Celestial Divination. (1999, Pages 39-59; Page 55). However, John Steele believes that the astronomy practised in Babylon and Uruk during the Seleucid period was closely connected with astrology. Also, the astronomical developments of the Seleucid period may have been motivated by the needs of late astrology.
Babylonian omenology (celestial divination) thought that what happens in the sky did actually influence (affect) events on earth but only indicated them. The relation between an indicator of an event and the event indication is not necessarily a causal one. As example: In Babylonian liver divination what was seen in the liver was not believed to cause the event it indicated. In Babylonian omenology the gods/goddesses could be influenced to nullify the event indicated by a celestial sign. Simply, if appropriate actions were taken the indicated event could be averted. In later pre-Hellenistic Babylonian astrology celestial signs were thought of as indicating the imminent occurrence of certain terrestrial events, not as their causes. It was Hellenistic astrology which postulated there was causal connection. The belief that celestial bodies and their movements and relative positions have an influence (affect) on the personal lives of people originated in Greek (Hellenistic) astrology. Ptolemy was the first astronomer of note to pay serious attention to astrology. "In the second half of the first millennium BCE, new techniques were developed to gain insight into the future. One of them is found in what is loosely called horoscopes. It is not really correct to call these Babylonian texts horoscopes because they lack the consideration of the point of the ecliptic rising at the time of birth, which is called horoskopos in Greek. So the very detail from which the name horoscope is derived is not present in them. There are about 30 such texts known; the earliest two of them are datable to 410 BCE. They may be considered precursors of later Hellenistic horoscopes in the sense that they record computed astronomical phenomena on the date of birth." (Hunger, Hermann. (2011). "The relation of Babylonian astronomy to its culture and society." In: Valls-Gabaud, D. and Boksenberg, A. (Editors). The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture. Proceedings of the IAU Symposium No. 260, 2009. (Page 72).)
Babylonian astral science experienced an unprecedented sequence of developments during the period of Persian domination. This includes the introduction of the zodiac and the emergence of mathematical astronomy and horoscopic astrology near 400 BCE. Furthermore, these new forms of astral science were no longer pursued exclusively for the benefit of the king. For instance, horoscopes were produced for private individuals.
There is no evidence that even the later Babylonians had a sufficiently accurate system of measuring the heavens to enable them to identify the precession of the equinoxes. Also, the Babylonian calendar - and its system of adding extra months (some irregularly ordered by the reigning king) did not accurately make up for the accumulated differences between the solar year and the lunar year - remained quite confused (and inexact) until circa 300 BCE, when the Babylonians began to use a more reliable system.
The fame of the Chaldeans for astronomy spread throughout the Greco-Roman world.
After circa 300 BCE, Babylonian culture was subsumed under Greek culture. Whoever transcribed the Babylonian astronomical data into a format that the Greek astronomers could use must have understood the difficult and specialised Babylonian terms used in mathematical cuneiform astronomy. They were understood by relatively few scribes. The person must have been a Babylonian astronomer having full access to the Babylonian archives. It is highly unlikely to have been a Greek astronomer. We are informed that Callisthenes, Alexander's scholar-in-residence, who certainly stayed in Babylon, caused a lot of Babylonian data to be sent to Athens. There are approximately 20 so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca clay tablets that have been dated from the 1st-century BCE to the 2nd-century CE. They have Sumerian and/or Akkadian script on one side and the same text transliterated in to Greek on the other. Joachim Oelsner (1973) held that the so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca were the final form for the preservation of Sumerian and Akkadian texts when when knowledge of cuneiform was extinct. The Hellenistic Greeks who established colonies in Mesopotamia were basically in Uruk - not Babylon. They were interested in temple/cult issues and a number of them married local women.

Note: The evidence for Berossus (Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer) himself having moved to the Greek island of Cos to found a school of Babylonian astronomy is considered flimsy.
Basic Mesopotamian Terms for Phenomena Observed in the Visible Heavens
Term Meaning in Mesopotamian Astral Sciences
The electronic edition of The Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary (PSD) basically states: mul (shine) means "star; to shine, radiate (light) ...." and references Early Dynastic IIIb Period (circa 2540-2350 BCE); Lagash II Period (circa 2141-2122 BCE), and Old Babylonian Period (circa 1900/1800-1600 BCE). The assyriologist John Heise (Akkadian Language (1996) discussing signs used as determinatives has: "MUL (before) stars and constellations ... meaning Sum[erian] mul 'star', Akk[adian] kakkabu(m) 'star'.") The assyriologists Michael Rolf and Annette Zgoll also state ("Assyrian Astroglyphs." ZA, Volume 91, 2001) that MUL is a Sumerian logogram that means "star." (To date I have only seen 2 sources state that MUL can mean 'a star' or 'a star constellation.' However, no date references are given for this latter assertion. The assyriologist Jeanette Fincke states that 'MUL' refers to individual stars as well as constellations. The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (2014) writes that the determinative mul (Sumerian) = kakkabu (Akkadian) was used to "refer to to a full range of observed astronomical phenomena including the fixed stars, but also constellations, planets, mirages, comets, shooting stars, etc." Horowitz Sumerian logogram: mul; = Assyrian: kakkabu
Sumerian: udu.idem = Assyrian:
bibbu (Note: In ancient
adds that most often what is meant is a constellation.) A cursory read of the literature shows that the replicated MUL.MUL means "the stars." Also, MUL.MEŠ means 'stars.' According to the assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (2014), the term MUL.MEŠ may refer to the plurality of stars in constellations. Whilst some people would hold that MUL-AN means "constellation" the PSD basically states: mulan, written mul-an (star), means "heavenly star" and references the term to the Old Babylonian Period. The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) identifies that the (Akkadian) term lumāšu means constellation. (According to CAD, the word lumassu can refer to one of several stars whose heliacal rising or setting falls at or near solstices or equinoxes, can be simply a poetic word for stars in general, or can refer to zodiacal constellations.) In Akkadian the term lumāšu referred to the zodiacal constellations and logographically lumāšu was written as MUL.LU.MAS or LU.MAS.ŠI (lumāšu-stars). Picking up on this John Steele writes "The zodiacal signs as a group were referred to using the term LU-MASŬ (Akkadian: lumāsŭ), literally meaning 'constellation'." (See: "Celestial Measurement in Babylonian Astronomy." by John Steele (Annals of Science, Volume 64, Number 3, 2007, Pages 293-325).) It is indicated that MUL, the Sumerian determinative for 'star,' was also generally used to denote all other astral phenomena. There is no exclusive word for constellation. Also, the later Erica Reiner pointed out that the Sumerian dil.bat (DIL.BAT) = "bright or brilliant" = star, and also = Akkadian nebu/nabu (= bright); and Assyrian kakkabu = star.
In ancient Mesopotamia there were 2 categories of astronomical bodies/objects: 'stars' (mul = kakkabu) and 'planets' (udu.idem = bibbu). The astral category 'stars' includes all astral bodies/objects whose names are usually prefixed with the mul ('star') determinative. These include individual fixed stars, constellations, and the planets. The 7 astral bodies/objects considered planets in ancient Mesopotamia were: the Moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Excepting for the 5 planets all 'stars' maintain a fixed east-west movement in the sky. This fixed movement is maintained also in relation to the other stars. Also, the position of individual stars in the sky was maintained almost unchanged annually. Because the solar year

interval between the annual helical rising of fixed stars), the discrepancy over 70 years between solar and true astronomical calendars - is approximately 1 day. This is barely noticeable - if at all - over a single short lifetime expectancy of some 30-40 years in ancient times. The fixed stars were often compared with domesticated sheep and cattle (and goats). The astral category 'planets' appeared to move somewhat independently in relation to the 'stars.' Because of this the planets were compared with wild sheep and given the name bibbu 'wild sheep' in Akkadian/Assyrian. In Mesopotamian astronomy all 7 bibbu were listed as 'planets.' Though the Sun and Moon move from east to west their positions vary in relation to the positions of fixed stars. The planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn do not simply move from east to west but sometimes appear to stand still or even move backwards in a retrograde motion. The Akkadian term used for the retrograde motion of the planets is sahāru 'to turn back/'to go around.'

Note: A useful study of coloured stars in Babylonian uranography and also in Greek uranography is, Antike Beobachtungen farbiger Sterne by Franz Boll with contributions by Carl Bezold (1916/1918). Unfortunately it has not been translated into English. Star colours (ancient & modern, plus ancient Sirius) are discussed in detail. Also discussed are planetary colour doctrines in astrology. A detailed discussion of Boll/Bezold's work an ancient star colours from an astrophysical point of view is given in: Knut Lundmark, "Luminosities, Colours, Diameters, Densities, Masses of the Stars", in: G. Eberhard, A. Kohlschütter & H. Ludendorff (Editors), Handbuch der Astrophysik: Band V (Das Sternensystem) (Berlin: Julius Springer, 1932/33), Pages 210-697. Boll also cites a classical reference to propose that the Babylonians observed the colour of comets. I think that proposal remains with Boll. I have not seen it proposed by any other assyriologist or classicist.
Appendix 3: Interpreting Ugaritic Tablet KTU 1.78
The lack of first-hand knowledge of ancient eclipse data, recorded in languages that are no longer communicable or difficult to decipher, transmission and translation errors have frequently beset previous investigators of this problem. Examples of the latter are the nonunique interpretations of the Ugaritic tablet KTU 1.78, resulting in a matching solar eclipse date of May 3, 1375 B.C. or March 5, 1223 B.C., and different conclusions on how the Earth's rotation rate has been varying. A problematic report of a solar eclipse(?) mentioned on a cuneiform tablet (KTU 1.78 = PRU 2.162 = RS 12.061) found in 1948 among the ruins of Ugarit (Ras Shamra, Syria). A possible translation of this enigmatic report is "The day of the Moon of Hiyaru was put to shame: the Sun went in, (with) her gate(keeper), Rashap [Mars?]". It was first linked by Sawyer & Stephenson (1970) to the solar eclipse of 3 May 1375 BC on the assumption that it had been total as viewed from Ugarit. A later analysis by de Jong & van Soldt (1987/89) re-dated the report to 5 March 1223 BC. More recently, the text has been linked to the solar eclipses of 21 January 1192 BC and 9 May 1012 BC. Other scholars question whether the solar eclipse was total or whether the tablet actually refers to an eclipse at all.
Appendix 4: The Discovery of Babylonian Use of Geometry With the Planetary Theory for Jupiter
"Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph." by Mathieu Ossendrijver (sciencemag.org, 29 January 2016, Volume 351, Issue 6272, Pages 482-484). Abstract: "The idea of computing a body's displacement as an area in time-velocity space is usually traced back to 14thcentury Europe. I show that in four ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, Jupiter's displacement along the ecliptic is computed as the area of a trapezoidal figure obtained by drawing its daily displacement against time. This interpretation is prompted by a newly discovered tablet on which the same computation is presented in an equivalent arithmetical formulation. The tablets date from 350 to 50 BCE. The trapezoid procedures offer the first evidence for the use of geometrical methods in Babylonian mathematical astronomy, which was thus far viewed as operating exclusively with arithmetical concepts." Acknowledgments: ".... The tablets are accessible in the Middle Eastern Department of the British Museum under the registration numbers BM 40054 (text A), BM 36801, BM 41043, BM 34757 (text B), BM 34081+34622+34846+42816+45851+46135 (text C), BM 35915 (text D), and BM 82824+99697+99742 (text E). H. Hunger (Vienna) is acknowledged for providing an unpublished photograph of BM 40054."
At the time of publication Mathieu Ossendrijver is Professor of History of Ancient Science at the HumboldtUniversität zu Berlin. His main interests are Babylonian astronomy and mathematics between 750 BC and 100 AD, in particular Babylonian mathematical astronomy, transformations of science and contextual aspects of Babylonian science during this period. Mathieu Ossendrijver is working on a new edition and analysis of all cuneiform tablets with mathematical astronomy (procedure texts and tabular texts). A monograph with new editions of the procedure texts and a semantic, mathematical and astronomical analysis of these texts appeared in 2012. A 2nd volume devoted to the tabular texts of this corpus is under preparation.
Ossendrijver translated several Babylonian cuneiform tablets from 350 BCE to 50 BCE and found that they contain a sophisticated calculation of the position of Jupiter. (Mathieu Ossendrijver spent 13 years deciphering the 4 tablets.) Ossendrijver knew that 4 of the tablets described such calculations, and probably were connected with astronomy. But he unsure until he found and translated a 5th tablet in 2014, after receiving an old photograph of it from a colleague. That tablet contained a set of instructions for calculating Jupiter's movement using geometric principles - exactly the procedures laid out in the other 4 tablets. The new evidence reveals that Babylonian astronomers in the several centuries BCE, apart from complex arithmetical methods, also employed sophisticated geometric methods that used a forerunner of calculus to do it: They calculated the area under a curve - a basic operation in calculus - in a graph of Jupiter's velocity versus time. The method (which anticipates integral calculus) relies on determining the area of a trapezium under a graph. This technique was previously thought to have been invented at least 1400 years later in 14th-century Oxford. In the 1950s Otto Neugebauer, described 2

tablets from the later Babylonian period, that appeared to describe some trapezoid calculations related to astronomical observations. However, it was not clear what the Babylonian astronomers were calculating.
Ossendrijver was alerted to the existence of several other unexamined ACT tablets in the British Museum when shown photographs by a visiting scholar.
One photograph of a tablet did not mention trapezoids, but it recorded the motion of Jupiter, with the numbers matching those on the tablets with the trapezoid calculations. It was a figure that described a graph of velocity against time. This preliminary analysis made Ossendrijver certain that it was a planetary theory for Jupiter. Ossendrijver, in his research at the British Museum in September 2015, turned up 2 more tablets. The discovery was made on his re-examination of known clay tablets. Mathematical calculations on 4 other tablets show that the Babylonians realized that the area under the curve of a graph of velocity against time represented distance travelled.
Space.com (28 January 2016): When Ossendrijver first encountered the Babylonian tablets, he didn't understand why calculations on a trapezoid were included along with tables related to Jupiter's position, he said. Only after he saw a fifth, uncataloged tablet, which showed a different procedure for finding Jupiter's position using the same examples as the trapezoids, did he realize the connection between the figure and the tables, Ossendrijver said. Eventually, he understood a second trapezoid calculation on the tablets, too: dividing it into two trapezoids with equal area, which would correspond to finding when Jupiter had traveled half the distance, he said. The advanced technique has been found only on the four tablets so far, which all use slightly different wording but the same example, he said. There isn't any evidence yet of the process being more widespread, Ossendrijver said. "This would open up new ways of computing motion they could have applied to other planets, other parts of Jupiter's motion," Ossendrijver said. "We don't have [examples of that]. We only have these four tablets, and they all deal with Jupiter — and they all deal with the same segment of 60 days. That's quite strange."
Mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period circa 1800 BCE to 1600 BCE knew how to calculate the area of a trapezoid, and how to divide a trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids of equal area. When Jupiter first appears in the northern night sky, it moves at a certain velocity relative to the background stars. Because Jupiter and Earth both constantly move in their orbits, to observers on Earth, Jupiter appears to slow down, and 120 days after it becomes visible, it comes to a standstill and reverses course. The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter travelled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance.
It was an abstract concept that was not known elsewhere at this period. Ancient Greek astronomers and mathematicians did not make plots of something against time. Until Ossendrijver's discovery this type of planetary theory calculation was not known until the 14th-century CE by scholars in England and France. It is conjecture whether the mathematicians of the Middle Ages had seen some as yet unknown texts containing Babylonian techniques, or if they developed the same techniques independently.
Ossendrijver has not posited any astronomical or astrological motivation for these calculations.
Nature News (28 January 2016): "Although the Babylonians never used graphs or geometric figures explicitly, it seems that they had already grasped the same method centuries earlier, Ossendrijver says. In this, they were even more sophisticated than the ancient Greeks, who used aspects of geometry in astronomy — they conceived of planets travelling in orbits — but didn't use the kinds of abstract constructions described by the tablets, which connect velocity, time and distance. Hermann Hunger, a specialist on Babylonian astronomy at the University of Vienna, says that the work marks a new discovery. However, he and Ossendrijver both point out that Babylonian mathematicians were well accustomed to geometry, so it is not entirely surprising that astronomers might have grasped the same points. "These findings do not so much show a higher degree of sophistication in geometric thinking, but rather a remarkable ability to apply traditional Babylonian geometric thinking to a new problem", Hunger says. Science historian Jens Hųyrup at Roskilde University in Denmark says, however, that this might not be the first hint of geometric ideas in Babylonian astronomy. The thinking behind the forecasting of certain lunar configurations, he says, "also shows kind of geometric combination of phenomena at the setting and rising positions of the Moon"."
physicsworld.com (January 28, 2016): "Not everyone is entirely convinced, however. The physicist and historian James Evans, at the University of Puget Sound in the US, says that it is "far from clear that the Babylonian scribes would have seen it that way," noting that there is an absence of any graphs on the tablets, unlike other mathematical tablets showing the geometrical measurement of land. "So while I don't think it is reasonable to see

the Babylonian scribes as anticipating the graphical methods described by [European scholar] Nicole Oresme in the 14th century, it does seem fair to say they had an instinctual grasp of the mean-speed theorem. That’s new and very interesting." The tablets are all damaged in some way, so perhaps the sections containing the graphs had broken off, suggests Ossendrijver. Alternatively, perhaps there are tablets yet to be discovered that feature the graphs. Equally puzzling is why the trapezoid method seems to be limited to only a handful of tablets describing Jupiter, and why the knowledge was subsequently lost before being reinvented in Medieval Europe. Ossendrijver suggests one possibility is that it could have been "invented by a very clever astronomer, but wasn’t then taken up or understood by others""

F : Bronze Age European Constellations
12: The Nebra sky disk enigma
Picture shows the original condition of the controversial Nebra Sky Disk prior to extensive restoration work being carried out on it. The disk weighs 2 kilograms, is 32 centimetres in diameter, and is made of bronze and gold (bronze and gold-emblazoned). The disk shows the night sky but apparently in a symbolic manner and almost without concrete constellations. A number of astronomers/archaeoastronomers believe that the disk is the earliest representation of the night sky with concrete astronomical content. The several complementary objects found with (or near) the disk enable dating to the Early Bronze Age. An early interpretation of the German disk was that it indicates the position of the Pleiades (= the cluster of 7 dots per the usual denotation of the Pleiades in Near East Cultures) at the vernal Equinox circa 1600 BCE.

The authenticity of the "Sky Disk of Nebra" or "Nebra Sky Disk" has been the subject of considerable debate. When the existence of the disk became generally known in 2002 there were initial suspicions that it might likely be an archaeological forgery. However, it is now generally accepted that the disk is authentic. If this is correct then it is one of the oldest known depictions of the sky. (Metallurgical studies support the authenticity of the disk.)
The story of how the disk came to light runs as follows: It was discovered and excavated (i.e., looted) by 2 (previously convicted) treasure hunters (or a group) (using a metal detector (or detectors)) during an illegal dig in 1999. The disk was part of a cache of bronze goods buried within a pit inside a Bronze Age ring-wall at the site of a bronze age camp. (The reasons for it being buried are unknown and likely will remain undiscoverable.) The exact location was eventually established as the top of Mittelberg ("central hill"), in the Ziegelroda Forest, near the town of Nebra in the state of Saxony-Anhalt in central/east Germany. The Nebra Sky disk was nearly lost to the black market. The disk appeared on the illegal antiquities/art market in 2001 with its seller claiming it had been looted illegally. It was sold twice on the illegal antiquities/art market before finally being confiscated by the Swiss police in 2003 (in a "sting" operation at the Hilton Hotel in Basle, Switzerland) from a third group of owners attempting to sell it. These were two amateur archaeologists who were trying to sell the disc for US $400,000. Eventually, in order to escape prosecution, all parties involved in the illegal handling of the disk agreed to assist the authorities.
Professional excavations of the site were begun on August 20, 2005. It has been established that the disk and other objects had been deposited between stones. The local archaeologists involved in the excavations have identified a circular wall approximately 200 metres in diameter, surrounded by a complex system of trenches.
The disk is dated to circa 1600 BCE through several of the artifacts found with it (or at least in close proximity). The cache of bronze age goods taken from the pit by the group of treasure hunters were principally weapons. The cache consisted of 2 bronze swords with gold decorated hilts, 2 bronze flanged axe heads (hatchets), a bronze chisel (or dagger?), and fragments of 2 bronze arm spirals (i.e., bracelets). The 2 bronze swords were typologically dated to the mid 2nd-millennium BCE. Also, a birch bark particle that was found on one of the bronze swords returned a radiocarbon dating of between 1,600 and 1,560 BCE. The date of circa 1,600 BCE was the end of the central European Early Bronze Age.
Note: From more recent work it is estimated it was buried at the end of the 17th-century BCE - the period of the transition of the early Bronze Age to the middle Bronze Age. It is believed that at the time of burial the disk had long been in use. The actual date of its production cannot be determined with certainty.
The bronze disk is 32 cm diameter and weighs 2 kg. The disc almost certainly shows the night sky. On the face of the disk there are a number of images comprised of gold leaf embossed on it (forming a diagram of the night sky?). The 32 small gold circles distributed over the disc are believed to indicate stars but without concrete constellations except the structure of 7 closer stars, widely interpreted as the Plejades. The interpretation of the Pleiades for the 7 closer gold circles lies with the vicinity of this open star cluster to the ecliptic and the vernal point in the bronze age, and therefore its high calendrical significance. On opposite sides of the disk there are 2 large arcs. Both are located on the edge of the disk. Both arcs span about 80 degrees each. At another edge of the disk there is an arc that looks like a boat
The apparent astronomical details of the images have provided the basis for a multitude of different explanations. It is generally accepted that the disk is more than merely ornamental and has a practical astronomical significance. However, the dots (stars) may have been largely decorative. Some 30 background dots (stars) are spread (in an apparently randomly fashion?) across the disk, with the exception of a tight cluster of 7 stars. Statistical analysis suggests that most of the stars appear to be arranged artistically with the aim of filling the empty spaces, more or less regularly, between the larger objects depicted (i.e., likely represent the general starry night sky). It is generally thought that the cluster of 7 stars could represent the Pleiades, or even the Præsepe, both open star clusters. The meaning of the other symbols is not yet clear. The full circle (central gold disk) and the crescent (gold crescent symbol) positioned between the 2 arcs might represent the sun (or full moon) and crescent moon. It has also been suggested by the German astronomer Burkard Steinrücken that the gold crescent symbol could be the partially eclipsed sun or moon. The identification of the 3 items (2 arcs (= eastern and western horizon sectors where the sun rises and sets during the year?) and what looks like a boat (= the Ship of the Sun?) placed at the edge of the disk are still disputed. (It has also been suggested that the short arc in-between the 2 larger ones may represent a particularly bright

section of the Milky Way.) It has been remarked that the only thing accurate on it is the pair of arcs - if the disk is held in a horizontal plane. The angle they cover matches the annual (apparent) swinging movement of the sun along the horizon between the 2 solstitial points, for the latitude at Saxony-Anhalt.
There are several theories that identify the disk as a precision tool for observing the sky. One of these is the proposal that the disk was used as a complex astronomical clock for the harmonisation of solar and lunar calendars. It was used to decide when to add an intercalary month (which was basically every 3 years).
A general description tends to be: The disk contains a graphical representation of the sun, moon, and the constellations Andromeda and Cassiopeia, among other celestial objects of agricultural and calendrical importance, including the Pleiades. According to astronomer Ralph Hansen the disk served to coordinate the solar and lunar cycles for agricultural purposes.
The German scholar Beate Staufenbiel believes the following constellations are recognisable (by means of simple comparison with the night sky): Great Bear, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Orion. Also, the stars Sirius, Vega, and Deneb.
There is evidence that the disk was reworked several times. It has been reasonably established that the present appearance of the disk involved 3 steps. (Other investigators consider it is evident that the production of the disk occurred in 5 stages.) At least 3 dots (stars) were (re)moved when the 2 arcs (eastern and western horizon sectors?) were placed on the disk. X-rays indicate that there are 2 more stars under the gold of one of the arcs. This makes it likely that the 2 arcs were added some time after the other features were placed. Additionally, the other ("lower") arc (boat?) does not appear to fit the aesthetic concept of the disk design. This is because the distance between 2 of the dots (stars?) and the arc looking like a boat is considerably smaller than with any of the other large gold objects on the disk. The rim of the disk has also been roughly punched at some later time.
The disk was perhaps used for religious and agricultural purposes at the time of the autumn equinox. The disk may depict the beginning and end of the planting and harvest seasons (as determined by the sun, the moon, and the Pleiades star grouping. It has been speculated that it was perhaps one of a pair. The other disk being designed for use at the time of the spring equinox. Another theory holds that it was used to determine when an intercalary month (a 13th month) was to be inserted into the calendar to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons (i.e., to keep the solar and lunar years harmonised).
The use of the disk remains unknown. There remains the possibility that the Nebra disk is simply a cult object (or became a cult object). The face of the Nebra Sky Disk is claimed to be one of the earliest astronomical representations of the night sky. It is pointed out that only in the burial chamber in the pyramid of Pharaoh Unas (at Saqqara), the last Pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty, circa 2,300 BCE, that an earlier astronomical impression of the night sky has been found (on some ceilings). However, these are simply an artist's invention and not an accurate depiction of the night sky. The ceilings of the corridors, the antechamber and the burial chamber in the Pyramid of Unas have decorative arrays of yellow stars on a blue background.

Appendix 1: Bronze Age Cone Shaped Gold Hats



2022. 02. 21. 19:55 History of Constellation and Star Names

Two sets of photographs of the 4 Bronze Age gold cones recovered to date.
The 4 gold cones are rare archaeological finds dating back to the Bronze Age, which lasted from 3300-700 BCE. The cones all appear to have been made sometime around the middle of this period or later, ranging from 1400-800 BCE. They were each discovered separately, over the course of 160 years, in different geographic locations. There is a possibility that more gold cones will be uncovered in the future.
To date 4 Bronze Age gold pointed "wizard hats," representing a high level of technical achievement, have been found in Central Europe (1 in Switzerland dated circa 1,300 BCE; 2 in southern Germany; and 1 in west France). (According to one source 3 of them were found in Germany and 1 was found in France.) They are very rare archaeological objects. The 4 gold hats presently known are:
(1) The Golden Hat of Schifferstadt, found in 1835 at Schifferstadt near Speyer, dated circa 1400-1300 BCE. The first cone was discovered in 1835 at Schifferstadt, Germany and is called the Golden Hat of Schifferstadt. It was uncovered by a farmer, and appeared to have been intentionally buried. It is the shortest of the 4 cones, standing at 29.6 cm high. It is divided into bands that run the full length of the cone, with each band decorated with one of several designs including circles, disc shapes, and eye-like shapes. It is believed to have been manufactured sometime between 1400-1300 BCE.
(2) The Avanton Gold Cone, incomplete, found at Avanton near Poitiers in 1844, dated circa 1000-900 BCE. The 2nd cone discovered is the Avanton Gold Cone, discovered in Avanton, France in 1844. It is believed to

have been manufactured between 1000-900 BCE, and is the only one missing a brim. However, signs of damage indicate that it did have a brim at one time. The cone stands at 55 cm. It is also banded, with repeated circle symbols.
(3) The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch, found near Ezelsdorf near Nuremberg in 1953, dated circa 1000900 BCE; the tallest known specimen at circa 90 centimetres. The 3rd cone discovered is the Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch, discovered near Ezelsdorf, Germany in 1953. It stands as the tallest of the 4 cones, at 88 cm tall, and contains the same banded design with repeated circles, discs, and eye-like shapes. It is believed to have originated between 1000-900 BCE.
(4) The Berlin Gold Hat, likely found in Swabia or Switzerland, dated circa 1000-800 BCE; acquired by the Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte, Berlin, in 1996. The provenance of the 4th gold cone is unclear but is believed to have been found in either southern Germany or Switzerland - it was noticed in the international arts trade in 1995. The cone originates from 1000-800 BCE, and is known as the Berlin Gold Hat because it was purchased by the Berlin Museum. It stands at 75 cm tall, with the same banded pattern as the others.
Although discovered in different locations and at different times, the 4 gold cones share many similarities in size, shape, design, and construction. Their conical design mimics the popular image of a witch’s or wizard’s hat. The purpose of the gold cones is unknown. Whilst they were each found in different geographic areas, speculations have developed around the cones as a group, the assumption being that they were all used for similar purposes. However, while the 4 cones bear striking similarities, they are also somewhat unique in their specific features. The gold artifacts are constructed of sheets of gold, with intricate designs (believed by some to be astronomical) and demonstrate superb craftsmanship. All were produced (hammered) from one piece of sheet gold and testify to the high skill level of Bronze Age craftsmen.
The Golden Hat from Schifferstadt was found in an upright position in the ground. The 3 bronze axes found with the hat enabled the find to be dated to the 14th- or early 13th-century BCE. The hat is 29.6 cm high, weighs 350 grams, and its wall thickness varies between 0.1 and 0.25 cm.
Professor Sabine Gerloff, a German archaeologist at Erlangen University, has found evidence that 5 similar gold hats (cones) were unearthed by peat diggers in Ireland during the 17th and 18th centuries. Unfortunately, all of them were melted down.
The hats are associated with the pre-Proto-Celtic Bronze Age Urnfield culture. Their use as head-gear is strongly supported by the fact that three of the four objects have a cap-like widening at the bottom of the cone, and that their openings are oval (not round), with diameters and shapes roughly equivalent to those of a human skull. It is assumed that the gold cones served as religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun cult then widespread in Central Europe. The figural depiction of an object resembling a conical hat on a stone slab of the King's Grave at Kivik, Southern Sweden, strongly supports the association of the gold cones with religion and cult.
In 2001, May 17 - 20, a colloquium "Goldenes Sakralgerät der Bronzezeit" ("Golden sacral equipment of the Bronze Age") was organised by the "Germanisches Nationalmuseum," and the papers presented were published in 2003 in the "Anzeiger des Germanischen Nationalmuseums." A critique of the thesis of Menghin was contained in these published papers. However, 2 years later an exhibition "Gold und Kult der Bronzezeit" with the Golden Hats as the central focus was organised by the "Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nürnberg, 22. Mai bis 7. September 2003." In the catalogue and in the exhibition, and therefore also in the public view, only the thesis of Wilfried Menghin was presented ("Goldene Kalenderhüte - Manifestationen bronzezeitlicher Kalenderwerke" ("Golden Calendar Hats - manifestations of Bronze Age calendar works"), Pages 220-237), claiming identification of "calender calculator", "Metonic cycle" etc.
In his article "Von Hüten, Kegeln und Kalendern oder das blendende Licht des Orient" (Pages 27-34, "From hats, cones and calendars or the blinding light of the Orient") Mark Schmidt writes (rough draft translation): "lnspired by the work of Jens May and Reiner Lumpe, Wilfried Menghin recently suggested the gold plate cone "hats" can be interpreted as calendars. This interpretation is quite complex, however, and subject to a number of methodological problems. Firstly, these have to do with the "merkmaltypisierender arguments" ("number rhythm" or the "counts" of the 4 investigated gold cones). Menghin wants to identify differently, each equally self-contained, cone sections containing ornamentation. It needs to be stated that there are divergences between the respective absolute number of zones a certain range and that assigned by Menghin

with his "counting" analysis, which is based on the use of the so-called "switching and special zones." Looking at the respective treatment of the "switching and special zones" in determining the counts of the Berlin cone the arbitrariness in the analysis method cannot be overlooked. The areas in question are only optionally included in the count. This procedure is continued in the other analysis of the other gold cones."
The cones are made of thin gold leaf and all are covered with sun and moon symbols (1735 on 1 hat; 1737 and 1739 on 2 of the others). The Berlin gold cone is 88 centimetres high and is dated to the late Bronze period circa 1000-800 BCE. The Berlin gold cone is the only one that is fully preserved. According to Wilfried Menghin (Director of the Berlin Museum) the symbols form a code corresponding almost exactly to the Metonic cycle. The symbols and their number are a day/month Metonic cycle code. (See his journal article: "Der Berliner Goldhut und die goldenen Kalendarien der alteuropäischen Bronzezeit." Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica, Volume 32, 2000, Pages 31-108.) Supporters of this viewpoint suggest that Bronze Age "wizards" would have been able to make long-term empirical astronomical observations. According to Wilfried Menghin the 1,739 sun and half-moon symbols decorating the Berlin cone's surface comprise a scientific code - explaining the relationship between moon and sun years - which corresponds almost exactly to the Metonic cycle discovered by the Greek astronomer Meton in 432 BCE. This date is circa 500 years after the Berlin cone was made. According to Wilfried Menghin: "The symbols on the hat are a logarithmic table which enables the movements of the sun and moon to be calculated in advance."
However, according to Andreas Fuls (Technische Universität Berlin, Institut für Geodäsie und Geoinformationstechnik): "The interpretation of astronomical and calendrical symbols is often criticized as incidentally (sic) [= incidental]. The fortuity depends on the number of possible combinations as well as the exepted (sic) [= excepted] [= not including, but mistake for accepted?] tolerance of the astronomical period. In this paper, the astronomical interpretation of iconographic symbols on golden hats from the Bronze Age will be analysed to check its statistical significance. The four golden hats (Schifferstadt, Avanton, Ezelsdorf, and Berlin) have 10 to 20 zones with a different number of symbols. The number of circles of each symbol and the number of symbols from one or more zones are multiplied in a first step. The total amount is interpreted as a number of days. In a second step the number of days is compared to mean astronomical cycles like the synodic month or the tropical year (Menghin 2000, Fuls 2004), but the results are often criticized as incidentally [= incidental]. Do the circular symbols on the golden hats represent sophisticated astronomical knowledge during the Bronze Age? Or is it just artistic decoration? ("Astronomic-statistical Analysis of Circular Symbols on Golden Hats (Bronze Age)." Astronomische Nachrichten, Band 328, 2007, Number 7, Page 1.)" See also: Fuls, Andreas. (2004): "Archäoastronomische Anmerkungen zu bronzezeitlichen Goldhüten und ostfriesischen Kultbauten." In: Huber, Florian and Rottländer, Rolf. (Editors). ORDO ET MENSURA VIII, Scripta Mercaturae Verlag, St. Katharinen (2004), Pages 39–57.
With any small and unusual group of finds, such as the Bronze Age gold foil cones, it is inevitable that even the most intense efforts to find a functional and "ideological" interpretation will not be successful. In such cases it would seem a good idea a good idea to give an indefinite conclusion in preference to a too speculative interpretation.
Interestingly, at her Blogsite, Christine Sterne makes the observation (2011) that the gold hats are exactly the same shape as the straw hats worn by the women of Yemen.
The gold hats, or more specifically, the sun cult they appear to have been an expression of, are also believed to be connected with a number of other prominent works of Bronze Age or early Iron Age art. These include the Nebra Sky Disk, which pre-dates the gold cones but possibly implies similarly advanced astronomical knowledge; the Mold cape (dated circa 2000 BCE), one of the finest examples of prehistoric sheet-gold working, and likely to have been worn by a priest or similar special individual; the Trundholm Sun Chariot, a clear representation of sun-related beliefs, a variety of Scandinavian petroglyphs; and assemblages like the Bernstorf Gold Hoard, with golden elements originally attached to clothing; or the Eberswalde Treasure, which features similar decorative motifs to those on the hats. It is thought the widespread distribution of the Sun Cross and similar motifs in Bronze Age Central and Northern Europe may also be connected.
The symbols on the gold caps are also found on weapons such as swords and helmets. The most recent interpretation is they are a ceremonial hat or crown. It is generally assumed that the west European gold hats are based upon prototypes in the eastern Mediterranean. A possible concept behind the gold caps is they were the crown of a deity, as were gold caps in the Hittite Empire.

Appendix 2: The claim for early constellation patterns in the ground at Magdeleneberg, Germany
The 1990s work of the Dutch archaeologist Linda Therkorn (University of Amsterdam), and also the 2011 analysis by the German researcher Allard Mees (Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum) has led to some remarkable claims.
The Press Release, 11th October 2011, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum states (in part): "The order of the burials around the central royal tomb fits exactly with the sky constellations of the Northern hemisphere. The position of the burials at Magdeleneberg represents a constellation pattern which can be seen between Midwinter and Midsummer. ... With the help of special computer programs, Dr. Allard Mees, researcher at the Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum, could reconstruct the position of the sky constellations in the early Celtic period and following from that those which were visible at Midsummer. This archaeo-astronomic research resulted in a date of Midsummer 618 BC, which makes it the earliest and most complete example of a Celtic calendar focused on the moon." The broad claim is the constellation pattern identified from the order of the burials around the central tomb is dated to the 7th-century BCE.
The key claims are: (1) the star groupings/constellation patterns can be identified from the order of the burials around the central tomb, (2) they comprise a Northern sky constellation set, and (3) the matching of the 'star' grouping patterns of the constellations on the ground with the positions of the star groups in the sky forming constellations gives a date in the 7th century BCE. The constellations claimed to be identified identified comprise a Greek set: Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Delphinus, Cygnus, Sagitta, Lyra, Hercules, Corona Borealis, Boötes, Coma Berenices, and Snake-Head. Okay, the early Celts knew the Greeks. However, the existence of Coma Berenices dates to the Hellenistic period circa 3rd century BCE.
An apparent assumption indicated is the acceptance of a generic set of Northern sky constellations/patterns (or generic set of Northern sky star groupings) as illustrated by the Greek constellation set familiar to us. Also, an apparent assumption is the dot and line indulged in justifies the Greek constellation pattern set. No proof of a Celtic constellation set is given. The decision to connect tombs = 'stars' in dot and line manner to suggest Greek constellation patterns is not discussed in the Press Release.
A number of key problems exist. The existence of Coma Berenices dates to the Hellenistic period circa 3rd century BCE. (The constellation Coma Berenices refers to a classical story concerning the hair of Berenice, the wife and queen of Ptolemy III of Egypt during the 3rd century BCE. It was named and introduced into the Greek constellation set by the astronomer Conon circa 245 BCE. It was previously an asterism belonging to the constellation Leo. Coma Berenices was not one of the 48 constellations listed in Ptolemy's star catalogue (which standardised the Western constellation scheme).) Perhaps the assumption is that the early Celts had star groupings similar to those of the Greeks. In the Celtic Ursa Major there are 25 tombs = 'stars.' The Greeks listed between 22 and 27 stars forming Ursa Major. However, there is no reason to believe this

was the case in Greek uranography circa the 7th-century BCE. For 'Homer,' Ursa Major consisted of 7 bright stars only. 'Homer' is usually dated to the 8th-century BCE but has also (somewhat controversially) been dated to the 7th-century BCE. A number of things do appear to be somewhat odd. It appears they have chosen to use a late Greek constellation/pattern set as the Northern constellations of an earlier date.
Extending to ancient Germanic tribes; apart from some scattered references of later writers we have no record of the indigenous constellation/star names of the ancient Germanic tribes.
Appendix 3: The claim for early constellation patterns in the ground at Muggenburg, The Netherlands
The method of pattern matching/comparison between earth and sky was a feature of the work of Linda Therkorm in the 1990s. She is an archaeologist who is still at the Amsterdam Archaeological Center, University of Amsterdam. (2012: Senior Researcher, University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Humanities, Archaeology.) Her (burial) pit-zodiac theory (first publicly set out in "Stars fell on Muggenburg" by Govert Schilling (New Scientist, December 16, 1995, Number 2008, Pages 32-34)) makes the claim for the possible early knowledge of the Classical zodiacal constellations (and others) being recognized in 'The Netherlands' circa 300 CE (and also perhaps circa 500 BCE!). At the date of this article Linda Therkorn claimed recognition of Taurus, Canis Major, Pegasus, and Hercules at Muggenburg circa 4th-century CE, and Taurus and Pegasus at Velserbroek circa 6th-century BCE. (She has since investigated the possible cosmic significance of other Dutch landscapes.) Her 2004 PhD thesis (University of Amsterdam) in which she fully discusses her idea is titled: Landscaping the Powers of Darkness and Light: 600 BC-350 AD settlement concerns of Noord-Holland in wider perspective.
The comparative method(s) of identifying star groupings/constellations from the nature and/or order of burials (pits or tombs) has the advantage(s) of possibility of obtaining new insights not forming part of recorded historical material. However, it has the disadvantage(s) of being subjective. Further problems include: (1) the assumption that the dot and line pattern indulged in justifies the Greek constellation pattern set for comparison purposes, (2) the acceptance of a generic set of Northern sky constellations/patterns (or generic set of Northern sky star groupings) as illustrated by the Greek constellation set, and (3) the use of a late Greek constellation/pattern set as the Northern constellations of an earlier date.
Appendix 4: A Bronze-Age Armenian solar system?: The creation of pseudo-history
An Armenian bronze artifact is often being claimed as a Bronze Age geocentric model of the solar system. (The terms 'considered' and 'interpreted' are also variously used.) This claim is apparently only made on popular web sites rather than in professional journals/publications. However, the names of several professional persons are mentioned as supporting the claim. (As example see http://www.armeniapast.com/prehistory/bronze-age/ This is a web page by Andrew Selkirk, the Editor-inChief of the British magazines Current Archaeology and Current World Archaeology. He states: "I originally studied Classics ("Greats") at Oxford where I was President of the Oxford University Archaeology Society.") The information and photographs on the web page are based on a visit that Andrew Selkirk made to Armenia in June 2013. In the About (Visiting Armenia) page Andrew Selkirk writes: "My main source of information has been a guide to the Archaeological Heritage of Armenia, edited by Hakob Simonyan for the Borsa and published in Yerevan in 2012. My thanks also go to the authors of the excellent Bradt Guide book to Armenia, by the late Nicholas Holding, and to his wife Deirdre who has taken on the task of updating the guide book. I have cribbed from it in a number of places! The two most useful books on Armenian archaeology are both somewhat out-of-date – 'Urartu' by Boris Piotrovsky the excavator of Karmir Bur, and subsequently Director of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, who provides an an excellent account, even though it was published in 1969. 'The Peoples of the Hills' by Charles Burney and David Marshall Lang was published in 1971 and gives a rather academic survey of the archaeology." Andrew Selkirk's caption "This masterpiece of bronze workmanship is often considered to be a model of the solar system. It is one of the treasures of the National Museum in Yerevan." Why exactly it is considered to be a masterpiece of bronze (bronze age?) workmanship is not explained.
Note 1: In astronomy, the term "geocentric system" is usually used to designate a geometric and specifically ordered plan of the "spheres" of the planets and stars. The Armenian object does not depict such a system.
Note 2: There is also a claim for later Iron Age depictions of the solar system, from around Lake Sevan, being on display in the History Museum (National Museum) in Yerevan.

In October 2015 Ed Krupp saw the object in the National Museum in Yerevan, Armenia. He remarked (Hastro-L, March 2016) that he was surprised to encounter it. Ed Krupp further remarked that the astronomical interpretation in the object's caption at the museum is minimal and neither persuasive nor detailed. The museum catalogue gives the object height as 24.8 centimetres. There is no readily obvious way of being certain that it is as old as claimed or that it was found where claimed (according to some sources). Whatever its function the appears as a model of the solar system implying geocentricity. The exhibition includes a 'temple adornment' showing a similar depiction of the 'earth' but with three rings. It's not clear how it would be used, there is nothing for attaching it to clothing. The museum catalogue states that that "such a representation of the geocentric system is also found in medieval Armenian manuscripts." Ed Krupp also commented that he had not encountered any critical commentary on this object, and that it would be interesting to know if the same emblem appears in later manuscripts, as claimed.
One source indicates the location of the relevant medieval manuscripts as Yerevan. (No other details are given but these document date for circa 5th/7th century CE.) The situation regarding referencing/accessible referencing is ridiculous and the status of the claims is indicated as pseudo-history. The pattern is for Armenian authors to simply repeat early claims and give usually inaccessible references. Any modern discussion is avoided.
Regarding the claim for medieval Armenian manuscripts. No information is given where to find these particular examples. It's a bit like the historical dictionary that for the entry Noah stated See Flood and for the entry Flood stated See Ark and for the entry Ark stated See Noah. If professional Armenian historians can't present clear information on the issue then likely there is nothing but a historical hoax. It is now some 70 years since the supposed discovery of the object yet almost no information about is discoverable. However, the original source for the ancient manuscripts claim is apparently Benik Toumanyan. Others simply seem to repeat the claim. The location of the "ancient manuscripts" seems to be the Matenadaran (Museum of Ancient Armenian Art and Manuscripts). Note: The Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts, commonly referred to as the Matenadaran, is a repository of ancient manuscripts, research institute and museum in Yerevan. The Matenadaran Museum contains chiefly Armenian manuscripts dating from Late Antiquity through the Early Modern Era.
Some important observations by Ed Krupp include the design of the object does not suggest geocentric ordering of the sun, moon, and five naked-eye planets. Although Ed Krupp was skeptical of the museum guide's claim for a bronze-age geocentric model of the solar system in the museum, when he saw the object, he thought it was possible the symbols on stems could represent the sun, moon, and five naked-eye planets with an earth emblem at the bottom. This is not the same thing as a representation of a geocentric system. Also, although recognition of the 7 'wanderers' in the 12th-11th centuries BCE is possible, there is no explicit confirming evidence for that particular claim. It is Ed Krupp's belief that any interpretation of the object is highly speculative and unlikely to be confirmed. It is difficult to disagree with this judgment. Also noted by Ed Krupp: The object is relatively large and heavy and does not seem to be well adapted to practical use.
Attempting to obtain accurate information concerning the discovery, dating, and interpretation of the artifact has proven to be difficult. There is a lack of English-language information. (This does not necessarily mean that there is wealth of Armenian-language information. However, it is obvious that most of the key discussions remain in the Armenian language.) What English-language information does exist is somewhat contradictory. The origin of the rather fantastic claims for the artifact - in the apparent absence of suitable standards of proof - is likely persons connected with the History Museum of Armenia, Yerevan (= National Museum in Yerevan). The Yerevan State University was established in 1919 and my understanding is it has a very good reputation. Leaving aside interpretation for the moment .... Unless there is suitable evidence that can establish a bronze age date for the artifact then why believe the claim for that date? It would be interesting to know how long the artifact has been on display with the particular astronomical interpretation. It has been there prior to 2007. An image of the artifact is also depicted on a stained glass window in the museum. Stephen Scourfield writing a tourist article in The West Australian for July 27, 2013: "There is a model of the solar system, in bronze, from perhaps the 12th century BC showing, significantly, the Earth as round."

Among the artifacts on display in the Historical Museum of Armenia is a bronze object found, according to one source, in 2015 (this late date obviously one of many errors that are encountered) after the water level of Lake Sevan lowered. The artificial draining of Lake Sevan was started in the Joseph Stalin era and resulted in the water level falling about 20 metres. (One source simply states it was recovered from the Lake Sevan region.) It is frequently described as having "pride of place" as an exhibit (one of the treasures of the National Museum in Yerevan) and being the symbol of the museum. It is claimed by Armenian experts that its manufacture dates to the 2nd-millennium BCE and it is a complex model of the solar system. There are no convincing reasons why these assertions by some Armenian academics are to be be readily accepted. Indeed information related to it is somewhat contradictory.
It is claimed that the artifact is mentioned in ancient (Armenian) manuscripts. What this apparently actually means is that it is depicted - or at least the symbols are - in early medieval Armenian manuscripts. Interpretation per the orientation shown in the photograph: In the centre of the lower part is the planet Earth, depicted as a semicircular battle-axe blade with a cruciform base. It is surrounded by 2 rings, marking the layers of water and atmosphere. The comparatively larger 'radiant' disk in the upper part symbolises the Sun. There are 5 planets symbolised: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and also the Moon. It is also stated that it is claimed to be evidence that the ancient Armenians considered the Earth was round something also claimed to be confirmed in ancient Armenian manuscripts. One of the issues is how far back the Armenians date. The Armenians, an Indo-European people, first appear in history shortly after the end of the 7th-century BCE. The oldest known ancestors of modern Armenians, the Hayasa-Azzi tribes, also known as Proto-Armenians, were indigenous to the Armenian Highland in Eastern Anatolia.

Bronze artifact claimed to be a Bronze-Age geocentric model of the solar system. (Somewhat strangely it appears to be one of a kind; sui generis.) It is generally described in Armenian sources as a Chased Bronze Plate with a Symbolic Model of Geocentric Solar System, 12th-11th centuries BCE. (Chasing is used to refine the design on the front of the work by working from the front to sink the metal.) However, http://www.armeniapast.com/prehistory/bronze-age/ states "It is a casual find from an unknown source, but is generally considered to be Bronze Age." (This statement may not be correct. Information though remains contradictory.) How and exactly where it was found may likely never be explained. It is generally identified as being recovered from the Sevan Basin. The interpretation of the object is based mostly on depictions of astronomical symbols in Armenian astronomical literature. (Apparently a late astrological significance is not considered. Neither apparently has the question "Is it a fake?" been asked.) In the orientation of the object shown the lower end of the object is identified as the symbol of planet Earth. (But why view it with the circle at the bottom and not at the side or the top? According to the English language catalogue available at the Moscow exhibition: "The circles in the lower part of the model symbolize the Earth, surrounded with atmosphere and water. The radiant Sun crowns the model. Representations of planets visible from Earth were arranged on a rod between them.") The 2 surrounding rings are interpreted to depict layers of water and atmosphere. The upper end of the object is identified as the symbol of the Sun. In the centre between the Sun and the Earth are identified the symbols of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the symbol of the Moon. It is also stated that it is claimed to be evidence that the ancient Armenians considered the Earth was round - something also claimed to be confirmed in ancient Armenian manuscripts. Apparently there have been no attempts by Armenian academics proposing an ancient astronomical explanation to explain what purpose it was used for and how it 'worked.' Note: In astronomy, the term "geocentric system" is usually used to designate a geometric and specifically ordered plan of the "spheres" of the planets and stars. The Armenian object does not depict such a system. Note: There is also a claim for later Iron Age solar systems from around Lake Sevan being on display in the History Museum (National Museum) in Yerevan. See: https://journals.worldnomads.com/krodin/story/137374/Armenia/Armenian-Impressions
For a bronze artifact to be claimed to be a Bronze-Age geocentric model of the solar system one would expect the evidence to be robust and have wide expert agreement. It is obvious that this is not the case with this particular object. In fact it is almost impossible to find any literature providing evidence for the discovery, dating, and interpretation of the artifact. Interestingly, there have been only a few critiques of the claims for this object - either from inside or from outside Armenia. In 2105 the object was on display in the National Museum in Yerevan, Armenia (at least in October 2015). Sometime later it was on display in Moscow until 13th June, 2016. Ed Krupp, who saw the object displayed in the museum in Yerevan, commented (Hastro-L, March 2016): "Astronomical interpretation in the object's caption at the museum is minimal and neither persuasive nor detailed. I have not encountered any critical commentary on this object, and it would be interesting to know if the same emblem appears in later manuscripts, as claimed." Nothing had changed when the object was on display in Moscow. The display catalogue described it as a Bronze-Age geocentric solar system model. Little other information was given. The English the title of the Moscow exhibition was 'Armenia, The Legend Of Being, Country Radiating All The Circles of History' (sic). It is claimed many of the advances in metallurgy took place in the 'Armenian Highland' and drove Indo-European expansion and so appears to correspond to the Armenian hypothesis of the Proto-Indo-European-Urheimat. (See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_hypothesis) It appears this hypothesis is relatively little known in the West. But whether the civilization of the 'Armenian Highland' is a possible significant link between those of Mesopotamia and ancient Greece, for the history and prehistory of astronomy, is unknown. It is known that the Caucasus region was greatly influenced by Greek culture.
Part of the issue is not what the catalogue states (which does not comprise direct evidence) but exactly who is claiming: (1) the dating and why, and (2) the interpretation and why. Lots of "interesting" (exaggerated) astronomical and historical claims have been originating out of Armenia for decades. If you want to put a lot of weight with speculation (extrapolation from what you believe is credibly established or what you believe is likely to have been known) then it's hard to identify a stopping point. If you want to put a lot of weight with evidence then at present we don't seem to have a starting point with this artifact. Speculation does not qualify as evidence. The lack of evidence does not mean the claim is not true. The lack of evidence being presented for the claim means there is no basis for any meaningful discussion of the claim. Speculation needs to be identified as speculation. This does not mean that it equals dismissal. It also does not mean that all sorts of speculative theories are credible and have legitimacy. That would be mistaking what is logically possible for what is historically possible and reasonable given what sources we have to work with. Also, a disturbing trend would be accepting speculation without the requisite of evidence. Hopefully we are looking for claims

that are supportable and not wanting to build a house with a stone. As previously remarked, the paucity of information and evidence is fascinating for the claim that is being made.
Interestingly, there are 2 other artefacts shown with the controversial object, which show related features, and the Moscow exhibition catalogue contains discussion of solar symbolism and the wheel. Apparently the organisers of the Moscow exhibition (the aim of which is to promote Armenia) have not made the Englishlanguage catalogue available in electronic form.
Excursus: The object appeared on a postage stamp dated 1995, see: http://www.stampdata.com/stamps.php? format=catalog&fissuer=32&ffunction=postage&offset=200 It was on display in Moscow until 13th June 2016, see: http://www.shm.ru
Finding professional references for the claim that the object is a bronze age (geocentric) solar system model is difficult. When they are located there is a lack of suitable information for the claim. It has been suggested that Irakli Simonia, who is very familiar with historic Armenian astronomical references, would know more details about the object. But Ed Krupp (Hastro-L, March 2016) identifies the object is not mentioned in Irakli's papers, written in English, on ancient and historic astronomy in Armenia. Some details were published in "Armenian Astronomy in the Bronze Age." by Joseph Ouzounian (Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of the Center for Archaeoastronomy, Volume VII, Numbers 1-4, January-December, 1984, Pages 105-109). The article is interesting but somewhat speculative. (It is unfortunate that the editors of the journal in which this speculation first appeared did not ask the author relevant questions.) It appears the artifact was unearthed in 1946 near Lake Sevan (which is located 1900 metres above sea level). See specifically page 107 for a brief discussion and pages 10-12 of reference 9 (Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965: Mitk Publications, Everan Museum of Natural History in Armenia). (Excursus: When the level of the lake was lowered in the 1950s, an extensive barrow cemetery was revealed on the reclaimed land just below the Lchashen hillfort.) For the Everan Museum of Natural History see: The Directory of Museums & Living Displays (multiple editions ) edited by Kenneth Hudson. It appears the dating information and reasons for the astronomical interpretation are made in this publication. I cannot find the title or the author names on the internet. Likely now an obscure/rare publication. The paucity of information and evidence is fascinating for the claim that is being made. The reference to Armenian Iron Age artifacts depicting solar systems is obviously a mistake for the particular bronze artifact. An important (somewhat recent) English-language professional publication on Armenian archaeology is Bronze and Early Iron Age Archaeological Sites in Armenia. I. Mt. Aragats and its Surrounding Region by R. S. Badalyan and P. S. Avetisyan ((2007); BAR International Series 1697). The research carried out for the book included the study of the collection in the National Museum of History, Yerevan. Nothing resembling the particular artifact is either mentioned or appears as an illustration/photograph in the book. This is somewhat odd unless there is no provenance for the object and/or no legitimate evidence for the claims made about it. "New Standards in the Analysis of Archaeological Metalwork Using LA-ICP-MS: A Case Study from the South Caucasus Archaeometallurgy Project" by Clayton Meredith, et al. (2011) was published by the Idaho State University (based on analysis carried out there). It carries a picture of the object and the claim that it is a Late BronzeAge II period (circa 15th to 11th centuries BCE) symbolic representation of the solar system. (See: Analysis fo Archaeological Metalwork.pdf) It is a Poster displayed at the 76th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Sacramento, 30 March - 3 April, 2011. No other information is known. Even this article does not make matters clear.
A previous reference cited from (Archaeoastronomy (1984): Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts [but also given as Bronzé dari goti-oratsouits] by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965) = The Belt-Calendar of the Bronze Age, Yerevan by Benik Tumanyan [an Armenian astronomer at the Yerevan Observatory and historian] and Haroutyun Mnatsakanyan [also given as A. O. Mnazakanian, Russian archaeologist]. (Note: Also referenced as Belt Calendar of the Bronze Age, Yerevan by B. E. Tumanian and A. O. Mnazakanian (1965); but there is no English-language translation.) It is indicated that Mnazakanian spent about a decade excavating at Lake Sevan. The 56 page publication deals with: (1) the belt calendar [also described as a geocentric model of the universe]; (2) the old solar calendar; and (3) the so-called solar system artifact. It appears the artifacts were unearthed circa 1946-1948 in the vicinity of Lake Sevan. For at least several pages of discussion with illustrations see: UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] Undergraduate Science Journal, Volume 4, Issue 1, 1967. I can't readily access the journal but the article covers at least pages 12 & 13. Also, "Notes on the Sculpture of the Church of Akhthamar" by Armenag Sakisian (The Art Bulletin, Volume 25, Number 4, December 1943, Pages 346-357), is indicated as discussing similarities between

medieval Armenian khachkar (khach'k'ar) iconography and bronze age artifacts. I can't readily access this journal.
It is stated that: "Among the ancient artifacts found in Armenia during several decades of archaeological excavations by scientists from Armenia's National Academy many of them are identified to possess astronomical features. According to B. E. Toumanyan this particular belt contains ornaments of the sun, moon, animals, and different geometrical shapes and points. He apparently claims (The History of Armenian Astronomy by Dr. B. E. Toumanyan (1985, Yerevan State University Press)): "A study of the belt (sic) of the calendars of neighboring countries of those days and of old Armenian manuscripts show that the belt served as a calendar, and that the lunar-solar calendar was used in ancient Armenia." According to an article in a
1974 issue of the magazine Soviet Union, the days of the week marked on it are named after the sun, the
moon and five visible planets. Also claimed is an archaeological examination has proved that it was used by
priests who lived in the Armenian Highlands at the end of the second and the beginning of the first
millennium BCE. I have never seen an explanation of how this was supposedly determined. There is the
claim that it was found in the tomb of a priest dating to the 2nd-millennium BCE. Bronze belts have all been
found in graves and worn by both men and women, hence the interpretation of jewellery. This sort of
speculation about archaeological objects and sites found in Armenia is taken as sufficient to imply that the
Armenian Highlands was busy centre of astronomical activity during the bronze age.
According to the article in a 1974 issue of the journal Soviet Union the bronze so-called calendar-belt was recovered from an ancient burial ground near the Armenian village of Sanait (Senait?). Where this village is in relation to Lake Sevan I do not know.
Conference, At the Northern Frontier of Near Eastern Archaeology: Recent Research on Caucasia and Anatolia in the Bronze Age, 9-11 January 2013, UnisersitàCa Foscari Venezia (Ca' Foscari University of Venice). Arianna Sofia Zischow (Humboldt Universität Berlin – Germany) presented a poster session: "Caucasian Bronze Belts in Context." Abstract: "Bronze belts are recurring features of Late Bronze-Early Iron Age burial sites of the Southern Caucasus. In the course of time they have been the object of several studies, most of which comprise stylistic analyses carried out with the scope of establishing a chronological order or to distinguish geographical groups. Various scholars have devoted themselves to an interpretation of the depictions on the figuratively ornamented belts. In my presentation, however, I would like to focus on the specific contexts in which these belts occur. Based on data from a small number of sufficiently well published burial sites (e. g. Tli, Kalakent and Narekvavi) I will address - among others - the following questions: How frequently do belts appear in the burials of a given site? Are they found together with a certain set of grave goods on a regular basis? Are there variations between sites? Are especially the richly ornamented belts confined to exceptional burials in terms of construction or number and quality of grave goods? The answers to these questions might contribute to the understanding of these objects thereby allowing conclusions on their possible function and meaning within the social context of the Late BronzeEarly Iron Age societies." There is no suggestion of support for the Bronze Age Calendar-Belt interpretation.
An interesting discussion of 4 Armenia bronze belts in the Musée d’Archéologie Nationale of SaintGermain-en-Laye - with a proposed date of 9th-7th century BCE - is: "Observations on Four Bronze Belts from the Alaverdi Area, Armenia." by Manuel Castelluccia (Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 17, Issue 4, 2003, Pages 359-369). Present-day, the town of Alaverdi is part of the northeastern Armenian province of Lori. See also: The Archaeology of the Caucasus: From Earliest Settlements to the Iron Age by Antonio Sagona (2017, Page 398): "Among the most string items of jewellery across the Caucasus are the ornamented bronze belts. The total number of bronze belts with a known provenance stands at 349." Both publications have illustrations of bronze belts.
Also published nearly a decade later by Benik Tumanian: "Measurement of Time in Ancient and Medieval Armenia." by Benik E. Tumanian (Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 5, Issue 2, 1974, Pages 9198). The astronomer author was with the Yerevan Observatory.
Exaggerated astronomical claims for Armenia appear in the recently published "Ancient Astronomy in Armenia" by Elma S. Parsamian (2017). In: Non-Stable Universe edited by Areg M. Mickaelian, et al. (Pages

Note: Recently (29 November 2017) identified by me as providing some valuable information is: Recent Advances in Laser Ablation ICP-MS for Archaeology edited by Laure Dussubieux, Mark Golitko, and Bernard Gratuze (2016). See especially pages 117, 118, 120. Page 117: The metalwork objects from Horom were analysed by Aram Gevorkyan in the 1990s but the results have only been published in this 2016 book. Arc optical emission spectroscopy was the principal method of archaeometallurgical analysis in the southern Caucasus and throughout the former Soviet Union until the 1990s. Page 118: The object was one of several (including 3 pins interpreted as representing the solar system) recovered by the Nor Kyank salvage operations from the Horom necropolis site and interpreted as representations of the solar system. [Archaeological investigations were initiated at Horom due to the construction of the Nor Kyank dam and reservoir in 1987-1989, creating flooding of the area. The bronze age archaeological site of Horom is opposite the dam and reservoir.] Page 120: The original analysis was done by A. V. Gevorkyan using the Arc (Spark) OES instrument at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Yerevan. This instrument no longer works. (Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is a well trusted analytical tool that offers fast, accurate elemental analysis for metal composition. It is not used for dating. The Bronze Age starts at different areas of the world at different times. Radiocarbon dating is used to date the bronze age. (Synchronisms derived from datable objects can also be used. Also, the new method of Bayesian modelling, a method of statistical analysis, applied to Radiocarbon dating, has led to a shift in the chronology of the Early Bronze Age up to 200 years earlier than previously thought.))
Note: Also recently (29 November 2017) identified by me as providing some relevant information is: Archaeozoology of the Near East by Marjan Mashkour, Mark Beech (2017). Page 82: "Horom burials are located in the Artik region. They are dated to the 1st millennium BC (9th-8th centuries BC). This suggests there has been improvements in modern standards of radiocarbon dating of the Bronze Age. The excavations [at the Horom burials which recovered the object in question] were made by the archaeologist R. Badalyan." This seems to contradict dating that falls within the 2nd-millennium BCE. (Rubin Badalyan is now at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, NAS-RA (established 1959). In the scientific studies of the Institute are involved Departments of Early Archaeology (directed by Dr. R. Badalyan). The Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, NAS-RA is an Armenian Institute.)
In Armenia there is a close collaboration between science and tourism i.e., between science institutions/scientists and academics and travel agencies/experts in tourism. The promotion of "science tourism" has been established for several decades. A lot of claims originating out of Armenia seem to be aimed at bolstering their economically important tourist industry. The 1980's saw the beginning of nationalist mythmaking in Armenia. It was influenced by the belief that the Soviet Armenian historians were intent on undermining the national consciousness of the Armenian people by promoting the idea of a common Caucasian history. Needless to say this is a controversial viewpoint. The centre for the Armenian nationalist project has been Yerevan. During the 1970's Armenian historians at the University in Yerevan wrote the 4volume History of the Armenian People; which is a history that is acceptable to them (and to be used with caution). For a reasonable discussion of Armenia scholars perpetuating pseudo-history (Armenian nationalist project) see: The Armenians From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars by Razmik Panossian (2006). Armenian independence was achieved in September 1991. The standard English-language history of Armenia The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times edited by Richard Hovannisian (2 Volumes, 1997). It is a general survey of Armenian history. The editor is Professor of Armenian and Near Eastern History, University of California, Los Angeles; and also the Holder of the Armenian Educational Foundation Chair in Modern Armenian History at the University of California, Los Angeles. Its scholarship stands outside of the Armenian nationalist project. For an excellent explanation of Armenian nationalism and archaeology/history see: "Nationalism, politics, and the practice of archaeology in the Caucasus." (Pages
149-174) In: Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology edited Philip L. Kohl and Clare Fawcett (1995).
Were the bronze object and the bronze belt interpreted/categorised simply within an Armenian perspective of history (i.e., ideological framework)? Was the bronze age being used as a broad category? Was radiocarbon dating used or was dating made through stratigraphic relatiuonships or stylistic dating of objects?

Armenian astronomical publications dealing with historical maters can contain numerous mistakes and at times a low level of scholarship. Exaggerated and patently false claims to great antiquity appear in popular and professional articles by Armenian authors. Many claims are doubtful and can be dismissed as lacking suitable levels of proof. The various claims warrant critical scrutiny. Being critical does not mean that one is leaving out consideration of possibilities. The issue is the possibilities being presented are so far indicated as unpersuasive. Without satisfactory and irrefutable answers about the object we are safe in saying that we have uncertainty and speculation. Speculation is speculation and establishes nothing. It is important to have some firmly established details about the object before one speculates that it is a model of a geocentric solar system.
It seems to be accepted/assumed that the particular bronze artifact originated in Armenia. However, perhaps it came from western Iran. According to The Cambridge History of Iran (1983, See the discussion pages 506-536): During the Early Bronze Age, north-western Iran formed a single cultural zone with Armenia and southern Georgia, which entered into the orbit of what is known as the Kuro-Araxes culture. That said, when comparing it to various images of the Armenian medieval khachkar (cross) I tend to think there are similarities. It appears it existed in one form or another before its Christian employment. Perhaps something interesting can be found in "A History of Archaeology in the Republic of Armenia." by Ian Lindsay and Adam Smith (Journal of Field Archaeology, Volume 31, Number 2, Summer, 2006, Pages 165-184).
The 'Armenian Highland' has been home to a culture that until recently has been thought by some to be little known in the West. This is not quite correct. (When Armenia was part of the Soviet bloc most Armenian scholars wrote either in Russian or one of the local languages, which most Western scholars do not read.) Regarding dubious claim for the West being isolated from knowledge of Armenia astronomy and claims for ancient astronomical artifacts; pages 14-17 of the Armenian Astronomical Society Newsletter, Number 82, provides a list 69 references related to Armenian archaeoastronomy and history of astronomy in Armenia. For a bibliography of Armenian rock art research see: http://www.armrockart.nt.am/books.htm One last example ("Rock Carvings of Armenia" by K. S. Tokhatyan (Fundamental Armenology, Number 2, 2015): http://www.fundamentalarmenology.am/datas/pdfs/180.pdf Unfortunately the Armenians scholars who now seek to inform the West about their culture have created the demonstrable problem that what they claim is biased. It is likely not a good idea to consider that somehow Armenian claims for the history of their astronomy may be informative. Indicated as examples of recent popular claims: (1) Armenian Astronomical Society Newsletter, Number 78, February 28, 2015, Pages 12-17: http://www.aras.am/ArasNews/arasnews78.pdf; and (2) Armenian Astronomical Society Newsletter, Number 82, June 30, 2015, Pages 12-17 (also interesting is Page 11 regarding the promotion of scientific tourism): http://www.aras.am/ArasNews/arasnews82.pdf To access the paper presented by Elma Parsamian at Oxford VI/SEAC 99 see: ftp://ftp.vhs-gilching.de/SEAC1999-OXFORD-searchable.pdf (Pages 77-82). On page 77: "On Armenian territory , a belt calendar and geocentric model of the universe were discovered from the Bronze Era, dating back to the XI century BC (Tumanian, Mnazakanian, 1965)."

The best (most comprehensive) bibliography is: A Bibliography of Articles on Armenian Studies in Western Journals, 1869-1995 by Vrej N. Nersessian (2013). It also needs to be noted that when Armenia was part of the Soviet bloc most Armenian scholars wrote either in Russian or one of the local languages, which most Western scholars do not read.
When it comes to knowledge of the origin of the constellations the Armenian literature (popular and sometimes professional) shows a continuing dependence on dated popular books by Edward Maunder and William Olcott (and even Carl Swartz), and such (and misunderstands who they were); which I find surprising. Also interesting is the constant astronomical interpretations made by Benik Tumanyan. It would be interesting to know more about him. My understanding for his life dates are: 1917-1980.

Professional historians and lay/hobby historians
Some individuals are engaged in fringe history. Their aim is to promote a version of Armenian history that makes it appear more ancient. Included in their aims is the intention to cast doubts on the concept of the settlement of the Armenians in the Anatolian plateau and the Southern Caucasus as a result of migration. Interestingly, there is no compelling reason offered why these individuals have the competence to decide conclusively about Armenian history. There is a disconnect between academic historians/archaeologists and self-promoted lay/hobby historians regarding Armenian history. Entry into the field is easy through the popular media. The lay/hobby historians reject criticism of their constructed world views.
Vahán Setyán
An interesting example of a person promoting the idea of Armenia as an ancient key civilisation having a unique place in history is Vahán Setyán:
Vahán Setyán has been identified as a psychologist. At https://www.linkedin.com/in/vahan-setyan-msc-phdc9a45b798 he is identified as a Healthcare Development Consultant working out of Scottsdale, Arizona. Obviously he is not a professional historian/archaeolgist/anthropologist/linguist. At https://jimmychurchradio.com/tag/vahan-setyan/ "Vahan Setyan has been examining world mythology, language and civilizations for the last decade. He is an independent researcher and regularly collaborates with scholars and researchers in various fields including anthropology and Armenology. He continues with his collaborations with Armenologists and historians around the world to further examine, decipher and reveal most of the prehistoric elements that continue to be hidden within the Armenian highlands, the Armenian language and their revolutionary effects on human civilization and languages. ..."
At http://www.abrilbooks.com/vahan-a-setyan "Vahan Setyan arrived to the United States in 1988. After completing his undergraduate degree in 2002, he continued in pursuing a graduate and doctoral degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. This provided the opportunity to examine contemporary organizations and ancient civilizations, further examining the aspects of altruistic behaviors and how they are perceived and utilized. This opened the door to further examine ancient mythologies and civilizations from the end of the Last Ice age to the fall of the Roman Empire and with it, allowed him to understand the hidden, neglected and forgotten history of the Armenian people. All of his examinations are primarily based on logical and evidential perspectives, attempting to understand the natural explanations of human history. Setyan has been on numerous TV interviews and video conferences, speaking about the historicity of the Armenian people. ..." The real issue of course is peer reviewed/refereed papers in high-ranking professional journals. Professional peer review is the regulatory mechanism/process used by publishers and editors of academic/scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author's scholarly or scientific peers). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc. Peer review cancels individual biases. I am presently not aware of any English-language (North American or European) journal publications by Vahán Setyán on his particular views of Armenian history that meet this criteria.
It appears that after only 10 years of informal (apparently part-time) self-study Vahán Setyán believed he was competent to deal with historical, archaeological, anthropology, religious, and linguistic matters dealing with the history of Armenia (and refute formally trained specialists with expert knowledge).
The (prehistoric?) standing stone complex at Zorac' K'arer (Karahunj)
It is usual now to misdescribe Zorats K'arer as a prehistoric megalithic structure. Walled stone fortresses situated on mountain slopes are the dominant settlement type of the late 2nd-millennium/early/1stmillennium southern Transcaucasia, including northeastern Armenia and the Sevan Basin and the Ararat and Shirak plains. "The era [Late Bronze Age] is marked most conspicuously by the reappearance of numerous permanent settlements in the form of variably sized stone-masonry fortresses built atop hills and outcrops. These fortified settlements are often associated with large cemeteries ...." (The Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies, Volume I by Adam Smith, Ruben Badalyan, and Pavel Avetisyan (2009, Page 29).)

Karahunj (Zorac' K'arer) is located on rocky promontory at the deep canyon of Dar river, 1,770 m above the sea level. Archaeologists identify it as an ancient fortification and settlement. The nearby grave yards persisting over generations are one reason the the stone structure is identified as a fortress and settlement. Archaeological dating methods make it most likely this is a settlement and megalithic necropolis from the Middle Bronze Age - Iron Age. According to German research (by Institut für Vorderasiatische Archäologie der Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität München, in 2000), this site served for the burials in the Middle Bronze Age - Iron Age (the 3rd - 2nd millennium BCE). However, according to a poorly argued alternative theory that appeared in 1984 this is purportedly the world's oldest astronomical observatory, built in the 6thmillennian BCE. The standing stones with large diameter holes were supposedly used as astronomical instruments. It was a prehistoric astronomical observatory, similar to Stonehenge in England. The comparison was obviously made when it was believed that Stonehenge was an astronomical observatory. Such an idea no longer exists. The further claim is that Armenians from Karahunj were involved in the implementation of Stonehenge - they built Stonehenge. Why such landmarks are repeatedly compared to Stonehenge in England? Prehistoric stone circles are found in many places around the world - e.g. in Brazil, Australia, Egypt and elsewhere, sometimes these landmarks are older than Stonehenge. The dating is arrived at by assuming monument is ancient observatory and then, based only on this assumption, calculate the age of the monument after the positions/alignments of stars in ancient times.
Some persons put a lot of weight with speculation (extrapolation from what they believe are credibly made speculative claims involving an astronomical interpretation of the prehistoric standing stone complex at Zorac' K'arer (Karahunj)) such as the late Armenian academic Paris Herouni does. Among the numerous ancient monuments in Armenia there is a megalithic monument complex 250 kilometres south-east of Yerevan that is known as Zoraz Kar and which dates back to 2nd-millennium BCE. Vertical megaliths many of which are more than 2 metres in height form stone rings resembling the ancient stone monuments (henges) in Great Britain and Brittany. The main stone ring of Zoraz Kar is more than 30 metres in diameter. Some stones found in the eastern part there have well polished round holes, which some people like to speculate could have been used to make astronomical observations. The village of Karahunge is in the same region about 40 kilometres from Zoraz Kar.
Some people think that perhaps a suitable starting point is the prehistoric standing stone complex at Zorac' K'arer (Karahunj). The late Armenian academic Paris Herouni thought so. See his English-language book, Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history (2004). See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorats_Karer But also see: "Astronomy in the Ancient Caucasus" by Irakli Simonia and Badri Jijelava; in: Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy edited by Clive Ruggles (2015, Pages 1443-1451). It has some valid cautionary remarks concerning interpreting the standing stone complex at Zorac' K'arer (Karahunj). Interestingly, it does not mention the so-called "bronze age solar system artifact." Apparently there is a longer version of "Armenian Astronomy in the Bronze Age" by Joseph Ouzounian available (implied as approximately 13 pages). See: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Armenianastronomy-Bronze-Joseph-Ouzounian/dp/B00073CP4E Hopefully people are looking for claims that are supportable and not wanting to build a house with a stone.
Frequent reference is made to the prehistoric standing stone complex at Zorac' K'arer (= Zorats Karer = Carahunge = Karahunj). (There is no mention of Karahunj, the 'Armenian Stonehenge' in the Moscow exhibition. But then the artefact is from a later period.) The Armenian academic Paris Herouni (1933-2008) thought it was an ancient observatory. See his English-language book, Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history (2004). His discussion is completely uncritical and he follows the pseudo historical claims of Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval. Even the occult pseudo-historians Lytle Robinson and Edgar Cayce are given credence. So-called belt-calendars are not mentioned by Herouni. (Paris Herouni's book Armenians and old Armenia (2004) is almost completely unreliable and is best avoided. It is one of the few English-language books with an archaeoastronomy subject matter. It is simply a mess of bad astronomy and bad history.) See also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorats_Karer But also see: "Astronomy in the Ancient Caucasus" by Irakli Simonia and Badri Jijelava; in: Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy edited by Clive Ruggles (2015, Pages 1443-1451).

According to Ed Krupp (Hastro-L, March 2016) an avenue of standing stones does extend northeast from the primary chambered cairn at Zorats Karer, and it is said to be aligned with the major standstill northern moonrise. Lunar alignments have been attributed to megalithic monuments in western Europe but the case for most of them remains problematic. Ed Krupp notes that he included major and minor northern and southern moonset lines on Griffith Observatory's Lower West Terrace in the $93-million renovation and expansion completed in 2006, and personal experience has demonstrated how difficult it is to observe the standstill moon and establish its limit with any precision. A variety of practical problems complicate the observation even when one knows what the moon is doing.
Ed Krupp states (Hastro-L, March 2016) that in his October 2015 visit to the Caucasus he reached Lake Sevan. His conclusion is that most of the astronomical claims made for it make no sense. Among the issues is the meteorology - the viewing conditions or poor due to the adverse weather and clouds. Copies of Paris Herouni's book, Armenians and Old Armenia were on sale at Lake Sevan. In Ed Krupp's assessment the book contains some interesting cultural material, but its astronomical analysis is labored and unpersuasive. Regarding the stone ruin. Ed Krupp importantly points out the ruin is a mix of many epochs, and the primary astronomical "alignments" involve relatively large holes - useless for astronomical observation - in stones that were actually part of a Hellenistic wall and not part of the original prehistoric site. Furthermore, the extraordinarily archaic date argued by some for the site was astronomically calculated from the very implausible alignments of the holes in the stones. Genuine archaeological examination of the site provides a more recent and more reasonable date for the site. Even the most superficial examination of the site confirms it was a prehistoric necropolis with numerous chambered cairns, at least one of which is encircled by standing stones. Another point made by Ed Krupp is the most remarkable thing about Zorats Karer is that it exists at all in this region. He remarks he visited other prehistoric standing stones, stone rows (for example, at Hartashen a village in the Syunik Province of Armenia), dolmens, and such in Armenia, but as far as could be ascertained, nothing else on the scale of Zorats Karer has been reported. Its apparent singularity, not its alleged astronomy, is what requires attention.
Note: Cloudy skies predominate 7-8 months of the year in the territory of Armenia. A greater frequency of cloudy skies is characteristic of the high-mountain areas of Armenia. With mountainous elevation cloud cover increases. A characteristic of cloud cover is that is the fact that variations of the frquency of cloud cover from one month to the next are small. The annual variation of the number of clear days is naturally opposite to the annual variation of cloudy days. With some exceptions, throughout the entire territory of Armenia, the maximum number of clear days fall in August-September. (Manual on Climate of the USSR, Issue 16, Armenian SSR, Part V. Cloud Cover and Atmospheric Phenomena. (Foreign Aerospace Science and Technology Center, 1992. Translation of USSR document published in 1969.))
It is reasonable to conclude that it is not possible to defend Armenian claims about Zorats Karer and that skepticism towards those claims would be quite reasonable. See: "Carahunge - A Critical Assessment" by A. César González-García In: Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy edited by Clive Ruggles (2014, Part VIII, Pages 1453-1460). "Abstract: Carahunge is a megalithic monument in southern Armenia that has often been acclaimed as the oldest observatory. The monument, composed of dozens of standing stones, has some perforated stones. The direction of the holes has been measured and their orientation is related to the sun, moon, and stars, obtaining a date for the construction of such devices. After a critical review of the methods and conclusions, these are shown as untenable."
Perhaps useful is: "A History of Archaeology in the Republic of Armenia." by Ian Lindsay and Adam T. Smith (Journal of Field Archaeology, Volume 31, Issue 2, 2006, Pages 165-184).
On the subject of Armenian calendars. Benik Tumanian, in his uncritical article "Measurement of Time in Ancient and Medieval Armenia" (JHA, 5, 1974, 91-98) states (Page 91): "The seven-day week was current here [in bronze age Armenia] as in Babylon. There is every reason to believe that the week-days were given the names of the seven "planets"." The concept of the 7-day week is wrongly believed to have originated in Mesopotamia/West Asia. The continuous weekly cycle of 7 days only became a standard unit for the measurement of time during the period of the Roman Empire. The (7-day) planetary week is a Hellenistic invention.
The origin of the Armenians

Little is known about the origin of the Armenians. The Armenians did not originate in Anatolia/Armenian Highlands. Nor is it indicated that they lived there 4000 to 3000 years ago. Nor is it indicated that they had a common origin. They are not native to the Armenian Highlands. On the available evidence it is thought likely that the Armenians belonged to the same migratory waves of (Indo-European) Balkan immigrants that started moving into Anatolia in the late 2nd-millennium BCE. They originally settled in the region around Lake Van. The Armenian nation was formed from Bronze Age mixing of multiple (and diverse) Eurasian population groups (various native and migrating people), between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE.
Brief approximate chronology/bibliography of professional publications mentioning the object
Finding professional references for the claim that the object is a bronze age (geocentric) solar system model is difficult. The paucity of information and evidence is fascinating for the claim that is being made. When references are located there is a lack of suitable information for the claim. Note: The reference to Armenian Iron Age artifacts depicting the solar system is obviously a mistake for the particular bronze artifact.
(1) Some details were published in "Armenian Astronomy in the Bronze Age." by Joseph Ouzounian (Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of the Center for Archaeoastronomy, Volume VII, Numbers 1-4, JanuaryDecember, 1984, Pages 105-109). The article is interesting but somewhat speculative. (It is unfortunate that the editors of the journal in which this speculation first appeared did not ask the author relevant questions.) It appears the artifact was unearthed in 1946 near Lake Sevan. See specifically page 107 for a brief discussion and pages 10-12 of reference 9 (Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965: Mitk Publications, Everan Museum of Natural History in Armenia).
(2) Regarding Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965: Mitk Publications, Everan Museum of Natural History in Armenia.) It appears the dating information and reasons for the astronomical interpretation are made in this publication. I cannot find the title or the author names on the internet. Likely now an obscure/rare publication. A previous reference cited from (Archaeoastronomy (1984) is indicated as the source of the claims for the object: Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts [but also given as Bronzé dari goti-oratsouits] by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965) = The Belt-Calendar of the Bronze Age, Yerevan by Benik Tumanyan [an Armenian astronomer at the Yerevan Observatory and historian] and Haroutyun Mnatsakanyan [also given as A. O. Mnazakanian, Russian archaeologist]. (Note: Also referenced as Belt Calendar of the Bronze Age, Yerevan by B. E. Tumanian and A. O. Mnazakanian (1965); but there is no English-language translation.) It is indicated that Mnazakanian spent about a decade excavating at Lake Sevan. The 56 page publication deals with: (1) the belt calendar [also described as a geocentric model of the universe]; (2) the old solar calendar; and (3) the so-called solar system artifact. It appears the artifacts were unearthed circa 1946-1948 in the vicinity of Lake Sevan. Note: It is usual to describe the bronze belts as jewellery.
(3) For at least several pages of discussion with illustrations see: UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] Undergraduate Science Journal, Volume 4, Issue 1, 1967. I can't readily access the journal but the article covers at least pages 12 & 13. (Also, "Notes on the Sculpture of the Church of Akhthamar" by Armenag Sakisian (The Art Bulletin, Volume 25, Number 4, December 1943, Pages 346-357), is indicated as discussing similarities between medieval Armenian khachkar iconography and bronze age artifacts. I can't readily access this journal.)
(4) The late Armenian academic Paris Herouni, following the pseudo-historians Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, made numerous erroneous claims for Armenian archaeoastronomy. See his English-language book, Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history (2004).
(5) "Astronomy in the Ancient Caucasus" by Irakli Simonia and Badri Jijelava; in: Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy edited by Clive Ruggles (2015, Pages 1443-1451) interestingly does not mention the so-called "bronze age solar system artifact."
(6) "Armenian Astronomy in the Bronze Age" by J. G. Ouzounian (Archaeoastronomy, Volume 7, 1984, Pages 105-109). Apparently there is a longer version of "Armenian Astronomy in the Bronze Age" by Joseph Ouzounian available (implied as approximately 13 pages).
(7) It has been suggested that Irakli Simonia, who is very familiar with historic Armenian astronomical references, would know more details about the object. But Ed Krupp (Hastro-L, March 2016) identifies the

object is not mentioned in Irakli's papers, written in English, on ancient and historic astronomy in Armenia.
(8) An important (somewhat recent) English-language professional publication on Armenian archaeology is Bronze and Early Iron Age Archaeological Sites in Armenia. I. Mt. Aragats and its Surrounding Region by
R. S. Badalyan and P. S. Avetisyan ((2007); BAR International Series 1697). Note: Badalyan also appears as Badalyn i.e., Rubin Badalyn. The research carried out for the book included the study of the collection in the National Museum of History, Yerevan. Nothing resembling the particular artifact is either mentioned or appears as an illustration/photograph in the book. This is somewhat odd unless there is no provenance for the object and/or no legitimate evidence for the claims made about it.
(9) "New Standards in the Analysis of Archaeological Metalwork Using LA-ICP-MS: A Case Study from the South Caucasus Archaeometallurgy Project" by Clayton Meredith, et al. (2011) was published by the Idaho State University (based on analysis carried out there). It carries a picture of the object and the claim that it is a Late Bronze-Age II period (circa 15th to 11th centuries BCE) symbolic representation of the solar system. (See: Analysis of Archaeological Metalwork.pdf) It is a Poster displayed at the 76th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Sacramento, 30 March - 3 April, 2011. No other information is known. Even this Poster does not make matters clear.
(10) Recent Advances in Laser Ablation ICP-MS for Archaeology edited by Laure Dussubieux, Mark Golitko, and Bernard Gratuze (2016). See especially pages 117, 118, 120. Page 117: The metalwork objects from Horom were analysed by Aram Gevorkyan in the 1990s but the results have only been published in this 2016 book. (Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is a well trusted analytical tool that offers fast, accurate elemental analysis for metal composition. It is not used for dating. The Bronze Age starts at different areas of the world at different times. Radiocarbon dating is most usually used to date the bronze age. Human skeletal material when existing, is used. (Synchronisms derived from datable objects can also be used. Also, the new method of Bayesian modelling, a method of statistical analysis, applied to Radiocarbon dating, has led to a shift in the chronology of the Early Bronze Age up to 200 years earlier than previously thought.)) Measurements of radiocarbon in some types of human skeletal remains and other materials are complicated by a number of influencing factors comprising what is called the "reservoir effect/s" = spurious radiocarbon dates. Radiocarbon dating efforts must take reservoir effects into account and adjust for them. The stylistic form of ceramic and metal artefacts were perhaps used for dating periods.
Arc optical emission spectroscopy was the principal method of archaeometallurgical analysis in the southern Caucasus and throughout the former Soviet Union until the 1990s. Page 118: The object was one of several (including 3 pins interpreted as representing the solar system) recovered by the Nor Kyank salvage operations from the Horom necropolis site and interpreted as representations of the solar system. Page 120: The original analysis was done by A. V. Gevorkyan using the Arc (Spark) OES instrument at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Yerevan. This instrument no longer works.
(11) Exaggerated astronomical claims for Armenia appear in the recently published "Ancient Astronomy in Armenia" by Elma S. Parsamian (2017). In: Non-Stable Universe edited by Areg M. Mickaelian, et al. (Pages 279-285). Note: 2016 international conference proceedings. Once again no useful details are given for the particular object.
(12) Archaeozoology of the Near East by Marjan Mashkour, Mark Beech (2017). Chronological discussions of the bronze age era have been framed around the material record that has been recovered from mortuary contexts. Page 82: "Horom burials are located in the Artik region. They are dated to the 1st millennium BC (9th-8th centuries BC). The excavations were made by the archaeologist R. Badalyan." This suggests revisions in radiocarbon dating methodology (or some other dating methodology).
Especially since Armenia declared its independence in 1991 archaeological sites and artifacts have been reimagined to support a range of agendas including nationalism (i.e., an imagined ancient Armenian nation), historical (i.e., ancient age of Armenian astronomy), tourism (attracting overseas visitors, especially to reimagined archaeological sites), and consumerism (i.e., branding of consumer items). From 1959 there was a move towards a national archaeology of Armenia. "The difficulty archaeologists and historians face in examining the ancient worlds of the Caucasus is reading against the grain of this tendency to render contemporary sociopolitical orders as inherent in place rather than generated within complex histories of



2022. 02. 21. 19:55 History of Constellation and Star Names

place ...." (The Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies, Volume I by Adam Smith, Ruben Badalyan, and Pavel Avetisyan (2009, Page 4).)
It appears the single source for the astronomical claim for the object (and also the bronze belt) is Bronze Dari Goti-Orats'uyts by H. Mnats'aganian and R. T'umanian (1965: Mitk Publications, Everan Museum of Natural History in Armenia.) It appears the dating information and reasons for the astronomical interpretation are made in this publication. The astronomical interpretations of the bronze jewellery items comprising the so-called 'solar system' and 'belt-calendar' are likely to be ingenious but strained attempts. (There is every indication that some historical/archaeological information provided by some Armenian professionals is simply fiction.) It also appears its analysis and assessment of the object, made over 50 years ago, has never been reviewed unless perhaps recently (circa 2011). An interesting recent source of information is Recent Advances in Laser Ablation ICP-MS for Archaeology edited by Laure Dussubieux,
Mark Golitko, and Bernard Gratuze (2016). This has some additional and different information about the object. No solar system interpretations have apparently been made for any bronze age artifact recovered from other archaeological sites. The particular artefact, but not the 3 pins, is sui generis. Many Armenian academics are now part of the promotion of Armenian pseudohistory. The root of all human history and civilisation is claimed to be Armenian; to originate in the prehistoric Armenian highlands some 1,000,000 years ago. Examples of fantasist Armenian astronomical claims are: (1) Bronze age geocentric models of the solar system, (2) bronze age belt calendars, (3) Karahunj is a 7000 year old astronomical observatory, (4) use of a 9000 year old lunisolar calendar, and (5) the constellations and zodiac originated in Armenia some 5000 years ago. Extreme claims about Armenian history/archaeology can be expected to continue. These unscientific claims (or rather myths) are now difficult to dispel. They now appear to be integrated into the Armenian national identity.

Hemisphaerium Australe
The celestial maps are from the edition of Aratus by Johann Buhle (Leipzig, 2 volumes, 1793-1801) who took them, with certain simplifying modifications, from Johann Schaubach's edition of the Catasterismi of Eratosthenes. They show the shapes and positions of the archaic Greek constellations as they would have appeared in the time of Pseudo-Eratosthenes and Hyginus. The celestial maps, following ancient Greek practice, are polar projections of the ecliptic of the forty-eight classical constellations of Ptolemy. The north celestial pole is placed between the tail of Ursa Minor and Draco. Modern star charts use coordinate lines centred on the celestial equator and poles. Because the stars were not observed to move relative to one another the ancient Greeks thought the stars were fixed on a sphere surrounding the sun and planets.
If constructed, no celestial map has survived from ancient Mesopotamia. Likewise, no celestial map has survived from ancient Greece. The earliest Greek description of the complete celestial sky visible to the Greeks is the astronomical poem Phainomena by Aratus of Soli (written at the turn of the 3rd-century BCE). A number of celestial globes have survived from the Roman period. These are based on Greek uranography. According to the astronomer and researcher Susanne Hoffmann there are several hints pointing to uranographies in both cultures. The Mesopotamian scheme of uranography used what may be termed equatorial coordinates. The Greek scheme of uranography used ecliptical coordinates.
It is difficult to ascertain a clear understanding of astronomical knowledge in the time of Homer and Hesiod the earliest references to Greek astronomy that we have. The Homeric and Hesiodic texts do establish that at this period the astronomical knowledge of the Greeks enabled them to navigate and to reliably perform agricultural work. The only reference to stellar navigation occurs in Homer's Odyssey (Odyssey 5.271-277) when Odysseus sails from Ogygia after receiving instructions from Calypso. The conspicuous constellations that are mentioned in this passage - the Pleiades, Boötes, Orion, and the Great Bear - are obviously connected with navigation.
The ancient Greeks are the main source of present-day Western star/constellation names. The present-day Western constellations are based on the classical Greek constellation set. Also, additional Western constellations were introduced in the 17th and 18th centuries both to fill the gaps remaining in the northern sky and to map the newly-accessible southern sky. The classical Greek constellation set of 48 constellations

survived to the Renaissance through its inclusion in Ptolemy's 2nd-century CE Almagest, and preserved in the Arabic and Byzantine traditions. It would appear that Greek constellations were usually derived from Greek mythology.
The Greek constellations were first described by Eudoxus, Aratus, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, (pseudo-)Eratosthenes, and Hyginus. There is a descriptive tradition and a mathematical tradition for locating the stars. Naturally, the descriptive tradition is earliest. In the descriptive tradition, the stars are located according to their position within the constellations; while in the mathematical tradition, the stars are located according to a set of coordinates.
The Western tradition of describing stars by their positions within constellation figures may have begun with Eudoxus of Cnidus (circa 408-circa 355 BCE). It was certainly continued/established by Eratosthenes of Cyrene (circa 276-circa 196 BCE) and Hipparchus of Nicaea (circa 190-circa 120 BCE). The descriptive method had existed with the Babylonians circa the late 2nd-millennium BCE.
The 3 classical texts setting out the constellation set we have inherited are: (1) Aratus' Phaenomena (3rdcentury BCE, 45 constellations described); (2) Hyginus' De astronomia (1st-century BCE, 44 constellations described); and (3) Ptolemy's Syntaxis [Almagest] (2nd-century CE, 48 constellations described). Both Aratus and Hyginus locate stars descriptively. Ptolemy locates stars by using coordinates. The constellations described by Hyginus are mostly the same constellations described by Aratus, but some are given different names. In Germanicus only 42 constellations are described. Other major Latin translations of Aratus' Phainomena were done by Cicero, and Avienus. (However, the Latin constellation-titles used are from medieval European tradition, and are still current today. Today's Latin names sometimes vary from the names used by Aratus and later Ptolemy. Note: The Aratus Latinus is a crude anonymous translation. The 8thcentury translation is more polished and usually referred to as the Revised Aratus Latinus.) The ancient Greeks named the most prominent stars and established the most obvious constellations by circa 800 BCE. The Greeks never thought of constellating the entire visible sky until circa the 5th-century BCE. By circa 400 BCE (likely under the influence of Babylonian uranography) the Greeks had, by borrowing and invention, established the majority of the 48 classical constellations. The Romans derived a considerable portion of their star lore and uranography from the Greeks.
The star names Sirius ("Scorcher") and Arcturus ("Bear Watcher") are mentioned by Homer and Hesiod in the 8th-century BCE. Homer and Hesiod were two of the earliest Greek poets. Hesiod, a poet and farmer in Boeotia, a region of central Greece, likely lived about the same time or shortly after Homer. The earliest constellation/astral myth of the Greeks appears in Homer's Iliad (and was likely ancient at this time). It is the myth of Orion becoming a constellation after his affair with Eos (Dawn). The astral myth of Orion was first told in full in Hesiod's (now lost) Astronomy. (Fragments of Hesiod's Astronomy were summarised in the Catasterismi by the pseudo-Eratosthenes.) The first Greek works which dealt with the constellations were books dealing with star/constellation myths. The most complete extent Greek works dealing with the mythical origins of the Greek constellations are the Catasterismi by the (conventionally called) pseudoEratosthenes (a Hellenistic writer) and De Munitionibus Castrorum by the (conventionally called) pseudoHyginus (an early Roman writer). Each of these authors drew extensively from the writings of older sources such as Homer and Hesiod, and their successors. They provide a clear overview of the stories that lay behind the present-day Western constellations we use.
In the Phainomena of Aratus (circa 275 BCE) 44 constellations are named. (Rembrandt Duits has pointed out: "The Aratean procedure for mapping the sky is astrologically completely neutral.") Within the poem the constellations are descriptively arranged into two main areas, the northern constellations (including all of the zodiacal constellations), and the southern constellations. (The goal of the Phainomena was to entertain and educate the literate upper class of Greek society. The contents, especially the brief sections on seasonal signs and weather signs, are too sophisticated for ordinary farmers and sailors.) The star names mentioned by Aratus are Sirius, Arcturus, Procyon ("Forerunner of the Dog"), Stachys ("Ear of Corn," now Spica), and Protrugater ("Herald of the Vintage"). The poem of Aratus was was a product of the Hellenistic Greek culture centred not at Alexandria, where scientific activity flourished, but at Athens and the Macedonian court there. The Phainomena describes the constellation figures of the night sky that embodied the cultural history and traditions of the world of Aratus. (In addition to the Phainomena, Aratus' poetic compositions are said to have included a series of funeral dirges, elegies, epigrams, and hymns, as well as a noted hymn to Pan.)

The constellation scheme described by Ptolemy (Almagest, circa 140 CE) consisted of 21 northern constellations, 12 zodiacal constellations, and 15 southern constellations.
Theories concerning the origin of the constellations remain largely speculative. Arguments for the origin of some constellations in the Palaeolithic Period remain very controversial. The extant evidence clearly indicates the significant role of Mesopotamian civilization in the origin of the constellations. (Likely dating to the Sumerians in the late 3rd millennium BCE.)
There is some evidence for the existence of constellations in the late 3rd millennium BCE in Sumer (Ur III Period) and also in the Middle East in the city-states of Ebla and Mari. In the article "Further Notes on Birmingham Cuneiform Tablets Volume I." (Acta Sumerologica, Volume 13, 1991, Pages 409-417) the Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz (and co-author Philip Watson) include a brief discussion of possible evidence pointing to an Ur III origin of at least some constellation and star names. In her 2002 doctoral thesis "The moon and stars of the southern Levant at Gezer and Megiddo: Cultural astronomy in Chalcolithic/Early and Middle Bronze Ages." Sara Gardner identifies constellations, including a lion constellation (equated with Leo), existing during the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age (circa 4500-2200) in the Levant. (The drawings of animals in Cave 30:IV at Gezer are held to represent constellations.) In their article "The Geometry and Astronomy of Rujm el-Hiri, a Megalithic Site in the Southern Levant." (Journal of Field Archaeology, Volume 25, 1998, Pages 475-496) Anthony Aveni and Yonathan Mizrachi set out the astronomical sophistication of the construction phase of the Rujm el-Hiri complex. (The Greeks had only a few named constellations established by the time of Homer circa 800 BCE. There was no early intention by the Greeks to constellate the entire sky.) The appearance of elaborate constellation sets as reference systems covering most of the visible sky only originated with the development of complex societies. Complex constellation systems make their earliest appearances in the 2nd millennium BCE in the stable kingships of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. In these empires astronomy had become a state supported and state directed enterprise.
Circa 350 BCE the Chinese astronomer Shin Shen prepared what may be the earliest star catalogue. It contained about 800 stars. The oldest known complete sky star map is the Dunhuang star map which originated in China. It is now usually dated to circa 700 CE and is most likely a copy of an older star chart. Its style and content has been identified as being similar to the Yue Ling astronomical text dated circa 300 BCE.
Decanal "star clocks" decorated Egyptian coffin lids starting circa 2100 BCE (and ending circa 1800 BCE). They show that there was a system of 36 named equatorial stars rising within 10 days of each other (and were based on the civil calendar year). These Egyptian "star clocks" are the earliest detailed astronomical texts known. The decanal system can be identified as early as the Third Dynasty (circa 2800 BCE) and may even be earlier.
Constellations are a means of organising the sky by dividing it into smaller segments.
The development of a system of coordinates to enable the positions of individual stars to be located accurately was first achieved in Greece; but only after undergoing considerable evolvement. The fixed stars were first located only in very vague terms. In the Works and Days of Hesiod (circa 7th-century BCE) there exists only the most rudimentary system for identifying particular stars and where to find them in the sky. A first attempt at an exact coordinate system for locating particular stars was not to occur until some 500 years later with the star catalogue of Hipparchus. In the 2nd-century BCE Hipparchus originated a star catalogue in which also he tried to give some reasonably accurate locational coordinates for the stars he listed. However, the coordinate system he used to locate the positions of the stars on his list remains unknown. Hipparchus introduced the system of assigning Greek letters to identify the magnitudes (brightness) of the naked-eye stars in each constellation. Some 300 years later this system of designating stellar magnitude was adopted by Claudius Ptolemy.
The earliest Western star catalogue (as we understand the term) originated with the astronomer Ptolemy (circa 140 CE). The culmination of Greek establishment of constellation (and star) names was contained in (Book VII and Book VIII) of Ptolemy's Almagest written circa 140 CE. In it Ptolemy listed 1025 (fixed) stars. For his star catalogue Ptolemy used one system of coordinates (ecliptic longitudes and latitudes) for all the stars listed in it. (Interestingly, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder (1st-century CE) mentioned the existence of another star catalogue of 1600 stars existing some 75 years prior to Ptolemy's star catalogue.)

The term "early star catalogues" is also commonly applied to descriptions of Greek (and Babylonian) uranography prior to Ptolemy. With few exceptions these "early star catalogues", however, are distinctly different from what modern astronomers, from Ptolemy onwards, have meant by the term. With few exceptions, prior to Ptolemy star catalogues did not give the position of stars by any system of mathematical coordinates. They are instead qualitative descriptions of the constellations. They simply note the number of stars in each part of a constellation and the general location of the brighter stars within a constellation. (The type of description usually used is "near X is Y".) This cumbersome method of describing the location of stars in terms of their relative positions in a constellation was used by both the Babylonians and the Greeks. The pictorial arrangement of stars is not a star catalogue. A star catalogue proper gives accurate positions for each individual star regardless of the constellation it is grouped into. Also, the boundaries of the Greek constellations were subject to change up to the time of Ptolemy.
Early in the 3rd-century BCE the Greek philosophers Timocharis and Aristyllus, using a cross-staff, accurately catalogued the positions (i.e., declinations) of some of the brightest stars. Timocharis, between circa 290-270 BCE, observed the declinations of twelve fixed stars. Aristyllus, continuing the program of Timocharis, observed between circa 280-240 BCE, the declinations of six more fixed stars. This is the first known Greek compilation of measured stellar positions forming a star catalogue. (See: "Ancient Stellar Observations Timocharis, Aristyllos, Hipparchus, Ptolemy - the Dates and Accuracies." by Y. Maeyama (Centaurus, Volume 27, 1984, Pages 280-310.)) It can be deemed the first true star catalogue.
The first catalogue of stars over the entire sky probably originated with the Greek astronomer Hipparchus circa 130 BCE. One of the great achievements of Hipparchus was his (now lost) Catalogue of fixed stars. This star catalogue differed from the earlier and imprecise descriptions of the constellations. To compile his star catalogue Hipparchus apparently used an equatorial armillary sphere to measure the exact ecliptical coordinates (i.e., ecliptic latitude (angular distance from the ecliptic plane) and ecliptic longitude (angular distance from an arbitrary point i.e., the vernal equinox)) of approximately 850 stars. However, it is clear that at the time of Hipparchus a standardised system of spherical coordinates for denoting stellar positions did not exist. In the material that has survived Hipparchus does not use a single consistent coordinate system to denote stellar positions. He inconsistently uses several different coordinate systems, including an equatorial coordinate system (i.e., declinations) and an ecliptic coordinate system (i.e., latitudes and longitudes). (In his Commentary, obviously written before his discovery of precession, the positions of stars, when given, are in a mixed ecliptic-declination system.) In his Commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus Hipparchus largely chose to write at the same qualitative (i.e., descriptive) level as the two authors he critiqued. Only later, obviously after his discovery of precession, did he introduce a system of real ecliptic coordinates where the positions of stars are given in their latitude and longitude (and longitudes increase proportionally with time whilst latitudes remain unchanged).
In Greek astronomy the stars within the constellation figures were usually not given individual names. (There are only a few individual star names from Greece. The most prominent stars in the sky were usually nameless in Greek civilization. If there was a system of Greek star names then it has not come down to us and also would appear unknown to Ptolemy.) Greek constellations ("star catalogues") up to the time of Ptolemy are descriptive. The Western tradition of describing the constellations by means of describing the relative positions of the stars within the constellation figures was firmly established by Eratosthenes and Hipparchus. In their descriptions to the time of Ptolemy the constellations were defined by the Greeks by their juxtaposition (i.e., descriptive comparison of positional relationship to each other). Prior to Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) the general goal of the Greeks at least was not accurate astronomical observation but artistic and mythological education. The end result was a sort of geographical description of territorial position and limits.
Circa the 5th-century BCE many of the constellations recognised by the Greeks had become associated with myths. Both the star catalogue (constellation description) of Eudoxus (4-century BCE) and the star catalogue (constellation description) of Aratus (3rd-century BCE) adopted the vocabulary of myth. In his Castasterismi Eratosthenes (284-204 BCE) completed and standardised this process with each of the constellations being given a mythological significance. Greek astronomy began with the organisation of the more prominent stars into constellations. Bernard Goldstein and Alan Bowen have proposed that the original motivation for Greek astronomy was the construction of star calendars (parapegmata, which correlated dates and weather phenomena with the risings and settings of the stars). In Greece, constellations were introduced as an aid to identify individual stars in the sky in so that they could be recognised at their rising and setting. Connecting

constellations to stories helped people to memorise their various stellar configurations, independently of their astronomical/time-keeping functions.
The earliest known Greek parapēgmata (star calendars) were those by Euktēmon (5th-century BCE), Eudoxus (early 4th-century BCE), and Kallippos (late 4th-century BCE).
The first complete description of the Greek constellations to survive is given by the Greek poet Aratus circa 270 BCE. With only a few exceptions no actual stars are described by Aratus - only constellation figures. This method was undoubtedly inherited from Eudoxus who produced a set of descriptions of constellations in which the relative positions of stars in each of the constellations was described. Eudoxus was likely the first Greek to summarise the Greek system of constellations. The purpose of the Phaenomena by Aratus was to describe the appearance and the organisation of the constellations in the sky with reference to each other. (The Greek 'Phaenomena' = 'Visible Signs.')
Descriptions of constellations in Greece existed as early as Eudoxus, circa early 4th-century BCE). The Greek astronomer Eudoxus, circa 375 BCE, appears to have been the first person to develop a standardised map of the Greek constellations. A complete set of Greek constellations appears to have been first described by Eudoxus in two works called the Enoptron and the Phaenomena. (Eudoxus appears to have been the first person to have comprehensively arranged and described (i.e., consolidated) the Greek constellation set.) The early method of the Greek astronomer Eudoxus for determining the places of the stars was to divide the stars into named constellations and define the constellations partly by their juxtaposition, partly by their relation to the zodiac, and also by their relation to the tropical and arctic circles. The complete (and standardised) constellating of the Greek sky (with 48 constellations) was possibly first achieved by Eudoxus in his work Phaenomena. (The fragments of Eudoxus' lost works, Phaenomena and Enoptron, were collected and published by the classical scholar F. Lassere in his Die Fragmente des Eudoxus von Knidus (1966).)
According to an anonymous Greek commentator of Aratus it was Eudoxus who brought Assyrian uranography to the Greeks. In his works Eudoxus gave descriptions of a large number of constellations known in Mesopotamia. Eudoxus continued the Mesopotamian traditions of constellations in the Mul.Apin series. There is a case for Babylonian astronomy being introduced to the Greeks through Philip of Opus and Eudoxus of Knidos. (Philip (or Philippus) of Opus (Opous), was a Greek philosopher and a member of Plato's Academy during Plato's lifetime. Philip of Opus is probably identical with the Philip of Medma (or Mende).)
The Phaenomena of Aratus was not a scientific work. The Phaenomena described the sky in poetic language and remained a major influence throughout classical antiquity. Without using technical terms, Aratus described the layout of the constellations in the sky and the myths behind their names, as well as meteorological implications of the rising and setting of certain stars. (The Phaenomena of Aratus was modelled on Hesiod's Works and Days.) Cicero (1st-century BCE) wrote that Aratus' poem was essentially a description of a celestial globe constructed by Eudoxus of Cnidos (circa 390-340 BCE): "[He] ... described it in verse, not displaying any knowledge of astronomy but showing considerable poetical skill." Aratus' poetical slant and identification of constellation with mythological identities was continued by later authors, who assigned further mythological identities to constellations: Catasterismi falsely ascribed to Eratosthenes of Cyrene (circa 275-194 BCE), and Poetica Astronomica by Hyginus (1st / 2nd-century CE). Nothing is known of the star globe of Eudoxus.
The Catasterismi: Because Aratus' Phainomena presented only a succinct pictorial description of the constellations it created a demand for a collection the mythological stories relating to the constellations together with a list of their stars. This was met by the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene (circa 276-circa 194 BCE) on catasterisms. His work on catasterisms was in turn re-edited multiple times till it reached the form now known as the Catasterismi. (It is considered falsely attributed to Eratosthenes and is attributed to Pseudo-Eratosthenes.) It is a collection of separate, thematically and syntactically complete sections, each dedicated to one constellation and describing the myths and the position and number of the stars. When the Catasterismi was joined to the poem Phainomena the original order was rearranged so that the sequence of the constellations matched the sequence given by Aratus.
It would appear that star globes preceded star catalogues. A celestial globe is a 3-dimensional map of the stars. A celestial globe shows the apparent position of the stars in the sky. The concept of constructing a

physical model to represent the arrangement of the constellations appears to have originated in ancient Greece. The stars were perceived by the observer looking up at the night sky as being attached to the inside of a hollow sphere with the terrestrial observer being at the centre. Consequently, the earliest attempts to represent the constellations were by means of a star globe. The earliest star globes simply depicted the constellation figures.
Star globes have been used since classical times and were produced initially by Greek astronomers. The beginning of construction of celestial globes can hardly be earlier than the existence of a spherical theory of the heavens. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE) proved that the earth was round. Over 100 years later the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-194 BCE) is said to have calculated the circumference of the earth with considerable accuracy. However, earlier Greeks posited a spherical heaven and that the earth was round.
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes constructed the first celestial globe on record, but it is believed other celestial globes had existed before it. The Greek philosopher Anaximander of Miletus (circa first half of the 6th-century BCE) taught that the sky was a globe/spherical and possibly/probably also invented the celestial globe. It appears the actual term used was 'sphere.' Diogenes Laertius wrote that Anaximander of Miletus had made a sphere. Radim Kocandrle has made the point (2012) that unfortunately, the meaning of the term 'sphere' is not made clear. We do not know whether it was an armillary sphere (model), a celestial globe, or a drawing, or whether the term sphere is only due to an anachronism of later authors. There is no certainty that star globes existed before the time of Eudoxus, i.e., existed with Thales of Miletus and Anaximander of Miletus. It is indicated that the first Hellenic star globe was made by Thales of Miletus but it is not certain.
The 5th- and 4th- centuries BCE saw the introduction of celestial mapping in Greece - including celestial globes. It is indicated that Eudoxus was the first Greek to make a comprehensive star globe. According to the Roman poet and orator Cicero (106-43 BCE), It is indicated that Aratus derived his entire systematic description of the constellations from the star globe constructed by Eudoxus. In Aratus' Phaenomena the description of the human figures at least seem to be taken from those on a star globe. However, a star globe is never mentioned. The earliest extant systematic description of the Greek constellations is found in the Phaenomena of Aratus. His astronomical poem contained the description of 43 constellations and named 5 individual stars. The most significant motivation for the construction of celestial globes with constellation figures originated with the astronomical poem Phaenomena by Aratus (1st half of the 3rd-century BCE).
Both the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus of Rhodes (born Nicaea) (circa 190-120 BCE) and the Hellenic astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (circa 90-170 CE) used mounted celestial globes.
Greek artists gradually began to present the starry sky, particularly the constellations, on the surface of a globe and to place the celestial globe on the shoulders of Atlas who had already in Hesiod (circa 700 BCE) been given the role of carrying the heavens.
The purely scientific celestial globes of the ancient Greeks and Romans were mostly constructed of wood. Later Greek and Roman celestial globes were constructed with the key celestial circles, a dark blue background to represent the night sky, and - post Hipparchus - the stars were indicated by their apparent brightness and colour. The apparent magnitude of stars was represented by discs of 6 different sizes and their colour by either red or yellow.
The earliest star globe makers faced the principal problem of how to position the constellation figures - how are the constellation figures to be positioned on the surface of a star globe. The ancient Greek (and later) astronomers drew the constellations on globes both in sky-view and in rear-view - that is, with the observers inside or outside the globe - and sometimes even on the same globe. This was also done with descriptions of the constellations given in ancient texts.
The terrestrial viewpoint is necessarily from the inside of the celestial sphere looking outwards. Hence, properly, the stars (constellation images) are to be observed from inside the star globe. However, without some elaborate special construction the constellation images cannot be viewed in this way - the view point for a star globe is from outside. The solution decided upon by the earliest star globe makers was to reverse

the relative positions of the constellation images (stars) i.e., east to west for right to left direction, to match watching them from the outside of the celestial sphere looking inwards. This resulted in the depiction of constellation figures being depicted from the back, not only on star globes but also later on Late Antiquity drawings and later Medieval star atlases. The custom from Late Antiquity was to draw constellation figures, particularly the human figures, from the back, as if they were on a star globe. As example: Some of the illustrations in the Leiden Aratea i.e., Serpentarius, Perseus, and Orion. An exception is the figure of Aquarius which faces the observer but is revered right to left, still representing the constellation as it would be seen on a star globe. The same with the early Medieval star atlases. As example: Albrecht Dürer (1515) and Johann Bayer (1603). Johannes Honter (1541) - whose view point was inside looking outside - drew the constellations figures/stars from the front. A much later solution was - when simply drawing star globes - to depict the constellation figures/stars as seen by ignoring the convex surface of the globe and simply assuming that it is a concave surface.
Note: The term Aratea (or Aratea carmina/Carmina Aratea) basically refers to 3 classical Latin translations; those of Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus. In their use of Latin vocabulary and references to Roman life all 3 were distinctly Roman Phaenomena. (See: Lewis, Anne-Marie. (1983, unpublished PhD thesis). From Aratus to the Aratus Latinus: A Comparative Study of Latin Translation.) These surviving Aratea were gradually joined by multiple medieval renderings of Aratus' Phaenomena. The term Aratea now applies to a body of texts that comprise more than 60 manuscripts (and illustrations). The Aratea was almost the only source for medieval readers to gain information about stellar astronomy. The Aratus Latinus: Some time before or during the 8th century CE a Latin translation Aratus Latinus appeared. This translation was based on a text referred to as 'Φ' which was compiled some time between the beginning of the 2nd and end of the 3rd century CE. Hubert Le Bourdellès, based on his linguistic analysis (L'Aratus Latinus, 1985), suggested that it had been copied from an interlinear translation of the Greek Phaenomena. Le Bourdellès proposed that with the gradual decline of Greek, scholars first needed glossaries to read Greek and this led to a now lost 'bilingual' copy. When the Greek text was later abandoned the literal translation, titled Aratus Latinus, began to circulate separately from the first half of the 8th-century. Due to the poor standard of translation it was difficult to comprehend. A revised and modified version of the text was undertaken almost immediately. This text was called the Revised Aratus Latinus. The Revised Aratus Latinus: A revision of the Aratus Latinus (producing the so-called Revised Aratus Latinus, "Aratus latinus recensio interpolata") was most probably carried out in the second half of the 8th-century CE. The revision involved the elimination of the unintelligible/confusing parts of the text were eliminated and the meaning of the text was clarified, but without being collated with a Greek manuscript. The Revised Aratus Latinus, apart from correcting and omitting parts of the old texts, also added extracts from Latin works. The text of the Revised Aratus Latinus itself included numerous excerpts from Isidore, Hyginus, Fulgentius Mythographus and others. To a large extent the inclusion of extracts replaced the 2nd part of the poem on weather signs that was initially translated in the Aratus Latinus. Phaenomena flourished into the Middle Ages where it continued and consolidated the "two-sphere" view of the universe that predominated throughout antiquity. (The earth is fixed at the centre of the universe and surrounded the cosmos (an enormous celestial sphere) which revolves around it.) No overall detailed study has yet been published on the transmission and reception of the Aratea in the Middle Ages (the role the text of the Aratea played in West European astronomical studies from the 8th-century to the 12th-century; how the entire number of texts that make up the Aratea was read, commented on and copied during this period).
The oldest extant manuscripts of the Phaenomena can be attributed to Theon of Alexandria. Later scribes of the classical period added commentary and illustrations, contributing to the continuation of the work's popularity in the Roman era. During the course of the Roman era there were numerous translations, adaptations, and imitations of the poem. The Phaenomena was translated into Latin by (for example) Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus and also adapted by its Roman translators. Extensive textual corruption of the text resulted in the 8th-century Aratus Latinus, a distorted and problematic manuscript that has posed a challenge to Aratean scholarship for more than a millennium. In the late 16th-century the Dutch scholar Grotius attempted to correct the text, and this process has continued to the present-day. Jean Martin's edition of the Greek text (2nd edition, 1998) is considered definitive. Douglas Kidd's 1997 translation and commentary of the Phaenomena is highly regarded by classical scholars. Both Martin and Kidd made use of new manuscript evidence in reconstructing Aratus' Phaenomena.
Ancient celestial globes were (usually) fitted with a meridian ring to enable them to be rotated around the polar axis in order to present the daily motion of the sky. By means of the meridian ring and an additional

horizontal ring they were supported on some form of frame. A celestial globe mounted in this way enabled the rising and setting of the constellations and stars to be to be determined. These celestial globes were an important feature of in schools teaching astronomy and in the practice of astrology.
Prior to the Greek system of naming and describing constellations the Babylonians gave single or short names (and descriptions) to the constellations they originated. The Babylonian scheme of constellations, excepting for the development of the zodiacal scheme of 12 constellations, was mostly finalised by the late 2nd-millennium BCE (i.e., near the end of the Cassite Period circa 1160 BCE). The only significant change that took place in the early 1st-millennium BCE was the development of the 12-constellation zodiacal scheme (and the shift from the scheme of the "three ways" to the ecliptic as the primary celestial reference point). The Babylonian names for the stars forming a constellation are descriptive phrases that serve to identify their location within the constellation figure. In a section of the Mul.Apin astronomical compendium, due to the use of the horizon as reference point for a list of simultaneous risings and settings of constellations, these particular constellations are approximately identifiable. The earlier Babylonian "star calendars" (commonly misnamed "Astrolabes") do not provide any suitable information to enable the identification of the constellations. This is simply because we do not have any information regarding the principles of their categorizations. Tablet 1 of the Assyrian Mul.Apin compendium (circa 1000 BCE) contains a qualitative description of constellations and the star positions comprising such. The incomplete Neo-Assyrian text (VAT 9428, circa 400 BCE) from Assur originally contained a complete qualitative star by star description of the Babylonian constellations.
The evidence indicates that most of the Greek constellations were introduced from the 6th-century BCE to the 4th-century BCE. It would be reasonably accurate to say that during this period - and even much later different Greek astronomers would change the constellation boundaries, if not the actual constellations. The constellation figures of the Greek sky, and most constellation boundaries, only became standardised after Aratus (i.e., with Ptolemy). It is known that some Greek constellation figures shared the same star (or even stars) within their respective boundaries. There are 3 illustrations for this: (1) Aratus included Serpens in Ophiuchus, and Lupus in Centaurus. Serpens was separated from Ophiuchus, and Lupus separated from Centaurus by Hipparchus/Ptolemy. Lupus is described by Eratosthenes as a "Wine-skin." Aratus separated the Pleiades from Taurus whereas Hipparchus made the Pleiades an asterism of Taurus. Aratus' description of of Perseus (specifically the left knee) is criticised by Hipparchus. (2) From Neugebauer's, A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy: "Ptolemy states that he had repeatedly changed the the boundaries of constellations and quotes some examples where he deviates from from Hipparchus. ... When Ptolemy says that he had redefined the association of many single stars with respect to the traditional constellation configurations he adds the remark that his predecessors did not act differently." (Part 1, Pages 286-287). See Part 1, Page 336 for differences between Aratus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy regarding Cassiopeia and Perseus; and Part 2, Page 1027 regarding the drastic regrouping of stars in Virgo by Ptolemy to that of Hipparchus. (3) Grasshoff in his The History of Ptolemy's Star Catalogue states (Page 40): "The decrease in the number of constellations in the course of the [Greek] development of the constellations can be deduced by comparing the number of stars in Ptolemy's constellations with [those in] the Hipparchian register. The oldest constellations, the zodiacal signs [constellations] have a disproportionately larger number of external stars, indicating that the area of the constellations was reduced in the course of time."
The final consolidation of the classical Greek star names and constellation figures was accomplished by the polymath Ptolemy circa 150 CE in his book The Great System of Astronomy. (Originally called the Syntaxis by Ptolemy and then called the Almagest by the later Arabic translators.) Ptolemy did not identify the stars in his catalogue with Greek letters, as is done by modern astronomers. Each of the 1025 stars listed was identified (1) descriptively by its position within one of the 48 constellation figures; then (2) by its ecliptic latitude and longitude; and then (3) its magnitude (using a Greek letter). (Stars that did not fit into the figure of a constellation were stated to be outside the constellation and their position described in terms of their relationship to the nearest constellated stars.) It is this particular star catalogue method of Ptolemy that enables us to identify, with considerable exactness, the boundaries (i.e., shape) of the ancient Greek constellations. The identities of some of the stars in Ptolemy's list still remain completely uncertain due to errors in Ptolemy's measured coordinates and lack of precision in described positions.
An additional source of star/constellation names originated with the groups of nomadic desert Arabs of the (pre-Islamic) Arabic Peninsula. However, according to Paul Kunitzsch, the influence of earlier Babylonian nomenclature are sometimes discernable in this body (older group) of (non-standardised) star/asterism

names. Paul Kunitzsch also holds that the main body (younger group) of indigenous (pre-Islamic) Arabic star/asterism names were probably formed in the period 500-700 CE.
Islamic star mapping mostly followed the Ptolemaic tradition. Ptolemy's star catalogue remained the standard star catalogue in both the Western and Islamic world for circa 1000 years. The dome of a bath house at Qusayr 'Amra, the only remaining building of an Arab palace in Jordan built circa CE 715, contains a unique hemispherical celestial map. The surviving fragments of the fresco show parts of 37 constellations and 400 stars. This celestial map furnishes a connecting link between the classical representations of the constellations and the later Islamic forms.
In pre-Islamic times the early Bedouin Arabic people (i.e., the nomadic desert dwelling tribes of the Arabic Peninsula) gave individual names to the numerous stars. (It is still erroneously believed that the folk tradition of Arabic star names was preserved as the lunar mansions. It was Julius Wellhausen (Reste Arabischen Heidentums (1897)) who correctly concluded that the concept of 28 "lunar mansions" was borrowed from the astronomy of the Hindus and merged with elements of Arab star lore after the introduction of Islam. Later Islamic scholars attached seasonal almanac lore onto this imported calendar system.) This particular practice has ultimately influenced the naming of individual stars in Western constellations. Whilst our inherited constellation names are basically Greek our European inherited star names are largely due to the influence of medieval (Arabic) Islamic astronomy on medieval European astronomy. The influence of Arabic names on Western star names dates from around the 10th-century AD when Arab astronomy flourished. (The Arabs (correctly Arab-Islamic astronomers) increased the number of individual star names. Most individual star names were introduced by al-Sufi when he published his own version of Ptolemy's Almagest in the 10century CE.) After the demise of the Roman Empire most Greek scientific works were translated into Arabic (including Ptolemy's Almagest). Eventually these texts were re-introduced back into Europe (and into Latin and Greek) through Arab Spain. With the Arabs the influence of the Greek language was not very strong in the names of stars and constellations. Modern star names are mostly derived from Arabic translations (or use) of Ptolemy's Almagest, chiefly Shiraz astronomer al-Sufi's 10th-century book Kitab suwar al-kawakib (Book of Constellation Figures), and also the introduction of hundreds of Arabic astrolabes into Europe. AlSufi's book Kitab suwar al-kawakib is our best authority for post-Islamic Arabic star-names and constellations. It also included the folk tradition of Arabic star names.
The Renaissance period was the catalyst for their being mixed together and passed down to present-day in Latin characters. The retransmitted Latin translation of Ptolemy's Almagest by Gherardo of Cremona (Lombardy) in the 12th-century was an Arabic-Latin version. This began the distorted use of Greek-ArabicLatin words that appear in modern lists of star names. It was the only version known in Western Europe until the later discovery of copies of the original Greek texts and their translation into Latin texts in the 15thcentury. Commonly used present-day individual star names include: Aldebaran, Algol, Altair, Antares, Arcturus, Betelgeuse, Canopus, Capella, Deneb, Fomalhaut, Mira, Pollux, Procyon, Regulus, Rigel, Sirius, Spica, and Vega.
Present-day Western star and constellation names originated from a number of Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. The cuneiform evidence recovered since the mid 1800s indicates that Greek uranography borrowed from the earlier Babylonian uranography, established circa late 2nd-millennium BCE. Some late Egyptian influence is also indicated. The Renaissance period saw the appearance of philological studies into the history of stellar nomenclature. The focus of these philological studies was the Arabic and Latin names of the medieval period but also included classical Greek and Roman names from a few recovered classical texts. During the Renaissance period (broadly the 200 years between 1400 and 1600), and also the post-Renaissance period (particularly the heyday of celestial mapping in the 17th- and 18thcenturies), European astronomers also searched through the philological studies for new individual star names to apply to the star charts and celestial globes they developed. One such philological work was A learned treatise of globes by the English scholar John Chilmead (Latin edition 1594; English translation 1638). Wilhelm Schickard, the astronomer and professor of Oriental languages at Tübingen, supplied the Arabic letters and star and constellation names for Coelum stellatum Christianum by Julius Schiller (1627). Julius Schiller's Christianised star atlas was a part of the Counter-Reformation attempt to de-paganise the heavens and substitute Judeo-Christian imagery.
The Italian Theatine monk, mathematician, and astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi (1746-1826) introduced nearly 100 new star names (mostly "Arabic") in his Palermo Catalogue published in 1814 (his 2nd star catalogue).

https://web.archive.org/web/20181112212723/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-13.html 11/24
These star names were derived by Giuseppe Piazzi from the philological study Tabulae longitudinum et latitudinum stellarum fixarum ex observatione principis Ulugh Beighi (1665) by the English Orientalist Thomas Hyde (1636-1703). The German historian, chronologist, and astronomer Ludewig Ideler (17661846) made an important and long-standing (but flawed) contribution to the philological study and historical explanation of Arabic star names. His Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen (1809) was used as a basic reference source for over 150 years. The basis of the book was Ideler's translation of the astronomical section of Zakariya' al-Qazwini's popular 13th-century cosmography, 'Aja'ib al-Makhluqat (The Wonders of Creation), supplemented with Ideler's additions and annotations from classical and other sources. Unfortunately, Ideler did not have access to al-Sufi's 10th-century book on the fixed stars (Kitab suwar al-kawakib (Book of Constellation Figures)). Due to the author's additional use of numerous unreliable and mostly secondary Arabic sources the book unavoidably contains numerous errors.
The constellation scheme established in Ptolemy's Almagest remained virtually unchanged until the European era of celestial mapping in the 17th- and 18th-centuries. During this period astronomers added their own constellation inventions to the remaining gaps left in the sky. There was no agreed standardised set of constellations. (One celestial atlas had 99 constellations.) Constellation schemes and boundaries remained unregulated until the early 20th-century. (Generally, celestial atlases in the early 20th-century varied between 80 and 90 constellations. Constellation boundaries also varied from atlas to atlas.) Until the 1920s astronomers used irregular curved boundaries (wavy-line boundaries) to demarcate the constellation areas. The issue of (1) the number of constellations, and (2) their boundaries, was taken up by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1922. (The IAU was founded founded as a professional body for astronomers. Its purpose is to promote and safeguard standards in astronomy through international cooperation.) In 1922, at its first General Assembly, the newly formed International Astronomical Union (established 1919) officially adopted and regularised 88 official constellations (or at least took up the issue), and in 1928(9?) defined their boundaries. Acting at the request of the International Astronomical Union the Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte (1882-1955) then proceeded to draw up the definitive modern boundaries for these 88 constellations. His work on the demarcation of the constellations was published in his book Délimitation scientifique des constellations, cartes (1930). The boundaries between the constellations were fixed along lines of right ascension and declination for the epoch 1875. Basically the constellation boundaries became rectangular borders. This made the use of traditional constellation figures obsolete. A transition to non-pictorial star maps had taken place with the 1928(9?) IAU decision on constellation boundaries. Constellations are now precisely defined areas of the sky and not regarded as star patterns. Constellations are now defined by their boundary lines (rectangular borders), not by their historic figures. This ensured that constellations now completely cover the sky and all stars lie within the boundary of a constellation. Enclosed within modern constellation boundaries are both the stars in the traditional constellation figures and the neighbouring stars outside the figures. The 88 official constellations selected by the International Astronomical Union were all of European origin simply because the wide use of these constellations was already well established.
Appendix 1: Naming Stars and Naming Constellations
Naming constellations was what really mattered in the Western tradition. A few stars were individually named in Egypt (i.e., Sirius was named Sopdet circa 3500 BCE) and in Mesopotamia (i.e., Sirius was named KAK.SI.DI (Bowstar) circa 1200 BCE). The practice of giving individual names to numerous stars only really began with early (pre-Islamic) Arab astronomy (Arabian Peninsula) and medieval Arab-Islamic astronomy.
A lot of star names that remain in present-day use can most often be traced directly or indirectly to Al-Sufi's Book of the Fixed Stars. A lot of the star names are simply translations of the stars' descriptions in Ptolemy's Almagest. Thus, Ptolemy's descriptor "star in the tail of the lion" becomes Denab (tail) al-Asad (of the Lion), later corrupted to Denebola.
Appendix 2: The Importance of Eudoxus to the Greek Scheme of Constellations
Eudoxus of Cnidus (life dates variously given as circa 408/400/390-circa 355/350/340 BCE) was a prominent Ionian Greek mathematician and astronomer. All the works of Eudoxus, have been lost, only fragments remain. See: Die Fragmente des Eudoxus von Knidos by François Lasserre (1966). According to one version, Eudoxus was taught astronomy by Archytas (Architus) of Tarentum (in Magna Graecia, an area

of southern Italy which was under Greek control in the 5th-century BCE). According to another version, Eudoxus studied geometry under Archytas of Tarentum (a Greek Pythagorean mathematician without independent achievements in astronomy), a Pythagorean. Archytas (428-347 BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, statesman, and strategist. He was a scientist of the Pythagorean school and famous for being the reputed founder of mathematical mechanics, as well as a good friend of Plato. He spent most of his life residing in Italy. Practically nothing is known of Archytas' astronomy. However, it is quite clear that Archytas' astronomy does deal with the visible heavens, with the risings and settings of the stars and planets.
There is a case for Babylonian astronomy being introduced to the Greeks through Philip of Opus and Eudoxus of Knidos. (Philip (or Philippus) of Opus (Opous), was a Greek philosopher and a member of Plato's Academy during Plato's lifetime. Philip of Opus is probably identical with the Philip of Medma (or Mende) the astronomer, who is also described as a disciple of Plato.) Eudoxus of Cnidus had an astronomy school at Cyzicus. He was a contemporary of Plato. Eudoxus was the most significant geometer in the preEuclidian period. His 4th-century BCE geographical treatise, the Gēs periodos ('Circuit of the Earth'), systematically described the lands and people of the known world, from Asia in the east to the western Mediterranean. Eudoxus produced works of a descriptive and empirical type in astronomy and geography. His astronomical works are thought to have included observations of the stars - a systematic almanac of celestial events. Eudoxus eventually built an observatory on Cnidus (not much higher than the dwellinghouses) and from there he observed the star Canopus, the lowest visible bright star in Cnidus ( Strabo (65 BCE-23 CE, Greek geographer and historian, Geography, Book 2). Eudoxus was the founder of the first known observatory. (At the time of Eudoxus, Cnidus was locate at 36° 41' north (the city having moved from an earlier site in 390 BCE. The declination of Canopus at this epoch was -52.839, giving a true altitude at transit of 0.478 degrees, which is refracted to 0.904 degrees. Canopus would be visible at any extinction coefficient < 0.2 magnitude per air mass.) According to an anonymous Greek commentator of Aratus it was Eudoxus who brought Assyrian uranography to the Greeks. In his works Eudoxus gave descriptions of a large number of constellations known in Mesopotamia. Eudoxus continued the Mesopotamian traditions of constellations in the Mul.Apin series. The detailed description by Eudoxus of the constellations - especially the use of the 12 zodiacal constellations - depended in part on Babylonian traditions. Eudoxus was a parapegmatist. Eudoxus produced a pioneering work known as the Phaenomena, in which he described a calendar with references to the risings and settings of constellations. The popular astronomy of the type found in parapegma, based ultimately on Mul.Apin type models, circulated outside Mesopotamia throughout the Mediterranean basin between circa 500 BCE and 500 CE. It is reasonably indicated that the Ionian Greeks obtained detailed knowledge of the Mesopotamian constellations in the century or so preceding Eudoxus. Walter Burkert (Weisheit und Wissenschaft (1962, Pages 289-296)) believed he had found evidence for renewed contacts with the East in certain features of Greek astronomy in the period following circa 440 BCE but his evidence is debatable. Circa the 5th-century BCE saw the beginning of mathematical astronomy in Greece. Also, Greek astronomy of the 5th-century BCE, like that of the astronomy of the Near East, was intertwined with the study of meteorological phenomena generally (i.e., with clouds, winds, thunder and lightning, meteors (shooting stars), the rainbow and such). Evidence for direct constellation borrowing by the Greeks from Mesopotamia is almost non-existent. During the Hellenistic period it is possible that Berossus and some Chaldaean contemporaries made the Babylonian sphaera familiar to the Greeks. It is possible that Babylonian uranography was passed to the Greeks through particular intermediaries such as the Phoenicians and Egyptians. There were likely "competitive" schemes of Greek sphaera until the wide adoption of the sphaera developed by the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnido and diffused through his written works on the constellations (4th-century BCE). The ultimate success of the Sphaera Graecanica as we have it today (i.e., its complete acceptance by the Greek world and later the Roman world) was largely due to the work of the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th-century BCE) and the Greek poet Aratus of Soli (3rd-century BCE). Eudoxus constellated and catalogued the entire Greek sky in his works Enoptron and Phaenomena. Aratus later turned these works into an astronomical poem concerning the constellations. The Phaenomena became hugely popular in the Graeco-Roman world. Without this popularisation by Aratus the works of Eudoxus may never have exerted the lasting influence they achieved.
Eudoxus was likely the first Greek to summarise the Greek system of constellations. Circa 360 BCE it appears that the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus extended and consolidated the previously unorganised use of constellations in Greece into a set that covered the whole of the sky visible in Greece. (Prior to Eudoxus the works of the Greek astronomers usually only contained limited details regarding the constellations, and a few ideas about the risings and settings of stars/constellations.) Eventually

- with some minor changes and additions in later periods - the star group system of Eudoxus became canonical. It is likely that it was Eudoxus who included some previously named asterisms/constellations such as the Pleiades and the Hyades in larger constellations. Although nothing by Eudoxus has survived much of his work can be understood in Aratus' Phenomena and Hipparchus' Commentary. It is clear that the constellations of Eudoxus were thought of as the outlines of actual figures in the sky and not simply as star groups. Eudoxus carried out the first systematic constellating of the Greek sky. He also the first systematic consolidation of and description of the constellations of the Greeks. The constellations he used in his uranography were a mix of Mesopotamian constellations current at that time mixed with constellations in use by or established by the Greeks at the period (late Greek Archaic Period/early Greek Classical period). Eudoxus may have been the first Greek to employ Babylonian zodiacal signs each equal to one twelfth of the ecliptic circle. It appears that Eudoxus was aware of the Babylonian division of the ecliptic into 12 equal parts. (Plato may not have been aware of the Babylonian division of the ecliptic into 12 equal parts.) The classicist and philologist François Lasserre (Die Fragmente des Eudoxus von Knidos (F. 2., 1966, Page 39)) refers to an anonymous commentator on Aratus claiming that Eudoxus brought "the Assyrian sphere" to Greece.
The Greeks had begun the process of naming constellations before the time of Eudoxus but Eudoxus undertook to comprehensively describe the entire visible night sky. The first comprehensive Greek star map was established by Eudoxus. The principal astronomical accomplishment of Eudoxus appears to have been the development of a descriptive map of the visible night sky - he composed a detailed description of the constellations. The Western tradition of describing stars by their positions within constellation figures may have begun with Eudoxus of Cnidus (circa 408-circa 355 BCE). The observations made at his observatory in Cnidus, as well as those made at the observatory near Heliopolis, formed the basis of 2 books referred to by Hipparchus. These 2 (almost identical) prose works (both 4th-century BCE) were the Enoptron ('Mirror') and the Phaenomena ('Appearances'), the latter being thought by some scholars to be a revision of Enoptron. Hipparchus in his extensive Commentary (exegesis) states us that the works concerned the rising and setting of the constellations. The object of Eudoxus may have been to develop a practical manual for finding the time (hour) of night.
Actual descriptions of constellations in Greece existed as early as Eudoxus, circa early 4th-century BCE. The Greek astronomer Eudoxus, circa 375 BCE (/360 BCE), is considered to have constructed the first star chart (= appears to have been the first person to develop a standardised map of the Greek constellations). (Eudoxus is also considered to be the 'father' of Greek scientific astronomical observations.) He named a number of conspicuous stars and compared their brightness. A complete set of Greek constellations appears to have been first described by Eudoxus in 2 works called the Enoptron and the Phaenomena (both of which are no longer extant). Phaenomena was likely a revision and expansion of Enoptron. (Eudoxus appears to have been the first Greek person to have comprehensively arranged and described (i.e., summarised/consolidated) the Greek system of constellations (Greek constellation set).) Our information is obtained from secondary sources as his work is has not come down to us. The early method of the Greek astronomer Eudoxus for determining the places of the stars was to divide the stars into named constellations and define the constellations partly by their juxtaposition, partly by their relation to the zodiac, and also by their relation to the tropical and arctic circles. The complete (and standardised) constellating of the Greek sky (with 48 constellations) was possibly first achieved by Eudoxus in his work Phaenomena. The versification of his uranography in Aratus Phainomena indicates that the astronomic work of Eudoxus was accepted as authoritative. Aratus' Phaenomena was a practical manual in verse to teach the reader how to identify constellations and predict weather. It was one of the most popular literary works of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It is the starting point for all studies of Greek constellations and star lore. It contains an occasional reference to a myth associated with a particular constellation. With only a few exceptions no actual stars are described by Aratus - only constellation figures. This method was undoubtedly inherited from Eudoxus who produced a set of descriptions of constellations in which the relative positions of stars in each of the constellations was described. Unlike later Greek astronomers (and modern astronomers), Eudoxus did not deal with the stars singly, and define their places by celestial measurement (i.e., he did not define their right ascension and declination, nor their latitude and longitude). Eudoxus instead gave a sort of geographical description of the territorial location (position and limits) of stars using a system of constellations distinguished by unique names. The method used by Eudoxus for determining the places of stars was to distribute named constellations over the entire visible night sky and then define stars partly by their juxtaposition, and partly by their relation to the zodiac, and to the tropical and arctic circles. The complete (and standardised) constellating of the Greek sky (with 48 constellations) was possibly first achieved by



2022. 02. 21. 19:57 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20181112212723/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-13.html 14/24
Eudoxus in his work Phaenomena. It is, however, the oldest known complete description of the celestial sphere. Circa 270 BCE the Stoic poet Aratus paraphrased the description of the constellations composed by Eudoxus. The paraphrase by Aratus follows the geographical method of Eudoxus and describes only the positions of the constellations and the principal stars in them relative to each other. There is no mention made of the longitudes or latitudes, the right ascensions or declinations of the stars singly. The only circles of the celestial sphere mentioned are the tropics, the equator, the ecliptic (and the Galaxy as if it were a circle of the sphere).
There is no realistic evidence that an Aratean scheme of constellations existed earlier than the time of Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th-century BCE). To argue that the evidence is now lost or not yet recovered is to sidestep the particular difficulty with speculation. The ancient Greek world was composed of numerous citystates. There were also different schools of Greek astronomy. However, from circa 350 BCE, due to the efforts of Eudoxus of Cnidus, a unique system of constellations was consolidated in the Greek world.
It appears that Eudoxus did not mention the planets. They are not mentioned by Hipparchus in his Commentary and only barely mentioned by Aratus in his Phainomena. This indicates they were only briefly mentioned by Eudoxus in his Enoptron and Phainomena. However, Eudoxus is also linked to the theoretical model of rotating celestial spheres centred on the Earth that were to explain the motion of the planets.
There is reason to believe that during the lifetime of Eudoxus representations of the night sky on a plane surface was in use. The evidence is that in the description of some of the northern constellations a misplacement occurs which Attalus explained had arisen from the circumstance that the figures constellation figures are drawn as seen from a point on the exterior of the sphere; and Hipparchus, in his remarks concerning the passage, asserting the mistake, states that the constellation figures are drawn just as we see them, meaning that they are drawn as seen by an observer placed at the centre of the sphere. Attalus of Rhodes (flourished 2nd-century BCE) was a Greek grammarian, astronomer, and mathematician, and was a contemporary of Hipparchus. Attalus wrote a commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus. Attalus sought to defend both Aratus and Eudoxus against criticisms from contemporary astronomers and mathematicians. Although this work has not come down to us Hipparchus cites him in his Commentary on the Phaenomena of Eudoxus and Aratus.
Though there is really no positive statement for such in ancient literature it is thought that Eudoxus likely constructed a celestial globe. Allusions to the existence of celestial globes date to the Greek scientists Eudoxus of Cnidos (circa 409-356 BCE) and Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287-212 BCE). Cicero recorded the tradition that Eudoxus had constructed a star globe that accurately depicted the constellations. (It is thought that Eudoxus was the first Greek to make a comprehensive star map and place it on a globe.) Likely the constellations were represented/depicted by the characters and animals representing them. The early Greek astronomers and philosophers constructed 3-dimensional models; brightly coloured celestial globes, and mechanical representations of the workings of the moving sky. Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE) also constructed a mechanical planetarium of the known celestial system (which was later much admired by educated Romans). It appears that Eudoxus of Cnidus was the first to draw the constellations on a globe representing the sky seen from the outside looking inwards, rather than as seen by an observer on the earth looking outwards (together with the main celestial circles).
Appendix 3: Aratus' Phainomena
Ancient Greek and Latin astronomical poems were highly influential in establishing celestial cartography in the ancient and medieval period in Western Europe.
Aratus of Soli was a Greek didactic poet who flourished in Macedonia in the early 3rd-century BCE (circa 315 BCE/310 BCE–240 BCE). Several accounts of his life are extant, by anonymous Greek writers. His only surviving work is his hexameter poem Phainomena (Phaenomena) ("Visible appearances") a book describing the constellations, some other celestial phenomena, and weather signs. The Phainomena of Aratus, probably composed in the period circa 280-260 BCE is an account in 1154 hexameters of: (1) the fixed constellations and their conjunctions, and (2) of weather-signs associated with both heavenly bodies and other natural phenomena. The opening of the poem asserts the dependence of all things upon Zeus. It has been stated that in form the Phainomena belongs to the Alexandrian school.



2022. 02. 21. 19:57 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20181112212723/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-13.html 15/24
It has usually been thought that the purpose of the Phainomena is to give an introduction to the constellations, with the rules for their risings and settings; and of the circles of the sphere, amongst which the Milky Way is also included. The positions of the constellations, north of the ecliptic, are described by reference to the principal groups surrounding the north pole (Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, and Cepheus), whilst Orion serves as a point of departure for describing the constellation to the south. The immobility of the earth, and the revolution of the sky about a fixed axis are maintained; the path of the sun in the zodiac is described; but the planets are introduced merely as bodies having a motion of their own, without any attempt to define their periods. Nothing is said about the moon's orbit.
A more recent assessment of Aratus' Phainomena is somewhat different. The Phaenomena is an astronomical calendar based on the stars. The Phaenomena has usually been considered to be primarily an astronomical work oriented toward the identification of major constellations and the exposition of related myths and stories. A 2nd part of the Phaenomena, called the Diosemeia ("Weather-Signs"), gives attention to ancient principles of meteorological forecasting. Aratus provides an explanation of celestial order; a celestial (star) calendar, and also an explanation of the type of meteorological phenomena that accompany the movement of the constellations. The 2nd half of Phaenomena (the Diosemeia, the "Signs of Zeus") explains what constellation signs bring what type of weather, at which times of year, and what agricultural and nautical activities accompany them. The planets were passed over briefly and left unnamed because they did not serve any purpose as practical celestial signs for agriculture and navigation. (In the proem the constellations are signs provided by the benevolent Zeus. The poem is about reading signs and the knowledge that they provide. The intention of Aratus was not not primarily to write an astronomical didactic poem, but rather to draw attention to the perceivable constellation signs in nature, which Zeus has benignly given to humankind. The closing section, ends with a concluding remark (Aratus: Phaenomena by Douglas Kidd, 1997, Page 157): "If you have watched for these [constellation] signs all together for the year, you will never make an uninformed judgment on the evidence of the sky." Eudoxus was a parapegmatist, and likewise Aratus. Aratus was a star calendar poet, an agricultural parapegmatist.
Aratus' Phainomena draws extensively upon two prose sources which modern scholars can reconstruct with some confidence. For the constellations Aratus was very heavily indebted to the prose Phainomena of the pioneering Greek astronomer Eudoxus, written perhaps as much as a century before Aratus' poem. The relationship of Aratus' work to that of Eudoxus has been a matter of discussion since antiquity. The 2ndcentury BCE Greek astronomer Hipparchus emphasised Aratus' debt in his extant commentary (exégesis) on the works of Eudoxus and Aratus which preserves many fragments of the former's treatise. It is generally accepted that the 1st half of Aratus' Phainomena is a verse setting of a lost work of the same name by the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus. In composing his astronomical poem Phainomena, Aratus utilised an earlier prose work (4th-century BCE) on the constellations by the astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidos, known also as the Phainomena. It contained detailed information about the constellations and may have been one of the earliest works establishing a Greek constellation set. In his Phainomena Eudoxus provided calendaric notices of the risings and settings of stars. Eudoxus' Phainomena provided the basis for the 1st part of Aratus' poem. (The Phainomena appears to be based on two prose works - Phainomena and Enoptron ("Mirror", presumably a descriptive image of the heavens) - by Eudoxus of Cnidus, written about a century earlier. We are told by the biographers of Aratus that it was the desire of Antigonus to have them turned into verse, which gave rise to the Phainomena of Aratus; and it appears from the fragments of them preserved by Hipparchus, that Aratus has in fact versified, or closely imitated parts of them both, but especially of the first.) However, some modern scholars have suggested that Aratus' poem differed in numerous ways from the prose of Eudoxus. There is also reason to believe that Hesiod's Works and Days was the model used for Aratus' Phainomena.
The poem can be divided/separated into 3 parts, the most important being his poetical description of the constellations, which forms the 1st part; followed by a discussion of the rising and setting of the constellations forming the 2nd part. (Lines 1-757 are believed to versify an earlier prose work on astronomy by Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th-century BCE).) The 3rd part (lines 758-1154) is called the Diosemeia ("Forecasts"), and is mostly about weather lore. The 3rd part of Aratus' poem concerned with weather signs may have been derived from the work, On Weather Signs by Theophrastus (but also identified as by modern scholars as the Pseudo-Theophrastus). Possibly Eudoxus may have made extensive use of On Weather Signs. When this part of Aratus' Phainomena was first given the separate title 'Signs' is unclear. The Diosemeia consists of forecasts of the weather from astronomical phenomena, with an account of its effects upon animals. It appears to be an imitation of Hesiod, and to have been imitated by Virgil in some parts of the

Georgics. The materials are stated to have been taken almost wholly from Aristotle's Meteorologica, from the work of Theophratus, On Weather Signs, and from Hesiod. No mention of Hellenistic astrology is made in either of these poems.
Aaron Poochigian divides the poem into 2 parts. "The Phaenomena is divided into two parts. The first part (1-783), an adaptation of a mostly lost prose treatise by Eudoxus of Cnidus, instructs the reader in the constellations of the northern and southern skies and their risings and settings. The second part (784-1189), sometimes referred to separately as the Diosemeia (Weather Signs), largely concerns the signs (mostly stellar phenomena) by which the weather can be predicted. It draws primarily from a work on weather signs referred to as De Signis (Concerning Weather Signs) and attributed to Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus." (Aratus: Phaenomena by Aaron Poochigian (2010, Page xi.)
Aratus related the constellations to the seasons. However, Aratus (Phaenomena, lines 513-514) was not very interested in the seasons and when they began and ended. "On it [the imaginary line of the celestial equator, bisecting the imaginary line of the ecliptic] the days are equal to the nights on two occasions, at the waning of summer and again at the beginning of spring." (Aratus Phaenomena edited with introduction, translation and commentary by Douglas Kidd, 1997, Page 111.) The 'Diosemeiai' (the practical use of the constellations as weather signs), the 2nd main section of the Phaenomena has its own proem (introductory passage) (see lines 733-777). In the 'Diosemeiai' (depending on how the poem is divided), Aratus states that the moon tells what day of the (lunar) month it is (line 739, but see also lines 733-739), and the 12 signs of the zodiac are useful for telling the hours of the night, and also the phases of the seasonal year (lines 740-743, but also see through to line 751).
It has also been concluded that Aratus did not target his poem towards readers with extensive knowledge or experience of astronomy or the practical uses of astronomy. The astronomical information contained in Aratus' Phainomena was not always correct. The lack of precision in the constellation descriptions indicate that Aratus was neither a mathematician nor observer or, at any rate, that in his Phainomena he did not aim at scientific accuracy. He not only represents the configurations of particular groups incorrectly, but describes some phenomena which are inconsistent with any one supposed latitude of the observer, and others which could not coexist at any one epoch. These errors are perhaps partly to be attributed to Eudoxus himself, and partly to the way in which Aratus has used the materials by Eudoxus. Hipparchus (about a century later), who was a scientific astronomer and observer, left a commentary upon the Phainomena of Eudoxus and Aratus, accompanied by the discrepancies which he had noticed between his own observations and their descriptions.
However, the main appeal of Aratus' Phainomena may well have been its literary charm and also its numerous mythological allusions. Aratus enjoyed immense prestige among Hellenistic poets, including Theocritus, Callimachus and Leonidas of Tarentum. This assessment was picked up by Latin poets, including Ovid and Virgil.
According to Acts (chapter)17:(verse)28, one verse from the proem to Phainomena, the opening invocation to Zeus, was quoted by the apostle Paul when promoting Christianity in Athens. The Acts of the Apostles, commonly referred to simply as Acts, is the 5th book of the New Testament. Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a 2-part work, Luke-Acts, by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80–90 CE. Paul quotes the Phaenomena of Aratus to prove to the Athenians that their religion is equivalent to idolatry. Paul seeks to enhance his argument by citing an authority that the Athenians would respect.
Aratus' Phainomena consolidated the "two-sphere" view of the universe that predominated throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages. (The "two-sphere" universe = the earth is fixed at the centre of the universe and surrounded the cosmos (an enormous celestial sphere) which revolves around it.)
Aratus authored other poems but his Phainomena is his only extant work. Several poetical works on various subjects, as well as a number of prose epistles, are attributed to Aratus, but none of them have come down to us, except his 2 astronomical poems in hexameter. These have generally been joined together as if parts of the same work; but they seem to be distinct poems, the 1st, called Phainomena ("Visible appearances"), consists of 732 verses; the 2nd, Diosemeia ("On Weather Signs"), of 422 verses. In antiquity at least 27 separate commentaries were known to have been written of the Phainomena by Aratus. The ones by Theon of Alexandria, Archilles Tatius, and Hipparchus of Nicea survive. Several Roman writers translated it into

Latin, including Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE), the author presumed to be Iulius Caesar Germanicus (15 or 16 BCE-19 CE), and Postumius Rufius Festus Avienus (flourished mid 4th-century CE). (The complete Latin translations of Germanicus, and Avienus have survived. Only fragments of Cicero's Latin translation survive.) The popularity of the Phainomena in the ancient world was both widespread and enduring. After the epic Homeric poems Iliad and Odyssey it was the most widely read poem. Aratus' Phainomena was also one of the very few Greek poems translated into Arabic. An Arabic translation was
commissioned in the 9th-century CE by the Caliph Al Ma'mun.
The archaic Greek zodiac of the Aratean-Eratosthenic period was comprised of 11 figures positioned along the ecliptic. The 12 constellation zodiac of the Greek-Roman world originated in the 1st-century CE with the introduction of the Libra (in place of the Claws of the Scorpion). The different versions survive in a number of different celestial maps (likely produced to support to the comprehension of the first part of the Phaenomena) depicting either the Greek Aratean tradition or the later Latin Aratean tradition.
See: Taub, Liba. (2010). "Translating the Phainomena across genre, language and culture." In: Imhausen, Annette. and Pommerening, Tanja. (Editors). Writings of Early Scholars in the Ancient Near East, Egypt, and Greece. (Pages 119-138).
Appendix 4: Astronomical Information in Aratus' Phainomena
By the early 4th-century BCE the basic theory of the celestial sphere (i.e., ecliptic (and zodiac), equator, tropics, arctic circle, horizon, wandering stars (= planets), and the Milky Way) had been established by the Greeks. The incorporation of technical and/or scientific information into (ostensibly) didactic poetry was a mark of the Hellenistic period (323-30 BCE), especially in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Examples, in addition to Aratus' Phainomena include: Theriaca (about poisonous animals and insects) and Alexipharmaca (about antidotes) by Nicander of Colophon (2nd-century BCE), a Greek poet, physician and grammarian. However, the literary dimensions/intent of these poems (and their Latin generic descendents) are not to be overlooked when investigating them for information. The technical/scientific information is often subservient to the literary purposes for which that information is used.
The astronomical sense of phainomai = "things that are seen/appear in the heavens." An early division was introduced between the astronomical part (referred to as Phaenomena, comprising the first 757 verses) and the later weather/meteorological lore part (referred to as Diosemeia ("Forecasts"), comprising the later 383 verses). Lines 19-758 are theoretical; lines 758-1141 are practical. A very detailed structural outline (12.5 pages) of Phainomena appears in, Sky-Signs: Aratus' Phaenomena. Introduction and Translation by Stanley Lombardo (no date, but 1983).
Aratus' poem can be organized into 5 sections: the proem (lines 1-18); the constellations in the northern and southern hemispheres (lines 19-461); the description of the 5 celestial circles and intercepting constellations (lines 462-558); simultaneous risings and settings (the measurement of time) (lines 559-732) (lines 559-732 of the Phaenomena are an exposition of parapegmata); the phases of the moon (the measurement of time) (lines 733-757) (lines 462-757 are an exposition of the principles of astronomical chronology); meteorological phenomena (weather signs, list of atmospheric and terrestrial phenomena) (lines 758-1141); and conclusion (closing section) (lines 1142-1154). The multiple but uneven translations of Aratus' Phainomena shows the direct astronomical information in the poem includes:
(1) The names and related positions of 46 constellations, beginning at the north celestial pole.
(2) The design of the heavens by means of the the polar axis, the 4 celestial circles (the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn defined, the ecliptic, the celestial equator), and these related to the Milky Way. (Aratus' description of the Milky Way, lines 469-479.)
(3) The demarcation/separation of the constellations in the northern celestial hemisphere from the constellations in the southern celestial hemisphere.
(4) The names of the Signs of the Zodiac, beginning with the Crab through to the Twins, and the explanation that the sun moves around this circle.

Aratus omits any mention of astrology. Interestingly, Eudoxus was known in antiquity for his rejection of astrology.
Not included or lacking in the original Greek poem and/or in Latin translations are discussions of:
(1) The particular (individual) stars that make up the constellations. (Even at this period very few stars were named.)
(2) The number or position of the stars within each constellation. (Added later through the scholia.)
(3) There is only minimal mention of the planets. (No specific information concerning their order, movements, names, or traditional attributes. The "stars" that are the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have no use for Aratus because their movements are erratic. It has been commented that Aratus refrains from giving an explanation of the planetary movements (lines 454–461), apparently because of their complicated nature and the difficulty of calculating their conjunction (an allusion to the Great Year concept of the Stoics).)
(4) There is no information on transitory events. (Such things as comets, solar and lunar eclipses, hours of daylight, are ignored.)
(5) There is no mention of the moon's orbit.
The interest of Aratus' Phainomena is the perfection of the celestial realm.
Note: Firm evidence of a 360 degree zodiac in Greece comes only from the 2nd-century BCE with Hypsicles (a Greek astronomer of Alexandria, circa 190-120 BCE) and Hipparchus. The zodiac became one of the fundamental tools of Greek astronomy and astrology.
Appendix 5: Hipparchus and His Critique of Aratus
In his Commentary Hipparchus was motivated to refute some of the assertions of 2 earlier writers, Aratus of Soli (310-245 BCE) and Eudoxus of Cnidos (circa 408-355 BCE).
(1)
Conference, Harvard University, 9-10 April, 2010, Pros and Cons: Professionalism and Expertise in the Ancient World. Abstract of paper presented by Caroline B. Bishop: "Astronomical Errors: Hipparchus, Aratus, and the Rise of Professional Astronomy.":
"In this paper I examine how Hipparchus of Nicaea (fl[ourished]. 147-127 [BCE]) created and maintained a stable professional identity for astronomy. Hipparchus has long been known in the scientific world as the father of astronomy; though this honorific owes in large part to his monumental advances in the discipline, I argue that at least some of the credit is due to the strategies of self-fashioning found in his only surviving work, the Commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus. That he was successful in creating a model for the field, and in placing himself at its apogee, is evident: though he was nowhere near the first professional astronomer, his is the earliest astronomical treatise that survives.
Faced with shaping a nascent discipline and correcting cosmological fiction masquerading as fact, Hipparchus finds it easiest to define astronomy by what it is not: two-thirds of his commentary is given over to pointing out the errors of earlier practitioners of the science. His tone is brusque and often highly polemical, and he does not shrink from criticizing fellow professional astronomers such as Eudoxus and Attalus.
But Hipparchus is also in the unique position of having to take on a poet. By his time, Aratus' poem had achieved great popularity, and Hipparchus was clearly concerned that many received their sole astronomical knowledge from it. He offers a careful catalogue of Aratus' mistakes and denounces the illusory authority that dactylic hexameter lends an author. If Aratus' Phaenomena had been in prose, Hipparchus argues, no one would have accepted a text so full of errors. It is with this argument, I contend, that Hipparchus makes his most important contribution to his field. His critique of his professional predecessors may have solidified his

position as an astronomer, but it was his passionate defense of professional expertise over poetic authority that secured the status of astronomy."
The point has been made that Hipparchus' criticisms of Aratus' precision in his Commentary eventually becomes fused, in the Roman period, with the tradition of the Phaenomena. Hipparchus' criticism of Aratus' precision was seen as demonstrating the problem with using poetry to convey technical knowledge. The unexpected effect of Hipparchus' Commentary was to update Aratus' poem, and enhance its relevance. It is indicated that in the Roman period of the 1st-century CE Hipparchus and Aratus were read together as a unit of astronomical authority.
(2)
Prose star catalogues were later created by Hipparchus of Rhodes 2nd-century BCE), Geminus of Rhodes (flourished 1st-century BCE), and Martianus Capella (flourished early 5th-century CE).
Hipparchus' Commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus (which survives fully intact, the only ancient commentary to do so) takes the form of a continuous prose treatise. In it he catalogues the errors of Aratus' Phaenomena. In books 2 and 3 of the Commentary all mention of Aratus of Soli, Eudoxus of Cnidus, and Attalus of Rhodes are dropped and Hipparchus introduces his own observations/discoveries in catalogue form. According to Jessica Lightfoot, Hippachus is seeking to establish his Commentary as the most authoritative astronomical text. According to Caroline Bishop, choosing the commentary form to publish original research was not unusual in antiquity.
Note: Prose is the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without metrical structure, as distinguished from poetry or verse. Poetry is a literary work in metrical form.
See the excellent article: Hipparchus' Didactic Journey: Poetry, Prose and Catalogue Form in the Commentary on Aratus and Eudoxus by Jessica Lightfoot (Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies, Volume 57, Number 4, 2017, Pages 935-967).
Appendix 6: A Misunderstanding in the Translation of Avenius' Phaenomena of Aratus
The Latin writer Rufus Festus Avienus (also, Anienus) (4th-century CE), translated Aratus’ Phaenomena into Latin Verse. At the very beginning of the 17th-century (1600) the teenage Dutch scholar (later humanist, philosopher, legal scholar, and jurist, and also a statesman and diplomat) Hugo Grotius (also, Hugo, Huigh or Hugeianus de Groot) (1583-1645), who had been a student of the philologist, historian, and chronologist Joseph Scaliger at Leiden University, produced an edition of Aratea of Aratus, Cicero, and Germanicus, titled, Syntagma Arateorum ('A collection of Arateas'). Grotius was 17 years old when he published the Syntagma Arateorum. Grotius was a child prodigy and entered Leiden University at age 11.
Because Cicero's Aratea only survived in a fragmentary condition (the text is incomplete as example: Harley 647 in the British Museum), Grotius provided the missing parts from Cicero's Aratea by translating the equivalent Greek from Aratus' Phaenomena, and writing the translation in Ciceronian verse. Groteius's added lines of translation from Aratus' Phaenomena into Latin were printed in italics.
Jean Soubiran' interpretation (Aviénus, Les phénomènes d'Aratos, edited by Jean Soubiran (1981) of the Cicero MS. reading 'nubila' at verse/line 469 (of Cicero) - as against Grotius's emendation 'vincula' - is accepted. Soubiran's corrected reading was first published in: Jean Soubiran, "Une mention antique de la nébuleuse d'Andromède (Aviénus, Arat., 469)." in Revue de philologie, de littérature et d'histoire anciennes, Volume 51, 1977, Pages 207-216). Soubiran (1932-?) is/was a French Latinist (Professeur à l'Université de Toulouse Le Mirail, Centre de sciences anciennes).
The manuscripts of Avienus read 'nubila' ('clouds') at line 469, referring, it is thought, to the chains of Andromeda. Grotius did not understand the sense of this and proposed to 'emend' the text into 'vincula' ('chains'), likely thinking that verse/line 469 had been corrupted during the course of copying the text by hand during the Middle Ages. Grotius' unattested modern alteration was done without knowledge of the the visual appearance of Andromeda in the sky. Knowledge of the easily visible nebulous patch M31 enables and understanding of Avienus' allusion. Grotius had not understood the sense of this.

The European discovery (by the German astronomer Simon Marius) of the Andromeda Nebula was not until 12 years later in 1612. Marius gave a description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations. It had been known to Arab astronomers of the Middle Ages. In 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy, in his Book of Fixed Stars as a 'nebulous smear.'
Appendix 7: Minoan Constellations?
Nothing at all is known about Minoan constellations. Everything is speculation/conjecture. In 2005 Evangelos Kyriakidis (Lecturer in Classical and Archaeological Studies at the University of Kent) published his conclusions ("The Unidentified Floating Objects on Late Minoan Seal Iconography." (American Journal of Archaeology, Volume 109, 2005, Pages 137-154)) that the series of unidentified 'floating' objects/ ornamentations comprising dots and drop-like symbols on Minoan seals and gold 'signet rings' found in late bronze age (dated 1600-1700 BCE) contexts in Minoan Crete and mainland Greece are representations of constellations, most of which bear a strong physical resemblance to modern day constellations and their position in the sky (i.e., Orion and Pleiades on the Minoan seal in the Ashmolean Museum). (Prior to this the illustration on a Minoan seal of a man standing with a raised bow had been compared to the constellation Orion.) Kyriakidis argues that his interpretation makes it much more likely that bronze-age Minoan Crete is the source for the later Greek constellation set as the constellation-patterns more closely resemble the later Classical Greek ones much more than any Near Eastern or Middle Eastern examples. Kyriakidis also suggested that the Minoan system of constellations was depicted at times of ritual observances. Kyriakidis also believes that the identification of Minoan constellations helps illuminate the applied knowledge of the bronze-age Minoans regarding calendars, navigation, agriculture, superstition, religion, mythology, and story-telling; a window into the workings of the Minoan mind. Dr Evangelos Kyriakidis FSA is currently (2012) Senior Lecturer Classical & Archaeological Studies, University of Kent, UK. Prior to his appointment at University of Kent he was Cotsen Visiting Scholar in the Institute of Archaeology, UCLA (University of California Los Angeles). At University of Kent he is currently Senior Lecturer in Aegean Prehistory and has wide interests in Mycenaean Administration, Minoan Religion and Iconography as well as Ritual Theory. He is also interested in the history of archaeological thought and in archaeological site management and planning.
Appendix 8: Chronological History of Preserved Early Star Maps
Circa 1500 BCE (late 2nd-millennium BCE) - Several royal tombs in Egypt have ceiling/wall paintings of constellation figures. In the New Kingdom period (circa 1500 to 1100 BCE), the constellational representations were painted on temple ceilings (i.e., the Ramesseum ceiling) and on the sepulchral vaults of kings (i.e., the tomb of Senmut). However these are not accurately drawn and are essentially decorative.
Circa 650 BCE - The Assyrian planisphere K 8538 is a circular star map, divided into equal 8 sectors, with constellations depicted in addition to written constellation names, star names, and symbols. It is not a depiction of the whole visible sky.
Circa 300-100 BCE - Kugel celestial globe may be the earliest celestial globe to survive from antiquity. It does not follow the Graeco-Roman astronomical norms of the period as defined by the astronomer Hipparchus. The size and positions of a number of constellations are misplaced.
Circa 150 BCE - Farnese globe depicting most of the Aratean constellation figures (but not individual stars). Believed by art historians to be a Roman copy of an earlier (presumably) Greek original. It is generally thought that the existing sculpture was made in Rome circa 150 CE and is a late copy of a Greek original made circa 200 BCE. Stars may have been painted on the marble globe.
Circa 140 CE - Ptolemy's descriptive star catalogue with the placement of stars within Eudoxan/Aratean constellation figures. The constellation list in Ptolemy's star catalogue standardised the Western constellation scheme.
Circa 150-220 CE - The Mainz celestial globe is a complete celestial globe in that it depicts all 48 Classical constellations (but does not fully agree with the star-catalogue of Claudius Ptolemy) with relative precision.

Circa 670 CE - Chinese Dunhuang star map depicting the whole of the sky visible in China. The oldest known manuscript star chart and, excluding astrolabes, it is the oldest existing portable star map known.
Circa 715 CE - The Aratean constellation set painted on the domed ceiling at the bath house of the Arab palace at Qusayr 'Amra (Jordan). The constellation depiction/mapping mostly followed the Ptolemaic tradition.
Circa 820 CE - The Leiden Aratea is a 9th-century CE copy of an astronomical and meteorological manuscript based on the Phaenomena written by the Greek poet Aratus The evidence suggests the Leiden Aratea was probably produced in the royal scriptorium, possibly in 816 CE.) The manuscript contains 39 full-page miniatures.
Circa 1009/10 - Al-Sufi's book on the fixed stars. In al-Sufi's Kitab suwar al-kawakib the constellation figures and the individual stars comprising them are shown separately (i.e., separated from each other) without any information on their relative positions being given. No sky map (with all the constellations charted) appears in the book.
1440 CE - Earliest known western maps of the northern and southern hemispheres with both stars and constellation figures. (These are preserved in Vienna and may have been based on the now lost charts from 1425 owned by Regiomontanus.)
1598 CE - Southern constellations depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius. (Until the end of the 16th-century star charts contained only the 48 Ptolemaic constellations.)
Appendix 9: Astrolabes, Decans, and the Zodiac: Popular Confusion Regarding Star Systems Involving 36 Stars
There are a number of confusions still being held/perpetuated regarding systems of stars in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek cultures, and their apparent connectedness. This has to do with the number 36. Also, the mistaken statement continues to be made that there were originally 18 stars in the Babylonian zodiac. This latter mistaken idea can be readily corrected as mistaking the pre-zodiacal Mul.Apin series system of 18 (marking/reference) 'stars' in the path of the moon as a Babylonian zodiac or proto-zodiac. The Mul.Apin series reflects/follows the Babylonian astrolabe system (but in a more sophisticated way). The Mul.Apin series incorporates a refinement of the astrolabe system and then there is a post Mul.Apin series changeover to a zodiacal system. The Babylonian proto-zodiac of 12 (unevenly spaced) constellations was derived from modifying the system involving 18 stars in the path of the moon. Interestingly, I have seen references to the early Babylonian zodiac having 36 reference stars. This is an error.
Mistaken beliefs/confusions noted June 2013:
(1) The 36 star system of the Enuma Elish was zodiacal and set out decan stars. Example: "This text explains the division of the sky into the twelve constellations or the zodiacal signs, each of which are divided into 3 decans, represented by three stars."
(2) The 36 star system of the Enuma Elish is the same as the Egyptian 36 star decan system. Example: "I ... thought it was 3*12 (an 'obvious' link with the Egyptian decan stars). But then I read ... that it were three bands of 12 stars: one on the ecliptic (sic), one band on the south side of ecliptic (sic) and another on the north side of it. So something different perhaps?"
(3) The astrolabe 36 star system is the pattern for the establishment of a zodiac of 36 stars. Example: "Twelve stars each for Anu band (celestial equator) Ea band (north) and Enlil band (south), but each division of the Zodiac (12) had only three stars, one in each band, hence "Three Stars Each". .... But the point is that the numbers remained ...." [Note: Apparently the use of band here means sectors of the 12-sign zodiac. The use of the phrase "only three stars, one in each band, or "Three Stars Each"" apparently means the use of the decans which were 10 degree segments of the zodiacal signs more than, apparently, divisions of the ecliptic or divisions of the zodiac.]

(4) The 36 star system of the Enuma Elish/Astrolabes denoted 10 degree divisions of the sky. Example: "... I ... find it culturally interesting that the Egyptians talk about 36 decan stars with a regular interval of 10 days, while the Mesopotamian culture talks about three bands of 12 (of a month: ~30 days). Or would they still have a regular interval of 10 days? Three bands of 12 does not have to negate 30 intervals of 10 days ...."
Confusion of systems of 36 stars originates with people using 100 year old plus sources for their understanding of star systems in Babylonian culture. The confusion usually starts with the early astronomical commentaries on the Enuma Elish (typically, The Seven Tablets of Creation by Leonard King (2 Volumes, 1902). The Babylonian Enuma Elish, which dates perhaps late 2nd-millennium BCE sets out how Marduk arranged the heavens. In the older sources the Enuma Elish is mistakenly identified as a creation myth but it actually relates Marduk's rise to kingship over all the other gods/goddesses of the Babylonian pantheon.
The British assyriologist Leonard King believed the Enuma Elish described Marduk as establishing the zodiac. This is incorrect. Strangely, some persons believe, from King's explanation, that Marduk is establishing the zodiac and sub-divisions of decans. Marduk is not establishing the zodiac and certainly not the sub-divisions of (zodiacal) decans. Marduk is establishing the '3 ways each' of the so-called 'astrolabe' scheme. Marduk (as king of the gods/goddesses) established the astrolabe scheme of 36 stars – not the zodiacal scheme (and decans i.e., 3 divisions of each sign). The astrolabe system comprised 3 bands with 12 stars in each band, comprising a so-called paranatellonta. The assyriologist David Brown has made the point that in 'Enuma Elish' Marduk arranges the stars in the image of the ideal year scheme of the so-called 'astrolabes' (3 [month] stars each), which primarily served a divinatory purpose. Wayne Horowitz has pointed out Astrolabe B (KAV 218) from the 12th-century BCE would date only shortly prior to the composition of Enuma Elish. The Babylonian title for the so-called astrolabes is mul.meš.3.ta.àm (= "the stars, three of each"). The astrolabe genre of texts was a simple fixed-star scheme. The late Johannes Koch (1989, Page 120) pointed out the circular astrolabe served as an orientation guide and an aid to remembering which stars appeared in which parts of the sky.
Regarding the paths of the '3 stars each' in the astrolabe genre of texts. In the older literature the stars comprising the 'path of Anu' comprising the central band of sky were frequently stated to be ecliptic-based. More modern literature/studies holds this to be incorrect. The central band of sky comprising the 'path of Anu' was not ecliptic-based; it occupied (but was not identified with) the equatorial region/celestial equator.
The system of decans did not originate in the Babylonian astrological system. The decan relationship to the Babylonian-Greek zodiac is the Egyptian system of decans. The 36 (decan) star system of the ancient Egyptians is different to the 36 star Babylonian astrolabe system marking the 12 months.
The original system of Egyptian decan stars independently established during the Old Kingdom period were a set of 36 rising stars/asterisms that were likely positioned south of the ecliptic. The system of decans did not originate in the Babylonian astrological system. The decan relationship to the Babylonian-Greek zodiac is the Egyptian system of decans. The 36 (decan) star system of the ancient Egyptians is different to the 36 star Babylonian astrolabe system marking the 12 months. The later Greek-Roman decanal segments – 10 degrees of the zodiac – though originating from Egypt, were segments not stars. The Egyptians had 36 decan stars. Also, it is generally believed the original set of Egyptian decan stars were not along the ecliptic. They basically comprised 36 stars/asterisms along a single linear star path south of the ecliptic.
There are 36 stellar sectors on the circular astrolabes (manzazu), 1 stellar sector for each of the 36 stars. However, no decan system is meant by Marduk in the Enuma Elish. The astrolabe system is a scheme of 3 divisions (paths) of the sky each path having 12 month stars. In order to posit that the Enuma Elish is somehow connected with or similar to the 36 stars of an earlier Egyptian system and a later BabylonianGreek system (which is a different scheme entirely) the 36 stars of the Babylonian astrolabe system would have to be disconnected from the astrolabe system – which makes no sense. Also, it is not possible to claim legitimacy for the 12 ecliptic star groups or rather signs, with each star group (sign) being divided into 3 parts, as a 36 star system. But the 36 decans of the Babylonian-Greek zodiacal systems are not stars but segments. Also, the system of 36 monthly stars of the Babylonian astrolabe system were not in a linear path but divided between 3 bands marking the sky.

It was initially thought that each of the Mesopotamian 36 stars comprised a scheme similar in purpose to the Egyptian scheme of decan stars - each of the 36 stars in the astrolabes marking one-third of an ideal month (of 30 days length). Put another way, the assignment of 3 stars for each month were first interpreted as based upon their order of heliacal risings, being specifically chosen so they rose heliacally at regular intervals of 10 days. The 3 stars assigned to each month in the astrolabe schemes are now interpreted as rising together to mark each month. (The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, 1998): "It is not explicitly stated in the "Astrolabes" which day the month-stars were supposed to rise, but there is indirect evidence that the Ea-star for each month, at least, were meant to rise on the first of the month.")
The Babylonian-Greek zodiac was defined by the sun rising within a specific constellation/sign.
The later Babylonian-Greek zodiac and decan system does not equate to the 36 star system of the astrolabes. The late zodiacal system was not based on 3 monthly stars, each star being from a different band in the sky. It appears persons believe the zodiac system kept the 3 paths (3 stars each) concept of the astrolabe system and simply changed the central emphasis to the ecliptic – meaning the 12 divisions of the zodiac resulted from the earlier 12 star system. It is not possible – and not accurate - to equate the 'equatorial' (used here for simplicity, not accuracy) astrolabe system (comprising 3 star paths of 12 calendar stars) with the later ecliptic-based zodiacal system of 12 constellations (later signs). The astrolabe system of 3 bands in the sky was not carried over to the ecliptic system of zodiacal constellations (later signs). The zodiacal scheme was a different system. There was a 'cross-over' period in late texts when the astrolabe system or the zodiacal system could both be used (as well as the ziqpu stars).
Regarding the (late) Babylonian-Greek astrological system of 3 decans for each sign of the zodiacal scheme of 12 30-degree signs/divisions. This late zodiac of 12 equal divisions, and 3 equal decans for each division, does not equate to the 36 star system of the astrolabe scheme. A 36 segmental division of the zodiac is Egyptian-Greek. Sensibly, the decans were 10 degree segments of the zodiacal signs more than divisions of the ecliptic or divisions of the zodiac. The decans' associations with the fixed stars (per the Egyptian system) was removed and they were re-associated with thirds of the zodiac of 12 equal signs which were not individual stars (the zodiacal constellations and the 12 equal divisions of the ecliptic are not one and the same). The Babylonian-Greek decans had no astronomical/calendrical use. (It is correct to state" The division of the zodiac into 36 decans of 10 degrees each.)
Regarding the scheme of the Sphaera Barbarica. Teukros 'of Babylon,' 1st-entury CE, made a register of stars that rose to the north and south of each zodiacal sign. Teukros' work was important in the transmission of the astrological system where the zodiac of signs was subdivided into 36 decans, each one a 10 degree segment, 3 decans for each zodiacal sign; and also for the so-called paranatellonta (i.e. the constellations rising on the horizon simultaneously with a certain decan). Teucer also noted those stars (or parts of constellations, not necessarily zodiacal) which rose with each of the decan segments of the Greek zodiacal signs. The Sphaera Barbarica, basically comprising decans and paranatellonta, was an astrological sphere.
The Egyptian zodiacs are late and originated in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There was no other native Egyptian zodiac scheme before this. The extant Egyptian zodiac depictions are Babylonian-Greek. The late Egyptian 12 constellation/sign zodiac was introduced in the Greek-Roman period (1st-century BCE).

reversed from the inscription, and protrudes from the squeeze paper. The use of a squeeze allows more information to be gleaned than by examining the original inscription.) Left: A recent photograph of the squeeze. Right: An early photograph of the squeeze (slightly different orientation). The 'Zodiac of Cairo' or the 'Daressy Zodiac' dates from the Roman Imperial Period. It consists of 3 concentric circles and the various signs have been divided from each other. Outside the central roundel there are 2 rings, the inner ring containing the dodekaoros and the outer ring the Greek zodiac. In the centre are the busts of the Sun and the Moon gods, and a snake.
'Zodiac of Cairo' or the 'Daressy Zodiac'
Roman-period Greek zodiac that is loosely called the 'Zodiac of Cairo' or the 'Daressy Zodiac.' The grey marble plaque (also described as a disk or slab, and made of bronze) some 0.25 metre square was sighted by Georges Daressy in an antiquities dealer's shop in Cairo prior to 1901. (It has also been described as being found by Georges Daressy in (a) Cairo market at the beginning of the 20th-century.) Georges Daressy (1864-1938) was a leading French Egyptologist. The Daressy Zodiac remains one of the few extant examples of an Egyptian zodiac (Dodekaoros) from Roman times. (Another example is the 18th-century planisphere of the Italian philosopher and scientist Francesco Bianchini.) The Daressy Zodiac is now lost in that its present location remains unknown. What we have is a squeeze that was made by Georges Daressy. The squeeze is now kept in the French Archaeological Institute in Cairo.
The dodekaoros was a system of 36 "decans" according to which 3 "paranatellonta" were attached to each sign of the zodiac. Also, each zodiacal sign was divided into 12 equal parts or dodecatemories. The 'Daressy Zodiac' follows the Egyptian tradition in that it includes the dodekaoros.
Depicted on the Daressy Zodiac are the Greek zodiacal signs and associated animals according to a doctrine called "Dodekaoros." (The astrological doctrine of Dodekaoros is known to us from the writings of the astrologer Teucrus (circa 1st-century BCE) and the Byzantine astrologer Rhetorios (circa 600 CE).) There are 2 concentric bands enclosing a central area. Depicted in the central area are busts of the sun (Sol) as Apollo and the moon (Luna) as Phoebe (with a bow); and a snake(?). The outer band has the clockwise depiction of the signs of the Greek zodiac. The inner band has 12 animals depicted. Twelve radial lines divide the bands into 12 individual sectors. In his book Sphaera (1903) the German philologist Franz Boll showed that the inner band contains representations of animals that are associated with the zodiacal signs according to an astrological doctrine called "Dodekaoros."
The pairs pictorially depicted (juxtapositioned) on the Daressy Zodiac are:
Aries (ram (with belt): cat (sitting),
Taurus (bull): dog, (or jackal)
Gemini (twins (man and woman): serpent,
Cancer (crab): scarabaeus/crab,
Leo (lion): donkey/ass,
Virgo (virgin): lion (walking),
Libra (balance (borne by a man): goat (or gazelle),
Scorpio (scorpion): bull/ox,
Sagittarius (archer (centaur)): falcon,
Capricorn (goatfish): baboon/ape,
Aquarius (waterman): ibis,
Pisces (fishes): crocodile.
The dodekaoros circle follows the description given by the astrologer Teucrus.
The 'Daressy Zodiac' has important connections with the 'Planisphaerium Bianchini' and the 'Ponza Zodiac.' All show Egyptian influences. (It appears that it was (like the 'Planisphaerium Bianchini') an astrological dicing board of the kind described by the Armenian Bishop Eustathius of Antioch. It involved divination by throwing and also served for casting horoscopes.)

'Planisphaerium Bianchini' or 'Tabula Bianchini,' a marble astrological table. It is likely that dice were thrown on it to cast horoscopes. It is dated not earlier than the 2nd-century CE by Wilhelm Froehner (1869) but is now thought to likely date to the 3rd-century CE. The illustration above was included as 1 of 22 engravings (plates) in l'Origine de tous les cultes ou religion universelle by CharlesFrançois Dupuis (1795) with the title/description 'Planisphere astrologique de style Egyptian.' The 'Planisphaerium Bianchini' (or 'Tabula Bianchini') shows 5 concentric circles, in 2 of which the zodiac sequence is presented. The centre of the system is drawn on the pole of the ecliptic (with the constellation Draco or Dragon), not on the pole of the equator (with the constellation Ursa Major) because the Sun's passage through the sky along the ecliptic is the relevant path for the system of astrology. The separation of the 2 bear constellations is accurately represented in the central roundel. Around the central roundel are a series of concentric bands (rings). From the centre outwards the bands contain: (1) the dodekaoros (i.e., the Egyptian zodiacal signs), (2) and (3) the Greek zodiacal signs repeated in 2 identical bands, (4) the 36 decans (i.e., the guardians of each third of each sign, of Egyptian origin like the dodekaoros), and (5) the planetary deities corresponding to each decan. An inscription in Greek is on the black ribbon. Of the 36 decans only the figures of 8 have survived on the fragments recovered.

'Planisphaerium Bianchini' or 'Tabula Bianchini,' a marble astrological table. Source: La Rivista di Engramma (online), http://www.engramma.it/eOS/index.php?id_articolo=1137. Bianchini's planisphere, 2nd-century CE. (Paris, Musée du Louvre, inv. Ma 540.) Discovered in Rome in the 18th-century, the plate displays the surviving fragments of a planisphere incorporating the so-called "Barbaric Sphere," which depicts the Greek, Egyptian and Mesopotamian constellations. In the centre there are the constellations of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor and Draco. The four circles contain images of the 'Chaldean' (Mesopotamian) zodiac, two Greek zodiacs, an area with numbers that indicate the planets' influence on the individual signs of the zodiac, and lastly, the Egyptian Decans (the gods who preside over the 10-day sequence), each with his name. The outer circle shows the faces of the Greek Decans, or personifications of the seven planetary deities.
'Planisphaerium Bianchini' (or 'Tabula Bianchini')
The planisphere of Bianchini is a complicated example of a geometric and stylised pattern for rendering the celestial sky. Within this tradition appears the use of 4 or 5 concentric circles in which are portrayed the constellations and stars. It is a much simpler (and more conventional) method for portraying the celestial sky than the more scientific method of attempting to portray the natural celestial sky. The method of using the geometric pattern of concentric circles, usually 4 or 5, in which to portray the celestial bodies is stylised and simple. All that is required of an artist is drawing 5, or less, concentric circles depending on what he wanted to portray, and then representing each of the celestial bodies within the circles, not as existing in the celestial sky, but as best fitted to the geometric pattern. The dominance of the circular motif is an attempt to force natural aspects of the celestial sky into an unnatural pattern. In the planisphere of Bianchini the polar constellations are in the centre, In the following circle the animals representing the 12 hours are placed next to their corresponding constellations in the following 3rd circle. In the 4th circle are the signs of the zodiac. The planets are portrayed in the 5th circle.

'Planisphaerium Bianchini' (or 'Tabula Bianchini') now held in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. (The Louvre catalog/illustration reference is given by Hans Gundel as: Louvre, v. vol. lv, p. 1040, fig. 1231.) It is a remaining fragment of a largely damaged Roman (EgyptianRoman) planisphere dated to the 2nd- or 3rd-century CE incorporating the Sphaera Barbarica (i.e., Greek, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian (zodiacal) constellations). The artifact is made of marble. It was found in several fragments in 1705 (1708?) on Mount Aventin (the Aventine Hill/Mount) in Rome and given to the French Academy by Francesco Bianchini. (It is called the planisphere of Bianchine because it was first published by that Italian astronomer.) Though the exact find spot was not recorded it has been suggested by Maarten Vermaseren (1974) that it was perhaps discovered in the grounds of the Mithraeum of Santa Prisca (discovered in 1958 and located beneath the 4-century CE church of Santa Prisca). The Planisphaerium/Tabula shows 5 concentric circles and 4 of these concentric circles are divided into segments by radial lines.
It basically presents 3 circular zodiacs side-by-side. Depicted in the centre (innermost circle) are the 2 Bears (Ursa Major and Ursa Minor) and the intertwined Dragon/Snake (= Draco). The 2 Bears are represented facing in opposite directions. The Dragon/Snake (= Draco) does not surround them both but coils between them. (The centre of the system is drawn on the pole of the ecliptic and, from the nature of the depiction, is obviously located in alpha Draconis. This placement is a concept within the scheme of the Sphaera Barbarica and is devoid of any precessional concept. That said, whilst the pole of the equator moves due to precession the stars in the region of the pole of the ecliptic are not subject to precessional movement. In the Classical Graeco-Roman sky the coils of Draco entwine the pole of the ecliptic.) There are then 4 concentric bands and an outermost ring of figures. The figures comprising a "Chaldean" zodiac are depicted in the first circle (i.e., the 12 animals of the Dodecahōros Chaldaikē). Two identical Greek zodiacs are depicted in bands 2 and 3 - meaning evidently the fixed and the movable ecliptic distinguished by Ptolemy and coinciding accurately as they were at the instant of the creation. (This dates the item to no earlier than the 2nd-century CE.) We then have a zone of Greek numerals giving the oria or limits of the planetary influences in the several signs of the zodiac. (This is the inscription in Greek on the black ribbon.) The figures in the fourth band (the second most outer ring of depicted figures) depict the Egyptian decans (which appear in authentic Egyptian stylization), the Graeco-Egyptian names of each one inscribed below the figure. On the outermost ring, outside of the fourth band, we have the prosōpa, facies (= faces/persons) depicted. These faces are loosely the Greek decans. These faces have their heads encircled by a nimbus. (The interpretation by Robert Eisler is they are the faces of the 7 planetary gods repeated again and again, in the septizonium order, each one co-ordinated with one of the decans.) On the planisphere each of the Egyptian decans is associated with a planetary ruler (dignitary) prosōpa, facies. Lines drawn from the circumference of the central circle, through the limits of the zodiacal signs, divide the whole planisphere into 12 sectors. In each of the 4 corners (extremities) the winged heads of the 4 main winds are depicted. (Only 1 is depicted in the remaining fragment.)
It has been commented that the decan system on the 'Tabula Bianchini' insinuates itself as a separate region between the fixed stars and the planets.
The Italian polymath and Vatican courtier Francesco Bianchini was a noted antiquarian and director of antiquities in Rome. However, he is largely forgotten today. He was born in Verona (Northern Italy), studied in Bologna and Padua, and in 1684 permanently transferred his residence to Rome and became part of the scholarly circle there. He achieved high levels of church patronage through a combination of family connections, fortunate circumstances, and his demonstrated intellectual ability. (His enormous breadth of learning included expert knowledge of mathematics, physics, astronomy, and the natural sciences.) Throughout his life Francesco Bianchini remained financially dependent on the Roman Curia. On arriving in Rome he immediately found a patron in Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (later Pope Alexander VIII (1689-1691)) and became custodian of his library. He also held minor orders in the Roman Catholic Church. He studied theology and in 1699 achieved deaconship but never progressed to ordination as a priest. As presidente delle antichità di Roma (to which he was elected in 1703) he was enormously influential in the Vatican museums and also in the archaeological excavations in the Papal States. He was especially interested in the transmission of knowledge through images which functioned both as a form of illustration (historical evidence) and as a mnemotic aid (memory aid). During the course of several journeys in Europe he traveled with a wagon-load of scientific instruments.
Franz Boll (Sphaera (1903), Page 303) reproduces a similar fragment, now lost, known only through an old engraving by the French antiquarian Nicolas Peirese (1580-1637) that was later reproduced in a book by the French Benedictine monk and scholar Bernard Montfaucon (1655-1741).
The 'Planisphaerium Bianchini' has important connections with the 'Daressy Zodiac' and the 'Ponza Zodiac.' All show Egyptian influences. (It appears that it was (like the 'Daressy Zodiac') an astrological dicing board of the kind described by the Armenian Bishop Eustathius of Antioch. It involved divination by throwing a dice on to it and also served for casting horoscopes.) There are only 2 zodiacal monuments preserved from the whole of antiquity that show the sign of the North Pole in the centre. One of these is the 'Planisphaerium/Tabula Bianchini' and the other is the Ponza zodiac.
The Sphaera Babarica
(1) Introduction
From the late Hellenistic period there existed a completely different Sphaera barbarica. These fanciful 'constellations' may reflect late Egyptian and Babylonian traditions, but our knowledge of them comes exclusively from the fragmentarily preserved Graeco-Latin astrological literature. The first evidence for the Sphaera barbarica is connected with Nigidius Figulus (1st-century BCE).
The sphaera barbaric was identified by the German philologist/classicist Franz Boll (Sphaera, 1903) as describing the genre of paranatellonta.
The Sphaera Graecanica and the Sphaera Barbarica were the 2 main constellation systems of the classical Graeco-Roman world. The term Sphaera Barbarica means the "barbarian sphere"/'sky-map of the foreigners" (predominantly Babylonian and Egyptian) and the Sphaera Graecanica means the "sky-map of the Greeks." The Sphaera Barbarica existed from the late Hellenistic period. Sphaera Barbarica originally meant the star-map of the Babylonians. However, it likely comprised late Egyptian and Babylonian traditions. (Jim Tester, A History of Western Astrology (1987)) states the term was used in classical antiquity to refer to any non-Greek description



2022. 02. 21. 19:58 History of Constellation and Star Names

of the heavens, most usually the Egyptian constellations.) Knowledge of the Sphaera Barbarica comes exclusively from the preserved fragments of Graeco-Roman astrological literature. The first evidence for the Sphaera Barbarica is connected with Nigidius Figulus (1st-century BCE). In his work Sphaera, Figulus described both the Greek constellations and the so-called sphaera barbarica. The Sphaera Barbarica of Figulus seems to have been a composite of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian spheres. It had little effect on Greek astronomical tradition but greatly affected Indian, Islamic, and medieval Western astrology and it artistic representation. In antiquity the Sphaera Barbarica originally referred to any non-Greek description of the heavens, and later the term included an eclectic mixture of the Egyptian sphere, elements of Babylonian astronomy, constellations described by Ptolemy, and the star map of the Romans. The system was codified for the first time by the astronomer/astrologer Teucrus in the 1st-century CE. The position of many of constellations belonging to the Sphaera Barbarica are now not not known.
The phrase referred in antiquity to any non-Greek description of the heavens, and according to some scholars (Jim Tester) usually to the Egyptian pattern of constellations. In the opinion of the classical historian Frederick Cramer (and others) there were probably 2 Sphaera Babarica, known to the Greeks in Hellenistic times, a Mesopotamian one and an Egyptian one. (Teukros, Antiochus, Valens, (and Peterios ?) mention Egyptian constellations. Figulus, Varro, Manilius, and Maternus mention Babylonian constellations.)
Aby Warburg proposed that the Sphaera Barbarica was devised in Asia Minor. From there it eventually (1) passed to Egypt, and (2) passed eastward to the Orient (India and then the Islamic Persian Empire) and eventually became incorporated in the Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum (Latin title: Introductorium maius) by the Islamic scholar Abū Ma'shar. (The Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus was translated into Pahlavi for the first time circa the 3rd-century CE.) This astrological tradition finally reached Latin Europe via the Arab-Islamic world toward the end of the Middle Ages (via Spain into France).
The Sphaera Barbarica has been described as a kind of parasite on the Sphaera Graecanica. It has been claimed that it eventually came to rival the Sphaera Graecanica. However, it may not have been a serious rival at all. The Sphaera barbarica had little influence on the astronomical tradition, but later greatly affected Indian, Islamic, and medieval western astrology and its artistic representations.
(2) Sources for Graeco-Roman knowledge of the Sphaera Barbarica
Evidence for direct constellation borrowing from Mesopotamian is almost non-existent.
It is possible that Babylonian uranography was passed to the Greeks through particular intermediaries such as the Phoenicians and Egyptians. During the Hellenistic period it is possible that Berossus and some Chaldaean contemporaries made the Babylonian sphaera familiar to the Greeks. Berossus the Chaldean (flourished circa 290 BCE), a Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer who taught astrology when residing on the Greek island of Cos, and some of his Babylonian contemporaries may have familiarised the Greeks with the late Babylonian sphere. In the early Ptolemaic period the Hellenistic scholars engaged with a mass-translation of Egyptian texts in Greek would have become familiar with the Egyptian sphaera of that period. Ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian star groupings differed from those of the Greeks. When they sometimes did use similar star groupings they used different mythological/animal names.
All references to the Greek Sphaera Barbarica come from Latin writers/astrologers. Latin authors writing about the Sphaera Barbarica include Critodemo, Cicero, Nigidius, Dorotheos, Manilius, Maternus, Asclepiades, Valens, Antiochos, and Teucrus.
(3) The invention of the Sphaera Barbarica
The Sphaera Barbarica was an invention of the Greek world. The Sphaera Barbarica is thought to have originated in Greek Asia Minor. The Greeks appear to have originally introduced the term to distinguish the Greek sphere from the hybrid Egyptian sphere (of the Hellenic period) comprising native Egyptian constellations and borrowed Babylonian constellations. After the ('traditional') Greek constellations were established (which included adopted Babylonian constellations) some Graeco-Roman astrologers began modifying the constellation set by introducing foreign (non-Greek) constellations and stars, both Babylonian and Egyptian, into the (established) Greek scheme of constellations.
Construction of a Sphaera Barbarica in antiquity was carried out from circa the 2nd-century BCE onwards. In Hellenistic times the non-Greek constellations were still well-known. It is doubtful whether there was yet a definitive Greek sphaera. The Greek astronomer Eudoxus in the 4th-century BCE and the Greek poet Aratus in the 3rd-century BCE laid the basis of a Greek celestial picture-atlas. However, it was the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 2nd-century BCE who first defined the outlines of the constellations systematically in terms of individual stars identified by coordinates. Hipparchus basically followed the constellation scheme of Eudoxus and Aratus. The Greek Sphaera which was passed down to the West was that of the Hellenized astronomer Ptolemy (2ndcentury CE), which owed much to Hipparchus. No addition was made to it until the 17th-century CE.
(4) The composition of the Sphaera Babarica
The Sphaera Barbarica was comprised primarily of Babylonian and Egyptian constellations. The Sphaera Barbarica seems to have been a composite of Mesopotamian constellations and Egyptian constellations. (Additional information about this syncretic "barbaric" constellation scheme is contained in Greek astrological texts, especially those of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.) The Sphaera Barbarica basically comprised decans and paranatellenta. (Paratellonta are non-zodiacal constellations that rise and set at the same time as the zodiacal constellations.) The Greek zodiac, however, was basically left unchanged. The Sphaera Barbarica was based on the 12 constellations of the Greek zodiac. (The Sphaera Graecanica was based on the 12 (Greek) zodiacal constellations.) Pictures of the signs of the zodiac of the Sphaera Barbarica were, however, different to the classical Greek pictures. The non-zodiacal component of the Sphaera Barbarica apparently was not standardised and was changed over time. The later texts mentioning the Sphaera Barbarica often actually discuss (sky-maps consisting of) a mixture of Greek and Mesopotamian/Egyptian material. Broadly, however, the Sphaera Barabarica was a Hellenistic name for alternative constellations (zodiacal constellations excluded) that were not used in the established constellation set comprising the Sphaera Graecanica.)
The astrologers Teucrus and Valens listed Eridanus among the paranatellonta of Aquarius. However, they called the liquid (water or a mix of water and nectar) gushing from the jug of Aquarius Eridanus. This liquid gushing from the jug of Aquarius was meant to join

the constellation Eridanus (of the Sphaera Graecanica) below Piscis Austrinus.
To some extent the 'Sphaera Barbarica' is a collective term for the catalogues of ancient astrologers known as paranatellonta. (Chapters 5-17 of Mathesis by Firmicus Maternus deal with the paranatellonta (the stars rising with the signs of the zodiac). Prior to the time of Claudius Ptolemy (circa 85 - circa 165) a system of paranatellonta was developed that could be used to tell the hours of the night when the signs of the zodiac were hidden. Paranatellonta (or synanatellonta) are stars which rise at the same time as a given zodiacal sign, or bright stars such as Regulus or Sirius. Teucrus laid stress on the decans and their paranatellonta. The use of these paranatellonta for astrological purposes has been ascribed to Teucrus but is undoubtedly earlier. In the Sphaera Barbarica Figulus gave for each of the360 degrees of the ecliptic the astral forecasts based on the character of the stars "rising together" (paranatellontes). (The references to constellations, in particular their simultaneous risings and settings, make it possible to distinguish between two different sets of uranography - a Sphaera Barbarica and a Sphaera Graecanica.)
According to one researcher the sphaera barbarica is the Egyptian description of the heavens extensively modified by the Roman astronomers. According to another source the Sphaera Barbarica largely describes the genre of paranatellonta writing.
Our knowledge of Teucrus is limited and his system of paranatellonta has been reconstructed only after Franz Boll combined several later textual sources. In the system developed by Teucrus constellations/asterisms simultaneously rise to the north and to the south of the celestial equator at the time when the sun is in the corresponding ten degree arc of the ecliptic (sphaera barbarica). When constellations of the sphaera barbarica rise north or south of the celestial equator they are called paranatellonta. Teucrus also explained the astrological influence of his constellations through a system of paranatellonta. The word "paranatellonta" comes from the Greek para ('rapa; together) and anatellein; to rise), and it refers to the stars and constellations simultaneously rising to the north and to the south of the celestial equator. With Teucrus the paranatellonta never appear individually, but always in relation to the zodiac. It is significant that they are temporal and not spatial sequences. The stars or constellations of paranatellonta related to a single zodiacal sign (or its decan) do not belong to the same 30° (or 10°) of the ecliptic. Rather, they rise simultaneously anywhere in the sky during the period which is determined by the temporal sequence of that particular sign (or decan). Franz Boll concluded that Teucrus combined in the paranatellonta two different systems: one in which the paranatellonta were related to the decans, and the other in which they were related to the zodiac.
(5) Nigidius Figulus and the Sphaera Barbarica
Only fragments of the Sphaera Barbarica have come down to the present-day. Most of our knowledge about non-Greek constellations and star names comes from extant fragments of the Latin book on the Sphaera Barbarica by Nigidius Figulus. (Nigidius Figulus was a neo-Pythagorean and the leading figure among the Roman Pythagoreans.) Figulus seems to have dealt methodically with both the Greek and "barbaric" constellations. Only Nigidius Figulus appears to have separately discussed non-Greek constellations only in his work titled Sphaera Barbarica. Greek constellations were separately discussed in his work titled Sphaera Graecanica. He was the only writer to do such. Figulus' Sphaera Graecanic and Sphaera Barbarica (The Dome of the Sky, Greek and Near Eastern) discussed the names of constellations, astrology, and horoscopes. Figulus was a Roman statesman and scholar of probable Etruscan ancestry. However, Teucrus also transmitted many names of the Sphaera Barbarica. The Sphaera Babarica of Figulus was concerned with paranatellonta. The Sphaera Graecanica of Figulus was also concerned with paranatellonta.
(6) Teucrus 'the Babylonian'
Teucrus is (first?) called "the Babylonian" by the Greek philosopher Porphyrius (circa 270 CE). It is generally accepted that "Babylon" presumably designated Seleukeia on the Tigris. The historian Robert Eisler suggested (without evidence) that "Babylon" referred to the fortress-town of this names in Egypt (near Cairo). It is thought that Teucrus probably wrote his Sphaera Barbarica in Asia Minor. Several forms of the Sphaera Babarica of Teucrus are known. The form of the Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus which passed through Arab-Islamic scholarship is arranged according to decans. Also, Teucrus supplemented or replaced the traditional Greek constellations with exotic ones. "The sphaera barbarica (i.e., non-Greek mappings of the heavens) - in particular representations of the decans, whose iconography was transformed through Indian mediation - was transferred to Sasanian Iran; thence it entered Arabic astrological texts. Greek descriptions of the paranàtellonta toîs dekanoîs, that is, the constellations rising on the horizon together with a particular decan, were made by Teucer the Babylonian, an astrologer to be placed between the 1st century BCE and the first century CE. ("Zodiac." by Antonio Panaino, Encyclopædia Iranica.)"
The work of Teucrus on the Sphaera Barbarica (De Sphaera Barbarica) was described by the art historian Aby Warburg as being nothing more than a description of the Greek fixed-star sky with the addition of star names from Egypt, Babylonia, and Asia Minor (causing it to surpass the 'star catalogue' of Aratus almost 3 times over). (It seems that in many cases Teucrus gave a different ('barbaric') name to the same Greek constellation.) However, it was Teucrus who codified his system as the Sphaera Barbarica. The Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus has come down to the present-day in several forms. In one of these forms the Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus is arranged according to decans. This form of Teucrus' Sphaera Barbarica was transmitted to the Western Europe during the Middle Ages through Arab-Islamic star catalogues and lapidaria (books of precious stones).
The Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus was different from the Sphaera Graecanica, which was based on the twelve constellations of the zodiac, and which Greek astronomers had almost entirely borrowed from Babylonian uranography. Boll demonstrated that the Sphaera Barbarica, at least the system finalised by Teucrus in the 1st-century CE, derived from the list of stars (paranatellonta) that accompanied the rising of the zodiacal constellations. It appears that Teucus did a number of things. He made a register of stars that rose to the north and south of each zodiacal sign. His work was important in the transmission of the astrological system of the decans, i.e. the subdivision of the zodiac into 36 decans, each one 10 degree (3 per constellation), and also of the so-called paranatellonta (i.e. the constellations rising on the horizon simultaneously with a certain decan).
As example of constellation differences with his system: Teukros the Babylonian mentions a group of stars called the Trident in the neighbourhood of the Fish.

The French scholar Joseph Scalinger (1540-1609), in his 2nd edition (commentary) of Manilius (1600) (effectively a treatise on ancient astronomy), began the investigation of the Sphaera Barbarica on the basis of a version preserved in the writings of Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra (1092-1167) - who had derived it from the writings of Abū Ma'shar.)
The influence of Teucrus
The Sphaera Barbarica by Teucrus was used by Marcus Manilus, Firmicus Maternus, and Rhetorius of Egypt. Also by Johannes Kamateros as late as the 12th-century. Marcus Manilius (his name is uncertain, flourished 1st-century CE) was a Roman poet, astrologer, and author of a poem in 5 books called Astronomica. It is a work of great learning. Interestingly, the author of Astronomica is neither quoted nor mentioned by any ancient writer. Julius Firmicus Maternus (flourished early 4th-century CE) was a Roman writer and notable astrologer. Rhetorius of Egypt (flourished in either the early 6th or early 7th century CE, in the early Byzantine era) was the last major astrologer of the Hellenistic tradition from whom we have any excerpts. He wrote an extensive astrological compendium/anthology that consisted largely of excerpts from earlier astrologers such as Antiochus of Athens. The compendium is mainly concerned with the techniques of the Hellenistic astrologers who preceded him. The didactic astrological poem (Compendium of Astrology) of the Byzantine Johannes Kamateros (circa mid 12th-century), was dedicated to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I (Mauel Komnenos), 'the defender of astrology.' The chapter on paranatellonta is linked to the tradition of Teucrus.
(7) The function of the Sphaera Barbarica
In Book VIII of his Mathesis, Firmicus Maternus deals with the Sphaera Barbarica. Part of it is uncritically copied from Marcus Manilius. The work of Firmicus Maternus provides evidence that the Sphaera Barbarica was an astrological sphere. The Sphaera Barbarica comprised stars and constellations outside the Greek zodiac. The Sphaera Barbarica was a non-Greek system of astrology. The astrology of the Sphaera Barbarica involved astrological forecasting by stars and constellations outside the zodiac.
Observations of the constellations rising on the horizon together with a particular decan, were made by Teucrus the Babylonian, an astrologer who can only be placed between the 1st-century BCE and the 1st-century CE.
(8) The influence of the Sphaera Barbarica
According to Hans Gundel its actual prominence in the Greek world may not have been great. However, the Sphaera Barbarica (with its decans and paranatellonta) had a major impact in Indian astrology, Arab-Islamic astrology, and Latin astrology during the Middle Ages.
(9) The success of the Sphaera Graecanica
The ultimate success of the Sphaera Graecanica (i.e., its complete acceptance by the Greek world and later the Roman world was largely due to the work of the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th-century BCE) and the Greek poet Aratus of Soli (3rd-century BCE). Eudoxus constellated and catalogued the entire Greek sky in his works Enoptron and Phaenomena. Aratus later turned these works into an astronomical poem concerning the constellations. The Phaenomena became hugely popular in the Graeco-Roman world. Without this popularisation by Aratus the works of Eudoxus may never have exerted the lasting influence they achieved. (The final consolidation of the Greek constellations was based Hipparchus and the writings of Ptolemy.)
(10) History of the Sphaera Barbarica
The first text to cite the Sphaera Barbarica was by Critodemo in the 3rd-century BCE (?). Teucrus (Teucer), 1st-century CE, gave the (supposed) final version.
In the 1st-century BCE the Roman senator and astrologer Nigidius Figulus (circa 100-45 BCE), a revivalist of Pythagoreanism, wrote his 2 books (now lost) on the Sphaera Barbarica and the Sphaera Graecanica. (The term Sphaera Barbarica and Sphaera Graecanica was first used by Nigidius Figulus.) The Sphaera Barbarica of Nigidius is indicated as a mix of Egyptian constellations/decans and Greek-Babylonian constellations. It is thought that Nigidius' work on the Sphaera Barbarica was probably derived from the likenamed work of Asclepiades of Myrlea. (Note: Perhaps Nigidius wrote a single book Sphaera graecanica et sphaera barbarica.) The Sphaera Barbarica dealt with the pre-Greek nomenclature of the stars and constellations, mostly Mesopotamian and Egyptian in origin. (It is most likely that there were two "barbaric" constellation schemes, a Mesopotamian one and an Egyptian one.) Teucrus the Babylonian (circa 1st-century BCE (circa 1st-century CE?)) also wrote a basic work (now lost) on the Sphaera Barbarica. (The Hellenistic astrologer Teucrus of Babylon lived between the 1st-century BCE and the 1st-century CE.)
Traces of the Sphaera Barbarica also exist in the astrological writings of Marcus Manilius (circa 1st-century CE), of Vettius Valens (circa 2nd-century CE), of Antiochos of Athens (circa 2nd-century CE), and Firmicus Maternus (circa 4th-century CE). (The Sphaerica of Vettius Valens is not identifiable with treatises on the sphere written by Aratus, Eudoxus, or Hipparchus.) The fact of the Sphaera Barbarica (or rather traces of it) being encountered in the astrological writings of Firmicus Maternus (flourished circa mid 4th-century CE) demonstrates that its progress into oblivion was not rapid. Also, nearly all the constellations discussed by Marcus Manilius (1st-century CE), including the paranatellonta he enumerates, which are commonly referred to as Sphaera Barbarica, are actually Greek. More correctly, only traces of the Sphaera Barbarica are found in Marcus Manilius. What in Manilius really belonged to a Sphaera Barbarica is now unable to be established. One of the few exceptions is the so-called Haedus (Kid), which is described as one of the paranatellonta of Libra. Both Firmicus and Manilius had no understanding of astronomy. Both simply followed their sources. Also, nearly all of the constellations discussed by Manilius as paranatellonta are Greek.
There seems little doubt that in Hellenistic period the non-Greek constellations were still well-known to the Greeks. References to the Sphaera Barbarica in the 2nd-century CE by Vettius Valens shows that it had not yet been wholly superseded by the Sphaera Graecanica. Valens derived some of his material from Teucrus. In the 4th-century CE Firmicus Maternus was still familiar with the Sphaera Barbarica even if this was a syncretism of the Sphaera Barbarica and Sphaera Graecanica.

(11) The confused state of the Sphaera Barbarica
The term sphaera barbarica should mean constellation schemes containing only non-Greek constellations. However, in practice, ancient texts describing a sphaera barbarica often discuss a mixture of Greek and Mesopotamian/Egyptian material.
Most so-called Sphaera Barabarica texts often discuss a mixture of of Greek and Mesopotamian/Egyptian material. In doing so they typically show no awareness of their syncretism of material or their repetitious description of the same stars/constellations. Only Nigidius Figulus appears to have separately discussed non-Greek constellations only in his work titled Sphaera Barbarica. Greek constellations were separately discussed in his work titled Sphaera Graecanica. He was the only writer to do such.
A variety of sources from the classical period attest to knowledge of, and use of, non-Greek constellations i.e., constellations having Mesopotamian or Egyptian origins. However, these texts frequently discuss a mixture of Greek, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian constellations/asterisms. In antiquity the name Sphaera Barbarica was inexactly used (i.e., far removed from its proper and original sense) for a scheme of non-Greek and Greek constellations i.e., the Latin astrologer Firmicus Maternus and the Greek physician Asclepiades of Bithynia. Marcus Manilius also does not strictly set out the Sphaera Barbarica. The Sphaera Barbarica of Asclepiades of Myrlea contained both Greek and non-Greek constellations. Also, it was not concerned with paranatellonta. The phrase Sphaera Barbarica referred (properly) in antiquity to any non-Greek description of the heavens, and usually to the Egyptian pattern of constellations. By the 1st and 2nd centuries CE the Sphaera Barbarica encountered in Greek astrological texts is usually syncretic; a mix of Greek and non-Greek spheres. Katharina Volk (Manitius and his Intellectual Background (2009)) writes: "They do so typically without showing any awareness of their own syncretism or of the possibility that they may be describing the same stars over and over again - whether as parts of different constellations, or as the same constellation with a different name. ... The title [Sphaera Barbarica] appears to have been used in this strict sense only by Nigidius Figulus, who wrote both a Sphaera Graecanica and a Sphaera Barbarica, with the first containing the Greek and the second the non-Greek constellations ...." Also, proponents of the scheme of the Sphaera Barbarica, to a considerable extent, introduced fictitious constellations.
(12) Horoscopes and the Sphaera Barbarica
Only a few horoscopes surviving from antiquity contain date pertaining to the Sphaera Barbarica. One example is a Greek papyrus in the British Museum dating from 81 CE in which an astrologer named Titos Pitenios drew up the horoscope of a person name Hermon.
(13) Introductorium maius in astronomiam by Abū Ma'šar
The main source for the transmission of Persian astrological iconography to the West was Introductorium maius (Great Introduction to Astronomy) by Abū Ma'shar. This book was also the main authority for Western medieval astrology.
Antonio Panaino has pointed out Teucrus' work was very important in the transmission of the astrological system of the decans. (This astrological system of decans (involving the subdivision of the zodiac into 36 decans, each decan of 10 degrees length, with 3 decans per constellation (sign)) also included the so-called paranatellonta (those constellations rising on the eastern horizon simultaneously with a certain decan).) The Egyptian iconography of the decans, modified with Indian and Sasanian elements, was transferred through the Arabic work of Abū Ma'shar, Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum (Latin title: Introductorium maius) to Spain, and then to France. A Latin translation of the treatise Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum was completed by Hermann of Dalmatia in 1143 CE. An abridgement based on this version was made in the second half of the 12th-century CE by Georgius Fendulus. Numerous copies of both Latin manuscripts were made and circulated in Europe. The writings of Teucrus later influenced the Arabs.
In his Sphaera (1903) Franz Boll showed that the Persian astrologer Abū Ma'shar (Latin name: Albumasar) (circa 787-886 CE) used a (Middle) Persian translation (or rearrangement) (made in 542 CE under Xusraw Anōširwān) of the Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus the Babylonian in the writing of his Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum (Latin title: Introductorium maius). Abū Ma'shar also used Indian sources, derived from the 6th-century CE Indian astronomer Varāhamihira, about the iconography of the decans. (Varāhamihira had in turn used the Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja (a 3rd-century CE Indian astrologer) which was a versification of a 2nd-century CE Sanskit translation of a Greek-Alexandrian astrological text.) In his book Abū Ma'shar Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum also linked astrology to both Neoplatonic Aristotelianism and to Hermeticism. (The titles of Latin translations of key books by Abū Ma'shar are: Flores astrologiae (1488), Introductorium maius (1489), Introductorium in astronomiam (1489), and De magnis conjunctionibus (1489).) In this way Abū Ma'shar is an important source for early Hellenistic constellation lore. Abū Ma'shar's description of the three astrological systems related to the zodiacal signs: (1) the Greek firmament based on the writings of Ptolemy (sphaera graecanica); (2) the Indian system of decans by Varahamihira (sphaera indica); and (3) the system of Teucrus (sphaera barbarica).
Abū Ma'shar was also the father of European Medieval and Renaissance astrology. (Abū Ma'shar was born in northern Afghanistan and settled permanently in Baghdad during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mum (813-833).) For scholars in western Europe the principal source of scientific astrology was the Graeco-Roman tradition of Ptolemy. It is commonly believed today that the medieval astrological tradition developed as a direct extension of Antiquity. However. the astrological, mythological. and symbolic traditions were translated from Antiquity to the Middle Ages in a broad circle, through Arab-Islamic civilisation, touching diverse cultures such as those of Persia, India, and the Arabic regions. What reached Europe in the 12th-century was a conglomerate of different traditions, comprised of Western and Eastern characteristics in somewhat equal measure.
(14) Georgius Fendulus and the reappearance of the paranatellonta
The Croation scholar and translator of Arabic texts, Hermann of Dalmatia (actually Hermann of Carinthia) (circa 1110-circa 1154), a pioneer of European science, translated into Latin in 1140, Introductorium maius in astronomiam by Abū Ma'šar. The work was twice translated into Latin in the 12th-century. The work was first translated into Latin by Juan (John) from Seville in 1133. An illustrated abridgment of the treatise was made in the 2nd part of the 12th-century by Georgius Fendulus, and was based upon the lengthy multi

volume Latin translation by Hermann of Dalmatia (from 1140-1143) of Introductorium maius in astronomiam. (Fendulus misleadingly claimed he translated the text from Persian to Latin.) Between the 1220s/1240s and circa 1500, Fendulus' abridgment of Introductorium maius in astronomiam, written by Abū Ma'šar (787-886), was copied several times and 6 copies have been preserved, originating from southern Italy, the Low Countries, and Paris. Within the celestial imagery introduced by Georgius Fendulus is the appearance of the paranatellonta. The original treatise by the Arabic astrologer, astronomer, and philosopher Abū Ma'šar (787-886) was written in Baghdad in 848 CE. It had an extensive influence on the development of both astrology and astronomy in the Latin West and the Arab-Islamic East.
(15) Astrolabium Magnum by Pietro d'Abano
The Sphaera Barbarica, as described in the book Astrolabium Magnum (1448) by the Italian philosopher, medical doctor, and astrologer Pietro d’Abano (1257-1315/6), played an important role in the program of decoration of the so-called Salone at the Palazzo della Ragione in Padua (1306) and in the Salone dei Mesi at the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrera (1470). Aby Warburg writes that Boll: "... discovered, for instance, a small book illustrated with woodcuts that is in fact a reproduction of an astrological diary of the kind used in Asia Minor: the Astrolabium Magnum, edited by the German scholar Engel, and first printed by Ratdolt in Ausburg in 1488. Yet the book was written by a world-famous Italian, Pietro d'Abano, the Paduan Faust of the Trecento, a contemporary of Dante and Giotto. ... And the book's journey can once again be followed all the way down to Pietro d'Abano; having made its way from Asia Minor, via Egypt, to India, the Sphaera landed (probably via Persia), in the aforementioned Introductorium majus [Great Introduction] of Abū Aā'sār, which then was translated into Hebrew by a Spanish Jew, Aben Esra (who died in 1167). The Hebrew translation was then translated in turn into French in Mecheln, by the Jewish scholar Hagins for the English-man, Henry Bates. And this French translation was finally the source of a Latin version completed in 1293 by Pietro d'Abano. The book was frequently reprinted ...."
(16) Renaissance period fresco cycles
One of the sources of astrological imagery of the Renaissance was the Sphaera Barbarica. The Egyptian iconography of the decans in Introductorium maius finally became embedded in the book Astrolabium planum by Pietro d'Abano (a famous Italian physician, philosopher, and astrologer; circa 1257-circa 1316). The 14th-century CE program of decoration of the so-called Salone (begun in 1306) in the Palazzo della Ragione (Padua's massive secular and civil centre) was inspired by the Sphaera Barbarica and astrological concepts in Astrolabium planum. (An early appearance in Europe of the Sphaera Barabarica was also the small book Astrolabium magnum (1448) by Pietro d'Abano.) Later, the Sphaera Barbarica and astrological concepts in Astrolabium planum also played an important role in the decoration (begun in 1470) of the Salone dei Mesi at the Palazzo Schifanoia (Schifanoja) in Ferrara (commissioned by Duke Borso d'Este and executed by Farrarese artists led by the painter Cosimo Tura). At the beginning of the 15thcentury Padua was a great centre of astrological culture. The fresco cycle of the months in the Schifanoia Palace is unique of its kind, such is its range and complexity: it contains a triple register of allegories, astrological decans and scenes of court life. The fresco cycle (a pictorial calendar in which each of the 12 months were personified as 1 of the 12 main Roman gods) is located in the great hall. Aby Warburg ("Italienische Kunst und internationale Astrologie im Palazzo Schifanoja zu Ferrara" (1912)) identified that the 15th-century frescoes of constellations with their decans in the Palazzo Schifanoja - based on the calendar illustrations that were in frequent use in Northern European manuscripts - were ultimately those of the Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus the Babylonian. (According to another source the fresco cycle was identified by Aby Warburg as going back to the Roman astrologer Manilius.) Seven of the 12 original wall areas survive in good condition, and traces of the other five are more or less visible. (The series of allegorical frescoes in each building each depict the concept of the "yearly astrological cycle" and comprise a compendium of symbolic, astrological, religious, scientific, and philosophical beliefs of the Middle Ages.)
(17) The discussion by Joseph Scalinger of Manilius' Sphaera Babarica
The belief of the Renaissance chronologist Joseph Scalinger that Book 5 of Marcus Manilius' work Astronomica was derived from the Sphaera Barbarica was shown by Boll in his Sphaera to be a (typically) confused description of the Greek sphere mixed/mingled with 'barbaric' doctrine. (Scalinger's 1st edition of Manilius was published in 1579.) However, the French scholar Joseph Scalinger (15401609, born in Agen, southern France, into the family of an Italian scholar and physician), in his 2nd edition (commentary) of Manilius (1600) (effectively a treatise on ancient astronomy), began the investigation of the Sphaera Barbarica on the basis of a version preserved in the writings of Rabbi Araham Ibn Ezra (1092-1167) - who had derived it from the writings of Abū Ma'shar.) It has been remarked that Scalinger over-simplified the problem of the Sphaera Barbarica. He believed it to comprise merely of the paranatellonta and 'clarae stellae' (of the zodiac) of the Greek sphere as seen in Egypt. He overlooked his own quotation from Nigidius Figulus that stated it included non-Greek constellations.
(18) The recovery by Franz Boll of the Sphaera Barbarica
It was Franz Boll who discovered and reconstructed the history of the passage of the Sphaera Barbarica. Franz Boll, in his book Sphaera (1903), had undertaken to study the reception of Greek astronomy in middle eastern culture and to reconstruct the lost work on the Sphaera barbarica by Teukros. Later, it was Aby Warburg who first recognised the resurgence of the Sphaera Barbarica in the imagery of the Renaissance period. Perhaps the next most important study of the Sphaera Barbarica is the monograph-length study forming the last section of the Introduction to the book Catalogue of Astrological and Mythological Illuminated Manuscripts of the Latin Middle Ages, III, Volumes 1-2: Manuscripts in English Libraries by Fritz Saxl and Hans Meier, Edited by Harry Bober (1953, 2 Volumes). (Other scholars are currently working on additional volumes.)
The first major modern work devoted to elucidating the Sphaera Barbarica was the classic book-length study Sphaera by the German philologist Franz Boll (1903). The masterly work Sphaera, published in 1903, was Franz Boll's ingenious recovery of the Sphaera Barbarica, based on the discovery of new manuscripts. Boll became aware of the Sphaera Barbarica through the discovery of excerpta (brief segments of writing taken from longer works) from the Byzantine period. He ingeniously reconstructed the Sphaera Barbarica and also traced the major stages of its journey to the Islamic Persian Empire and back to Europe.

It was Aby Warburg who first recognised the resurgence of the Sphaera Barbarica in the imagery of the Renaissance period. Aby Warburg's study, Heidnisch-antike Weissagung in Wort und Bild zu Luthers Zeiten (1920) was a ground-breaking assessment of the role of astronomical iconography in the Renaissance. Decanal images at the Palazzo Schifanoia and the Palazzo della Ragione were first studied by Aby Warburg. With the help of certain types of historical astrological texts Warburg succeeded in explaining the enigmatic cycle of frescoes from the 15th-century in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. Aby Warburg's iconographical analysis of frescos in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara showed that they represented the signs of the zodiac and their divisions into 36 decans. His most famous paper, "Italienische Kunst und internationale Astrologie im Palazzo Schifanoja zu Ferrara" was delivered at the height of his career to the 10th Art-Historical Congress in Rome in October, 1912. Following his pioneering work Warburg (an independent Privatgelehrter = independent/(private scholar)) explained his discovery that each of the 3 figures marking each month are decans. The Indian decans of Abū Ma'shar dominate the central plane (of frescoes) in the Palazzo Schifanoia. (See: Die Erneuerung der heidnischen Antike (1932) by Aby Warburg.) The Warburg scholar Eugenio Garin in his short book, Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life (1983)) has provided a fuller understanding of astrology in the Renaissance. See also the important study: La Tirannia degli astri: Aby Warburg e l'astrologia di Palazzo Schifanoia (1985) by M. Bertozzi.
Note: For a critical discussion of the speculative and erroneous ideas of Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl on proposed paths of transmission of planetary iconography/iconographical tradition (uncritically re-stated by Jean Seznec in his Survival of the Pagan Gods (1940)) see the first critical analysis in Regenten des Himmels by Dieter Blume (2000). Also, Duits, Rembrandt. (2005). "Celestial Transmissions. An Iconographical Classification of Constellation Cycles in Manuscripts (8th-15th Centuries)." (Scriptorium, Volume 59, Pages 147202); and Duits, Rembrandt. (2011). "Reading the Stars: Fritz Saxl and Astrology." (Journal of Art Historiography, Number 5, December, Pages 1?-18?). Also, Duits, Rembrandt. and Quiviger, François. (Editors). (2009). Images of the Pagan Gods: Papers of a Conference in Memory of Jean Seznec. [Note: "Research in astrological manuscripts has always been one of the strong points of the Warburg Institute (already true by the time of Aby Warburg's 1912 Rome conference): thus, it comes as no surprise that a considerable part of the publication is dedicated to it. Duits's presentation of illustrated constellation cycles revisits Saxl's thesis and, in the light of new research, concludes that instead of "a consistent set of classical constellation images . . . it appears that there were different parallel and sometimes intertwining traditions" (100). In a less nuanced way, Kristen Lippincott, who studies the constellation of Eridanus, discards expediently altogether all previous work and Dieter Blume, in his paper on planetary astrology, is equally blunt: "there was in fact no survival of the pagan gods" (136).

(20) Failure of the Sphaera Barbarica to take hold in Latin Europe
The Sphaera Barbarica did not obtain wide popularity in western Europe and interest in it remained within the domain of specialist scholars. There were 3 different iconographic schemes for illustrated versions of the Sphaera Barbarica. The most common iconographic scheme involved the depiction of the Persian, Indian, and Graeco-Roman spheres in separate strips placed one above the other. (MS M.785 (A Latin translation, circa 1400, of a work originating from Abū Ma'shar) now in the Pierpont Morgan Library is a typical example. The Sphaera Persica (i.e., Sphaera Barbarica) appears in the top register, the Sphaera Indica appears in the middle register, and the Sphaera Graeca appears in the lower register.) This artistic tradition originated with manuscripts produced in southern Italy in the 12th-century CE and continued through to the 15th-century CE. The illustrations accompanied the translated Latin text of Introductorium maius by Abū Ma'shar and were primarily for manuscripts made for the (educated and/or wealthy) layperson.

Appendix 1: Franz Boll and Sphaera (1903)
It was Franz Boll who discovered and reconstructed the history of the passage of the Sphaera Barbarica. The first major modern work devoted to elucidating the Sphaera Barbarica was the classic book-length study Sphaera by the German philologist Franz Boll (1903). (The word "Sphaera" refers to the celestial sphere, the map of the night sky. The title is plural because 2 sky maps existed in GraecoRoman antiquity - the Greek and the Barbarian.)
Boll's most important and most outstanding work is perhaps Sphaera (1903). It is still an important work on ancient and Arabic astrology. The masterly work Sphaera was Franz Boll's ingenious recovery of the Sphaera Barbarica, based on the discovery of new manuscripts. Boll became aware of the Sphaera Barbarica through the discovery of excerpta (brief segments of writing taken from longer works) from the Byzantine period. Boll became aware of the Sphaera Barbarica through the discovery of excerpta (brief segments of writing taken from longer works) from the Byzantine period. In Sphaera Boll published and annotated the texts of then newly discovered Classical and Byzantine astronomical/astrological manuscripts by Teukros the Babylonian, Antiochus of Athens, Vettius Valens, and Johannes Kamateros, a 12th-century Byzantium astrologer.
He ingeniously reconstructed the Sphaera Barbarica and also traced the major stages of its journey from Ptolemaic Egypt and Babylon to the Islamic Persian Empire (in Persian manuscripts translated into Arabic) and back to Latin Europe (retranslated into Latin). Boll recognised the contributions of Teukros the Babylonian to constellation lore ahead of his contemporaries. The first part of the book is a critical discussion of the newly discovered texts, the second part describes the constellations in them, and the third part deals with the history of the "Sphaera Barbarica" as described by Nigidius Figulus and others. In Sphaera Boll first described the genre of paranatellonta writing and edited much of the material. The sphaera barbaric was identified by the German philologist/classicist Franz Boll (Sphaera, 1903) as describing the genre of paranatellonta.

Appendix 2: Teucrus/Teucer and the Sphaera Barbarica
Teucrus 'of Babylon' lived in the 1st-century CE. Teucer of Babylon was an ancient Egyptian astrologer. Teucrus is called "the Babylonian" by the Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry of Tyre (circa 270 CE) and by subsequent writers. The writings of Teucrus are known only through excerpts preserved in later astrological works. Their historical importance was first fully recognised by the German classicist/philologist Franz Boll in his important book Sphaera (1903).
The Sphaera Barbarica were mostly based on the writings of Teucrus. He made a register of stars that rose to the north and south of each zodiacal sign. Teucrus' work was very important in the transmission of the astrological system of the Decans, i.e. the subdivision of the Zodiac into 36 Decans, each one 10 degree, three per constellation, and also of the so-called Paranatellonta (i.e. the constellations rising on the horizon simultaneously with a certain Decan).
The Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus survived in the form of a Greek manuscript with partial contents, the Arabic work of Abū Ma'shar, Kitab al-mudkhal al-kabir ila 'ilm ahkam an-nujjum [Great Introduction], and Arab-Islamic star catalogs and lapidaria. Teucrus' work was translated in Pahlavi for the first time about the 3rd-century or later. Unfortunately the Pahlavi translation is lost and only a number of fragments in Arabic still survive. A Middle Persian translation of Teucrus was written or probably rearranged in the 6thcentury (precisely 542) under Xusraw Anōširwān. This very translation was used by Abū Mashˁar together with Indian sources about the iconography of the Decans deriving from the Indian astronomer Varāha Mihira (6th-century CE), taken in its turn from the Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja (3rd-century CE), a Sanskrit translation of a Greek-Alexandrian astrological text. Some Pahlavi material from Teucrus was probably embedded in the Introductorium Maius of Abū Mashˁar, and via such a translation they returned to Byzantium and the West. It has been shown that the Egyptian iconography of the Decans, intermingled with Indian and Sasanian modifications, was transferred through the Arabic Introductorium Maius to Spain, then to France and finally was embedded in the Astrolabium Planum of Pietro d'Abano.
According to Aby Warburg, writing on the Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus: "This work is nothing more than a description of the fixedstar heaven, which with the addition of star names from Egypt, Babylonia, and Asia Minor, surpasses the star catalog of Aratus almost three times over. ... The Sphara Barbarica of Teukros comes down to us in yet another form , corresponding to the surviving Greek text [of Teucrus' Sphaera Barbarica], a form arranged according to decans, that is, thirds of months, each of which encompasses ten degrees of the respective zodiacal sign. This type came to the western Middle Ages via the star catalogs and lapidaria (books of precious stones) of the Arabs. So the "Great Introduction" of Abū Aā'sār (who died in 886), the main authority for medieval astrology, contains a synopsis of three different conceptions of the fixed-star heaven, each apparently quite peculiar and belonging to a different nation. Closer examination reveals, however, that these disparate parts can all be traced back to the Greek Sphaera of Teukros, expanded by barbaric additions."
The Sphaera Barbarica with its elements of paranatellonta (the system of constellations "which accompany" certain points of the ecliptic in the north and south = the constellations rising on the horizon simultaneously with a certain decan) and Dōdekaōros (the system of subdivision of each zodiac sign into 3 parts (10 degrees of the ecliptic) - making a system of 36 "decans" according to which 3 "paranatellonta" were attached to each sign of the zodiac) gained fixed form in the 1st-century CE(BCE?) in the Sphaera Barbarica devised by Teucer of Babylon (Egypt?). Paranatellonta are stars or star groups that are viewed as attendants. In ancient astrology the term was applied to the constellations that rose with the zodiacal decans. Teucer is supposed to have lived in the 1st-centuryCE(BCE?). The Sphaera Barbarica of Teucrus/Teucer also established the subdivision of each zodiac sign into 3 parts (10 degrees of the ecliptic), each subdivision (= the decans) controlled/ruled over by specific gods/goddesses of ancient Egyptian or Asiatic origin (Mesopotamian, or Persian, or Indian).
A fragmentary list attributed to Teucrus/Teucer associates each of the zodiacal signs with a specific country. As example: The Ram represents Persia, and the He-goat represents Syria. To date the connection of the signs of the zodiac with particular countries is unattested in the 2nd-century CE.
Franz Boll (Sphaera, 1903) showed the features of the Sphaera Babarica of Teucrus included the Hades-constellations being found around Sagittarius and Scorpius.
Appendix 3: Nigidius Figulus
Publius Nigidius Figulus held public office as an aedile and later as practor or magistrate. (Aedile was an office of the Roman Republic. Based in Rome, the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings and regulation of public festivals. They also had powers to enforce public order.) Circa 60 BCE he started/was at the centre of the first school of astrology in Rome (indeed the earliest Roman astrological school) and published books on astrological prediction and meteorology. Julius Caesar when he came to power banished him for political reasons. Marcus Terentius Varro (116-27 BCE) the greatest Roman scholar and an incredibly prolific writer was a colleague of Figulus but not an astrologer.
We owe most of our knowledge of the non-Greek constellations and star names from extant fragments of Figulus' work(s) on the subject. Figulus seems to have dealt methodically with both the 'Greek' and 'Barbaric' spheres, describing also their mythological and astrological characteristics/features.
A book quoted by Nigidius Figulus under the title of Sphaera Barbarica ("Sky-map of the Foreigners" i.e., the Babylonians and Egyptians) gave for each of the 360° of the ecliptic the astral forecasts based on the character of the stars "rising together" (paranatellontes).
Appendix 4: Daivajna Varāhamihira and the Sphaera Indica
Daivajna Varāhamihira (505-587 CE) was an Indian astronomer, (outstanding) mathematician, and astrologer who lived most of his life in Ujjain. The Indian sphaera is attested in Chapter 27 of the Brhajjātaka (a treatise on astronomy and horoscopic astrology) written by Daivajna Varāhamihira. Varāhamihira was Abū Ma'shar's unnamed influential source for information on the decans and their gods.

(Franz Boll showed that prior to the 6th-century CE knowledge of the Egyptian decans had reached India.) Abū Ma'shar's Kitāb almadkhal al-kabīr contains Indian material and is one of the principle conduits for the transmission of genuine Indian astrological doctrines to the West. It contains information about Indian terms and decans. It has been determined by David Pingree (1963 paper) that Varāhamihira's decan descriptions are a mixture of those of the decans and horās (Vedic jyotish unit of time, the Egyptian decans were sidereal gods of time) in the Yavanajätaka of Sphujidhvaja. Pingree also determined that these decans and horās are misinterpretations (influenced by Śaivite iconography) of the Greco-Egyptian pictures in a Greek manuscript translated into Sanskrit by Yavaneśvara in 149/150 CE.
Appendix 5: Aby Warburg
In the early 20th-century Germany Aby Warburg (1866–1929) and his followers Fritz Saxl (1890–1948) and Erwin Panofsky (18921968) built on, and expanded, the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to that of using iconography as a means to understanding meaning. Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 book Studies in Iconology, where he defined particular definitions - "iconography" (the identification of visual content) and "iconology" (the analysis of the meaning of that content). In the USA, where Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as Frederick Hartt, and Meyer Schapiro continued his ideas. In an influential 1942 article, Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture", Richard Krautheimer, another German émigré and a specialist on early medieval churches, extended iconographical analysis to architectural forms.

15: Farnese celestial globe
The Farnese Atlas. Once the only known celestial globe surviving from classical antiquity. The Farnese Atlas is an incomplete globe of the known sky. The term Atlas to describe any representation of the celestial sphere or terrestrial globe derives from the Farnese Atlas.
An early surviving depiction of the Classical Greek constellations that is substantially complete is the Farnese celestial globe (commonly called the Farnese Atlas (The Atlante Farnese)). (Images of the individual

stars are not shown.) It is a large decorative, free-standing, celestial globe, sculptured in raised relief. It is the only large celestial globe surviving from antiquity. It has been restored in the mid 16th-century from a damaged condition. It is basically a statue of the figure of Atlas in a kneeling position holding a celestial globe on his back (i.e., between his shoulders). (It is the oldest surviving statue of Atlas in existence.) Atlas is bearded, has a cloak draped over his left shoulder, and is holding the globe with both hands. The position of the hands serve to obscure part of the globe. (The sculpture is 2.1 metres tall and the diameter of the globe is 65 centimetres.) According to astronomer/historian Ed. Krupp the globe also symbolises the cosmic axis around which the heavens turn.
According to the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, the figure of the Atlas Farnese was originally placed in the library of the Trajan Forum in Rome.
The Atlas Farnese can be viewed as marking the beginning of a new approach to Atlas iconography. Atlas was originally depicted as a young Titan standing upright and shouldering the firmament (not the celestial globe) at the Western of the four corners of the (flat) earth. With the Atlas Farnese the figure of Atlas is depicted as an old man on his knees lifting a globe.
On the Farnese globe the 42(41) constellations depicted (carved in reliefs) are precisely positioned against a grid of reference circles. The grid of reference circles on the Farnese globe are: the equator, the ecliptic with the zodiacal band (the zodiacal belt is a triplet of rings - the ecliptic being the middle of the 3 rings), the tropics (tropic of Capricorn, and tropic of Cancer), the colures (the solstitial colure), the Arctic circle, and the Antarctic circle. The Farnese globe was a display item and not a usable sky globe (i.e., the reference circles are drawn inexactly). The constellations depicted are consistent with the description of the sky in Aratus' Phaenomena.
The name Farnese Atlas was gained from its acquirement by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) in the early 16th-century (and its exhibition in the Palazzo Farnese (Farnese Palace) in Rome). (Cardinal Farnese was a notable collector and patron of the arts.) It is now located in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico (previously named the Royal Museum of Naples, now the National Archaeological Museum) in Naples. (I am unsure of the date when it was transferred from Rome to Naples.) The Farnese collection at this museum is rated one of the finest collections of objects of Roman antiquity in the world. The collection passed to Naples when Elizabeth Farnese (1692-1766), the Queen Consort of Spain (wife of Philip V), who owned it by inheritance, passed it on to her son, Charles, who, in 1735, became the first monarch of the new Bourbon dynasty of Naples. The extensive Farnese collection was incorporated into a budding museum at the northwest corner of the old city premises that had originally housed a cavalry barracks and then the University of Naples.
Exactly where or when it was discovered is not known It would appear that the statue was unearthed in an archaeological excavation in Rome (possibly on the Palatine Hill) in the early 16th-century. (There are an estimated 500 Roman buildings on the Palatine Hill.) What is known for certain is that Cardinal Allessandro Farnese purchased it in 1562 from the antiquarian dealer Paolo del Bufalo.
The statue is believed by art historians to be a Roman copy of an earlier (presumably) Greek original. (The duplication/reproduction of prominent works of art in antiquity is a well-known and well-documented phenomenon.) Many relationships between sculptures of the Roman period and hypothetical Greek originals have been suggested and accepted with some caveats. The style of execution of both the statue and the constellations show that it is a copy of a Hellenistic original. It is generally thought that the existing white marble sculpture was made in Rome circa 150 CE and is a late copy of a Greek original made circa 200 BCE. The classical philologist Georg Thiele proposed the Farnese Atlas was a Roman (Hadrianic, dating to between 117-138 CE) copy of a Greek original. The date of the Farnese Globe remains uncertain. (Artistically the figure of Atlas has equal important with the globe. Also, it appears the globe was not used as a functional astronomical instrument by the Romans.) In Greek mythology Atlas was sentenced by Zeus to hold up the sky.
The Farnese Atlas first came to modern notice in the early 16th-century when it became part of the antiquities collection in the Farnese Palace in Rome. There are some slightly divergent accounts concerning its recovery. One account states it had been found in a damaged condition in the late 15th-century. Another account states that it was uncovered in the ruins of ancient Rome during the course of excavations in the

mid-16th-century. The source of the Farnese Globe remains controversial. Circa 1555 it underwent extensive restorations. There is no evidence that the globe itself has been modified or reworked by this restoration work. The first detailed study of the Farnese Globe was made by the Italian astronomer and historian Francesco Bianchini (1662-1729). This study, likely carried out circa 1694-1695, remained in manuscript form. He also had detailed engravings made.
The Farnese Globe is quite austere in its details. (Note: Erwin Panofsky and Fritz Saxl write ("Classical Mythology in Mediaeval Art." Metropolitan Museum Studies, Volume 4, Number 2, March, 1933, Pages 228-280): "With the exception of the figure of Atlas, which was added in the Renaissance, it is a Roman copy of a Greek original.")
The north polar region of the celestial globe has some damage (i.e., there is a hole in the top of the globe) and so the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor are missing. The globe depicts 42(41) of the 48 classical Greek constellation figures but not the stars comprising each constellation. (some writers state only 41 constellations are depicted.) For example, Sagitta is absent from the Farnese Globe. However, the stars may have originally been painted on the globe. One of the 42 constellations is obscured by one of the hands holding the globe. The constellation figures are depicted facing outward from the perspective of an observer positioned outside the earth and looking back towards earth (rather than inward, toward the centre of the globe). This means that the constellation figures are depicted back to front (i.e., are shown inverted) in comparison to the way an observer sees them from the earth (which would be a fixed point at the centre of the sphere). Naturally the earth is not represented but would be a tiny sphere centrally located inside the celestial sphere.
The constellations, which are shown in relief, are considered inaccurately depicted. One commentator has stated the constellations are depicted with moderate accuracy. (The Farnese globe seems to be connected not with technical astronomy - but connected with the astronomical poem of Aratus of Soli. However, in his study Antike Himmelsbilder (1898) Georg Thiele denied this.) In his recent study of the Farnese globe the astronomer Dennis Duke concluded there is no reason to regard the globe being as a particularly high quality map of the constellations in the night sky. Included on the globe are a grid of traditional reference circles which include the Ecliptic (Zodiac), (Celestial) Equator, Tropics (Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn), Colures (Equinoctial Colure and the Solstitial Colure), Polar Circles (Arctic Circle (of star that never set) and Antarctic Circle (of stars that never rise). However, the First Point of Aries and the First Point of Libra do not coincide with the equinoctial colures. Also, the rectangular figure north of the zodiacal constellation Cancer appears to depict a constellation that is not mentioned by Aratus, Hipparchus, or Ptolemy. This apparently unrecorded constellation has yet to be identified.
The place of origin of the Farnese globe is uncertain but indicated to have been at a latitude of 38 degrees, which is close to the latitude of Athens and Pergamon. One modern estimate dates the statue of Atlas to 73 BCE and (from the position of the constellation figures to the globe's equinox) dates the constellation figures to circa 370 BCE. The interpretation of this dating is the celestial globe is probably a decorative attempt to depict the constellation figures described (circa 275 BCE) by Aratus in his astronomical poem Phainomena. The American astronomer Bradley Schaefer has recently announced (January 2005) his analysis of the globe and concluded that the date of the constellations depicted is indicated as circa 125 BCE. He believes this analysis has been strengthened by comparing the constellation figures with Hipparchus' Commentary. Schaefer's conclusion is that the constellation figures on the Farnese Atlas are an accurate depiction of Hipparchus' lost star catalog. Whilst Schaefer's work and conclusions has drawn some sharp criticisms it has been the belief of a number of scholars that the Farnese globe probably embodies the astronomy of both Eudoxus and Hipparchus.
If constructed, no celestial map has survived from ancient Mesopotamia. Likewise, no celestial map has survived from ancient Greece. A number of celestial globes have survived from the Roman period. These are based on Greek uranography. According to the astronomer and researcher Susanne Hoffmann there are several hints pointing to uranographies in both cultures. The Mesopotamian scheme of uranography used what may be termed equatorial coordinates. The Greek scheme of uranography used ecliptical coordinates.
There are only three celestial globes which survive from Graeco-Roman times. All three globes reproduce all or most of the constellations known in Graeco-Roman culture. These are: (1) the Farnese Globe; (2) the Mainz Globe; and (3) the Kugel Globe. Of these only the Farnese Globe is a large globe. Both the Mainz

Globe and the Kugel Globe are miniature globes. Also existing are the Stuttgart Celestial Globe and the Berlin Celestial globe (fragment Sk 1050 A). It is currently believed that Archimedes celestial globe from the 3rd-century BCE has not come down to us. However, the work of Dr. Ulrich Kühne (2011) on fragment Sk 1050 A might indicate otherwise (See the discussion: Page 11-16). Basically, the globes are the only visual records of the constellations, to survive from antiquity.
The Farnese Globe, dated circa 150 CE, but likely based on the constellations as depicted in the 2nd-century BCE, is discussed above. The Farnese Globe is the largest of the celestial globes surviving from Classical antiquity. A number of constellations are either damaged or missing. However, the Farnese Globe is the archetypal model for the constellation illustrations. Georg Thiele, Antike Himmelsbilder (1898), demonstrated a direct link the constellations depicted on the Farnese Globe and those found in the earliest surviving Aratean manuscripts. As example: The 9th-century Germanicus translation in the Leiden manuscript, and the 2 early 9th-century Aratus latinus manuscripts.
The Mainz Globe is dated to circa 150-220 CE. It is a small brass globe that was acquired circa 1997 by the Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum in Mainz (Germany). It is believed to have originated in Roman Egypt. It is a complete celestial globe in that it depicts all 48 Classical constellations with relative precision. It originally formed part of a sundial and was positioned on top of the gnomon. The entire Milky Way is depicted on the Mainz Globe and this is the first complete depiction known.
The Kugel Globe is dated circa 300-100 BCE. It may be the earliest celestial globe to survive from Classical antiquity. It is a small globe made of silver and is held in the Gallery J. Kugel Antiquaries in Paris (France). It was acquired circa 1996. It is thought to have originated as a copy of an existing sphere that had been repaired. This is because it appears to have reproduced the repair rivets on the original globe in the mistaken belief that they were celestial symbols. This would indicate that the artisan who made the copy was not knowledgeable in astronomy.
Appendix 1: The Farnese Atlas image with the fig-leaf add-on
Regarding the image of the Farnese Atlas depicted above. The exact origin of the electronic image remains unknown. The image appears as Plate IIa in Le Ciel des Romains by André Le Boeuffle (1989). However, with the exception of the fig-leaf add-on the image matches Tafel II in Antike Himmelsbilder by Georg Thiele (1898). The Farnese Atlas photographs appearing in this book were taken by the Berlin-based photographer Paul Schahl. The image above was possibly derived, either directly or indirectly, from Paul Schahl's photograph in the book, or his photograph was perhaps accessed from another source. The date of modification of an original photograph, by way of adding-on the fig-leaf, remains unsolved but is most likely quite modern (and perhaps original to Boeuffle's 1989 book). The solution would depend on confirming the particular photographic source for the modification and scanned image. A likely source is the (unmodified) photograph of the Farnese Atlas, comprising Plate 19, in La Science Antique et Mediévale edited by René Taton (1957). However, this is credited to the Italian firm of art photographers Fratelli Alineri (established in Florence in 1852 by, as the name indicates, the Alineri Brothers). It is a match for the photograph comprising Tafel II in Thiele's book. (The Farnese Atlas image with the fig-leaf add-on has been published in the wellknown American monthly astronomical magazine Sky and Telescope.)
Appendix 2: Early surviving depictions of Greek constellations?

Early Greek astronomy is known primarily through its literary sources. There are only a very few surviving depictions in Greek classical art of their constellations. There are also Roman mosaics showing the constellations. A constellation depiction survives from Harran, a major ancient city in upper Mesopotamia, located on the west bank of the Balikh River. Pottery depicting constellations has been recovered from the ancient city of Rayy (Iran). Rayy dates back to circa 300 BCE. The constellation depictions were likely due to the influence of immigration of Greek and Macedonian settlers following the military conquests of Alexander the Great.
To know how the pre-Classical Greeks viewed the night sky (i.e., before Aratus) researchers must rely on visual depictions of the sky, such as those found on ceramic pottery. However, these artifacts are relatively rare, and what has been recovered through excavation generally only show one or two constellations. Also, these earliest Greek artistic representations of constellations are fragmentary and can be problematic in terms of what they represent.
Scenes located in the sky are not uncommon in late Archaic (540-480 BCE) and Classical (480-323 BCE) Greek art, primarily in krater (large vase) painting, and are mostly indicated by the presence of stars as locational devices. However, these scenes are most usually mythological only in nature. They do not directly depict constellations or reflect the physical realities of the sky.
Amongst the Greeks, Romans, and Etruscans, the depiction of constellations, the sun, the moon, and the planets, when represented in human form are surrounded by either luminous rays or by luminous circles (nimbi and aureoles).
"The scenes of myth and daily life that decorate Athenian vases often have a pronounced sense of time, which is depicted in simple pictorial terms that are meant to be easily recognized. Night, for instance, can be signified with lamps, torches, and the presence of the appropriate nocturnal deities, Selene the moon goddess, and Nyx, the very personification of night. Similarly, Helios the sun god and Eos the goddess of dawn indicate daytime. The great frequency of temporal motifs on vases suggests that time was integral to the narrative construction of many vase paintings. Moreover, the deliberate references to time on Athenian vases can often be explained as an essential feature of the specific subject portrayed." (Source: Udell, Jennifer. "Time of Day on Painted Athenian Vases". In: Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 –. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/time/hd_time.htm (October 2004))
An early identification of a (non allegorical) constellation on a Greek vase (sherd from a krater ("large vase")?) is given by Samuel Birch on Page 346 of his book History of Ancient Pottery (1858) : "The constellation Pegasus appears once with the moon." Seemingly, another reference (but possibly otherwise) to this states the example, possibly one of the oldest constellation images from Greece, comes from a pottery (krater ("large vase")) fragment from the Late Geometric period (760 to 700 BCE) found at Pithekoussai on the island of Ischia in Italy, but it only depicts what may be the constellation Boötes ("the Herdsman"). (George Huxley, philologist, Professor at Queen's University, Belfast, has tentatively identified it with the constellation Boötes. See: Coldstream, J[ohn]. N. and Huxley, G[eorge]. L. (1996). "An Astronomical Graffito from Pithekoussai." (Parola de Passato, Volume 51, Pages 221-224).)
Another fragment of pottery, dating to the 5th- or 4th-century BCE, excavated at Canosa (southern Italy, a pottery centre for pottery made for the Greek market) depicts a bull and the stern of a ship and has been interpreted as the constellations Taurus and Argo.
In 2014, John Barnes, a classical archaeology doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri analysed a two-handled wine cup on display at the Lamia Archaeological Museum in Greece and believes it depicts one of the earliest Greek depictions of the constellations. This item of ancient pottery (dating to 625 BCE), called a skyphos, has long been thought to depict a random assortment of animals. The artifact, which dates back to 625 B.C., was originally discovered in a debris-filled trench next to a temple in the 7th-century BCE acropolis of Halai, which is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Thebes, Greece. About a third of the wine cup (the base area including one handle) is missing. The skyphos depicts an array of animals: a bull (with only the back half preserved), a snake, a hare or small dog, a large dog, a scorpion, a dolphin and the

front half of a panther or lion. The skyphos is displayed with a label stating a simple animal scene is shown. John Barnes believes it is more likely that the animals are constellations: The bull is Taurus; the snake is probably Hydra (rather than Serpens or Draco, two other serpent constellations recognized by the Greeks); the rabbit is Lepus; the dog is Canis Major or Canis Minor; the scorpion is Scorpius; the dolphin is Delphinus; and the lion is Leo. However, the animals are not arranged on the skyphos in the order they appear in the sky. See: "Asteras Eipein: An Archaic View of the Constellations from Halai." by John Barnes (Hesperia, Volume 83, Number 2, 2014, Pages 257-276).
Too few Greek artifacts have survived to enable the history of the development of constellation figures to be traced.

16: Roman celestial globes
Early Greek and Roman Celestial Globes
In the Roman world astronomical knowledge was considered only a tool that would produce tangible/practical results and benefits for everyday life. There is little doubt that astronomy played a significant role in many aspects of Roman life.One of the fields of practical application of astronomical knowledge was the measurement of time. One of the best-known manifestations of Roman astronomy is the Julian calendar. Land surveyors, employed all over the empire with simple instruments, needed good astronomical knowledge: this is clear from surviving surveyors' manuals. Other topics instruct the navigators of commercial ships in navigating by the stars. Sundials were in common use for telling the hour of the day: over thirty were recovered in Pompeii alone. During the Roman Empire astronomy did not progress any further than than the knowledge of the Greeks. After Ptolemy (Ptolemaic Kingdom based in ancient Egypt), the end of Hellenistic civilisation also meant the end of Greek astronomy. The merit of Rome was simply that it enabled the dissemination of Greek thought throughout the vast territory of the Empire.
A celestial globe is a 3-dimensional map of the stars. A celestial globe shows the apparent position of the stars in the sky. They have been used since classical times and were produced initially by Greek astronomers. The beginning of construction of celestial globes can hardly be earlier than the existence of a spherical theory of the heavens. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE) proved that the earth was round. Over 100 years later the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-194 BCE) is said to have calculated the circumference of the earth with considerable accuracy.
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes constructed the first celestial globe on record, but it is believed other celestial globes had existed before it. (An extensive discussion of Hipparchus' use of a celestial globe appears in Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume XXIX, 1984, Pages 201-236; and Volume XL, 1989, Pages 305-354.) The 5th- and 4th- centuries BCE saw the introduction of celestial mapping in Greece including celestial globes. (The origin of sphere-making is dated by James Evans to the time of Plato (circa 425 BCE - circa 345 BCE) with its wider diffusion being due to the popularity of Aratus' Phaenomena.) The ancient Greek (and later) astronomers drew the constellations on globes both in sky-view and in rear-view that is, with the observers inside or outside the globe - and sometimes even on the same globe. This was also done with descriptions of the constellations in ancient texts.
Allusions to the existence of celestial globes date to the Greek scientists Eudoxus of Cnidos (circa 409-356 BCE) and Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287-212 BCE). Likely the constellations were represented/depicted by the characters and animals representing them. The early Greek astronomers and philosophers constructed 3-dimensional models; brightly coloured celestial globes, and mechanical representations of the workings of the moving sky. Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE) also constructed a mechanical planetarium of the known celestial system (which was later much admired by educated Romans). It appears that Eudoxus of Cnidus was the first to draw the constellations on a globe representing the sky seen from the outside looking inwards, rather than as seen by an observer on the earth looking outwards (together with the main celestial circles).

The Greek philosopher Anaximander of Miletus (circa first half of the 6th-century BCE) taught that the sky was a globe and possibly invented the celestial globe. It appears the actual term used was 'sphere.' Diogenes Laertius wrote that Anaximander of Miletus had made a sphere. Radim Kocandrle has made the point (2012) that unfortunately, the meaning of the term 'sphere' is not made clear. We do not know whether it was an armillary sphere (model), a celestial globe, or a drawing, or whether the term sphere is only due to an anachronism of later authors. There is simply no certainty that star globes existed before the time of Eudoxus, i.e., existed with Thales of Miletus and Anaximander of Miletus.
The Roman writer Cicero (a statesman, lawyer, and philosopher) (106-43 BCE) in On the Republic quoting (from 166 BCE) Gaius Gallus, a Roman consul and astronomical writer) states that the (Pre-Socratic) philosopher Thales of Miletus (6th-century BCE) constructed a celestial globe. However, this seems improbable. Though there is really no positive statement for such in ancient literature it is thought that Eudoxus likely constructed a celestial globe. Also, some brief references exist about some ancient planetariums. The early writers Cicero (On the Republic) and Ovid (a Roman poet) (43 BCE-17/18 CE) (Fasti (= The Calendar) state that Archimedes (287-212 BCE) constructed a celestial globe and also a mechanical planetarium. The celestial globe was marked with the constellations and stars and the mechanical planetarium had the ability to imitate the motions of the sun, moon, and 5 "wandering stars" (= planets) as viewed from the earth. By turning a crank handle the apparent "natural" course of the sun, moon, and 5 planets around the earth could be observed. Cicero (quoting Gaius Gallus from 166 BCE) relates that after the Roman conquest of Syracuse (Sicily) in 212 BCE the Roman consul Marcellus (who led the conquest) brought both globes to Rome. The celestial globe was placed in the Temple of Virtue and the mechanical planetarium was kept by Marcellus. (In the particular passage in the De re publica (On the Republic) Cicero is writing of a discussion that takes place among a group of learned Romans in 129 BCE. One member of the group relates an incident in 166 BCE involving the Roman consul Gaius Gallus at the home of Marcus Marcellus, the grandson of the Roman consul Marcellus who conquered Sicily in 212 BCE.)
An important contribution to the knowledge of sphere- making is provided by the Antikythera mechanism, discovered in an ancient shipwreck in 1901. This discovery clarifies not only how mechanics was used in the construction of the spheres, but also some details of the ancient lunar theory, as developed from Hipparchus to Ptolemy.
"Furthermore, one of Archimedes' most admired technical achievements in antiquity was his Planetarium (Orrery). Detailed information on this object has been handed down to us through Cicero's writings, where he narrates that in the year 212 B.C., when Syracuse was sacked by the Roman troops, Consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus brought to Rome a device built by the Syracusan mathematician which reproduced the vault of heaven on a sphere and another device that represented the apparent motion of the Sun, Moon and Planets, hence the equivalent of a modern planetarium. In his report of the impressions of Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, who could personally observe the extraordinary object, Cicero remarks how Archimedes' genius was able to generate the motions of the planets, so different from each other, starting from a single rotation. Thanks to the account of Pappus of Alexandria, we know that Archimedes had described the construction of the planetarium in On Sphere-Making, a work now lost. Attesting to the complexity of the early mechanisms built to represent the motion of the celestial bodies, the Antikythera Mechanism revived interest in Archimedes's Planetarium (Orrery). But a gear brought to light in Olbia in Sardinia in July 2006 especially aroused the attention of scholars, as it was probably to be identified with a device that belonged to the same Planetarium of the Syracusan mathematician. The first results of the studies on the object were presented to the public in a conference organized in April 2011 by the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali. According to a first reconstruction, the planetarium, which was presumably handed down to the descendants of the conqueror of Syracuse, might have been lost at Olbia before the wreck of the ship taking Marcus Claudius Marcellus to Numidia. The gear, dated from between the end of the 3rd century and the mid-2nd century B.C., although made at an earlier date than the other mechanisms discovered so far, shows gear teeth which are extraordinarily similar to that of the mechanical components of a contemporary device." (From book review (Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2012.01.14) by Anna Toscano, Università degli Studi di Milano, of The Great Archimedes by Mario Geymonat (2010).)
Cicero recorded the tradition that Eudoxus had constructed a star globe that accurately depicted the constellations. (It is thought that Eudoxus was the first Greek to make a comprehensive star map and place it on a globe.) Based on this it is concluded by some persons that Aratus used the star globe of Eudoxus, plus his works (the Mirror, and the Phaenomena) describing/consolidating the constellations, as guides for his

poetic description of the positions and appearances of the constellations. The most significant impulse for the representation of celestial figures on a celestial globe came from the astronomical poem Phainomena by Aratus of Soli (circa first half of the 3rd-century BCE). Decorative celestial globes were produced to illustrate and explain the astronomical poem.
Both the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus of Rhodes (born Nicaea) (circa 190-120 BCE) and the Hellenic astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (circa 90-170 CE) used mounted celestial globes.
A small bronze coin (in the British Museum) from Roman Bithynia (a territory northwest of Asia Minor (now in Turkey) shows Hipparchus seated before a small celestial globe. Depictions of Hipparchus on coins (made in his honour) from Roman Bithynia were common for the 2nd-century BCE. (This supports the tradition that Hipparchus was born in Bithynia.)
The purely scientific celestial globes of the ancient Greeks and Romans were mostly constructed of wood. They were constructed with the key celestial circles, a dark blue background to represent the night sky, and the stars were indicated by their apparent brightness and colour. The apparent magnitude of stars was represented by discs of 6 different sizes and their colour by either red or yellow.
Rudimentary celestial globes, both large and small, appear as a symbol on coins and art work to identify Urania, the Roman Muse of Astronomy. Common depictions of Urania show her holding an apple-sized celestial globe in one of her hands. In other depictions (i.e., on mosaic pavements) Urania is depicted standing beside a globe resting on a stand with a pointer held in an outstretched hand. Aratus was also depicted in similar decorative schemes. On a mosaic floor (dating to circa 40 CE) from the ancient Roman city of Mérida in Spain Aratus of Soli is depicted standing beside a celestial globe on a stand and (like Urania, the Roman muse of Astronomy) has a pointer held at arm's length and pointing toward the globe. The globe is resting on a stand comprised of 4 legs. (The city of Mérida was founded in 40 CE by Emerita Augustus to house retired legionaries. The particular mosaic was recovered in 1834 and is now on display in the Museo Nacional de Arte Romano, Mérida.)
The Romans mostly derived their uranography and star lore from the Greeks. There are only 3 relatively complete celestial globes which survive from Graeco-Roman times. All three globes reproduce all or most of the constellations known in Graeco-Roman culture. These are: (1) the well-known Farnese Globe; (2) the recently discovered (very late 20th-century) Mainz Globe; and (3) the recently discovered (very late 20thcentury) Kugel Globe. Of these only the Farnese Globe is a large globe. Both the Mainz Globe and the Kugel Globe are hollow miniature globes. (In complete contrast there are numerous surviving representations of the 12 signs of the zodiac in the art of the Graeco-Roman Period.) Deborah Warner (The Sky Explored (1979)) mentions the existence of a fragment of a metal planisphere from an anaphoric clock dating to the 2ndcentury CE. (See Appendix 2 below.)
A marble celestial globe (thought to be Roman), originally in the museum of the German town of Arolsen (now Bad [= Spa], but now owned and displayed in the Württembergisches Landesmuseum Stuttgart, and called the "Stuttgart Celestial Globe.") was discussed by Rudolph Gaedechens (1834-1904, Professor of Classical Archaeology, Jena) in his small book (57 pages) Der marmorne Himmelsglobus des fürstlich Waldeck'schen Antikenkabinettes zu Arolsen (1862). It shows the zodiacal band with a sequence of images of the zodiacal signs. Parts of the Zodiac can still be seen with Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini being identifiable, as well as the Northern constellations Triangulum, Andromeda, Perseus, and Auriga.
The Stuttgart Celestial Globe is discussed in the journal Der Globusfreund, Issues 45-46, 1998. The caption for Figure 5 (Der Globusfreund, Issues 45-46, 1998) showing the globe states: "Celestial globe. Zodiac and Jupiter's attributes (eagle, lightning). Provenance unknown. Marble. Ø 16 cm. Formerly Arolsen collection. Stuttgart Württembergisches Landesmuseum. After GAEDECHENS 1862." See also the brief discussion in: Die Antiken des Fürstlich Waldeckischen Museums zu Arolsen by Rudolph Gaedechens (1862).
Basically, the globes are the only visual records of the constellations, to survive from antiquity.
No functional celestial globes have survived from amongst the array of late classical artifacts that have come down to us. However, late classical globes were still extant in the early centuries of Islam (and serving as potential models for constellation imagery). This is testified in a report that a metal globe made by Ptolemy

himself was on exhibition to the public in Cairo library in 1043CE. Also, Ibn al-Saläh (died l154 CE) stated that he had seen a Greek celestial globe from circa 738 CE. The earliest Islamic celestial globes to survive are both from late 11th-century Valencia, although there were certainly earlier examples from which al-Sūfī (or his artist) may have taken iconographical inspiration. Al-Sufi mentions that he had seen many celestial globes, including ones made by the Harranians.
Emilie Savage-Smith wrote (Islamicate Celestial Globes (1985)): "Other artifacts from late antiquity, though not strictly celestial globes, are closely related in design if not in function. These remains include vessels for holding liquids, and zodiacal or astrological globes. Two hollow globes that served as vessels are known, one seen in AD 1888 outside a school building at Larissa, and the other a fragment of a blue marble Roman vessel with stars placed arbitrarily and with constellation figures chiseled out and originally inlaid with another material that has since fallen out. This fragment is especially interesting in that the Milky Way is indicated on it, but the placement of the constellations does not follow completely either Aratus nor Ptolemy. Four globes having only the 12 zodiacal figures decorating them are extant, including a marble one at Arolsen (160mm in diameter), which had an eagle perched on top, and a marble one (600 mm in diameter) at the Vatican, which in addition has a few decorative stars dispersed over it. The marble "astrological" globe from the third century AD found at the Dionysius theater in Athens is not a celestial globe at all, but bears various astrological and divinatory symbols. Celestial globes of the Aratean variety can be seen as a rather popular motif in frescos, statues, coins, and other works of art from the Greco-Roman world, in many cases intended probably as an allegorical representation of world or universal power."
Elly Dekker (2013) discusses the Larissa globe in considerable detail. The remains of this (90 cm diameter) bluish marble celestial globe was found in Larissa in Thessaly, Greece by B[?] Sauer in November, 1883.
Also discussed by Elly Dekker (2013) is the issues involving a celestial globe that is attributed to Hyginus (Latin author and librarian to the Emperor Augustus). The late André le Boeuffle argued that Gaius Julius Hyginus used a celestial globe when writing parts of his De Astronomia (1st-century CE).
For a speculative but interesting article see: Dimitrakoudis, Stavros. et. al. (2006). “Archaic artifacts resembling celestial spheres.” (Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry, Special Issue, Volume 16, Issue 3, Pages 93-99).

The Kugel Globe (a miniature globe (suggested to perhaps be part of an armillary sphere?)) is dated circa 300-100 BCE. It may be the earliest celestial globe to survive from Classical antiquity. It is a small globe 6.3 cm in diameter, made of gilt silver, and was acquired and held for some time in the Gallery J. Kugel Antiquaries in Paris (France). It was acquired by this Gallery circa 1996. The Kugel Globe (after the Paris antiquarian, Galarie J. Kugel), which is now in a private collection, was reportedly found alongside 2 objects dating from the 2nd century BCE. The globe was reportedly discovered in eastern Turkey, in the region of Lake Van (formerly part of Armenia). According to Elly Dekker (2013) the Kugel globe is "believed to have been found in the area of Lake Van, the largest lake in Turkey, located in the far east of the country."
The globe was first described in: Cuvigny, Hélène. (2002). "Silver Celestial Globe from Antiquity." In: Kugel, A. (Editor). Spheres. The Art of the Celestial Mechanic. (Pages 22-26).
The Kugel Globe is thought to have originated as a copy of an older existing sphere that had been repaired. This is because it appears to have reproduced the repair rivets on the original globe in the mistaken belief that they were depictions of celestial details. This would indicate that the artisan who made the copy was not knowledgeable in astronomy. The originator of the globe is unknown. Numerous aspects of the iconography and astronomy suggest a likely Hellenistic date for the globe. However, it does not follow the Graeco-Roman astronomical norms of the period as defined by the astronomer Hipparchus. The size and positions of a number of constellations are misplaced. (Also, Libra is not depicted on the Kugel Globe.) The position of the ties linking the two fish of Pisces is derived from the Catastérismes of Eratosthenes (and this iconographic tradition is also copied in the De Astronomia of Hyginus). The constellation of the Horse has no wings and be either a representation of the horse Helicon or the horse Pegasus (but without the wings). Hélène Cuvigny has suggested that the stylistic discrepancies in the representation of the constellations could mean they have been copied from different sources. Jim Fuchs has suggested that the crudely engraved (pair of) Hunting Dogs were added well after the globe was originally engraved. (If genuinely astral they represent the earliest known depiction of Boötes' dogs.) Also, the usual norm of representing the constellations has been ignored (or perhaps there was no awareness of such). Most of the constellations on the Kugel globe are the mirror image of those seen in the sky. Contrary to Hipparchan tradition, the depiction of the majority of constellations is the same as they would be seen by an observer on earth. The constellation figures (with the exception of Sagittarius) are not depicted from the perspective of an observer positioned outside the celestial sphere looking back towards earth. Consequently, the constellation figures are shown from the front - not from the back as was the usual manner of depiction. According to Elly Dekker, the Kugel globe follows the older Eudoxan tradition in globe-making - the presentation on it of the constellations in images that mirror what we see in the sky.
The Mainz Celestial Globe

The Mainz celestial globe. (This may be a photograph of a replica of the original globe.) Roman celestial globe, dated 2nd-century CE. (Mainz, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, inv. 42695D.) The globe shows the 48 Ptolemaic constellations known in the Roman period, plus the circles of the solstices and of the equinoxes. It also has the oldest known representation of the Milky Way.
The Mainz Globe (a miniature globe) is dated (by a painstaking analysis of the engraving style) to circa 150220 CE (the Roman imperial period). It is a small bronze (brass) globe, about 11 cm in diameter, that was acquired in 1996 by the Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum in Mainz (Germany). It is believed by some persons to have originated in Roman Egypt. (This identification of its place of origin is due to the single iconographic peculiarity of Aries reclining in the Zodiac.) According to Elly Dekker (2013) the Mainz globe is believed to have come from western Asia Minor. It is a complete celestial globe in that it depicts all 48 Classical constellations (but does not fully agree with the star-catalogue of Claudius Ptolemy) with relative precision. The majority of the 48 constellations depicted on the Mainz Globe correspond to those described in Ptolemy's Almagest. (Some commentators simply state that the constellations are inaccurately located on the Mainz globe.) The constellations are mostly depicted from the outside (looking toward earth). Some human constellations figures are the reverse and others the mirror images of those seen in the sky. On the Farnese Globe a number of constellations are not depicted and others are damaged. The Mainz Globe is the oldest known (and only known) complete celestial globe found to date from Graeco-Roman antiquity. Though the Mainz Globe is not a scientific work the starry sky and principal celestial circles are quite accurately depicted. There are the lines of the ecliptic, the colures, the equator, and the tropics. The zodiac is also quite accurately depicted. The longitudes of a number of stars (such as Sirius, Aldebaran, and Orion) are incorrect. It originally formed part of a sundial and was positioned on top of the gnomon. The entire Milky Way is quite accurately depicted on the Mainz Globe and this is the first (and only) complete depiction known. The outline of the Milky Way on the Mainz globe exhibits features which appear to follow closely Ptolemy's description. The originator of the globe remains unknown. Part of the value of the Mainz Globe is its value as evidence in confirming ancient references to precise celestial globes.
The Premyslid Celestial Globe

Cusanusstift Library
A wooden 13th-century CE Premyslid celestial globe has been kept at Bernkastel-Kues, a town situated on the river Mosel (Moselle) in Germany. Bernkastel is on one bank of the river Mosel and Kues is on the other bank of the river Mosel. The wooden globe is approximately 27cm in diameter and dated to the 2nd half of the 13th-century. The Pfemyslids (Přemyslids) were a Czech royal dynasty (having their origin in the 5thcentury CE) that ruled in Bohemia (which they created by uniting other small states) and Moraviar, from 895 CE until 1306 CE (the last male member died in 1306). The Premyslid celestial globe is a very precise astronomical device from 13th-century CE that has connections to the ancient Greek astronomical tradition. The wooden globe is one of the oldest surviving celestial globes from antiquity. Studies of the relevant ancient and medieval texts by the classical philologist Alena Hadravová (Research Center for the History of Sciences and Humanities), with mathematical assistance by the astrophysicist Petr Hadrava (Astronomical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), of the fragile wooden globe show: "All fourty eight Ptolemaic constellations are marked on this globe with most of the stars from the Ptolemy's star catalogue. The relations between the constellations and their parts as well as positions of the stars within them correspond with the ancient textual tradition known from the works by Aratos, Pseudo-Eratosthenes and Hyginus." The globe was part of a collection of astronomical instruments and manuscripts belonging formerly to Czech Kings from the Premyslid and Luxembourg dynasties (perhaps King Premysl Ottokar II), that was bought in 1444 by Nicolaus Cusanus. (One source mentions the wooden globe was acquired from the royal court in Prague.) The collection consisted of 16 books on astronomy, a wooden celestial globe, a copper celestial globe and various astronomical instruments including an astrolabe. Cardinal Nikolaus Kryffs (Krebs) 1401-1464, Bishop of Brixon, better known as Nicholas Casanus. Casanus, made his purchase in Nuremburg on the occasion of the Imperial Diet there in 1444. His astronomical instruments have been preserved (kept on display) in the Cusanusstift (the St. Nicholaus Hospital Library (Late Gothic Cloister) founded by Casanus. Cardinal Nicholas Cusanus owned both of the oldest surviving European celestial globes. It is generally thought that both may have been fabricated in Germany. One was made of wood and painted and is dated from the 14th-century. The other was made of metal (copper) and engraved with constellation figures and is dated from the mid 15th-century. It appears the metal (copper) globe was modelled on Arabic globes. The provenience of the wooden globe is unknown (but Prague or Germany are speculated). There is a lack of Arabic influence in the iconography of the wooden globe. Alena Hadravová and Petr Hadrava state: "We assume that the globe is probably connected with the Sicilian court and cultural centre of Friedrich II of Hohenstaufen, known by the direct continuation of the ancient Greek tradition." According to Alena Hadravová and Petr Hadrava: "The Premyslid globe was constructed as the universal precession globe which is described in the Ptolemy's Almagest, i.e., in ecliptical coordinates. According the results of our measurements, the positions of most of stars correspond with those given in Almagest with root-mean-square error of a few tenths of degree, i.e., within about one millimetre. It reveals that the globe was not a mere decoration but remarkably precise instrument." (See the Abstracts for "Ancient Astronomy

and its Later Reception," The 5th International Conference of the European Society of History of Science, November 2012.) Unfortunately the exterior of the Premyslid celestial globe is fading with time.
Extracts from, Hadravova, Alena. and Hadrava, Petr. (2014). "Reflection of Ancient Greek Tradition in the 13th c. Premyslid Celestial Globe Saved in Bernkastel-Kues." In: Katsiampoura, Gianna. (Editor). Scientific Cosmopolitanism and Local Cultures: Religions, Ideologies, Societies. (Pages 45-50): "In the course of our project, when the translations were basically finished, the globe was borrowed from Cusanusstift in Bernkastel-Kues to an exhibition in Prague, where we had a possibility to investigate it in more details. It appeared immediately, that the drawings of constellations on the globe and their mutual relations are practically the best available illustrations to the ancient textual tradition on this subject. Moreover, the unique construction of the globe as the universal precession globe described in Ptolemy's Almagest (which we shall deal with in our subsequent contribution), together with a lack of Arabic influence in the iconography revealed that the globe represents a valuable remnant of the tradition of ancient Greek mathematical astronomy persisting in Europe till the Middle Ages. The celestial globe of 27 cm in diameter is made of birch wood, covered by fine canvas and plaster into which positions of stars, drawings of constellations and some coordinate circles are engraved. The stars are marked with small holes in the upper layer of the globe. The holes were coloured in red, and the figures in dark brown, which was softened with the white in some places. However, this fact is known to us from the literature only, because nowadays only some traces of the red colour are discernible. ... The fact, that the construction of the Premyslid globe as well as its iconography reveals strong ancient Greek influences, which were not mediated by Arabian environment, leads us to a hypothesis, that the globe was made in connection and tradition of the Hohenstaufen Sicilian court at Palermo. The Premyslid globe features all forty-eight Ptolemaic constellations (northern, ecliptic, and southern ones). The constellation of Scorpius is depicted on the ecliptic in its older variety, i.e. the claws of the Scorpius overlap the space of the previous zodiacal sign, which was later filled by the zodiac constellation of Libra. All the constellations on the globe are drawn by a very nice, elegant black line following the direction of the view from above the sphere of sky. Apart from all the Ptolemaic constellations, the basically complete list of stars from Ptolemy's Star Catalogue is depicted on the globe. The layout and mutual positions of constellations and stars agree with the tradition documented in texts, such as Aratos, known in the Middle Ages thanks to the Cicero's and Germanicus's translations from Greek to Latin, (Pseudo)-Eratosthenes, and Hyginus. When comparing the positions of constellations on the globe to the description in these sources, the astonishing precision of correlations emerges. It is only important to be aware of the side orientation of the constellations in the texts and on the globe. Similarities also prevail when comparing the stars depicted on the globe to their counterparts in Ptolemy’s Catalogue."
Note: In 1963, Alois Krchňák claimed that ms. Kues, Hospitalbibliothek 207 showed similarities to the wooden celestial globe also in Kues.

Appendix 1: Berlin Celestial Globe fragment SK 1050 A
A 30 centimetre fragment of a dark marble celestial globe (Inventory number Sk 1050 A) is displayed in the Neue (Neues/Neuen) Museum in Berlin (on Berlin's Museum Island). The Museum currently dates Sk 1050 A to the Roman imperial period, 1st-century CE. Dr. Ulrich Kühne, in his recently (2011) published analysis of the fragment, concludes that the fragment dates to the Hellenistic period, 3rd-century BCE.
The Berlin Celestial Globe fragment was purchased in 1889 by the Antikensammlung Berlin (Berlin antiquities collection) from unknown provenance and given the inventory number SK1050A. It was briefly discussed by George Thiele in his book Antike Himmelsbilder (1898). Georg Thiele’s lengthy paragraph about the fragment, a combination of facts and interpretation, has only recently been disputed. The celestial globe of which it was a part formed part of a water-clock. The fragment is discussed in the journal Der Globusfreund, Issues 45-46, 1998. The fragment is described in Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen, 50. Band, 2008, termed Himmelglobus Sk 1050 A. It has been recently (2011) analysed and discussed by Dr. Ulrich Kühne ("Evidence for a new interpretation of the Berlin Celestial Globe fragment SK1050A" (preprint http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/8814/)), who disputes Thiele's conclusions. Thiele (1898) thought the fragment Sk 1050 A was part of an ancient vessel arbitrarily decorated with astronomical ornaments. Ulrich Kühne believes the evidence shows the fragment was actually part of a sophisticated astronomical instrument.
According to Kühne the following constellations are indicated on the fragment: Milky Way, Hercules, Lyra, Cygnus, and Cepheus (instead of Cassiopeia, the standard interpretation).

According to Kühne (based on the Abstract for his paper): Since Thiele (1898) the fragment SK1050A in the Neue Museum in Berlin has been interpreted as being part of an ancient vessel garnished with arbitrary astronomical ornaments. The evidence indicates: (1) Structures of the fragment indicate that the Berlin Celestial Globe was fitted with a water-clock similar to the design by Ctesibius (flourished 285–222 BCE, a Greek engineer, inventor, and mathematician in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt) and that this water-clock propelled an astronomical model of the universe. (2) Iconographic parallels between Sk 1050 A and the Atlas Farnese suggest that the latter was intended to be a replica of the Berlin Celestial Globe (but the maker of the Atlas Farnese had only the fragment Sk 1050 A to work with). (3) The arrangement of the 16 'star-markings' on Sk 1050 A might be explained as geometrical constructions to establish spherical coordinate transformations. Accordingly, Sk 1050 A appears to be a sophisticated astronomical instrument designed by an ancient astronomer.
Kühne also believes some evidence indicates the fragment may be from the celestial globe of Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE). (A mechanized celestial globe was attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse.)

The Grand fragment (drawn as darker section, illustration from Hoffman sale catalogue of 1886).
Fragments of zodiacal disks dating from the 1st- to the 3rd-century CE (probably 1st or 2nd centuries CE) have been found at Salzburg (Austria) and Grand (France). The fragment from Salzburg, housed in the Museum Caralino Augustum, Salzburg, is made of bronze. The Salzburg fragment (dated to 2nd-century CE) originally formed part of an anaphoric clock (or parts of anaphoric clocks); a very sophisticated kind of water clock imitating the "risings" of the constellations. Analysis of both the fragments confirms that the zodiacal circles were positioned by means of stereographic projection; which dates at least to Ptolemy and may date back to Hipparchus. Stereographic projection is also the basic principle of the astrolabe. The fragment at Salzburg formed part of a Medieval clock (orrery). The fragment found in Grand (near Neufchâteau, in the Vosges) in northeastern France also formed part of an anaphoric clock. The 2 fragments of both later Roman period anaphoric clocks were found in the 19th-century. Because they were found in relatively remote parts of the (late) Roman empire it is likely the anaphoric clock was widely diffused in the ancient world. They comprise strong evidence that a number of Roman municipalities had these facilities. The Salzburg fragment was originally about 120-170 cm (estimates vary) in diameter. The fragment from Grand is only 35 cm across and much more crudely made.

The earliest manuscript map of the sky is the so-called Planisphere of Geruvigus dating to the 2nd-century CE. It was included in a Roman manuscript version of Aratus' Phainomena. The manuscript has a copy of a famous illustrated poem, the 'Aratea,' on the constellations and planets. It included a representation of all the constellations in the form of a planisphere, so that their relative positions could be examined; names of the constellations were supplied by the monk/scribe Geruvigus, who is otherwise unknown (fol. 21v; see Fig. It shows only the constellation figures and these are depicted as seen from the inside of the celestial sphere. It is the oldest surviving exemplar of Cicero's Latin translation of Aratus' (circa 315-240 BCE) Phaenomena. It was made in France, probably in Rheims, about 820-840 CE. (Geruvigus was the first Christian monk possessor of the MS.) The manuscript is known to have been at St Augustine's monastery (a Benedictine abbey), in Canterbury (England), by the end of the 10th-century CE. The last page of the manuscript shows a copy of the 'planisphere' of Geruvigus, showing the positions of the constellations in the band of the zodiac

Appendix 5: Roman Planetariums
An early precedent for the modern domed planetarium was apparently the Roman Emperor Nero's 'planetarium'/rotating dining room. However, whether it was a reality or a myth still seems undecided. A report on a 2016 Nero exhibition in Germany made the claim that the octogonal dining room (having 8 sides and 8 angles) - coenatio principalis - of his palace Domus Aurea (Latin for Golden House) in Rome had either one rotating dome or several nested ones in order to display celestial motions. Or - since there is no archaeological evidence for such mechanisms - that there was a fixed dome with moving lanterns instead. (The Domus Aurea was a 3-floor villa complex built in the few years between the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE and Nero's suicide in 68 CE. It was rediscovered early in the 20th-century.) According to Christopher Dewdney (2004), inside the the dome ceiling of the coenatis, the Roman radical/audacious architects Severus (Lucius Septimius Severus, architect/designer) and Celer (Petronius Celer, machinator or engineer) built a series of nested semispherical rotating domes (the mechanism being cranked by slaves) that simulated the movement of the planets across the night sky. Also, according to the Roman historian Suetonius (Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (70 CE - 130 CE)): "The main chamber was round and revolved continually day and night, as does the world." Engineers also incorporated a network of metal tubing into the mobile domes so that the effect of rain could be reproduced from the artificial sky. In 2009, archaeologists thought they could show the floor would have been able to rotate, if not the domes, ceilings or lanterns mentioned. If the dome or ceiling was fixed, but the floor rotated, the end result would have been somewhat similar. The only contemporary source seems to be one line in a text by Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus. Scholars have long debated whether this planetarium-like aspect of the room was a marvel of Roman engineering or simply a figment of Suetonius' often whimsical imagination. Because nothing in the room indicates the former presence of rotating apparatus - at least until very recently - some have suggested that there was a lantern with constellations illustrated on the underside, and that this lantern rotated on wheels or rollers. Nero's Rotating Dining Room (https://news.cnrs.fr/videos/neros-rotating-dining-room; 08.19.2016) ""The main dining table, which was round, rotated night and day, imitating the motions of the globe." The surprising construction mentioned by Suetonius in his biography of Nero [Nero 31.2] has been found. On Palatine Hill (Rome), a Franco-Italian team of archaeologists discovered remains of a mechanism that could have allowed the rotation of the floor of the main dining room [banqueting room] of the Domus Aurea - Nero's vast imperial palace." An even better 'planetarium' is believed to have existed in Domitian's private palace, Domus Augustana, built in 80 CE high on the Palatine hill. It comprised a huge hall (measuring 87 feet high (26.5 metres) by 99 feet wide (30.2 metres)), called the Coenatio Jovis (Dining Hall of Jupiter) had glowing

stars inserted into the overhead rotating domes. The simulated sky was described by the poet Publius Papinius Statius (circa 45 – circa 96 CE) - who had visited the dining hall - in his Silvae (a collection of Latin poetry). See the discussion on planetariums in: Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours by Christopher Dewdney (2004).

17: Mithraic uranography
Mithras bull slaying scene from Mithraic Temple at Heddernheim, Germany. Since January 1826, there have been 4 Mithraea found at Nida-Heddernheim which is located in a section of the city of Frankfurt am Main. In the central tauroctony usually found in a Mithraeum, Mithras is pinning the bull to the ground, one hand firmly clutching its nostrils, the other plunging a blade into its flesh. Mithras and slaughtered bovine are usually accompanied by an assortment of other creatures, typically a dog, scorpion, snake, and raven, as well stars and other figures from the zodiac. Sol (god of the Sun) and Luna (goddess of the Moon) are frequently present as well. The Mithras cult was tolerant of other gods/goddesses. Whilst Mithraists left behind no

written archival evidence there is an abundance of iconographic finds. The only characteristic common to all Mithraic temples were the fundamental architecture of their design, and the cult image of Mithras slaying a bull. It is not known how these 2 features were exactly transmitted through the Roman empire. Mithraism was a non-centralized, non-hierarchical religious movement. Whilst Mithraists left behind no written archival evidence there is an abundance of iconographic finds.

It is not known how these 2 features were exactly transmitted through the Roman empire. Mithraism was a non-centralized, non-hierarchical religious movement. The Mithraists identified Sol Invictus with their god. The assumption that the main aim of Mithraism was the salvation of the soul in the afterlife is based on 1 inscription from Santa Prisca , which says: "and you saved us," and the idea that Mithraism was similar to Christianity.
A Mithraic tauroctony 'bull slaying' scene (Museo Nationale Roma). (The representation of Mithras slaying a bull is known as a tauroctony.) The central image in all Mithraea (an underground chamber where the cult was practiced) is the tauroctony. The tauroctony takes a very similar form in all surviving examples. Astronomical interpretations of Mithraism have been around at least since the 19th-century. However, they are not all the same, especially the astronomical interpretation of the tauroctony. Interestingly, a Mithraic type of depiction appears on a Seleucid (Persian) period astronomical tablet from Uruk. It depicts a bearded humanoid, with a weapon in hand, slaying an animal. The humanoid is enclosed within a circle with the Moon and Pleiades on the left side and the constellation Taurus is depicted on the right side. Most scholars agree that understanding the code of the iconic tauroctony would likely reveal the core of the cult's theology. Exactly what the tauroctony means/represents is still a conundrum. The zodiac symbols imply the cult is connected with the celestial world.
Note: Mithraism as the name of the cult is simply modern popular usage, a neologism (recent term). The Mithraic scholar Richard Gordon states (2007): "In my view it is best, where possible, to avoid the term 'Mithraism,' since it falsely suggests that the cult was somehow a separate religion. This is one aspect of the older view of the 'oriental religions' that supposedly exposed the failure of the traditional civic cult ... At least in later antiquity the cult was known as the mysteries of Mithras [the mysteries of Mithras]."
Mithraism originated in Persia and developed in the Roman Empire as a mystery cult. Contemporaries described Mithraism as a Persian cult. The exact origin and nature of Roman Mithraism has been largely a mystery to classical scholars. It was one of the most successful mystery cults pervading the Roman Empire. (Mithraism/the mysteries of Mithra never flourished in Greece or in heavily Hellenized lands. There is no evidence of the cult of Mithras in the Greek-speaking world. The British archaeologist Martin Henig, an expert in Roman Art and Religion, proposed there is archaeological evidence indicating some sort of symbiosis between Mithraism and Bacchic cults. The ritual/cultic meal was one link.) The name of Mithra/Mithras is the Latinized equivalent of Mitra, an important deity in Persian Zoroastrianism. The exact origins of the cult devoted to the Persian deity Mithras, which came to be known in the Roman world as the Mithraic mysteries or Mithraism, are unknown. The god Mithra/Mithras was worshipped in remote antiquity by the ancestors of the Persians and Indians alike. The mystery cult was a distinctively Mediterranean form of religious worship in which esoteric beliefs withheld from the general population were taught and secret rites performed. Unlike the public rituals and processions dedicated to Cybele and Isis in Imperial Rome, the worship of Mithras was secret and mysterious.

There were 3 "Mithrases" in antiquity. (1) Indo-Aryan circa 2000 BCE. There was a god Mitra in the Hindu pantheon. In the Vedic Hymns of ancient India, he is known as Mitra, 'the friend.' (2) Zoroastrian in the 6thcentury BCE. There was a god Mithra in the Zoroastrian Yashts (hymns to Ahura Mazda) forming part of the Avesta collection of the sacred texts of the Zoroastrian religion. To the Persians, Mithra was the god of oaths and covenants. (3) Imported into Rome (from Asia Minor) or created in Rome circa 60 BCE. In the Roman cult Mithra was transformed into a god of mysteries.
The earliest known occurrence of the name Mitra is in a peace treaty inscription, dating circa 1400 BCE, between the Hittites and the Hurrian-speaking kingdom of the Mitanni (Upper Mesopotamia). A number of Indo-Aryan gods (i.e., Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nāsatya) are mentioned in Mitanni texts. Their belief systems contained many Indo-European elements. (It is also known that Mitra and other gods were written before the cultural/geographic separation of Indo-Aryan/Indo-European peoples i.e., Indian and Iranian people.)
The Roman mystery cult of Mithras emerged in the 1st-century CE, attained its peak in the 3rd-century CE, and disappeared by the end of the 4th-century CE (wiped out by Christianity). Mithraism, like other nonChristian Roman religions, only came to an end as the result of political policy i.e., with the endorsement of Christianity by the Roman state during the 4th-century. We know very little for certain about the Roman cult of Mithras. There is almost a complete lack of written evidence to tell us what the archaeological finds mean. No clear account has come down to us describing what Mithraism is about. The more frequent Christian sources are simply biased and distorted (derogatory). It is worth noting that Manfred Clauss (2000, Page 17) proposed that Mithraism is "an example of the primacy of images in the ancient world." In the absence of Mithraic literature, evidence of the cult, its rituals, and customs is limited to archaeological finds and depictions of the god.
In the syncretised religious period of the Commagne/Commagene kingdom (a short-lived Hellenised Armenian kingdom in Eastern Anatolia) during the 1st-century BCE the god Mithras had multiple identifications.
The foundation of modern Mithraic studies was established by Franz Cumont in his magisterial 2-volume work Texte monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mithra (1896-1899). In it he extensively analysed monuments, inscriptions, and testimonia. Included was an essay on the history, doctrines, and rituals of the cult. It was the first truly historical account of Mithraism.
Roman Mithraism was a mystery-religion that had a unique development that was quite separate from its earlier history in Iran, India, and Upper Mesopotamia. (The founder or the founding group might have come from Anatolia/Armenia. The forms of old Iranian religion that passed in to Roman mysteries of Mithra, through Anatolia, were transformed/modified from their original Iranian form. Apart from some Persianisms the Roman cult of Mithras is indicated as being totally Roman. Both philosophy and astronmomy contributed to the origin of Roman Mithraism.) It gained a widespread following in the Roman Empire during the first four centuries of the present era, especially in the Roman army. In addition to military devotees, wealthy merchants and educated laymen were also Mithraists. On the social profile of Mithraists in the Roman Empire, Roger Beck wrote (Encyclopædia Iranica): "...social profile. They were the most conformist of men - and men indeed they were in the limited gender sense of the word, a factor which itself would add to their respectability or at least not detract from it (compare the charge against Christianity that it subverted the family by proselytizing the womenfolk). Mithraism drew its initiates disproportionately from the military, from the Empire's petty bureaucracy, and from moderately successful freedmen (i.e., ex-slaves), in fact from the retainer classes, the very people who had a stake in the current sociopolitical dispensation."
At the end of the 1st-century CE the god Mithras began to appear in Italy, becoming especially popular with Roman legionaries, imperial slaves, and ex-slaves. His popularity was not limited to the class of soldiers, however, Mithraists could also be found in the circles of the imperial households. It is generally thought the Roman cult of Mithras appears to have begun in the Roman military, eventually becoming a cult not only of Roman legionaries, but of merchants and government officials as well. Because of a lack of literary evidence all theories of the origin of Mithraism remain uncertain. Mithraic temples have been discovered in sites as wide spread as England (Hadrian's Wall), North Africa, Germany, and Syria (at the ancient town of Dura Europus on the Euphrates River).

The Cilician theory of the origin of Mithraism in the Roman Empire is controversial. In summary outline: Circa 75 BCE in Cilicia (a region along the coast of southwestern Asia Minor) the Cilician pirates surrendered to the Roman general Pompey (later styled Pompeius Magnus). His successful lightning-swift campaign against the Cilician pirates, and unconditional clemency for all pirates who surrendered to him in person, meant the Cilicians were admitted to the Roman Empire. They were resettled in various parts of the Roman dominion, bringing their families and possessions with them. According to Plutarch of Chaeronea (46-circa122 CE), influential Greek philosopher and author (who became a Roman citizen), the Cilicians also brought with them a peculiar system of religious beliefs and practices. This is believed by some scholars to be Mithraism.
Both Roger Beck and Reinhold Merkelbach (both Mithraic scholars) believe the Mithraic cult was created in Rome by a person or persons who had knowledge of both Greek and Oriental religion (i.e., who knew the Iranian myths in detail). Beck specifically identifies them as belonging to the Dynasty of Commangene. The Kingdom of Commangene was part of Roman Asia.
The aristocracy of the Persian military worshipped Mithras as the guardian of their military arms. This concept endured in the Latin military world with Mithras as the patron-in-chief of Roman soldiers and armies.
Mithraic monuments in Europe have been excavated and described since the Renaissance. The archaeological record shows that Mithraism was becoming widespread in the Roman Empire by the end of the 1st-century CE. The earliest Mithraic temples, or Mithraea, of which we have knowledge date from roughly 90 CE to 110 CE, in the German provinces. The mysteries of Mithras would have been wellestablished by that time in the Roman heartland, the Italian peninsula. By the middle of the 2nd-century CE the cult had spread throughout Roman territory, from the Middle East to the British Isles. It was exclusively a male cult and highly popular amongst legionaries.
Mithraism apparently enjoyed a measure of tolerance from the Roman government from its inception. (The Mithras cult was never supported by the Roman state.) From the time of the administration of the emperor Commodus (who reigned from 180 CE to 190 CE) onward it appears that nearly every Roman emperor was associated with the cult of Mithras in some way. The demise of Mithraism, like its origins, is also shrouded in obscurity. After the death of Julian the Apostate (absolute ruler of the Roman Empire) in 363 CE, during his unsuccessful campaign in Persia, the mysteries of Mithras were swiftly suppressed.
In the Roman empire Mithraism was a secret religious society to which only men were apparently admitted. The gender of Mithraic worshippers is thought to be exclusively male. Most scholars believe the Mysteries were an all-male secret society. However, others, including the ancient Roman philosopher Porphyry, have proposed there may have been a few female initiates as well. The religion was popular among Roman soldiers, which could potentially explain why it became so widespread. It would also lend credence to the theory it was some sort of secret men's 'club.' In addition to soldiers, merchants and bureaucrats and slaves all found sanctuary in the temples, brought together by a shared theology and structured social hierarchy. The Roman cult of Mithras was the most widely-dispersed and densely-distributed cult throughout the expanse of the Roman Empire from the end of the first until the fourth century CE, rivaling the early growth and development of Christianity during the same period. As its membership was largely drawn from the ranks of the military, its spread (but not its popularity) is attributable largely to military deployments and redeployments.
The abundant (and uniform set) of archaeological remains and inscriptions of Mithraism exhibit a great deal of star lore.
Despite the abundant archaeological evidence we know very little about the beliefs and rituals of Mithraism, Mithraism has left us no substantial religious texts. We know from the Contra Celsum (6:22) of the early Christian scholar Origen, whose interests included astral religion and Hellenistic astronomy, that the Mithraic mysteries relate to fixed stars and the visible planets (including Sun and Moon). According to the later voluminous Christian writer St. Jerome (4th-century CE), there were 7 initiatory grades in Mithraism, beginning with Corax (raven). The others, from lowest to highest, were Nymphus (bridegroom), Miles (soldier), Leo (lion), Perses (Persian), Heliodromus (sun-runner), and Pater (father). Of these the first two

appear to have been preparatory levels, and induction into the rank of Miles was the real starting point for progression within the Mithraic hierarchy.
During the last several hundred years scholars have proposed a number of interesting but also contradictory explanations regarding the reconstruction of the astral imagery in Mithraism.
Astronomical-astrological interpretations of Mithraic motifs have been especially popular since circa 1975. The main proponents of different models of astronomical-astrological interpretations have been: Roger Beck, Richard Gordon, David Ulansey, and Michael Speidel.
Mithraism appears to have been heavily engaged with cosmological imagery. Preserved Mithraic sites are extremely rich sources of astronomical iconography (artwork). However because of the secrecy requirements of members the cosmically inspired artwork is especially difficult to decipher. The abundance of astronomyinspired statuary, the Dioscuri, Aion, Phanes, and the unnamed lion-headed god with the signs of the zodiac on its body have been frequently excavated in preserved Mithraic temples. However, the most dominant artwork is an enigmatic cult image called the Tauroctony. It is present, with only slight variations, in every Mithraic temple and apparently was an essential part of Mithraic religious activities. The abundance of excavated artifacts displaying cosmological images indicates that the Mithraic cult had an astronomicalastrological focus.
Mithraism, like much else in late antiquity, was permeated by the imagery of Hellenistic astrology. Mithraism had a belief system (whether cultic or religious is not known) - described by modern historians as characterized by vivid myths and maddeningly obscure symbolism.
The mithraea likely modeled the contemporary knowledge of the cosmos conceptualised by Hellenistic astronomers. A number of Mithraic scholars have argued that the cult's principal icon - a very complicated and detailed scene showing the god Mithras sacrificing a bull - served, among other things, as a map of the constellations that were known to the Greeks. The link with astronomy in the form of the zodiac is unambiguous.
The Mithraic cult was practiced in Mithraea. Mithra was worshipped in small underground spaces (many connected with households) by small congregations (comprising up to 12 persons). There were no public rituals. A typical Mithraeum, an underground house of worship used by devotees of Mithras, was constructed to resemble a world-cavern, a metaphor of the cosmos favored in the ancient Middle East. The Mithraeum was a complex symbol of the cosmos. An underground vaulted grotto with complex astronomical and planetary symbolism. Roger Beck has pointed out the similarities among all Mithraeums has to come from the pivotal fact that the worship of Mithras could only take place in cavernous temples. The design of each Mithraeum had to be exactly the same, so that each temple resembled the cosmos in as much detail as possible. Without this form, worship could not have taken place. The ceilings of the caves or subterranean temples were designed to simulate the night sky. The majority of Mithraic temples are designed on an eastwest axis with a single entrance from the west leading the participants to the focal point of the room - a carved or painted relief of Mithras slaying the bull. The cult icon consists of an image of Mithras astride a massive Bull. Depicted with the god Mithras are a snake, a dog, a raven, a cup, a scorpion, and occasionally a lion. The dog and snake are pictured striving for the sacred blood flowing from the knife wound on the sacrificed bull, the scorpion appears near the bulls genitals, and signs of the zodiac usually surround the whole scene. The central figure, Mithras, is always clad in Eastern garb, his wind-blown cape decorated with stars, and his exotic costume topped off with a Phrygian cap.
Members of the cult met in a mithraeum. The small space of the cavern, the cult practices, and the ritual meal were modeled on the original space and deeds of Mithras - the sacrifice of a bull and the eating of its flesh. The dominant feature of every mithraeum was a depiction, usually carved in stone, of the central myth of Mithras: the Tauroctony or slaying of the bull of heaven. The zodiac almost always accompanies carved Tauroctony scenes. Mithras is depicted as a youthful hero wearing a characteristic Phrygian cap, killing the bull with a dagger. Surrounding and harassing the hapless bull are a dog, scorpion, raven, and snake, while flanking the scene stand two other youths holding torches (dadophori), Cautes and Cautopates, of whom the latter holds his torch with the tip pointed earthward. Several surviving tauroctonies also include a circle (or sometimes a different shape) with the signs of the zodiac. A tauroctony from Rome also includes 7 stars and 7 altars (representing the 7 planets).

The bull slaying scene was the fundamental iconography of Western Mithraism. Within the Roman cult of Mithras this depiction held the place of honour in every mithraeum (temple). In its various depictions throughout the Roman Empire it retained a striking sameness. Only minor variations are evident in over 500 representations of the bull slaying scene that have been found. The Roman Mithraic mysteries are likely the product of the syncretistic tendency of late antiquity. The meaning of the Mithraic tauroctonies (and frescoes) has continued to remain a puzzle to scholars.
The dominant art work of Mithraism is the enigmatic cult image called the Tauroctony. It was apparently an essential part of their devotional activities and was present with slight variation in every Mithraic temple.
There is no clear or agreed understanding amongst scholars of the meaning of the Mithraic tauroctony (or other Mithraic iconography). Interpretations remain speculative. This is because there is no extant literary source that can provide help to clarify the meaning of the complex symbolism inherent in Mithraic art. The usual interpretation of the tauroctony has been that it depicts an animal sacrifice scene. Inscriptions identify Mithras with the Invincible Sun (Sol Invictus). Mithras is also frequently depicted wearing a star-studded cloak. Figures of Sol (Sun) and Luna (Moon) frequently appear at the two upper corners of the tauroctone scene. Also frequently depicted are the four winds, the twelve planetary gods, and/or the twelve zodiacal signs. The two torchbearers flanking the figure of Mithras to the left and right (Cautes and Cautopates) frequently correspond to the anthropomorphic figures of Sol (Sun) and Luna (Moon) at the upper left and right corners. As such one possibility is that Cautes may symbolise light and Cautopates may symbolise darkness.
The prominent zodiac of a high artistic standard in the decorated vault of the mithraeum of (the island of) Ponza, along with decorations from the Sette Sfere and the Sette Porte mithraea in the ancient Roman port of Ostia, shows a clear preference for astronomical-astrological motifs in Mithraism in central Italy.
Three of the earliest European scholars (all French) to propose an astronomical interpretation of Mithraic iconography (i.e., an identification of its depictions with constellations (signs)) were Charles Dupuis (Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle, 1795), Georg Zoega (Abhandlungen (edited by F. Welcker), 1817), and Félix Lajard (Recherches sur le Culte Public et les Mystères de Mithra, 1867). Lajard, and later Cumont, both maintained that stellar ideas in Mithraism were of secondary importance. Regarding the Mithraic tauroctony: Dupuis held that the depictions of a dog, a serpent, a scorpion, and a raven represented zodiacal signs and constellations. Zoega held that the snake is the constellation Draco, the dog is the star Sirius, the scorpion is the constellation (sign) Scorpius, and the bull represents the earth or moon. Lajard held that the tauroctony is a representation of the sky when the vernal equinox fell in the constellation (sign) Aries.
Hugh Bowden (Mystery Cults in the Ancient World (2010, Page 187)) writes: "... Mithras himself is not a mere constellation but the sun itself: the god's title is Deus Sol Invictus Mithras, 'The Unconquered Sun God Mithras". And because the constellation at the centre of this section of the ecliptic is Leo, and Mithras is at the centre of the tauroctony, it follows that the tauroctony shows events when the sun is in the constellation Leo, that is, from late July to late August. In other words, the heavens in daytime in the hottest time of the year show Mithras killing the bull: when the sun is at its height, the constellation Taurus is sinking below the western horizon. All this would be invisible to ordinary mortals, since the brightness of the daytime sun makes the stars invisible, but the initiate of Mithras, looking at the tauroctony in his Mithraic cave, can see the event made comprehensible."
However, since 1836 (Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker by Georg Creuzer (4 volumes, 3rd revised edition, 1836-1842)), a number of scholars began to propose detailed arguments that the tauroctony is actually a star map - a symbolic representation of particular equatorial constellations. Within the star map interpretation Mithras has a celestial persona and is either identified with Perseus located above Taurus the bull or Orion which is located beside Taurus the bull. (The suggestion that Mithras is the constellation Perseus dates from Charles Dupuis (1742-1809, a French savant) who proposed it in 1781 and 1795, and Joseph Lalande (1732-1807, a French astronomer) who proposed it in 1792. The other figures present on tauroctonies are also given a celestial identification. The bull is Taurus, the dog is Canis Minor (or possibly represents both Canis Major and Canis Minor), the snake is Hydra, the scorpion is Scorpio, the raven is Corvus, the ear of wheat (depicted on the bull's tail) is Spica (= Alpha Virginis, a proxy for Virgo), the twins Cautes and Cautopates are Gemini, the lion is Leo, cup is Crater (or possibly represents Aquarius, the

constellation opposite Leo), Sol is the Sun, Luna is the Moon, and the cave is the Universe. Quite often Corvus, Spica, Leo, and Crater are missing from tauroctonies. Mithras' sword is Aries. It is clear that the elements comprising the Mithraic bull-slaying scene were intentionally chosen to symbolise particular celestial phenomena in an organised manner. It is thought, however, that many of the elements in the tauroctony represented more than one thing.
Hugh Bowden (Mystery Cults in the Ancient World (2010, Page 187)) writes: "All the elements in the tauroctony correspond to constellations in a specific region of the night sky. This is a section of the zodiac running from Taurus to Scorpio (Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio), including also the constellations between that band and the horizon (Crater, Corvus, Hydra, Canis Major and Canis Minor)." According to Roger Beck, the 2 torchbearers Cautes and Cautopates represent the extreme borders of the constellations Taurus and Scorpio; the 2 constellations among which all the constellations represented in the tauroctony are located. Furthermore, according to Beck, the 2 torchbearers Cautes and Cautopates represent the 2 solstices (the summer solstice and the winter solstice.
Note: For a succinct history of astronomical interpretations of Mithraism see: Chapman-Rietschi, P.A.L. (1997). "Astronomical Concepts in Mithraic Iconography." (Journal of the Royal Society of Canada, Volume 91, June, Pages 133-134). Though I have known of the article since 2001 I only accessed it in 2016.
Appendix 1: The Lion-headed Figure
The lion-headed figure with signs of the zodiac on his body in Mithraism is generally believed by scholars to represent the god Zurvan, but some scholars identify the statue as the god Ahriman.
Appendix 2: David Ulansey on Mithraism
David Ulansey's book is exclusively concerned with an astral interpretation of Mithraism. David Ulansey's attempt (The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries (1989)) to substantiate his assumption that knowledge of precession is the central secret of the Roman Mithraic mysteries, and such is discoverable in Mithraic iconography, lacks any credible evidence or argument and is nothing more than fanciful speculation. In Ulansey's radical interpretation, the tauroctony is a star map depicting the precession of the equinoxes and the position of the constellations circa 4000 BCE.
Few Mithraists have found Ulansey's theory convincing.
David Ulansey has been criticised for ignoring relevant sources of evidence. Ulansey denies any genuine connection between Western Mithraism and Iran's Zoroastrianism. I think he remains alone in denying the cult has historical links to Persia. Ulansey essentially holds that Mithraism was a new cult that originated in Tarsus in the 1st-century BCE. According to Ulansey Mithraism originated among the 20,000 strong pirates of Cicilia (Asia Minor = Turkey), the capital city of which was Tarsus. (Important schools of Stoicism and astrology existed at Tarsus.) For Ulansey, Mithraism is the product of an intellectual exercise by a small group of Tarsian Stoics. That astronomical knowledge now known as the precession of the equinoxes, known only to a few highly sophisticated astronomers in antiquity, was readily appropriated (despite the explanation requiring the intellectual demands of mathematical astronomy) by Stoics residing in Tarsus for incorporation into the foundation of their new religion known as Mithraism is unlikely and simply implausible.
In the summer of 88 BCE Mithridates ordered the killing of all Roman citizens living in Asia Minor. In one single night about 80,000 Romans were slaughtered. A few years later Mitraic mysteries were celebrated by the Cilician pirates, allies of Mithridates and sworn enemies of Rome and her legions. The problem is this: How then could Perseus, alias Mitras (Mitra being the namegiver of the worst enemy of Rome), become so popular and specifically so among Roman legionnaires?
The author's astronomical ideas concerning Mithraism originated during a 1977 brain-storming session, on a picture of the Mithraic myth of the bull slaying, conducted in a graduate class on the Mystery Religions by Professor John Gager. (Ulansey is an amateur astronomer.) This information by Ulansy has now been removed from the internet. This immediate conclusion of Ulansey's has been kept by him and forms the basis for his continuing rejection of the theories of recognized Mithraic scholars. For the story of the 1977 brainstorming session see also the retelling in: The Mind of Mithraists by Luther Martin (2014, Page 5).

Ulansey speculates that Mithras was derived from the constellation of Perseus (Mithras = Perseus (the Greek hero who slew the monster Medusa). According to Ulansey the Cilician pirates took the name Mithra from their ally king Mithridates VI who, on coinage, compared himself with the god/constellation Perseus. The name of Perseus was changed into Mithra in honour of king Mithradates VI Eupator Dionysius (to give him his full name), the ruler of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia. (Mithridates VI was a formidable threat to Roman superiority and led the sustained (and successful) resistance of the Hellenistic East against Roman expansion in the 1st-century BCE. He was finally defeated circa 66 BCE by the army led by the Roman general Pompeius. The Cilician pirates were allies of Mithridates VI against Rome.) However, this ignores the numerous difficulties in convincingly finding a constellation counterpart for Mithras. (For example see the discussions in: Hinnells, John. (1994). (Editor). Studies in Mithraism: Papers associated with the Mithraic Panel organized on the occasion of the XVIth Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions.)
According to David Ulansey, Mithraism originated with a group of Stoic scholars in Tarsus who made a religion out of knowledge of precession. David Ulansey holds (or rather speculates) that, in the late 2ndcentury BCE, a group of Stoics in the city of Tarsus originated Mithraism. The impetus and foundation doctrine is held by Ulansey to be the recent discovery by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus of the precession of the equinoxes. The group of Stoics are further asserted by Ulansey to have carried out the painstaking effort for the precise reconstruction of the equinoxes at past epochs and the bull-killing scene represents the end of the spring equinox falling in the "Age of Taurus" circa 4000-2000 BCE. The hypothetical group of Stoics at Tarsus appropriated the precession to the god Mithras. Mithras is the god they identified as responsible for precession through his power to shift the axis of the universe. The constellation of Perseus is identified with the god of precession (Mithras) by Ulansey. In Ulansey's speculative reconstruction the core meaning of the tauroctony is based on the assumptions: (1) Mithras is the constellation Perseus, and (2) the bull-killing encodes his cosmic victory as the power who shifts the world axis by means of precession of the equinoxes.
According to Ulansey the hero killing the bull symbolises the precessional movement of the spring equinox from the constellation of the Bull to the constellation of the Ram. There is no evidence of a concept of precessional world ages at this early period.
"Recently, another theory of the origin of Mithraism has been set forth by David Ulansey. Ulansey theorizes that Mithraism arose in the city of Tarsus in Asia Minor. He believes it was devised and propagated by a group of Stoic philosophers who thought they had discovered astronomical evidence to prove the existence of a new and powerful god. They identified this god with Perseus, one of the hero gods of Tarsus. Since the constellation of Perseus was directly above the constellation of Tarsus the bull, the philosophers believed that Perseus dominated the bull. This new religion became popular with the Cilician pirates who had close ties to the intellectual circles of Tarsus and who were interested in astral religion. They changed the name of the hero god from Perseus to Mithra in honor of Mithridates VI Eupator, the last of the dynasty of rulers of Pontus before Roman rule. It was this group of pirate sailors who gave Mithraism its form and spread the religion to the Roman world. ... All theories of the origin of Mithraism acknowledge a connection, however vague, to the Mithra/Mitra figure of ancient Aryan religion. They all point to Persian influence in Asia Minor during the Hellenistic era and to the religious ferment of that period. All see the city of Tarsus as a starting point of Roman Mithraism. Plutarch's single statement about the Cilician pirates carries enormous weight, and as a result, all theorists accept them as the missionaries who carried the new religion to Rome. The theories of the origin of Mithraism from Cumont to Ulansey remain only theories. Because of a dearth of literary evidence, we cannot be certain that Mithraism developed in a certain place or a certain time. However, the weight of scholarly opinion has clearly moved away from the long-held theory that Mithraism began in Persia and moved westward across Babylon, Syria, Asia Minor, and into Rome. ("Archaelogical Indications on the Origins of Roman Mithraism." by Lewis Hopf in: Uncovering Ancient Stones, edited by Lewis Hopfe (1994,.Pages 17-18).)"
A key incredible conjecture by Ulansey is a group of Stoics in Tarsus obtained knowledge of Hipparchus' discovery of precession and accepted it, not scientifically but mythically, and used it to create the astral myth that Mithras was the god of precession who turned the cosmic axis. There is no direct evidence at all for the group of Tarsian intellectuals proposed by Ulansey. (Also not explained by Ulansey is why this supposed group never pursued precession purely scientifically.) Not explained by Ulansey is how a little-known and little-understood astronomical discovery by Hipparchus was swiftly transmitted from the Greek island of

Rhodes to a group of Stoics (who were not astronomers) in the city of Tarsus in Asia Minor and correctly understood by them. (Tarsus was the capital of Cicilia (Asia Minor = present-day Turkey.) Very few ancient astronomers knew of the discovery and were capable of understanding Hipparchus' discovery of precession. Also, several scholars who knew of it did not believe it and rejected the notion. Ptolemy (2nd-century CE) is the first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus' work on precession. The Almagest is the principal ancient source for the discussion of precession. Ptolemy's account (Almagest 3.1, and 7. 1-3) of Hipparchus' discovery of precession describes that Hipparchus' description of what his observations showed and ideas (Hipparchus offered several explanations) were tentative and uncertain. It was Ptolemy, working some 3 centuries after Hipparchus made his discovery, who confirmed the precession involved a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes. Ptolemy defined precession as the uniform increase in the longitudes of the fixed stars. Furthermore, nowhere in the ancient world did the Stoics, whose doctrines embraced cosmology and astronomy, show any awareness of precession at all. (Stoicism was a school of Hellenistic philosophy. It was founded by Zeno of Citium (a city on the island of Cyprus) in 322 BCE, and flourished until the closing of the Athenian schools in 429 CE.) The underlying astronomy behind Ulansey's theory was at that period so obscure, known to and understood by only a few people, that the theory (encompassing doctrine and doctrine holders) is quite implausible.
It is indicated that knowledge of precession after Hipparchus' discovery was the preserve of a very small number/group of specialised scholars. The existence of a processional doctrine and a group of doctrineholders of an arcane astronomical knowledge of precession is wholly implausuble.
The history of Ulansey's method can be traced back to Charles Dupuis in his multi-volume Origine tous les cultes, ou religion universalle (1795, 6 text volumes in 3 with separate Atlas). The original conclusions made by Ulansey in his 1989 book has been kept by him and forms the basis for his continuing rejection of the theories of recognized Mithraic scholars. From Ulansey's ongoing involvement in web discussions it is clear that he does not admit any requirement to modify his original position set out in his 1989 book. To my knowledge David Ulansey has never engaged in any archaeological work regarding Mithraism.
Importantly, David Ulansey (The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries (1989)) has never provided any evidence that 'zodiacal ages/astrological ages' as developed by 19th-century theosophy and early 20th-century astrology was also a concept understood anywhere at all in the ancient Greco-Roman world. (The concept of precessional "world ages" can be traced back to Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle by Charles Dupuis (1794).)
Regarding astronomical claims for the tauroctony. With some levity Ulansey describes (Hastro-L, 12 May 2001) the "snake, goblet, and bird under the bull (Taurus) are Hydra, Crater, and Corvus." However, Hydra, Crater, and Corvus span out under Leo and Virgo. Taurus is some distance away from these 3 sub-zodiacal constellations. On page 62 of his review article Swerdlow states: "Nothing is known of the meaning of the tauroctony ...." Within Mithraic scholarship the meaning of the tauroctony remains in a dynamic state.
According to Ulansey the core of the imagery of the tauroctony is precession; specifically the "after-the-fact" - realisation of the movement of the spring equinox from Taurus to Aries. The identification by Ulansey of the torchbearers in the tauroctony with the equinoxes requires the precession to be invoked, in order to place the equinoxes in Taurus and Scorpio, as was the case case 4000-2000 BCE., and justify the identification of Mithras with the constellation Perseus, located just above Taurus in the sky. That people devising a cult circa 50 CE would decide to represent in stone the arrangement of the constellations circa 2000 BCE - not what people could actually see in the sky - lacks credibility. The fact that the precession of the equinoxes had been discovered is not relevant. I am not aware of any Mithraic scholar who support's Ulansey's idea that the key to understanding Mithraism is to believe its symbolic imagery is founded upon the precession of the equinoxes.
The tauroctony is likely to be an elaborate star-map. Various authors remain open to the star-map theory, but with different interpretations to Ulansey (due to how Ulansey argues his case). (Interestingly, the Mithraic expert Manfred Clauss does not support this idea.) The idea that the tauroctony might be a kind of star-map goes back ultimately to the late-antique scholiast Lactantius Placidus (late 4th-century commentator) in his work on Statius (Publius Papinius Statius was a Roman poet born circa 45 CE in Naples – died circa 96 CE in Naples; see Placidus' commentary on the Thebaid 1.717-1.720; which is a Latin epic in 12 books written in dactylic hexameter). However, Ulansey speculates further and claims that the tauroctony is an expression

of the celestial phenomenon of precession and signifies the lordship of the god Mithras over precession. The German scholar Karl Stark (1824-1879) in his Systematik und Geschichte der Archäologie der Kunst (published posthumously in 1880) suggested a detailed astral interpretation of the 3 fragmentary Mithraic reliefs found at Dormagen on the Rhine. Earlier, in 1869 (at an International Congress?), Karl Stark suggested that the tauroctony could be interpreted as a star map, with Mithras being identified with the constellation named after Perseus (who was commonly associated with Persia, and the bull). Stark's idea was rejected by Franz Cumont. I think it was Roger Beck (Studies in Mithraism edited by John Hinnells (1994, Pages 29-50).) who suggested that the tauroctony was a route map for the celestial journey of the soul. James North ("Astronomical Symbolism in the Mithraic Religion", Centaurus, Volume 33, Issue 2, 1991, Pages 115-148) connects the tauroctony with eastern astronomical practice. Interestingly, John Hinnells, in his book The World's Religions [?] believes the tauroctony is to be understood in astrological terms and is a star map showing the path of the soul's journey to salvation. If this is so then Mithraism is similar to emanationism.
Ulansey invokes the ideas of Willy Hartner on early constellations to buttress his arguments. However, Hartner's speculative arguments have numerous problems. Whilst his ideas on early Near Eastern constellations are still discussed by some people they have not been widely accepted.
Ulansey's widely publicised and extravagant theory, though not convincing, is certainly ingenious. It has been commented that Ulansey's interpretation of Mithraism is "well-imagined, though not true." Manfred Clauss makes the point in his book The Roman Cult of Mithras: The God and His Mysteries (2000), that attempting to decipher the celestial clues associated with Mithraism, "cannot be done without making assumptions that are themselves highly speculative." Mithraic experts who are opponents of David Ulansey's ideas on the origin of Mithraism include Roger Beck, Manfred Clauss and Helmut Waldmann. See also: Mithraic Iconography and Ideology by Leroy Campbell (1968). It has useful discussions of Mithraic iconography but is to be used with caution. The author attempts to show that basic Iranian concepts were preserved in Mithraism. The author believes that Zoroastrian theology lies behind Mithraism but does not establish an early date for such.
Appendix 3: The Mithraic Ladder a Fiction?
The Ophite sect (Gnostics) modified some Persian ideas in Mithraism in order to conceive of a ladder to reach Paradise, similar to the ladder story in Jacob's dream in the Old Testament.

Mithraism based on the belief that this mystic cult resembles Christianity. While both Christian and pagan authors testified that Mithraic elements were indeed borrowed, according to Attilio Mastrocinque this was only done by some Gnostic Christians. He counters that Roman Empire ideology and religion provide better clues on how to approach the matter, contending too that Virgil proves to be more important than the Avesta in understanding Mithraic iconography. The meaning of the central scene – the Tauroctony – thus becomes clear when the Roman triumph's central act of bull sacrifice is thought of as just that, with Mithras playing the role of victor as author of this success. The episodes depicted on many reliefs relate to a prophecy known to Firmicus Maternus and other Christian polemists, and which foretold the coming of a saviour, i.e. the first emperor, when Saturn returns and Apollo-Mithras will rule.")
According to Roger Beck, the order in which initiates ascend the Mithraic grades does not correspond to any of the planetary orders in common use in antiquity. The only evidence to the contrary is in the scenes on the Mainz ritual vessel. The pottery vessel was recovered in 1976 from a mithraeum. The scenes are molded onto the sides of the vessel.

18: The decan stars
Part of Egyptian coffin lid showing two Egyptian astronomer's assistants and hieroglyphic list of decan stars and the star's positions. (See: Ancient Astronomers by Anthony Aveni, 1993 (Page 42).) There were 2 systems of decanal stars: (1) the original system of rising decans, and (2) the later system of transit decans. Also, (3) the later Tanis system (whose application is uncertain). The decan system is uniquely Egyptian in origin. The Egyptian decans (star tables) appear to be the oldest attested astronomical writings anywhere.
(1) Introduction
Traditional Egyptian astronomy was centred on the calendar and measuring the night hours. Mathematical astronomy did not exist in ancient Egypt. The movements of the celestial bodies were only summarily described.
The earliest evidence for Egyptian “sky-watchers” dates to the early 2nd millennium BCE. Contemporary texts use the title “hour man,” a descriptive term presumably referring to a person observing the hour-stars. A

millennium later the title “hour watcher” is documented. The existence of titles such as “chief of hourwatchers” shows that the profession was organized like others. A Late Period description of astronomer’s duties included knowing the time of the rising and setting of stars, especially Sothis (Sirius), the progress of the sun towards north or south, the proper length of the hours of daytime and night, and the proper performance of rituals, as well as charms against scorpions.
Most of what is known about Egyptian astronomy is recorded in religious texts. Egyptian astronomy was mainly concerned with the measurement of time and knowing the correct dates for holding religious ceremonies.
The oldest literary evidence for Egyptian astronomical beliefs/ideas are the Pyramid Texts. These comprise a group of magical spells and ritual utterances inscribed on the walls of the burial chambers of late Fifth Dynasty onwards (circa 2400 BCE) of Egyptian kings. The constellation Orion was associated with the god Osiris as early as the Pyramid Texts. The next major astronomical development in Egypt was the so-called "star clocks" of the Old Kingdom period (circa 2200 BCE). (However, the star clocks/star tables are usually dated much earlier than the coffins they appear on.) It has been proposed by Gay Robins that the system of star clocks/star tables may have originated in the temple ritual system - connected with the waking of the god (gods/goddesses) at dawn. The depiction of information on the star clocks/star tables on coffin lids is perhaps more artistic/conceptual than accurate. They helped to delineate the lid of the coffin as the night sky. The concept being presented was universal harmony and order (ma’at).
The star clocks/star table in the Middle Kingdom period appear exclusively in coffins. In the New kingdom period they are relocated to the ceilings of tombs. Existing examples of "star clocks" on coffin lids are often corrupted.
(2) Sources
Our knowledge of early Egyptian astronomy is mostly derived from inscriptions and representations on the ceilings of tombs and on coffin lids of the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. No Egyptian record of astronomical observation has been discovered to date. The only Egyptian eclipse record known documents a solar eclipse for 601 CE.
The Egyptian system of decans are known through 4 main groups of sources: (1) the diagonal star clocks on the inside surface of wooden coffin lids from the 9th Dynasty to the 12th Dynasty, (2) the cenotaph of Seti I, the tomb of Ramses IV, and Papyrus Carlsberg I, (3) the tomb of Senmut and later similar monuments, and (4) Hellenistic-Roman monuments and astrological documents. (The latter group of sources considered the decans simply as thirds of zodiacal signs.) In both the cenotaph of Seti I and the tomb of Ramses IV the decans are represented on the body of the sky goddess Nut. Carlsberg Papyrus Number I is an extensive commentary on the inscriptions on monuments. (Additionally, there is a fragment remaining of a diagonal star clock on a ceiling in the Osireion at Abydos which dates from the XIXth dynasty.)
The majority of diagonal star tables (also termed 'diagonal star clocks' or 'diagonal star calendars' are mostly found on particular ancient Egyptian coffin lids (the underside of the innermost coffin lids) from Asyut. One has been found in Aswan and also one has been found in the Osireion. Most of the tables (hieroglyphic texts) are found on coffin lids dating to the First Intermediate Period and early Middle Kingdom (around 2150 BC). Presently (2013) 25 examples are known.
The decans travelled over the body of the sky goddess Nut. When the Demotic document known as Carlsberg Papyrus Number I was discovered it contained the picture of the sky goddess Nut with all the decans and their dates of rising and setting. However, this picture was gone when the document reached Copenhagen.
It is generally accepted that the diagonal star clock tables record the rising of stars/asterisms called decans throughout the course of the night. A list of usually 12 decans make up a column entry for one 10-day period. A complete diagonal star clock includes 36 of these columns plus a few others which list all the decans used.
(3) Dating the information

Sometimes the astronomical information carried by a temple ceiling or a tomb ceiling is earlier than the date of construction of the structure or date of placement of the information on the ceiling. As examples: (1) The decanal transit tables found on the ceiling of the Cenotaph of Seti 1 (circa 1306-1290 BCE) date from at least as early as the reign of Sesostris III in the 12th dynasty (circa 19th century BCE. (2) The earliest copies of the Ramesside Star Clock (star table system measuring meridian transits) are found in the Tomb of Ramesses VI (circa 1151-1143 BCE in the 20th dynasty), but the content implies a date that is some time between circa 1500 BCE and 1470 BCE in the 18th dynasty.
An inscription on the back pillar of the statue of the native Egyptian astronomer(/astrologer) Harkhebi (found in 1906), dated to the Ptolemaic Period, early 3rd-century BCE, is the earliest evidence for the transmission of Babylonian astrological doctrines to to Egypt. Egypt was an astronomical-astrological centre between Mesopotamia, Greece, and India.
(4) Decan system
The decans are an Egyptian system of 36 stars/star groups (asterisms). In the earliest system decans are certain selected stars/asterisms that rise at 12 intervals during the night, and at 10-day intervals through the year. A later system was based on decans transiting the meridian. (The term decan is from the Greek meaning "10 days apart.") The decans could be groups of stars or single bright (conspicuous) stars. The ancient Egyptians used special constellations (asterisms), the decans, to divide their year into 36 parts. They rose at particular hours of the night during 36 successive periods of 10 days each, constituting the year. A decan indicated the one and same hour during 10 days. (Each specific decan rose above the eastern horizon at dawn for an annual period of 10 days.) As the stars rise 4 minutes later night by night a given decan was replaced after 10 day by its predecessor to mark a given hour. Otto Neugebauer believed the 36 decans formed the old year of 360 days. The 5 additional or epagomenal days were "ignored" but undoubtedly were taken into account during the development of the decan system. (The earliest Egyptian calendars indicate that the 5 epagomenal days were not regarded as belonging to the year. The New Year festival begins on the 1st Thoth, not on the 1st of the epagomenal days.) A more recent view by Anne-Sophie von Bomhard is that the original decan system was designed for a year of 365 days. Because the original decan ("star clock") was organised for the civil year of 365 days (not the Sothic year of approximately 3651⁄4 days) they would inevitably soon lose they usefulness. The decan system would require some place shifts and the addition of new decans. The Egyptian "star clocks" (i.e., decans) are the earliest detailed astronomical texts known.
According to the accepted interpretation made by Otto Neugebauer in Egyptian Astronomical Texts (Volume 1, 1960), based the Book of Nut texts, the decan stars circled the sky in a zone approximately parallel to and slightly south of the ecliptic. The decans (a Greek term) lay within a wide equatorial belt and began with Sepedet (= Sirius). (Sepedet (= literally, "the excellent" but also "The Great Star") was sometimes called the "Mistress of the Year.") Sirius (Sepedet) is the only one of the decans able to be unambiguously identified. (Neugebauer's identification of the location of the decanal belt is disputed by Kurt Locher "New arguments for the celestial location of the decanal belt and for the origin of the s3h-hieroglyph." (Atti di sesto congresso internazionale di egittologia. (2 Volumes, 1992-1993.); Joanne Conman "It's About Time: Ancient Egyptian Cosmology." (Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur, Band 31, 2003). See also the unpublished doctoral thesis by Sarah Symons (1999) Ancient Egyptian Astronomy: Timekeeping and Cosmography in the New Kingdom.)
Some time during the 3rd-millennium BCE Egyptians star watchers divided the night into 12 hours determined by the heliacal risings of stars or small groups of stars called decans. The texts relating to the system of decan stars date from 2200 BCE to 1200 BCE. According to the Egyptologist Richard Parker we only know for certain that it was by the 24th-century BCE that the stars were first used to tell the time at night. Also, it is only by 2150 BCE that it is known for certain that the night hours totalled 12. (It is presently thought that "star clocks" are likely to be an Old Kingdom invention.) Decanal "star clocks" (also (mistakenly) termed "diagonal calendars") decorated the inside surface of Egyptian (wooden) coffin lids, in both drawings and texts, starting circa 2100 BCE (with the practice ending circa 1800 BCE). (Our principal knowledge of astronomy in the Middle Kingdom period comes from wooden coffin lids, primarily from the 9th and 10th Dynasties. The painted scenes (sometimes carved) on the inside surface of the coffin lids are actually tables of "rising stars.") They are also shown on the tomb ceilings of Seti I (1318-1304 BCE) and on some of the ceilings/walls of royal tombs of the Ramesside period (12th-century BCE). They show that there was a system of 36 named "equatorial" stars rising within 10 days of each other (and were based on the civil

calendar year). The coffin lid "star clocks" largely had a funerary purpose and therefore were largely symbolic rather than intending to be accurate. Pictures of decans comprise most of the celestial representations in Egyptian tombs.
The system of decan stars was used to indicate the hours of the night throughout the year. Lists of decans were prepared to determine the hour of the night if the calendar date was known, or to determine the decan if the hour of the night was known. The use of the decan stars for time measurement during the night likely led to the twelve-division of the period of complete darkness. Of the 18 decans marking the period from sunset to sunrise 3 were assigned to each interval of twilight. This left 12 decans to mark the hours of total darkness. However, as the length of night varied with the time of the year, these decans did not measure equal lengths of time. at the latitude of Egypt the night in midwinter is almost 50 percent longer than the night at midsummer. How much the Egyptians were aware of this difference is not known. The 12-unit division of the night therefore probably originated in the combining of the decanal stars with the civil calendar decades. The twenty-four division of day and night (i.e., 24 hour system) eventually derived from this. (The original 24 hour division was actually a system of "hours" of uneven length and uneven distribution between daylight and night. As early as circa 2100 BCE the Egyptian priests were using the system of 24 hours. According to one authority this comprised 10 daylight hours, 2 twilight hours, and 12 night hours. This system was obsolete by the time of Seti I. By the Ramesside period (circa 1300/1200 BCE) there was a simpler more even division of 24 hours into 12 hours of night and 12 hours of daylight each. It has been proposed, however, that the division of day and night into 12 hours each may have been initiated by the fact that the year was divided into 12 months.)
The "hours" successively marked by each decan star for an interval of 10 days were, however, actually only an "hour" of approximately 45 minutes duration. (Each decan would rise approximately 45 minutes later each night.) (The division of the hour into 60 minutes was the invention of the Babylonians.)
The decanal system has been traced back as far as the 3rd Dynasty (circa 2800 BCE) and may be older still. The contents of coffin lids establishes that the decanal system, of dividing the night into 12 hours according to the rising of stars or groups of stars, was in place at least by circa 2150 BCE. The contents of the Pyramid Texts show that the system of decans was established by at least the 24th century BCE.
The primary reason for the Egyptians to study the night sky seems to have been to establish the civil calendar (which was apparently initiated with the heliacal rising of Sothis (= Sirius)) on a firm basis. (The civil calendar was the official calendar. It was a simple calculating tool that could be followed automatically. The civil calendar remained unchanged in Egypt from its establishment circa early 3rd millennium BCE until near the end of the 1st millennium BCE.) The Egyptian calendar-year on which the system of decans (star clocks) was originally constructed was the civil or "wandering" year which consisted of 12 months of 3 10day weeks, divided into 3 seasons of 4 months each, followed by 5 epagomenal days (called "the days upon the year"/"those beyond the year"). The civil calendar had been long established when the decans first appeared on the inside surface of coffin lids of the Middle Kingdom period. Otto Neugebauer (The Exact Sciences in Antiquity, 1957, Page 82) wrote: "In tracing back the history of the Egyptian decans we discover the interaction of the two main components of Egyptian time reckoning: the rising of Sirius as the harbinger of the inundation, and the simple scheme of the civil year of 12 months of three decades each." To assist the establishment of a civil (year) calendar the sky was divided into a scheme of 36 decans, with each decan (characterised by a bright star or distinctive star group) marking 36 ten-day periods, to which was added 5 epagonal days.
There were two systems of decanal stars. The first (and original) system used heliacal risings. The second (and later) system used meridian or near meridian transits.
(5) Decan lists
Many Egyptian monuments incorporate lists of decans.
The decanal system involved the arrangement of 10-day intervals throughout the year. The decan lists were essentially set out in tables consisting of 36 columns with (usually) 12 rows or divisions. The columns in the tables covered the year in 10-day intervals. The rows in the tables covered the 12 decanal hours of the night. In each of the 36 columns the decans are placed in the order in which they rise above the horizon (or transit



2022. 02. 21. 20:03 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20201221170953/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-18.html 5/13
the meridian). Every 10 days the 12 hours of the night are defined/marked by a different combination of 12 successive stars. With each of the successive 36 columns the name of a specific decan is moved one line higher to its place in the preceding column (i.e., the second decan becomes the first and so on). This results in a diagonal structure (diagonal pattern) which is the reason for the early name "diagonal calendars" being given to these texts (but perhaps properly "star clocks" or "diagonal star clocks"). However, not all are arranged in a manner that would enable them to function as 'star clocks.' Regarding "diagonal calendars." A complete diagonal calendar contains 36 transverse columns.
Basically 3 lists of decans were constructed. The comparison of all the variations in the decan lists enables a grouping into 5 families. Three of rising decans, one of decans in transit, and one that cannot be assigned with certainty to either. The 5 families of decans are named from the first example of each. The 5 families are the Senmut, Seti I A, and Seti I C families of rising decans; the Seti I B family of transiting decans; and the Tanis family of uncertain application. It is suggested that it is probably 'a mixed and artificial list'. The Tanis family of decans are late in origin, their application is uncertain, they appear to be an artificial construct, and they are unusable as a true 'star clock.' Further reduction is possible to (1) the Seti I B family and (2) the Tanis family.
(6) Identification of decans
The identification of the various decans is has proven to be extremely difficult. All of the extant so-called star clocks are corrupt textually to some degree. Even when but even when there is certainty with the decanal names and their translations, their proper astronomical identity has mostly remained unknown (due to divergences between records).
(7) Rising decans
The earliest example of a list of rising decans appears on a panel in the tomb of Senmut (Senemut).
The decanal system consisted of 36 rising stars and used the heliacal risings of stars/asterisms on the eastern horizon as markers. Each period of 10 days was first marked by the heliacal rising of the next decan on the eastern horizon. They rose heliacally 10 days apart and all had the same invisible interval of 70 days prior to their heliacal rising. (At least ideally all the decans had the same duration of invisibility as their leader Sirius. All decans were invisible for 70 days between acronychal setting and heliacal rising - because of being in the light.)
By the time of the New Kingdom period (circa 1550-1100 BCE) the usefulness of the original decan system of hours had ceased. By the 10th Dynasty and 11th Dynasty the original decan system had become completely unusable and in the 12th Dynasty were subjected to a radical revision. Many old decans were dropped out and many new decans were introduced.
(8) Transit decans
By the time of the New Kingdom (circa 1530 BCE) the Egyptians changed from using 18 stars rising at night to using 13 stars crossing the meridian; with one of the 13 stars marking the beginning of the night. The new system of using the transiting of the meridian by decans. i.e., their culminations, to mark the night time hours, is identified from later texts which may be collectively called the Book of Nut or the Cosmology of Seti I and Ramesses IV. Due to observer difficulties this particular method was not associated with any astronomical accuracy - it was an approximate system.
The change from rising decans to transit decans resulted in changes in the decanal list. They differed in all but 3 of the stars/asterisms they used.
The Seti I B family of transit decans (examples: Book of Nut texts (of which we have only a few extant examples; 9 different copies of various dates - 3 of which are monumental sources); the ceiling depiction of the goddess of the sky, Nut, bending over the earth, Geb, and supported by the air god, Shu.) were undoubtedly established through observation. The modern title of the Book of Nut is, 'The Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars.'

From the Book of Nut texts we can identify the introduction of a new decanal system that can be termed transit decanal clocks. This new system, termed the Ramesside star clocks, used the transiting of the meridian by decans (their culminations) to mark the night-time hours. The new system of meridian transits of stars for time-keeping purposes used stars belonging to both constellations and asterisms. (The time of decan transits involved the time they crossed the meridian i.e., reached the highest point in the sky (culmination).) This new method of indicating the night hours arose by combining only those stars which behave like Sirius with 10-day weeks of the civil calendar. Likewise with the previous system of decans, this attempt to substitute the culmination of stars for their heliacal rising also did not last.
The Ramesside (20th Dynasty) star clocks are star tables which measure hours by means of transits, in half month intervals (i.e., 15-day cycle/"week"). (One of the most important documents relating to Egyptian astronomy is the long table of (decan) star transits (culminations) for each hour of the night on every fortnight of the year. This is given with most accuracy in the tomb of Ramses VI.) These are different star clocks to the earlier system of decans. Only a few of the stars/asterisms used in the earlier decanal star clocks are the same as, or near to, those used in the Ramesside star clocks. The evidence for these later star clocks comes exclusively from the ceilings of a number of Egyptian royal tombs of the Ramesside period (Ramses VI, Ramses VII, and Ramses IX of the 12th-century BCE). The term 'Ramesside star clocks' denotes they were painted for the benefit of the deceased Ramesside period Pharoah. Two sets of star tables appear in the tomb of Ramesses VI, one set of star tables appears in the tomb of Ramesses VII, and one set of star tables appears in the tomb of Ramesses IX. The texts consist of 24 star clock tables (panels) for the 24 half-month intervals of one year. These particular ceilings also include other astronomical information: (1) lists of decans and their divinities, (2) constellations, and (3) the days of the lunar month.
There was no provision for the 5 epagomenal days of the year.
(9) Tanis family of decans
The Tanis family of decans, is found in examples from the 26th Dynasty down to the end of the 1st century CE. The Esna ceiling has the decans of the Seti I B family in a strip next to those of the Tanis family in a strip.
(10) Time-keeping corrections
The Egyptian civil calendar was invented in the 3rd Dynasty. The original decan system was organised for the civil year. The Egyptian civil year contained 365 days whilst the system of 36 decans sufficed only for the old year of 360 days. This was taken into account by the originators of the decanal system. They added an additional set of stars/asterisms to indicate the hours of darkness for the 5 epagomenal days. The decans of the 5 additional (epagomenal) days were treated separately. They are depicted on 4 coffin lids separately and appear after the 36 decans of the 360 day year. (The last 5 (extra) days of the year were the birthday festivals of the 5 principal gods/goddesses: Osiris, Isis, Horus, Seth, and Nephthys.) However, keeping the (diagonal) star clocks adjusted was a continuous problem. The Egyptians did not bother to take into consideration the fact that the 365 days did not accurately measure the return of the sun to the same star. The calendrical system based on the decans was flawed by its failure to take into account the fact that the Egyptian civil year was always approximately 6 hours short of the solar year. (The Sothic year was 3651⁄4 days.) The lack of a leap year in the Egyptian civil calendar resulted in the risings of decans becoming out of phase with it. The result was a slow progressive change took place in the relation between the heliacal rising of a decan and its date in the civil calendar. Rearrangements of the decanal order were attempted in order to counter the resulting mismatch. Marshall Clagett (Ancient Egyptian Science II, 1995, Page 56) writes: "Evidence for a revision toward the end of the twelfth dynasty exists." However, by the time of the 12th dynasty a new system based on decans transiting the meridian was developed.
The decanal star clocks were eventually replaced by water clocks (clepsydra). Water clocks were probably used for indicating the passage of hours of the night. In use, the water clock was filled with water, which leaked out slowly from a small hole near the bottom. The time is indicated by the level of the water in the vessel, which is shaped so that it falls at a uniform rate. The oldest existing water clock was found by Georges Legrain in 1904 in a "cachette" he had discovered a year earlier in a courtyard of the Temple of Amun at Karnak. It was buried under the court of the Eighth Pylon with a large variety of sculptural pieces (approximately 20,000). All the items were buried at the same time during or immediately after the

Ptolemaic Period. The buried items variously date from the Old Kingdom through to the Ptolemaic Period. The water clock, which is made of alabaster, is inscribed with a dedication to Amenhotep III who ruled 1390/1-1352/3 BCE. This water clock is dated to circa 1417-1379 BC, during the reign of Amenhotep III where it was used in the Temple of Amun at Karnak It is apparently a later copy of an earlier water clock developed by the Egyptian court official (astronomer) Amenemhet for Amenhotep I. This earlier water clock is known from a hieroglyphic inscription only appearing on the wall of the tomb of Amenemhet. The hieroglyphs somewhat describe the water clock and dedicate it to Amenhotep I. The autobiographical tomb inscription states that Amenemhet invented the (first) water clock for Amenhotep I so he could tell the time when it was cloudy. This tomb inscription is the oldest documentation of the water clock in Egypt. The development of the water clock by Amenemhet is dated to circa 1550 BCE. Amehotep I died circa 1500 BCE. The actual water clock has not been found. The tomb of Amenemhet was discovered circa 1895 by the Italian archaeologist Ernesto Schiaparelli. (The oldest known example of an Egyptian sundial dates to circa 1500 BCE.)
The decans were selected for decades of the civil calendar, 3 for each month (of 3 x 10-day weeks), leaving over 5 epagomenal days at the end of the year. The civil year and the astronomical year were often out of phase because the civil calendar contained exactly 365 days. A calendar of 365 days does not accurately measure the return of the sun to the same star. (The fraction of the day left unrecognised was ·2422.) The civil year was shorter than the year based on the risings of stars. The total of 365 days did not vary. (The Egyptians did not take leap years into account. No intercalary day was inserted in any year. As a result the civil calendar moved further and further away from the actual seasons.) As a consequence there is a relentless slow movement in the relation between the heliacal rising of a decan and its date in the civil calendar. The civil year through the natural (astronomical/solar) year by approximately 1 day every 4 years. The beginning of the schematic civil calendar of 365 days "wandered" in the course of time through all the seasons. Every 4 years the beginning of the civil calendar year (1st of Thoth) was delayed by 1 day.
The civil year and the astronomical/solar year (seasonal year) were usually reckoned to coincide only every (approximately) 1460 years (according to the definition of "a solar year") (the so-called Sothic cycle - from the name of the star observed). Only then did the civil calendar year syncronise with the actual seasons (more or less). The "Sothic cycle" of (approximately) 1460 years was the result of connecting the agricultural year with the yearly recurring astronomical phenomenon, the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, which roughly coincided with (i.e., slightly preceded) the beginning of the inundation of the Nile River. The heliacal rising of the star Sirius only attained its importance by its closeness to the inundation of the Nile River. The Egyptian (seasonal) year was considered to begin on July 19th (Julian calendar date) - the date of the heliacal rising of Sirius.
The 3 seasons, however, corresponded to the cycle of the Nile River and agriculture. By the Middle Kingdom period (circa 2040-1640 BCE) the heliacal rising of the star Sirius was established as the event which marked the beginning of the seasonal year. (There is considerable evidence that from an early date the Egyptians regarded the heliacal rising of the star Sirius as marking the beginning of the year. The Egyptians fixed the beginning of their year, but not their civil calendar, with the heliacal rising of Sirius (our Julian calendar date of July 19th = the "coming out of Sepedet). With the civil calendar the first month of the Inundation always followed the 5th epagomenic day, irrespective of whether Sothis had risen or not. (The heliacal rising of the star Sirius fell on the 1st of Thoth once every 1460 Julian calendar years.) The Sothic year was the lapse of time which passed between 2 heliacal risings of the star Sirius, at the same latitude of reference. (Also, the length of a Sirius cycle is somewhat variable.) The solar year was in official use as early as the 12th Dynasty (circa 1938-1756 BCE) period and was defined as beginning at the heliacal rising of Sirius. New year's day (our Julian calendar date of 19th July) marked the beginning of the first season (i.e., the flooding of the Nile). The New Year day was not determined on astronomical grounds (by a celestial event) but was determined by a calendar of 3651⁄4 days and the method of counting 3651⁄4 days from the previous new year's date.
(11) Hellenised decans
The use of the decans did not survive into Ptolemaic times. The Egyptian decans eventually became incorporated with the Graeco-Babylonian zodiac, 3 decans to a sign, each decan covering10 degrees of the full circuit of the sky. The decans became an important component of Hellenistic-Roman astrology. The use of the decans in connection with the zodiac may have influenced some of the Gnostic speculations.

After the 12th Dynasty there is no contemporary evidence for use of any decanal 'star clocks.' The single example from the time of Pharaoh Merneptah (reigned 1223 – 1211 BCE) whilst late (the latest we have), has only a funerary purpose (and also could suit only a time some 6 centuries earlier). There are numerous lists of decans from later monuments, extending well into the Roman period, but these are never in the form of a 'star clock.'
However long the practice of time-keeping by the observation of decans lasted, the title or "hour-watcher" (imy wnwt or wnwty) persisted until the Ptolemaic period. However, perhaps by this period with the general meaning of astronomer once water clocks, shadow clocks, and sundials came into common use. (Water clocks were used almost exclusively for telling the telling time at night.)
The identification of the decans with the ecliptic is a late development. After the transmission of the Greek zodiac to Egypt in the Ptolemaic period, the system of Egyptian decans was adjusted to the new system.
The Egyptian system of 36 decan-stars was based on an equatorial system of measurement. The Greeks, however, always measured their stellar coordinated relative to the ecliptic. This had consequences when the Greeks adopted and adapted the Egyptian system of decans to their own ecliptical system. In Hellenistic times the Egyptian system of decans was brought into a fixed relation to the Babylonian-Greek zodiac. Simply, the astronomical and time-keeping significance of the 36 decan-stars became redundant. The later division of the ecliptic into 10 degree sections called decans by the Greeks derives from the Egyptian system of decan-stars.
In Hellenistic times, after the death of Alexander the Great, the 36 decans eventually were defined as thirds of zodiacal signs, each decan representing segments of the ecliptic of exactly 10 degrees length.
In the Hellenistic period the decans for the most part seemed to be associated with or represented divisions of the areas assigned to the zodiacal figures, each sign being divided into 3 decans (except in a few cases of 4 decans), which, when absorbed by Greek and Roman zodiacs, were merely the names of the 3 10-degree divisions of each of the zodiacal signs. The decans came to represent one-third of a zodiacal sign. Usually these segments were not given special names but were simply counted as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd decan of the zodiacal sign in question. This system of the use of decans continued through into medieval astrology. The decans eventually became an important component of astrology in India, the Islamic world, in medieval astrology, and finally in the European Renaissance (in the non-Egyptian zodiac).
What remained - but only for a short period - were the myths/lore the Egyptian had associated with each decan. The 36 decans, and their particular divinities, became an important part both of Late Egyptian religion and also of the theoretical apparatus of astrology. The Greeks very quickly replaced all the native Egyptian myths/lore with their own astronomical myths. Hence, in this new form the decans continued to play a part in the later astrology of Greece, Rome. India, Islam, and medieval and Renaissance Europe.
The use in Greek astronomy of Egyptian decan names had little conformity with the stars/asterisms used by the ancient Egyptians for time-keeping during the night. (Later Greek use of the Egyptian decans amalgamated/combined 2 different series of decans - Seti I B and Tanis.) By the time of their use by the Greeks the Egyptian decans were simply used to mark the 10-degree divisions of the zodiacal signs. There is no reason to believe their Greek use remain tied to the old Egyptian decan names and old Egyptian decan stars/asterisms.
Appendix 1: The Nature of the Decans: Star Clocks, or Star Calendars, or Diagonal Star Tables?
The interpretation of the rows of diagonal star tables is controversial. The operation of the diagonal clocks is not suitably established and neither is the exact length of the decanal hours. The "star clock" outline explanation given above follows the work of Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker. In 2007 the Egyptologist Sarah Symons ("A Star's Year: The Annual Cycle in the Ancient Egyptian Sky." In: Steele, John. (Editor).
Calendar and Years: Astronomy and Time in the Ancient Near East (Pages 1-33). ) proposed the more neutral term "diagonal star table." A common past term for diagonal star tables has been "star calendars." The common current term is "diagonal star clocks." However, Sarah Symons points out that just because the rows of diagonal star tables are related to the hours of the night does not necessarily mean that the tables are clocks. As early as 1936 the naturalised American astronomer Alexander Pogo ("Three unpublished calendars from Asyut." (Osiris, Volume I, Pages 500-509).) questioned whether the intended function of the

diagonal star tables was as hourly timekeeping devices. In 1998 the Egyptologist Leo Depuydt "Ancient Egyptian star clocks and their theory." (Bibliotheca Orientalis, Volume LV, Number 1/2, January-April, Pages 5-43).) likewise questioned whether the intended function of the diagonal star tables was as hourly timekeeping devices. See also: Depuydt, Leo. (2010). "Ancient Egyptian star tables: A reinterpretation of their fundamental structure." In: Imhausen, Annette. and Pommerening, Tanja. (Editors). Writings of Early Scholars in the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Rome, and Greece. (Pages 241-276). Depuydt writes (Page 251): "The Earlier and Later star tables represent the yearly motion of the star sky basically in the same way, in spite of the different modes of representation. The focus is on selected nights and what happens in them from evening to morning. The nights in question occur at fixed intervals, either 10 or 15 days, and span the entire year. I am personally convinced that he star tables never served as clocks .... ... If star tables are just records of celestial observation and not clocks, the hours can easily be interpreted as an integral and necessary part of the act of observation. ... The star tables are only one mode of evoking the yearly motion of the stars."
Sarah Symons, McMaster University, Abstract of Presentation: "Comparison of Near-horizon Astronomical Events Recorded in Ancient Egyptian Diagonal Star Tables" (Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop University of Notre Dame X, July 6-10, 2011): Diagonal star tables are Egyptian hieroglyphic texts listing the configuration of certain stars during the night at ten-day intervals. Most of the tables are found on coffin lids dating to the First Intermediate Period and early Middle Kingdom (around 2150 BC). Twenty-two examples are known, of which one will be presented here for the first time. Each column of a diagonal star table typically contains twelve star names. Stars which occur in these tables are known as "decans." The complete, ordered set of stars in a table (spanning up to forty such columns and more than forty stars) is called a "decan list." Previous attempts have been made to classify the tables into groups or taxonomies by considering details of layout. However, with further sources identified, only one classification criterion emerges as significant: the decan list. This criterion divides the surviving tables into two "families," each containing a characteristic decan list. The star tables record that decans performed a certain action, in order, throughout the night. The action in question is commonly thought to be a star's rising, but since the method of observation is never explicitly stated in or near the star tables, this is an assumption. Leitz hypothesised that the action could instead be the setting of stars. This presentation describes a current research project investigating the observational methods which may have been used to construct the original decan lists. Some star names occur in both decan lists, others are unique to one. By comparing occurrences of two decans which are present in both families, it can be shown that the spacing between two such decans is often different in each family. This appears to be in conflict with the motion of real stars in the sky: if two stars rise with a certain time separation, that separation remains constant night after night unless the observer changes location significantly or a large number of years passes. However, if the events being observed are different in one family, the time separation between such decans can and does change. For example, stars that rise together do not necessarily set together. The study investigates my recent proposal that one family of diagonal star tables records rising stars while the other, perhaps intended to be a complementary twin, records setting stars."
More recently: "Stars of the Dead." by Sarah Symons and Elizabeth Tasker (Scientific American, Volume 313, Number 4, October 1, 2015, Pages 70-75). An important article. "Though long thought to serve as a kind of clock for the proper timing of religious rituals at night, these star tables may, recent research suggests, actually have acted more as a map for directing the [newly] dead to new realms of existence in the afterlife among the stars."
"The 70-day period of invisibility of Sirius may have also played an important role in the compilation of the earliest diagonal star tables. There are three types of tables, previously previously known as "star clocks", that were thought to correspond to three stages of a linear revolution of the same system; recent research, however, casts a new light on their function. ... [T]he misleading "clock" has been abandoned in favour of a more neutral and objective definition as "table" or "list". ... Recent research ... suggests that the so-called "transit star clocks" of the New Kingdom, rather than being "clocks", are simply embellished lists of stars that share a common characteristic; a 70-day period of invisibility. This span of time, equal to the period of invisibility of Sirius, corresponded also to the time that conventionally elapsed between death and burial of an individual. When someone died, the corresponding disappearing star was chosen: her heliac, rising, 70 days later, marked the time when the burial would take place. As such these lists may be precursors, rather than successors, of the diagonal star tables ...." (Corinna Rossi (Chapter 21. Science and Technology: Pharaonic. In: A Companion to Ancient Egypt edited by Alan B. Lloyd (2010, 2 Volumes; Volume 1, Pages 390-408, Page 395-396).)

Appendix 2: The Location of the Decans
The identification of the various decan names and their proper astronomical identity is extremely difficult. All of the extant star clocks are corrupt textually. Neugebauer and Parker systematically worked through the decan material. Their results were a meticulous analysis of the evidence. Otto Neugebauer, based on the Book of Nut texts, proposed the decan stars circled the sky in a zone approximately parallel to, and slightly south of, the ecliptic. Conman follows William Petrie in identifying the decans as ecliptic stars (i.e., actually marked out along the ecliptic line). Conman finds agreement with the New Kingdom decanal texts. Conman's proposed solution is also based on the Book of Nut texts and the interpretation of those texts given in the Carlsberg Papyri. Decan models usually propose the decan stars were a belt (1) south of, and parallel to, the ecliptic; (2) a belt roughly following the line of the ecliptic; and (3) a belt near the ecliptic (proximity of the ecliptic). The decans are areas of 10 degrees. The late identification of decans as areas of 10 degrees along the ecliptic is not sufficient reason to assume that this was also the case for the original system of decan stars established during the Old Kingdom period. The original set of rising decan stars were likely south of the ecliptic. The later transit decan stars were perhaps located differently (i.e., roughly followed the line of the ecliptic). See: Belmonte, Juan. (2002) "The Decans and the Ancient Egyptian Skylore: An Astronomical Approach." (Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana, Volume 73 (Special Volume 1), Pages 43-57); and, Lull, José. and Belmonte, Antonio. (2009). "The constellations of ancient Egypt." In: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy. It presently seems agreed that all the decans do not have the same latitude.
Appendix 3: The Different Decan Lists in the Book of Nut
Within the Book of Nut ('Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars') there exist 2 different decan lists that cannot be reconciled with each other. Alexandra von Lieven believes it likely that the list of stars on the body of Nut originates from the Old Kingdom (the astronomical data indicate the 12th-century circa 1850 BCE linked to an ideal rising of the decan Sothis on the New Year's day of the 1st month of the Akhet season) and the data list from the Middle Kingdom is a secondary addition of data from this period (linked to a random point in time). See: von Lieven, Alexandra. (2010). "Translating the Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars." In: Imhausen, Annette. and Pommerening, Tanja. (Editors). Writings of Early Scholars in the Ancient Near East, Egypt, and Greece. (Pages 139-151).
Appendix 4: The Myth of an Advanced Egyptian Astronomy
Egyptian astronomy was inextricably entwined with Egyptian religion. Hieroglyphic inscriptions comprise the most direct sources of Egyptian astronomy.
Most of the surviving documentary evidence for Egyptian astronomy is found on funerary monuments. There are no records of any actual astronomical observations (or mathematical models or precise predictive tables) among the immense mass of documents from Egypt. The lack or records of actual astronomical observations is a puzzle. Late Egyptian astronomical texts are Greek in origin. There are no technical records or writings dealing with Egyptian astronomy until the 1st-millennium BCE, after Egypt's conquest by Persia. Prior to this time the Egyptians used simple astronomical methods to measure time and to develop accurate calendars, as well as to directionally align their buildings. Egyptian astronomy began to flourish after Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great (in the 4th-century BCE). Many of the late Egyptian astronomers, were in fact, of Greek heritage and Egyptian astronomy during this period was, in actuality, Hellenistic in character.
Egyptian astronomy was a lightweight science. Basically, the ancient Egyptians did not apply mathematics to their astronomy. Ancient Egyptian astronomy (that in any way could be called mathematical astronomy) was mostly concerned with practical time reckoning. It consisted mainly of schematic arrangements for the division of the night using decan stars. Egyptian observations were made with the naked eye assisted by a few simple instruments. There is no evidence of a technical vocabulary.
The "star clocks" - which relate star names to times and dates - demonstrate that systematic observations of star movements were made. The lack of mathematical apparatus to describe the positions and motions of celestial objects implies that predictions of planetary behaviour and eclipses was not a priority for Egyptian observers. No records of systematic planetary observations survive before the Greco-Roman era.

Rene Grognard wrote (Historia Matematica, 10 February, 2000):
"Another comment on possible sources of Greek astronomy in Egypt. I don't think that even Herodotus could have made such a claim. Again a long association with Egyptologists (and study of the classical Middle Kingdom language -- for fun) at the nearby Macquarie University gave me no ground to doubt the assessment of Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker ("Egyptian Astronomical Texts"). Egyptian astronomy was far too primitive to serve as basis to Greek astronomy. For instance the most elaborate "relics" of Egyptian astronomy: the Egyptian Star clock systems (using decans in rising as on the early coffin lids or in transit as in Ramesside period) were unworkable because simply based on the civil year of 36 x 10 days + 5 epagomenoi (in Egyptian: "the ones [left] over"). Indeed there were endlessly corrected with the result of a bewildering confusion of surviving evidence painstakingly sifted by Neugebauer & Parker. In fact it might very well be argued that water clocks were finally adopted simply as a more practical device to measure time. There is no text indicating any Egyptian interest in the complexity of celestial motions, exception made for the 70 day period of invisibility between the acronychal (= at dusk) setting and the heliacal rising of Sirius (and the decanal stars) : period "spent" in the Underworld ("dwt") between their "death" and "rising." This period was adopted for the canonical duration of embalmment."
At least outwardly, there are no surviving inscriptions or documents otherwise indicating that Egyptian astronomical knowledge was not more than tomb decoration, and not very carefully managed over time as a body of knowledge. Notwithstanding a number of temple and pyramid alignments, and several papyri codices suggesting a sophisticated knowledge of trigonometry and even algebra, no similar astronomical documents have survived, or records of astronomical observations. All of the early Egyptian astronomical texts are simply crude observational schemes, lacking mathematical elements. The earliest known copies of an almanac date from 1220 BCE at the time of Ramses the Great. Mathematical-astronomical papyri only appear at the beginning of the 2nd-century BCE. This is also the period when astrological papyri appear. Horoscopes and planetary texts, written in Greek or in Demotic (or both), based on computations, appear later. This indicates that Egyptian astrological lore originated in the Ptolemaic period and is a Hellenistic creation. The Vienna papyrus which described lunar and solar eclipses and their portends (omens), was likely copied by a scribe in the late 2nd-century CE, and presents astronomical knowledge that is essentially Babylonian in origin.
Regarding the usual activities of an ancient Egyptian astronomer: "... in an inscription on his statue (ca. 2nd century, B.C.) an astronomer and snake charmer named Harkhebi enumerated his astronomical, calendrical, and time-telling activities, including the observation of the stars and announcements of their risings and settings, his purification on the days when the decan Akh rose heliacally beside Venus, his observations of other heliacal risings, and particularly his foretelling of the heliacal rising of Sirius at the beginning of the [civil] year, and so on." (Ancient Egyptian Science, Volume II by Marshall Clagett, 1995, Page 128.)
Regarding astronomical books in the Edfu temple library: "... the list of books in the library room of the temple of Edfu (built by Ptolemy VIII, Euergetes II, 170-63, 145-116 B.C.). This catalogue ... had books on the Knowledge of the Periodic Returns of the Two Celestial Spirits: the Sun and the Moon, and on The Governing of the Periodic returns of the Stars. As Otto Neugebauer has shown, Clement of Alexandria (2nd. century A.D.) appears to have read that list as he describes the four Hermetic books on astronomy studied by the Egyptian Horoscopist in order that he might know them by heart: books on the arrangement of the fixed stars, on the position of the sun and the moon and the five planets, on the syzygies and phases of the sun and the moon, and on the risings." (Ancient Egyptian Science, Volume II by Marshall Clagett, 1995, Page 491.)
At least at the end of the Hellenistic period the Egyptians had an advanced knowledge of astronomy. The Denderah zodiac shows the inauguration of the Osiris chapels (decorated over the 3 years from 50 to 48 BCE) "took place on December 28, 47 BC (the 26th day of Khoiak) the day of a zenithal full moon, a conjunction that takes place only once every 1,480 years." (Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt edited by Kathryn Bard (1999), "Denderah" by Sylvie Cauville, Page 300.)
See also: Waziry, Ayman. (2016). "Probability Hypothesis and Evidence of Astronomical Observatories in Ancient Egypt." (Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, Volume 2, Number 2, Pages 31-50).
In their Egyptian Astronomical Texts (4 Volumes, 1964-1969). Neugebauer and Parker deal solely with surviving astronomical texts. 3000 years of Egyptian astronomy filled just 3 volumes of text (comprising

some 420 pages only). This is meagre when compared to Babylonian astronomy sources (particularly late Babylonian sources). It is hardly surprising that Neugebauer admired Babylonian astronomy and held ancient Egyptian astronomy in much lower esteem. Archaeological evidence regarding Egyptian temple alignments was not included in the study by Neugebauer and Parker. The ancient Egyptians primarily revered the circumpolar stars and aligned their pyramids almost perfectly to the cardinal directions. However, the recent studies by Belmonte show that most temples appear to be aligned to the River Nile rather than to some significant astronomical direction. A problem in interpretation is that the River Nile flows roughly South to North and the temples are aligned roughly East-West. A significant astronomical alignment can always be found.
Mathematical astronomy did not exist in ancient Egypt. The movements of the celestial objects were only summarily described. The data pertaining to calendars and the so-called 'star clocks' are prone to different interpretations (revisionist views).
Early Egyptian astronomy was practical. The evidence indicates that traditional Egyptian astronomy was concerned primarily with timekeeping and calendar. The newer predictive astronomy from the 3rd-century BCE was connected to astrological prognostication and likely to predate the invention of the Hellenistic of astrology. The several sky observers alluded to in 3rd-century Egyptian texts were directly familiar with Mesopotamian astral omens and horoscopes. Specific evidence for Babylonian influence is Harkhebi's familiarity with the concept of the planetary exaltations in the zodiac.
There are some 44 astronomical/astrological Demotic texts known from the Roman period. These were connected with the Egyptian temple system. The Demotic language is a late stage of ancient Egyptian. These papyri texts date to 1-50 CE. These instructional texts are the only known texts from Greco-Roman Egypt with instructions for computing astronomical phenomena with Babylonian methods.

Appendix 6: The identification of Sothis with Sirius
We do not know for certain with which star or constellation Sothis should be identified for all periods of Egyptian history. Whilst it is generally accepted that Sothis is the star Sirius, none of the sources give any evidence for this from before classical times. According to some Egyptologists Egyptian astronomical names did not always remain attached to the same celestial object. Osiris was first associated with Venus; later Osiris was associated with Jupiter. The planet Venus, which was first identified with Osiris, was later identified with Isis. Similar shifts and uncertainties apply to the identification of ancient astronomical names in general, for example, the constellations in the Old Testament book of Job.
Appendix 15: Egyptian Decan System Unrelated to Babylonian system of the "Three Stars Each"
The system of Egyptian decans did not originate in the Babylonian astral system. There were two systems of decanal stars. The first (and original) system (Old Kingdom period, circa 2800 BCE) used heliacal risings. The second (and later) system used meridian transits (New Kingdom period, circa 1500 BCE). The original system of Egyptian decan stars independently established during the Old Kingdom period were a set of 36 rising stars/asterisms along a single linear star path likely south of the ecliptic. The Babylonian Enuma Elish/Astrolabe/Mul.Apin system of 3 x 12 stars dates to the late 2nd-millennium BCE. The later Babylonian system comprised what may be termed an 'equatorial' system of 3 bands with 12 stars in each band. It is indicated that in the developing Babylonian uranography constellations came and went before the scheme eventually became fixed.

:I Early Egyptian Constellations
19: Northern and southern constellation groups
The ancient Egyptians developed their own constellation system based on important gods/goddesses and animals in their mythology. Their constellations were representations of the gods and goddesses of the night sky. The number of Egyptian constellations was not a extensive as in other contemporary civilizations such as the Babylonians of the Tigris-Euphrates basin. However, the existing evidence makes it certain that the ancient Egyptians had a complete set of constellations covering the entire sky visible from Egypt latitudes. Many of the brighter stars were grouped into constellations/asterisms. For purposes of discussion the ancient Egyptian sky can be divided into northern and southern constellation groups. The northern region of the sky was full of constellations. The southern sky was essentially constellated by a belt of asterisms/stars known as decans. The system of Egyptian astronomy was in some was polar and equatorial. The celestial equator and ecliptic were vaguely/imprecisely recognised by the Egyptians. The Egyptians introduced an equatorial belt of decan stars/asterisms.
Stars which rose and set were called the "unwearying stars" of the southern sky. Stars closest to the north celestial pole - and therefore not rising and setting - were called the "imperishable stars" of the northern sky.
The only northern constellation that can be readily identified with a present-day equivalent is the Great Bear (the Foreleg). The only southern constellation and star name that can be readily identified with a present-day equivalent are Orion (Sah = head and the belt of Orion) and the star Sirius (Septit/Sothis). It is possible that the star cluster "Thousands" represented the distinctive Pleiades cluster.
Evidence for an early Egyptian star cult is found in the Pyramid Texts (a collection of ancient Egyptian religious texts from the time of the Old Kingdom). The Egyptian star cult existed alongside the early solar theology, which had achieved dominance prior to the 5th Dynasty. The 2 systems were joined together but not always successfully syncretized. The major Egyptian theological systems always attempted to incorporate the star gods/goddesses into their own schemes. With the rise of the cult of Osiris the stars came to be called the "followers of Osiris." The most important Egyptian star gods and goddesses were the "Imperishable Ones" - the northern circumpolar stars (which were constantly visible each night). In several of the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings - including those of Seti I and Ramses VI - the night sky is artistically depicted on the ceiling of the burial chamber and many of the important star gods and goddesses are represented and named. The Egyptologist Amanda-Alice Maravelia states the astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Ramesses VI combines images from the Book of the Day and the Book of the Night, together with outstretched diurnal and nocturnal figures of the goddess Nut. (The astronomical paintings in the burial chamber of Ramesses VI appear on a curved ceiling.)
In the New Kingdom period (circa 1500 to 1100 BCE), the classical astronomical representations were painted on temple ceilings (i.e., the Ramesseum ceiling) and on the sepulchral vaults of kings (i.e., the tomb of Senmut/Senenmt). (The Ramesseum (a temple complex which was built for Ramses II, whose reign lasted from 1279 to 1212 BCE) is situated in Upper Egypt at Luxor (formerly known as Thebes) on the west bank of the Nile River.) The oldest monument that includes enough of the overall celestial diagram to enable a good understanding of the whole is contained on the ceiling of the tomb of Senmut (Theban tomb number 353).

The "astronomical ceilings," some from tombs and some from temples, are amongst the most important surviving Egyptian "astronomical documents." These particular ceilings contain decorative motifs and were designed to provide both a symbolic and schematic summary of astronomical knowledge. During the 1930s the astronomer Alexander Pogo (then working at Harvard University (following his 1929 appointment as a Fellow in the History of Science by the Carnegie Institution)) conducted investigations of Egyptian astronomy and (1) first recognised the astronomical content of inscriptions on coffin lids from the end of the Middle Kingdom, and (2) the relationship between these simple pictures and the elaborate representations on the tomb ceilings of kings of the New Kingdom period.
All of the northern constellation figures are not located in the same positions on Egyptian tombs and ceilings. The northern constellations dawn on the ceiling of the burial chamber in the tomb of Seti I (19th dynasty) are positioned differently to the same northern constellations drawn in the tomb of Senenmut/Senmut (18th dynasty), likely due to lack of space. This makes it difficult to determine correspondence between the ancient Egyptian constellations and out current constellations.
The tradition of including astronomical ceilings in tombs and temples continues throughout the late period of Egyptian history and remained relatively unchanged/constant until the introduction of the Greek zodiac. By the 1st-century BCE, the Egyptian circumpolar group and decans were supplemented by the foreign constellations of the zodiac - most notably in the Greco-Roman temples of Dendera, Edfu, and Esna. Greek zodiacal figures became blended with more traditional Egyptian astronomical imagery. The earliest known example is an image with figures from the Greek zodiac appearing in the Temple of Khnum at Esna circa 200 BCE.
It would appear that by the late 2nd-millennium BCE the Egyptians had divided the sky into a small number of very large constellations. By circa 1100 BCE, not including the 36 decans, an Egyptian 'Catalog of the Universe' had marked the sky with 5 or 6 very large constellations (including such animal figures as the Hippopotamus, Ox, and Crocodile). Two of these constellations were similar to the Western constellations Orion and Ursa Major. (In 1100 BCE Amenhope wrote the 'Catalog of the Universe.' Though it identifies the major constellations known at that time it curiously does not mention either Sirius or any of the planets previously known to the Egyptians.) As the Egyptians were accustomed to regard the whole sky as a figure of the goddess Nut, supported on hands and feet, it posed no difficulties for them to develop constellation figures of half that extent. (The constellation figure of Nekht ("mighty man") must, by the description of its hourly parts, have extended over 6 hours.) During the 1st-millennium BCE these constellations would be divided further into some 25 constellations. The grouping of constellations around (and including) the Big Dipper stars is conveniently described as the northern group of constellations. The designation is not necessarily restricted to the circumpolar stars. Using the tomb of Seti I and Senmut as a guide the northern group of constellations included a lying lion, a crocodile, a bull's foreleg (also represented as a complete bull (with short legs)), a boatman, a giant man, and/or a huge female hippopotamus (with a crocodile tail) carrying an entire crocodile on her back. (At least the crocodile (of varying size) is standing against the back of the hippopotamus.) Additional Senmut tomb figures with the northern constellations include a pole, Selket (the scorpion goddess), a constellation named Anu (falcon-headed god/man in the apparent act of spearing the bull). The female hippopotamus has both a Merekhet (astronomical instrument) and a crocodile in her hands.
In the late 19th-century the British Egyptologist Peter le Page Renouf (1822-1897) discussed and identified a number of Egyptian constellations. Amongst his identifications he established that mshtyw (Meskhetyu), the Bull's Foreleg, was the asterism of the Plough. There was also early general acceptance that Sopdet was Sirius, and Sah was substantial parts of Orion. In cases where Sah is represented by a complete Bull or a Bull's foreleg with an attached bull's head it might be extended from substantial parts of Orion to include nearby areas of Ursa Major. (Some Egyptian constellation identifications were also made by the pioneering German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch (1883), and later by the British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1940).
In 1985 Kurt Locher (also using the tomb of Seti I and Senmut as a guide ?) offered his view that the circumpolar constellations could be identified as Crocodile, Hippopotamus, Chain, Mooring Posts, (God) Anu, and Foreleg. However, it is more difficult to determine correspondence between the ancient Egyptian constellations and our present-day Western constellations. All of the northern constellation figures are not located in the same positions on Egyptian tombs and ceilings. The northern constellation figures drawn on the ceiling of the burial chamber in the tomb of Seti I (19th Dynasty) are positioned differently to the same

northern constellation figures drawn in the tomb of Senmut (Senenmut) (18th Dynasty). Because the northern constellation figures represented in tombs are not consistently arranged in the same positions it is not possible to make identifications between these constellations and our current Western constellations.
Also in 1985 the Egyptologist Virginia Davis tentatively suggested the following identifications for 11 Egyptian constellations: Falcon-headed human = Ursa Minor, Bird = Leo Minor, Large crocodile = Hydra, Small crocodile = Cancer, "Man in front" = Gemini, Scorpion-goddess = Virgo, Hippopotamus with crocodile on back = Ophiuchus + Libra + Scorpio, "Man behind the bull" = Boötes, and Cord(s) and stake = Hercules + Libra + Scorpio.
The most recent and the most satisfactory likely identifications of ancient Egyptian constellations (with modern Western constellations) is set out in Table 6.1 (Pages 162-163) in Lull, José. and Belmonte, Antonio. (2009). "The constellations of ancient Egypt." In: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy. Identifications are made for 41 ancient Egyptian constellations (32 of which are deemed 'firm').
The northern (circumpolar) stars were called lkhemu-sek (imperishable stars), because they never sink below the horizon. The southern stars were called lkhemu-wredj (unwearying stars), because they rose on the eastern horizon and set on the western horizon. The term "unwearying stars" was likely applied because the southern stars, especially those in the region of the celestial equator, traveled a longer distance (compared to the circumpolar northern stars) from their rising above the eastern horizon to their setting beneath the western horizon. The ecliptic can be conveniently used as an arbitrary dividing line between the northern constellations and the southern constellations. (Virginia Davis usefully proposed that the Milky Way would have been the boundary between the northern and southern skies of of ancient Egypt.) The southern group of constellations was essentially formed by the belt of individual stars and asterisms comprising the decanal belt. The goddess Nut was the Milky Way. From the New Kingdom Period astronomical ceilings and water clocks show a clear distinction is now established between the northern sky and its constellations and the southern sky and its constellations/asterisms (i.e., decanal stars).
It appears the oldest existing northern constellation is Meskhetyw (the foreleg of a bull). This constellation appears on the inside of a coffin lid excavated at Asyut and dating from the First Intermediate Period (circa 2145 BCE to circa 2025 BCE). To the left of the foreleg is vertical hieroglyphic writing stating Meskhetyw m pet (Meskhetyw in the northern sky). Many monuments with so-called astronomical ceilings include a panel depicting a group of presumed "northern" constellations oriented about the Big Dipper. These are usually termed the "Northern Constellations." However, the changing arrangements of these particular constellations and their accompanying gods/goddesses from monument to monument makes their identification (except for the Big Dipper) extremely difficult if not impossible. Without the certain identification of these constellations it cannot be concluded that all of them are necessarily circumpolar, as is usually said. (Rolf Krauss (1997) proposed that the "Imperishable Stars" are to be identified with certain circumpolar and noncircumpolar stars situated north of the ecliptic.) However, because the ancient Egyptians conventionally distinguished 2 groups of stars, namely the Imperishable Stars, which are the circumpolar stars that do not set, and the Unwearying Stars, which are the decans and planets, it is likely the constellations depicted around the Big Dipper are circumpolar.
Two identifiable constellations among the southern Egyptian star groups are Sah (corresponding to the current Orion's belt) and Sepdet (corresponding to Sirius). Due to Sah rising 1 hour before Sirius in the decanal tables Sah is commonly interpreted by Egyptologists as the constellation Orion. The name Sah is first found in the "Pyramid Text" engraved in the pyramid of Unas (the last king of the 5th Dynasty Old Kingdom). He reigned circa 2340 BCE to circa 2320 BCE. The figures of both Sah and Sepdet appear on wooden coffin lids dating between the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom.
An alternative name for the "Bull's thigh (= Foreleg of the bull)", which was the "big dipper" asterism, was "The foreleg of Seth." The Boatman comprised Orion's belt and some other stars. The Hippopotamus was identified with the goddess Isis - at least on astronomical ceilings in the New Kingdom Period (1570-1070 BCE). The Hippopotamus and the Giant Man took up about half the sky.
One of the few constellations that is unambiguously identifiable is the constellation of Orion (Sah). However, the association of names with its individual stars is indeterminate. (The only one of the decans that is able to

be unambiguously identified is Sirius (Sepdet).) A coffin lid provides the only other certain constellation identification from ancient Egypt. A scene on a coffin lid depicts the 7 stars of the Big Dipper asterism (part of Ursa Major) in the form of the foreleg (thigh) of an Ox (not Taurus) and is named Meskhetyw (Meskheitu (Mshtyw)). (This constellation is not part of the decanal system or the star tables.) It is the only example of a pattern of stars being actually drawn in approximately the known configuration. (The Hippopotamus (or hippo-crocodile constellation) is commonly identified with the stars of Draco, the Dragon.)
Above is a reconstruction (by Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker (EAT, Volume 3, Text)) of the arrangement of the ancient Egyptian northern constellations depicted on the Senmut ceiling.
The 'mooring-post' (which looks like a knife) represents the North Pole of the sky. It is possible that the star cluster "Thousands" presents the Pleiades.
The Senmut tomb has the oldest intact representation of the northern constellations. (The tomb dates about 3 centuries later than the coffin lids with decanal/diagonal calendars.) The circumpolar constellations were important to the Egyptians because they never appeared before the rising sun. As such they were often linked with the powers of darkness and with ferocious animals. The (unfinished) tomb of Senmut is located at Deir el-Bahri, Luxor. (Senmut was an architect and the vezir of Queen Hatshepsut.) It dates to circa 1473 BCE. This is approximately three centuries latter than the astronomical inscriptions on coffin lids from the end of the Middle Kingdom. The tomb has the earliest preserved ceiling discovered to date. Whilst placing representations of the sky on ceilings is quite logical the practice also contributes to their easy destruction.
On the ceiling of the decorated chamber there is a decan list and planets (excepting Mars), northern constellations and deities, and lunar calendar. Included in the northern constellation figures are a lying lion, a crocodile,
The arrangement of the ancient Egyptian northern constellations on the astronomical ceiling of Hall K of the tomb of Seti I. No written record survives for identifying the constellations depicted.
Seti I (reigned 1303-1290 BCE) was the son and heir of Ramses I. The tomb of Seti I is located in the Valley of the Kings, Luxor. It is the next well-preserved astronomical ceiling after that of Senmut's tomb. It has close parallels in the tomb of Ramses IV (Dynasty XX, circa 1100 BCE) and later Egyptian rulers. The

content of the vaulted ceiling of Hall K comprises a decan list and planets with deities, northern constellations and deities.
Also contained within the Seti I tomb are decorations of the complete versions of the Book of the Dead, the Book of the Gates, the Book of the Caverns, the Book of the Day, the Book of the Night, and the Book of the Cow of Heaven. Further, there is the text of the Deliverance of Mankind, and the Litany of the Sun.
The papyrus Carlsberg 1, though written more than 1000 years after the Seti 1 text, is a commentary to these inscriptions.
The astronomical ceiling (Denderah zodiac) located at the temple of Hathor in Denderah, Egypt dates to the Late Ptolemaic Period (i.e., late Hellenistic Period). The representation of the Egyptian sky is called the Denderah zodiac because it depicts the (Babylonian-Greek) zodiacal constellations (and other Egyptian constellations). (All Egyptian zodiacs are late and originated in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.) Construction began on the temple of Hathor circa 125 BCE and it was finished circa 60 CE. The Denderah circular zodiac itself is dated circa 36 BCE or 30 BCE. It is the oldest known representation of the zodiac. In the coffin of Heter (which dates to circa 125 CE) we have an astronomical representation that resembles the tomb ceiling (north side) of Seti I. However, the imported Greek-Babylonian zodiac figures are drawn separate to the traditional Egyptian constellation figures. The dominating female figure is the Egyptian sky goddess Nut. The zodiacal constellations flank her.
Appendix 1: The Oldest Existing Northern Constellation
The circumpolar stars were of great importance to the Egyptians. They represented solemnity of stellar movement, eternity of time, and stability of the celestial sphere.
The oldest existing northern constellation is "Meskhetyw" (the foreleg of the bull) which appears on the interior of a coffin lid dating from the First Intermediate Period (from circa 2145 BCE to circa 2025 BCE) and excavated at Asyut. On the left of the foreleg is vertical hieroglyphic writing stating "Meskhetyw m pet mehetet" (Meskhetyw in the northern sky). An alternative name for the "Bull's thigh (= Foreleg of the bull)", which was the "big dipper" asterism, was "The foreleg of Seth."
Appendix 2: Astronomical Ceilings
The "astronomical ceilings" from tombs and temples provide an important schematic summary of the astronomical knowledge of the Egyptians. There are about 20 astronomical wall paintings depicting the northern constellations, dating back to the 15th-century BCE. The astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut (at Deir el Bari in Luxor), and the circular zodiac of the temple of Hathor (at Denderah) are both masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.
The oldest known example of an "astronomical ceiling" is from the second or "secret" tomb of Senmut, dating to the 15th-century BCE (painted circa 1460 BCE), which is located to the east of Deir el-Bahri in the western Theban necropolis. The ceiling of this tomb is unfinished. It is, however, the best preserved of all the surviving examples of "astronomical ceilings." The ceiling is divided into northern and southern panels. The upper portion of the southern panel contains a list of decans showing their relation to the star clocks. Also portrayed are a number of constellations: the ship, the sheep, Osiris in a boat (Orion), and Isis in a boat (Sothis). The centre of the northern panel features a set of figures representing the northern circumpolar constellations. (The planets Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn are also included.)
Other examples of "astronomical ceilings" are: (1) the ceiling of the second hypostyle hall of the Ramesseum (dated circa 1213 BCE); (2) the mortuary temple of Rameses II on the ceiling of Hall K in tomb KV 17 belonging to Seti I. Nearly all "astronomical ceilings" include some representation of the northern constellations and the decanal stars.
Egyptian representations of stars frequently have a circle in the middle. Examples include the funerary temples of Sahure, and Pepy II; and the Sun Temple of Niuserre, and Tutankhamen's shrines. Stars can also be represented as circles (i.e., without holes). The explanation given by J. D. Degreef (2002) is: "Ordinarily when one looks at a star, it's just a dot of light, hence the small circle. The branches are caused by diffraction in the air or in the anterior parts of the eye. So a circle with branches isn't a bad representation of a star."

In 2010 a brightly coloured astronomical ceiling was discovered at the South Asasif (Assasif) necropolis. The necropolis is comprised of Late Period tombs - the 3 largest tombs there date to the 25th- early 26th Dynasties.
Appendix 3: The Goddess Nut
Nut was the ancient Egyptian goddess of the heavens and sky. The ancient Egyptians conceived of the goddess Nut as a naked female who arches her body across the sky (basically east to west and like the arc of the sky) in a protective posture over the earth. Nut's fingers and toes were believed to touch the 4 cardinal points or directions. A myth, recorded in dynastic times, has the god Ra entering Nut's mouth, passing through her starry body, and emerging, reborn, from her loins. According to the astronomer Ronald Wells her figure, during the 3rd-millennium BCE, the Milky Way was believed to represent the goddess Nut. In his 1996 essay (but originally suggested in 1994) "Astronomy in Egypt" (in: Astronomy Before the Telescope) Ronald Wells theorized that the Egyptians equated Nut's body with the Milky Way, seeing her head in our constellation Gemini, and her birth canal in Cygnus, where cosmic dust clouds split the Milky Way into two "legs." He pointed out that early in Egyptian prehistory, about 6,500 years ago, the Sun would have set just before Gemini-Nut's head-at the spring equinox, as if swallowed by the goddess. Nine months later, at the winter solstice, the Sun, reborn, would have risen very close to Cygnus, as if emerging from the birth canal. However, many Egyptologists and archaeoastronomers consider this particular theory of Ronald Wells as highly speculative.
Appendix 4: The Supposed Egyptian Origin of the Greek Ship Constellation Argo
The constellation Argo was well attested in the Hellenistic period. The suggestion that the Argo was made a constellation in conformity with Egyptian astronomical lore (i.e., the supposition that the ship of Osiris was set in the night sky) can be rejected. (Franz Boll in his masterwork Sphaera (1903) rejected the suggestion.) The ship of Osiris traversed the underworld, not the night sky. This fact ensures the ship of Osiris could not have been an Egyptian constellation. It is likely that the identification of the ship of Osiris with the Argo is a Greek idea.
Appendix 5: Aries in Senemut's tomb?
The Ram was an important cult figure in both ancient Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations - but perhaps not a constellation. Does the south wall of Senemut clearly show a ram as a constellation in Egypt in 1470 BC? The ceiling of Senmut's tomb depicts decans, constellations, and planets. According to the astronomer Juan Belmonte the southern constellation (decan) sit or srt (seret) on the ceiling of Senmut's tomb could be a sheep (woolly usually horned ruminant mammal related to the goat), ram (male sheep), or goat (hollowhorned bearded ruminant mammal related to the sheep) = Capricornus or perhaps the stars in the area of Grus and Piscis Austrinus. (See: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (2009, Reprinted 2010). (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy.) This constellation/decan was not connected with the stars of Aries. The zodiacal Ram is a Greek constellation. When the Greeks borrowed the zodiacal system from Babylonian uranography the Babylonian constellation of the "Hired Man" was replaced by the Ram. The Greeks changed the Babylonian zodiacal constellation "Hired Man" into Aries and the Romans later reintroduced the Babylonian zodiacal constellation Libra. (The constellation Libra was included in the Babylonian zodiac but was later described by Hellenistic astronomers, such as Ptolemy, as "'the claws' of the great Scorpio.") "The first sign of the zodiac, represented since Roman times as a ram, was originally referred to by the Babylonians as MUL.LU.HUN.GA (Akk. mul.lu.agru) "the hireling." Two orthographic variants encountered include the transparent abbreviations (MUL.)HUN and and HUN.GA. A third variant (MUL.)LU, common to Seleucid astronomical texts, is generally taken to be a homophonic substitution for the otherwise unattested abbreviation *LU. The LU-sign, however, may also be read UDU, the usual Sumerogram for Akk. immeru "a ram." Since the HUN and LU signs are paleographically quite similar in the late Babylonian ductus and the celestial hireling was equated with Dumuzi, the shepherd par excellence of Sumerian literature, some form of punning may have led to the metamorphosis of this sign from the hireling to the ram in Hellenistic Babylonia rather than later and elsewhere. Seals depicting rams en passant, with heads forward or reversed, are known from throughout the Hellenistic period in Uruk." ("Zodiacal Signs among the Seal Impressions from Hellenistic Uruk" by Ronald Wallenfels (Pages 282-283). In: The Tablet and the Scroll edited by Mark Cohen, et. al. (1993).)

Appendix 6: Identification of Ancient Egyptian Constellations
It has proved extremely difficult to identify the ancient Egyptian constellations/asterisms with their modern Western constellation equivalents. There is still unresolved controversy over the identification of the constellation figures displayed on Egyptian tomb ceilings. The most recent and the most satisfactory likely identifications of ancient Egyptian constellations (with modern Western constellations) is set out in Table 6.1 (Pages 162-163) in Lull, José. and Belmonte, Antonio. (2009). "The constellations of ancient Egypt." In: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy. Identifications are made for 32 ancient Egyptian constellations. (José Lull is an Egyptologist and amateur astronomer and Juan Belmonte is an astrophysicist working in archaeoastronomy and an amateur Egyptologist.) In Table 6.2 (Page 163) Lull and Belmonte set out 9 further constellation identifications that are subject to disagreement. The 41 constellations (note that due to font limitations the transliterated constellation names are mostly approximate only) are:

:J Late Egyptian Constellations
20: Denderah zodiac
Photograph of the astronomical ceiling (dating to the Late Ptolemaic Period (i.e., late Hellenistic Period)) that was located at the temple of Hathor in Denderah, Egypt. The temple of Hathor was built during the Ptolemaic era. (The ruins at Denderah consist mainly of the remains of a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis. The Great Temple of Hathor at Denderah is one of the best preserved of all the temples in Egypt. It is devoted mainly to the Egyptian goddess Hathor.) The circular layout of the Denderah zodiac resembles a

planisphere, which it is likely not. (However, Neugebauer and Parker (EAT, 1960-1968) concluded that the circular Denderah zodiac attempts to accurately represent the night sky.) The circular representation of the Egyptian sky is commonly called the Denderah zodiac (or Denderah E) because it depicts the Babylonian/Greek zodiacal constellations. All Egyptian zodiacs are late and originated in the Hellenistic (Ptolemaic) and Roman periods. (The Ptolemaics were a Greek dynasty originating from the break-up of the Greek Empire after the death of Alexander the Great. The Ptolemaic Period lasted from 332 BCE until 30 BCE (the early Christian era).) (The temple was used primarily for the celebration of the new year.) There are 36 "decans" around the circumference. The constellations shown inside the circle of "decans" include the 12 signs of the zodiac, corresponding to an Egyptian iconography. As example: Aquarius is represented as Hapy, the god of the Nile flood, pouring water from two vases. The Egyptian constellations of the northern sky (there were some 9 of these) appear in the centre. These include the Great Bear (Ursa Major) in the form of a bull's foreleg. A hippopotamus goddess, opposite Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, represents the constellation of the Dragon. The 5 planets that were known at the time are also included. Venus ("the god of the morning") is behind Aquarius, Jupiter ("Horus who Reveals the Mystery") is near Cancer, Mars ("Horus the Red") is directly above Capricorn. Mercury is called "the Inert" and Saturn "Horus the Bull."
All the Egyptian zodiacs are late (Hellenistic period, 200 BCE onwards) and incorporate the Greek zodiacal signs. See the MA thesis, Emory University: Stewart, Devon. (2010). Conservation and Innovation: The Zodiac in Egyptian Art.
All Egyptian zodiacs originated in the Greco-Roman period. Greece introduced the Babylonian zodiac (Babylonian-Greek zodiac and zodiacal astrology) into Egypt. At Denderah the 12 (intrusive) Babylonian/Greek zodiacal constellations are surrounded by Egyptian constellations. The Egyptian zodiacs which appeared during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods not only included the Greek signs of the zodiac but the old hour decans (probably no longer in use to mark the hours of the night), the planets, and other Egyptian stars or constellations as well (like the Big Dipper and the Hippopotamus). (The Babylonian-Greek astrological system was brought into Egypt by the Ptolemies in the 4th-century BCE.) The so-called Denderah zodiac is one of the oldest extant and most comprehensive representations of the constellations to have been made. Thought the Egyptian zodiacs were ultimately of Babylonian origin the Babylonian system of degrees was not adopted in ancient Egypt. There was no use of a system of degrees in ancient Egypt to measure celestial arcs.
The syncretic merging of traditional Egyptian "astronomical" iconography for the stars, constellations, and planets with recent Greek "astrological" iconography for the Babylonian-Greek 12-sign zodiac occurred during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. The Greek astrological zodiac was a divination/magical system. Otto Neugebauer believed that with the Denderah zodiac the Egyptians did not want to lose any possible magic, so they represented both the Egyptian and Greek systems on the one planisphere even though in principle the 2 systems overlapped.
The earliest known Egyptian zodiac (the so-called Esna A zodiac) was rectangular and situated in the temple of Khoum 2.5 miles (approximately 4 kilometres) northwest of the town of Esna. It was located in a part of the temple that originated in the reigns of Ptolemy III-V. Hence it dated from circa 200 BCE. The temple was destroyed in 1843 to build a canal and the zodiac was destroyed along with it. The Esna A rectangular zodiac is preserved in a plate in the multi-volume Description de l’Egypte (1809-1829).
The best-known Egyptian zodiac is the so-called Denderah (circular) zodiac. The zodiac was situated in the ceiling in a middle room (pronaos = portico) of the small eastern Osiris chapel located on the roof of the Hathor temple - specifically on the western half of the ceiling of the central (i.e., first enclosed) chamber and formed the greater part of the ceiling. Several sources state it formed one half of the ceiling. (It is essentially comprised of two concentric circles. The entire disk is approximately 240 centimetres (2.5 metres) in diameter (width). The circular star map is approximately 150 centimetres in diameter. Its thickness is approximately 90 centimetres. The weight of the two huge blocks of (red) sandstone comprising the disc (after sawing to reduce thickness to aid removal) is approximately 3 short tons/2.72 metric tons (6000 pounds/2722 kilograms).) At the time of the removal of the Denderah circular zodiac the ceiling was composed of 3 great slabs of sandstone placed together so closely that the joins were not visible. One of these slabs contained almost the whole of the zodiac. The 2nd slab, which occupied the middle of the ceiling, contained the remainder of the zodiac. The 3 slabs were almost of the same dimensions, each was 3 feet (= 0.9 metres) thick, and each weighed approximately 40,000 pounds (= 18,180 kilograms). To aid ease of

removal of the 2 slabs containing the circular zodiac Jean Lelorrain reduced the thickness of each of these by approximately 1 foot (= 0.3 metres). The largest of the 2 slabs taken is approximately 8 feet long (= 2.5 metres) and 6 feet wide (= 1.8 metres), the other slab is is about the same length as the first but only about 3 feet wide (= 0.9 metres).
It is uncertain whether the apparent joint that passes through the middle of the carving is due to limitations on the size of the stone blocks originally used, or whether it was sawn through to make it easier to remove and transport to Paris. Looking at the figures near the apparent joint it is indicated that some serious damage occurred during removal and/or transport
Construction began on the temple of Hathor circa 125 BCE and was finished circa 60 CE. The pronaos/portico was commissioned by the Roman emperor Tiberius, as an addition to the late Ptolemaic chapel. (The Denderah circular zodiac is dated circa 36 BCE or 30 BCE. It is the oldest known representation of the zodiac.)
Accounts differ as to who discovered the Denderah circular zodiac. One source states it was discovered in 1798 by Louis Chastel, a captain of dragoons. Another source states it was first discovered in 1799 by Napoleon's General Louis Desaix (Dessaix) when he was pursuing the remnants of Murad-Bey's army (up the Nile) across the Thebaid (near Luxor). General Louis Desaix (Dessaix) made a brief visit as his army marched by the temple. It would seem that Napoleon's troops reached Denderah on 25th May 1799.
Accounts of who sketched (or re-sketched) the Denderah skymap, and when, tend to be a bit confusing. The French artist Vivant (I have also seen his first name appear as Dominique) Denon was the first to make a drawing of the Denderah planisphere. Vivant Denon accompanied Napoleon's Egyptian expedition and he was commissioned by General Louis Desaix (Dessaix) to do such for the projected Description de l'Egypte. The ceiling was rapidly sketched by the artist in 1799. (Denon's drawings at Denderah were done under considerable time pressure and many of them were completed later in France. Some drawings contain quite imaginary details.) The artist published the drawing in his 1802 account (a massive folio book titled Voyage) of his experiences traveling with Napoleon's Egyptian expedition. Vivant Denon's published drawing of what appeared to be a zodiac created immediate interest and caused immense discussion in Paris. In 1820 it was redrawn by Vivant Denon's compatriot the Italian scientist Girolamo Segato.
It would appear that the actual drawing/engraving of the Denderah zodiac ("The Round Denderah B Zodiac") that appeared in Description de l'Egypte was made by the French scholars Jean Jollois and René Devilliers (both scientists) also whilst accompanying Napoleon's Egyptian expedition (1798-1801). This was a more exact drawing. It was later published circa 1815 in the multi-volume Description de l'Egypte (Volume 4). (The drawing/engraving is not a completely accurate rendition of the actual ceiling.)
The British consul Henry Salt had attempted to acquire the ceiling for the British Museum but the French publisher and antiquities dealer/collector Sebastian Saulnier proposed the possibility of detaching the zodiac from the ceiling and bringing it to Paris. Circumstances prevented him from personally undertaking the task. He delegated the task. Sebastian Saulnier employed a French engineer/master mason, Jean Baptiste Lelorrain (also identified as Claude Lelorrain), as his agent to remove the sandstone slab and arrange its transport to France by ship. Jean Lelorrain left for Egypt in early October, 1820 with some specially constructed tools. The Zodiac was 12 feet (3.7 metres) across and 3 feet (0.92 metres) thick. Lelorrain estimated its weight to be approximately 20 tonnes (20,000 kilograms/44092.5 pounds) After considerable effort at sawing and pulling he eventually made careful use of gun powder to blow holes in the temple roof to effect the removal of the ceiling (= 2 key slabs?). Using stone saws and some gunpowder its thickness was halved. It was cut into 2 parts and the parts were lowered down the side of the temple. It was then dragged to the Nile River and loaded on a boat. It took 16 days to cover the 6.5 kilometres (4 miles, but some accounts state 6 miles) to the River Nile. Other problems faced included the River Nile was at its lowest ebb and an 18-metre (60-foot) earth ramp had to be built to slide the stone slabs down to the water's edge. The boat Lelorrain was trying to load the stone slabs onto nearly sank under the weight.
Sources differ regarding permission given to remove the Denderah zodiac. According to the Louvre website the Zodiac of Denderah was transported to France in 1821 with the permission of Egyptian ruler Muhammed Ali Pasha (who apparently was bribed). (Apparently, aside from the permission of Muhammed Ali Pasha (and knowledge of his agents), the expedition was secret. The date given for this secret expedition is 1822

but this is obviously an error and likely 1820/1821 is meant.) Muhammed Ali Pasha (circa 1769-1848) (also variously/commonly known as Pasha Mehmet Ali, Mehmet Ali Pasha) was Pasha and Viceroy of Egypt. Pasha was a high rank in the Ottoman Empire political and military system; Viceroy was an office, a regal official who ran a country as the representative of the ruling monarch. Lelorrain obtained a vaguely worded firman (permit/administrative order issued by or in the name of a Middle Eastern sovereign/monarch) from Muhammed Ali Pasha that grant him permission to explore and excavate. (One writer states that General Louis Desaix - with the permission of the Egyptian ruler Mohamed Ali Pasha - made the decision to remove the ceiling to France.)
The circular Denderah zodiac is one of the most famous Egyptian monuments preserved in France.
The original sandstone carving was moved from Denderah in 1821, on July 18, 1821, Lelorrain embarked the Zodiac for Marseilles, and it arrived by ship (the La Lorainne) at Marseilles on September 9, 1821. Due to quarantine restrictions it was not off-loaded until November 27. It arrived in Paris in 1822 and was put on show until it was sold to King Louis XVIII for 150,000 francs. (Public pressure had led to Sebastian Saulnier being paid this enormous sum of money for the zodiac.) It was then placed in the royal library (which later became the Bibliothéque Nationale). In 1919 (1920?) it was moved to the Louvre Museum, Paris where it was initially placed on display in the Grand Gallery on the ground floor. It was then moved several times and even located on a stairway. Since 1997 it has been in the Galerie D'Alger. (A plaster replica (a cast made from the original zodiac) only is now in the ceiling of the Osiris chapel at the Denderah temple. This mould from the original zodiac was made and sent to Egypt in 1920.)
English visitors arrived at Denderah prior to 1820.
The removal of the round/circular zodiac was prompted by chronological considerations. It was believed it could be used (along with the linear/rectangular zodiac in the pronaos (a room prior to the naos ("dwelling of a god/goddess"), or sanctuary) of the same temple complex) to determine the age of ancient Egyptian civilization, and consequently its relation to biblical events, could be determined.
Once it had possession of the original zodiac the French government declined to ratify the agreement entered into by Napoleon Bonaparte for the purchase of Castex's sculpture. Nevertheless, Castex continued the completion of his sculptured copy. It was purchased by an English speculator for sale to a British museum or private individual.
It would appear that a marble copy of the Denderah star map, carved by the French artist and sculptor JeanJacques Castex (1731-1821) in 1819 from casts (i.e., squeezes) of a one-third size wax model previously made (during the actual Napoleonic expedition to Egypt), is located in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Napoleon had originally contracted with Castex to produce a marble version of the wax model. However, the restoration government refused to honour Napoleon's contract. After (before?) Castex's death the marble carving came into the possession of a British speculator.
The first appearance in Egypt of our own 12 zodiacal constellations comes from the so-called Zodiac of Denderah. All available evidence indicates that the concept of the zodiac was not native to Egypt but that it was imported at a late (but unknown) date. (Perhaps during the period of the expansion of the Assyrian Empire. More likely it was introduced by the Greeks during the Hellenistic period.) The Egyptians were willing to adopt a new view of the celestial world in the form of the Greek zodiac. This late development was placed side by side on the Denderah zodiac with the traditional Egyptian astronomical representation. The Denderah star map integrates ancient Egyptian star-groups with the zodiacal constellations of the Babylonians (and Greeks). The Babylonian zodiac has been integrated into the Egyptian sky. (The French Egyptologist Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt has argued for an Egyptian origin of the zodiacal signs. She connects them with the cycle of the sun and Osiris.) The constellation figures outside the zodiac (except the Southern Fish, which was regarded as part of the Waterman) are Egyptian. (The identity of most of the other (purely Egyptian) constellation symbols remain unknown.)
The organisation of the zodiac is not haphazard but also it is not considered a very accurate astronomical representation. (None of the Egyptian zodiacs were very accurate astronomical representations.) (Like all the Egyptian zodiacs it includes the signs of the zodiac (ultimately of Babylonian origin), the old hour decans, the planets, and native Egyptian stars and constellations.) The astronomical ceiling shows all 12 zodiacal

constellations (as well as other constellations, and the planets). The constellations are shown in the centre. It is a syncretistic zodiac based on Egyptian and Greek ideas and is most likely based on a Hellenistic model (i.e., from the use of the zodiacal Ram). The figures of 36 traditional Egyptian decans (from the Tanis family of decans), indicators of the hours of the night, are the outermost ring of figures in the circle, depicted standing on the circumference (as walking men, snakes, and other animals) (adjacent to the hands of the supporting figures). (The 36 decans/spirits, stand in a circle around the stars, = one for each ten days in the Egyptian year.) The signs of the zodiac are located inside the decan ring and the planets in their exaltations and some constellations are interspersed among them. (The planets are depicted as gods holding staffs.) The innermost figures are Egyptian constellations. The northern constellations are in the centre of the disc (and the north celestial pole is approximately at the centre of the disc). (These innermost figures are surrounded by Greek zodiacal constellation figures mixed with images of gods representing the planets.)
The decans - appearing around the outer rim - are included in the same frame as the constellations of the northern sky, and are grouped so that 3 decans belong to each of the 12 zodiacal signs. The single decan located between Gemini and Cancer is thought by Gyula Priskin (2015) to represent the 5 epagomenal days added to the core year of 360 days, for intercalation.
The 12 zodiacal constellations form an inner (and properly offset) ring (and follow a circle that corresponds to the ecliptic). All the 12 zodiac constellations are easily recognizable. The Egyptians, however, have varied the figures and also have varied the attitudes of the figures from those of the Babylonian-Greek sky. The identification of the zodiacal constellations can be made in clockwise sequence near the eccentric circle at the centre of the star map. (The positioning of the constellations Cancer and Libra is irregular.) To the right of centre are located the two fishes (Pisces), next (below the fishes) the Ram and the Bull, next the Twins, the Crab (Cancer), and the Lion. More upwards the Virgin with the Corn-Ear, the Balance, and the Scorpion. The next three zodiacal constellations/signs are the Archer, the Goat-fish, (Capricorn), and the Waterman.
Cancer the Crab is represented by the Scarab Beetle. The figure of the Lion near the Scales (which is not the zodiacal Lion) is the constellation Centaurus. A man and a woman with joined hands represent Gemini. The Ram and the Bull are both reversed from their normal pose, and the figure of the Bull is complete, not the usual truncated (half) figure. The woman (Isis?) who holds a spike of wheat is an obvious representation of Virgo. (Also, the female figure standing on the Lion's tail, which she grasps with her hand, has been interpreted by some as representing Virgo.) The Scales point in a different direction, the Waterman's vessel and stream of water are on the reverse side of his body; the zodiacal Fishes swim in parallel directions instead of divergent ones.
Each zodiacal figure/sign has has its 3 decanal stars at the outer edge of the panel.
The familiar northern Egyptian constellations of the Bull's Foreleg ((part of) Ursa Major, the Big Dipper asterism) and the Hippopotamus (Draco, the Dragon) are easily identifiable. (The northern constellation are those which appear in the tomb of Senenmut.) The figure of the Hippopotamus is in the centre. (One controversial view is that a mark on the breast of the Hippopotamus identifies the north ecliptic pole.) The figure of an Ape is under the Scorpion. Instead of the Great Bear there is the figure of a crocodile. Also, the small crouched lion next to (i.e., beneath) the Bull's Foreleg on the Denderah zodiac is part of Egypt's indigenous Northern group of constellations (near the celestial pole). Currently (circa 2002 onwards) there is a manufactured controversy over whether this particular figure is a lion or a ram. The depiction does not suggest a ram. Unfortunately there is a lack of textual information to clarify the identification. However, the star map depiction on the Heter coffin from Roman Egypt indicates the figure is indeed a crouching lion belonging to the northern group of early Egyptian constellations. (Many other figures representing constellations have not yet been identified with those in present use.)
Hydra and the Raven are in fairly correct positions under the Lion. The representation of Orion and Sirius is not quite identical with that in the "rectangular zodiac" in the Great Hypostyle Hall. (Below Leo is situated a cow in a boat with a star between its horns. This figure is Sirius.) The bow behind Sirius reminds us that "the Bow Star" was one of the Babylonian names of Sirius. Orion is the figure holding a staff and standing near Taurus. The jackal near the Hippopotamus is Ursa Minor.
The symbols of the planets are located in the constellations in which they were thought to be particularly (astrologically) influential. The disc between Pisces and Aries may be the full moon.

The zodiac (i.e., sky) is supported by four human-headed feminine figures standing erect (at the four corners (or four columns/four pillars of the sky) of the canopy of heaven), who are the goddesses of the cardinal points of the compass. Four goddesses representing the cardinal directions, oriented to true north rather than local north, support the zodiac with the help of for pairs of kneeling falcon-headed gods, between the four goddesses. (The other identifications given are: (1) four standing figures of the sky-goddess Nut; (2) eight figures of the kneeling earth-god Geb, between the four goddesses.) The four goddesses on the outside, all holding up their arms and holding the planisphere (and supporting the vault of heaven) are supposed to turn it around in their hands.
Summary tally of representations on Denderah circular zodiac: (1) Decans: 36 + 1 = 37. (2) Northern Egyptian constellations: 5. Other Egyptian/Greek constellations: 5. (3) Greek zodiacal constellations/signs: 12. Planets: 5. Total = 59 constellations/stars + 5 planets = 64 figures. (Éric Aubourg (1995) identifies 28 representations of Greek constellations within the Hathor temple.)
For the theme that the majority of the Denderah zodiac depictions are representations of Greek constellations see: (1) Aubourg, Éric. (1995). "La date de conception du zodiaque du temple d'Hathor à Dendera." (Le Bulletin de l’Institut français d’archéologie orientale (BIFAO), Tomé 95, Pages 1-10). (2) Cauville, Sylvie. (1997, 2nd edition with corrections 2015). Le Zodiaque d'Osiris. Le Zodiaque de Dendara au musée du Louvre. (See pages 32-38). For the theme that the Denderah zodiac is a comprehensive compilation of Egyptian and Greek constellations see: Christian Leitz. (2006). "Die Sternbilder auf dem rechteckigen und runden Tierkreis von Dendara." (Studien zur altägyptischen Kultur (SAK), Band 34, Pages 285-318). This creates some issues. We know from Hipparchus and Ptolemy that Greek star groups were subject to alterations/changes - up to and including Ptolemy the Greeks altered the boundaries of the constellation figures. It would be reasonably accurate to say that during the period from the 6th-century BCE to the 4thcentury BCE - and even much later - different Greek astronomers would change the constellation boundaries, if not the actual constellations. The constellation figures of the Greek sky, and most constellation boundaries, only became standardised after Aratus (i.e., with Ptolemy). It is known that some Greek constellation figures shared the same star (or even stars) within their respective boundaries. There are 3 illustrations for this: (1) Aratus included Serpens in Ophiuchus, and Lupus in Centaurus. Serpens was separated from Ophiuchus, and Lupus separated from Centaurus by Hipparchus/Ptolemy. Lupus is described by Eratosthenes as a "Wineskin." Aratus separated the Pleiades from Taurus whereas Hipparchus made the Pleiades an asterism of Taurus. Aratus' description of Perseus (specifically the left knee) is criticised by Hipparchus. (2) From Otto Neugebauer's, A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy: "Ptolemy states that he had repeatedly changed the boundaries of constellations and quotes some examples where he deviates from Hipparchus. ... When Ptolemy says that he had redefined the association of many single stars with respect to the traditional constellation configurations he adds the remark that his predecessors did not act differently." (Part 1, Pages 286-287). See Part 1, Page 336 for differences between Aratus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy regarding Cassiopeia and Perseus; and Part 2, Page 1027 regarding the drastic regrouping of stars in Virgo by Ptolemy to that of Hipparchus. (3) Gerd Grasshoff in his The History of Ptolemy's Star Catalogue states (Page 40): "The decrease in the number of constellations in the course of the [Greek] development of the constellations can be deduced by comparing the number of stars in Ptolemy's constellations with [those in] the Hipparchian register. The oldest constellations, the zodiacal signs [constellations] have a disproportionately larger number of external stars, indicating that the area of the constellations was reduced in the course of time." These examples of constellation changes all deal with subdividing or removing parts of one, or renaming a group of stars. They do not indicate the relocation of positions of constellations.
A much larger "rectangular (straight) zodiac" is still situated in the ceiling of the Hathor temple's Great Hypostyle Hall. (The term "hypostyle" denotes a hall with a roof borne on columns. Its use first appeared in Diodorus, 1st century BCE.) The capitals of the columns supporting the decorated ceiling of the Hypostyle Hall are carved in the shape of a naos sistrum. The naos sistrum is a musical instrument (a rattle) with its body shaped like Hathor's head, and its upper part shaped like a shrine (naos).
The constellations depicted on the 2 zodiacs at Dendera do not bear any relation to their actual size marked in the sky.

Traditional dating of the Denderah temple puts it squarely in the late Hellenistic period, in the first century BCE, notably on iconographic details and inscriptions. For example, the south outer wall of the temple have reliefs showing the famous Cleopatra and her son Caesarion (http://egyptphoto.ncf.ca/EgyptPerspective31.htm). The shrine was probably built by the Ptolemies, and probably finished by Cleopatra VII Philopator herself, who would have played on the Hathor worship as a goddess of fertility, of women, and of childbirth (another Hathor shrine was built by her in Philae). The temple we see today is the reconstruction during the Ptolemaic period of a much older temple which already existed in the 4th century BCE.
You should find good information about Egyptian temples in: Richard H. Wilkinson's book The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt. (London, 2000).
A study on the conception of the zodiac, based on astronomical computations, was published recently. I read about it first in a French astronomy magazine, Ciel et Espace, if I remember correctly. The original study, on which the article was based, is: "La date de conception du zodiaque du temple d' Hathor à Dendera." by Eric Aubourg, Bulletin de l' Institut Français d' Archéologie Orientale (BIFAO) 95, 1995, pages 1- 10. "This new study of the Zodiac of Dendera, currently exposed at the Louvre, is based on the principle of the conjunctions and oppositions of the planets and their periodicity. It develops the idea that the Zodiac does not reflect an instantaneous position of the planets (which can be identified according to the constellations) but that the ancient astronomers chose to represent the last stationary point of each planet preceding the elaboration of the Zodiac. It can thus be calculated that the Zodiac was composed in summer 51, in July or August. This precise dating is confirmed by the identification of an eclipse of the moon and an eclipse of the sun."

Jean Biot (1774-1862), an eminent French astronomer, presented papers to the Academy of Inscriptions in 1822 and 1844 (Memoire sur le zodiaque circulaire de Denderah), in which he stated that even though the round zodiac was sculpted in the Roman era it either referred to a much earlier time, or the background sky was copied from an earlier work which may have been rendered on parchment or stone. Jean Biot pinpointed the sky drawn on the ceiling of Denderah at precisely 700 BCE at midnight on summer solstice. Sir Norman Lockyer (1836-1920) concluded in his book The Dawn of Astronomy that subsequent translated context from hieroglyphics related the round zodiac to the period of 1,700 BCE. Of course, these first attempts at dating the celestial Denderah ceiling were not supported by later archaeological evidences or astronomical computations.

Sylvie Cauville, when at the Centre for Computer-aided Egyptological Research at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, astronomically investigated the Denderah planisphere. Using the 5 planets known to the Egyptians that are all depicted on the Zodiac of Dendera she worked with the astrophysicist Eric Aubourthe who used the planetary configuration depicted - deemed an event which occurs only once every 1000 years and dated the map to between 15 June and 15 August, 50 BC - just after the death of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy Auletes, in 51 BC. Two eclipses are also shown, which Aubourg identified as the solar eclipse of 7 March 51 BC and a lunar eclipse that occurred on 25 September 52 BC. Cauville's explanation for the reason for the Egyptians making the considerable effort to create the sky map was the solar eclipse must have occurred in Alexandria at around the same time that Ptolemy Auletes died. Cleopatra had the Zodiac created to "inscribe for eternity" the moment of his death (but also to mark her own rise to power).

In an 81-page booklet by Sylvie Cauville (Le zodiaque d'Osiris, Uitgeverij Peeters (Louvain, 1997), the author - who has published extensively on the temple which originally contained the planisphere - claims that the planetary positions on the planisphere can be matched to various dates around 50 BC. The author (and the astronomer who assisted her) appear to be unaware of the fact that the planets on the planisphere are located in their so-called exaltation points ("hypsomata"), i.e., the signs in which they are assumed to have special powers. This is a well known tradition in Late-Babylonian and Hellenistic astrology.

"The design is a representation of the sky. Egyptologist Sylvie Cauville and astrophysicist Eric Aubourg used the positions of the star constellations and planets to date the Zodiac to between 15 June and 15 August in the year 50 BC, during the period between the death of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy Auletes, in 51 BC, and the establishment of joint rule between Cleopatra and Caesarion (her 5-year-old son by Julius Caesar), in 42 BC. Two eclipses - the solar eclipse of 7 March 51 and the lunar eclipse of 25 September 52 - are represented on the skyscape in the locations where they would have occurred. But why would the Egyptians have wanted to commemorate this particular moment? I emailed Cauville and she says her hypothesis is that the total solar eclipse coincided in Alexandria with the death of Cleopatra's father. "She [Cleopatra] may have wanted to inscribe for eternity the passing of power from King-Rê to herself, the female sun." I'm so glad I asked! Rê is another name for the sun god, Ra, by the way. The pharaohs, including those of Cleopatra's dynasty, often claimed that they were sons and daughters of Ra. Dendera would have been chosen because the temple there was dedicated to female royalty. (The temple at Edfu, where two similar zodiacs are located, is dedicated to the male royalty.) The Dendera zodiac was on the ceiling of one of the temple's two chapels dedicated to Osiris, the god of eternal return. ... [Cauville's comments have been translated from French]"
Appendix 2: The Depiction of the Lion
The zodiacal lion constellation (Leo) is very late in Egypt. It appears on the Denderah circular zodiac as part of the 12 Greek-Babylonian zodiacal constellations forming an inner ring following a circle corresponding to the ecliptic. Included mongst the Egyptian constellations surrounding it is a reclining/crouching animal (identified as a lion) adjacent to/resting on the Bull's Thigh/Leg constellation (= the Big Dipper). This is identified with the same reclining/crouching lion that appears in depictions of the northern group of constellations in royal New Kingdom tombs and elsewhere. As example: In the New Kingdom tomb of Sethos I there is a depiction of a reclining lion above a crocodile among the northern group of constellations. A reclining lion is also depicted in the celestial diagram on the Senmut ceiling (New Kingdom period, ceiling dated circa 1473 BCE). Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker (Egyptian Astronomical Texts, Vol. III, Text, 1969, Page 200) tentatively identified it as a lion. Richard Parker ("Egyptian Astronomy, Astrology, and Calendrical Reckoning," Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Volume XV, Supplement I, 1978, Page 721) called it a lion. Marshall Clagett (Ancient Egyptian Science, Volume II, 1995, Pages 117, 125) identifies the lion in the celestial diagram on the ceiling of Senmut's tomb as "Divine Lion" and the lion on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I as "lion." Ed Krupp ("The Sphinx Blinks," Sky and Telescope, Volume 101, Number 3, March, 2001, Pages 86-88) summarises that this lion constellation is not to be mistaken for a depiction of the zodiacal Leo. The lion is not the zodiacal Leo but an unidentified northern constellation. Both it and the zodiacal Leo appear on the Denderah zodiac. Marshall Clagett notes (AES, Page 119) that the astronomer and classicist Alexander Pogo identified the northern lion constellation with the stars of modern-day Auriga (which lies north of the ecliptic). The design of the Denderah circular zodiac - which occurred during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods - enabled the syncretic merging of traditional Egyptian "astronomical" iconography for the stars, constellations, and planets with recent Greek "astrological" iconography for the Babylonian-Greek 12-sign zodiac. The animal adjacent to the Bull's Thigh constellation on the Denderah circular zodiac is identifiable as a crouching lion and reasonably likely to be a Ptolemaic representation of the lion constellation belonging to the northern constellation group. Hence we have the depiction of 2 different lion constellations on the Denderah circular zodiac - an indigenous Egyptian lion constellation is likely featured and also the Greek-Babylonian zodiacal constellation Leo is also featured. The indigenous Egyptian lion constellation is another lion altogether.
Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker note it is hazardous to claim certain interpretations of the figures and constellations on either of the Dendera zodiacs, noting (EAT III, Page 202) on how "little accuracy in details can be expected from artistic representations of this kind." There are several issues to be considered. The Denderah circular zodiac was created as late as the middle of the 1st-century BCE. At this period it is reason to assume that the astronomer-priests of the Denderah temple were losing their former detailed knowledge of Egyptian astronomy and thus inadvertently confusing/duplicating figures on both the existing Denderah temple zodiacs. If duplicating figures, then it would indicate that they were using more than one source of information - perhaps originating from different cult centres, which held views of astronomy that perhaps varied. With the Denderah circular zodiac the astronomer-priests putting together a unique syncretic circular zodiac and possibly using different sources for their chosen representations of the constellations. A number

of figures on the Denderah circular zodiac that present a challenge to explain, even to specialists such as Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker, who made careful comparisons with many other forms of the ancient Egyptian constellations.
The principal aim (rather than contention) of some amateur investigators involved with alternative Egyptology is to date the construction of the Sphinx to circa 10,500 BCE on the basis of supposed astronomical computations (aided by the flawed water erosion assumption). The associated aim is to associate the zodiacal Leo constellation with the Sphinx at this early date of circa 10,500 BCE. Achieving this latter claim involves 'stepping-stone' speculative arguments that require suspension of evidence.
The supposed controversy over the constellation Leo being represented on ancient Egyptian constellation depictions (i.e., in the celestial diagrams in the tombs of Senmut and Seti I) is manufactured by pseudohistorians such as Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval who have no formal training or qualifications/credentials in Egyptology. Their claims date back to the mid 1990's. (Claims for the association of the constellation Leo with the Sphinx predate Hancock and Bauval. Perhaps the earliest such claim is by the early 17th-century English traveller George Sandys (1577-1644) in his book A Relation of a Journey (1621) which relates his 1610-1612 expedition to the Middle East.) The interpretation promoted by Hancock and Bauval is that any early depiction of a lioness is connected with the Great Sphinx as Leo. The assumption that an ancient Egyptian Leo the lion matches the Leo the lion of the later Babylonian-Greek constellation system is a nil evidence assertion. No evidence exists that the ancient Egyptians knew the constellation Leo before the Hellenistic period beginning late 4th-century BCE. However, to fit with their Sphinx/Leo claims they want the ancient Egyptian depictions of a reclining/crouching animal (identified as a lion(ess)) to be Leo. More particularly, Hancock and Bauval want an Egyptian Leo tradition as old as the 11th-millennium BCE. (Their assumption is that any early Egyptian depiction of a lion(ess) is to be identified as Leo the Lion.) But the stars/constellations around the northern constellation lion are not like any constellations we see today - they are completely different. Hancock and Bauval also argue that the Sphinx represents the zodiacal Leo and maintain that both existed in Egypt as early as the 11th-millennium BCE. This argument relies in part on the peculiar (flawed) geological claims made by Robert Schoch about the Sphinx. There is no archaeological evidence establishing Egyptians (Egyptian culture) as early as circa 11thmillennium BCE. Archaeological evidence dates the Sphinx to the Old Kingdom period; to the reigns of Khufu and Khafre (circa mid 4th-millennium BCE). (See: The Secrets of the Sphinx by Zahi Hawass (1998).) Note: The 11th-millennium BCE is important to the speculation promoted by Hancock since this is the era he seeks to assign to the advanced progenitor civilization (i.e., Atlantis), now vanished, but which he claims through most of his works had existed and whose advanced technology influenced and shaped the development of the world's known civilizations of antiquity.
Mehit hieroglyph/goddess is not traceable earlier than Early Dynastic period.
A recent article introducing even more conjectures is: Seyfzadeh, M., Schoch, R. and Bauval, R. (2017). "A New Interpretation of a Rare Old Kingdom Dual Title: The King's Chief Librarian and Guardian of the Royal Archives of Mehit," Archaeological Discovery, Volume 5, Number 3, July, 2017, Pages 163-177. Archaeological Discovery is an open access journal. The journal editors claim to offer rigorous peer review. Of particular interest is the claim by Manouchehr (Manu) Seyfzadeh concerning the Egyptian lion goddess Mehit. Seyfzadeh claims the Egyptian depiction of a recumbent female lion/bent-rod (signifying "key" as in lock and key, with the lioness bearing the lock) hieroglyph is identified with the Egyptian lion goddess Mehit (and with the Sphinx prior to the Old Kingdom period). Also, it is identified as a configuration of early Egyptian constellations or perhaps a symplegma (the contention is the bent-rod is at least resting directly on top of the recumbent lion (Mehit)) with the (more or less) traditional stars of Leo the Lion identified as an Egyptian Leo and the stars above Leo identified as the bent-rod. Seyfzadeh is convinced he has discovered a bent-rod constellation in the stars above Leo - 2 bent-rods in fact, side by side. Seyfzadeh proceeds to argue that this is proof that the early dynastic Egyptians knew a Leo/Bent-Rod star configuration, which gave rise to the Mehit myth. The area above Leo has numerous faint stars. None are brighter than magnitude 5 and 6. It appears that Seyfzadeh has made the identification by working from a predawn photograph he has taken. However, as the 18th-century English cookery writer Hannah Glasse is reputed to have written (but never did; 'catch' was a misprint for 'case' = skin) in her recipe for jugged hare - "First catch your hare" (now established as a proverb). (First things first, make sure you have (or have established) a thing first before you think what to do with it. = Be cautious against undue reliance on an event or situation (or 'fact') that has not yet happened(/been established).) It is not established by Hancock and Bauval that the depiction of the



2022. 02. 21. 20:06 History of Constellation and Star Names
https://web.archive.org/web/20181013084022/http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-20.html 10/13
archaic recumbent female lion is Leo. It is not established by Seyfzadeh that an Early Dynastic Mehit hieroglyph is an archaic Leo the Lion. Seyfzadeh does not provide any convincing argument for Egyptian recognition of the stars of Leo the Lion as Leo. He simply builds in the assumption that any lion is Leo the Lion = the Sphinx is Leo the Lion. In the absence of credible evidence, and also due to the the existence of credible contrary evidence, the Sphinx/Leo/Bent-Rod/Leo claims lack any substantial proof and are simply highly unlikely.
If one or more of the illustrations of the bent-rod and lion that Seyfzadeh is using so far is superimposed on the stars comprising the figure of Leo it will be found they do not match - the bend in the bent-rod is reversed. What depiction of Mehit shows the bent-rod reversed? (Also, the bend is wider.) None has been offered by Seyfzadeh. Seyfzadeh states the bent-rod is clearly present in the star field above Leo. However, the stick figure he draws (connecting dot-to-dot stick figure lines) looks nothing like the illustrations he is using so far. Basically, the stars above Leo comprise the area near Leo Minor. The stars in this area (including Leo Minor were originally considered to be part of the constellation Leo. Leo Minor has only one star brighter than magnitude 4 (46-LMi (magnitude 3.8)). It has been remarked that exceptionally dark skies are needed to make out the triangle shape which marks the body of Leo Minor. It has also been remarked that ancient classical astronomers considered the general region to be undefined with no distinct patterns. Seyfzadeh is basically using 5th and 6th magnitude stars to form a stick figure of his bent-rod. (An easy star atlas to use is Norton's Star Atlas.) Not explained/established is whether the bent-rod identification above Leo was made by simply using a star field photograph rather than the more difficult task of actually observing that region of the night sky. (A star field photograph is far easier to use and can be captured with a short multi-second exposure.) There are additional issues which Seyfzadeh does not explain: The bent-rod appears on the astronomical ceiling of the Seti I tomb, directly under the standing bull and nowhere near the reclining lion is - which is not identifiable with Leo. Seyfzadeh has not explained - and has an obligation to do so - why the configuration of his bent-rod painted on the astronomical ceiling of Seti I differs from the illustrations he is using so far. Once again the evidence is the Seti I tomb depicts northern group constellations. (The bull is frequently described as standing on a platform.)
What these claims by Seyfzadeh lack is credibility. There is a lack of plausible supporting evidence. Nothing is proved. Experts on hieroglyphic texts would be the arbiters of the identification and meaning of the lion and bent-rod hieroglyph. There is no astronomical/archaeological evidence of anything. Imagination is indicated as playing a role. Claims by Seyfzadeh need to follow the basic principles of rules of evidence for historic research. Like Hancock and Bauval, Seyfzadeh lacks relevant specialist training and credentials in Egyptology and archaeology. Do doubt Seyfradeh is convinced that he has made an important discovery. My conclusion is that he has 'missed the boat.' How Seyfradeh constructs his claims is lacking in rigour. (He seems intent on establishing an archaic Leo constellation in accord with the ideas of Hancock and Bauval.) There is a proper way to establish new claims/facts. There is a need to avoid the bad habit of making up facts. If an historical argument can't be made from sound/credible evidence and there is a reliance on flawed methodologies such as personal lack of doubts about what ancient Egyptian skywatchers would have seen and personal opinion on what is important as evidence, and invoking the claim that critics have a negative bias, then we have not only a questionable historical argument but a bad one. There is no strong compulsion evident to provide a high standard of proof for claims. What appears to matter is the results obtained by rather arbitrary/subjective methods. How Seyfradeh positions the bent-rod into the back of Leo the Lion is a fundamentally arbitrary, highly selective exercise with very faint (magnitude 5 and 6) stars. (According to Seyfzadeh's stick figures the lower part of the bent-rod is indicated as not being in the area above Leo but within the boundary of Leo.) Seyfzadeh's bent-rod appears on the ceiling in the tomb of Seti I, just under the Bull, but it doesn't reach down to the lion and into its back. Also, no independent evidence is provided to support his conjecture that the bent-rod hieroglyph represents a physical key. It is likely that Seyfzadeh will continue to see the astral bent-rod configuration of stars above Leo as the 'clincher' that the ancient Egyptian lion depiction was Leo. In particular he will continue to argue that the constellation Leo with the star field above it inspired Mehit with bent-rod.
Likely the closest Mesopotamian lion goddess to Mehit is malassu (shedu), but is not a match.
Alternative archaeology/alternative history is being used to influence/distort modern ideas about the past and present. A typical example is the content of popular television programs on archaeology. Popular representations of archaeology in the media give large amounts of time to the uncritical presentation of alternative archaeology/alternative history claims as guides to the past. The suggestion is that traditional

professional archaeological/historical theory is 'terminally ill' or even 'dead.' Unfortunately pseudoarchaeology/pseudo-history remains unextinguishable.
Appendix 3: Copies of the Denderah Zodiac
A number of copies of the Denderah zodiac exist. In 1920 a bituminous plaster copy was made and placed in the ceiling opening of the chapel at Denderah, which had remained open to the sky from 1821 to 1920.
Another plaster copy of the zodiac is found at the Rosicrucian (Egyptian) Museum in San Jose, California (built in 1930). Its existence establishes a link between Rose-Croix Lodge and the Louvre, at least in 1925. The particular copy was bequeathed by Henri Verne, elected director of the National Museums and the Louvre at that time.
The British Museum exhibits marble copy (not the plaster cast ) made by Jean-Jacques Castex on the basis of the design by Édouard de Villiers du Terrage and Jean-Baptiste Jollois. (It would appear that this marble copy of the Denderah star map, carved by the French artist and sculptor Jean-Jacques Castex (1731-1821) in 1819 from casts (i.e., squeezes) of a one-third size wax model previously made (during the actual Napoleonic expedition to Egypt), was/is located in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Napoleon had originally contracted with Castex to produce a marble version of the wax model. However, the restoration government refused to honour Napoleon Bonaparte's contract. After (before?) Castex's death the marble carving came into the possession of a British speculator.) Superimposing the copy on the original highlights the numerous errors committed by Édouard de Villiers du Terrage and Jean-Baptiste Jollois. (Their somewhat inaccurate graphic copy dates from the Bonaparte expedition. It is the most internationally reproduced and diffused illustration of the Denderah zodiac.)
Another plaster copy of the Denderah zodiac has recently been exhibited at the Musée du Louvre-Lens.
The zodiac of Dendera was also reproduced as a black and white drawing on one of the ceilings of the mythological room of the Egyptian Museum, the Neues Museum in Berlin. It was also reproduced as a drawing on one of the ceilings of the Masonic Lodge of Saint-Nicolas (Liège) in Belgium. Unlike the Neues Museum, Kasteel Moeland has a coloured zodiac.
Appendix 4: Some Insightful Miscellaneous Comments by Ed. Krupp on Egyptian Temples and Astronomy
Ed. Krupp (Hastro-L, 13 December 2016): [snip] "Although astronomical imagery, inscriptions, and alignments are encountered in some Egyptian monuments and temples, it is all related to ritual. Almost all that we know about ancient Egyptian astronomy and calendrics is inferred from these sources. A few instruments are preserved. No information on actual observatories has survived. Only a few persons who may have been associated with calendrics and astronomy are known by name. Because these individuals have titles that identify them as priests and scribes and associate them with temples, it has been guessed that observations may have been performed from temple precincts, perhaps from the roofs. Anyone who has been on top of some of these temples knows they provide an elevated prospect, but the rooftops do not seem to have been designed with astronomy as a priority. The architecture primarily serves other purposes." [snip].
Ed. Krupp (Hastro-L, 15 December 2016): " [snip] ... [P]lease let me draw the thread on Ptolemaic temples and priests a little further, particularly from the perspective of architecture, iconography, and inscriptions. Dieter Arnold's Temples of the Last Pharaohs (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), a comprehensive and detailed historical study, is one of several sources that demonstrate the complexity of the character and development of Egyptian Ptolemaic temples. The Greek architecture imported into Egypt, particularly Alexandria, was Egyptianized. Syncretic cults (for example, Serapis) acquired the status of state religion, but traditional Egyptian religious belief was preserved and adopted by the Ptolemaic pharaohs. Many of the Ptolemaic temples, among them the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, the Temple of Horus at Edfu, the Temple of Khnum at Esna, the Temple of Haroeris and Sobek at Kom Ombo, and the Temple of Isis from Philae, contain elaborate and explicit astronomical imagery and texts. These images and texts are not encountered in earlier temples, but earlier temples also contain astronomical and calendrical material.
Although the fundamental design of the Ptolemaic temples generally adheres to the architectural principles of earlier New Kingdom temples, there are some differences. The Ptolemaic temples fulfill, however, the same primary function. The Egyptian temple often operates as the point of primordial Creation. It also



2022. 02. 21. 20:06 History of Constellation and Star Names

conceptually miniaturizes the cosmos, symbolizes and helps preserve cosmic order, and houses the divine. Throughout Egyptian history, a robust bureaucracy of priests administered the temples, which operated as pharaonic monuments initiated and financed by the rulers. The Ptolemaic pharaohs often followed standard Egyptian convention. They also portrayed themselves as divine and installed their images in the temple. Of course, the Ptolemaic temples are named for the Ptolemaic-era pharaohs and have nothing to do with Ptolemy the astronomer.
Egyptian temple ritual can be partially discerned from accounts of ancient Greek authors and from iconography and inscriptions. For example, the primary New Year festival is portrayed on the walls of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. The ceremony was performed, in part, in an open-air kiosk on the roof, where light from the rising sun was permitted to fall upon a statue of Isis in her guise as Sirius. Several texts inscribed on the temple walls refer to this activity. For example, in loose English translation (Genuine Egyptologists are far more nuanced and critical in their handling of such texts.), "Her [Sirius/Isis] rays unite with the rays of the luminous god on that beautiful day of the sun disk's birth on the morning of the New Year's feast." This is a report of the observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius, which signalled the New Year. Similar material is present at other Ptolemaic temples.
Many of the reliefs of the Temple of Horus at Edfu illustrate another Egyptian ceremony, the Feast of the Beautiful Meeting (between Horus and Hathor). Texts refer to the mythical foundation of the temple, and other reliefs deal with the battle between light and darkness/good and evil/order and chaos (Horus and Seth). From these examples, the fundamentally Egyptian character of these Ptolemaic temples is clear. They were operated according to an Egyptian agenda by Egyptian ritual specialists. That said, other Mediterranean influences are also present. Some of the astronomical imagery owes a debt to the prevailing Hellenistic, international astronomy. Most of it is distinctly Egyptian and rooted in tradition that goes back to the Old Kingdom.
... [T]he "side chapel" where the circular Dendera "Zodiac" relief, now in the Louvre, was originally located. This chapel is on the roof of the Temple of Hathor, in one of the two sanctuaries built there for the performance of Osirian mysteries—fundamentally the tale of the cycle of cosmic order. Each of these sanctuaries has two windowless rooms, one behind the other, and is fronted with an open court. They belong to the Late Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Both sanctuaries contain a great deal of mythic imagery and other celestial imagery. They provided no opportunity for observation or even convenient consultation of the planisphere that once occupied one of the ceilings. Also, the Dendera Circular Zodiac is not strictly a map of the sky. It is more like a symbolic representation of the sky. Assessments of the date for its design rely on a variety of assumptions, and any proposed date should be considered with caution. The identification of two eclipses on the relief is based on speculative visual interpretation of two elements in the relief. The date emerges from an analysis of the positions of the five naked-eye planets, the emblems for which are well established. Alternative explanations, however, have been offered for the configuration of the planets. The 50 B.C. date emerges from the assumption that the planets are all depicted for the same date. If, in fact, the planet emblems perform a different role and illustrate a different principle, their configuration does not have historical meaning.
... [A] few additional remarks about the Ramesside star clocks, which appear in certain New Kingdom pharaonic tombs. Although these have been enlisted in support of the notion that timekeeping Egyptian astronomers performed their observations from the roofs of temples, there is no evidence that clarifies how the timekeeping observations were actually made, what instruments were used to make the observations, and where the observations were made. These star clocks depict the positions of named stars on a grid that accompanies a seated figure facing frontally. The frontal facing is unusual in Egyptian art and suggests the figure was intended to illustrate something about the observational technique. It is generally accepted that the timekeeping stars were observed in or near meridian transit (on the north/south line) and that the stars' placement with respect to the figure has something to do with the location of the stars with respect to the meridian. It is likely the stars were observed with the merkhet (plumb line) and bay (forked stick), examples of which and descriptions of which have survived. A variety of interpretations of the meaning of the seated figure and his role in the timekeeping have been advanced, but none has been proved. Each interpretation also is compromised by details that contradict the analysis. The figure is dressed as a priest, and that leads to the reasonable conclusion that astronomical timekeepers were priests. The placement of these priests on a temple roof is neither supported nor contradicted by evidence. Alternative locations for the temple observatory have been suggested, however. One thorough account of this material may be found in the 1999

\University of Leicester Ph.D. thesis by Sarah Symons, "Ancient Egyptian Astronomy: Timekeeping and Cosmography in the New Kingdom." Symons explores the possibility stars were observed reflected in water along with the reflection of the observer. This approach has both potential and liabilities, but if taken seriously, it requires a respectable body of undisturbed water. It would be silly to imagine this on the temple roof. Symons instead suggests the ground-level "sacred lake" that so often accompanied the temple could have been used for this purpose. Clearly, the problem is unresolved. We don't know exactly how the Egyptians observed the stars, and we don't know where they observed them." [snip].

Karnak is the modern-day name for the ancient site of the Temple of Amun at Thebes, Egypt. The Karnak Temple Complex in Egypt is the second largest ancient religious site in the world, after Angkor Wat Temple in Cambodia, Karnak is believed to have been an ancient observatory - at least according to Norman Lockyer - as well as a place of worship where the god Amun would interact directly with the people of earth. Heliopolis - the city of the sun - was a major city of ancient Egypt. Several successive waves of pillage have robbed it of most of its monuments. It is thought that solar observations were conducted here. The existence of gnomons at Meroe (Sudan) suggests it was a location for astronomical observations - at least perhaps the observation of the summer solstice. A stone altar with triangular carvings discovered at Meroe (site 964) was thought by the British archaeologist John Garstang to be an astronomical observation stone.

Section of early 13th-century (Syro-Egyptian) astrolabe by Abd al-Karim al-Misri with pictorial representations of the 28 lunar mansions and 12 signs of the zodiac. Astrolabes were important for predicting star positions. In pre-Islamic times, the lunar mansions were introduced from Hindu astronomy and amalgamated with the Anwã' calendar system. Under the amalgamation, many names of prominent Anwã' stars were attached to the lunar mansions.
The Anwa' was the astronomical system that was used by the pre-Islamic Bedouin Arabs. The term anwā' is associated with the rains. The stellar nomenclature of the pre-Islamic Bedouin Arabs was far richer than that of the classical Greeks.
The pre-Islamic anwā' tradition of the Arabian Peninsula is concerned with a system of marking divisions of the year. The anwā' stars/constellations, a group of twenty-eight individual stars and small constellations along the ecliptic, constituted a calendar and meteorological system. Considerable, but fragmentary, data exists to enable reconstruction of some of the basic star calendars of the Arabian Peninsula. Before their contact with Greek-based astronomy through Arab-Islamic civilisation the pre-Islamic Arabs has their own folk astronomy. They knew the fixed stars and asterisms and used a number of fixed stars and asterisms, the so-called anwā', for a variety of purposes. After the introduction of Islam in the 7th-century CE a substantial amount of poetry, proverbs, legends, and folk science was written down in Arabic texts. Some attention was focused on the star lore of the pre-Islamic and early Islamic Bedouins and farmers of the Arabian Peninsula. Much Bedouin star-lore has been preserved in proverbs. Specifically, from the 9th-century onwards ArabicIslamic lexicographers and philologists collected old Arabic folk astronomy in books called Kutub al-anwā' (Books of the anwā') (Note: Most modern scholars simply write anwa'). From these books more than 300 old Arabic names for stars and asterisms (in old Arabic and early Arabic-Islamic poetry) have been recovered. Some of these star names are likely inherited from Babylonian astral lore.
Some present-day individuals still retain knowledge of traditional Arabic star lore. Yemeni farmers till use a calendar based on the conjunction of the new (crescent) moon and the Pleiades. (This particular calendar is also appears in the recorded pre-Islamic lore.) In the Gulf region the Canopus calendar, generally based on arbitrary 10-day units from the late summer heliacal rising of Canopus, has long been a traditional calendrical system for Bedouins and sailors.
Daniel Varisco ("Stars and Texts in Arabia." (Essays from Archaeoastronomy & Ethnoastronomy News, Number 16, June Solstice, 1995)) states: "Individual stars and asterisms were used for defining the directions of the winds, timing of rain [availability of water], planting crops, pastoral activities [extent of pasture], pearling, and fishing seasons, and the like. In addition, some savants cited the location of stars as indicators of the approximate location of Mecca ...." The seasonal rains also produced unexpected water pools and pasture for sheep, goats, and camels.
Before the advent of Islam, the Arabs possessed no scientific astronomy. However, they did have a rich star lore. The pre-Islamic groups of Bedouin Arabs (i.e., the nomadic desert dwelling tribes of the Arabian Peninsula) had their own (non-standardised) individual names for the various bright stars. Indeed a rich tradition of popular star lore and seasonal lore originated on the Arabian Peninsula long before the introduction of Islam. (Paul Kunitzsch believes that the main body (younger group) of pre-Islamic Arabic star/asterism names were probably formed in the period 500-700 CE.) Pastoral tribesmen and farmers noted the risings and settings of certain stars to mark the rain periods, important winds, and seasonal events in nature. Also, they commonly regarded single stars as representing animals or people. Generally, bright stars from 1st to 3rd magnitude have had proper names in the Arabic world. The year was defined by basic seasonal change over the course of 12 months. Telling time was seasonally adapted to local contexts. An early Islamic source for the anwa' traditions, the early Islamic scholar Ibn Qutayba, states that the Bedouin Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula divided up the year from what they knew locally about the time of weather changes (hot and cold weather) and pastoral changes (appearance and disappearance of plants and pasture).
The early Bedouin asterisms greatly affected later Islamicate star names and eventually "modern" Western star names. Early Islamic astronomy was a mixture of pre-Islamic Arab star lore, and Indian, and Persian, and later Greek astronomy.
The anwa' stars (i.e., stars which marked the beginning of periods of time called anwa') are a pre-Islamic system of season- and weather-prediction by using selected prominent stars or groupings of stars. (The most

important type of literature on pre-Islamic weather and astronomy is that of the anwa' dealing with potential times of rain linked with the risings and settings of certain stars.) As well as defining the seasons they act as "agricultural markers" for timing the agricultural activities. The term anwa' has the sense of rain hence the anwa' stars were associated with the rain periods. They also used them for orientation in nightly desert travels. However, the anwa' stars of the Arabs were primarily used as markers of rain. As there were variations in rainfall patterns in different parts of the Arabian Peninsula there were variously 4 to 8 periods identified. Generally, they began the year with the autumn rain followed by a sequence of rain periods.
The pre-Islamic anwa' tradition consisted of: (1) a knowledge of the risings and settings of the stars, (2) their association in particular with the settings of asterisms and simultaneous heliacal risings of other asterisms, (3) and their identification as markers of the beginning of the anwa' periods of time. (The singular term naw' (plural term anwa') is generally defined as the dawn setting of a star or asterism in the west at the same time as an opposite star or asterism rises with the sun in the east.)
The pre-Islamic anwa' tradition has ultimately influenced the naming of individual stars in Western constellations. Under the Abbasid caliphs al-Mansur (reigned 754–775) and al-Ma’mun (reigned 813–833), for the first time, scholars recorded Arab Bedouin traditions. Al-Sufi's book Kitab suwar al-kawakib, our best authority for post-Islamic Arabic star-names and constellations, also included the pre-Islamic folk tradition of Arabic star names. However, al-Sufi used anwa' texts from the Islamic period.
In the post-Islamic textual traditions two systems of the anwa' have survived. The most well-known system is that of the 28 anwa' equivalent to the lunar stations of Arab astronomy and astrology with the 28 anwa' representing stars or asterisms along the zodiacal belt (ecliptic) of the celestial sphere. The origin of the system of 27 or 28 "lunar mansions" (i.e., a lunar zodiac) was the topic of considerable debate among 19thcentury Orientalists. Scholars were generally divided between those who argued for a first appearance in India and those who argued for a first appearance in China. (A system of lunar mansions was established in China, India, and Sassanian Iran prior to the establishment of Islam.) A number of early Arab texts stated that a system of "lunar mansions" had formed a major calendar of the pre-Islamic Arabian Bedouin. However, there is little doubt that the Arabs borrowed the concept of the "lunar mansions" and later Islamic scholars attached seasonal almanac lore onto this imported calendar system. Julius Wellhausen (Reste Arabischen Heidentums (1897)) correctly concluded that the concept of 28 "lunar mansions" was borrowed from the astronomy of the Hindus and merged with elements of Arab star lore after the introduction of Islam. The peoples of the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula only recognised the seasons and rain periods of importance to them and had no concern with arbitrarily dividing the years into periods. Exactly when the pre-Islamic Arabs received the system of 28 "lunar mansions" (manāzil al-qamar) from India, and how this was achieved, is unknown. When it was done each "lunar mansion" was identified with one of the anwa' stars or asterisms.
It is usually stated that eventually the folk tradition of Arabic star names was preserved as the "lunar mansions." This would appear to be erroneous. The system of "lunar mansions" are a type of almanac for seasonal activities. Daniel Varisco ("Islamic Folk Astronomy." In: Selin, Helaine. (Editor). (2000). Astronomy Across Cultures. (Pages 615-650).) states: "The claim that the formal model of twenty-eight lunar mansions originated as a set sequence of asterisms from a pre-Islamic star calendar cannot be sustained." The Arab-Islamic concept of "lunar mansions" appears to have been borrowed from India. (Knowledge of the Indian lunar zodiac may have existed in the Arabian Peninsula in the late 4th- or early 5th-century prior to the birth of Muhammad. (The system of "lunar mansions" is mentioned in some old Arabian poems that are pre-Koranic; and are also mentioned twice in the Koran (dated 7th-century CE.) In the post-Muhammad period, during the Arab expansion, Arab scholars began to assimilate the sciences in Iran and India.) The "lunar mansions" are the constellations/asterisms which the moon moves through in its cycle around the earth and so the "lunar mansions" are a method for dividing up the celestial sphere. However, there would have been numerous locally relevant anwa' star lists throughout the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula. Knowledge of only a few stars is needed to set up a seasonal calendar. Also, the 28 stars/asterisms comprising the "lunar mansions" are not evenly spaced along the moon's path (but on average are about 13 degrees apart and related in an approximate way to the moon's nightly change of position on its eastward movement through the fixed stars). (Most of the "lunar mansions" consist of pairs of stars or small groups of closely spaced stars.)

Most modern scholars are now agreed that the Arab-Islamic lunar zodiac has an Indian origin which was merged with the indigenous system once it was borrowed. Daniel Varisco has shown that the anwa' were originally independent of the lunar lunar zodiac, and instead formed several indigenous Arabian parapegmata.
After the spread of Greek-based astronomy in the Arab-Islamic civilisation (i.e., from the 7th-century CE onwards) Arab-Islamic astronomers became familiar with the "lunar mansion" system and gave exact identifications of the stars/asterisms of the "lunar mansions" from among the stars listed in Ptolemy's starcatalogue in the Almagest. The "lunar mansions" were not actually used by the Arab-Islamic astronomers in their astronomical work. They were mostly used in astrology. The astrological texts that contained them were later to be translated into Latin and introduced into medieval western Europe.
Folk astronomy also flourished within Islamic society. This consisted of: (1) a knowledge of the sun's movement through the 12 zodiacal signs, (2) associated meteorological and agricultural phenomena, (3) use of the phases of the moon for time-reckoning, and (4) using shadows by days and the "lunar mansions" by night for simple time-reckoning.
The pre-Islamic Arabs did not expect rain at the risings and settings of all stars excepting those called naw'. The traditional anwa' texts record a length from 1 to 7 days for each naw'. Within the later "lunar mansions" scheme the length of each naw' is 13 days. These schematic lengths can hardly refer to the time for rain as several of the stations occur when there could be no rain. The sequence of rain periods attributed to the preIslamic Arabs varies from 4 to 8 periods of rain. It is no longer possible to reconstruct the anwa' names for the pre-Islamic seasonal sequence of rains in the Arabian Peninsula with precision.
Excursus: Kabbalistic lunar mansion system
At some time in late antiquity knowledge/use of the lunar zodiac system (lunar mansions) was introduced into Europe. An approximate date may be circa 7th-century. As early as the 7th-century the Syrian scholar Severus Sebokht was familiar with Indian astronomy. Severus Sebokht (Seboukt of Nisibis) (born 575 in Nisibis, Syria-died 667 CE) was one of the leading scholars of ecclesiastical, philosophical, and scientific culture of late antique Syria. He was one of the foremost scientific writers of his time. He was bishop of the great convent of Kenneshrin (the "Eagle's nest"). The Caliphs of Baghdad (750–1258 CE) employed Indian astronomer/astrologers. (Between the 8th- and 10th- centuries, Baghdad was a major center of study but local rulers across the region, in Cairo, Rayy, Isfahan, and other cities, also supported scientific research. During this period scholars translated studies in Sanskrit, Pahlavi, and Greek into Arabic. According to David Pingree, (scientific) astronomy developed in India in successive phases of Babylonian, Greek, and Arabic influences. In turn, Indian astronomy may have later influenced the development of (scientific) astronomy in the Islamic Caliphate; the Zijs as example. Numerous practical astronomical handbooks (known as Zijs/Zījes) existed in the Arab-Islamic world. The Zij is an important genre in medieval Arabic astronomy. A Zij was a common kind of practical astronomical work in the Arab-Islamic world. A Zij (Zīje) is a handbook of astronomical tables, including tables for working out positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, and auxiliary material and instructions for how to use the material. According to Paul Kunitzsch Zijs: "... usually consist of a theoretical introduction, and a collection of astronomical tables, for chronology, for the planets, sun and moon, etc. Mostly a star table is also included. The star tables in the zīj-works mostly are merely the result of computation or compilation, and not the result of independent star observations.") In 948 CE the Western Caliph founded an academy at Cordova at which Moors and Jews combined to build a body of knowledge which became disseminated through the academies founded at Toledo and Granada. The Indian lunar zodiac was passed to Europe by way of Arab-Islamic scholars. (Many Arab-Islamic astrologers adopted, as part of the electiones, the Indian system of 28 lunar mansions, which afforded an opportunity for more minute calculations. (See: La Corónica, Volume 31, 2002, Page 62.) Electiones = help for choosing the propitious moment for undertaking important events. For many Arab-Islamic astrologer the electiones were more connected with geomancy than astrology.) The Iberian towns of Salamanca and Toledo were meeting places for Arabic, Christian, and Jewish cultures.
I am unsure just how much of this was put to practical use in Europe rather than astrological/magical/ritual use. (The "lunar mansions" were not actually used by the Arab-Islamic astronomers in their astronomical work. They were mostly used in astrology.) The use of the lunar zodiac in Europe apparently disappeared (was discarded) during the Renaissance period (spanning from the 14th- to the 17th-century, regarded as the

cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history). One reason for the disappearance of the lunar zodiac in Europe was the Roman Catholic Church associated the moon with magic, but not zodiacal astrology. Zodiacal astrology was not viewed as being linked with magic. However, the system of 28 lunar mansions was not considered to accord with orthodox Roman Catholic theology, as it was believed it could serve for magical purposes.
A number of Jewish Kabbalistic texts contain brief mention of a lunar mansion system. Mention of the lunar mansions system appears in the Sefer Yetzirah (Sepher Yetzirah and other variants), a Kabbalistic text (= Jewish mysticism) principally concerned with cosmology and cosmogony. The details are not part of the Kabbalistic texts - which only have brief cryptic information - but rather originate with what may be stated in a later commentary added to the texts. It would seem the earlier the commentary the better in this regard. To date I cannot identify any detailed academic discussion (merely passing mentions) of a Kabbalistic lunar mansion system. I find this rather odd. Also, a single Kabbalah tradition of the 28 lunar mansions does not seem to exist. There were multiple versions.
Three books which purport to give details of the Kabbalistic lunar mansion system are: (1) Lunar Astrology by Alexander Volguine (4th edition, 1974). (First published in French in 1936.) I would rate it as a popular book. Alexander Volguine [Alexandre Volguine] (1903-1976) was an astrologer with his own particular ideas. The bibliography is very dated but the works by Delambre, Saussure, and Schlegel remain useful. I have reservations concerning the overall reliability of the author's historical statements/claims. Also, Volguine does not bother to exactly cite his sources for his reconstruction of Kabbalistic lunar mansions. The fact that he cannot reconstruct them all poses a problem regarding veracity. Volguine compares the ancient Arabic (28 Manazils), Vedic (27 Nakshatras) and Chinese (28 Hsiu/Xiu) systems of lunar mansions. He also discusses the 28 so called 'lunar houses.' These are unrelated to the lunar mansions and instead represent unequal divisions of the solar-lunar cycle. He also published the brief unuseful book: Astrology of the Mayas and Aztecs (1969).
(2) I do not have, nor have I seen, an academic review of the self-published The Picatrix translated and annotated by John Greer and Christopher Warnock (2011). One author being an astrologer and the other a magician, I would rate it as a popular book. A partial English-language translation is given in Picatrix: The Goal of the Wise by William Kiesel (2002). (3) I do not have, nor have I seen an academic review of, Liber Lunae: Book of the Moon & Sepher ha-Levanah edited by Don Karr (2011).
The origin and dating of the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation is still keenly debated by specialist scholars. The Varieties of Magical Experience: Indigenous, Medieval, and Modern Magic by Lynne Hume and Nevill Drury (2013) write (Page 94): "... it is thought that the Sefer Yetzirah, or Book of Creation, was composed [written or compiled] in Palestine between the third and sixth centuries CE." (Thought to be transmitted orally before being committed to writing. Some persons date it as early as the 2nd-century.) However, Steven Wasserstrom has made a strong case for it being probable that the final redaction occurred in the 9th-century within an Islamic milieu. Statement made as a discussant at the Association for Jewish Studies 33rd Annual Conference (Washington, DC: December 16, 2001) in the session titled: Sefer Yesirah: Mystical and Philosophical Intertexts. See also Wasserstrom's publications: "Sefer Yesira and Early Islam: A Reappraisal." (The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy, Volume 3, Number 1, 1993, Pages 1-30); and "Further Thoughts on the Origins of Sefer Yesirah." In: Aleph: Historical Studies in Science and Judaism, Number 2, edited by Gad Fruedenthal (2002); and Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam (1995, Particularly pages 126-133). Elliot Wolfson has stated that the Sefer Yetzirah should not be described as a single composition, but rather as a composite of distinct literary strands that have been woven together through a complicated redactional process whose stages are not clearly discernable. See the discussion (Chapter 19): "Jewish Mysticism: A Philosophical Overview." by Elliot Wolfson. In: History of Jewish Philosophy edited by Daniel Frank and Oliver Leaman (1997, Pages 389-437, Specifically the section "Sefer Yetzirah: Linguistic Mysticism and Cosmological Speculation." Pages 400-406).

Source: Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation by Aryeh Kaplan (Revised edition, 1997, Page 223 (see also Page 221). (Kaplan's translations have numerous critics.) The author has only a brief discussion of the lunar mansions system briefly mentioned in the Sefer Yetzirah. Discussions by other authors usually deal with the subject as lunar calendars/lunar time. The 28 "lunar mansions" relate to the approximate 28 days of the lunar month (or more exactly, the sidereal month).
In the writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra the Indian system of lunar mansions was encapsulated in quotations from the work of astrologers writing in Arabic after the emergence of Islam.
In the works of Abraham Ibn Ezra (active in the first half of the 12th-century) there is a discussion of the adoption of the lunar mansion system by medieval Jewish scholars. His comments/criticisms of earlier writers adopting the scheme of 28 lunar mansions is of interest. (See: Abraham Ibn Ezra Book of the World: A Parallel Hebrew English Critical Edition of the Two Versions of the Text. Abraham Ibn Era's Astrological Writings, Volume 2, edited, translated, and annotated by Shlomo Sela (2010).) Sefer ha-Mivḥarim (unsure which version, perhaps all) by Abraham Ibn Ezra apparently contains (Chapters 6-9) a list of lunar mansions. See also: Sefer ha-Mivḥarim edited by J. I. Fleischer (1939). Also, the (Sefira) Shekhina mentions 28 encampments of the moon; and the Tikunnei Zohar (which is available in English), Section 69, 101b-102a. An important and informative article is: Sela, Shlomo. (2016). "Al-Farghānī on the 48 Ptolemaic Constellations: Newly Discovered Text in Hebrew Translation." (Aleph: Historical Studies in Science and Judaism, Volume 16, Number 2, Pages 249-365). ("Abstract: The present study reports the discovery of a hitherto unknown account of the 48 Ptolemaic constellations, probably by al-Farghānī, or at least from the first phase of the Arabic Ptolemaic astronomical tradition. A Hebrew translation of this account is embedded in the chapter on the fixed stars in Jacob Anatoli's Hebrew translation (ca. 1230–1240) of al-Farghānī's Elements, which this paper studies closely. This chapter is a fundamental text for understanding the Jewish interest in the fixed stars from the twelfth century onward. The Arabic text underlying Anatoli's Hebrew translation was well known in the twelfth century, notably to Abraham Bar Ḥiyya and Abraham Ibn Ezra. Anatoli's Hebrew translation of this chapter had a strong impact on subsequent Hebrew astronomy, beginning in the second half of the thirteenth century.") Shlomo Sela is professor emeritus in the department of Jewish Though at Bar-Ilan University.

The lunar mansions appear as the 28 "camps" (literally, 28 "camps of the moon") of the Divine Presence, corresponding to the 28 days of the lunar month (= 28 phases of the zodiac). Ecclesiastes 3 (Old Testament) begins with, "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (3:1). The 28 "times" listed in Ecclesiastes (3: 2-8) is the approximate number of days in the lunar months. These 28 times correspond to the 28 camps of the divine presence which in turn can reference the names of God. There are 28 angelic rulers (28 lunar angels) governing the lunar mansions The signs of the zodiac are associated with the 12 Hebrew lunar months, rather than with the position of the Sun, as, for example, in Western astrology. The syncretic Mediterranean-West Asian world of the Hellenistic-Late Roman period is well recognised. It has been long recognised there are extensive foreign influences on Jewish magical beliefs of late antiquity (cross-cultural cooperation). It has also been recognised that the content of Jewish magic changed over time and also with different Jewish groups. (See: Ancient Jewish Magic: A History by Gideon Bohak (2008, Page 66).
A detailed discussion regarding the Lunar Mansions/Lunar Times appears in the (Hebrew-language) Commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah by Raivad (= attributed to Abraham ben David of Posquiêres (1562 and 1806 editions). The commentary is indicated as discussing the 28 "camps of the moon" (per a circular diagram with 28 divisions). Note Raivad also appears as Raavad/Rabad/Ravad. (Rabbi Abraham ben David was also popularly known by the abbreviation RABaD (after the initials of his title and name, Rabbi Abraham ben David). Also, the Ra'avad (Rabad/Ravad of Posquieres, Provence).) The Sefer Yetzirah was certainly extant by the 10th-century, when it began to exert a great influence on speculative and mystical thought from that period onwards. In his excellent study, Sefer Yesira (2004), A. Peter Hayman states on Page 6 that an original text is not recoverable. Unsurprisingly, copying of the text was considered an editorial operation that incorporated various other materials.
It is generally indicated that the Kabbalistic lunar mansion system was adapted from non-Jewish sources. The Arab-Islamic system is most usually identified. After the Islamic conquest of the Mediterranean basin, Jewish scholars integrated into the ruling society and adopted the Arabic language for their literary and scientific works. Jewish astronomy of the Christian period draws mainly from Arab-Islamic sources. Eastern Jews of the 10th and 11th centuries pursued astrology. From the 10th-century Jewish scholars began building on Arabic astrology, and also began using it to re-interpret Jewish history. However, Kelley/Milone, Exploring Ancient Skies (2nd edition, 2011, Page 496), state that in an exception to the pattern of Arab influence, medieval Jewish scholars adopted the Hindu/Indian system of lunar mansions. (This was adopted through Arab-Islamic writings on astrology.) This was then passed on to the Christian world (Christian Europe). As evidence see: Tractat de prenostication circa 15th-century Catalonia - a Hermetic corpus. Also see: The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma by Paolo Zambelli (1992). Albertus Magnus produced the Speculum astronomiae [The Mirror of Astronomy] sometime after 1260 CE to defend astrology as a Christian form of knowledge. However, the Rig Veda/Hindu system has 27 (only sometimes 28 stars/asterisms) (naksatra), associated with the path of the moon. But they begin their reckoning from the vernal equinox. Note: A 28th intercalary naksatra was later added by astronomers to the lunar zodiac to correct the error due to the sidereal month being nearly 8 hours longer than 27 days. In the 16th-century Giordano Bruno wrote (but did not publish), De magia mathematica; and the pseudo-Pietro d'Abano wrote, Elemente magica.
Note: There were 2 main traditions of astronomy in the Arab-Islamic world. The first (earlier) astronomical tradition came from India and the second (later) astronomical tradition came from Greece. In the 8th-century a delegation of Indian scholars brought Indian astronomy to Baghdad. Later, Greek astronomical texts passed to Baghdad. In both cases there were translations into Arabic. The later Greek tradition largely displaced the earlier Indian tradition. In 12th-century Spain astronomical texts were also translated from Arabic into Hebrew.
The "Lunar Mansions" featured prominently in Arab-Islamic Astrology. As example: The Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology by the medieval astrologer Abu'l-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad AlBiruni (life dates: 973-1048 CE). These types of texts are thought to have influenced the Jewish mystics who resided in Moslem lands in the Middle Ages. Also, there were practical influences. As example: The practical influences on Jewish mystics who lived in medieval Yemen, where the 28 "lunar mansions" played an important role as "seasonal markers" in Yemenite agriculture customs. "Whilst this aspect of Lunar astrology was derived from ancient oriental sources, it was given a unique treatment in Kabbalistic traditions, involving special verses from the Hebrew Bible, the seven "double letters" of the Hebrew alphabet aligned

with "seven Sefirot," "seven seals," as well as the "seven planets" of traditional astrology. These are in turn associated with a set of Divine Names, and finally the entire caboodle was worked into a harmonious whole with the twelve signs of the Zodiac, etc. Most importantly, the Kabbalistic approach to this topic pertains to the Shechinah, the "Female" aspect of Divinity, or the "Divine Presence" in manifestation, specifically to "Her" being associated with "time." In this regard, the Zohar (1:198a) informs us that (Et - "time") is "a supernal rung." It continues by asking "And who is this Et?" to which we are told that it is the letter (Heh), and then, by adding the letter Heh as a suffix to Et, further elucidates that "it is called (Atah)," a term meaning "Now." Daniel Matt explained that the reason for "time" being "a supernal rung" is that the Shechinah "is known as 'time' since She conducts the world according to a cosmic schedule, enabling phenomenon to unfold in its proper time," and further that "She is also symbolized by the letter (Heh), the final letter of the divine name (YHVH)." (Zohar Vol. 3, Pritzker Edition) Since the Shechinah is traditionally associated with both "Time" and the "Moon," we can understand why the twenty-eight "Lunar Mansions" are collectively considered to be, as it were, an expression of the "Divine Presence" in manifestation. Furthermore, these twenty-eight Lunar Ittot (times) are associated with the twenty-eight "qualities of time" listed in Ecclestiastes 3:1-8 reading: ...."

Swart (http://kabbalahselfcreation.blogspot.com.au/2010/10/kabbalistic-curiosities-moon-mansions.html).)
Without getting into Muslim Jews; by the 13th-century there was a system of magical lunar mansions in the Muslim world (i.e., Yemeni).
Appendix 1:
Some pre-Islamic Arabian constellations have the same Babylonian source as the Greek zodiacal signs, but were independently inherited from Mesopotamia well before the translation of Greek scientific texts into Arabic. By Islamic times, some of these borrowed constellations had been relocated to different parts of the sky. While the classical constellation Aquarius is in its (modern) place on the ecliptic, a pre-Islamic Arabian constellation Aquarius called 'the bucket' also appears in Islamic astronomy, just to the north in Pegasus. Other zodiac signs have remained in the same place as their Greek counterparts.
Some of the Arabian versions of zodiacal constellations were (or became) far larger than the Greek counterparts, also inherited from Mesopotamia. An example is the "huge Arabic lion," a precursor of Leo. The early Arab constellation of the lion was much larger than the Aratean Leo. It sprawls across 7 classical constellations. The hind legs are in Bootes (north of the ecliptic), Virgo and Corvus (south of the ecliptic), and the forelegs are in Gemini. The lion's nose and mouth are in Cancer, while its eyes, forehead, heart and hackles are in Leo.
In his book Kitāb al-tafhīm (= The Elements of Instruction in the Art of Astrology) the Islamic Persian astrologer and philosopher Al-Biruni (973-1048 CE) discusses some of the early Arabic constellations. He states that one of the most important was ‘Al-Asad,’ the Arabic Lion, an enormous lion constellation extending over one-quarter of the sky. He states (Section 163): "[T]heir Lion is fashioned out of some five [7?] constellations, only the eyes, forehead, neck and shoulders and the tail-tuft belong to Leo, while they make the foreleg out of the heads of Gemini, the other [leg] out of Canis minor, the nose out of Cancer and the hind legs of the two simaks [Arcturus and Spica]. In Section 164 Al-Biruni states: "With regard to the Mansions of the Moon, the Arabic lion extends from the 7th to the 14th mansions. The 7th is the foreleg; the 8th the nose; the 9th, the eyes, the 10th, the forehead, the 11th, the mane (even though it is located in the hindquarters of Leo), the 12th, the tip of the tail, the 13th, Al-Biruni says are dogs barking after the lion, the 14th, the hind legs of the lion."
All 12 constellations that later formed part of the zodiac were established in Mesopotamia by the late 2ndmillennium BCE, and appear in the Mul.Apin series (dating to circa 1300 BCE according to the astronomer Bradley Schaefer). Some of these may have been adapted in the Arabian peninsula before the 12constellation zodiac (of 30 degree divisions along the ecliptic) was developed in the 1st-millennium BCE. As traditional Arabian astronomy includes a large lion, it can be assumed that the transmission to Arab folk astronomy occurred sometime later than 1300 BCE. Pre-Islamic folk astronomy in the Arabian Peninsula borrowed 2nd-millennium BCE stellar groupings from Mesopotamia prior to the Mesopotamian reworking circa 5th-century BCE to create an evenly spaced 12-constellation zodiac. During the late 2nd-millennium

BCE the astronomical knowledge summarised in the Mul.Apin series had spread to the Middle East, Greece, Iran and India.
Roland Laffitte states the Arabic 'Super lion' is related to the pre-Islamic anwa' tradition and has likely been shaped by an oral heritage originating from Babylon through Aramaic traditions.
Paul Kunitzsch (Kunitzsch, Paul. (1986). "Remarks on Possible Relations Between Ancient Arabia and the Neighbouring Civilizations, as Found in Some Old Star Names." In: Pre-Islamic Arabia (Studies in the History of Arabia, Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Studies in the History of Arabia ... April, 1979, Volume II, Pages 201-205)) has explained that out of a list of just over 300 individual indigenous Arabic star names only about 15 names plus a number of constellation names belonging to the zodiac may have been borrowed from elsewhere (likely Babylonia). The system of 28 lunar mansions was borrowed from India. The zodiacal constellations came from Babylonia, before or being completed with Greek influence. The introduction of the 12 zodiacal constellations (but not the Babylonian 'system' of use) did not likely occur as a single transmission. The indigenous Arabs of pre-Islamic Arabia gave 6 of the zodiacal constellations new names and 4 of the adopted zodiacal constellations were relocated in the sky, and some were made larger. Paul Kunitzsch explains that when adopting the system of 28 lunar mansions, the indigenous Arabs transferred the names of their anwa' system of corresponding pairs of stars to the lunar mansions, according to their localization in the sky. The translations of scientific works of the Indians into Arabic reportedly occurred in the 2nd half of the 8th-century CE, under the, Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It can be assumed that the Arabs obtained their knowledge of the lunar mansions earlier than this time.
Appendix 2:
That the lunar zodiac or lunar mansions had originally been established in Babylon was a conjecture first made by Professor Albrecht Weber (History of Indian Literature (1852, Page 21). Weber was a German Indologist and historian.

"The first attempt to construct out of 33 or 36 Babylonian normal stars a lunar zodiac composed of 24 ecliptic stars was due to Fritz Hommel [a German Orientalist] of Munich, in the last decade of the 19thcentury. He compared the Babylonian stars with the Arabian manāzils, found agreement in respect of 16 stations and concluded the manāzils were based on the more ancient Babylonian scheme. (Hindu Astronomy by P. Sharma (2004, Page 20)." Though initially given a favourable reception (due to belief in common origin between all systems), a number of important objections were soon raised against the idea of Babylonian origin. The 3 key objections were: (1) agreement only really existed for about one-third of the total number i.e., approximately 12, (2) common conspicuous stars/asterisms near the ecliptic were naturally used for the same tasks, and (3) the Arabic, Iranian, Indian, and Chinese lunar zodiacs consisted of 27/28 stars/asterisms - not 24. (In the case of China there may have originally been 23 or 24 stars/asterisms marked out along the celestial equator.) See: Thibaut, George. (1894). "On the Hypothesis of the Babylonian Origin of the so-called Lunar Zodiac." (Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume LXIII, Part I, Numbers IIV, Number 4, Pages 144-163). The author refutes Hommel's support for the Babylonian origin of the socalled Lunar Zodiac of the Arabs, Iranians, Hindus, and Chinese. In 1989 B. Subbarayappa wrote: "I myself have always wanted to believe that the original circle of lunar mansions round the equator was Babylonian. The only difficulty is that it may be rather hard to find anything in Babylonian astronomy which could really have given rise to the hsiu and nakshatra systems."
Appendix 3:
The astronomer Bradley Schaefer has found the best estimate for the formation of the Arabic 'lunar mansion/lodge' system is 200 BCE with a statistical uncertainty of roughly ± 1000 years.

22: Early constellations in Iran
There was a long tradition of ziggurat building in the Iranian world. The ziggurat of Chogha Zanbil in Khuzestan Province, southwestern Iran (near Susa). (Ziggurats were pyramidal structures built in receding tiers with sun-baked brick cores and multi-coloured glazed-brick exteriors.) It was built on a plateau above the banks of the Dez River. (The great canal built to supply water from the river is still in use.) It is the largest monument in Iran (and the largest of all the ziggurats) and dates to circa 1250 BCE. It is surrounded by 3 huge concentric walls. The outer city wall was about 4 kilometres long and enclosed an area of approximately 100 hectares. The first (outer) wall has 7 gates. Between the inner and middle walls, several temples dedicated to different Elamite divinities were built. Thousands of baked mud bricks bearing inscriptions with Elamite cuneiform characters, all inscribed by hand, adorn the most important buildings. Chogha Zanbil is the best preserved of all the ancient ziggurats. At the time of its construction this part of present-day Iran was part of ancient empire of Elam. The country of Elam dominated large parts of the Western and South-Western Iran, from the late 4th-millennium till the mid 1st-millennium BCE. Within an

ethnological and cultural context the ancient Elamites were close to the Mesopotamian civilisations. However, it is not unusual to come across the claim that the written history of Iran began circa 3200 BCE with the Proto-Elamite civilization and was followed by the Elamite civilization. The ziggurat at Chogha Zanbil was part of an ancient Elamite complex built by the Elamite King Untaš-Napiriša (1275-1240 BCE) near the Elamite capital city of of Susa. The complex was apparently abandoned after his death. (All ziggurats were built by kings to demonstrate they could perform greater religious deeds than the priesthood.) The ziggurat is a square structure with its base measuring 105 metres x 105 metres. It had 5 levels and it's height is variously estimated but believed by some to have been 52 metres. The ziggurat was a temple dedicated to Inshushinak, the bull-god of near-by Susa. It has been speculated that it may also have served an astronomical purpose. This four-sided, broadly stepped ziggurat is aligned so that its corners face the cardinal directions. Ziggurats originally had a cosmic significance. They were an image of the 7 spheres of the world and were also the seat of the Sun-god. The building complex at the site of the ziggurat includes 11 temples, a palace, and burial chambers. It took some 10 seasons of archaeological excavations between 1951 and 1962 just to rediscover the extent of the complex. It is believed that 22 temples were originally planned, but King Untaš-Napiriša died before the construction of the complex could be finished, and his successors discontinued the building work. It is considered unlikely that many people actually resided there. When King Untaš-Napiriša died the site was not abandoned, but continued to be occupied until it was destroyed by the Assyrian king Ashurbannipal in 640 BCE. However, it appears only a few priests continued to live on the site until its destruction by the Assyrians. Some scholars speculate, based on the large number of projected temples and sanctuaries, that King Untaš-Napiriša was attempting to create a new religious centre (possibly intended to replace the city of Susa) which would unite the gods/goddesses of both highland and lowland Elam at one site.
According to David Pingree, (scientific) astronomy developed in Iran in successive phases of Babylonian, Greek, and Arabic influences.
Iran (Persia) is a West Asian country and one of the world's oldest continuous major civilisations. (The name Iran has been in use natively since the Sāsānian period.) Pre-Islamic Iran can be divided into 4 broad phases: (1) 3200 BCE to 728 BCE, Early history. (The written history of Iran began circa 3200 BCE with the ProtoIranian civilisation). (2) 728 BCE to 550 BCE, Median Empire (First Iranian Empire). (3) 648 BCE to 330 BCE, Achaemenian Empire (Second Iranian Empire). (4) 248 BCE to 224 BCE, Parthian Empire (Third Iranian Empire). (5) 224 BCE to 651 CE, Sassanian (Sasanian) Empire (Fourth Iranian Empire). Zoroastrianism, the religion founded by Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) in Persia played an important role in all four Iranian empires. During the Sassanian era Zoroastrianism was revived and became the State religion. (Many experts consider the oldest Zoroastrian texts to have been composed sometime between 1700 BCE and 1000 BCE, although it is conceded it is difficult to be certain regarding dating issues. However, attempts to date Zoroastrianism to the 2nd-millennium BCE are also considered by many scholars to be without foundation and they argue for a date toward the end of the seventh century BCE. There is still a strong argument that a date of circa 7th-century BCE is excluded on linguistic grounds - the language of the Avesta excluding such a late date. Mary Boyce believes the teachings of Zoroastrianism arose during a period of societal disturbance and conflict between warriors and tribesmen sometime in the late 2nd-millennium BCE.) In the Sassanian period the initial oral tradition of the Avesta was written down. The earliest surviving manuscripts date only to circa 1000 CE. It is thought that Pahlavi Zoroastrian literature preserves only a few remnants of what was a larger astronomical and astrological literature.
Prior to the Sasanian period there is no evidence of systematic indigenous contributions to skywatching. Because of the paucity of written sources - only a few written archives from ancient Iran have been found almost nothing is known about calendars and skywatching in ancient Iran. External written evidence from Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome, is not very assistive. The Avesta - a fragmentary collection of Zoroastrian writings collected and compiled in written form from rather fluid oral tradition during the Sassanid period (224 CE - 651 CE - does contain some information of celestial objects. (The legends of an Arsacid-era collation and recension of the Avesta are no longer taken seriously.) Because the Avesta was compiled over several hundred years it is almost impossible to put the astronomical data in it in either a chronological or territorial context. Most of the Avesta's texts were handed down independently of one another and its different parts date from different periods and different locations within ancient Iran. Sasanian kings were interested in astrology (especially Saturn/Jupiter conjunctions) and during the Sasanian period some Greek and Hindu astrological texts were translated into Persian. Basically, the reconstruction of the early history of ancient Iranian interest in the sky is reliant on much later medieval sources dating from the to the 9th-century

CE to the 11th-century CE. The most important of these late sources are the Bundahišn (an encyclopaedic collection of Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology), the Dēnkard (or Dēnkart) (a compendium of Mazdaen Zoroastrian beliefs and customs, including the calendar and astronomy), and the writings of al-Biruni (who wrote numerous books about Islamic, Persian, and Indian astronomy and astrology).
The Persian word for "star" is sitareh. There does not appear to have been any cult of the stars or astral speculation in ancient Iranian religion. The association of the Iranian god Zurvan with astral phenomena in Mithraism (and Gnosticism) most likely was derived from Mesopotamia.
Evidence for pre-Sassanian Zoroastrian astronomy/astrology is meagre, the brightest luminaries being the only ones singled out in the Avestan texts: Sun, Moon, and Sirius. In the Avestan pantheon the main astral divinities were the Sun, Moon, and Sirius (whose key role was that of liberator of the waters and who fought against the demons of draught). These were considered divine and associated with cosmic order. The other astral bodies were considered negative beings who were responsible for famine. The planets are not mentioned in the Avestan sources. Iranian religions did not have any type of professional astronomers or any form of developed astral divination. It is thought likely that some observation-based agricultural predictions existed in ancient Iran. It is thought likely that the agricultural predictions were connected with the helical rising of Sirius (Tistrya). (The Harvard Armenian scholar, James Russell, identifies the Armenian tiara star (the star depicted on the tiara of the Armenian king Tigranes II, ruled from circa 95 BCE to circa 55 BCE) as Sirius (See: Zoroastrianism in Armenia by James Russell (1987, Page 317).) In the Achaemenid period inscription (in the Old Persian language) of Antaxerxes (King of Persia from 465 BCE to 424 BCE) found at Hamadan (a city in the western part of Iran) the name of Ahura Mazda is mentioned and associated with other gods/goddesses mentioned: Mithra and Anahita. It is known that Mithra = the Sun, and Anahita = Venus. (See: Der Planet Venus im Awesta by Joannes Hertel (1936).)
Claims that pictures painted on early Iranian pottery dating back to circa 3000 BCE perhaps depict constellations remain vague. Also unsubstantiated is the claim that the inside walls of the cave where Zoroaster lived to contemplate for ten years were full of drawings of stars, the sun, the moon, and their movements. Regarding early Elam: Representations of the stars, moon, and sun appear on cylinder seals and clay tablets from the 3rd-millennium BCE. As example: A cylinder seal from Susa, dated circa 2500 BCE, depicts the figure of a goddess seated on a lion or lions, and next to her is the representation of crescent moon, sun-disk, and 8-pointed star. An earlier artifact, a vase from Jīruft (an ancient city in Iran), depicts the representation of the crescent moon, and an 8-pointed star surrounding a central dot. It is thought the star symbol represents simply the fixed stars (the heaven) as well as the planet Venus.
The seemingly rather repetitive hymn to Rašnu, Yašt 12, which is not divided into Kardes, has been recognized as containing materials of interest for Avestan cosmology and astronomy. The various allusions to cosmogony in Yašt 13.1–84,122 (This section provides, according to Kellens 1989, Page 39, "the only known elements of ancient Mazdean cosmogony.") and to the resurrection of the dead and the final defeat of evil in Yašt 19.88–96 are of interest for Younger Avestan cosmology and eschatology.
The few literary remains left to us are insufficient to establish details of early Iranian astronomy. (See: Poorbahram, Mitra. and Kargar, Mahdi. (2014). "The predicates of ancient Iran astronomy in the narratives of history." (International Journal of Management and Humanity Sciences." Volume 3, Number 2, Pages 1367-1369).) The Avesta remains a key source. "In the earlier portions of the Avesta there is no trace of mathematical astronomy (which in any case, would be inappropriate in such a context) and only a few hints at some sort of observational astronomy involving the sun, the moon, and certain fixed stars. See Yašts 6 (to the sun), 7 (to the moon), 8 (to Tištrya), and 10 (to Miθra). The earliest mathematical astronomy that developed in territory under Iranian control was that which originated in Mesopotamia, was improved during the Achaemenid period, and culminated in the Babylonian solar, lunar, and planetary theories of the Seleucid and Parthian periods. That some of this Babylonian astronomy and the astral omen literature that was associated with it was adopted by scholars in Iran itself is implied by its transmission to India in the late fifth or early fourth century B.C. and by the preservation of Babylonian methods of interpreting gnomonshadows. ("Astrology and Astronomy in Iran." by David Pingree (Encyclopaedia Iranica, Volume II, Fascicle 8, Pages 858-871))"
Early Iranian astronomical information is embedded in mythological and religious contexts. However, the old-Persian names of the planets are not known. Astral gods/goddesses figured prominently in ancient

Iranian religion and the most important seem to have been Tishtrya and Tiri (Tīr). In the Pahlavi Books Tishtrya is frequently confused with Tiri (Tīr). Tiri is sometimes the star Sirius, sometimes the planet Mercury. Tiri is not mentioned in the Avesta. The four leader stars (so-called (in popular literature) "Royal Stars") named as: Tishtrya, Vanant, Satavaesa, and the Haptoiringas, and are claimed to have been made by Ahura Mazda.
Ahura Mazda, the supreme god in ancient Iranian religion, especially in the religious system of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster (7th century–6th century BCE) shaped the sky and the heavenly bodies producing first the celestial sphere and the constellations, especially the zodiacal signs. The stars are a warlike army destined for battle against the evil spirits. (In Persian mythology, Akhtar is the zodiacal constellation that makes up the army of the good god, Ahura Mazda.) There are 6,480,000 small stars, and to the many which are not numbered places are assigned in the four quarters of the sky presided over by the 4 leader stars. Ahura Mazda then created the moon and afterward the sun.
Tishtrya was a prominent eastern Iranian astral god. It has been suggested that the Avestan Tishtrya is a syncretistic god composed of originally 2 distinct astral gods. Tiri was a popular western Iranian astral god. In Zoroastrianism, Tishtrya was identified with the western Iranian astral god, Tiri (Mercury in Sāsānian astronomy).
The Sasanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids. The Sasanids sought to re-establish Iranian traditions and to obliterate Greek cultural influence.
Relatively reliable Iranian history only begins with the founding of the Sassanian dynasty in 226 CE. However, not much is established regarding astronomy. Throughout the Sassanian period it is presumed the majority of the Iranian peoples practiced reverence to the sun, moon, Sirius, and some other stars in essentially the same way their ancestors had done. Attempts to identify the Sênmurw (a legendary dogheaded bird appearing in the Late Sassanian period of the 6th-century CE) with a constellation such as Aquila (the Eagle) or its most prominent star Altair (the Bird) remain speculative, if not completely fanciful.
There is plenty of evidence demonstrating Sassanian (Sasanian) interest in astronomy, astral iconography and astrology. Most historians agree that Sassanian astronomy (and astrology) was syncretic, based entirely on both Greek and Indian (Hindu) sources. Edward Kennedy (the late historian of Islamic science) wrote the available evidence suggests that Sassanian astronomy was under strong Hindu influence. With the establishment of the Sasanian dynasty Sasanian kingship took an increasingly astral, cosmic character. The Sasanian king of kings shared in the divine quality of the sun, moon, and stars. The Sasanian king was not one of the gods, but, like the sun and moon, he was a divine creation of Ohrmazd, essential for the proper functioning of the cosmos, and served an antidemonic role in creation. When Zoroastrianism became the state religion of Sasanian Persia, efficacious against the demonic forces was important. Cosmic elements, such as the sun, moon, and stars, predominate on late Sasanian crowns per numismatic iconography. In several issues of coinage by Kosrow II (the last great king of the Sasanian dynasty, reigning from 590 to 628 CE) three dotted rings corresponding to the three heavens in Zoroastrian cosmology encircle the image of the regnal fire.
From the Sassanian times the ecliptic was divided longitudinally into 27 lunar mansions of 13° 20' each; there were also modifications to the Indian system of 28 mansions. This mapping of the sky accentuated the identity of various constellations and asterisms, which now became viewed as companions of the zodiacal signs. (See: Bundahišn, Chapter 2.2.)
Pre-Sassanian Empire records for astronomy and astrology are rather meagre. Almost nothing is known of the astronomy and astrology of pre-Sassanian Iran. Further, reliable knowledge of Iranian astronomy and astrology is non-existent before the reign of King Shâpûr I (reigned 240-270 BCE). Neither constellations nor individual star names are mentioned in either the Gathas of Zoroaster or in Old Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenian (Achaemenid) Period.
The key sources for constellations and star names are the Avestan and Pahlavi texts. The Avestan texts are earlier than the Pahlavi texts. The Avesta was committed to writing perhaps circa 3rd-cenrury BCE. (The present text of the Avesta was compiled circa 3rd- to 7th-century CE from texts that survived destruction during the conquest of Persia by the Macedonian general Alexander the Great.) (Only about a quarter of the



2022. 02. 21. 20:10 History of Constellation and Star Names

original Avesta has been preserved. The rest of the Avestan texts are post-Zoroastrian and composed in the young Avestan language.) The Bundahishn was compiled circa 9th-century CE from earlier texts.
In the earliest material incorporated into the Avesta there are a few references that indicate the existence of some sort of observational astronomy. There are individual yashts dedicated to the sun, moon, Sirius, and Mithras. See yashts 6 to the sun, yashts 7 to the moon, yashts to Tišhtya ([Tištrya] = Sirius (α Canis Maioris)) and yashts 10 to Mithra. The oldest extant Old Iranian source that makes reference to constellations is the Younger Avesta. It contains the names of 2 constellations only - the modern-day constellation Ursa Major (Great Bear) and the modern-day asterism Pleiades. From the names 'the seven marks/having seven marks' for Ursa Major and 'first' for the Pleiades they are clearly indigenous Iranian constellations. (Antonio Panaino states that the only constellations clearly attested in the Avestan texts are Haptoiringa with 'Ursa Major,' Tištryaeini with 'Canis Minor,' and Paoiryaeini with the 'Pleiades.') The date of the first identification of Iranian constellation names is uncertain but it is thought that they can be placed in a prehistoric period of the eastern Iranian world. In the later Avestan literature, however, both constellations and star names are mentioned. These include the star Sirius, the constellation Ursa Major, the Pleiades (yashts 8:12), and the Milky Way. (There is an Avestan yashts addressed to the Milky Way (which is personified as feminine).) The Avesta mentions a stellar Raven 'Eorosch.' A (mortal) wonder-working bird is common to many mythologies. (See: "The Primeval Bird." by Phyllis Simpson (Fabula, Volume 15, Issues 1, 1974, Pages 95-102).) It is also stated that the ancient Iranian celestial goddess Ashi was associated with the stars of Cassiopeia. This is unlikely and probably speculation dating to early Iranian studies. The goddess
Ashi (female angel) was daughter of the high god Ahura Mazda and A ̄rmaiti. The nature of the Iranian
goddess Ashi is debated. According to Mary Boyce, Avestan 'ashi' means 'thing attained/ acquired; recompense, reward.' Avestan 'ashi' means 'thing attained/ acquired; recompense, reward'. The old concept of Ashi appears to have been simply that of an amoral goddess of Recompense/Fortune. Symbols of Ashi are fish and pomegranate.
Four leader stars (so-called royal stars) are succinctly mentioned in verse 13 headed Tishtar in both Siroza (Hymn) 1 and Siroza (Hymn) 2 forming part of the Khorda Avesta. (It is usual to divide Zend-Avesta into five groups of texts and the Sirozas - being short dedications for the "thirty days of the months" - and, forming part of the Khorda Avesta, would not appear to be amongst the oldest texts and are considered to be quite late.) These leader (royal) stars are Tishtya, Vanant (or Wanand), Satavaesa (or Sadwēs), and the Haptoiringas (or Haftoreng). Only 2 of the 4 can be reasonably identified (i.e., Tišhtya with the star Sirius, and Haftoreng with the stars of Ursa Major. However, many popular publications still proceed to identify Aldebaran, Antares, Formalhaut, and Regulus as the four leader (royal) stars of Persia. This error is obviously based on the 105 year old book Star Names by the amateur American star-lorist Richard Allen. (The identification Aldebaran, Antares, Formalhaut, and Regulus was first proposed by the 18th-century French astronomer and historian Jean Bailly. (See: Burrows Smith, E. (1954). "Jean-Silvain Bailly, Astronomer, Mystic, Revolutionary." (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Volume 44, Number 4, Pages 425-538).)
The various identifications made of the leader stars (so-called four royal stars) are: Tishtya has been variously identified as Aldebaran, Sirius, Arcturus, and the Summer Solstice. Vanant (or Wanand) has been variously identified as Regulus, Vega, Altair (earlier Corvus), Sirius, and Procyon. Satavaesa (or Sadwēs) has been variously identified as Antares, Aldebaran, the stars of Musca Australis (the actual constellation being invented circa 1595), and Crux. The Haptoiringas (or Haftoreng) have been variously identified as Formalhaut, and Ursa Major. (The Haptoiringas are described in the Sirozas as a group of seven stars.)

Speculations regarding the functions of the leader stars (so-called "Royal Stars" stars) as markers for the seasons or equinoxes/solstices can only hinge on the effective identification of the stars involved and the dating of such. (We are likely dealing with the 1st-millennium BCE at earliest.) Tishtrya was closely connected with rainfall and agriculture. Tishtrya is responsible for starting the process of rain making and for replenishing water.
The primary myth is Tishtrya/Sirius battling with its adversaries over the problem of drought and the release of rain. In the first part of the myth of cosmic combat/struggle Tishtya faces challenges before finally successfully combating the drought-god Apaosha/(?) (Apaoša, Apauša) (the demon-like adversary). The structure of the story likely offers a sufficient indeterminateness in the timing of the autumnal rains. The second part of the myth of cosmic combat/struggle connects the "shooting stars" (meteors) with the clash/combat between Tishtrya and Pairika (a female fairy-like adversarial demon). Pairika (Pairikā Dužyāiryā) is described in such a way as to be equated with "shooting stars." The clash/combat is between the army of fixed stars commanded by Tishtrya and the Pairikās (meteors = demonesses) led by a demoness called Pairikā Dužyāiryā "The Bad Year Witch." The Leonid meteor shower is perhaps the most suitable candidate for being associated with Sirius.
The association of the benevolent Indo-Iranian/Zoroastrian god Tišhtrya with the star Sirius occurred during the Achaemenid Period. (Tišhtrya is usually stated to be a rain god identified with the star Sirius (because of the star's prominence in the sky during the rainy season). Tišhtrya is perhaps more accurately identified as the angel (Yazad) who presided over the star Sirius and also directed the rain. Sirius rose helically when the rains came. In north-eastern Iran in the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE the star Sirius heliacally rose in July.) Vanand was the "home' of the drought-god Apaosha/(?) (Apaoša, Apauša), with whom the rain-god Tišhtrya/Sirius had violent contests. The principal myth associated with Tishtrya involves a battle with a demonic star named Apaosha (Apausha) over rainfall and water. Apaosha is a drought-bringing demon. Drought and the heat of summer were the great scourges in Iran. Apaosha was said to have captured the waters, which had to be released by the god of the star Sirius. Circa 2000 BCE Iran had low rainfall. (Apaosha has been identified with Sagittarius but the identification is not certain.) The star Fomalhaut is an ally of Tišhtrya. Within the scheme there was also a guardian-god of the pole-star (Mēx ī Gāh). Polaris, however, has little mythological significance. (However, it has been claimed that the god Mithras was connected with the pole-star.)
The Tishtrya Yasht and other Avesta texts indicate that the rising of Tishtrya was anxiously awaited by the Iranians and also by the creations of Nature (Yasht 8.36, 41, 42, and 48) at the end of Winter and the beginning of Spring. The phrase, "Mithra's forehead shines like that of the star Tishtrya." (Yasht 10.143) indicates the heliacal rising of Tishtrya and that in the Avesta times the sun rose in the constellation of Canis Major (Khareghat). (See: Journal of the K. R. Cama Oriental Institute, Issue 45, 1976, Pages 24-69.)
The Mesopotamian idea of associating stars with cardinal directions is reflected in Iranian texts such as the Pahlavi Bundahishn. It can be reasonably speculated that the Iranian (Persian) association of the four leader stars (so-called royal stars) and cardinal directions found in the Pahlavi Bundahishn likely comes from Mesopotamian astronomy. Western Iran frequently borrowed from Mesopotamia. (The Pahlavi Bundahishn is a Zoroastrian text dating from the early Sassanian Period. Considerable attention was given to astronomy during the Sassanian Period. The Bundahishn itself is actually a ninth-century (Medieval; believed

completed 1178 CE) compilation of earlier material. However, the Pahlavi texts also preserve large summaries and translations of lost Avestan texts. The astronomy of the Bundahishn is elementary and basically Indian in origin.) The Mul.Apin series associates a constellation with each of the cardinal directions. In the Mul.Apin Series Ursa Major ('wagon') is associated with the north, Piscis Austrinus ('fish') is associated with the west, Scorpius ('scorpion') is associated with the east, and Perseus ('old man') and Pleiades ('bristle') with the east. According to Walter Henning, in the Pahlavi Bundahishn Sirius (Tišhtrya) is the general of the east (= Tišhtrya represents the east), alpha Scorpii (Sadwēs) is the general of the south, alpha Lyrae (Wanand) is the general of the west, and Ursa Major (Haftoreng) is the general of the north (= the Great Bear represents the north). (In both Mesopotamia and Iran (Persia) the constellation Ursa Major is associated with the north.)
No Old Persian or Avestan source directly refers to the concept of the zodiac. (None of the gods/goddesses of the Avesta - which covered the period circa 7th-century BCE to 4th-century BCE had any zodiacal attributes.) The history of the Iranian calendars, as well as the pattern underlying the basic Mazdean scheme of the great cosmic (and mythological) period of 12,000 years, presuppose a certain crude acquaintance with the simple scheme of the 12 zodiacal constellations, which were originally linked with the 12 months of the year. By the Sassanian Period the concept of the zodiac had been borrowed from Greece. (The 12 signs of the zodiac correspond in concept to the Greek designations.) The 2nd (and 5th?) chapter of the Pahlavi Bundahishn (which dates to the Islamic Period) contains the names of the 12 signs of the Greek zodiac. (The Bundahishn is a Persian encyclopedia that was completed in 1178 CE.)
In the Mazdean religion the planets were regarded as evil.
The existing evidence indicates that a well-developed knowledge of mathematical and spherical astronomy was mastered in Iran only in the Sasanian period (224-651 CE). However, there was likely earlier astronomical activity in the Arsacid period (but mostly mastered in non-Iranian languages). During the Sasanian period the traditional astral lore (mostly of Avestan origin) and the local background culture were greatly enhanced, due to Greek, Egyptian, and also Indian astronomical and astrological doctrines. The zodiac is well attested in the Pahlavi texts and the names of the zodiacal constellations listed basically follow the Greek forms. The standard name of the zodiac in Pahlavi was dwazdahān (dw’cdh’n) "the twelve ones", but there is also the term 12-axtarān. According to the model of multiple spheres adopted in Sasanian Iran under the impact of Greek and Indian astral sciences, the inferior sphere was called the spihr ī gumēzišnīg "sphere of mixture"; it comprised the zodiacal belt with its 12 constellations (Pahlavi 12-axtarān). In addition to the 12 Zodiacal constellations Sasanian astrologers also used the originally Egyptian series of the decans; each Zodiacal constellation (= 30°) was divided into 3 decans, each of 10°, for a total number of 36.
The first two Sassanian kings (3rd-century CE) sponsored Pahlavi translations of both Greek and Sanskrit works on astronomy and astrology. The Pahlavi Bundahishn contains a list of the zodiacal constellations plus the Persian lunar mansions (See Chapter 2, Verses 1-8). The importance which the Sāsānians gave to the sciences of astronomy and astrology is evident from a number of names which exist for the practitioners of these sciences. The "astrologer" (Middle Persian) axtarmār; starōšmār, and "soothsayer" (Middle Persian) murw-nīš; kēd; kundāg, "zodiac-teller" (Middle Persian) 12-star-gōwišn, "star-reckoner" (Middle Persian) stārhangār, and "time-knower" (Middle Persian) hangām-šnās were valued and active during the Sāsānians period which welcomed and utilised new Greek, Indian, and Babylonian astronomy and astrological material. The result was the Sāsānians developed a syncretism of the Greek, Indian, and Babylonian astrological material.
In the Pahlavi Bundahishn, Kēwān (Saturn, holding the highest position in the planetary order) fights directly against the Pole Star (the highest star) Mēx ī Gāh (Gāh), and Ohrmazd (Jupiter) struggles with the Great Bear (Haftoreng). The Pahlavi Bundahishn (Bundahisn) records the tradition of a world year of 12000 years. According to the tradition the world would last for 12000 years, and it would be ruled by each of the 12 signs of the zodiac for 1 millennium. On the question of the influence of Mesopotamian and Greek ideas on the number of heavens in the cosmology of the Sāsānian period see: "Uranographia Iranica I: The Three Heavens in the Zoroastrian Tradition and the Mesopotamian Background." by Antonio Panaino, In: Au carrefour des religions, Mélanges offerts à Philippe Gignoux, edited by R. Gyselen (1995, Pages 205-226).
The Indian system of the nakṣatras (Pahlavi xwurdag) with 27 and 28 "asterisms" is well attested in the Iranian sources. (The Iranian lists with 27 or 28 asterisms are of Indian origin.) They are generally referred to

as "lunar stations" (but might also called manāzel, as in Arabic), each of them measuring 13° 20'. Their diffusion in Iran is placed in the Sasanian period, but it is likely that they were already known in Central Asia about the 2nd-century CE (through the mediation of Buddhist sources in Sanskrit and the derived Chinese translations, such as those by the Parthian prince An Shih-kao. Also in the Khotanese literature we can find references to the nakṣat(t)ra- (with a term clearly derived from Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit), sometimes with the direct mention of the individual asterism referred to. According to Walter Henning the Indian system of lunar mansions was introduced into Iran (Persia) circa 500 CE. When the system of the lunar mansions (naksatras) was introduced into Iran (Persia) from India a completely new set of names was created for them. We have lists of the Iranian lunar mansions from 4 different sources. The Pahlavi Bundahishn (Chapter 2) contains a detailed discussion of the naksatras. (The number of lunar mansions listed in the Pahlavi Bundahishn is 27.)
The Sassanian period Takht-e Taqdid associated with King Khusru II, circa 620 CE) was apparently the first antecedent of the modern domed planetarium. Takht-e Solaymân is the largest complex from the Sassanian era ever discovered. A cosmic throne-room is mentioned as historic fact in accounts of the capture of the Sassanian residential complex. When Byzantine soldiers under Heraclius (the Emperor of Byzantine) conquered the Sassanian complex of Takht-e Solaymân (= the old city of Shiz [Ganzak/Ganjak] in west Azarbaijan (alternatively Azerbijan) Province) in 624 CE they reported the existence of what we term today a planetarium. In a structure called Takht-e Taqdis (or Takht-i Taqdis) ("The Throne of the Dome") the soldiers found representations of the sun, moon, planets, and stars moving across the ceiling of a domed throne room. (Apparently there was a complex system of gears and another room contained horses to drive the system. If a number of early commentators on it are to be believed it was an impressive mechanical planetarium.) The soldiers also reported rain falling from holes in the simulated sky to the accompanying sounds of thunder. Because they believed the Persians and their Zoroastrian religion were pagan the throne room was destroyed by the invading soldiers. The existence of the planetarium is associated with the Sassanian King Khusru II, who was contemporary with Heraclius. The various sources recording the story actually vary regarding whether the cosmic room was in a palace or fire temple. However, the planetarium is mentioned as historic fact. (See: Studies on the Iconography of Cosmic Kingship by Hans L'Orange (1953, Reprinted 1982); Chapter 2: Khusrau's Cosmic Hall; Pages 18-27; Acta Iranica by Jacques DuchesneGuillemin (1978, Pages 255-257.)
An earlier precedent for the modern domed planetarium was apparently the Roman Emperor Nero's 'planetarium'/rotating dining room. However, whether it was a reality or a myth still seems undecided. A report on a 2016 Nero exhibition in Germany made the claim that the octogonal dining room (having 8 sides and 8 angles) - coenatio principalis - of his palace Domus Aurea (Latin for Golden House) in Rome had either one rotating dome or several nested ones in order to display celestial motions. Or - since there is no archaeological evidence for such mechanisms - that there was a fixed dome with moving lanterns instead. (The Domus Aurea was a 3-floor villa complex built in the few years between the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE and Nero's suicide in 68 CE. It was rediscovered early in the 20th-century.) According to Christopher Dewdney (2004), inside the the dome ceiling of the coenatis, the Roman radical/audacious architects Severus (Lucius Septimius Severus, architect/designer) and Celer (Petronius Celer, machinator or engineer) built a series of nested semispherical rotating domes (the mechanism being cranked by slaves) that simulated the movement of the planets across the night sky. Also, according to the Roman historian Suetonius (Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (70 CE - 130 CE)): "The main chamber was round and revolved continually day and night, as does the world." Engineers also incorporated a network of metal tubing into the mobile domes so that the effect of rain could be reproduced from the artificial sky. In 2009, archaeologists thought they could show the floor would have been able to rotate, if not the domes, ceilings or lanterns mentioned. If the dome or ceiling was fixed, but the floor rotated, the end result would have been somewhat similar. The only contemporary source seems to be one line in a text by Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus. Scholars have long debated whether this planetarium-like aspect of the room was a marvel of Roman engineering or simply a figment of Suetonius' often whimsical imagination. Because nothing in the room indicates the former presence of rotating apparatus - at least until very recently - some have suggested that there was a lantern with constellations illustrated on the underside, and that this lantern rotated on wheels or rollers. Nero's Rotating Dining Room (https://news.cnrs.fr/videos/neros-rotating-dining-room; 08.19.2016) ""The main dining table, which was round, rotated night and day, imitating the motions of the globe." The surprising construction mentioned by Suetonius in his biography of Nero [Nero 31.2] has been found. On Palatine Hill (Rome), a Franco-Italian team of archaeologists discovered remains of a mechanism that could have allowed the rotation of the floor of the main dining room [banqueting room] of the Domus Aurea - Nero's vast

imperial palace." An even better 'planetarium' is believed to have existed in Domitian's private palace, Domus Augustana, built in 80 CE high on the Palatine hill. It comprised a huge hall (measuring 87 feet high (26.5 metres) by 99 feet wide (30.2 metres)), called the Coenatio Jovis (Dining Hall of Jupiter) had glowing stars inserted into the overhead rotating domes. The simulated sky was described by the poet Publius Papinius Statius (circa 45 – circa 96 CE) - who had visited the dining hall - in his Silvae (a collection of Latin poetry). See the discussion on planetariums in: Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours by Christopher Dewdney (2004).
A Chinese predecessor, also a mechanical planetarium, that could have inspired the Sassanian period exemplar is the mingtang (also, Ming Tang/Ming-Tang/Ming-t'ang) or the "Luminous Hall" ("Bright Hall") of the Wei dynasty. This late example of a "Luminous Hall" is located in the Northern Wei dynasty capital, Pingcheng (present-day Datong).) The Sassanians had been in close contact with the Chinese for centuries via the Silk Route, as well as by sea routes in the south. "The Luminous Hall was round above and square below and on the four sides there were twelve doors and nine rooms, without common walls. Outside the rooms, within the columns and beneath the silk atrium awning, were installed mechanical wheels and pale blue-green silk decorated with blue semi-precious stones – looking up it resembled the sky. [On it] were painted the Polar Asterism and lunar lodges so that it resembled the canopy of Heaven. Each month as the [Northern] Dipper pointed to [successive] chronograms, it revolved to correspond to the way of Heaven; in this respect [the Luminous Hall] departed from the ancient [model]. On top [of the Luminous Hall] was added a Spirit Terrace (ling tai), and below water was led in to form a Circular Moat. Along the water’s edge stones were laid to form embankments, in this respect according with the ancient scheme. This is what was laid out and built during the Taizhong reign period. (Early Chinese astronomy and Cosmology by David Pankenier (2013, Page 375.)" Note: The mechanical aspect of this particular mingtang must have been a 5thcentury CE innovation as the geographer Li Daoyuan (flourished during the Northern Wei Dynasty, died 527 CE) notes in his book Shui jing zhu (an annotated and expanded version of an older text, the Shui Jing ("Waterways Classic"): "in this respect departing from the ancient model." The Taizhong reign period of the Tang dynasty/period was 626-649 CE. The "Luminous Hall" ("Bright Hall") was a sort of cosmological temple or architectural microcosm. A description of "The Luminous Hall" appears in Sancai tuhui, gongshi (a Chinese encyclopedia) compiled by Wang Qi and Wang Siyi and published in 1609. The origin of the mingtang dates back to the Zhou dynasty (1046/45/40-256 BCE). By the time of Emperor Wu (reigned 14087 BCE) of the Han dynasty, the mingtang was modelled on T'ai-i numerology for structural principles for a cosmological system. (The cult of T'ai-i dates to the mid-T'ang. The T'ang/Tang dynasty/period (608/618906/907 CE) is considered the high point of Chinese civilisation.) Only a few Chinese emperors (or empresses) actually built a mingtang. The mingtang is comprehensively discussed in the (unpublished but available through UMI) PhD dissertation, "Ming-Tang: Cosmology, Political Order and Monuments in Early China." by Hwang Ming-Chorng (1996, Harvard University, approximately 1800 pages). (See also: Wang, Tao. (2005). "Mingtang: The Hall of Luminosity." In: Maréchal, C. and Yau, S., (Editors). Proceeding of the International Symposium The Visual World of China. (Éditions Langages Croisés, École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (Paris), Pages 137-170); Henderson, John. (1984). The Development and Decline of Chinese Cosmology. (Pages 59-87); and Soothill, Wiliam. (1951). The Hall of Light: A Study of Early Chinese Kingship. (Pages 84-96).)
The origin of the planetarium (at least Western planetariums/planetaria) probably goes back to the Classical Period. Cicero, in the first century BCE, wrote of two "spheres" built by Archimedes that Marcellus (the Roman consul who conquered Syracuse in 212 BCE) looted from Syracuse and brought to Rome. One was a solid sphere on which were engraved or painted the stars and constellations. Marcellus placed this in the Temple of Virtue. (Such celestial globes predate Archimedes by several hundred years and Cicero credits the Thales and Eudoxus with first constructing them.) The second sphere, which Marcellus kept for himself, was a planetarium: a mechanical model which shows the motions of the sun, moon, and planets as viewed from the earth. Cicero writes that Archimedes must have been "endowed with greater genius that one would imagine it possible for a human being to possess" to be able to build such an unprecedented device.
The transmission of early Iranian astral beliefs is a difficult subject. In the 1930s Jehangir Coyagee (18751943) (a Bombay Parsi, a Cambridge University economist, and at his retirement Principal, Presidency College, Calcutta) published two books setting out evidence for the transmission of Iranian beliefs into India and China (and elsewhere). The first book was Cults and Legends of Ancient Iran and China (1936). The second book, a companion volume to his Cults and Legends, The Legend of the Grail: Its Iranian and Indian Analogous (1939) (the title is also given as, Iranian and Indian Analogues of the Legend of the Holy Grail).

It was comprised of lectures. In his book Cults and Legends Coyagee showed, for example, close similarities between several characters and episodes in the Persian epic, the Shāh-nāmak by Firdausī of Tūs and the Chinese epic or legend-cycle, the Feng Shen Yen I (Fen-shen Yen-I or Fengshen Yanyi). See: the (Englishlanguage) book review by the sinologist John Shryock in Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 57, 1937, Pages 198-204; and Science and Civilisation in China by Joseph Needham (Volume II, 1956, Page 165). The Shāh-nāmak consists of 2 parts: a historical record, and an epic part. The Feng Shen Yen I (usually translated as, The Investiture of the Gods) is a popular vernacular novel having 100 chapters. It combines historical romance and mythological tales. It was perhaps authored by either Xu Zhongling or Lu Xixing. The story is set in the era of the declining Shang dynasty and the rise of the Zhou dynasty. Coyagee believed the main centre for many of the common myths and legends was the province of Seistan (a border region in eastern Iran).
Appendix 1:
In early Iranian belief the stars in general are concerned with the mechanism for the circulation of the waters; others are plant patrons. The earliest Iranian system able to be reconstructed from extant texts involves stars of the 4 quarters and the centre. The most individualized stars are the quadrant commanders, already venerated in the Avesta. In the Pahlavi Bundahishn Ohrmazd appointed 4 generals, one for each of the four directions, and one general of generals over the 4 generals. In effect the 4 generals are quadrant commanders exercising jurisdiction over the various parts of the sky, all under the chief commander Haftoring (Ursa Major (Great Bear)) is the general commanding the north, Tištar (Tištrya) (Sirius) is the general commanding the east, Sadwēs (Satavesa) [Star/Asterism = ?] is the general commanding the south, Wanand (Vanand/Vanant) [Star/Asterism = ?] is the general commanding the west, and Mēx ī Gāh (Great One) (Polaris (the peg in the centre of the sky)) is the chief commander over all 4 generals (because of its nearly stationary position).
In the context of astral lore:
(1) Ursa Major guards the ominous northpoint, the direction of hell, with the aid of the guardian spirits. He prevents the entrance of any more demons to harass the zodiac. Each of his seven stars is attached by a cord to one of the seven earth-continents, and he is a patron of rivers.
(2) Sirius is the major patron of the atmospheric and earthly waters: he fought the second battle of the original creation. (In Homeric astral lore Sirius has the role of promoting fertility.) Sirius has an affinity with the "water-lord" Cancer (the rising sign of the world) and is termed "the horse of Cancer."
(3) Polaris is variously termed Peg of the Place (i.e., the pole), Peg of the Meridian (literally "of mid-sky"), and Peg of Culmination. While its nearly stationary position earns it the role of commander-in-chief of the stars, Polaris is otherwise of little mythological significance.
(4) Formalhaut, an assistant to Tištar (along with Ursa Major and Vega), protects the seas. On the problem of the identity of Sadwēs, Formalhaut is also rendered probably by the positional order in which the commanders are listed (according to right ascension).
(5) Vega watches the rampart of the Harburz mountains and repels demons; he may thus be invoked as a curer.
Appendix 2:
A sophisticated astral scene is depicted on the inside of an Aramaic bronze bowl, once part of the Mohssen Foroughi collection in Teheran comprising Iranian artifacts from the 2nd-millennium BCE to the late 18thcentury CE, now in the Shlomo Moussaieff collection in London). The bronze bowl is unprovenanced but believed to have every likelihood of being genuine, because the complexity of the interior astral design would have taken a long time to prepare. The first published discussion of this inscribed astral bronze bowl (18 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm high), apparently from Luristan (western Iran) or ancient Syria, engraved with a complex astral scene (sun, moon, various stars, and constellations), was first discussed in print by the British archaeologist R. D. Barnett in 1966. The bowl is believed to be manufactured by an Aramaic craftsman during the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE. It is believed to be of Syrian or Phoenician craftmanship due to its similarity to Phoenician copper/bronze bowls of the 8th-7th centuries BCE. Also the

7 tiny Aramaic labels (text) can be dated paleographically and this adds to the evidence in favour of its authenticity. The 7 engraved inscriptions are typical of Aramaic culture for the 6th-7th centuries BCE. The cup reproduces a starry sky with some recognizable constellations and heavenly bodies. The interior of the bowl is completely filled with an astral scene composed of central motifs surrounded by 8 zones. Depicted are constellations, the sun, and the moon, but it is perhaps not intended as a sky map. (See: "La *Coppa Foroughi : un atlante celeste del 1. millennio a. C." by Maria Giulia, Amadasi Guzzo, and Vittorio Castellani. (Rivista italiana di archeoastronomia : Astronomia nell'antichità, astronomia storica, astronomia e cultura, 2006, Number 4, Pages 1-8). See the discussion in: The Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society of Columbia University, Volume 5, 1973. Also, Younger, Jr., K[?]. (2012). "Another look at an Aramaic Astral Bowl." (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 71, Number 2, October, Pages 209-230).)
This remarkable bronze bowl gives us a star map of the heavens (or similar construct), that is unique in our surviving material from antiquity. It is also remarkable in illustrating what appears to be a mostly nonMesopotamian, most probably Iranian, astronomical scheme. It reproduces a starry sky with some recognizable constellations and heavenly bodies (the sun, the moon, perhaps the visible planets). It is also claimed by some persons that comets are depicted. Placed amongst two large (rayed) stars and two constellations shaped as a pair of hunting boots is the starry figure of a hunter-god armed with spear (in his right hand) standing on an ibex. The figure seems to represent the constellation Orion (as a hero), the Babylonian Papsukkal, standing on SUHUR.MASU (he Sumerian goat-fish) or Caper [Caper-bush?]. To his right is (apparently) the Plough and the Pleiades (as ‘7 dots’). (Note, however, it has been commented that the dots appear to be linked by parallel vertical lines and may have had a different meaning altogether i.e., that of a stylized palmette.) To his left is a bull’s head, made of stars, presumably the constellation Taurus; below it is a kind of starry ankh sign, possibly Corona Borealis or Coma Berenices, while above it is a tailed monkey surrounded by twelve stars. The name and relevance of the monkey is unknown. This intriguing symbolism, associating the monkey with the hunter (though in an astronomical depiction), may possibly be relevant to a terracotta plaque of the Old Babylonian period. The two Bears (Ursa Major and Ursa Minor), are respectively positioned at 2 opposite sides of the center in the cup. Interestingly, there are 4 figures (constellations) placed at the tips of a cross, 2 of them appear to represent Taurus and Leo; the 3rd one seems to be Scorpio and the 4th one can no longer be identified (but is speculated as Aquarius) because of an additional engraving placed on it.
Monkeys have a long and quite respectable history in the ancient Near East. Monkeys were pets in Egypt and most likely also in Mesopotamia from early times. The idea of animals acting like humans is found in Mesopotamian art and perhaps came to Sumer, along with the monkey, from India. India was the classic home of the animal fable. A well-known terracotta plaque of the Old Babylonian period shows a quite remarkable scene in which a hunter shoot is shooting an arrow at a monkey in a tree. There is a kneeling man behind the hunter who seems to be restraining him. Also, in the scene a boar is approaching the tree. We may have here a depiction of a now lost animal fable. The 12th/13th-century CE Persian poet Nizami’s/Nezami’s story of Bahram Gur, the famous hero hunter of the onager (wild asses native to the deserts of Syria, Iran, Pakistan, India, Israel, and Tibet) which once thrived in Iran and Syria, was based on a real historical figure, Bahram V, a Sasanian king (reigned 420–438 CE.
Appendix 3:
It is very probable that the Avestan Tištar (Tištrya) (Sirius) corresponds to the Vedic Tisya (Tishya). The Vedic Tisya appears as a vaguely astralised archer. The connection lies not in the Rig Veda but in later Indian literature. Also, a Babylonian text dealing with the new year rituals states that the star KAK-SI-SÁ [KAK.SI.DI] (Sirius) measures the waters. This compares with the Iranian Tištrya raising the waters of Vourukaša. (The month of Sirius (Tīrī) was associated with the rainy season.)

Appendix 5:
Tištrya also battled and defeated the 'shooting stars,' which were identified as witches. The connection of the Tištrya myth with 'shooting stars' (with which he does battle i.e., is an opponent) is likely due to several meteor showers appearing several months prior to, appearing 'coincident' with, and occurring for several months after, the heliacal rising of Sirius. The 'shooting stars'/meteors are referred to as 'worm stars.' The Leonid meteor shower is perhaps the most suitable candidate for being associated with Sirius/Tishtrya.
Appendix 6:
Léopold de Saussure held that the Iranian and Chinese cosmologies had a parallel structure. In each the sky and the earth was divided into 5 regions - 1 central region and 4 peripheral regions. Cultural relations between Iran and China were particularly strong during the Middle Iranian Period (the 1250 year long period from around 300 BCE until 950 CE).

Antonio Panaino identifies Tištrya as an important Old Iranian astral divine being that is to be identified with Sirius (the brightest star in the sky). The 8th hymn (Tišar Yašt) of the Later Avestan corpus was dedicated to Tištrya.
In the Rig Veda the god Tisya is the celestial archer. Bernhard Forssman has proposed an etymological explanation showing it is most likely that the Vedic Tisya corresponds to the Avestan Tištrya, and that Sirius has a direct and clear relationship with the three stars of Orion's belt. In several mythological passages in Vedic literature the three stars comprising the asterism of Orion's belt were represented as an arrow shot by Tisya. In the Avestan Yast 8.6-7 and 37-38 Tištrya flies in the sky as the arrow shot by their Aryan hero archer.
The similarity occurring in in Babylonia, China and Egypt with the ancient constellation figures to the southeast of Sirius is quite remarkable.
The Chinese have a Bow and Arrow asterism Hou-Chi (reputedly dating to at least the 4th-century BCE) formed by the same stars (in Canis Major) as the Mespotamian Bow and Arrow constellations. The Bow and Arrow is aimed at the Jackal (T'ien-Lang) which is the star Sirius. The celestial Emperor (i.e., mythical ancient Emperors) shot an arrow at the sky jackal (Sirius).
In later Egypt, on the round zodiac of Denderah the Egyptian divine archeress, Satit (Satet) (one of two wives of Khnumu), situated just to the east of the Cow in the Barque (Sirius), aims/shoots her arrow at Sirius.
Mesopotamian uranography (late period) had constellations comprising of Bow and Arrow (mul BAN and mul KAK.SI.DI). (Also written as mul KAK.SI.DÁ.) Sirius is KAK.SI.DI the Arrow Star (specifically the (shining) tip of the arrow). The Bow is formed from the stars of Argo and Canis Major. Presumably one or

more stars between Sirius and mul BAN marked the shaft of the arrow. The MUL.APIN text states "the Bow Star is the Ishtar of Elam, daughter of Enlil." (The Mesopotamian mul KAK-SI-DI (Sirius) is always identified as an arrow.) The planet Mercury was also called "Arrow." This is likely because both Sirius and Mercury move across the sky at a rapid speed. Sirius was associated with Ninurta (god of the thunderstorms, the plough, and the south wind, and god of the city of Nippur), and Mercury with Nabû (god of wisdom and writing). The Mesopotamian Bow and Arrow constellations are identifiable as the original source for the Iranian, Indian, Chinese, and Egyptian Bow and Arrow schemes.
In cuneiform texts Venus as morning star is sometimes called the Bow Star (due to Ishtar of Agade being a war goddess). The issue was first discussed by Franz Kugler in his SSB II.

Source: The Babylonian Epic of Creation by Stephen Langdon (1923, Page 177).
According to Antonio Panaino Mesopotamian astral beliefs regarding mul KAK.SI.DI began influencing Iranian beliefs about Tištrya in the Achaemenid Period. Iranian beliefs about Tištrya became syncretistic and Tištrya also became a god related to (1) the calendar, (2) the astral interpretation of the feasts of the AdonisTammuz fertility cycle, and (3) astrological speculation.
Kenneth Brecher ("Sirius Enigmas." In: K. Brecher and M. Feirtag (Editors), Astronomy of the Ancients (1979), Page 97) succinctly describes the relationship between the arrow and the dog in Sirius and

surrounding stars: "The Babylonians identify it [Sirius] as part of a constellation which they describe as a bow and arrow; for them, Sirius was a star marking the tip of the arrow. The Chinese independently described a bow and arrow in the sky, but they used different stars for their construction. For them, Sirius was part of the image at which the arrow is shooting; and curiously, the image at which that arrow is aimed is a dog. In Western tradition, Sirius is part of the constellation Canis Major, the Big Dog. It is remarkable that the same images — dogs, bows and arrows — occur in the cosmographies of different cultures; after all, if you look at the sky, you see only points of light on a dark field." The transmission of Mesopotamian astral lore is sufficient explanation.
A drawing of "The Arrow" constellation is clearly preserved on K 8538 (a Neo-Assyrian 'planisphere' dated circa 650 BCE) on display in Room 55 in the British Museum.
Appendix 8:
The so-called "four royal stars" is a mistake that continues to be perpetuated due to its use in the outdated but still popular book, Star-Names by Richard Allen (1899, 1936, 1963). There were no four royal stars of Persia. See: "The So-Called Royal Stars of Persia." by George Davis Junior (Popular Astronomy, Volume LIII, Number 4, 1945, Pages 149-159). The original (mistaken) identification of Aldebaran, Antares, Regulus, and Formalhaut was made by Jean Sylvain Bailly in his book Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne (1775). The so-called "four royal stars" are four chieftains preparing their forces for battle against Ahriman and his forces of evil.
Appendix 9: Avestan Uranography
In Avestan uranography - because there are 3 types of celestial bodies recognised - the sky is divided into 3 levels. The lowest level, closest to the earth, is that of the stars, the 2nd level that of the moon, and the 3rd level that that of the sun. Above the level of the sun is the realm of "endless light," "best life," and the "House of Welcome." Identifications vary regarding the named stars. According to one source there are 3 individual named stars, namely Vanant, Tiśtrya, and Haptôiringa.
Appendix 10: The Apadana
Two of the greatest monuments of the ancient world date from the 5th-century BCE - the Parthenon (Greece) and Persepolis (Persia). There is reason to think that the sculptors employed at Persepolis were largely Greeks. The construction of Persepolis began during the reign of Darius I (552-486 BCE) about 518 BCE and continued under his son Xerxes I (486-465 BCE). The largest and most complex building in Persepolis was the Apadana palace, likely an Audience Hall. (Apadana = a palatial building.)
Informal claims for summer solstice sunrise alignment have been made for Persepolis. However, no exact alignment is apparent. In a posting to Hastro-L (22-January-2011), Ed. Krupp notes that the field study tour he led to Iran in 2000 "... the first gleam of the sun [on the summer solstice] over a modest hill to the northeast is at least a degree north of the line given by the balustrade of the north stairway of the Apadana. I selected that well-defined architectural line for the comparison. By the time the sun actually lined up with the northeast/southwest axis, it was at least a degree above the actual horizon. The sunrise would have occurred even a little more to the north 2500 years ago." There is also a claim that that shadows of columns on the Apadana (a hypostyle hall = having multiple rows of columns to hold up the roof - 36 columns in all) line up with other columns, perhaps on the equinox (but I think that solstice is intended). Ed. Krupp notes (Hastro-L, 22-January-2011) that "... such an arrangement is hard to understand architecturally." The discussion has some confusion with clear references for claims not being identified. However, see: Exploring Ancient Skies by David Kelley and Eugene Milone (2011, Page 575), "Plate 2. (Ch. 9)" captioned: "Persepolis, the capital of Darius I: The columns of the royal palace are aligned so that the shadows of each row of columns strikes the next row at the summer solstice. Photo by W. Dutz for D.H. Kelley." This simply repeats the statement on page 299. Kelley/Milone give no reference - either on the page or in the References and Bibliography - but the source must be J. George, 1979. There is a solstice (an equinox?) 'shadow discussion' in "Achaemenid Orientations." by J. George. (Akten des VII. Internationalen Kongresses für Iranische Kunst und Archäologie, Archäologische Mitteilungen aus Iran Ergänzungsband 6, Munich 1976, Pages 196-206; Published 1979), that involves the Apadana columns. I have seen another reference to 'columns and shadow alignment' at Persepolis but didn't copy it. The long axis of the original Treasury of Persepolis was aligned in a west-east orientation.

23: Early constellations in India
The page illustration above is a modern publication of the Rig Veda. Indian astronomy had its beginnings in the Vedas. The earliest known Indian texts are the Vedas, the Brahmanas, and the Upanishads. Unfortunately their astronomical content, though rudimentary, is obscure. (Very little attention is given in the Rig Veda to the sun, moon, and stars. Out of the more than 1000 hymns of the Rig Veda not one is addressed to the moon and less than 100 are addressed to the sun. A lot of attention is given to the elements of fire, air, and water, and on the properties of the juice of the Soma plant.) Claims for a vast antiquity for Indian astronomy (i.e., dating back to circa 5000 BCE) have failed to withstand critical scrutiny.) European scholars who advocated a great antiquity for Hindu astronomy were Jean Bailly (1736-1793, French astronomer), William Jones

(British philologist, 1746-1794), and Samuel Davis (District Judge (British) in Bengal, 1760-1819). European scholars who advocated a more recent origin for Hindu astronomy were John Playfair (Scottish mathematician and natural philosopher (physicist), 1748-1819), John Bentley (British scholar, circa17501824?), and Pierre Laplace (French mathematician and astronomer, 1749-1827). The proper foundations for the history and antiquity of Hindu astronomy were laid by Henry Colebrooke (British lawyer and member of the East India Company, 1765-1837), Albrecht Weber (German Sanskrit scholar, 1825-1901), William Whitney (American philologist, 1848-1914), George Thibaut (French Indologist/Sanskritist, 1848-1914), and also Edward Sachau (German Orientalist and historian, 1845-1930), and Hermann Oldenberg (German scholar of Indology, 1854-1920) who wrote critical comments on the text of the Rig Veda. The more recent work of David Pingree (American Sanskritist, 1933-2005) has clarified may issues and supports a recent origin for Indian astronomy.
The Rigveda is all that exists (as documentation) for studying the ancient period of the Indo-Europeans. The Vedas are a collection of hymns and other religious texts composed in an ancient form of Sanskrit in what is now the Punjab region of India and Pakistan between about 1500 and 1000 BCE. The Vedas are dedicated to the various gods/goddesses of the Vedic tradition. The Vedas comprise the founding texts of Hindu scripture - an ancient work of Vedic ritual, prayer, philosophy, legend and faith. It includes elements such as liturgical material as well as mythological accounts, poems, prayers, and formulas considered to be sacred by the Vedic religion. It consists of a collection of 1,028 poems grouped into 10 "circles" (mandalas). It is generally agreed that the first and last books were created later than the middle books. The Rigveda was orally transmitted before it was written down circa 300 BCE. Philological and linguistic evidence indicate that the Rigveda was composed in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent, most likely between circa 1500 and 1200 BCE—though a wider approximation of circa 1700–1100 BCE has also been given. The Rigveda (also spelled Ṛgveda), (Sanskrit: "The Knowledge of Verses"), is the oldest of the sacred books of Hinduism. The form Rig veda/Rig Veda dates from 1776. It has been remarked that the oldest "family books" of the Rig Veda fall into two categories, one group emphasizing text terms relating to the sacrificial tradition (Indra, Agni, and Soma; Books 2, 3, 4, and 6) and the other group emphasizing the sun gods Mitra, Surya, and Vishnu (Books 5 and 7) suggesting the apposition of at least two major distinct tribal affiliations in the early Vedic community.
According to David Pingree, (scientific) astronomy developed in India in successive phases of Babylonian, Greek, and Arabic influences. In turn, Indian astronomy may have later influenced the development of (scientific) astronomy in the Islamic Caliphate; the Zijs as example. Numerous practical astronomical handbooks (known as Zijs/Zījes) existed in the Arab-Islamic world. The Zij is an important genre in medieval Arabic astronomy. A Zij was a common kind of practical astronomical work in the Arab-Islamic world. A Zij (Zīje) is a handbook of astronomical tables, including tables for working out positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, and auxiliary material and instructions for how to use the material. According to Paul Kunitzsch Zijs: "... usually consist of a theoretical introduction, and a collection of astronomical tables, for chronology, for the planets, sun and moon, etc. Mostly a star table is also included. The star tables in the zīj-works mostly are merely the result of computation or compilation, and not the result of independent star observations."
(1) Introduction: Periods of Indian Astronomy
In India the first references to astronomy are to be found in the Rig Veda.
The character of Indian astronomy only began to take shape in the 5th-century BCE with Mesopotamian influence that emphasised astrological omens. Some time in the 1st-century CE Greek astrological writings, part of which contained mathematical astronomy were translated into Sanskrit. Then Babylonian astronomy took hold in India after the Persian conquest of India in the 5th-century CE. The Indians were primarily interested in astronomy for religious and astrological purposes (i.e., preparing calendars and other time scales for religious observances).
No remains of observatories of the Hindu period (circa 200 BCE - 1100 CE) are known. In the early 18thcentury the Maharaja of Amber, Savāī Jayasimha II (1699-1743, a Kachwāha Rajput), built observatories at Benares, Mathura, Delhi, Ujjayini, and Jaipur in imitation of Ulugh Beg's early 15th-century observatory at Samarkand.
The following broad (i.e., somewhat loose) periods of Indian astronomy can be identified.

(a) Period of the astronomy of the Rig Vedas - circa 2000 BCE/1500 BCE - 1000 BCE.
(b) Period of the astronomy of the texts of the Brahamanas - circa 1000 BCE - 500 BCE.
(c) Period of the astronomy of the early Puranic writings and early Siddhantic writings (i.e., post-Vedic astronomy) - circa 500 BCE/400 BCE - 400 CE/500 CE.
(e) Period of Classical and Medieval astronomy - circa 400 CE/500 CE onwards.
However, as much of the content of Indian astronomy (and organisation of scheme of constellations) was imported from Mesopotamia it is perhaps easier to set out the discussion in the format below.
(2) Sumero-Akkadian Period
There is convincing evidence for extensive contact between Mesopotamia and the Harappan civilization toward the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. (The Harappan civilization flourished at Mohenjodaro in the Indus Valley from circa 2600 BCE to circa 1900 BCE.) Some persons have also speculated (on the basis of the inscriptions on Harappan seals) that the evidence also shows the existence of an astral religion in both locations. The argument made for such is generally considered unsatisfactory and unsubstantiated.
(3) Babylonian Period
There is evidence for contact between Mesopotamian and Indian cultures (or at least the diffusion of Mesopotamian astronomical knowledge to India) during the Assyrian Period.
Indian texts mentioning star calendars date from circa 1000 BCE.
The Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa (Vedanga Jyotisha), or Jyotiṣavedāṅga is one of earliest known Indian texts on astronomy and astrology (Jyotisha). The Vedanga Jyotisha attributed to the Sage Lagadha is the earliest treatise exclusively on Indian astronomy. The extant text is usually dated to the final centuries BCE, but it may be based on a tradition reaching back to about 700-600 BCE. (A more radical dating for its origin is between the 12th and 14th centuries BCE; with some persons placing the possible date of the composition of the text to a later period, perhaps circa 1000 BCE.)
The Rig Veda (basically an early collection of Hindu religious hymns) lists a number of stars. (There is no sophisticated astronomy within the Rig Veda. From internal evidence the date of the composition of the Rig Veda is indicated as being between 1500-1400 BCE.) The Rig Veda reference (i, 162:18) to 34 lights has been interpreted as referring to the sun, the moon, the 5 planets, and the 27 naksatras. (The Rig Veda gives no complete list of the naksatras.) The Rig Veda does mention 3 possible asterisms: Tisya [Tishya] (v, 54:13; x, 64:8, Aghas and Arjuni (x, 85:3). In some of the late hymns of the Rig Veda (dating approximately to the first half of the last millennium BCE i.e., 1000 BCE to 500 BCE) the astronomical knowledge is related to the content of the late 2nd-millennium Mesopotamian astronomical text known as Mul.Apin. This Mesopotamian text includes a catalogue of some 60 constellations in order of their heliacal risings, and 17 constellations in the path of the moon, beginning with Mul.Mul (the Pleiades). (Also like Mul.Apin it has an ideal year of 360 days of 12 x 30 day months. This ideal year also appears in a late hymn of the Rig Veda and also in the Atharva Veda.)
The Rig Veda has an incomplete list of 27 (or 28 stars/asterisms) (naksatra), also associated with the path of the moon, and also beginning with the Pleiades (called Krttikas). Not all naksatra lie exactly in the path of the moon. (The word naksatra seems to refer to any star (Nakṣatra (literally na-kṣatra, non-moving, fixed; nakta-tra, 'guardian of the night')). Usually the naksatras were asterisms (small star groups/patterns which were assigned specific names). Technically the naksatras are the lunar mansions. The naksatra each measure an arc of 13 20' of the ecliptic circle. ) These constellations were in use (in late Vedic times) at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE. (In later literature Indian astronomers inserted a 28th naksatra. However, see: Frawley, David. (1994). "Planets in the Vedic Literature." (India Journal of Science, Volume 29, Number 4, Pages 495-506) who supports the existence of a system of 27 Nakşatras with a 28th periodically inserted (intercalated) to keep order with the Moon traversing the Nakşatra system in 27.3 days.) (Other Vedic texts similar to the Rig Veda mention constellations. Two passages in the Yajur Veda list 27 constellations. A third passage in the Yajur Veda and a passage in the Atharva Veda mention 28 constellations.) Some 20 naksatra

have correspondences with the Mul.Apin list of asterisms in the path of the moon. The Indian lists of naksatras were established during the early first millennium BCE. They show striking resemblances to the Mesopotamian constellations; especially to List VI in the Mul.Apin series. Strictly, the calendars of the Vedic and Brahmanic Periods were luni-solar. The naksatras were used to mark the positions of the sun, moon, and planets.
Several naksatra make their appearance in the Rig Veda. From the time of the Rig Veda the system of naksatra is gradually built up. It becomes complete in the Atharva Veda and also in the Yajur Veda. This indicates that the system was established in India by circa 850 BCE.
Of the 27/28, naksatras 12 are used to give the names of the lunar months. In Hindu astronomy lunar months are measured from one new moon to the next. (Some groups, however, measure from the full moon.) Early allusions to a lunisolar calendar with intercalated months are found in the hymns in the Rig Veda, dating from the 2nd-millennium BCE. Other literature from circa 1300 BCE to 300 CE, provide more specific information. The oldest system, and essentially the basis of the classical one, is known from texts of about 1000 BC. It divides an approximate solar year of 360 days into 12 lunar months of 27 (according to the early Vedic text Taittiriya Samhita, 4.4.10.1-3) or 28 (according to the Atharvaveda, 19.7.1.) days. The Indian calendar is inherited from a system first mentioned in Vedanga Jyotisha of Lagadha (the first treatise on timereckoning), a late BCE (circa 100 BCE) addition to the Vedas, and standardised in the Surya Siddhanta (3rdcentury CE). It was subsequently reformed by astronomers such as Aryabhata (499 CE), Varahamihira (6thcentury CE), and Bhaskara (12th-century CE).
The positions of the naksatras in the sky are not defined at all in any of the very early texts. However, in late texts they lie roughly along the ecliptic. In the equivalent system in Arabia they also lie roughly along the ecliptic. (In the equivalent system in China they lie roughly along the equator.) The original number of the Hindu lunar mansions is not yet resolved The modern Indian lunar mansions system comprises 27 equal divisions (nearly all equal divisions) of the ecliptic. Whether the early lunar mansion system had 27 or 28 is not yet agreed upon. The number may have fluctuated. It is agreed that in the early system the sky was divided into 27/28 divisions, nearly all of them equal (overall each one of them measuring 13ŗ-20ŗ. In the Indian and Arabian systems of 'lunar houses' the stars/asterisms comprising such are, on average, about 13 degrees apart and related in an approximate way to the moon's nightly change of position on its eastward movement through the fixed stars.
David Pingree suggested (The Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia by Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1999, Page 63)) that the Mesopotamian association of gods/goddesses with constellations in the late 2ndmillennium BCE probably influenced the Vedic Indians to also associate one or a set of their gods/goddesses to each of their lunar mansions (naksatras). According to David Pingree it is also likely that the influence for the development of the Indian system of naksatras originated in Mesopotamia, specifically with star list VI in the Mul.Apin series (17/18 stars/asterisms in the path of the moon). The original use of the scheme of naksatras was simply to record the location of the moon among the stars. The scheme of naksatras was later extended to an astronomical system for recording the positions of planets (and the lunar nodes). Examples of this later use are to be found in the Mahabharata. (The Vedic convention of 27 or 28 lunar mansions has survived in modern Indian calendrical practice.
It seems likely that the Mesopotamian idea of associating stars with cardinal directions is reflected in Indian texts such as the Vedic Satapatha Brahmana. The Satapatha Brahmana states the Saptarsis (Ursa Major, "Wagon" (Babylonian: MAR.GID.DA)) rise in the North, and the Krttikas (= the Pleiades, "Stars" (Babylonian: MUL.MUL)) rise in the East. The science historian and Sankritist David Pingree believed that all of the astronomical information from the Mesopotamian Mul.Apin series reached India through Iran.
(4) Graeco-Babylonian Period
Ancient Persian (Iran) was one of the intermediate stages in the transfer of Babylonian astronomical ideas to India and China. The Babylonian scheme of 12 equal divisions of the ecliptic (and then ultimately the 12 zodiacal signs) most likely reached India through a Greek intermediary sometime in the late first millennium BCE or in the early first millennium CE. Elements of Mesopotamian astronomy were transmitted to India during the Achaemenid Period (circa 550 to 330 BCE); especially during the Achaemenid occupation of the Indus Valley in the 5th-century BCE. This was a significant stage in Mesopotamian astronomy reaching

India. The period of the astronomy of the early Puranic writings and early Siddhantic writings (i.e., postVedic astronomy) - circa 500 BCE/400 BCE - 400 CE/500 CE saw the transmission of both Greek and Persian ideas on cosmology. (It is not uncommon, however, to see exaggerated arguments for the influence of Indian astronomy on the West and the emphatic minimisation or denial of the influence of Babylonian astronomy on India.)
The transmission of various elements of Greek astronomy into India was complex. It extended over several centuries, beginning in the 2nd-century BCE and continuing until the late 4th- or early 5th-century CE. A significant stage was the Seleucid Period (with Babylonian astronomical methods modified by the Greeks). The influence of Greek astronomy on Indian astronomy may have taken place as soon as the Hellenistic period, through the agency of the Greek colonies of the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. Greek astronomy is known to have been practiced at the doorstep of India in the Greco-Bactrian city of AiKhanoum from the 3rd-century BCE (circa 256-circa 55 BCE). Numerous interactions with the Mauryan Empire (the largest and most powerful political and military empire of ancient India), and the later expansion of the Indo-Greeks into India suggest that some transmission may have happened during that period.
Indian astronomy underwent a general reform during the first few centuries CE, when advances in the content of Babylonian and Greek astronomy became widely known.
As summary: "Babylonian astronomy entered India from Persia in the late 5th century BCE, following the Achaemenid dynasty's conquest of northwestern India. Examples of Babylonian influence include the equalsign zodiac and arithmetrical rules for calculating the length of daylight. A greater wave of transmission occurred during the Seleucid period (roughly the last three centuries BCE). Babylonian arithmetrical methods were again transmitted, but this time often in modified forms showing Greek influence. The history of this transmission is complex. Greek geometrical theories from the time between Hipparchus and Ptolemy also made their way into India." (The Classical Tradition edited by Anthony Groften, Glenn Most, and Salvatore Settis. (2010, Page 91).)
(5) Christian Era
After the Vedic and Brahmanic Periods an enormous increase in astronomical literature occurred, particularly during the first few centuries of the Christian Era. (The Vedic Period includes the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE continuing up to the 6th-century CE.) Many Greeks settled in India or conducted trade there. Also, India had been wide open to Babylonian influences from the time of the expansion of the Persian Empire until the time of its re-conquest by Alexander the Great.
Various Graeco-Roman astrological treatises are also known to have been imported into India during the first few centuries of our era. The Yavanajataka ("Sayings of the Greeks") was translated from Greek into Sanskrit prose by Yavanesvara (probably a Greek living in India) during the 2nd century CE, under the patronage of king Rudradaman I, ruler of the (Western) Ksatrapas. (Yavanesvara literally means "Lord of the Greeks" and was a name given to many officials in western India during the period 130 AD - 390 AD. During this period these "Lord of the Greeks" officials acted for the Greek merchants living in the area.) Later in the 6th century CE, the Romaka Siddhanta ("Doctrine of the Romans"), and the Paulisa Siddhanta ("Doctrine of Paul"), works of Western origin, were considered as two of the five main astrological treatises, which were compiled by the Indian (or Iranic) astrologer Varahamihira (505-587 CE) in his Pańcasiddhantika ("Five Treatises") (dated circa 575 CE).
The period of Classical and Medieval astronomy - circa 400/500 CE onwards was heavily indebted to Greek astronomy. The Vedanga Jyotisha, with the ecliptic divided into 27 nakshatras, became obsolete when the Siddhanta calendar with the ecliptic divided into 12 rashis was developed and came into popular use circa 400 CE.
At the end of the 8th-century CE, with the flourishing Arab-Islamic civilization, an astronomical science was developed which absorbed and revised first the Indian, then the Greek astronomical tradition.
(6) Transmission from India
Some elements of Indian astronomy reached China with the expansion of Buddhism (25-220 CE). Later, during the period (618-907 CE) a number of Indian astronomers came to live in China. Later again, Islamic

astronomers collaborated closely with their Chinese counterparts particularly during the period 1271-1368.
Buddhist missionaries were instrumental in carrying astronomical material from India to Tibet, Central Asia, China, Southeast Asia, and Japan. (The commonly accepted date for the birth of Buddha is 560 BCE.) Early Buddhist astronomy was an extension of the earlier Hindu astronomy. The astronomy of early Buddhism in India is the same as that found in the Hindu Purānas (a group of important religious texts). Buddhist missionaries from India began their visits to China starting 65 CE. The Babylonian signs of the zodiac were adopted in India at some time during the first half of the 1st millennium CE. Circa 600 CE missionary Buddhist monks brought the 12-sign zodiacal system from India to China.
Michio Yano (Kyoto Sangyo University, Japan) sets out on Buddhist astronomy: There is no independent Sanskrit Buddhist text that is entirely devoted to astronomy. What is meant by the term 'Buddhist Astronomy' is the sum of the astronomical content which is sporadically found in early Buddhist texts. From a viewpoint of the history of science, the long history of Indian Buddhism is divided into three periods: (1) Early Buddhism; (2) Mahayana Buddhism; and (3) Tantric Buddhism. In the first period 'lunar astrology' was prevalent. The most important role was played by the lunar mansions (naksatras). The planets (grahas) play no significant role. The most important Sanskrit Buddhist text belonging to this period is the oeāduulakarnāvadāna. In this text knowledge of astronomy and astrology was conveyed by the king of the Mātanga tribe (a segregated group that is sometimes identified with the outcaste people called Candāla). It appears the knowledge of astronomy and astrology in this text was conveyed by ex-Brahmins who converted to Buddhism. This interpretation is supported by the King of the Mātanga tribe saying that he can remember the Vedas which he learned in his 'previous life' (puurvajanma). This statement can be interpreted as his 'life before conversion to Buddhism.' Likely there were many cases of converted Brahmins who shared their knowledge with Buddhist colleagues. The knowledge of astrology communicated in the oeāduulakarnāvadāna is very close to that of the Naksatrakalpa of the Atharvavedaparoeista.
Arab-Islamic scholars borrowed from the Hindu concept of the lunar zodiac. The Caliphs of Baghdad (7501258 CE) employed Indian astronomer/astrologers. In 8th-century Baghdad there were 2 main traditions of astronomy, Indian and Greek. The first tradition to reach Baghdad came from India. It was, however, largely displaced by the Greek tradition that arrived shortly afterwards.
(7) Astral Gods/Goddesses
In Indian mythology the worlds are supported by the gods Varuna and Mitra. The antiquity of Varuna and Mitra go back at least to circa 1400 BCE, where their names appear on an inscription of the gods of Mitanni in northern Mesopotamia. Varuna made the sun, established the morning and evening, the movement of the moon, the stars to shine at night, and regulates the months of the year. Varuna and Mitra are greatly concerned with the waters of the atmosphere and they make the rain fall.
Appendix 1: The Indian naksatras (constellations) had yogataras (junction stars). Each naksatra was named after the most prominent visible star (called yogatara or junction star) contained within its range. All were situated in the zodiac. According to B. Subbarayappa: " ... but one can say that only nine of the twenty-eight hsiu determinatives are identical with the corresponding yogatārās or 'junction stars' of the Indians, while a further eleven share the same constellation but not the same determinative star. Only eight of the determinative stars and yogatārās, however, are in quite different constellations, and of these two are Vega and Altair. On the Chinses side it is possible to say that the nakshatra do not show so clearly the coupling arrangements whereby hsiu of greater or lesser equatorial breadth stand opposite each other. Indian astronomy moreover, which was far more influenced by Greek astronomy than the Chinese was, does not show that keying of the hsiu and the circumpolar stars which is so important in China, in fact the essence of he Chinese system. Besides, the distribution of the nakshatra asterisms is much more scattered than that of those of the hsiu, following even less closely the position of the equator in the 3rd millennium B.C." David Pingree and Patrick Morrisey (1989) argue against the common origin or even association of the 28 Chinese xiu (hsiu) with the Indian nakşatras.
Appendix 2: Constellations other than the naksatras were also known. Stars and constellations identified by the Hindus (that are similar to our own Western constellations) include: Dhruva (the Pole Star), the Rksas (Seven Rishis (the "seven sages" but perhaps earlier called the "seven bears"); the 7 stars of the Greater Bear, Ursa Major), and Lesser Bear (Ursa Minor), Asvinau (the two divine Dogs, Canis Major and Canis

Minor/Castor and Pollux), the Boat (Argo Navis), Tisya/Mrgavyadha (Sirius (also later called Lubdhaka), but some identify the Praesepe), Canopus, the Krittikas (the Pleiades [in Taurus], the wives of the Seven Rishis (the "seven bears"), Orion, Rasabha (Twin Asses), and Rohini (Aldbaran, but possibly ? Tauri). The Three Kalakanjas may refer to ?, e, d Orionis. The pole star (Dhruva) is mentioned in Vedic and Puranic texts. In the Rig Veda Sirius is Tisya [Tishya]. It would appear that α (alpha) Carinae (Canopus (Agasthya)) in Argo Navis was the only star in the southern sky named during the Vedic period. The Aitareya Brahmana mentions Mrga (Orion), and Mrgavyadha (Sirius). The Satapatha Brahmana provides an overview of the broad broad aspects of Vedic astronomy. It has been argued on etymological grounds that mention of Asva, Rasabha, Aja, and Kurma refers to the Sun, Gemini, Capricorn (goat), and Cassiopeia respectively. Trisanku remains an unidentified constellation.
The constellation Ursa Major (comprising the 7 'dipper' stars) is generally known in India as the sapta-Rsis (= the 7 Rsis). The 7 Rsis (pronounces "Rishis") have an important place in Indian literature and thought. and the many traditions of the 7 Rsis derive primarily from Sanskrit tradition. The Rsis have been identified with the 7 ('dipper') stars of Ursa Major for circa 2000 years. A passage in the Satapatha Brāhmana (thought to be composed circa 8th-century BCE) states that in earlier times the Rsis in the sky were known as the rksas or (7) Bears. (In the Rig Veda and the Brāhmana they were also known as the 7 Oxen.) The Pleiades (called Krttikas) were the wives of the 7 Rsis (but in one Rig Veda hymn the Krttikas are male). Arundhati - the wife of the Rsi Vasistha - is identified with Alcor (the faint star close beside ζ Ursa Major. Vasistha - the husband of Arundhati - is identified with the star ζ Ursa Major.
In the Surya Siddhanta, a late astronomical work, only 7 stars besides the naksatras are mentioned. The 7 stars named are: Brahmahridaya (? Aurigue), Agni or Hutabhui (? Tauri), Prajapati or Brahma (d Aurigae), Mrigavyadha or Lubdhaka (Sirius), Agastya (Canopus), Apas (? Virginis), and Apamvasta (d Virginis).
Appendix 3: In the Bhagavata Purana (the god) Dhruva is identified as the Pole Star. It is somewhat usual to identify Dhruva (the Pole Star) with α (alpha) Draconis (Thuban, a pale yellow star) but it could have been perhaps the dim star Ketu (Kappa Draconis, or even α (alpha) Ursa Minor (Polaris). It is perhaps more likely that in the Bhagavata Purana the identification of Dhruva as the Pole Star meant α (alpha) Ursa Minor (Polaris). Dennis Hudson (at circa 2004), Emeritus Professor of Religion, Smith College (USA) is an expert on the Bhagavata Purana. From his research he has concluded that the Bhagavata Purana is a composite work which originated in different places at different periods. He dates its composition over a time span of 1600 years from circa 700 BCE to circa 900 CE. This dating does not give support for the recognition of Thuban as Pole Star. (It appears the Bhagavata Purana remained an oral tradition until written down circa 800 CE.) Also, Hudson's dating and the statement that no one had previously lived in Dhruva's place in the sky seems to support no knowledge of Thuban as a previous pole star.
Hermann Jacobi ("On the Antiquity of Vedic Culture." (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, Pages 721-726)) noted that the Gryha Sutras mention Dhruva as the Pole Star and also that the Maitrayana Brahamana Upanishad states that even the polestar moves (over a long period of time). Jacobi 's argument that these instances preserve memories from ancient times is not supported by mainstream scholarship. (Hermann Jacobi’s claim at the time it was proposed was opposed by William Whitney, A[?]. Keith, and others.) The chronology of Indian history and literature prior to the Middle Ages is notoriously uncertain and astro-archaeological methods arguing for very early dates are generally rejected by mainstream scholarship.
The 7 Rsis were associated with the centre of the sky i.e., the region of the north celestial pole. However, Dhruva (the Pole Star) came to assume this position when precession slightly shifted the location of Ursa Major.
If precession was common knowledge amongst 'intellectual elites' in the Neolithic period, due to diffusion from an original source in the Near East, then it is puzzling that in Hindu mythology the name Dhruva (immovable) is used to denote an astral god, identified with a star in the constellation of Ursa Minor which was the pole star in the last millennium BCE.
Appendix 4: The Vedas were composed approximately between 1500/1200 BCE and 500 BCE (in parts of present-day Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and northern India).

Appendix 5: The religion of the early Indo-European-speaking peoples who, from circa 1500 BCE, migrated into India was Vedism. The oldest surviving literature of Vedism is the Rig Veda. Hinduism is an umbrella term for a religious system based on the Vedic traditions. Hinduism formed out of diverse traditions rather than originating from a single founder. Sanskrit is the classical language of Hinduism.
Appendix 6: The astronomer Bradley Schaefer has found the best estimate for the formation of the Hindu 'lunar mansion' system is 1750 BCE with a statistical uncertainty of roughly ± 1000 years.
Appendix 7: The almost invariable oral transmission of the Rig Veda involved the development of complex error correcting techniques. Very particular methods were used to ensure this. Also, oral transmission was even used to check written accounts. (See: "Oral and Written Transmission of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit" by Michio Yano (Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 34, Numbers 1-2, 2006, Pages 143-160).)
Appendix 8: It is claimed by some people (including Asko Parpola) that at least the Pleiades asterism can be identified on the seals from the Indus Valley civilisation (Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Lothal; flourished circa 3750-1500 BCE). The representation on seals of 7 women tending a fire is interpreted (by some) as the Krittikas (Pleiades). Wendy O'Flaherty (Śiva, the Erotic Ascetic (1981)) contends that the 7 and 6 females on the Indus Valley seals are the constellation Krittika and that 7 goddesses were worshipped at Mohenjo-daro and 6 at Harappa. However, the script of the Indus Valley seals is not yet satisfactorily deciphered.

24: Early constellations in China
The Suchow (Soochow/Su-chou) planisphere (dated 1193 CE). The Suchow planisphere (Suzhou stele) of the Song dynasty is an all-sky star map.(Note the ball-and-link (point and line) convention to identify constellations/asterisms. It includes the celestial equator, ecliptic, and Milky Way. Note also the eccentric ecliptic and the curving course of the Milky Way.) The planisphere is centred on the circumpolar seen in the small central inner circle. These stars were associated with the emperor. The numerous unequally spaced radial grids shown correspond to the boundaries of the Chinese lunar lodges. (The circumpolar stars were keyed to the radial lines marking 28 unevenly divided sectors of the sky.) Both the planisphere and its explanatory text were prepared in 1193 CE by Huang Shang (geographer and imperial tutor) for the instruction of the heir to the Chinese throne, who ruled as Emperor Ning Tsung (1195-1224 CE). The planisphere was carved onto stone (to preserve it) approximately half a century later, in 1247 CE (Southern Song dynasty, Chunyou reign), by Wang Chih-Yuan. Most of the stars in the Chinese sky are carved quite precisely on the planisphere. Also included on the planisphere is the supernova of 1054 CE (in Taurus). For a long time the stele on which the planisphere was carved was located in the Wên Miao temple (Confucian temple of Literati), originally built in 1141 CE, in the historic garden city of Suzhou in the south of Jiangsu Province. The planisphere is now housed in a Suchow museum (the Stone Carving Museum). (The above star chart is an ink on paper rubbing (hanging scroll) of the stele made when it was located at the Confucian Temple. Only 10 rubbings have been authorised.) The chart depicts the sky visible from central China (approximately 35 degrees north latitude). The lengthy inscription (text) accompanying the chart states there are 283 asterisms and 1565 stars. These are the ancient canonical numbers (i.e., essentially the conventional figures). Will Rufus and Hsing-chih T'ien, in their extensive 1945 study of the chart (The Soochow astronomical chart), identified 313 asterisms and only 1440 stars. (A valid conclusion is all of the stars on the planisphere do not appear on the rubbing.) Though the stars are quite accurately located there is no systematic attempt to distinguish between stars of different brightness. The customary equatorial co-ordinate system is shown together with the ecliptic. (The ecliptic though is incorrectly represented as circular.) The Milky Way is also displayed on the chart. (The star chart and inscription below it (not shown above) measures 100 cm (38.5 inches) in width and 183 cm (71.75 inches) in length.) The illustration above is undoubtedly taken from The Soochow astronomical chart by Will Rufus and Hsing-chih T'ien (1945). The rubbing that appeared in their book was made by Doctor Robert Brown at the time he was the Director/Superintendent of University Hospital in Chengtu, Szechuan Province, China (his wife Mae Willis, who he married in 1907, was Head Nurse there) and presented to the American astronomer Will Rufus (a Methodist missionary to Korea during the early 1910s and Methodist Episcopal pastor). (Doctor Robert Brown and his wife (both Methodist medical missionaries) died during the course of the Chinese-Japanese War (some time post 1943) on their way back to Chengtu when their plane was shot down by Japanese fighter planes beside the Yangtze River. Doctor Robert Brown had been in China since circa 1918 (Director/Superintendent of the American Methodist Mission Hospital in Wuhu, on the Yangste River near Nanking, until 1938) with time away from China from circa 1940 to 1942 to study hospital administration at University of Michigan Medical School.)
History of Early Scholarly Studies of Chinese Constellations and Star Names
The earliest Western (European) authority on the history of Chinese astronomy was Antoine Gaubil SJ (1689-1759) who resided in China from 1723 to his death in 1759. He wrote extensively on Chinese

constellations and star catalogues. The correlation of Western star names with the names used in Chinese astronomy was done during the first quarter of the 18th-century by Mei Wen-ni [Mei Wen-ting] (1633-1721, who wrote on astronomy and mathematics) whose Chinese-language book - Investigation of the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western star names - was published in 1723. Half a century later, in 1782, Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes published a Chinese planisphere with a star catalogue. ChrétienLouis-Joseph de Guignes (1759–1845) was a French merchant-trader, ambassador and scholar. He was the son of French academician and sinologue, Joseph de Guignes. He learned Chinese from his father, and then traveled to China where he stayed for the next 17 years and returned to France in 1801. In 1819 John Reeves published Chinese Names of Stars and Constellations, Collected at the Request of Dr Morrison for his Chinese Dictionary. Reeve's list (made at the request of Robert Morrison) was the first listing of Chinese star names in the English language. It is widely referred by later works, most notably William's work on Chinese comets sightings, and Schlegel's work on Chinese uranography. According to Pierre Dessemontet (Hastro-L, May 4, 2011) most of the Chinese star names which have made it into our contemporary star name lists ultimately came from Reeve's list in Morrison's dictionary, as they very often take the form which is mentioned in Morrison's dictionary. (Morrison, Robert (1815-1822/1816-1823, Reprinted 1865) A Dictionary of the Chinese Language.) Reeve's material for compiling his list of stars and constellations were: the 31st volume of the Book of the "Leŭh; Lëїh, Yuen, Yuen," a somewhat lengthy compilation in one hundred volumes, published in the reign of Kang He/Kang Hi with Jesuit assistance; Bardin family (London) 18-inch celestial globes; Johann Bode's celestial atlas, Uranographia (1801); and 2 Planispheres constructed by the Flemish Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest (1623-1688) who was part of the Jesuit Society China mission.
Introduction/Overview of Chinese Astronomy
Both documentary and archaeological evidence confirm the early origin and continuous development of ancient Chinese astronomy was intended to meet both the ideological and practical needs of a society largely based on agriculture. Archaeological evidence for the observations of stars occur on pottery from the Neolithic period. This comprises painted star-group patterns. Also, oracle-bone inscriptions from the Yin period mention certain star names. Oracle-bones also record divination practices. There was a long period when the beginning of the year, month, and season was determined by direct observation of celestial phenomena, including their alignments with respect to the local skyline. However, as the need for more exact study arose, new instruments for more exact observation were invented and the system of calendrical astronomy became entirely mathematical. All astronomical measurements primarily served the purpose of calendar-making and astrology (based on the movements of the planets). Chinese astrology was strictly omen-astrology which only dealt with state affairs. The real development of the Chinese sky occurred during the Han period. China became a unified and centrally governed empire during the Qin and Han dynasties. The Chinese sky of the Han period is characterised by the large number of constellations. These had been developed during a long period of history. The Chinese constellations (and indeed the element comprising the Chinese celestial sky) was not constructed during one single period. Star charts have been discovered on the ceilings of tombs dating back to the Han period. However, most of them are illustrative rather than precise in their presentation of stars. By the 5th-century BCE, the Chinese had named the 28 asterisms that formed the basic reference points for the Chinese equatorial coordinate system. By the 1st-century BCE, the Chinese had developed a unique system of constellations that reflected Chinese cosmological ideas with the central theme of the correlation between Heaven and Man. The Greek sky was constellated with mythological beings and creatures. The Chinese sky was constellated with people, institutions and objects from the (natural) terrestrial world. The Chinese sky is a cultural phenomenon: A celestial representation of Chinese terrestrial society. It is not possible to understand the meaning of the Chinese sky without knowing its astronomical, astrological, philosophical, and mythological background. The Han period was the most important period for the formation/development of Chinese culture. The complete system of the Chinese sky was created during the Han period. It is indicated that the Chinese star-name system originated independently from outside influences from Babylonia, Iran, and India. It is indicated that the constellating of the sky in China had 2 stages of development. The first stage comprised the development of the hsiu (or xiu) system and several conspicuous constellations/asterisms. This was pre-Han period. The second stage comprised the idealistic assignment Chinese society in the celestial sky. This was completed during the Han period. The hsiu (or xiu) thus became the basis for later constellation/asterism construction. The later constellations were an extension/explanation of the hsiu (or xiu).

There is no literary evidence for the very early stages of Chinese astronomy. When China came under the rule of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), a massive (initial) burning of Confucian books (and persecution of Confucian scholars) took place in 213 BCE. (One copy of each Confucian book destroyed was kept in the Chinese State Library.) This was the outcome of continuous controversy between the first emperor of a unified Chinese empire (Qin Shi Huang) and Confucian scholars who opposed reforms and advocated a return to the old feudal order. Léopold de Saussure's works (many of which were published in the journal T'oung Pao), such as "Les Origines de l'Astronomie Chinoise." (T'oung Pao, Second Series, Volume. 10, Number 2, 1909, Pages. 121-182), can often be misleading as they rely on written records of a later period. Existing Chinese accounts of the earliest period of Chinese astronomy belong to a later period. Chinese astronomy has been primarily concerned with the calendar. For this the gnomon has been an important instrument. Careful observations of the planets seems to have begun circa the 4th-century BCE but planetary observations appear on the oracle bones.
Oracle bones are the most important source of primary information about Bronze Age China, including astronomy and celestial divination. Most of the oracle bones discovered come from the Shang Dynasty (circa 1600-1046 BCE) but some come from the early Zhou Dynasty (1046-226 BCE). The existence of the oracle bones only became known as late as 1899. They were first identified by the Chinese pharmacist Wang Yirong during the course of his work grinding bones for inclusion in traditional Chinese medicine. A collection of the diagrams of the marks was then published by the noted Chinese scholar and politician Wang Guowei in 1903. In 1928 a full scale archaeological excavation was initiated by Chinese archaeologists. In 1936 they found an undisturbed archive of 17,000 items including bones strung together in bundles. About 10 percent of all the bones are inscribed. In all over 100,000 inscribed bones have been unearthed. Oracle Bones (also known as "dragon's bones") were the shoulder blades of oxen or plastrons of turtles (the flat, underside of the turtle's shell) which were for divination. The animal bones or turtle shells were heated with a hot needle until cracks appeared in their surface. A diviner would carve (later, simply paint) symbols on the bones of the ox or the turtle shell, apply a hot poker or fire until the bone or shell cracked, and then interpret the direction of the cracks through their drawn symbols to predict the future. The shape of the cracks provided prognostications used by kings to assist in affairs of state. It was the ruler who provided the interpretation and this was usually then inscribed on the bone next to the question. (The cracks were recorded on the same bone as either auspicious or inauspicious.) The heat usually produced two cracks roughly at right angles: one long crack along the grain of the bone and a shorter one across it. The prognostication was recorded on the bone itself, together with the eventual outcome (tending to confirm that the prognostication was correct). The same bone could be re-used several times on different, un-cracked areas and so a bone may bear multiple inscriptions.
Some oracle bones relate to astronomical events, including both solar and lunar eclipses, and form the earliest Chinese records of such phenomena. Some of the earliest Chinese records of astronomical events are found on divinatory oracle bones that date to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Oracle bone inscriptions also mention asterisms. The study of oracle bone inscriptions has revealed early, astronomical study of the stars. Both individual stars and constellations are named. The inscriptions include the oldest observation of a nova (1300 BCE). The traditional Chinese sexagesimal system for numbering days and years was used and the traditional Chinese calendar system with its twelve 30 or 29 day months and an occasional leap month was already well established. A ten day week was in operation so that three weeks conveniently fit into a month. Accurate solar observations were being made with characters representing the solstices and eclipses. Observations were also made of the planets, especially Jupiter.
The practice of telling the future through oracle bones is known as scapulimancy (telling the future through the scapula, the shoulder bone, of an animal), plastromancy (using a turtle's plastron) or pyromancy (the use of fire). These methods all declined when the book known as the I-Ching (a fortune-telling manual which uses hexagrams and yarrow sticks) became more popular in the Zhou Dynasty. Oracle bones continued to be used in later dynasties but not as regularly as during the Shang. The oracle bones are important primary sources on the history of the Shang Dynasty. They are the earliest written records of Chinese civilization. Eventually the divining practice originated the Chinese script. The symbols used in divination became words and a recognizable Chinese script developed. Up until the discovery and analysis of the oracle bones it was common for Western scholars to believe that Chinese language and history was relatively late in development - that it really only commenced with the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE.

Note: The retired Sinologist Davis Pankenier writes (Hastrol-L, 14 November 2021): "The earliest inscribed scapulas and tortoise plastrons date from the late 13th century BCE at the earliest. The purpose of the divinations was not so much to "predict" the future as to confirm or disconfirm a proposed course of action, e.g. whether or not to perform this or that propitiatory sacrifice. So they are typically propositions rather than questions. The oracle response was either "auspicious" or "inauspicious," no more. There is a well known series of records of 5 verifiable lunar eclipses in the first half of the 12th century from the reigns of the first two kings of the late Shang dynasty that helped to pin down when the Shang first began to record the divinations and outcomes in writing on the bones. The practice itself is much, much older, dating from the Neolithic. The Shang dynasty began around 1562 or thereabouts. "
The fact that a literate civilisation existed in China as early as the Shang period argues against Chinese civilisation being heavily influenced by ancient Near Eastern/Middle Eastern culture.
Reported as a Neolithic period stone carving of the Big Dipper star formation found on Baimiaozi Mountain near Chifeng City in northwest China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
In August 15, 2006, Xinhua News reported: "A neolithic stone carving of the Big Dipper star formation has been found on Baimiaozi Mountain near Chifeng City in northwest China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to experts. The stone carving was discovered by Wu Jiacai, a 50-year-old researcher in literature and history with Wongniute Banner of Inner Mongolia. Wu found a large yam-shaped stone, 310 centimeters long, onto which 19 stars had been carved. The representation of the Big Dipper is on the north face of the stone. The stars are represented by indentations in the stone. The biggest indentation is 6 centimeters in diameter and 5 centimeters deep, said Wu. "The stone was carved by neolithic dwellers," said Gai Shanlin, researcher with the Inner Mongolia Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology (IMICRA) and an expert in stone carving. The carving style proves this, said Gai. Astronomers' conjectures about the shape of the Big Dipper some ten thousand years ago also match the carving. "Finding a stone carving in China's desert hinterland is a rare occurrence," said Tala, director of IMICRA, who said it might help prove how ancient celestial bodies evolved. Apart from the Big Dipper, Wu also found some "unexplained images" on the stone. He thinks they may depict ancient gods, such as the god of the sun and the god of horses. Further study would be needed to determine when the pictures were painted. Many neolithic jade articles from the Hongshan Culture - such as a dragon with a pig's mouth and a cloud-shaped pendant - have already been unearthed around Baimiaozi Mountain. The Hongshan Culture was an aboriginal culture that existed in northern China about 6000 years ago. Tala believes the discovery will contribute to knowledge about the origin and spread of Hongshan Culture."
Note: Wu Jiacai likes to make these sort of claims involving the Hongshan culture. Shortly after making the possible 'big dipper' petroglyph discovery he announced the finding of groups of petroglyphs in Inner Mongolia which he interpreted as showing that an intellectually advanced ethnic group, the Chifeng people of the Hongshan Culture, were forced to leave their homeland because of a singular destructive event, perhaps comet - or meteorite-related.
In 2006 the British astronomer Alun Salt post at his website: "A question I would ask is how many other carvings are there in the region? If there's tens of thousands, then by sheer chance you'd expect some carvings to look like some asterisms. There's mixed news on this: ""Finding a stone carving in China’s desert hinterland is a rare occurrence," said Tala, director of IMICRA, who said it might help prove how ancient celestial bodies evolved." If you want to be sceptical then you could ask "If the sky is important why aren't there more carvings?" Well it could be the first to be found. Inner Mongolia isn't famous for being wellexplored and if people know roughly what they're looking for similar items may be found. I'd take the opposite view – the lack of carvings reduces the random factor. Though not perfectly. Apart from the Big Dipper, Wu also found some "unexplained images" on the stone. He thinks they may depict ancient gods, such as the god of the sun and the god of horses. Further study would be needed to determine when the pictures were painted. This is the bit that bothers me most. If the researchers were finding meaning in random patterns then wouldn't the result be that you could match some but not others. The converse problem is that when they're creating artefacts people do make mistakes and change their mind. It could well be that some of the carvings were meant to be the Big Dipper and others were never meant to have any meaning. When you arrive at the stone thousands of years later without the aid of written records how do you tell the difference?"

Sketch of the design and arrangement of Tomb M45 at Xishuipo, Puyang, Henan Province.
In the 1987, an intact Neolithic tomb (now designated tomb/grave number M45) was found at Xishuipo (a Neolithic archaeological site associated with the Yãngsháo culture) in Puyang, Henan Province. (The tomb was found in the Yãngsháo cultural stratum.) The site was excavated from 1987 to 1988; 186 burials were discovered at the site. The Neolithic grave is dated to circa 5300 BCE and it is assumed to be that of a king or a 'shaman' (certainly the owner was considered an elite or divine person). (According to the carbon 14 determination, and tree ring date-testing archeologists concluded that the tomb was built in the Yangshao cultural period about 6,500 years ago.) The burial arrangement suggests cosmological and astronomical significance. The tomb layout suggests a celestial pattern is being indicated. According to some interpretations a (composite) sky map is being depicted. The form of the grave itself is in the shape of a crown. The belief that heaven was composed of 6 concentric circles divided by 7 curves established how the crown shape is obtained. The adult skeleton is positioned in the centre of the unusually large cardinally oriented grave. The adult skeleton is laid out in such a way that the southern face above the head was round while the northern face at the foot of the body was square. This conforms to the symbolism of Chinese cosmology which held that Heaven was round and Earth was square. A number of astral forms keep the skeleton company. The body of a tall adult male is flanked by two carefully laid out mosaics formed from white mussel/clam shells, a tiger design to the right (west) and a dragon design to the left (east). These mosaics are believed to be representations of 2 of the 4 super constellations (the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger). In the same tomb there is also a representation of the Big Dipper (in the form of a triangle, as it would have been far in the past), also created from white mussel/clam shells. The Big Dipper is pointing toward the head of the dragon. Two human bones are placed amongst the array of symbols. Three funerary human skeletons were also found in the tomb. The burial was accompanied by the bodies of 3 young children. Clam shell mosaics were also found in two nearby caches. Another key claim is: The funerary skeleton on the north side of the M45 tomb was a young boy's skeleton (estimated to be 15 years old when he died). At the estimated time of the burial his head was pointed in the direction of the sunrise on the Winter Solstice.
"On the Date of Astronomical Phenomena in Tomb No.45 at Xishuipo, Puyang, Henan." by Duan Bang Ning. Abstract: "On the basis of the proper motion of the seven stars of Big Dipper and ecliptic precession in astronomy, through the numerical analysis and comparison with the star maps by microcomputer, we would arrive at such a conclusion. The date of astronomical phenomena in the tomb No.45 at Xishuipo Puyang, Henan is about 133000±1000 years ago. The sun, at that time, was setting beyond the western horizon during Spring Equinox. The latest limit of the date of this astronomical phenomena is 100,000 years ago; and its earliest limit is 160,000 years ago. The ecliptic coordinates of North Pole were at longitude 136° by celestial latitude 66.5°, and that of Spring Equinox Point were at longitude 46° by latitude 0°. The epoch of them is 2000.0 A.C. Of course, the triangle arranged with clam shells, a copy of the four stars in the bowl of ancient Big Dipper, is certainly the record of earliest astronomical observation. It is also the earliest record of scientific observation in the history of mankind." (Note: This statement in relation to the dates claimed obviously need to be treated with caution.)
The mosaics in tomb M45 are of similar design to the designs found in the Zenghouyi tomb in Hubei Province, which was built circa 1000 BCE. The designs on the cover of a lacquer box in the Zenghouyi tomb are the earliest written records of the 28 lunar lodges (divisions of the sky) in China. The clam shell mosaics in tomb M45 may represent the constellations (be evidence for a celestial map) and be evidence for a calendar.

Features of Chinese Celestial Mapping

"Ancient Chinese astronomers divided the night sky into many more constellations than the Greeks. They identified roughly 300 small star groups or 'asterisms', most of which contained no more than five stars. They saw the celestial vault as a macrocosm of the Chinese empire, and almost every aspect of life was represented there. Asterisms and stars in the Purple Palace region – which always remains above the horizon – include the Emperor, Empress and Crown Prince. Also appearing in the sky are Minister, Keeper of the Law, Commander-in-Chief, Celestial Prison, Celestial Granary, Row of Shops and Celestial Stable. A planet or comet entering a constellation was an omen for the terrestrial equivalent. As an astrological treatise compiled in the 7th century AD remarks, 'When a comet leaves (the Celestial market), alterations in the sites of market places or a change of capital may be expected.' The most important features of the Chinese divisions of the sky were the xiu or lunar lodges – 28 constellations circling the equatorial regions. They had some parallels with the Western zodiac, playing a major role in astrology, and were used to pinpoint the positions of stars in other asterisms. In 1978, a list of the names of all 28 lunar lodges was discovered in a tomb in Hubei province, inscribed on the lid of a lacquer chest dating from 433 BC. It is these same star groups that are portrayed on the Jiaotong star map.
The map's colours – mainly reds, blues and greens – are still quite vivid, although some of the paint has flaked off. The lunar lodge star groups are displayed in a ring 2.9 metres in diameter. Inside the ring are typically Taoist representations of the Sun (containing a flying crow) and Moon (complete with hare and toad), and also cranes flying among clouds. The ring arrangement means that the orientation of the constellations relative to one another is not accurate, but individual constellations are clearly recognisable. About half the lunar lodges depicted on the tomb ceiling are still well preserved. Several of these resemble those found on later star charts. Some 80 surviving stars are depicted by white dots of roughly equal size, joined into groups by short lines, both features which appear on later Chinese star maps. In general, such maps make little or no attempt to distinguish between stars of different brightness. It was the 17th century before the Western system of stellar magnitudes, developed by Ptolemy, was first introduced to China.
When the Jesuit Matteo Ricci reached China’s capital Peking in AD 1601, he was followed by a succession of Jesuit priests, many of whom were excellent astronomers. Several attained the position of Astronomer Royal at the Qing court. It was the Jesuits who introduced to China Western techniques of mapping the sky, including the division of the stars into six classes of brightness and the first accurate knowledge of the far southern stars. Jesuit star charts in the Chinese style include a bronze celestial globe 1.5 metres in diameter produced by Ferdinand Verbiest in 1670, and an extensive map displaying more than 3000 stars produced by a team of Jesuits in 1752. The globe, which weighs nearly 4 tonnes, is at the Old Observatory in Peking and is still in excellent condition after more than 300 years in the open air.
Traditional Chinese mapping of the sky came to an end in 1903, with a celestial globe about a metre in diameter which shows 1440 stars. This replaced the globe cast by Verbiest which had been taken to Germany in 1900 and was not returned to China until 1921. Formal Western astronomy was adopted in 1912 with the establishment of the Chinese Republic, but the star maps remain a unique record of the heavens of antiquity."

Introduction to the 'Standard' Chinese Celestial System
Astronomy in ancient China was framed in polar and equatorial, rather than planetary and ecliptic, terms. The structural basis of the Chinese universe comprised the Quintuple - 4 cardinal points of the compass and the Pole-star.
In classical Chinese astronomy, the northern sky is divided geometrically, into 5 'enclosures' (palaces) (besides the astral palaces of the quadrants, there was a 5th, central palace, cosmically empowering the Emperor), and 28 lunar lodges along either along the equator or ecliptic, grouped into 4 symbols of seven asterisms each. The 28 lunar lodges are one of the most important and also perhaps the most ancient structures in the Chinese sky, attested at least from the 5th-century BCE. (Note: Also, there was a fifth cardinal direction - the centre, representing Earth (China itself) and represented by a 5th legendary beast, Huáng-lóng, or the Yellow Dragon of the Centre.)

In ancient Chinese astronomy there are 4 great sky animals; Dragon (East), Tiger (West), Vermillion bird (South), and Tortoise (North). The Black Tortoise, Xuan wu represents the winter; the Blue Dragon (sometimes described as green), Qing long represents the spring; the Red Bird, Zhu que, represents the summer, and the White Tiger, Bai hu, represents the west and the autumn. Each of these sky animals in turn is subdivided into 7 lodges or hsiu (or xiu), also called incorrectly, by Western writers, lunar mansions/lunar houses. In India the term nakshatra and in the Islamic empire the Arabic term manāzil meant 'mansion.' The sinologist Nathan Sivin has explained (Granting the Seasons, 2009, Page 90) the term hsiu refers primarily to a temporary lodging, not to one's home. (The constellations or hsiu are grouped by the four directions.) Each hsiu has a number of neighbouring asterisms called paranatellons.
(Note: The Rongcheng Shi manuscript recovered in 1994 gives five directions rather than four and places the animals quite differently: Yu the Great gave banners to his people marking the north with a bird, the south with a snake, the east with the sun, the west with the moon, and the center with a bear.)
The system of lunar lodges was prominent in major ancient Far Eastern/Asian countries. The system was a method for dividing a section of the sky by using 27/28 stars/asterisms spread out in a band circling the sky (usually the celestial equator). The lunar lodges are latitudes the Moon crosses during its monthly journey around Earth and so they serve as a method for tracking the Moon's movement. Nathan Sivin writes (Granting the Seasons, 2009, Page 90): "The original purpose of the lunar lodges, as of the zodiac, was to allow observers to estimate fairly accurately the position of a star or celestial phenomenon without needing a graduated instrument."
The 2 most ancient ways in which the Chinese divided the celestial sphere, for both cosmological and observational purposes, were: (1) the five palaces, and (2) the lunar lodges. The lunar lodges are believed by the sinologists David Nivison and David Pankenier to date back to the early 2nd millennium BCE.
Other (later) Chinese systems of dividing the sky were: the nine fields, the three walls, the Jupiter stations, the fortnightly periods, and degrees. With the system of Jupiter Stations the equator was divided into 12 equal sectors reflecting the approximately 12-year orbital period of the planet Jupiter. The 12 Jupiter stations do not equate to the 12 signs of the Western zodiac and the term "Chinese zodiac" is a misconception. With the system of Fortnightly Periods the 24 fortnightly periods were nominal 15 day sub-divisions of the tropical year. They marked out a series of sub-seasons that defined the agrarian solar calendar for everyday use. The fortnightly periods were an average of 15.219 days each but were counted in whole days. When necessary extra days were inserted into the system to account for the accumulated fractional days. With the system of 'degrees' the equator, the ecliptic, and all other celestial circles were divided into 3651⁄4 'degrees.' Thus the Chinese system of celestial 'degrees' were slightly smaller than the Western celestial degrees where a circle consisted of 360 degrees. The Chinese system of 'degrees' remained in use until the introduction Jesuit methods into Chinese astronomy.
The Lunar Lodges
A lunar 'lodge' is a section of the sky whose boundaries are delineated with the aid of 27/28 stars/asterisms spread out in a band (either along the equator or ecliptic) that circles the sky.
The term hsiu (or xiu) refers to the Chinese system of lunar lodges. The stars marking the 28 divisions were obviously selected to enable a geometrical division of the sky. They are distributed very approximately along the celestial equator. The scheme of 28 divisions is a convenient average for measuring the motion of the moon (i.e., the sidereal month). However, their relation to the moon is not documented in surviving Chinese texts. According to the British sinologist Joseph Needham the lunar lodges were derived from the 271⁄3 days of the moon' sidereal period, but anciently they were also commonly associated with the 291⁄2 year orbital period of Saturn approximated as 28 years.) They served as one of the dimensions of the Chinese polarequatorial system. The earliest Chinese records mentioning star names deal with the hsiu (xiu). However, the origin of the Chinese system of 28 celestial lodges remains a debated issue. It is possible the hsiu originated from existing constellations.
Before the Han Period there did not exist any complete description of the sky. It remained largely unconstellated. Only 38 star names or constellation names are mentioned in pre-Han literature. These 38 stars names or constellation names were either the 28 hsiu (xiu) or were popular stars or constellations

(appearing in folklore or poems) such as Niulang (= alpha Aquila), Zhinu (= alpha Lyra), and Beidou (= Ursa Major). (Later, the 7 bright stars of Ursa Major were known as Yu Ya (the Chariot) and the Milky Way was known as Tian He (Celestial River) or Yin He (Silver River).)
The 28 lunar lodges came to form the basis of the Chinese astronomical coordinate system (i.e., reference points). Throughout the length of Chinese history the system of 28 lunar lodges was the main system for defining the position of a celestial object. The hsiu (or xiu) constellations are constantly used throughout Chinese history as precise markers of the positions of celestial bodies during the seasons. Each hsiu (xiu) has a triangular patch of the sky extending up to the North Pole. (This is because the 28 lunar lodges sliced the celestial sphere into 28 sectors similar to the sections of an orange. All lines radiated from the "orange stem" of the north celestial pole. Each of the 28 sectors contained one of the lunar lodges and the width of a sector was (to some extent) dependant of the size of the constellation (lunar lodge).) As the lunar lodges were spaced out, more or less, along both sides of the celestial equator, this coordinate system was usually regarded as an equatorial system. Some modern researchers, however, hold that the lunar lodges mostly followed the ecliptic. (However, Chinese astronomy generally ignored both the horizon and the ecliptic.)
Each lunar lodge was numbered and named for a constellation or asterism. The 18th lunar lodge was called Mao and was formed by the stars of the Pleiades, The 21st lunar lodge was called Shen and was nearly identical to the modern European constellation Orion.
William O'Neill (Early Astronomy from Babylonia to Copernicus (1986, Page 179) writes: "An interesting and unique feature of the hsiu was the designation of 28 circumpolar stars on approximately the same meridians as the hsiu stars. Thus even when a hsiu star was below the horizon its direction could be read from its paranatellon (a star crossing the meridian at the same time)." Since the pole star and the stars near it never set beneath the horizon at any time during the year (whereas most stars do), the Chinese gave greatest attention to them, and by noticing where the starts at the top of a sky segment were, they could then precisely specify where the stars at the bottom of the same sky segment were, even though they might be invisible beneath the horizon. The 'keying' of the hsiu with circumpolar stars was the core of this system of dividing the sky.
The Shangshu (Book of Documents) contains a paragraph concerning 4 cardinal asterisms and is generally agreed to record the observation of stars before the 21st-century BCE. Also, a similar reference appears in the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian (life dates: circa 145-90 BCE, Prefect of the Grand Scribes in the Han government, and astrologer) describing the Xia dynasty circa 2000 BCE.
A period of particular interest for the constellating of the entire Chinese sky is the Han Period (circa 200 BCE-200 CE). Prior to the Han Dynasty the constellation system of 28 lunar lodges (presumably developed in reference to the sidereal month), and little else, was established. The earliest description of the entire Chinese sky is given in the Tianguan Shu (Monograph on Heavenly Officers) by Sima Qian (circa 145 BCE 87 BCE). In this book he mentions 91 constellations (including the 28 lunar lodges) including approximately 500 stars. It is the earliest existing book to systematically describe the Chinese constellations. Another feature was the Chinese sky was divided into 5 palaces.
Oracle bone inscriptions mention asterisms. Some of the inscriptions on the oracle bones (mainly fragments of turtle/tortoise shells (carapaces) and mammalian bones (i.e., the scapulae of oxen) discovered at Anyang, and which date to the Shang Period (circa 16th- to 11th-century BCE), contain some star names. (The fragments of carapaces or mammalian bones were subjected to heat and the paths made by the resulting cracks were interpreted to answer questions about current or future events.) The star names plausibly indicate the existence of a scheme for dividing the sky along the equatorial circle into 4 main divisions was being developed at the time. It is generally accepted that at least 4 quadrantel hsiu were already known in China in the 14th-century BCE. The discovery of the Shang Oracle bones makes it possible to trace the gradual development of the system of Chinese lunar lodges from the earliest mention of the 4 quadrantel asterisms. A turtle's shell with its domed shell and flat plastron (the nearly flat part of the shell structure of a turtle - the belly or ventral surface of the shell) is particularly symbolic of the dome of heaven and the flat earth below.
The earliest form of Chinese writing is this oracle bone script, used from 1500 BCE to 1000 BCE. (Turtle shell divination reached its peak circa 1200 BCE.) The vague term "primitive writing" has been applied to

the inconclusive markings on broken stone-axe pieces from the Neolithic-era Liangzhu relic site (dated circa 3000 BCE) in eastern china, denoting they are somewhere between symbols and words.
The Canon of Yao (comprising the first section of the Shu Ching (Classic of History), dated circa 4th-century BCE, states that the 4 stars named Huo, Hsü, Mao, and Niao) mark the 4 tropic times (equinoctial and solstitial points). The 4 tropic times (equinoctial and solstitial points) correspond with the middles of the 4 seasonal quarters of the year, not with their beginnings. (This arrangement would have been approximately true for circa 2400 BCE. See: The Alphabet and Ancient Calendar Signs by Hugh Moran and David Kelley (2nd edition, 1969, Page 148).) Much later, during the Han Period (circa 200 BCE-200 CE), the 4 stars Huo (the 5th hsiu), Hsü (the 11th hsiu), Mao (the 18th hsiu), and Niao (the 25th hsiu) were identified with 4 of the 28 lunar lodges. By the Han Period the 28 lunar lodges were linked to the celestial equator. Between 23004300 BCE some 18-20 of the hsiu fell wholly or partly within a belt falling 10 degrees north or south of the celestial equator. (See: The Alphabet and Ancient Calendar Signs by Hugh Moran and David Kelley (2nd edition, 1969, Page 149).)
The system of 28 lunar lodges of unequal sectors dates back to at least the second half of the 5th-century BCE. (The hsiu (xiu) are quite unequal in size. The reason for this is to make them 'key' accurately with circumpolar stars. Some of the hsiu had to be very wide because there were no circumpolar stars to which narrower divisions could be 'keyed.' There was, however, a tendency for approximate pairing of the widths of xius on opposite sides of the sky. Throughout the ancient and medieval periods fixing their widths remained a continuing problem. (The sinologist Nathan Sivin has explained (Granting the Seasons, 2009, Page 93): "The widths of the Chinese lodges changed [partly due to precession] gradually over the centuries.") By the start of the Christian era, the sizes of the 28 lunar lodges were calculated as varying between 2 degrees and 33 degrees.) The names of all the 28 lunar lodges are inscribed on a lacquer(ed) box cover (clothes chest cover) found in the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng. Zeng was a minor state. This is the earliest extant list of all 28 hsiu. The tomb (located on a hillside in Hupei Province) is dated to 433 BCE. The lacquer(ed) box is now kept in the Hupei Provincial Museum. (The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1977 and excavated by Chinese archaeologists in 1978.)
Twenty-three hsiu (xiu) are in the Yueh Ling (Monthly Ordinances), and this content may date back as early as circa 850 BCE. (However, the Yueh Ling (a calendar) as a publication dates to the 3rd-century BCE.)
Due to concern to relate the heavens and the earth to each other (as belonging to the same universe) a correspondence was drawn between the 28 lunar lodges and territorial divisions that could be identified on earth.
Also see: Kalinowski, Marc. (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." (Chinese Science, Number 13, Pages.55-81).
Note 1: Recent archaeological discoveries suggest that the system of hsiu (xiù) probably had a long history of development. In the Neolithic tomb (designated tomb/grave number M45) excavated in 1987 at Púyáng, Henan Province, the images of a dragon and a tiger, made of shells, were found along the sides of the body of a male in the Yãngsháo cultural stratum dating to circa 5000 BCE. The skeleton is oriented so that its skull points to the south. The interest in this discovery lies in the comparison with the astronomical diagram found in the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (a minor state). It can be readily identified that in both cases the dragon lies in the east and the tiger in the west. This seems to indicate that the astronomical significance attached to the images of the dragon and tiger seen in the astronomical diagram in the tomb (found in Hupei Province in 1978 and dated to 433 BCE) of the Marquis Yi perhaps has its origins in archaic (Neolithic) mythology. The relationship was likely established by Neolithic skywatchers, perceiving the configurations of the stars in the east to have the image of a dragon and those in the west to have the image of a tiger. (In East Asia, the Neolithic goes from 6000 BCE to 2000 BCE.) Such an origin would also account for the fact that the hsiu (xiù) are not equally spaced and that some of the determinative stars were quite distant from the celestial equator. (See: Early Chinese Work in Natural Science by Chen Cheng-Yīh (1996, Pages 183-184).
Note 2: "As originally conceived, the lodges did not technically constitute a zodiac, since, with the exception of comets, novae and the like, the Sun, Moon and planets, did not actually appear among their constituent stars; many of the latter in ancient times actually lay closer to the celestial equator than to the ecliptic." (Astrology and Cosmology in Early China by David Pankenier (2013; Page 8).)

The Determinative Stars for the Lodges
The Chinese also chose the determinative stars for their lunar lodge system on the basis of 180 degree pairing, a remarkable feat for the 4th-millennium BCE. Nathan Sivin writes (Granting the Seasons, 2009, Page 93): "Each lodge began with a star and was named after the constellation to which it belonged. These determinative stars ("determinatives" for short), were not necessarily the brightest stars in their constellations; in some cases their magnitude was as low as 4 or 5. They were far from equidistant. The width of a given lodge - the distance from its determinative star to that of the next lodge - varied from 0.05 tu to over 33 tu." (A tu = a Chinese degree (slightly less than a degree in Western astronomy. A tu was subdivided into 100 parts.)
According to Kazuhiko Miyajima: "The determinative stars are mostly located near the western end of constellations, but sometimes they are in other places. Sometimes they are less bright. We do not know what criterion was used for their selection." According to Nathan Sivin they were not chosen for their proximity to either the equator or the ecliptic.
The 28 xiu asterisms and their determinative stars. The set of 28 xiu - loosely positioned along the equatorial belt - functioned as convenient references to specify the celestial positions of celestial objects. Their usage is found as early as the oracle bone (shell-bone) inscriptions dating to the Shāng dynasty, late 2nd-millennium BCE (Bronze Age China), before the set of 27/28 xiu was completed. It is apparent that the xiu-determinative stars were not chosen on the basis of their magnitude. Some of them were 4th magnitude and one was 6th magnitude. What is suggested is they were chosen because of certain specific positional requirements.

The Chinese sky as a Mirror of Human Society
The most important Chinese constellations were located near the celestial north pole, among the stars visible all year round. This is where the supreme god resided with his wives and children and where he held court with his officials.
The Chinese sky as a mirror of human society was based on the philosophy and cosmology of the Han period. The scheme of constellations imitated the Chinese social system/civil institutions of the Han period. (Some 19th-century scholars believed the system existed prior to the Han period i.e., the preceding Qin dynasty.) The Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) was one of the most important and long-lasting dynasties in all of Chinese history.
See: Sun, Xiaochun [Xiaochun, Sun]. (2011). "Connecting Heaven and Man: The role of astronomy in ancient Chinese society and culture." (The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture, Proceedings of the IAU Symposium Number 260, 2009, D. Valls-Gabaud and A. Boksenberg, Editors. Pages 98-106). The role astronomy played in establishing heaven-man relationship in ancient China- which gave Chinese astronomy its most important characteristics. The Heaven-Man relationship in ancient China was politically and morally significant. China has maintained for continuous periods longer than any other civilisations accurate records of diverse celestial phenomena such as eclipses, novae, comets, meteors, sunspots, etc.
The Five Palaces
One of the several ways in which the ancient Chinese sky was divided was the scheme of the five palaces (corresponding with the emblems or symbols of the Five Phases, and being named accordingly). This system was one of the simplest, and also one of the oldest, divisions of the sky. In this system the Chinese sky is divided into 5 general divisions (Wu Gong) of asterisms. These corresponded traditionally to Five Phases/Five Elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water), and the 5 Chinese cardinal points, East, North, West, South, and Middle (Centre). The 5th cardinal point, the central (middle) region or purple palace), is the most important one and corresponds to the circumpolar region of stars (i.e., the stars surrounding the north celestial pole) which never, for an observer in northern China, dip below the horizon. The circumpolar stars were the key constellations to the lunar lodges of the hsiu (xiu). Each of the 28 equatorial divisions had a circumpolar constellation as well as an equatorial constellation. The "central palace" consisted of all

circumpolar stars within 40 degrees of the north celestial pole and was called the tzu-wei kung, 'Palace of Purple Tenuity.
The 28 lunar lodges comprised 4 main sky divisions (also the 4 palaces). The 4 main divisions were the Blue (sometimes Green) Dragon (east), the Black Tortoise (north), the White Tiger (west), and Red Bird (south). By the Han era the polar region of the sky was called the 5th celestial palace. The hsiu (xiu) were formed into 4 equal groups (segments) or palaces (Gong) of 7 lunar lodges (in each Gong) which were called the Four Images. The Four Images corresponded to the 4 cardinal points in the sky and to the 4 seasons of the year. (Each of these palaces represented one of the 4 seasons.) These 4 other regions or (non-central) palaces (that were called the palaces of North, East, South, and West) as well as grouping the equatorial constellations into the 4 geographical directions, were also associated with (symbolised by) an animal and a colour. East is the blue(-green) dragon, north is the black turtle (tortoise) (or paired turtle and snake), west is the white tiger, and south is the red bird (Vermillion bird). (Stars in these areas represented and were named for more mundane aspects of Chinese society, such as temples, philosophical concepts, shops and markets, farmers, soldiers, etc.)
In the Han shu (the standard history of the Han dynasty, probably compiled by Ma Hsü sometime before 150 CE) there are 783 stars that are identified and placed within the five palaces of the heavens.
Léopold de Saussure believed the system of lunar lodges was the origin of the system of the five celestial palaces. According to Léopold de Saussure the system of five celestial palaces and accompanying position of the pole and position of the solstices and equinoxes at the centre of these five palaces have maintained their position through the whole period of their use in Chinese history, and date to circa 2,500 BCE.
The Nine Fields
This was a similar concept to the system of the five palaces. The scheme of the nine fields of heaven are simply an elaboration of the scheme of the five palaces. The portion of the sky surrounding the north circumpolar stars was divided into 8 truncated sectors (rather than 4). Each of the nine fields was allotted three (four in the case of the central northern field) of the 28 lunar lodges. However, the lunar lodges are not actually located in the fields to which they are assigned (which was done for astrological purposes).
The Three-Wall System
An additional feature of the Chinese sky (dating from the Tang Period, 618-907 CE) is the 3-wall system. There were 3 enclosed areas (3 walled regions) in the Chinese sky. During the Tang Period Wang Xi-Ming composed a poem to help memorise the asterisms in the sky. In his poem, Wang Xi-Ming divided the sky into 31 regions comprising 3 enclosures and 28 lunar lodges.
The 3 enclosed areas of the Chinese sky were Ziwei Yuan (known as the Purple Forbidden Enclosure), Taiwei Yuan (known as the Supreme Palace Enclosure), and Tianshi Yuan (known as the Heavenly Market Enclosure). The word yuan means wall and it was formed by stars surrounding each enclosed area. These regions reflect the organization of the dynastic hierarchy on earth, with the Purple Forbidden Enclosure being the most important.
Ziwei Yuan (called the Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Zigong), also known as the Enclosure of Purple Subtlety) comprised the circumpolar region and included 15 constellations. This circumpolar region harboured the celestial image of the emperor (and empress, and imperial court concubines), his different court dignitaries (ministers and military commanders), and court facilities (including the palace kitchen). The brightest star of the constellation called the North Pole (Beiji) was called Di (the Emperor). Encircling them is the imperial palace which is also marked by stars, including the surrounding external walls. The Ziwei Yuan mimicked the terrestrial royal palace (i.e., was identified with the imperial palace). It extended over the stars of the Western constellations Draco, Ursa Major, and Cameleopardus. (Many parts of the Forbidden City and the circumpolar region shared the same names.) The wall was formed with 15 stars. (According to Ho Peng Yoke the region was enclosed by two chains of stars, representing the walls of the Forbidden City.)
The Tianshi Yuan and Taiwei Yuan were located between the Ziwei Yuan and the ecliptic.

The Taiwei Yuan (called the Supreme Palace Enclosure, also known as the Enclosure of Supreme/Purple Subtlety) included 13 constellations and the wall was formed with 22 stars. It was formed from a broad circle of 10 stars in the Western constellations Virgo and Leo (which have the appearance of a circle) and, to the north, a cluster of 15 stars in the Western constellation Coma Berenices (identified as the "Seats of the Court Gentlemen" (lang-wei).) Within the enclosure, the Western star beta Leonis and 4 smaller stars nearby are known as the "Seats of the Five Emperors" (Wu di zuo). This region was related to the emperor, his household, and his official hierarchy.
The Tianshi Yuan (called the Heavenly Market Enclosure) included 13 constellations and the wall was formed with 10 stars. The Imperial Throne (Di zuo) lay within this enclosure and was identified with the Western star alpha Hercules. This region was related to the general state of the economy in the emperor's empire.
The lunar lodges were also grouped by the four directions (divided among the 4 cardinal directions (each of which has a descriptive symbol) - each cardinal direction holding 7 lunar lodges). Four symbols represented the 28 lodges - 1 symbol representing 7 lodgess. The 4 symbols are the Azure Dragon (= East) (The Azure Dragon of the East), the White Tiger (= West) (The White Tiger of the West), the Tortoise (also known as the Murky Warrior) (= North) (The Black Tortoise of the North), and the Vermilion Bird (= South) (The Vermillion Bird of the South). These directional gods are believed by the sinologists David Nivison and David Pankenier to date back to the early 2nd millennium BCE.
Since the Tang Dynasty, the 3 Yuan and the 28 hsiu (xiu) became the main structure by which the Chinese organised the stars.
The Pole Star
There are indications that some Han Period writers identified β Ursae Minoris as being the Pole Star.
Chinese Political Cosmology
The Chinese - at least from the Han period - believed the sky to be the other half of the earth. They also believed the sky was a mirror of the earth. As such ancient Chinese astronomy was a political science. Each part of the sky was subdivided to correspond to the different regions of the earthly Chinese empire. The bureaucratic governing structure of China was also reflected in the sky. Chinese astronomers searched the sky for celestial changes as these were regarded as omens. The Chinese sky was intimately linked to the symbolism of the Middle Kingdom i.e., the "Central States" along the Yellow River valley.
Diffusion of Indian Astronomy Into China
In the first century CE, the expansion of China into Central Asia exposed Chinese astronomers to Hindu and Persian astronomical knowledge. Chinese documents mention astronomers from Near Asia visiting China in 164 CE. Other Chinese documents mention the astronomer Ho-Tsheng-Tien learning astronomy from an Indian priest. This priest taught him, among other things, knowledge of how to determine latitude from the meridian height of the Sun. Indian astronomy was introduced into China with the journeys of Buddhist monks into China from the late 2nd-century to the early 11th-century CE. During this period of about 800 years an enormous amount of Indian astronomical ideas were introduced into China. This included the Indian system of lunar mansions, the 27 naksatras. This did not result in any great impact on the existing Chinese system of 28 hsiu's (xiu's). (David Pingree and Patrick Morrisey (1989) argue against the common origin or even association of the 28 Chinese xiu (hsiu) with the Indian nakşatras.) Both the Koreans and the Japanese, in part due to the political dominance of China in the region, adopted Chinese uranography. (For Iranian mythology in Chinese mythology see: Cults and Legends of Ancient Iran and China by J. C. Coyagee (1936), now a very scarce book. Sir Jeyhangar Coyagee was a Bombay Parsi, and an eminent Cambridge economist.)

According to one source a constellation was called a "palace," with the major star being the emperor star and lesser stars being princes.

Appendix 2:
The Chinese standard lunar lodge system of 28 'lunar lodges' is attributed to the astrologer/astronomer Shi Shin circa late 4th-century BCE. An earlier (but similar) lunar lodge system is attributed to the scholar Liu Xiang circa 1st-century BCE. This earlier system called the 'old degree' (gudu) system.
"In China there have been two ... systems of 28 'lunar lodges' (xiu), with variations. ... [T]he standard lunar lodge system of the past 2000 years ... is ascribed to ... Shi Shen of the late fourth century BC. ... But ... an eighth century AD encyclopedia of portents, the Kaiyuan zhanjing (ch. 60-3), makes it clear, Shi Shen's system (if it is his) is actually the later of the two. ... [Liu Xiang's earlier] system differs from Shi Shen's only in the widths of the individual lodges, and in the fact that, when the two systems are mapped, the beginning points - the first point of the lodge Jiao - are a few degrees apart in longitude." (Nivison, David. (1989). "The origin of the Chinese lunar lodge system." In: Aveni, Anthony. (Editor). World Archaeoastronomy. (Pages 276-288).)
Appendix 3:
The astronomer Bradley Schaefer has found the best estimate for the formation of the Chinese 'lunar lodge' system is 3250 BCE with a statistical uncertainty of roughly ± 1000 years.
Appendix 4:
In their book The Chinese Sky during the Han. Constellating Stars & Society (1997, Page 96) Sun Xiaochun and Jacob Kistemaker set out that the Chinese star names can be roughly categorised as related with: (1) Heaven itself: sun, moon, and stars as names of constellations; (2) Royal court and clan; (3) Imperial bureaucracy and administration; (4) All kinds of buildings and facilities; (5) Military installations; armies and weapons; (6) Traffic and transportation; (7) Rituals, ceremonies and pictures of social life; (8) Philosophical and religious concepts; (9) Mythological and legendary figures; (10) Administrative provinces and geographical features.
Appendix 5:
The Chinese perceived Heaven to be circular. In Chinese cosmology Heaven had nine levels; each of which was separated by a gate and guarded by a particular animal. The highest level was the Palace of Purple Tenuity where the Emperor of Heaven lived in the constellation Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). At the centre of Heaven there was the North Pole and the polar star. The celestial pole was a critical characteristic of Chinese cosmology. To the Chinese, the centre was the most important geographical point because it was the closest to Heaven. They believed that the heart of civilization lay at the centre of the earth, and as the land spread out, the territories and their inhabitants became more savage. The emphasis on the centre point led to the polar axis being a pivotal aspect of Chinese astronomy. The polar axis, which ran from the polar star south to Earth, was the pivot of Heaven. The vault of Heaven slid up and down the polar axis while the earth itself oscillated along it to create the seasons.
Possibly the 'big dipper' was the single most important asterism in Chinese astronomy, depicted as the celestial chariot of the emperor. The Wu Liang tomb, 2nd-century CE, contained a stone slab of the 'big dipper' with seated royal figure.
Appendix 6:
Because the stars revolve around it the celestial Pole is seen as the center of heaven and belonging to all directions. Dating from the Tang Period the sky surrounding Polaris (Běijíxīng) is divided into 3 regions. These 3 regions are: (1) the Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Zǐ Wēi Yuán), (2) the Supreme Palace Enclosure (Tài Wēi Yuán), and (3) the Heavenly Market Enclosure (Tiān Shì Yuán). These 3 regions reflect the organization of the Chinese dynastic hierarchy on earth, the most important being the Purple Forbidden

Enclosure. The concept that earthly government is organized like that of heaven – at its peak of important during the Tang Dynasty - gives the earthly government its structure, and actions legitimacy, and supports the Mandate of Heaven. The Chinese belief that there was a direct link between the celestial plan and the imperial house was one of the fundamental factors for the continuous dynastic system with consistent heritage from era to era. To remove ties with the heavens meant cutting the government off from legitimacy.
Appendix 7:
The constellations or Xiù are grouped by the four directions, East (dragon), West (tiger), South (vermillion bird), and North (tortoise). The dragon occupies the East and contains the constellations: (Jiăo) Horn, (Kàng) Neck, (Dĭ) Root, (Fáng) Room, (Xīn) Heart, (Wěi) Tail, (Jī ) Winnowing basket. The tiger is in the West and contains the constellations: (Kuí) Legs, (Lóu) Bond, (Wèi) Stomach, (Mǎo) Hairy Head, (Bì) Net, (Zuǐ) Turtle Beak, (Cān) Join - Three Stars. The scarlet or vermillion bird is in the South and contains the constellations: (Jǐng) Well, (Guǐ) Demon, (Lǐ) Willow, (Xīng) Star, (Zhāng) Growth, (Yì) Wings, (Zhěn) Deep emotion. The tortoise occupies the North and contains the constellations: (Dǒu) Dipper, (Níu) Ox, (Nǚ) Woman, (Xū) Emptiness, (Wēi) Danger, (Shì) Room, (Bì) Wall.
Appendix 8:
With the Chinese calendar the equinoxes and solstices marked the center of the seasons rather than the beginnings. The 2 oldest Chinese calendars that have come down to us are the Hsia Hsiao Cheng and the Yūeh Ling. (According to Joseph Needham between 370 BCE and 1851 CE no less than 102 ‘calendars’ (effectively ephemerides) were calculated and promulgated in China, generally at the beginning of particular reigns.)
The Hsia Hsiao Cheng was more of a farmer’s almanac. It was divided into twelve months that would forecast the weather. The Hsia Hsiao Cheng (The Lesser Canon of the Hsia) forms the calendar section of the collection of ritual notes, the Ta Tai Li (The Rites of the Elder Tai). The calendar has nothing to do with the Hsia dynasty itself. Though traditionally regarded as a true relic of the Hsia dynasty (circa 2000 BCE) it is dated by modern scholars such as Joseph Needham on astronomical grounds (the hsiu) to the mid 4thcentury BCE (contemporary with Shi Shen and Gan/Ghan De (Kan Te)). The document is a farmer's calendar but also includes comments on the weather, the stars, animal and vegetable life, all arranged under the 12 moons of the year. It was first translated from Chinese by Robert Douglas (1838-1913), Professor of Chinese, King’s College, London (Orientalia Antiqua, 1892, Pages 1-60), and mistakenly regarded by him as being of great antiquity.
The Yūeh Ling, which was more detailed (longer) than the Hsia Hsiao Cheng, came to be incorporated in the Hsiao Tai Li Chi (Record of the Rites of Tai the Younger) dated to the 1st-century CE. The Yūeh Ling is dated to circa the 3rd-century BCE (and may even be earlier, circa 5th-century BCE. It contains not only monthly divisions and observations, but also set out the various sacrifices and instructions on how to perform them. The Yūeh Ling gives the astronomical characteristics of the (lunar) months with details of the appropriate musical notes, and sacrifices, etc. The bulk of each chapter describes the imperial ceremonies to be performed, the prohibitions of various activities, and warnings of what will occur if the proper/prescribed rites are not followed.
Appendix 9:
From their origin, Buddhists had an interest in intellectual activities which can be called scientific activities. As well as religious beliefs, Buddhist missionaries were involved in the transmission of astronomy and astrology from India to East Asia through Buddhism. This can be divided into three periods. (1) Early Buddhism, (2) Mahayana Buddhism, and (3) Tantric Buddhism.

"The Big Dipper in Ursa Major was and is the most conspicuous asterism in the northern sky. Furthermore it is circumpolar and could be used as a means for identifying the apparent celestial northern pole, respectively the center of heaven, also in times when due to precession there was no actual pole-star. This holds true for a time span from at least the later 4th millennium B.C. until the present. Its importance for the history of religion is recorded in various mythologies geographically ranging from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the Germanic sphere, India, Siberia, China, Korea and Japan, not to mention the Americas. For 150 years there have been scattered reports on so-called cup-marked stones showing the Big Dipper from Switzerland, France, Germany and England. These isolated cases were regarded as coincidence and an astronomical interpretation dismissed by most archaeologists. The author was also inclined to regard these early reports as wishful thinking until he stumbled across two early representations of the Big Dipper in Japan, which correspond to a finding in 2006 of a confirmed neolithic representation on Baimiaozimountain, Mongolia, China. All of these representations include an extra cup-mark/star between the upper stars of the bowl, Megrez and Dubhe. This inconspicious star, BSC 4439, is about as bright as Alcor and is of assistance in locating Thuban (α-draconis), which was the star closest to the pole at around 2800 B.C.. One striking feature about the worldwide representations of the Big Dipper is the fact that it is mostly rendered mirror-inverted. The presentation will introduce the revised and newly found archaeological evidence from Japan and Europe by comparing it to hitherto known representations of the Big Dipper from Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and Korea."
"The Sword, the Snake & the Turtle - Three constellations from pre-modern China?"
"This talk is intended not as a line-up of definite results, but as a basis for discussion of four combined motives on a Chinese coin-charm: 1. the Big Dipper, 2. the sword, 3. the turtle and 4. the snake. The occurrence of astral symbolism on early coins made from bronze, silver or gold has long since been corroborated by thousands of specimen from the Greek, Celtic, Roman and of course the Chinese cultural spheres. Generally speaking these types of currency roughly date from the 4th century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. in Europe and from the Han-period (206 B.C. – 220 A.D.) through to the 19th century in China. At least from about the 1st/2nd centuries A.D. coins were regarded as auspicious objects in China. Noncurrency types of coins displaying cosmological symbolism like e.g. the Big Dipper, the dragon, the snake, the turtle and the tiger were constantly cast as charms until the 19th century. The characteristic arrangement and rendering of the four initially mentioned symbols allow for a hypothetical identification of three hitherto unknown Chinese constellations, namely the sword, the snake and the turtle, which –together with the big dipper - surround the pole of the ecliptic at even distances to each other and to the pole itself. The pole of the ecliptic according to the hypothesis is represented by the center of the coin, which was cast as an open-work square. In fact the four symbols form a cross-shape around the center just as the one certain and the three hypothetical constellations are aligned around the pole of the ecliptic. The sword-constellation consists of the central stars of Cygnus (without the outer wing-stars). The snake-constellation contains Corona Borealis as the distinct central coil, the four northern stars of Hercules as its head and the three northern stars of Bootes as its tail. The head, shell and tail of the turtle-constellation are accurately represented by the six major stars of Cassiopeia, the feet by two smaller stars immediately south of the celestial W-shape. These representations are found on a type of bronze coin that was first issued between 578 and 580 A.D. All representations are rendered mirror-inverted as is also the case with a variety of prehistoric astronomical depictions from China and Europe."
Appendix 11:
The practice of telling the future through oracle bones is known as scapulimancy (telling the future through the scapula, the shoulder bone, of a large animal (cow, buffalo), plastromancy (using a turtle's plastron) or pyromancy (the use of fire). These methods all declined when the book known as the I-Ching (a fortunetelling manual which uses hexagrams and yarrow sticks) became more popular in the Zhou Dynasty. The oracle bones are important primary sources on the history of the Shang Dynasty. They are the earliest written records of Chinese civilization. Eventually the divining practice originated the Chinese script. The symbols used in divination became words and a recognizable Chinese script developed. Up until the discovery and analysis of the oracle bones it was common for Western scholars to believe that Chinese language and history was relatively late in development - that it really only commenced with the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE. Oracle bones are the most important source of primary information about Bronze Age China, including astronomy and celestial divination. Most of the oracle bones discovered come from the Shang Dynasty (circa

members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-24.html 16/22
1600-1046 BCE) but some come from the early Zhou Dynasty (1046-226 BCE). Oracle bones continued to be used in later dynasties but not as regularly as during the Shang.
Oracle Bones (also known as "dragon's bones") were usually the shoulder blades of oxen or plastrons of turtles (the flat, underside of the turtle's shell) which were for divination. The animal bones or turtle shells were heated with a hot needle until cracks appeared in their surface. A diviner would carve (later, simply paint) symbols on the bones of the ox or the turtle shell, apply a hot poker or fire until the bone or shell cracked, and then interpret the direction of the cracks through their drawn symbols to predict the future. The shape of the cracks provided prognostications used by kings to assist in affairs of state. It was the ruler who provided the interpretation and this was usually then inscribed on the bone next to the question. (The cracks were recorded on the same bone as either auspicious or inauspicious.) The heat usually produced two cracks roughly at right angles: one long crack along the grain of the bone and a shorter one across it. The prognostication was recorded on the bone itself, together with the eventual outcome (tending to confirm that the prognostication was correct). The same bone could be re-used several times on different, un-cracked areas and so a bone may bear multiple inscriptions. The texts of the oracle bones, when complete (but this is rarely the case) contain the name of the king for whom the prognostication was made, the day in the 60-day count on which this was done, the question asked, and the answer derived from the cracking (after heating) of the bone.
Oracle bones were primarily used for divination purposes. Oracle bones are typically fragments of large animal bones (cow, buffalo), most often tortoise shells, that have been heated, cracked and then inscribed. The information inscribed variously records historical information about the Chinese dynasties, such as the Shang Dynasty, and astronomical information. Some of the earliest Chinese records of astronomical events are found on divinatory oracle bones that date to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Early Chinese astronomy was closely associated with celestial omenology. Some oracle bones relate to astronomical events, including both solar and lunar eclipses, and form the earliest Chinese records of such phenomena. Many significant astronomical observations and events were recorded on oracle bones as a means of ensuring that a historical record was kept. An oracle bone records an eclipse from 1281 BCE. An oracle bone dating prior to 1281 BCE, mentions stars by their names. Others recorded the passing of comets and novae. One analysis done on an oracle bone dating from the time of the Shang Dynasty of the 14th-century BCE revealed a luni-solar calendar with intercalary months added to it. Oracle bone inscriptions also mention asterisms. The study of oracle bone inscriptions has revealed early, astronomical study of the stars. Both individual stars and constellations are named. The inscriptions include the oldest observation of a nova (1300 BCE). The traditional Chinese sexagesimal system for numbering days and years was used and the traditional Chinese calendar system with its twelve 30 or 29 day months and an occasional leap month was already well established. A ten day week was in operation so that three weeks conveniently fit into a month. Accurate solar observations were being made with characters representing the solstices and eclipses. Observations were also made of the planets, especially Jupiter.
The existence of the oracle bones only became known as late as 1899. They were first identified by the Chinese pharmacist Wang Yirong during the course of his work grinding bones for inclusion in traditional Chinese medicine. A collection of the diagrams of the marks was then published by the noted Chinese scholar and politician Wang Guowei in 1903. In 1928 a full scale archaeological excavation was initiated by Chinese archaeologists. In 1936 they found an undisturbed archive of 17,000 items including bones strung together in bundles. About 10 percent of all the bones are inscribed. In all over 100,000 inscribed bones have been unearthed.
The 60-Day Count: The 60-day count (sexagenary cycle) is an early system of recording days and appears in the first Chinese written texts, the Shang oracle bones of the late 2nd-millennium BCE. Its use to record years began around the middle of the 3rd-century BCE. The 60-day count (sexagenary cycle) is attested as a method of recording days from the earliest written records in China, records of divination on oracle bones, beginning circa 1250 BCE. Almost every oracle bone inscription includes a date in this format. This use of the cycle for days is attested throughout the Zhou dynasty and remained common into the Han period for all documentary purposes that required dates specified to the day. Almost all the dates in the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronological list of events from 722 BCE to 481 BCE, used this system in combination with reign years and months (lunations) to record dates. Eclipses recorded in the Annals demonstrate that continuity in the sexagenary day-count was unbroken from that period onwards. It is likely that this unbroken continuity went back still further to the first appearance of the sexagenary cycle during the Shang period.

Chinese Influence on Japanese Astronomy
It is not known to what extent the ancient Japanese were acquainted with astronomy before Chinese culture reached Japan. The purpose of early circular stones as sun-dials is disputed. It is difficult to identify early star mythology and descriptive astronomy. There is a paucity of written records of ancient views of astronomy in Japan earlier than the 7th or 8th century CE. The early phases of Japanese (scientific) astronomy were dominated by Chinese influence. Japanese people learned Chinese astronomy and astrology for the first time from Korea and then directly from from China. Both Chinese and Korean culture were very influential on Japan - enabled by the social programs initiated by Japanese rulers and also by Buddhist missionaries. Imported Chinese lore was adapted to native beliefs. Knowledge of indigenous native astral/astronomical/calendrical beliefs are now lost. Some Chinese influences on Japanese astronomy/astral beliefs included: Pole Star worship (which was extended to the Big Dipper); use of Chinese constellations as decorative patterns on on the hilts of swords; use of the 28 'lunar mansions' as decorative patterns (i.e., on the cart used in the July Festival of Gion in Kyoto); use of the 4 imaginary animals drawn in cardinal directions. The Pleaides asterism, and the 3 stars of Orion's 'belt' were also early Chinese influences. By at least the 7thcentury CE the Chinese system of 28 'lunar mansions' had become established in Japan. Some early star charts have been found in Japanese tombs, one tomb dating to the 1st-century CE.
Gnomon Use by the Kenyah of Borneo: A Short Overview and Bibliography
The use of a gnomon for solstice measurement as an established tradition among the Kenyah (and also the related Kayan) in Borneo appears confirmed by the academic literature discussing the practice. A gnomon is a shadow casting natural object or surface or culturally constructed. It has a dual use in that it can be used to tell daily time or 'yearly time.' Estimating the time of day by the sun's shadow is in all essentials the same technique as using the length of the sun's shadow to establish (estimate) the solstices. People can estimate the time of day from the position and length of the shadow of a vertical stick (even approximately established) used as a gnomon. Using the gnomon for measuring the solstices, however, requires a more accurately established vertical gnomon and some sort of fixed (permanent) index (or portable template) on level ground to compare shadow-length changes throughout the year as exactly as possible. The achievement of accuracy with solstice measurement is dependent on a number of factors. However, descriptions agree that the Kenyah used assistive practices such as earth calendar techniques.
There is no reason to believe that ethnologists/anthropologists have been consistently unreliable in describing the integrated technique used. It is not indicated that everybody has been reliant on/copying from a single source, the reports of Charles Hose in the early 20th-century; specifically his 1912 book. The fact that Charles Hose published an earlier account in 1906 (1905?) (Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society) indicates that we have usage at least at the close of 19th-century. Charles Hose was a British Administrator (for the North Borneo Chartered Company) who resided in Borneo for almost 2 decades. People are also frequently reliant on Martin Nilsson (1920) and/or Joseph Needham (1953); who are reliant on the account by Charles Hose (1912). However, there are multiple earlier and later sources than these. The earlier sources are brief and likely unknown to Hose, who does not cite them.
The original publication by Dr Charles Hose describing gnomon use by the Kenyah was published in the article "Various Modes of computing the time for Planting among the Races of Borneo." for the Journal of the Straits Society of the Royal Asiatic Society, Number 42, February, 1906 (1905?), Pages 5-10. Hose wrote: "the method they adopt displays a wonderful knowledge of the precautions necessary to accuracy." This includes a technique for ensuring it is perfectly upright. Hose also wrote: "The measuring stick [portable template] has been notched in accordance with the experience of previous years." (Also, the scale for reading the length of the shadow must be accurately horizontal.) This and other assistive techniques make it clear there is not a simple reliance on a single technique that attempts to ascertain very small and not likely precisely measurable changes in noon shadow length.

Martin Nilsson (Primitive Time-Reckoning, 1920, Chapter XII. SOLSTICES AND EQUINOXES. AIDS TO THE DETERMINATION OF TIME. (see page 318)) gives Charles Hose as his source for the brief discussion of gnomon used by the Kenyah of Borneo. (The Kayan method is discussed by Nilsson on pages 317-319.) Nilsson acknowledges he has not seen the 1906 (1905?) article by Hose.
Source: Primitive Time-Reckoning by Martin Nilsson (1920, Page 318).
Joseph Needham gives Charles Hose as his source for the use of the photograph of the gnomon being used in Borneo. Briefly, 'PLATE XXX' 'Fig. 111.' facing page 286 in Science and Civilization in China by Joseph Needham (Volume 3, 1959), carries the caption "Two Borneo tribesmen measuring the sun's shadow at summer solstice with a gnomon and a gnomon shadow template in recent times (photo. Hose & McDougall)." This is referenced on page 768 (BIBLIOGRAPHY C) and identifies the photograph and its interpretation being reproduced from, The Pagan Tribes of Borneo by Charles Hose and William McDougall (1912, 2 Volumes), Volume 1, Plate 60 "Kenyahs measuring the length of the shadow of the As Do [pole/gnomon] at noon to determine the time for sowing Padi.", facing page 108. Also, pages 106-109 make interesting reading.
Interestingly, a few authors who follow the solstice explanation are Richard Heinberg (Celebrating the Solstice, 1993) and Richard Coen (Chasing the Sun, 2011). Others could be mentioned. According to Silvio Bedini (The Trail of Time, 1994, page 8) a common use of the gnomon is to determine the solstices (2 key days of the year). A detailed explanation of the use of the gnomon in Borneo appears in "Cosmology in Southeast Asia." by Joseph Schwartzberg (History of Geography, Volume 2, Book 2, 1995, Chapter 17).
The Kenyah obviously had more than one gnomon in use. But there is 'silence' in the literature regarding the issue of how many were in use amongst the various Kenyan villages. It is not obvious that everything was centred on one village. Obviously, most villages were never visited by British officials of the North Borneo Chartered Company. (North Borneo was a British protectorate under the sovereign North Borneo Chartered Company from 1882 to 1941. In 1888, North Borneo became a protectorate of Great Britain, but its administration remained entirely in the hands of the North Borneo Chartered Company.) It is estimated there are now approximately 70,000 Kenyah people in Borneo living in numerous villages. (It may be that 1000 people is a big village.) Circa 1900 the Kenyah population was much smaller. The Borneo tribesmen were not nomads but agriculturalists and hunters. However, there is some area movement, for example, by the Apo Kayan (who are cultivators). Apo Kayan is also the name of a region. Migration by bands of Kenyah is not unknown.
Book and journal records show that the use of the gnomon in Borneo is much earlier than circa 1900. In, A Mathematical Miscellany in Four Parts by Anonymous (Dublin, 1730) reference is made on page 11 to the use of the gnomon in Borneo (and also Sumatra and Africa). This places gnomon use in Borneo to the early 18th-century. However, the example of gnomon use by the Kenyah of Borneo is likely some 300 years old at least. Its use is mentioned in The Philosophical Transactions and Collections [of The Royal Society], to the end of the year 1700.
On the issue of Kenyah gnomon use for solstice measurement there is nothing to indicate possible poor field work and poor/confused reporting and use of historical material by experienced ethnologists and anthropologists; especially with scholars such as Gene Ammarell and Bernard Sellato. Their issues regarding the facts may likely reflect the content of "Some Suggestions for Future Research in West Kalimantan." by Victor King (Borneo Research Bulletin, Volume 6, Number 2, August, 1974, Pages 31-39).
Is the rather detailed 2008 description given by Gene Ammarell, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Ohio University, unreliable? (Ammarell, Gene. 2008. "Indigenous Astronomical Knowledge of the Indo-Malay Archipelago." In: Encyclopaedia of the History of Non-Western Science: Natural Sciences, Technology and Medicine, revised edition, edited by Helaine Selin. (Volume 1, Pages 324-333).) He writes that the gnomon used by the Kenyah involves a "permanently secured, plumbed" hardwood pole and "a neatly worked, flat measuring stick." We know from Ammarell's 1988 article that he "draws from historical and ethnographic literature." No objections regarding the use of the gnomon by the Kenyah for solstice measurement show sufficient merit to persuade changes to be made to the entry in the 3rd edition (there will surely be one). Also, there are no objections of merit for raising the issue with the multiple specialists who support what Charles Hose has written.

It is worth noting that Gene Ammarell ("Sky Calendars of the Indo-Malay Archipelago: Regional Diversity/Local Knowledge." Indonesia, Volume 45, 1988, Pages 84-104) describes a sophisticated gnomon used in Java from circa 1600 to 1855. (It is also worth noting that the higher the gnomon the more problems there are associated with ensuring accuracy with its establishment.)
What the 2 Kenyah tribesmen are actually doing at the time of the photograph being taken cannot be concluded to be the sole purpose of the gnomon. Hose identifies his photograph as a solstice measurement activity with a shadow template. Some recent criticisms made include: (1) This gnomon is really unsophisticated and the photograph is obviously only evidence for showing it being used to judge the time of day. (2) Describing/implying the gnomon is a hand-held, moveable, non-plumb stick; with the suggestion it is a spear that is being used as a gnomon. As summary: The modern photograph by Hose shows the simple use of a primitive stick-gnomon to gauge the time. (Note: The indication of time from the position of the sun is really only suitable in the tropics, where the sun always rises very high in the sky and the length of its daily course is not subject to much variation.) This criticism can only be voiced by not studying the photograph by Hose and by not reading the relevant text by Hose. The poorly framed criticisms seem to be really questioning the accuracy of the technique rather than whether the solstice determination technique was in place. I think it is sufficiently convincing that the solstice determination technique technique was in place.
It is intriguing that criticisms keep coming back to the particular photograph by Hose and what is believed can be – or can't be – seen in the photograph. However, this does not make the description of the uses of the gnomon erroneous. The ethnologists/anthropologists who have done field work in Borneo and mentioned gnomon use do not construct the apparent problem that critics of the photograph have. The photograph published in 1912 is hardly meant to be a high definition scientific/technical photograph. Though published in 1912 the photograph was obviously taken earlier, perhaps before the 1906 (1905?) article by Hose. Regardless, at that time ethnographic photography was a developing technique. It was likely that glass plate photography was used. There is nothing in the photograph contradicting Hose that it shows traditional sophisticated use of a gnomon and shadow template. No ethnologist/anthropologist working in Borneo after Hose has criticised Hose and his description that Kenyah Tribesmen of Borneo are measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, or 'tukar do' with a measuring scale, or 'aso do.' The purpose of this measuring scale was not to determine the time of day.
From page 713: "Cosmology in Southeast Asia." by Joseph Schwartzberg (History of Geography, Volume 2, Book 2, 1995, Chapter 17) "The tribe in question, the Kenyah Dayak, relies on observing the changing lengths of shadows cast by a gnomon specially constructed for the purpose." From page 712 of the same: "FIG. 17.8. BASE OF GNOMON EMPLOYED BY KENYAH DAYAKS. Notches [of which there are 8 on the template] indicate times for conducting various agricultural operations. The periods when the midday sun's shadow falls between successive notches are those that are appropriate for specific tasks based on prior experience the seasons. These notches are calibrated against specific lengths of portions of the arm of the professional village weather clerk ...."
Gene Ammarell, in: Encyclopaedia of the History of Non-Western Science: Natural Sciences, Technology and Medicine, revised edition, edited by Helaine Selin. (2008, Volume 1, Pages 324-333); writes a lengthy and detailed description of the gnomon used by the Kenyah that includes: The Kenyah observe the position of the sun. Their instrument is a straight cylindrical pole of hardwood, fixed vertically in the ground and carefully adjusted with the aid of plumb-lines; the possibility of its sinking deeper into the earth is prevented. The pole is a little longer than the outstretched arms of its maker and stands on a cleared space by the house, surrounded by a strong fence. The observer has further a flat stick on which lengths measured from his body are marked off by notches. The other side has a larger number of notches, of which one marks the greatest length of the midday shadow, the next one its length three days after it has begun to shorten, and so on. The shadow is measured every midday. As it grows shorter after reaching its maximal length the man observes it with special care, and announces to the village that the time for preparing the land is near at hand. Also, in Bali and Java the seasons are determined by the aid of a gnomon of rude construction, having a dial divided into twelve parts.
From the above 2 descriptions it doesn't seem like an unsophisticated gnomon to me. From Wikipedia (2015), Tropical Calendars: "In Borneo, a type of gnomon is used consisting of an upright rod together with other rods flared out in a fan-like arrangement. This device is called 'togallan,' after the root 'tagal,' to measure. When the togallan is oriented North/South, the shadows of the rods unite and observer knows the



2022. 02. 21. 20:12 History of Constellation and Star Names
members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-24.html 20/22
Sun is in the meridian. At this time the shadow of the Sun can be measured to determine the declination, or it can be fixed by observation using the upright gnomon. If the togallan is oriented East/West then sightings are made at sunrise/sunset."
The reference for clarifying the nature of gnomon use among the Kenyans of Borneo is: "Grasping the World : Measuring and counting among the Aoheng of Borneo." by Bernard Sellato. In: Pierre Le Roux et al (Editors). Poids et measures en Asie du Sud-Est : Systemes métrologiques et sociéties. (2 Volumes, 20042008; see: Volume 1, Chapter 17, Pages 237-258). Bernard Sellato (M.Sc. in Geology and Ph.D. in Anthropology) has spent over 20 years in Kalimantan (the Indonesian part of Borneo) researching history, languages, and cultures. He is Director of the Institute for Research on Southeast Asia, University of Provence. Sellato sets out the beginning of his article (page 237) that he is only interested in establishing "traditional units of measure" prior to the influence of "outside traders, the colonial administration [i.e., pre 1920] and in the last three decades, the influence of world culture." He mentions the summer solstice was used by the Aoheng of Borneo to determine the most auspicious time for sowing. Also, that the Aoheng were influenced by the Kayans but not regarding gnomon use. Both the Aoheng and the Kayans were agriculturalists (mainly rice farmers). Interestingly, Sellato also writes (pages 249-250) regarding gnomon use by the Kayans: "However, for one critical phase of the agricultural cycle, the sowing, a vague notion of the time of the year was not enough. The Busang and the Kayan, the Aoheng's eastern neighbours used a gnomon to ascertain the day of the summer solstice – by measuring at noon day after day, the gnomon's shortest shadow. They then determined the most auspicious time for sowing by a computation of the moon's cycle and a particular method of weather-and-pest prognostication. The first ritual sowing was actually started in a matter of a few days to two weeks after the solstice."
To claim as criticism that neither the "permanently secured, plumbed hardwood pole" and a "neatly worked, flat measuring stick" from the cited text is represented in the photograph referenced is nonsense. (Another strange criticism is to incorrectly state that the tribesmen have a moveable gnomon (spear?) which is held in the hand. It would appear that only the Kayan - not the Kenyah - use a portable/moveable gnomon.) The contention that if Sellato did not take the photograph in question (i.e., the photograph by Hose) to document his contention then it is simply a guess on anybody's part that it shows the solstice measurement activity and not simple the judgment of time of day, ignores book and journal documentation before and after Hose and studies after Hose.
Measuring the solstice date with a 'stick' has problems. The sun changes so little in declination at the time of the solstice that it is exceedingly difficult to establish the date by non-optical shadows. The fact that the daily change in the length of the sun's shadow around the solstice is minuscule and the edge of the shadow unfocused that determining the date to within as little as two weeks by this method is extremely difficult, is why the overall achievement of accuracy with solstice measurement is dependent on a number of factors, terrestrial and astronomical. Descriptions by different ethnologists/anthropologists across some 100 years agree that the Kenyah used assistive practices, including earth calendar techniques. Interpolation of the actual solstice day from precise measurements of the shadow's length on days before and after the solstice is plausible, and year after year, the result would improve. (Note: The Arab-Islamic astronomers got it by observing many weeks before and after and then doing a sophisticated interpolation.)
Also, it is reasonable to argued that traditional peoples, within and beyond the tropics, have been fully aware of the changing elevation of the midday sun, and measurement of a gnomon's shadow is a simple way to establish the relative elevation.
Is the use of the gnomon by the Kenyah still extant today? Interestingly, Yus Ngabut (Palangkaraya University, Central Kalimantan) – who has been doing field work with the Kenyah since at least the 1990's writes (Social Science Research and Conservation Management in the Interior of Borneo edited by Cristina Eghenter, Bernard Sellato, and G. Simon Devung (2003, pages 241-257)) that the Kenyah still use gnomons. An earlier publication also stated this. "The Kenyahs and the Kayans judge the seasons by the sun ...." See: Journal of the Straits Branch (Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland), Issues 40-44, 1965, Page 4. This claim, however, is contradicted by another recent source. According to The Sarawak Museum Journal, 1992: "Presently the tuken do or gnomon is not used anymore - at least [not] in Uma Bawang and Uma Nyavieng ...." Uma Bawang is a village located in Lirong Kawit, a settlement in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. The village consists of a single longhouse that is located near the Baram River and the population in 1990 consisted of 100 Kayan people. "Uma Bawang is the result of the amalgamation of three



2022. 02. 21. 20:12 History of Constellation and Star Names
members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-24.html 21/22
communities: Uma Bawang proper, Uma Daro, and Laham, which have lived in close proximity for over a century...." (Kayan Religion: Ritual Life and Religious Reform in Central Borneo by Jérôme Rousseau (1998, Page 48).) Uma Nyavieng is in the Baluy area, Sarawak. It refers to a territory and group of people (geographic group). (Another source states that the death of the practitioner/priest was a reason recorded for its use being discontinued in one village. Jérôme Rousseau's 1998 book makes it obvious that knowledge of the proper use of gnomons for determining the time for sowing is being lost.)
Regarding the possibility that the gnomon was introduced into Borneo. Wikipedia (2014) will likely suffice for the possibility of diffusion from Sumatra or China: "According to ancient Chinese, Indian and Javanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium. In Chinese manuscripts, gold, camphor, tortoise shells, hornbill ivory, rhinoceros horn, crane crest, beeswax, lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick liana, Dalbergia parviflora), dragon's blood, rattan, edible bird's nests and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo. The Indians named Borneo Suvarnabhumi (the land of gold) and also Karpuradvipa (Camphor Island). The Javanese named Borneo Puradvipa, or Diamond Island. Archaeological findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving trading centre between India and China from the 500s until about 1300 AD."
Also worth a read (excusing the title) is: "Astronomical Lore of Observational Nature Possessed by the Vedic Aryans and Some Extremely Primitive African, Australian and South American Tribes: a Comparison." by Kailash Chandra Varma (Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Volume 61, Number 1/4, 1980, Pages 101-130).
Note: The most detailed modern study of the use of the gnomon for solstice measurement among modern Kenyah and Kayan is, Kayan Religion: Ritual Life and Religious Reform in Central Borneo by Jérôme Rousseau (1998). (See the (English-language) book review by Robert Winzeler in The Journal of Asian Studies, Volume 60, Issue 2, May, 2001, Pages 614-615.) The book is written with reference to the early 1970s, when most of the fieldwork was done. However, the Kayan were still living lives that were in many ways autonomous and traditional. It is basically an ethnography of Kayan belief and practice. The book includes photographs of the gnomon at Uma Bawang and associated activity. The use of the gnomon for determining the solstice and time for sowing per Carles Hose is confirmed. (The sowing day is the only one determined by astronomical method.) "Both in adat Dipuy and adat Bungan, a gnomon sets the time of the ceremonial sowing (Chapter VI). Only a few people know how to use it. The Chief has the authority over the gnomon, but he can delegate its observation to a knowledgeable person." (Kayan Religion: Ritual Life and Religious Reform in Central Borneo by Jérôme Rousseau (1998, Page 136. See also Pages 157-160). Rousseau (1998, Page 158) also confirms that: "A plumbline is attached to the gnomon so that it is vertical." (Jérôme Rousseau is an ethnologist/anthropologist who has spent a lot of time in Borneo. His qualifications include: B. Sc. (Anthropology) Université de Montréal, 1968; M.A. (Anthropology) Université de Montréal, 1969; Ph.D. (Anthropology) University of Cambridge, 1974. He is currently (2015) a Professor in the Department of Anthropology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. His doctoral dissertation was: The Social Organization of the Baluy Kayan.) At the spot where the gnomon is to be established "the ground is cleaned and levelled out; two plumblines ensure its vertical position. The length of the shadow is measured at noon every day. The gnomon is owned and controlled by the chief who decides when sowing is to take place. Uma Bawang's gnomon is seven centimetres thick and its tip is 154 centimetres from the ground. It can be placed in any convenient spot; in 1970 it was in front of the longhouse, in 1971, at the chief’s farmhouse. Only two persons knew how to use it: Avun (the religious leader) and Lake' Ngo Jok who had been a slave of the previous chief. The gnomon was set up in July 1971 without any ritual. (The summer solstice is on 21 or 22 June, from then on the length of the sun's shadow at noon gets shorter.)" (Kayan Religion: Ritual Life and Religious Reform in Central Borneo by Jérôme Rousseau (1998, Page 159).
Regarding gnomon use as a declining/disappearing skill. "In 1971, the people of Uma Bawang were unaware of their limited understanding of astronomy, but they very conscious of their imperfect knowledge in the use of the gnomon." (Jérôme Rousseau (1998, Page 160.) "The maren's [= high aristocrat/ruling estate] control over the gnomon is justified by taboo (parit): commoners may not manage the gnomon without the chief's permission." (Jérôme Rousseau (1998, Page 161.)
Excursus 1:
Mary Barnard, in a passage in her small book, Time and the White Tigress (1986), alluded to evidence of the high antiquity (Neolithic and Mesolithic) of attention to the solstice. I presume this is from the blurb to the



2022. 02. 21. 20:12 History of Constellation and Star Names
members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-24.html 22/22
hardcover edition: "Her years of research indicate that with simple tools such as rings, a forked stick, string, jugs of water, a stake, a piece of level ground, and a deep well the ancient astronomers could predict celestial movements (including the solstice and an eclipse)." Mary Barnard (1909-2001) was an American poet. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1932 from Reed College. Her book, Time and the White Tigress won the Western States Book Award in 1986. The 79-page book illustrated with linocuts is a book-length poem on the subjects of time and its measurement and mythology. In the, History of Astronomy: An Encyclopedia edited by John Lankford (1997), Barnard's book is described as fitting the "genre of astronomicalphilosophical poetry," and it was reviewed in The New York Times Book Review the year after its publication. The bibliography runs from pages 63 to 79. (I have her book, Mythmakers (1966) in my library. I would not deem it informative or reliable.)
Excursus 2:
The so-called Kalasasaya temple at Tiahuanaco is a very large sunken courtyard enclosed by a low wall. According to Rolf Müller who was an astronomer at the Postdam Observatory and between 1928 and 1929 made a study of the temple, it was constructed and used for observing the sun at the summer and winter solstices. (His results were published in 1931 in a 19-page pamphlet, Der Sonnentempel in den Ruinen von Tihuanacu : Versuch einer astronomischen Altersbestimmung.) The most recent orientation measurements were done by the astrophysicist Deterlino Urzagasti and published in 1997 (Astronomical character of Tiwanuku ruins : observation of the solar movement at the Kalasasaya temple. (Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicas, Universidad Mayor de San Andres)). Also, in Peru, the chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), son of a Spanish soldier and Inca noblewoman, mentioned the use of column erected in the middle of a square in front of sun temples, as a gnomon.

A section of the Dunhuang star chart (showing a polar projection (North circumpolar region)). (Used with the written permission of the British Library.) The Dunhuang Star Chart is a scroll 210 cm in length and 24.4 cm wide showing the sky between declinations 40° south to 40° north in 12 panels, plus a 13th panel showing the northern circumpolar sky. The Dunhuang Star Chart displays some 1345 (prominent) stars grouped into 257 asterisms. The width of the section shown above is approximately 24.4 cm and the length is

approximately 20 cm. The stars of Ursa Major, Sagittarius, and Capricornus are clearly recognisable. (Note the ball-and-link (point and line) convention to identify constellations/asterisms.) In China, constellation 'figures' (asterisms) were shown by simplified ball and link method circa 200 BCE or earlier. The Dunhuang star chart is recognised to have been made circa 649-684 CE by Li Chunfeng (whose life dates, 602-670, narrow the dating again). It was constructed with remarkable accuracy. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to the Tang period and was preserved as part of the Dunhuang Manuscripts. Classical Chinese astronomy is recorded in the Han period and appears in the form of three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the Zhanguo period. Later Chinese astronomy flourished during the Song Dynasty, and during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 CE) became increasingly influenced by medieval Islamic astronomy. The Dunhuang star chart is obviously the work of a professional map maker.
The Chinese developed their own system of constellations and these are quite different to the traditional Western system of constellations. The Chinese did not follow the Western tradition of grouping stars according to their brightness but rather grouped stars according to their location. Also, the Chinese formed their constellations from only a small number of stars. Basically, the Chinese sky (visible celestial sphere) was divided into asterisms, each asterism consisting of a few neighbouring stars. Some Chinese asterisms involve only 1 star. (A few (5) Chinese constellations were patterned in the same way as those used in Western Europe. These were: (1) the Great Bear, (2) Orion, (3) Auriga, (4) Corona Australis, and (5) the Southern Cross. The Chinese sky is intimately linked with the symbolism of the Middle Kingdom. The names of most of the some 300 Chinese asterisms refer to practical objects or persons. In The Silk Road (2004) edited by Susan Whitfield it is stated: "This very fine and detailed carving up of the sky was probably dictated by the need to provide accurate positions when precise coordinates were not available. The small size of most asterisms enables an event to be located with relative accuracy when only the name of the asterism is given."
The Chinese Dunhuang manuscript (named after the town on the Silk Road near where it was discovered) is, excluding astrolabes, the oldest existing portable star map known. (The oldest known manuscript star chart.) The document is divided into 2 different parts. The atlas itself comprises the 2nd part of a longer scroll. It is ink painted on (very) thin fine Chinese paper and is a scroll map (approximately 210 cm long and 24.4 cm wide) in 13 separate panels, of the northern heavens with divination text also attached. (The length of the entire scroll, inclusive of divination text at the end, is 394 cm (some sources have 330 cm). It is inscribed on one side only. There are small missing sections at the beginning and end of the scroll.) The first part of the scroll is a manual for divination based on the shape of clouds. This collection of predictions based on the shapes of clouds is evidence of the importance of uranomancy (divination by consulting the heavens) in China. The 12 charts showing different sections of the sky follow next. The stars are named and there is also explanatory text. The final chart depicts the north-polar region. The Dunhuang star chart overall is detailed, showing a total of 1345 stars in 257 clearly marked and named asterisms/constellations, including all 28 mansions. The positioning is very accurate for a hand-drawn document and compares agreeably to comparison with modern charts. The Dunhuang Star Chart was likely made by some highly educated scholar or a court astronomer. It was not an amateur work, but was professional for the time.
The chart includes very faint stars that are difficult to sight/observe with the naked eye.
The Dunhuang star chart is the oldest known manuscript star chart in the world. It is also the oldest existing Chinese star chart which depicts the whole of the sky visible in China. The star map is held in the British Museum (MS Stein 3326). It is believed to have been prepared in the Tang Dynasty (618-906 CE) It was dated to circa 940 CE by the Sinologist and science historian Joseph Needham (Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 3 (1959)). (The star map was largely ignored until dealt with by Joseph Needham in his Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 3 (1959 Certainly the earliest discussion of the astronomical context of the Dunhuang star map was by Joseph Needham.) It has since received considerable attention though Needham's dating is still frequently quoted.) A Chinese scholar later dated the manuscript to circa 705-710 CE. Two French astronomers, Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud of the Astrophysical Department of the French Atomic Energy Agency and Françoise Praderie of the Observatoire de Paris, have recently conducted a fresh analysis of the star chart and proposed an earlier date of circa 618 CE (the start of the Tang period) for the star chart being drawn. ("Star Charts on the Silk Road: Astronomical Maps in Ancient China." by Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud and Françoise Praderie in: The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith, edited by Susan Whitfield (2004), Pages 81-90). (Their current (2009) dating for when the Dunhuang star map was composed is 649-684 CE.)

The star chart was recovered from the Buddhist temple-caves near Dunhuang in (western) Gansu Province (China) by the Hungarian-born adventurer/explorer/archaeologist Aurel Stein (1862-1943). Dunhuang is an oasis town in Chinese Central Asia west of Xian, a former capital of China. It was the town where the two branches of the Silk Road rejoined for the final leg into the capital city of China. The town was founded in 111 BCE by Emperor Wudi (Han dynasty) to be 1 of 4 garrison commanderies to ensure Chinese control over the trade routes to the western regions. (During the Han Dynasty, 202 BCE - 220 CE, the commandery was the core unit of local governmental administration.) The region near Dunhuang has 492 caves (grottoes) comprising a Buddhist "holy site." (Over 480 caves are preserved.) These caves were cut into the rock of the cliff wall forming the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill from the 4th-century CE onwards, and decorated with religious carvings and paintings. The "cave site" was active from circa 360 CE to the end of the Mongol period in the 14th-century CE. The Dunhuang site was virtually ignored until a secret sealed-up cave was discovered at the end of the 19th-century. The "Cave for Preserving Scriptures" was discovered by a Taoist monk Wang Yuanlu in 1900. It contained documents and paintings from the 4th to the 11th centuries. Aurel Stein was the first outside person to gain access to this cave, in 1907.
Other astronomical documents found in the particular Dunhuang library cave were (1) a fragment of a circumpolar star map, and (2) an astrological compilation of the Chinese asterisms/constellations.
Aurel Stein spent most of his life in the service of the British Empire in India, became a naturalised British citizen, and was knighted for his services. Aurel Stein was born in 1862 in the city of Pest in Hungary. He took degrees in Sanskrit, Old Persian, and the emerging science of philology, at the universities of Vienna, Leipzig, and Tübingen. He received his PhD from Türbingen University on Old Persian and Indology. He was appointed as Principal of the Punjab University and Oriental College, Lahore. His most notable accomplishments involved exploring parts of Central Asia and Western China. Simon Winchester (2008) states Stein was recognised for being doughty, implacable, imperturbable, and case-hardened to any trials that might befall him on the road. Circa 1900 he had completed a 2-volume translation of the 12th-century Sanskrit work, the Rajatarangini. Stein was particularly interested in confirming his theories about the rich past of the Silk Road (a collection of trade routes across Central Asia connecting China and the Far East with the Mediterranean and the West). He was obsessed with understanding how Buddhism was carried (by migration) from India to China, and had become transformed in China. During the course of his second expedition, started in 1907, he uncovered and collected thousands of medieval manuscripts from the Caves of the One Thousand Buddhas (Mogao Grottoes) near Dunhuang. (In 1907 Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot bought over 9000 objects and manuscripts from a custodian monk at the caves, Wang Yuanlu.) One particular cave (Cave 17 (the cave number is also given as 16) contained a previously sealed library. The cave was reopened only a few years before the arrival of Aurel Stein in 1907. (This cave, which was crammed with approximately 40,000 ancient manuscripts and hand-copied ancient books (including the Dunhuang sky map), was accidentally discovered by a monk (likely Wang Yuanlu) in 1900 (or around this date.) Its entrance had been sealed and disguised (and is also described as a covered alcove). The manuscripts (mostly Buddhist religious texts) and artifacts are thought to have been sealed up and abandoned in 1000 CE (or around this date) due to persecution of Buddhists by the (Chinese) Hsi-Hsia kingdom to the north. The cave was apparently sealed to preserve its contents (and the dry climate ensured the preservation of the manuscripts). At this time Dunhuang was a desert outpost of China.) All the material from Cave 17 (16) dates prior to 1000 CE. (The Caves of the One Thousand Buddhas were carved by hand out of the rocks stretching for about 1,600 metres along the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill, approximately 25 kms southeast of Dunhuang. Numerous caves dot the hill face (cliff wall).) In 1907 Aurel Stein became the first foreigner to gain access to the secret archive in Cave 17. It contained documents and paintings dating from the 4th to the 11th centuries CE.
There are two seemingly conflicting versions of how Aurel Stein accessed the manuscripts from Cave 17 (16). In one version the removal of the scrolls and manuscripts in Cave 17 (16) was achieved by Stein gradually winning the confidence and trust of the Buddhist caretaker(s) (actually Taoist/Daoist caretaker monk). Another version states that at that time the Grottos were all but abandoned and the monk who found the hidden cache of manuscripts was selling manuscripts piece by piece to support himself and what was left of the monastery. (The details of one version are the Taoist/Daoist monk Wang Yuanlu discovered the "Cave for Preserving Scriptures" (i.e., Cave 17 (16)) in 1900, or the early 1900s.) (See: Appendix 2, below which is based on Chinese sources.) Approximately 14,000 scrolls, manuscripts, and fragments from Cave 17 (16) are now in the Stein Collection in the British Library. (Very little money was paid for these manuscripts.) Stein transported the thousands of manuscripts and artifacts to England and India on the backs of camels. Not

surprisingly Stein's collection methods have been much criticised and he has been described as a looter (plunderer). Other Western archaeologists who looted scrolls and manuscripts from the Dunhuang grottoes between 1906 and 1919 included Paul Pelliott and Sergei Oldenburg. (The French Orientalist Paul Pelliot (1878-1945), unlike Aural Stein, was a Chinese linguist. On his 1908 expedition to China this enabled him to carefully choose the manuscripts he purchased from the custodian monk(s) at Dunhuang.)
Between 1906 and 1919 the Dunhuang grottoes were looted by Aurel Stein, Paul Pelliot, Sergei Oldenburg, and other archaeologists. In the following years after Stein's recovery of material from Cave 17 ("Cave for Preserving Scriptures") a Japanese expedition arrived to claim a share, followed by a Russian one. In 19231924 (some sources state 1925-1926) the Harvard University archaeologist and art historian, Langdon Werner (1881-1955) visited and removed 26 of the Dunhuang cave frescoes/murals (comprising thin plaster sheets) and gave them to Harvard University, along with a pilfered sculpture.
The Dunhuang star chart shows over 1,350 (some sources state 1,345) stars grouped in 257 clusters or "asterisms." Most of the asterisms are labelled with their names. (Chinese constellations were smaller and more numerous than the Western constellations because they usually consisted of only 3-12 stars. This detailed division of the sky enabled provision of accurate positions when precise coordinates were not available.) The stars are depicted as large dots or small circles and the constellations ("asterisms") depicted by drawing lines to connect the large dots or small circles. The star chart includes faint stars that are difficult to see with the naked eye. The star chart is drawn up in thirteen sections. It is basically split into the twelve divisions of the Chinese year. Two different methods are used to display the stars on the maps. Method 1: A cylindrical projection method was used to draw the stars around the horizon. Twelve sections are flat maps centred on the celestial equator - these divisions according with the twelve stations of the planet Jupiter. (The twelve divisions of Jupiter are based on the twelve years it takes for the planet Jupiter move around the ecliptic and return to the same place among the stars.) Method 2: A circular polar projection method was used to draw the region around polaris. The other remaining section is a planisphere - a flat map centred on the north pole. (The above illustration shows the polar region of the sky.) In its method of projection the Dunhuang Star Map preempts by more than 600 years the work of the Flemish cartographer Gerhard Mercator. The Dunhuang star chart is somewhat imprecise in that it has no grid lines. Whilst not a precise scientific star atlas the Chinese sky is presented in a reasonably recognisable manner. (It has an accuracy that is considered surprising for a star chart from an early period.) The form of map projection used is a Mercator-like projection system similar to the system of map projection later developed in Europe in 1568 by Gerhardus Mercator (a Flemish mapmaker).
The origin and use of the Dunhuang star chart remains unknown. It is thought that the star chart is a reproduction of a much earlier version. Or, it may have been a reproduction of more than one earlier chart. (It is a Song Dynasty star map.) The first part of the Dunhuang Star chart consists of a collection of predictions based on shapes of clouds. The texts on cloud divination preceding the star charts support the idea that it was used for uranomancy (the divination of events by consulting the heavens). It is thought likely to have also had a military purpose (in calculating lucky or unlucky days for warfare on the basis of the positions of heavenly bodies). Why the map was at Dunhuang and not in an imperial archive is unresolved. It is thought that perhaps it could have been used also as a guide to travellers. Dunhuang was the last major resting place before starting on the journey on the north or south routes across the Taklamakan desert to the west.
Three different colours are used for the stars. This obviously follows Chinese tradition in distinguishing between the 3 ancient star catalogues composed prior to and during the Warring States period (circa 475-221 BCE).
The Dunhuang star chart is an example of the coloured star map of Qian Luozhi (Qian Lezhi). It gives a flat representation of Qian Luozhi's three-coloured traditional chart on the celestial globe (made 5th-century CE). Between 424 and 453 CE (during the Nan Dynasty) the Imperial Astronomer Qian Luozhi had a bronze celestial globe (planisphere) cast with the stars on it coloured in red, black, and white to distinguish the star listings of the three astronomers he had sourced. (The colours used had nothing to do with the observed colours of stars.) These were the first Chinese catalogues of star positions that were drawn up by the astronomers Shi Shen (Shih Shen or Shi Shi), Gan De (Kan Te or Gan Shi) , and Wu Xian (Wu Hsien or Wuxian Shi). (Shi Shen (Shih Shen or Shi Shi) listed 93 constellations; Gan De (Kan Te or Gan Shi) listed 118 constellations; and Wu Xian (Wu Hsien or Wuxian Shi) listed 44 constellations.) They created their own star maps for calendrical and astrological purposes. The positions of a number of stars were accurately

determined. The stars of Shi Shen were coloured red, the stars of Gan De were coloured black, and the stars of Wu Xian were coloured white. The use of colours was due to the belief that the three astronomers had each used different methods of astrological interpretation and that is was therefore necessary to know which system to apply. On the Dunhuang star chart the stars of Shi Shen were coloured yellow (not red), the stars of Gan De were coloured black, and the stars of Wu Xian were coloured white. (Wu Xian is actually a vague (probably legendary) figure from the Yin dynasty (said to be a Minister at the time of Emperor Da Wu) circa 1200 BCE. During the later Han period some astrologers began to write in the name of Wu Xian and this practice led to the emergence of a Wu Xian astronomical school.)
The Chinese had been creating star maps and star catalogs since at least the 5th-century BCE. The first Chinese star charts appeared during the Warring States period (circa 475-221 BCE). (The Warring States period was just prior to the unification of China under the first emperor Qin Shi Huang (or Shih Huang Ti) in 221 BCE.) The scientific and technological achievements of the Warring States period are immensely impressive. The various feudal states all had their own court astrologers/astronomers. Chinese astrologers/astronomers began to group the individual stars into constellations with each constellation having a symbolic significance. Shi Shen of the State of Wei and Gan De (possibly) of the State of Qi (Chu) coauthored The Gan and Shi Book of the Stars. In it they accurately recorded the positions (i.e., provided equatorial coordinates) of 120 (121?) stars. It is the world's earliest star chart. (This star catalogue also included the names of constellations and other stars that had not had their positions accurately recorded.)
The fixed star registers of the 3 astronomical schools were preserved in the Kaiyuan Zhanjing (Treatise on Astrology) of the Kaiyuan Period (729 CE) from the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE). (The earliest existing book to systematically describe the Chinese constellations was the Tianguan Shu (Monograph on Heavenly Officers) by Sima Qian (circa 145 BCE - 87 BCE). Some 90 constellations were mentioned including the 28 lunar mansions. Another feature was the Chinese sky was divided into 5 palaces.)
In the Han shu (the standard history of the Han dynasty, probably compiled by Ma Hsü sometime before 150 CE) there are 118 named constellations listed and 783 stars that are identified and placed within the five palaces of the heavens. There are indications that some Han Period writers identified β Ursae Minorus as being the Pole Star.
Circa 310 CE (immediately after the Han period) Chen Zhuo (Chhen Cho) (circa 230-320 CE), the Imperial Astronomer of the Wu State, and later the Jin court, (he lived during the Three Kingdoms (= Sanguo) period, and at the beginning of the Jin dynasty) constructed a map of the visible sky (stars and constellations) based on the astronomical schools of Shi Shen, Gan De, and Wu Xian. He combined (integrated/conflated) the three traditional star maps of Shi Shen, Gan De, and Wu Xian into a single system to form a new star catalogue of the visible sky. With additions included there were 1,464 stars and 283 (284?) constellations, and also included were an explanation and astrological commentary. Undoubtedly, in the combined star catalogue of Chen Zhou, the groups of constellations he attributed to one of the three astronomical schools his only his own chosen allocation. (It would be mistaken to believe that each of these groups of constellations were exclusively the constellations of each of the three astronomical schools used by Chen Zhou. There is no reason to suppose that each of the three astronomical schools did not take a comprehensive interest in the entire visible sky.) From this time on the new version of the Chinese sky provided by the scheme of Chen Zhou became established as the traditional Chinese sky. It was inherited by the Tang dynasty (618-907) astronomers and the Chinese sky became relatively fixed. No further significant changes occurred. Some stars were added, some star names were changed (the different star names introduced were actually synonyms), and the shapes of some constellations were changed into new groupings of stars. After the Tang dynasty the constellations were no longer distinguished according to which school they had belonged to. The later planisphere of Qian Luozhi agreed with this composite star chart constructed by Chen Zhou. (Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in Tang period records, notably by Qutan Xida.)
It would appear that most of the constellations of Gan De and Wu Xian were just fill-ins amongst the constellations listed by Shi Shen. Shi Shen's constellations were formed from the brightest stars in the sky. It has been commented that the constellations of Gan De and Wu Xian did not seem to exist in their own time but were later developments of star naming during the Han Period.

The French astronomers Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud and Françoise Praderie hold there is sufficient evidence to believe the Dunhuang star chart is based on traditional texts. (It is believed it may have been a reproduction of more than one earlier star chart.) Bonnet-Bidaud and Praderie point out that the information in the texts accompanying each section of the star chart is closely similar in style and content to the notations given in the astronomical text, the Yueling (Yūeh Ling) (Monthly Ordinances, a royal ritual calendar) dating to circa 300 BCE.
Professor Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud and Professor Françoise Praderie have been researching the Dunhuang Star chart for over 5 years. They have recently (2009) published a comprehensive paper on the results of their studies in the Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage. (Bonnet-Bidaud, Jean-Marc., Praderie, Françoise. and Whitfield, Susan. (2009). "The Dunhuang chinese sky: a comprehensive study of the oldest known star atlas." (Journal of Astronomical history and Heritage, Volume 12, Number 1, March, Pages 3959). [Note: The 19 page paper also has 5 Tables and 8 Figures. Françoise Praderie died in early 2009.]) They have identified over 3000 stars on the chart. The chart includes very faint stars that are difficult to sight/observe with the naked eye. The Dunhuang star chart has an overall accuracy that is considered surprising for a star chart from this early period.
Several other major Dunhuang astronomical documents are (1) a fragment of a circumpolar star map, (2) an astrological compilation of the Chinese constellations, and (3) calendars.
Appendix 1: Dunhuang
The city of Dunhuang is sited at an oasis and is located near the historic junction of the northern and southern Silk Roads. It was a major point of interchange between China and the West. It also had military importance. The Buddhist monks occupying the area up to circa 1000 BCE and the stream of pilgrims constantly passing through the area painted murals inside the Caves of the One Thousand Buddhas (Mogao Grottoes).
Appendix 2: Wang Yuanlu
The (self-appointed) care taker at Dunhuang was Wang Yuanlu was an itinerant Chinese Taoist/Daoist monk from Shanxi Province. He had arrived at the Dunhuang Buddhist cave complex in the 1890s, made it his home, and became an unofficial guardian of the caves. To accomplish this he went on fundraising tours to raise money to restore the statues. In 1900, while clearing sand from Cave 16, his workmen accidentally discovered a hidden door which led into a small cave (alcove) filled with ancient documents and paintings dating from the 4th to 11th centuries CE. This cave is now numbered Cave 17 and is also known as the Library Cave. (It was originally constructed as a memorial cave for a local monk on his death in the 9th century. The documents and painting were found covered in an alcove in this memorial cave. (?))
The full significance of the library cave's contents was not immediately recognised in China even after Wang Yuanlu made repeated attempts over the years (some 3 attempts in 5-6 years) to report its discovery to officials. Finally, in 1904, the provincial government ordered those at Dunhuang to take measures to protect the manuscripts. This measure only involved delegating responsibility rather than initiating action.
When Stein and Pelliot visited Dunhuang in 1907 and 1908 respectively they were therefore able to persuade Wang Yuanlu to part with large numbers of the manuscripts and paintings for a small reimbursement. The details of the transaction was duly noted by Wang Yuanlu. Acting as interpreter, secretary and companion on Aurel Stein's second expedition, 1906–8, was Jiang Xiaowan (Jiang Siye, died 1922). Originally from Hunan he had been posted to Xinjiang in 1883. Jiang Xiaowa had served previously as a private secretary to government officials and had the experience that Stein required for his exploratory expedition. He first met Stein in May 1906 the two immediately became friends. Jiang Xiaowan taught Aurel Stein colloquial Chinese during the expedition and was instrumental in persuading Wang Yuanlu to allow Stein and himself to access Dunhuang.
Later, the Chinese scholar Luo Zhenyu heard that more than 8,000 manuscripts remained in the library cave. Realising that if the manuscripts were not quickly brought to Beijing, they might disappear completely he and other Chinese scholars made concerted efforts to achieve such. This culminated in the Ministry of Education issuing a government directive for recovering the remaining manuscripts. Fu Baoshu was appointed to arranged transport of the remaining manuscripts from Dunhuang to Beijing. However, he left

the Tibetan manuscripts at Dunhuang. It appears some manuscripts were stolen from the Ministry of Education by Li Shengduo, after the manuscripts reached the Ministry. Soon after these occurrences the 1911 revolution led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, leaving the Chinese government too preoccupied to worry about the Dunhuang manuscripts. After several diversionary episodes they finally reached the Metropolitan Library in Beijing. There were 8,697 manuscripts from Dunhuang, and these still constitute the main part of the Dunhuang materials at the National Library of China.
Appendix 3: Some Early Chinese Star Maps
(1) Star map/catalogue by Wu Xian (created circa 1200-1000 BCE) but perhaps mythical for this time. (The life dates for Wu Xian (Wuxian) are uncertain and there is the possibility he may even have been fictional.) This was a partial (northern) sky star map apparently containing 44 central and outer constellations and a total of 141 stars.
(2) Star map/catalogue by Gan/Ghan De (created between circa 475-221 BCE, Warring States period). This was a partial (northern) sky star map possibly containing 75 central constellations and 42 outer constellations (= 117 constellations). (Some sources though state 510 stars in 118 constellations).
(3) Star map/catalogue by Shi Shen (created circa 350 BCE). This was a relatively comprehensive (northern) sky star map apparently containing 138 constellations, 810 star names, and the locations of 121 stars. (According to some sources it contained the 28 lunar ecliptic constellations/asterisms, 62 central constellations, and 30 outer constellations.) However, we have no record of the brightness of the stars, which has made complete identification difficult.
(4) The book Tianguan Shu (Monograph on Heavenly Officers) by Sima Qian (lived circa 145 BCE - 87 BCE) was the earliest book to describe the Chinese constellations. Some 90 constellations (500 stars) were mentioned, including the 28 lunar mansions.
(5) Star map/catalogue by Chen Zhuo (created circa 270 CE). This was a whole (northern) sky star map whose contents were a unified constellation system (integrating the records of Shi Shen, Gan/Ghan De, and Wu Xian) containing 1464 stars in 284(283?) constellations. After Chen Zhuo's time there were no later additions (or substantial later additions) to the scheme of Chinese constellations, although some of the existing ones were modified. Chen Zhuo's original catalogue was lost some time in the 6th-century CE. This combined set of asterisms/constellations remained in use in China until the early 17th-century, when Western constellations were introduced and replaced them. Additional to these star groupings, and predating them, were 28 ancient divisions known as xiu (or hsiu), or lodges/mansions. These comprised a system of vertical strips of sky acting as markers for following the monthly movement of the Moon, a 'lunar zodiac,' thus providing the basis for a lunar calendar.
(6) Planetarium/star map by Qian Luozhi (Qian Lezhi) (created circa 443 CE, Nan Dynasty). This whole (northern) sky planetarium/star map used red, black, and white to differentiate stars from the different star maps of Wu Xian, Gan/Ghan De, and Shi Shen.
(7) The Dunhuang star map/catalogue (created circa 705-710 CE). It is an example of the coloured star map of Qian Luozhi (Qian Lezhi). The oldest star map found so far is this example from Dunhuang. Earlier thought to date from about 940 CE (by Joseph Needham), and then 705-710 CE (by Jean-Marc BonnetBidaud and Françoise Praderie). It is now recognised to have been made about 649-684 CE by the astronomer and mathematician Li Chunfeng (whose life dates, 602-670, narrow the dating again). It was made with precise mathematical methods and shows 1339 stars in 257 Chinese star groups with a precision between 1.5 and 4 degrees of arc. In all there are 12 charts each in 30 degree sections displaying the full sky visible from the Northern hemisphere. Up to now it is the oldest complete preserved star atlas discovered from any civilisation. Li Chunfeng was a major Feng shui scholar of the Tang Dynasty and a mathematician, astronomer, and historian. He was first appointed to the Imperial Astronomy Bureau to help institute calendar reform. He eventually ascended to become deputy of the Imperial Astronomy Bureau and designed the Linde calendar. Astronomy was important subject in ancient Chinese history not only as a scientific theory, but also as an essential part of a general theory of hermeneutics. Scholars interpreted constellations and celestial movements, which informed a framework within which events, in daily life or of historical significance, are interpreted. Astronomy was also tied to ideas of the Mandate of Heaven and Feng shui, which reached their

maturity during the in Tang Dynasty. Li Chunfeng was a major theorist who contributed to the development of Feng shui theories.
(8) Suzhou (previously transliterated as Soochow, Su-chou, and Suchow) planisphere/star map by Huang Shang (created 1193 CE). This was a whole (northern) sky chart depicting the sky visible from central China (approximately 35 degrees north latitude). The Suzhou planisphere depicts the sky from the north celestial pole to about 55 degrees south. The inscription accompanying the chart states there are 283 asterisms and 1565 stars. All 1464 stars from Chen Zhuo's catalogue are supposedly included. There are, however, 313 asterisms and only 1440 stars displayed on it. (It has been pointed out that not all of the stars show up on the rubbing.) Chinese astronomy traditionally had 283 constellations and 1464 stars. Radiating lines, like irregular spokes, demarcate the 28 xiu. These lines extend from the southern horizon (the rim of the chart) to a circle roughly 35 degrees from the north celestial pole; within this circle lie the circumpolar constellations, i.e. those that never set as seen from the latitude of observation. The Suzhou planisphere provides a more complete representation of the Chinese sky than the Dunhuang star map. This chart was engraved on stone in 1247 but is a copy of an earlier drawing created circa 1193. Reproductions of the engraving are taken from an ink-on-paper rubbing, as a result, the stars and lines appear white on a black background. Two intersecting circles represent the celestial equator and ecliptic, which the Chinese called the Red Road and the Yellow Road respectively. An irregular band running across the chart outlines the Milky Way, called the River of Heaven. The dividing rift through Cygnus can also be made out.
An Ancient Chinese Star Chart in Ancient Japan
The famous Kitora Tomb Star Chart in Japan is claimed to be the oldest in the world. It is presently the the oldest known star map in Northeast Asia. The tomb is located near the ancient Asuka village in Japan's Nara Prefecture. The tomb was discovered in 1983. It is believed to have held the remains of a bureaucratic official or prince during the reign of Emperor Tenmu (672-686). Kitora Tomb, which is considered a tumulus – otherwise known as a barrow or burial ground – was covered with an exterior mound of dirt and stone. A small stone chamber, the Kitora Tomb is a little over 1 metre in height and width and about 2.4 metres long, just large enough to bury a single person. The star chart was discovered later in 1998. The star chart in the Kitora Tomb was discovered when the interior of the tomb was filmed/photographed with a sub-miniature camera without actually opening the tomb itself. The astronomical map painted on the ceiling - along with other depictions - are murals painted on plaster. The building of the Kitora Tomb is dated sometime between the end of the 7th-century CE and the beginning of the 8th-century CE. However, there is the argument that evidently, the chart was created before the Kitora Tomb itself. Perhaps several hundred years earlier. It has been speculated that the celestial chart on the tomb ceiling was made in China sometime between 80 BCE and 400 CE. (Astronomical analysis of the star chat supports this conclusion.) The dating fits within the Han period when methodologies for such sky charts were being developed. There is another argument that it was made in Korea. Descriptions of the chart include it has 4 celestial circles depicting the horizon, ecliptic, equatorial and an inner circle (circumpolar circle in the centre) marking the declination limit for permanently visible stars, and some 350 stars depicted on the astronomical chart using gold foil circles. These stars are connected with lines forming 68 constellations. The pole star is at the centre. The Kitora star map depicts all the constellations except those near the South Pole, as well as the sun and the moon and the 4 directional animals. In addition, the 12 zodiac animal-headed figures (Sinicized form) with human body are painted on the wall, which may be one of the oldest remaining zodiac murals in East Asia. Some of the names of the constellations depicted have been identified. By inference the star chart placed on the ceiling of the Japanese Kitora tomb is earlier than the Chinese Dunhuang manuscript star chart. It was developed earlier. Analysis of the configuration of the star chart also verifies this. The tomb contains paintings of the 4 cardinal animals of Chinese lore: the black tortoise of the north, the white tiger of the west, the red phoenix of the south, the blue dragon of the east. The tomb paintings have deteriorated over time but restoration efforts have been implemented.
Appendix 4: Later Sky Maps
Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) the scholar Xu Guang-Qi (Xu Guangqi), when editing the book Chong Zhen Reign-Period Treatise on Calendrical Science introduced 23 new southern sky asterisms (based on knowledge of European star catalogues) situated in the region of the celestial south pole. These asterisms have since been incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps. There are: Sea and mountain, Cross, Horse's tail, Horse's abdomen, Bee, Triangle, Exotic bird, Peacock, Persia, Snake's tail,

Snake's abdomen, Snake's head, Bird's beak, Crane, Firebird, Crooked running water, White patches nearby, White patch attached, Goldfish, Sea rock, Flying fish, Southern boat, and Little dipper. The accepted standard for traditional Chinese star mapping is the revised and corrected star catalogue (completed in the Qing Dynasty by Dai Jin-Xian and Liu Song-Ling) in Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments.
Appendix 5: Equator and Ecliptic
During the later Han period (circa 1st- or 2nd-century CE) Chinese astronomers gave a name to the ecliptic as well as to the celestial equator. The title of the ecliptic was the Yellow Road (hoang-tao) and the title of the celestial equator was the Red Road. This particular naming practice may simply have had its origins in the particular coloured lines drawn on star maps during the Han period, to indicate the ecliptic and celestial equator.
The Ch'ih tao i (Instrument of the Red Path, or Equatorial Instrument) was developed by Keng Shou-ch'ang circa 55 BCE. The Huang tao i (Instrument of the Yellow Path, or Ecliptical Instrument) was developed by Chia K'uei in 102 CE.
Appendix 6: Identifying the Ancient Chinese Asterisms/Constellations
Chinese constellations were symbolic, rather than pictorial. Also, usually their member stars were not precisely identified and so changes could – and did – occur over time. The result is there is considerable variation in the depiction and interpretation of Chinese constellations from different eras. Until the completion of recent dedicated efforts by Chinese historians these differences remained confusing and frustrating for persons trying to reconstruct the standard Chinese sky. An additional difficulty for the identification of the standard Chinese sky is Chinese astronomers did not develop and use any system – such as the sizes of the individual dots on their charts - to indicate the magnitudes of the stars. The absence of interest in star magnitudes is characteristic of all Chinese (and Korean) star charts. It perhaps indicates they were primarily for use by astrologers, rather than strictly scientific purposes.
Appendix 7: Aurel Stein and the Dunhuang Caves
The single greatest discovery made by the Hungarian-British explorer Aurel Stein was at Dunhuang in 1907. During his 2nd expedition Stein had focused on the recovery of lost languages and documents in this area of the desert. He was also prompted by the threat of other competition by other European exploration teams (i.e., the French). Aurel Stein was described by Simon Winchester (2008) as unstoppably curious, scrupulous, small, tough, and very attentive to detail. Stein died in October 1943 in Kabul, aged 81, after a brief but severe illness, whilst on another expedition of discovery (a collecting expedition for the British Museum). Stein was a dedicated scholar and explorer. His capacity for years of travel in virtual solitude were shaped by the habit of solitude in his youth. On all 3 major expeditions to Eurasia, Stein used the topographical information by the 7th-century CE Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang. Stein was greatly influenced by the early travels of Xuanzang. He literally followed in the path of this Chinese Buddhist monk (especially through the Taklamakan Desert (Desert of Death). In this desert temperatures varied between +130°F and -10°F; sand dunes - comprising soft sand - were up to 300 metres high. Stein's expeditions were financed by the British government.
Abbot Wang Yuanlu (circa 1849-1931) (also known as Wang daoshi (i.e., priest/monk) or Wang Tao-shih) is described as a Taoist priest. He was Abbot of the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang during the early 20th-century. He is also described as a self-styled Taoist priest and a self-appointed guardian/caretaker of the Dunhuang cave complex (nobody else was looking after them). Wang Yuanlu is credited with the discovery of the Dunhuang manuscripts. In 1900 Wang Yuanlu had found in one of the caves a hidden chamber stacked to the ceiling with ancient manuscripts and silk paintings. When engaging in amateur restoration work of statues and paintings in what is now known as Cave 16, Wang Yuanlu noticed what appeared to be a hidden doorway and had it broken open. The doorway opened into another cave, later named Cave 17 or the "Library Cave." In Cave 17 he found the as yet undiscovered cache of thousands of ancient manuscripts, many of which related to early Chinese Buddhism. According to one source Wang Yuanlu had sealed up the Mogao caves at Dunhuang.
He reported the existence of the manuscripts in the so-called "Library Cave" to the local Chinese officials, in an attempt to gain funding for their conservation. The officials ordered him to reseal the cave, in preparation

for their transportation, preservation and study. No transport could be readily/immediately organised to move the contents to a nearby city for safekeeping. However, Wang Yuanlu would also later sell numerous manuscripts to archaeologists/explorers. He was resident at the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang, taking care of the Buddhist temple complex when Aurel Stein visited the site in the autumn of 1907. Stein had heard there were valuable documents at Dunhuang.
After a difficult journey from Kashmir through the sand deserts of Turkestan and the Lop Desert of China Stein arrived at Mogao and the caves in late March 1907. In May 1907 Wang Yuanlu reopened Cave 17 after persuasion by Stein when he learned about the documents stored there. Stein also hoped the documents would solve how Buddhism had come to China. After he accessed the contents of so-called Cave 17, Stein then convinced Wang Yuanlu to part with tens of thousands of scrolls in exchange for a modest donation towards the restoration of the temples. (Wang Yuanlu was not aware of Stein's intentions or the value of the documents.) Both Wang Yaunlu and Aurel Stein were admirers of the 7th-century CE Chinese monk Xuanzang. Xuanzang composed the Datang-Xiyu-Ji ("Records of the Western Regions of the Great Tang Dynasty"), the detailed record of the various countries he passed through during his 16-17 year round-trip journey to India and return to China. Stein took a largely random selection of the document and other artifacts. The sale of the Dunhuang manuscripts to Aurel Stein was concluded for a fraction of their value. (Stein misled Wang Yuanlu over the scrolls.) The result of Stein's bargaining with Wang Yuanlu was that for 220 British Pounds (₤220 in 1907) Stein obtained what would be 24 wagonloads of documents and objects. Stein had negotiated 4 silver horseshoes for a vast amount of documents. The documents were written in Sanskrit, Manichean, Turkish, Runic, Turkic, Uighur, Tibetan, Sogdian, Central Asian Brahmi, and classical Chinese.
Only a few months later the French sinologist Paul Pelliot arrived at Dunhuang and was able to acquire another sizeable collection of manuscripts and artifacts, which was, on account of his competence as a sinologist, in many ways superior to that obtained by Stein. Pelliot purchased what may be considered the most valuable among them. Later came the Japanese and even later the Russian expeditions, each obtaining further collections of manuscripts.
Wang Yuanlu engaged in the restoration of the site funded by the proceeds of the sale of numerous manuscripts and other artifacts to Western and Japanese archaeologists/explorers.
The Hungarian-born Aurel Stein became fascinated with Eurasia in his early youth. He later studied ancient languages and obtained a PhD in Oriental languages. He was expert in Sanskrit. After his employment by the British his home base was Lahore. He was fascinated by clear evidence of ancient Greek influences in Pakistan. Whilst based in Lahore his experience with the British army taught him how to survey and make maps. He was also a highly skilled desert navigator. Stein picked up malaria on his 1907 expedition (his 2nd expedition).
Stein published descriptions of everything he found. The Dunhuang scrolls made his reputation. He received a knighthood for his discoveries. His reputation as an archaeological looter would haunt him until the end of his life.

Late imaginary portrait of the Greek astronomer Hipparchus (born) Nicaea(/(died) Rhodes) (circa 190 to 120 BCE).
Hipparchus of (born) Nicaea(/(died) Rhodes) (circa 190 to 120 BCE) was a Greek astronomer and mathematician of major importance who made fundamental contributions to the advancement of astronomy as a mathematical science and to the foundations of trigonometry. Much of Hipparchus' work was concerned with the fixed stars. The chronological order of Hipparchus' work is uncertain. Hipparchus was not only the likely founder of trigonometry but also the person who transformed Greek astronomy from a purely theoretical into a practical, predictive science. Commonly ranked as one of the greatest scientists of antiquity. Very little is known about his life, but he is known to have been born in Nicaea in Bithynia (in northwestern Asia Minor). Only one of his numerous writings is still in existence. Most of the knowledge of the rest of his work relies on 2nd-hand reports, especially in the Almagest by Ptolemy (2nd-century CE).
It is indicated that Hipparchus began his scientific career in Bithynia and moved to Rhodes some time before 141 BCE. While still young, Hipparchus compiled records of local weather patterns throughout the year. It is probable that Hipparchus spent the whole of his later career at Rhodes. Hipparchus' many important and lasting contributions to astronomy included practical and well as theoretical innovations. He made an early contribution to trigonometry producing a table of chords, an early example of a trigonometric table. Given the chord function, Hipparchus could solve any plane triangle by using the equivalent of the modern sine formula. In Greek astronomy most problems arising from computations of the positions of the heavenly bodies were either problems in plane trigonometry or could be reduced to such by replacing the small spherical triangles involved by plane triangles. Hipparchus also attempted to precisely measure the length of the tropical year (the period for the Sun to complete one passage through the ecliptic). He calculated the length of the year to within 6.5 minutes and discovered the precession of the equinoxes, which is due to the slow change in direction of the axis of rotation of the earth. This work came from Hipparchus' attempts to calculate the length of the year with a high degree of accuracy. Hipparchus' most important astronomical work concerned solar and lunar theory, the orbits of the Sun and Moon, a determination of their sizes and distances from the Earth, and the study of eclipses. Hipparchus analysed the complicated motion of the Moon in order to construct a theory of eclipses. In order to eliminate most of the contradictions of the geocentric model he used and perfected the geometrical models, including the deferent-epicycle and eccentric previously used by Apollonius of Perga (flourished circa 200 BCE). One of Hipparchus' contributions appears to have been the incorporation of numerical data based on observations into the geometrical models developed to account for the astronomical motions. Hipparchus is considered the greatest astronomer of antiquity, as his reputed achievements include the discovery of the precession, precise observations of the lunar and solar motions, and possibly the invention of the astrolabe. During his century, armillary spheres appeared for the first time, but the credit of a construction by him is not confirmed. He could have used one armillary sphere during the creation of the star catalogue. Much of the astronomical work started by Hipparchus has had a long lasting heritage, and was updated by many others like Ptolemy (AD 150), Al Sufi (964), Ulugh Beg (1437) and Copernicus (1543). Hipparchus constructed the first celestial globe on record, but it is believed other celestial globes had existed before it.
Hipparchus made use of Babylonian astronomical material, including methods/procedures as well as observations. Gerald Toomer has argued that Hipparchus was responsible for the direct transmission of both Babylonian observations and procedures and for the successful synthesis of Babylonian and Greek astronomy. The discovery of Hipparchus' dependence on Babylonian sources raises the question of what material was available to him, and in what form. The Babylonian astronomical material must have been excerpted and translated by someone in Mesopotamia who was well acquainted with Babylonian astronomical methods. When and how the transmission occurred is unknown. Hipparchus is the first Greek known to have used the highly technical Babylonian astronomical material comprising the lunar and planetary ephemerides. Without it his lunar theory, and hence his eclipse theory, would not have been possible. Ptolemy states in the Almagest) that Hipparchus renounced any attempt to devise a theory to explain the motions of the 5 planets.
Hipparchus is also credited with the production of the first known catalogue of fixed stars (and Catasterisms). Late in his life (possibly about 135 BCE) Hipparchus compiled his star catalog comprising at least 850 stars, the original of which does not survive. The first catalogue of stars over the entire visible sky probably originated with the Greek astronomer Hipparchus circa 130 BCE. One of the great achievements of Hipparchus was his (now lost) Catalogue of fixed stars. This star catalogue differed from the earlier and

imprecise descriptions of the constellations. Celestial coordinates were given for the 850 stars. According to some science historians Hipparchus made a catalogue of the sky providing the positions of 1080 stars by stating their precise celestial latitude and longitude. However, the number is thought to be approximately 850. The first Greek catalogue of stars giving accurate positions (coordinates) for single stars was by Hipparchus (2nd-century BCE). It contained some 850 stars. The next star catalogue was by Ptolemy (included as part of his Almagest) 2nd-century CE. It was a larger and improved star catalogue than Hipparchus' Catalogue of stars (having more exact coordinates). In his star catalogue, Ptolemy listed 1,028 stars/objects forming the classical 48 constellations. The star catalogue in Ptolemy's Almagest is the only extent star catalogue from ancient Greece. Hipparchus' Catalogue of stars has not survived as an independent work. It is thought likely that a substantial part of it is preserved in the large number of observational data (stellar coordinates) of his Commentary on Aratus. Hipparchus' Commentary contains many stellar positions and times for rising, culmination, and setting of the constellations.
To compile his star catalogue Hipparchus apparently used an equatorial armillary sphere to measure the exact ecliptical coordinates (i.e., ecliptic latitude (angular distance from the ecliptic plane) and ecliptic longitude (angular distance from an arbitrary point i.e., the vernal equinox)) of approximately 850 stars. However, it is clear that at the time of Hipparchus a standardised system of spherical coordinates for denoting stellar positions did not exist. In the material that has survived Hipparchus does not use a single consistent coordinate system to denote stellar positions. He inconsistently uses several different coordinate systems, including an equatorial coordinate system (i.e., declinations) and an ecliptic coordinate system (i.e., latitudes and longitudes). He used declinations for about half of the 850 stars he catalogued. (In his Commentary, obviously written before his discovery of precession, the positions of stars, when given, are in a mixed ecliptic-declination system.) In his Commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus, Hipparchus largely chose to write at the same qualitative (i.e., descriptive) level as the two authors he critiqued. Only later, obviously after his discovery of precession, did he introduce a system of real ecliptic coordinates where the positions of stars are given in their latitude and longitude (and longitudes increase proportionally with time whilst latitudes remain unchanged). Hipparchus, in his Commentary, attributed Aratus' Phainomena to the earlier Phainomena of Eudoxus. He reached this conclusion after a detailed comparison of both texts. It has been suggested that Eudoxus' Phainomena is a revision of his earlier Enoptron.
Hipparchus' Commentary on Aratus and Eudoxus contains some information on his observations of star positions, which were the basis of his star catalog. A record of Hipparchus' star catalog is contained in Ptolemy's Almagest. Hipparchus' star catalog was adopted and perhaps expanded by Ptolemy. It has been long disputed whether the star catalog in Ptolemy's Almagest is based on Hipparchus' star catalog. Between 1976 and 2002 the work (by astronomers and historians, comprising statistical and spatial analyses) by Robert Newton, Dennis Rawlins, Gerd Graßhoff, Keith Pickering, and Dennis Duke have shown conclusively that the star catalog in the Almagest is almost entirely that of Hipparchus.
Over 150 years after Timocharis and Aristillus the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus compiled his own star catalogue. By comparison to Timocharis' catalogue, he discovered the precession of the equinoxes. Hipparchus' interest for the catalogue may have been inspired by his observation of a new bright star (supernova) not noticed before. Hipparchus mapped and recorded 850 stars with entries of latitude and longitude relative to the ecliptic. This catalogue was lost during the Middle Ages, but Hipparchus' work was incorporated in the Almagest by Ptolemy. Of the 14 books by Hipparchus, the only surviving work is a critical commentary on Aratus' Phaenomena which provides us an indirect link to Eudoxus.
The Western tradition of describing the constellations by means of describing the relative positions of the stars within the constellation figures was firmly established by Eratosthenes and Hipparchus. Hipparchus introduced the system of assigning Greek letters to identify the magnitudes (brightness) of the naked-eye stars in each constellation. Hipparchus divided the stars into categories representing their different magnitudes. Hipparchus arranged the brightnesses of stars in 6 classes, a system that we basically use today. Hipparchus' system of designating stellar magnitude was adopted by Claudius Ptolemy.
Approximately 300 years after Hipparchus, Ptolemy compiled a star catalogue - likely by adding about 170 additional stars to the 850 in the star catalogue compiled by Hipparchus. Before Hipparchus and Ptolemy Greek astronomy focused on constellation figures rather than star positions. The development of a system of coordinates to enable the positions of individual stars to be located accurately was first achieved in Greece; but only after undergoing considerable evolvement. The fixed stars were first located only in very vague

terms. In the Works and Days of Hesiod (circa 7th-century BCE) there exists only the most rudimentary system for identifying particular stars and where to find them in the sky. A first attempt at an exact coordinate system for locating particular stars was not to occur until some 500 years later with the star catalogue of Hipparchus. In the 2nd-century BCE Hipparchus originated a star catalogue in which also he tried to give some reasonably accurate locational coordinates for the stars he listed. However, the coordinate system he used to locate the positions of the stars on his list remains unknown.
The only work by Hipparchus which has survived is his Commentary on the Phaenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus written in 3 books as a commentary on 3 different writings. Firstly, the treatise by Eudoxus on in the names and descriptions of the Greek constellations. Secondly, the astronomical poem Phaenomena by Aratus which was based on the constellation treatise by Eudoxus. Thirdly, the commentary on Aratus by Attalus of Rhodes, written shortly before the time of Hipparchus.
The 3 centuries of astronomical research between Hipparchus and Ptolemy are almost completely unknown.

Greek manuscript of Ptolemy's Almagest in the Vatican Library. Dated to the 9th-century CE it is considered the oldest and most elegant of all the manuscripts of the Almagest. The pages show Book IV Chapter 2, on Hipparchus's examination of Babylonian cycles for the motion of the moon. The basis of Western astronomy as taught during Late Antiquity and until the Early Modern period is the Almagest by Ptolemy, written in the 2nd-century CE.
Ptolemy's Almagest devotes 2 chapters to the fixed stars. The total number of stars listed in his star catalogue is 1022. The most important of these are the 14 stars frequently used used by Ptolemy as fundamental reference stars. The term "cloudy stars" is first found in the Almagest of Ptolemy, but each of the 5 objects so named by him, nebulous to the eye, are coarse clusters of stars. Their nature was unknown until the invention of the telescope.
Claudius Ptolemy was born circa 85 CE in Egypt and died circa 165 in Alexandria in Egypt. He made his astronomical observations between circa 127 CE and 141 CE. Ptolemy was one of the most influential Greek astronomers and geographers of his time. However, very little is actually known of his life. His name, Claudius Ptolemy, combines a mix of the Greek Egyptian "Ptolemy" and the Roman "Claudius."
All of Ptolemy's major works have survived. The original Greek title of his most important work was The Mathematical Compilation (or The Great System of Astronomy) (but is now known by its popularised short Arabic title Almagest). The book was originally called Syntaxis by Ptolemy. Ptolemy's original Greek title was soon replaced by another Greek title The Greatest Compilation. Its commonly known title Almagest originates from its translation into Arabic as "al-majisti." (When Gherardo of Cremona translated the Arabic version of Ptolemy's work into Latin from the Arabic, in 1175, the al-Magisti become known as Almagest.) This thirteen book work, mostly concerned with presenting his original detailed geometric mathematical theory of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets, was his earliest and marks the high-point of Greek (Alexandrine) astronomy.

The first account of all 48 classical constellations was made by Eudoxus of Cnidos (circa 390-340 BCE). Poetic descriptions followed, such as Aratus' Phaenomena, the Catasterisms falsely ascribed to Eratosthenes of Cyrene (circa 275-194 BCE), the Poetica astronomica of Hyginus (2nd-century CE), derivative versions by Marcus Manilius (early 1st-century CE), Germanicus (early 1st-century CE) and Rufius Festus Avienus (4th-century CE), and also more scientific catalogue lists by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. Pseudo-Eratosthenes gave each constellation a mythological identity. These poetic/poetic-based works inclined towards "the transformation of the firmament into a rendezvous of mythological figures."
The earliest Western star catalogue (as we understand the term) originated with Ptolemy. The culmination of Greek establishment of constellation (and star) names was contained in (Book VII and Book VIII) of Ptolemy's Almagest written circa 140 CE. In it Ptolemy listed 1025 (fixed) stars. (The Almagest contained no star maps.) For his star catalogue Ptolemy used one system of coordinates (ecliptic longitudes and latitudes) for all the stars listed in it. Ptolemy did not identify the stars in his catalogue with Greek letters, as is done by modern astronomers. Each of the 1025 stars listed was identified (1) descriptively by its position within one of the 48 constellation figures; then (2) by its ecliptic latitude and longitude; and then (3) its magnitude. (Stars that did not fit into the figure of a constellation were sated to be outside the constellation and their position described in terms of their relationship to the nearest constellated stars.) It is this particular star catalogue method of Ptolemy that enables us to identify, with considerable exactness, the boundaries (i.e., shape) of the ancient Greek constellations. The identities of some of the stars in Ptolemy's list still remain completely uncertain due to errors in Ptolemy's measured coordinates and lack of precision in described positions.
The constellation list in Ptolemy's star catalogue standardised the Western constellation scheme. Ptolemy's Almagest remained the standard definition of constellations in the medieval period both in Europe and in Islamic astronomy. The constellation scheme described by Ptolemy consisted of 21 northern constellations, 12 zodiacal constellations, and 15 southern constellations.
The northern constellations: (1) Little Bear, (2) Great Bear, (3) Dragon [Draco], (4) Cepheus, (5) Ploughman, (6) Northern Crown, (7) Kneeler [Hercules], (8) Lyre, (9) Bird [Cygnus], (10) Cassiopeia, (11) Perseus, (12) Charioteer (Auriga], (13) Serpent Holder, (14) Serpent [Serpens], (15) Arrow, (16) Eagle, (17) Dolphin, (18) Forepart of Horse [Equuleus], (19) Horse, (20) Andromeda, (21) Triangle.
The zodiacal constellations: (1) Ram, (2) Bull, (3) Twins, (4) Crab, (5) Lion, (6) Virgin, (7) Scales [Claws], (8) Scorpion, (9) Archer, (10) Goat-horned, (11) Water-pourer, (12) Fishes.
The southern constellations: (1) Sea-Monster [Whale], (2) Orion, (3) River, (4) Hare, (5) Dog [Greater Dog], (6) Dog's Forerunner [Lesser Dog], (7) Argo, (8) Watersnake, (9) Bowl, (10) Raven, (11) Centaur, (12) Beast [Wolf], (13) Censer [Altar], (14) Southern Crown, (15) Southern Fish.
Of Ptolemy's 48 constellation figures, 14 (including Centaurus) represent men and women; 3 are birds, 14 are other land creatures; 7 are water creatures, and 10 are inanimate objects.
Note: The 12 named stars in the Almagest are: Arcturus, Regulus, Aselli, Sirius, Procyon, Vindemiatrix, Spica, Lyra (Vega), Capella, Aquila, Canopus, and Antares. Most of them lie in the Milky Way, to the right of the Milky Way, or very close to the Milky Way.
Ptolemy's Almagest, and its star catalogue, became dominant and influential for many centuries both in the Islamic world and in Western Europe. Classical science declined after the fall of Rome and science generally ceased to exist in Western Europe. Greek astronomy ended with the Arab conquest of Alexandria in 641 CE. However, the Arab-Islamic world kept classical knowledge alive by translating Hellenistic scientific texts into Arabic. The late 8th-century and the 9th-century saw a growing interest in Greek science in the Islamic world. At the end of the 8th-century a flourishing astronomical science had developed in the Arab-Islamic world. The Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mūn initiated the heyday of the sciences in the Arab-Islamic world, first in Damascus and then later in Baghdad. (He specifically established a House of Wisdom in Baghdad.) In the 9th-century CE the Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad commissioned the translation from Greek into Arabic of a number of scholarly manuscripts. By the 8th-century the centre of astronomy had moved from Alexandria to Baghdad where Greek astronomical works were translated into Arabic (the scientific language of the ArabIslamic world). Ptolemy's Almagest was first translated into Syriac and then into Arabic. (In the early centuries of the Christian Era the Christian sects (Nestorians, Monophysites, etc.) comprising the Middle

Eastern churches began to hold doctrines that diverged from the doctrines of the churches established in Rome (Catholic) and Constantinople (Byzantium). The Nestorians in particular not only translated Greek religious texts into Syriac but also Greek philosophical, mathematical, and scientific treatises. Due to persecution by the Orthodox Church many Nestorians and some Monophysites migrated to the Persian Empire in Mesopotamia and Iran. There they established schools of intellectual and scholarly discussion, including translation and commentary of Greek texts in Syriac.)
The main transmission of Greek thought to the Arabs was made through the medium of the Syriac manuscripts produced by the great Nestorian school established at Jundishapur in Khuzistan (southwest Persia). It became the leading intellectual centre where writing in Greek and Sanskrit were translated into Syriac and Pahlawi. (The Nestorian sect of Christians was founded in 428 CE by Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople (who settled in Persia under the Sasanian dynasty).) (See: Paul Kunitzsch, "Über einige Spuren der syrischen Almagestübersetzungen." In: Y. Maeyama & W. Saltzer (Editors ). PRISMATA: Naturwissenschaftliche Studien. Festschrift für Willy Hartner (1977, Pages. 203-210).) When the Islamic Arabs conquered Persia this knowledge became available in Arabic.
The earliest translations of the Almagest into Arabic are known to date to circa 800 CE. (Ptolemy's book on mathematical astronomy was translated twice into Arabic in the 9th-century CE.)
It is not known when and by whom the earlier Syriac translation was made. However there was more than one. The date of 7th and 8th centuries is established. Some persons identify the Jewish Rabbi Sahl al-Tabari as the earliest translator of the Almagest into Arabic. According to Gerald Toomer, in his English-language translation of the Almagest the first Arabic translation (from Syriac) was by al-Hasan ibn Quraysh, sometime prior to al-Hajj ibn Matar's translation in 827/8. According to Paul Kunitzsch (Der Almagest, 1974; and Der Sternenkatalog des Almagest: Die arabisch-mittelalterliche Tradition, 1986) the earliest documented translation was a Syriac translation, which predated the reigns of Harun-al-Rashid and al-Ma'mun. The 2nd oldest translation is the Old Arabic version, made either by al-Hasan-ibn-Quraysh (according to Ibn-asSalah) or by Yahya ibn-Khalid (according to Ibn-al-Nadim), and which dated from around 780-820. All copies of both translations are lost, though fragments (significant subset?) are found in later works, most notably in al-Battani, al-Hajjaj and Ibn-as-Salah. A modern critical edition of al-Battani's Arabic text, with a new Latin translation, is given in C. A. Nallino, Albatenii Opus astronomicum (3 Volumes, 1899-1907). The oldest version which survived is from al-Hajjaj (827/8). Another version was made by Ishaq-bin-Hunayn, and was dated around 880-890. This version is also lost in its original form, but a thoroughly reworked (corrected) version by Al-Sabi Thabit ibn Qurra al-Harrani before 902 survived. According to Nasīr al-Dīn Tūsī (1271-1274), Al-Sabi Thabit ibn Qurra al-Harrani (836 –901) also wrote a completely independent translation of the Almagest, which is lost (in independent form). This makes 6 independent translations of the Almagest, all dating from the 9th-century, of which only 2 have come down to the present-day. According to Paul Kunitzsch, all currently known versions of the almagest we know are derived from those.
In the period after circa 1500 CE Arab-Islamic astronomy declined. In the 10th-century CE the power and patronage of the Baghdad caliphs began to decline, but Islamic astronomy continued to make advances in other parts of Islam. By the 11th-century the Baghdad Caliphate had lost control over much of its empire and weaker Caliphs were less inclined to encourage and finance scientific scholarship. The House of Wisdom and its library was destroyed in 1258 CE when the Mongol army ransacked Baghdad.
All knowledge of Ptolemy's Almagest was lost to Western Europe by the early middle ages. Until its decline in the 5th-century CE the city of Alexandria (in Egypt) was the centre of influence for Ptolemaic astronomy and texts. However, Ptolemy's Almagest in the original Greek continued to be copied and studied in the eastern (Byzantine) empire. In the 12th-century Spain became the conduit for the transmission of astronomical knowledge back into medieval Europe. This included the reintroduction of Ptolemy's works and additional Arab-Islamic astronomical texts. Effectively knowledge of Ptolemy's Almagest passed from Greece into the Islamic world then into Western Europe.
The first printed edition of the Almagest in the original Greek was in 1538.

about the content of ancient Greek texts was limited to the summaries made by Roman authors.
Appendix 2:
Modern star catalogues give the position of the stars in a mathematical system of coordinates. Ancient 'star catalogs,' such as Ptolemy's 'star catalogue' were quite different and were not well-suited for astronomical observation. Their intention was more towards providing basic information on the stars comprising the constellation figures and the relative positions of the constellations, as well as explaining legendary aspects of the constellation figures.
The term "early star catalogues" is also commonly applied to descriptions of Greek (and Babylonian) uranography prior to Ptolemy. With few exceptions these "early star catalogues", however, are distinctly different from what modern astronomers, from Ptolemy onwards, have meant by the term. With few exceptions, prior to Ptolemy star catalogues did not give the position of stars by any system of mathematical coordinates. They are instead qualitative descriptions of the constellations. They simply note the number of stars in each part of a constellation and the general location of the brighter stars within a constellation. (The type of description usually used is "near X is Y".) This cumbersome method of describing the location of stars in terms of their relative positions in a constellation was used by both the Babylonians and the Greeks. The pictorial arrangement of stars is not a star catalogue. A star catalogue proper gives accurate positions for each individual star regardless of the constellation it is grouped into. Also, the boundaries of the Greek constellations were subject to change up to the time of Ptolemy.
In Greek astronomy the stars within the constellation figures were usually not given individual names. (There are only a few individual star names from Greece. The most prominent stars in the sky were usually nameless in Greek civilization. If there was a system of Greek star names then it has not come down to us and also would appear unknown to Ptolemy.) Greek constellations ("star catalogues") up to the time of Ptolemy are descriptive. The Western tradition of describing the constellations by means of describing the relative positions of the stars within the constellation figures was firmly established by Eratosthenes and Hipparchus. In their descriptions to the time of Ptolemy the constellations were defined by the Greeks by their juxtaposition (i.e., descriptive comparison of positional relationship to each other). Prior to Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) the general goal of the Greeks at least was not accurate astronomical observation but artistic and mythological education. The end result was a sort of geographical description of territorial position and limits.
Circa the 5th-century BCE many of the constellations recognised by the Greeks had become associated with myths. Both the star catalogue (constellation description) of Eudoxus (4th-century BCE) and the star catalogue (constellation description) of Aratus (3rd-century BCE) adopted the vocabulary of myth. In his Castasterismi Eratosthenes (284-204 BCE) completed and standardised this process with each of the constellations being given a mythological significance. The first complete description of the Greek constellations to survive is given by the Greek poet Aratus circa 270 BCE. With only a few exceptions no actual stars are described by Aratus - only constellation figures. This method was undoubtedly inherited from Eudoxus who produced a set of descriptions of constellations in which the relative positions of stars in each of the constellations was described. Eudoxus was likely the first Greek to summarise the Greek system of constellations. The purpose of the Phaenomena by Aratus was to describe the appearance and the organisation of the constellations in the sky with reference to each other.
Ancient 'star catalogues involved:
(1) Qualitative descriptions of the constellations.
(2) Noting the number of stars in each part of the constellations. (Describing the constellations by means of describing the relative positions of the stars within the constellation figures.)
(3) Noting the general location of the brighter stars within the constellations.
(4) Perhaps providing illustrations of the constellations to accompany the descriptions given.
(5) The illustrations depicting the mythological figures represented by the constellations (rather than the location and brightness of individual stars).

27: The Carolingian period
A Carolingian celestial map of the northern sky, using Aratean figures, from the codex (manuscript) Vaticanus graecus 1087 (fol. 310v) which is a 15th-century CE (Byzantine) copy of a 9th-century CE prototype. (The size of the original is not known.) A catalogue of the Aratean constellations, given in Codex 83II, can be included among the most important Carolingian achievements in the field of science. The Carolingian star catalogues, as they are commonly called, differ from what modern astronomers and ancient astronomers such as Ptolemy meant by that term; they do not give the position of the stars by any mathematical system of coordinates. Rather they are qualitative descriptions of the constellations, noting the number of stars in each part of the constellation and the general location of the brighter stars. Their goal was not astronomical observation but artistic and mythological edification. From the Carolingian epoch,

computistic collections included cosmological excerpta from Pliny and various stellar catalogues, whose illustrations had a decorative as well as a functional role. Stellar catalogues, such as those linked to the Aratea, represented the planets according to their attributes in ancient mythology, and included personifications of the Sun and Moon. The Aratea illustrations were included in medieval monastic computus books and encyclopediae and occasionally accompanied different texts.
Transmission of Aratean Constellation Figures
There are 2 traditions for illustrated astronomical manuscripts: (1) The Aratean poetic tradition, and (2) the Ptolemaic scientific tradition for illustrated astronomical manuscripts (including constellation illustrations).
The Aratean-based illustrative representations of the constellations were established by the end of the Roman Empire. (Artistically, Aratean constellation imagery can be traced to the Atlas Farnese dated to the 2ndcentury BCE. On the globe held by Atlas the images of the constellations appear minus their stars.) These were subsequently modified by illustrators in the Byzantine, Islamic, and Carolingian traditions. Because knowledge of Aratean iconography had been lost, Arab scholars arabized the representations of many constellations.
Knowledge of Greek culture and texts was lost to Western Europe by the early middle ages (the start of which is dated from the fall of Rome in 476 CE). The Classic Aratean tradition of constellations and constellation illustration was revived in Western Europe during the Carolingian period (circa 8th-century CE to circa early 11th-century CE). The Carolingian Renaissance peaked with the rulers Charlemagne and Louis the Pious in the 8th- and 9th-centuries. (There was an increase in the arts, literature, liturgical, and scriptural studies.)
In the Carolingian world, however, the Latin versions of the Phainomena of Aratus were treated primarily as literary sources. They were produced primarily for non-technical general interest. They were treated as catalogues of constellation names and constellation stories. The constellation figures that accompanied Carolingian Aratea manuscripts (1) usually did not accurately reproduce the proper positions of the individual stars in each constellation in accordance with the text; and (2) very often failed to reproduce the correct number of stars in each constellation in accordance with the text.
Under Charlemagne there was a deliberate classical revival in almost every cultural field (scholarship, literature, art, and architecture). The court of Charlemagne in Aachen systematised astronomical learning (and revived other aspects of classical knowledge). However, the Carolingian efforts to preserve and study the Greco-Roman scientific and literature texts was motivated by Charlemagne's felt duty to ensure the progress of the Christian churches (and establishment of correct practices such as ensuring the celebration of the moveable feasts of the Church year on the correct days). It was not motivated by a humanist fascination with classical antiquity. Also, the impetus was Charlemagne's claims to the imperial status of Roman emperors and his extension of Carolingian power into Italy. The science historian Stephen McCluskey has made the point: "The Carolingian renewal of learning contained no agenda for astronomical research. The impetus behind the Carolingian reforms was primarily religious and a pre-eminent concern was to ensure uniform adherence to authoritative standards. Charlemagne speaks in the Admonitio Generalis [a collection of legislation] of the importance of rituals being conducted properly. These concerns called forth two distinct aspects of his reform that concerned the development of astronomy. First, in the schools he established, clerics were taught computus. Secondly, and perhaps less obviously, complete and authentic texts were carefully collected, copied, and distributed. The most significant of these texts are the astronomical and computistical anthologies that emerged around the year 809. These anthologies reinforced the study of astronomy by adding to the traditional computistical texts reflecting the Carolingian interest in astronomy. The star catalogues, as they are commonly called, are a far cry from what modern astronomers and ancients such as Ptolemy meant by that term; they do not give the position of the stars by any mathematical system of coordinates. Rather they are qualitative descriptions of the constellations, noting the number of stars in each part of the constellation and the general location of the brighter stars. Their goal was not astronomical observation but artistic and mythological edification; it seems revealing that they are studied today more by art historians than by historians of science." (Science in Western and Eastern civilization in Carolingian times edited by Paul Butzer and Dietrich Birkhauser (1993; see Stephen McCluskey's article "Astronomies in the Latin West from the fifth to the ninth centuries." (Pages 139-160), specifically page 153.) Charlemagne's quest was to establish a legacy of greatness that connected back to the Holy Roman Empire. As much as

anything his efforts to revive the title of Latin Emperor had its basis in the vast realm that he reigned over. With his coronation on Christmas day 800 CE as Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne laid claim to his succession to the Roman emperors of antiquity, and indeed, to the classical past. The Carolingian revival lasted for approximately 100 years, spanning the 9th-century, and largely involved the recovery, mostly from Italy, of as many classical scientific and literature texts as could be found.
Most of the classical Latin works that have survived were preserved through the copying efforts of Carolingian scholars (monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book copying) throughout Francia (Western Europe). Most of the earliest manuscripts available for ancient texts are Carolingian. (Possibly most of the (surviving) recovered texts came from the city of Ravenna as it had remained a political and cultural power into the 6th-century CE. Charlemagne conquered North Italy and established himself as master of Rome.)
Carolingian illuminators referenced classical styles and mythological meaning and carefully reproduced the classical constellation figures. (Charlemagne's scribes were responsible for copying more than 7,000 manuscripts that would otherwise have been lost.) However, the Carolingian illustrations of the constellations lack accuracy in their relationship to each other and consistency in terms of their projection. Also, very few of the constellation pictures in early medieval manuscripts exactly reproduce star patterns in the sky. Most pictures are only visualizations of the texts they illustrate. Regardless, the earliest completely preserved example of a planispheric map of the sky produced by stereographic projection is a diagram in a Carolingian period copy of an Aratean manuscript, copied in 818 CE.

map of the sky produced by stereographic projection. (The size of the original is 31.2 centimetres x 24 centimetres.) The clearly marked circle is not a representation of the ecliptic, but the galaxy, the Milky Way.
A modern reproduction of the Leiden Aratea, an astronomical treatise. The Aratea is a Latin translation of the Greek Phaenomena of Aratus (circa 315-circa 240 BCE); a didactic poem used to describe the constellations and meteorological phenomena to the Macedonian court. Aratus' Phainomena was based on two prose works by 4th-century BCE astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus. The dimensions of the Aratea are usually given as 225mm x 220mm. The Leiden Aratea the earliest (and most stunning) of the surviving texts dealing with the Phaenomena of Aratus. Interdisciplinary studies have suggested that it is likely a copy of a late antique exemplar, demonstrating the both the survival and the 9th-century resurrection of Roman literature. The version also contains some snippets of Avienus' 4th-century CE translation of Aratus. It was also probably the model for two 10th-century copies from St Bertin (Boulogne, Bibliothèque Municipale, Ms 188 and Bern, Burgerbibliothek, Ms 88).
The Leiden Aratea, a small squarish parchment manuscript (22.5 centimetres x 20(22) centimetres) comprising 99 leaves, is a 9th-century CE copy of an astronomical and meteorological manuscript based on the Phaenomena written by the Greek poet Aratus (circa 315-240/39 BCE). It is not indicated that Aratus' poem was intended to be considered an accurate description of the night sky. It is considered that both the Aratea and the Phaenomena) were intended more for "entertainment" than for educational use. Aratus' Phaenomena is not a particularly accurate account of the night sky. The main text is written in 'rustic capitals,' a narrow, condensed style of script developed in ancient Rome for inscriptions carved on stone. The script is intended to reflect the antiquity of the exemplar and is only reserved for the finest books. The anachronistic script style later misled Humanist scholars into thinking the Leiden Aratea was much earlier than the 9th-century. As well as majuscule script a rather inelegant and much less decipherable Gothic miniscule script repeats the main text throughout the book to make it accessible to a contemporary Medieval audience. This transcription in Gothic minuscule script in the margins was added in the 13th-century. The core of the Leiden Aratea is the inclusion of 38(39) full-page miniatures, possibly copies of a 4th-century CE work. The Leiden Aratea is one of the earliest and most beautifully illustrated of the surviving manuscripts. It is described as a major work of Carolingian art. The order of the illustrations follow the presentation of the material. It appears certain that the illustrator consulted several sources for the constellation illustrations. Close inspection of the blank sides of the miniatures show faint outlines of the figures, indicating that they were not simply copied by later artists, but traced directly from the source document. It appears that 11 of the 36 constellation illustrations are obviously taken from diagrams derived from a celestial globe (i.e., are oriented looking inwards towards the earth). The remainder are depicted as seen from earth (i.e., looking outward at the sky). The Leiden Aratea is a faithful copy of an earlier manuscript that was probably made in the 4th- or 5th-century CE and offers unique evidence of the form and content of illustrated books in the ancient world. It is also noteworthy with respect to classical text transmission. The existing manuscript was created by an unknown artist during the reign of Louis the Pious (814-840) in the second quarter of the 9thcentury. (The evidence suggests it was probably produced in the royal scriptorium, possibly in 816 CE.) The ultimate source that formed the basis of the Leiden Aratea was the Latin version of Aratus' Phaenomena written by Germanicus Julius Caesar (15 BCE - 19 CE). He was a prominent Roman general and is also known to be the father of Caligula. Many scholars have argued that it is likely a direct copy of a probably 4th-century CE work. The subject matter, format, technique, and style all point to a faithful reproduction of a

lost late-antique exemplar. Also, it is considered the impressionistic and painterly quality of the miniatures do not quite reflect the known trademarks of established scriptoria at the time. There are no colophons, notes, or palaeographical features that help identify its origins. Also noteworthy is many miniatures contain instructions to the artist describing which image should be added to the page.
The Leiden Aratea's 38(39) extant full-page miniatures are stunningly beautiful. However, whoever drew the illuminations was not an astronomer, someone who actually would observe the constellations and draw them once more. He (or they) were illuminators who drew the constellations by looking at other (older) books (with pictures or simply text). The miniaturists who copied the Aratea, and many other manuscripts dedicated to stars, considered the drawing of any similar form of a constellation an adequate copy of that constellation. This helps explain some of the diversity displayed by the pictures of the constellations. That the stars were frequently placed in a rather imprecise manner the stars themselves didn't matter that much. What mattered in the Aratea was the poem, the iconography, the mythology; not the scientific accuracy. The Aratea was not meant to be taken outside on a starry night, to compare the stars with what was drawn in the book. Even in manuscripts that predominately dealt with the stars themselves, the stars were depicted in an apparently random manner. (Accuracy in astronomical illustrations - when existing - is a late Medieval trend.
Of all the manuscripts on astronomy from the Carolingian Renaissance, the Aratea of Leiden is undoubtedly the most famous. The original existing manuscript was acquired by the University of Leiden in 1690 and is preserved in the Library (Ms. Voss. lat. Q. 79) as the most important manuscript owned by the Netherlands.
See the illustrated booklet: The Leiden Aratea: Ancient Constellations in a Medieval Manuscript by Ranee Katzenstein and Emilie Savage-Smith (1988) (Note: This section on the Aratus Latinus also owes heavily to the work of Jenneka Janzen, PhD student, Universiteit Leiden.)
Phaenomena flourished into the Middle Ages where it continued and consolidated the "two-sphere" view of the universe that predominated throughout antiquity. (The earth is fixed at the centre of the universe and surrounded by the cosmos (an enormous celestial sphere) which revolves around it.) No overall detailed study has yet been published on the transmission and reception of the Aratea in the Middle Ages (the role the text of the Aratea played in West European astronomical studies from the 8th-century to the 12th-century; how the entire number of texts that make up the Aratea was read, commented on and copied during this period).
Loss of knowledge of Roman uranography during the early Dark Ages
Mathematical and observational astronomy, being a socially fragile enterprise, did not survive the tumult of the collapse of the Roman Empire in Western Europe. After the breakup of the Western Roman Empire, astronomy did not have as great an importance in Western scholarship as had earlier been the case. Most Greek astronomical texts were lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th-century CE. In the late 4th and early 5th centuries CE, textbooks of astrology vanished in the West. Hence the absence of any on-going technical astronomical tradition in Western Europe. (People studied astronomy in order to practice astrology.) Some knowledge of the constellations (and astronomy) was maintained in Western Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire in circa 475 CE to the Carolingian revival circa 800 CE. Some astronomical research agendas that did exist, as example, were that of Carolingian scholars who attempted to work with the limited Latin sources to investigate the problems of the orbits of Venus and Mercury. Also, a variety of uses of astronomy in the early Middle Ages included the replacement of pagan solar festivals with Christian festivals and monastic timekeeping. The historian Valerie Flint has argued that the early Middle Ages was characterized by the attempt of the Catholic Church to salvage astrology for its own purpose. The Phaenomena of Aratus was well known in the Latin West through the translations of several Roman authors.
Early medieval Western Europe was a wasteland. Law and order had ceased to exist and numerous local wars were an ongoing occurrence. This was the end result of the hordes of Vandals, Goths, Huns, Visigoths, Franks, and Saxons, that had overwhelmed the Roman Empire in the 6th-century CE. They had been succeeded by roving bands of indigenous brigands, mercenaries, and feudal barons. The social disruption that followed the fall of the Roman Empire - including also epidemic diseases, harvest failures, and successive waves of invasion/migration into Italy (and elsewhere) - confined astronomy to a small number of intellectual pockets. The invasions into Italy and elsewhere effectively wrecked Roman civilization. There was an enormous loss of libraries and ancient texts. The Roman Empire was in tatters. By circa 500 CE the

urban world of the Roman Empire was in tatters. By the end of the 7th-century most of Western Europe was in ruins. Whole cities had been destroyed or fell into disrepair and disuse. Roads and bridges fell into disrepair and disuse. Most of the original classical texts comprising the bulk of Greco-Roman learning had been lost. The invasions alone destroyed cities, monasteries, libraries, schools, and institutions such as law and government. Law and order vanished, and education almost disappeared. Monastic enclaves sometimes preserved - but also usually ignored the contents of - remnants of classical thought and culture. Competent/learned scholars were scarce, resources were scarce, and general literacy was minimal. The Greek language was largely forgotten, only simplified Latin remained in use. Overall there was a tremendous decline in cultural sophistication.
The European Middle Ages initially inherited star names and constellations from Roman antiquity, mainly through Latin literary texts. The Roman texts that transmitted astronomical knowledge to medieval Western Europe included: Commentary on the Dream of Scipio by Macrobius Theodosius (5th-century CE), and On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury by Martianus Capella (early 5th-century CE). (Commentary on the Dream of Scipio was one of the most important sources for Platonism in the Latin West during the Middle Ages.)
Rome transmitted very little of what has been called 'Greek thought' to Christian Europe. The very little that was transmitted did not include the astronomical systems of Hipparchus or Ptolemy. But there are reasons for this. Most 'Greek thought' remained in Greek, and was not translated into Latin. As knowledge of Greek declined with the fall of the Roman Empire, so did the knowledge of Greek texts, many of which remained untranslated into Latin. The Greek language was all but forgotten until a group of 12th-century scholars rediscovered and translated the works of Aristotle. The term "Recovery of Aristotle" refers to the copying or re-translating of most of Aristotle's books from Greek or Arabic text into Latin, during the Middle Ages, of the Latin West. The Recovery of Aristotle spanned about 100 years, from the middle 12th century into the 13th century, and involved copying or translating over 42 books, including Arabic texts from Arabic authors. Previously, Latin versions of 2 books were in general circulation in Latin Europe: Categories and On Interpretation (De Interpretatione). These were due to the translation work of Manlius Boethius, a Roman senator, consul, magister officiorum, and philosopher of the early 6th-century. Aristotelian logic, which was to become an integral part of medieval scholasticism, was first transmitted to Latin Christianity through the work of Manlius Boethius. His copy of Categories and its commentary is thought to derive from the school of Proclus (the Greek Neo-Platonist philosopher Proclus Lycaeus (412-485 CE)). Ptolemy's Almagest in the original Greek continued to be copied and studied in the eastern (Byzantine) empire. Latin Europe, had lost the original Greek version of Ptolemy's work until recovered in Byzantine in the 15th-century.
Astronomy during the Middle Ages is generally treated in two parts. The 1st part is the Early Middle Ages circa 500-1000 CE. The 2nd part is the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages beginning circa 1000/11001500 CE. Circa the middle of the 5th-century, the collapse of the Roman Empire began a dark period in the history of Western quantitative astronomy. The early Dark Ages (circa 500 CE to 700 CE) saw loss of astronomical knowledge and loss of learning in general. This period had little in the way of intellectual culture. Knowledge of astronomy in the Latin West after this time is essentially limited by the contemporary sources. Because a knowledge of Greek was not present, only Latin sources were available. Four sources were particularly popular for astronomy: Calcidius's commentary on Plato's Timaeus, Macrobius's Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, Martianus Capella's Marriage of Philology and Mercury, and Pliny's Natural History. These sources contained only qualitative information and did not give an explanation of the methods by which such information had been originally obtained. This lack of explanation limited the potential for Latin scholars to advance the technical science of astronomy.Some astronomical knowledge survived. Astronomical skills and interests were maintained mostly in the largest monastic centres of learning where they were linked to time-keeping (especially through the night) and the construction of the Christian calendar. The main use of astronomy of a more technical nature in this period was on behalf of computus, or the science of determining the correct dates for Christian festivals, especially Easter. (Examples being: St. Gallen in Switzerland, Ravenna in Italy, Rheims in France, Vic/Vich in Spain (near Barcelona), and the monasteries at York in England.) Appropriate times for monastic offices occurring during the night were determined by the identification of constellations in the night sky.
Gregory of Tours work De cursu stellarum (On the Course of the Stars), written circa 575 CE (6th-century), gives instructions for how the stars are to be used for keeping time. It is one of the few well-documented examples of early medieval star viewing relating to the monastic practice of timekeeping after dark.

(Interestingly, Gregory of Tours invented and illustrated his own constellations for this purpose. It is unclear whether creating such constellations was common practice at the time or an unprecedented novelty.) (Astrological texts also carried knowledge of the constellations.) Also important for the Christian church was the celebration of the Easter festival. Ensuring the correct date involved astronomical observation, recordkeeping, and calculation. Bede's The Reckoning of Time stands out as the great achievement in Latin computus and astronomy in the Early Middle Ages. The English Benedictine monk Bede at Jarrow in Northumbria, circa 700 CE, began to teach and write (in Latin) on classical astronomy (De Temporibus (On the Times), and De Temporum Ratione (On Reckoning Times)). Bede used observable proofs and mathematical calculations in his early 8th-century treatise De temporum ratione to to teach astronomical principles for the calculation of the date of Easter. The constellation knowledge of the collapsed Roman Empire was revived by Charlemagne circa 800 CE. (Possibly most of the (surviving) recovered texts came from the city of Ravenna as it had remained a political and cultural power into the 6th-century CE. Charlemagne conquered North Italy and established himself as master of Rome.) The Latin translations of Aratus' Phaenomena, commonly called Aratea, were also revived in the Carolingian period. Discussions of constellations likely quoted frequently from surviving texts by the Roman writers Virgil, Ovid, and Lucan.
Until the translation of the Almagest into Latin – from the Greek in 1160, from the Arabic in 1175 – Western Europeans readers obtained their knowledge of the world from the encyclopaedists and the poets. They had neither the need for a work as sophisticated as Ptolemy's nor the basis for understanding it. For 3 centuries after the reintroduction of the Almagest into Western Europe it circulated among a quite small number of mathematicians, while simplified versions of its contents – taking the 2 basic forms, Tractatus de spera (= De sphaera, circa 1220, by Sacrobosco) and Theorica planetarum (circa 1250, anonymous author) – were used by the wider learned audience, especially at the universities. Sufficient classical tradition regarding the constellations had been kept alive to enable the Arab-Islamic civilisation to source them. In post-Roman Western Europe from circa 576 CE to circa 750 CE there was constant trade and migrations. It is obvious from al-Sûfi's medieval text on the constellations (The Book of the Fixed Stars) that ancient pictures of constellations in books as well as on globes, must have been known in the Arabic/Arab-Islamic world before al-Sûfi's time.

The European Middle Ages inherited star names and constellations from Roman antiquity, mostly via Latin literary texts. When, from the 11th century onwards, Arabic texts and instruments became available, figures and vocabulary at first were not compatible with this tradition. The example of an excerpt from Pseudo-Hyginus De Astronomia shows, how a Roman text on the constellations was revised and supplemented with the names of the astrolabe-stars to combine the two different traditions. ]

Page 86 of Aratus Latinus manuscript, St. Gallen, Stiftsbibiliothek, Cod. Sang. 902. (Cod. Sang. 902 is a composite manuscript with copy of Aratus Latinus.) The parchment manuscript is a school manuscript for the St. Gallen monastery school (Switzerland), containing the Greek grammar by Dositheus, and a prose version of Aratus of Soloi's didactic poem "Phainomena" which is illustrated with pen drawings.
During the Alexandrian age, a number of related Greek texts started to appear alongside the original Greek version of the Phaenomena of Aratus to form a new astronomical corpus. These texts appended to the original Greek version of the Phaenomena of Aratus included some spurious prefaces, various versions of the life of the poet, one or two lists of constellations attributed to Eratosthenes and Hipparchus, and discussions of the constellations as they appear on the celestial sphere. This compilation also included abbreviated versions of the catasteristic myths associated with each constellation and descriptions of the shapes of the individual constellations along with the disposition of the stars within each figure. Some of these texts are associated with an astronomical treatise attributed to Eratosthenes (circa 276 BCE– circa 195 BCE), (the pseudo-Eratosthenes). Also, Theon of Alexandria is credited with producing an edition of the Phaenomena in the late first century BCE which became the standard edition in late antiquity and ultimately the basis of a medieval manuscript tradition. It also introduced new variants into the text.
The Alexandrian compilation was very popular across the Graeco-Roman world. It appeared in several different formats with varying additions and subtractions and served as the inspiration for numerous authors and poets in both languages (Greek and Latin). A definitive version of the Aratean corpus, with a set group of texts ordered in a particular fashion, appears to have come together sometime between the beginning of

the 2nd and end of the 3rd-century CE. No complete version of this compilation has survived, but its contents have been largely reconstructed by combining a number of the later Greek and Latin fragments that formed a part of, or were derived from, the original version of the original grouping of texts. This late 2nd or early 3rd-century secondary edition, though based on the earlier edition, was stripped of its scholia and fitted with new scholia on the catasterisms. It also introduced new variants into the text. This branch of the tradition is represented by the 8th-century Latin translation known as the Aratus Latinus and the 15th-century S(corialensis). The Codicis Scorialensis descends from the family of (Vatican) manuscripts titled Marcianus Graecus.
Some time before or during the 8th century CE a Latin translation Aratus Latinus appeared. This translation was based on a text referred to as 'Φ' which was compiled some time between the beginning of the 2nd and end of the 3rd century CE. The Aratus Latinus is a crude anonymous translation. The additional 8th-century translation that is more polished is usually referred to as the Revised Aratus Latinus.
In the mid 8th-century CE, a Greek version of the Aratean corpus was translated into Latin (and became known as the Aratus Latinus - to all extent a later version of the Greek Phaenomena). Unfortunately, its author's talent for translation fully reflects the standards of his age. Classicists describe this work as 'versionis rara barbaries', and that 'la langue n'en est pas seulement barbare, elle est inintelligible, au moins pour la texte poétique lui-même,' and it is 'often nonsensical.' This Latin version of the Aratean compilation is usually simply called 'the Aratus latinus.' Hubert Le Bourdellès, based on his linguistic analysis (L'Aratus Latinus, 1985), suggested that it had been copied from an interlinear translation of the Greek Phaenomena. Le Bourdellès proposed that with the gradual decline of Greek, scholars first needed glossaries to read Greek and this led to a now lost 'bilingual' copy. When the Greek text was later abandoned the literal translation, titled Aratus Latinus, began to circulate separately from the first half of the 8th-century. Due to the poor standard of translation it was difficult to comprehend. A revised and modified version of the text was undertaken almost immediately. This text was called the Revised Aratus Latinus.
The early history of the editions of the Aratus latinus (Aratus Latinus) is somewhat confusing. Essentially, the Aratus Latinus consisted of 8 Aratean pieces of varies provenance. The Aratus Latinus was rediscovered in Gaul prior to Alcuin and the Carolingian Renaissance. At the beginning of the 8th-century CE Aratus was neglected and almost forgotten, likely because of strong opposition from the church to the pagan legends and images contained in Aratea. The Aratus Latinus is preserved in 4 manuscripts and is a translation of an Alexandrian collection of writings by the Greek poet Aratus. Perhaps owing to the fact that the original version of the Aratus latinus was so difficult to comprehend, a revised and modified version of the text was created almost immediately – sometime during the 2nd half of the 8th-century. This work is generally referred to as the Aratus latinus recensio interpolata (or as the Revised Aratus latinus).
The Revised Aratus Latinus
The text of Aratus latinus was edited by the classical philologist Ernst Maass in 1898. In 1898, Ernst Maass made the first great effort towards reconstructing the text of the Aratus latinus in his Commentariorum in Aratum. As a philologist, it seems that Maass's primary interest in the Aratus latinus was to establish a definitive text. He brought together all the dispersed fragments to form what is now considered to be the more-or-less definitive text. When it came to editing the Revised Aratus latinus (the Aratus latinus recensio interpolata), however, he only provided those sections that correlated to and, therefore, supported the original text. The result is the text Maass provides does not fully reflect what appears in the manuscripts themselves. Maass's editions of these texts remain the touchstone for all subsequent studies. In the main text, the reader is provided with the Aratus latinus and, running along the bas-du-page, is the later version of the text, the Aratus latinus recensio interpolata or Revised Aratus latinus. However, Hubert Le Bourdellès (1985) has pointed out there still many complex problems surrounding the history, structure and language of the texts as they appear in the actual manuscripts. A revision of the Aratus Latinus (producing the so-called Revised Aratus Latinus, "Aratus latinus recensio interpolata") was most probably carried out in the second half of the 8th-century CE. The revision involved the elimination of the unintelligible/confusing parts of the text were eliminated and the meaning of the text was clarified, but without being collated with a Greek manuscript. The Revised Aratus Latinus, apart from correcting and omitting parts of the old texts, also added extracts from Latin works. The text of the Revised Aratus Latinus itself included numerous excerpts from Isidore, Hyginus, Fulgentius Mythographus and others. To a large extent the inclusion of extracts replaced

the 2nd part of the poem on weather signs that was initially translated in the Aratus Latinus. According to Hubert Le Bourdellès (1985) the Aratus Latinus was composed circa 750-760 CE at the abbey of Corbie near Amiens in northern France.
Hubert Le Bourdellès, based on his linguistic analysis (L'Aratus Latinus, 1985), suggested that it had been copied from an interlinear translation of the Greek Phaenomena. Le Bourdellès proposed that with the gradual decline of Greek, scholars first needed glossaries to read Greek and this led to a now lost 'bilingual' copy. When the Greek text was later abandoned the literal translation, titled Aratus Latinus, began to circulate separately from the first half of the 8th-century. Due to the poor standard of translation it was difficult to comprehend. A revised and modified version of the text was undertaken almost immediately. This text was called the Revised Aratus Latinus.

28: Post Islam Arabic-Islamic Constellations
The remains of the Qusayr 'Amra lodge and bath house in present-day Jordan. The photograph shows the rear of the remaining building comprising the bath house (audience hall, east bay, vault of bath house). The bath is built on the Roman model. The dome/cupola of the "hot room" of the hamman (bath house) is seen on the right. Outside light floods into the calidarium/caldarium - in the bath wing - through its 4 windows. One of the more remarkable frescos in the Qusayr 'Amra is that of the little dome of the calidarium, which is a very early representation of the night sky in the round surface. The constellations painted on the domed ceiling of the calidarium comprises the earliest extant evidence of Islamic celestial mapping. Also, the representation of constellations is among the earliest examples of pictorial art in the Islamic period that have survived to the present-day. The artist was influenced by pre-Islamic visual tradition.
The post-Islamic Arabic tradition of astronomy took up the organisation of the sky from Greek uranography. The constellations painted at Qusayr 'Amra demonstrate the close connection between late classical (GraecoRoman art) and early Islamic art. In the private realm of Islamic art, representations of living beings remained permissible, Greek constellation figures at the Qusayr 'Amra lodge and bath house being an example.
The Qusayr 'Amra (also spelled Qasr Amra and Qusayr 'Amrah) bath house complex was built in a remote area in the eastern desert of present-day Jordan. (Properly, it is located in steppe, not desert. Some vegetation

exists in the region.) The building is the remnant of a larger complex (provincial palace). It is situated about 80 kilometres east of Amman (Jordan). The bath house was built in Wadi Butm which was full of water in the spring. The water for the bath was drawn from a nearby well. The water was obtained by hydraulic means. (A beast-of-burden powered a hydraulic water raising system.) The building is constructed from red limestone and basalt. It formed part of a larger residential complex that was commonly used as a hunting lodge (desert lodge). The building was located in a hunting ground. (In the era of the Umayyad (661-750 CE) and 'Abbāsid (750-1258 CE) caliphates, hunting with cheetahs was a popular pastime for the political elite throughout the Middle East.) It is thought the original larger complex included residential quarters and a fortress. (A protective fort existed on a nearby hill and only the foundations now remain. The fort would have served to house troops on a temporary basis.) Today the bath house is the site's only remaining building for what could be termed an Arab palace complex - meant as a royal retreat, without any military function. (The remaining structure contains two main components: an audience hall and a bath house.) The whole complex was rather small so was not intended for lengthy residential use. (It was not a castle but frequently continues to be loosely described as a 'desert castle.') The building and its frescoes date to the Umayyad period. The Qusayr 'Amra complex was one of a number lodges believed to be used as a vacation residence for short (hunting) trips by the Umayyad rulers or for short stop-overs by judges or high functionaries on their journeys. The complex is believed to have been built between 711 CE and 715 CE by one of the Umayyad rulers. (The dating is enabled by a fresco depicting six rulers; "The Family of Kings" defeated by the Umayyads.) The attribution of the building to a certain person of the early 8th-century remains uncertain. It is usually held that it was built by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (ruled 705-715 CE) who, at this period of time, was gaining increasing dominance over the region. However, this identification may be incorrect. The more likely candidates are either Walid II or Yazid III. (Walid II (ruled 743-744) was the uncle of Walid I.) The complex is one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture. (In each of its rooms the walls and ceilings are covered in richly painted frescoes.)
Educated mawálí (non-Arab clients who were responsible for the day-to-day running of Umayyad estates) of Greek origin abounded at the Umayyad court. They would have been able to recognize and understand a Greek zodiac if they saw one. The Umayyad rulers and high functionaries would have been able to recognise and perhaps understand a Greek zodiac, and other Greek art forms.
In the strictest form of Islamic art only patterns and colours are permitted. This meant that Islamic art is traditionally limited to abstract geometrical forms. However, the Qur'an, the holy book of the Islamic religion, does not explicitly forbid the representation of human or animal forms. Early Islamic traditions were generally against the the use of images by artists. Islamic art has typically focused, though not entirely, on the depiction of patterns rather than on figures. In the private world of early Islamic palaces (and similar) the representation of humans and animals continued unabated. The human and animal depictions on the frescoes at the the Qusayr 'Amra lodge are an example of this.
The long abandoned building was rediscovered in 1898 by the Czech archaeologist (he is also identified as an Austrian) Reverend Doctor Alois Musil of the University of Olmütz. In the early 1970s a Spanish Archaeological Mission was sent to Jordan to preserve and promote Qusayr 'Amra. They carried out limited archeological excavations of the area and discovered the remnants of a smaller courtyard castle 300 metres northwest of the bath house. Between 1971 and 1974 this team from the Madrid Archaeological Museum, under the direction of Martin Almegro, painstakingly cleaned and conserved the frescoes. (At the time of its discovery the celestial map painted in the bath house was in a poor state of preservation.) In 1998 a FrancoJordanian project to collect new documentary material of the mural paintings in the buildings comprising the Qusayr 'Amra complex. From the data obtained by this project 2 more Ptolemaic constellations (Perseus and Auriga) were identified.

View of the constellations painted on the inside of the 2.75 metre (some sources say 2.60 metre) diameter dome at the Qusayr 'Amra bath house. The design/placement of the constellations is that which would be seen looking down on a globe. The decorated surface approximates to 10 square metres. On the lower right the zodiacal constellation Sagittarius is shown out-of-place in the space available between two arched windows. The four arched windows face the cardinal points. The only trace of an Islamic planispheric starmap is perhaps echoed on this constellation fresco at Qusayr 'Amra, and it was probably derived from late classical maps.

The classical Greek constellation set was readily adopted in the Islamic Middle Ages. Arab-Islamic star mapping mostly followed the Ptolemaic tradition. Ptolemy's star catalogue remained the standard star catalogue in both the Western and Islamic world for circa 1000 years.
The representation of the "Dome of Heaven" on the cupola of Qusayr 'Amra is not regarded as an isolated phenomena in the classical and postclassical world. Bath houses in the Greek East had similar ceiling depictions but none have been preserved. However, no other existing examples are known.
The 2.75 metre diameter dome/cupola of the the caldarium or "hot room" of the hamman (bath house) at Qusayr 'Amra contains a unique hemispherical celestial map. (The design of the baths follows the Roman bath custom of apodyterium, tepidarium, and caldarium.) The inside of the dome/cupola above the calidarium was presented as the "Dome of Heaven." It is painted with constellations of the northern hemisphere together with the signs of the zodiac. It is one of the earliest known astronomical charts surviving on such a scale. It is also thought to be the earliest surviving attempt to represent the constellation of the night sky on the inside of a hemispherical surface, rather than a flat surface. The surviving fragments

of the astronomical fresco show parts of 37 constellations (involving some 400 stars). Similar to the GraecoRoman tradition the constellations are represented by pictures only- individual stars are not depicted/represented. This celestial map furnishes a connecting link between the classical representations of the constellations and the later Arab-Islamic forms. (The classical Greco-Roman constellation iconography found in Aratean manuscripts is evident in most of the constellations at Qusayr 'Amra. The iconography of most of the constellations is classical or early medieval (Western).) The hemispherical celestial map, like the rest of the frescoes, was probably painted between circa 730-750 CE. Also, it is likely a copy of an illustration in a manuscript - the artist seems to have been copying from a drawing which he has transposed in mirror-image, reversing the relationship of all the constellations.
Emilie Savage-Smith states: "In painting this early Syrian domed ceiling, the unknown artist ... was continuing a well-established pre-Islamic tradition of celestial mapping." The hemispherical dome fresco of Qusayr 'Amra was an attempt to portray scientifically the celestial sky. As on a celestial globe the constellation figures appear within a system of coordinates. Whilst the constellation depiction cannot be called scientifically correct, they are evidence of a thoroughly scientific approach. The zodiac, in particular, testifies to the artist's considerable skill in depicting on a hemispherical cupola the whole night sky visible in a given place. A number of technical adjustments were required, and the artist had to erase and redo several parts of his composition; in other words, he was interested in accuracy, not just aesthetic effect.
The map has circles and twelve radii that do not emerge from the centre of the dome but from the ecliptic North Pole, with the constellation signs arranged accordingly. From the length of the radial lines it is possible to calculate that the sky map was drawn for thirty-two degrees north and so is not simply a copy of a Greek sky map but is based on a surviving tradition. Only some 35 constellations now remain. The remaining constellations that are still distinguishable include Ursa Major (Great Bear) and Ursa Minor (Little Bear), Andromeda, Cassiopeia and Orion. The signs of the zodiac are incorporated in easily recognisable forms. Sagittarius, for instance, is shown as a centaur, his human torso turning back to draw his bow, the classic pose for the Parthian shot.
The constellations are not portrayed as seen by the spectator within the globe. They are portrayed as they appear on the outer surface of the celestial sphere. Interestingly, the drawings of the constellations are reversed as well as their relative positions; they are depicted counterclockwise around the dome, suggesting that the 8th-century artist copied a drawing (or had used a celestial globe for assistance) without realizing that the astronomical order has to be reversed for a concave hemispherical surface like the inside of a dome. (The constellations are depicted as would be seen looking down on a globe, rather than as would be seen from earth.) Also, the orientation of some constellations figures, for example Sagittarius, is wrong.
Constellations from the southern sky are also portrayed. The equator is considerably above the base of the dome. (As a result, the tropic of Capricorn has a larger diameter than the equator.) The painter attempted to represent more than half of the sky on the inside of an almost hemispherical dome/cupola. However, inaccuracies exist indicating that the painter was an artist, not an astronomer. As well as all of the (primary) northern constellations the artist, who was especially interested in the constellations of the zodiacal belt, also recorded some of the southern constellations. The means of projecting the night sky on the available surface were inadequate. To avoid interruptions due to the four arched windows at the base of the dome/cupola he placed the pole in the zenith at the top of the dome/cupola and lifted the horizontal equator. The artist has attempted to portray the known celestial globe. As such the celestial equator is considerably above the base of the dome/cupola. As a result, the Tropic of Capricorn has a larger diameter than the celestial equator. The painter also crowded some of the ceiling areas too tightly and failed to have the band of the ecliptic pass through the northern solstitial point. The four windows at the base of the dome/cupola also interfered with the representation of the southern constellations. The ecliptic coordinates are represented by twelve longitude arcs that meet at the pole of the ecliptic, in the constellation Draco, and by the zodiacal belt. However, the zodiacal belt is depicted as laying to the north instead of both sides of the ecliptic. (The zodiacal zone is represented on the fresco by a pinkish white stripe edged with red that is about 10 degrees wide. The width of the zodiacal zone on the celestial sphere in Greek antiquity and until the 8th-century CE was actually 12 degrees. The median circle, the ecliptic itself, has not been represented.) The astronomical correspondence of the zodiacal constellations with the 30-degree intervals of longitude (marked by the 12 longitudinal arcs) is forfeited by the artist deciding to display the zodiacal constellation Sagittarius in the space available between two windows.

The equator corresponds roughly to the 7th- or 8th-century CE. Because of the inaccuracies in the way the sky is represented it is impossible to date either the fresco (astronomical painting) or the original globe by the position of the equinoxes.

(BaBesch [BABesch - Bulletin Antieke Beschaving], Volume 73, January, 1998, Pages 125-151, Page 131). The author believes that the frescoes were mainly made by Coptic artisans who painted in a recognisable Egyptian/Coptic style.
Appendix 1: The Constellations Identified
Saxl and Beer could both identify 33 Ptolemaic constellations or remaining parts of constellations. They disagreed on the identification of one. Saxl identified a remaining fragment with Cepheus, whereas Beer identified it as Cassiopeia. From the data obtained by the 1998 Franco-Jordanian project at the Qusayr 'Amra complex 2 more Ptolemaic constellations (Perseus and Auriga) were identified (by Brunet, Nadel, and Vibert-Guigue). 15 constellations are to the north of the zodiac (Ursa Minor, Ursa Maior, Draco, Cepheus, Bootes, Hercules, Lyra, Cygnus, Perseus, Auriga, Ophiuchus, Serpens, Aquila, Delphinus, Andromeda), 9 are in the zodiac (Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces), and 11 are to the south of the zodiac (Cetus, Orion, Lepus, Canis Minor, Navis, Hydra, Crater, Corvus, Centaurus, Ara, Corona Australis). Additionally, there is an image of an ivy leaf covering a group of stars above Leo's tail.
Appendix 2: Early Planispheric Maps
The earliest completely preserved example of a planispheric map of the sky produced by stereographic projection is a diagram in a Carolingian period copy of an Aratean manuscript, copied in 818 CE. Emilie Savage-Smith states: "As the fresco at Qusayr Amrah predates the Carolingian map by a century, it seems certain at this point that the extant Western manuscripts of planisphere celestial maps produced by stereographic projections represent a much older, continuous tradition of mapping that reached Syria by the early eighth century along a route at present unknown." There are numerous accounts of Caliph al-Walid I bringing Byzantine artisans into Damascus in the early 8th-century CE, for the construction of the great Umayyad mosque. Later, indigenous Bedouin uranography/starlore played a role in Islamic celestial mapping. Stereographic projection requires the notion of sphericity from which - using mathematical rules points on a flat surface are plotted to correspond to points on a spherical surface, whether terrestrial or celestial.

The original Greek astronomical poem Phainomena by Aratus was translated into Arabic early in the 9thcentury CE. This Arabic translation was used in Kitab al-'unwan (The book of models) (941-942 CE) by Mahbub (Agapius), who lived in the Syrian town of Manbij (northeast of Aleppo). It is not known whether the copy of Phainomena by Aratus translated into Arabic was illustrated. The extent of the influence of Aratean constellation illustrations on Islamic constellation iconography remains difficult to determine.
It is certain that planispheric maps were available in the Islamic world long before the translation (and certain introduction) of the Phaenomena early in the 9th-century. This is shown by the circa 71 l-715 CE frescoed dome of the constellations in the desert palace of Qusayr 'Amra, Jordan. The fresco represents the constellations of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres (although its damaged state allows only a fragmentary glimpse), and was probably copied from a planispheric map showing the constellations as they appear on a globe - the figures are depicted in mirror-image of their proper appearance in the sky. Fritz Saxl identified two Greek manuscripts containing planispheric maps which share "striking astrothetical errors" with Qusayr 'Amra as well as similarities in iconography. There are also enough iconographical differences between the Western manuscripts and the fresco to show "the orientalisation of the [classical constellation] types at an early stage." The fresco also demonstrates new activity in the classical mapping tradition, changes made in the Islamic world. Savage-Smith observes that the frescoed map uses a system of lines dividing the ecliptic into 12 segments, which is characteristic of Islamic celestial globes, and not used in the West. This shows that Qusayr 'Amra occupies a stage of transition between Greek and Islamic scientific/astronomical traditions. Savage-Smith stated that the absence of Libra from Qusayr 'Amra affiliates the fresco with "a prePtolemaic conception of the skies," as represented by the planispheric maps in Aratean manuscripts. However, the fragmentary state of the Umayyad fresco does not conclusively show that Libra has indeed been omitted. The exact source of the planispheric map model for Qusayr 'Amra is not known, but the constellation fresco points to active development of classical maps and constellation iconography within the Islamic world. While the Qusayr 'Amra mapping-lines demonstrate a more scientific approach than would be expected in the Phaenomena of Aratus, the ultimate source of the imagery may well have been a "globeview" planisphere illustration to Aratus' text.
However, Elly Dekker (Illustrating the Phaenomena (2013)) has shown that the idea that medieval planispheres were based on stereographic projection cannot be maintained. She states that how the mappings at Qusayr 'Amra were realised is presently unknown. Her ideas in her section on Qusayr 'Amra in her book have yet to be utilised in this essay. Dekker's "... book is partly devoted to to dispel persistent histiographic myths and mistakes. The most remarkable example is the confutation of the claim that ancient and medieval northern and southern celestial hemispheres and planispheres are based on the same stereographic projection employed to make planispheric astrolabes. By measuring the positions of the stars, the constellations and the reference circles drawn on the maps, Dekker demonstrates that hemispheres and planispheres were not based on the stereographic projection. From the first medieval examples up to the end of the 15th century, such maps were instead based on an intuitive form of equidistant projection. The later facilitated the transfer of astronomical data from a star catalogue to a grid of meridians and uniformly spaced parallels. This cartographic structure also marks a tight connection between maps and globes. Dekker indeed suggests that old hemispheres and planispheres may originate from copying celestial globes taken as models." (Giorgio Strano, Book Review Illustrating the Phaenomena, Nuncius, Volume 30, 2015, Pages 715-717, Page 716.)
Appendix 3: Agade Mailing list: News 31 May, 2012: New discovery at early Islamic site in Jordan: Uncovered inscription reveals name of Umayyad prince.
"AMMAN, JORDAN.- Recent conservation work at Qusayr 'Amra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site 85 kilometers east of Amman, has revealed the name of the Umayyad prince who commissioned the construction of the building. ... The inscription, which previously could not be read due to accumulated dirt and previous unsuccessful cleaning attempts, is an invocation to Allah beginning with the formula "Allahumma aslih al-Walid ibn Yazîd" ("Oh God! Make al-Walîd ibn Yazîd virtuous"). This inscription was painted in white above a window in old Kufic alphabet without any diacritical dots. Sections of the three-line inscription are still being translated. Walid Ibn Yazid, or Walid II, was an Umayyad caliph who reigned for a little over a year, from February 743 to April 744. The inscription, however, is missing the typical expressions used for Umayyad caliphs ("God's servant," "Prince of the Believers"), indicating that it was painted when Walid was still a prince, during the reign of Hisham bin Abd el-Malik (723–743). The current conservation campaign at Qusayr 'Amra began in 2009 with the goals of consolidating the structure and cleaning the mural paintings. The latter activity is revealing brilliant colors and unexpected details that can

The Confused Case of Algol as the Demon Star
Since the publication of Jerome Lettvin's article "The Gorgon's Eye" in the December, 1977, Technology Review (reprinted in the book Astronomy of the Ancients (1979) edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirtag), a number of people have assumed that it had been demonstrated that the ancient Greeks knew that the star Algol varied in brightness. Lettvin's paper ("The Gorgon's Eye") has been rightly criticized for being highly speculative. Regardless, other persons refer to a book by a Finnish researcher that Algol's variability is well-known in the skylore of the northern-Siberian people I initially thought this was likely to be Uno Holmberg's outstanding book Finnish-Ugric, Siberian Mythology (1927). Actually, the source is Shamanism and Culture by Juha Pentikäinen (1998). His claims are also doubtful. (Juha Pentikäinen, is now (2012) Professor Emeritus of Comparative Religion, University of Helsinki; Docent of Northern Ethnography and Culture, University of Lapland.)
Conference abstract (Celestial Aesthetics: The Aesthetics of Sky, Space and Heaven: 7th International Conference on Environmental Aesthetics, 26–28 March 2009, The Valamo Monastery, Heinävesi, Finland): "The following abstract is based on an article by Leena Tähtinen in the magazine Tiede in 2008. [Title:] The elk ran off to the sky. The starry sky of the ancient Finns was a stomping ground for international myths. Thanks to the shamans still active in Siberia, some of the millennia-old myths known from the mythologies of Egypt, Greece and Arabia, for example, can be localised in the current constellations. For ancient Finns, the sky was like a vault pierced with holes that turned around the pillar of the world. In the Kalevala it was called the speckled lid ('kirjokansi'). In Siberia, the Finno-Ugric culture has been conserved by deepfreezing, as it were. At 7 p.m. on 24 January 1990, the Khanty shaman Ivan Stepanovich Sopochin showed me a constellation representing a horned creature. Inside his hut he drew the outline of the figure in my notebook. The deer is related to the reindeer sacrifice and its rituals that guarantee the economic welfare of the Khanty living on the river Ob. Because of this, the myth about it is very important. According to the shaman, at the dawn of time, when life had only newly appeared on Earth, the deer had six legs. It was so swift that not even the best hunter could catch it. The son of the Earth God had tried for a long time, but in vain. One winter he approached the animal on a frozen lake, and it did not even try to flee. The hunter drew his knife and in his anger cut off the two hindmost legs of the deer. At the same time, he cursed the sixlegged horned animal as a mistake of his father, and conjured up a four-legged creature in the sky. Up there, it would have to show hunters the way in the dark. After my return to Finland I showed the constellation drawn by the Siberian to Tapio Markkanen, Docent of Astronomy at the University of Helsinki. Markkanen checked the position of the sky at 7 p.m. on 24 January, when the horned creature shone at the top of the sky on the Ob. The same place on the star map was occupied by two present-day constellations, Perseus and Cassiopeia. The double-V formed by Cassiopeia makes a handsome pair of horns for a celestial deer or elk. Perseus, in turn, consists of stars that are located between Cassiopeia and Capella, the brightest star in the Charioteer constellation. These are not stars that one normally attaches any attention to, but the rather faint

group of stars can easily be seen to form a body and legs for the horned head. The most interesting observation relates to the animal's legs. Close to them is Algol, a star belonging to Perseus, whose brightness regularly varies. Sometimes it is so faint that it cannot be seen at all with the naked eye. The peoples of north Siberia have noticed this variation, which was only discovered in the West in the late 1800s. This requires very close and accurate observation. Maybe the story about amputating the deer's legs actually started with the star that sometimes disappeared." The immediate problem is the statement: "Sometimes it is so faint that it cannot be seen at all with the naked eye." Algol changes from its usual magnitude of 2.1 to a magnitude of 3.4 in the middle of an eclipse. The professional folklorist Clive Tolley remarks (personal communication, 24 October 2014): "Juha Pentikäinen was excited by what the Khanty shaman Sopochin told him about this, and he got him to draw a picture, but when I quizzed Pentikäinen about exactly what stars were included, and which represented the two legs the elk lost, he couldn't really answer, as he hadn't bothered clarifying it with the shaman, and now we'll never know." Dr Clive Tolley is (2014) Docent, Department of Folkloristics, University of Turku, Finland.
An additional claim for ancient knowledge of the variability of Algol is related to a claim for the Hindu name of Algol. In his early article on Algol Stephen Wilks states: "More suggestive of ancient knowledge of Algol's variability is its rarely-cited Hindu name, Mayavati, meaning "The Changeful." The reference is to, Popular Hindu Astronomy (1905) by Kalinath Mukherji, a prominent Indian lawyer. A short but important critique of Mukherji's claims appears on page 123 of Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon (2000) by Stephen Wilk. Questioned is Mukherji's association of Mayavati with Algol (Mukherji is undecided whether the association can be made) and also Mukherji's translation of Mayavati as "The Changeful." It appears "the illusory one" is a more accurate translation. Interestingly, Traditions of the Seven RSIS (1982) by John Mitchiner; Page 43: "In astronomical terms, Arundhati – the wife of the Rsi Vasistha – is identified with Alcor, the small (almost invisible to the eye) [star] close beside ζ [Zeta] Ursa Major. A passage in the Adi Parvan of the Mahabharata offers an explanation for her being sometimes visible and sometimes invisible, saying that this is because she once doubted her husband Vasistha." [Mitchiner offers as reference: Brhat
samhita [6th-century CE Sanskrit Encyclopedia] 13.1-6 (but this reference seems irrelevant).]
The sinologist David Pankenier writes (2012): "In the Chinese context Algol is called 大陵五 (5th Star of the
asterism Great Tumulus (NB: or "mound," but not "mausoleum"), and the star is referred to individually as 叠尸 dieshi or earlier 積尸 jishi, both of which mean piled corpses, and evidently refer to the practice of piling up the corpses of the enemy dead as a grisly monument to victory. In the "Monograph on Astrology" (Tianwen zhi, ch. 1) of the History of the Jin Dynasty (265–420) 晉書, compiled early 7th c., one reads: "Within the Great Tumulus there is a star called Piled Corpses. When it is bright the dead are [piled high] as a mountain." The obvious implication is that the star is sometimes "not bright" but this is also said in reference to other stars and asterisms as well (for example, M44 Praesepe) presumably depending on seeing, so it is not conclusive evidence that Algol was being singled out for its variability. Adding to the potential for confusion, M44 was also sometimes referred to as "Piled Corpses", the surrounding square of stars in Cancer conventionally called Carriage Ghost (actually not originally a carriage but a spectral shape being conveyed in a sedan chair). M44 is obviously the "ghost"." The astronomer Robert van Gent commented (2012): " [The] ... apparent brightness changes of stars (and even groups of stars) mentioned in Chinese sources can not be taken as evidence that the ancient Chinese recognized their intrinsic variability but that they should be explained by variations in atmospheric extinction. This explanation also applies for stellar observations found in Babylonian astrological omen texts which in the past were also interpreted as evidence that the ancient Babylonians knew of the variability of Mira, Algol and other stars. These claims were refuted by N.T. Bobrovnikoff in ["The Discovery of Variable Stars." by Nicholas Bobrovnikoff (Isis, Volume 33, Number 6, June, 1942), Pages 687-689).]"
None of the sources, Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Islamic, Chinese, and medieval European, offer provide firm evidence that the variability of the brightness of Algol was known before the time of the 17thcentury Italian astronomer and optician Geminiano Montanari, who first recorded (circa 1667) his discovery of its variability. (Algol is a partially eclipsing binary.) Most claims are simply based on lack of research and on the simple assumption that the star's variability must have been known to ancient astronomers because it is a fairly bright star and its variability is so obvious to a modern naked-eye observer. There are a multitude of claims invoking the "known fact" that the star was referred to in the distant past as the "Winking Demon" or the "Blinking Demon". However, a search (using Google Books) made by Robert van Gent, the prominent

Dutch historian of astronomy, found the term "Winking Demon," linked to Algol, can only be traced back to 1882. Also, the earliest reference to Algol as a "Blinking Demon," can only be traced back to 1896.
The recent (2012) paper by Lauri Jetsu, et al. "Did the ancient Egyptians record the period of the eclipsing binary Algol - the Raging one?" has been criticized by astronomers Robert van Gent and Robert Zavala for failing to provide any firm/direct evidence that the ancient Egyptians actually kept track of variations in Algol’s brightness while offering prognostications - or were even actually observing Algol. (Lauri Jetsu (PhD (1994, Univ. Helsinki), Docent (1996, Univ. Helsinki), Docent (1997, Univ. Oulu)) is a lecturer, University of Helsinki, Finland.) See also recent (speculative) article: "Algol as Horus in the Cairo Calendar: the possible means and the motives of the observations." by Sebastian Porceddu, et al. (Open Astronomy, Volume 27, 2018, Pages 232-263). [Kindly brought to my attention by Aurélien Rolland.]
It would seem conclusive that there is no firm evidence for pre-telescopic knowledge of the fluctuation in brightness of Algol. It would seem conclusive there is no direct reference (or evidence of any kind) in Arabic-Islamic texts that they had knowledge of the anomalous behavior of Algol. Also, the Greeks never attributed a pulsing eye(s) to Medusa or her 2 sisters. The 3 Gorgons had deadly stares; not deadly blinks/winks.
The Greek myth states the Gorgons/Medusa stared - and in his essay Jerome Lettvin concedes this - but modern interpreters, Lettvin included, exercise some popular philological arguments, etc, to attribute blinking/winking. Lettvin concedes he has no support from Richard Allen's popular book Star-Names (1899) for this. Effectively, Lettvin attempts to argue that the deadly staring eyes of Medusa are represented astronomically as the blinking of Algol and possibly ρ Persei, even though he admits no ancient source states this. Very few persons have attempted to make the effort to identify why Arab-Islamic astronomers gave the name Algol (demon). The Arab-Islamic astronomers - as standard practice - usually gave complimentary names to the stars. For a 'demon' star Algol is quite placid - its only characteristic is to fluctuate in brightness.
The historian Jean Seznec (1905-1983), in his book, The Survival of Pagan Gods (1981 printing, Page 180), discussing types of errors in the transmission of iconography, wrote: "A typical example of the first case is the curious transformation of the Medusa head in the illustrations of astronomical manuscripts: the Arab copyist, knowing nothing of Greek mythology, mistook the blood dripping from the severed head for a bard, and changed the Gorgon into a hirsute [hairy] demon. [Note 74] His error is even perpetuated in the terminology of modern astronomers who still give the name Algol, meaning "demon," to the strange star in the constellation Perseus whose brightness varies periodically." [Note 74:] "See for example, cod. Vat. 8174, cod. Vondob. 5415 (sky map), and the Perseus of the lapidary of Alfonso X; a Sûfi ms., Paris, Bib. Nat. cod. Arab. 5036; a ms. of Qazwin; cod. Vindob 1437; Brit. Mus. Cod. Or. 5323 (fig 60)." It is indicated the matter is also discussed by Anthony Cárdenas in his paper: "Alfonso X's Appropriation of the Perseus Myth: History and Science." (Medievalia et Humanistica, New Series, Number 25, 1998, Pages 15-30).
According to Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart (A Dictionary of Modern Star Names (2nd edition, 2006, Page 49)) 'Algol' is one of the oldest Arabic star names applied in the West, from the end of the 10th-century CE. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic ra's al-ghūl meaning 'the Demon's Head,' for Ptolemy's Gorgon head.

"Ancient Egyptians described Algol's eclipses."
Summary: The Ancient Egyptian papyrus Cairo 86637 calendar is the oldest preserved historical document of naked eye observations of a variable star, the eclipsing binary Algol -- a manifestation of Horus, a god and a king. This calendar contains lucky or unlucky prognoses for each day of one year. Researchers have performed a statistical analysis of the Cairo Calendar mythological texts. Their analysis revealed that the periods of Algol (2.85 days) and the Moon (29.6 days) strongly regulate the actions of deities in this calendar. "Until now, there were only conjectures that many of the mythological texts of the Cairo Calendar describe astronomical phenomena. We can now unambiguously ascertain that throughout the whole year the actions of many deities in the Cairo Calendar are connected to the regular changes of Algol and the Moon," says Master of Science Sebastian Porceddu. This research confirms that the first variable star, as well as its period, were discovered much earlier than was previously thought. These two "classical" milestones in the

history of natural sciences need to be shifted three millennia backwards in time to 1244 -- 1163 BC. This also confirms the two "modern" astrophysical results reported by the Helsinki group in the year 2013: The first direct observation ever of the expected increase of Algol's period and the accurate long--term estimate for the mass transfer in this binary system. "I would have serious doubts, if someone claimed, for example, that the Bible contains information about water in Mars. We claimed that Ancient Egyptian religious texts contain astrophysical information about Algol. It was no surprise to us that there were, and there still are, skeptics," says docent Lauri Jetsu. The research also confirms that the brightest phases of Algol and the Moon had particularly positive meanings for the Ancient Egyptians.

Note: To avoid misunderstandings the term Arab-Islamic needs to be defined. Arabic is a linguistic term identifying Arabic language users and the use of Islamic has the sense of civilisation rather than religion. (The term Arab-Islamic = linguistic-cultural (those who wrote in Arabic); not ethnic-religious.)

29: Al-Sufi's star catalogue
A depiction of a Medieval Islamic astronomer. Thought by some to represent Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi. The instrument is a triquetrum; an ancient astronomical instrument for determining altitudes of celestial bodies. It was one of the most popular astronomical instruments until the invention of the telescope. It is related to the back-staff/cross-staff.
The illustration above is a section of a painting (miniature) showing astronomers working at the observatory of Taqi al-Din at Istanbul circa 1577. In the entire 16th-century picture of Taqi al-Din's observatory there are 16 persons, illustrating all activities with instruments in the observatory. (None of the instruments have come down to the present-day. However, some of the manuscripts depicted on the bookshelf are now in the University Library, Leiden.) The particular painting is from the epic poem Shahinshah-nama by 'Ala ad-Din Mansur-Shiazi. It was written in honour of Sultan Murad III who reigned from 1574 to 1595. Though it is common to speak of Arabic astronomy the more correct term would be Arab-Islamic astronomy. Many of the astronomers (and peoples) were not Arabs but were from the regions of (modern-day) Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Arabic was the scientific language and lingua franca for followers of the Islamic religion. The language of the religion was Arabic. It is correct to speak of Greek science being passed to the Arabs. Arab rulers of Arab states, for example the 'Umayyad dynasty (which collapsed in the 740s), funded and patronised the transmission process through Syriac sources. The 'Abbasid dynasty which followed can also be considered as an Arab regime.

A page from Al-Sufi's book on the constellations Kitab suwar al-kawakib (Book of the constellations of the Fixed Stars). The book was written for and dedicated to the Buwayhid ruler Fana Khusrau, titled Adud alDawla (made Emir of Iraq in 949 CE and died in 982 CE), who was a great patron of astronomy and had erected an observatory at Shiraz. Al-Sufi’s main source for his treatise is the star-catalogue compiled by the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy (called "BatlamiyUs" in Arabic). Ptolemy's star-catalogue was included in his major work Mathematika Syntaxis. In the preface to Kitab suwar al-kawakib, al-Sufi mentions that he referred to as many translations of the Almagest as he could find, having noticed discrepancies between them. Paul Kunitzsch has noted that al-Sufi's treatise mostly follows the wording of Isliaq b. Ijunayn's translation, but obtains star-positions from a range of versions.
Al-Sufi (al-Sûfi) was one of the greatest Islamic astronomers of the medieval period.
Al-Sufi’s best known (and most important) work is Kitab suwar al-kawakib (Book of the constellations of the Fixed Stars). "Fixed Stars" is a term describing the stars, which were thought to be fixed to the surface of a large celestial sphere, turning around the Earth. (The "Wandering Stars" are the planets, which were seen to move independently and at different paces, across the celestial sphere.) Al-Sufi's work on the Fixed Stars is one of the most important works of Islamic uranography. The book is based on Ptolemy's Mathematike Syntaxis (Almagest).
The Greek constellation set was readily adopted in the Islamic Middle Ages. (Islamic astronomy was a mixture of indigenous work, together with Indian, Persian, and Greek astronomy.) Knowledge of the fixed stars in Greek-based Arab-Islamic astronomy was derived mainly from Ptolemy's Almagest which contained a catalogue of 1025 stars arranged in 48 constellations (circa 150 CE). The first critical revision of Ptolemy's catalogue of fixed stars was carried out by al-Sufi. However, al-Sufi adopted Ptolemy's basic scheme and pattern of constellations. He did not add or subtract stars from Ptolemy's star list and neither did he remeasure their (frequently incorrect) positions. (Al Sufi’s constellation maps were based mostly on the star tables of Ptolemy's Almagest. Al Sufi’s book has quite precise coordinates and illustrations of the 48

constellations described by Ptolemy.) Also, though al-Sufi based his constellation drawings (figures) on the classical Aratean tradition his figures have a distinct oriental character.
Arabic translations of Ptolemy’s Mathematika Syntaxis were made during the 9th-century, including those of Sahi al-Tabari, al-Hajjãj b. Yusuf b. Matar, and Isaq b. llunayn (died 877 CE), whose 827/828 CE version was later corrected by Thäbit b. Qurra (died 90 l CE).
Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (Al-Sufi; known in Western Europe by the Latinized name Azophi) was born in 903 CE in Rayy (near modern Tehran), Persia and died in 986 CE. Al-Sufi lived and worked mostly in Isfahan (Persia) at the court of Emir Adud ad-Daula. (He worked in both Isfahan (Iran) and Baghdad (Iraq).) He is most widely known, and became most influential, for his translation and partial revision of Ptolemy's star catalogue as the Book of the constellations of the Fixed Stars (Kitab suwar al-kawakib). It was published circa 964 CE and it was frequently copied and translated. It had considerable influence on European astronomy.
Al-Sufi was both a translator and author. He was involved in translating Hellenistic astronomical works (that had been centred in Alexandria) into Arabic, especially Ptolemy's Almagest. He wrote numerous works on astronomical, astrological, and mathematical subjects. His most outstanding work is his illustrated book on the constellations (Kitab suwar al-kawakib). In this work he comprehensively describes the 48 classical constellations, which were established by Ptolemy and transmitted to the Islamic world in translations of Ptolemy's Almagest. Like all other Islamic scholars of the period he wrote all his works in Arabic (the scientific language of the Arab-Islamic world). In producing his own version of the star catalogue in Ptolemy's Almagest al-Sufi introduced many traditional Arabic star names. (Most star names used by al-Sufi (and his contemporaries) were direct translations of Ptolemy's descriptions.) It was the first attempt to relate (integrate/synthesise) the Greek stars of Ptolemy's star catalogue with the indigenous (traditional) Arabic star names and constellations (the Arab anwa tradition). As a result of Greek translations into Arabic in the 8th and 9th centuries the Greek constellation traditions and the old Arabian traditions became mixed together. In the 10th-century al-Sufi made a special effort to separate the 2 star traditions. In his book, al-Sufi usually gave the name and position of each star in the Greek tradition first and then supplemented that with Arabian traditions about the particular star. (Information concerning the traditional Arabic stars were appended by alSufi to his descriptions of the first 5 of the 48 Ptolemaic constellations.) The Bedouin Arabs regarded single stars as representing people and animals. Many of the the original meanings of the named stars had been forgotten by the time of al-Sufi. Because some of the Arabic star names were centuries old their meanings were lost to al-Sufi and his contemporaries, and they remain unknown today. When al-Sufi published Book of the constellations of the Fixed Stars, his own version of Ptolemy's star catalogue in the Almagest (not its original Greek title), he introduced many individual star names. Another problem is that al-Sufi used anwa texts from the Islamic period as his sources. This somewhat limits their connection with indigenous preIslamic Arabic anwa traditions.
Al-Sufi was a friend and teacher of the Buyid sultan 'Adud al-Dawlah to whom he dedicated the book. In the introductory chapter al-Sufi states it was the desire of this prince to know the fixed stars, their position within the constellation figures and in relation to the zodiac, which induced him to write the book. The original copy of al-Sufi's manuscript is no longer extant.
At least one later copyist included an index of the constellations at the beginning of the manuscript. An index of the constellations was not originally part of al-Sufi's work.
In Kitab suwar al-kawakib the description of each constellation comprises the following four sections: (1) A general discussion of the constellation and its individual stars. Also included in this section is al-Sufi's criticism of the Ptolemaic tradition and also notices of al-Sufi's own observations. (He described all the stars catalogued by Ptolemy and added his own criticism in each individual case.) (2) A record of the indigenous Arabic star names (predating Arabic contact with Greek astronomical science) falling within each constellation, and the exact identification of each of these stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. (3) Two drawings (paintings) of the constellations, one depicting the constellation as it is seen on the celestial globe (i.e., as seen by an observer looking inwards towards earth), and the other one as it is seen in the sky (i.e., as seen by an observer looking outwards from earth). (Elly Dekker labels the different views "sky view" versus "globe view.") (4) A table of the stars making up each of the constellations, including a verbal description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and magnitude. (The magnitudes given were

according to al-Sufi's own observations.) This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star catalogue in the Almagest. In this book al-Sufi also described the boundaries of the constellations.
In al-Sufi's Kitab suwar al-kawakib the constellation figures and the individual stars comprising them are shown separately (i.e., separated from each other) without any information on their relative positions being given. No sky map (with all the constellations charted) appears in the book. An important development was al-Sufi numbered the individual stars in each of his constellation drawings. The catalogue of star coordinates given by al-Sufi is believed to be Ptolemy's star catalogue (coordinates) updated for precession.
Al-Sufi had the intention to integrate Ptolemy's star catalogue with Arab star tradition and terminology, and also to define boundaries for the constellations. The constellation drawings in Al-Sufi's catalogue comprising Kitab suwar al-kawakib quickly became canonical. This influence was later introduced into Europe.
Al-Sufi's book on the constellations (and the constellation drawings contained in it) served as models for further work on the fixed stars in the Arab-Islamic world for many centuries. His description of the constellations became the basis for all later studies. (Al-Sufi's drawings of the constellation figures established a standard typology for the constellations - in Europe too.) Islamic constellation figures were introduced into Europe as least as early as the 13th-century. It is stated by some sources that al-Sufi's Kitab suwar al-kawakib was never translated into Latin. This is incorrect. A fully illustrated translation was (anonymously?) made in Palermo, Sicily, in the 12th-century at the instigation of Guillaumine II (11661189).the Norman king of Sicily. (A Latin manuscript of it, titled Liber de locis stellarum fixarum, now resides at the Arsenal Library in Paris as part of MS # 1036 (a collection of astronomical manuscripts with the general title Liber de stellis stellarum). The Liber de locis stellarum fixarum contains 49 illustrations representing the constellations and the signs of the zodiac. The Arabic-Persian iconography, based on characters in the One Thousand and One Nights story, is kept. The Parisian copy, made anonymously, is the oldest existing Latin copy. It is dated to the third quarter of the 13th-century and is believed to be a copy of the translation made earlier in Sicily. (It is sometimes identified as being made from a manuscript in Spain.) (The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, at his court in Palermo, Sicily, financed translations of Arabic works into Latin.) Al-Sufi's book was also fully translated into Spanish by Alfonso X ("Alfonso the Wise") of Leon and Castile, as Libros del Saber de Astronomia. It was through these translations that it influenced the star names of used in western Europe. Its contents were transmitted into Europe and in medieval Europe its constellation drawings were imitated in numerous Latin astronomical manuscripts.
Petrus Apianus (Peter Apian) (1495-1552) the 16th-century German astronomer and geographer took star names from al-Sufi's book on the constellations and placed them on his star charts and mentioned them in his writings. (See the chapter on the constellations in his Astronomicum Caesareum (1540).)
It has been long believed that al-Sufi's book on the constellations was the (exclusive) key source for the establishment of star names in western Europe. (Note: A few proper star names, such as Polaris (North Star), are not Arabic.) However, this now appears to be over-simplified and somewhat incorrect. The science historian Owen Gingerich writes ("Islamic Astronomy," Scientific American, Volume 254, April, 1986, Pages 68-?): "It now seems that his [i.e., Ptolemy's] 14th- and 15th-century Latin translators went to a Latin version of the Arabic edition of Ptolemy himself for the star descriptions, which they combined with al-Sufi's splendid pictorial representations of the constellations. Meanwhile the Arabic star nomenclature trickled into the West by another route: the making of astrolabes." (Some of these astrolabes have distorted Arabic names for stars.)
The astrolabe, essentially a two-dimensional model of the sky, was originally a Greek invention (dating circa 3rd-century BCE) to enable the problems of spherical astronomy (i.e., the prediction of star positions) to be solved. It moved with the spread of Islam through North Africa into Spain (Andalusia). It would appear that England, due to the scientific activity centred at Oxford, was the conduit for the introduction of the astrolabe from Spain into western Europe in the late 13th-century and the 14th-century.
Historians have not settled the debate over who was responsible for the transmission of the astrolabe from Muslim Spain into Europe and when and where the astrolabe first appeared in Europe. However, by 1030 CE at the latest some European scholars possessed astrolabes and were teaching their use. Early Christian recipients of Arab astronomy (including the astrolabe) included Gerbert of Aurillac and Hermannus Contractus. Gerbert of Aurillac (circa 946-1003 CE) (later to become Pope Sylvester II (999-1003 CE))

spent several years (967-969 CE) studying in Spain in the Christian-held city of Barcelona and also possibly in the Moorish-held cities of Córdoba and Seville. (He originally went to the cathedral school of Vic, in the province of Catalonia which was on the frontier of Moorish Spain. As a result there was considerable communication between Catalunya and the Muslims of al-Andalus to the south.) It is thought that Gerbert of Aurillac may have been the author of a description of the astrolabe ( The Book of the Astrolabe which was the first Latin text explaining the astrolabe and providing instructions for the construction of an astrolabe) that was edited by the Benedictine monk Hermannus Contractus (1013-1054 CE) some 50 years later.
Many of these early astrolabes that were introduced into Europe carried both Arabic and Latin star nomenclature. It has been noted by Paul Kunitzsch that star names that appear on medieval astrolabes in Europe are often quite different from star names that appear in star lists in medieval manuscripts. The astrolabe was widely used in Europe during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance with its popularity peaking in the 15th- and 16th-centuries. (The astrolabes of the 11th-16th centuries were an important instrument for predicting star positions.) It became one of the basic astronomical education tools. Europeans eventually began to manufacture astrolabes. In the 15th-century European astrolabe manufacturing was centred in Augsberg and Nuremberg in Germany, with some manufacturing also in France. By the middle of the 17th-century astrolabes were being manufactured all over Europe.
(The astrolabe was a 'flattened' and more portable version of the armillary sphere. It was a two-dimensional representation of the celestial sphere and was used for solving problems in celestial geography.)
Islamic astronomical globes also became highly prized in medieval western Europe. Some were purchased and used without translation of Arabic terms as Arabic was a scientific language in medieval Europe. Some were purchased and copied with the names of stars and constellations being translated into Latin versions of Arabic. Arabic was frequently used on European globes along with other scientific languages. Globes were manufactured and used with astronomical terms in Latin, Greek, and Arabic. (Astronomical globes were popular in the Arab-Islamic world.)
European astronomers and celestial map makers began to use Arabic star names in preference to Latin names circa 12th-century CE. This practice kept on increasing with the increasing ease of European access to Islamic texts and instruments. By the end of the 15th-century the process of European adoption of Arabic star names was essentially complete. (According to Emilie Savage-Smith it has been established that a nearly complete Arabic version of al-Sufi's treatise on the constellations must have reached Germany by the 1530's, for information in it was employed in a limited way by Peter Apian, who from 1527 to 1552 was professor of mathematics at the University of Ingolstadt.) The "Arabic" names were retained in the formal, scientific nomenclature until the end of the 19th-century.
Latinised Arabic star names were well established in Europe by the time Johann Bayer published his Uranometria in 1603. Bayer did not make any attempt at reforming this practice of denoting star names. The most relevant feature of Bayer's atlas was his recording of popular names for important stars, drawn from the works of Ptolemy and his successors, to assure that all known stars could be identified with those he had listed in his atlas. Bayer also introduced the use of lower case Greek letters to name and organise the stars. However, the Bayer system is full of inaccuracies.
Al-Sufi's star catalogue was in turn revised by the the 15th-century Timurid governor (of Transoxiana and Turkestan) and astronomer Ulugh Beg, at his observatory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The most important star catalogue of Islamic astronomy is that of Ulugh Beg in the early 15th-century CE.
Appendix 1:
Richard Allen in his highly influential book Star-Names and Their Meanings (1899) stated that European star names came chiefly from the Arabs. Allen, who had no real understanding of Arabic, also concluded that many Arabic star-names were actually translations of Greek descriptive terms transmitted through Arabic into Latin (and from Latin into English and other languages). When the linguist Maio Pei made a check of 183 English star-names he concluded that 125 were from Arabic, and 9 were from Arabic-Latin. (See: Story of the English Language by Mario Pei (1967; Page 225).) Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart (A Dictionary of Modern Star Names (2006; Page 11) write: "A statistical analysis of the 254 star names here presented reveals that (counting five double entries only once) 175 names (= 70%) are Arabic and 47 (= 19%) are are Greek or Latin." The modern authority on such matters is Paul Kunitzsch.

Appendix 2:
"The star names used in the classical Islamic world were derived from two distinct sources: (1) the various (non-standardised) names originated by pre-Islamic groups of Bedouins (the nomadic desert Arabs of the Arabic Peninsula) (older body), and the main body (younger group) of indigenous Arabic star/asterism names were probably formed in the period 500-700 CE (prior to the introduction of Islam in the 7th-century CE); and (2) those transmitted from the Greek world. As Greek astronomy and astrology were accepted and elaborated, primarily through the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Almagest, the indigenous Bedouin star groupings were overlaid with the Ptolemaic constellations that we recognize today." (Islamicate Celestial Globes by Emilie Savage-Smith (1985) Page 114.) "A third set of names derived from the Arabic were bestowals, often ill-based, by early modern Western astronomers even though they had never been used by Arabian astronomers. Most of these names have disappeared. Thuban, alpha Draconis, is an exception." (Early Astronomy by William O'Neill (1986) Page 162.) (Some European astronomers inventing their own constellations also invented their own Arabic star names. The earliest likely example is the Dutch orientalist and mathematician Jacob Golius (1596-1667).) Both Emilie Savage-Smith and William O'Neill are reliant on the fundamental studies of Paul Kunitzsch. An example of the first category of star names of Arabic origin is Aldebaran from Al-Dabaran. An example of the second category of star names of Arabic origin is Fomalhaut from Fam al-Hut. An example of the third category of star names derived from Arabic is Thuban, alpha Draconis.
Appendix 3:
There have been very few translations from the Arabic of Al-Sufi's Kitab suwar al-kawakib. In 1831, the preface was published in Arabic with accompanying French translation, by Michel Caussin, who referred to Ar2488 (13th-century CE), Ar2489 (dated 1266 CE), and Ar2490 (dated 1516 CE), of which all three are in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. In 1874, H. C. F. Schjellerup published a full translation of the text, also into French, using Ms83 (dated 1601 CE) in the Royal Library of Copenhagen, and Ms191 (dated 1606 CE) in the Institute of Oriental Studies, St Petersburg. A critical edition of the Arabic text was published in Hyderabad, in 1954 by the Dãiratu'1-Marif-i1-Osmania, based mainly on Ar5036 (circa 1437 CE), in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, but also collated with Bodleian Marshl44 (dated 1009-1010 CE), Topkapi A.3493 (dated 1131 CE), Vatican Ross. 1033 (dated 1224 CE), Berlin Staatsbibliothek A.5658 (dated 1233 CE) and Asafiya, Hyderabad (date ?). The edition included the text of the Urjüza on the constellations (purportedly written by a1-Sufi's son), translated extracts from the Preface to Schjellerup's translation of 1874, and plates from 8 al-Sufi manuscripts, including British Library Or.5323. Paul Kunitzsch perceptively noted the 1954 publication is "deplorably rich in misprints and other errors." In 1969, the 1250 CE Persian translation of al-Sufi's treatise was published in facsimile, as Tarjama-i suwar-i kawakib. In 1986, the earliest known copy of Kitab suwar al-kawakib, (dated 1009-1010 CE, Marshl44, Bodleian Library Oxford) was also published in facsimile by the Institute for the History of Arabic-Islamic Science in Frankfurt. In 2010, Ihsan Hafez completed his PhD thesis, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi and his book of the fixed stars: a journey of rediscovery (the first English translation of al-Sufi's star atlas).
Appendix 4:
Al-Sufi's Kitab suwar al-kawakib is a catalogue of the names of individual stars and star-groups from the system of Arabian folk astronomy. He includes mention of the Anwã' constellations, a group of 28 individual stars and small constellations along the ecliptic, which constituted a calendar and meteorological system. Paul Kunitzsch proposed a new assessment of al-Sufi's account of Arab star-names pointing out that al-Sufi uncritically depended on the premise that the Arabian astronomy literature he consulted was indeed a correct account of the names used by the Bedouins. The only literature available to him consisted of these imprecise sources (in terms of astronomical information) as poetry and lexicography, in which al-Sufi simply assumed that all this material made genuine references to actual stars and star-groups. Some of the lore did derive from authentic tradition. However, according to Paul Kunizsch this may only be said for one sixth of the recorded material. The rest consisted mainly of invention or distortion by poets, who sometimes recorded variants of star-names with poetic license. A star-name might appear in a poem as a simile, and then also be distorted to fit the meter. Unfortunately, al-Sufi took all references to star-names as read, and introduced them uncritically to scientific literature, "in many cases arbitrarily fixing a rather fluid tradition." His account was thereafter accepted as authoritative, and became a standard reference for the subject. Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria published in 1603 CE referred to both al-Sufi and Ptolemy, and established modem usage.

2022. 02. 21. 20:20 History of Constellation and Star Names
Appendix 5:
Al-Sufi also clarifies previous scholarship on native Arab astronomy. Al-Sufi cites the names of individual stars and constellations in native Arabic astronomical tradition, which lie within (or across) each given classical constellation. This pre-Islamic tradition mapped the sky into constellations, some of which are considerably larger than the Greek ones, and are earlier versions of Mesopotamian constellations that were later to form part of the 12-constellation zodiac. Specific identification is given for both individual stars, and those arranged in collective groups. Also, explanations are offered for unusual names, and common errors are pointed out. Occasionally al-Sufi repeats folk proverbs or beliefs around the star-names and he also explains that accounts from folk astronomy are often contradictory as to the exact identity of certain stars. He also remarks that recorded information on folk astronomy has been set down by people unfamiliar with both Arab folk astronomy and "scientific" classical astronomy.
Appendix 6:
Various similarities between the Phaenomena and Kitab suwar al-kawakib show that the latter is in many ways the Islamic world's answer to the Western classic of popular astronomy, presented in a more scientific manner, and strengthened with the updated, revised versions of Ptolemy's star-tables. The Phaenomena was translated into Arabic in the early 9th-century CE, probably by the Jewish astronomer Sahi b. Bishr, at the court of Abu'l-Tayyib Tahir b. al-Ijusayn. (died 822/823 CE), (general of Caliph al-Ma'mUn, and later the governor of Khurasän). Aratus was well-known to Severus Sebokht, the bishop of Kennesrin (one of the leading figures of ecclesiastical, philosophical, and scientific culture of late antique Syria), who quotes liberally from the Phaenomena in his treatise on the constellations, written in 661 CE.
"Severus made two major contributions to astronomy. The first (written in 660 CE), a Treatise on the Astrolabe, is based on a lost work by Theon of Alexandria, the contents of which Severus preserved in his own work. ... Severus's other astronomical work (generally entitled Treatise on the Constellations ) was written in 660, subsequent to that on the astrolabe. Eighteen original chapters are extant. The work begins with five chapters forming a scientific critique of astrological and poetic claims about the origins and significance of the constellations. In them, Severus shows that the figures of the constellations are not arranged in the heavens through natural means but rather are a result of human imagination. Importantly, Chapter 4 features extracts from the Phaenomena of Aratus concerning many of the constellations. The remaining 13 chapters (6–18) are devoted to a scientific analysis of the heavens and the Earth. (Article: Severus Sebokht by John McMahon, in The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers edited by Thomas Hockey et. al. (2007, Pages 1044-1045).)"

O : Modern Western Constellations
30: Gherardo of Cremona
Shown above are pages of a translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic to Latin (an Arabic-Latin version) by Gherardo (Gerard) of Cremona (Lombardy) in 1175. The pages show Ptolemy's description of his kinematic model for the motion of the superior planets - Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (Book X, Chapters 67). The above manuscript book is held in the Vatican library. The translation into Latin by Gherardo (Gerard) of Cremona was a very popular translation.
The translation movement in Latin Europe surged soon after the re-conquest of Toledo, which opened up important centres of Islamic Spain (1085). The fall of Antioch also opened up the Islamic and Greek culture of the Eastern Mediterranean (1098). The process of translation took several forms. The translator basically had 2 choices. As example regarding Arabic texts: He could translate text from the original manuscript directly, or rely on the text to be spoken by an Arabic speaker/reader i.e., an oral interpretation of the text. (According to Roger Bacon, many people understood the spoken forms of Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, even if they could not read and write the languages.) Both methods were used to translate Arabic texts. It was not

unusual for the text to be spoken orally by an Arabic speaker/reader and the translator to work from this interpretation. Translators who are said said to have had the help of Arabic speakers include: Gerard of Cremona who was helped by "Galippus" (a Mozarab), Alfred of Shareshill who was helped by "Salomon Avenraza" (a Jew), and whom Alfred of Shareshill mentions as his teacher, and Michael Scotus who was helped by "Abuteus levita."
Gerard of Cremona (circa 1114-circa1187), accessing Arab libraries in Toledo, translated 71 books from Arabic into Latin; 12 on astronomy.
Ptolemy's Almagest was first translated into Arabic circa 827. The first competent (clear), thorough, nonmathematical (descriptive) summary of Ptolemy's Almagest into Arabic was carried out by the Egyptian astronomer and geographer Abd al-Abbas al-Farghani. Its title was Elements of Astronomy and was written in the period between 833 and 857. Al-Farghani was born in Farghana (present-day Fergana), Uzbekistan, and died in Egypt. He was a member of the House of Wisdom established by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mūn in the 9th-century. The House of Wisdom in Baghdad became the centre for both the work of translating and of research.
The first contacts of (Latin-speaking) Europeans with Arab-Islamic science dates to late 10th-century CE Catalonia (Spain).
Paul Kunitzsch proposes that the Arabic title "al-Majisti" and "Almagest" (= "greatest treatise") derives from a Pahlavi (Middle Persian) form. The Arabic-transliterated title betrays the route by which the Syntaxis reached Europe. Although a Latin translation of the Almagest was made from a Greek manuscript in Sicily, circa 116O CE, this version was not disseminated. Rather, Arabic translations were the means by which this major astronomical work of Ptolemy was reintroduced to Europe, until Greek manuscripts became available in Renaissance times. In Toledo, in 1175 CE, Gherardo of Cremona finished translating the text into Latin from Arabic, and this version was the most popular in medieval Europe.
The retransmitted Latin translation of Ptolemy's Almagest by Gherardo of Cremona in the 12th-century began the distorted use of Greek-Arabic-Latin words that appear in modern lists of star names. In Greek astronomy the stars within the constellation figures were usually not given individual names. (An exception was made for a few of the brighter stars.) Ptolemy did not identify the stars in his catalogue with Greek letters, as is done by modern astronomers. Each of the 1025 stars listed by Ptolemy (Book VII and Book VIII of the Almagest) was identified (1) descriptively by its position within one of the 48 constellation figures; then (2) by its ecliptic latitude and longitude; and then (3) its magnitude. When the Arabic astronomers translated Ptolemy's Almagest, and adopted the Greek constellations, they also applied their own star names to the listed stars. Beginning with Gherardo, when the Arabic texts of the Almagest were translated into Latin, the Arabic star names were retained but were frequently translated in a corrupted form. The medieval European astronomers adopted the system of using individual (Arabic) star names in their uranography. Hence the star names we use today were essentially introduced by the medieval European translators of Arabic texts of Ptolemy's Almagest, the translation from Arabic to Spanish of al-Sufi's Book of the constellations of the Fixed Stars (Kitab suwar al-kawākib), and also by the introduction of hundreds of Arabic astrolabes into Europe during this period.
The principal channel for the recovery of the Almagest in Western Europe was the Arabic to Latin translation by Gherardo of Cremona. It was made at Toledo using several Arabic versions and completed no later than 1175. Numerous copies of the work were made. It was widely circulated in manuscript copies before appearing as a printed book in 1515. (The European printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440.) Gherardo's translation was the only version of Ptolemy's Almagest known in Western Europe until the later discovery of copies of the original Greek texts and their translation into Latin texts in the 15th-century. However, Gherardo's translation is very literal and hard to follow. (Some translations from the Greek text were, however, made in medieval times. Ptolemy's Almagest in the original Greek continued to be copied and studied in the eastern (Byzantine) empire. Some years earlier to Gherardo's translation, circa 1160, a very literal translation of Ptolemy's Almagest was made directly from the Greek text into Latin by an unknown translator in Sicily. However, this particular version had little circulation and made no effect. The copy in the Vatican library came through the great Florentine book collector Coluccio Salutati.) In the 15thcentury European scholars, first George of Trebizond and then Johannes Regiomontanus, independently translated Ptolemy's Almagest from copies of the original Greek text.

Avner Ben-Zaken writes (Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean, 1560-1660 (2010, Page 2)): "Early modern European intellectual history started, arguably with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Greek texts flowed into Europe, giving Europeans access to classical texts previously known only through Arabic and Hebrew translations. Scholars promptly embarked on retranslations of classical works."
Gherardo of Cremona was born in Cremona, Lombardy (Italy) circa 1114 and died in Toledo in 1187. He is most famous as the translator of Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic texts found in Toledo. In the 12th-century, Gerard of Cremona translated the Almagest in Toledo from Arabic into Latin using several Arabic translations. Books I–IX of his translation are based on the work of al-Hajj ibn Matar except for the star catalog in the books VII.5–VIII.1, which derives from a text mixing 2 Arabic translations. The remaining 3 books of Gerard's translation are derived from the work of Ishāq ibn Hunayn and Thābit ibn Qurra. The date he went to Toledo (Spain) is uncertain but was no later than 1144. His specific initial intention was to learn Arabic so that he could read Ptolemy's Almagest. (Gerardo had left Italy mainly in quest of Ptolemy's Almagest.) At the time known copies of Ptolemy's Almagest only existed in the Islamic world (in Arabic and Syriac (a pre-Islamic language of ancient Syria). Even though no Latin copies existed up to the 12th-century it retained its traditional high reputation among European scholars. Gherardo was one of a small group of European scholars who revitalised medieval European astronomy in the 12th-century by transmitting Greek and Arabic science texts to the West in the form of translations into Latin. Gherardo remained in Toledo for 30 years and continued to make Latin translations of Arabic scientific texts until his death. He made over 70 translations. (It was Islam's conquest of Spain that would bring the seeds of modern astronomy to Europe.)
During the 12th-century Toledo was a multi-cultural city, an important centre of Arab and Jewish culture, and full of libraries and manuscripts. Some libraries there were reputed to hold up to 400,000 manuscripts. Thousands of texts were available for purchase from booksellers. Toledo became a centre for educational studies of Arabic scientific and literary texts. King Alfonso VI of Castile, with the aid of El Cid, had taken Toledo (and the surrounding region) from the Moors in 1085. Prior to this Toledo had been a provincial capital in the caliphate of Cordoba. In the following decades many European scholars who had mastered Arabic began the task of translating Arabic books into Latin. The Moors had arrived in Toledo in 712 CE. During the 12th-century Toledo also became the Christian base for driving the Moors out of southern Spain. It is estimated that up to 1,000,000 Arabic books were burnt when the Catholic monarchs regained control of Moorish Spain. The southern Spanish cities of Toledo, Cordova, and Seville became the most important centres for the transmission of Arabic scientific texts into medieval Europe. (Other important centres were located in Southern Italy and Sicily at Salerno, Monte Cassino (a Benedictine monastery), Palermo, and Syracuse. Copies of Ptolemy's Almagest were translated into Latin both in Spain and in Sicily. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, at his court in Palermo, Sicily, financed translations of Arabic works into Latin.) During the 1140s leading European church figures such as Abbot Sugar (Abbot of St-Denis, statesman and historian) (circa 1081-1151) and Peter of Montboissier (Peter the Venerable, General of the Benedictine Order) (1092-1156) expressed the belief that before fighting an enemy, one must first understand them. This led to the systematic translation of Arab-Islamic writings into Latin.
What resulted in Europe was a polyglot system of Greek constellations with Latin names containing stars with (largely) Arabic titles.
With the expulsion of the Moors from Spain the availability of Arab-Islamic texts in Europe via Spain ceased.
Appendix 1: First Sicilian School of Translators
The Norman conquest of southern Italy and Sicily took place in the 11-century. Its cultural achievements were brief and are now largely unremembered. In the 12th-century the Norman kingdom of Sicily was one of the strongest and wealthiest states in Europe.
The Norman conquest of Sicily with its Greek and Arabic-speaking population (1072–1091) was an impetus to the establishment of the translation movement there.
In southern Italy and Sicily royal patronage played an important role in supporting translators/translations. The earliest Latin version of the Almagest was made in Sicily by the so-called First Sicilian School of Translators. This was established under the king Roger II and continued under his son William I. Roger II of

Sicily was a Norman count who took the title king in 1130 CE. The Norman Sicily of king Roger II (10951154) and William I (1125-1166) represents an important route for the transmission of classical heritage and Arab knowledge. Roger II was educated by exponents of Graeco-Byzantine culture. Roger II had been educated by Greek preceptors in Palermo and his court in his capital city of Palermo was a mixture of Greek, Arab and Latin elements. (This was later diminished by the actions of his son William I, who promoted Latin culture. William I initiated a process of 'de-hellenisation.' The reign of William I also resulted in a decline in the influence of Byzantine culture as a model worthy of imitation.)
The first cultural interactions between the Latin West and the Greek East began taking place in the 12thcentury, principally in Constantinople (where several Italian city-states had trading concessions), and Norman Sicily. (The presence of the Venetians and the numerous foreign marriages both attest to closer ties and increasing traffic between Constantinople and the West.) A few translations from Greek to Latin had been done in Italy during the 6th-century. The most notable of these were some works on logic by Aristotle which were translated by the Roman senator and philosopher Anicius Boethius in the early 6th-century CE. Boethius (circa 480-524 CE) was a court official (Magister Officiorum) under Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths (ruler of post-Roman Italy). Boethius had an ambitious program for the translation of Greek texts (mainly those of Aristotle and Plato) into Latin. However, the program ceased when he was charged with treason and eventually executed. It can never be known how much Boethius would have accomplished if he had not met a premature death. In 523, less than a year after being named Magister Officiorum by king Theodoric, Boethius was charged with treason, hastily and perhaps illegally tried, and executed in 526. No further translations from Greek to Latin were done until the 12th-century.
A Latin translation of the Almagest was made from a Greek manuscript in Sicily, circa 1160 CE, but this version was apparently not widely disseminated (and so its influence was less important than the later copy by Gerard of Cremona, who belonged to the School of Translators at Toledo, Spain). Apparently Sicily was still largely Greek-speaking at this time. The gift of a copy of a Greek manuscript of the Almagest was taken to Sicily by Henry Aristippus (from 1156 the archdeacon of Catania cathedral), who had received it as a gift to the Sicilian king Roger II from the Byzantine Emperor Manuel Comnenus. As well as being archdeacon, Aristippus also served as envoy to the court of Manuel Comnenus. From an embassy (diplomatic mission) to Constantinople in 1158-1160, Aristippus brought back several Greek manuscripts as a diplomatic present from the Emperor Comnenus (Komnenos). Comnenus presented Aristippus with a beautiful codex of Ptolemy's Almagest as a gift to king William 1 (though most sources state it was for king Roger II). It is usual for sources to state the translation was made at Roger II's court by Herman of Carinthia. (Aristippus was not Greek, nor was Greek his native tongue. However, he was an excellent translator.)
Note: The French medievalist/philologist Richard Lemay dated the translation to circa 1150 CE.
The diplomatic gift/present of Greek manuscripts is usually identified as being for Roger II. However, several scholars identify the gift/present as being for king William I. (Roger II reigned 1130-1154; his son William I reigned 1154-1166.) Earlier there had been hostilities between Roger II and Comnenus. Comnenus had even secured an alliance with the German king Conrad III, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had married, against Roger II of Sicily. Western Europeans were able to acquire (Greek) manuscripts at Constantinople. Interestingly, Roger II used Byzantine symbols of lordship and when on military campaigns sought to behave like a Byzantine general.
The Graeco-Latin translation was assisted by Emir Eugene of Palermo whose native language was Greek. Eugene/Eugenius was an amitatus (high ranking civil official) who was highly skilled in Greek and Arabic and highly competent in Latin. Interesting is the existence of at least one Greek manuscript of Ptolemy's Almagest in Europe at this time. Also interesting is Ravenna was important in history as the capital of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th-century CE and later (6th–8th century) of Ostrogothic and Byzantine Italy. As the capital of the Exarchate of Ravenna, the city was the administrative centre of Byzantine government in Italy. In the 8th-century, Ravenna was the Italian centre of the Byzantine world.
Roger II was interested in natural science. William I continued his father's patronage of learning. The court at Palermo under William I (king of Naples and Sicily) was also a centre of Greek studies in philosophy and natural science.

With the beginning of the universities a process of Latinisation of the middle class was in place. It had become common for civil servants to obtain academic degrees, and these were obtained through institutions that taught in Latin. By the time of Frederic II the interest was in Arabic science and philosophy rather than Hellenic culture. Frederick II (1194-1250) was a Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily. His enormous political and cultural ambitions, based in Sicily, extended through Italy to Germany, and to Jerusalem. The Norman connection with Greek and Byzantine culture was eventually severed i.e., by the early 13th-century. The influence of the cathedral school of Chartres - the so-called School of Chartres, attached to the famous Chartres Cathedral near Paris - during the first half of the 12th-century is well established. It was the focus of Christian Neoplatonism and humanism.
From the early middle ages onwards, Salerno (south-western Italy) had been a centre of medical study, from where Graeco-Arabic knowledge had been spread to Western Europe. The English philosopher and translator Adelard of Bath also worked in Salerno.
The manuscript of the Almagest translated in Sicily was inherited by Charles of Anjou, who then donated his library to the Papacy in 1266. The modern Vatican Library was not founded until 1475, and previous collections were often dispersed. Thus, the manuscript of the Almagest subsequently ended up in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice. While interest in Greek and in making translations may be unsurprising in the South of Italy, we also see the first signs of it further north with James of Venice (circa 1130/1170) and Burgundio of Pisa (circa 1110-1193) acquired manuscripts, travelling to Constantinople, and beginning to make Greek to Latin translations.

Paduan manuscript, Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (BSB), clm. 10268, datable to ca. 1320; and the oldest manuscript containing an illustrated version of the Liber de signis is the north-Italian manuscript in St. Petersburg, which bears a date of 1348.
The constellation figure Orion illustrated in the Leiden Aratea. This figure shows the Aratean tradition of constellation illustration. In the Leiden Aratea, a 9th-century Latin version of the Phaenomena, some constellations are depicted as they are seen in the sky, and others as seen on a globe, apparently at random. In many of the more symmetrical constellations (such as Cancer, the crab), it is not possible to tell whether the globe or sky view is being presented, as the random distribution of stars offers no indication. The term Aratea (or Aratea carmina/Carmina Aratea) basically refers to 3 classical Latin translations; those of Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus. In their use of Latin vocabulary and references to Roman life all 3 were distinctly Roman Phaenomena. (See: Lewis, Anne-Marie. (1983, unpublished PhD thesis). From Aratus to the Aratus Latinus: A Comparative Study of Latin Translation.) These surviving Aratea were gradually joined by multiple medieval renderings of Aratus' Phaenomena. The term Aratea now applies to a body of texts that comprise more than 60 manuscripts (and ilustrations). The Aratea was almost the only source for medieval readers to gain information about stellar astronomy.
During the 13th-century a new tradition of constellation imagery was introduced based on Latin translations/knowledge of Arabic texts describing the Ptolemaic constellations.
The works of Michael Scotus (Scot) on the constellations, and his manner of illustrating them, caused a lengthy eclipse of Aratea during the latter Middle Ages. Michael Scotus' popular handbook for lay-people, Liber introductorius (circa mid 13th-century) formed the basis of one of the most popular traditions of constellation iconography of the 14th and 15th centuries, particularly in Italy and German lands. Scot also introduced some new constellations, perhaps taken from Arabic sources.
During the 13th-century the revival of European interest in astrology saw new images of the planets devised. The most influential of these were the illustrations devised by Michael Scotus and included in his astrological treatise Liber introductorius. These were based on Arabic interpretations of the classical gods. Scotus' planet iconography was used by the painter Giotto in his frescoes in the Salone in Padua. (Also, the constellation iconography was not closely aligned to Aratean tradition.)
In the 15th-century, the majority of the manuscripts referring to the constellations are astrological in content and included mostly the constellation illustrations devised by Michael Scotus. Michael Scot's particular renderings of the constellations became known across Europe through the transmission of manuscripts. Also, Some medieval scribes had the habit of using the images normally attached to one text to illustrate another.

The constellation illustrations had little astronomical reality and were being used to show the details that were supposed to be important for their astrological interpretation.
Prior to the mid 15th-century star maps tended to be used to illustrate text in books. Free-standing celestial images were quite rare (and accuracy was usually sacrificed for art). During the Middle Ages pictures appeared illustrating the individual constellations. In these illustrations the classical constellations were separated from the celestial globe and also the individual constellation stars were often omitted. (The astrologer Michael Scot (Scotus), a contemporary of Peter of Abano (circa 1250-1310), included constellation figures in the margins of his 2-volume book on astronomy/astrology.) In the high Middle Ages, unlike the previous periods, the ancient constellation figures were transformed by illuminators to an almost unrecognisable degree. Traditional (classical) constellation representation (per the pseudo-classical Carolingian forms) was influenced by Romanesque and Germanic (Gothic) forms (and also Graeco-Arabic forms). (The end result was the classical subject matter was divorced from its classical form.) The height of this transformation of classical constellation representation occurred during the 13th-century.
Patrons and artists commissioning and creating manuscripts in the 15th-century CE designed/created and implemented entirely new constellations and astrological illustrations. However, some constellation cycles, such as the Aratea of Cicero and Germanicus retained their traditional images based on Late Antique prototypes and the astronomy of Aratus. But their poetic text became corrupted through the centuries.
In England the school of astrology under the leadership of the mathematician, philosopher, and scholar Michael Scotus (Scot) (born circa 1175 - died circa 1234/5) replaced the Aratean tradition almost completely. His book Liber de signis (containing a section on the constellations) set out a new set of constellations that differed from the set of 48 Ptolemaic constellations. Others imitated his new scheme of constellations. For example he was followed by Bartholomew of Parma in his Breviloquium de fructu tocius astronomie. (Bartholomew of Parma flourished circa late 13th-century and early 14th-century. Parma is a city in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna.) This new constellation set appears to have originated from 12th-century CE elaborations of literal translations of Islamic-Arabic texts (on astrology).
For his new constellations Michael Scotus borrowed from Arab-Islamic sources images of the constellations that had their origins in the Sphaera Barbarica. (Especially the decans and paranatellons.) The art historian Fritz Saxl, under the influence of Aby Warburg, believed he had shown that the representations of the planetary gods in the works of Michael Scotus can be traced back through Arab-Islamic sources to ancient Babylonian sources. Basically, Saxl argued that the Arab-Islamic figures of the planets reflect the Babylonian gods: Nebo (= Mercury), Ishtar (= Venus), Ninib (= Mars), Marduk (= Jupiter), and Nergal (= Saturn). The transmission of an uninterrupted textual transmission was made possible by the survival, in certain isolated districts of Mesopotamia, of groups that invoked the Babylonian planetary gods and venerated their images, such as the Harranite Sabeans. Planetary illustrations in Arab-Islamic manuscripts match the planetary effigies which adorned Harranite sanctuaries. (The Harran region encompassed southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria.) The Arab-Islamic book the Picatrix, which was an essential intermediary in the transmission of Babylonian planetary figures, was a translation of the 11th-century CE book on magic, the Ghâya. The Picatrix, likely written circa 1200 CE, was translated in to Latin and was well known in Western Europe. The book had a major influence on magical thinking in Western Europe, especially from circa 1400 to circa 1600.
The illustrations introduced by Michael Scotus were an attempt at adaptation and fusion; an effort to make European forms out of the astral gods/goddesses of ancient Babylon. In this they shown the influence of Romanesque and Germanic (Gothic) forms.
Michael Scotus was both a translator (Toledo) and an original writer (court of Frederick II). The investigation of his life and scholarly achievements remains in its early stages yet. Scotus' life was divided between translations and original works. During the mid 1220s Scotus enjoyed the patronage of the popes Honorius III and Gregory IX. Beginning no later than 1228 and until his death circa1234/5, he was active in the court of Frederick II.
Michael Scotus, who (as the surname signifies) was born in Scotland, lived mostly in France, Spain, and Sicily. In 1230 he visited Oxford, England where he had spent time studying as a young student. In his illustrations of the constellations he combined Graeco-Arabic and mythological imagery with Latin Aratean

tradition. His illustrations of constellations supplanted the classical types of the Carolingian tradition. His work on the illustration of the constellation figures was very influential until the Renaissance period. Also, Michael Scotus undoubtedly had access to earlier, popular star lore. (During the Middle Ages in Western Europe classical mythological subjects were not usually represented within the limits of the classical style. The artistic forms under which classical concepts were continued during the Middle Ages were utterly different from the classical style.) During the Gothic period in Europe (circa 1100-1450 CE) there was a disinterest in illuminated astrological manuscripts.
It is probable that Michael Scotus (a polymath) was the finest intellect at the court of Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250) in Palermo, Sicily. He was a dominant figure among the scholars at Emperor Frederick II's court even though his career there lasted for only about 4 years. He had gone there circa 1200 in the role of "court astrologer" after being enticed by the Norman king Frederick II to join his court in Sicily. (There is little evidence for Fredrick II having an interest in astrology. The title of Imperial Astrologer was given to Michael Scotus in the colophon to his Astronomia. Emperor Frederic II and his court in Southern Italy were renowned for promoting the sciences. In the Medieval period of Western Europe royal courts were the centre of literary production.) Michael Scotus then left (circa 1209) to work at the great Arab translation centre in Toledo (Spain) and then returned again to Sicily circa 1220. He came there as a translator of Arabic texts, doctor, astronomer, alchemist, and astrologer. On his return he gave his attention to science and medicine. He remained there until his death. (He died when some church masonry fell on him.) Though Frederick II was the ruler of both Germany and Sicily he preferred to live in Sicily. In 1220 he acquired the title of Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It was in Sicily at this period that tolerance enabled the coexistence of European and Arab scholars. Arab scholars worked in Sicily.
The astrological text written by Michael Scotus (and containing his illustrations of the constellations) was widely copied throughout the late medieval period. In the 15th-century most manuscripts referring to the constellations are astrological. The constellation illustrations in these mostly follow those devised by Michael Scot. Also, the constellation illustrations show details that are important for their astrological interpretation. However, by 1500 this text seems to have become somewhat forgotten. (But, it appears that in the early 1500s the most readily available pictorial source for constellation illustration was Michael Scotusbased illustrations.) His texts include: Liber introductorius, Liber particularis, Liber phisionomie [the short title of this medical treatise is: Physionomia], and Liber de signis. In his two later books which followed Astronomia, the Liber introductorius (written at the request of Frederick II) and the Liber particularis, he set out a popular exposition of both astrology and astronomy. (In the Liber introductorius he included pictures of the signs of the zodiac of the Sphaera Barbarica.) The extraordinary increase in the prestige of astrology in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages was due to the introduction of Arab-Islamic philosophy and science into Sicily and Spain.
The early parts of his Liber introductorius, most ambitious book, are concerned with astronomy, but lead to astrology. The figures of the constellations and planets in the illustrated Munich manuscript (Munich, cod. lat. 10268, 14th-/15th-century, held in the Staatsbibliothek) and the illustrated Oxford manuscript (Oxford, MS. Bodley 266, held in the Bodleian Library), both incomplete, represent an antique tradition which is attributed by Franz Boll to the scholia of Germanicus.
It is worth noting that a series of astrological pictures in Liber introductorius were identified by both Franz Boll and Fritz Saxl as a (further) development away from the the classical tradition of the GermanicusAratus manuscripts. A number of the astrological pictures are considered to be largely the work of Michael Scotus himself, or his particular alterations. (A 14th-century manuscript at Basle (F.II.33, fols. 37v-41r) carries the break by Michael Scotus with the Germanicus-Aratus tradition even further.) Michael Scotus' constellation iconography in Liber introductorius has similarities with the manuscript Madrid 19. It was Georg Thiele (Antike Himmelsbilder, 1898) who first identified the 12th-century CE manuscript Madrid 19 (Manuscript Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, Ms 19) as the direct source for Michael Scotus' Liber de signis. As Thiele rightly identified, there is evidence that Michael Scotus knew at least some parts of Madrid 19, and similar manuscripts. Note: Recent work has has shown that the arguments that Madrid 19 itself was the actual manuscript used by to complete his text reveals a considerable number of pictorial differences. However, this does not alter the identification of a series of distinctive readings found in Madrid 19 which were an influence on Scot's text. (See the discussion in Lippincott, 2017.)

Intriguingly, however, the woodblock images in the first illustrated edition of the text (Venice: E.

The reintroduction of Aratea by Albert Dürer

A sky map (planisphere) depiction of the northern sky by Albrecht (Albert) Dürer (printed in 1515). The constellation figures are portrayed in a classical style. The Western tradition of making celestial maps can be traced back, through Arabic/Islamic sources, to Classical (i.e., Greek) origins, and earlier Babylonian origins. Albrecht Dürer's 2 celestial maps, Northern Hemisphere and another of the Southern Hemisphere, derive from an Arabic type that depicted each hemisphere separately. His direct source was two richly decorated manuscript charts of the stars made anonymously in Nuremberg in 1503. Dürer's own additions to that design include the portraits of early astronomers in each corner: Aratus Cilix, Ptolemeus Aegyptius (Ptolemy), M. Mamlius Romanus (Marcus Manilius), and Azophi Arabus (Al-Sufi).
The Renaissance period (at its height circa 1450-1550 CE) saw the reinstatement of the Aratean tradition of constellation illustration. (This could be described as the intention to reinstate 'mythological correctness.' This saw illustrators and artists turn to the pre-gothic period - to models closer to Graeco-Roman classical antiquity.) The Renaissance period saw a search for order amongst multiple transmissions of astrological works. Many illustrators began altering the non-classical constellation figures, such as those found in the astronomical/astrological manuscripts of Michael Scotus, with representations that looked more classical. In this they were strongly influence by the constellation depictions in the early 16th-century star charts drawn by Albrecht Dürer. (During the 15th-century CE German artists once again began to copy Carolingian manuscripts. An example of a relatively pure source of classical forms were the illustrations in the Carolingian copy of the 'Roman 'Calendar of 354.') During the Renaissance astronomical manuscripts obtained from Sicily provided an absolute standard for the illustration of the constellations. The process of importing constellation figures (with classical features) from Italy to Germany had begun circa 1450 CE. These constellation figures were beginning to be incorporated into stars charts produced in Germany prior to Dürer's constellation figures being developed.
Ultimately, the depictions of the constellations of post-Renaissance Europe derive from the constellation figures of the artist and engraver Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528). Albrecht Dürer was a native of Nürnberg (Nuremberg), Germany. (His father was Hungarian.) In 1515, in cooperation with Johannes Stabius and Conrad Heinfogel, he produced the first (scientifically rigorous) printed star charts (and they are considered the first modern star charts). The northern star chart (planisphere) was titled Imagines Coeli Septentrionales and the southern star chart (planisphere) was titled Imagines Coeli Meridionales. These mapped the constellations and the key stars of both the northern and southern heavens quite accurately. The depictions of the constellations on the celestial map designed by Dürer were astronomically accurate and mythologically correct per the Aratean tradition. The constellation figures were portrayed in a classical style and this was followed by later European star chart makers. Dürer was an artist - not an astronomer. The constellations are depicted from the point of view of an external observer looking in towards the earth. It appears a key influence on Dürer were the depictions of constellation figures on Arab-Islamic celestial globes. (Because the Arab-Islamic constellation figures were neither Classical nor contemporary European the Latin illustrators basically ignored them and simply followed the text-descriptions of the constellations to make

contemporary images.) On both of Dürer's sky maps (planispheres) the classical constellation figures appear with their classical attributes correctly drawn. The Durer planispheres were never included in a printed book.
According to Emilie Savage-Smith, the Viennese parchment map of 1440, titled De composicione spere solide, and the globe of 1480 (exhibiting Bedouin and Islamic features), probably made by Hans Dorn, a Dominican monk in Vienna, served as a source (prototype) for Albrecht Dürer's woodcut celestial maps completed in 1515. (The Viennese parchment map of 1440 and the globe of 1480 bear a striking resemblance to each other.) Dürer omitted the Latinised Arabic star names, and the polar circle and colure. Importantly, the iconography was even more Westernised by Dürer. The Lyra is rendered as a bird with a musical box over its head. (Dürer did not understand the classical iconography for Lyra.)
Located in each of the corners of the star map for the northern hemisphere is a portrait of four traditional authorities on celestial matters (including Ptolemy and al-Sūfi), each in the act of using a celestial globe.
These star maps were reprinted numerous times (and Dürer's style was copied by numerous 16th-century star map makers) and the star charts were disseminated throughout 16th-century Europe. They were innovative for the 16th-century in combining accuracy of star placement with classical constellation figures. Both star maps were produced under the patronage of Emperor Maximilian I.
The production of the star maps were the result of close cooperation between Johannes Stabius (mathematician and cartographer of Vienna in Austria), Conrad Heinfogel (astronomer), and Albrecht Dürer (artist). The accuracy of the star positions was due to Johannes Stabius and Conrad Heinfogel who plotted the star positions. The star chart projection was designed by Johannes Stabius and he also determined the stellar coordinates. The stars were placed by Conrad Heinfogel who calculated their positions on the maps. The constellations were drawn by Albrecht Dürer, who was the key influence on the constellation figures used. The star maps were ordered by Johannes Stabius who demanded they be made on the basis of a manuscript from 1503 written by Conrad Heinfogel (and others).
Located in the bottom left-hand corner of the star map for the southern hemisphere are the names and coats of arms for all three co-authors. A short description of what each of them contributed to the work appears on the opposite side of the chart. (The coat of arms for Emperor Maximilian I appears in the top left-hand corner.)
After Albrecht Durer published the first rigorous celestial charts in 1515 numerous other persons in Europe published accurate detailed star atlases.

No illustrated manuscripts of Hipparchus' star catalogue of Aratus' Phaenomena are known to have survived. All but 1 of the early illustrated manuscripts of Aratus' Phaenomena are in Latin. In some cases - from the Carolingian period onwards - constellation images were completely redesigned without reference to preexisting iconography.
(2) There are still gaps in our knowledge of classical images of the constellations and their transmission throughout the Middle ages and Renaissance. However, the idea of the Renaissance as a revival of classical antiquity is no longer held. In regard to constellation iconography Saxl's idea of medieval deterioration followed by Renaissance restoration is incorrect. According to Dieter Blume it is no longer obvious that there once was a consistent set of classical constellation images that could be considered a standard by which subsequent deviations could be measured. It appears there were different parallel and occasional intertwining traditions.
(3) Warburg-Saxl-Panofsky at the Warburg Institute held that the classical constellation tradition/iconography changed as it passed into Arabic, Persian, and Indian civilizations. The historian Seznec relied heavily on the ideas of Warburg-Saxl at the Warburg Institute. Saxl formulated his theory about the transmission of classical constellation iconography in his introduction to Verzeichnis astrologischer und mythologischer illustrierter Handschriften des lateinischen Mittelalters (Volume 2, 1927). However, more recent work by the science historian Kristen Lippincott establishes a reversal of this viewpoint. Lippincott holds that "the Eastern artists actually maintained the classical astronomical tradition much more faithfully than their Western counterparts."
(4) Rembrandt Duits states the Arabic constellation iconography when reintroduced into Europe from the 13th-century onwards gradually replaced the images from the existing Western Aratea tradition in astrological illustrations. The illustrations devised by Michael Scotus were an important influence. The mid 12th-century German manuscript, Vienna ÖNB 12600 (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, 12600, fol. 25r., De ordine ac positione stellarium in signis), had departed from classical prototypes. It is not an astrological manuscript but an astronomical manuscript; an illustrated catalogue of 42 constellations (traceable back to the Aratea of Hyginus).

O: Modern Western Constellations
32: The constellating of the southern sky
Depiction of the southern constellations in the (original edition of) Harmonia Macrocosmica of the DutchGerman mathematician and cosmographer Andreas Cellarius (circa 1595-1665). The Harmonia Macrocosmica was a folio-sized work first published in 1660. It was a major celestial atlas and considered one of the most spectacular celestial atlases published in the second half of the seventeenth century. Andreas Cellarius was born in Germany but latter settled in Holland.

The southern hemisphere is "richer" in stars and apparent star configurations than the northern hemisphere.
The charting of the Southern Hemisphere created the need for new constellations. The 48 classical constellations of the Greeks did not map the entire celestial sphere. Until the end of the 16th-century CE European star charts contained only the 48 constellations canonised by Ptolemy in the 2nd-century CE. The stars of the southern sky which did not rise above the horizon of the ancient Greeks remained un-constellated on European celestial maps until the European voyages to the southern hemisphere in the 16th-century. The 16th-centuy has been termed the Age of Exploration. During the 16th- and 17th-centuries the Dutch, French, and English (and Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian navigators) made numerous voyages of discovery to the southern hemisphere. The result is the origin of the constellations surrounding the South Pole is involved in some obscurity.
Little useful knowledge of the southern stars was contributed by the early exploratory voyages of the Italian Amerigo Vespucci (1454-1512), the Italian Andrea Corsali (1487-1524), and the Spaniard Pedro de Medina (1493-1567). At the end of the 16th-century, European knowledge of the southern sky was still vague. In 1501 the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci charted what seems to have been Alpha and Beta Centauri and the stars of Crux. However, the most accurate early depiction was made by the Italian navigator Andrea Corsali in 1515. In more modern times explorers of the southern oceans used the Crux (as they called it) as an important guide as the lowest pointer always points to the South.
The largest contribution to new constellations came from the early European sea voyages to the southern hemisphere. The process of constellating the southern celestial sky was begun by Petrus Plancius (Dutch: Pieter Platvoet) (1552-1622). He included 2 new southern constellations (Crux (as a separate constellation, the stars of which are given in Ptolemy's Almagest) and Triangulus Antarcticus (Eridanus continued from Ptolemy's 34th star to α Eridani)) on his sky globe published in 1589 and then 2 more (Columba (the stars of which are given in Ptolemy's Almagest) and Polophylax (the figure of a man consisting of 7 stars)) on his sky globe published in 1592. These constellations appeared on his 1594 map of the world (the earliest existing map of the southern heavens) entitled "Orbis terrarum typus de integro multis in locis emendatus Pedro Plancio, 1594." Of the 10 constellations invented by Petrus Plancius 3 (2?/4?) are still recognised today. (Sources vary on this issue.) These are Monoceros, Columba, and Camelopardalis. (Petrus Plancius was one of the founders of, and advisors to, the Dutch East India Company.)
An influential voyage for the invention and naming of southern constellation on European sky maps was the 1st Dutch trading expedition of 4 ships which left Holland for the East Indies in 1595. A 2nd Dutch voyage which sailed in 1598 for the East Indies was important for the accuracy of its observations. The duration of the 1st trading expedition was April 1595-August 1597. (In 1596 the south pole star was Tau Octantis (Octantis = the constellation Octans), positioned about  ̋ degree (more exactly 31') from the Pole. However, it was too faint for the Dutch to see from Jakarta - the magnitude of Tau Octantis with extinction was approximately 7.1. Beta Hydri (Plancius called one of his new constellations Hydrus Polaris) was the closest bright star to the Pole, manitude 3.4 with extinction, but is was over 10 degrees away from it.) The chief pilot (navigator) on the Hollandia (later on the Mauritius) was Pieter Dirckszoon Keyzer [also spelled Keyser] (circa 1540-1596). The Dutch navigator Pieter Keyzer was adept in both mathematics and astronomy and his cooperation to chart the southern sky was sought by the Amsterdam geographer and theologian Petrus Plancius. Plancius devised a scientific program for Keyzer that also appears to have included 3 other persons on the expedition. Keyzer was trained by Petrus Plancius to chart (using an astrolabe given to him by Plancius or navigator's cross-staff) the southern stars in the then constellation-free zone around the south celestial pole. Probably he mapped the stars of the southern sky from Madagascar and also perhaps near the island of Sumatra. The 4 expeditionary ships arrived in Madagascar in September 1595 and remained anchored there for several months. It appears that Keyzer conducted his observations from the crow's nest. It is considered the instrument used is most likely to have been an astrolabium catholicum (universal astrolabe). Keyzer was apparently assisted in his observations by the Dutch navigator Frederick de Houtman (1571-1627), the younger brother of Cornelis de Houtman, the expedition's leader. The scientific program instigated by Plancius is indicated as comprising/including not only Keyzer and Houtman but also Vechter Willemsz (the original pilot of the Mauritius) and Pieter Stockmans. Willemsz died during the voyage in January 1596, after the fleet had left Madagascar. Keyzer died during the voyage (in September 1596) while the trading fleet was at Banten (western Java). When the trading fleet returned to Holland in 1597 his catalogue of 135 stars, divided into 12 newly invented constellations, was given by Houtman to Plancius who then added these constellations to his sky globe published in 1598. It was the first catalogue of the southern stars with any

pretence to accuracy. (Another version (incorrect) is that Plancius used Keyzer's data to form 12 new southern constellations and these were added to his 1598 globe. However, the version still exists that Plancius used the survey information to delineate 12 new constellations around the celestial south pole.) Petrus Plancius is the likely source for the southern constellations depicted in Johann Bayer's Uranometria.
Plancius called one of his new constellations Hydrus Polaris, Beta Hydri was the closest bright star to the south celestial pole (magnitude 3.4 with extinction) but it was still over 10 degrees away from it. (Prior to the voyages and observations of the 15th and 16th centuries a general belief prevailed in Europe that the southern heavens contained a constellation similar to Ursa Major (Big Dipper) near the pole. For example: the Roman poet and astrologer Marcus Manilius (flourished 1st-century CE).)
According to de Houtman he initially made some observations of the southern stars on his first voyage in 1595-1597; and during his 2nd voyage in 1598-1602 he revised and increased the number of coordinates.
The 12 southern constellations created by Frederick de Houtman (and likely Keyzer and also Plancius for visualising the iconography) were: (1) Apus (Dutch: De Paradijs Voghel), (2) Chamaeleon (Dutch: Het Chameljoen), (3) Dorado (Dutch: Den Dorado), (4) Grus (Dutch: Den Reygher), (5) Hydrus (Dutch: De Water slang), (6) Indus (Dutch: De Indiaen), (7) Musca (Dutch: De Vlieghe), (8) Pavo (Dutch: De Pauw), (9) Phoenix (Dutch: Den voghel Fenicx), (10) Triangulum Australe (Dutch: Den Zuyder Trianghel), (11) Tucana (Dutch: Den Indiaenschen Exster, op Indiesch ghenaemt Tucan), and (12) Volans (Dutch: De vlieghende). Some are named after exotic birds such as the toucan, peacock, and phoenix.
(1) Apus is a faint constellation whose name means "no feet" in Greek, and it represents a bird-of-paradise (once believed to lack feet). It first appeared on a 35 cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. (2) Chamaeleon is named after the chameleon, a kind of lizard. (3) Dorado remains as one of the 88 modern constellations. Dorado has been represented historically as a dolphinfish and a swordfish. (4) Grus is Latin for the crane, a species of bird. The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish). (5) Hydrus' name means "male water snake." (6) Indus represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of Asia or the Americas. (7) Musca is one of the minor southern constellations. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. (8) Pavo is Latin for peacock. (9) Phoenix is a minor southern constellation, named after the mythical phoenix. It was the largest of the 12. (10) Triangulum Australe is Latin for "the southern triangle," which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its 3 brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. (11) Tucana is Latin for the toucan, a South American bird. (12) Volans represents a flying fish; its name is a shortened form of its original name, Piscis Volans.
Camelopardalis was created by Plancius in 1613 to represent the animal Rebecca rode to marry Isaac in the Bible. One year later, Jakob Bartsch featured it in his atlas. Johannes Hevelius gave it the official name of "Camelopardus" or "Camelopardalis" because he saw the constellation's many faint stars as the spots of a giraffe. Monoceros is a relatively modern creation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by Plancius in 1612 or 1613. It was later charted by Bartsch as Unicornus in his 1624 star chart.
Initially the new southern hemisphere constellations appeared on a few celestial globes (1598 globe by Petrus Plancius, 1600 globe (some versions state 1599 or 1601) by Jodocus Hondius, and 1603 globe by Willem Blaeu.) Petrus Plancius was a Dutch theologian and cartographer; Jodocus Hondius (= Jodocus de Hondt Senior) (1563-1612) was a Dutch cartographer; and Willem Blaeu (1571-1638) was also a Dutch cartographer. Jodocus Hondius included Petrus Plancius' new southern constellations on the celestial globe he published in 1600. (The 1598 globe by Petrus Plancius contained the 12 new Dutch non classical constellations plus constellations he invented. No copies of this globe are known to have survived to the present-day.)
On Blaeu's first 2 celestial globes of circa 1598 the region around the celestial south pole had to be left empty as the results from Keyzer and de Houtman survey were either not yet available or were copyright protected. Not to be outdone by his competitor Hondius, Blaeu requested Frederick de Houtman to undertake a second and improved survey of the southern skies during a (2nd) trade journey to the East Indies organised by merchants from the town of Middelburg, which sailed March 1598. He and his brother Cornelis sailed again

for the East Indies, with Frederick as captain of one of the ships. This expedition proved to be much less successful than the first. His elder brother Cornelis was killed and Frederick de Houtman only managed to return to Holland in July 1602, after he and several other crew members had been held captive for 26 months by the Sultan of Atjeh on the island of Sumatra. During his imprisonment Frederick de Houtman studied the local Malay language and also observed the southern stars. The location of Houtman during his 26 months of incarceration was northern Sumatra (approximately 5.5° north). From this location he would be unable to observe the immediate region of the southern celestial pole. The region of the south celestial pole was observed during his 1st voyage, likely by Keyzer and likely when the small fleet was anchored at Madagascar. It appears not to have been done during his 2nd voyage. Meanwhile, Blaeu, who had been working on a new celestial globe and was anxiously awaiting the results of de Houtman's new survey, finally decided he could wait no longer and, in direct violation of the exclusive rights of Plancius, blatantly copied the new constellations from the Hondius globe onto his own globe of 1602. When de Houtman did return in the summer of 1602 this globe was published with a dedication mentioning that the charted stars around the southern region of the celestial globe had been derived from de Houtman's 2nd survey, while they were in fact based on the 1st survey. However, within a year the results of de Houtman's survey had been abridged and published (as an appendix to de Houtman's Malay and Madagascan vocabulary) and Blaeu was able to publish a reissue of his 1st celestial globe that was truly based on the 2nd survey. It is indicated that Houtman had kept his own copy of the observations made. After Keyzer's death, Houtman was likely the custodian and collator of the team's observations. (The first catalogues/globes of southern stars with any pretence to accuracy were those based on the 2nd survey of the Dutch navigator Frederick de Houtman, published in 1603. This 2nd survey was reprinted by Edward Knoebel in MNRAS, Volume 77, 1917, Pages 421-430. The southernmost star in Houtman's 2nd survey was Beta Octantis (apparent magnitude 4.14, declination -83° 40'.)
These constellation figures were immediately copied from the Hondius and/or Blaeu globes by Johann Bayer in his Uranometria (1603). Bayer did not add southern constellations of his own.
The first celestial atlas to include the 12 new southern constellations was the Uranometria by Johann Bayer (a German astronomer) published in 1603. Their appearance in plate 49 of Johann Bayer's celestial atlas canonised their acceptance and use. According to Elly Dekker, Bayer simply copied the star positions from the celestial globes published by Hondius in 1600 and 1601. The Uranometria is considered the first great celestial atlas. It contained a separate plate for each of the 48 traditional constellation figures. It was also based on Tycho Brahe's newly determined star positions and magnitudes. (In his atlas Johann Bayer also devised a cohesive system for designating (labelling) the stars.)
In 1603 Frederick de Houtman (1571-1627) published a Catalogue of Southern Stars at the end of his Malay and Madagascan vocabulary (as an appendix), entitled Spraeckende woordboeck Inde Maleysche ende Madagaskarche Talen met vele Arabische ende Turksche woorden. (Publishing navigational information as part of a language dictionary was practical.) Houtman's catalogue consists of the right ascensions, declinations, and magnitudes of 303 stars. (Houtman listed 304 stars but did not give coordinates for a star in the tail of the constellation Scorpius.) However, 107 stars were already given in Ptolemy's Almagest. The other 196 stars were new discoveries. Interestingly, Houtman did not mention the work of Keyzer. It may be because of a dispute that occurred between Keyzer and the Houtman brothers. It may also explain why Plancius never referred to Houtman's observations. Keyzer was Plancius' deputy in the initial observing program. The astronomer Edward Knobel ("On Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue of Southern Stars, and the Origin of the Southern constellations." (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1917, Volume 77, Pages 414-432.)) concluded that Frederick de Houtman had published as his own work the southern sky observations of the recently deceased navigator Pieter Dircksz Keyzer. This conclusion was researched and supported by the astronomer Helen Hogg (Out of Old Books - "Pieter Dircksz Keijser, Delineator of the Southern Constellations." (Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, 1951, Volume 45, Pages 215-220)). Only about 6 remaining copies of Houtman's catalogue/survey are known. In 1927 the British astronomers Herbert Turner (1861-1930) and Edward Knobel (1841-1930, a businessman and amateur astronomer) privately published a facsimile copy of it.
Plate 49 of Johann Bayer's Uranometria shows the constellations Phoenix, Hydrus, Tucana, Grus, Indus, Pavo, Apus, Triangulum Australe, Musca, Chamćleon, Volans, and Doradus. Bayer stated that these particular constellations were observed partly by Amerigo Vespucci, partly by Andrea Corsali and Pedro de Medina, but their places were determined by Petrus Theodorus. (In reality Amerigo Vespucci (Sensuyt le nouveau monde

et navigations faictes par Emeric de Vespuce (1510)) contributed no constellations. Andrea Corsali (in two letters dated 1517) described the Greater and Lesser Magellanic Clouds, the 5 stars forming the Southern Cross, and 13 other stars which cannot be identified. Pedro de Medina (Arte de navegar (1545) only makes mention to the stars in the Crux (i.e., determining latitude in the southern hemisphere by observations of α Crucis.) In his Celestial globe, published in 1603, Willem Blaeu attributed all of these constellations to Frederick de Houtman. The eminent astronomer and historian Ludwig Ideler gave equal merit to Petrus Theodorus and Frederick de Houtman. (Note: The Cosmografia by Pedro de Medina (which was published in 1545) was the first European navigation manual written. The Book of Useful Information on the Principles and Rules of Navigation published in 1490 by the Arabic scholar Ahmad ibn Majid was the first occidental navigation manual published.)
In 1612 Petrus Plancius published a new sky globe and introduced his 3 newly invented southern constellations Camelopardalis, Columba, and Monoceros.
A later celestial atlas that introduced new constellations was the Firmamentum Sobiescianum by Johannes Hevelius (a German-Polish astronomer, 1611-1687) published posthumously in 1690. It contained 56 large, double page star maps and improved the accuracy in the position of the southern stars. He introduced 10(11?) more constellations. They were listed in his star catalogue dated 1687 and were depicted on his accompanying star atlas called Firmamentum Sobiescianum, both published posthumously in 1690. The 10 new constellations introduced by Hevelius were all north sky constellations - filling the remaining gaps in the northern sky. Although Hevelius introduced new constellations, he didn't add any southern constellations that were his own as his atlas was largely based on the stars that were visible from his observatory at Dantzig (Poland). He did, however, include a few maps of the southern hemisphere with the constellations of Keyzer/De Houtman and the constellation Robur Caroli introduced in 1677 by Edmund Halley. The atlas was engraved by Johannes Hevelius himself to accompany his catalogue of over 1500 star positions (and the catalogue was also published posthumously in 1690). Seven of the new constellations (visible from midnorthern latitudes) invented by Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687) are still recognized today by the International Astronomical union. One of the new constellations included Sextens (the sextant) named for one of his own astronomical instruments (and based on the octant, a measuring instrument). He made very accurate stellar coordinate observations without the use of telescopes. A fine facsimile of his star atlas was published in the 1960's in Tashkent (Uzbekistan).
The French astronomer and surveyor Nicolas Louis de LaCaille (1713-1762) invented 14 southern sky constellations which became standard and are still recognized today. The majority of these new constellations were named after new scientific inventions. Following his visit to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) in 1750 he introduced them in the Memoires of the Académie Royale des Sciences in 1752 (published in 1756). In his southern star catalogue Coelum Australe Stelliferum, which was published posthumously in 1763) he also introduced the division of Argo Navis into 4 parts, the 4 smaller constellations named Vela (the sail), Pyxis (the compass (but literally "the little box" as there is no Latin word for compass as the Greeks and Romans did not have compasses for navigation)), Puppis (the stern), and Carina (the keel). (The French cartographer Didier Robert de Vaugondy (1723-1826) became the first to actually illustrate (in 1764) Nicolas LaCaille's 4 divisions of Argo Navis. These 4 constellations became the last new constellations to be officially recognised.
The star atlases produced by the 19th-century cartographers Friedrich Argelander (Uranometria Nova, published 1843), and Benjamin Gould (Uranometria Argentina, published 1877-1879), standardised the list of constellations to those we use today. They both followed Nicolas LaCaille and divided Argo Navis (the ship) (Ptolemy's largest constellation) into 4 parts: Vela (the sail), Pyxis (the compass), Puppis (the stern), and Carina (the keel).
The process of constellation invention was continued by numerous other astronomers of the 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-centuries but these constellations were never officially recognised or adopted and quickly disappeared.
Appendix 1: The Southern Cross (Crux)
The 4 bright stars forming the Southern Cross (Crux) were described circa 1500 CE by various European explorers without their realizing they had actually already been observed by Ptolemy. This was only realized in the late 16th-century. It appears that Petrus Plancius, using the observations of the first modern survey of the southernmost stars by the Dutch navigator Pieter Keyzer, was the first person to realize that the 4 bright

stars forming the Southern Cross had already been catalogued by Ptolemy (among the stars in the hind legs of Centaurus). The oldest record mentioning the first European to sight the Southern Cross (a star configuration to be related with the Southern Cross) appears to be the manuscript description by the Venetian navigator Alvise Da Mosto (Alvise Cadamosto) (from the Gambia River, latitude 13.5 degrees North). Setting out in 1454 in the service of the king of Portugal he navigated from Portugal along the African Coast until Gambia in 1455, and later wrote a manuscript description. On a 32.5-cm celestial globe published in Amsterdam in 1589 (by the Dutch cartographer Jacob van Langren and his sons), the Southern Cross (Crux) is prominently depicted (but placed in a completely wrong position). The particular globe was the earliest attempt to use the sparse information available about southern celestial features. (Note: Jacob van Langren and his sons produced globes from 1580, both terrestrial and celestial.) On a celestial globe, published by Jodocus Hondius the Elder in Amsterdam in late 1597 (or early 1598), the Southern Cross is correctly placed close to the hind legs of Centaurus.

Volume II of Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians by Robert Brown Junior. (2 Volumes, 1899-1900). Both these volumes are full of errors and should not be used. Volume II focuses on the Babylonian constellations.
Usually Robert Brown Junior, FSA (Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries), MRAS (Member of the Royal Astronomical Society), A.M., (1844-1912) is mistakenly described as an English Orientalist or Assyriologist. (As recently as 1965 he was misdescribed as an Assyriologist and Egyptologist (Myth: A Symposium, Volume 5, 1965).) Actually he was an English Solicitor in Barton-on-Humber. He was also a writer on archaic religion, mythology, and astronomy. (He lived at Priestgate House - inherited/purchased from his parents.) He was known (locally) as a writer on archaic religion, and was an amateur orientalist. In his day Brown Junior was quite highly regarded as a popular writer. He can also be regarded as a private scholar. He was educated at Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire (considered one of the greatest public schools of the Victorian period). He corresponded with William Gladstone (on Greek literature no doubt) when Gladstone was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1880. His father was Robert Brown F.R.S., Solicitor and Registrar of the County Court, Barton-on-Humber. (Robert Brown was admitted to the Queen's Bench as Attorney, in 1850. However, he was established as an Attorney at Burgate by at least 1841.) The business became Brown and Son, Solicitors, when Robert Brown Junior joined it. Some details for Robert Brown Junior for 1885 include: (1) is Clerk to the Magistrates Court, Priestgate; (2) County Court Office: is Registrar and High Bailiff of the County Court, Priestgate; (3) Public Office, Priestgate: is Steward of the Manors of Barton-on-Humber & of Winteringham.
Brown Junior was a member of the Society of Biblical Archæology, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and contributed to the journals Archæologia, the Academy, and other publications. On 26 July, 1909, he played host to a visit to St. Peter's Church, by members of the Society of Antiquities.
It appears that in 1852 his sister, Mary-Helen Brown, married (at Liskeard) William Spry, son of the Reverend W[?]. Spry, late Rector of Botusfleming, Cornwall. (However the following is also recorded: "At Liskeard, on Wednesday last, by the Rev. Prebendary Lyne, of Tywardreath, Albert Charles Lyne GLUBB, Esq., to Margaret Elizabeth, daughter of the late Robert BROWN, Esq., of Barton on Humber, Lincolnshire.")
The Law Times, Volume 42, December 8, 1866, Pages 109-110, notes: "Examinations at the Incorporated Law Society, Michaelmas Term, 1866. Final Examination. At the examination of candidates for admission on the roll of attorneys and solicitors of the superior courts .... the Examiners also certified that the following candidates, under the age of 26, whose names are placed in alphabetical order, passed examinations which entitle them to commendation:- Robert Brown, jun., who served his clerkship to Mr Robert Brown, of Barton-upon-Humber; and Messrs Hicks and Son, of London." By 1877 he was listed as ex-Registrar of the County Court, Barton-on-Humber.
The following information was recorded at the 1891 Census for Priestgate: 866 - Robert Brown Junior, Married, 46 years, Head of house, Solicitor; Ann Eliza Brown, Married, 42 years, Janet E. Hogarth, Single, 25 years, Visitor, Literary author; Ann Everatt, Single, 35 years, Domestic servant; Ann Glover, Single, 35 years, Domestic servant. Janet Hogarth was the 'pen name' for Janet Courtney, a noted 19th-century scholar, writer, feminist, and freethinker, who was born in Barton-on-Humber, 1865, and died in London, 1954.
In 1871 Brown is listed in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London; "Brown, Robert, Jun. Esq. Priestgate House, Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire." In 1887 he is listed in the published Register of the Parish Church of Calverley. (He is earlier listed in the published Register of the Parish Church of Calverley in the West Riding of the County of York, 1883.) In the Journal of the Transactions of the Victoria Institute, Volume 11, 1878, (under "Faith and Thought" ?) he (or his father) is also listed: "Brown, Robert, Esq. Solicitor and ex-Registrar of County court ...." Earlier, his father Robert Brown in listed in the Post Office Directory of Lincolnshire, 1855, Pages 20 & 21 as: Insurance Agent for Phœnix Fire & Pelican Life; clerk to the County court Office; public officer, "Clerk to the Magistrates [Court], Steward of the Manor of Winteringham, Perpetual Commissioner & Commissioner to administer Oaths in Chancery."
Brown Junior was thought to be the author of the privately printed humorous pamphlet/monograph titled Totemism (1887) (described as an admirable burlesque upon the current scientific absurdities on the subject of totemism).

In The Westminster Review, Volume 152, 1902, he was described as "a many-sided man ... a recognised authority on mythology and astronomical archaeology ...." The Medical Tribune (Volume 1, 1874/8?, Page 192) was quite unrestrained (and erroneous) in describing him as "a savant and orientalist of great merit, engaged upon the somewhat robust task of ascertaining the proper interpretation of the symbolism of the cuneiform characters ...." Another journal erroneously stated that Brown Junior had made himself a master of the cuneiform characters.
He was a Liberal in politics. The family crest (Fairbairn's Book of Crests of the Families of Great Britain & Ireland by James Fairbairn (1993)): "Brown, Robert, junior, F.S.A., Priestgate House, Barton-on-Humber, a demi- eagle displayed ppr. Fortitudine et prudentia."
It appears that for a time Robert Brown Junior practiced fraudulent physical mediumship (during at least 1890-1891) and his "séances" (mostly resulting in a table levitation trick) were investigated by officers of The Society for Psychical Research. (See: The Founders of Psychical Research by Alan Gauld (1968, Pages 221-222).) His wife Ann was connected with - or a member of - the Society for Psychical Research (London). (See: Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Volume 21, Pages 539; "Brown, Mrs. Robert, Priestgate House, Barton-on-Huber, Hull.".) In his book Demonology and Witchcraft (1889) a Robert Brown (not Robert Brown Junior ) mentions a lecture and demonstration of mesmerism being held in the Temperance Hall in Barton-on-Humber (in 1889?). Also mentioned is a vicar of the parish practising mesmerism, with the object of curing disease.
Ann (or perhaps a daughter-in-law) may also have been a keen cyclist. A 1-page cycling log for a Mrs Brown of Barton, for 1909, records 1-day cycling journeys, one being 140 miles (Barton to Nottingham and return by the same route). (With the invention of the safety bicycle in 1885, women had taken to bicycle riding in great numbers. Cycling became a highly popular Edwardian hobby for ladies. Barton-upon-Humber was formerly an important centre for the manufacture of bicycles, Hopper's Cycles being established in the town in 1880 in the Hopper Building.)
It has been commented that if Brown Junior was right then it was often for the wrong reasons. As example: On the origin of the constellations he accepted the erroneous ideas of Fritz Hommel and Peter Jensen, and opposed the ideas of Georg Thiele. In spite of holding some peculiar positions Antike Himmelsbilder (1898) by Georg Thiele is still regarded by some as the standard work on the constellations. Books by Fritz Hommel and Peter Jensen are largely forgotten and their ideas discarded.
During the 1870s and 1880s he laboured to establish the influence of ancient Semitic cultures on Hellenic religious mythology. Along with George Cox and Abram Palmer he enthusiastically embraced and promoted the school of nature mythology originated by Max Müller. However, at this period when solar, lunar, and stellar interpretations of mythology were being linked to India and the Rig Veda Brown Junior argued for Semitic influences on Greek mythology. In doing this he showed he was not a complete disciple of Max Muller in the interpretation of mythology. (Rather, he applied Müller's approach to uncovering Semitic origins.) One of Brown's better books is Semitic Influence in Hellenic Mythology (1898), which is a critique of the views of Max Müller and Andrew Lang on mythology. (See the supportive (English-language) book review by George Goodspeed in The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Volume 15, Number 1, October, 1898, Pages 60-62.) Circa 1883 Brown Junior began working on the the origin of the extra-zodiacal constellations.
On ancient astronomy he corresponded/associated with – and relied upon for material and guidance professional assyriologists such as Archibald Sayce, Theophilus Pinches and George Bertin. He was obviously frequently corresponding with Pinches - in his Primitive Constellations he frequently acknowledges assistance/advice given by Pinches. In a letter to the American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts (1893) he acknowledges that Theophilus Pinches has called his attention to Babylonian tablet BM 85-4-30, 15 in the British Museum which gives the 12 months and month stars connected with each. A number of Brown's mistakes are their mistakes. However, he frequently ignored their expert guidance on a range of issues (such as philology and cultural transmission) and they frequently expressed their disappointment with Brown’s 'independent' (speculative and undisciplined) ideas on a range of issues (such as philology and cultural transmission). The eminent French historian of ancient astronomy, Paul Tannery, found Brown's work erudite and ingenious, but took issue with the method, and other issues. Both volumes of Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and

Babylonians are (1) thoroughly dated and unreliable, and (2) still mistaken as important and the standard work.
It has been claimed that the British assyriologist Theophilus Pinches confirmed that Robert Brown Junior was the first to connect the "three stars" for each month in the so-called Creation Epic Enuma Elish (tablet 5, lines 1-8) with the "three stars" for each month set out on a circular star calendar ("astrolabe") fragment. In Volume II, Chapter IX, of his Primitive Constellations, Brown certainly discusses and connects the "three stars" for each month in the so-called Creation Epic Enuma Elish with the "three stars" for each month set out on a circular star calendar ("astrolabe") fragment. In Theophilus Pinches' review of Volume II of Primitive Constellations (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1900)), he writes: "There are, therefore, three stars or constellations for each month, corresponding with the statement in the Babylonian Creation-Story, and there is every probability that Mr Brown is right in regarding as those which are referred to in that Legend." Later, in his book The Religion of Babylon and Assyria (1906, Page 67) Pinches mentions that Brown junior has identified the "three stars" for each month on a circular planisphere fragment with "three stars" for each month in the 6th (sic) tablet of the Enuma Elish. Pinches does acknowledge that Brown Junior has made the connection but nowhere does Pinches actually acknowledge 'first.' It may indeed be that Brown Junior was 'first' to make a 'constellation connection.' The assyriologist Wayne Horowitz has, since 1998 (Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography), clearly shown the close connection between tablet V, lines 1-8, of the Babylonian so-called creation epic Enuma Elish (comprised of 7 tablets) and the astrolabes. ... The parallels between the Enuma Elish and the astrolabes .... demonstrates that the astrolabes are not only astronomicalcalendrical works (presenting an astronomical-calendrical theory), but also have important religious and theological implications. Brown Junior made no such connection. Also: In Pinches' review of Volume 1 (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1900)) he states: "... it grieves me that I cannot follow him [Brown] in much of what says concerning the statements of the Assyro-Babylonian tablets bearing upon the subject." In Pinches' review of Volume 2 (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1900)) he states: "It is a matter of regret to me that I find myself unable to follow the author in all his conclusions, and that my readings, ... often differ greatly to his." (Note: The Enuma elish is essentially a narrative of the sacred city of Babylon and the construction of its central shrine, Esagila.)
Professor Cornelius Tiele (not to be confused with Georg Thiele, the philologist), Leiden University, criticised Brown Junior for his etymology of Poseidon. (Tiele (1830-1902) was essentially a theologian and historian of religion (and not an assyriologist).)
Brown Junior was for many years reliant on the guidance given to him, amongst others, by the assyriologist George Bertin (1848-1891). In the pages of the late 19th-century journal The Academy it is clearly Robert Brown Junior who George Bertin is referring to for breaching trust and publishing some of Bertin's significant work unacknowledged - inferring it was Brown's own work. Trying to work out at this late stage what was Brown's own work and what was a copy of the help of others is impossible.
Brown Junior mistook the early circular "three stars each" texts (commonly called "planispheres," but actually functioning as star calendars) as representing the standard Mesopotamian scheme of constellations. On the basis of three small fragments of these circular "star calendars" (Sm. 162, Sm. 608, and Sm. 94) he attempted to re-establish what he believed was a complete standard Babylonian "planisphere." His speculative and erroneous reconstruction of such was based on his belief that the "planispheres" set out an ecliptic based scheme with the 12 stars in the Path of Ea (outer ring) marking southern constellations, the 12 stars in the Path of Enlil (inner ring) marking northern constellations, and the 12 stars in the Path of Anu (middle ring) marking the 12 zodiacal constellations along the ecliptic.
He was also led into error by the text of the Enuma Elish ("When on high") the 7 tablet series usually described as the Mesopotamian "Epic of Creation" He began Volume II of Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians with a chapter setting out his analysis of the fifth tablet of the Enuma Elish series. In the fifth tablet there occurs a passage ("For the twelve months he placed three stars (constellations) each.") that is interpretable as pointing to the existence of a scheme of 36 constellations: 12 northern, 12 zodiacal, and 12 southern. These are 36 selected stars (constellations) to mark the progress of the months through the course of the schematic year and not the total number of constellations within the scheme of Mesopotamian uranography.

On the basis of his mistaken "planisphere" reconstruction Brown Junior believed the constellations, including a 12-constellation zodiac scheme, in something like their present form, originated in Mesopotamia in the late 3rd millennium BCE. He denied (quite incorrectly) that anyone in Mesopotamia was inventing the 12constellation zodiac as late as circa 500 BCE.
Part of the problem was Brown Junior was unaware of the star lists of the Mul.Apin series. Mul.Apin tablet 1 (BM 86378) was not published until 1912 by Leonard King (CT 33, Plates 1-8) and it was perhaps first discussed by Franz Kugler in his Supplement 1 (1913) to his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. The first section of Mul.Apin tablet 1 lists considerably more stars in the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea than are found in the "planispheres." Brown Junior was also misled by the limited listing of stars/constellations in the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea through Tablet 82-5-22 512.
Interestingly, Brown Junior held the mistaken view that Aries (the Ram) is a Babylonian constellation which we know it is not.
As late as 1932 Basil Brown in his Astronomical Atlases, Maps and Charts (unreliably) advised that Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians "should certainly be consulted." The historian Mircea Eliade, in his The Encyclopedia of Religion (1987) also (unreliably) recommended use of Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians.
According to the folklorist Richard Dorson (History of British Folklore (1999)) Brown Junior claimed to have converted Prime Minister Gladstone from an old-fashioned interpretation of Homer to his own viewpoint (involving Semitic influences). There is little doubt of the accuracy of Brown's claim (see: Homeric Synchronism: An Enquiry into the Time and Place of Homer by William Gladstone (1876)). In 1902 Brown Junior published the book, Mr Gladstone as I knew him, and other essays. Brown very much felt his isolation in Barton-on-Humber - and his distance from London to attend meetings. Eventually he became the only member of his family to remain living in Barton-on-Humber. (In 1930 the population of Barton-onHumber was approximately 6,500 people.)
He wrote the well received history, Notes on the Earlier History of Barton-on-Humber (2 Volumes, 19061908). However, his adducement of a number of vernacular words as specimens of the Danish past of Barton-on-Humber was considered erroneous.
The Yorkshire Herald (21/02/1893) reported that on this day that Mr [William] Gladstone had conferred a Civic Service pension of £100 a year upon Mr Robert Brown F.S.A., of Barton upon Humber, in consideration of his service to literature.
Brown was frequently mistaken for other persons with the name Robert Brown. In his presidential address for 1896, the prominent folklorist Edward Clodd erroneously mentioned the death of Robert Brown the preceding year. Robert Brown Junior died at the age of 68 years. A short obituary appeared in Nature, Volume 90, 1913, Pages 227; and in the Annual Register, 1913, Page 123.
A (stained-glass) window by Archibald Nicholson (1872-1937) was placed in the Church of St. Peter in memory of Robert Brown Junior. It was removed in January, 2005 for conservation. (The (Saxon) Church of St. Peter was one of 2 great features of Barton-upon-Humber. The second was the (Norman) Church of St. Mary. Unusually for large mediaeval churches in a small town, they are located only some 150 metres apart. The construction of the Church of St. Peter is dated to the period between the period of King Edgar, 950 CE, and the Norman Conquest (1066 CE). The Church of St. Peter was an Anglican Church and Robert Brown Junior was a member of the Church of England.) The church window was only a small part of the memorial to Brown Junior. A large new school was built to his memory, by his parishioners and friends, at a cost of circa £1800 (including levelling the playground, and building boundary walls.
Robert Brown, his father, at one time lived at The Mansion, Barton-on-Humber. He wrote a number of pamphlets on religious issues including: Jesuitism, or, The Devil's travesty of the Son of the Kingdom (92 pages); Ritualism at Barton on Humber (1867); Gospel Truths, and Reaping in due season (1875).

Appendix 3: Barton-upon-Humber
Circa 1850 Barton-upon-Humber was a small, neat, well-built, market town, situated on ground gently rising from/spreading out from the southern bank of River Humber/Humber Estuary (which it was next to), 165 miles north from London. It is a town and 2 parishes in Glanford-Brigg district, Lincoln, in the northern division of the wapentake of Yarborough (North Lincolnshire). A branch of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincoln railway left the town and joined the Great Northern railway at Great Grimsby. Most railway traffic was to New Holland station. Steam boats belonging to the North Midland Company provided a ferry business to Hull and Hessle. (Also, Barton-upon-Humber was once a thriving port.) According to one source the chief trade of the town circa 1850 was tanning, malting; brick, tile rope, and whiting manufactures; and there were several corn mills. Another source states the trade was chiefly in corn and flour; and the manufacture of rope, sacking, starch, plaster of Paris, bricks, and tiles. The market was on Monday and every alternate Monday there was a larger cattle market. The town has great antiquity and dates back to the Roman occupation of Britain. There was a Saxon settlement there circa 400 CE (early Saxon times). In the Doomsday Survey the town is called Berton-upon-Humber. At the time of the Norman Conquest it was noted for its commerce. In 1851 the population was some 3900 persons (comprising the united parishes of St. Mary and St. Peter). Circa 1872 the population numbered 4300 persons. During the 19th-century Barton-uponHumber was a petty sessional division and county court district. See: Notes on the Earlier History of Bartonon-Humber, by Robert Brown Junior (2 Volumes, 1906-1908). This book was considered a competent study, and well researched.

34: Title page of Carl Swartz's book on the origin of the constellations
Carl Swartz, a Swedish amateur astronomer and correspondent of Charles Dupuis, Jean Delambre, and Jean Bailly, wrote a treatise in Swedish on the origin and meaning of the constellations, which was translated into French and went through several editions. Peter Doig (A Concise History of Astronomy (1950) - borrowing from Edward Maunder (JBAA, 1909) - reinforced the error that Carl Swartz was, for several years, the Swedish consul at Baku on the Caspian Sea. (It was also taken up earlier by Claude Conder: "This

observation was first made by the Swedish astronomer, Carl G. Schwartz, residing at Baku, near, the Caspian, at the end of the eighteenth century." (The First Bible by Claude Conder (1902, Page 155).)
Title page (above) of the second edition of Carl Swartz's book on the origin of the constellations. Schwartz's first treatise on the antiquity of the constellations was published in Paris in 1807. Carl Gottlieb Swartz (born 30-9-1757-died 5-11-1824) was born in Norrköping, Sweden (the 2nd son of Petter Swartz (1726-1789) and died in Paris, France. His father, Petter Swartz, was a prominent snuff manufacturer and patron of the arts and sciences. In about 1770 Petter Swartz started large-scale production of snuff in Norrköping. (To my knowledge 3 copies of the above book by Carl Swartz have appeared on the European antiquarian book market between circa 2004 and 2008 (variously priced between approximately Euros 300 and Euros 600). A digital copy has been freely available on the internet since early 2008 at least.) Initially Carl Swartz chose to publish anonymously.
Carl Swartz attended the University of Uppsala as did both his brothers. In 1774 Carl enrolled at the University of Uppsala. (Uppsala Universitets Matrikel på uppdrag av universitetets rektor utgiven, Tredje Bandet 1750-1800, utg. av A. B. Carlsson (Uppsala 1925-1946) p 191, Octob. 14. The source was located by Robert H. van Gent. The section seems to start at page 190 and is headed: Quartum Rectore Academiæ Upsaliensis Johanne Ihre Prof. Reg. Et Skyttiano. Entry details: Octob. 14. Carl Gottl. Swartz, Ostrogoth.
1757. See also: Upsala Universitets Historia : Delarna I-III jamte bihang I-V, 1477-1792, register utarbetadt af Elof Colliander by Claes Annerstedt (1931, Page 75).)
In 1778, after presumably completing university, Carl obtained his first job as a civil clerk. This position does not appear to have been with the Swedish Government Offices. In 1781 Carl then obtained employment with the Kanskollegium (Swedish Government Offices) as a secretary or clerk (kopyist). In 1782 he was a clerical officer keeping office records or accounts (presumably still with the Swedish Government Offices). When Carl left (presumably resigned) his employment at the Swedish Government Offices (date unknown) his position title was prot.-sekreterare ((Protokollsekreterare) meaning 'Protocol-Secretary' (clerical officer (= civil servant)) = person who takes the minutes. This seems to be all that is known of his career in the Government offices.
In 1787 (at least) he was the secretary (sekreteraren) for one of the numerous Swedish scientific societies that were coming into existence during the 18th-century. In August 1787 he purchased an important mineralogy collection (mineral cabinet) belonging to Johan Gottschalk Wallerius. It was planned/hoped that Johan Gottschalk Wallerius' mineral cabinet would be given to Uppsala University. (See: "Upsala universitets historia: d. 1719-1792, förra afdelningen, Universitetets öden" (Volume 3, Issue 2 of Upsala universitets historia), by Claes Annerstedt (1914, Page 448).) In 1795 he married 24 year old Catherina Arosenius (17711816) and in 1796 they divorced. (She married again to Joackin Almgren in 1799. Carl Swartz did not remarry. Nothing is now known regarding why the marriage failed. Perhaps she did not wish to travel or live outside Sweden. Nothing is known of Carl Swartz's personality.) Carl Swartz was a frequent traveller in Europe (but not Asia Minor) and also a keen amateur astronomer (and amateur philologist). He corresponded with, and was a personal friend to, Charles Dupuis, Jean Delambre, and Jean Bailly. He appears to have settled in Paris circa 1805.
It can be assumed that Carl Swartz inherited considerable wealth with the death of his father, enabling him to travel and live independently. He perhaps first travelled between the years 1789-1794. His next opportunities would lie between 1796-1824. The period of the Napoleonic regime is usually given as 1792-1819. The period of the French Revolution is usually given as 1792-1799.
In 1807 his ideas on the origins of the constellations were first published in his Recherches sur l'origine et le signification des Constellations de la Sphčre greque (1807). The (shorter) revised (standard) edition was published as Le Zodiaque expliqué (1809). Swartz appears to be familiar with all the relevant literature on the origin of the constellations that was known at that time. Unlike Charles Dupuis and others he identified a recent date for the constellations and the zodiac. (His (flawed) methods for exclusion of fabulous ancient dates for the origin of the constellations and zodiac still constituted an important step.) In the first and second editions of his book Carl Swartz proposed that the unconstellated area of the southern sky gave an approximate date for the formation of the constellations. Specifically he: (1) identified the unmapped space in the southern sky as significant for determining the origin of the constellations; (2) argued a case for the essential unity of the constellations as a single set; (3) estimated that the radius of the "void zone" was about

40 degrees; (4) deducted from the "void zone" that the date of origin of the constellations was 1400 BCE; (5) argued a case that astronomy arose with a seafaring people and navigational requirements; and (6) identified the port city of Baku (north latitude 40 degrees) as the place of origin of the constellations. He speculated that the city of Baku was the centre/capital of an ancient empire. Carl Swartz thought that the whole system of the constellations referred to the geography of the Caucasus (Caucasia) (a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas), and the borders of the Caspian. Swartz endeavoured to prove that the constellations were nothing but a sort of symbolical geography of the west shore of the Caspian Sea. This idea is the most fanciful part of his publications. There is no evidence that Swartz ever visited or came near to Baku. All of his information is based on the reports of other travellers (who he carefully identifies).
Included amongst his anonymously published works is his short monograph: Mémoire explicatif sur la sphère caucasienne et spécialement sur le zodiaque by C. G. S. (1813). According to the BNF catalogue (when looked at in 2000) the French mathematician and astronomer Jean-Baptiste Delambre (1749-1822) was "part author" by way of making annotations to the text. The BNF catalogue (when looked at in 2015) has "Note : Attribué par Barbier ā Schwartz, mais une note ms., figurant sur l'ex. qui porte la cote 4-V-5036, attribue cet ouvrage ā Stéphens, Suédois." A draft translation is: Note: Attributed by Barbier to Schwartz, but a manuscript note marked 4-V-5036 that is enclosed with the work attributes the authorship to Stephens, a Swede.
One source indicates that he gave a public presentation of his constellation ideas in 1817 in Paris.
Carl Swartz's ideas for the origin of science and culture in the Caucasus region were based on Von den kaukasischen [kaukcasischen] Völkern der mythischen Zeit, ein abermaliger Beytrag zur Historie und Geographie der Mythologie by Theodor Ditmar (1789). (Theodor Ditmar (1734-1791) was a Prussian historian and geographer, Prof. für Geschichte und Geographie am Gymnasium. He has also been mistakenly described as an archaeologist.) The Royal Observatory, Greenwich sun spot specialist Edward Maunder discovered a copy of Le Zodiaque expliqué in the observatory library and in a series of articles from 1898 to 1913 reintroduced many of the ideas of its author. The copies may have been donated by Carl Swartz. He presented copies of his publications to the Royal Society of London.
The "void zone" argument, though popular since its reintroduction by Edward Maunder, has multiple problems. The chief premise of the "void zone" is that the classical Greek constellations (i.e., the Aratean constellations) were designed at one definite time and in one place, according to a preconceived plan. The argument for establishing the time and place of the Aratean constellations is based on the extent of the vacant space left around the south pole of the celestial sphere when all but the Aratean constellations are removed; and the apparent movement of the stars due to precession. The further assumption made is that the area of the globe that was not constellated in the description of Aratus was centred on the south celestial pole at the date when the constellations were fixed.
The size of the "void zone" is taken as a clue to the latitude at which the constellation inventors lived. A date is found when, by allowing for precession, the centre of the "void zone" on the globe is in the position of the south celestial pole.
The subjectivity of the method is demonstrated by the varying estimates of the radius of the "void zone" (30 degrees to 40 degrees) and the varying estimates of the date of origin given by precession (1400-2800 BCE). Anyway the boundaries of the "void zone" cannot be accurately defined as we lack the understanding of the original boundaries of the classical Greek constellation figures. Due to our lack of knowledge of the boundaries of the Aratean constellations the "void zone" method is inherently subjective and its use can lead to no real agreement (as it has failed to do) regarding the latitude and date for the constellations being designed at one definite time and place.
Many of the Aratean constellations show a similarity with Babylonian constellations. The Greek constellation scheme of Aratus of Soli (3rd-century BCE) contains a mix of both Babylonian constellations and non-Babylonian constellations. The Babylonian component of the Aratean constellations is traceable to both Babylonian "star calendar" constellations of the 2nd millennium BCE and also to Babylonian constellations listed in the later Mul.Apin series (circa 1000 BCE). (The few known 8th-century BCE constellations of Homer mirror the constellations already existing in the Babylonian scheme.) The

Babylonian scheme of constellations has always been a mix of constellations mentioned by Aratus and other constellations outside the Aratean scheme. A definite Babylonian influence on the later Greek scheme of constellations is reasonably indicated. It is obvious that the Greeks borrowed certain constellations from the Babylonians and it is obvious that the constellations could not have originated, or been adopted, as a single devised scheme by either the Babylonians or the Greeks.
If the constellations originated as a set circa 2000-2800 BCE, as commonly claimed by the proponents of the "void zone" method, then they cannot have originated with the Greeks. However, the latitude at which the constellations were believed to have originated as a single scheme cannot refer to Mesopotamia because their earliest scheme of constellations, though dating to the 2nd millennium BCE, was a mix of constellations mentioned by Aratus and other constellations outside his scheme.
Crediting the Minoans, as some like to do, as the makers of the classical constellations and offering explanations based on the destruction of Minoan civilization and the later ineptitude of the Greeks as observers are also not convincing. There is no evidence that the classical Greek scheme of constellations existed anywhere prior to its evolvement in Greece circa 500 BCE. This includes the fact that there is no evidence that the particular Greek scheme of 12 zodiacal constellations existed anywhere prior to its evolvement in Greece circa 500 BCE. The difficulty with maintaining an ancient zodiac is how can a late Mesopotamian zodiac (developed circa 500 BCE) and comprised of 12 constellations (and 12 equal divisions), and substantially borrowed by the Greeks, have been in use by anybody hundreds of years earlier. (Or even thousands of years earlier, prior to the existence of the Babylonian civilization which demonstrably created it.)
The flawed "void zone" argument has become a common tool for maintaining that a Neolithic zodiac (and fully constellated sky) can be reasonably be proposed. The "void zone" argument can hardly substitute for the lack of clear evidence (which tends to fall under the murky heading of "tradition"). Even if the "void zone" argument were correct it has never offered support for the idea that the constellations could have existed as a deliberately planned set extending back some 6000-8000 years BCE (or further). The use of the "void zone" argument controls the feasible range for the dating of the constellations if they are considered to have originated as a deliberately planned scheme. Interestingly, Edward Maunder, a committed proponent of the "void zone" argument, in his later articles on the topic attempted to overcome this limitation by implying a very slow developmental period for the final scheme of constellation design (see: "Origin of the Constellations." The Observatory, Volume 36, 1913, Page 330).
Appendix 1: Petter Swartz
In the 16th-century, Swedes began to mix tobacco leaves with salt and water to place behind the upper lip. (Initially, nasally inhaled snuff was practiced.) In the early 1800s, maybe somewhat earlier, Swedish consumers switched to placing a pinch of snus under the lip. Many farmers, who had their own tobacco plantations, made their own snus. They ground the tobacco in their coffee grinders or in snus mills that they had carved themselves. During the 1800s, Swedish manufacturers began to produce local varieties of the moist snus. Some popular suppliers include Petter Swartz with Röda Lacket and J.A. Boman with General snus. However, the largest brand was Ettan, Ljunglöfs Ettan. Jacob Fredrik Ljunglöf's plant at Badstugatan, today Sveavägen in Stockholm, traces its roots to a tobacco company founded around 1695. Jacob Fredrik Ljunglöf took over the company in 1822 and turned it into the leading snus plant in Europe and the world.
Petter (Peter) Swartz (father of Carl Gottlieb Swartz) was born 17 May 1726 and was a son of mine owner Olof Persson Swartzången in Kroppa in Värmland. His family had farmed there for generations. Petter Swartz moved to Norrköping in 1751 from Stockholm. In the same year he was employed as accountant/bookkeeper with the Gripen sugar mill in Norrköping. (In the 1740s, Norrköping had three sugar refineries.) He was the first to introduce the Italian double-entry bookkeeping method to Norrköping. Prior to this he had served as 'boddräng/husdräng' [shop hand/house servant] for 6 years with the French merchant Jean Crescs trading business at Köpmansgatan 11 in Old Town in Stockholm. In connection with this service he got in touch with the French who introduced the manufacture of Spanish snuff in Sweden. From them he learned the technique of manufacturing snuff and some sources state he started his own production of snuff in Stockholm. No evidence for this claim has been found.

In 1753 Petter Swartz was given a licence (privilege) to manufacture snus (snuff) in Norrköping. On November 12, 1753, he gave an invitation to his brother, Olof (1728-1768) to join him in producing Spanish snuff in Norrköping. (Olof S(ch)wartz 1728-1768 married and had one child.) According to one source both brothers had received a licence ['privilegium'] to produce snus (snuff). According to Tobaks Tändsticks Museum: "In 1753, two brothers, Olof and Petter Swartz, were granted a licence to manufacture snus in the town of Norrköping. They soon went separate ways, but Petter Swartz continued to make snus. By the late 1800s, the company was one of the biggest snus manufacturers in Sweden." It seems likely it was Petter Swartz who was granted the licence and he established the business with his brother Olaf Swartz. The brothers bought a plot of land in the neighborhood of Linden where they started their snuff manufacturing (beginning 1753), and where Petter Swartz had established his residence. In 1761 either the brothers or Petter Swartz purchased property next to 'Knäppingeborg invid Motala ström i Norrköping' [Knäppingeborg adjacent to the Motala River in Norrköping], which was developed as a snuff mill that, over time, become one of the largest in Sweden. Finally, the entire block 'Nya Strömmen' [New Stream] was purchased and in 1767 the first stone building was built on the corner of 'Knäppingeborgsgatan och Gamla Rådstugatan.'
Circa 1770 Petter Swartz started large-scale production of snuff in Nörrkoping. When snus production was at its peak, the tobacco fields had expanded to cover an area of almost 395,000 square meters – or just above 1500 tennis courts. Petter and his brother, Olof Swartz, transformed the initially small business by implementing an efficient manufacturing process. They also paid low wages to their workers. Olof Swartz left the company in 1762 (other strong sources state 1768) to take over the 'Törnqvists privilegium' [Törnqvist privilege] on 'kardustllverkning' [Kardus manufacturing] in Norrköping. This left Petter Swartz the sole owner of the business, Norrköpings Snusfabrik (Snusfactory). The business also included a flour mill until 1853, when it became a separate business taken over by John Gustav Swartz (1819-1885). Snus usage increased steadily during the 1800s.
In 1754 Peter Swartz was married to Brita Ryy (born Norrköping 23 August 1725 - died Norrköping 17 December 1783). Parents of Brita Ryy: Father: Jacob Jakobsson Ryy born 1687 in Visby, Gotland County, title: 'Bokbindare & tullbesökare,' died 1759 in Norrköping, married Katarina Öjarsdotter Scherelia in 1716, in Visby; Katarina Öjarsdotter Schereli born in 1688, died 1759 in Norrköping. Petter Swartz died 14 February 1789.
Some sources indicate that that Petter Swartz and Brita Ryy had 4/5 (?) children; 3/4 (/) sons and 1 daughter. However, other sources indicate they only had 2 children - 1 son and 1 daughter! Correctly, it appears they had 3 sons and 1 daughter. One son, Petter Jacob Swartz, was born 1755 and died 1819. He married Anna Charlotta Erling who died in 1784; he then married Catharina Charlotta Wallström (1759-1820). The other 2 sons were John Swartz and, of course, Carl Gottlieb Swartz. The daughter, Johanna Elisabet Swartz, was born 1766 and died 1808. In 1786 she married Karl Gustav Pereswetoff-Morath (born Torpa, E., 1755-died Söderköping, E., 1812; title: Hovjägmästare) and they had 3 daughters. They resided in Norrköping.
The Petter Swartz tobacco factory was passed down for generations, for a total of 160 years. Seven different recipes for snus comprised the backbone of the Swartz empire. Its most famous brand was Röda Lacket (The Red Seal) snuff. In its early days, the snus was mostly popular in the southern Swedish province of Småland. Sons Peter Jackob (title: Grosshandlare, tobaksfabrikör), 1755-1819, (in 1785 married Katarina Chalotta Wallström), and Daniel Frederick, 1765-1828, had in 1784 entered the firm. Daniel Frederick left the firm in 1808 to take over J. G. Nyberg kardusfabrik in Norrköping. The Swartz firm was passed on to any subsequent children and grandchildren: John Swartz, born 1790, Eric Swartz, born 1817, Carl Swartz, born 1858.
The Swartz family became very wealthy and made generous financial contributions to the development of the town of Norrköping, most notably through financing the public library and the town's arts museum. In 1772, Petter Swartz founded (financed) a private school where students were taught both double-entry bookkeeping and carpentry - skills that were needed in the snus business. Petter Swartz was a prominent patron of the arts and sciences. The family and descendents of Petter Swartz played an important part in the industrial (and cultural) history of Norrköping. The family and descendents of Peter Swartz and Brita Ryy also held different kinds of public offices, culminating with Carl Swartz (1858-1926), industrialist and rightwing politician, who was a member of the first chamber of the Swedish Parliament (Riksdagen), 1900-1926, and several of its most important committees, minister of finance 1906-1911, and prime minister of Sweden in 1917 (30 March-19 October). Interestingly, it is indicated by one source that in 1876 Carl Swartz had his

own firm and founded a new snuff manufacturing mill. The establishment of the Norrköping Museum of the Arts at the turn of the 20th-century was due to a donation from Pehr [Per] Swartz, a famous snuff manufacturer and patron of the arts. Also, a 6000 kroner donation by Pehr Swartz enabled an observatory dome to be constructed (1911-1912) at the Louis De Geer Gymnasium (Norrköping) and a large (122 mm diameter) Merz refracting telescope to be purchased from Germany.
The most detailed study of the Swartz family was published by the Swedish businessman and cultural historian Edward Ringborg (1857-1929), who resided in Norrköping, the son of Ludvig Ringborg and Catarina Elisabeth Swartz. See: Till Norrköpingskrönikan (2nd edition, 1920). Note: Comprised of multiple volumes concerning Norrköping. Also, Svenska ättartal, Volume 3, 1886.

35: Title page of Robert Brown's translation of Aratus' Phainomena
Title page of Robert Brown Junior's book on the Phainomena of Aratus. It is considered to be a mostly faithful translation. The contents of the book are not a history of the constellations but a (poorly argued) case for the Aratean configuration of constellations being of Babylonian origin and dating to 2084 BCE. (There are several possible earlier influences for this belief of Brown's.) At the time of its publication Brown's book was critically reviewed by the philologist George Knaack and uncritically reviewed by pioneer assyriologist Archibald Sayce. (See: The Academy, Number 695, 1885, Pages 137-138.)
Robert Brown Junior (1844-1912) was a solicitor and registrar of the county court in Barton-upon-Humber. He worked for the legal firm of Brown and Son (later renamed Brown and Sons). He was born in Barton

upon-Humber and worked and died there. He is frequently confused with the American freemason and author Robert Hewitt Brown. Also, he is commonly mis-identified as an Assyriologist or Orientalist. He was educated at Cheltenham College, was a Fellow of the Antiquarian Society, a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, and a Member of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. He was an avid amateur antiquarian and amateur philologist and a prolific writer on ancient Near Eastern mythology and astronomy. He was known (locally) as a writer on archaic religion. He was a strong supporter of the Solar mythology school and also a strong supporter of Semitic influence upon Greek mythology.
Robert Brown Junior believed that Aratus' poem embodied astronomical ideas derived from Babylon. Specifically, the constellations described by Aratus - including the zodiacal constellations - are of Babylonian origin and date circa 2000 BCE. In his lengthy article 1892 address/paper in "The Celestial Equator of Aratos." (In: Morgan, Edward. (Editor). Transactions of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists. 2 Volumes. (Pages 445-485). [The paper is in Volume 2.]) is the address/publication in which Brown (erroneously) dates the origin of the Babylonian zodiac to 2084 BCE. This error had also been touched upon in his earlier 1885 book The Phainomena, or, 'Heavenly Display' of Aratos: Done into English Verse. Brown believed that nobody was inventing the zodiac circa 500 BCE. (By way of noting Robert Brown Junior was appointed Secretary of the Archaic Greece and the East Section (for the duration/terms of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists?) Both William Gladstone and Brown Junior were elected officers for the Archaic Greece and the East Section of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists.) Brown believes he has shown " ... that the statements in Aratos in reference to the principal stars near the equator, agree with the actual state of things at the vernal equinox B.C. 2084, a date when the Euphratean formal scheme of chart of the heavens had already been completed." (Also of interest, Mrs Robert Brown Junior was also a member of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists. Edward Delmar Morgan (1840-1909) was an English explorer, traveller, translator, and author.)
The basic problem with Brown's The Phainomena, or, ‘Heavenly Display’ of Aratos: Done into English Verse is Brown believed that nobody was inventing the zodiac circa 500 BCE. In fact we now know that the zodiac was developed by the Babylonians over circa 700 BCE to circa 400 BCE. Nobody was inventing a zodiac prior to the Babylonians in the first millennium BCE.
Brown's ideas on such have influenced multiple other persons (including modern scholars such as Mary Blomberg and G๖ran Henriksson, Uppsala University) to ascribe a very early date to the constellations in the Phainomena of Aratus. These ideas are now no longer tenable. A suitable understanding of Babylonian cuneiform sources clearly show a late origin for the zodiac (originating circa 500 BCE in Babylon). The complex set of Babylonian constellations contained in the Mul.Apin series can be dated to the latter half of the 2nd-millennium BCE.
Earlier, the theme of Brown's book was similarly taken up by Robert B๖ker in Aratos Sternbilder und Wetterzeichen by Albert Schott and Robert B๖ker (1958). (Albert Schott was the poem translator and Robert B๖ker was the poem editor.) Later, Manfred Erren in his Die Phainomena des Aratos von Soloi (1967) took up B๖ker's ideas. The premises of both books have been soundly criticised by David Pingree (see: Gnomon, Volume 43, 1971, Pages 347-350).
Other persons have more recently argued that the Phainomena of Aratus can be dated to circa 3000 BCE. However, the assumption of accuracy for Aratus' reworking of Eudoxus' earlier works describing the constellations is perhaps misplaced. The Greeks were not too concerned about accuracy until after the 4thcentury BCE. Also, the needs of Aratus for reworking the descriptions of Eudoxus into suitable versification could easily have introduced some looseness in accuracy of description.
Brown was highly reliant on continual assistance and guidance from professional assyriologists such as Theophilus Pinches (1856-1934) and George Bertin (1848-1891). However, he was keen for recognition and also to promote his particular ideas. More than one person has commented that if Brown was right then it was usually for the wrong reasons. In Pinches' review of Volume 1 of Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians (1899) he states: "... it grieves me that I cannot follow him in much of what says concerning the statements of the Assyro-Babylonian tablets bearing upon the subject." In Pinches' review of Volume 2 of Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Babylonians (1900) he states: "It is a matter of regret to me that I find myself unable to follow the author in all his conclusions, and that my readings, ... often differ greatly to

his." Reading the pages of The Academy it is clearly Robert Brown Junior who Bertin is referring to for breaching trust and publishing some of Bertin's significant work unacknowledged - inferring it was Brown's own work.
Brown mistook the early circular "three stars each" texts (commonly called "planispheres" but actually functioning as star calendars) as representing the standard Mesopotamian scheme of constellations. On the basis of three small fragments of these circular "star calendars" (Sm. 162, Sm. 608, and Sm. 94) he attempted to re-establish what he believed was a complete standard Babylonian "planisphere." His speculative and erroneous reconstruction of such was based on his belief that the circular "planispheres" set out an ecliptic based scheme with the 12 stars in the Path of Ea (outer ring) marking southern constellations, the 12 stars in the Path of Enlil (inner ring) marking northern constellations, and the 12 stars in the Path of Anu (middle ring) marking the 12 zodiacal constellations along the ecliptic. On the basis of his mistaken circular "planisphere" reconstruction Brown believed the constellations, including a 12-constellation zodiac scheme, in something like their present form, originated in Mesopotamia in the late 3rd millennium BCE. He denied (quite incorrectly) that anyone in Mesopotamia was inventing the 12-constellation zodiac as late as circa 500 BCE. Brown was unaware of the star lists of the Mul.Apin series. Mul.Apin tablet 1 (BM 86378) was not published until 1912 by Leonard King (CT 33, Plates 1-8) and it was perhaps first discussed by Franz Kugler in his Supplement 1 (1913) to his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. The first section of Mul.Apin tablet 1 lists considerably more stars in the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea than are found in the "planispheres." (He was also misled by the limited listing of stars/constellations in the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea through Tablet 825-22 512.)
Brown corresponded with William Gladstone (on Greek literature no doubt) when Gladstone was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1880. According to the folklorist Richard Dorson (History of British Folklore (1999)) Brown claimed to have converted Prime Minister Gladstone from an old-fashioned interpretation of Homer to his own viewpoint (involving Semitic influences). There is little doubt of the accuracy of Brown's claim (see: Homeric Synchronism: An Enquiry into the Time and Place of Homer by William Gladstone (1876)). Brown's wife was apparently a keen cyclist and she was also connected with - or a member of - the Society for Psychical Research (London). It is possible that Mary-Helen Brown, daughter of Robert Brown, Barton-on-Humber, (who married William Spry in 1852) was his sister.

36: Richard Allen's Star-Names: Their Lore and Meaning
Star-lore enthusiast Richard Hinckley Allen (1838-1908).
Richard Allen was interested in astronomy from childhood. He was born in the village of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where his father, Richard L. Allen, purchased a large tract of land in the 1830's.
Richard Allen briefly attended Yale College (later to become Yale University). He completed 1 year (with honour) at Yale College in the class of 1860, with the hope of becoming an astronomer. He dropped out because of permanent serious problems with his eyesight. He initially withdrew for a year but he then went into business with his father. From 1860 to 1865 he was actively involved in his father's export trade business. (His brother Arthur Allen became a minister.) He also spent some time traveling. He tried his hand at various business enterprises and became a moderately successful businessman. After the death of his father in 1869 he became the manager of his father's estate.
Richard Allen had a wide range of scientific interests and continued his interest in scientific pursuits as a life-time hobby. His pastimes included farming, stock raising, amateur ornithology, and astronomy. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Astronomical Society of the

Pacific, and the National Geographic Society. His research into star-names and star-lore was primarily pursued for his own personal enjoyment.
His wide range of interests and knowledge resulted in his friends naming him "the walking encyclopedia."
He lived most of his life in New Jersey either at Newark (his usual residence because of his business dealings in New York) or Chatham (his country home). In his latter years he spent more time at Chatham where he was an elder and trustee of the Ogden Presbyterian Church (and an important financial benefactor), and superintendent of the Sunday School.
He suffered from poor health in his later years and died after a severe bout of influenza which worsened into pneumonia. His death occurred 6 days after travelling to attend the funeral of his sister. At the time of his death the author was working on a revised edition but it remained unfinished. His book on star-names was only published after the encouragement of some close friends, and was the only book on astronomy that he published.

The original 1899 edition (U.S.A.), and the 1936 reprint (France), was titled Star-Names and Their Meanings. (The 1936 reprint is hardly mentioned and seems almost unknown.) The 1963 reprint title was Star-Names: Their Lore and Meaning. The 1936 reprint was simply a reprint of the original 1899 edition. The 1963 reprint only included grammatical corrections. (The original edition is now very scarce.) It remains a very influential book.
The book should really not be used as it is an uncritical compilation from out-dated secondary sources and contains numerous errors; especially regarding Arabic, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian constellations and star

names. At the time he wrote the information on non-European star/constellation names was very incomplete and often simply quite wrong. As examples: (1) Regarding his discussion of Arabic star names. Allen had no knowledge of Arabic and he uncritically relied upon Ideler's outdated book Sternnamen. Allen never made any attempt to check the accuracy of this secondary source he used with any of the primary sources - as Paul Kunitzsch did in the 1950s for his doctoral thesis. The Arabist scholar Paul Kunitzsch has demonstrated the unreliability of Ludwig Ideler as a reliable source for Arabic material. (2) The 1899 book is completely useless for Mesopotamian star and constellation names because important cuneiform sources - such as the Mul.Apin series - were not yet published. (3) The knowledge contained in Egyptian Astronomical Texts by Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker (3 Volumes, 1960-1969) was also not available.
At the time of his death the author was working on a revised edition but it remained unfinished. (The original edition is now very scarce.) No one has attempted a revision of Allen's book. Whilst some people may have considered the project there are numerous issues. Allen's book really requires a complete overhaul and doing such would require considerable effort. Some corrective articles by several authors have been published over the years in the journal Sky and Telescope. Allen used a limited number of references. Today there are a larger number of references to be consulted; principally in English, German, and French. Allen's book should not be used as it is an uncritical compilation from out-dated secondary sources and contains numerous errors; especially regarding Arabic, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian constellations and star names. At the time he wrote the information on non-European star/constellation names was very incomplete and often simply quite wrong. (As example: Regarding his discussion of Arabic star names. Allen had no knowledge of Arabic and he uncritically relied upon Ludwig Ideler's outdated book, Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen. He never made any attempt to check the accuracy of this secondary source he used with any primary sources - as Paul Kunitzsch did in the 1950s for his doctoral thesis.)
Though a number of his bibliographical references are obscure it is possible to successfully identify most of his main sources. In the Introduction to his book Richard Allen indicates the main core of his sources as comprising, Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen by Ludwig (some sources have Ludewig) Ideler (1809) (main source of Arabic and other European material); The Cycle of Celestial Objects by William Smyth (the edition used is not identified but either 2 volumes 1844, or the revised one volume edition by George Chambers, 1881) (the main source of Western historical star lore and general material); The Dawn of Astronomy by Norman Lockyer (1894) (the main source of Egyptian material); Observations of Comets: from B.C. 611 to A.D. 1640: extracted from the Chinese Annals by John Williams (1871) (a main source of Chinese material); A Dictionary of the Chinese Language by Robert Morrison (3 Parts, 1815-1823) (a main source of Chinese material); and unspecified publications by Johann Strassmaier and Joseph Epping, Archibald Sayce, Robert Brown Junior, Peter Jensen, and Fritz Hommel (the main sources of Mesopotamian material, generally circa 1895 latest). It is likely that publications by François Lenormant were also used. Paul Kunitzsch has demonstrated the unreliability of Ludewig Ideler as a reliable source for Arabic material. The historical chapters dealing with the solar zodiac and the lunar zodiac need to be ignored entirely.
As an example of how unreliable Richard Allen's book on star names can be simply refer to one of books by James Hewitt (one of the sources Allen uses). Primitive Traditional History (2 Volumes, 1907) will suffice as an illustrative example. James Hewitt is described by Allen as an "English essayist." Allen used material by Hewitt when discussing the identification of the star Vanant (See page 59 of the 1963 edition of Allen's book on Stars Names). James Hewitt (1835-1908) was actually a civil servant (Bengal Civil Service) Commissioner of Chutia Nagpur - for much of his career, and considered himself to be an anthropologist. All reviewers/commentators agree that Hewitt's books on what he calls "mythic history" are largely fantasies, and make no sense at all.
The Assyriologist and Panbabylonist Peter Jensen, in his 1890 book Die Kosmologie der Babylonier, proposed (erroneously) an original 6-constellation Babylonian zodiac (dating to circa 4000 BCE. Richard Allen was one of a number of people who picked up the idea and repeated it. Because Allen's book is dated and has been twice reprinted without corrections Jensen's dated and erroneous idea is still repeated. Allen wrote at a time when it was generally believed (without suitable evidence) that most of the constellations in the Greek sky originated circa 4000-3000 BCE.
Richard Allen stated that European star names came chiefly from the Arabs. Allen, who had no real understanding of Arabic, also concluded that many Arabic star-names were actually translations of Greek

descriptive terms transmitted through Arabic into Latin (and from Latin into English and other languages). When the linguist Maio Pei made a check of 183 English star-names he concluded that 125 were from Arabic, and 9 were from Arabic-Latin. (See: Story of the English Language by Mario Pei (1967; Page 225).) Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart (A Dictionary of Modern Star Names (2006; Page 11) write: "A statistical analysis of the 254 star names here presented reveals that (counting five double entries only once) 175 names (= 70%) are Arabic and 47 (= 19%) are Greek or Latin." The modern authority on such matters is Paul Kunitzsch. Emilie Savage-Smith wrote (Islamicate Celestial Globes (1985; Page 114)): "The star names used in the classical Islamic world were derived from two distinct sources: the names used by pre-Islamic Bedouins, and those transmitted from the Greek world. As Greek astronomy and astrology were accepted and elaborated, primarily through the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Almagest, the indigenous Bedouin star groupings were overlaid with the Ptolemaic constellations that we recognize today."
For Western constellations and star names use of Richard Allen's, Star-Names should be replaced with: Planetarium Babylonicum by Felix Gössmann (1950) (but now becoming outdated with two-thirds of his sources pre-dating 1920); Egyptian Astronomical Texts by Otto Neugebauer and Richard Parker (3 Volumes, 1960-1969); Gestirnnamen bei den indogermanischen Völken by Anton Scherer (1953); (importantly) Le vocabulaire latin de l'Astronomie by André Le Boeuffle (3 Volumes, 1973) (who traces both Greek and Babylonian antecedents for Latin constellation/star names); and Arabische Sternnamen in Europa by Paul Kunitzsch (1959); and for star lore use of Allen's book can be replaced with (importantly), Beyond the Blue Horizon: Myths and Legends of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets by Ed. Krupp (1991) and Mythen der Sterne by Friedrich Norman (1925); The New Patterns in the Sky: Myths and Legends of the Stars by Julius Staal (1988). Note: Regarding, Planetarium Babylonicum by Felix Gössmann (1950). Gössmann lists some 124 sources for his compilation. The book is now (2015) 65 years old and 40 percent of his sources are earlier than 1920 (i.e., over 95 years old. More recent is: Zvezdnoe nebo drevnei Mesopotamii: Shumeroakkadskie nazvaniia sozvezdii i drugikh svetil [The Star Heaven of Ancient Mesopotamia: Sumero-Akkadian Names of Constellations and Other Heavenly Bodies] by Gennadii Kurtik [Kurtig] (2007). The author of this Russian-language publication is a Russian historian of astronomy. The more accessible and reliable publication at present (2016) (but very brief) is, A Dictionary of Modern Star Names by Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart (2006). This revised 2nd edition of Short Guide to Modern Star Names and Their Derivations (1986) is a 76-page pamphlet. Like its 1986 predecessor it focuses on Western star names in current use and comprises an excellent English-language summary of 254 Western star names. The most recent and the most satisfactory likely identifications of ancient Egyptian constellations (with modern Western constellations) is set out in Table 6.1 (Pages 162-163) in Lull, José. and Belmonte, Antonio. (2009). "The constellations of ancient Egypt." In: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy. Identifications are made for 31 ancient Egyptian constellations.
See also the (English-language) article "Richard Hinckley Allen." by Lucy Morris in Popular Astronomy, Volume 14, 1906, Pages 592-594. Page XX: "Lastly do I thank my young friend Miss Lucy Noble Morris, of Morristown, for long-continued aid in various ways, especially in her tasteful selection of poetical illustrations." This is apparently a reference to Lucy Noble Morris, born August 18, 1892, Morristown, New Jersey, niece and adopted daughter of Harriet Morris (who had no natural children of her own), daughter of William S. Morris of Montclair, New Jersey. If correct, she was in her early teens when she wrote the biographical article. Life dates for Richard Allen: 1838-1908.]

Franz Xaver Kugler at Ignatiuskolleg, Valkenburg, Holland.
Franz Xaver Kugler SJ (chemist, mathematician, assyriologist, historian, chronologist, and theologian). Though obviously taken later in his life it would appear that this is the best existing portrait of him. (It may date to the mid-1920s - shortly before his final departure from Ignatiuskolleg, Valkenburg, in 1927.) Kugler was a remarkable polymath and largely a self-taught assyriologist. (Note: Due to the modern influencing mistake of Alfred de Grazia (The Velikovsky Affair (1966) many people still mistakenly write Kugler's middle name as Xavier instead of Xaver.)
Franz Kugler was born in Königsbach, (sometimes mentioned as Königsberg?), Germany (Rheinland-Pfalz [= Rhineland-Palatinate]) in 1862 and died in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1929, in a Catholic nursing home. His birth-place Haus Königsbach ("Kings Brook House") may still exist. The house is/was located at number 21 in the re-named street Franz-Kugler-Strasse, in what is now Neustadt/Weinstrasse, Germany. Apparently Kugler's birthplace was also the former manor house of the Auxiliary Bishop of Speyer (no other details presently known). In 1885 Franz Kugler received a PhD in chemistry. (At least one European library (in Paris) holds a copy of this.) In 1886 he entered the Jesuit Order and in 1893 he was ordained a priest. (During the course of his Jesuit training he may also have earned an additional Dr. phll. (= Ph.D.).) In 1897, at the age of 35, the Jesuit Order appointed him Professor of Higher Mathematics at the newly built IgnatiusCollege, Valkenburg (in Holland).
After the death of Joseph Epping in 1894 Kugler expressed his interest in taking over and continuing Epping's work. However, this task was originally assigned to Joseph Hontheim SJ. Hontheim took up Epping's researches in 1894 and sporadically continued with them until 1898. After the first year or two Hontheim had effectively ceased work on cuneiform astronomy. Due to the increasing number of other commitments that prevented him from proceeding effectively the Jesuit Order, in 1897, then assigned Kugler to takeover from Hontheim and continue Epping's studies. This is exactly what Kugler had wanted and had requested.
Kugler's early focus (pre World War I) was Seleucid texts dealing with mathematical astronomy. Later (post World War I) Kugler focused on calendars and chronology (primarily of the Seleucid era). However, Kugler also extended his investigations to astronomical texts preceding the Seleucid era (by several centuries).

Title page of Kugler's first erudite study of Babylonian scientific astronomy.
Kugler's monumental work on the Babylonian theory of the moon appeared in 1900 (Die Babylonische Mondrechnung [Babylonian Theory of the Moon]) and that of the planets in 1907 (Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Volume 1 [Development of Babylonian Planetary Knowledge]). Volume 2 and supplements of SSB basically contain essays on a variety of topics relating to Babylonian astronomy. Kugler's recovery of Babylonian lunar theory in his Die Babylonische Mondrechnung was described by Noel Swerdlow (Ancient Astronomy and Celestial Divination (1999)) as "the finest, the most original, and the most difficult study carried out in the history of science up to the date of its publication."
Babylonian lunar theory exists in two distinct forms, now known as System A and System B. In this book Franz Kugler (1862-1929) made the first identification and analysis of Systems A and B (which he called Systems II and I) of Babylonian lunar theory. Kugler also made the first identification of the relation of the parameters of System B to the lunar theory of Hipparchus and Ptolemy.
Kugler's book contains a complete discussion of the computation of the syzygies according to System B (called "System I" by Kugler), and an explanation of the most essential features of System A (called "System II" by Kugler). In his investigations Kugler largely focused on System B. This was because Epping's autograph of BM 34066 provided him with an almost complete ephemeris for the new moons of two years

computed according to System B. The recovery of System A presented an immense challenge. As the relevant ephemerides were in a poorly preserved state he was obliged to recover the main features of System A primarily from a text for lunar eclipses. This text only provided the elements at either six or five month intervals.
The classification of the ephemerides into the two "Systems," A and B, is based on the different way in which the solar anomaly is accounted for i.e., step function versus linear zigzag function. Each System consists of a set of arithmetic functions tabulated in columns in ephemerides and auxiliary tables, which enable the calculation of the times and dates of the syzygies and the magnitudes of eclipses. In System A the sun is assumed to move with constant velocity on two complementary arcs of the ecliptic (an arithmetical simplification which is not in accord with observation). In System B the successive positions of the sun are listed month by month, though these numbers do not form an arithmetic series because the velocity of the sun is not constant.
System A appears to have been created in the second half of the 5th-century BCE. System B, which is the simpler of the two, was probably created after System A had been created. Both systems were used until the advent of the Christian era, not only in Babylon but also in Uruk.
Kugler analyzed a large number of ephemerides of the Moon to make the identification that they can be divided into two systems. His identification and analysis of System I (which Otto Neugebauer later renamed System B) was based primarily on columns A to L of cuneiform text BM 34066, dated to the Seleucid Era 103 to 101 BCE. His identification of System II (which Otto Neugebauer later renamed System A) was laboriously reconstructed from multiple fragments of Babylonian lunar ephemerides (he relied primarily on BM 45688, which lists only oppositions which are lunar eclipse possibilities) and a procedure text BM 32651 (which contains the rules for the computation of several columns of the lunar ephemerides of System A).

Title page of Kugler's erudite series of studies on Babylonian scientific astronomy.
Title page of volume 1 of Kugler's multi-volume (but uncompleted) masterwork on Babylonian astronomy, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel [Star Science and Star Lore in Babylon]. This volume comprises Franz Kugler's masterful identification and analysis of Babylonian planetary theory. Copies are very difficult to come by on the used book market. Like nearly all of Kugler's work it was never translated into English. To some extent, after 1914 Kugler suspended the publication of SSB (at least along the lines he had originally announced for it). From its inception he had announced that the first 2 volumes, would deal with observational data, and would be followed by a third volume dealing with mythology and cosmological concepts. The third volume (and the forth) was never published (and likely he never began work on it). His publication in 1927 of the booklet entitled Sybillinischer Sternkampf und Phaëthon in naturgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung [The Sybilline Battle of the Stars and Phaethon Seen as Natural History] was unrelated to SSB.

This first volume of the monumental Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel (2 volumes and 3 supplements in 7 parts, 1907-1935 (and corrective sheets occasionally issued)) served to complement his earlier study of Babylonian lunar theory. All appeared in the same format. In his introduction to SSB1 Kugler informs his readers that the purely astronomical and chronological investigations set out in his book rely mainly on the previously unpublished cuneiform descriptions that had been copied by Johann Strassmaier SJ during his years of work at the British Museum, and are now being made available for the first time.
Babylonian planetary theory had less ambitious goals than those for lunar theory. Babylonian planetary theory consisted of predicting the longitudes and dates of the principal synodic phenomena (i.e., synodic phases) for each planet. Babylonian planetary theory appears less sophisticated and less complete in comparison to lunar theory but this appears to have been a more matter of choice than of knowledge. The results had lesser importance than for lunar theory and so the motivation for the time-consuming calculations was absent.
The contents of later volumes of SSB basically comprise collected papers on a variety of subjects relating to Babylonian astronomy (including the identification of the Babylonian constellations listed in Mul.Apin tablet 1). During his later years Kugler devoted less time to Babylonian astronomy and transferred his attention to problems of chronology (including biblical chronology).
Kugler's pioneering work on Babylonian astronomy was never completed. His Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel was planned for completion in 4 volumes. Between 1907 and 1924 he completed 2 volumes including 2 supplements in 6 parts. (The publication of an SSB 3 (III. Buch.) was anticipated after the completed publication of SSB 2 (II. Buch.) in 1924, but never eventuated. On the cover of SSB II. Buch. II. Teil. 2. Heft. published in 1924 appeared '(schluss des buches)' = 'end of the book.' It applied both to Volume 2 as well as SSB. The wider SSB project had been abandoned in favour of his pursuit of chronological matters. The focus of the last part of SSB in 1924 was on chronological issues.) After his death in 1929 a 3rd supplementary volume was completed in 1935 by Johann Schaumberger. This contained (completed) some of Kugler's unpublished material. Schaumberger, a member of the Redemptorist Order at Gars-am-Inn, Germany, had several years previously announced his intention to take up and continue/complete Kugler's work. Schaumberger, like Kugler, was a competent assyriologist, and astronomer. In 1931 he announced his intention to bring Kugler's unfinished SSB project to a satisfactory conclusion by publishing 2 further volumes (supplements), one of which would include a complete index to SSB. Basically it was Schaumberger's intention that the numerous unpublished astronomical cuneiform texts in Kugler's estate would be published to form a completion to SSB 1 and 2. However, after World War II, he worked slowly and sporadically on the project. The unfortunate result was that at the time of Schaumberger's death in 1955 the planned 4th supplementary volume to SSB was unfinished. It was to have been the concluding supplement with an index to the whole of SSB 1 and 2. It was announced on the back cover of Schaumberger's 3rd supplement to SSB (published 1935) as being in preparation, but never appeared in the 20 remaining years of his life. Schaumberger's published supplement and planned further supplement did not contain the material or address the subjects that Kugler had originally (and ambitiously) planned for SSB 3 (Sub-title: God types and cult forms) and SSB 4 (Sub-title: Astronomical and meteorological observations). (But Schaumberger's 3. Ergänzungsheft did complete/progress studies that Kugler had left incomplete at the time of his death.) Kugler's Von Moses bis Paulus (1922) and the content of SSB published in 1924 demonstrated his later (time-consuming) distraction with chronological issues. (Volumes 3 and 4, if completed, would likely have comprised 100-150 pages each.)
Overall, Kugler's publications along with Schaumberger's contribution to SSB in 1935 (and articles), dealt with lunar theory, planetary theory, astronomical observations, metrology, meteorological observations, uranography, astral omens, astral mythology, panbabylonism, calendars, and chronology. His SSB (and DBM) contained many of Johann Strassmaier's autographs of cuneiform tablets, and Strassmaier's/Kugler's phonetic transcriptions, and Kugler's German-language translations, and explanatory discussions. Some material of the type that would have comprised SSB 3 had appeared in his book Im Bannkreis Babels (1910) and a number of articles. (Babylonian astral religion received attention in SSB 2.) Some of the material also appeared in SSB and the 2 Ergänzung. Some material of the type that would have comprised SSB 4 appeared in a number of articles. The Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. 3. Ergänzungsheft zum ersten und zweiten Buch (1935) by Johannes Schaumberger comprises studies that Kugler had left incomplete at the time of his death. Schaumberger was able to make further progress or complete these. (Like Kugler, Schaumberger also involved himself with chronological issues. In the last years of his life Schaumberger involved himself

(1949, 1954-1955) in determining the chronology of the Old Akkadian and Ur III periods. Other distractions from SSB included carrying out the arduous calculations (mostly very accurately) for Richard Parker and Waldo Dubberstein's Babylonian Chronology: 626 B.C. - A.D. 75 (1956).) Later studies/works by assyriologists have filled the gap for SSB 3, even if not in the manner Kugler would perhaps have chosen. An early example is Tammuz and Ishtar by Stephen Langdon (1914). Also, a number of scholars put together astral material on Babylonian gods/goddesses that appeared throughout (early parts of) SSB. Examples are Pantheon Babylonicum by Anton Deimel/Nikolaus Schneider (1914, in Latin); and Die Religion Babylons und Assyriens by Morris Jastrow (2 Volumes, 1905-1912, in German). Babylonian meteorological observations were quite selective. One of Kugler's papers in SSB 2.1 (1909) dealt with meteorology. A lengthy paper by Kugler on Babylonian meteorology appeared in Revue d'assyriologie et d'archéologie orientale, Tome 8, 1911, Pages 107-130. (It was through Kugler that an insight into the meteorological system of the Babylonians was first directly obtained. The meteorological observations of the Babylonians were quite selective - focussing on optical phenomena, especially halos.) Other sources include: The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, Volume 34, 1908 (article based in part on the lecture "Die Anfänge der Meteorologie" (= "The Dawn of Meteorology"), by Gustav Hellman, published in Meteorologische Zeitschrift Braunschweig, Band 25[26?], 1908, November, Pages 481-491; Arthur Ungnad, Orientalistische Literaturzeitung, Band 15, 1912, Columns 446-449; and Hermann Hunger, Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie, Band 56, 1976, Columns 234-260; J. Neumann, Bulletin American Meteorological Society, Volume 58, 1977, Pages 1050-1055; and J. Neumann and Simo Parpola, "Wind Vanes in Ancient Mesopotamia," Bulletin American Meteorological Society, Volume 64?, 1983, Pages 1141-1143. Currently, (2010) Enrique Jiménez (Madrid, Spain) his completing his PhD project "The Winds in Cuneiform Literature." The only true observational texts are (1) (Astrological) Reports to the (Assyrian) Kings, (2) Astronomical Diaries and (3) Tables/Texts of Specific Astronomical Phenomena. These texts have now been comprehensively published. The (Astrological) Reports to the (Assyrian) Kings by Simo Parpola and also by Hermann Hunger. The Astronomical Diaries by Abraham Sachs and (principally) Hermann Hunger. Tables/Texts of Specific Astronomical Phenomena (which include records of specific types of observations, including eclipses, lunar phenomena, observations/sightings of particular planets) have been published by a variety of scholars. Also, on Babylonian catasterisms see: Cooley, Jeffrey. (2006). "A Star is Born: Mesopotamian and Classical Catasterisms." (Humanitas, Fall, Volume 30, Issue 1, Pages 8-16).
Kugler in his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Erg. 1, used star-lists (2) (3) and (6) in the Mul.Apin series, and computed for 500 BCE at Babylon. Kugler also identified the Babylonian constellations by assembling a large number of statements in cuneiform texts about simultaneously rising and setting stars/constellations, and also about the angular distances between certain stars. This involved Kugler in a great deal of labour but his results were highly reliable.
Not to be overlooked is the pioneering research of the Italian astronomer and science historian Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) into the identification of Babylonian constellation/star names. In the late 19thcentury Schiaparelli carried out independent pioneering investigations into the identification of Babylonian stars, planets, and constellations/star names. a notebook (now in the Archive of the Brera Observatory, in "Cartella N.426") entitled "Nomi di stelle e di costellazioni e di pianeti presso i Babilonesi." During Schiaparelli's time the only published Babylonian constellation/star name identifications (with modern named constellations/stars) were those by the pioneering researches of Joseph Epping and Franz Kugler, and consisted of some 50 identifications. Kugler's Schiaparelli identified 120 Babylonian constellation/star names using the autographs published by James Craig in his Astrological-Astronomical Texts (1899). Schiaparelli achied the identification by systematically analyzing their position relative to other known bodies or peculiar characteristics mentioned in the texts. Kugler's volumes focused on the detailed identification of Babylonian constellation/star names only appeared after Schiaparelli's death (Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. Ergänzungen zum ersten und zweiten Buch. I. Teil. (1913); and Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. Ergänzungen zum ersten und zweiten Buch. II. Teil. (1914)).
Appendix: Observational and Theoretical Texts
Mesopotamian astral texts can be classed as astrological, astronomical, and astral-mythological.
Babylonian astronomers created a large and diverse body of astral texts consisting of observational astronomy, mathematical astronomy, omen astrology, and zodiacal astrology. The majority of these texts

come from Seleucid archives. The majority of cuneiform tablets from Hellenistic Babylon have an astronomical content. Most observational and mathematical tablets are readily available in two standard works. Observational astronomical texts are published by Sachs in LBAT (1955) and mathematical astronomical texts are published by Neugebauer in ACT (1955). Approximately 300 mathematical texts are known. These represent the highest achievement of Babylonian astronomical endeavour.
Note: Astronomical diaries and related observational texts have been found only in Babylon, Uruk, and Nippur, mathematical astronomy texts have been found only in Babylon and Uruk, Neo Babylonian and Late Babylonian copies of traditional astronomical and astrological texts (e.g., Mul.Apin, ziqpu star lists, and omen texts) were found at Sippar and Borsippa.

38: Ernst Weidner's Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie
Ernest Weidner.
The assyriologist Ernest [Ernst] Weidner (1891-1976) was an expert on cuneiform script literature and assyriology. Has an outstanding cuneiform philologist and is considered to be one of the most outstanding cuneiform philologists of the 20th-century. Weidner was described as a modest man. As a student he read Oriental studies in Leipzig and Berlin. Weidner specialised in the study of Babylonian astronomy, astrology, and calendars. His brilliance was recognised whilst he was still in his (late) teens. He began publishing books and articles on Babylonian astronomy whilst still in his (late) teens. (He began with the study of early, premathematical astronomy.) The first assertion of cultural contact between Enochic astronomy and Babylonian astronomy was made by Weidner in 1916. Later in life he obtained an academic position at the University of Graz (Professor für Altorientalistik). (Univ.-Prof. Dr. Erika Bleibtreu (Professorin für Altorientalistik (= Professor of Ancient Near Eastern Studies) studied ‘Keilschriftforschung’ under Ernst Weidner in Graz 1958 – 1962.) In 1955 Weidner joined the Austrian Academy of Sciences.
Weidner graduated (PhD) in 1922 from the University of Leipzig. (It appears his doctoral thesis was on the Babylonian constellations; especially the constellations of the zodiac: Der babylonische Fixsternhimmel. I. Die Gestirne des Tierkreisgürtels.) He was a student of the assyriologist Felix Peiser. (It has also been stated he was a student of Alfred Jeremias.) His Habilitation on the reliefs of the Assyrian kings was completed in 1942 (Die Reliefs der assyrischen Könige). It focused on reliefs in England, the Vatican City, and Italy. This qualified him as a lecturer at the University of Graz. Until 1942 Weidner lived in Berlin (relying on journalism as a principal means of income). During his early career he focused on Babylonian astronomy. He first focused on Babylonian pre-mathematical astronomy. He then focused on Babylonian chronology and did excellent work in this area. Then he turned his investigations to the omen series Enūma Anu Enlil (but

only on the first 50 tablets). At the beginning of 1943, Weidner gained the position of Professor (Professor für Altorientalistik) in the Department of Oriental Research at the Karl-Franzens-Universität, Graz.
In 1924 Weidner published the shadow tables in tablet 2 of the series Mul.Apin. In his early career he also helped to edit 2 volumes of Hittite texts from Boghazkoi. Weidner had (erroneously) concluded (Studien zur hethitischen Sprachwissenschaft, 1917) that Hittite was a Caucasian language, not an Indo-European language, and showed reluctance to abandon this belief (which he did by 1920). Friedrich Hrozný (a Czech professor at the University of Vienna, eventually given the honour of the title "father of Hittitology") was successful in arguing that the Hittite language had linguistic affiliations with Indo-European vocabulary.
Weidner studied the conduct in the harems in recent times (of the Ottoman Empire) and (mistakenly) applied this to his otherwise excellent study of the harem in the Assyrian courts. See: "Hof- und Harems-Erlasse assyrischer Konige aus dem 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr." ["Palace and harem edicts of Assyrian kings of the second millennium BC."] (AfO, 17, 1954-1956, 257-293).
As a young assyriologist Ernst Weidner was strongly influenced by Felix Peiser who was editor of the journal Orientalistische Literaturzeitung and used it as a platform for his Panbabylonist views. The very young Weidner was also a convinced Panbabylonist and an active supporter of the Panbabylonist ideas of Hugo Winckler and Alfred Jeremias. His first substantial publication was Beitrage zur Babylonischen Astronomie (1911). In 1923 he began his own periodical Archiv für Keilschriftforschung. The Journal of the American Oriental Society (Volume 60? Pages 79-80 carried the announcement: "Dr Ernst F. Weidner, Berlin-Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorferstr. 95, announces that he is about to begin the private publication of a periodical, Archiv für Keilschriftforschung, which will appear beginning 1923 in quarterly issues of 48 pages each, long folio size and shape (approximately "foolscap"), "clearly and legibly typed and multigraphed." ... The content will be devoted to cuneiform .... Contributions are invited from scholars in these lines all over the world; they may be composed in German, English, French or Italian." (In order to save the expense of typesetting the journal was prepared as camera ready copy or similar?) With the issue of Volume 3 in 1926 the name of the periodical was changed to Archive für Orientforschung. (The periodical was published direct by Ernst Weidner as the editor.) Weidner remained its editor until his death. (Its address, and his address, at his death was Goethestrasse 43, A-8010, Graz, Austria.)
From 1925 to 1943 he also edited the journal Mitteilungen der Althistorischen Gesellschaft. He was also a long-time editor of the Reallexikon der Assyriologie (an Encyclopedia of Assyriology issued in facsimile).
At times Weidner made available the contents of cuneiform tablets still in private collections (e.g., MS KK, in 1936).
Following the death of the British assyriologist Theophilus Pinches in 1927, Weidner made inquiries regarding any unpublished assyriological work that Pinches might have left. (Likely his inquiries did not extend to the British Museum.) One result of material obtained was "Creation of Man and the Fixing of the Anunnaki." by Ernst Weidner in Archive für Orientforschung (1936). It was later translated into English and published in the Journal of the Victoria Institute, Volume 70, 1938. (See page 286 for a brief background by the British translator.)
Unlike Peiser's approach as editor of Orientalistische Literaturzeitung Weidner did not make Archive für Orientforschung a platform for Panbabylonist views. (Circa 1918, Ernst Weidner, the last champion of the great antiquity of Babylonian astronomy, tried to prove that the Saros must have been known at least 1000 BCE, but he was not successful in this.) The journal published scholarly papers encompassing a wide outlook and primarily dealt with cuneiform material. In his periodical Weidner published, in the 1940s and 1950s, a series of valuable papers on the first 50 tablets comprising the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil. Both Ernst Weidner and Franz Kugler, the trenchant scholarly critic of Panbabylonism and the leading expert on Babylonian astronomy, were mutually combative and when Kugler died Weidner made only a brief mention of such in his periodical.
Weidner deciphered and commented on numerous cuneiform texts in the collections in Berlin and the British Museum.

Albert Grayson, in the Introduction to his book Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 (1972, Page XIX) writes: "The first volume covers the period from the earliest inscriptions to the end of the reign of Ashurresha-ishi I (1133-1116 B.C.) .... For this first volume my work has greatly benefited from the research of Ernest F. Weidner who has edited and commented upon virtually every inscription included here. Weidner's publications, Die Inschriften der Altassyrischen Könige (in collaboration with E. Ebeling and B. Meissner, Leipzig, 1926) and Die Inschriften Tukulti-Ninurtas I. und seiner Nachfolger (Graz, 1959) as well as numerous articles in his Archiv für Orientforschung, are models of careful philological research."
Ernst Weidner was described by C. W. Ceram (actually the German journalist Kurt Marek, 1915-1972) as rather ponderous and grave (Narrow Pass, Black Mountain (1956), Page 77). In his book Gods, Graves and Scholars (1994, Page 213), Ceram [Marek] describes Weidner as a "modest man." He was also described as a great hulk of a man. During World War I he was conscripted into the Heavy Artillery and made the rank of Corporal. In his book Gods, Graves and Scholars (1994, Page 213), Ceram [Marek] describes Weidner as "... one of the most peculiar among the often very peculiar Assyriologists. For twenty years Weidner worked as a journalist (an assistant editor) in the offices of the Berliner Ilustrirte Zeitung (a weekly newspaper - each issue containing the highlights of the week - mostly consisting of pictures)." He edited serial stories and crossword puzzles. During this time Weidner published important articles (academic journals and booklets/pamphlets) on Assyrian chronology . Also, he edited his international scholarly journal Archiv für Orientforschung. Its press run was only a few hundred copies and went only to universities and isolated scholars. Weidner remained at Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung until 1942, when he was prevailed upon to accept a professorship in Austria at the University of Graz (Professor für Altorientalistik). This coincided with the completion of his Habilitation () in 1942.(It appears he was happy to escape the disruptions and uncertainties associated with the constant allied bombing of Berlin.) Weidner remained in Graz until his death.
Ernst Weidner was in competition with Franz Kugler (the leading authority on Babylonian astronomy) to understand Babylonian astronomy. There was a long and acrimonious controversy on aspects of Babylonian astronomy between Ernst Weidner and Franz Kugler. It centred on (1) the age of Babylonian 'scientific' astronomy, (2) the visibility of the phases of Venus, and (3) whether the Babylonians were aware of precession. (There was also a long and acrimonious controversy on aspects of Babylonian astronomy between Paul Schnabel and Franz Kugler.)

Front cover of Weidner's first volume of a projected 3-volume study of Babylonian astronomy.
Weidner's early announced plan to publish a comprehensive 3-volume study of Babylonian astronomy titled Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie was abandoned after publication of Volume 1 in 1915. It was a study of Babylonian constellations and star names. Regrettably, it was published without pages 147-180 which had been printed for it. It is possible that the contents of these pages later appeared in journal articles. The Best Books: Volume 5, Literature and Philology (1931) included Weidner's Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie. The book was reprinted in 1976 but is now thoroughly dated and unreliable. The usefulness of Weidner's early publications on Babylonian uranography were limited by his trenchant Panbabylonist views and his readiness to assign dates for constellation and star list material to the third and fourth millennium BCE. His sky map of Mesopotamian constellations for 2000 BCE is his own particular fantasy.
Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie by Ernst Weidner (1914) was written from the Panbabylonism standpoint and is a veritable wonderland of Panbabylonism. (It was completed several years prior to its publication in 1914, and was in press from 1913.) In Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie Weidner declared a sophisticated Babylonian astronomy existed at least circa 2,000 BCE, misunderstood and incorrectly used 'The Hilprecht Text' (HS 245) – which he could not date (but is Middle Babylonian Period circa latter part of the 2nd-millennium BCE) - as evidence of an early sophisticated mathematical astronomy (before the Kassite Period), and asserted texts from the library of King Ashurbanipal go back to at least 4,500 BCE. (For Weidner 'The Hilprecht Text,' which he believed likely dated to the 3rd-millennium BCE,

provided evidence for an equator-based system of coordinates for measuring the the locations of fixed stars.) Weidner also wrongly claimed that the Babylonians identified the Pole of the Equator and the Pole of the Ecliptic. In Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie Weidner holds that (Pages 32-34) Nibiru is the Pole of the Ecliptic (= Enlil is the Pole of the Ecliptic), and (Page 97) kakkab MU-SIR-KEŠ-DA = kakkab Niru, is the Pole of the Equator (= Anu is the Pole of the Equator).) (It is now clear that the Mesopotamians used the term 'Nibiru' to mark an astronomical event; a "crossing" at some point in the sky of Jupiter, Mercury, and a star.) In dealing with the star-list from Boghazkoi (Bogazkoi), Weidner mistranslated the names of 4 stars as planets.
At the time of his death he had accumulated large quantities of unpublished material. However, there was nothing dealing with a comprehensive treatment of the Mul.Apin series.
In 1922 Weidner published the (then) valuable bibliographical work, Die Assyriologie: 1914-1922. It still remains useful.

Portrait of Carl Bezold published with his obituary in ZA.
The German assyriologist Carl Bezold. He was born at Donauwörth in Bavaria in 1859 and died in Heidelberg (Germany) in 1922. Carl Bezold studied Semitic languages at Munich, Strassburg, and Leipzig. He graduated (under Friedrich Delitzsch) with work on epigraphy at Leipzig in 1880 and received his Habilitation for Semitic languages at Munich in1883. In 1883 Bezold was a Privatdozent at the Universität München. Bezold became the editor for the journal Zeitschrift für Assyriologie (a major journal for Assyriology) in 1886, and held the position until 1922. After Bezold had worked at the British Museum (1888-1893) he returned to Germany and was appointed to the chair for Semitic languages at Heidelberg in 1894. He actually lived in London (England) from 1888 to 1895 whilst engaged in preparing a catalogue of the British Museum tablet collections (Kouyunjik Collection). At this time the employment policy at some German universities caused formally delineated as dealing with "Semitic languages," to focus on Assyrian

studies. Bezold's appointment at Heidelberg, as ordinarius in 1894 was part of the beginning of this process. Bezold also joined the German association for Islamic studies. (See: German Orientalism: The Study of the Middle East and Islam from 1800 to 1945 by Ursula Wokoeck (2009).
The 1891 England Census gives the following information: Name: Charles Bezold; Spouse Abele Bezold; Birth: about 1860 - Germany; Residence: 1891 - St Pancreas, London, England.
His knowledge of assyriology was considered encyclopaedic. He was proficient in numerous ancient and modern languages including Chinese, Assyrian, Arabic, Syriac, English, French, and Italian. Bezold was initially interest in the Chinese language and script. He also translated Syriac material. In 1888 he edited and published the Syriac and Arabic edition of the text of the Book of the Cave of Treasures. In 1909 he edited/collated (and translated) and published (with critical notes) the entire text of the Ge’ez (Ethiopic) epic Kebra Nagast. (But did not engage in the task of disentangling the literary sources. He left this as a challenge to future scholars.) From 1886 to 1915 he was the editor of Zeitschrift für Assyriologie.
In 1894 he was appointed Professor of Semitic Philology and Director of Oriental Seminars at the University of Heidleberg. He held this prestigious academic position until his death. In 1912, to satisfy the needs for an Assyrian dictionary that incorporated the tremendous body of new materials, Bezold initiated a new multivolume dictionary/theasaurus project under the sponsorship of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. However, Bezold's advanced age and the size of the undertaking and forced him to relinquish the ambitious project and to prepare instead a brief glossary based on his copious collection of material. The manuscript of the glossary, completed by Bezold just before his death in 1922, was edited by a student of his, Albrecht Gotze (Goetze), and published as Babylonisch-assyrisches Glossar (1926). Though without references and bibliographical discussions, the Babylonisch-assyrisches Glossa served for many years as a useful tool for students of Assyriology.
Bezold was a friend of both Johann Strassmaier and Franz Kugler. Whilst in London he was assisted by Strassmaier in the preparation of the Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets of the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum (5 Volumes, 1889-1899). Kugler was involved in several years of self-training to learn cuneiform script. However, between 1900 and 1907, Kugler also, for 6 to 12 months, "formally" studied cuneiform philology in Heidelberg. It can be reasonably speculated that Kugler went to Carl Bezold at the University of Heidelberg for such. Bezold's 1911 pamphlet Astronomie, Himmelsschau und Astrallehre bei den Babylonier strongly defended Kugler's chronology of Babylonian scientific astronomy and also his critique of Panbabylonism.

The pamphlet Zenit- und Aequatorialgestirne am babylonischen Fixsternhimmel (1913) was an early study of Mul.Apin tablet 1 and the identification of Babylonian constellations with modern star groups. Carl Bezold, with the assistance of August Kopff and the participation of Franz Boll, examined the contents of BM 86378. The identification of 78 Babylonian constellations and star names is made.
The 59-page pamphlet gives the transcription and (German-language) translation of BM 86378 and a detailed comparison of the results of Franz Kugler, Ernst Weidner, and August Kopff and Carl Bezold, in identifying the stars and constellations listed. The pamphlet is valuable in reproducing the particular cuneiform signs for all 78 constellations and star names investigated.
Circa 1900 little was known with certainty regarding the identification of of Babylonian constellation names and star names. Though cuneiform script had been successfully deciphered for decades the meanings of numerous words either remained unknown or were incorrectly understood. The types of astronomical texts available circa 1900 were (1) late Babylonian observational texts (4th to 1st century BCE); (2) mathematicalastronomical texts (from the latest period of Babylonian astronomy); and (3) omina literature regarding celestial events and (4) a few lists of constellation/star names. The observational texts and mathematicalastronomical texts contained few names of celestial bodies - mostly the names of planets and the

constellations of the zodiac. The type of information contained in the constellation/star lists in Mul.Apin tablet 1 (BM 86378), an autograph copy of which was first published by the British Assyriologist Leonard King in 1912, provided a unique opportunity for the identification of Babylonian constellations.
Mul.Apin tablet 1 is the foundation for all identifications of Babylonian constellations/star names. Ernst Weidner incorrectly believed that the 'Astrolabes' (especially 'Astrolabe Berlin') provided the means for the successful identification of constellations/star names.
The primary effort in successfully identifying the constellations and star names listed in BM 86378 was carried out by first by Franz Kugler and then by Carl Bezold and August Kopff. The Kopff-Bezold results largely agree with the identifications made by Franz Kugler in his Supplement 1 (1913) to his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. Further work by later scholars largely confirmed their results. There were 16 agreements in identification between Kugler, Weidner, and Kopff-Bezold. The lower number is due to the lesser number of identifications made by Ernst Weidner.
August Kopff was a German astronomer who worked in Heidelberg; then Berlin. In Berlin he was Director of the Institute for Astronomical Calculation of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-University (now the HumboldtUniversity).
Franz Boll was a renowned German classical philologist who specialized in ancient astronomy. He had the ability to combine astronomy, religion, and literature with great originality. His death in 1924 at the age of 57 put an end to his further masterly contributions to elucidating little-known traditions. His last academic position was Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Heidelberg.
Sections of the Mul.Apin series have been the key to attempts to reasonably identify Babylonian constellations. The two tablets comprising the Mul.Apin series are essentially a series of structured lists grouped into 18 sections. Tablet 1 basically contains eight sections (including five star lists):
(1) A list of 33 stars in the Path of Anu, 23 stars in the Path of Enlil, and 15 stars in the Path of Ea.
(2) A sequential list of (heliacal rising) dates in the ideal calendar (i.e., based on a year comprised of 12 months of 30 days each) on which 36 fixed stars and constellations rose heliacally.
(3) A list of simultaneously rising and setting constellations.
(4) Time intervals between the heliacal rising dates of some selected stars.
(5) The visibility of the fixed stars in the East and the West.
(6) A list of 14 ziqpu-stars (i.e., stars which culminate overhead).
(7) The relation between the culmination of zipqu-stars and their heliacal rising.
(8) A list of stars and planets in the path of the moon. (The beginning of the second tablet continues the listing of (8) in tablet 1.)
The key problem with the star-list data contained in the Mul.Apin series is that it is not quantifiable (i.e., precisely defined) and appropriate assumptions are required to be made (i.e., of the stars forming each constellation and which of these stars were listed to rise heliacally).
People have chosen to use different star-list data from the Mul.Apin series in order to identify Babylonian constellations. Kugler in his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Erg. 1, used lists (2) (3) and (6) and computed for 500 BCE at Babylon. (Kugler also identified the Babylonian constellations by assembling a large number of statements in cuneiform texts about simultaneously rising and setting stars/constellations, and also about the angular distances between certain stars. This involved Kugler in a great deal of labour but his results were highly reliable.) Kopff used the same lists and computed for 600 BCE at Nineveh. I am presently unsure what lists Weidner used and what date and location he computed for. Later researchers used different lists. The German assyriologist Johann Schaumberger in his Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Erg. 3, used lists (1) and (2). The Dutch mathematician Bartel van der Waerden in his Anfänge der

astronomie (1966) used lists (2) and (4). List (4) is compiled from list (2) and its data is most subject to inaccuracy. Many significant differences exist between the identifications made by these four scholars. Erica Reiner and David Pingree, Babylonian Planetary Omens: Part Two (1981), using lists (3) and (6) in conjunction with a planetarium projector, concluded that the data best fit the date 1000 BCE and the location of Nineveh (circa 36° north). List (3) is independent of the schematic dates of risings in list (2).Also, the simultaneously setting constellations of list (3) are clearly determined by observation. List (3) was also the foundation for the constellation identifications (and the date and place of the observations) made by Herman Hunger and David Pingree in their Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (1999). They write (Page 66): "The third list in MUL.APIN is of the simultaneous risings and settings of constellations. Whereas the parallel passage at the end of section three of "Astrolabe B" was simply a meaningless rearrangement of the preceding list of three constellations in each month, List III of MUL.APIN is independent of the schematic dates of rising in List II and the simultaneously setting constellations are clearly determined by observation. This list is the foundation of our identifications of the constellations and of our determination of the time (ca. -1000) and place (ca. 36° N) of the observations."
In 2007 the Dutch assyriologist and astronomer Teije de Jong published the results of his analysis of the date of the rising star lists (2) and (4) in Mul.Apin. Only those stars/constellations securely identified with known stars were used in the analysis. He concluded: (1) "The observations underlying the dates of the first appearance of stars and constellations in star list II and IV of MUL.APIN date from -1300 ± 150 BC." (2) "The observations were carried out in Babylon or at some other location with geographic latitude -32°." (See: de Jong, Teije. (2007). "Astronomical dating of the rising star list in MUL.APIN." (Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, Band 97, Pages 107-120).)
As stated above, the data contained in the Mul.Apin series is not quantifiable (i.e., precisely defined) and appropriate assumptions are required to be made (i.e., of the stars forming each constellation and which of these stars were listed to rise heliacally). In a Hastro-L posting (June 5, 2007) the assyriologist Hermann Hunger explained: "The tablets contain no observations. They state on which calendar date certain phenomena (mostly risings and settings) are supposed to occur. Since that calendar used real lunar months, and years consisting of either 12 or 13 such months, the date of a stellar rising, e.g., cannot occur on the same date each year. Assuming that the dates given in the text are the result of averaging, one can use them as if they were observations." The most recent informed attempt to use the data contained in the Mul.Apin series was carried out by the American astronomer Brad Schaefer. The MUL.APIN series collectively contains nearly 200 different 'idealised' astronomical observations, including measurements related to several constellations. This included the day each year that certain constellations first appeared in the dawn sky. These dates change over the millennia because of a tiny wobble in the Earth's axis. By studying these dates and other astronomical information, such as the dates certain constellations were directly overhead, Schaefer statistically determined the period involved. However, where historians had previously based their arguments on single stars or constellations on the tablets Schaefer's statistical analysis included of all the different data recorded on the tablets. By statistically analysing all of the star list data in the Mul.Apin series the American astronomer Brad Schaefer has concluded (2007) that the epoch for the data comprising Mul.Apin star lists is 1370 ± 100 BCE with a latitude of 35° ± 1.2°. The actual observations to establish the data through averaging were obviously a little earlier. Schaefer also determined that the ancient observers lived within roughly 100 kilometres of 35.1° North - an area that includes the ancient Assyrian cities of Niniveh and Assur. The assyriologist Hermann Hunger has stated Schaefer's work will help settle a long-standing debate. The rough date of circa 1000 BCE for the tablets, that most historians have settled on, agrees rather well with Schaefer's analysis.
Appendix 1: Werner Papke and Early Dating of Mul.Apin:
According to Werner Papke (who holds a PhD in Assyriology) the Mul.Apin data (and the 12 constellation zodiac) date to circa 2340 BCE. Papke also relates these claims to the dating and meaning of the Gilgamesh epic. Papke, however, has been criticised for interpreting the Mul.Apin texts in such a way to show that Mul.Apin contains a record of observations from 2340 BCE. Hunger/Pingree (1989 and 1999) offer criticisms of Papke. Included are that Papke's dating depends on "stars rather arbitrarily selected to fit his theory." Papke has ignored the works of Hunger/Pingree and also Neugebauer and Sachs; and the criticisms of Hunger/Pingree. The analysis by the astronomer Brad Schaefer to determine the most likely dating of Mul.Apin has superseded Papke's dating claims for the 3rd-millennium BCE. Schaefer's work has established the 2nd-millennium BCE for the date of Mul.Apin data. In 2003 the assyriologist Andrew George

published a new (2-volume) scholarly edition of Gilgamesh. Also, from 2003-2005 the assyriologist Stefan Maul published translations of 5 new fragments of the Gilgamesh epic. The assyriologist Alasdair Livingstone has pointed out the problems with the claim by Papke for a high standard of astronomical knowledge being achieved shortly after the invention of writing are that it must be envisaged: (1) this astronomical knowledge did not subsequently develop and was ultimately forgotten, and (2) this astronomical knowledge had no appreciable effect on the rest of Babylonian "science." Also, the fatal dating problem for Papke connecting the supposed astronomical content of the Gilgamesh epic with Mul.Apin is that the text of the Sumerian originals for the Gilgamesh epic which were later reworked in the Babylonian Gilgamesh version predate the composition of Mul.Apin by circa 1000 years.

40: Guillaume Postel, Ludwig Ideler, and Philipp Buttmann
Guillaume Postel.
The French scholar Guillaume Postel (1510-1581) is described as a brilliant eccentric (perhaps more accurately lunatic) polymath and one of the most learned men of his day. He is considered to be the first true Orientalist. The science historian Deborah Warner commented on his "prodigious erudition and output." Postel is considered by historians to be one of the most unusual figures of the sixteenth century but is also frequently viewed by historians as a marginal figure. (Because of his particular religious fantasies he is also viewed by some historians as insane.) He was a linguist (considered a master of oriental languages), astronomer, diplomat, professor, theologian, traveller, Kabbalist, mapmaker, author, translator, publisher, and collector. Postel was also a prophet and mystic.
He was born to poor parents who both died of the plague leaving him an orphan when he was 8 years old. It appears that even when quite young he was obsessed with acquiring knowledge (and was a child prodigy). An early influence/inspiration was the cabalistic version of Christianity by Pico della Mirandola. To some extent he was self educated (especially with languages) but he acquired Master of Arts and Bachelor of Medicine degrees at the Collège Sainte-Barbe. (He first supported himself by working as a servant in a school in Beaucè (located south of Paris). Later, on numerous occasions he supported himself by giving public lectures.)
In 1535-1537 Postel accompanied the French ambassador to Constantinople and whilst there studied Arabic and Turkish and also collected - as he had been commissioned to do - Oriental manuscripts for the French king François I.

In 1539 he was appointed a Royal Professor (specifically Professor of Mathematics and Oriental Languages) at the Institut Royal in Paris (later becoming the Collège de France). This position was the first chair of Arabic in Paris. Postel's pupils included Franciscus Raphelengius (Frans van Ravelingen) (1539-1597) (Flemish born Dutch scholar) who was later to become an Orientalist and eminent Arabist (a Jewish convert to Christianity who was a proof-reader at the Plntin printing-house and later became Professor of Hebrew in Leiden) and Joseph Scalinger (1540-1609) who was later to become the greatest classical scholar of his time.
Between circa 1543 and 1545 Postel convinced himself that he had been commissioned by God to call 'infidels' to the Catholic faith and to assemble them under the banner of the French king François I. In 1544 Postel apparently joined the Jesuit order as a novice, was ordained as an apostolic priest, and, because of his particular religious views, dismissed from the order after 18 months. He was never admitted as a full member of the Jesuit order. Circa late 1546 he travelled to Venice to the hospital of Saints John and Paul (San Giovanni e Paolo) which became the focus of his spiritual life until his death. While working on his translations of the Zohar and the Bahir in Venice in 1547, Postel became the confessor of "Mother" Zuana (Johanna), an elderly woman who was responsible for the kitchen of the hospital. Zuana (Johanna) confessed to experiencing divine visions, which inspired Postel to believe that she was a prophet, that he was her spiritual son, and that he was destined to be the uniter of the world's religions. From 1549 he still continued to travel extensively. After Mother Johanna's death (in 1552?) Postel believed that her spiritual body had returned from heaven and taken complete possession of his body (i.e., the personality of Postel was now the personality of Mother Johanna).
Postel is considered the first true Orientalist and also the first European scholar to conduct research into the history and linguistic origins of star names. The book Signorum coelesttium vera configuratio aut asterismus containing the results of his researches into star names was published in 1553. Nick Kanas (Star Maps, 2007, Page 347) notes that the book included 4 woodcut celestial maps. On page 348 he describes them as: "Two were hemispheres centered around an ecliptic pole that were each 23 cm in diameter and used a polar stereographic projection and geocentric orientation, without figures. The other two were the northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres of Honter." (Johannes Honter [Honterus] (1498-1549) was a German humanist, cosmographer, and cartographer.) The historian of Arabic science George Saliba notes it mentions only 36 constellations.
Postel also wrote the heterodox work Cosmographicae disciplinae compendium (1561). Among his strange ideas is the identification of the north celestial pole as the literal seat of evil. According to Postel the north polar constellations of the dragon and the 2 bears are signs (not merely symbols) that the devil is imprisoned (chained) there by God at the north celestial pole.
Postel (and also other European scholars of like calibre) was not dependent on Latin translations of Arabic scientific works. Postel could easily read the original Arabic texts and understand their content (and at times identify corrections to the texts). George Saliba is of the opinion that Postel's interest in Arabic astronomy was likely life-long. Saliba identifies that Postel played a highly important role in the transmission of Islamic scientific ideas into Latin Europe. (Likewise the distinguished orientalist Jean-Albert Widmanstadt (1506circa1559).)
Postel was an original thinker who held many unconventional views (from those of his contemporaries). He espoused a mystical theology that was derided by his contemporaries. Postel believed that a female messiah (Mother Johanna at the Venice hospital of Saints John and Paul) had arrived on earth who would usher in a new age of political and religious harmony. He grounded this prophecy in the Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition, and relied extensively on its use of gender symbolism. (He also believed the second coming of Jesus would be as a female person.) His writings (as well as his great interest in the Hebrew and Arabic languages) provoked his 1555 trial for heresy before the Venetian Holy Office. (Later he served time in the Papal jail in Rome.)
The supposed miracle of Laon in 1566 and the 'new star' (supernova) of 1572 (which he had predicted) were some of the events interpreted by Postel as heralding the beginning of the new age of world unity. Circa this period Postel declared himself as Magus. (He believed that in order to achieve world peace and a utopian manner of life it was necessary for everyone to return to speaking Hebrew, which he believed was the primordial language (the Ursprache).)

Due to the religious content of his public lectures in cosmography - that he was allowed to give 1563 in Paris - he was from that year confined to the Monastery of Sainte Martin-de-Champs until his death.
See: "Arabie Science in Sixteenth-Century Europe: Guillaume Postel (1510-1581) and Arabie Astronomy." by George Saliba (Suhayl, Volume 7, 2007, Pages 115-164); and Dangerous Knowledge: Orientalism and its Discontents (2006, Pages 66-71) by Robert Irwin. Also: Bibliographie des manuscrits de Guillaume Postel by François Secret (1970). Most of his works have survived.
Ludwig Ideler.
In his popular book on star names Richard Allen mentions 2 early investigators of Western constellations and star names, and relies on one of them quite heavily. These early investigators are Ludwig Ideler and Philipp Buttmann. Allen placed heavy reliance on Ideler.
Luwig Ideler is the father of the modern study of chronology. The most complete manual on chronology is Handbuch de Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie (2 Volumes, 1825-1826) by Ludwig Ideler. It was an epoch making book. Lehrbuch der Chronologie (1831) is an abridgment. Ueber die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen (1839) was an extension of his great work. He also made an important contribution to the historical explanation of star names based on Arabic sources.
Christian Ludwig [sometimes Ludewig] Ideler (1766 (near Perleberg)-1846) was a German astronomer, chronologist and philologist. Ideler studied theology, philology, astronomy, and mathematics at the Universitat Halle/Saale. "In 1794 he was appointed at Berlin an astronomer for reckoning time, becoming a member of the "royal calendar deputation."" (See: Handbuch der Orientalistik: The Near and Middle East. H-M, Part 1 by Wolfgang Benn (2006, Page 142).) After holding various official posts under the Prussian government he became a Professor at the University of Berlin (Academie in Berlin) in 1821. (Professor de Astronomie und Mitglied (Professor of Astronomy and Chronology).) From 1816 to 1822 he was tutor to the young Prussian princes William and Charles. His life was largely devoted to the study of ancient systems of chronology.
His publications include the book: Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen [Inquiry into the Origin and Meaning of the Names of Stars] (1809, reprinted 1994). It was a major work and one of the earliest extensive studies of the history, derivations and meaning of star names that had passed into European astronomy. Much of the discussion involves star names derived from Arabic. The book

incorporated his own translation of the astronomical section of Zakariya' al-Qazwini's popular 13th-century cosmography, 'Aja'ib al-Makhluqat (The Wonders of Creation), supplemented with notes from classical and other sources. Ideler was an Arabic scholar as well as being a Greek scholar. Unfortunately, Ideler did not have access to al-Sufi's book on the fixed stars, and his work is riddled with errors due to his use of unreliable and chiefly secondary Arabic sources. The book is now thoroughly dated and unreliable.
Ideler was a member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften from 1810. Circa 1839 he became a foreign member of the Institute of France. In 1825-1826 he published his great work, Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie (2 Volumes), which still remains useful and highly regarded. Many still consider it the best specialist work on the theory and history of chronology and still unsurpassed as a manual of historical chronology. (This original edition is now extremely scarce. However, there have been several (revised) reprints. The 2nd edition was published in 1883.) A supplementary volume, Die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen, appeared in 1839. His Lehrbuch der Chronologie, published in 1831, is a smaller handbook upon the same subject. His researches into the construction of the calendars used by all the different nations of antiquity still remain a mine of useful information. Most of his life was spent studying ancient systems of calendars.
His son Julius Ideler (1809(1800?)-1842) was born in Berlin and was educated in the medical department of the University of Berlin. Julius Ideler was an historian of ancient (classical) meteorology. His major work, Meteorologia Veterum Græcorum et Romanorum was published in 1832.
Philipp Buttmann.
Philipp Carl Buttmann (1764-1829) was a famous German classical philologist and mythologer. He was very highly regarded and considered an excellent etymologer. (Ludwig Ideler in his Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen made use of Philipp Buttmann's knowledge of Greek etymology. Franz Boll in his book Sphaera (1903) made use of Buttman's essay Über die Entstehung der Sternbilder auf der griechischen Stäre.)
Buttmann was descended from the French Protestants who took refuge in Germany from the persecution of Louis XIV; and the name Buttmann is a German representative of the French Boudemont. His father, Jacob Buttman (spelled with a single n) was a 'respectable stationer.'
He was educated in his native town of Frankfurt am Main (Frankfort-on-the-Main) and at the University of Göttingen. In Frankfurt am Main he attended the gymnasium (College), the rector of which was Purman. It was here that he acquired his interest in philology and the Greek language. In 1782 he went to the University of Göttingen to pursue classical studies under the superintendance of Christian-Gottlob Heyne. Heyne (17291812) was a German classical scholar, archaeologist, and long-time director of the Göttingen State and

University Library. Circa 1787 he was appointed geographical teacher to the young Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, and remained in this position for about 8 months. In 1788 he went to Berlin.
In 1789 he was appointed Director of the Royal Prussian Library in Berlin. For several years he was the editor of Spener's Journal (a prominent multi-topic journal). In order to supplement his low salary he turned to teaching and writing for the booksellers. (In 1796 Buttmann was appointed Secretary to the Royal Library.) Beginning in 1796 [1800?] he was Professor of Philology at the Joachimsthal [Joachimthalsche] Gymnasium in Berlin, for 12 [8?] years. He was then appointed one of the original professors of the new university in Berlin. In 1806 he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences (elected a member). In 1811 he was made Secretary of the Historico-Philological section of the (Berlin) Academy of Sciences.
In 1821 he was appointed head librarian to the king. In 1824 he was made a Knight of the Prussian Red Eagle of the 3rd class.
He wrote 3 excellent grammars on the Greek language which were universally used in Germany. His several books and other writings were a major impetus for the scientific study of the Greek language. His concern with the inadequacy of Greek grammars then in use prompted him to write his own. His book Griechische Grammatik (a short Greek grammar first published 1792) immediately became widely used in schools in Germany. It went through multiple editions (and remained in use in German school for over half a century), and was translated into English. His book Lexilogus (first published in 1818-1825) was also translated into English. It was written as a help for understanding difficult Greek words occurring mainly in the works of Homer and Hesiod. His book Mythologus, oder gesammelte Abhandlungen uber die Sagen des Alterthums (2 Volumes) was first published 1828-29. It is a collection of his mythological and historical essays.
Circa 1800 he was the pre-eminent authority on classical star names. His publications include the lengthy paper: Über die Entstehung der Sternbilder auf der griechischen Stäre. (Presented in 1826 and published 1829 in Abhandlungen der historisch-philologischn Klasse der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, Pages 19-63. Reprinted 1929.) The paper is now thoroughly dated.
In 1800 Buttmann married the eldest daughter of Doctor Selle, the king's physician. His son Augustus established himself as an excellent scholar. From 1824 until his death Buttmann was afflicted with repeated attacks of apoplexy. As a person Buttmann abhorred complicated responsibilities and also had an aversion to formalities.
For a detailed biography see: Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volume 6, pages 68-69, published 1836 by Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain). Buttmann wrote his own biography, up to the time of his becoming a member of the Berlin academy, in the 3rd part of Löwes collection (Bildnisse jetzlebender Berliner Gelehrter mit Selbstbiographien).

41: Title page of Georg Thiele's Antike Himmelsbilder
Title page of Thiele's important study of constellation art.
George Thiele (1866-1917) was a highly regarded German Professor of Classical Philology. (In 1910 his academic details were: Prof. Dr. Georg Thiele, Privatdozent der klassische Philologie an der Universität Marburg.) Thiele was a pupil of Ernst Maass ((1856-1929), German classical philologist, Philipps

Universität Marburg (Privatdocenten. a. d. Universitiit Marburg)). In later life Thiele was a Professor at the universities of Marburg and Greifswald. (In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, the chair in classical philology at the University of Greifswald was given to Georg Thiele.)
Philology is the study of language in written historical sources; as such it is a combination of literary studies, history and linguistics. Classical philology is the study of the so-called "classical" Indo-European language systems, including ancient Greek, classical Latin, and Sanskrit.
Thiele's book Antike Himmelsbilder (1898) has been described as a work of amazing erudition and also a pioneering and masterful study. (This important study was inspired by Ernst Maass.) It is still regarded by some persons as the definitive study of classical star maps. Antike Himmelsbilder still has value. It is certainly the classic study of the representation of the constellation figures in Greco-Roman antiquity. The 4 chapters comprising the book have been criticised as uneven. Regardless, they became the basis for all further studies on the astronomical and meteorological poem of Aratus. The early chapters deal with the origin of the constellations. The 4th (and last) chapter is entirely devoted to the zodiacal iconography of early Aratos MSS. Thiele's book was considered reactionary scholarship because Thiele contested the view that the zodiac originated in Babylonia. Thiele held (mistakenly) that the development of the Zodiac was the work of the Asiatic Greeks. (Erich Bethe, in his article "Das Alter der griechischen Sternbilder" (1900), proposed that the constellation of Engonasin 'The Kneeler' originated amongst the Ionian Greeks circa 6thcentury BCE as an anonymous man.) The arguments of Fritz Hommel, at this time, for a Babylonian origin of the zodiacal constellations were considered absolutely convincing by most scholars. The focus of the book is the constellations depicted on the Farnese Globe. (Also, Thiele was mainly interested in the "Bilderklasse" (category of images. Thiele was one of a number of scholars, Ernst Maass and Erich Bethe amongst them, who dealt with those illustrated codices that they considered to be copies of lost archetypes of the classical period.) The book Antike Himmelsbilder contains an excellent series of photographs of the Farnese Globe.
A great deal of discussion is given to the Germanicus MS in Leiden, the illustrated Codex Vossianus (saec. IX), which is one of the important monuments of Carolingian Period pictorial art (and an important specimen of the antique method of illustrating books). The highly problematical, illuminated Carolingian MS. of the classical astronomical work called the Aratea or the Syntagma Arateorum, once owned by Isaac Vossius, has long been a prized possession of Leiden's University Library. The Codex Vossianus is illustrated with framed paintings of the constellation figures. These illustrations are a source of lost (Aratea) archetypes of the Classical Period. (There are very few surviving sets of illustrations of the mythological figures associated with the constellations. It needs to be kept in mind the constellation figures of the Aratea are not true star maps.) As a consequence, as well as detailed description of Codex Vossianus (saec. IX), Antike Himmelsbilder is profusely illustrated with constellation figures from Codex Vossianus (saec. IX). (They were fully reproduced by Thiele.) It is believed the Codex Vossianus is a fairly accurate copy of a 4th-century original. According to Thiele the illustrations in Codex Vossianus are copied after illustrations of the poem of Aratus from a 4th-century CE manuscript. Other scholars have contested this date.
The earliest illustrated Latin Aratus manuscripts extant today date to the Carolingian period. (The 2 classical revivals of the Christian era are the Carolingian renovatio and the Italian Renaissance.)
The Leiden Aratea, a small squarish parchment manuscript comprising 99 leaves, is a 9th-century CE copy of an astronomical and meteorological manuscript based on the Phaenomena written by the Greek poet Aratus (circa 315-240/39 BCE). The Leiden Aratea is a faithful copy of an earlier manuscript that was probably made in the 4th- or 5th-century CE and offers unique evidence of the form and content of illustrated books in the ancient world. The existing manuscript was created by an unknown artist during the reign of Louis the Pious (814-840) in the second quarter of the 9th century. (The evidence suggests it was probably produced in the royal scriptorium, possibly in 816 CE.) The ultimate source that formed the basis of the Leiden Aratea was the Latin version of Aratus' Phaenomena by Germanicus Caesar (15 BCE - 19 CE). The manuscript contains 39 full-page miniatures. Of all the manuscripts on astronomy from the Carolingian Renaissance, the Aratea of Leiden is undoubtedly the most famous.
For a brief synthesis of what is known about all the illustrated versions of the Aratea see pages 1-16 of Antike Himmelbilder.

Isaak Vossius, sometimes anglicised Isaac Voss (Leiden, 1618–London, 1689) was a Dutch scholar and manuscript collector. He was the son of the humanist Gerhard Vossius. (He was the seventh child of Gerard Vossius (1577–1649), the famous Dutch scholar, by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Francis du Jon (Junius).) Isaak formed what was believed to be the best private library in the world. It included 762 manuscripts which his enemies described as 'spoils.' Most of his books were included in the 'Index librorum prohibitorum.' From late 1649 Isaac Vossius and Nicolaas Heinsius were occupied as librarians and searched for rare manuscripts and books in foreign countries. In 1650 Vossius bought the famous library of Paul Petau (1568-1614) an avid collector of manuscripts, who lived in Paris. After his death, his heirs sold his library of books and manuscripts to the University of Leiden for thirty-six thousand florins.
Whether the Phaenomena of Aratus was actually illustrated with pictures of the constellation figures is uncertain. It is considered there is greater likelihood that there were already pictures in the Katastarismoi of Eratosthenes of Cyrene (circa 275-195 BCE) which were then later taken over into the commentaries and translations of Latin writers such as Germanicus, Cicero, Hyginus, and others. The American art historian Kurt Weitzmann held the view that the so-called Aratea (after Aratus) were in all likelihood illustrated with mythological figures for the constellations for the first time by Eratosthenes of Cyrene in the late 3rd-century BCE. There are very few sets of of early illustrations of the mythological figures associated with the Aratean constellation set. The presently known illustrations (sets) include: the Farnese globe (Roman), the Kugel globe (Roman), the Mainz globe (Roman), the Qusayr 'Amra lodge and bath house (Arab-Islamic), and Codex Vossianus (saec. IX) (Carolingian). The constellation figures are shown from the rear. (This was also the case for most Carolingian illustrated copies of the Aratea.)
It was Thiele (1898) who first identified the 12th-century CE manuscript Madrid 19 (Manuscript Madrid Biblioteca Nacional 19) as the direct source for Michael Scotus' Liber de signis.
The medieval historian George Keidel expressed the opinion that until Thiele's death in 1917 Thiele was the leader in discussions concerning the art of portraying fable situations in the Middle Ages in manuscripts, in the Bayeux tapestry, and on buildings.
In Antike Himmelsbilder Thiele discussed his research on the descriptions of the constellations by Hipparchus and the illustrations in Aratean manuscripts, and their relationship. Also presented is an art historical analysis of the constellation depictions on the Farnese globe, and the descriptions given in Aratus' poem Phainomena. Georg Thiele determined an estimate of the date for the Farnese globe based on artistic styles related to the epoch of the Roman Emperor Hadrian prior to 150 BCE. (Hadrian ruled the Roman Empire from 117 CE to 138 CE.)
Thiele set out a detailed demonstration that the constellation positions on the Farnese globe are consistent with the time of Hipparchus. Thiele held that because the constellations on the globe are rather detailed and scientifically accurate (given the date of the creation of the Farnese Globe circa 2nd-century BCE) that this implied the globe was modelled after a scholarly work on the constellations. Thiele then set out a detailed argument that the constellations depicted on the globe followed the astronomy of Hipparchus (and are based on his fixed-star register). Georg Thiele concluded that the descriptions of the constellations given by Aratus (in his poem Phainomena) were not based on an earlier version of the Farnese globe. He showed a connection between the two is not possible simply because of large differences in star positions and also was evidently not aware of the colures that appear on the Farnese globe.
However, the Farnese Globe is the archetypal model for the constellation illustrations. Georg Thiele, Antike Himmelsbilder (1898), demonstrated a direct link the constellations depicted on the Farnese Globe and those found in the earliest surviving Aratean manuscripts. As example: The 9th-century Germanicus translation in the Leiden manuscript, and the 2 early 9th-century Aratus latinus manuscripts.
Recently Bradley Schafer believed he had demonstrated the basis for the relationship of the Farnese globe with the star catalogue of Hipparchus. In 2005, at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, Bradley Schaefer, a professor of physics at Louisiana State University, presented his analysis concluding that the text of Hipparchus' long lost star catalog may have been the inspiration for the representation of the constellations on the Farnese globe, thereby reviving and expanding the earlier (original) proposal by Georg Thiele (Antike Himmelsbilder,1898). The same had been proposed in 1987 by Vladimiro Valerio in his forgotten article "Histographic and numerical notes on the Atlante Farnese and its celestial sphere." in Der Globusfreund,

Number 35/37, 1987/1989, Pages 97-127. Schafer's study was fully independent - he had no awareness of the earlier study. The analysis of these scholars was based on stylistic considerations and star-positional evidence. Schaefer's conclusions have been vigorously criticised/contested by the astronomer Dennis Duke (Journal for the History of Astronomy, February, 2006), most particularly on the ground that regardless of the date for the globe the constellation figures on it show large disagreement with the only existing work by Hipparchus. But, importantly, see Bradley Schaefer's detailed posting to Hastro-L Monday, 24 July 2017 in which he rebuts Dennis Duke's criticisms.

Franz Boll was a renowned German classical philologist who specialized in ancient astronomy and astrology. He was also very much interested in the history of mathematics, and had a deep interest in Plato. Boll devoted much of his early work to studying Ptolemy. He is still highly regarded for his editorial and biographical work on Claudius Ptolemy. Later, Franz Boll devoted his scholarly research activities almost exclusively to the history of ancient Western astrology. Boll was born in 1867 in Rothenburg on the Tauber river and he died unexpectedly in Heidelberg in 1924. (See the obituary by Albert Rehm, Biographisches Jahrbuch für Altertumskunde 47 (1927) 13- 43.) His doctoral dissertation was on Ptolemy. He had the ability to combine astronomy, religion, and literature with great originality. His sudden early death in 1924 at the age of 57 put an end to his further masterly contributions to elucidating little-known traditions. His last academic position was Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Heidelberg. In 1908 he succeeded Albrecht [Albert] Dieterich (1866-1908) as Professor at the University of Heidelberg. (Studying ancient forms of magic and magic papyri was so suspect (circa 19th-century and early 20th-century) in the eyes of German traditionalistic philology that Albert Dieterich felt obliged to conceal the object of his Summer seminar in 1905 on magic papyri under under the tame (non provocative) title of "Selection of Greek Papyri." Such texts and interest in them were deemed to rob antiquity of the distinguished luster of classicism.)
Franz Boll was one of a number of early 20th-century philologists who contributed fundamental new insights into the theory, history, and European development of the Greek and Roman languages, literatures, and cultures. Gustav Müller who lived for a time at Franz Boll's house described him as a kind and jovial Bavarian, great teacher and impeccable scholar. Müller describes student life in Heidelberg as being under the shadow of poverty, gloom, and desperation. Students had few clothes and stood in long soup lines.
Franz Boll's Studien über Claudius Ptolemäus: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie und Astrologie (1894) is still considered to be the most comprehensive study to date of Ptolemy's philosophical commitments. It examines the philosophy in several of Ptolemy's texts, including the Almagest, On the Kritêrion, Harmonics, and, especially, the Tetrabiblos. Boll takes a philological approach and traces the philosophical concepts of Ptolemy's texts to their predecessors and emphasizes the influence of Aristotle and Posidonius in particular. The inherent fault's in Boll's study are rectified in the 2009 doctoral dissertation by Jacqueline Feke, Ptolemy in Philosophical Context: A Study of the Relationships Between Physics, Mathematics, and Theology.
There had been some controversy in the early 19th-century whether Ptolemy authored the astrological work Tetrabiblos (comprised of 4 books). Franz Boll sufficiently demonstrated that the book in its general philosophic views, its language, and its astronomy, is entirely in accord with the works of Ptolemy (especially through textual comparison with Ptolemy's Almagest) whose genuineness has been unquestioned. Franz Boll had begun work upon a new edition of the Tetrabiblos prior to his death in 1924. His pupil, Emilie Boer, continued Boll's work but their completed text did not meet with critical approval. In some 75 instances Boll altered the text by outright emendation. Also, some 40 key mistakes are contained in the 2nd edition.
Towards the end of the 19th-century the Belgian scholar Franz Cumont organized and led a group of European scholars to collect, catalogue and edit all of the existing manuscripts on astrology that were written in ancient Greek during the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. During the first half of the 20thcentury Franz Cumont and Franz Boll, and others (including Wilhelm Kroll), systematically collected and edited a huge quantity of texts and fragments of ancient Greek astrological material. The project took over 50 years to complete. It involved scouring the world’s libraries and private collections for ancient texts and manuscripts that had been copied and preserved since their original composition. Initially the project culminated in the publication of a massive 12 volume compendium, Corpus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum (= Catalogue of the Codices of the Greek Astrologers) (1898-1953). It is most commonly known simply by its acronym as the CCAG. It is a catalogue of Greek astrological manuscripts that contains in its large appendices critical editions of many previously unknown texts. Although this massive compendium of astrological material has been available in print since the beginning of the 20th-century has has been somewhat neglected and unused due to the challenges involved in studying the material in the original Greek language.
Alexander Jones has commented: "Scholars like Hermann Usener (1834–1905), Auguste Bouché-Leclercq (1842–1923), Franz Boll (1867–1924), and Franz Cumont (1868–1947) laid the foundations of all

subsequent research into the history of ancient astrology."
On astrology Boll is quoted as saying "Astrology wants to be religion and science at the same time; that marks its essence."
It was Franz Boll who discovered and reconstructed the history of the passage of the Sphaera Barbarica. The first major modern work devoted to elucidating the Sphaera Barbarica was the classic book-length study Sphaera by the German philologist Franz Boll (1903). (The word "Sphaera" refers to the celestial sphere, the map of the night sky. The title is plural because 2 sky maps existed in Graeco-Roman antiquity - the Greek and the Barbarian.)
Boll's most important and most outstanding work is perhaps Sphaera (1903). It is still an important work on ancient and Arabic astrology. The masterly work Sphaera was Franz Boll's ingenious recovery of the Sphaera Barbarica, based on the discovery of new manuscripts. Boll became aware of the Sphaera Barbarica through the discovery of excerpta (brief segments of writing taken from longer works) from the Byzantine period. Boll became aware of the Sphaera Barbarica through the discovery of excerpta (brief segments of writing taken from longer works) from the Byzantine period. In Sphaera Boll published and annotated the texts of then newly discovered Classical and Byzantine astronomical/astrological manuscripts by Teukros the Babylonian, Antiochus of Athens, Vettius Valens, and Johannes Kamateros, a 12th-century Byzantium astrologer.
He ingeniously reconstructed the Sphaera Barbarica and also traced the major stages of its journey from Ptolemaic Egypt and Babylon to the Islamic Persian Empire (in Persian manuscripts translated into Arabic) and back to Latin Europe (retranslated into Latin). Boll recognised the contributions of Teukros the Babylonian to constellation lore ahead of his contemporaries. The first part of the book is a critical discussion of the newly discovered texts, the second part describes the constellations in them, and the third part deals with the history of the "Sphaera Barbarica" as described by Nigidius Figulus and others. In Sphaera Boll first described the genre of paranatellonta writing and edited much of the material.
The belief of the Renaissance chronologist Joseph Scalinger that Book 5 of Marcus Manilius' work Astronomica was derived from the Sphaera Barbarica was shown by Boll in his Sphaera to be a (typically) confused description of the Greek sphere mixed/mingled with 'barbaric' doctrine. (Scalinger's 1st edition of Manilius was published in 1579.) However, the French scholar Joseph Scalinger (1540-1609, born in Agen, southern France, into the family of an Italian scholar and physician), in his 2nd edition (commentary) of Manilius (1600) (effectively a treatise on ancient astronomy), began the investigation of the Sphaera Barbarica on the basis of a version preserved in the writings of Rabbi Araham Ibn Ezra (1092-1167) - who had derived it from the writings of Abū Ma'shar.) It has been remarked that Scalinger over-simplified the problem of the Sphaera Barbarica. He believed it to comprise merely of the paranatellonta and 'clarae stellae' (of the zodiac) of the Greek sphere as seen in Egypt. He overlooked his own quotation from Nigidius Figulus that stated it included non-Greek constellations. In antiquity the name Sphaera Barbarica was inexactly used (i.e., far removed from its proper and original sense) for a scheme of non-Greek and Greek constellations i.e., the Latin astrologer Firmicus Maternus and the Greek physician Asclepiades of Bithynia. Marcus Manilius also does not strictly set out the Sphaera Barbarica.
Later, it was Aby Warburg who first recognised the resurgence of the Sphaera Barbarica in the imagery of the Renaissance period.
David Pingree stated: "Franz Boll was the first to recognize the importance of the study of the iconography of the Decans for a broader investigation of the transmission of ideas in antiquity and during the Middle Ages." Boll showed that prior to the 6th-century CE knowledge of the Egyptian decans had reached India.
In his book Sphaera [Spheres: New Greek Texts and an Examination of the History of the Constellations] Boll analysed ancient Greek traditions regarding Hades, the River Styx, and the Ferryman of the Underworld. Boll cited texts locating Hades in the sky at the southern crossroads of the Milky Way and the ecliptic, between the constellations Scorpius and Sagittaurius. Boll also pointed out the close relationship between Greek and earlier Babylonian traditions regarding Hades, and the Babylonian celestial location of Hades.

Many of Boll's papers are now difficult to access. A collection of his most important papers are gathered in the Kleine Schriften edited by Viktor Stegemann and published in 1950.
The joint work of Franz Boll and Carl Bezold on the history of Western astrology, Sternglaube und Sterndeutung (first published 1917, then revised by Carl Bezold, then again by Wilhelm Gundel (4th edition by Wilhelm Gundel (1931)), is still the best introductory history. A 5th edition appeared in 1966. It was in this book that Boll asserted his belief that the Chinese "years of animals" (the 12-year lunar calendar cycle used for dating the years) came from Egyptian dodekaoros. It was Franz Boll who suggested to Aby Warburg (a close friend who he first met in 1911) the origin of Ferrara Astrological Cycle frescos. Boll had completed an analysis of the frescoes in the Schifanoia Palace in Ferrara, Northern Italy. In his historical study of astrology Aby Warburg was influence by Franz Boll. Following Boll's death Warburg was keen to keep the Boll library together. Part of Boll's private library/book collection is in the Warburg library. Influenced by the work of Franz Boll, Aby Warburg read widely in the history of mythology, astronomy, and astrology and wondered about issues of cultural change, in particular, the continuity of star imagery from antiquity to modern times.
The collaboration between Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl was a good one. Warburg had the contacts and Saxl had the "good nose" for manuscript discoveries. Fritz Saxl's multi-volume Verzeichnis astrologischer und mythologischer illustrierter Handschriften des lateinischen Mittelalters / Catalogue of Astrological and Mythological Illuminated Manuscripts of the Latin Middle Ages was made possible through the support of Boll. Fritz Saxl was a Viennese art historian. Through Boll's advice he was able to obtain funding to travel to Italy and work in the Vatican Library on medieval Latin manuscripts on astrology. Circa 1912, after Fritz Saxl has graduated from the University of Vienna in mid 1912 Aby Warburg contacted Franz Boll in Heidelberg, and Boll arranged a travelling scholarship for Saxl from the Academy of Sciences in Heidelberg to travel to Italy and work in the Vatican Library on medieval Latin astrological texts and mythological manuscripts. Saxl prepared a catalogue of medieval illuminated astrological manuscripts in Rome, which he published in 1915.

Title page of Boll's flawed astral interpretation of The Book of Revelation.
Franz Boll's controversial 1914 publication involving an astral interpretation of the New Testament Apocalypse. He was one of the early astral interpreters of the New Testament Apocalypse. Another early astral interpreter - but less credible - was Nikolai Morozov. (The Book of Revelation is the final book of the New Testament corpus. The continuing lack of consensus on any specific issue in the book of Revelation easily demonstrates that its contents are difficult to understand. Much of the book's symbolism is allusive, and therefore open to several possible identifications within a variety of biblical and non-biblical traditions.) The French author Charles Dupuis first published a similar thesis in his Origine de tous les cultes (1795). In 1914 Franz Boll developed the "astral mythology" interpretation of the Apocalypse at some length in his book Aus der Offenbarung Johannis. For Boll the Book of Revelation was solidly influenced by astralmythology. Boll believed the origin of the symbolism of almost the entire book was astral mythology that had originated in Babylon and by the 1st-century CE had spread over the Graeco-Roman world. (Boll's interpretation ignored the fact that Old Testament imagery is prevalent in the book.) Boll focused on astral notions current in the Hellenistic period at the time the Apocalypse was written. The short book only deals with a select number of passages in the Apocalypse. However, Boll was neither a biblical scholar nor a theologian. Not surprisingly he chose to use those passages that best suited his astral theory. No detailed study of the Apocalypse is attempted. Selected passages are focused on but not discussed exhaustively. Selected passages that are examined in detail are: (1) the vision of the bowls and trumpets, (2) the first woe,

(3) the apocalyptic horseman, and (4) the queen of heaven. Boll basically viewed the Apocalypse as containing astral ideas developed in the Graeco-Roman world but ultimately originating in Babylonian astral ideas. Boll emphasised the importance of the zodiacal signs for the interpretation of the book. For a while the ideas of Boll were influential in later commentaries. However, within a few years his book was largely ignored. Critics held that many of Boll's argument were too artificial/forced and actually find no real support in the texts used.
Boll was primarily interested in the sources which inspired the imagery. Also, he restricted his focus to the Hellenistic era. For Boll the imagery is mostly drawn form the astral notions current in the Hellenistic environment. The star Wormwood (a term for a bitter substance from a plant) in Jeremiah 9:15 was associated with the constellation Scorpio, known for its poisonous tail. The 4 apocalyptic horsemen were based on the stars in the lion, the virgin, the scales, and the scorpion.
Interpretation in terms of astral myth was particularly popular in the early 20th-century. It is not readily accepted by modern commentators that the book is basically built around astral mythology and is making astral prophecies. The well-informed German Old Testament scholar Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932) believed there was a strong influence of Babylonian mythology in Chapter 12. The focus of many modern historical investigations have been (1) the most likely original purpose of the text, and (2) the most likely audience of the text.
For a critical book-length rebuttal of Boll's ideas in this book see Die Apokalypse des Apostels Johannes und die hellenistische Kosmologie und Astrologie, by (the Catholic theologian/(later) bishop) Joseph Freundorfer (1929). In his review of Boll's Aus der Offenbarung Johannis, William Lowther-Clarke states (The Classical Review, Volume 30, 1916, Page 22): "At times the arguments are weak, and the method of treating a few only of the passages of the Apocalypse - those that fit the theory best - renders caution necessary in the reader ...." In recent times Bruce Malina, a Professor of Biblical Studies, has revived the ideas of Boll for interpreting the New Testament Apocalypse. See especially his book On the Genre and Message of Revelation published in 1995. Malina identifies Revelation as an astral prophesy.) In some ways Malina’s book is a revival and extension of Boll’s study. However, Malina also uncritically relies on the flawed publications of the amateur English Orientalist Robert Brown Junior for many of his concepts of the ancient constellations. For a succinct critique of Malina's astral ideas see also: Revelation by Ben Witherington III (2003).
For many scholars Malina's approach involves reading a great deal more astrological myth into the Book of Revelation than is clearly there. In his 2006 Master's Dissertation (for his MA (Biblical Studies), Apokaliptiek en Openbaring: 'n Kritiese evaluering van Malina en Pilch se "Social-Science commentary on the Book of Revelation," Cornelius Swart gives its summary (Abstract) as: "The aim of this study is to evaluate Malina & Pilch's Social-Science Commentary on the Book of Revelation. As stated on the cover of the book, this commentary claims to be unique: "The first social-science commentary on this extraordinary book." The question is whether the social-scientific method enhances the understanding of Revelation for modern interpreters? The method's relationship with traditional exegetical methods is also examined. In order to evaluate any work on Revelation, it is necessary to make a thorough study of the apocalyptic. Revelation is an apocalypse and is traditionally understood as part of the apocalyptic genre. It is also necessary to make use of findings of the historical-critical method in order to understand questions regarding the author, date and place of composition of Revelation. The social-scientific method's presuppositions and procedures are explained, as well as criticism against this exegetical method. This is followed by a discussion of Malina & Pilch's commentary as part of the Social-Science Commentary on...-series, as well as Malina's original work, On the Genre and Message of Revelation. It is clear that Malina & Pilch view Revelation as astral prophecy and John as an astral prophet. They interpret Revelation in the light of the first century Mediterranean sky. A case study of Revelation 12:1-18 compares Malina's On the Genre and Message of Revelation, with Malina & Pilch's Social-Science Commentary on Revelation and David Aune's Revelation. In conclusion academic reviews and comments regarding this commentary are discussed. It is my opinion that this commentary adds the best value if it is used together with traditional historical-critical commentaries. Unfortunately, Malina & Pilch has (sic) ignored modern Apocalypse scholarship in their work. Their intense focus on astrology and trying to force the whole of Revelation into an astrological mould is the greatest weakness of this work. This commentary however definitely adds a new dimension to the interpretation of Revelation. It forces an interpreter of Revelation to acknowledge the importance of John's social situation and the first-century Mediterranean world."

An earlier proponent of an astral interpretation of the Book of Revelation was the Russian scientist Nikolaus Morosow. His Russian-language book Revelation in Storm and Tempest (1907) was later translated and published in a German-language edition Die Offenbarung Johannis: Eine astronomish-historische Untersuchung (1912). The author believed that the Book of Revelation was based on events experienced during the day and night of 30th September, 395 CE. His basic premise is the events giving rise to the astronomical and astrological speculations were a thunderstorm and earthquake on the day of a solar eclipse and the course of the constellations during the night. Morosow further believed the author of the Book of Revelation was John Chrysostom (circa 349-407), the future bishop of Constantinople. Needless to say the premise of the book has not found support.
Several persons hold extreme views about astronomical content in the Book of Revelation. The archaeologist and geologist Jeffrey Goodman holds that cometary impact catastrophes are being described in the Book of Revelation. John Lewis (retired Professor of Planetary Sciences at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, and Co-director of the NASA/University of Arizona Space Engineering Center) also believes the Book of Revelation sets out details of commentary impacts.
Another early discussion involving an astral interpretation of the Book of Revelation was conducted by William Ramsay and Johannes Lepsius in a series of dual articles in The Expositor in 1911. Both were historians of religion. See: William Ramsay and Johannes Lepsius "The Symbolic Language of the Apocalypse." (The Expositor, Eighth Series, Volume 1, 1911; Pages 160-180, 210-230, 375-380, 461-475, & 504-519. Note: Pages 210-230, 461-475, & 504-519 are headed "The Symbolic Language of the Revelation.") William Ramsey (1851-1939) was a British archaeologist, and historian, and classical scholar. Johannes Lepsius (1858-1926) was a German Protestant missionary, Orientalist, and humanist. He was the youngest son of the founder of Egyptology in Germany, the Egyptologist Carl Lepsius and his wife Elisabeth Klein (1828–1899).
The use of astral and other myths is inadequate in explaining the images and symbols of the Book of Revelation. The 'celestial realm' language of the Book of Revelation is mostly borrowed from the Old Testament books of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.
Gregory Beale's recent monumental study (The Book of Revelation (1999)) has enabled significant gains to be made in understanding the Book of Revelation. Many scholars hold that Beale has written the best available contemporary commentary on the Book of Revelation. According to Vern Poythress, Beale shows convincingly that Daniel as a whole, and Daniel 2 and 7 most of all, is structurally the most dominant source behind Revelation 1, 4-5, 13, and 17, as well as for several themes and features of Revelation as a whole. (The Book of Revelation never quotes directly from the Old Testament.) It is the view of Beale that, however much use the Book of Revelation makes of Ezekiel, the ultimate purpose of its author is to present the Book of Revelation as a fulfilment of Daniel 7. Beale has also demonstrated that Isaiah 6 permeates the whole canon, from Genesis to Revelation. Beale's analysis of the use of Daniel in the Book of Revelation shows not only that the Book of Revelation refers to specific passages, but also that it is possible to narrow down these particular references to a specific version of the Old Testament.
The book of Daniel is called "the first of the apocalyptic writings." It was in the book of Daniel that the message of eschatology, "the end of the age," was first clearly set out (Daniel 9:24-27; 12.). From the pattern established in the book of Daniel, all other canonical apocalyptic writings have taken their message. The Book of Revelation is related to Old Testament prophecy through the book of Daniel.

Wilhelm Gundel (26/8/1880-5/5/1945) was a renowned German classical philologist who specialized in the history of ancient astronomy and astrology (and alchemy). (Wilhelm Gundel and later his son, Hans Gundel devoted their scholarly research activities almost exclusively to the history of ancient Western astrology.) Wilhelm Gundel was born in Straβburg and died in Gieβen. It is sometimes stated incorrectly that he died 6/5/1945. His career was closely associated with Gieβen (also spelled Giessen or Gissen). He studied at the High School in Mainz and at the Universities of Heidelberg and Gieβen. He received his PhD in 1905 (some sources have 1903) from the University of Gieβen. It was published (in Latin) in 1907 as De stellarum appellatione et religione Romana. In 1914 he completed his Habilitation (teaching qualification (involving writing another thesis and giving a presentation), university level) with his thesis on Ananke and Heimarmene, a detailed examination of the historical development of Ananke (and Heimarmene). (Published in 1914, Beiträge zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der Begriffe Ananke und Heimarmene. According to Gundel's definition anankē (= necessity) is "a natural force which with compelling necessity brings atoms to swirling motion and is the cause of all coming-to-be.") He was a specialist in Greco-Roman and Egyptian astral-lore

and wrote prolifically on these topics. During his career he published over 100 papers and (encyclopedia) articles. Many of his articles appeared in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. In 1920 he became an associate professor at the University of Gieβen, and at the time of his early retirement he was a Professor at the University of Gieβen. From 1906 he also taught at the High School in Gieβen (Gieβen Gymnasium) where he was a senior teacher ("Oberlehrer"). His academic career was spent studying ancient astronomy and astrology. He prepared the 3rd edition (1931) of Sternglaube und Sterndeutung by Franz Boll and Carl Bezold (an uneven but excellent short introduction to ancient Western astrology).
Giessen (spelled Gießen in German) is a small town in central Germany approximately 50km north of Frankfurt am Main. The river Lahn in Giessen divides the town in two parts (west and east). It appears he may have lived in Marburg at one time. In one of his books he wrote "Gundel, Marburg, 1926." Marburg is a small University town. It is also on the river Lahn.
Also academically connected with the University of Gieβen, at the same time as Wilhelm Gundel, was the classical philologist Hugo Hepding (1878-1959), and the classical philologist Karl Kalbfleisch (1868-1946). From 1913 Karl Kalbfleisch was "ordentlicher Professor für klassische philologie an der Universität Gieβen." He was also academically connected with the Gieβen Hochschule. (It appears both Gundel and Hepding, from 1921-1924, assisted with academic presentations when Kalbfleisch was ill.) Another classical philologist and ancient historian at the University of Gieβen was Andreas Thierfelder (1903-1986). He was "ordentlicher Professor in Gießen (1941–1943) und Mainz (1950–1971) wirkte."
The Nazis had his teaching position revoked (but I have no knowledge of the date). (The issue may have been his non-compliance with/opposition to Nazi ideology and/or Nazi views on ancient history.) In 1934 he took, or - because of political circumstances - was made to take, early retirement. He used his early retirement to conduct research work. (During his whole academic career he was kept busy by research.) However, it appears that he was, at the recommendation of Andreas Thierfelder, appointed Honorary Professor (University of Gieβen) sometime in the early 1940s.
By circa the mid 1930's the Nazi regime began initiating a range of often brutal police actions against the German occult movement. Occult teachings were declared illegal. The Nazi regime censored occult publications and took a range of actions against occult activities (and deemed occultists). Police actions against occult activities were first particularly vigorously implemented in 1937 and then again with a second vigorous and brutal crackdown starting June 1941, in the aftermath of Rudolf Hess's flight to Britain. A few months after the start of the second crackdown, SS General Reinhard Heydrich (1904-1942) (Head of the Security Police, and Chief of The Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS (Sicherheitsdienst; (abbreviated SD)) from 1931(1932?) until 1942), relaxed the initial order sufficiently to allow certain deemed occult texts like Wilhelm Gundel's historical study Sternglaube, Sternreligion, und Sternorakel (Belief in Stars, Religion of Stars and the Oracle of Stars) to be removed from the 'black list.'
Towards the end of World War II he was detained and mistreated by the Gestapo. One source states this led to his early death. However, according to Wolfgang Hübner (Universität Trier), after a serious illness Wilhelm Gundel died on 5.5.1945 and was buried in the Old Cemetery (Alter Friedhof), Giessen. The Old Cemetery was created in 1530 and is now also a park.
A small (xxii + 47) memorial volume (Wilhelm Gundel, zum Gedächtnis (1947) was printed. It contains 3 of Wilhelm Gundel's articles from Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, an evaluation of his scientific work by Albert Rehm, a biography by his son Hans Gundel, and a list of his publications (and also a portrait photograph). It is now rare as only 400 copies were printed. Relevant key publications include Sterne und Sternbilder im Glauben des Altertums und der Neuzeit (1922), Dekane und Dekansternbilder (1936), and Neue Astrologische Texte des Hermes Trismegistos (1936). Neue Astrologische Texte des Hermes Trismegistos was reprinted in 1978 with corrections and additions by his son Hans Gundel. Hermes Trismegistos is the Hellenistic rendering of the Egyptian god "Thoth, the thrice great." Thoth was the Egyptian god of learning. Incidentally, the famous Egyptian astrologers Nechepso and Petosiris are undoubtedly instances of pseudepigraphy. Petosiris, the owner of the famous tomb in Hermopolis is not to be identified with Petosiris the astrologer.

Wilhelm Gundel's academic work focused on ancient astronomy and astrology. Both Wilhelm and his son Hans Gundel devoted their entire scholarly life and research activities to ancient astronomy and astrology. (See: "Nachruf auf Hans Gundel." by Andreas Mehl in Gnomon, Band 73, Pages 279-281.) Wilhelm Gundel devoted his scholarly career/research activities almost exclusively to the early history of descriptive astronomy (star/constellation lore and astral beliefs) and astrology. To some extent he was assisted by his son Hans Gundel. His son Hans Gundel. (1912-1999) was a renowned German papyrologist. He was Professur für Alte Geschichte, Justus-Liebig-Universität, Gieβen. (The library of this university was completely destroyed by bombing during World War II.) Relevant key publications include Zodiakos (1992).
In his Sterne und Sternbilder im Glauben des Altertums und der Neuzeit (1922) Wilhelm Gundel comprehensively surveys ancient star beliefs and astrological beliefs. His popular work, Sternglaube,
Sternreligion und Sternorakel: Aus der Geschichte der Astrologie (1933, 2nd edition 1959) is an excellent survey of early astrology.
In his book Neue Astrologische Texte des Hermes Trismegistos [New Astrological Texts of Hermes Trismegistus] (1936) Wilhelm Gundel published the text of a Latin Renaissance manuscript containing the Latin translation of Liber Hermetis Trismegisti [Book of Hermes Trismegistos], an early astrological document, and accompanied it with his brilliant/penetrating commentary and analysis of its content and importance. The Liber Hermetis Trismegisti is an astrological compilation translated from the Greek of the Alexandrian period. Some parts of it can be traced back to the 3rg- or even 4th-century BCE. (Gundel found the Book of Hermes Trismegistos in the late Latin manuscript Codex Harleianus held by the British Museum. (= MS Harley 3731)) The astrological manuscript was probably written circa 1431 CE and is a conglomeration of older astrology-related treatises. "No one knew about any other volumes of the work, though the fact that it had a wide circulation in the Middle ages is proved by the fact that there remains a version of an important chapter written in Picard dialect. This was to be found in a Parisian volume originally written for Marie of Luxembourg (who died in 1324). (Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life by Eugenio Garin (1983, Page vii).)"
The astrological writings pseudonymously attributed to Hermes Trismegistus are thought to have been composed in Alexandria by a Greek, who was strongly influenced by Jewish traditions. The earliest date assigned is circa near the end of the 1st-century CE. The writings focus upon the late Egyptian idea that stellar gods (decani) control the 360 degree zodiacal circle, influencing all terrestrial events on a daily basis.
Gundel established that parts of the text were a translation of Greek astrological literature of the 3rd-century BCE. He also established the text contains a number of Hipparchan and even older ecliptical longitudes of stars. The text is loosely structured through chapter titles. Especially interesting is the 3rd chapter. Chapter 3, entitled "De stellis lucidis et qualitatibus signorum," concerns 68 bright stars, distributed over the entire sky, with coordinates which are usually ecliptical longitudes. (Because it is an astrological text Gundel proposed that 72 stars were contained in the original text (source document) as a doubling of the 36 decans of the zodiac discussed in the first chapter of the text.) This listing of 68 bright stars distributed over the entire sky date to the time of the Greek astronomer Hipparchus (2nd-century BCE). The origin of the star list is connected with the star catalogue established by Hipparchus (and some stars listed might even pre-date it). Gundel, believed that the Book of Hermes Trismegistos was a translation of a Greek original, the archetype of which dated to the Ptolemaic period. However, David Pingree, the outstanding historian of early astronomy and astrology, disputed this. Whilst Pingree (on the basis of astronomical calculations) agreed with Gundel that the essential part of Chapter 3 dates from 130 to 60 BCE, he showed that Chapter 25 is based upon astronomical observations dating to circa 480 BCE. Pingree also showed that Chapter 27 and Chapter 32 overlap with Firmicus Maternus (Roman astrologer, 4th-century CE) and that both must be translating from the same Greek source. (See: David Pingree, Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja, 1978, Volume 2.)
Gundel's Dekane und Dekansternbilder (1936) was detailed investigation of the decan tradition in early astrology, and his belief for its Egyptian origins. "Gundel's analysis showed the importance of the Liber Hermetis for the reconstruction of ancient astrology, from the doctrine of the thirty-six divine decans, which divide the 360 degrees of the sphere, to the numbering of the seventy-two fixed stars which seemed to be connected with Hipparchus's catalogue. (Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life by Eugenio Garin (1983, Page viii).)" Wilhelm Gundel was an authority on the decans and decan images. Gundel was criticised

for over-emphasising the Egyptian influence on the development of Hellenistic astrological beliefs. He denied any substantial Babylonian influence on Hellenistic astrology and held that Egyptian mythology was the main influence. This position arose from his recognition of how little is actually known about Babylonian astrology. Interestingly, in his book, L'Egypte des astrologues (1937) Franz Cumont attempted the experiment of translating the astrological theme of the Liber Hermetis, and the documents linked to it (Latin and Greek astrological texts, from Vettius Valens to Firmicus Maternus), into rigorous anthropological terms and construct a picture of the social and moral conditions of Hellenistic Egypt.
Gundel also published two bibliographical works of importance, Astronomie, Astralreligion, Astralmythologie, und Astrologie. Darstellung und Literaturbericht, 1907-1933, in Bursian's Jahresberichte for 1934, and, in collaboration with his son, Hans Gundel, Astrologoumena: die astrologische Literatur in der Antike und ihre Geschichte (1966). The latter work is basically an annotated list (discussion) of the key astrological works known from classical antiquity.
Wilhelm Gundel had the scholarly habit of heavily annotating all of his personal copies (handexemplar = personal copy or work copy) of his publications. These annotations amounted to corrections, revisions, and additional information. These were likely utilised by Hans Gundel when preparing reprint editions.

Hermann Hunger is an Austrian assyriologist. PhD (1966, Philology) in Ancient Near Eastern Studies, University of Münster (Germany). Professor of Assyriology at the University of Vienna until his retirement in 2007. A leading authority on Babylonian astronomy and Babylonian celestial omens. Hermann Hunger has published widely on Babylonian astronomy/astral sciences (e.g., Astrological Reports to Assyrian Kings (1992). At the 220th meeting of the American Oriental Society on March 12-15, 2010, the membership unanimously elected Hermann Hunger, emeritus professor at the University of Vienna to honorary membership in the America Oriental Society. Among the many paragraphs of praise in the nominating letter is the following: "Professor Hunger’s career trajectory seems uneventful. He earned a doctorate in Assyriology and Semitic philology earlier than most (24), a sign of his competence. His dissertation about colophons was a meticulous assembling of an enormous number of such notices with an imaginative reconstruction about their use. But early on he began collaborative works with Otto E. Neugebauer, the great historian of science in antiquity, and with Abe Sachs who, much earlier, had followed a similar path in working with Neugebauer. The research arrangements moved Professor Hunger into the areas of scholarship for which he is best known now." Within the nominating letter there were also notices about Dr. Hunger’s scholarship ("accurate, reliable, durable"), his wide collaborative efforts, and his crucial role in formulating and finalizing the most basic and indispensable tool of Assyriology, the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD). Currently (2011), Chairman: Commission for Mycenaean Studies; Chairman: Commission for the History of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Medicine. Hunger is a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.
Note: A colophon is a statement appended to a text giving particulars about its genesis or production, and is a text in its own right.
Relevant key publication: Mul.Apin (1989, in collaboration with David Pingree).
(b) Johannes Koch (1926-2011)
Johannes Koch. (1926-2011). Dr. Johannes Koch was perhaps born in northern Bavaria. Johannes Koch was a Lutheran pastor (?) (Pfr. i. R. = Pfarrer im Ruhestand = (literally) Pastor in retirement) and deputy headmaster (StD = Studiendirektor). Std (a senior position) = Studiendirektor = deputy headmaster. "Title of teaching post (entry office) for teachers in the senior civil service grade (teachers at Gymnasien (= Grammar School/Secondary School) and vocational schools). Senior positions are Oberstudienrat and Studiendirektor." Johannes Koch may have been at Reichsstadt-Gymnasium Rothenburg od T (Rothenburg ob der Tauber). He obtained his PhD in 1950 from the University of Erlangen. His published (?) PhD ("Zur Beziehung von Vernunft und Wirklichkeit in der Philosophie Hegels." = "On the Relationship Between Reason and Reality in the Philosophy of Hegel.") had connections with theology.
His degree/MA was likely to be Staatexamen (also spelled Staatsexemen/Staatsexeman). To obtain a professional career at a gymnasium a person has to complete a Staatsexemen. (The "Staatsexeman" is a German degree awarded for studies leading to an academic qualification in state supervised professions such as law, medicine, teaching, pharmacy.) Dr. Johannes Koch (who resided in Rothenburg od T = Rothenburg ob der Tauber (Thomas-Zweiffel-Strasse)) was a distinguished German scholar and student of assyriology; and an expert on historical and astronomical chronology. After obtaining his PhD he became a High School teacher ("Gymnasium"). One of his fields was teaching Protestant Religion. His first teaching position was in northern Bavaria, then for many years until his retirement in 1991 in Rothenburg od T.
His interest in Babylonian astronomy was a personal one unconnected with his teaching duties. Whilst Johannes Koch was not a trained assyriologist his many contributions to Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology were certainly professional and widely welcomed by assyriologists. He attended the Ernst Weidner Colloquium in Graz in 1991. His Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels

(1989) was an important study. In this book Koch attempts to identify a number of Mesopotamian constellations mentioned in the Mul.Apin series. In Chapters 1-3 Koch offers a critical re-evaluation of Waerden (1949) and Reiner and Pingree (1981). In chapters 7-16 Koch deals in elaborate detail with the "planisphere" K 8538 from Niniveh.
In a series of articles, Johannes Koch (1996, 1997, 1998) challenged Wayne Horowitz's interpretation of Mul.Apin II ii 11–12 and stressed that Mul.Apin uses a 360-day year, while the cuneiform tradition did not know a 364-day calendar. In 2007 Koch wrote a 17-page critical analysis of claims linking the Nebra disk with the astronomy of the Babylonian Mul.Apin series: Bedenkenswerts zur Himmelsscheibe von Nebra.
Relevant key publications: Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels (1989). [Most of the biographical details for Johannes Koch were obtained/able to be obtained through the kind assistance given by Dr Hermann Hunger and Dr Joachim Oelsner.]
(c) David Pingree (1933-2005)
David Pingree was an outstanding American classicist and sanskritist and historian of early astronomy. He was born with very limited vision, being blind in one eye and having only 20% vision in the other. (The distance of his vision was only 40 centimetres.) In 1950 he graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He began to teach himself Sanskrit whilst at Phillips Academy. In 1958 he made his first visit to India to study Sanskrit and returned to the USA in 1960. His PhD (in classics and Sanskrit) was obtained from Harvard University (1960). (His doctoral dissertation was jointly supervised by Daniel Ingalls (an outstanding Sankritist) and Otto Neugebauer.) His dissertation title was: Materials for the Study of the Transmission of Greek Astrology to India. Shortly after completing his doctoral dissertation he worked at Harvard University and also assumed a professorship at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago. (In 1992 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago.) He learned Arabic whilst at Harvard University, and also began to compile lists of manuscripts in Sanskrit relating to the exact sciences. David Pingree first began working with Neugebauer while a graduate student and then a junior fellow in Sanskrit and classics at Harvard. David Pingree, encouraged by Otto Neugebauer, spent eight years at the Oriental Institute in Chicago and became familiar with Mesopotamian astral omens. Otto Neugebauer then encouraged Pingree to join him at Brown University. By 1971 Neugebauer's persuasions were successful. In 1971 Pingree joined the History of Mathematics Department at Brown University and succeeded Neugebauer who had retired in 1969 aged seventy. He became chairman of the department in 1986.
Pingree was very productive and authored 43 books and monographs and 240 articles. Pingree's work focused on the history of the exact sciences (including astrology and divination in the ancient world) from the ancient Near East through to the Renaissance. (Included are numerous scientific texts in Arabic, Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit.) He specifically concentrated on the study of relevant texts in the original languages, and on the transmission of scientific ideas between cultures. (In his fundamentally important 1963 paper in the scientific journal Isis he again supported his thesis that Greek (and Greco-Babylonian) mathematical astronomy (and astrology) entered India between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE through a series of direct translations from Greek to Sanskrit.) He also devoted time to cataloguing Sanskrit manuscripts in numerous libraries throughout the world. His monumental Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit (5 Volumes, 19701994) was a catalog of unpublished Sanskrit MSS in various libraries. Another example is his Catalogue of Jyotisa Manuscripts in the Wellcome Library (2004) which contains his comprehensive descriptions of over 1000 manuscripts on astronomy, mathematics, divination, and astrology.
Pingree's personal library collection of approximately 20,000 items is ranked as one of the best in the world for the study of mathematical science in the ancient world. It is now housed in the Brown University Library (David E. Pingree Collection). He received numerous scholarly awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship, and an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago. He was also Chair, American Committee for Asian Manuscripts. From circa the late 1970s he collaborated with assyriologists in publishing cuneiform texts on astronomy and astral omens. With his early death (from diabetes related complications) the very unique Department of the History of Mathematics (established in 1947) at Brown University came to a close. (For nearly 20 years he was the sole permanent faculty member of his department. From January 2009 it was partially reestablished with the appointment of John Steele as Professor of Egyptology and the Ancient Western World, at Brown University, Rhode Island.)

(d) Erica Reiner (1924-2005)
Erica Reiner was a Hungarian-born American assyriologist. Reiner was born in Budapest and received an undergraduate degree in linguistics there in 1948. She then studied Elamite, Sumerian, and Akkadian at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (a university in Paris that is part of the University of Paris) and received a Diploma (= Master's Degree?). (At the time of her death she was one of the few persons proficient in Elamite.) Reiner received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1955. She began working on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary project when she first came to the University of Chicago in 1952 as a research assistant. During this early period she also worked closely with the distinguished assyriologist Adolf Oppenheim. She became an associate editor in 1956 and an editor in 1962. From 1973 to her retirement in 1996 she was editor-in-charge of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary project. After her retirement in 1996 she continued to work on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary project. Her role with the project included writing, editing, and reviewing entries.
At the time of her death she was the John A. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Oriental Institute and editor of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary. (The publication is more an encyclopedia.) Reiner is the only scholar to have contributed to every one of its 26 volumes. The first volume was published in 1956 and the last was published in 2006. Reiner collaborated with David Pingree on four facsimiles of Babylonian Planetary Omens (1975-2005). They comprise studies of the celestial omens and astronomy of a number of tablets forming part of the Babylonian omen series Enuma Anu Enlil. Two volumes deal with Venus omens, one dealt with omens about stars, and the last with Jupiter omens. Reiner took on the challenging task of dealing with the omen series Enuma Anu Enlil to fulfill the wish of Adolf Oppenheim to have all of this major omen series properly published.
Relevant key publications: Babylonian Planetary Omens: Part Two (1981, in collaboration with David Pingree); and Astral Magic in Babylonia (1995).

(e) Gerd Grasshoff [Graßhoff] (1957- )
Born in Homberg/Niederrhein (Moers), Germany, in 1957. Gerd Graßhoff is currently (2012) since 2010 Professor for History of Ancient Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Also since 2010 Gerd Graßhoff has been director of the Excellence Cluster TOPOI. From 1999 to 2010 he was Professor for Science Theory and Science History at the Universität Bern, as well as Director of the Institut für Philosophie der Universität Bern, Switzerland. His research fields cover the history of ancient science from Babylonian astronomy to Modern Times, methods of scientific discovery, and philosophical models of causal reasoning. His academic degrees include: 1995, Habilitation and Venia legendi in Philosophy, University of Hamburg, Germany. Thesis: Die Kunst wissenschaftlichen Entdeckens – Grundzüge einer Theorie epistemischer Systeme; 1986, Dr. rer. nat. Dissertation: Die Geschichte des Ptolemäischen Sternenkatalogs.

(f) Andre le Boeuffle (1924-2006)
André le Boeuffle was a French classicist and historian and renowned specialist on Latin (i,e., Roman) astronomy. He was a specialist in Greco-Roman astral-lore. His PhD thesis, Le vocabulaire latin de l'astronomie (Université de Paris, 1970) was published in 3 volumes. It was also rewritten (abridged) as a single volume, Les noms latins d'astres et de constellations (1977). It is basically concerned with Latin astronomical terminology of classical times and late Roman times. Later in his career he published studies on the theme of cosmic religion and astral mysticism in Roman civilisation (Le ciel des Romains (1989), which had mixed reviews). His academic focus lay in understanding the importance and influence of Roman astral beliefs on ancient and medieval civilizations. This still remains little known, despite the studies of André le

Boeuffle (and others such as Henri Stern, Le Calendrier de 354 (1953; the standard study)). His PhD thesis covers the large amount of important important Latin vocabulary related to astronomical matters and the problems of suitably understanding it (i.e., problems of definition). Critics pointed out there is not, strictly speaking Roman astronomy, and the only astronomer known in Rome (C. Sulpicius Galus, circa. 170 BCE) can not claim to be a scientist. The Romans were debtors of Greek science in both theory and in practice e.g., such inventions as dials, clocks, etc. It is more accurate to speak of "literary" astronomy (Hyginus, some passages of Virgil, translations of Greek texts such as the Phainomena of'Aratos by Germanicus) and "philosophical" astronomy (Lucretius, Martianus Capella). The popularity of the elite and the Roman people for contributions to practical applications of astronomy were numerous and include: Establishing a civil calendar, identification of sunrises and sunsets for the stellar agriculture, construction of sundials. For much of his academic career he was at Université d'Amiens. Other publications included: Astronomie - Astrologie. Lexique Latin (1987); translating and editing, Germanicus: Les Phénomènes d'Aratos (1975); Le Ciel et la mer: l'utilisation de l'astronomie dans la navigation ancienne (1997). Upon his retirement he was Professeur émérite de latin et de grec à l'Université d'Amiens. Membre de l'Académie d'Amiens.
Relevant key publications: Le vocabulaire latin de l'Astronomie (1973, 3 Volumes). (the volumes comprise the authors 1970 doctorate thesis on Classical Roman constellations and star names); Astronomie Astrologie Lexique Latin (1987); Le ciel des Romains (1989).
(3) Arabic
(g) Paul Kunitzsch
German Arabist scholar and philologist. Currently (2007) Professor Emeritus of Arabic Studies at the Institute of Semitic Studies, at the University of Munich, Germany. He spent more than 20 years at the University of Munich (Germany), retiring as a professor of Arabic Studies in the university’s Institute for Semitic Studies. Kunitzsch is acknowledged as having done more to document and study the influence of medieval Arab and Islamic astronomy on European science than any other living scholar. He specialised in the transmission of science from antiquity to the Arabs and from the Arabs to medieval Europe and tracing Arabic influence in medieval European literature and languages. Kunitzsch has specialised in the transmission of astronomy (and other sciences) from antiquity to the Arabs and from Arab-Islamic civilisation to medieval Europe. His work has been fundamental in highlighting the development of Arabic astronomy and star names and their influence on Latin Europe. In his life-long study of the Almagest used 40 different manuscripts that contained the whole of the Almagest. Professor Dr. Kunitzsch has published more than 20 books and monographs, 130 articles, primarily in scientific, journals and congress proceedings, 30 articles in lexicons and 65 major book reviews.
Relevant key publications: Arabische Sternnamen in Europa (1959) (the best and most reliable study of Western use (i.e., adaptations) of Arabic star names); Untersuchungen zur Sternnomenklatur der Araber (1961) (a study of indigenous Arabic constellations and star names); Über eine anwa-Tradition mit bisher unbekannten Sternnamen (1983) (an update to his Untersuchungen zur Sternnomenklatur der Araber); and Peter Apian und Azophi: Arabische Sternbilder in Ingolstadt im frühen 16.

Appendix: Giovanni Schiaparelli
Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) was an eminent Italian astronomer of the 19th-century. He originally graduated in hydraulic engineering and architecture from the University of Turin in 1854. Though not a linguist or philologist by training Schiaparelli was also an outstanding linguist; especially conversant with Greek and Latin. He also had a deep knowledge of cuneiform, mainly self-taught. Schiaparelli carried out his own investigations into Babylonian stars, planets, and constellations. He was determined to prepare for himself a list of all star names occurring in cuneiform texts. More than 40 years before the publication of Felix Gössmann's Planetarium Babylonicum (1950) Schiaparelli was systematically investigating and compiling an extensive list of Babylonian star names. For his investigations he used a variety of cuneiform texts, including the early works of Joseph Epping and Franz Kugler. Schiaparelli read and interpreted hundreds of Babylonian astronomical cuneiform tablets - many of which were reconstructed by the Jesuit scholars Epping, Strassmaier, and Kugler. He also used Astrological-Astronomical Texts (1899) by James Craig; and The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon (1900, 2 Volumes) by Reginald Thompson. For his investigations Schiaparelli kept a particular notebook listing Mesopotamian star names. His outstanding 3-volume history of ancient astronomy (Scritti sulla storia della astronomia antica (Writings on the History of Classical Astronomy) (1925- 1927; Reprinted 1997)) was completed by his pupil Luigi Gabba, (and also with the assistance of Schiaparelli's son?) more than 10 years after his death. See: Basello, Gian. (2010). "Giovanni V. Schiaparelli Orientalista." (Giornale di Astronomia, Volume 36, Number 4, Dicembre, Pages 13-24). For the first part of his Scritti sulla storia della astronomia antica (actually essays) dealing with Babylonian astronomy, Schiaparelli read and interpreted hundreds of Babylonian cuneiform texts reconstructed by Strassmaier, Epping, and Kugler.
The standard edition of Schiaparelli's writings is the 11-volume collection, Le Opere di G. V.Schiaparelli.
