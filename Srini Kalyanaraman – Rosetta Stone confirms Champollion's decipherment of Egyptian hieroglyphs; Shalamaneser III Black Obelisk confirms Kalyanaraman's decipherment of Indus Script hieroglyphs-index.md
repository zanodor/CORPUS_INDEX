Rosetta Stone confirms Champollion's decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs; Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk confirms Kalyanaraman's decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs
This monograph explains why Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk 823 BCE is a Rosetta Stone for decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs by S. Kalyanaraman and presents an overview on how Rosetta Stone of el-Rashid 193 BCE confirmed decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Translation of cuneiform text on Scene 3:
The tributes are:
1. karabha 'two-humped camel' rebus: karba 'iron'
2. ranga 'water-buffalo' rebus: ranga 'pewter, tin' 3. khonda 'young bull' rebus: kunda 'fine gold' singhin 'forward-thrusting, spiny horned' rebus: singi 'ornament gold' 4.medha 'ram, markhor' rebus: med 'iron' OR mreka, mlekh 'goat, antelope' rebus: milakkhu 'copper'
5. ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron' Four monkeys/apes:
6. रत्नी ratnī 'monkey dressed as a woman' Rebus: ratnin 'treasure, gems, jewels'. Hence, the monkey dressed as a woman (cipher text) read ratnI is similar sounding with ratnin (plain text) which makes the gems and jewels a tribute to the King Shalamaneser from Musri

Egyptian hieroglyphs—is a script made up of small pictures used originally in ancient Egypt for religious texts.
One cartouche is repeated five times on the Rosetta Stone and this contained the name of Ptolemy. Together the characters in the cartouche represented the sounds of the Greek letters.
No. 1 in A represents the letter P No. 4 in A represents the letter L
These hieroglyphs are assumed to have the same sound T
Using the assumed values for each hieroglyph the cartouche of Ptolemy my be written like this:
Champollion found other cartouches to signify the name Ptolemy:

Since the Greek form of the name of Ptolemy is Ptolemaios and ends with S. Thus, it is assumed that the last sign in the simplest form of the cartouche has the phonetic value S.
These are two doubtful hieroglyphs, read based on their position in the name of Ptolemy which suggest their phonetic values to be M and some vowel sound in which the I sound predominates. These values were arrived at by guessing and deduction.
This meant that other hieroglyphs in the cartouche of Ptolemy signify royal
titles: The titles are found in the Greek text meaning ‘ever-living, beloved of Ptah’.
The hieroglyhphic text consists of 14 lines only and these correspond to the last 28 lines of the Greek text. The Demotic text consists of 32 lines, the first 14 being imperfect at the beginnings, and the Greek text consists of 54 lines, the last 26 being imperfect at the ends.
Young deciphered in 1819 the name of Ptolemy on a cartouche or oval on the Rosetta stone. Such cartouches always contained a royal name. He was the first to grasp the idea of a phonetic principle in the reading of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. JW Bankes deciphered the name Cleopatra on the granite obelisk excavated at Philae in 1815. In 1822, JF Champollion corrected some readings of Young and deciphered correctly the hieroglyphic forms of the names and titles of most of the Roman Emperors, and drew up a classified list of Egyptian hieroglyphs.
"The key to translating hieroglyphics
The Rosetta Stone is one of the most important objects in the British Museum as it holds the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs—a script made up of small pictures that was used originally in ancient Egypt for religious texts. Hieroglyphic writing died out in Egypt in the fourth century C.E.. Over time the knowledge of how to read hieroglyphs was lost, until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 and its subsequent decipherment...Thomas Young, an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name, that of Ptolemy. The French scholar Jean-François Champollion then realized that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language and laid the foundations of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian language and culture." https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/egypt-art/ptolemaic/a/therosetta-stone
The inscription on the Rosetta Stone (discovered in 1799 by Napoleon's army) is a decree passed by a council of priests.
In the 1820s CE, Frenchman Jean-François Champollion famously deciphered hieroglyphs using the 2nd century BCE
Rosetta Stone is written in two languages: Egyptian and Greek. Egyptian is written in 1. Hieroglyphic and 2. Demotic. The third segment of Greek is written in Greek script.

The Rosetta Stone was discovered in Egypt, at Fort St Julien in elRashid, known as Rosetta. The Stone is a tablet of black rock called granodiorite. It is part of a larger inscribed stone that would have stood some 2 meters high.

The Rosetta Stone, 196 B.C.E. Part of grey and pink granodiorite stela bearing priestly decree concerning Ptolemy V in three blocks of text: Hieroglyphic (14 lines), Demotic (32 lines) and Greek (53 lines). This inscription is one of a series that affirm the royal cult of the 13-yearold Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation (in 196 BCE).
The inscriptions are three translations of the same decree inscribed on the stone three times, in hieroglyphic (suitable for a priestly decree), demotic (the native script used for daily purposes), and Greek (the language of the administration).
