INTRODUCTION
he Khazar Empire (ca. 650–ca. 965–969), one of the largest states of medieval Eurasia, extended from the Middle Volga lands in the north to the Northern Caucasus and Crimea in the south and from the Ukrainians steppe lands in the west to the western borders of present day Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the east. Its determinant component was Turkic in origin and it must be understood within the context of medieval Eurasian, Turkic, nomad-based states. It played a key role in the history of the peoples of Rus’, medieval Hungary and the Caucasus and had an impact on the whole of Eastern-Northeastern Europe, the Balkans and the Islamic Middle East. Khazaria became one of the great trans-Eurasian trading terminals connecting the northern forest zones with Byzantium and the Islamic Caliphate. We ind information on the Khazars written in Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, Middle and Neo-Persian, Greek, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, medieval Slavic and Chinese. A number of undeciphered runiform scripts were used on the territory of Khazaria, but a corpus of texts in what can be identiied as the Khazar language has yet to be established. Courted by both Byzantium and the Islamic Caliphate, the Khazars, in the ninth century, converted to Judaism. Ater it was overrun by the Rus’ and their Turko-nomadic allies, this once powerful Eurasian empire rapidly faded. he name “Gazaria” survived for some time as the designation of the Crimea, one of the regions long associated with them. he seemingly sudden disappearance of Khazaria with its connections across Eurasia and the Middle East has given it a romantic glow. he Judaization of its ruling core already in the Middle Ages produced a narrative that served as a framework to a philosophical work by Judah ha-Levi. In modern writings it has produced a range of political sentiments, running the gamut from anti-Semitic-tinged nationalism to attempts to derive Eastern European Jewry from the Khazars. As a consequence, in addition to the growing body of scholarly studies on the Khazars, there has been no shortage of speculative or politically motivated works and even several novels including Milorad Pavić’s much-heralded fantasy, he Dictionary of the Khazars. Nonetheless, numerous fundamental questions regarding the Khazars, their language, history and culture, remain unanswered or in

dispute. he location of the Khazar capital Atïl/Etil has yet to be discovered, although some new, tantalizing inds in the Lower Volga region may resolve this question. he growing body of DNA research on Ashkenazi Jewry may determine the possibility of a Khazar component in the shaping of Eastern European Jews. he papers in this volume stemming from a wide variety of disciplines shed new light on this important empire that was so central to the history of its era. hey represent a wide range of viewpoints and give a good idea of the state of Khazar studies in the present day. In the intervening years since the Colloquium, many of the authors updated and expanded their papers, which were irst presented in 1999. he papers were originally written and presented in an array of languages, a cultural note that would have been completely understandable to Khazaria’s contemporaries. Khazar studies have always been international in character attracting scholars from countries as geographically far apart as the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Japan. Given the variety of transcription systems used in diferent languages to render the polyglot medieval and modern literature on the Khazars, no attempt has been made by the editors to bring them into a uniform system. he Colloquium was primarily organized by Professor Haggai BenShammai of the Hebrew University and the Ben-Zvi Institute which provided an ideal setting for this international conference. his volume of selected papers was edited by Professor Peter B. Golden (Rutgers University) in collaboration with Professor Haggai Ben-Shammai and Professor Emeritus András Róna-Tas (Szeged University). Special thanks are owed to Dr. Roman K. Kovalev (College of New Jersey), who undertook the task of editing the article of his late mentor homas Noonan.

Having said that much in Hebrew, and paid due respect to the tongue of the land, I will switch now to English, with due respect to the international forum here. Prof. Tadmor, Vice President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities; Professor Ben-Sasson, Rector of the Hebrew University; Judge Bar-Tov, Chairman of the Board of Yad Yizhak Ben-Zvi; Mr. Zvi Magen, the ambassador of Israel to the Russian Federation; Dear participants in the Conference; Very distiguished guests.
I feel deeply pleased and honored, and somewhat excited, to open this International Colloquium on the Khazars. When we irst spoke about this conference, and that was perhaps a year and a half ago, it sounded almost like a dream, and now the dream has come true. I am not very



familiar with the history of international conferences on the Khazars, but it seems to me that the assessment that this gathering is quite unique and unprecedented in its magnitude and the diversity of its participants makes good sense. he subject of the Khazars has been neglected for many years in Israel, for various reasons, some of which may come up in the course of our deliberations here. he profound philosophicalreligious dialogue between the legendary Khazar king and the Jewish Rabbi, or odd genealogical theories got much more attention than the historical circumstances or the material remains of the ancient people of the steppe who triggered all these stories and images. If I may share with you my personal experience, I would say that as an adolescent the story of the Khazars that had made a rather deep impression on me was a Hebrew version of a historical novel authored originally in German by a long forgotten Jewish-Austrian blind writer named Oskar Baum. he subject of the actual history of the Khazars has attracted renewed public interest in Israel in recent years, due to a number of factors, not least among them a television series made by Mr. Ehud Yaari, who is with us tonight. he Ben-Zvi Institute, dedicated to the study of the Jewish Communities in the East, thought that the public interest in this peculiar Jewish existence, or perhaps community, in the East deserved to be matched by a scholarly statement that would comprehend all the aspects relevant to the subject, by bringing together, perhaps for the irst time, experts in diferent disciplines, from diferent cultural and academic traditions. We do hope that our initiative will be a starting point to renewed, inter-disciplinary research of the Khazars. Luckily, this initial thought had been met with much good will, even enthusiasm, from several institutions and individuals, which brings me to the pleasant duty of expressing our thanks to all those who deserve it. InaccordancewiththeancientHebrewmaxim( ), I will start in honoring our hosts, and extend our thanks to the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities, who has generously undertaken to host this opening reception and session. hanks also to the Hebrew University, who also made a kind contribution towards convening this conference. To the Centre for Academic Educational Relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States and Baltic States, and its director, Dr. Nathan Patlas; the Centre has recently started its activities, and their contribution to our Colloquium was one of the irst of them. We look forward to continuous and fruitful cooperation with the Centre.

To Judge David Bar-Tov, the chairman of the Board of Yad Yizhak Ben-Zvi, who is going to address us tonight, and Dr. Zvi Zameret, the Director of that Foundation, both of whom gave us continuous support and encouragement during the long period of complex preparations for this conference. To the members of the Steering Committee, who have lent us their erudition, rich experience and wisdom in devising the program of the conference. hey are (in alphabetical order): Dr. Reuven Amitai (Chairman of the Dept. of Islamic Studies, the Hebrew University), Professor Menahem Ben-Sasson (Rector of the Hebrew University), Mr. Zeev Elkin (of the Department of Jewish History at the Hebrew University), whose dedicated involvement in the preparations for this conference was an invaluable contribution to its success, Professor Peter B. Golden (of Rutgers University in New Jersey, U.S.A.), Dr. Shelomo Kol-Yaakov (of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University), Professor Vladimir Petrukhin (of Moscow University), Professor Shaul Shaked (of the Hebrew University and chairman of the Academic Committee of the Ben-Zvi Institute), Professor Haim Tadmor (Vice President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities), who is also going to address us tonight, and Professor Michael Zand (of the Department of Indian, Iranian and Armenian Studies at the Hebrew University).
Our gratitude is due to the staf of the institutions involved in organizing the Conference. We professors are strong in words, but somebody has to do the work. We thank the staf of the Israel Academy, especially Dr. Lea Tzivoni, the Academic Secretary. We are deeply indebted to the staf of the Ben-Zvi Institute, Mr. Michael Glatzer, the academic Secretary, and Mrs. Sarit Noy, our Administrative Aide, who have both invested many months of incessant eforts towards the success of this gathering, as well as my deputy, Mr. Nahem Ilan, and our secretary, Ms. Irit El-Al. Finally, I wish to extend a warm and heartily welcome to our dear colleagues, the participants in the Conference who have come almost from the four corners of the earth, to share this scholarly experience. his gathering is oicially termed COLLOQUIUM, that is a conversation. It is going to be a multi-lingual conversation, and simultaneous

translation will facilitate the participants’ ability to follow each other’s presentations (not tonight!). In the spirit of the literal meaning of the term colloquium, and notwithstanding the linguistic diversity, I hope and wish you all that our gathering will result in bringing about fruitful scholarly conversation and free low or exchange of information and views, and maybe some new solutions to age old riddles of the Khazars’ story.

KHAZAR STUDIES: ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERSPECTIVES
Peter B. Golden
In the Fârsnâma of Ibn al-Balhî, a twelth-century Seljuk-era historian and geographer whose work was commissioned by one of the Iranian Seljukids, the story is related that the Sâsânid Shâh, Husraw I Anûšîrvân (531–579) placed at the right of his throne, “a seat of gold and (two) other seats of gold on the let and behind (his throne). Of these three seats, one was reserved for the King of China, the other for the King of Byzantium and the third for the King of the Khazars, so that should they come, they would sit on these seats. hey were kept all year long and no one else could sit on them.”1 Although it might be argued that this late source has garbled the tale and that the throne was reserved for the Western Türk Qağan (Anûširvân was married to a daughter of the Türk Qağan,2 yet other manuscripts have the Hephthalite monarch), this is not crucial. As we shall see there was, most probably, a relationship between the Khazar ruling house and that of the Western Türks. Even more importantly, the Khazar Qağan, anachronistically or not, was considered worthy enough to take his rightful seat alongside the other major superpower emperors of Eurasia. One of the great colossi of medieval Eurasia, a state whose borders encompassed the Dnepr zone in the West, the Middle Volga in the North, the trans-Volgan steppe approaches to Khwârazm in the East and the Crimea and North Caucasian steppelands in the South, the Khazar Qağanate was one of the more long-lived steppe empires, lasting some 300 years (ca. 650–ca. 965–969).3 It contained an ethnically variegated

population of Turkic, Iranian, Finno-Ugrian, Slavic, Palaeocaucasian peoples and Jewish communities of some antiquity in the Crimea and Caucasus. In the economic realm, Khazaria included populations that were pastoral nomadic, semi-nomadic, agriculturalist, viniculturalist as well as those engaged in ishing, hunting and gathering. here were also signiicant urban populations, both of indigenous and immigrant origins consisting of merchants and cratsmen. he judicial system provided for the legal practices of Jews, Muslims, Christians and pagans in ways that presage the later millet system of the Ottoman Empire. Khazaria had and largely retains an enviable reputation for religious toleration. In this regard, it was typical of many of the early Turkic nomadic polities. he Qağanate also possessed a formidable military machine, the foundation upon which the whole of this imperial ediice rested. he ruler maintained a salaried personal army/comitatus numbering some 7000–10,000 mounted warriors. On those occasions when the Qağan sallied forth, all prostrated themselves before his awesome majesty. he Khazar Qağanate was, indeed, one of the great powers of the age. It played an important role in Rus’ history4 (the extent of which is still hotly debated),5 in early Hungarian history and in the history of the Caucasus. It halted the penetration of the Volga and Black Sea steppes lands by the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. It was a leading player in international trade, both east-west and north-south, becoming one of the major trading partners of and conduits to the ‘Abbâsid Caliphate, contributing in this way to the remarkable elorescence of ninth century Baghdad. It may be classiied as one of the “trade-tribute empires” of the period 551–907, extracting tribute from and trading with its subject populations and sedentary neighbors. Such states also included their progenitors, the Türks, as well as their contemporaries, the Uyğur, Tibetans and

Qitan states6 (with exception of the Tibetans, all these other states also derived from the Türk Empire). he economic history of Eastern Europe and the lands of the Caliphate cannot be properly understood without reference to the Khazars. Ġulâms of Khazar origin, or those who entered the Caliphate through Khazaria, became some of the leading igures of ‘Abbâsid politics.7 Among them was “Buğa the Elder” (Buġâ al-Kabîr), one of the most powerful of these ġulâm commanders. He was active in the Caucasus in the mid-ninth century and at one point was suspected of “taking council with his kinsmen, the Khazars.”8 he conversion of signiicant elements of the Khazars to Judaism and the role of Khazarian Jewry (undoubtedly a community of multiple origins) in the shaping of modern Eastern European Jewish communities remain highly polemical issues. he latter question, in particular, has given rise to a number of “popular” and controversial studies, such as those by Arthur Koestler or Boris Altschüler with their sweeping claims of Khazar legacy and inluence.9 Most recently, they have been brought into the discussion of the origins of the Qazaq people,10 as the new Qazaq Republic attempts to explore the parameters of its past. Despite the importance of the Khazars to their contemporaries in Eurasia and the Near East clearly relected in the medieval sources, they are barely noted in the growing ield of World History studies.11 hey

do not fare appreciably better in some works devoted to Central Asia or the steppe.12 he recent UNESCO-sponsored History of Civilizations of Central Asia while inding much to say about India (South Asia) an important cultural inluence in Central Asia (oten through other intermediaries), but nonetheless peripheral to the region, largely ignores the Western Eurasian extension of the Central Asian steppes and notes the Khazars only in passing.13 Some ity years earlier, Grousset in his admirable L’Empire des Steppes devoted slightly more than three pages to them.14 Happily, the Khazars are given more extensive and fully justiied treatment in some other recent general studies such as the Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia.15 More oten than not, however, they have been the “stepchildren” of other studies, especially those dealing with the origins of the Rus’ and Hungarian states; briely considered, but not the primary focus of attention. Perhaps one of the problems is that there are few statements that can be made about the Khazars without resorting to qualiications. hey were and remain problematic. Fity years ago, in his review of Ananiasz Zajączkowski’s Ze studiów nad zagadnieniem chazarskim, Omeljan Pritsak remarked that “wie bekannt, gehört das Chas.-Problem zu den schwierigsten, vor allem aus den Gründe, weil die in vielen Sprachen verfassten Quellen sehr dürtig, heterogen und vielfach kaum authentisch sind.”16 Although I think he would want to qualify “kaum authentisch”
(Chicago, 1963), pp. 420, 443, 447, 448, 477, 479, 650, 782. He does, however, correctly
contextualize them in relation to Byzantium and the Caliphate and views their adoption
of Judaism as a means to “resist assimilation into the body politic of any of their greater
neighbors” (p. 479).

now, little has otherwise changed. Denis Sinor, in his 1963 bibliographical introduction to Central Eurasian history, still declared that “les études Khazares sont d’une compléxité peu ordinaire.”17 Fundamental questions remain unresolved. As Irène Sorlin observed in her overview of Soviet scholarship on the subject up to the 1960s, the origins and disappearance of this once mighty empire remain shrouded.18 he Russian historian Lev Nikolaevič Gumilëv, with his git for pithy phrases, termed Khazaria “a steppe Atlantis” (stepnaja Atlantida)19 and it has, like the latter, became the subject of fact and fancy, critical study and romantic speculation. here are, at present, a number of web sites on the Internet devoted to them indicating the growing interest in Khazarica outside of scholarly circles. It is not my intention to present a full, detailed account of the course of Khazar studies over the past three centuries.20 here is neither the time—nor the need—to do so. Francis Dvornik in his path-breaking study of Constantine and Methodius surveyed the literature up to 1933. Gyula Moravcsik, in his indispensable Byzantinoturcica, noted the most important works from 1822 to 1957. Avrahm Yarmolinsky published two extensive bibliographies in 1938 and 1959. his was followed by a select, annotated bibliography by Bernard Weinryb in 1963.21 Already at that time there were over 550 entries. he more important and useful

of these works are noted in the major studies on the Khazars that have appeared since the 1930s. My task, rather, is to present some idea as to what Khazarology has accomplished thus far and to perhaps suggest some future directions. Even a quick glance at modern Khazar studies will show that scholars are far from universal accord on many fundamental issues—although there are, I think, also some broad grounds of agreement. Any presentation, of the achievements of Khazar studies, I might add, is necessarily idiosyncratic, inevitably relecting personal interests, languages, political and cultural education etc. I make no claims that my comments will be otherwise.
The Hungarian School
I will begin my survey with some remarks about what we may call the Hungarian School. his may strike some as an odd point of departure, but the Hungarians scholars, with their long-standing and understandable interest in the Altaic and Uralic languages of Eurasia, are a logical starting point. A necessary preface to modern work in Khazar studies was the path-breaking study of the Bulğar Turkic loanwords in Hungarian by Zoltán Gombocz (1877–1935) which appeared in 191222 and a number of lesser studies such as József húry’s identiication of Ibn Rusta’s (îšâ) with the Turkic title šad.23 Of fundamental importance is a work by the great Hungarian Turkologist, Gyula Németh (1890–1976), devoted to the origins of the Hungarians, his A honfoglaló magyarság kialakulása (“he Formation of the Hungarian People in the Conquest Era”), a work which irst appeared in 1930. A long awaited revised and expanded version appeared in 1991 more than a decade ater his death.24 he second edition has become as much a bibliographical rarity as the irst. Németh sought to trace and ix within the larger context of ethnogenetic processes in Eurasia the origins of the Hungarians, an Ugric tribal confederation drawn to the borders of the steppe world and profoundly

inluenced there by Turkic peoples (indeed most of the Hungarian tribal names can be etymologized on the basis of Turkic),25 eventually becoming part of the steppe world. his was relected in the names by which the early Medieval Hungarians, or Proto-Hungarians, were known to the outside world (Sabirs, Türks—the Byzantines called them ) and in their institutions (e.g. the dual kingship of the Gyula and Kende, both steppe titles) and their alliance with Khazaria. Joined while still in the Pontic steppes by the Khazar rebels known as the Qabars, who came with them to their new home in Pannonia, we know from Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s famous account that the Qabars taught them the Khazar tongue, which they still spoke in Constantine’s day (mid-tenth century). he Qabars in turn learned Hungarian and enjoyed a high status among them.26 Presumably, Khazar Qabar is the source for some of the pre-Ottoman and pre-Cuman Turkic loanwords in Hungarian.27 We begin with Németh because his work, important both methodologically and substantively, and that of some other Hungarian scholars, is directly related to any discussion of the name Khazar and its etymology. his is our irst question: who were the Khazars? Németh, building on an already long-standing tradition of scholarship in these areas, rightly deduced that the question of Hungarian ethnogenesis would never be satisfactorily explained without reference to the formation of the peoples of the Western Eurasian steppes. In particular, he focused on ethnonymic patterns and on the basis of Turkic philology presented a reconstruction of the migrations of the early or Proto-Hungarians. In the process he had to touch on the Khazars, who loom very large in the steppe phase of Hungarian history, as well as the European Huns, the various Oğuro-Bulğaric peoples, the Sabirs and Türks. He was particularly interested in the Khazar language and having reviewed the conlicting testimony of the sources and some of the Khazar linguistic remnants, concluded that the reference to a language spoken in Khazaria that did

not resemble any other language (al-Istahrî, Ibn Hawqal)28 could hardly be anything else but Hungarian. Beyond the Hungarian presence in this polyglot state, there were, he suggested, speakers of Bulğar Turkic, Türk and Sabir (which he viewed as Common Turkic) and various other tongues (e.g. Slavic). While not taking a stand in the irst edition on Khazar’s ailiations within Turkic, in the second edition there is the parenthetical remark: “in a simpliied way, the Khazar language has been identiied with Bulğaric” (A kazár nyelvet leegyszerűsítve, azonosították már a bolgárral).29 his seems to be the view of many Hungarian Turkologists as relected in the works of L. Ligeti.30 Noting the sparcity of Khazar linguistic data, András Róna-Tas, however, while inclining towards its possible ailiation with Čuvaš (i.e. Oğuric/Bulğaric) Turkic, urges caution.31 he Oğuric peoples (e.g. the Šarağurs, Oğurs [ , recte = Uğor perhaps a garbling of * = Oğur], = Oğur], Onoğurs, Bulğars et al.), who are attested in the Western Eurasian steppes from at least 463 A.D. when they dispatched ambassadors to Constantinople (as we know from Priscus),32 were part of a larger confederation of tribes that arched across Eurasia, called Tiele [T’ieh-lê, Chinese forms are given in Pinyin transcription with, when necessary, the older Wade-Giles system in brackets] in the Chinese sources. he Tiele included elements that were comprised the Uyğur confederation.33 his Uyğur connection has some potential relevance to our theme (see below).

pp. 222, 225 who reports that the Khazar language was not Turkic or Persian, nor did
it resemble any other language and then contradicts that by remarking that Khazar was
like Bulğaric. Ibn Hawqal, Kitâb Sûrat al-Ard (Beirut, 1992), pp. 332, 335 has the same
notice. Al-Bîrûnî, Al-Atâr al-baqiyya ‘an qurûn al-hâliyya, ed. C.E. Sachau (Leipzig,
1878, reprint: 1923, Baghdad, n.d.), pp. 41–42, says that the Suwar, who were part of the
Volga Bulğar union, spoke a language that was a mixture of Khazar and Turkic.

he ethnonym Oğur is itself clearly the Oğuric/Bulğaric form of Oğuz, a term that originally denoted “tribe” or “lineage” and was translated as such by the Chinese (cf. Toquz Oğuz = Gaoxing [Kao-hsing]). he full history of the Tiele has yet to be written and is one of the many desiderata of Eurasian and early Khazar studies. A useful introduction to this and other questions may be found in Károly Czeglédy’s, “he Age of Nomadic Migrations,” a study of migrations in the steppe from the Xiongnu to the arrival of the Türks in the Pontic zone that appeared in Hungarian in 1969 and in a revised English translation in 1983.34 he Oğuric Turks spoke a form of Turkic that already at that time diverged from Common Turkic and the number of distinctive phonological markers (e.g. rhotacizm, lambdaism) would grow over time. he debate continues over the place of Oğuric within Turkic and the chronology of these changes which are largely studied through the fragments of Danubian and Volga Bulğar, the Oğuric loanwords in Hungarian and the history of Čuvaš, the only surviving member of this language grouping.35 he determination of whether the Khazar language belonged to the Oğuric or Common Turkic groupings would shed important light on Khazar origins. he most recent summation of this question is found in Marcel Erdal’s contribution to this volume. Németh, following Gombocz, derived the ethnonym Χazar/Козары etc. = *Qazar from Turkic qaz- “to ramble, to roam” (cf. Qazaq), a presumed velar variant of the Common Turkic kez-).

of names denoting nomadic life style.36 With the publication of the fragmentary Tes and Terkhin (Tariat) inscriptions from the Uyğur Empire (744–840) and the appearance there of the name Qasar (it is unclear if this is a personal or tribal name), however, other hypotheses were brought forward.37 Bazin, noting its phonetic identity with the Uyğur tribal name Qasar, derived it from Turkic qas- “to tyrannize, oppress, terrorize.”38 András Róna-Tas connected it with the Middle Persian rendering of the Roman title Caesar: Kesar (cf. the Tibetan dru-gu Gesar “the Turk Gesar”) > Qasar. In Oğuric Qasar could become Qazar > Xazar.39 hus, the ethnonym *Qazar would be connected with Qasar and the Khazars themselves could, presumably, be seen as stemming from the Tiele/Uyğur grouping. his was not a new idea. An attempt to connect the Kesa and Hesa [K’o-sa, Ho-sa ] “Khazars” of Chinese sources with the similarly named Gesa [Ko-sa], was made by D.M. Dunlop (on whom see below) who, for good measure, also viewed the of Priscus (see above) as a corruption of the ethnonym Uyğur.40 here are problems with these constructions as well. he Japanese scholar resident in Hungary, Toru Senga, has concluded that the Uyğur Gesa/Qasar is not a tribal name but the surname of the chief of the Sikari tribe of the Toquz Oğuz and any attempt to search for Khazar origins in

the Uyğur confederation “is not plausible.”41 he Medieval (and Modern) Chinese renderings of Khazar, invariably prefaced by Tujue (Türk) are problematic: Kesa was pronounced in Early Middle Chinese (EMC, up to ca. 601) and Late Middle Chinese (LMC, ca. 7th–8th century) something like kha’ sat and Hesa (EMC) γat sat, (LMC) x at sat.42 Final -t in EMC and LMC oten transcribes -r in foreign words. hus, the Chinese forms could render *Kasar/*Kazar, *Ġatsar, *Ġazar, *Ġasar etc. hese transcriptions use a diferent irst character than the one used to render the Uyğur Qasar, Gesa (EMC, LMC: Kat sat)43 = *Kar sar = *Kasar. he rendering of a foreign medial -z- in Chinese is problematic. hus, the modern ethnonym “Kazakh”/Qazaq is transcribed as hasake in Modern Mandarin. Medieval Uyghur tüzün “noble, well-behaved,” is rendered in EMC as t sinh, LMC tu sin` = Modern Chin. duxin.44 hus, a case can be made that Kesa and Hesa transcribed *Qazar. Other diiculties may be seen in the presence of the anthroponym Qasar not only among the Uyğurs and later Mongols, but also among the North Caucasian Huns, vassals of the Khazars themselves, in the form *Qasar (Č’at’ Kasar ᑩᒘᔆ ᑧᒘᔦᒘᔩ noted by Movsês Dasxuranc’i).45 Moreover, the word qasar is found in later Qıpčaq as the term for a type of dog (cynonyms are not uncommon among the Turks and Mongols) and may well derive from a root *qas associated with “jaw, mandibles.”46 he question remains open and we shall return to it in our discussion of Khazar origins. We might also note here that the Hungarians were, understandably, very much interested in the Eastern sources for Hungarian/Proto-Hungarian history. In 1900, the sources for the history of the Conquestera Hungarians, including excerpts from and translations of the most important Arab and Persian authors were published.47 Important works

dealing with the Arab and Persian sources on the Khazars were published by Mihály Kmoskó (1876–1931) in the 1920s.48 he irst volume of his “Muslim Authors on the Steppe Peoples,” however, has only recently appeared.49 Kmoskó also did important research in the Syriac sources for the Steppe peoples which has, also, only recently appeared.50 he conversion of the Khazars attracted attention in the diicult years of World War II.51 More recent scholarship dealing with Hungarian origins, too extensive to be discussed in detail here, invariably devotes some attention to the Khazar question.52 For example, Gyula Kristó has pointed to the impact of Khazar institutions, such as the dual kingship with a sacral king, on early Hungarian political organization.53 In a later work, translated into English, he touches on these and related themes, presenting his views on the Khazar-Hungarian relationship. He does not believe that this relationship began before the 830s. He places the Qabar revolt in the 810s (he considers the Qabars to be OnoğurBulğars) and dates the period of close Hungarian-Khazar alliance to the relatively brief span between 840–860 (in this he follows a suggestion

of Marquart).54 Róna-Tas’s study of the sources for and ethno-linguistic pre-history of the formation of the Hungarians is both a summation of more than a century of Hungarian scholarship on these questions, many of which directly touch on Khazar history, but also provides many new analyses of problems in Khazar history.55 he Hungarian contributions, then, have been largely in the area of linguistics and source-analysis and have grown out of concerns within the adjoining ield of Hungarian protohistory. Curiously, Hungarian scholars have not yet produced a book on the Khazars themselves.
Russian Historiography and the Khazar Question
While the Hungarian school was heavily focused on linguistic issues, so crucial to the methodology employed in their reconstruction of Hungarian proto-history, Russian and Soviet scholarship, truly on the frontlines of Khazar studies, was broadly historical, with a strong interest in those Oriental sources that also shed important light on the origins of the Rus’ state and neighboring peoples of the Russian and Soviet state. Having within its borders the territories in which these nomadic formations and early states were found, it was also natural that there was a very signiicant archaeological component. Indeed, Russian and Soviet scholars were in a uniquely advantageous position to uncover and use this material. One of the earliest modern attempts to present what was known about the Khazars was carried out by V.V. Grigor’ev (1816–1881) who in a series of articles that appeared in the 1830s dealt with Khazar political institutions and history. hese articles were later collected in his book Russia and Asia.56 his was shortly followed by D.I.

Khazar history in 1840.57 Some forty-eight years later, P.V. Golubovskij who had previously (1883) published a work on the post-Khazar, preMongol nomad neighbors of Rus’ and now had at his disposal the editions and translations of the most important Oriental sources, took up the issue of the Bulğars and Khazars. But, as Artamonov later noted, added little that was new.58 Inevitably, Khazar studies became caught up in larger issues which may be placed under the rubric of “Rus’ and the Steppe,” one of the key themes of medieval Russian historiography up to the present day. he impact of the nomads on issues as diverse as state-formation, political organization, religion, language and the culture of the Eastern Slavic peoples, in particular of the Russians and Ukrainians, has been much debated and engendered an extensive and sophisticated literature.59 For the pre-Činggisid period much attention has been devoted to political issues, e.g. the question of the role of the Khazar Qağanate and later nomadic polities in the fostering or destruction of the economy of Kievan Rus’. An interest in cultural interaction and borrowing was rare and came largely from the margins, from independent, i.e. institutionally unailiated scholars, oten with political agendas of their own. I have in mind here the works of the Russian-Jewish scholars Julius Brutzkus (Julij Davidovič Bruckus, 1870–1951) and German Markovič Barac (Baratz, 1835–1922) who sought Hebrew inluences, via Khazar intermediation, in Old Rus’ culture.60 A few non-Jewish scholars such as

Nikita Aleksandrovič Meščerskij (1907–1987), have more recently also explored these themes.61 Russian scholarship early on brought into play the Eastern sources providing editions and translations (into Latin, German and Russian) of key sources, oten with learned commentaries. A brief digression on these compilations is in order as they formed the underpinnings of much of the subsequent scholarship. hey began with the edition by Christian M. Fraehn (1772–1851) of Ibn Fadlân’s Risâla in 1823.62 Important texts were published in 1842–1844 by Boris Andreevič (Johan Albrecht Bernhard) Dorn (1805–1881), in his “Beiträge zur Geschichte der kaukasischen Länder und Völker aus morgenländischen Quellen,” part IV of which contained excerpts from at-Tabarî, Hâiz-i Abrû and Ibn A‘tam al-Kûfî.63 Several years later, he Azerbaijani scholar, Mirza A. Kazembeg published the important North Caucasian local chronicle, the Turkic Derbend-Nâme with an English translation.64 From 1869 and into the 1880s, usually within a few years of each other and not always in a spirit of friendly competition, Daniil Avramovič Xvol’son (1819–1911) published his study and translation of Ibn Rusta (whose name he mistakenly read as Ibn Dasta) and Avram Jakovlevič Garkavi [Harkavi] (1835–1919) his collection of Islamic sources on Rus’ and the Slavs and Hebrew sources on the Khazars. Both engaged in some heated exchanges over the Jewish inscriptions of the Crimea and the collections of the controversial Karaite scholar Avraam Samuilovič Firkovič (Firkowicz, 1786–1874).65

A culmination point of this phase of Khazar studies was reached with the edition and translation of the then known Khazar Hebrew correspondence along with pertinent extracts from some other Hebrew sources by a student of Xvol’son, the Leningrad Semiticist Pavel Konstantinovič Kokovcov (1861–1942) in 1932. his was a work of enormous erudition which sought to provide the textual and historical basis for the resolution of the problem of the authenticity of the correspondence. In cautious and measured tones, Kokovcov allowed for the authenticity of the Hasdai b. Šaprût—King Joseph exchange, which, of course, had suffered the vagaries of time and possible interpolations of later hands. He was much less sanguine about the Cambridge Geniza text, previously published by Solomon Schechter,66 as a contemporary, i.e. tenth century document. Rather, he saw in it various parallels with the Book of Josippon and posited some possible Byzantine literary work as the source for some of its information.67 he focus of the Russian school on key texts, edited and translated with extensive commentaries, was continued in the work of scholars who emigrated in the atermath of the collapse of the Tsarist Empire, e.g.: the translation by Vladimir Fëdorovič Minorskij (Minorsky, 18771966) of the Hudûd al-‘Âlam, a work that was discovered by the Russian scholar A.G. Tumanskij in 1882. he full Persian text was only published in 1962 by the Iranian scholar Manučihr Sutûdeh.68 he irst edition of Minorsky’s translation, accompanied by an exhaustive commentary, appeared in 1937. he Hudûd is an anonymous Persian geographical compilation from 982 which contains important notices on the Khazars and their neighbors.69 In his translation and commentary on the

khazar studies: achievements and perspectives 23
Ta’rîh al-Bâb, a local North Caucasian chronicle elements of which were preserved in the Jâmi‘ ad-Duwal of the seventeenth-early eighteenth century Ottoman historian Müneccimbaşı, Minorsky found hitherto unknown information about Khazar onomastics and a migration, in 1064, of Khazars to the Caucasus.70 In 1939, the Baškir emigré historian and political igure, Ahmad Zeki Validi Togan (1890–1970), published his edition and German translation of the Mašhad manuscript of Ibn Fadlân’s Risâla. his account of the latter’s journey through Eurasia to Volga Bulğaria, contains unique information about the Khazars and other peoples of the region (the Oğuz, the Rus’, the Bulğars etc.). Here too, the text was accompanied by a rich and occasionally problematic commentary and excursi as well as passages from then still unpublished sources such as Ibn A‘tam alKûfî.71 A Russian translation with an equally erudite, if less sweeping commentary, was published by the Ukrainian scholar Andrej Petrovič Kovalevskij (Kovalivs’kyj, 1885–1969) that same year and in fuller form in 1956.72 hese collections and text editions/translations were of enormous importance to not only Khazar studies, but to students of Medieval Russian and East European history as a whole. he tradition of these source-collections was continued by the Polish scholar Tadeusz Lewicki in his corpus of Arabic sources for the history of the Slavs,73 which has a great deal of information relating to the Khazars accompanied by a very thorough and erudite commentary. A very useful study of one grouping of Muslim sources, the so-called “Caspian Codex” was done by Boris Nikolaevič Zaxoder (1898–1960), which provides translations of some of the more important texts, setting them in an historiographical context.74 Zaxoder sought to trace the origins of oten repeated and

occasionally garbled notices in this grouping of Muslim authors dealing with Eastern Europe. Chapter III of the irst volume is a self-contained 112 page monograph on the Khazars which deals with Khazar origins, the spread of religions in Khazaria, the development of urban life and the political structure of the state closely based on the Arabo-Persian sources. It ably builds on the earlier scholarship and ofers some new perspectives as well. Returning to Russian and Soviet historiographical questions, we may note that nineteenth century European historians, as a whole, tended to take a largely negative view of the nomads and their political and cultural impact.75 Sergej Mixajlovič Solov’ëv (1820–1879) and Vasilij Osipovič Ključevskij (1841–1911), the doyens of Russian historical writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, viewed Russian history as a struggle of the Forest (i.e. the Slavs and ultimately Europe) against the Steppe (the nomads and ultimately Asia), with Rus’ standing as the guardian of Europe against the barbarians.76 Ključevskij, however, in his justly famous Kurs russkoj istorii and his Istorija soslovij v Rossii takes a more positive view of the Khazar Qağanate, clearly diferentiating it from the stateless nomads that followed them. He remarks that the “Khazar yoke,” a disputed and emotionally charged label in any event, “had a beneicial efect on the industrial (promyšlennye) successes of the Dnepr Slavs.” Having taken up “peaceful pursuits,” the Khazars opened up access for the Slavs to the Pontic and Caspian markets.77 A similar stance was taken by Myxajlo Hruševs’kyj (1866–1934), the founder of modern Ukrainian historical studies,78 who also took a more positive view of the Khazar Qağanate, considering it a “defensive wall” (zaborolo) of Eastern Europe against the hordes of Asia.”79 his view was shared

by the Russian medievalist Matvej Kuz’mič Ljubavskij (1860–1936), Klučevskij’s successor.80 In brief, the Khazars provided protective cover allowing for Slavic colonization and commercial access to the powerful southern economies of the Mediterranean Basin. his view was also typical of the Eurasianist school. he emigré scholar George Vernadsky [Georgij Vladimirovič Vernadskij, 1887–1973], in the 1930s, saw the Khazars as the “defenders of the trade routes in the Lower Volga” who by the early ninth century were extending their power to Kiev.81 his approach also found adherents in the new, Soviet-era scholarship. Jurij Vladimirovič Got’e (Gauthier, 1873–1943) in an article entitled “Khazar Culture” which appeared in 1925, presented the Khazars not so much as conquerors, but rather as uniiers, who followed a policy of tolerance producing a pax chazarica in the region.82 his benign view of the Khazars is held by a number of Russian and Ukrainian scholars today.83 Others, however, such as the distinguished Ukrainian medievalist, Academician Petro Petrovyč Toločko saw Rus’ as locked in “a constant struggle” with Khazaria.84 he nomads, including the Khazars, he considers a destructive force who ultimately “had a negative impact on the economic development of the border principalities.”85 Although the Khazars might be granted a more positive role by some, on the whole, the assessment of the role of the nomads in the history of the Eastern Slavs was negative and this was typical of many of the leading igures in Russian and Ukrainian history writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth century (igures such as N.I. Kostomarov, P.V. Golubovskij, N.Ja. Aristov, P.N. Miljukov, G.V. Plexanov and others),86 and

continued into the Soviet era (cf. the work of B.D. Grekov, V.T. Pašuto, V.V. Kargalov).87 In the early 1950s, domestic politics intervened, exacerbating even further the Khazar question in Soviet scholarship. A brief article in Pravda by a certain “Ivanov” in 1951 criticized as exaggerated the positive role that had been attributed to Khazaria in early Rus’ history by some scholars, in particular Mixail Ilarionovič Artamonov. Boris Aleksandrovič Rybakov, one of the commanding igures in Soviet Medieval Rus’ studies, now wrote several sharply negative articles on the role of the Khazars in Rus’ history, considerably downplaying their importance and relegating them to the position of a minor khanate. Indeed, the Khazars became almost taboo. his was largely in connection with political events in the Soviet Union revolving around the socalled “Doctors’ Plot” and the campaign against “Cosmopolitanism”88 with its thinly veiled anti-Semitism. In such an atmosphere and given the Judaic component of the Khazar question, Khazar studies, which were now almost exclusively in the hands of archaeologists led by Artamonov, sustained “a crushing blow,” as Svetlana A. Pletnëva recounted in an article that appeared in 1990. In a book that appeared in that same year, the late Anatolij Petrovič Novosel’cev (discussed below) wrote in much the same vein, remarking that Dunlop (see below) was able to publish his book (1954) before Artamonov “in large measure because of the situation which obtained in our historical science in the late 40s and early 50s.” By 1958, the atmosphere had changed to some degree.

views of Dmitrij I. Ilovajskij, a nineteenth century historian whose name could not be
invoked because of his “monarchist” political views. Shnirelman, he Myth, pp. 9–10,
however shows that Ilovajskij was so preoccupied with the “Normanist controversy,”
that the Khazars were, essentially, “beyond the scope of his interest.” Shnirelman, pp.
24–43, in his comments on the “Artamonov Afair,” provides a far more detailed analysis
of the twists and turns of Soviet historiography on this issue and on the question of
“Cosmopolitanism.”

his article on Sarkel89 that year, could write that “Khazaria was, at that time, a great state (bol’šim gosudarstvom) which included various tribes inhabiting the southern half of the European part of our country.” Pletnëva viewed this statement as signiicant, a signal that Khazar studies had not perished.90 Nonetheless, in his 1962 “History of the Khazars” (discussed below), Artamonov, while criticizing those who denied the historical importance of the Khazars, still, apparently, felt constrained to say that the Pravda article “had played a positive role drawing the attention of historians to the undoubted idealization of the Khazars in bourgeois scholarship and the exaggeration of their signiicance in the formation of the Rus’ state . . .” For good measure, Khazar religious tolerance was declared a “myth.”91 Despite the “thaw,” Novosel’cev notes that this “fundamental work” of Artamonov could, nonetheless, only be published in Leningrad by the publishing house of the Hermitage whose director Artamonov then was.92 he issue is by no means an historical relic and a lively debate over the nature and impact of Khazar-Rus’ interaction continues. Novosel’cev, agreeing with Hruševs’kyj and Ljubavskij that the Khazar presence allowed for Slavic expansion suggested that the Slavs of the 7th–8th centuries were the “natural allies of the Khazars.”93 Lev Nikolaevič Gumilëv took a very diferent tack. He embraced the Cumans, a Turkic tribal confederation hitherto considered the traditional bête noire of Russian history, as an autonomous yet integral part of Rus’, the two polities forming “a unitary Russo-Polovtsian system,” part of a common “polycentric state” with the Rus’.94 he Cumans’ previous role as villains was now

replaced by the Jews, Khazarian and others.95 Indeed, this anti-Khazar school of the Soviet era (associated with Rybakov and Gumilëv) reached such a fever pitch that, as Vladimir Ja. Petruxin has commented, Khazaria came to take on the “features of an almost metaphysical kingdom of evil, the bearer of a yoke more fearsome than that of the Tatars.”96 Petruxin was here responding to the remarks of V. Kožinov who wrote that “the Khazar yoke was, without doubt, much more dangerous for Rus’ than that of the Tatar-Mongols, in part because Rus’ was only a developing nation (narodnost’), state structure (gosudarstvennost’) and culture.” he struggle, he argued, however, only served to strengthen Rus’. Kožinov claimed that the Khazar problem remained a serious one for Rus’ into the reign of Jaroslav I (undisputed ruler 1036–1054), well ater the Rus’ destruction of the Khazar capital and core lands on the Lower Volga and Don region in 965–969.97 More recently, however, a post-Soviet study of Islam in the history of Russia by R.G. Landa, once again, underscores the importance of Khazaria in putting the Rus’ of the eighth-ninth century in contact with the Arabian Caliphate, one of the great centers of world culture. From the Khazars, he suggests, the Rus’ gained important experience in administering a polyethnic and multiconfessional state.98 he debate continues.
Modern Scholarship on the Khazars
With these necessary prefatory remarks, we can now turn to modern scholarship that deals with the totality of Khazar history and culture. Chronologically, we could say that modern Khazarology, in essence, begins with Mixail I. Artamonov’s 1936 study on the early history of the Khazars.99 But, this was really a warm up for his magnum opus, the
95 See his Drevnjaja Rus’ i Velikaja step’ in which a thinly veiled anti-semitism is a
consistent theme in his chapters dealing with the Pre-Činggisid era. his work (and
some others) are also marred by theories of ethnicity that are more in keeping with the
Rassengeschichte of Pre-World War II Central Europe than with modern scholarship.

Istoriija xazar the publication of which was delayed by World War II and the diicult political circumstances of Stalin’s last years, appearing inally in 1962. In that intervening period, however, Artamonov’s “History of the Khazars” was preceded by several substantial studies. Artamonov was aware of these works and was able to draw on and use their data and conclusions. he Israeli scholar A.N. Poliak, known for his studies on the Mamlûks and the Arab world, published an article (1942) on the Khazar conversion to Judaism, which is included and reworked in his monograph on Khazaria that appeared in 1942 and in revised versions in 1944 and 1951. hese remained largely unknown. Addressing a variety of issues, Poliak suggested that the Khazar state continued until the thirteenth century. He sought the origins of Eastern European Jewry in Khazaria and hypothesized that Yiddish stemmed from Crimean Gothic.100 he Polish Qaraite Turkologist Ananiasz Zajączkowski published his “Studies on the Khazar Problem” (Ze studiow nad zagadnieniem) in 1947, a reconstruction in part of his Bibliograia chazarska, which was destroyed in Warsaw in 1944. Its most important feature is its underscoring of the Turkic character of the Khazars, with some discussion of the Khazar linguistic fragments which he viewed as Qıpčaq in character. In this study and especially in other works, Zajączkowski attempted to demonstrate that the Qıpčaq Turkic-speaking Qaraim of Eastern Europe were the “heirs” of the Khazars.101 his view, not original with Zajączkowski, still has some adherents today, especially among some other East European Karaite scholars, but not exclusively limited to them. Indeed, its irst proponents were nineteenth century Christian scholars who were irst beginning to explore this small, Turkic-speaking, East European branch of what had been a larger, sectarian movement within the Mediterranean Jewish world.102

Of much greater signiicance was the book by the British scholar, Douglas Morton Dunlop, he History of the Jewish Khazars, which appeared in 1954. Dunlop’s book has remained one of the fundamental works on the Khazars and can be considered the true beginning of modern Khazar studies. It is a work of meticulous and fair-minded scholarship. It built, in part, on the materials that had been gathered by the German Semiticist Paul Kahle and the Belgian Byzantinist Henri Grégoire who had planned to collaborate on a book on the Khazars. World War II dashed those hopes and Kahle ofered the task to Dunlop who translated the most important Muslim accounts pertaining to the Khazars, gave an exhaustive analysis of the Khazar Hebrew correspondence and put together a coherent account of Khazar history, in particular of the ArabKhazar wars and relations with Byzantium and the Rus’. He was particularly interested in the chronology of the conversion, translating and analyzing all the Muslim and Hebrew sources on this subject. Dunlop also discussed the causes for the decline of the Khazar state concluding that the Khazar economy was “highly artiicial” and heavily “dependent on political prestige and military strength” by which it secured tribute and taxed the trade passing through its realm. When Khazar military might weakened, “the whole economy was liable to collapse.” Like many nomadic states “far from self-suicient,” this economic Achilles’ heel and the agglomerating nature of the Khazar state rendered it “incapable in the long run of forming a permanently stable political and economic unit.”103

khazar studies: achievements and perspectives 31
Artamonov considered Dunlop’s book “a major event in Khazar historiography,” summarizing all the available data that had been gathered over the previous hundred years. But, he criticized it for not opening up “new horizons.”104 In point of fact, Dunlop did have many new things to say.105 But this was always done in measured tones. Dunlop was, no doubt, cautious—and that was probably a good thing. here had been all sorts of speculation about the Khazars and Dunlop brought it down to earth. hose data that could be established on the basis of the literary sources were conirmed. A reasonable reconstruction of Khazar political history was established. he more serious of the various theories and hypotheses were analyzed. In short, a solid foundation was built for future work. he work has stood the test of time. In addition to these studies, Artamonov was also able to build on an already substantial tradition of Khazar scholarship in Russia and abroad.106 Artamonov, however, only noted in passing107 the work of the Ukrainian Orientalist Ahatanhel Juxymovyč Kryms’kyj [A.E. Krymskij, 1871–1942] whose “Prolegomena to the History of the Khazars” appeared in 1941. his study, which also dealt with the Khazar language, is a bibliographical rarity. I have never seen it and it is not noted in the two biographies of Kryms’kyj that appeared in 1971 and 1980. It was apparently part of a larger two volume work on the Khazars written in Ukrainian that remains in manuscript.108 Novosel’cev mentions Kryms’kyj’s interest in the Khazar language without citing any of his work.109 he publication of this study (Kryms’kyj was an outstanding scholar) or sections from it (it may be dated in some respects) would still be of value. Artamonov’s “History of the Khazars” was a sweeping survey of the history of the Western Eurasian steppes and owes something to the Eurasianist school in this regard.110 It was clear that the Khazars could

be properly understood only within this larger Eurasian context and Artamonov efectively brought this point home. In addition to a close reading of the literary sources, Artamonov, as the leader of the Don and Daghestanian archaeological expeditions in the territories of the Khazar state, brought to his work a wealth of knowledge of the archaeology of the region, an area largely neglected by most of his predecessors. His “History of the Khazars,” however, was much more oriented towards the written sources. Unfortunately, Artamonov was able to use these sources only in translations. He also turned to L.N. Gumilëv, a scholar oten given to sweeping, unsubstantiated generalizations and who was equally ignorant of Oriental languages, for advice on the history of the Türks.111 Artamonov concluded that many of the Turkic peoples of Western Eurasia were Turkicized Ugrians, a thesis for which we have no concrete evidence. Indeed, the history of the Hungarians, the best known of the Ugric peoples who came into close contact with the Turkic world, shows that although they were profoundly inluenced by Turkic culture and language, they remained Ugric in speech. Artamonov also connected the Khazar ruling house with the Ashina [A-shih-na] derived rulers of the Western Türks—a thesis that has been criticized by some (such as Novosel’cev)112 and given a more favorable reception by others (e.g. Golden).113 He correctly recognized the complex, polyethnic composition of the Khazar state which encompassed a number of diferent types of economy. He declared Khazaria the “irst feudal state” in Eastern Europe. Although there are many deinitions of feudalism, I am not at all certain that the Khazar state would it any of them. he presence of a paid standing army, most probably the ጱ (al-Ursiyya = the Ors), can hardly constitute feudalism. Rather, it has much more to do with the comitatus institution in Eurasian states, a potential embryo for feudalism. Following an already established theme, Artamonov saw a positive role for the Khazars in Rus’ history, serving as a shield against the onslaughts of other Eurasian nomads. Khazaria’s wars with the expanding Umayyad Caliphate also contributed to the survival of Byzantium

and led to an alliance of the latter with the Khazars. Like Dunlop, he saw the Khazars as checking the Arab advance into Eastern Europe. Artamonov dated the beginnings of the Khazar conversion to Judaism to the 730s. In the early ninth century, the “king” or Qağan-Beg, Obadiyah, he conjectured, seized power, forced the government and Qağan to accept Judaism as the state religion and thus touched of a civil war and sacralized the Qağanal line, creating the Khazar dual kingship. he Hungarians and Oğuz were brought in by competing factions of the Khazar elite. he triumphant Judaizers then persecuted the Christian and Muslim communities.114 his hypothetical reconstruction is based on Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s notice on the Qabars who joined the Hungarian union ater having been defeated in a civil war in Khazaria and on the comment in King Joseph’s letter that one of his ancestors, Obadiyah, a successor of Bulan to whom the conversion is attributed, “renewed the kingdom and strengthened the faith, . . . built synagogues and schools of learning and gathered the wise men of Israel”115 his thesis was followed and further developed by Pletnëva116 and has inluenced the work of Pritsak and others.117 he whole of this ediice rests on nothing more than a conjecture.118 We do not know when Obadiyah lived nor the precise nature of his reforms. Constantine says nothing about the date of the Qabar revolt—although it clearly appears to have taken place before the Hungarian migration to Pannonia. We do not know if the Qabars were Judaized or not. If the recent inds at Čelarevo (in Yugoslavia) are, indeed, Qabar, then there is evidence that they may have practiced Judaism.119 One does not have to seek religion-based strife for the origins of dual kingships and sacral monarchies. hey are found throughout Eurasia.

the once pagan Qağanal line it in with a program of Jewish reform? Although there were individual incidents in which Khazar rulers in the tenth century repressed speciic groupings of Muslims and Christians, in retaliation for persecutions of Jews in the Islamic lands and Byzantium, the Muslim sources report that the Khazar government provided judicial institutions for each of the confessional communities, Jewish, Christian and Muslim and even a judge for the pagans.120 Regrettably, we know relatively little about the internal dynamics of religion and state in Khazaria. We need to know a lot more before such conjectures can be elevated to the status of established fact. Artamonov concluded his work on an unfortunate note. Ater noting the Khazars’ positive contributions, the pax chazarica, he concluded that the adoption of the Jewish religion was “a fatal step.” It severed the government from the people, replaced pastoral nomadism and agriculture with mercantile middlemen and led to the “parasitic enrichment of the ruling elite” whose power rested on the hired lances of their Muslim guard. “Talmudic learning did not afect the masses, remaining the privilege of a few. From that time, the role of the Khazar Qağanate became sharply negative . . .” He ended by saying that “all the wealth gathered by the Judaic merchants in Itil could not buy the hearts of the Slavs who were settling the forest-steppelands, the Black Sea steppe peoples—the Pečenegs, the nomads of the trans-Uralian plain—the Oğuz, the Alans who occupied the mountain ravines of the Middle Caucasus and the Bulğars who inhabited the Azov shores.” In short, Judaism, according to Artamonov, destroyed Khazaria.121 None of this is supported by documentation or scholarly argument. he adoption of one or another of the universal, monotheistic faiths is an important theme in the history of the various peoples of Eurasia. In some instances, conversion initially caused considerable internal strife, but nowhere did it bring about the decline and fall of the polity. Oten, the reverse was true. In no other instance, in the modern scholarship on the peoples of Eurasia,122 do we ind the claim made that conversion

from paganism to a monotheistic faith was the cause of the state’s collapse. he development among other Turkic peoples of similar religious and intellectual institutions, including a scholarly class, the functional equivalent of the rabbinate (e.g. the Islamic ‘ulamâ’), did not cut of the rulers from ruled nor lead to the loss of martial vigor or produce societal collapse. Khazaria’s immediate neighbor, Volga Bulğaria, is an example of conversion (in this case Islam) and the establishment of a full range of Islamic religious and religio-intellectual institutions. Volga Bulğaria thrived until it was subsumed by the tide of Činggisid Mongol conquests. he weaknesses of Khazaria were typical of aging nomadic states that were facing vigorous newcomers (in this instance the Pečenegs and the Rus’) and the growing enmity of powerful sedentary neighbor states, in Khazaria’s case, its onetime “partner” Byzantium. A decline in revenue resulting from shits in or the emergence of new trade patterns may have also played a role. Artamonov’s thesis is not based on facts and its anti-Semitic undertones sadly mar a work that otherwise has many important merits. L.N. Gumilëv’s sometimes fanciful work aimed at a popular audience, the “Discovery of Khazaria,” appeared in 1966. It presented the results of archaeological ield expeditions in the Don, Volga delta and North Caucasus. Although positive results were achieved in the Don and North Caucasus, Gumilëv concluded that the Khazar capital, Itil, in the Volga delta had been submerged due to hydrological changes.123 In 1967, Svetlana Aleksandrovna Pletnëva, a student of Artamonov, published her “From Nomad Camps to Towns,” dealing with the transition of nomadic peoples in the Pontic-Caspian steppes from nomadism to semi-sedentary or sedentary life during the Khazar era, largely based on archaeological materials.124 Pletnëva distinguishes between three diferent forms or stages of nomadism ranging from: 1) year-round almost nonstop nomadizing (tabornoe kočevanie), 2) nomadism with permanent winter quarters in which the population migrates during the Spring until the Fall and 3) a nomadic system in which one part of the populaces nomadizes while the other has sedentarized. Her analysis of the Saltovo-Majaki culture, which is associated with one part of the Khazar realm, shows the movement of this population through all three stages. She concluded that the Arabo-Khazar wars had a negative

impact on the nomads forcing many who had lost their herds to sedentarize. We have no evidence to support this contention. he Khazar dual kingship she saw, at this time, as stemming from the confederational nature of the Khazar union and the belief in the divine power of the Qağan which resulted in his tabooization. he power of the “king” grew gradually and the shit in de facto power to the “king,” who was a “feudal lord,” occurred peacefully. he third phase which entailed the denomadization of substantial elements of the population produced the feudalization of the state. he whole question of “steppe feudalism” remains very murky, at best, and the evidence, beyond conjecture, to buttress these arguments is not presented. Nevertheless, this is a very signiicant work with much to say for the study of some of the Western Eurasian steppe polities. In particular, it may really have more to do with the Alans and Pontic Bulğars who were under Khazar rule than with the Khazars themselves. In 1976 Pletnëva published a brief, popular work, “he Khazars” which was reprinted with some changes in 1986. In it, she further developed Artamonov’s thesis about Obadiyah and the negative impact of the conversion to Judaism, which separated the (in her presentation) small clique of Judaized Khazars, the Qağan and the Itil aristocracy, from the rest of Khazar society and weakened an already shaky state foundation. he ensuing civil war, between the Judaized Itil aristocracy and the nonJewish provincial aristocracy (which included Christians and Muslims) produced a “Khazar fronde.” he civil war, she concluded, greatly weakened the Khazar state.125 Again, this all rests on conjectures and arbitrary assumptions. Some of her conclusions may have been driven by political pressures.126 An attempt at summarizing and synthesizing the materials on the Khazars, closely following the work of Soviet scholars was made by the Polish scholar Teresa Nagrodzka-Majchrzyk in her “Chazarowie,” a small monograph contained in a larger work, published in 1975 that dealt with the European Huns, Proto-Bulğars and Pečenegs as well. In keeping with the format of the larger work, there are interesting and useful sections devoted to what little we know of social and economic

matters in Khazaria, health and hygiene, the martial arts, daily life, living conditions etc. Uncritically following Artamonov’s lead, however, she also saw in Judaization the “germ of the fall of the Khazar state.”127 Of some interest to Khazar studies was the jointly authored work of Jakov Aleksandrovič Fëdorov and Gadži Saidovič Fëdorov dealing with the “Early Turks in the North Caucasus” which appeared in 1978.128 It placed, quite correctly, the development of a Turkic core in the North Caucasus to Khazar times deriving from tribes that had been coming to the region since the Hunnic invasions. It also sought there the origins, at least in part, of the Kumyks (deriving them also from local, Caucasian elements) and the Qaračay-Balqars (the latter stemming rather from Qıpčaqicized Alanic elements).129 hese issues are by no means resolved and the question of the Khazar legacy among the Turkic-speaking peoples of the North Caucasus requires much more work. In 1978 there also appeared Omeljan Pritsak’s article on the Khazar conversion to Judaism.130 Here he briely set forth his views on Khazar origins, promising to deal with the problem in depth in later volumes of his Origin of Rus’. He, too, traced the origins of the Khazar qağanal house to the Ashina West Türk ruling clan, but put forward the theory that they took over the territory of the earlier Akatzirs from whom he derives the ethnonym Khazar. he future “kingly,” i.e. non-qağanal clan of the Barč/Warâz/Bolčân, the Ixšâd/Beg/Yillig [Yilig/Yelig] line of the Muslim sources, according to him, as well as the Qabars and others also came from the West Türk state. Sometime between 799–833, he suggests, the Beg had become the efective co-ruler of the state. During that same period, the Beg converted to Judaism (as noted by al-Mas‘ûdî) and in the atermath of the Qabar revolt/civil war (probably between 833–843), the Qağan lost all efective power and the institution of the Qağanate

was Judaized as well. Subsequently, in later articles, Pritsak advanced the theory that the Rus’ Qağanate stemmed from the Khazar Qağan who was “forced . . . to emigrate” in the 830s due to “religious controversy,” the attempt of the Barč/Warâz/Bolčân (whom he now termed an Iranian mercantile clan) to convert him to Judaism.131 In Pritsak’s view, the Jewish international merchant company, the Râdâniyya, played an important role in the conversion. he conversion itself must be viewed within the wider context of the conversions of “Eurasian warrior steppe societies” to the monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean basin. Except for the last point, much of this remains highly conjectural. Merchants who brought religions, alphabets and other cultural artifacts along with their trading goods, certainly played a role in the movement of the monotheistic faiths of the Mediterranean basin into the Eurasian steppe. hey may well have played such a role here. But, we have no direct evidence that they did so. he conversion tales preserved in Khazaro-Hebrew and Muslim sources make no mention of them. Aleksandr Vil’jamovič Gadlo’s two studies of the ethnic history of the North Caucasus from the fourth to the thirteenth century, the irst of which appeared in 1979 and the second in 1994 have much to say about the Khazars, although, strictly speaking they are devoted to broader themes.132 here are a number of new suggestions regarding various points of Khazar history and historical geography. For example, he puts forward the notion that Samandar (which is probably to be identiied with Tarki) was not really a Khazar capital city, but merely the staging point for raids into Transcaucasia.133 In overall approach, however, his work does not signiicantly difer from the outline of Khazar history given by Artamonov, but attempts to trace the various ethnic processes taking place in the North Caucasus during this period. his is an important theme. With regard to the Khazar state itself, he concludes that it was “a patch-work” empire which provided the basis for the subsequent economic and ethnic integration of the mountain and steppe regions. he 1980s, following the growing pace of publications on Khazar themes, marks a period of elorescence in Khazar studies.

author of these lines published his Khazar Studies, an outgrowth of his doctoral dissertation (1970). his work was revised and essentially completed in 1972, but was delayed in publication. My remarks here will be brief and general as I must leave to others an assessment of my work. Ater giving an outline of Khazar history and society, I largely concentrated on the fragments of the Khazar language scattered in a variety of sources. he volume of text was accompanied by a volume of facsimiles taken from the various manuscripts in which Khazar words are found. It is clear from this data that the Khazars were Turkic and that their titulature and governmental structure closely paralleled that of the Türk Qağanate which I, like many others, view as their progenitors. he absence of texts, as opposed to scattered names, titles and toponyms, in Khazar precluded any closer identiication with one or another Turkic linguistic subgrouping. While a number of scholars are convinced that their language was Oğuric or “Hunnic,” as we have seen, I concluded that with the possible exception of the toponym Sarkel/*Šarkil, the linguistic material is largely neutral. Analysis is further complicated by the fact that the Khazar realm contained a variety of Turkic peoples (not to mention others), both Oğuric and those speaking Common Turkic. Sources could call “Khazar” virtually any language spoken in the region.134 In 1983, I published an article dealing with Khazaria and Judaism which briely took up the question of Jewish proselytizing, pointing to eras and regions in which Judaism had been more activist in this regard and suggesting that a frontier zone, such as Khazaria, was a region in which Jews could and did proselytize without fear of harsh punishment that such activity would have produced in Christian or Muslim lands. I also criticized the Artamonov-Pletnëva theory, which sought to present as established fact that the Khazar dual kingship resulted from Judaization. I showed, rather, that the institution of the dual kingship with a sacral king was a phenomenon known to many societies and had nothing to do with the adoption of monotheistic faiths of any type.135 hese themes, in particular, the Khazar dual kingship, were again addressed in a 1993 article dealing with the political authority of the Khazar rulers and an article that appeared in 2006 devoted to the Khazar sacral kingship.136

he long-awaited joint work of Norman Golb and Omeljan Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century appeared in 1982.137 Golb adduced further, strong evidence for the authenticity of the Khazar correspondence. He presented a revised and improved edition of the “Letter of an Anonymous Khazar Jew” (the “Schechter Letter”) stemming from the Cairo Geniza. He also published a letter which he viewed as coming from the Khazar Jewish community in Kiev dating from the early tenth century that he had uncovered in the Cambridge Geniza collection in 1962. Golb demonstrated that these Khazar Jews were Rabbinical rather than Qaraite in orientation and that they had already internalized their adopted faith, creating the myth of their “return” to Judaism. He further suggested that those in the document bearing the name Kôhên may have been descended from Khazar shamans (qams) who had adopted Judaism while retaining their priestly status in an acceptable Jewish form in a process he termed “sacerdotal metamorphosis.” he document, moreover, bore the names of the signatories, a number of which were clearly non-Jewish, pointing to their probable proselytic origins. In addition, the document had an inscription in one of the runiform Turkic scripts that were widely spread across Eurasia.138 For Khazar studies, this was an extraordinary event. Pritsak undertook the decipherment of this unique linguistic material (the runiform inscription and non-Semitic names) and concluded that the Khazars spoke an Oğuric tongue. Pritsak also put forward the theory that the toponym Kiev is to be derived from the family name of the Khazar Khwârazmian wazîrial line of the Kûyas and also posited a new chronology for the evolution of the Rus’ state. Needless to say, a work this rich in new and oten provocative ideas and conjectures brought forth a variety of critical responses.139 he claim that the non-Hebrew names

were Turkic was challenged,140 the reading of the runiform inscription was declared “arbitrary.”141 Indeed, the question of whether the letter actually originated from the Kievan Khazaro-Jewish community or was addressed to that community has been raised (see the summation of these critical comments in Erdal’s contribution to this volume). Whatever the criticisms, it remains a major work in the ield. In that same year (1982), the doctoral dissertation of Dieter Ludwig appeared which focused on the social and economic structure of the Khazar state.142 his is a meticulous study of the available literary sources (consulted in the original languages) and all of the previous literature with many new interpretations of or reinements in particular points of Khazar history, geography and social organization. Ludwig found some additional candidates for Golden’s “Khazar Word-list”143 and brought a new perspective on Khazar origins. He concluded that the Khazars are irst reliably attested in the region near Khurâsân (i.e. the eastern lands of Iran) and conjectured that they were part of the Hephthalite tribal union. For some “unknown reasons” they migrated at the turn of the late ith-early sixth century to the “Kaukasus-Vorland” where they found an already long-settled Alanic and Bulğaric population. At approximately the same time, or slightly earlier, the Sabirs had made their way to this region and were now presumably joined to the Khazar union. At irst the Sabirs were the dominant element, but later the Khazars, as the result of some unspeciied “crisis” took over the leadership. he collapse of the Hephthalite state, most certainly (“mit Sicherheit”) before 567, brought about another westward migration of Bulğars and Khazars, the latter now appearing in Northern Daghestan. While many Khazars went further westward, a substantial grouping remained now under West Türk rule. hese Türk/Khazars are the ones who formed an alliance with Heraclius, ca. 626, and warred against Iran.144

Many (if not all) of these notices, however, are problematic and very likely anachronistic. here were, undoubtedly, Turkic nomads on the eastern and northern borders of Sâsânid Iran. Some of them, undoubtedly, were driven westward by the Sâsânid campaigns and the bufetings brought about in the steppe by the collapse of the Rouran (Jou-jan) and then Hepthalite states. Nonetheless, we have no solid evidence to connect the Khazars with the Hephthalites. Ludwig’s erudite reconstruction of Khazar ethnogenesis, as many of the others, remains highly conjectural. During the 1970s, homas S. Noonan (1938–2001) began to publish a number of insightful articles dealing with the economic history of Eastern Europe based on the numismatic and archaeological evidence. His interest in the low of dirhams to Rus’ inevitably led him to Khazar questions and this was relected in a series of studies that dealt with aspects of the Khazar economy that appeared in the 1980’s. Noonan always asked important questions and had new and stimulating answers. hus, in his 1982 article on the question of a Khazar monetary economy, ater an exhaustive examination of the data, he answered in the negative, despite an “initial predisposition to believe that the Khazars possessed a monetary or at least semi-monetary economy.”145 In that same year and journal, he sought to uncover the paths by which Sâsânid and Byzantine goods dating from ca. 500–650 made their way to the Middle Kama. He concluded that there were no direct relations, but rather that the Steppe peoples, in particular the early Khazars through their involvement in Heraclius’ wars with the Sâsânids in Transcaucasia brought both Byzantine and Sâsânid goods to the Volga zone. From Khazaria, goods made their way northward, the Khazars using them to purchase furs.146 Following up on this in an article on what the numismatic evidence tells us about ninth century Khazaria, Noonan, while still remaining an agnostic with regard to whether the Khazars actually minted their own coins, concluded that the bulk of Khazaria’s exports came from the fur-rich lands of the North, from Volga Bulğaria and Rus’ and it was thither that Arab dirhams tended to low in the ninth and tenth centuries.

of the coins went there, he notes, then “historical numismatics raises some fundamental questions about Khazar commerce and the Khazar economy in the ninth century.”147 Since the time of Noonan’s early publication, the evidence for Khazar coinage, or rather Khazar imitations of Arabic coins, has increased. his has occasioned a revision of Noonan’s work by his student and collaborator, Roman K. Kovalev who has made important contributions in this ield (see below).148 Khazar trade with the Islamic world, Noonan argued in a 1984 article, began only ater the end of the Arab-Khazar wars. By 800, as more peaceful conditions developed, Muslim merchants made their way to Khazaria, bringing back furs, slaves and the products of the northern forests. his conirmed the shit of the Khazar capital to the now all important Volga and made the Khazar economy “increasingly dependent upon the revenues of this trade, the Khazars began to create a tributary empire in the forest steppe and forest zones . . .” Ultimately, this attracted the Vikings as well, leading to the founding of the Rus’ state.149 Rus’ merchants, he demonstrated, in another study, were coming to Khazaria as early as the 820’s.150 Yet another study traced changes in the dirham low (ca. 870–900) and trade patterns as Khazaria showed signs of weakening and the Pečenegs became dangerous opponents in the Pontic steppes.151 In an important and provocative study on Khazar-Byzantine relations, Noonan argued that Byzantine attempts to use religion or trade as tools of policy to manipulate the behavior of the steppe nomads were largely unsuccessful. Rather, it was the familiar “divide and conquer” approach that proved most productive from Constantinople’s viewpoint. Byzantine trade with Khazaria was “insigniicant.” he Khazars, he suggests,

viewed the Byzantines as “of secondary, and at times, peripheral importance.” hose few instances of close contact (e.g. the 732/3 marital alliance or the building of Sarkel (now dated to 840–841) were largely of symbolic value and—in the case of Sarkel—ultimately of little use. By the tenth century relations had become clearly hostile.152 A review of the numismatic and literary evidence, carried out in 1992, indicated that the hold of the Râdâniyya on the northern route through Khazaria may well have been disrupted by the late eighth-early ninth century “and perhaps even replaced” by the Rus’-Khazar-Islamic world trade axis. By the early tenth century, there appears to have been a shit of caravan routes, with the Volga Bulğar-Sâmânid Central Asian trade coming to the fore. Volga Bulğaria now emerged “as a center potentially rivalling the Khazars.” By the 940’s, Noonan suggests, the Volga Bulğars were independent of Khazaria and this may well have been connected to their new prominence in trade.153 his certainly must be taken into consideration in any discussion of the Islamization of the Volga Bulğars and the immediate causes for the fall of the Khazar state. Most recently (1997), Noonan published an important synthesizing article in which he brought together a great deal of material pertaining to the Khazar economy, examining areas such as agriculture, viniculture and gardening, stock raising, hunting, ishing, crats production, pottery, metal working, jewelry making, leather working etc. he written sources, he notes, have relatively little to say about Khazar pastoral nomadism which may have been preserved as a way of life largely by the elite, and much more to say about Khazar agriculture. Interestingly enough, the archaeological data does not provide much evidence for the latter than might have been expected. Nonetheless, he concludes that when viewed in toto there can be little doubt that agriculture, viniculture and related activities were well-developed in Khazaria. he data for crat production is quite considerable. Khazaria was self-suicient with regard to ceramic ware of daily use. here was some production of weapons. Khazaria was a major market for jewelry and other luxury goods, importing some of these and producing signiicant quantities of their own, largely coming from the Saltovo workshops. Noonan suggests that it was Khazaria’s strong, centralized government that allowed it to

expand and incorporate non-steppe zones. his laid the foundation for the “economic diversity” that made it relatively long-lived for a steppe state. he question that remains, as Noonan notes, is: were these areas of strong agricultural and crats production the result of the sedentarization of the nomads and their going over to these pursuits or did they result from population shits that brought peoples with these skills to areas such as the Saltovo-Majackaja culture?154 His inal words on these important questions appear in this volume. In 1983, yet another dissertation, that of the Daghestanian archaeologist, Murad Gadžievič Magomedov, dealt with the question of Khazar origins. Based on archaeological ieldwork done in Daghestan in the late 1960s in sites which show an interesting mix of nomadic and local cultures, he derived Khazar beginnings from the mélange of nomadic peoples that came to the North Caucasus, in particular the Sabir-Oğur groupings, the Khazar state forming under the aegis of the Western Türks with whom they mixed.155 He, too, proclaimed it the “irst feudal state formation in Eastern Europe” and noted, without further details, that it “let a deep trace on the pages of world history.” He criticized Artamonov for not making suicient use of the archaeological material to present a fuller picture of the Khazars and attacked Dunlop for “ungrounded attempts to demonstrate the Judaic origin of the Khazars.”156 his is nonsense and indicates little comprehension of what Dunlop’s book is about. Moreover, Artamonov can hardly be accused of ignoring archaeological data. Similarly, comments about a Khazar return to Daghestan ater the fall of the Khazar state are based on a misunderstanding of the texts (e.g. Plano Carpini).157 What evidence is there that the Khazars did not maintain a presence in the region throughout this period? On a more positive note, he connects the Khazar urban center at Balanjar with the site of the Verxnečirjurtovskoe gorodišče on the Sulak River and provides a necessary corrective to Gumilëv’s Volga-centered claims that Khazaria was a “steppe Atlantis.” Daghestan was also an important territory and it has not disappeared.

On a smaller scale, but sharply focused, is the work of Vladimir Kuz’mič Mixeev who in 1985 published a book dealing with the semisedentarized and sedentarized Alanic, Ugric and Bulğaric population of the Don region in Khazar times (eighth-tenth century). He provides a thorough analysis of the material pertaining to agriculture in the region which was of the dry farming variety, typical of semi-nomads. Mixeev argues for the ongoing sedentarization of the nomads. Indeed, he sees nomadic statehood as developing out of the conquest of sedentary lands and the sedentarization of the nomads themselves, a policy actively pursued, he argues, by the government. he extension of Khazar power to the Don region strengthened this process. he Pečeneg invasions of the late ninth century drove some of the sedentary populations to seek the relative safety of the forest-steppe zone. hose who remained were brought into the Pečeneg union and re-nomadized. he loss of these agricultural lands contributed to the Khazar decline.158 Mixeev raises some very interesting points which may be interpreted in diferent ways. Sedentarization is not always inal. Formerly nomadic peoples can and do re-nomadize. Nomadic statehood is most oten tied to the control over certain sedentary territories. he closer the tie with the latter, the greater the impetus to sedentarize otherwise undisciplined (from a government’s perspective) populations. here is much rich comparative material pertaining to other steppe societies that the author does not take into consideration. Nonetheless, this is a valuable and thoughtful study. One of the last of the major general works about the Khazars came from Anatolij Petrovič Novosel’cev in 1990.159 his is a rich and nuanced work of synthesis which makes ample use of the already existing literature and is based on a irst-hand acquaintance with the sources, rather than translations. It is also one with new perspectives. Ater a thorough historiographical review and discussion of the sources, Novosel’cev takes up the still unresolved question of Khazar origins, state formation, the contours of the state, its economy, urban life, state structure, religion and only in the last chapter touches on relations with Eastern Europe and the Rus’ state. He sees a fusion of ancient Iranian elements, Ugrians and Turks, with the Sabirs playing the most important role, as forming the ethnic groupings from which the Khazars derived. He views the Sabirs as ultimately Finno-Ugrians who had become Turkicized and

were eventually brought under the sway of the Western Türks. He contends that an independent Khazar state had already come into existence by the irst quarter of the seventh century, before the collapse of the Western Türk state, the Khazar ruler assuming the qağanal dignity ca. 630–650.160 He holds to the view that there were two campaigns by Svjatoslav against Khazaria. he irst in 965 in which Sarkel/Bela Veža was taken and very likely a second in 968–9,161 sandwiched in between Svjatoslav’s Danubian ventures. In both of these campaigns, he was joined by the Oğuz (in the earlier one), who attacked the Khazars from the East and by the Rus’ (from the West). Svjatoslav aimed, he believes, at securing the Volga and Danubian trading routes. Khazar fragments survived and were later swept away by the Qıpčaqs.162 Linguistically, the Khazars spoke, in his view, a form of Bulğaric. hroughout the work, Novosel’cev adopts a critical but temperate tone. He takes frequent exception to the thesis that the Khazars “saved Eastern Europe from Islam.” he Khazars, he points out, did not defeat the Arabs but were defeated in 737 and the Qağan was forced to embrace Islam. Hence, they cannot be compared to the Franks. Moreover, the Arabs, he argues, had no intention of advancing this deep beyond the Caucasus.163 Novosel’cev is certainly correct that the Khazars were defeated in 737, but the Umayyad victory was leeting. Marwân had been lucky in 737 and Arab forces would not again tempt the Fates here. Warfare beyond the Caucasus, into the perilous steppes, was costly and uncertain. An important part of that uncertainty was Khazar military might. True, the Khazars did not deliver a knockout blow. But, their resistance and destructive invasions of Umayyad holdings in Transcaucasia combined with the ‘Abbâsid revolution in 750 which produced new orientations in caliphal policies, brought an end to Arab advances here. Functionally, the Khazars, it may be argued, played a role very similar to that of the Franks. Most recently (2000–2005), Sergej Alekseevič Romašov has published a long overdue historical geography of Khazaria (based on his 1992 Candidate dissertation).164 It brings together the scattered, occasionally

contradictory testimony of the written sources (which the author has read in the original languages) regarding the physical contours of the Khazar realm, its regions and urban centers. It also contains a useful introduction to the sources and Khazar historiography, a good outline of Khazar history and well-grounded attempts, combining the literary and archaeological data, to clarify a number of contentious issues relating to the contours of this large empire. Romašov does not consider the Rus’ conquest of the 960s to have been conclusive. Rather, he argues, Khazaria became a shaken, “down-graded state” which ceased to be of interest to contemporary geographers and historians. As a consequence, there is, he argues, little data on it in this later period. Khazaria or at least elements that are identiied as Khazar, in his view (and others), lived on into the era of the Mongol conquest. Khazar remnants on the basis of toponymy can be traced in Hungary, Transylvania and Bessarabia.165 he works of Novosel’cev and Romašov mark an elegant summation of what we can do with the Khazar problem on the basis of the written sources known to us thus far. Some of the most recent work has turned, where it inevitably must, to archaeology. In 1989, the Hungarian archaeologist Csánad Bálint who had earlier published some archaeological addenda to Golden’s Khazar Studies,166 brought out a very useful survey of the archaeological material from the Western Eurasian steppes which has much to say about the Khazarcontrolled lands.167 In 1990, Pletnëva, now the doyenne of Khazar archaeology and indeed of that of the whole of the Western Eurasian steppe, published an important and candid article on the state of Khazar archaeological studies in the former Soviet Union—to which we have already alluded. Here she summed up the hardships and achievements (quite considerable) of her colleagues and students, as well as her own work, since the time of Artamonov’s early researches, in particular the extensive studies of the Saltovo-Majacki complex culture. he recent work in the Dnepr, Middle Donec, Lower Don, Crimea, Caspian—Volga, Azov zones and

Daghestan are all summarized and evaluated. In virtually all areas, she reports that much material remains unpublished. Archaeological works are published only ater some considerable delays and oten not enthusiastically by the publishers. Although there are now several generations of scholars working on Khazar-era sites, there is some lack of scholarly communication (naučnaja razobščënnost’), a preoccupation with methodological questions on the part of some and too much timidity in adopting new methodologies on the part of others, an unwillingness to draw broad conclusions, and a retreat to simple, descriptive rather than broadly analytical works. he same criticism, we should note, may be levelled at other disciplines as well and are hardly unique to Russia. here are also some interesting indings in her summation. She notes, among other things, that it now appears that the Khazars were the most nomadic part of the population of Khazaria. hey were also richer and most probably higher up in the socio-political hierarchy. Pletnëva also cautiously suggests that the vanished Itil may have been covered over by some present-day large city (perhaps Volgograd/Carycin). Itil has yet to be found. Among Pletnëva’s most recent works we may note her masterful summation of the Sarkel material showing that in the years ater its construction, it was not only a fort but also became an important link in Khazar commerce. It was part of the famous “Silk Route.” Ater its conquest by the Rus’ in 965, Sarkel eventually resumed its role as a trade city.168 Further work along these lines is now being published by Roman K. Kovalev demonstrating the integration of this zone into the Silk Road.169 In 1999, Pletnëva published what we may consider her magnum opus in the ield of Khazar studies. he “Sketches of Khazar Archaeology”170 is a detailed overview of the work of Russian and Soviet archaeologists on Khazarian inds. It devotes much attention to materials from lands under Khazar control, but has only one chapter dealing with the Khazar core territories (North Caucasian-Volgo-Caspian steppes). In her opening remarks Pletnëva cautions that “this work is not actually about the Khazars and it is not about the culture created by them.” In fact,

the identiication of actual Khazar sites, she notes, is still problematic and open to question. In her concluding remarks she writes that she has attempted to “present the at times very sparse, and hence debatable (spornye), archaeological facts which bear witness to the existence of the Khazar kaganate.” All that can be done, at this stage, is to discuss the cultures of the various ethnic groups (especially the Alans and the BulğaroOğuric Turks) that constituted the Khazar realm. As a consequence, the principal focus of the study is the Saltovo-Majaki culture and its expansion within Khazar-dominated lands. he variety of the cultures associated with these diferent groupings, however, “gives some grounds for doubt regarding the existence of a unitary state culture and hence of the existence of the state itself under whose auspices it developed.”171 Pletnëva here seems to be almost denying the existence of the Khazar polity as a state. In her conclusion, however, Pletnëva avers that the “unity of the culture of everyday life in all the areas of the early and developed periods of the life of the kaganate can be considered proven.” his unity was premised, she adds, on the political unity achieved by the Khazar state. Also demonstrated, in her view, is the basically sedentary nature of the population of the Khazar state whose economy was largely agricultural—although in some regions seasonal nomadism was still practiced.172 With regard to the Khazar spiritual world, she remarks that funerary practices throughout Khazaria display “profound pagan concepts which penetrated the whole of Khazar society regardless of the ethnic ailiations of the population carrying out the burial (or) the place of their residence, i.e. in the central districts or on the furthest frontier regions of this vast state.” Pletnëva’s “Sketches” are rich in descriptive detail, providing full accounts of the various investigated archaeological complexes, but ofers generalizations that would be of immediate use to the historian only in her concluding remarks. In part, this caution is no doubt due to the fact that Khazar archaeological studies are still, in efect, a work in progress. Many sites, including those in the core Khazar territory, have not yet been fully studied. Of those that have been examined, not all the studies have been published.173 his is, of course, a great pity, for it is in the core Khazar lands that answers may, perhaps, be found for some of the fun

damental questions scholarship still has regarding the Khazars. Among the most interesting prospects is the work being carried out in the Lower Volga delta, near the village of Samosdelka in Astrakhan’ oblast’. But the conditions of research are diicult and, as Pletnëva notes, Itil remains elusive.174 he study of the spiritual world of the peoples of Khazaria, touched on above, is also still very much in its infancy. In 1995, Richard A.E. Mason published an article in which he attempted to reconstruct the Khazar religious system, largely on the basis of the written sources.175 Although he does not go much beyond much of the previously published work, the latter was oten presented in an unsystematic fashion, while dealing with other issues. Mason has focused exclusively on this important topic and has tried to place it in the Türk and larger Eurasian context. Following Pritsak in many areas, he drew parallels with IndoEuropean practices and beliefs. He further suggested that the mix of peoples in Khazaria contributed to “a blossoming of both material and spiritual culture among the Khazars. It has also formed the basis for the remarkable symbiosis of varying systems of religious belief and practice which held sway and formed so unique a characteristic of the Khazar state . . .”176 We have no clear idea as to whether there was, indeed, a blossoming of “spiritual culture” in Khazaria. However, it seems more than likely that various types of religious symbiosis and syncretism took place. Much more data is still needed. A new area has been opened with the book of Valentina Evgen’evna Flërova, a specialist on the graiti and other scattered marks, drawings and carvings on objects stemming from Khazaria and the Bulğar lands. hese pose very considerable problems of analysis. hey do not appear to be alphabetic writing. Some are almost certainly tamğas of various types. Others may have had religious-magical signiicance and Flërova believes that from them the spiritual world of the Saltovo-Majackaja culture can be reconstructed.177 Pletnëva, building on this, and on the traces of the spiritual culture of the peoples of Khazaria (depictions of men dancing naked, wearing masks and carrying spears, the use of a

variety of talismans, worship of oak trees, totemism etc.) underscores the paramountcy of paganism within the Qağanate.178 Related to the studies of Flërova is the work of Igor’ Leonidovič Kyzlasov on the runic script systems of the Eurasian steppes. In his survey of this very complicated material, he devotes some attention to the runiform scripts found on Khazar territory. We have previously noted his views on the runic inscription on the Kiev letter. He also points out that the script systems dating to the late eighth-tenth century from the Don-Kuban region show the greatest similarities with the South Yenisei scripts. From this he posits a Don-Kuban-South Yenisei script complex. he diferences between this complex and the Orxon-Yenisei-Talas are too great to be explained by orthographic changes as the script moved from one group to another. 179 his is really one of the new frontiers for Khazar studies. Pletnëva, who touches on this question in her “Sketches,” shows no hesitation in identifying the Don script with Khazar and the Kuban script with Bulğaro-Oğuric.180 he case has yet to be made. So, where do we stand? What do we know that is not based on speculation, preconceived notions or wishful thinking? Some major questions remain. First and foremost is the still not fully answered question of Khazar origins.
The Question of Khazar Origins
A number of hypotheses regarding the origins of the Khazars have been put forward:
1) hey derive from the or /Acatziri/Agaziri a ith century Hunnic people mentioned by Priscus, Jordanes and the Ravenna Anonymous,181 presumably a rendering of the name *Aq Qazar (there are considerable philological problems here).

2) hey originated from a tribal union formed of Oğuric tribes, the Sabirs and Türks, with the ruling strata deriving from the Western Türk state,182 in some way analogous to the position of the Činggisid ruling elements in the Golden Horde. 3) hey were of Sabir origin and are Turkicized Ugrians.183 4) hey are of Uyğur origin (= the Qasars)184 5) hey stem from Hephthalites who migrated to the Caucasus (late ith-early sixth century) where they formed a union with the Sabirs and other nomads.185
I am most favorably inclined toward the Oğur-Sabir-Türk theory, which, I think, best accounts for the ethnic data we have. he fact that the Chinese sources so oten join Tujue (Türk) and Kesa (Khazar)186 is hardly accidental. he identity of the Türk qağanal and Khazar qağanal investiture ceremonies, reported by two completely diferent historiographical traditions (Chinese and Arabic) with no chance of contamination also argues strongly for the Ashina origins of the Khazar ruling house. hese practices, in particular the ritual strangulation of the would-be Qağan, would hardly have eluded the attention of our sources had they been the norm practiced by other Turkic steppe peoples. Although a prohibition (not always followed) on the shedding of the ruler’s blood in the Turkic world was fairly widespread (and hence strangulation was an acceptable means of getting rid of rival royal claimants et al.),187 we only have evidence for its practice in investiture ceremonies with the Ashina Türks and the Khazars. Nonetheless, the various hypotheses remain highly conjectural with little hard data to fully support them.

he earliest appearance of the Khazars, which is an important element of this question also remains highly problematic. As oten happened in medieval historical writing, the names of powerful peoples were transferred back in the past to kindred groupings or even to alien groupings that resembled them in life-style etc. hus, Byzantine historians regularly referred to the Eurasian nomads as “Scythians.” here are a number of notices placing the Khazars in the region before the midsixth century, but these are most probably anachronistic. Both Dunlop and Artamonov concluded that they were certainly “on the scene” by the reign of Husraw Anûšîrvân (531–579).188 Czeglédy, however, felt reasonably certain that the “Qasars and Barsils” came to the Caspian-Pontic steppe zone together with other Oğuric peoples ca. 463 (cf. the notice in the appendix to Zacharias Rhetor which mentions the 鍣鍗錹 K(a)s(i)r ca. 555—although this could just as easily be a garbling of Akatzir etc.189the relationship of which to the ethnonym Khazar has never been demonstrated) and then together with Oğuric groups and the Sabirs (who arrived ca. 506) came under Türk overlordship in 567. hen, according to this view, the Türk form of their name, Xazar spread and became known.190 I am less certain. Indeed, one might argue that before they are mentioned as the allies of Heraclius in his campaigns in Transcaucasia against the Sâsânids, there is little that can be said about them. Even in that context, the Byzantine and Armenian sources may be using the name anachronistically. Might not the name Qazar have come into being with their emancipation or break away from the Western Türk Empire, sometime between 630–650? Was it not perhaps at irst a descriptive or social term, akin to Qazaq, which later became an ethnonym? What role did the struggle with the Arabian Caliphate play in promoting Khazar statehood in a region in which nomadic statelessness was the norm? he discovery of texts that could be unambiguously attributed to the Khazars would certainly help to resolve the problem of Khazar origins. As we have seen, the Khazar words (names, titles and place names) scattered in our sources are largely neutral, only pointing to their undoubted Turkic character, but not telling us where they belonged in the taxonymy of the

Turkic linguistic world. he few recent papers which deal with this issue have analyzed individual terms191—useful and important, but the big question remains open. A major and much debated theme has been the question of Khazar inluences on the development of Rus’, in particular, the question of the Rus’ Qağanate and the origins of the Rus’ system of succession. We do not have time to discuss this signiicant question in detail—although it is illustrative of a possibly very important Khazar impact on Rus’ political development.192 Pritsak, in particular, has put forward Khazar origins for a number of aspects of the Rus’ political structure.193 Recently, he attempted to connect some elements of the Rus’ weights and metric system to the Khazars, concluding also that the Khazars did indeed have their own coinage.194 As usual, the evidence is thin and there is no agreement on these issues. he question of the role of the Khazars in the shaping of Eastern European Jewry seems to encounter polemics at every stage. Bernard Weinryb, in 1962, rather airily dismissed “most of the theories and hypotheses concerning the beginnings of east-European Jewry as no more than iction.”195 Popular works, such as Arthur Koestler’s he hirteenth Tribe have only added to the controversy. Salo Baron, who incorrectly viewed them as Finno-Ugrians, believed that the Khazars “sent many ofshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centers of eastern Europe” and concluded that

“this noteworthy experiment in Jewish statecrat doubtless exerted a greater inluence on Jewish history than we are as yet able to envisage.”196 Paul Wexler’s controversial study of the Ashkenazi Jews declared the latter a people of Khazar and Western Slavic origins.197 Methodologically, Wexler has opened up some new areas, taking elements of folk culture into account. I think that his conclusions have gone well beyond the evidence. Nonetheless, these are themes that should be pursued further. he dating of the Khazar conversion to Judaism was unclear and much disputed for a long time. Depending on which text one cares to privilege, the dates have ranged from ca. 740 to ca. 861.198 We now have irmer ground on which to stand. Al-Mas‘ûdî placed the conversion to the reign of the caliph Hârûn al-Rašîd (786–809).199 In 837/838, the Khazars issued imitation ‘Abbâsid dirhams which contain the customary Muslim formula, but with a signiicant change: “here is no God, but God and Moses is his Messenger.”200 Clearly, the dominant strata of Khazaria were Judaic by that time. While I am convinced by the work of Zvi Ankori and Norman Golb that the Khazars were adherents of Rabbinical Judaism, the question of Eastern European Qaraite origins, so oten tied to the Khazars, requires still further investigation. he Qaraim of Eastern Europe are an example of an interesting symbiosis between a Jewish people and the Turkic world, more speciically the Cuman-Qıpčaq population of Medieval Crimea. We know little of the inner life of the Khazars, having only tantalizing hints about clan and tribal structure, class relations, gender relations etc. here are still arguments over the weight of nomadic to sedentary population within Khazaria. here remain diiculties in identifying, archaeologically, the various populations of the Qağanate.

written materials we can make only general statements about the Turkicness of their language, a crucial marker of identity. Nonetheless, a lot has been achieved. Parts of the jigsaw puzzle are coming into clearer focus. What remains to be done? he creation of a full corpus of all texts pertaining to the Khazars is certainly one of the most important desiderata. New editions of key texts, for example the Derbend-Nâme along with the other North Caucasian chronicles, in their original languages accompanied by translations, would be useful.201 he Chinese sources have only recently been introduced in a serious way. here are a number of scattered references to the Khazars, in part in connection with Khwârazm, which had direct relations with the Tang.202 he references include reports on Khazar food and drink. Obviously, the publication of the archaeological data is one of the most important tasks along with new expeditions to Khazar sites. he Khazars remain elusive, sometimes enigmatic. With more than a century of research done, there still remains much to do.
201 he work of A.R. Šixsaidov is a very useful step in this direction, cf. his “Dagestanas

THE ALANS: NEIGHBOURS OF THE KHAZARS IN THE CAUCASUS
Irina A. Arzhantseva
he Alans invariably occupy a key position in the complex, turbulent and sometimes obscure relations between the Khazars and their numerous neighbours, not to mention many of the Khazar’s political ventures. As the Alans held, geographically, a strategically important position in the North Caucasus (ig. 1), which was the major cross-roads of Eurasian trading and military routes, they were, from the moment that they united into a coherent political group, constantly drawn into the orbit of the complicated relationships of the super-powers, whose interests clashed in the North Caucasus. In the sixth-seventh centuries these powers were Iran and Byzantium, who fought for control over the caravan routes that ran across the North Caucasus through territory occupied by the Alans. From the middle of the seventh century the Alans found themselves in the sphere of interest of a new political entity, the Khazar Khaganate (Gadlo, 1979, pp. 74–78, Kuznetsov, 1992, pp. 154, 155). By the middle of the eighth century, the Alans were now virtually under Khazar rule (Artamonov, 1962, с. 360; Kokovtsov, 1932, с. 101–102) and they go almost unmentioned in Byzantine sources of the eighth and ninth centuries (Kuznetsov, 1992, с. 155; Kulakovskyi, 1899, с. 49, 50). It is diicult to state with any clarity what sort of subordination the Alans endured from the Khazars. he Alans were the force by virtue of which the Khazars emerged victorious from the diicult struggle for overall control in the North Caucasus. “he Alan union, even ater this, remained intact as a coherent political entity with its ruler, even though its actual role was ambiguous and sometimes inconstant . . . the Alans always appear to be a separately deined political entity who are at times allies of the Khazars and at times closer to Byzantium or, very rarely indeed, to the Caliphate” (Novosel’tsev, 1990, p. 105). Written sources indicate that, quite apart from help as allies and military support, the Alans paid tribute to the Khazars (Kokovtsov, 1932, с. 101–102, 105). Some experts, however, point out, and rightly so, that



60 irina a. arzhantseva
the Alans’ core territory was unlikely to have formed a part of the Khazar state itself. We ind more convincing the arguments put forward by those Caucasologists, such as Kuznetsov and Zeteishvili (Zeteishvili, 1976, с. 85, Kuznetsov, 1992, с. 155), who hold the view that the eastern Alans inhabiting the area around the Darial pass were most dependent on the Khazars, while the western Alans inhabiting the upper Kuban valley retained a greater measure of independence and were traditionally more pro-Byzantine in their policies (ig. 1). We archaeologists however focus our attention on the microzone which is situated in the region bordering on Khazaria but which gravitated towards Western Alania. his is the south-west border of the Khazar Khaganate. It is a region which has at all times had extraordinary attractions for a number of diferent tribes and which is rich in archaeological monuments stretching over a number of periods. his region is today that of Caucasian Mineral Waters, or, geographically, the Kislovodsk basin (ig. 2). It is very likely that in the seventh to ninth centuries this region did not form an immediate part of the Khazar Khaganate (Kuznetsov, 1992, с. 153, Mamaev, 1974). Yet it was here that a very intensive iniltration of Turkic elements took place into an Alan zone in the early mediaeval period (Abaev, 1949, с. 257). hese Turkic elements were very likely Kuban Bulgars who were subject to the Khazars (Kovalevskaya, 1984, с. 172). If we are to understand properly the nature of the tributaries and sovereign relationships involved, we must do so not only by interpreting the subjective and unreliable data to be found in written sources. We have to have a good idea of the structure and organisation of life among the Alans at this period. For the last few years our team, in conjunction with a group of soilscientists and geologists, has been tackling the problem of the historical and palaeo-landscape conditions for the emergence and evolution of Alan settlements, their structure, typology and chronology. We are also concerned with questions of the formation and evolution of soils of terraced slopes and ancient settlements, with a consequent construction of a regional spatial and temporal model for the development of climate, of soils and ancient systems of agriculture and communications (Arzhantseva, Turova, Bronnikova, Zazovskaya, 2001, рр. 115–124). Our work was directed at the following goals: 1) a proper archaeological investigation of the monuments; 2) the creation of large-scale topographical plans of the key-monuments; 3) landscape and soil research; 4) engineering and geological research on the monuments and the adjacent territory.



the alans: neighbours of the khazars in the caucasus 61
From the point of view of solving these problems we found that the most interesting microregion was that of the Caucasian Mineral Waters or the Kislovodsk basin. Here the density of population from the ith to sixth centuries rose rapidly because of an inlux of Tanais Alans, who were attacked by the Huns, ater they forced the Volga, in 372 A.D. (Ammianus Marcellinus, 1949, 305), or because of migration of other Alan tribes from neighbouring territories (perhaps from the Terek-river region or from Kabarda, cf the well reasoned hypothesis of the archaeologist Vladimir Malashev).1 he shit in their habitual habitation zones and the new natural conditions forced the Alans to alter the system of their economy and they had to change from a purely cattle-breeding economy to another one, a combination of agriculture and cattle-breeding. Archaeologically, these processes are represented by a number of Alan sites in the foothill plains (sometimes the cultural accretions stretch from the 1st century A.D. to the period preceding the Mongol conquests). Before we speak of the Alan settlements and the palaeo-landscape situation in this region, the historical context requires a few words. his is the time in which the consolidation of the Western Alans took place. For a number of years (from 558 to 572 A.D.) Byzantine sources mention a “king” or “ruler” of the Western Alans, Sarozius, who had a consistent policy of alliance with Byzantium (Menander, 1860, 374–384). Basing ourselves on these sources we can imagine the territory subject to the rule of Sarozius: this would be the Upper Kuban, the Pyatigor’e region and present-day Balkaria i.e. the Kislovodsk basin was part of this zone (Kovalevskaya, 1984, с. 134). Here, however, were the routes over passes beyond the control of Iran, the permanent rival of Byzantium. Correspondingly, it was here that the basic interests of Byzantium, which was subsequently to be, together with the Alans, an ally of the Khazars against the Arabs, were concentrated. he control and defence of these passes by the Alans was the key element in their union with the Byzantines and also with the Khazars. Sarozius was well acquainted with the most important political and diplomatic events then taking place in the Caucasus, and rulers of other tribes turned to him as a mediator if they wished to obtain support from Byzantium.

Carrying out such a determined and irm external policy was possible only by relying on a solid rear-ground. Here too it is natural to suppose that the sharp increase in the population numbers and the appearance at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh centuries of a series of settlements with a system of “strictly ordered organisation of defence” (Iessen, 1941, с. 24–25) in all the mountain valleys leading to the paths over the passes must be linked to the activity of the same Sarozius. he most densely settled areas (or to be precise, the best researched) have turned out to be the tributaries of the Podkumok (the rivers Alikonovka, Ber’ozovaia and others) near Kislovodsk. Here, at the end of the sixth or at the very beginning of the seventh century, there arose a network of fortiied settlements (Korobov, 2001, pp. 133–135), which lasted until the ninth-tenth centuries, i.e. virtually for the entire life of the Khazar Khaganate. hese fortresses are striking by their homogeneity. he fortresses were set up every 2 or 3 kilometres at the furthest point of an outcrop that dominated a river (the height of the outcrop was between 5 and 10 metres) on convenient cattle-driving paths. Sometimes in a relatively small space a whole nest of such fortresses was built and these controlled the routes not only to the passes but also to the best Alpine pastures (ig. 2). he fortress walls, towers, habitation and economic structures were made of large blocks of grey limestone which was quarried, as a rule, on the low rock on which the outcrop stood thus turning it into an impregnable citadel: the fortress walls were from 4 to 6 metres wide and, apparently about 6 to 8 metres high, with lanking and gate towers on a vertical two-metre monolith rock base. he lower part had steep, inaccessible slopes. he gates were in the lower part and they led to a light of steps carved out of the rock, leading to the citadel. heophylactus Simocatta (Simocattes) describes absolutely identical fortresses in the episode about the capture by the Byzantine of one fortress in spring 583 A.D. (Feoilakt Simokatta, 1957, с. 4). Typically, the Alan settlements in the foothills and mountains of the Central Caucasus have a grouped systematic distribution, there is a visual link between the settlements, they are of small size and they use naturally fortiied outcrops and rocks (some of them were inhabited even in late Sarmatian times). Along the Alikonovka river, from Kislovodsk lake to the upper reaches, over some twelve kilometres fourteen fortresses have been found, all of them within signalling distance from each other (ig. 2). No sooner would an enemy appear than the bad news would be signalled through the valley: cattle had to be driven of

and hidden in the mountains, supplies had to be tucked away and men prepared for battle. An enemy might lay siege to a fortress and cut it of from its water supply, but to judge by our most recent data, there are water-bearing layers in many of these rock outcrops and the fortresses were sited next to a mountain spring which clearly served as a source of water at critical moments. It is most likely that the population of these neighbouring fortresses were linked by social relationships. hey appear to have taken part in campaigns together and are very likely to have used common pastures and hunting areas et cetera. Consequently, the organisation for defending these fortresses must also have been shared. he constructional peculiarities of the sites are due, irst and foremost, to the geomorphology of the Northern Caucasus and clearly to the time they were built, rather than to any historical and cultural or ethnic particulars of the population that let them (Kovalevskaya, 1984, с. 146, Arzhantseva, 2001, p. 48). It is possible to trace deinite changes which took place in the life of the population. If at the end of the sixth and in the seventh centuries small fortresses, homogeneous in their plan and layout, comprised a single defensive system which stretched from the foothills to the pass routes over the Great Caucasus, (Arzhantseva I., 1997, pp. 153–161) then in the eighth and ninth centuries certain fortresses show distinct signs of having being captured by nomadic Turkic peoples. hese Turkic elements were very likely Kuban Bulgars who were subject to the Khazars (Kovalevskaya, 1984, с. 148–149; Fedorov Ya.A., Fedorov G.S., 1978, 83–84, Arzhantseva, 2002, p. 442). As a standard monument for archaeological work we selected the settlement Gornoe Ekho and for palaeo-landscape research the Alikonovka river valley in its entirety. he structure of the monument is very typical for small Alan fortresses as we have described them. he outcrop on which the monument stands consists of two layers (ig. 3). he majority of structures are situated on the horizontal surface of the upper layer (ig. 4). he area of the upper tier is less than that of the lower. On three sides, the outcrop is bounded by the river Alikonovka valley and the Lunacharsky stream. Unfortunately, at various times stone has been extracted from the monument for the needs of local construction and this has led to a process in which enormous cracks have formed and the process of destruction has been accelerated. But, on the whole, the monument is in a fairly good, stable condition. At the present time we have virtually completed a large-scale topographical plan (1:500) and have marked on it the remains of structures visible on the surface (ig. 5).

he plan shows about 40 objects and overall it is now possible to have an idea of the monument’s structure. he largest object on the site is object 1, which occupies an area of about 600 square metres. his would appear to be the key structure in the site’s fortiication system. It may well have been a fort wall with towers and contre-forces. he object has been built at the narrowest place in the site and straddles it from one edge to the other. his construction is very similar to what was described by Procopius of Caesaria.2 Only a little part of this object was uncovered ater 3 years of investigations. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that this wall is of a very complicated structure. Very likely, this object consisted of two parallel double-faced walls with a space between it divided into special separated rooms and chambers. Some of these chambers were illed with stone debris (ig. 6). hus, the wall that we suppose to have stood there separated the greater northern part of the site on which most of the structures stood from the southern part. In the southern part there are virtually no structures which can be interpreted as habitations. It may well be that cattle were rounded up here at dangerous moments. Even though not a very big area of habitation deposit has been uncovered, one is struck by the intensity of life: there are many animal bones, especially on the areas by the walls; there is a lot of burnt daub—turluk, charcoal, fragments of ceramics. Over large areas we can ind traces of ire and destruction which can be dated to the middle or end of the eighth century (Arzhantseva, 2006, p. 132, ig. 14). Striking too is the characteristic destruction of the walling, with dilapidation occurring in one direction and several irregular cracks of virgin rock outcrop among the building’s remains (ig. 7). his suggests that even during the life of the town there were earthquakes. his too would explain the disordered heaps of large lumps of limestone lying at the edge of the plateau, at quite a distance from the nearest structures, too far to explain their position as the result of the ordinary disintegration of the walls. he date of the monument can, on the evidence of the ceramics, be put somewhere in the sixth to eighth centuries. here is no doubt now that the fortress was still operational in the ninth-tenth centuries (ig. 8). In reconstructing the system of mountain agriculture of Alan settlements in the North Caucasus in the irst millennium and the beginning of the second, we must ask how such a large population supplied its needs and how their economy was organised? What resources did the Alans have from which to pay tribute to the Khazars? At the same time,

Constantine Porphyrogenitus intrigues us by his speculation that Alania had two ways of exerting pressure on the Khaganate, irst and foremost by interrupting the supply to Khazaria of ‘the means of subsistence’ since nine Khazar provinces (“climates”) have common borders with Alania and from these areas Khazaria receives “all its supplies” (Constantine Porphyrogenitus, 1989, с. 52, 53). here is every reason to suppose that the Caucasian Mineral Waters region supplied Khazaria with agricultural produce. In studying systems of supplying the necessities of life, the question to which the least attention is paid is that of the organisation of agricultural production in the conditions of mountain regions.3 he data from excavating the site testiies to a high level of agricultural production, for on its territory we ind a large number of grain stores, grindstones and so on—undoubted signs that the population undertook agricultural work.Research into the territory along the river Alikonovka valley of the Kislovodsk basin has shown that the mountain slopes have everywhere been turned into agricultural terrains by human hand, turning them into a system of stepped terraces (from 1 to 7 on one slope). Our work proved beyond doubt that these terraces are of artiicial origin. he construction of the terraces was done by cutting an even or slightly curving stepped ledge (10 to 30 metres wide and 200 to 300 metres long) into the slope. he soil for the building of the terrace was either brought from another slope or was cut out of the upper part of the slope and placed as a step lower down the slope (Arzhantseva, Turova, Bronnikova, Zazovskaya, 2001, ig. 14.1, 14.2b). he terraced agricultural terrains of the Alan sites difer in their structure. hus we ind terraces fortiied by stones at the longer edge (probably to retain water), terraces which are not continuous, drawn out along northern slopes, and continuous terraces which go right around the whole of a raised point. Clearly, the diference in constructions is linked to a varying level of agricultural knowledge by the indigenous and the assimilated tribes who had settled this region. With a high degree of probability we may thus conjecture that there was not only a stable productive system of agriculture but that it evolved progressively over the historical period under study.
3 All soil and palaeo-landscape studies were carried out and are still being carried out by a group of specialists from Moscow State University, Pedology Faculty (Dr. Sergey Sedov) and from the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Dr. Maria Bronnikova, Dr. Marina Skripnikova, Irina Turova).

Special emphasis should be given to the stabilising, ecologically conservative role of terraces in today’s very unstable landscape conditions in the Northern Caucasus foothills. Terraced slopes are less liable to suffer from erosion and landslide than their natural analogues. We were also faced with the task of reconstructing the palaeo-landscape by palaeo-soil and palaeo-botanical methods. Basic soil-science conclusions: by comparing the burial soils under the surface soils of the terraces, under barrows of Scythian times to modern soil surfaces,4 we can conclude that in the second half of the Holocene (7000 years), the climate remained more or less stable. A slight tendency was observed towards increased moisture, but on the whole the climate was favourable to steppe ecosystems. his means that in the Caucasian Mineral Waters region the formation and functioning of ethno-cultures for the last two thousand years took place in conditions when grassy vegetative associations predominated, with forests only along the river valleys. his situation difers radically from the landscape dynamics in the western foothills of the Caucasus (the upper reaches of the Kuban, Zelenchuk, Marukha rivers and westwards to the Black Sea), where in the late Holocene there was a sharp change of climate and the steppe ecosystems which had earlier predominated gave way to forests. his means that in the Caucasian Mineral Waters region the conditions for cattle-raising were always favourable, unlike more westerly regions. Hence, this very area attracted nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes by its mostly animal-husbandry-based economy for nearly a millennium, up to the late 8th century A.D. Given relatively stable climatic conditions, in the valleys we note traces of catastrophic phenomena. An analysis of the depth of slope deposits has shown a rhythmic structure: horizontal layers of well developed burial soils alternate with coarse stony slope accretions which stem from landslides or earth movement, unafected by soil formation (Arzhantseva, 2006, p. 131). his means that periods of stabilisation of slope surfaces and of the development of soil formations alternated with phases of abrupt activation of slope processes. hese phenomena may have been caused by tectonic phenomena of a catastrophic nature
4 Analyses by morphological features, by the way in which humus and carbonates are distributed were carried out in Tim Darvill’s laboratories; analyses by looking at the isotope composition of humus were carried out in the Institute of Soil Science and Photosynthesis of the Russia Academy of Sciences at Pushchino.

(earthquakes). he archaeological materials found in the upper layer of coarse slope deposits allow us to date them in time, synchronically with the settlements being studied. his must have had an efect on the life of Alan tribes in this region and in particular could have been a reason for certain settlements ceasing to function and the population draining away to more peaceful regions.

THE KHAZAR LANGUAGE
Marcel Erdal
1. Introduction
All scholars who have voiced an opinion on the language of the Khazars in terms of assigning it to a language family take them to have been a Turkic nation1 speaking a Turkic language.2 Already in their own age, several Muslim geographers made statements to this efect.3 Trying to make sense of what remains of their language is therefore the task of Turkic linguistics. Work carried out during the last decades on this topic started with Golden 1971, an insightful though generally neglected paper. here followed a burst of activity in the early 1980s, when Golden 1980, Ludwig 1982 and Golb & Pritsak 1982 brought together practically all of the relevant material; the article Ligeti 19814 is an important review of this latter book. Beside its other assets, Ludwig’s dissertation features
1 I deliberately use this term and not ‘tribe’ because the Khazars do not, even in the
earliest stages of their documented history, present themselves as a tribe in the typical
early Turkic sense, as were the Chigil, Tuxsï, Yaġma etc.
2 Golden 2005: 206 points out that Abbasid sources oten interchange the nisbas
at-Turkī and al-Xazarī. Still, there must have been very many diferent ethnic groups
within the Khazar realm, as there are to this day on the territory which that realm cov
ered. hese groups spoke diferent languages, some of them no doubt belonging to the
Indo-European or diferent Caucasian language families. A word documented as having
been in use in Khazaria need not, therefore, have belonged to the leading nation, the
Khazars.
3 he most recent summary on contemporary Arab statements on this question is
Golden 2005: 206 (lower half of the page). If Al-Istaxrī (quoted there) reports conlict
ing notices, one stating that “the language of the Khazars is diferent from the language
of the Turks and the Persians, nor does a tongue of any group of humanity have anything
in common with it”, the other that “the language of the Bulġār is like the language of
the Khazars”, both cannot be correct if they apply the same criteria of similarity and
if they refer to the same language. In principle it might very well be possible that an
original Khazar tribe spoke a non-Turkic language and was secondarily Turkiied due to
its association with the Türk empire in the 6th century; however, I think that Al-Istaxrī
(writing in the irst half of the 10th century) or his sources are unlikely to have possessed
information on such an early process.

an appendix containing a supplement to the list of Khazar words in Golden 1980; Bazin 1981–82 is also relevant for the language question. he years following this intensive activity saw the appearance of numerous reviews, some of them quite detailed, and of papers taking up, or arguing against, views expressed in the research mentioned. Golden (2002–3, 2005) has recently revived investigations on the Khazar language. However, with the scanty material there is, it seems diicult to get much further than what was achieved in the early 1980s. hus, concerning some of the Abbāsid slaves whose names are dealt with in Golden 2002–3, their being Khazars by birth is merely an assumption; the names of others cannot help us in the present endeavor because they can be connected with anything Turkic or in any other known language only if they undergo heavy ‘emendations’. It should not be too likely that new Arabic, Greek, Syriac, Persian, Hebrew or Caucasian sources mentioning unknown Khazar language elements turn up at this stage. It now seems that signiicant progress can be achieved only if some lengthy bilingual inscription in the Khazar language can be discovered, or perhaps a new Khazar inscription which has enough Eastern Turkic runiform characters to be intelligible.5 he dozens of known inscriptions are strings of at present unintelligible signs, concerning which we do not even know whether they fall into synharmonic sets (as most of the Eastern Turkic runiform script does); none of the attempts at deciphering them seem compelling.6 Under these circumstances, we can only sum up and comment what has till now been achieved concerning sources in foreign scripts. A summary taking into account Golden’s work together with the critical reviews dealing with it and, further, the ideas of others such as the proposals of Pritsak, has never been attempted. Determining what the Khazars spoke might tell us a lot also about their identity and about the history and structure of
5 Vasil’ev 2005 is a good summary of current views and opinions concerning this mat
ter. he present author is, together with Irina Nevskaya and Larisa Tybykova, engaged in
a survey of the runiform graiti of the Altay Republic, of which we now have more than
80 (more than half of them discovered during the last 3–4 years). Some of these clearly
show hitherto non-deciphered characters also found in Eastern Europe. Progress in the
study of this material as well as the whole corpus of Eurasian runiform inscriptions will
no doubt serve Khazar studies too.
6 One such instance is discussed in Kljashtornyj, 1991, who also quotes some addi
tional attempts. Much material is brought together in Bajčorov 1989. Kyzlasov 1994 is
especially important for placing the Eastern European inscriptions into their general
Eurasian context; another important study is Vasary 1998. Tryjarski 2002–4 is an excel
lent survey of this whole area.

Turkic settlement in Eastern Europe. A sound basis for our hypotheses is important primarily for the description of the Turkic languages and the historical relationships between them, but also in order to ensure that accounts of the Khazars’ early history will not rest on pseudo-linguistic arguments. Among the present-day Turkic languages Chuvash, spoken mostly in the Chuvash republic (situated roughly between Tatarstan and Moscow), constitutes a branch in itself. Its closest relative is Volga Bolgarian, a language directly documented only in 13th and 14th century inscriptions, found mostly on the territory of Tatarstan.7 his branch appears to have included other, now extinct, dialects, as suggested by words integrated into Hungarian.8 Scholars agree that the Chuvash-Bolgar branch got separated from the rest of Turkic at a quite early stage; certainly earlier than the oldest Turkic texts we have, which are the Orkhon inscriptions of the early 8th century.9 he most discussed question concerning the language of the Khazars has been whether it belongs to this aberrant Chuvash-Bolgar branch of Turkic or not. Most Turcologists have thought it did, but Golden 1980, for instance, tended towards the opposite view. Our judgement of ideas concerning Khazar would now be more solid than in the early 1980s, as we now know a lot more about that branch: Several scholars, notably Andras Róna-Tas, have brought their insight into the grammatical and the lexical domain concerning the history of Chuvash, the contacts of the branch with languages surrounding it and other matters,10 and new Volga Bolgarian inscriptions appeared in the recent decades. Volga Bolgarian turns out to have been well distinct from Common Turkic but still a rather ‘normal’ Turkic language. he short Nagyszentmiklós bowl inscription in Greek letters is also in line with what one would expect from a 10th century source of the Chuvash-Bolgar branch of the Turkic languages.11 Nothing in any
7 See Erdal 1993 for the documentation and description of this language and its
place among the Turkic languages.
8 Fruitful work in this domain is being carried out by Profs. Róna-Tas and Berta.
A dictionary encompassing all Turkic loans in Hungarian is in preparation; one of its
preliminary versions was Róna-Tas et al. 1995. A recent important publication in this
domain is Berta & Róna-Tas 2002. Prof. Róna-Tas also commented an earlier version of
the present paper, enhancing it greatly, as did Claus Schönig and Andreas Waibel.
9 Some scholars assign the earliest of these already to the late 7th century.
10 Róna-Tas 1982 can serve as an initiation to this topic.
11 Erdal 1988 has tried to substantiate the view that it represents Danube Bolgarian,
the Turkic language spoken by that part of the Bolgars who moved West to the Danube,
but widely diferent views have also been expressed; see below for one of these.

way supports the view, held by Poppe, Pritsak and some others, that the Bolgar-Chuvash branch was somehow intermediate between the Turkic and the Mongolic languages, taken by these scholars to have been genetically related. While the possibility of such genetic relationship can by no means be excluded, I would consider the full appurtenance of the whole of the Chuvash-Bolgar branch to the Turkic languages to be a irm fact. here are some features which Chuvash shares with Mongolian, one of these being the loss of stem-inal k. One likely explanation for such similarities is that Early Mongolian borrowed its Turkic words from a language of the Bolgar type, when that was still spoken in an area in contiguity with the Mongol homeland.12 he linguistic elements brought by the Mongolian invasion in the 13th century are easy to identify, and there is no reason to believe that any Mongolic language was spoken west of the Urals prior to Chingis Khan. One bit of evidence which has been brought forward in support of the early presence in Eastern Europe of ethnic groups speaking Mongolic is the name of the Avar ruler who conquered Pannonia and fought against Byzantium in the 6th century: His name was Bayan, which means ‘wealthy’ in Mongolic and corresponds to Turkic bay, same meaning.13 I do not think that this evidence is conclusively for Mongolic: bayan may have been the shape of this adjective in Proto-Turkic as well, and could have been retained by the Avars into the 6th century (i.e. preceding the earliest direct evidence from Turkic by more than a century); subsequently it appears to have stayed in use as a title and a proper name. he word could have been borrowed from Turkic into Proto-Mongolic (and further on into Tungus; cf. Doerfer 1965: 259–260) before the stem inal /a/ was dropped (the +n being, in fact, a suix).14 Helimski has in three
12 his is succinctly formulated in the section ‘Mongolic and Bulghar Turkic’, pp.
407–410 in Schönig 2003.
13 In his entry for this word, Moravcsik 1983: 83–84 mentions the names of, among
others, this person and also three 8th to 10th century sons or brothers of Onogur or
Danubian Bolgar rulers. A further instance has turned up in a Proto-Bolgarian inscrip
tion in Greek characters (mentioned in the present, as yet unpublished version of the
Hungarian-Turkic etymological dictionary in preparation: in the entry bán, a word said
to have been borrowed from bayan over South Slavic bān).
14 Schönig 2003: 406 mentions this name and two titles, adding that “none of [this] is
diagnostic enough to allow irm conclusions”. According to Róna-Tas 1990: 15 (footn.),
Early Western Turkic bayan lives on in Chuvash puyan ‘rich (person)’, which he derives
from the “Grundwort” puy- ‘to become rich’. Chuv. puy- is, I think, likelier to be from
bay+u- (same meaning, well attested in Old Turkic and elsewhere and clearly derived
from the adjective bay) over *puyă-: A verb ‘bay-’ is not attested anywhere else, and



the khazar language 79
papers published in 2000 (one with very useful bibliography) and 2003 put forward the idea that the Avars spoke a Tungus language and that the Nagyszentmiklós inscription mentioned above is also in this language. he European term bayan could, in case this hypothesis should prove to be correct, even be Tungus; the hypothesis is, however, arrived at by some arbitrary stretching of Tungus data, is far-fetched by itself and is therefore rather unlikely. Any proposal to explain a Khazar element through a stem or a suix known only from a language other than Turkic should, we think, be rejected unless at least one such element can be unequivocally identiied on the basis of what we know on the history of the Altaic languages.
2. The Khazar language material
he intelligible core of Khazar—not only the titles15 but also denotative nouns such as dog ‘funerary feast’, ït ‘dog’16 or bulan ‘elk’,17 the adjective alp ‘valiant’,18 the words for ‘white’, ‘yellow’ and ‘black’, the agentive suix +čI used in several Khazar words, the diminutive suix +Ak,19 the suix +šIn
Proto-Turkic cannot be shown to regularly have used stems as both nouns and verbs;
Chuvash inal high vowels are, on the other hand, oten syncopated (as in śar ‘army’ <
čärig). As correctly pointed out by Levitskaja 1976: 92, Chuvash -An no doubt comes
from Proto-Turkic *-gAn: he early -gAn derivate of bayu- would therefore have been
*bayugan and not bayan; had there been a verb ‘bay-’, its -gAn derivate would have
been ‘baygan’. he name of the Uygur khan who reigned between 747 and 759 has also
been posited as Bayan čor (though buyan < Skt. punya might be another possible read
ing of the Chinese characters). Bayan cannot have been formed with the formative -Xn
described for Old Turkic in Erdal 1991: 300–308, as its second vowel couldn’t have been
/a/ if it came from bayu- or indeed from (unattested) ‘bay-’; since this formative appears
to have been dominant (cf. uzun < uza-, tükün < tükä-, yarïn < yaru- etc.), it would even
be unlikely to come from a putative ‘bay+a-’ (for which cf. Turkish boşa- beside Old
Turkic bošo-).
15 Titles oten wander from one people to the other and are thus no proof of national
identity; Hilitβēr, dealt with below, is one such term. he most comprehensive account
of the Khazar titles is Golden 1980.

17 In Golb & Pritsak 1982 referred to by Golden 1984: 478, Pritsak connected this
noun (also the name of a Khazar kagan) with the name Bulčan appearing in Arabic
sources, taking it to be its “Hunno-Bolgaric” equivalent. his contradicts historical
sound laws, as Common Turkic ‘elk’ is also bulan and not ‘bušan’. Golden 1980: 171–3
correctly discusses Bulčan separately.
18 his element appears as a proper name of two persons, as does Alïp (explicitly
spelled thus twice) in three Volga Bolgarian inscriptions.

added to colour terms20—these are deinitely and exclusively Turkic.21 A few additional terms not hitherto identiied as Turkic could be added, e.g. the one spelt ’l-gˇd dh, quoted by Golden 1980: 247. Among the elements mentioned in that book, this is one of the two22 which is neither a proper name nor a toponym nor a title: It refers to a kind of travelling tent-car. his might just possibly be an attempt to write *čadára, since d and r look similar and can get confused in mss. in Arabic script if the word is unknown to the reader.23 his word would then be an instance of ča:tır (Turkic)/čador (Persian), šātor (pronounced thus in Hungarian) etc., signifying ‘tent’; it is dealt with in detail in Doerfer 1967: 16–22. A further hitherto unidentiied term is the title , by Golden 1980: 191–2 transcribed as *Jāwašīğar. Since this person is, according to Ibn Fadlān (fol. 212b, Togan 1939: 99), the third in the hierarchy under the Khazar co-ruler in charge of the army, it is itting for him to be called Čavïš-yïgar; this reading perfectly its the attested spelling. In the early Turkic administration, the čavïš were those who marshalled the ranks in battle and were in charge of order at court; the term is known since the Orkhon inscriptions and deined by Kāšġarī. his person must have been the oicial in charge of the Khazar čavïš corps: yïg-ar means ‘one who assembles or convenes’.24 If this idea25 is correct, it must denote an

the lower Volga; see below.
21 I mean that the sum total of these elements—including proper names, toponyms
and components of these—gives a Turkic picture. alp was also borrowed into various
Uralic languages and +čI into many Asian and South East European ones; such terms
could, of course, in principle also have been loans into Khazar.
22 he other one is a kind of woman’s clothing called τζιτζάκιον (two of the thir
teen instances show the variant τζιτζιάκιον), mentioned by the 10th century Byzantine
emperor and author Konstantinos Porphyrogennitos. Moravcsik explains it as Turkic
čiček ‘lower’, suggesting that this must have been the original Khazar name of the Kha
zar lady known as Eiréne (Greek ‘peace’), who became Byzantine empress in the 8th
century. Golden 1980: 175–6 agrees with Moravcsik’s view and lists the word as a per
sonal name. Konstantinos only says that this was the name of the garment the empress
wore, not her proper name; I ind Moravcsik’s idea far-fetched and would think the
name of the garment may e.g. have been due to its colourfulness. One is also reminded
of Hebrew cicít, ‘a Jewish ceremonial shawl with fringes’, ciciot ‘fringes’.
23 Golden quotes the single Arabic ms. extant, but mentions that there is an early
Persian translation of the source; it would be worth inding out how the word is spelled
the24re.A central Old Turkic meaning of yïg- is ‘convening a number of persons’. Kljash
tornyj 1991: 114 suggests emending yā, the third-last letter of this title, to nūn, and then
proposes an interpretation involving the names of two birds (one in truncated form);
this seems quite unacceptable to me. Most recently, Golden 2005: 214 proposed deriving
the title from *javaš ‘gentle’ by an obscure suix, but this also demands an ‘emendation’.
25 he interpretation čavïš/čavuš of the irst part of this title was already proposed
by Frähn and Marquart; cf. Togan 1939: 260. Köprülü’s detailed encyclopaedia entry on

oice corresponding to the çavuş-başı in the Ottoman administration (anadjunctofthegrandvizierandtheheadofthe çavuşcorpsinthedīvān). čavïš would here be the object of yïg-: We ind the structure ‘object noun’ + ‘governing verb in the aorist form’ also e.g. in the name of the 19th century Eltüzär khan or in the title orunbasar < orun ‘place’, bas- ‘to tread’: his term signiies ‘deputy’ in Modern Uygur, Kïrghïz, Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Tatar, Bashkir and no doubt elsewhere as well. his means that the čavïšyïgar was the ‘marshal’ bringing together all the čavïš. Most Khazar terms which have been shown to come from speciic non-Turkic languages are titles;26 in general, a great number of mostly pre-Turkic titles were passed on from one ancient and medieval Central Eurasian political entity to another. One such title is the second element in the names of two Khazars referred to in Armenian sources, Ałp iłut uēr and Xat irlit bēr.27 Golden 1980 correctly takes this to be the title which Vilhelm homsen in his edition of the Bilgä Qagan inscription spells as äl[t]äbär (E 37) and äl]täbär (E 40).28 Rásonyi (referred to in Golden 1980: 149–150 and Doerfer 1965: 202) suggested that this title consists of the Turkic noun el signifying, among other things, ‘realm’, followed by the aorist of täp- ‘to kick’. Golden 1980: 150 compares it to Elteriš (Kök Türk ruler), Alp el etmiš (ruler of the Uygur steppe empire) and the Uygur names El Almıš Sängün, El Tutmıš and El Qatmıš. his is highly unlikely, among other reasons because (as Doerfer 1965: 203 points out) the Orkhon Turkic aorist of täp- would be täpär. Much has already been written on this title, referred to by Golden and Doerfer; it appears in diferent sources, including Chinese, in quite a number of forms: he Arab traveler Ibn Fadlān has it with a /y/ before the initial vowel, as ;29 see Doerfer 1965 and Sims-Williams 2002: 235 for other varieties. Four Bactrian instances were recently added to this rich
çavuş (1963: 363a) states that the Khazars used the title çavuşyar (thus!) and also men
tions the reading of ‘çaüş’ as a Pecheneg word by Németh 1932: 56 f.
26 he originally Iranian kel ‘house’ is an exception. he patronym Kundājīq discussed
as Iranian by Golden 1980 is dealt with diferently in Golden 2002–3; for this name and
the possibly Mongol title underlying it see also Golden 2005: 214.
27 Alp is, of course, of Turkic origin, as is the irst part in the Bactrian sequence
referred to below; this might be the case also with the irst part of the second name.
28 homsen 1896: 182 (note 102) thought he might be seeing traces of an I in the
beginning of the E 40 instance, pointing at a reading like eltäbär/eltäbir. here are, all in
all, seven or eight instances of this term in runiform inscriptions, none of which have
any explicit initial vowel. In view of some of the instances quoted below, the i- might,
however, be a possibility.
29 SeeTogan1939:105forthereading,itsinterpretationandfurtherevidence.Róna-Tas

documentation: In texts N, N’, P and Q, dealt with in Sims-Williams 2000: 74–89, a certain ruler is referred to as Tapaγlıγ Hilitbēr or Tapaγlıγ Hilitβēr. he irst word in this sequence can only be analyzed as Turkic tap-Xg+lXg, from tap- ‘to revere’:30 cf. also the person referred to as Tap(a)γl(ı)γ Sangun in the Mahrnamag (l. 56), a Manichæan hymn book written in the 8th century.31 In the glossary to his edition, Sims-Williams points out that the title discussed here is attested as lytβyr in l. 91–92 of the Mahrnamag; this had not previously been noticed. his latter variant reminds us of Xat irlit bēr (assuming with Golden that Xat ir is an element by itself), whereas its labial consonant is more like that of iłut uēr. he Sogdian variant δyttpyr / ryttpyr quoted in Sims-Williams 2002: 235 has the labial consonant as a stop.32 he title is only once attested in Turkic in Uygur script, as Uygur iltbär+kä bermiš ‘he gave her to the Uygur I.’;33 all other Turkic examples are in runiform sources, in which there are no explicit vowels. he last vowel of this title is clearly long, as shown by a number of examples. Among the numerous instances, not a single one shows a vowel ater the t; on the other hand all instances with explicit non-long vowels have a high vowel ater the l. All this should inally put the Turkic etymologies for this title to rest: he reading ‘eltäbär’ (structured as El-tüzär mentioned above) is untenable. According to Sims-Williams 2002: 235, “the initial aspirate of the Bactrian spelling suggests that it may be a Khalach form, since the consistent preservation of [h-] is one of the most notable features distinguishing Khalach from other Turkish dialects”.34 his initial /h/ may indeed explain the y ~ Ø alternation in the evidence. We owe to Ludwig 1982: 356–357 the (quite solid) evidence from heophanes (mid 8th century) for the word which proves that the Khazar language must be an especially archaic variety of Turkic: He shows that dog / δog was also the Khazar variant of Orkhon Turkic yog ‘funerary feast’, beside being that of the 6th century irst Türk dynasty as quoted in Greek sources.35
30 he [a] in the second syllable is normal in Old Uygur suixes with a velar.
31 he ms. must be a later copy; see Müller 1912: 10.
32 In early borrowings into Sogdian, foreign /l/ is rendered as δ, in late borrowings as
r; the p can be read as [b].

3. Phonetic evidence for Khazar classification
Balhī’s statement that lisān bulġār mitla lisāni ’l-hazar is quoted (among others) by Benzing 1959: 691, though I would not accept his translation “daß die Sprache der Bolgaren dieselbe sei wie die der Chasaren”: can also denote ‘similarity’ (in any sense) and not necessarily ‘identity’. To balance this we have, at any rate, the statement of (10th century) Istaxrī (quoted e.g. in Golden 1980: 56 with page reference to the edition) about the Khazars’ language that ‘no distinct tongue of mankind shares any of its characteristics’ (lā yušārikuhu lisān fāriq mina ’l-umam). Golden 1980: 56–7 discusses the question of the classiication of Khazar with reference to views expressed by Zajączkowski and Baskakov, which he convincingly refutes. he language being so archaic (as indeed one would expect in view of its early documentation), evidence which might be thought to disqualify a Bolgar-Turkic or a Common Turkic proile for Khazar must be weighed carefully, to see whether some feature characteristic of one or of the other language branch may not have come into existence at a stage later than Khazar evidence. his matter has already been pointed out in reviews to Golden 1980. Golden had stated that the title tudun speaks against assignment of the Khazar language to BolgarChuvash, as the sound shit d > r is not found in it; but in fact the passage d > r (or > r) should probably be dated later than the end of the 7th century, the time for which the title is attested;36 the earliest evidence for Volga-Bolgarian turun is in 1230.37 We are lucky in being able to divide the typical features of Bolgar-Turkic into two groups: he features which elements of this branch of Turkic share with Mongolic cognates (A) existed already before its speakers let Eastern Asia; the features which it does not share with Mongolic (B) are innovations which emerged in the west. he B features—the Western innovations—could have come up during a Western community phase (B1), in which case they would be shared by Chuvash-Bolgar and Khazar; alternatively (B2), they could have come up ater a separation of
sals for some time, it would not be surprising if they borrowed some lexemes from them.
However, this term clearly denoting a traditional religious practice, it seems an unlikely
word to borrow; the relationship between the two states appears to have been political
rather than cultural.
36 See Johanson 1983.

Khazar and Chuvash-Bolgar, possibly even ater Khazar had died out: he replacement of /d/ by /r/ just mentioned is a B2 feature of BolgarChuvash, since it is not shared by Khazar. If a Western innovation (B) found in Bolgar-Chuvash is shared by Khazar (B1), that indicates proximity and would entitle us to consider Khazar to belong to this group; if it does not (B2), this does not prove that Khazar did not belong to this section of Turkic, as the emergence of this feature might postdate the Western community stage. If, however, any A feature—a feature shared by Bolgar-Chuvash and Mongolic—is not found in Khazar, this would be clear proof that Khazar is not part of the Bolgar-Chuvash section of Turkic. Note that both B1 and B2 features can in principle be found also in languages which we know to be ‘normal’ Turkic, such as the Kipchak languages, which also entered the ‘western’ Turkic contact and sharing area at some stage in history. What, then, are the A features, the ones which can be reconstructed for Proto-Bolgar and Proto-Mongolic in the lexicon they shared and which the Ancient Bolgars brought with them when leaving South Siberia and travelling to the west?
a) he shared lexicon of the Bolgar branch and Mongolic have /r/ where all other Turkic languages have /z/ instead. b) he Bolgar branch and Mongolic have /l/, /lč/ or /lj/ where all other Turkic languages have /š/ instead; in Chuvash /lč/ and /lj/ become /ś/.38 c) he Bolgar branch and Mongolic have the voiced palatal africate [j] in word onset where Old Turkic39 and some other Turkic languages have [y] instead.
38 Much of the evidence for this is brought together in Tekin 1979: 130–132. his
correspondence appears in baš ‘head’, or, e.g., in the reciprocal-cooperative suix -Xš-,
as also shown by synonymous Mongolian -(U)lčA-. In both of these cases, Volga-Bolgar
ian retains /lč/ and Chuvash has /ś/, not /l/. Róna-Tas 1999 shows that, in two suixes,
Chuvash /š/ corresponds to the Common Turkic cluster /nč/.
39 We know this thanks to sources in Brāhmī, Tibetan and Arabic script, with reason
able certainty also sources in Manichaean script. he runiform characters y1 and y2 may
conceivably have had the secondary value j as well, in case this was the onset allophone
of /y/ there. If this sound existed in Orkhon Turkic at all, it could also have been written
with the letter č (e.g. in the name spelled Maqarač, which is written with j and not č in
Sanskrit). he Classical Mongolian script, adapted from the Uygur script, used the letter
yōd also for representing onset [j] and we don’t know whether the Mongols did not copy
this practice from the Turks they were in contact with.

d) Proto-Turkic /ā/ and /e/40 can appear as /ï/ and /i/ respectively (both apparently realised as [i]) in Mongolic.41 In Volga Bolgarian, /ā/ > /ïa/ > /ya/ and /e/ > /iä/ > /yä/.42 e) /s/ has an allophone /š/ before /i/ in Bolgar Turkic and in Mongolic; there is no such phenomenon in any other Turkic language. f) A palatalization of /t/ to /č/ is attested in Mongolic and Chuvash, only to a very limited extent in Volga Bolgarian, and not attested anywhere elsewhere in the Turkic world. g) Mongolic and Chuvash share the loss of Common Turkic voiceless velars at the end of nominal stems. I am not aware of such a phenomenon in Bolgarian.
Which of these phenomena do we ind in what has survived of Khazar?
(a) Rhotacism
he fortress whose name is spelled as in Greek and (s/ šrkyl ) or (s/šrkl ) in Hebrew43 was built in 838, for and by Khazars, and was not inherited from any Turkic tribe which might previously have come into the area (e.g. the Bolgars). he name is therefore highly likely to be Khazar and not one taken over from some other Turkic language. he second part of this name was probably borrowed from the lost West Middle Iranian cognate of Sanskrit grha ‘house’, Russian gorod ‘town’, Gothic garths ‘house’ and so forth.44 In Turkic, this element lives
40 /e/ is the front counterpart of /ā/, having evolved from long /ä/.
41 Although Proto-Turkic /a/ and /ä/ are sometimes raised also in Tuvan and Yakut,
there is in those languages no connection to original vowel length.
42 In Volga Bolgarian jāl ‘year’ corresponding to common Turkic yāš ‘wet; year of
age’, the onset /y/ appears to have been incorporated into the /j/. In this language, both
long and short /o/ and /ö/ (and sometimes /ü/) of Proto-Turkic also become falling
diphthongs (with onset /w/).
43 he diference between the Greek and the Hebrew sibilants consists in the plac
ing of a diacritical dot in Hebrew, the use of which was (and is) not obligatory in the
irst place. Hebrew also has another, unequivocal letter for expressing the sound /s/, but
that letter was not put to use in any of the early instances in which the name appears
in Hebrew writing. Golden 2005: 208 states that “can be read as Šarkîl (more
likely given Medieval Hebrew traditions of transcribing foreign terms) or Sarkîl”. I think
medieval Hebrew traditions do not necessarily speak for š, as sīn for [s] is also very com
mon. Furthermore, yōd was regularly used also for representing [e] and not just long or
short [i].
44 Munkácsi 1905 actually lists words of the shape /k/-vowel-/l/ in several Finno
Ugrian and a number of East Caucasian languages as well as in Ossetic and Kurdish,
having very similar meanings; the areal difusion of this Iranian term does seem to be
in need of some further elucidation. Connecting Chuvash kil (~ kel) ‘house’ with an

on in the Turkish and Azeri suix +gil, which is used for referring to a set of persons in some way (e.g. as family members) attached to the person referred to by the noun serving as base (cf. Samojlovič 1925). Golden 2005: 208–9, who deals with this city name and its cognates in some detail, also quotes a Circassian tale which mentions Sarqah in connection with the Qazahrә. Turkish +gil is an untypical suix in not following vowel harmony and in being unstressed and thus betrays its origin as a separate word. Sarkel / Šarkel was synonymous with the etymologies of both Casablanca and Belgrade: he irst part of is translated into Greek as or , both ‘white’. To judge by this meaning, Khazar sār / šār ‘white, pale’ would not be identical with sārïg ‘yellow’; this latter served as base for the name of another Khazar town, Sārïgšïn. As Tezcan, 1975: 104–107 has shown,45 Common Turkic also has, beside sārïg, a word sāz ‘pale’. sāz, attested with a long vowel in Turkmen,46 is the real cognate of the Khazar term. In Karachay-Balkar north of the Caucasus—in Khazar country—and also in Kïrghïz as well as in Ottoman and in Anatolian dialects, saz denotes ‘a pale complexion’. Yakut ās, which also must come from sāz, denotes a ‘white horse’s hide’, while Kazakh and Kïrghïz have the derivate saz+ar-u ‘to become pale’. From this sāz a verbal derivate in +I- appears to have been formed, of the type discussed in Erdal 1991, section 5.42;47 this was then expanded to sārï-g by using -(X)g, the common formative for forming nouns and adjectives from verbs. he sound-law counterpart of Classical Mongolian šira ‘yellow’ is sāz,48 just as Mongolian bora corresponds to Turkic boz ‘grey, light brown’: Turkic /z/ regularly corresponds to Mongolian /r/, Mongolian [š] is regular for /s/ before /i/, and Turkic long ā turns up in Mongolian as /i/ in other cases as well. Chuvash šur also comes from sāz since it means ‘white, pale’; Chuvash šură could, by sound
Evenki (i.e. Tungus) term (borrowed into Yakut), as advocated by Fedotov 1996: 291
292 (quoted by Golden 2005: 209), is clearly highly far fetched—beside the fact that the
/u/ of the Evenki term makes the etymological connection impossible.
45 Followed by Tekin 1979: 129. Tezcan 1975 remains unpublished.
46 In phrases such as daŋ sāzï ‘early morning light’; the verb ağarmak in tan yeri
ağarmak, the Turkish counterpart of this phrase, is derived from ak ‘white’.
47 As sämiz ‘fattened, stufed’ gave sämri- ‘to grow fat’, sekiz ‘a jump’ gave sekri- ‘to
jump’ and yavïz ‘bad’ gave yavrï- ‘to grow weak’, thus sāz was expanded with this same
suix to give a verb *sārï-, which survives only in Chuvash šur- ‘to become white’. he
passage s > š before long vowels, a > u and the loss of the inal /ï/ are all regular develop

laws, come either from sāz or from sārïg, but has the same meaning as šur.49 Both sāz and sārïg were adopted by Hungarian (where the letter s is pronounced as [š]): Hungarian sár ‘yellow’ comes from sāz while Hungarian sarog and sárga (same meaning) come from sārïg. he oldest instance of Hungarian sár quoted by Róna-Tas et al. 1995: 26, which is from the year 1332, mentions a ‘horse in sár colour’, exactly as in Yakut ās (< sāz) on the other end of Eurasia.50 Going just by sound processes, sar / šar can have been shortened from sarïg through simpliication of the medial cluster /g-k/ and the common syncopation of the high vowel ater the /r/ (*sārïgkel > *sārïkel > sarkel); by this, the word would not serve as evidence for rhotacism. he semantics of Turkic itself seem to speak against this possibility, but in Mongolic and Hungarian the base as well appears to have signiied ‘yellow’. No certainty can therefore be gained from this for the hypothesis that Khazar belonged to the Bolgar-Chuvash branch of Turkic. Another much discussed51 problem for the theory that the language of the Khazars belonged to the Bolgar-Chuvash section of Turkic languages is their name: It has a /z/, which a rhotacistic language is not supposed to have. Consequently, the various solutions proposed for the origin of this name all assume a form which had /s/ as second consonant; this /s/ is then supposed to have gotten voiced between vowels. As Ligeti 1981: 18 points out, the name is in Chinese and Pahlavi sources as well as in the runiform Terkh and Tes inscriptions from the Uygur Steppe Empire spelled with an s. he problem with this idea is that there is no evidence whatsoever that the Khazar language—or Bolgar, for that matter—voiced consonants in general, or /s/ in particular, between vowels; Chuvash does do this, but it appears to be a late phenomenon.52 To judge
49 šură pit, e.g., means ‘a pale complexion’; cf. also the denominal verb šurăx- ‘to
become white or pale’ (formed with +(X)k-, the general Turkic suix for forming intran
sitive verbs from nouns and adjectives).
50 Rybatzki 1994: 200 states: “In den südsibirischen Türksprachen trägt sarïγ auch die
Bedeutung ‚weiß: graulich, isabellfarben, lavus’ but his sources are papers on Samoyed
(in which the Turkic term is merely a borrowing). he non-yellow hues appear to be
linked with horses’ colours, also in the Mongolic languages which he quotes.
51 E.g. by Golden 1980, Ligeti 1981: 18, Bazin 1981–82, Róna-Tas passim and in
fact already by Gombocz. he various points of view are summed up in Golden 1992:
233–4.
52 Volga Bolgarian evidence is weak on this matter: It consists of the form
ulemā+sem+ne ‘the scholars (acc.)’ in an inscription from 1314 (Erdal 1993: 87–8) with
the retention of /s/ between vowels; we are not sure about the juncture of the plural suf
ix (perhaps borrowed from Finno-Ugric), however, nor whether voicing would have
been permitted to interfere with consistent spelling.

by Ätil, the Khazar name of the Volga and also of the Khazar capital on the shores of this river, the Khazar language did not, at any rate, voice /t/ between vowels; otherwise, the name would have had a /d/ instead of a /t/ (as in modern Tatar). Nor did any other known variety of Turkic before the 14th century show voicing between vowels: he Arabic writing system, for one, would deinitely have made this visible, e.g. in Volga Bolgarian. However, rhotacism in the middle of the name xazar might have been prevented by the /r/ at the end of it, if the original name had a /z/ ater all: Turkic languages are known to have oten avoided two consecutive /r/s. Even if the /z/ were original and not an allophone of /s/, therefore, this would not be a real proof that the language did not belong to the Bolgar-Chuvash branch. Ligeti points out that the name of the Chuvash has both initial č and inal š, which would have changed to other sounds if this had been an inherited word.
(b) Lambdacism
Róna-Tas (personal communication) has proposed that the name of the important Khazar city Xamlïx (Golden 1980 no. 47) comes from Kamïš+lïk ‘an area covered with reeds’; this is indeed a likely name for a place on the banks of a river (as Xamlïx is). What Róna-Tas has in mind with this is *xamïl > Chuvash xamal ‘stubble’, which would entail the sound change š > l typical of the Bolgar-Chuvash group: *xamïl+lïx could easily have gotten simpliied to Xamlïx. his etymology gains in certainty by the fact that qamïl is the Ossetic word for ‘reed’: It was clearly borrowed into Alan (the medieval predecessor of modern Ossetic) from Bolgar-Chuvash Turkic.53 No contemporaries unfortunately proposed any translation for Xamlïx, though, and Golden (most recently 205: 213, with variants) reads the name as Xam-malïx < *Xam-balïx < *Xan-balïx ‘the king’s city’ (also the name of Beijing in Yuan times). Nor can we follow Golden’s rejection of the interpretation of Xam+lïx as ‘shaman (qam ~ xam) area’—what do we know about the religious practices of the Khazars before some or most of them decided to adopt Judaism? Boluščï, the Turkic name of the 10th century Khazar general whose Hebrew name was Pesax, might actually be considered as evidence against the Bolgar-Chuvash identity of this language, as its sibilant

appears to contradict lambdacism. he name (which actually means ‘helper, supporter’) would be acceptable as Bolgar-Chuvash if we take the second syllable to contain the reciprocal-cooperative suix, which became -(Ă)ś- (not -(Ă)l-) in Chuvash; *bol-Xš-Xš+čï would give boluš+čï by syncopation.54 he fact that the verb base ends in /l/ would also have been a dissimilating factor, just as the regular Bolgar-Chuvash change of d > r is blocked before /r/ (as irst pointed out by Clark 1978). bol-uš-, originally ‘to be for each other’, came to signify ‘to help, support, aid’, bol-uš (<*bol-Xš-Xš) ‘succour, support’: It is attested with this meaning in the Dīvān Luġāti ’t-Turk55 (fol. 322 and 184 respectively) and a number of times in Rabġūzī’s Qisasu ’l-Anbiyā’, then in (practically all!) Middle Kipchak sources and Modern Kipchak languages.56 Chuvash also has pulăš- and (much rarer) pulăš with the meaning ‘help’, but these must be borrowings from Kipchak, as they have /š/ and not /ś/. In fact, Boluščï might already be such a borrowing, in view of the name of Boluš’, the Khan of the Polovcy (i.e. Kumans) who invaded Ruś in 1054 (referred to by Golden 1980: 169). he rare agentive use of the suix -Xš in the proper name Boluš’ 57 (which makes sense only if given with this special semantic development in mind) was clearly unknown to the parents of Boluščï, who felt the need to add the agentive suix +čI, whether they themselves happened to be ethnically Khazar or not. We seem to have no certain Khazar evidence for lambdacism. he /š/ in the title Čavïš-yïgar proposed above is, on the other hand, a real problem for the hypothesis that Khazar belongs to the Bolgar-Chuvash branch; considering this (as well) to be a borrowed element would be a too simple and ad hoc solution.
54 he -Xš derivate from bol- ‘to become’ would have been an abstract noun merely
signifying ‘becoming’; cf. Erdal 1991: 265.
55 We refer to this according to the edition of the (11th century) Turkic material by
Dankof & Kelly 1982–4, henceforth using the abbreviation DLT.
56 hese languages are listed e.g. in Berta 1996: 96–97 and Schönig 2005; 397 (who
deals with the diferent terms for ‘help’ in the various Turkic languages); this mean
ing occurs also e.g. in (South Siberian) Shor and in New Uygur. Old Uygur and other
Middle Turkic sources appear to use bol-uš- only in the literal sense deriving from the
sum of its parts, however, and languages like Turkish and Turkmen have other semantic
developments not related to ‘help’. Part of the mss. of the Qisasu ’l-Anbiyā’ and a part of
its sections show Kïpchak inluence.

(c) he onset voiced palatal africate
A further non-Bolgar aspect of the term Čavïš-yïgar would be that its second part starts with /y/ and not /j/; unlike, that is, Volga Bolgarian jieti ‘7’ compared to Old Turkic yeti, jiyermi ‘20’ compared to yigirmi, jür ‘100’ compared to yüz or jāl ‘year’ compared to yïl or perhaps yaš. Assuming that the verb ‘to assemble’ was alive in Khazar,58 it is not very likely that its /y/ should have been retained just because it was not at the word onset. In any case we have no positive evidence for the voiced palatal africate in this language. he Mongolic documentation is especially interesting: Classical Mongolian had both onset /y and onset /j/, but early words with Turkic cognates all had /j/ and not /y/.
(d) he diphthongisation of low long vowels
Proto-Turkic sāz ‘pale, white’ and its derivate sārıg ‘yellow’ have long vowels in Proto-Turkic; this length appears to have been retained in the toponym Sārïgšïn, since sources in Arabic script spell it with alif in the irst syllable. In the Bolgar branch such length appears as a diphthong in Volga Bolgarian xyan ‘blood’ < kān, and the vowel of the ‘white’ / ‘yellow’ stem becomes /i/ in Mongolic šira.59 In both Mongolic and Chuvash, the palatal onset proceeds to palatalize any /s/ preceding it. No such phenomenon is visible in the two Khazar toponyms of which this stem is a part; the /a/ is spelled as a homogenous vowel, whether with length marked as in the instance just mentioned, or unmarked in Greek and Hebrew script. Golden 2005: 210–211 would like to read the title spelled as b’k in mss. of al-Istaxrī and Ibn Hawqal not as an unusual spelling for bäg but as yilig / yelig, and relate it to Old Turkic and Qarakhanid elig ‘king’, mainly because 13th century and later sources explicitly write ylk. Mistaking yā for bā is very common in Arabic mss., but the emendation of alif to lām is a bit more daring. Golden sees his view supported by the name of the late 9th century Hungarian ruler Árpád’s son, which his near-contemporary Porphyrogennitos spelled as ; but the Hungarians could, I think, have copied that from Bolgar as well (beside the possibility of this proper name having a quite diferent source). If Golden should be right
58 Kïpchak languages do have it, Chuvash does not!
59 Similarly, Mongolic nilbusun ‘tear’ and čilaγun ‘stone’ are (I think rightfully) con
sidered to be cognates of Turkic yāš ‘tear’ and tāš ‘stone’ respectively.



the khazar language 91
about proposing yelig,60 this would be a Bolgarian-type onset for Khazar. It could then be that Khazar turns long /ä/ into a diphthong but not long /a/; this would not be like Bolgar-Chuvash either,61 but like Yakut. Golden 2005: 208 states that Ïtax, “while showing the -aq/-ak sufix found in many Oğuro-Bulğaric forms (. . .),62 lacks, at least in this anthroponym, the i-/ı- > yi-/yı- shit that one inds in Oğuro-Bulğaric (. . .) and is apparent in the Khazar title yilig/yélig”. While Khazar yelig would accord with the Bolgar diphthongising of Proto-Turkic /e/ to give /iä/ (e.g. in yäl ‘community’ > Chuvash yal ‘village’ from Proto-Turkic el,63 or biäl+ < beš ‘ive’), Volga-Bolgarian (like Yakut) did not diphthongise short or long /i/ or /ï/ (cf. Erdal 1993: 149–150, 152–3).64 Actually, then, this name fully accords with what one would expect from a language element in the Bolgar-Chuvash group.
(e) he palatalization of /s/
Another term not included in Golden 1980 but clearly belonging to the Khazar realm is the name of a river in an 8th or 9th century account of the Crimea, written in Greek as and translated as , that is ‘black water’; see Róna-Tas 1976: 166–7 and 1982: 152 with references. I would suggest reading this as xara sïw (w symbolising a semi-vowel; not a voiced fricative, for which Greeks would use beta); since [š] cannot be written in the Greek alphabet (nor is pronounced as such by normal Greeks), the reading xara šïw would also be possible for Khazar. hat the inal labial element (spelled ου) should be syllabic (as proposed by Róna-Tas 1982: 152) is unlikely especially if the stress on the ί was in the original source.65 he word for ‘water’ is suw in all early
60 ‘Yilig’ would not be expected, as */e/ becomes iä > yä; see the next paragraph.
61 Cf. however Volga Bolgarian jāl ‘year’, mentioned above.
62 Chuvash uyăx ‘moon’ and xĕlĕx ‘horse hair’ compared to their Common Turkic
cognates and synonyms ay and kïl indeed show that that branch of Turkic made more
use of °k suixes than other Turkic languages; the Volga Bolgarian word for ‘month’
(< ‘moon’) also already ends in /x/. hese suixes may, however, have been borrowed
from Iranian and may not come from Proto-Turkic.
63 Found also in Mongolic as a not so early borrowing.
64 Cf. Volga Bolgarian hir ‘daughter’ corresponding to Common Turkic kïz (both
words with long vowels) and xïrx ‘forty’ corresponding to kïrk, both with short vowels.
Chuvash does indeed place prosthetic /y/ also before onset /ï/ (as in Chuvash yïtă ‘dog’
mentioned by Golden, whose source also happens to have had a short vowel) but this
appears to be a later development.

Common Turkic but šïv, with an unrounded vowel, in Chuvash. In the Volga Bolgarian inscription from the year 1307 dealt with by Róna-Tas 1976 a river is called šïw, as in the 8th/9th century account; cf. also Erdal 1993: 128–9. Would the non-labial vowel in the word for ‘water’ speak for an assignment of Khazar into the Bolgar-Chuvash branch? Not necessarily: he Khazar form of this word is identical with the shape the word ‘water’ must have had in Proto-Turkic, as shown in Erdal 1991: 177; the labial consonant must have rounded the vowel secondarily, as happened in many Old Turkic words.66 Had there been any positive evidence for Χαρασίου to be pronounced with [š], a grouping with Bolgar would have to be assumed, as no other early Turkic language shows this phenomenon (though Classical Mongolian does). In any case there was, in this very area, a Great Bolgarian Empire, which dissolved around the year 670. his river name could very well have been inherited from the earlier, in this case at least partially Bolgarian, population of the area; river names, and toponyms in general, oten do get handed down from inhabitants to inhabitants.
(f) he palatalization of /t/
he Khazar name for the river Volga and for a city on its banks was Ätil; the /t/ was not replaced by /č/ even though it was followed by /i/. I am not aware of any Khazar word in which /t/ did get palatalized. Volga Bolgarian altı ‘six’ and älti ‘wife of imam’ as well as the 3rd person preterit suix when appearing as -ti show that that language did not generally palatalise /ti/; this actually happens only in a few of the epitaphs. hat the Khazars did not do that in the river’s name therefore does not disqualify their language from Bolgar status. he Chuvash phenomenon of t > č before /i/ etc. may either be younger, or it may have characterised only a part of the Chuvash-Bolgar group.
(g) he loss of inal voiceless velars
At the end of his 2005 paper, Golden writes: “he shit -q / -ğ > -x > -h > 0, typical of Oğuro-Bulgaric . . ., seems to be a feature of Khazar as well.”
66 Bashkir hïv ‘water’ (spelled and pronounced with a non-labial vowel) is, I think,
likelier to come from a Volga Bolgarian substrate rather than having survived from
Proto-Turkic times; other explanations are possible as well. If the Volga Bolgarian word
for ‘water’ had come from *sū, one would have expected it to have a falling diphthong,
as e.g. *ü ̄č ‘three’ becomes weč.



the khazar language 93
he only case where Golden seems actually to refer to such a loss in this paper is, however, in shapes which the name of the Päčänäk tribe appears to get in the sources; that, however, is not a Khazar word. I am not aware of any evidence for such a loss in Khazar. On the other hand, the attested Volga Bolgarian language material does not show this phenomenon either. So, it may be a coincidence that there is such loss both in Mongolic and in Chuvash (unless it occurs exactly in the same words); alternately, only a part of this branch of Turkic (which also had had contact with the Mongols) could have shown it. A third possibility is that our limited Volga Bolgarian corpus does not show this phenomenon although the language did have it.
B evidence
We showed above why the absence of the sound change d > r is no proof that Khazar was of the Common Turkic type, even if it is in evidence in such an early Bolgar source as the 10th century Nagyszentmiklós bowl inscription in Greek characters (where the -dOk suix appears with onset r). Can the sound change #x < [#q] shown at the beginning of xara ‘black’ help us classify Khazar (if indeed xara sïw is not inherited)? Another Khazar word starting with #xa is the name of the city Xamlïx, for which two possible etymologies were mentioned above; beside, of course, the name of the nation itself. he onset ‘stop > fricative’ sound change is typical of Chuvash and in full evidence in 13th–14th century Volga Bolgarian hir ‘girl’, xyan ‘blood’ and xïrx ‘forty’ (Erdal 1993: 115). However, this sound feature appears also in early Qïpchaq: e.g. in pronominal xayda and xačan, and xal- ‘to remain’ or xayïš ‘leather strap’ in the Codex Comanicus ( just mentioning cases where the following vowel is /a/).67 Kāšġarī (fol. 541) says that the Oguz and Qifčāq say xayu ‘which’ instead of the “Turks’ ” qayu and xïzïm ‘my daughter’ instead of qïzïm. According to Róna-Tas 1982: 163, the ivefold mention of the term xa ïŋ ‘birch tree’ (< Old Turkic kadïŋ) by Ibn Fadlān, the caliphate’s ambassador to the Volga Bolgarians, is evidence for 10th century Volga Bolgarian #xa-. Ibn Fadlān, however, uses this term irst when describing the section of his itinerary between the lands of the Oguz and of the
67 Róna-Tas (personal communication), comparing Hungarian hal and Finnish kala
(both ‘ish’), points out that fricativization might be an areal phenomenon: he Hungar
ians lived in this area before moving further West. Cf. also Róna-Tas 1993: 295–6.

Pecheneg (fol. 202b), before reaching the Bashgird and, in May 922, the Volga Bulgarians; it therefore cannot serve as certain evidence for the language of these latter.68 As shown in Erdal 2004: 75–78, the fricative realization of the back allophone of /k/ was possible and is attested in Old Turkic as well, though evidence is in many ways far from clear. Early Mongolic does not generally fricativize the back velar voiceless consonant, although parts of it do (see Doerfer 1965, introduction). q > x at the end of a word is attested in Ïtax, the Khazar personal name interpreted in Erdal 1991a as coming from ït ‘dog’ plus the diminutive suix -Ak. he same sound process is, indeed, attested in Volga Bolgarian xïrx ‘forty’, t(i)w(ï)x(+čï) ‘chicken (seller)’ and the personal name Amrax (< amra-k ‘dear’) attested as a proper name also in Anatolia (Erdal 1993: 115). On the other hand, however, x appears in variants of forms with q in the Codex Comanicus (e.g. yox ‘there isn’t’, yolux- ‘to meet’ or yarux ~ yarïx ‘bright, light’; so this is—again—no proof by itself.
So what is the result of the application of the mentioned criteria for the classiication of Khazar? he criteria (a), (e), (f) and (g) and B evidence are all inconclusive; the application of the (b) criterion would speak against the inclusion of the language of the Khazars into the BolgarChuvash branch, especially if čavïš-yïgar is the correct reading for a word for which nothing convincing has been proposed otherwise. (c) is inconclusive unless this same term is taken into consideration, and this term would tend to speak against it. With (d) there might be conlicting evidence if Golden is right with his proposal to read a title spelled as b’k as yelig; if this idea is rejected, evidence is against inclusion. Summing up all this, one would state that overall evidence would be slightly against the inclusion point of view. However, there could also have been diferent Khazar dialects with isogloss proiles difering in points of which we are, at present, able to detect only a few: Perhaps there was a diachronic, contact-related development towards, or away, from the Bolgar branch; or perhaps, inally, Khazar occupied intermediate positions with respect to these isoglosses.
68 Cf. Togan 1939: 211–215. In a personal communication, Prof. Róna-Tas points out
to me that Ibn Fadlān got his data from his interpreters and not from the people he met,
and “that a Bulgar was in the embassy”. In view of other evidence on the fricativization
of the onset back-vowel velar, the presence of a Bulgar member in the group cannot
guarantee that the name of a tree had an exclusively Bolgar shape, to the exclusion of
other possible sources for Ibn Fadlān’s rendering.

4. The geniza mss. Cambridge T-S (Glass) 12.122 and T-S Misc. 35.38
Let us now turn to Golb & Pritsak 1982, which contains Golb’s edition of two medieval Hebrew mss., one a plea to help a certain Jew who had gotten into material troubles, the other an account of a part of Khazar history seen from a Jewish perspective. What invites our scrutiny is Pritsak’s ‘Altaistic’ commentary to the edition of the two mss., and historical notes based on his opinions on the ‘Altaic’ words he purported to have discovered. he texts are presented in the work as new sources disclosing unknown Khazar language material. Most reviews about this book were written by Judaists or by specialists of Eastern European history, who took Pritsak’s competence in historical Turkic linguistics for granted. Not that everybody agreed with all aspects of Golb’s interpretation. S. Schwarzfuchs, e.g., pointed out two problems: Firstly, that the Hebrew text actually does not say “we, the community of Kiev, inform you of the troublesome afair” etc., as translated by Golb, but “we inform you, the community of Kiev, of the troublesome afair . . .”.69 It would seem, therefore, that the letter was not sent from Kiev but to Kiev, putting all conclusions drawn from it concerning the Khazars and the history of Kiev on very shaky feet. It might then be appealing to the community of Kiev for help by mentioning that other Jewish communities were also being called upon to do so. Below we actually mention one linguistic reason why the letter may have been sent from a place where the language spoken was not Khazar.
69 his is the meaning of (modi im anu laxem kahal
šel Kiyov), which Golb (p. 6) calls “troublesome” and a “seemingly peculiar syntactic
structure”; this is quite normal Hebrew, however, unless one tries to make it mean
what it does not mean. Golb’s arguments (spread over half a quarto page) against the
straightforward interpretation (that the letter was addressed to the community of Kiev)
can be summed up as follows: 1) “he letter contains pleas for aid . . . addressed to all
‘holy communities scattered to all (the world’s) corners . . ., and one does not ind in the
Genizah circular letters of this kind addressed to Jewish communities in general, which
thereater single out a particular community.” 2) he bearer of the letter evidently ended
up in Fustāt, (the name of old Cairo) and not Kiev. 3) Formulating the sentence so as
to give the intended meaning would have been “quite inadmissible in Hebrew literary
style”, because “proper Hebrew sentence structure . . . calls for the verb in the initial posi
tion”. he irst and second arguments cannot override what the text actually says, though
we do not know why the ms. ended up in Egypt; that there is nothing similar in the
Cairo Geniza may just be a coincidence. he third argument is clearly not true: While
classical Hebrew style prefers the verb to be in initial position, one would not do that at
the price of getting the wrong meaning across.



96 marcel erdal
he second problem which Schwarzfuchs had with the text was the idea that proselytes could be kohanim and leviim, appellatives which are believed to be inherited in patrilinear fashion since biblical times.70 he “sacerdotal metamorphosis” of kams (Turkic shamans) to kohanim of which Golb (p. 32) speaks would, I believe, be unparalleled in Jewish history and seems quite unlikely to me. he conclusion would be that the document’s signatories (or their fathers mentioned within their patronyms) who have non-Jewish names would not be Khazars converted to Judaism but Jews who adopted non-Jewish names. We know that this happened everywhere and quite a lot since antiquity, e.g. with the name Kalonymos, which is a Greek compound. his is also the view held by Torpusman (1989: 51), a specialist in East European onomastics who dealt with the names; he quotes several examples for Eastern European Jews bearing non-Jewish names throughout history.71 In his opinion, the non-Jewish names of this document are likely to be Slavic and not Turkic; this would again, I think, make the Khazars vanish from the letter. Orjol 1997 has shown that one of the names, if not two, is indeed Slavic.72 Golden 1984: 481 says he is “disturbed by the lack of any but the most skimpy data” for Pritsak’s reconstruction of Kievan history. He further points at a 110 years’ period between the person supposed to be the ‘wazīr’ of Kiev in 940–950 and his father, whom Pritsak believes to have been active in 833, and tries to solve the problem by assuming a patronym to be a clan name. On the same page Golden states that “the appearance of the runiform inscription in the Kievan letter, regarded by Golb & Pritsak as an oicial stamp of approval by Khazar authorities, necessitates, in light of the dating of the document, a new chronology for Kievan Rus’ history. . . . his constitutes a very substantial revision of the chronology of the Povest’ vremennyx let . . .”.
70 DNA research of recent years has been said to show with a very high degree of
certainty that extraneous elements among Jewish kohanim are as low as 0.5%. Much of
the controversial discussion around this topic is relected in the internet site http://www.
khazaria.com/genetics/abstracts.html.
71 I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Peter Golden, who made Torpusman’s
paper (as well as his own review of the book) available to me.
72 Erdal 1993: 133 (footn. 237) already points out that nothing in the text indicates
that its authors were Khazars.

4.1. he ‘runiform’ recognitio
he attention of the review article of Ligeti (1981) is mainly directed towards a short note appearing at the very end of one of these texts: a sequence of what can, by and large, be interpreted as Eastern Turkic runic characters, by Pritsak read as hokurüm and translated as ‘I have read’. he interpretation of this recognitio, although placed into an admittedly plausible textual and historical context, is not without problems: he last character of the word is far from being a normal runiform m, which would have to consist of two pairs of parallel lines meeting on the right edge of the letter; the character could also be read as a front k, giving ök or ük for the third syllable of the word. Furthermore, the irst character is only hypothetically taken to be the ligature of a Semitic he with the runic character for o or u which is in fact reminiscent of a wāw. For this character, Pritsak refers to a sign appearing in the fragment of a lapidary, written in runiform characters and published by homsen, 1910. homsen inds this to be an Aramaic he used as the numeral ‘5’ (as still done nowadays, e.g. in Hebrew). What could have a shape similar to the numeral in homsen’s ‘Blatt’ is the whole of the irst character in the last word of the Geniza ms., however, and not just its rightmost half; under that comparison of letters the reading therefore ought to be hakurüm and not *hokurüm.73 Ligeti 1981: 12 expresses his expectation of a in the irst syllable not on palaeographical grounds, as I do, but on comparative grounds. he word has been quoted over and again by Turcologists, who agree that it shows the passage from d to r typical for the Bolgar-Chuvash branch of Turkic. I have pointed out (Erdal 1993: 133) that hoqu- would, if it has been read correctly, it in well with the prehistoric reconstruction of the verb oqï- ‘to call out, recite, read’.74 In case the letter should have been sent to Kiev, as the Hebrew text actually says, and not from Kiev, it could, e.g., come from the Danube Bolgar realm which lourished on the lower Danube till the 10th century. In that case the censor’s note would be evidence for Bolgar and not for Khazar! We should add that the 7th century Khazar word tudun
73 Actually, the vertical line on the right side of the irst character looks much weaker
and lighter than the rest of it; if it is just an accidental stain of the parchment, this irst
syllable would have to be read as äl. In sum, among the six runiform signs, only the third
one is wholly beyond doubt.
74 Ligeti is doubtful of the h, expecting a w instead if the language was of the Bolgar
Chuvash type; I am not, in view of the early date of Khazar.

had not changed intervocalic d to r;75 Khazar may possibly never have carried out this sound change. his would be further indication against Khazaria as source of the letter if, again, the reading r can be upheld.76 In Danubian Bolgar, on the other hand, d should have become r already in the irst half of the 9th century, if my interpretation of the Nagyszentmiklós inscription in Greek letters (Erdal 1988) is correct. he DanubeBolgarian state may possibly have been the realm from which the letter was sent, as it apparently wasn’t sent from Kiev. Volga Bolgarian /d/ > /r/ is documented for 1230 (the title turun mentioned in a Slavic chronicle) and directly attested in the late 13th century, and I take this phonetic change to be a common Bolgarian feature: hat it should have taken place among diferent Bolgarian groups at diferent points in time seems to be less likely.77 If one directly connects the change to /z/ evidenced by Hungarian búza < Turkic buγδay ‘wheat’, this would indicate that the Hungarians either borrowed this term at a still earlier date, or that it came from a Turkic language which had not changed the voiced dental to /r/ at least ater /g/.78 Ligeti 1981: 17 points to a third circumstantial problem arising from the ‘Khazar hypothesis’ (in addition to the two problems brought up by Schwarzfuchs): He asks whether it could be considered a mere coincidence that on a Hebrew letter of the Khazars the recognitio (analogous to legi ‘I have read’ on Latin documents; similarly in Byzantine sources) is not worded in the language of the letter. “Everything”, he says, “points to the existence of a Hebrew language chancellery with the Khazars; . . . on the basis of the available information it seems hardly likely that a Khaz
75 here are a number of examples in Greek sources and one in an Armenian source,
all referred to in Golden 1980: 215.
76 Golden’s (1984: 477) doubts concerning the reading of this word are also related to
the chronology of the d > r shit, but then the reading need not be doubted if the text is
not Khazar anyway.
77 he ablative suix +rAn irst appears in a Volga Bolgarian inscription dated to
1281, erne küen ‘Friday’ < Persian ādīna ‘Friday’ + Turkic kün ‘day’ in one from 1297; see
Erdal 1993. I have stated above why Ibn Fadlān’s use of xaδïŋ cannot serve as evidence
for Volga Bolgarian.
78 toγdak is usually taken to be the source of Hungarian túzok ‘bustard’, thus giving
another possible -z- < -γd- change. Concerning this word one should, however, con
sider that it is, in fact, not attested before the Bābur-nāme: he original Turkic word
for bustard is tōd, irst documented by Kāšġarī, who says that it is pronounced as toy by
those Turks who change [d] to [y]. toγdak might, in view of its late attestation in Turkic,
have been adopted from Mongolic, where it appears in a number of dialects. Hungarian
nyögér < nöker ‘comrade’, e.g., shows that it was perfectly possible for Mongolic loans to
reach Hungarian.

arian language chancellery would ever have functioned alongside with, or prior to it.” We might add that Jews have, up to the 20th century, used the Hebrew alphabet also when writing all the other languages they spoke throughout their history, Aramaic, Syriac and Neo-Aramaic, Ottoman Turkish, Krymchak and Karay Turkic, Persian, Arabic, Greek, Italian, French, Yiddish and their variety of Spanish (Judezmo). he chancellery of the Jewish state of the Khazars is therefore also likely to have used Hebrew writing even if the oicial language was a Turkic one. he letter ought to have originated in a diferent state, therefore, one not having adopted a monotheistic religion. If the runiform expression was “an oicial stamp of approval” by “authorities” of a diferent country, no revision of the accepted chronology or the known course of history becomes necessary.
4.2. he proper names in the Geniza documents
he only Turcologist who cared to comment on Pritsak’s treatment of the non-Semitic names and appellatives in Hebrew characters appearing in the two medieval Hebrew documents edited by Golb appears to have been Golden; others may not have taken Pritsak’s seemingly erudite linguistic speculations, which unfortunately very oten bent and twisted information to suit the argument, quite seriously. Golden’s (1984) review article, invited by the Harvard Ukrainian Studies79 is rather critical though treading quite carefully in its wording. It raises a number of important points not touched upon in the present paper; I will deal only with a few of these words which are relevant to linguistic matters. Among the signatories of the irst letter, the account of Golb & Pritsak (1982: 40) for the name ( ywsf br [= son of] qwfyn) must unfortunately be called unserious: Pritsak states it to be identical with the name of the Kuban river, called ο by the 6th century Byzantine author Menandros Protector and, further, to the name of a Bolgar tribal group which, in the 7th century, roamed the territory between the river Don and the Caucasus, called Kup‘i Bulgar. Why somebody should bear the name of a tribe and/or of a river is not stated: he ‘explanation’ is exclusively based on sound similarity.80
79 his journal was not otherwise concerned with the Turkic world though it was
close to Prof. Pritsak—who was a Ukrainian activist in the United States.
80 By the way, Pritsak uses the name of the Kuban river also in his account of a word
read as ( βm) in the second text, which was previously edited by Schechter.

Another one of the signatories is (šmšwn yhwdh hmxwnh swrth). Pritsak derives this last word from the name of the Sabirs which, he says, were actually called Säwär, Säbir or Sävir.81 he last two letters ( t and h) he assigns to a suix -tei which he inds in the “Bolgarian” name Bülertei referred in Jusupov 1960: 10682 and in Mongolian. he suix +tAi is, indeed, very common in Mongolian, where it corresponds to the Turkic suix +lXg. It does not, however, exist in Turkic (though it is, of course, found in some names of Central Asian places now inhabited by Turks); even if the Turkic and the Mongol language families should, in the future, prove to be related (as some scholars think they are), it would still not be admissible to try to interpret a Turkic word as containing this suix unless one should assume borrowing. Such borrowing would, of course, be possible from the 13th century on, when the Mongols overran Eastern Europe. his also means that the Volga-Bolgarian and the Kïpchak inscriptions (which are included in Jusupov 1960 alongside each other) could have shown this suix, as they were inscribed under Mongol rule. his law in Pritsak’s reasoning, the ‘solution’ of early Eastern European riddles through recourse to Mongolian, is common to many of his imaginative etymologies. In the relevant centuries Mongols are, I think, unlikely to have moved outside the zone extending from Southern Manchuria and Northern Mongolia.83 he presence of any Mongolian population in Eastern Europe or in the Caucasus should not be assumed for this time, and the possibility of a genetic connection between the two language
must be the name of a political entity: It is mentioned in one series with the name
Maqedōn, no doubt referring to the Byzantine empire which was, throughout the 10th
century, reigned by the Macedonian dynasty. he word can, I think, hardly receive any
interpretation, as it is preceded by a lacuna and corresponds to no known name. Pritsak,
undaunted, says that the ayin was “erroneously used for Persian ghayin, which in turn
was used to render foreign q. he name”, he adds, “was not Persian in origin but taken
over by the Persians from the Kuban Bulgars.” He further states that it was a typical fea
ture in the Huno-Bolgarian group”, as he calls the Chuvash-Bolgar branch, “that the inal
n ater labials develops into m. herefore,” according to him, “it becomes clear that
of the Schechter text goes back to an original *Qubam, (< Quban).” here are so many
unwarranted ad hoc assumptions in this line of thought that it would be a great waste of
space and time to discuss them.
81 See n. 2 on p. 35 of the book for references to works explaining whom Pritsak actu
ally had in mind, and Golden 1992: 104–106 for further information about this tribe.
82 Jusupov actually reads the name as Būlārtāj, as the vowels are spelled with wāw
and alif respectively.

be known about the earliest groups speaking Mongolic or ‘Para-Mongolic’ idioms.

groups does not warrant the transference of linguistic elements beyond what can be reconstructed as common heritage. As it is, three other explanations for this word are much more likely: One of these is connecting it with the people called by the 10th century Byzantine emperor and author Konstantinos Porphyrogennitos, Sevordik’ in Armenian and Sawardiyah in Arabic sources, who have been identiied with the Hungarians by Berta 199284 and should not be confused with the Sabirs.85 Orjol 1997 proposes an ‘emendation’ of the word leading him to a Slavic name. However, no emendation is necessary: he expression (hmxwnh = ha-mexune)86 makes us expect a (kinuy), a nickname, and not some national ailiation; this is the only appearance of (mexune) ‘nicknamed’ in the text. Looking at the word without Altaic preconceptions, I would suggest reading it as Germanic: swartä means ‘the black one’ i.e. ‘the dark one’ in Gothic and in early Scandinavian.87 I feel this to be quite a viable proposal, considering the Gothic and Rus’ presence of long standing in that part of Eastern Europe. Some Gothic was, ater all, spoken on the Crimea even in the 16th century (as documented by Ghislain de Busbecq, French ambassador to Istanbul in 1555–62), when this and all other Eastern Germanic languages had long died out everywhere else. Let us now turn to another non-Semitic patronymic, that of (gwstt,’ br kyβr khn). Pritsak (pp. 36–37) connects this with Kavaroi, the name of a tribe which, according to Porphyrogennitos, joined the Proto-Hungarians somewhere on the Pontic steppe, and further with a word appearing in the Arabic translation of the Sefer Yosippon.88 According to that book, one of the sons of Togarma, the son
84 He analyses this as sav, which he takes to come from sag ‘right’, + art ‘the back side’
+ 3rd person possessive suix, and translates the whole phrase as ‘Hinter-dem-rechten
Flügel’, i.e. ‘behind the right wing’. Such an analysis is, I think, unlikely in Turkic, as a
postposition signifying ‘behind’ would not be art+ı but art+ın+da. he phrase consist
ing of the three elements postulated by Berta might instead signify ‘the back part of the
right one’. Moreover, there is no evidence that the sound change aγ > av had already
taken place at such an early date.
85 he interpretation of this term in Bata 1996 is not less acceptable than Berta’s, and
probably less adventurous.
86 he two are from the same verbal root, mexune being the present passive participle,
kinuy a verbal noun.
87 Cf. e.g. den sorte ‘the black one’ in Danish; in standard Modern German the inal t
of the stem has turned into an africate, giving der Schwarze.

of Japheth (i.e. in Genesis!), was called Turki, or, in some mss. of the Sefer Yosippon, Turk. Pritsak says that Harkavi 1874: 300 noted that one of the mss. of an Arabic translation of this book replaces this Turk(i) by a word written as (thus, k yr!). his form Pritsak wants to read as Kiábar, which would contradict all orthographic practice; this, in turn, he takes to be the patronymic found in the Hebrew letter, and also the source of the patronymic Yuvārī found in one or perhaps in two of the Volga Bolgarian grave inscriptions (Erdal 1993). Early *Kāvar, with a long vowel in the irst syllable, would indeed give *Kyavar in Volga Bolgarian, but Yuvārī, which we have there, cannot go back to such a form: *Kyavar would give Yuvar in Modern Chuvash but not in Volga Bolgarian. So Pritsak commits several philological and linguistic errors: He mixes up the stages in the development of a language by an error of about 500 years; he proposes an arbitrary change in the reading of a manuscript from which he did not have an edition but only saw a stray quote; the ms. which he refers to, without mentioning when it might have been written, is only the translation of a source which, itself, has the name of the eponymous ancestor of the Turks; this obscure ms. variant is, inally, taken to have been adopted as somebody’s proper name, although such a practice is not known to have existed. So much for the name of ’s father. Pritsak assumes -ta, the last syllable of the proper name of ‘the kohen’ himself, to be the same Mongolian suix which he thought he had already identiied at the end of (swrth). his Mongolian suix means ‘having’ (like English -ed in words like bearded or spectacled ) or, as Pritsak wanted his readers to believe, “belonging to”. he irst part he identiied as the name of a Pecheneg governor in the 9th century, called , as quoted again by Konstantinos Porphyrogennitos. he reason the name of the ruler (whom Pritsak calls ‘governor’) was in the document spelled with a g and not with a k was, he says, that Greek used the letter gamma to express fricative gh and not a stop; the s, he adds, was dropped because of the suix. ! is, of course, a very common Greek name, as Moravcsik, Pritsak’s source, states; the inal s is the Greek nominative suix: his is the shortened variant of , the name borne by the emperor and author himself. *Kostata must in fact have been the intermediate form between these two stages of Greek historical development, subsequently shortened by haplology; Orjol 1997 shows that the variant with initial g is, indeed, attested as a Slavic name in the 11th–12th centuries. In this case, then, Pritsak could be right in having mentioned the name of the Pecheneg ruler; he was only unaware



the khazar language 103
of (or disregarded) its Greek and, of course, ultimate Latin origin. We already stated above why the Mongolic suix -tA(i) is unlikely to have appeared here; the notion that it could have been added to a personal name to form another personal name is in any case quite unnecessary, as the two-syllable variant must have had a three-syllable predecessor. Torpusman 1989 points out these and other internal contradictions in Pritsak’s position and quotes this and similar names from Slavic sources of the 9th–17th centuries. He has a diferent, Slavic etymology for the name, as being an *-ent- derivate from gost’ ‘guest’; this etymology is just as convincing as the Greek one. he two other proper names of this document which Pritsak attempts to explain are (mns), which appears as a patronym, and (mnr), the name of one of the signatories himself. Both of these start with the sequence (mn) which, according to Pritsak, represent the word man, meaning ‘great’ (a word dealt with by Prof. Róna-Tas in several papers). MNS, Pritsak (p. 40) says, ”transmits Altaic (Bolgarian group) /äs/, also with the meaning ‘great’, as attested, for example, in the title Attila (< Ästila). In the Chuvash language the form mănas (< mān äs) is attested in fact.” However, there is no mănas in Chuvash; only mănaś, which means ‘proud’ or ‘haughty’, and Chuvash /ś/ never comes from s. Chuvash does have a noun as, which indeed comes from Common Turkic äs, but it means ‘mind, remembrance’. As to be expected, Pritsak’s etymology for the name of Attila, irst proposed in 1956, has not gained acceptance;89 his suggestion for MNS is equally imaginary. MNR, inally, is supposed to be read as Man är, which would mean ‘great man’. his is the only one among Pritsak’s proposals for the irst document which might be acceptable, although the expression ‘great man’ is hardly attested as a proper name. Even in the case that Man-är is a correct explanation of the name and is Khazar, that also does not help us much towards deciding what sort of a Turkic language the Khazars spoke: he word man does today survive mainly in Chuvash, but once was in use in other Turkic languages as well.
89 It is generally agreed (as set forth by such authorities on the Huns as Otto Maenchen
Helfen) that the name is a Germanic diminutive, also attested e.g. as the name of an
Anglo-Saxon bishop.

4.3. he ‘Khazar’ words in the Schechter document
he Khazar words in the second document, before Golb & Pritsak edited also by Schechter and then Kokovcov, are discussed already in Golden 1980. Most of Pritsak’s interpretations of non-Khazar elements in this second Hebrew text, names of places, nations and states, are doubtful as they involve arbitrary emendations, but do not concern us here. What does concern us are those cases where he invoked Bolgar-Chuvash language history, Hunno-Bolgar as he called it, to support his etymologies. First, the name of the Khazar city of Xamlïx, which was somewhere on the lower Volga (perhaps near its estuary on the Caspian Sea), where the Khazar ruler used to take a tithe from merchants using the river: Pritsak (p. 153 f.) disqualiied previous accounts, one of which is the derivation from xan balïx, ‘the ruler’s city’ (over an assimilated *Xambalïx); another possible etymology proposed by Róna-Tas is mentioned above. Pritsak instead suggested deriving the name from the early Slavic designation of the Caspian, which was Xvalis’skoe More. Xvalis’ was, he believed, a compound, consisting of As, the name of an early Central Asian people mentioned in the sources, plus Xvali. Since the Turks did not have the cluster xv initially, he stated, they changed this name to Xali, added the ‘Altaic’ collective suix +an, giving *xalin; then, according to sound laws documented in Chuvash, they dropped the l before the n and then changed this inal n to m, giving Xam. Again, there are numerous errors here; the dropping of /l/ in Chuvash must be a recent phenomenon, e.g., which was in any case more recent than the emergence of inal m where the other Turkic languages have n; the collective suix +an is rare in Mongol as it is in Turkic, is nowhere added to foreign words and is not productive in Bolgaro-Chuvash.90 Another case where Pritsak was led astray by the Altaic hypothesis is the shape of the name of the city Sarïgšïn. He irst (p. 152) arbitrarily proposed a reading Sarïgčïn with the argument that the Arabic script uses šīn to write the sound [č],91 then assigned the last syllable to a Mongol feminine suix, added to Turkic sarïg ‘yellow’. In fact, while early

rate argumentation says: “his hypothesis is not defendable”.
91 he sound /t∫/ did not exist in Arabic; since Arabs did not pronounce this sound,
they had no need to write it either. When it occurred in words they borrowed, they oten
simpliied it to /∫/ i.e. š, which then also appears in the spelling of their borrowings.
here is no reason to believe in the existence of such a process among speakers (and
writers) of other languages.

Mongolian did distinguish gender, no early Turkic ever did; this happens to be an important typological diference between these two language groups. he Turkic suix +šIn is always used with colour words: Cf. Turkish and Azeri sarışın ‘blonde’; Korkmaz 2003: 66 also mentions akşın, gökşin, karaşın and mavişin. kökčin ‘greyish, greybeard’, frequently attested in the Qutadgu Bilig, no doubt comes from the same formation: kökšin ‘bluish, greenish’ is attested twice in the DLT.92 Since +šIn is in fact attested as a Turkic suix, there is no need to involve Mongolic for the explanation of this name. Summing up, etymologies trying to explain Khazar lexemes and sufixes by ofering wholly ad hoc sound processes and taking any language from any period of the Altaic world to be a possible source are unacceptable. Unfortunately, Golb & Pritsak 1982 does not make any direct contribution to knowledge of the Khazar language, although a part of the material made available in exemplary fashion deinitely is an important base for further research on Early East European Jewry. hus, our only hope for getting more information about the Khazar language and its status among the Turkic languages remains the decipherment of the rich inscriptional evidence, a task on which all scholars interested in the question should now concentrate. he article has tried to document all views expressed on the famous “Kievan letter”. One interpretation of this Geniza document which came to the author’s attention only recently is that by the important Hungarian scholar János Harmatta in his paper ‘A magyarok nevei a görög nyelv ̋u forrásokban’ [he names of the Hungarians in Greek sources], which appeared on pp. 119–40 of the volume Honfoglalás es nyelvészet edited by L. Kovács and L. Veszprémy (Budapest 1997). On pp. 136–138 of this paper, Harmatta proposes the reading QHNWB ́ (a well-documented place name in Egypt) for the damaged word read as QYYWB ́ and interpreted as the old name of Kiev by Golb and Pritsak, and locates

on the other hand Kāšġarī’s kül-sir- ‘to smile’ where all other early sources have külčir

as well as karalčïn ‚blackish’ (< kara ‘black’) and kubalčïn ‘pale’ (< kuba) in Kïrghïz, but
these terms might have been borrowed from Mongolic: he suix is there added to

the whole event narrated in the letter in Egypt (where the manuscript was found). He interprets the witnesses’ names, considered to be Khazar by Pritsak, as Iranian, Greek and Egyptian, and reads the note added at the end, which Pritsak considered to be in runiform script, as NorthAfrican rabbinical cursive. This latter point is one on which specialists of North-African rabbinical cursive should express their opinon.

NEW FINDINGS RELATING TO HEBREW EPIGRAPHIC SOURCES FROM THE CRIMEA, WITH AN APPENDIX ON THE READINGS IN KING JOSEPH’S LETTER
Artem Fedorchuk
he purpose of this article is to examine a number of problems relating to Hebrew inscriptions from the Crimean peninsula (Ukraine). he greatest collections of them are found in two Jewish-Karaite cemeteries: in the Josaphat valley outside the “cave-town” of Chufut-Qal eh and in Tabana-Dere outside the “cave-town” of Mangup. he article is focused on the problems related to the Chufut-Qal eh cemetery. he history of research in those cemeteries is closely connected to the name of the Karaite collector and archaeologist Abraham Firkowicz (1787–1874) and with the polemics around his discoveries, which arose in the second half of the 19 century. Firkowicz (and, a decade later, Prof. Daniel Chwolson) found a number of epitaphs which were attributed by them to the irst centuries of the C.E. he results of his research were published by Firkowicz in his book Abney Zikkaron1 in 1872. But these results were called into question by Sh. Rappaport, A. Harkavy, E. Deinard, S. Munk, H.L. Strack, A. Kunik and other scholars, who suspected Firkowicz of having forged all the epitaphs which bore dates earlier than 1240 C.E. and also the colophons on the ancient manuscripts found by him in the Crimea, the Caucasus and the Middle East. According to those accusations, Firkowicz fabricated epitaphs and colophons, especially letters marking the dates, trying to prove the ancient origins of the Crimean Karaites. We are in no position to describe here all the circumstances of the polemics.2 But it is important to point out that many defenders of

Firkowicz’s indings viewed them as sources on the early medieval history of the Northern coast of the Black Sea, including Khazar history. Besides, for many Karaite authors Firkowicz’s work became one of the starting points of the so-called “Khazar theory” of the origins of East-European Karaites, although Firkowicz himself had never made such claims.

On the other hand, although the critics of Firkowicz had pointed to a great number of contradictions in his statements, up to now, despite many doubts about the authenticity of some dates of the epitaphs, there was no direct evidence of Firkowicz’s forgeries, and many statements of his critics also contained a great deal of contradictions (the main contradiction was between his supposed acts and his supposed goals). But now we have new sources which can shed light on some of these problems. In 1998 I found the drats of Abney Zikkaron which are kept in Firkowicz’s private archive at the Russian National Library (RNL) in Saint-Petersburg (formerly, the Imperial Public Library).3 Beside many fragments, these are two MSS in folio written approximately in 1847–8, one of them4 earlier than the other,5 both of them containing several hundred epitaphs collected by Firkowicz in Chufut-Qal eh (in topographical order as well as in chronological order), Mangup, Solkhat (Solxat, EskiQırım), Eupatoria (Jevpatorija, Gözleve) and heodosia (Feodosija, Kafa, Kefe, Capha). Actually, it is a mystery why these documents were neglected by A. Harkavy—who was for half a century the supervisor of Firkowicz’s MSS collection at the Imperial Public Library—and by other scholars, because these documents provide us with direct evidence of Firkowicz’s forgeries. Moreover, a comparison of these drats with the published text of Abney Zikkaron in many cases enables us to understand the way Firkowicz changed the epitaphs or their dates. he most arrant example of these changes is the epitaph of Esther, daughter of Shelomo, which was oten mentioned in the literature on the subject. his is the only epitaph containing a reference to the so called Matharchean era. It was, according to Firkowicz, the notion used for the regular era from the Creation of the World in the Crimea in the second half of the irst millennium of the C.E. (allegedly, this era was borrowed by the Crimean Jews from those living in the city of Matarcha, on the Taman Peninsula as it is called in Russian). According to Firkowicz, it replaced the so called Ancient Crimean era, which was allegedly 151 years longer that the regular era from the Creation. he text of the epitaph in Abney Zikkaron (No 37)6 is as follows:

'' ' '
'''
he irst to express doubts about this epitaph was A. Kunik.7 In 1862, when Gabriel Firkowicz (son-in-law of Abraham) had shown him the copy of the epitaph, Kunik told him that, from his point of view, the handwriting changed in the middle of the sixth line. G. Firkowicz agreed and added that they [the Firkowiczes] “hadn’t noticed it”. Besides, A. Kunik thought that Firkowicz changed the irst date from ' ' ' ', 5136 (i.e., 1376 C.E.) into ' ' ' ', 536 (i.e., 776 C.E.; or, according to Firkowicz, 625, taking into account the Matarchean era) replacing by (it was the most widespread way of Firkowicz’s forgeries). Later A. Harkavy and H.L. Strack expressed similar views regarding this epitaph. Besides, they held that Firkowicz changed into in the forth line (and that the real date was 1476 C.E.), and also added a line and a half, ater the eulogy. On the other hand, D. Chwolson pointed out that the handwriting did, indeed, change, but in the forth and not in the sixth line. We are in no position to study the epitaph itself, because it (together with another eight epitaphs) was sawed of by Firkowicz in 18638 and removed to the Asian Museum in Saint-Petersburg,9 where all of them were lost during the World War II. But the version of the epitaph found in Firkowicz’s drat gives us the possibility to solve this problem. his is the text of the epitaph in the drat:10

his is the tombstone of Mrs. Ester, daughter of Shelomo, which I have put near her head, who died in the year 636—may her soul be bound in the bond of life—from the Creation.
So we can see that the last line (not the line and a half, as Kunik, Harkavy, and Strack held) including the mention of the Matarchean era was added to the epitaph by Firkowicz (as well as the change of into in the date in the forth line; the same change was made in the epitaph No. 38 in Abney Zikkaron—' ' ' ' in the drat11 and ' ' ' ' in the book).12 Let us also point out, however, that some diferences between the two versions of the epitaph were simply the results of mistakes made during rewriting ( instead of , instead of , and instead of ), and there were also some mistakes in the epitaph itself (according to the drat): instead of , instead of , and instead of (the last one had been “corrected” by Firkowicz in the book).13 here are 55 epitaphs in Abney Zikkaron which, from Firkowicz’s point of view, bore the dates which must be calculated according to the Ancient Crimean era. But in the drats the situation is completely diferent. his era is absent in the earliest one, and in the latest one there are only 11 such epitaphs. hese are epitaphs No. 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, and 25 in Abney Zikkaron. heir dates (according to C.E.) in the book and in the latest drat (in the brackets dates according to the earliest drat are given) are as follows: 92 (243), 150 (301), 180 (331), 219 (370), 279 (430), 280 (431), 286 (437), 292 (443), 305 (456), 305 (456), 369 (520). As for the dates of other epitaphs, which were calculated in Abney Zikkaron according to the Ancient Crimean era, in the drats they were calculated according to the regular Jewish era from the Creation. hese

Now we shall turn to the so called era from our exile which, according to Firkowicz, began in 696 B.C.E. (he regarded this date as the date of the exile from Samaria).22 here are only ive epitaphs in the Abney Zikkaron referring to this era. Four of these ive epitaphs were, according to Firkowicz, the oldest ones in the cemetery (No. 1–702, No. 2–726, No. 3–751, No. 4–785, and also No. 25–1065). he epitaphs No. 4 and No. 25 bear the dates from the Creation (the ancient Crimean one, from Firkowicz’s point of view) as well, that enabled Firkowicz to calculate the diference between the two. In the drats there is only one of them, which, as Firkowicz wrote, was dated back to the 6 C.E. and so was the

21 his epitaph, as well as the epitaph No. 3, was found by Firkowicz in 1865. See MSS Dep. of RNL, 946:1:123. 22 However, Firkowicz hesitated regarding the exact value of this date and was calculating it diferently in diferent periods of his life. For the evidence of Firkowicz’s own disbelief in this era, cf. D. Shapira, “From ‘Our Exile’ to Sichem: Abraham Firkowicz
visits the Samaritans”, Cathedra 104 (June 2002), pp. 85–94 [Hebrew].

most ancient one in the cemetery (although Firkowicz gave other dates for this epitaph elsewhere). In the book it looks as follows:23
his is the sign of Buqi, son of Isaac Kohen, may he rest in Eden. Time of the deliverance of Israel, year 702 from our exile
''
'' '
In the latest drat the primary version of this epitaph is as follows:24
...' ' ' ...' ' ...
. . . of Isaac Kohen [may he rest in Eden] . . . [. . .]srael, year 702 from our exile.
Ater the epitaph there is a marginal note in which Firkowicz wrote that he had read the epitaph this way in 1846, but in 1856 he had made a paper cast (“ater the request of the academicians from Saint-Petersburg”, as he wrote) and had been able to read more.25 hen the text comes, which we can see in the book. Besides, the date according to the Common Era, indicated on the margin, was obviously changed from 147 (we have no idea how to explain this igure) into 6. As for the second epitaph which bears the date according to the era from our exile, it does not exist in the earliest drat, and in the latest one we can ind it out in the chronological list only, while in the topographical list there is a lacuna in place of the epitaph, although there is the date 30 on the margin. But, under the marginal note mentioned above (which follows ater the epitaph of Buqi) Firkowicz for some reason wrote the text which was later included by him into the Abney Zikkaron. he epitaphs No. 326 and No. 4 (in the book) are absent in the drats. As for the epitaph No. 25,27 it contains only the date from the Creation, while the date from our exile doesn’t exist in the version of this epitaph presented in the drats. hus, we can come to the conclusion that all these eras were actually made up by Firkowicz, and became a part of his “system of antiquities.”

One of the most important arguments of Firkowicz’s advocates was the fact that ater his death D. Chwolson (in 1878 and 1881) and N. Babalikashvili (in 1980s) had found in Chufut-Qal eh a number of epitaphs supposedly belonging to the seventh—thirteenth centuries (Chwolson) and to the tenth-eleventh centuries C.E. (Babalikashvili), which were not included in the Abney Zikkaron. But some of these epitaphs (20 out of 40 published by Chwolson and 2 out of 9 published by Babalikashvili) were found in the drats, so the argument that Firkowicz never saw them and had no possibility to fabricate the dates, does not hold water. Here is, for example, the epitaph, which was, according to Chwolson, the most ancient one (save for several fragments) found by him and not previously found by Firkowicz. As Chwolson thought, it was dated back to 613 C.E.:28
David 4373 from the Creation
In Firkowicz’s drats there is an epitaph, which is almost identical with this one:29
...
his epitaph is dated back to 593 C.E., but this kind of confusion, as a confusion of and , which we can see in the date, is quite understandable.30 Let us also look at one of the epitaphs discovered by Babalikashvili:31
his is the tombstone of R. Abraham, may his memory be blessed, son of R. Isaac, the elder, may he rest in Eden; died hursday, year 757 from the Creation, may his soul be bound in the bond of life.

new findings relating to hebrew epigraphic 117
In Firkowicz’s drats we can see the following epitaph:32
' '' '' '' ' ' ' ' '' ''' '
It is almost identical (save for two words) with the epitaph published by Babalikashvili. All these examples are direct evidence that Firkowicz did forge the Crimean epitaphs. But we could not ind in the drats a single fact that would conirm the most important accusation, namely, that Firkowicz changed into and so made the epitaphs 600 years older that they were. It was stated that the bulk of Firkowicz’s forgeries were accomplished using this simple technique. However, the examples quoted here prove that Firkowicz did make corrections in a number of epitaphs, having changed the dates and having built on that ground his “system of antiquities”.
***
However, the inal answer to the question of the correct dating of the inscriptions and the scale of changes that Firkowicz made to the epitaphs could not be given until the total documentation of Chufut-Qal eh cemetery was completed. his task has been fulilled by a scholarly group organized by the International Center for Jewish Education and Field Studies, which carried out between 2004 and 2006 several epigraphic expeditions to the Crimea. he catalogue of the cemetery is presently being prepared for publication. he actual situation at the cemetery of Chufut-Qal eh is the following: the total number of inscriptions is approximately 7,000 (or quite close to Firkowicz’s estimate of 1847); of these, approximately 3,400 have epitaphs, many of which (mainly late ones, of the 18th and 19th centuries) are quite extensive. he oldest epitaphs at the cemetery date back to 1364 (the monument of Manush, the daughter of Shabbetai) and to 1387. he former is one of three epitaphs which survived from the 14–15th centuries and were not “corrected” by Firkowicz, and it appears in Abney Zikkaron as No. 28833 under the genuine year 1364:

his is the tombstone on the grave of Manush, daughter of Shabbetai, may her soul be bound in the bond of life, in the year 51
24 from the Creation ' ' ' '
As for the inscription of 1387, only the lower part of it has been preserved; including the altered date:
Abraham in the year 547

A comparison with Firkowicz’s book leads us to assume that this inscription is probably that of Sarah, daughter of Abraham (Abney Zikkaron, No. 41),34 which, taking into account the altered and the ancient Crimean era, is dated in the book to 636. Unfortunately, the inscriptions on other monuments of the 14th century can no longer be read due to their poor condition, although some of them can be identiied on the basis of the map of the cemetery, which was made by Firkowicz in the mid-19th century and is preserved in his private archive.35 At present in the cemetery there are also 24 epitaphs of the 15th century and approximately 60 from the 16th century (by comparison in all the Jewish cemeteries of Western Ukraine only 20 epitaphs of the 16th century have been preserved, the oldest one [from 1521] being in the city of Busk), as well as approximately 400 inscriptions from the 17th century. he majority of inscriptions date to the 18th and 19th centuries. he most recent burials at the cemetery took place in the mid 20th century although regular burials there ceased at the end of the 19th century, when the city was inally abandoned. Out of 26 surviving tombstone inscriptions of the 14th–15th centuries (7 of them were preserved only in copies made by Firkowicz and

Chwolson in place of epitaphs that had been sawed out). All but one (Isaac Kohen, 1477) appear in Firkowich’s Abney Zikkaron. However, he dated the large majority of them (22) to much earlier periods. Out of the 564 inscriptions in Abney Zikkaron, more than half has survived. From the surviving epitaphs one can obtain a complete picture of how Firkowicz altered inscriptions. he basic method of alteration used extensively by Firkowicz was quite simple and consisted in adding one short horizon line to the letter which numerically signiies 5000. he addition of that single extra line transforms into , which numerically signiies 400, hence, an inscription becomes 600 years older. In most cases changes of this kind can be discerned by the naked eye. As an example, let us take the epitaph of Hanukkah, the son of Mordechai (Abney Zikkaron, No. 64).36

he deceased was buried in the year 5237 from the Creation, i.e. 1477 C.E. Changing the letter into transforms the date to 637 from the Creation (according to the “defective calculation”), but since 5637 corresponds to the year 1877 C.E., which had not yet arrived at the time that his book was published, Firkowicz dated the inscription to 877. In the inal version of the book Firkowicz dated it, as he did with many other early epitaphs, even earlier (to 726), calculating this date according to the ancient Crimean era. Nevertheless, even quite recently, the epitaph of Hanukkah has been cited in the works about Khazar history (where the name Hanukkah is linked with the same name noted in the letter of Joseph King of the Khazars). As for the earlier mentioned era from our exile, out of the ive epigraphs in which this term allegedly appears only one copy is preserved,

made on the place of the sawed tombstone inscription of the same Buqi, son of Itzhak Kohen. In some epitaphs the date is indicated not in a linear manner but by the chronostichs, most commonly by Biblical excerpts, some letters of which are marked (usually by dots above the letters). he date is found by combining the numerical values of the marked letters. In a number of cases Firkowicz added additional dots to the chronostich in order to alter the date by several centuries. For example, in the epitaph of Abraham, the son of Simkhah (Abney Zikkaron, No. 86),37 he put an additional dot over the letter so that the date “moved backwards” from 1573 to 873. Sometimes Firkowicz did not make changes in the date itself but simply, in cases when the date was indicated according to the “defective calculation”, changed the millennium in the book. For example, the epitaph of Jacob, the son of Josef, who died in 1535 (the text indicates the year 295 from the Creation of the world) is dated by Firkowicz to 535 (Abney Zikkaron, No. 30).38
Occasionally, Firkowicz required a more inventive correction of the text to change the date. Unfortunately, the majority of inscriptions which allegedly belong to the ith millennium and where the date is indicated in words or letters have not been preserved. However, a number of the examples show how the dates were altered. For example, in the 1430 epitaph of Mordechai, the son of Daniel the letter (signifying 5000), is transformed by the alteration of its lower vertical part into the two-letter combination (signifying 4000) (Abney Zikkaron, No. 17).39 Very seldom Firkowicz seems to chisel completely new tombstone inscriptions, especially short ones. hese, for example, were the cases with the famous epitaphs of “Itshak Sangari” (the original inscription was sawed of ) and “Sangarit”,40 and, most likely, with the epitaph of Buqi, the son of Itshak Kohen. Several epitaphs published in Abney Zikkaron apparently did not exist in the cemetery but appeared either in the book or in the drats.

So now, when we know exactly the real dates of all Chufut-Qal eh epitaphs, we can say that they certainly cannot be viewed as authentic sources on Khazar history in any respect.
APPENDIX Some Readings in the King Joseph’s Letter
Another manuscript kept in the Manuscript Department of the Russian National Library is the so called Long Version of the Reply of the Khazar King Joseph to Hisdai ibn Shaprut. hat manuscript [Heb. II B–157] was found by Firkowicz somewhere in the Middle East. It was published twice: in 1879 by A. Harkavy41 and in 1932 by P. Kokovtsov.42 It should be added that in 1871 D. Chwolson published the contents of the Long Version at a Orientalist conference in Russia, but N. Murzakevič, a veteran scholar of Crimean antiquities, protested vigorously, claiming that the texts that came through Firkowicz’s hands are suspicious.43 Ater Kokovtsov very few scholars turned to the study of the manuscript itself. In 1999 I made a brief paleographic survey of the manuscript with the kind assistance by Prof. Shimon Iakerson to whom I am very grateful. According to Prof. S. Iakerson’s opinion, the manuscript efectively belongs to the 13th century, exactly as Kokovtsov thought. I compared the manuscript with the text published by Kokovtsov and realized that his publication was close to being exact. Nevertheless, I have found several mistakes in Kokovtsov’s publication. Some of them seem to be just errata, but occasionally Harkavy’s readings seem to me more plausible. In both cases, I think that all these mistakes should be revised in a new edition of the manuscript. But, there is something else that has not been noticed by the previous publishers of the text, namely several erasures in the manuscript. One of them had been called to notice already in the nineteenth century

43 In the summer of 2004, Ms. Daria Vasyutinski and Dr. Dan Shapira found, at the Jewish Department of the Vernadsky Ukrainian National Library, items belonging to the personal archive of Avraham Harkavy. One item is a thick notebook in Russian and Hebrew containing Harkavy’s remarks on Firkowicz’s manuscripts. In one place Harkavy refers to the Long version and the geographical names mentioned there, hinting that Firkowicz might have reason to not call attention to this text. And indeed, ater the 1871 incident Firkowicz did not attempt to have it published.

But, in the same list of the Crimean localities which were, according to Joseph, under his rule, the manuscript has two additional erasures: one at the end of the name (which renders Kerč) and at the beginning of the name —instead of , which renders Sugdaya, now Sudak) [page 51 line 12 words 5–6 in the MS and page 31 line 19 words 12–13 in Kokovtsov’s edition], and the other one—in the name (which renders Alupka) [page 51 line 13 words 2 in the MS and page 31 line 20 word 4 in Kokovtsov’s edition]. It is very diicult to imagine the reason for these erasures, because they seem to be absolutely meaningless, but they do exist.44
44 In summer 2004, Dr. Dan Shapira found at the Jewish Department of the Vernadsky Ukrainian National Library items belonging to the Firkowicz Personal Archive. Among them was an edition of the Long and Short Versions of the King Joseph’s Letter, prepared by A. Firkowicz (with the Short Version given according to the Warsaw edition, 1864, and containing, in the Long Version, the opening poem by Menahem Ben Saruq).

THE CONVERSION OF THE KHAZARS TO JUDAISM
Peter B. Golden
he Khazar conversion to Judaism, an unusual, but not unique occurrence, must be viewed within several larger contexts. he broadest of these was the conversion of the nomadic, steppe peoples to one or another of the universal religious systems (Judaism, Christianity, Manichaeism, Islam or Buddhism). his was a process that was sometimes, but not exclusively, associated with the further growth and articulation of state structures. Although a divine mandate to conquer and rule was oten part of the Eurasian nomads’ imperial ideology, they did not create any of the great world religions. For these they turned to the sedentary cultures with which they came in contact. Indeed, this is a further example, it has been argued, of their dependence, in the spheres of both material and spiritual culture, on sedentary society. heir choice of religion oten grew out of very immediate, “mundane (rather) than spiritual considerations,” combined with “sound political sense.” Conversion of the elites, especially the ruler, almost always preceded large-scale conversions.1 A somewhat narrower context is that of the struggle by the great agrarian empires of the medieval Mediterranean world to win over to their respective faiths the “heathen barbarian” peoples to their north. More concretely, this meant the struggle of Western and Eastern Christendom and the Muslim Caliphate to convert the Germanic, Slavic and Altaic

steppe peoples. he fourth century conversion of the Goths to a moderate form of Arian Christianity through the activities of Ulilas,2 was the irst of several attempts by Constantinople to reach beyond the Danube using bilingual and bicultural agents. Evaluations of Byzantine success in the Pontic steppes vary. Moravcsik proclaimed Byzantine conversion activity in eighth century Khazaria “remarkably successful.” Although Christian communities could be found in the steppe and immediately adjoining areas of the North Caucasus, successes were sporadic and do not appear to have resulted in mass conversions.3 In this light, Noonan has recently suggested that Byzantium, in fact, did not fare particularly well here.4 One interesting example, of some relevance to the Khazars, is that of the so-called “North Caucasian Huns,” a subject people of the Khazars. In 682, according to Movsês Dasxuranc’i, the Albanian ruler Varaz Trdat sent the Albanian (Ałuanian) bishop Israyêl to the “Huns” to bring them into the Christian fold. he ruler, Ałp Iłut’uêr (Alp Elteber),5 a son-in-law of the Khazar Qağan, “and his army” were converted. he policy was pronounced a success and the Huns were duly proclaimed “allies.”6 We know nothing of the subsequent fate of Christianity among the North Caucasian Huns. Khazar-led attacks into Albania, however, were still a commonplace in the early eighth century. he Alans, an important element of Byzantine diplomacy in Western Eurasia, provide a further illustration of the diiculties. According to al-Mas ûdî, their rulers, previously pagans, had converted to Christianity “during the reign of the Abbâsids.” Ater 320/931–2, however, they drove out the bishops and priests sent to them by Byzantium and abjured

that faith.7 Christianity had greater success in the Slavic lands, imposed, initially, by force of arms in Turko-Slavic Balkan Bulgaria and through a combination of diplomacy, charismatic missionary leadership (Cyrill and Methodius and their followers) and military pressure elsewhere.8 Islam was also not inactive in Western Eurasia. he Abbâsid Caliph al-Ma’mûn (813–833) composed a work to answer the questions of the ruler of the Burğar regarding the Islamic faith. Although there is some debate over the identity of these Burğar (Danubian-Balkan or PonticBosporan),9 Islam subsequently found a warm reception among the kindred Volga Bulgars whose leader converted in the early tenth century.10 In the Eurasian steppe world and in Eastern Europe, the Khazar conversion was one of the irst, coming sometime ater the embrace by the Uygur Qagan (762) of Manichaeanism, but before the conversion of the Balkan Turkic Bulgars (864) and the Slavs of Central and Eastern Europe. As with mass religious conversions elsewhere, leadership was almost always provided by the rulers themselves and oten had to overcome domestic resistance. In the irst Türk Empire (Eastern Qaganate: 552630, 682–742, Western Qaganate: 552–659, ca. 699–766), early rulers such as Mugan (553–572) and his successor Taspar (or Tatpar, 572–578) were interested in Buddhism as were their kinsmen in the Western Türk Qaganate, the progenitor of the Khazar state.11 hese were, apparently,

largely personal conversions which did not have a profound impact on society. Subsequently, when Bilge Qagan (716–734) proposed building Buddhist and Taoist temples, Tonyuquq, his Chinese-educated advisor, argued forcefully against it, noting that it was the mobility of the Türks, unencumbered by immovable property, which gave them their military advantage.12 Similar arguments would be advanced in later Turkic-nomadic societies by those who were fearful of the lure of urban life.13 In the Činggisid era, settlement in the cities was viewed as a crime against Činggis Qan’s Yasa.14 Conversion to a universal religion in the steppe invariably involved close contact with urban elements, a program that was not always attractive to the nomadic rank and ile. he Sûfî wandering out into the steppe was far more efective in bringing Islam to the Turkic nomads than the learned ‘ulamâ’ of the cities.15 he third context in which the conversion should be viewed is the local one. What were the events and who were the personalities, if they can be determined, that brought about the conversion? And inally, we must assess the legacy of the conversion. Was this an ephemeral event or did it set in motion long-term changes? In his study of cross-cultural contacts in Eurasia, Jerry Bentley notes that “there is no single dynamic” that can be used to explain the “process of large-scale conversion in pre-modern times.” Similarly, there could be more than one reason for conversion, going beyond immediate “spiritual or cultural advantages.” Bentley discerns three broad patterns that come into play: “conversion through voluntary association; conversion induced by political, social, or economic pressure; and conversion by assimilation.” As conversion oten brought with it considerable, sometimes even radical changes in a variety of human activities, legal, social,

culinary, sartorial, linguistic, it is diicult for the historian to reconstruct the motivation for such a change.16 Conversion accounts, whose task is to instruct and strengthen the faith of the newly converted, do not necessarily tell the full story. here is a strong emphasis on the miraculous. Of the various patterns noted, Bentley inds “voluntary association” to be “perhaps the most elusive.” He notes, however, a number of incentives involving “political, economic or commercial alliance with well-organized foreigners.” When viewing the actual examples of voluntary association, the role of long-distance merchants, oten dispersed in trading diasporas across a continent, looms particularly large. Moreover, the local elites, in this way, could establish bonds with more powerful states from which political and military as well as commercial advantages could be gained. Association with a recognized imperial power could also confer domestic political beneits, bolstering otherwise weak regimes.17 he pace and depth of conversion must also be taken into consideration. In much of the literature on conversions of Inner Asian peoples, attempts are made, as Devin DeWeese has noted, to “minimize the impact of the ‘new’ religion or to deny its signiicance beyond small circles within an Inner Asian state or people.”18 his has certainly been true of some of the scholarship regarding the Khazars. Richard Eaton, in his study of the Islamization of Bengal, provides an important model for the assimilation of a new faith in an agrarian community. His conclusions are equally valid for the pastoral-nomadic peoples. Eaton identiied three stages in this process that began in Bengal in the thirteenth century and concluded in the eighteenth century. In the irst stage, elements of the new faith were included in the already existing belief system. In Bengal this involved the activities of dynamic Sûfîs who pioneered the opening of new lands for cultivation and with this the inclusion of Muslim igures in the local pantheon. To proper Muslims this is simply širk (polytheism), the gravest sin in Islam. But, in this way, Islamic ideas, however distorted, became familiar and iniltrated the local belief system. In the second stage, Muslim notions, ideas and values came to be identiied with elements of the earlier faith as the symbiosis of the no

longer really competing belief systems deepens. Such a situation can last for a long time. Eventually, in the Bengali case, the Mughal government took an active role, alongside entrepreneurial-minded local Muslims, promoting more orthodox versions of Islam. his led to the third stage in which the old religion was displaced by a fully Islamic one. Further reform took place, but this was now in an Islamic setting.19 his pattern of inclusion, identiication and displacement can also be observed in the steppe world. Within the Khazar orbit, the initial stages can be seen in the conversion tale of the North Caucasian Huns noted previously. he chopping down of the pagan holy forest by the priests and the conversion of the trees into Christian symbols and a site of Christian worship provides a graphic illustration of what DeWeese terms “assimilative displacement.”20 he burial practices of Islamicizing Volga Bulğaria21 in the tenth and eleventh centuries still preserved elements of earlier PreIslamic custom and belief.22 Bulğar tomb inscriptions mixed Arabic and Turkic.23 By the eleventh century, Volga Bulğar scholars were known in the Islamic heartlands.24 We should bear these models in mind when we examine the course of Khazar Judaization. Since the closest, contemporary conversion of a Turkic steppe state to a universal, world-religion is that of the Uyğurs, for comparative purposes we might briely examine this event. In 762, in the Chinese capital, Luoyang, which his forces had “liberated” at the request of the Tang from rebels, Bögü, the Uyğur Qağan, converted to Manichaeanism, having been instructed in that faith by Soġdian Manichaean priests who had

been residing there. Manichaeanism had been moving along the Silk Route inding devotees among the Soġdians (as had other religions such as Nestorian Christianity) and those peoples with whom they closely interacted, especially the Turkic nomads. Manichaean missionaries at the Uyğur court soon encountered opposition from the Uyğur aristocracy which Bögü for a time overcame. Whether the religion spread much beyond the Uyğur elite is unclear. It did, however, become the state religion,25 surviving the assassination of Bögü Qagan in a coup led by anti-Manichaean aristocrats in 779.26 he Soġdian adherents of this faith living among the Uyğurs are noted as niġošaklar and sartlar. he former term denotes, literally, the “listeners,” i.e. the Manichaean rank and ile. Sart, a term ultimately of Sanskrit origin (sârtha “caravan”), meant “merchant” and subsequently in Turkic came to denote the urban (usually Iranian) populace as a whole, with some pejorative connotations.27 Religion and commerce were oten inseparable along the Silk Route.28 he Uyğur conversion was known to the medieval Muslim geographers and historians29 and an-Nadîm portrays them as ready to retaliate against the whole of the Muslim community in their lands, should any of their coreligionists be harmed in the Islamic lands.30 Clearly, a closer identiication with the new faith was taking place.

holy mountains, the miraculous birth of rulers and dreams that precede the conversion and concludes with a religious debate, all familiar elements in Turkic conversion narratives and found in the Khazar accounts as well.31 Why did the Uyğurs convert to this much-persecuted faith? As in other instances, it may have been a very public way of proclaiming their ideological independence from China and to sharpen distinctions with their rivals, the Qarluqs and Qırğız, among whom Nestorian Christianity had made some headway.32 he Uyğur conversion to Manichaeanism did not leave a legacy. Manichaeanism faded during the post-imperial diaspora, while Buddhism became dominant, alongside smaller Nestorian Christian communities, both eventually supplanted by Islam (except for a small Buddhist community).33 A distant observer, the Zoroastrian Dênkart (last redaction in the tenth century) provides a curious footnote to this. Surveying the impact of non-Zoroastrian faiths, it remarks that “thus it is clear that the false doctrine of Yišô in Rome (Hrôm) and that of Môšê among the Khazars and that of Mânî in Turkistan took away their might and the valor that they once possessed and made them feeble and decadent among their rivals . . .”34 With this as background we may now ask what do we know of the indigenous belief system or systems that were present among the Khazars?35 What were they converting from? According to Ibn Rusta, aside

from the Judaized ruling stratum, the “rest of the Khazars profess a religion similar to that of the Turks.”36 Gardîzî, who drew on the same sources, compares the Khazar native religion to that of the Oğuz Turks.37 It is quite likely that Khazar native religion was much like that of the North Caucasian Huns and other Turkic peoples. We have already mentioned the tree cult and how it was transformed by the Christian missionaries to their own purposes. Mention is also made of a god called K’uar38 (not otherwise attested as the name of a deity). hose persons or objects struck by “lashes of thundering iery lightning and ethereal ire” are considered sacriices to him.39 he principle god is T’angri Xan, the familiar supreme celestial god Tengri of the Inner Asian peoples.40 To this fearsome “gigantic savage monster,” according to Bishop Israyêl, they sacriiced horses. hey also made oferings to ire, water, the moon, to “all creatures considered in their eyes to be in some way remarkable” and to “certain gods of the road.”41 his is probably a reference to the Old Türk yol tengri,42 probably a god of fortune. he North Caucasian Huns also beat drums and whistled over corpses, cut themselves as part of their mourning ritual, engaged in naked sword ights at the graves, wrestled and raced their horses this way and that as some were occupied with “weeping and wailing and others in games of diabolical fury.”43 Israyêl also mentions the “royal graves of the thunder” (č’op’ayk’) and “the tall idols and the č’op’ayk’ with the ilthy skins of the altars.”44 he
practices, drawing heavily, as one must, on analogies with the Türks and North Cauca
sian Huns. his useful study, however, omits a discussion of qut and its signiicance for
Khazar sacral kingship.

term is still found in the North Caucasus today. In Osetin, coppay and in Čerkes čoppa denote a “ritual dance and singing performed around a person who has been struck by lightning, the refrain repeated during this ritual . . .”45 In Qaračay-Balqar, it is the name of a fertility deity of thunder and lightning, second only to Teyri (= Tengri) “to whom a kid was sacriiced.” Prayers to Čoppa were accompanied by ritual dancing.46 here are depictions, in aristocratic grave complexes in Khazaria, of scenes of ritual combat, dancing of naked warriors armed with spears and wearing masks. here is also evidence of the worship of oak trees to which animal sacriies (wild boars) were brought and of totemism.47 Of Khazar native religious practices we have few direct notices. Funerary practices, as evidenced by the sites investigated in Khazaria by Russian and Soviet archaelogists, indicate a belief in another world that was much like the one they had let. Warriors were buried with their horses, weapons and food, items they would need in their journey to the next world. Sometimes, in the graves of well to do there were human sacriices of young women and children (probably slaves or servitors). he skeletons were oten wholly or partially destroyed to render the deceased harmless and perhaps to cleanse him or free him from worldly concerns. hese and other pagan spiritual concepts were widespread throughout Khazaria, regardless of location or the ethnic ailiations of the deceased.48 he Khazar Hebrew conversion accounts mention that the Khazar ruler Bulan drove out the “magicians” (qosmîm) and idolators.”49 Presumably, this is a reference to Khazar qams (shamans). he sun amulets worn by the North Caucasian Huns, perhaps a part of the Tengri cult, are found all over Khazar territory.50 In the Vita Constantini, the famous “apostle to the Slavs,” the Khazar ruler who summoned him to participate in a religious debate at the Khazar court says “from the irst (ispr’va) we know of one God who is above all and to Him we bow towards the

east and observe some of our shameful (stoud’ny) customs.”51 At a dinner with the Qağan, the latter raised his goblet saying “we drink in the name of the One God who created every living thing (tvar’).”52 hese are probably references to the Tengri cult. here is clear evidence of a cult of ancestor worship and human sacriice connected with it. he death of a Khazar tudun, in 710–711, occasioned the killing of the Byzantine oicial who was with him together with three hundred soldiers as part of the funeral observances.53 Ibn Fadlân tells us that ater constructing over a river a multi-room mausoleum, termed “Paradise,” for the deceased Qağan, they decapitated those who built it.54 Al-Istahrî notes the reverence with which the Khazar royal grave was approached. Anyone riding towards the tomb had to dismount, prostrate himself before the tomb and then continue on foot until he was at a suitable distance from the holy site.55 he Qağan, of course, given his possession of qut (the heavenly mandate/good fortune to rule)56 was accorded extraordinary respect. Al-Istahrî, and others, remark on his sacral character. He rarely appeared in public. When the Beg/Išad57/Yilig (the deputy ruler who ran the actual afairs of state) approached him, he

prostrated himself, “rolling himself in the dust” (tamarraġa fî at-turâb) and then waited until he was summoned.58 Ibn Fadlân reports that the deputy ruler daily “enters (into the presence of the Great Qağan, humbly (mutawâdi an), showing humility (ihbât) and calmness (sakîna). He only enters before him barefoot and in his hand is a piece of irewood (hatab). When he greets him, he ignites this piece of irewood between his hands and when it is all burned up, he sits together with the king on his throne, on his right side.”59 he use of purifying ire so that one might be admitted to the royal presence was well-known in the steppe world.60 hese rites must also be considered part of the pre-conversion Khazar religion. hese or similar types of funerary practices involving human sacriice were widespread in the steppe. Al-Muqaddasî (al-Balhî)61 says of the Turks that “among them are those who bury with the deceased their slaves and servants, (leaving them) alive, in the grave mound, until they die.”62 Other examples can be cited for groups ranging from the Scythians, Xiongnu, Hephthalites, Qitans, Qıpčaqs, Mongols, Jurčens and Ottomans.63 he Khazar grave structure described by Ibn Fadlân is an example of the qorığ “a royal enclosure,”64 which is clearly linked with

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 135
Old Türk burial customs.65 Archaeologists have found many ashpits in maritime Daghestan, an early area of Khazar habitation. hese are connected with sun or ire cults that may have been part of Khazar worship. In addition, there are inds of the teeth of boars, dogs and wolves, some of them perforated, in both Daghestan and Saltovo-Majackaja culture areas, that, very likely, had some cultic functions or were used as amulets.66 Monotheistic world religions were already penetrating Khazaria, in particular Christianity.67 Archaeologists have unearthed evidence of a sizable number of Christian churches in maritime Daghestan, a region of Khazar inluence. In particular, this was the work of Armenian/Albanian missionaries operating out of Č’or (Darband/Bâb al-Abwâb or a locale near it)68 long active in missionary eforts among a variety of “Hunnic” peoples. here is also evidence of Georgian Christian missionary activity elsewhere in the region.69 In this connection we may note the Georgian Life of St. Abo (< Arab. Habîb) who was martyred in 786. An Arab Muslim who had taken service with the Georgian Prince Nerses, he led with his master to the Khazars, ca. 779–780. he latter are described as “wild men, fearsome of face, savage in character, drinkers of blood, without religion except that they recognize a god the creator.”
65 See discussion in DeWeese, Islamization and Native Religion, pp. 181–183, 188.
Connected with these customs, perhaps, is the strange account in at-Tabarî, accord
ing to which in the atermath of the Arab defeat sufered at the hands of the Khazars
at Balanjar in 32/652, the body of the slain commander of the Arab forces from Bâb
al-Abwâb/Darband, ‘Abd ar-Rahmân b. Rabî a, was placed in a basket (safat) and they
“ask for water by means of it and ask for victory by it up to today.” Zaxoder saw in this
a possible relection of the rain-cult and rain-stone that was so well-known among the
Turkic peoples, see at-Tabarî, Ta rîh at-Tabarî, ed. M. Ibrâhîm (Cairo, 1967–1969), IV,

In other words, the Khazars, at this time, were still largely followers of the Tengri cult. Here, Abo, converted to Christianity.70 According to al-Muqaddasî, writing in the late tenth century, the bulk of the inhabitants of Samandar, one of the early Khazar centers in the North Caucasus, were Christians.71 Al-Istahrî, however, mentions that there are Muslims and mosques in Samandar, but notes that “their king is a Jew” and a relative of the Khazar ruler. Ibn Hawqal (who took much of his information from al-Istahrî or their common source) says that “the Muslims and people of various other faiths and pagans (Tabaqât ahl al-milal wa’l-wataniyûn) inhabited this country and adds that there are mosques, churches and synagogues in Samandar.72 he Crimea, a region in which there was oten an uneasy Byzantine-Khazar condominium, was another source of ongoing Christian inluences emanating from the Crimean Goths and the Black Sea Christian communities.73 When the Khazars extended their inluence over Ap’xazet’i/Abxazia-Western Georgia (whose ruler ca. 780, Leon, was the grandson of the Khazar Qagan and who had asserted his independence of Constantinople with Khazar aid), an anti-Khazar revolt broke out (780s, perhaps 790s) in Gothia. Although there is no direct evidence to tie Byzantium to it, it is indicative of the friction that had developed in this region.74 hese conlicts form part of the background to the Khazar conversion. here is also some evidence for the creation of a larger Church structure in the region in the form of a number of episcopal seats, subject to the metropolitanate of Doros (Gothic Crimea) and covering the lower Volga, North Caucasian and Crimean zones.75 he
70 he sources of his conversion, apparently, were the “many towns and villages in
that northern land which by the grace of the Holy Ghost abide securely in the Christian
faith,” see D.M. Lang (ed. trans.), Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints (London,

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 137
dating of this organizational proposal and its actual impact are uncertain (last quarter of the eighth century?).76 Clearly, there was a serious efort to strengthen the Christian/Byzantine position in Khazaria at this time. Why? Was this a response to the growing Jewish inluence, to the conversion of the Khazar ruler to Judaism noted in al-Mas ûdî or a factor contributing to that conversion? Equally important as a background factor was the protracted struggle in which the Khazars and Arabs had been engaged for control of the Caucasus.77 In 737, the Umayyad general (and subsequently last Umayyad Caliph) Marwân broke through into the Khazar core lands on the Volga, captured the Qagan and forced him to convert to Islam. According Ibn A tam al-Kûfî, “and with him many people of his house became Muslims and people of his country.”78 here is very little evidence to indicate that the Qagan remained a Muslim. he quick retreat of the Arab armies and the growing disorder in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was toppled in 750, let little political pressure to remain Muslim. here is one notice, however, which may indicate that Islam had continued among some elements of the Khazar ruling clan. Al-Istahrî (writing in the middle of the tenth century, although much of his data is drawn from earlier sources) reports that the Qağanal oice was barred to a very able member of the royal clan (who sold ish in the market) because he was a Muslim, “for they only

summon to the Qaganate one who professes Judaism.”79 he story, if true, would indicate that some members of the Qağanal house had either retained their allegiance to Islam or had been subsequently converted. In any event, there were still Muslims within the ruling clan. It is hard to imagine, however, given the high positions held by Muslims in Khazar society and government, that this young man was reduced to ish-mongering because of his religion. According to Ibn Fadlân the legal afairs of the Muslims who reside in or come to Khazaria for trade are handled by a Muslim slave (ġulâm) of the Khazar king who is called Hz (cf. Khwârazmian ž “pleasant”?)80 “and no one else hears their cases or passes judgments among them.”81 Al-Mas ûdî, in the 940’s, reports that the wazîr of the Khazar king was a Muslim named Ahmad b. Kûya and notes that Muslims “are predominant (ġâlib) in” the capital Atıl/Itil, “because they constitute the army of the king. hey are called in this town Ursiyya.”82 his standing army of the king, perhaps the royal comitatus, al-Mas ûdî is only talking of the troops within the capital, was stafed by an immigrant community of Muslims from the Khwârazm region who had let their homeland, “ater the appearance of Islam,” and had taken service with the king of the Khazars. Ahmad b. Kûya was from this community.83 When the king warred on Inidels, he was accompanied by 7000 of them. hey stood aside, however, in wars with Muslims.84 We can see that non-Judaic religious allegiance did not preclude access to the highest levels of power.

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 139
With these remarks we have come to the question of the conversion itself. What do we know of the circumstances of the conversion, its setting and dating? he historicity of the conversion narratives has been explored by Dunlop, Pritsak and others.85 Pritsak has termed them “epic narratives” and there are certainly elements that it within the general mold of Turkic conversion tales. he dating remains problematic. It is, perhaps, most useful to examine our sources chronologically or according to the era from which our source has drawn its information. As has long been noticed, none of the contemporary sources emanating from their immediate neighbors make direct mention of the Khazar conversion. he earliest source is the passage in Christian of Stavelot’s (also known as Druthmar of Aquitaine) commentary on Matthew (Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam) the extant manuscripts of which date to the tenth century.86 he sources for the notice are dated to sometime ater the death of Charlemagne and before the conversion of the Balkan Bulğar ruler Boris to Christianity in 864—although a recent study suggests that it might have stemmed from South Italian or Roman sources of the 860’s or 870’s. he text says “We are not aware of any nation under the sky that would not have Christians among them. For even in Gog and Magog, the Hunnic people who call themselves Gazari, those whom Alexander conined, there was a tribe more brave than the others. his tribe had already been circumcised, and they profess all dogmata of Judaism (omnem Judaismum observat). However, the Bulgars, who are also from those seven tribes, are now becoming baptized.”87 he Gazari are, presumably, the Khazars although this term or the “Kozary” of the perhaps nearly contemporary Vita Constantini (Constantine/Cyril was in the Khazar state ca. 861) could have relected any of a number of peoples within Khazaria.88 he Vita Constantini (written

perhaps in the early 880s, if not immediately ater Constantine’s death in 869)89 tells of a religious debate held at the court of the Khazar ruler. According to this account the debate took place because “the Jews are counseling us (ustjat ny) to accept their faith and usages (detel’) and the Saracens, on the other hand, ofering peace and many gits, are pulling us to their faith.” Hence, the appeal to the Byzantine emperor, “because of our old friendship and love,” to send “a learned man” to present the Christian position and “should he defeat the Jews and Saracens we will adopt your faith.”90 From this it would appear that the question of Khazar religious orientation, at the highest levels, was still undecided ca. 861, although local partisans of Judaism clearly held high, inluential positions at the court and were shaping the policy debate within the government. In other words, Judaism was by this time a powerful presence within the Khazar state. Constantine’s mission was fundamentally political in nature and could not have been otherwise. Political issues were, in any event, inevitably and inextricably intertwined with proselytizing eforts.91 Success would have altered the Judaizing course of the Khazar government and brought the Khazar Empire fully into the “Byzantine Commonwealth.” Although it did not succeed on the religious plane, Constantine, according to the Vita, was able to bring home some Byzantine prisoners who had been in Khazar captivity and irm up the Khazaro-Byzantine entente.92 he Vita indicates more than hints that not all had been well in Khazar-Byzantine relations.

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 141
Vita appears to have distorted the actual situation at the Khazar court. he Khazar elite had already converted to Judaism (see below). Somewhat more problematic is the account of Eldad ha-Dani, a mysterious Jewish traveler and tale-teller, who is said to have visited Spain ca. 880 and wrote of the presence of the tribe of Simeon and the halftribe of Manasseh in the land of the Khazars. he authenticity of the texts has been called into question.93 He is, perhaps, the igure claiming Danite descent who visited Spain “in the days of our fathers” mentioned in the letter of Hasdai ben Šaprût, the Jewish courtier of the Spanish Umayyads who initiated the Khazar correspondence.94 Ibn Hurdâdbih (d. ca. 912) was the master of the post in al-Jibâl (Media) and a man who was well informed about the lands of the ‘Abbâsid Caliphate and its neighbors. His Kitâb al-Masâlik wa’l-Mamâlik, which underwent two redactions (846–7 and 885–6, not all of which survives), has a very valuable notice on the Jewish merchants, the Râdâniyya, who came to the Khazar cities as part of their trans-Eurasian itinerary and appear to have been supplanted by the Rus’ by the time of the second redaction.95 he surviving text says nothing about Khazar Judaism. Ibn al-Faqîh, however, who drew liberally on Ibn Hurdâdbih has more information on this, as we shall see. Pritsak has suggested that the thirteenth-century compiler, Yâqût, in his Mu jam al-Buldân, who remarks that “their (the Khazar) king” (malikuhum) is a Jew,96 took this part of his text from Ibn Hurdâdbih. his would be the earliest Muslim reference to Khazar Judaism.97 But, Yâqût himself says that he took his information from Ibn Fadlân and it is more widely accepted that the former and al-Istahrî are the primary sources for the Mu jam’s notices on the Khazars.98

here is a sizable corpus of Muslim historians who take note of the Khazars (given the prolonged warfare between the Arabs and the Khazars they could hardly have failed to do so), but they, too, are silent about Khazar Judaism. hey include such important ninth and early tenth century authors as: al-Ya qûbî, al-Balâdurî and at-Tabarî. Ibn A tam al-Kûfî (d.926) noted the conversion of the Qagan to Islam, but has nothing to say regarding other religions in Khazaria. he situation changes, however, with Ibn al-Faqîh whose Kitâb alBuldân was probably written ca. 902–903 (he died in the 950s)99 and largely drew on Ibn Hurdâdbih. He reports, however, that “all of the Khazars are Jews. But, they have been Judaized recently.”100 Lewicki was of the opinion that this notice was taken directly from Ibn Hurdâdbih and hence dates to the 840’s or 880’s.101 It might also, however, be an updating of the latter’s material by Ibn al-Faqîh, relecting the large-scale Judaization of the Khazars that had occurred by the time of his writing. he Kitâb al-A lâq an-Nafîsa (written ca. 903–912) of Ibn Rusta, only one book of which has survived, dates from about the same time as Ibn al-Faqîh’s work. Basically a compiler, like so many of the Islamic geographers, Ibn Rusta drew on a number of sources, both contemporary merchants and travelers and written works from the mid- to late-ninth century.102 He says of the Khazars that “their supreme chief professes Judaism as does also the Îšâ[d] and those of the leaders and great ones who sympathize with his inclinations. he rest of them profess a religion similar to that of the Turks.”103 Gardîzî whose Zayn al-Ahbâr dates from ca. 1050, drew from many of the same sources used by Ibn Rusta. He reports that the Qagan and Išâd are Jews as “are all who are inclined (meil dârad) to (these) two from among the generals (sarhangân) and great men. he rest of them have a faith (bar dînî and) which resembles that of the religion of the Oğuz Turks (ba-dîn-i turkân-i ġuzz mânad).”104

Ibn Fadlân, one of our few sources who actually set foot in the region (in 921–922), in his capacity as secretary to the Caliphal mission to Volga Bulğaria, reports that “the Khazars and their king are all Jews” (wa al-hazar wa malikuhum kulluhum yahûd). his section, however, is not found in the Mašhad manuscript, but preserved in Yâqût’s occasionally jumbled compilation.105 It is clear, nonetheless, that by his time the core element of the state, the Khazars, were Judaized. Roughly contemporary to Ibn Fadlân was Sa adiah Gaon (892–942) who makes several references to the Khazars and Khazaria, but says nothing explicitly about their Judaism. he latter might be implied from his mention of a certain Isaac Bar Abraham of Iraq who went to Khazaria and settled there.106 But, it could be argued that the Khazar economy attracted men of a variety of religions and Sa adiah’s comment might only indicate that there was a Jewish community there. Sa adiah’s lack of explanation about Khazar Judaism might also indicate that it was so well-known to his audience that there was no need to belabor the obvious. he Qaraite scholar, al-Qirqisânî, writing ca. 937, in his comments on Genesis 9:27, mentions that “some other commentators are of the opinion that this verse alludes to the Khazars who accepted Judaism.”107 Again, there is no explanation, but rather the sense that the audience knew well what the reference was. Certainly, by this time, the association of Khazaria and Judaism in the Jewish world was an established fact, not requiring further commentary. Zvi Ankori who examined these and other statements emanating from the Qaraite communities, concluded that the general tenor of al-Qirqisânî’s remarks displayed a certain lack

of enthusiasm for these converts. Other Qaraite commentators, such as Yafet b. Alî of Basra (l. 950–980), maligned them with the charge of bastardy. Ankori, on the basis of Qaraite hostility towards the Khazars, considers it quite unlikely that the Khazars would have been converts to Qaraism.108 his appears to ind further conirmation in the genuine Khazar documents. In particular, the letter which is believed to have stemmed from the Khazar community in tenth century Kiev, shows no traces of non-Rabbinical Judaism.109 Al-Mas ûdî, in his description of the Khazar capital, Atıl/Itil, writes: “In this city there are Muslims, Christians, Jews and pagans. As concerns the Jews, they are the king (malik, by which he later notes he means the Qağan), his entourage and the Khazars of his tribe (min jinsihi). he king of the Khazars converted to Judaism during the caliphate of (Hârûn) ar-Rašîd (reg. 786–809, pbg). Some Jews joined him, arriving there from various Islamic urban centers and from Byzantium (Rûm). his was because the king of Rûm, in our time i.e in 332/943 it is Armanûs (Romanos Lekapenos, reg. 920–944), converted those Jews who were in his kingdom to the Christian religion, using coercion on them . . .” He goes on to note that many Jews led from Byzantium to Khazaria as a consequence of this. He also writes that he has discussed the conversion of the Khazar ruler in another work.110 Unfortunately, this work has not come down to us. his is, however, the clearest statement we have for the conversion to Judaism at the highest levels in Khazar society and for an inlux of Jews from abroad. It is quite likely that we have an abridged version of the conversion account in ad-Dimašqî, writing ca. 727/1327, who attributes the notice to Ibn al-Atîr and has clearly jumbled, other, imperfectly understood, sections from Ibn al-Miskawaih. He also places it in the time of Hârûn ar-Rašîd.111

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 145
Of the other surviving works attributed (albeit with some considerable uncertainty) to al-Mas ûdî, the ‘Ajâ’ib ad-Dunyâ and the Ahbâr az-Zamân we ind the brief notice that “as concerns the Turks . . ., they possess no religion. Some of them profess the faith of the Majus and others are Judaized.”112 his tells us little. Al-Istahrî (ca. 951, but most probably harkening back to an earlier time) reports that “their king is a Jew” and that “the Khazars are Muslims, Christians and Jews and among them are idolaters. he smallest group are the Jews, most of them are Muslims and Christians, except the king and his people of distinction (who) are Jews. he morality of the pagans prevails among them.”113 Ibn Hawqal (writing in the 970’s) repeats essentially the same notice as does also the thirteenth century compiler, Yâqût (ca. 1229).114 his theme limiting Judaism to the Khazar ruling elite is also relected in the mid-eleventh century author, Ishâq ibn al-Husain and in the anonymous twelth century Risâla fî’l-Aqâlîm.115 From about the mid-tenth century also stems the famous Khazar Correspondence between Hasdai ibn Šaprût, the Jewish courtier of the Spanish Umayyads and the Khazar king, Joseph. Stemming from this same era is the “Letter of an Unknown Khazar Jew” or Cambridge Document” (previously called the “Schechter Document”) found among the treasures of the Cairo Geniza and dated, perhaps, to ca. 949.116 he issue of the authenticity of the Correspondence has a long and mottled history which need not detain us here. Dunlop and most recently Golb have demonstrated that Hasdai’s letter, Joseph’s response (dating

perhaps from the 950s)117 and the “Cambridge Document” are, indeed, authentic. What we have are copies (as Golb suggests), perhaps from an 11th century codex of Hasdai’s diplomatic correspondence.118 he “Cambridge Document” has many controversial points, which we need not consider at this moment, focusing, instead, on the conversion narrative contained within it. Jews are said to have arrived in Khazaria from or via Armenia at some unstated time (perhaps as early as the period of persecution unleashed by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (610–641) in the early 630s).119 In Khazaria they intermingled with the Khazars while preserving, apparently imperfectly, elements of their ancestral faith. Subsequently, one of the prominent Jewish military leaders, coaxed by his devout wife and father-in-law, began to espouse more vigorously a form of Judaism more closely adhering to traditional Jewish norms. his angered the Byzantines and the Muslims. It was at this stage that this “great chief ” (ha-sar ha-gadol) called for a religious disputation to settle the roiling religious question. In its atermath (the conclusions are nowhere clearly stated), the Khazar oicers called for Jewish books which had been kept in a “cave in the plain of Tyzwl ( ). hese were produced and the explanations ofered by the “sages of Israel” proved critical. “hen,” we are told, “returned Israel, with the people of Qazaria, (to Judaism) completely” and Jews began to emigrate to Khazaria from Iran, Iraq and Byzantium. his strengthening of religious faith also led to centralization of a hitherto difused form of government (“there was no king in the land of Qazaria; but rather whoever would achieve victories in war would they appoint over themselves as chief oicer of the army”).

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 147
Now, they “appointed over them one of the sages” who is called kagan ( ) i.e. Qağan.120 Constantine Zuckerman, who has most recently analyzed this text, suggests that the notion of a “return” to Judaism was a means of getting around the potential divisions between Jews and converts. It was, “a practical way to save the cohesion of the Khazar people.” Moreover, the primitive, “bookless” Judaism that had existed up to this time inds parallels in the characterization of Khazar beliefs found in the Vita Constantini,121 although Khazar religious beliefs described briely in that text could just as easily be a reference to the Tengri cult. Joseph’s response to Hasdai’s letter contains another version of the conversion narrative. In it, the Khazar king (melek) Bulan, “a wise and God-fearing” man drove out the “sorcerers and idol-worshippers.” Having received two heaven-sent dreams as a result of his strivings and having then convinced this heavenly apparition to appear to the “great chief ” (ha-sar ha-gadol, if Bulan is the Beg, then obviously this would be the Qağan)122 to win him over, he then gathered together his “princes, slaves and his entire people” and they converted to the new faith. A third angelic visitation produced a request that he build a temple and assured him military success in a raid on Azarbayjan as a means to gather the necessary funds. Byzantium and the Muslim rulers, having learned of this (clearly there were pro-Byzantine and pro-Muslim factions at the court), sent him gits and tried to win him over. A religious disputation followed in which Judaism prevailed. he conversion is said to have taken place 340 years before Joseph’s time. Some generations ater Bulan, during the reign of Obadiyah, the kingdom was “renewed” and the faith strengthened according to traditional Jewish norms.123 Al-Muqaddasî (writing ca. 985) describes Khazaria as “a broad district beyond the (Caspian) sea, (a land of) squalor and woe, of many sheep,

honey and Jews.”124 he Khazar state was mortally wounded by the Rus’ campaigns (in alliance with the Oğuz) of 965–969. In this notice, if it is a relection of the situation at the time of al-Muqaddasî’s writing, we ind evidence that there were still large numbers of Jews in Khazaria. On the other hand, he also notes in his description of the “Khazar,” the Khazar capital on the Volga, that its inhabitants had earlier moved to the sea coast (i.e. the Caspian?) and then returned. “hey converted to Islam since they had earlier been Jews.”125 his clearly refers to the time ater the Rus’-Oğuz overrruning of the city. Muslims had, in all likelihood, comprised the majority—or at least plurality—of the population of the capital. Ater the disasters of 965–969, many Jews and Judaized Khazars had undoubtedly led the city. hose that remained appear to have converted to Islam. he continuing existence of Khazar Jewish communities, however, may be seen in the account of the Rus’ chronicles of the series of religious interrogations conducted by the ruler of Kiev, Vladimir I, in 986 who declined Volga Bulğar Muslim, Khazar Jewish and German Catholic invitations to accept their faiths before converting to Orthodox Christianity.126 An-Nadîm, writing ca. 987–988, in a notice on the script systems used by the “Turks and those related to them,” comments that “the Khazars write Hebrew.”127 An echo of this theme is found in Fahr ad-Dîn Mubârakšâh (ca. 1206) who, in a notice clearly conlated from several sources, states that the “Khazars also have a script which is derived from that of the Rûs, a branch of the Rûm who live near them. hey write in this script and are called Rûm-Rûs. hey write from let to right, the letters are not joined. here are twenty-two letters all together (and no more). he greater part of these Khazars who use this script are Jews.”128 A Sunnî qâdî, ‘Abd al-Jabbâr b.

conversion, which he placed “recently in the days of the ‘Abbâsids and during their rule” as an example of a bellicose, violent people who were converted by a single proselytizer using the power of argument rather than military force.129 he individual is let unnamed. Al-Bakrî (scr. 1086, d. ca. 1094) has a longer notice for which he, obviously, drew on a number of sources: “in general, the Khazars are Muslims and Christians. Among them are (also) idolators. he smallest of the groups among them is the Jews.130 heir king professes the Jewish faith.” Having been irst a pagan (majûs) and then a Christian, he “saw the wrongness of his what he believed” and convened a religious disputation “between the three Peoples of the Book (ashâb al-kitâb).” A learned local Jew bested the Christian bishop in debate and then had someone poison his Muslim opponent. hus, “the Jew won the king’s favor (istimâla) to his religion and he became a Jew.”131 Interestingly enough, it is one of our latest sources, Yehudah Halevi, who, in the opening lines of his famous defense of Judaism written in Arabic in 1140 (the Kitâb al-Hujjâh wa’d-Dalîl fî Nasr ad-Dîn ad-Dalîl or more popularly Kitâb al-Hazarî, it was translated into Hebrew, in 1167 by Yehudah Ibn Tibon, the Sefer Ha-Kuzarî), says that having been asked to “provide refutations” to defend Rabbinical Judaism, he remembered “the arguments of the rabbi who studied with a Khazar king, who converted to Judaism some four hundred years ago.”132 His contemporary, Abraham ibn Daud, writing in the 1160’s conirms the interest in Khazar matters among Iberian Jewish intellectuals. He mentions the Khazar Jewish community as part of the larger Rabbinical, as opposed to Qaraite, community, knows of the Khazar Hebrew correspondence and even remarks that “we have seen some of their descendants in Toledo, scholars who informed us that their legal practice conforms to Rabbanite

he notice reads: “One of the Jews undertook the conversion of the Khazars (who) are
(comprised of) many peoples, and they were converted by him and joined his religion.”

usage.”133 he Khazar Hebrew correspondence is also noted by the somewhat older Yehuda ben Barzillay of Barcelona (ca. 1090–1105), who, however, was less certain about its authenticity and indeed of the fact of the Khazar conversion.134 Despite the overwhelming evidence of the written sources, archaeological evidence for Judaism is hard to come by. One of the brick buildings in Sarkel (a fortress-trade center on the Don built with Byzantine assistance in 840–841)135 may have been a synagogue, but this is by no means certain. here are no other traces of Judaic or Christian belief in that complex that have been uncovered thus far.136 Warrior graves with Jewish symbols are found at Čelarevo (70 km. from Belgrad) in Yugoslavia. hese may have been Qabar. Given the absence of Jewish, Christian or Muslim religious paraphernalia in the Khazar sites investigated thus far, Pletnëva concluded that paganism remained the “unifying religion” of Khazaria.137 here can be little doubt that paganism was an important element in Khazar culture and probably a signiicant substratal element in the religious beliefs of those that converted to one or another of the monotheistic religions. But, one must ask, are we to expect much religious paraphernalia in a relatively recently converted steppe society? Do the Oğuz, in the century or so ater their Islamization, present much physical evidence in the steppe for their new faith? hese conclusions must be considered preliminary.

Dating and Impact of the Conversion
he dating of the conversion remains a matter of scholarly dispute. Dunlop, ater an exhaustive analysis of the Arabic and Hebrew sources, concluded that “sometime before 112/730, the leading Khazars may have come under the inluence of Judaism.” In the atermath of a religious debate, ca. 740, the Qağan accepted “a modiied Judaism” and in 800, moved to full Rabbinical Judaism.140 A cautionary note should be sounded here. In 733, when Constantine Copronymus married Čiček, the daughter of the Qağan, the Byzantine sources make no mention of Khazar Judaism (although, as was noted previously, they consistently ignored it) nor do we ind reference to it in the Georgian Life of St. Abo who was in Khazaria in 786 or in the Arab accounts of the marriage of al-Barmaqî, governor of Arminiyya and Adarbâyjân in 798/799, to a daughter of the Qağan.141 Pritsak also viewed this as essentially a three-staged process, the irst movement towards Judaization taken ca. 730–740, with a second stage coming during the era of Hârûn ar-Rašîd, ca. 799–809 and a inal stage ca. 837–843. he second stage he associates with the reforms of Obadiyah noted in Joseph’s letter which he terms “the oicial conversion of the beg.” he third stage came at the conclusion of the Khazar civil war (the revolt of the Qabars, discussed below), which forced the Qagan to accept Judaism.142 Dieter Ludwig, following these same stages of Judaization, concluded that by the time of Constantine’s mission (860) the preponderance (Übergewicht) of Jews at the Khazar court indicates that the conversion of the Khazar elite to
138 Pletnëva, Očerki, pp. 227–230. Petruxin attributes the “elusiveness” of Khazar
Judaic monuments to both the incompleteness of the Khazar archaeological record and
to the “thin stratum” of Jewish adherents.
139 Al-Istahrî, ed. De Goeje, p. 220, says that the Khazar capital had some thirty
mosques for its Muslim inhabitants.

Judaism had been accomplished, probably sometime before 835–840.143 Artamonov also viewed this as a “long, sometimes unnoticed process” in which the intermingling of Jews with Khazars played a greater role than preaching. he process began, he suggests in Daghestan, one of the early centers of the Khazars. he “culprits” (vinovniki, an interesting choice of words) in this process were local Daghistanian Jews. He also points to the old Jewish settlements in the Crimea and Taman peninsula (Phanagoria) whose numbers had grown thanks to Byzantine persecutions under Heraclius and Leo III (717–741). A Daghestanian setting for the conversion, however, is complicated by the absence, thus far, of any Jewish cultic objects in the various Khazar sites that have been examined in that region. It should also be added that there are no contemporary traces of Islam either. Local chronicles, toponyms and popular legends, however, do point to old, Pre-Judeo-Tat Jewish settlements and these may go back to Khazar times.144 Following al-Mas ûdî, Artamonov points to the late eighth-early ninth century as a particular turning point. In his interpretation, the Vita Constantini clearly shows that the Khazars were Judaized. He further argues that the conversion to one of the acceptable monotheisms of Western Asia, given Khazar involvement with both Byzantium and the Caliphate, was a necessity in the atermath of the events of 737. Faced with either Christianity or Islam, they chose Judaism as a middle way out. It gained them “entry into the circle of medieval civilization and at the same time secured them an independent status” between the competing Christian and Muslim states. here were also domestic needs, a new ideology to meet the requirements of “new forms of socio-economic relations.” Although a good choice as a demonstration of independence, Artamonov says that Judaism, with its non-proselytizing character was poorly suited to compete with the younger faiths, Christianity and Islam.145 he notion that Judaism provided a neutral status between Byzantium and the Islamic World as well as securing commercial relations across the Mediterranean is an old one, going back to the Russian Eur
143 Ludwig, Struktur und Gesellschat, I, pp. 161–163. Since he dates (pp. 328–332) the
letter of Christian of Stavelot to a period ca. 835–840 or “a little later,” the conversion of
the Khazars must have occurred before that.

asianist school.146 But, if Judaism here was non-proselytizing, how were the Khazars converted? In point of fact, conversions of elites or large-scale conversions to Judaism were not very common, but not unknown, e.g. the conversions of the Idumaeans and the Ituraeans in the late second century B.C.E., the Judaization of the ruling elites of Adiabene (in present day Northern Iraq) in the mid-irst century C.E. and of the Himyârî kings in Yemen (perhaps as early as the fourth century C.E.) and the incorporation of Berber elements into North African Jewry in medieval times.147 In Medieval Europe, Jewish policies regarding proselytism varied with time and place, depending on local and external conditions.148 A frontier zone like Khazaria, at the interstices of the great Eurasian and West Asian trade routes and the cultures and religions that traversed this zone borne by merchants and others, was precisely a region in which Judaism, unfettered by Christian or Muslim overlords who prohibited Jewish proselytizing, could freely compete. Novosel’cev dates Khazar interest in monotheistic faiths to the seventh century (e.g. the mission of bishop Israyêl noted earlier). He discounts the notice of the Qağan’s conversion to Islam in 737, noted only by Ibn A tam al-Kûfî and al-Balâdurî, as relecting a not very reliable oral tradition that was not repeated by more discriminating authors such as at-Tabarî, al-Mas ûdî and Ibn al-Atîr among others. he Muslim sources ix Judaism as the state religion in Khazaria by the 850870’s. Novosel’cev considers al-Mas ûdî’s notice as the only one “worthy of belief.” Beyond that, the sources do not permit a more exact dating

of the event. He attributes the process of conversion to the Išâd/Beg who forced the Qagan to accept Judaism. Islam and Christianity were excluded because of political complications whereas, in his view, the Jews, on whom the Carolingians and Spanish Umayyads looked with special favor, “monopolized European trade,” controlling the transit trade between Europe and Asia. Khazaria attracted Jews leeing persecutions in Byzantium and emigrants from the Caliphate. he Jewish colonies in the Crimea were also signiicant. Nonetheless, based on a selective reading of the Muslim sources, Novosel’cev concludes that Jews comprised the smallest grouping of those espousing monotheistic faiths in Khazaria. Judaism and Jewish culture (including literacy in Hebrew) had some impact, but so did Islam which in the tenth century was gaining ground and was the religion of the royal army.149 Most recently, Constantine Zuckerman has argued for the primacy of the Vita Constantini in dating the conversion. He dismisses al-Mas ûdî’s notice as a “somewhat confused resumé of a more detailed account in a work which is no longer preserved,” but holds open the possibility of rehabilitating him in light of the revival of Jewish traditions noted in the Cambridge Letter.150 Why al-Mas ûdî should be confused about his own work and what elements of confusion are to be found in his account are not spelled out. Rather, Zuckerman says that since only one religious debate took place (the Cambridge Document and the Vita Constantini are describing one and the same event), in 861, the conversion must have occurred not long ater the debate. Conversion was in one stage, at the initiative of Bulan, the Beg/Military chief. It was probably prefaced by some individual conversions (this may be the background to al-Mas ûdî’s notice). Zuckerman contends that “the spread of Judaism among the Khazars was, in reality, more gradual and slower than the Cambridge Document would admit (though in no way limited to the upper class). He concludes, however, that it had only a “limited penetration” among the Khazars.151 Finally, he suggests that “the link between the conversion and the new mode of government, as established in the Genizah Letter, appears to be wholly justiied.”152

the conversion of the khazars to judaism 155
he linking of the dual kingship in Khazaria with Judaization has appeared over the years in a number of variants. Artamonov placed the emergence of the dual kingship in the early ninth century and connected it with the activities of Obadiyah, to whom he attributed the imposition of full Rabbinical Judaism and a coup d’état that reduced the Qagan to a largely ceremonial position.153 his produced the revolt of the Qabars.154 he Qagan was also compelled to convert to Judaism. his form of governance did not derive from Judaism, but was, he suggests, an innovation resulting from the replacement of one ruling dynasty by another.155 Pletnëva identiied Obadiyah with the unnamed Khazar ruler (the Qagan in her view) mentioned in al-Mas ûdî’s notice as converting to Judaism. he consequence of this Judaization of the Qağan, Beg and Itil aristocracy, she argues, was to alienate the ruling clique from the rest of the Khazar aristocracy which resulted in a power struggle between the non-Judaized provinces and the capital. Pletnëva concluded that Obadiayah was among those who perished in this “Khazarian Fronde” and the state itself was weakened.156 Pritsak also placed the emergence of the Beg to sometime ater 799 but before 833 when the Beg157 is shown playing an important role in foreign afairs (the building of Sarkel). he Beg, who, he conjectures, is the major domo from the Iranian *Barč/Warâz/Bolčan clan, is identiied with Obadiyah and the Khazar ruler who converted during the reign of Hârûn ar-Rašîd. his Beg forced the Qağanal clan to convert to Judaism, producing the “Judaization of the institution of the Khaghanate,” according to which only a Judaized Khazar could hold that position (cf. al-Istahrî). Pritsak dates the Qabar revolt (a reaction in his view to Judaization) to between 833 and 843 (or 835), by which time the Qagan “had lost all power” and had, indeed, been compelled to Judaize as well.158

156 peter b. golden
As for the much-debated question of the dating of the conversion, we now have some new evidence that gives added weight to al-Mas ûdî’s notice. It has become clear that the Khazars in the early ninth century minted coins, perhaps in response to a decline in Muslim minting in the 820s. he Khazar coins were invariably imitations of Islamic dirhams. However, they included, in some instances, the inscription ard al-hazar (“Land of the Khazars”), Turkic tamğas and some dirhams with the most striking formula (for imitation Islamic coins): Mûsâ rasûl Allâh “Moses is the Messenger of God,” a clear substitution for the Islamic Muhammad rasûl Allâh. he ive “Moses dirhams” uncovered thus far have been dated to 837/838 on the basis of die-chains.159 here can be little question that, at the least, the governing strata of Khazaria had been Judaized by this time—perhaps relatively recently so (as al-Mas ûdî indicates) and wanted to dramatically and visibly assert this new religious proile in the turbulent 830s. Coins were important ideological symbols and in the medieval “Age of Faith” projected the oicial religion of the state or at least that of its ruling group. As I have noted elsewhere, the institution of a dual kingship, oten encompassing a sacral king as well, is a widespread phenomenon in Eurasia—indeed worldwide.160 here is nothing but conjecture to connect it with the reforms of Obadiyah, the further evolution of Khazar Judaism or the Qabars (who may have had Judaic elements in their midst). he fact is we do not know when, precisely, the Khazar system of dual kingship emerged. It could not have come ex nihilo. It was not present in the early stages of Khazar history. Given the Old Türk traditions of the Khazar state (described in al-Istahrî and mirroring the same investiture ceremonies depicted in the Chinese sources for the Türks)161 and the overall institutional conservatism of steppe society, one must exercise great caution here. Clear evidence for it is relatively late (the latter part of the ninth century perhaps and more probably the tenth

century—although it was probably present by the irst third of the ninth century. Iranian inluences via the Ors guard of the Qağans may also have been a factor.162 hese were societies that were not given to political experimentation or innovation. Finally, why would Jewish “reformers” create a sacral monarchy still laden with pagan elements?163 Judaization, however, would certainly play a role in how the Qaganate presented itself to Jewish audiences (such as Hasdai b. Šaprût) and the Islamo-Christian world. Over time it also became internalized.
Internalization
Pritsak has suggested that Joseph’s letter represents the “oicial version of the proselyte dynasty” and the Cambridge Document is an “unoicial version of indigenously Jewish circles.”164 DeWeese, however, cautions us that “Khazar converts might be just as likely to assert their ancestral links with Jewish tribes as immigrant Jews would have been to assert their primacy in bringing the religion to the Khazars.” Indeed, these two accounts show a creative synthesis of the two traditions, Khazar paganism and Judaism.165 Zuckerman contends that the Khazars created, in efect, a myth of a Khazar “return” to Judaism, so that the various stages of Judaism could be presented as a revival and the unity of the converts and Jews maintained.166 One would hardly expect otherwise. his is an important element in the internalization of the new religion. Clear evidence that the Khazars were doing this can be found in the Kievan Khazar Hebrew letter. Turkic shamans (qam), it would appear, could become kôhêns and Levites, as Golb has suggested. his was part of what he terms “the construction or gradual evolution of a mythic substratum justifying and explaining the conversion.” he “sacerdotal metamorphosis”

of individuals or groupings from the old shamanic element that had previously conducted sacriices for the community perfectly accords with this new world view.167 Another manifestation of this synthesis of old and new can be seen in the cave motif in the conversion narratives. he ethnogonic myth of the Türks centered on the ancestral cave in which the Ashina were conceived from the mating of their human ancestor and a wolf ancestress. he Ashina-Türks, from whose western ruling branch the Khazar ruling house most probably derived, continued to ofer sacriices at the ancestral cave.168 As DeWeese has noted, this myth and ritual complex became highly politicized during the period of the Second Türk Empire and it would be surprising “not to ind echoes of this complex among the Khazars.” Moreover, “the complex of mountains, sea and cave” of the Cambridge Document mirrors that of other Inner Asian ethnogonic myths.169 Clearly the notion of a “return” to Judaism had been internalized and is relected in the conversion narratives. Joseph, while placing the genealogy of himself and his people, as descendants of Japheth, in a context that would be familiar to Hasdai, also notes that the eponymous “Khazar,” was one of the ten sons of Togarmah from whom Jews of the Middle Ages understood the Turks to derive.170 he “reforms” of Obadiah, if they are not a pious interpolation, also it into the familiar pattern of conversion and internalization. Ater several generations (in some groupings considerably longer), the new faith has not only supplanted and covered over the more obvious elements of the old religion, but has, inevitably, produced those learned enough in its precepts to desire to bring it into full conformity with the “proper” laws and traditions of the faith. We are moving, using Eaton’s model, from inclusion to displacement.
Some Conclusions
Conversion probably took place in stages. It began, as so oten was the case, at the top, with the ruling house, perhaps episodically as early as

the mid-eighth century (certainly ater 737), but not extending at that stage much beyond the ruling strata. Some important stage must have been reached by the era of Hârûn ar-Rašîd, as reported by al-Mas ûdî. he “Moses coins” clearly relect the growing weight at the top political levels of society. his was also a period of conlict with Byzantium which was trying to strengthen the Christian presence in Khazaria. he now overt movement towards Judaism may have represented a critical shit in foreign policy. Perhaps, the Byzantine contribution to the building of Sarkel (ca. 840–841) was not only to deal with threats in the steppe (Hungarians and perhaps more distantly, Pečenegs), but also to win favor with the Khazar governing elite? he conversion of the Khazar ruling elite to Judaism could not have been welcome news in Constantinople. Conversion at the top does not necessarily mean immediate mass conversion. We may note here the example of the Činggisid Khan Berke (1257–1267), ruler of the Jočid ulus who converted to Islam before his accession and was followed by other Islamized rulers, but the movement of important, critical sectors of this ulus to Islam occurred only ater the conversion of Özbek Khan (1312–1341). At the time of Constantine’s mission, the Qağan may have still been willing to entertain other religious systems or at least appear to do so, although Jews and Judaized elements within the immediate ruling strata, were most probably already guiding the internal dialogue on this question. By the latter part of the ninth century and early tenth century, Judaism, at least within the core tribes, was becoming more widespread, hence the notices in Ibn al-Faqîh (“all of the Khazars are Jews, but, they have been Judaized recently”) and Ibn Fadlân (“the Khazars and their king are all Jews”). In the history of religious conversion in the steppe this is what one would expect to ind. Moreover, these sources directly contradict the assertion by Artamonov and others that Judaism was limited only to the ruling elite and “never became the religion of the Khazar people or more precisely those tribes that formed Khazaria.”171 On the contrary, Khazar Judaism may have also begun to reach subject or allied peoples. hus, Seljukid tradition accords Old Testament names (Mîkâ’îl, Isrâ’îl, Mûsâ and Yûnus) to the sons of Seljuk, whose father Toqaq Temür Yalığ, according to some accounts, was in the service of the Khazar Qağan.172

he conversion narratives give difering versions regarding the actual agents of conversion, the Khazar Jewish accounts emphasizing its “internal” sources, i.e. stemming from Khazar Jews who have recovered their ancestral faith. Pritsak has suggested that the Khazars, like their contemporaries, the Uyğurs, were introduced and converted to these universalistic faiths (Judaism and Manichaeanism respectively) by longdistance merchants.173 With the Uyğurs this is certainly true. Like the Türks before them, they had developed a symbiotic, political, cultural and economic relationship with the Soġdians, the great culture-bearing merchants along the Silk Route. Did Jewish merchants, who appear to have been outnumbered in the Khazar capital by the large Muslim community, play a similar role? Were the local Jewish merchants ailiated with the Râdâniyya? Our sources provide no clear-cut answer. Trade and the spread of religions and the cultural paraphernalia associated with them (e.g. script systems) do seem to be connected across Eurasia,174 and it is not implausible to posit a similar kind of connection in Khazaria. But, this is not an absolute certainty. hese powerful royal courts invariably attracted “holy men” of non-commercial origins who proselytized because they believed they were doing the bidding of their God. Later Jewish sources, beginning in the thirteenth century (Nachmanides) mention the still elusive igure of Isaac Sangarî who is credited with converting the Khazar king.175 Of course, in any number of instances, the holy man and merchant could be one and the same. he tradition of debates or royal interrogations is also well established in the Inner Asian conversion paradigm.176 he “reform” movement inaugurated by Obadiyah, if, indeed, true, similarly follows the conversion paradigm of Inner Asian peoples: nom

inal conversion, backsliding followed by a renewal and deepening of the faith along with bringing it more into conformity with the norms of that faith, the pattern, as DeWeese terms it, of “summons, consent, test and decisive airmation.”177 he Khazar conversion, seen in its Eurasian context, does not, in fact, appear so exceptional. he impact of the Khazar conversion in terms of Khazaria’s relations with its neighbors is also diicult to assess. It has been claimed that ater the conversion, Constantinople devoted more eforts to the Caucasus and the Rus’ danger. Indeed, Judaization, never mentioned in the Byzantine chronicles, in efect ended the Khazaro-Byzantine entente. Others contend that no real change occurred.178 It is clear from Constantine Porphyrogenitus’s De Administrando Imperio that in his day Byzantium was relying more on the Pečenegs as an instrument of policy in the steppe. his, however, may have been the normal consequence of the Khazar decline. here is no overt indication of a religious issue, the Byzantines remaining remarkably silent on this question. his silence may itself tell us much about the Byzantine reception of the growing Judaization of the Khazars. he Byzantines had failed to bring the Khazars into Christendom. his was a foreign policy defeat and undoubtedly the source of some resentment in Constantinople. As for the Islamic world, with which the Khazars had a contentious early history, we have only the report from Ibn Fadlân that the Khazar king destroyed the minaret of the Friday mosque in Atıl in retaliation for the destruction of a synagogue in Dâr al-Bâbûnaj. he king is alleged to have said that he would have done worse if not for fear of Muslim retaliation against Jews.179 he persecutions of Jews by the Byzantine emperor, Romanos Lekapenos,

taking place ater 860 which was “disappointing and humiliating,” a “spectacular blow
to the Byzantine establishment’s ambitions for the north-east of the Black Sea,” all of
which led to persecutions of the Jews under Basil I (867–886). he Jewish persecutions
of the tenth century by Romanos Lekapenos grew out of domestic, not foreign political
needs—with unpleasant consequences for Byzantium in the North. Nonetheless, Con
stantinople continued to cooperate with Khazaria when it was in its interests to do so.
Shepard concludes that the conversion did not reorient Byzantine policy. Nonetheless,
Khazaria’s increasingly Judaic proile, perhaps strengthened by the presence of Byzan
tine Jewish refugees at the qağanal court “came to have a signiicant, if oblique, impact
on the Byzantine programme of defensive imperialism.”

resulted in attacks on Christians in Khazaria.180 Clearly, the Khazar ruler, by this time, saw himself as a defender of the Jews. Centuries ater the fall of Khazaria as a major power (965–969), there are obscure references in some documents from the Cairo Geniza to messianic ideas or movements associated with Khazaria.181 “Jewish” Khazaria retained some symbolic value, but had long since ceased to be a reality.

he Khazars built up their authority in the middle years of the seventh century in the steppes north of the Caucasus. What little reliable information can be gleaned from written sources about their rise to power—and it is very little—is closely examined by Constantine Zuckerman elsewhere in this volume. he date which he establishes for their achievement of regional hegemony, in the 660s, is as precise and secure as we can hope for. It is plain too that they achieved military parity or near-parity with the nascent power of the Caliphate south of the Caucasus in the course of the next twenty years, since, probably with Byzantine encouragement, they were able to launch a successful invasion of Transcaucasia in 685.1 But we remain in the dark about how they gained the edge over the numerous neighbouring nomad tribes who had, like them, formed part of the Turkish empire, the irst to straddle the eastern and western Eurasian steppes, from the 550s to ca. 630. Over thirty years of obscurity passed between the sudden implosion of the Turkish empire, triggered by a violent competition for power at the centre, and the recreation by the Khazars of a stable, supratribal authority in the outer reaches of its long-abandoned western territory.2 Sedentary observers, such as the early ninth century Byzantine chronicler heophanes, simply reported the outcome (in a longish, chonologically vague and rather garbled notice).3 here is no doubt, however, of the durability and political importance of the Khazar khaganate. he half-century ater 685 during which it confronted the Caliphate across the Caucasus on more or less equal

terms, eventually ighting a long war of luctuating fortunes between 708 and 737,4 also probably saw concerted military eforts to extend Khazar authority over nomad tribes and sedentary peoples in a broad zone of the steppes and wooded steppes, beyond the Don, Donets and Volga rivers which framed the core territory of the khaganate to the south, in the Kuban and Kalmyk steppes.5 he Khazars achieved the status of a great power by the early eighth century, the third acknowledged great power of the Near East alongside the Caliphate and Byzantium. hey also inaugurated two and a half centuries of political stability in western Eurasia, in the course of which, it can be argued, any major development afecting the broad swathe of territory between the Ural and Dniepr rivers was either initiated by the Khazars or efectually managed by them. he Khazars exercised considerable inluence in three regions which were of great strategic importance to Byzantium in the early middle ages. he continuing threat which they posed to Transcaucasia, ater as well as before the single serious defeat inlicted on them in 737 by the Arabs, diverted the attention of the Arab authorities from the relatively easy avenues of invasion leading across Armenia towards the eastern rim of the Anatolian plateau. he main low of Arab colonists into Transcaucasia ran due north from Mesopotamia to Atropatene (Persian Azerbaijan) and thence on to Albania (ex-Soviet Azerbaijan). Arab investment in military infrastructure in the north was concentrated not in the upper valleys of the Araxes and Euphrates from which attacks could be launched west against Byzantium, but well to the east, at the great fortress of Darband guarding the easiest passage through the Caucasus (by the Caspian shore) and in the Kur plain, where several bases were established to secure the southern approaches to the Caucasus.6 Byzantium and the khaganate shared common interests in a second large arena of diplomacy, the Pontic steppes. Both regarded the small but formidably well-organised and well-defended Bulgar state established in the north-east Balkans as an inveterate adversary.7 Finally both great

powers had interests, in this case conlicting interests, in the Crimea, which, by virtue of its proximity to the khaganate’s heartland across the straits of Kerch, clearly fell within the Khazar sphere of inluence, but was of no less concern to Byzantium by virtue of its maritime position, within easy striking distance of the north coast of Asia Minor and of Constantinople itself.8 It is reasonable therefore to look to Byzantine sources for a steady low of information about the Khazars, throughout the three centuries of the khaganate’s existence. Such information might be expected to be of high quality, given a continuing concern for chronological precision and a historical tradition which prized accurate transmission of information as much as its literary embellishment and elaboration. Bitter disappointment awaits the historian. Very little is reported of the khaganate and the odd titbits of information supplied are entirely disconnected from one another.

One of the most striking features of early medieval Byzantium was a sudden, drastic historiographical decline in the middle of the seventh century.9 For the next three centuries, information must be gleaned normally from two relatively thin historical traditions. he irst pair of texts are the Short History of Nikephoros, tentatively dated to the 780s, the work of a young man primarily concerned to give a literary facelit to a small number of accessible sources, and the Chronographia of heophanes, a much more scholarly work completed in 813/4, which may draw on a wider range of sources but which oten duplicates that of Nikephoros.10 For the following period, most of the ninth and the irst half of the tenth century, the two main narrative accounts which survive are sharply opposed to one another in tone, a court-sponsored history organised by imperial reigns (commonly known as the Continuation of heophanes, covering the period 813–961) confronting a polemical,

oten scurrilous brand of history (the so-called Logothete’s Chronicle), which, from the putsch of Basil I in 867, turns into an anti-history of the ruling Macedonian dynasty and carries on to 948.11 he military heyday of Byzantium, under the rule of Romanos II (959–63), Nikephoros Phokas (963–9) and John Tzimiskes (969–76) is likewise covered by two contrasting sources, the classicising history written by a near-contemporary, Leo the Deacon, and the terse chronicle of John Skylitzes compiled a century later, which includes a hostile account, in the Logothete’s vein, of the preceding sole reign of Constantine Porphyrogenitus (945–59).12 his is meagre stuf to compare with the rich and variegated historiographical traditions of Islam for the same period. At certain points, indeed, the two meagre trickles are reduced to one: heophanes’ account of the recent past cannot be controlled once Nikephoros’ Short History gives out in 769 (save for two substantial fragments of a lost narrative of early ninth century events);13 the anti-history of the Macedonian dynasty holds sway from 886 to the end of 944, to the extent of taking over the corresponding section of the Continuation of heophanes and leaving us no favourable or even neutral account of the reign of Leo VI (886–912), the short-lived regime of his brother Alexander (912–3) or the long nominal rule of Constantine Porphyrogenitus (913–44);14 inally, there is but one extensive account of Basil II’s reign (976–1025), that put together by Skylitzes with the concerns of his eleventh-century

readership very much in mind.15 Within this restricted historical tradition, attention is normally conined to court politics, to doctrinal controversy, to the wars against Arabs and Balkan Bulgars upon which the fortunes of Byzantium depended, and to unusual natural phenomena. Distant peoples and places only feature when they impinged directly on capital and court or when they engaged the personal attention of the emperor.16 If we discard a irst passage in which heophanes (p. 315) mistakenly equates the Turks with the Khazars, on the occasion of the formers’ decisive military intervention in Transcaucasia in 626–7,17 the Khazars are mentioned only rarely in their own right. Nikephoros (ch. 35) and heophanes (p. 358), clearly drawing on a common source, refer in passing to their rise to power in the course of digressions on the origins of the Balkan Bulgars—passages which, as Constantine Zuckerman demonstrates, maul historical reality.18 heophanes goes on later to pick out three campaigns in which the Khazars worsted the Arabs: their invasion of Armenia and Azerbaijan in 730, in the course of which they defeated and killed the Arab military governor of the north, Djarrāh b. Abdallāh, near Ardabil;19 their containment of the counterthrust north of the Caucasus by Maslama b. Abd al-Malik in 731;20 and an attack in force in 764 which caused extensive damage in Transcaucasia.21

Coverage of Byzantine-Khazar relations is limited to ive isolated reports in Byzantine historical sources.he irst two probably derive from a lost biography, critical in tone, of the Emperor Justinian II. According to a notice in heophanes (pp. 372–3) which is closely parallelled in Nikephoros (ch. 42), he escaped from Cherson (to which he had been exiled in 695) and was granted political asylum by the Khazars in 704. He married the khagan’s sister and was allowed to live at Phanagouria (Tmutarakan), before being forced to lee when Byzantine political pressure persuaded the khagan to have him executed. he story is picked up later in both heophanes (pp. 377–80) and Nikephoros (ch. 45). Justinian, who had recovered his throne in 705 with the backing of the Balkan Bulgars, bore a grudge against the inhabitants of Cherson, Bosporos (Kerch) and the other klimata (districts). In 711 he sent a large punitive expedition to the Crimea which was responsible for many atrocities and was then wrecked on the voyage home. Fear of what he might do in future was not allayed by a temporary sotening in his stance, and Cherson along with the other Crimean forts appealed for military aid to the Khazars. his arrived in time to relieve Cherson under siege by a second expeditionary force, which then changed sides, joined the Khazarsponsored rebellion of Vardan, commander of a naval detachment let behind by the irst expedition, and sailed of to help depose Justinian.22 he third notice is a brief report (heophanes, pp. 409–10, Nikephoros, ch. 63) of a second Khazar-Byzantine royal alliance, the marriage in 732/3 of Constantine, son and heir of the reigning Emperor Leo III, to the daughter of the khagan.23 Over a hundred years then pass before

the next leeting glimpse is given of the khaganate (heophanes Continuatus, pp. 122–4): the khagan and pech of the Khazars sought and obtained Byzantine technical assistance for the construction of a brick fortress on the lower Don (840–1).24 he notice does not explain either why the Khazars wanted a Roman-style fortress or what was its intended function (whether as a primarily defensive installation or as a base for the forward projection of Khazar power into the steppes or wooded steppes beyond). he episode seems to have caught the chronicler’s attention because the project was personally approved by the reigning emperor, heophilos, and because it led to the imposition of direct Byzantine rule on the south-west Crimea (on advice given by the head of the Don expedition on his return). he ith and last notice to be found in a Byzantine historical text dates from some ity years ater the conventionally assumed demise of the khaganate: it is a bald record (Skylitzes, p. 354) of Basil II’s dispatch of a leet against Khazaria in 1016, and of the subsequent subjection of the country in a joint campaign with the Rus.25 his shamefully thin historical record can be leshed out slightly with the aid of two saints’ lives, letters written by two patriarchs of Constantinople, and two pieces of documentary material. One source, though, is being let out of account for the moment—the misnamed De Administrando Imperio, dating from the middle of the tenth century, which is more forthcoming and which alone gives the Byzantinist some locus standi in Khazar studies. A crisis in relations between the Khazars and the Goths of the southwest Crimea is noted in the Life of John Bishop of Gothia, which only survives in a short epitome. John, an obdurate iconophile, who had recently visited Constantinople (during the patriarchate of Paul, 780–4), is portrayed as taking a leading role in opposing the extension or intensiication

25 he reading Khazaria is secure (no manuscript variants are noted by the editor)
and presumably originated with Skylitzes himself. However, there is an implausibil
ity about the episode as reported by him: Khazaria was evidently easily accessible by
sea and the Khazar ruler, who was captured, bears a Christian name, George Tzoules.
It looks as if Skylitzes has confused the coastal region of Kasakhia on the edge of the
Caucasus (De Administrando Imperio, ch. 42.99–102) with the territory of the Khazars.
Kasakhia was indeed attacked by the Rus from Tmutarakan around this time, but their
commander was Mstislav, son of Vladimir, not Vladimir’s brother, Sphengos, as in Sky
litzes (S. Franklin and J. Shepard, he Emergence of Rus 750–1200 [London-New York,

of Khazar authority over Gothia, the mountainous country immediately to the east of Cherson. He went so far as to expel the garrison installed in his see, Doros (Mangup). Doubtless under increasing Khazar pressure, the Goths then gave up resistance and handed John over. Ater these events (datable to the period 784–7), John was detained for some time in prison but succeeded eventually in escaping across the Black Sea to Amastris, where he died around 790.26 he Life of Constantine, future missionary to Moravia, composed by a disciple in Slavonic between 869 and 882, casts another shat of light into the local history of the Crimea in 861: Constantine was a member of an embassy on its way to the Khazar court, which interrupted its journey for some time at Cherson; conditions were evidently unsettled, since hostile Khazar and Hungarian forces were operating in the Crimea during his stay; Constantine is credited with halting a Khazar siege of an unnamed Christian town and with securing the embassy’s safe passage past a marauding Hungarian band. he embassy thus made its way safely to the Khazar capital, where a formal doctrinal disputation was staged and the main diplomatic business was transacted. A treaty was negotiated, under the terms of which two hundred Byzantine prisoners-of-war were released and permission was given for Christian missionary work on Khazar territory. he hagiographer reveals the strong position already achieved by Judaism in the khaganate in the extended account which he gives of the second and main debate between Constantine and certain Jews who evidently enjoyed high favour at court.27 Byzantine sources are niggardly with information about subsequent Christian missionary activity in the khaganate. Only two episodes are reported, in both of which Crimean archbishops took a leading role. he irst involved the conversion of Jews living in the episcopal see of Bosporos (Kerch), within a few years of the Khazar authorisation of Christian

proselytising on their territory. Antony, Archbishop of Bosporos, was congratulated on his success, in a short but elegantly phrased letter written by Photios, almost certainly during his irst tenure of the patriarchate (858–67).28 he next news of Christianity in Khazaria comes from two letters written by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos more than ity years later. On this occasion, it was more a matter of shoring up than extending the Christian position. A new archbishop of Cherson was instructed to pay a visit of inspection to Khazaria before taking up his appointment, and to perform certain duties on behalf of the faith, including the ordination of priests, while he was there. He carried out the assignment satisfactorily, was duly installed in his own see, and was then, in the second half of 920, invited to nominate a candidate as archbishop of Khazaria and to send him to Constantinople for consecration.29 hese leeting glimpses of Byzantine propagation or backing of Christianity in Khazaria cannot stand comparison with the detailed narrative of an earlier mission carried out from south of the Caucasus among the north Caucasus Hun subjects of the Khazars. Insight into the beliefs and ritual practices of Turkic nomads in the period of Khazar hegemony, as also into the techniques of conversion, is best obtained from Movses Daskhurants i’s account of Bishop Israyēl’s experiences and activities in 681–2.30 Finally (if, as indicated above, discussion of the De Administrando Imperio is postponed to a later stage), there are the two documentary sources to consider. An ecclesiastical province of Gothia, which was roughly coterminous with the khaganate and contained eight episcopal sees, features in a list of bishoprics loosely datable to the eighth and ninth centuries. he metropolitan see was Doros. he sufragans included Astel (the Khazar capital Itil) and Tamatarcha (Tmutarakan), and three

serving named peoples, the Khotzirs, Onogurs and Huns. It is likely that this ecclesiastical organisation only materialised for a short time on the ground, at a time well before the middle of the ninth century when Judaism was gaining the upper hand within the khaganate and its governing elite.31 A second document lists the correct forms of address for the full range of foreign rulers within Byzantine diplomatic horizons during the period of efective rule by Constantine Porphyrogenitus (945–59) and makes it clear that the khagan of the Khazars was still recognised as the leading potentate in the north. He is accorded more honoriic epithets than the leading rulers of sedentary peoples in the Caucasus region—the curopalate of Iberia, the exousiokrator of Alania and the exousiastes of Abasgia. Heavier golden bulls (equivalent to three solidi) were attached to letters sent to him than to those three neighbouring rulers, who were entitled to two-solidi bulls (as were Byzantium’s other principal northern correspondents—the ruler [archon in the singular] of the Rus and the rulers of the Hungarians [Turks] and Pechenegs).32 his piece of documentary information thus undercuts Novosel’tsev’s contention that the khaganate was in serious decline by the middle of the tenth century and that this was registered in Byzantium.33 Before turning to the evidence of the De Administrando Imperio, it will be useful to take stock of the material from Byzantine sources surveyed so far. It cannot be emphasised enough how limited this body of material is. Little light is cast on the geographical extent, the economy and the institutions of the khaganate. here is no irst-hand Byzantine account of a journey across any part of the khaganate, to match Ibn Fadlān’s record of his travels and observations in 921–2, when he served on a caliphal embassy to a client-ruler of the Khazars, the yil-tawar of the Volga Bulgars.34 he classical tradition of geographical writing had

withered away in Byzantium. here are no texts analogous to the series of voluminous, wide-ranging Arab geographies composed in the tenth and following centuries.35 It may be true that the same information about the Khazars and their neighbours is recycled and reworked, in tune with each author’s conceptions, in source ater source.36 But it is only on the basis of the material in Ibn Fadlān and Arab geographical texts that modern historians have been able to piece together a picture both of the scale of Khazar power (embracing some twenty-ive subordinate peoples) and the constitutional arrangements through which it was articulated (sovereign political and religious authority, embodied in the person of the khagan, being separated from executive power which was entrusted to the khagan beg and his deputy, the kundu khagan). It is again Arab sources which outline the military and iscal systems of the khaganate, incidental references in Byzantine sources merely adding some supplementary information about local government at Phanagouria and in the Crimea.37 It is hard to reconstruct Khazar-Byzantine relations over the long term.38 It is plausible to suggest that the two powers concerted their eforts to undermine Islam’s grip on Transcaucasia during and ater the second Arab civil war (684–92). But there is no explicit statement to this efect in any Byzantine source. Indeed the only solid evidence of intercommunication before or ater the crisis in their relations occasioned by Justinian II at the beginning of the eighth century is the notice about the marriage of the future Constantine V to a Khazar bride in 732/3. It is not unreasonable to infer that Byzantium and the khaganate were bound together in an active military alliance at a time, the 730s, when the existence of both was menaced by Islam.39 But it is quite impossible to tell whether this Byzantine-Khazar axis survived into the second half

of the eighth century, when the new Abbasid dynasty posed a yet greater threat. Such evidence as may be gleaned about local conditions in the Crimea suggests that relations may have been diicult at times. Bishop John’s visit to Constantinople shortly before the outbreak of trouble in Gothia in the 780s may fuel suspicion that he had oicial encouragement in his anti-Khazar agitation. Nothing is known about relations over the following ity years, save for the existence at some point of eight episcopal sees in the khaganate, one of them in the capital, Itil, another probably that founded long before by Israyel among the north Caucasus Huns. It does not follow from this Christian presence on Khazar soil that there were close political ties with Byzantium. he irst such indication comes with the tale of Petronas’ mission to construct the fortress of Sarkel on the lower Don, an episode picked out probably because the project had the active support of the reigning emperor and because the Khazars, in a reciprocal gesture of goodwill, seem to have allowed Byzantium to impose direct rule on Cherson and neighbouring districts in the Crimea. It is an isolated notice in heophanes Continuatus (parallelled at De Administrando Imperio, ch. 42.22–55). It would be wrong to assume that Byzantine technical assistance was limited to a single project because only one project is mentioned in Byzantine sources. his is a historiographical silence of no force atall, and cannot be used as an argument against the archaeological data which suggest to Gennadii Afanas’ev and Valery Flerov that Sarkel may have been part of a larger programme involving the construction of several other fortresses in the basins of middle and lower Don.40 he valuable contribution of this snippet of written Byzantine information is a precise date (840–1) for the construction of a key component of this new network of Khazar fortresses facing north and west. It then becomes relatively easy to answer the crucial question—what new circumstances led the Khazars to improve this sector of their perimeter defences and to initiate what looks like a rapprochement with Byzantium. For the period between 820 and 840 saw a change in the political coniguration of western Eurasia of immense importance—the consolidation of Rus power in northern Russia and their irst exploitation of the enticing waterways leading south towards Khazar territory and the Caspian and

Black Seas.41 Perception of the potential danger posed by the Rus was surely the prime motivation for the development of a new system of forward bases, which could, of course, play a defensive role but which were probably designed with a more ofensive purpose in mind—to extend Khazar authority to a wide intermediate zone of the steppes and wooded steppes beyond the core territories of the khaganate (thereby barring or at least braking Rus expansion) and, if possible, to exercise some inluence over the Rus themselves. he impressive defences of the fortresses, geometrically planned, built of limestone or brick, with towers at regular intervals, were, it may be surmised, designed to overawe a northern adversary unfamiliar with southern military engineering skills.42 Very little useful information can be extracted from Byzantine sources about relations with the khaganate in the last century of its existence. We may know, thanks to the one and only Byzantine report of an embassy sent to Itil, that negotiations took place in 861. We may observe that the embassy was dispatched soon ater the irst Rus attack on Constantinople. We may surmise that the prime objective was to prevent any repetition through Khazar good oices. But we are let entirely in the dark as to whether or not the Khazars had a hand in organising the attack.43 Equal uncertainty hangs over the next great crisis afecting Byzantium in the north, in the 890s—the collapse of Leo VI’s anti-Bulgar policy when his own army was defeated and his allies, the Hungarians, were driven from the Pontic steppes by a Bulgar-Pecheneg alliance.44 We may suspect that the Pecheneg action was authorised by the Khazars, since it entailed crossing or passing close by the core territories of the khaganate, but there is no way of conirming this. he greatest historiographical failure came, however, in the tenth century. he turbulent, oten antagonistic relations between the khaganate and Byzantium detailed in the Genizah Letter, are passed over in perfect silence.45 No hint is dropped

that the Khazars sponsored the second, more dangerous Rus assault on Constantinople and its hinterland in 941. Not one word is written about the co-ordinated campaigns of Rus and Oghuz Turks which broke the power of the khaganate in the 960s.46 Historians naturally look to Byzantium, which kept a wary eye on developments in the northern world, for at least an outline of the main developments there in the irst half of the tenth century. It is surely not unreasonable to be shocked to ind so little reported, even on topics as important to Byzantines as their dealings with several of the leading powers of the region—Rus and Hungarians as well as Khazars. However, the loss felt most keenly by the latterday observer is the failure of Byzantine sources to trace the evolving relations of Rus and Khazars. Little trust can be placed in the Russian Primary Chronicle, narrowly focused as it is on Kiev and so coloured by hindsight,47 and it is impossible to extract a considered estimate of the balance of power from Arab historians and geographers. We are therefore let to conjecture whether or not the Khazars exercised a general, light oversight over the widely separated Rus principalities of the Volga and Dniepr basins in the ninth century and whether or not they succeeded in maintaining it deep into the tenth century. I incline to think that they did so (limsy and indirect though the evidence be), and that the history of early Rus cannot be understood properly unless it be placed in a context of Khazar power projected deep into the northern world.48

Before taking a closer look at these various passages, we must examine the text as a whole. his is, of course, an elementary procedure, which must be followed in the case of any source before it is put to historical use.

It is a very odd text, with several puzzling features. (i) It is untidy. Raw notes co-exist with properly edited material. here is a fair amount of duplication. here are surprising juxtapositions and sudden jumps.

And it was badly designed for its ostensible purpose of educating the boy, save for the opening two sections (ch. 1–13) which irst reduce Byzantium’s northern diplomacy to simple rules of thumb and then supply arguments for rejecting requests by northern peoples for grants of Byzantine regalia, the recipe for Greek Fire, or marriage alliances with the imperial family.

contributions in cash and horses from the Peloponnese in lieu of military service in southern Italy, or a full narrative of the ups and downs in the history of Bosporos in late antiquity have very little to do with the main diplomatic subject. Nonetheless there is a coherent core to the text (chapters 27–46), dealing with four zones of active Byzantine diplomacy (southern Italy, the Balkans, the Pontic steppes, and western Transcaucasia). (iv) Most of the historical material embedded in this diplomatic core peters out around 900, some ity years before Constantine began work on it around 948. (v) Finally there is a striking anomaly in the very heart of the text. Its historico-diplomatic core fails to deal with several of Byzantium’s most important neighbours, recent and current, namely the dominant Germanic powers (formerly Carolingian, now Ottonian) of transalpine Europe, the Balkan Bulgars, the Khazar khaganate (simply glimpsed of stage in the northern dossier, chapters 37–42), and the leading powers of the contemporary Near East (the Buyids of western Iran and Iraq, the Hamdanids of Jazira and northern Syria, the Ikhshidids of southern Syria and Egypt). hese various conundra can be solved with the aid of a single hypothesis—a variant of Romilly Jenkins’ view that the text was composed in two stages.51 (i) he emperor was personally responsible for the work in its inal, uninished form. No self-respecting clerk in the imperial secretariat would have dared submit such slip-shod copy. It follows that the miscellaneous notes scattered through the text are Constantine’s, amounting to something like a small commonplace book of materials which caught his attention. (ii) Constantine took the decision to present the text to his son at a late stage in his work on it. His eforts to transform it into an educative tract were conined to the addition of the opening two sections (ch. 1–13). Hence the text as a whole continued to relect the interests of the father rather than catering to those of the son. (iii) Constantine was responsible for the inclusion of the variegated materials which give the text its disorganised character. hey may be classiied broadly as anecdotal and antiquarian supplements to other works which he either sponsored or edited: the De hematibus (hence the wealth of administrative material which has given the text its misleading conventional title); the De Cerimoniis (hence a brief history of the ships used for imperial progresses by sea); and the Excerpta Historica (hence the long extract from a local history of Bosporos in chapter 53). (iv) he crucial point is that Constantine was not responsible for the formation of

the historico-diplomatic core of the DAI, but merely introduced scholia and some more substantial additions into a pre-existing text. he date at which each of the four individual dossiers were originally compiled can be determined on the basis of a very few positive indicators (in the Balkan and Transcaucasian dossiers) and of that striking general feature already noted, namely the way that all four regional historical narratives peter out ater 900. It is likely—although it cannot be proved—that the core of the DAI was commissioned at the very beginning of the tenth century by the Emperor Leo VI, as one of several handbooks in which knowledge, historical knowledge in this case as in that of his military handbook, was harnessed to the service of the state. (v) It was carefully planned at this irst editorial stage (when the work was probably delegated to individual desks in the Dromos, the department charged with telecommunications and foreign afairs). It was designed to be a text dealing with actual and potential client-peoples in four arenas of active Byzantine diplomacy. Rival great powers, Germanic, Bulgar, Khazar and Arab, were deliberately omitted. hey were the adversaries against whom the clients were to be used. Of the four regions picked out for special attention in the original project of Leo VI, one and one only was treated systematically and in detail in the course of Constantine Porphyrogenitus’ later editorial work. Other contemporary Byzantine interests—chiely in Italy and the Mediterranean—can be glimpsed but only very intermittently in the miscellany of notes with which Constantine framed and ampliied the slim, well-targeted manual commissioned by his father. His own predominant concern was with the north—not unreasonably since that was the quarter from which the most direct and menacing threats to the metropolitan heartland of the empire had come in the recent past. he Rus had launched a ierce attack on the capital and its Bithynian hinterland in 941. he Hungarians had devastated hrace in 934 and 943. Only the sudden death of Symeon (in 927) had halted Bulgar expansion westward over much of the central and western Balkans, and peace, underpinned though it was with a marriage alliance, could not but look fragile in Byzantine eyes. It is not surprising then that the lessons in diplomacy which Constantine gave his son (ch. 1–13) dealt exclusively with the north. Two distinct Byzantine views of the north are thus presented in the DAI. By comparing and contrasting the picture pieced together and given historical depth by those who drated the northern dossier (ch. 37–42) for Leo VI with Constantine’s more schematic account which focuses on the potential for conlict between northern peoples, it is possible to gain some idea of major changes in Byzantine perceptions and

in the realities behind them in the irst half of the tenth century. But care has to be taken to clean away, as delicately and discriminatingly as possible, the editorial additions made by Constantine to the northern dossier compiled ity years earlier. It is a matter of removing the inal editorial patina without either leaving some of it attached to the original dossier or scraping away part of that dossier. his is, in my judgement, a feasible exercise. In general, the later, Constantinian additions can be identiied without too much diiculty. hey consist, in the main, of four types of material: chronological scholia to take account of the additional ity years which had passed since the northern dossier was put together; geographical scholia intended to clarify but liable to confuse; passages bringing the dossier partially up to date; and substantial additions of more or less entertaining historical narrative, satisfying Constantine’s taste for the anecdotal. A detailed analysis of the northern dossier, taking note of Constantine’s additions, is undertaken in the next section. For the moment, though, we should pause to consider the two views of the north presented by the DAI (with the Constantinian material extracted from the main body of Leo’s northern dossier) and should take stock of what can be learned of the role of the Khazar khaganate (as well as of its relations to Byzantium) at the beginning and in the middle of the tenth century. he original dossier was put together ater one of the two major foreign policy initiatives of Leo VI ended in disaster in the 890s. he war which he engineered with the Balkan Bulgars went disastrously wrong ater a striking initial success, a devastating thrust south of the Danube by his Hungarian allies, probably in 892. he Byzantine ield army was intercepted south of the Haemus mountains and was decisively defeated at Bulgarophygon in the following year. he young Bulgar ruler Symeon thus gained a free hand in the north and was able to trump Byzantium’s steppe diplomacy in 897 by bringing in the Pechenegs to drive the Hungarians from the Pontic steppes into the Carpathian basin.52 he northern dossier contains information gathered once the dust had settled and a clear view could be obtained of the new political coniguration of the northern world. It concentrates on the two nomad peoples involved in those recent events. he tribal components of both Pechenegs and Hungarians are enumerated. heir diferent types of leadership, tribal and supratribal, are described.53

A general picture is given of the historical background to the recent convulsion on the steppes, one in which the Khazar khaganate can be seen as the hegemonic power, able to call on formidable steppe allies so as to impose its will when and where it chose.54 here is, however, no chapter devoted to the khaganate itself, no description of its history, institutions and geographical articulation (a loss of reliable, documentbased information to be lamented by all historians of the Khazars). It was excluded from detailed consideration, because it had engineered the Pecheneg attack on the Hungarians and was regarded as a hostile power. he omission of the Rus, who are only mentioned in passing in the northern dossier,55 is probably to be attributed to their distance and to the diiculties of communicating with them along the direct Dniepr route. It is also rather intriguing, since the chief outcome of the policy review instituted by Leo ater the debacle in the north (of which the gathering and sorting of intelligence material was a key part) appears to have been a decision to establish relations with the Rus, in the hope of using them as a counterweight against the Pechenegs, now irm allies of the Bulgars and occupying the Pontic steppes vacated by the Hungarians. Within a year or two of the compilation of the northern dossier, the Rus were being courted as potential clients, and were induced to sign treaties with Byzantium in 907 and 911. Fity years later, the Khazars were still irmly classed as enemies, against whom neighbouring peoples (Alans, Oghuz Turks and Volga Bulgars are named) were to be targeted.56 his was only to be expected ater several decades of uneasy relations, which had culminated in an aggressive act of war on the part of the khaganate, when Rus sea-raiders were redirected against Constantiople in 941 and did immense damage to its suburbs and the coastlands of Bithynia. hey were also clearly ranked above the two other major contemporary adversaries of Byzantium in the north, the Hungarians and the Rus, who, like them, might make importunate demands of the Byzantines.57 he DAI thus corroborates the evidence cited above from the De Cerimoniis (n. 32) for their great power status at this late stage in their history.

Unlike his father, Constantine was narrowly concerned with international relations in the north. Hence little information is to be expected on the domestic afairs of the khaganate. Some items can, however, be extracted. A name—the Nine Districts (klimata) is given for the heartland of the khaganate (from which came ‘all the livelihood and plenty’ of the Khazars),58 probably to be identiied with the huge salient of the west Eurasian steppes pushing south between the Caspian and Black Seas, shielded on the north by the Volga and Don and on the south by the Caucasus. he political strength of the khaganate may also be gauged from what is and is not said about its relations with its neighbours. For the opening section of the DAI deals with politically feasible conlicts between neighbouring peoples which might serve Byzantine interests in the north. hree neighbouring peoples were identiied as potential enemies of the Khazars. he Alans were singled out for special attention—they were easily accessible by sea, Christianity was making headway among them in the early tenth century, and they had already demonstrated their worth as clients, having gone to war (unsuccessfully) against the Khazars some time around 930. he Oghuz Turks were mentioned, quite naturally, qua principal eastern neighbours and most dangerous nomad rivals of the khaganate.59 Finally, it may perhaps be inferred that the Volga Bulgars, already showing signs of restlessness at the time of Ibn Fadlan’s visit in 922, subsequently loosened their ties with the khaganate, so that they could be regarded by Byzantium as a useful potential counterweight. In contrast to this apparent attenuation of their authority in the middle Volga region, there are indications that the Khazars were continuing to exercise extensive inluence over the Rus and the Pechenegs. For no word is said about deploying either of them against the Khazars. Arguments from silence are weak, but less so than usual in the case of the Pechenegs (the Khazars are absent from what looks like a considered summary of potential Pecheneg targets),60 while a degree of Rus subordination is positively attested in the Genizah Letter.

was covert gathering of intelligence (ch. 6). Evidence can thus be culled from the DAI
which contradicts the statement in the Arab geographical tradition (Ibn Rusteh, tr. Wiet,
p. 157 and Gardîzî, tr. Martinez, p. 154) that the Khazars waged annual wars against
the Pechenegs. A speciic crisis of unknown date seems to have been transmuted into
endemic warfare.

he DAI thus makes it plain that Byzantine-Khazar relations were bad around 900, and that there had been no improvement by 950. he reason is probably to be sought in the geopolitics of the steppe world in the 890s, rather than in a growing religious antagonism. he conversion to Judaism of the ruling elite (or much of it) did not afect the traditional Khazar toleration of diverse faiths at home (Arab sources should be believed on this point, since it afected Muslims in the khaganate), and it is unlikely to have sufused foreign policy with bigotry.61 he great power status of the khaganate is also clearly recognised by the DAI in both editorial phases. here may have been a perceptible weakening of the khaganate’s hold over two client-peoples, the Alans and the VolgaBulgars, by 950, but it was still a formidable force in the north. he fatal blow struck by the Rus and Oghuz Turks within twenty years was probably efective because it was entirely unexpected. As for the internal organisation of the khaganate, the DAI adds virtually nothing to the scraps of information picked up from other Byzantine sources—merely the name for the core territory of the khaganate. It cannot therefore be used as a much-needed control on Arab geographical texts which may mix up and rework information of diferent dates and origins. But we should not abandon hope. Two important subordinate peoples are the central subjects of the northern dossier compiled on Leo VI’s orders, which forms one of the four components of the historicodiplomatic core of the DAI. Variegated material, most of it of high quality, is preserved about their institutions, their past movements and their past relations with the Khazars. he DAI may therefore open a window into the interior life of the khaganate as an imperial confederacy, may enable us to see something of the dynamic processes of Khazar government insofar as it afected client-peoples. It is worth taking a closer look at the contents of the northern dossier.

A great deal of information is packed into the northern dossier of the DAI. Something is said about geography (a detailed survey being given of the northern coast of the Black Sea) and about manmade structures

which testiied to past Roman outreach beyond the Danube.62 he main concern, though, is with the history and institutions of the Pechenegs and the Hungarians. Leo VI realised that diplomacy required historical understanding of the peoples with whom Byzantium dealt. He therefore made sure that summaries of what was known or could be learned about the pasts of foreign peoples were included in the four main component parts of his DAI. In the case of the northern dossier, information was gathered about the situation before the crisis of the 890s, reaching back to an earlier upheaval which had transformed the political coniguration of the steppe world on the edge of the core territory of the Khazar khaganate. his earlier upheaval bears a general resemblance to that which shook Leo VI’s regime and eventually discharged the Hungarians into the Carpathian basin: the Khazars were the prime movers; the Hungarians came under attack from the Pechenegs; and the outcome of the war was a migration west by both peoples, the Pechenegs occupying land vacated by the Hungarians.he Hungarians were the main protagonists in this irst episode. he role of the Pechenegs, ater their defeat by the Khazars (unaided on this occasion), was to act as Khazar agents. he following items of information are supplied: the Hungarians had ‘served as allies in all the Khazars’ wars’; ater their defeat by the Pechenegs, they split in two, one group (probably the smaller) migrating east ‘towards Persia’, the other moving west; this latter group was subsequently reinforced by a body of Khazars who had staged a rebellion in the khaganate and had been defeated; inally, the Khazars decided to upgrade the status of the Hungarian leadership and invested a client-ruler from a new dynasty.63 his tranche of early history with its strong Hungarian focus is almost certainly derived from Hungarian sources. It appears to represent Hungarian dynastic history at an early stage in its formation. It must be handled with care, since it may have been adapted to suit contemporary interests at the beginning of the tenth century, but it may be assumed that its outline of events corresponds to historical reality. his irst chunk of historical material is followed by an account, written mainly from a Byzantine perspective, of events in the steppe world in the 890s (discussed in section II above).64 Besides this historical mate

rial, the dossier provides up-to-date information about both peoples. heir main divisional or tribal components (eight in both cases) are enumerated and named. An account, with rather more precision in the case of the Pechenegs, is given of both peoples’ geographical dispositions. Contemporary leaders are named for each of the Pecheneg divisions or tribes, and the constitutional arrangements governing elegibility for election as such a leader are summarised. Distinctions of status between divisions or tribes are noted: the name Kangar was conined to the three leading divisions of the Pechenegs, who were distinguished for their courage and nobility; the irst and militarily most prestigious of the Hungarian tribes was that composed of Khazars, known as the Kavars.65 his material, it should be noted, is remarkably precise and well set out. It looks like a digest of Byzantine observations and intelligence about both peoples. It provides evidence of the highest quality about two peoples in the Khazar sphere of inluence. his evidence is undoubtedly superior to most of that circulating among contemporary and near-contemporary Arab geographical writers. All of these passages, dealing with history, institutions and geography, probably belonged to Leo’s original dossier. Constantine’s three main additions are easily distinguishable: a set of notes on Hungarian titles and personages, coming down to his own time;66 an anecdote about Svyatopluk, last ruler of Moravia, which is only loosely connected with the rest of the dossier;67 and a version of the Sarkel story, drawn from the same source as that used by heophanes Continuatus.68 It is tempting also to credit Constantine with various geographical glosses, including seven short passages in which the territories held by the Hungarians before and ater their two migations are named and deined in terms of their rivers.69 hese look like scholia intended to clarify points of geography, but they serve only to create confusion, as if the editor had not fully understood the material he was commenting upon. No other text, Byzantine or non-Byzantine, can match the northern dossier of the DAI as a source for the history of the Hungarians and the

Pechenegs in the ninth century. None can give the same insight into the internal functioning of the khaganate as an imperial polity. A distant observer in the Germanic world such as Regino of Prüm is unable to document steppe history with precision and accuracy.70 Later versions of Hungarian dynastic history in Latin contain far too much fanciful and tendentious material to be useful,71 while no contemporary Arab source, with the single exception of Ibn Fadlān, can ofer comparably detailed, datable and authoritative information.72 It is upon the evidence of DAI, carefully analysed and critically evaluated, that any modern reconstruction of early Hungarian history must be founded. he Hungarians’ connection with the Khazars antedated their irst defeat and relocation. he implication of the phrasing used by the text is that their service as allies was of long standing. he igure of three years which is given must surely be corrupt. hree hundred years should probably envisaged as the original reading, a igure which should not be taken literally but as indicating that the Hungarians had been Khazar clients since the formation of the khaganate. A long period of sustained and close contact of this sort provides the context within which Finno-Ugrianspeakers could have made extensive lexical borrowings from Turkishspeaking Khazars or Volga Bulgars.73 he Hungarians’ territory at this time, which was subsequently taken over by the Pechenegs, is clearly deined at the start of the Pecheneg chapter of the DAI as land between the Volga and Ural rivers, to the south-west of the Ural mountains. his corresponds in general to the location, Bashkiria, suggested by modern Hungarian scholars, on the basis mainly of linguistic and archaeological evidence.74 he Hungarians can therefore be seen to have acted as the eastern shield of the core territory of the Khazar khaganate up to the time of the irst great convulsion of the steppe reported in the DAI. he date of that event can be roughly ixed, once it is established where the western component of the Hungarians moved ater their initial defeat. Again there is a clear deinition to be found in the Pecheneg chapter: the Pontic steppes, on both banks of the Dniepr, were held by

the Hungarians until their second forced migration over the Carpathians, when the Pechenegs once again took their place.75 he Hungarians’ presence there as early as the 830s may be inferred from a notice in the Logothete’s Chronicle which reports that a Byzantine operation to rescue prisoners-of-war resettled by the Balkan Bulgars beyond the Danube was impeded by Hungarian attack at that time.76 It may perhaps then be hazarded that there was a connection between the relocation of the Hungarians and Khazar perception of a new threat from the north, from the Rus.77 On this hypothesis, the function of the Hungarians, backed by the Don basin fortresses, would have been to project Khazar power far to the west and north-west of their core territory, and to counter a future extension of Rus power into the Dniepr basin.78 It was ater their arrival in the Pontic steppes that the Khazar Kavars joined the Hungarians and established a degree of authority over them. he tribe formed by their three clans became the senior tribe, ranking irst because of its ighting prowess, and gave a pronounced Turkish cast to what was a predominantly Finno-Ugrian tribal confederation. he hybrid grouping was given a new name, that of Turks.79 here is nothing untoward in this account picked up by the DAI from Hungarian sources at the beginning of the tenth century, save for one element, the story that the Kavars were rebels against rather than agents of the khaganate. It is a most implausible story, given the unequivocal evidence that the Khazars

At this point I part company from Kristó, Hungarian History, pp. 131–45, who (1) dis
associates the Hungarians’ move west around 830 from their irst defeat by the Pechenegs,
(2) trusts the DAI reading of three years for the Khazar-Hungarian alliance, (3) dates
its start around 840, (4) has the Khazars relocate the Hungarians at that time east of the
Don, to act as their eastern frontier guards, and (5) introduces a third migration around
850 (some Hungarians going east, others west back to the Pontic steppes), which is that
brought about by Pecheneg military action. his is an unnecessarily complicated sce
nario, for which no positive evidence is to be found in the sources.
79 DAI, ch. 39 & 40.1–7. he only satisfactory explanation for the consistent use of the
name Turks in the DAI is that it was the accepted designation of the Hungarians at the
time of the northern dossier’s compilation. he name cannot have originated as a self
designation (given its inappropriateness) but was surely imposed by a superior Turkish
authority, the Khazar khaganate—contra Róna-Tas, Hungarians and Europe, pp. 275–8.

were in control of events both before and ater the conjoining of the two groups and that they would have had every reason to oppose any buildup of power close to their territory by a group of defeated and doubtless vengeful rebels. he khaganate’s control aterwards is made manifest in the investiture episode, which is dated ‘not long ater’ the Hungarians’ migration west.80 Hungarian dynastic tradition was coy about the tribe to which the new dynasty belonged, but it can readily be identiied as the highest-ranking, Khazar tribe.81 Once the Hungarians had broken free of Khazar control (towards the end of the ninth century), this ruling house, of which the most noted early representative was Arpad, did not advertise its Khazar origins and probably sought to distance itself from the khaganate by devising the story of the rebellion, which gave the misleading impression that the new amalgam was formed quite independently in the steppes to the west of the khaganate. Reality, though, still dimly visible, was very diferent: determined to ensure the future pliability of their Hungarian clients ater their relocation around 830 in the Pontic steppes, the khaganate grated on a Khazar tribe and gave it delegated authority. Close, critical scrutiny of the historical material transmitted by the DAI thus suggests that the Khazars restructured the Hungarians at the time of their enforced move. A similar conclusion may also be drawn from the detailed information pieced together by Byzantine observers about Pecheneg organisation and institutions.82 here is every sign that the Pechenegs too had been subjected to a programme of thorough-going reform. Although nothing is reported of the circumstances (indeed the institutional changes have to be teased out of the material presented in the text), it seems improbable that they were of very recent origin (dating from the 890s). Had this been so, some hint might be expected in a text composed so soon aterwards. In any case, events moved so fast during this second convulsion of the steppes, that the Khazars were probably hard put to maintain some control over the Pechenegs and were almost certainly in no position to push through a series of radical internal reforms. It seems safer therefore to associate the reforms with the early ninth century defeat of the Pechenegs and their

irst incorporation into the Khazar empire. Conirmation is to hand. For the Pechenegs, like the Hungarians, were renamed ater their defeat and displacement: they were stripped of their old name, Kangar (which now became an honoriic, attached to the three leading tribes), and were now designated Pecheneg for the irst time.83 he imposition of a new name is best taken as marking the completion of a process of restructuring designed to make them reliable clients for the forseeable future. he following reconstruction of the Khazar reform programme may be proposed on the evidence of subsequent Pecheneg organisation as revealed in the DAI. First there was a general reshaping of the old tribes. hese were replaced by a set of eight new tribes, which were also termed military divisions. Each of these divisions was subdivided into ive subordinate units. he neatness of these arrangements and the military connotations of the word thema used of the new tribes point strongly to intervention from outside and from above.84 his can be conirmed from the names assigned to the new divisions. hese are all evidently artiicial, consisting in most cases of two elements, a title and a horse-colour.85 Second, an unusual system of cross-cousin succession was instituted for the transmission of the command over each division. his created an artiicial dynasty within each division, which could be relied upon precisely because it was artiicial and dependent on Khazar backing. he requirement that power circulate widely within it ensured that it was of a considerable size and therefore self-sustaining, while the apparent absence of a predetermined circulatory pattern seems designed to maximise competition between claimants and thus to require intervention by a superior (Khazar) authority at each succession (to ensure an orderly election and a fair and generally acceptable outcome).86 here is one striking omission in the DAI’s account of Pecheneg organisation.

to supervise elections of divisional leaders, as indeed also to co-ordinate actions involving more than one division and to regulate conlicts which might arise between them. Higher authority evidently existed from the time of the original reforms but has to be sought outside the set of Pecheneg divisions. Once the question is put in these terms, there is no diiculty about identifying and locating the superior authority programmed in by the reforms.87 It was surely the central Khazar apparatus of government which regulated Pecheneg afairs. A policy of direct rule was adopted in their case, to assure the Khazars efective direction of military operations and thus to guarantee the reliability of the vital eastern military shield of their heartlands. he Hungarians were subjected to more drastic measures. hey were divided in two and sent to opposite ends of the Khazar sphere of inluence. he western group, probably the larger, then had three Khazar clans grated on to form a new leading tribe. here was a sharp cultural as well as political distinction between this leading Khazar element and the rump of the Hungarians, whose previous name is given as Savartoi Asphaloi.88 he former belonged to the governing elite among the nomadic peoples of the khaganate and spoke Turkish. he latter were one of several nomadic client-peoples and had a diferent, Finno-Ugrian ancestry.89 here are several indications that traditional tribal divisions among the Hungarians may have been remodelled on the same general lines as those of the Pechenegs. For the new Khazar-led people comprised the same number of tribes (eight) as did the Pechenegs ater re-organisation. he Kavars, the new leading tribe, was, as has been seen, an artiicial construct of three apparently independent Khazar clans. Considerable re-organisation of the seven Finno-Ugrian tribes is also suggested by the apparently Turkish names assigned to ive of them (renaming once again being taken as an indicator of re-organisation). he retention of FinnoUgrian names by two tribes, listed in second and third places ater the Kavars, suggests that they may have been assigned a status superior to that of the majority of the Hungarians (akin to that of the three Kangar

divisions among the Pechenegs), and thus may have been co-opted as the principal aides of the Khazar leadership of the new grouping.90 A very diferent system of political management was adopted in the case of the Hungarians. Instead of a policy of direct rule, Khazar control was exercised through the leading Khazar element in the new grouping. Apart from the strong bonds established by a shared past and a common culture, the Kavars could be expected to remain highly responsive to Khazar authority, since they needed it to maintain and consolidate their position among the Hungarians. But it was essential to implant a stable leadership in the Kavars themselves, both to ensure their cohesion and to guarantee eicient communications to and from the central Khazar authorities. he model chosen was a conventional monarchical one, with lineal succession in a single family. here may well be some embroidery of the facts in the DAI version, but there is nothing implausible in the account given of the consultation process preceding the choice of a ruling family and the investiture of a irst ruler. he new ruler was of course chosen from within the Khazar leading tribe, a fact masked but not concealed by Hungarian dynastic history.91 he new name acquired by the Hungarians takes on a new signiicance in the light of the foregoing analysis. Renaming was an act of some importance: it was an assertion of authority by the Khazars, part of the process of subordinating a people; it was an intervention from above, intended to contribute to a change of self-identity, hence a key component in a process of restructuring. he choice of Turks as the new collective name for the Khazar-led Hungarians suggests that the ultimate aim of the Khazars was not simply to remodel them but to expunge their Finno-Ugrian identity. heir intention was to subject the new grouping to aggressive cultural bombardment from within and without and thereby, ater several generations, to absorb them into the Turkish majority among the nomads of their empire.92 Such appear to have been the two reform programmes instituted by the Khazars to strengthen their geopolitical position in the irst half of the ninth century, when they irst sensed the rising power of the Rus in

the north. he chief common feature was a radical remodelling of the tribal structure of both client peoples. By their actions the Khazars demonstrated that they could conceive of social re-engineering on a grand scale and that they had the administrative capacity to carry it through. here could be no clearer evidence of the high degree of ideological development reached by steppe nomad peoples in the early middle ages, nor of the eicacy of the apparatus of government at their disposal. No less impressive is the lexibility of approach demonstrated in the diferent policies adopted towards the two peoples. he khaganate had several management strategies to hand. Two, direct rule and investiture of a client-ruler belonging to a detachment of the ruling Khazar stratum of the empire, are revealed by the DAI. But resort was probably had to other strategies in other circumstances. hus a rather looser form of management is suggested for the Volga Bulgars, by the report (admittedly relecting a Volga Bulgar point of view) of Ibn Fadlān.93 Other systems, including the appointment of Khazar governors and recognition of local tribal chiefs, may be envisaged for the wide range of sedentary subject peoples. Arrangements are likely to have varied according to the size of a subject people, their level of institutional development and the geographical disposition of their territories. he chief contribution of Byzantine sources is thus made by a single text, the DAI. It provides a clear view of a strikingly invasive form of client-management practised by the khaganate. Displacement of large population groups can be corroborated from archaeological evidence (the clearest case is that of Alans uprooted from the North Caucasus and relocated in a belt of wooded steppe in the upper Donets and middle Don basins).94 Reconiguration of peoples may be just detectable (chiely in diversity of burial practices at individual sites). But archaeology cannot rival the clarity of vision ofered by the DAI, nor can earlier Roman and Byzantine sources dealing with other nomad peoples in the westernmost reaches of the Eurasian steppes, nor other written sources dealing with the Khazar khaganate. he DAI provides high-grade, fascinating evidence of a nomad imperial polity at the peak of its powers and master of its own and many other peoples’ destinies.

ALKHAZAR AND ASSAQÂLIBA: CONTACTS. CONFLICTS?
T.M. Kalinina
he terms as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar are oten encountered in the Arab-Persian medieval sources. he irst term—as-Saqâliba (singular—saqlâb, sometimes—siqlâb) is the Arabic form of the Greek term , (and late Latin Sclavi). In modern scholarship there is a tendency to identify this word with Latin sclavus—“slave”. It is connected with the extensive expansion of the slave trade in Medieval Europe. Starting from the sixth century, the Slavs, scattered and migrating over vast territories from the Balkans to the Volga river and from the Adriatic to the Baltic seas, took part in the turbulent political life of Europe and became one of the major components of this commerce in humans. Combinations of the denominations as-Saqâliba, al-Khazar, Burtâs, at-Turk etc., which are oten encountered in medieval Arabic works, especially geographic treatises, allow us to think that in those works the term as-Saqâliba had an ethnic meaning. he term al-Khazar was used in the works of medieval Arab-Persian writers with regard to a people, to an Iqlîm “a clime” (in this case a geographical zone is meant), and to a state (BGA I, 10, 220, 223; BGA II–2, 15, 394, 396). he combination of those two terms in the medieval Arabic writings is the subject of this paper. One of the widely spread themes in Arabic literature is the origin of peoples. hose Arabic authors who described the Biblical genealogy of peoples placed as-Saqâliba, al-Khazar and a number of other peoples in the Northern and Eastern regions of the world among the ranks of the descendants of Japheth, the son of Noah. At-Tabarî (832–923), author of a world history, referring to Ibn Ishâq (eighth century), included among Japhet’s descendants at-Turk, as-Saqâliba, the peoples Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj [Gog and Magog] (at-Tabarî I, 211); in another fragment among Japheth’s children he mentioned al-Khazar, at-Turk, as-Saqâliba et al. (at-Tabarî I, 216–218). Sa‘îd ibn al-Batrîq (died 939) listed a multitude of the descendants of Japheth: atTurk, Bajânak (Pecheneg), at-Taġazġaz (Toquz-Oghuz), at-Tibbat (the inhabitants of Tibet), Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj, al-Khazar, the peoples of the Caucasus, ar-Rum (Byzantium), ar-Rûs, al-Bulġar, as-Saqâliba et al. (Seippel,

53). In the anonymous work Muhtasar al- Ajâ ib (tenth century), which a number of scholars have identiied as Ahbâr az-Zamân, which is, in turn, ascribed to al-Mas‘ûdî, there is a notice in the description of the Burjân people as one of Japheth’s descendants (presumably referring to the Bulgars on the Danube River), that they were ighting “with ar-Rum, as-Saqâliba, at-Turk” (Kriukov, 205). Gardîzî (XI century), citing Ibn al-Muqafa‘ (eighth century), claims that Japheth received the lands: at-Turk, as-Saqâliba, Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj—up to China; among the Turks Gardîzî mentioned the peoples of the Khazar, the Oghuz, the Qarluqs et al. (Gardîzî, 41–42). Referring to Sa‘îd ibn Musayyab (died 713/714) al-Bakrî (XI century) also named Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj, at-Turk, as-Saqâliba (Kunik-Rosen I, 18) as Japheth’s descendants (Kunik–Rosen I, 18) without mentioning here the Khazars, although it is possible that this name is not given by the author here only because the speciic information on the Khazars in al-Bakrî dates back to another primary source, rather than a genealogical fragment, namely the work of al-Istakhrî (al-Bakri I, 445–448). In the twelth century, an anonymous historian, the author of the work Mujmal at-Tawârîkh, considered the Turks, the Khazars, the Rûs, the Burtâs, the Slavs and other peoples of Northern and Eastern Europe as Japheth’s descendants, personifying some of them, such as Turk, Chin, Khazar, Rus, and Saqlâb as eponymous forefathers of the tribes (Novoseltzev 1990, 78). In the abovementioned examples, the peoples al-Khazar and asSaqâliba are placed within the East-European and Asiatic circle of the peoples—the descendants Japheth. Al-Ya qûbî (ninth century) in his “History” several times referred to biblical genealogies of peoples. In one fragment of his work he wrote that as-Saqâliba belonged to one of Japheth’s descendants—Jumar, but that at-Turk and al-Khazar belonged to another of Japheth’s descendant—Mash (al-Ja qubi I, 13). A similar theme is found at al-Mas ûdî (tenth century) (Maçoudi I, 78–79). In another extract al-Ya qûbî says that “the states and peoples of as-Sin, al-Hind, as-Sind, at-Turk, al-Khazar, at-Tubbat, al-Bulġâr, ad-Dailam and that which adjoins the land of Khorasan fell to the lot of Noah, son of Japheth,” but doesn’t mention here as-Saqâliba (al-Ja‘qubi I, 17). In yet another description of the peoples, al-Ya qûbî singled out al-Khazar, but now as the “children” of the third scion of Japheth—hogarma, among the peoples and states close to the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, but here, too, as-Saqâliba are not mentioned (al-Ja qubi I, 203).



ALKHAZAR and ASSAQÂLIBA: contacts. conflicts? 197
In the abovementioned examples although the peoples as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar are mentioned among the descendants of Japheth, they are, nonetheless, markedly separated from one another. his tendency to bring together the descendants of Japheth as peoples of both the Western and East-European circle of the peoples can be found in the writtings of Ibn Qutaiba (ninth century), who ennumerates as-Saqâliba, Burjân, al-Ispân (the Spaniards), at-Turks, al-Khazar, Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj (Ibn Coteiba, 14). Al-Mas ûdî names those living “under Capricorn” (that is, in the North), as the “children” of Japheth—Ifranja (the Franks), as-Saqâliba, Nukubarda (the Langobards), al-Ishbân (the Spaniards), Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj, at-Turks, al-Khazar, Burjân, al-Lân (the Alans) etc. (Maçoudi III, 66). In the work Muhtasar al- Ajâ’ib, al-Ishban, ar-Rûs, al-Burjân, al-Khazar, as-Saqâliba, Furs (the Persians) etc. are named among Japheth’s descendants (Kriukov, 196). Al-Bakrî mentioned already above, in one of the fragments of his book called the descendants of Japheth as-Saqâliba Burjân, the “inidel” al-Ishbân (i.e. the Christian Spaniards) as well as at-Turk, al-Khazar, Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj (al-Bakri I, 87–88). Yâqût wrote (in the thirteenth century), referring to Hishâm ibn al-Kalbî (died 819), that as-Saqâliba are the “brothers” of the Armenians, the Greeks, the Franks and at the same time all of them are the descendants of Japheth (Jacut III, 405). As one can see from the abovementioned examples, the peoples of as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar in the Biblical genealogy were placed by the majority of the sources already noted alongside the East European peoples as the descendants of Japheth, but they were not termed “neighbours” or closely related peoples. In the lists of the peoples, however, the Turks and the Khazars were deemed rather close. Evidence for this came from traditions which were far from the Biblical genealogies and which were relected in the books of early Arab scholars—mathematicians and astronomers. hus, Muhammad ibn Mûsâ al-Khwârizmî (the irst half of ninth century) in his “he Book of the Image of the Earth” based on the “Geography” of Cl. Ptolemy (second century) mentioned in the list of the towns of the sixth “clime” (latitude zone) the point named “al-Khazar”. According to this information the town was situated on the bank of the river “Long”, corresponding to Ptolemy’s Jaxartes and the present-day Syr Darya. According to the geographical co-ordinates in book of al-Khwârizmî the town Navâkat was situated to the East of the point al-Khazar. he nearest towns of the ith “clime” (zone) were Tarbend,



198 t.m. kalinina
Isfîjâb, Banâkath, Khujand (Khodjent). So, the town al-Khazar was found in the limits of Central Asia, somewhere in the middle of the Syr Darya stream. At the same time, all these towns were situated, according to al-Khwârizmî’s materials, within the part of the world marked as populated by the Turks and corresponding to the Inner Skythia in the book of Ptolemy (Al-Huwarizmi, 28, 32, 105, 147; Daunicht I, 110; Kalinina 1988, 39, 40, 48, 74–77). he astronomer al-Farghânî (ninth century) ennumerating the Earth’s “climes” noted in the sixth “climate” the land of Khazars which was situated, according to his conceptions, between the land Yâjûj in the extreme East of the Oikumene and the Jurjân Sea, that is the Caspian Sea (Alfraganus, 38; Kalinina 1988, 130, 132, 135). Ibn Khurradâdhbeh (IX century) also placed the Khazars in Skythia (BGA VI, 154). And Abu-l-Faraj ibn al-‘Ibrî (Bar Hebraeus, thirteenth century) retelling the information of Michael the Syrian (twelth century) relating to the sixth century told a legend about the exit from Inner Skythia of three brothers, one of whom was the ancestor of the Khazar people (Marquart, 484, 485; Altheim I, 91). hus, there was a certain tendency to bring together the Turks and the Khazars in the Arab-Persian sources which did not preclude placing the one and the other among the descendants of Japheth, where among others, as-Saqâliba also happened to be. Considering the genealogy of peoples given by a variety of scholars it is possible on the whole to establish that the greater part of authors were of the opinion that as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar belonged rather to the common East-European circle of peoples; others placed as-Saqâliba rather in the European area, while al-Khazar—were assigned to the Asiatic area; although in any case these peoples were considered to be descendants of Japheth. In these overviews of the peoples, al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba, in the Arabo-Persian literary monuments are rarely placed alongside one another; rather, they are located in the vicinity of the Turks, the Rûs, the Bulghars; however, they are in the same region together with these East-European peoples. Ibn Khurradâdhbeh (IX century) and Ibn al-Faqîh (early tenth century), who used many of his data, recall an ancient tradition of dividing the Earth into parts, among was Ûrûfî (Europe). It included Andalus, as-Saqâliba, Rûm, Firanja, Tanja (Tanger) and the territories up to the borders of Misr (Egypt). Another part was called Isqûtiyâ (Skythia) to which, beside Armenia, Khorasan, and the lands of at-Turk, al-Khazar belonged (BGA VI, 155; BGA V, 7). In this case, the peoples were



ALKHAZAR and ASSAQÂLIBA: contacts. conflicts? 199
separated. In his Kitâb at-Tanbîh wa-l-Ishrâf, al-Mas ûdî reporting the contents of one of his previous books (which has not been preserved for us) named the peoples which he wrote about earlier in the following order: al-Hind, as-Sîn, at-Turk, al-Khazar, al-Lân, the peoples of the Caucasus Mountains, among whom he also mentioned al-Khazar as well as al-Abâr (the Avars), Burjân, ar-Rûs, al-Bulġar, Ifrandja, asSaqâliba etc. (BGA VIII, 184). In another fragment, al-Mas udi, mentioning a book of a Byzantine prisoner, Muslim Abu Muslim al-Jarmî, which has not been preserved, reported that it contained information about the peoples neighbouring with Byzantium—the Burjâns, the Avars, the Bulġars, the Slavs, the Khazars and others (BGA VIII, 191). Abu-l-Qasim Sa id al-Andalusî (eleventh century) gave a whole list of the peoples “who had nothing to do with science”; among them there were as-Sîn, Yâjûj wa-Mâjûj, at-Turk, Burtâs, as-Sarîr, al-Khazar, al-Lân, as-Saqâliba, al-Bulġar, Burjân and some other peoples, patently relating to the East-European area, athough further on the peoples of Africa are listed (Arabskije istochniki X–XIII vv., 193–194). Referring to the actual geographical information, the majority of the Arab scholars noted that as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar were territorially close. For example, in the same books of Ibn Khurrâdadhbeh and Ibn al-Faqîh there is information on the river running from as-Saqâliba, in the mouth of which the Khazar city Khamlîj was located, which was at the Caspian Sea. hat river according to these two authors was a trade route connecting the distant lands of as-Saqâliba and the Khazar city on the Caspian Sea (BGA VI, 124, 154–155; BGA V, 297–298). he viewpoints of the scholars ofering an exact identiication of the river Itil (the Volga river) with the Tanais (Don) can hardly be correct; rather, the Arab authors meant rather a large river route from the Slavs along the East European rivers including the Don river, and portages, the Volga, to Khazaria and into the Caspian Sea. Ibn Khurradâdhbeh wrote also that one of the “inhabited” quarters of the Earth, the northern one, included Armenia, Azerbaijan, the area of the South-western and Southern coast of the Caspian Sea as well as al-Khazar, as-Saqâliba, and al-Abâr (BGA VI, 117–118). Ibn al-Faqîh noted, following Ibn Khurradâdhbeh, the mountain chain which he named al-Qabq (the Caucasus), which ran through the boundaries of al-Khazar, al-Lân and up to the area of as-Saqâliba (the latter information is not available in the existing version of the Ibn Khurradâdhbeh’s book, BGA V, 295; BGA VI, 172–173). On the whole, these materials are devoted to idea that was then current in the Arabic literary tradition,



200 t.m. kalinina
according to which there was a single mountain chain embracing the world and running from the West to the East (Krachkovskii, 22), but the materials preserved in Ibn al-Faqîh show that the Arab scholars following this old tradition illed it with the realities known to them—so a mountain chain appears with the name of the Caucasus, running through the lands of the Khazars, the Alans and the Slavs. On the basis of this data it is hardly possible to claim that our author knew about a certain number of as-Saqâliba in the Caucasus (Togan, 325–326). here is an opinion that this single mountain chain seemed to the Arab authors to run up to the Carpathian mountains where there was a Slavic population (Lewicki, 287–288; Novoseltsev 1965, 383–384, note 164). On the whole, it is important to note the fact that the Oriental sources knew that the peoples al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba lived in territories close to one another. According to the Ibn Rusta (irst third of the tenth century) between as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar there were the Volga Bulġar people (BGA VII, 141). Moreover, Ibn Rusta considered the river Itil as the border zone between al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba (BGA VII, 141). According to Gardîzî (eleventh century) the Pechenegs (Bajânak) bordered with: from the South-West—the Khazars, from the West—the Slavs (Saqlâb); Itil, as with Ibn Rusta, was called a border between the territory of the Khazars and the land of the Slavs (Gardîzî, 37–38). hus, according to those authors who transmitted the information of the so-called “Anonymous Note on the Peoples of Eastern Europe” (Ibn Rusta, Gardîzî, Mutahhar ibn Tâhir al-Muqaddasî, al-Bakrî, al-Marvazî and others), the areas of the Khazars and the Slavs, though not neighbouring, were not far from one another; according to some data the border between them was the Itil (the medium part of the Volga). Mutahhar ibn Tâhir al-Muqaddasî (tenth century) transmitted unspeciic data on the location of the peoples of Eastern Europe, but cited some of his predecessors who mentioned that al-Khazar, ar-Rûs, as-Saqâliba, Wallaj (the Vlakhs ?), al-Lân, arRûm et al., lived close to the Turks (at-Turk). (El-Makdisi IV, 66). hose authors, who followed more or less the “Anonymous Note” transmitted, in the following sequence, tales about the peoples of Eastern Europe: the Pechenegs—the Khazars—the Burtâs—the Bulġars—the Magyars—the Slavs—the Rus’—the peoples of the North Caucasus. Al-Istakhrî and Ibn Hawqal (tenth century), in composing their books, relied on their own materials (perhaps, partly taken from alBalkhî’s book and maps). hey wrote that “to the west of the territorial holdings of Islam” lie the territories of Byzantium, of the Armenians,



ALKHAZAR and ASSAQÂLIBA: contacts. conflicts? 201
the Alans, Arran, Sarîr, the Khazars, the Rus’, the Bulġars, the Slavs and groups of the Turks (BGA I, 5; BGA II–2, 11). Shams ad-Din al-Muqaddasî (tenth century) mentioned that in the sixth “clime” there were situated the lands and towns of “Samarqand, Bardha a, Qabala, al-Khazar, al-Jîl (Gîlân), the outskirts of al-Andalus, which is closer to the North, and the outskirts of as-Saqâliba, which is closer to the South (BGA III, 61). In the thirteenth century al-Hasan al-Marrakushî mentioned together the lands of al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba; as lands about which various scholars had many contradictory data regarding their coordinates (Arabskije istochniki XII–XIII vekov, 163–164). hus, the Arab writers had a suiciently vivid picture of the territorial closeness of the Khazars and the Slavs. Besides geographical information there is rather well known data on the military conlicts in which the Khazars and the Slavs participated. First of all, there is the much studied data of the historians al-Balâdhuri (IXth century) and Ibn A‘tham al-Kûfî (tenth century) regarding the campaign of the Arab commander, Marwân ibn Muhammad against the Khazars in 119/737, in the course of which, going through Khazar territory, he captured a great number of as-Saqâliba (20 thousand families) “who were in the land of the Khazars”. He subsequently made an attempt to settle them at Khâkhit (Kakhetia), but they escaped and were killed in light. he Khazar khaqan was compelled to sue for peace on the condition that he accepted Islam (al-Beládsori, 207–208). Ibn A‘tham al-Kûfî gave more details writing that Marwân reached the lands “beyond the Khazar lands” and assaulted “the as-Saqâliba and other types of pagans, bordering them, and captured 20 thousand families”. hen he moved further and reached the “as-Saqâliba river,” ater which, having a great many al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba prisoners, he demanded that the Khazar khaqan make peace with the condition that he accepted Islam (Ibn A‘tham al-Kûfî, 49–50).
Scholars have diferent opinions on the route of the Arab commander. A. Garkavi supposed that there was only one reliable fact in the information about the events, namely that on the Khazar-Arab battleield, the Slavs were ighting on the side of the Khazars (Garkavi, 41–43). J. Marquart thought that the Arabs reached the Don where they clashed with those Slavs, who were under the power of the Khazars (Marquart, 198–199). V. Bartold mentioned in passing that Marwân ibn Muhammad “removed 20 thousand Slavs from the Khazar lands” (Bartоld, 870) without specifying the geographical area. A.Z. Validi Togan thought that the lands around the Volga were meant, and that the term as-Saqâliba



202 t.m. kalinina
both here and in other Arab sources refers to the Turkic and the Finnic peoples in the vicinity of the Volga (Togan, 298–307, 365–369). D. Dunlop used this idea, proving that Marwân moved along the right bank of the Volga, in pursuit of the Khazar khaqan and reached the land of the Burtâs, captured twenty thousand families of them and they were the ones whom the Arab sources called as-Saqâliba (Dunlop, 82–84). M. Artamonov (Artamonov, 219–220), S. Pletniova (Pletniova, 38–40), P. Golden (Golden I, 64), T. Noonan (Noonan, 191) had the same point of view. D. Ludwig had no deinite point of view on which exactly river is meant by “nahr as-Saqâliba ” noting that it might be the Volga or the Don or some other East European river (Ludwig, 102, 150–151, note 256). A. Novoseltsev expressed a viewpoint close to J. Marquart’s hypothesis, supposing that following the information of al-Balâdhurî and Ibn A‘tham al-Kûfî, Marwân reached the Don ater all, where he captured the polyethnic natives of the Don region including the Slavs; the Arab authors knew this ethnic name better than the others and therefore cited it alone. He correctly noted that the Arab sources never called the Burtâs as-Saqâliba. (Novoseltsev 1990, 185–187).
here is yet one more piece of information about this war—in Khalîfa ibn Khayyât’s (died 854/55) “History”. he author noting the names of his primary source and his informant, recounted that Marwân “set out in 114/732–33 and advanced until he crossed the river R.m.m; raiding, killing and capturing as-Saqâliba”. Under the year 119/737, he placed the information that “in that year Marwân ibn Muhammad undertook a long march from Arminiya. He penetrated Bab al-Lan, crossed the land of the Alans, then crossed into the land of the Khazars, went through Balandjar and Samandar and reached al-Baidâ where khaqan resided. he khaqan led the town” (Beilis 2000, 42). he data of the book of Khalifa ibn Khayyât are completely original, do not depend on the literary sources, therefore the information of this author can be interpreted to indicate that Marwân began to make attacks on the land of the Slavs much earlier than the campaign of 737 alone. It is important for the researchers to deine what river the Arab scholars could have called “the river of as-Saqâliba”. Unfortunately, it is impossible to deine the river R.m.m. mentioned by Khalifa ibn Khayyât and it is unlikely that it was that river which Marwân crossed in 732 when he attacked as-Saqâliba and in 737 when he was pursuing the Khazar khaqan. Ibn Khurradadhbeh was known to be the irst to mention the river running from the remote Slav lands and entering into the Caspian Sea, near the Khazar city of Khamlîj. As mentioned above, the

Arab sources, including Ibn A tham al-Kûfî, probably called “the river of as-Saqâliba” not some actual river, be it the Northern Donets, the Don (earlier the Tanais—called by the Arabs “Tanis”) or the Volga; rather, what was relected here was the general knowledge that the Arabs possessed about a river route from the remote lands of the Slavs to the Caspian Sea, including the northern rivers, the Don, the portages and the lower course of the Volga river—namely, the trade route which was long known to the Arabs (Kalinina 1986, 79–80). It is possible that Marwân had been in the regions along the Volga river, perhaps near the Stavropol highlands and the Ergeni mountains; where in the bend of the Volga, apparently, in this district which belonged to the Khazars, there were groups of as-Saqâliba and other peoples from whom the twenty thousand captives were taken by the Arabs (Kliashtornyi, 16–18). Now, D. Mishin and N. Garaeva also suppose, that Marwân went along the Volga but not the Don (Mishin, 42–43; Garaeva, 441–442). In this case, what is important for us is the fact itself of the close propinquity or even living together of as-Saqâliba and al-Khazar, it would appear, within the limits of of the Volga—Don zone. Al-Ya qûbî, in his “History,” related an episode under the year 240/ 854–55, when a people of Caucasus called as-Sanâriyya (the Tzanars) appealed for help from the rulers of ar-Rûm, al-Khazar and as-Saqâliba against the Arab governor-general in the Caucasus, Buga the Elder, and they gathered a large united force and without using arms forced the Caliphate the change its policy in the Caucasus. In this episode it is possible to see clearly the union of the two political forces headed apparently by Byzantium confronting the common enemy (Dunlop, 194). J. Marquart and then A. Novoseltsev did not exclude the possibility that the Tzanar’s appealed to the Prince of Kiev for help (Marquart, 200; Novoseltsev 1965, 372); V.M. Beilis also supposed that one of the East Slavic rulers might be meant (Beilis 1986, 141). In the oriental sources there is also information about direct contacts between representatives of the two peoples. Ibn Rusta and Gardîzî transmitted similar information that the Russes brought captured Slavs to the market in Khazaran—the Eastern part of the capital of Khazaria, the city of Itil (BGA VII, 45; Gardîzî, 39). Al-Istakhrî and Ibn Hawqal noted that slaves, among whom were Slavs and Khazars, were brought to Khwarizm for sale in the slave market (BGA I, 305; BGA II–2, 482). Al-Mas ûdî recounted directly that Slavs resided in Khazaria itself: that the Slavs and the Russes, who were in the Khazar land and its capital Itil cremated their dead; that the representatives of these peoples in the

Khazar capital had special judges who settled the disputes among them according to “pagan law and that is the law of reason”; that the Slavs and the Russes served in the troops of the Khazar rulers and could be the servants of the ruler (Maçoudi II, 11, 12, 64). Finally, according to Ibrâhîm ibn Ya qûb’s data (tenth century) preserved by al-Bakrî, the Khazars, the Russes, the Petchenegs, the Magyars and the Germans spoke Slavic since they mixed with the people of the Slavs (al-Bakri, 336). It is necessary to note that this information occupies entirely its own place in the general impression of the Arab authors regarding the Khazar language as either a Turkic language or as some other language that was quite diferent from the others (Novoseltsev, 1990, 85). Probably, Ibrâhîm ibn Ya‘qûb has given only his own personal impression gotten from representatives of peoples he encountered in the European towns visited by him and where the Khazars, the Russes, the Pechenegs and others employed the Slavic language as “lingua franca”. hus, the Oriental writers and travelers, being rather far from the territory where the two peoples’s meetings took place preserved, nevertheless, information about direct contacts between representatives of the two peoples: the Slavs, being either in the Khazar capital, in other Khazar districts or in rather distant lands, entered into military, political, commercial, every-day and cultural ties with the Khazar population; the literary, Biblical tradition preserved echoes of the co-existence of two peoples. One should note that the Arab-Persian medieval scholars entirely ignored the conlicts beween the two peoples, although the the Old Rus’ and Hebrew sources clearly testify to that. he Arabs knew and reported about the conlicts between Khazaria and representatives of the Old Rus’ state, calling the latter the ar-Rûs; but these were inter-state, not ethnic conlicts. he ethnic name as-Saqâliba is not identiied by the Arab writers with the name ar-Rûs, although the shared Eastern European area of habitation and the propinquity of the one to the other were known to them. It is just because of this that there is no special information about the conlicts between the Khazars and the Slavs in the Oriental sources.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE ECONOMY OF THE KHAZAR KHAGANATE
homas S. Noonan1
Introduction
In general, the study of the Khazar economy has been overshadowed by such controversial issues as the origins of the Khazars, their relations with neighboring states, the nature of kingship in Khazaria, and their conversion to Judaism. When the economy has been examined, scholars tend to focus upon Khazaria’s role as an intermediary in the great Vikingage trade of the Islamic world with northern Russia and the Baltic. Aside from several archaeological studies, relatively little attention has been paid to the internal economy of the khaganate itself. And, when the domestic economy is considered, the famous remark of Istakhrī is oten quoted: “he Khazar country produces nothing which can be exported to other lands except isinglass. As to the slaves, honey, wax, beaver and other skins, they are imported to Khazaria.”2 It is therefore no wonder then that even such an astute analyst as Douglas Dunlop could conclude his survey of the Khazar economy with such statements as “there were no large natural resources available for export, nor a steady supply of products of home industry. he Khazar economy in these circumstances appears as highly artiicial”3 and “the prosperity of Khazaria evidently depended less on the resources of the country than on its favorable position across important trade-routes.”4 his characterization of the Khazar economy as “highly artiicial” seems very incongruous since in the preceding pages Dunlop noted the rather extensive written evidence for pastoralism, agriculture, and crat production in Khazaria.5 Furthermore, he did not stress that other written sources contradict Istakhrī’s

assessment. he Hudūd al- Ālam, for example, speciically mentions the export of sheep from the Khazar country6 while Mas ūdī noted the many Muslim artisans who dwelt in Ītil.7 Finally, Dunlop did not utilize any archaeological evidence, evidence which demonstrates beyond any doubt that extensive agriculture and crat production were found throughout the khaganate. Consequently, Dunlop’s appraisal of the Khazar economy cannot be accepted. his study will attempt to demonstrate that the economy of Khazaria was far from artiicial. he term “economy of Khazaria” is employed rather than the more traditional “Khazar economy” in order to emphasize the fact that the economy of the khaganate encompassed the economies of all the dependent peoples and was not conined to just that of the dominant Khazars. According to Ibn Fadlān, the Khazar khagan has 25 wives, each of whom was the daughter of a neighboring king who was taken either voluntarily or by force.8 In other words, the khagan ruled over 25 distinct peoples. he Jewish traveler Eldad ha-Dani stated that there were 25 or 28 nations which were tributary to the Khazars.9 In his Reply, the Khazar Khagan Joseph claims that he collected tribute from numerous peoples. It is hard to calculate the exact number from Joseph’s account but there are a minimum of 38.10 Dunlop does not count those living along the shores of the Caspian nor the Pechenegs and he assumes the 9 peoples living along the Volga were 9 Khazar nations. He thus concludes that 28 tributary peoples are mentioned by Khagan Joseph.11 he exact number is less important than the fact that the Khazar khaganate encompassed a minimum of 25 diferent tributary peoples and perhaps as many as 40 or more. To understand the domestic economy of the Khazar khaganate it is necessary to examine the economies of the

tributary peoples who composed the khaganate. While it is impossible to identify and analyze the economy of each tributary nation, it is possible to examine the economies of the various regions of Khazaria. he domestic economy will thus be analyzed in terms of regions. his study will also attempt to demonstrate that the Khazar khaganate had a diversiied mixture of pastoralism, agriculture, foraging, and crat production. No single survival strategy dominated Khazaria. Rather, the strength and durability of the khaganate can be attributed to its diversiied economic base. Unlike those nomads who were dependent upon the food, goods, and luxury items coming from sedentary neighbors, the khaganate was remarkably self-suicient. It was this ability to provide for almost all of its essential requirements that enabled the Khazar khaganate to survive far longer than any other “nomadic” state in the south Russian-Ukrainian steppe. he traditional approach to Khazaria’s foreign trade might be called “static.” It attempts to create a composite picture of Khazaria’s international commerce based on the written sources. A careful scrutiny of this data produces a synthesis describing how this trade presumably functioned at one given time. While there is considerable value in such an approach, it fails to reveal the evolution of Khazaria’s international commerce. he role of Khazaria in the trade of the Islamic world with European Russian and the Baltic was constantly changing over the course of two centuries as was the volume of trade going through Ītil. he literary evidence fails to capture the dynamic nature of Khazaria’s foreign commerce. However, an analysis of the thousands of dirham hoards deposited throughout western Eurasia does provide important insights into the luctuations in the volume of trade going through the khaganate. In particular, it points to a fundamental transformation which took place in the international commerce of Khazaria ca. 900 and highlights one of the developments that led to the collapse of the khaganate ca. 965. In short, the numismatic data shows that Khazaria’s foreign trade was far from static; rather, it was subject to constant changes as well as a major reorientation ca. 900. In sum, the strength, endurance, and vitality of the Khazar khaganate rested on the twin pillars of a diversiied domestic economy and a lucrative foreign commerce. he former made the khaganate self-suicient in many key areas and thus less dependent upon neighbors who were potential enemies. he lucrative international trade provided immense income for the state. hese revenues were used, among other things, to reinforce the army through the employment of large numbers of Muslim



210 thomas s. noonan
auxiliaries from Khwārizm.12 his enlarged army, in turn, ensured the collection of tribute from the 25 or more dependent peoples and provided the security that made Khararia a safe place for merchants to do business. If the economy had been more specialized and less dynamic, Khazaria would not have endured as a major power in southeastern Europe for over two centuries. Originally, it had been my intention to examine the economy of all the diferent areas of Khazaria and to evaluate in some detail Khazaria’s role in the Viking-age trade of western Eurasia. However, it soon became evident that such a study would seriously transgress the limitations of space. Consequently, what follows is a discussion of several selected regions and an analysis of some key aspects of Khazaria’s foreign trade.
The Domestic Economy
he Capital of Ītil
he Khazar capital of Ītil located somewhere in the delta of the Volga was divided into two or three parts. he two main sections were the western part, called Khazarān, where the king, his entourage, and purebred Khazars lived and the eastern part, called Ītil, where most of the merchants, cratsmen, and foreigners resided.13 Among the residents of the eastern part could be found Jews, Christians, Muslims, and slaves of many nationalities. Khagan Joseph indicated that the dimensions of the western part were 3 3 farsakhs while those of the eastern part were 8 8 farsakhs.14 he two parts of Ītil relect the dual role of the capital. First of all, it was the political capital of the khaganate and the residence of the khagan, beg, and other Khazar oicials. Second, Ītil functioned as

Turks,” tr. and comm. A.P. Martinez, Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi, 2(1982), p. 154, speciically states that part of the 10,000–man Khazar army of was salaried.

Fadlān, Risālah, pp. 158–159, puts it very succinctly: “On one of the two sides [of the river] are the Muslims, while on the other side are the king and his companions.” 14 “he Reply of the Khagan Joseph,” pp. 84–85 (the Short Redaction), p. 102 (the Extended Redaction).



some observations on the economy 211
the great market of the khaganate where merchants from all over western Eurasia came to conduct business. hese two roles determined the economic proile of the city. he large concentration of Khazars oicials, foreign merchants, their servants, slaves and retinues, as well as the cratsmen who provided for their needs created a huge demand for food and supplies. Population igures for Ītil are hard to come by and suspect when available. One source states that there were 7,000 Muslim mercenaries in Khazar service, a large number of whom presumably resided in the capital.15 In addition, the Khazar army included Rūs, aqāliba, and pagan mercenaries, many of whom also lived in Ītil.16 It was also asserted that the khagan had 4,000 attendants and that more than 10,000 Muslims could be found in the capital.17 hese igures omit many other residents. Even if we discount the likely exaggeration in these numbers, there is no question that Ītil had a signiicant population of many thousands who had to be fed and provided for. In part, this demand was met by the ields, vineyards, and gardens of the khagan which were located within his part of the city.18 In terms of food and other basic items, the khagan and his oicials were partially self-suicient. However, the khagan’s ields within Khazarān clearly did not provide for the entire population of the capital. Consequently, a large agricultural area based on irrigation was created outside the city whose grains and vegetables provided a large and reliable source of food for Ītil. his “green belt” will be discussed in the next section. he infrastructure for Khazaria’s vast international trade was located in the eastern part of the capital. Here were found the customs’ oicials who collected the tithe that had to be paid by merchants who either frequented the markets of Ītil or passed by the capital while sailing on the Volga.19 Also located in the capital was the main commercial court that handled disputes among merchants. his tribunal consisted of seven judges (two for the Muslims, two for the (Jewish) Khazars, two for the

Christians, and one for the various pagans).20 Ibn Fadlān adds, however, that legal decisions concerning Muslim merchants who come to Ītil for trade are the provenance of a Muslim ghulām or special oicial of the Khazar rulers who acted as their sole judge.21 Here also were the dwellings of the many Muslim merchants and artisans who resided in the capital. hey had reportedly been attracted to Ītil by the justice and security that existed in Khazaria.22 he number of Muslim merchants, artisans, and mercenaries in the capital was so great that they had several mosques as well as religious schools.23 he warehouses of the foreign merchants appear to have been located in this part of the capital as well.24 For their services in providing a safe place for Muslim artisans, a protected environment in which Muslim merchants could trade, and employment for Muslim mercenaries, the Khazars collected taxes from the Muslims based on the amount of their wealth.25 he eastern part of the capital was thus the home for most of the merchants involved in Khazaria’s international trade, the location of the cratshops that serviced this trade, the place where the goods being bought and sold were stored, and the center for most other activities connected with this trade. he Khazar administration headquartered in Ītil collected considerable revenue in the form of tribute, tithes and taxes. According to Khagan Joseph, the Khazars collected tribute from all (25–40+) dependent peoples. Unfortunately, Joseph does not indicate what form this tribute took. he tributaries living in the forest steppe and forest zones apparently paid primarily in fur. he Volga Bulghārs, for example, were required to give the Khazars one sable skin per household.26 Similarly, the East Slavic tribes of the middle Dnepr and the upper Oka paid the khagan one squirrel pelt per hearth.27 However, if our source is to be trusted, this tribute in fur was later changed to a payment of one dirham per ploughshare.28 In other words, in those areas where the local peoples

could acquire suicient silver coins in return for their furs, the Khazars levied a monetary tribute. he Khazar tributaries who did not live in the forests where fur-bearing animals abounded undoubtedly paid in other goods which they possessed. Nomads such as the Pechenegs may have provided sheep, cattle, horses, hides, and wax to Ītil. At least, as we shall see, these were the goods that they traded with the Rus’ and the people of Cherson. he story/legend that the East Slavic tribe of the Kiev area gave one sword per hearth to the Khazars suggests that those peoples with developed crat production no doubt provided some of their manufactured goods to the Khazars as tribute.29 In any event, the many peoples subordinated to the Khazars paid what they could, but they did pay regularly. As Istakhrī noted, the Khazar ruler collected “regular payments assessed on the people of the diferent places and districts, consisting of every description of food, drink, etc. . . .”30 Tithes collected from merchants formed another major source of income. Istakhrī claimed that the treasury of the Khazar government depended on the customs’ dues and tithes collected along every land, river and sea route31 while the Hudūd al- Ālam indicated that “the wellbeing and wealth of the king of the Khazars are mostly from maritime customs.”32 he earliest report on Rūs trade with the Khazars notes that the Rūs merchants who visited the Khazar capital paid the khagan a tithe.33 he tithe was so ubiquitous that it was adopted by the tributary peoples themselves. he Volga Bulghārs, for example, collected a tithe on the goods brought to their realm by ships coming from Khazaria.34 Finally, the Khazar beg levied taxes on the inhabitants of the capital. he Muslim population, for instance, paid an annual tax based on its wealth.35 However, Istakhrī claims that the Khazar ruler had “no right to the property of his subjects,” which suggests that personal taxes may only have been collected from Muslims and presumably other non-Khazars who were non-residents/foreigners.36 In short, Ītil was the center of an extensive tax-collecting system that amassed vast sums of goods and

some coin as tribute, tithes, and taxes. It was this great revenue which paid for the large army that ensured that dependent peoples paid tribute annually, that routes and markets were safe for merchants, and that a prosperous Khazaria was protected from its many enemies.
he Lower Volga
As part of the western Eurasian steppe, the lower Volga region surrounding the capital might easily be dismissed as simply a land of pastures where sheep, horses, and other nomadic animals grazed. Maqdasī claimed that the Volga steppes in the neighborhood of Ītil were bare and dry without cattle or fruits.37 And, when William of Rubruck passed through the lower Volga in the mid-thirteenth century, he reported that the Mongol leader Buri, whose pasture lands were not good, once complained when drunk: “Why may I not go to the banks of the Etilia like Batu to feed my locks there?”38 Apparently Batu had taken the best grazing lands along the Volga and was so determined to keep them that he had Buri executed for his remarks. Contrary to what one might expect, however, the Khazar capital of Ītil was surrounded by an extensive agricultural region. According to the Khazar Khagan Joseph, the Khazar ruling elite normally spent the winter in Ītil and then, around April, let the capital in order to pass the time until late fall amongst their ields, meadows and vineyards that extended at least twenty farsakhs (ca. sixty miles?) into the countryside. Some of these ields were apparently passed down from generation to generation within the various clans suggesting that agriculture had long been practiced here.39 Istakhrī conirmed this report noting that the Khazars, who possessed extensive farms, go as far as twenty leagues from Ītil in the summer to work their ields. He added that the crops gathered along the river were brought to the capital by water while the crops collected in the steppe were transported by carts.40

some observations on the economy 215
Gardīzī mentioned the “many tilled ields and orchards of the Khazar country.”41 In short, there can be no doubt that a “green belt” consisting of ields, farms, gardens, vineyards and orchards extended for some 50 or 60 miles around the capital. he green belt surrounding Ītil was not necessarily naturally fertile. Khagan Joseph, for example, indicated that his country did not get much rain.42 he Khazar elite had turned the area around the capital into a rich and productive region with numerous ields, meadows, vineyards, gardens and parks through an extensive system of irrigation using water from the Volga system.43 Ītil was thus kept supplied with food grown by the Khazar elite on their garden farms surrounding the capital. Furthermore, the khagan’s residence in the capital was surrounded by his personal ields, vineyards, gardens and parks.44 he Khazar ruling elite, starting with the khagan, had ensured a reliable supply of grains, fruits45 and vegetables for themselves. As for apiculture, we have already noted the ot-cited comment of Istakhrī that “slaves, honey, wax, beaver and other skins” found in Khazaria were all imports.46 However, it is important to remember that Gardīzī speciically states that there is much honey and good wax in the Khazar country.47 Furthermore, the Hudūd al- Ālam makes particular mention of the Khazar slaves exported to the Islamic world which come from the country of the Khazarian Pechenegs.48 In sum, there are good reasons to question Istakhrī’s comments that little or nothing came from Khazaria and everything was imported from elsewhere. Good evidence exists that honey and wax were among the products of the Khazar lands, an area which included the region around the capital. In addition to the produce of their ields, the capital was also sustained by huge quantities of ish from the rivers of the Volga delta.

Joseph remarked that many ish grow in the numerous rivers of his country.49 According to Istakhrī, ish was one of the chief foods of the Khazars.50 he abundant ish of the lower Volga were commented on later by Rubruck.51 In addition, parts of the lower Volga were probably used as grazing lands. Maqdasī mentioned the numerous sheep of the Khazar country52 while another source noted the famous Khazar sheep that could give birth twice each year.53 hese accounts help to explain the report of sheep and cows exported from the Khazar country.54 Ītil thus had convenient access to supplies of ish, lamb and beef from the surrounding steppe. here were apparently grazing grounds for horses as well in the lower Volga. he Khazar army apparently consisted of 12,000 men55 of whom around 7,000 consisted of Muslim mercenary cavalrymen.56 he remaining 5,000 troops presumably included Khazar horsemen. A cavalry force this size required a regular and reliable supply of horses that was no doubt met, in large part, by horses raised in the lower Volga steppe. he sources tend to conirm this assumption. During Marwān’s 737 campaign along the lower Volga, the Arabs apparently destroyed large studs.57 Another source commented upon the unusually big Khazar horses.58 he region surrounding the capital was thus not entirely devoted to agriculture. Some of it was seemingly devoted to pastoral nomadism. However, it is good to keep in mind Zakhoder’s comments on the relative importance of pastoral nomadism and agriculture amongst the Khazars: “it would be a mistake to think that cattle raising [i.e., pastoralism] occupied a signiicant place in the description of Khazar life by our sources. he oriental sources concentrate in a more detailed way on agriculture.”59 he relatively greater attention given to agriculture no doubt relects its relative importance in the lower Volga.

he prominence of agriculture among the “nomadic” Khazars may help to explain the “ritual” nomadism of the Khazar khagans. he Khagan Joseph, ater noting that the Khazars went out of the capital to work their ields during the summer and fall, adds: “and from there we go around (our land) . . . not returning home till winter.”60 his comment is essentially repeated by several other Islamic sources. Marvazī, for example, states that the Khazars dwell in their cities during the winter “but with the approach of spring they go out into the deserts, where they spend all summer.”61 He adds that the Khazar “king” is accompanied by 10,000 horsemen wherever he goes.62 Gardīzī repeats the same story: in the spring the Khazars go out into the steppes and do not return to their towns until the winter.63 Gy. Györfy has provided an insightful analysis of this type of ritual nomadism. In the concise summary of Peter Golden, Györfy “has shown that nomadism in the river-rich steppelands of Eastern Europe difered from that of Central Asia. He notes of the ‘semi-nomadic’ Hungarians that they lived alongside the rivers where they had their winter quarters. Winters they spent ishing. In spring they went to nearby land where they planted their grain and then they drove their cattle into the steppes for pasturing. hey returned there for harvest time. hey had no ixed summer quarters and the distances travelled were not great. he upper class, however, travelled great distances parallel to the rivers between their winter and summer quarters. hus, it was only the upper class, the ruler and his retinue that nomadized over great distances. his system as Györfy points out, was true for the Hungarians, Khazars and Mongols.”64 he Hungarians may have adopted this form of semi-nomadism due to the limited amount of steppe land available in the Hungarian plain. he Khazars, however, adopted semi-nomadism for diferent reasons. To assure that the capital with its large population of Khazar elite, merchants from all over

western Eurasia, and diverse mercenaries had an adequate supply of food, it was necessary to create an irrigated green belt around Ītil. he vegetables, grains, and fruits obtained from this green belt were supplemented with the meat of sheep and cattle that were also grazed in the same area. Finally, the residents of the capital enjoyed the many ish found in the waters of the lower Volga while horses needed for the cavalry were grazed in the vicinity of the capital as well. Economically, the lower Volga was a multi-use region which provided for a number of the basic needs of Ītil.
he Volga-Dnepr Steppelands
Going west from the capital, one entered a vast steppe that extended as far as the lower Danube. However, the efective control of the khaganate only seems to have reached the lower Dnepr so we shall conine ourselves to this part of the steppe. his region was dominated by the nomadic Pechenegs in the ninth and tenth centuries and was thus home to an extensive pastoral economy.65 he Khagan Joseph, ater noting that the Pechenegs nomadize and live in the steppe, asserts that “they all serve (me) and pay me tribute.”66 However, the contemporaneous De Administrando Imperio by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus paints a very diferent picture. Here the Pechenegs are depicted as a group of eight independent tribes occupying the steppe between the Don and the Dnestr who served as Byzantine hirelings in ighting the Hungarians, Rus’ and other Byzantine enemies.67 Since Constantine was very well informed about the Pechenegs, it would seem that Joseph’s claim is an exaggeration. Islamic sources also report that the Khazars war on the Pechenegs each year and bring back booty and slaves from the Pecheneg lands.68 Joseph may well have been harkening back to an earlier time when the Khazars had defeated the Pechenegs.69 In any event, there were numerous horses and sheep in the Pecheneg lands70 and the Pechenegs sold horned cattle, horses, and sheep to the

Rus’71 as well as hides and wax to the people of Cherson.72 At the same time, the economy of the Pechenegs and related tribes was not based entirely on pastoralism. Mas ūdī, for example, noted that the four Turkic tribes living to the west of Khazaria, including the Pechenegs, were “both nomad and settled.”73 Unfortunately, he did not elaborate on their “settled” way of life. Presumably, it included some agriculture and perhaps modest crat production. However, well-developed pastoralism and, possibly, limited agriculture and crat production, did not fulill all of their material needs. As a result, the Pechenegs engaged in constant raids against their neighbors from which they collected numerous slaves as well as other booty (gold and silver vessels, weapons, silver belts).74 he Pechenegs, to the extent that they igured in the Khazar economy, were primarily nomads who had surplus animals and animal byproducts to sell. It is not certain, however, that the Khazars had a need for such products. It is not clear either whether the Pechenegs constituted a market for the agricultural produce and crat goods emanating from the khaganate. While the literary sources for this region are limited, there is an abundance of archaeological evidence on the Don steppe region in particular. Fortunately, this data on the economy of the Don during the Khazar era was systematically evaluated in the ine monograph of Mikheev.75 he indings of Mikheev were also incorporated into my earlier study of the Khazar economy.76 Consequently, this information does not have to be repeated here. However, it is important to stress that the diversiied economy of this area contained well developed agriculture, animal husbandry, ishing, hunting, and crat production.

Written sources provide relatively little information about the Khazarian Crimea. Byzantine sources conirm that in the eighth century the Khazars controlled a large part of the Crimea and even had substantial

inluence in the main Byzantine center of Kherson. However, there is little evidence about the Khazar position in the Crimea during the ninth and tenth century in these sources and some scholars believe that by the tenth century much of the Crimea had once again come under Byzantine rule. On the other hand, Khagan Joseph speciically lists a number of Crimean towns that were under Khazar rule at the time he was writing, i.e., ca. 950: K-r-ts (Bospor, Kerch), Sug-rai (Sugdeia/Sudak), Alus (Aluston, Lusta), L-m-b-t (Lambat = Greek Cape), B-r-t-nit (Partenit), Alubikha (Alupha), Kut (Kuti/Skuti), Man-t (Mangup), Bur-k (?), Alma (Alma), and G-ruzin (?).77 While many commentators suggest that Joseph’s information was out of date,78 others consider his statement as an accurate account of the Khazar domain in the Crimea during the mid-tenth century.79 In short, there is no agreement on the extent of the Khazar territories in the Crimea during the ninth and tenth centuries. It is not our intention here to enter into the controversy over the timeliness of Joseph’s information. he important point is that large parts of the Crimea came under Khazar control for several centuries between ca. 650 and ca. 950. Furthermore, while the written sources tell us virtually nothing about the economy of the Khazarian Crimea, there is abundant archaeological data that has been brought together recently in an excellent study by Baranov.80 Using this data, it is possible to reconstruct the economy of the Khazarian Crimea in considerable detail. At the start of the early middle ages, the Crimea was divided into two climatic/economic/cultural zones. In the Kerch peninsula and along the southern coasts and slopes of some of the river valleys dwelt a sedentary, agricultural population that possessed a provincial Byzantine culture formed from the synthesis of the local agrarian population (mainly Alan) and the Byzantinized towns, most notably Kherson. Most of the Crimea, however, consisted of a dry steppe area that extended westward across the northern and central parts of the peninsula to the high

argued (Vizantiiskii vremennik, 51(1990), p. 234) that the account of Khazar territory in the Crimea given by Khagan Joseph in the extended redaction of his letter described the situation in the second half of the ninth and early tenth century.
79 I.A. Baranov, Tavrika v epokhu rannego srednevekov’ia (saltovo-maiatskaia kul’tura) (Kiev: 1990), p. 54, states that Joseph’s description of the territory of the khaganate relects the historical reality of 954–961. He also argues, p. 152, that at the time Joseph wrote the Khazars ruled most of the Crimea.

plains of the Kerch peninsula and the mountains to the south. his zone was intensively utilized by nomads for grazing their herds. In fact, the Bulghār nomads of the Azov-Kuban region used the Crimean steppe as a seasonal pasturage for their herds. In the mid seventh century, when the Khazars defeated the Bulghārs, many of the latter found themselves stranded in the Crimean steppe with no home in the Kuban-Azov region to which they could return. Forced to adapt to an area which traditionally only supported a seasonal nomadic population, the Bulghār nomads found that there was not enough grazing land to support all of their locks year round. Consequently, starting in the second half of the seventh century, many of these nomads were forced to adopt a sedentary way of life in order to survive, a process that accelerated around the mid eighth century. his sedentarization of the Bulghār nomads was facilitated by the fact that during the mid eighth century much of the southern coastal areas and the Kerch peninsula had come under Khazar domination. he Bulghārs were thus able to settle down in many of the towns and villages of these regions.81 hese Bulghār/Khazar sites of the second-half of the seventh to tenth centuries formed one of the seven local variants of the Saltovo-Maiatskaia or Saltovo culture. his culture existed throughout much of the khaganate and is considered to be the most important archaeological manifestation of Khazaria. As was to be expected, the Saltovo sites from the Crimea are characterized by a greater degree of Byzantine inluence than that found in the non-Crimean variants due to this direct contact with the provincial Byzantine culture of the peninsula.82 he Saltovo settlements identiied in the Crimea can be divided into two chronological groups. Around 24 are dated to the period before ca. 750 while 85 date to the period from ca. 750 to the tenth century.83 Most of the earlier settlements were in the mountains and foothills of the central Crimea, the regions where most Bulghārs began to experience sedentarization he majority of those in the latter chronological group were located in the southern and eastern coastal areas, the northwestern Crimea, and in the vicinity of Kherson. By the late eighth and early ninth century, much of the Khazarian Crimea was thus populated by a relatively prosperous agrarian population of Bulghār background.

he economy of the Khazarian Crimea was quite complex with well developed agriculture, some viticulture, signiicant stock raising, and considerable crat production. Agriculture was clearly the leading branch of the Saltovo economy in the Crimea. he Kerch peninsula as well as the foothills and river valleys of the southern coastal mountains provided the environment in which reliable harvests were possible. he main grain crop was wheat with rye second in importance followed by barley and millet. Yields are hard to calculate, but Baranov has made some estimates. He believes that a village with approximately 25 families could produce 85,000 kg of surplus grain. Even if taxes or tribute took at least half of this amount, the surplus grain available to the village would amount to around 40,000 kg each year. While these igures are an educated guess at best, they do suggest that the Saltovo villages of the Crimea could produce the quantities of grain needed to feed larger towns such as Kherson whose population was probably in the neighborhood of 5,000 people at this time.84 As would be expected in an agricultural economy, the tools used in ploughing, harvesting, and grinding the grain were found in numerous Saltovo settlements. Iron ploughshares that were attached to wooden ploughs have been unearthed at several sites. he presence among them of heavy ploughs suggests the careful and frequent working of the soil. A number of Saltovo adzes/hoes used in ploughing were also unearthed in Crimean sites. Finally, millstones, grinders, and mortars for working the grain have been uncovered at a number of sites. In addition, workshops for the production of millstones have also been unearthed. Archaeologists believe that each Saltovo family ground its own grain.85 he evidence thus leaves no doubt that the sedentarized Bulghār population of the Crimea developed into relatively successful farmers during the Khazar era. Viticulture has existed in the Crimea since the ancient era and it is thus not surprising that vineyards could be found among the Saltovo villages of the Crimea. At Kordon-Oba, a knife used speciically in viticulture was found amongst a hoard of iron objects inside a blacksmith’s workshop. Further excavations at this settlement revealed a terraced area of around two hectares along the steep slopes of a hill on which

wild grape vines were noted along with materials of the eighth and ninth centuries. Along one of the upper terraces excavators uncovered small holes around 0.5 meters deep dug about 0.5 meters from one another. hese were the post holes from a Saltovo vineyard. It has been calculated that around 10,000 grape vines were growing here.86 Viticulture was deinitely a part of the Khazarian Crimean economy. he sedentarization of the Bulghār population of the Crimea meant that animal husbandry now assumed a secondary role in their economy. Traces of animal husbandry can be seen in the remains of enclosures for herds while the relative importance of diferent domestic animals was relected in the osteological materials. Enclosures were found atop mountains as well as in and around settlements. At one site, excavators unearthed the remains of a summer camp on a high plateau which was located less than two km from caves utilized as part of an enclosure for herds estimated to consist of around 110 sheep and goats along with 40 cattle. his summer camp belonged to a single Saltovo family which lived in a nearby settlement at the bottom of the mountain.87 he increased sedentarization in the period ater ca. 750 meant that greater osteological materials appeared at a number of Saltovo sites. he best data comes from Geroevka in the Kerch peninsula and is very revealing: cows—25%; horses—9%; sheep—20%; and, pigs—46%. he true import of these igures is only evident when they are compared with comparable data from Saltovo sites along the Don such as Dmitrovskoe. At the latter site, the corresponding percentages were as follows: cows—29%; horses—24%; sheep—27%; and, pigs—20%. here were over twice as many pigs and over two times less horses in the Crimea where life was clearly more sedentary. he former nomadic pastoralists had become skilled farmers who now raised large numbers of pigs but did not need as many horses to help them keep up with their herds.88 Based on the archaeological and ethnographic data, Baranov has attempted to project some production igures for Saltovo animal husbandry. He believes that the average Crimean Saltovo settlement of the Tau-Kipchak type could have supplied 9,000–10,000 kg of meat each year and give 9,000 liters of cow’s milk and 13,000 liters of sheep milk. If the inhabitants consumed 700–800 kg of meat annually, they would

224 thomas s. noonan
have had a surplus of about 9,000 kg of meat per year. In sum, Baranov estimates that the Saltovo settlements of the Crimea could have supplied the Byzantine markets of the Crimea with about 300,000 kg of meat annually during the period from ca. 650 to ca. 750 and with around 900,000 kg of meat each year starting in the second half of the eighth century.89 While some of the igures may seem speculative, the conclusion is unavoidable. Even ater taxes, the Saltovo agriculturalists of the Crimea had signiicant quantities of surplus meat that could be sold outside their communities. Hunting and ishing also played a part in the Saltovo economy. he bones of wild animals such as deer have been found at a number of settlements. Fish hooks and weights for ish nets along with numerous ish bones have been unearthed at these same sites. Unfortunately, there is still insuicient data to make any quantitative projections about their signiicance in the overall economy.90 Crat production, both domestic and that done in specialized workshops, was well developed in the Khazarian Crimea. Spindle whorls of various types and inds of coarse wool cloth bear witness to widespread spinning and weaving using local wool. In addition, the Saltovo farmers needed a variety of tools and iron products. hanks to an abundance of local iron ores, almost every Saltovo village had a smithy. At KordonOba, a two-room workshop was found including a smithy’s tools, an anvil, and half-inished products. In settlements of the period ca. 650ca. 750, local smithies supplied the basic needs of an agrarian population with such goods as sickles, knives, arrowheads, and spearheads. he assortment of goods made by local smithies in the period ater ca. 750 was much greater. Byzantine inluence also grew at this time due to growing imports as well as the impact of the provincial Byzantine crat tradition.91 Besides ferrous metallurgy, a variety of tools and jewelry were made from copper and bronze. It is believed that copper and bronze bars were imported into the Crimea and that the goods were produced from them in the local blacksmith’s workshop. Many molds into which the molten metal was poured have been found and point to the massive production of inexpensive jewelry in Saltovo workshops. Some of this jewelry was

of high quality indicating that it was probably sold to the local provincial Byzantine population. Besides casting, the Saltovo cratsmen of the Crimea utilized stamping, engraving, gilding, granulation, and iligree to make their jewelry. Local Saltovo artisans were thus able to meet the demands of their neighbors for both necessary goods as well as some luxuries. Pottery was one of the most developed and widespread crats among the Saltovo population. Local potters produced large quantities and varieties of table ware, kitchen ware, and amphoras as well as other larger vessels used for carrying and storing. he earliest Saltovo kitchen pottery was primarily hand-made and several varieties were apparently brought to the Crimea by the Bulghārs. By ca. 700, however, wheel-made kitchen pottery already composed one-half of all pots and thereater it entirely replaced hand-made kitchen pottery. Wheel-made Saltovo kitchen pottery showed strong provincial Byzantine inluence. Much of the wheel made pottery was ired in two-layered vertical kilns of Byzantine origin that provided high baking temperatures. In addition, certain variants of the wheel-made kitchen pottery were apparently made by Greek artisans for the Saltovo market. Table ware, which consisted primarily of pots, was less prevalent in the Saltovo sites of the Crimea than in the Saltovo settlements of the Don and Azov regions. Locally made Saltovo pots composed only 5% of all the pottery while Byzantine oinochoes alone composed around 16%–20% of all the pottery in the Crimean sites. Evidently the workshops in the nearby Byzantine centers could produce better and cheaper table ware. he spread of the potter’s wheel and the two-layer baking kiln marked the transition of pottery from a domestic crat supplying family needs to a specialized artisans’ crat meeting the demands of the market. his transition was marked by the appearance of potters’ marks on the bottom of wheel-made and polished table ware. Since most of the marks have no parallels outside the Crimea, they point to the local production of most kitchen and table ware in Saltovo settlements. In fact, special pottery workshops probably existed in each Saltovo village or group of villages in the Crimea.92 Amphoras and other vessels used to transport and store wine and oil formed a signiicant percentage of the pottery found in the Saltovo

sites of the Crimea. Amphoras alone, for example, amounted to 31% of all the pottery found at Tau-Kipchak while at Kordon-Oba they were 27%.93 Furthermore, a great variety of amphoras were found at these sites. At Tau-Kipchak, for instance, twenty amphora shards belonging to at least eight diferent types were found in just two pits.94 While some of the amphoras found in these Saltovo settlements and cemeteries were imported from abroad, especially Byzantium, or made in the Byzantine towns of the Crimea, the Khazarian regions of the Crimea produced large quantities of amphoras and related vessels. Pottery workshops where amphoras and similar vessels were produced during the eighthtenth centuries have been at some ten sites in the Crimea.95 Some of these sites belong to the Byzantine areas of the Crimea, e.g., Kherson. However, several major centers for the manufacture of amphoras have been unearthed in regions that were under Khazar domination. For example, at Chaban-Kule near Sudak the workshop contained at least 20 kilns of which four were excavated while at Kanakskaia balka, ten km further west, the workshop consisted of ive kilns of which three had been excavated.96 hese workshops were located away from the settlements near rivers and sources of clay and were operated primarily during the summer by groups of potters. It is estimated that one such kiln could turn out up to 1000 amphoras and between 400–600 smaller vessels during the course of one season.97 In other words, if 15 of the kilns at Chaban-Kule were in operation, around 15,000 amphoras and 6,000 to 9,000 smaller vessels could be made each year. Amphoras and other large vessels were unquestionably a major product of the Khazarian Crimea. We shall return to these amphoras when we consider the wine and oil trade of the khaganate. he economy of the Khazarian Crimea experienced signiicant evolution and development over the course of several centuries. Starting from their seasonal use of steppe pasturage prior to the mid seventh century, the Bulghār nomads marooned here as the result of the Khazar conquest of the Azov-Kuban area underwent a process of sedentarization in

order to survive. During the initial stage (ca. 650–ca. 750), they began to settle down in villages in the foothills bordering the central Crimean steppe where they gradually learned how to farm the land, raise animals in nearby pastures, and make the tools and implements they needed. Slowly, these sedentarized Bulghārs developed trade ties with the Byzantine towns such as Kherson. hese towns provided good markets for the surplus grains and animals that the new agriculturalists produced and they supplied the Saltovo peoples with wine, oil, good-quality pottery, and other goods. A new period began around the mid seventh century and lasted till the tenth century. During this period, the Saltovo population moved to the towns and villages of the southern coastal region and the Kerch peninsula. Here they developed a very prosperous agriculture and animal husbandry along with viticulture. Large quantities of grain and meat were sent to the Byzantine towns as well as to the towns that came under Khazar domination. At the same time, imports grew. A reasonably prosperous agricultural population demanded more crat goods, including luxuries such as jewelry, and crat production, stimulated by Byzantine inluences, expanded rapidly in the Khazarian Crimea. Home production to meet the needs of family units gave way to large-scale production for the market. his highly diversiied and lourishing economy was destroyed in the tenth century although the circumstances and exact time are still a matter of discussion.
he Burtās Land
Islamic sources agree that north of the Khazar homeland, at a distance said to have been 15 days’ journey, lay the lands of the Bur ās who are said to have been a Turkic tribe.98 he Bur ās land appears to have been located in the forest steppe which accounts for its very diverse economy. he region between the Bur ās and the Khazars was all inhabited/cultivated steppe land suggesting the presence of agriculture here.99 One source speciically states that in the region between the Khazars country and the Volga Bulghār lands are found an “uninterrupted succession” of settlements belonging to sedentary Turkic tribes which form part of the Khazar kingdom.100 he Bur ās were unquestionably one of

228 thomas s. noonan
these tribes. In the steppe parts of the Bur ās land per se could be found many cultivated ields while animal husbandry also received special notice (“they have swine and oxen”).101 hese ields apparently produced grains and vegetables since it is speciically noted that the Bur ās did not grow fruits.102 It was presumably these Bur ās farmers who lived in the houses of wood mentioned by Istakhrī.103 he pastoral sector was also signiicant and our sources record that some Bur ās dwell in felt tents.104 Horse breeding must have been extensive since the Bur ās provided 10,000 horsemen to the Khazar army.105 Our sources also note the presence of numerous camels.106 At the same time, the Bur ās forests were very fruitful. Apiculture was well developed so that the Bur ās produced large quantities of honey as well as good wax.107 Numerous animals were trapped in their woods. Many Burtās apparently wore coats made of weasel pelts which seem to have been especially prevalent.108 he pelts of black and red foxes known as burtāsī were particularly well known and widely desired. It was said that one black burtāsī was valued at 100 dīnārs or more while the red burtāsī sold for less. Islamic rulers had a special liking for the black burtāsī which they prized more than sables or martens. Apparently, a hat, catan, or coat made of black burtāsī was an important status symbol among such potentates.109 Merchants seeking these burtāsī pelts and other goods travelled from Ītil to the Bur ās land either by boat along the Volga or by land.110 In sum, the Bur ās land is a good example of the diversiied economy found in many of the regions of Khazaria. Agriculture was highly developed and any “surplus” was no doubt sent downstream to Ītil. At the same time, honey, wax, and especially fur from the forests were in great demand while a pastoral sector also existed. he only area of the economy about which we know little is crat production.

can be resolved once we can determine which archaeological culture should be connected with the Burtās.
International Commerce
he Literary Sources
he written sources leave no doubt that Ītil was a major center for international commerce where merchants from the Rus’ lands, the Near East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Byzantium all gathered to exchange their goods. Many of these merchants only stopped temporarily at Ītil to conduct their business and then continued on to other destinations. During the ninth century, the Rūs, for example, passed through Ītil on their way to Jurjān and even Baghdad.111 Similarly, the Rādānīya journeyed from Byzantium to the Khazar capital on their way to Jurjān, Balkh and Transoxiana.112 Other merchants, however, had their headquarters in Ītil from where they took part in the commerce of the capital and conducted an extensive trade with other regions of western Eurasia. Ibn awqal, for example, has an interesting account of a merchant who lived in the western part of the capital (Khazarān) and sent his son, also an experienced merchant, to Inner Bulgharia (Danubian Bulgharia?) on business. Sometime later, the father died ater having adopted one of his slaves and trained him in the business. When the birth son abroad sent back to his father asking for supplies, the adopted son kept what was sent without dispatching the requested goods. he natural son, still unaware of his father’s death, again asked that the supplies be sent. he adopted son now summoned the natural son home for an accounting in order to obtain all of his adopted father’s property. he conlict eventually ended up in court where the king himself had to settle the dispute.113 While most attention is given to transient foreign merchants, especially those from Rus’ and the Islamic world, this story emphasizes the great importance of native Khazar merchants living in the capital. hese merchants enjoyed such status that they resided in the western part of the

town along with the Khazar elite and, when their afairs ended up in court, the king himself became involved. he story does not indicate the religion of this family. It may well have been Jewish114 although we can not rule out the possibility that they were Muslims.115 he inluential Khazar merchant families of the capital had far-lung business interests and their local “oices” were managed by junior members of the family. he goods handled by these merchant families were apparently stored in the capital. When supplies ran low in the local branches, the resident managers sent the payment and presumably part of their proits back to Ītil from whence new goods were dispatched to the local branches. In short, Khazar merchants based in Ītil were active participants in the international commerce of the khaganate. Various sources document the activities of Khazar merchants throughout western Eurasia. Muslim merchants based in Khazaria and the northern Caucasus travelled to the lands of the Pechenegs and neighboring Turkic peoples in the Don-Dnepr steppe.116 his commerce was particularly challenging since it was supposedly quite easy for merchants to get lost on the roads leading to the Pecheneg lands. Merchants heading there from Khazaria were advised to purchase horses and camels.117 Mas ūdī mentions Muslim merchants who were apparently active on the northern frontiers of Byzantium.118 A twelth-century source even notes meeting with Khazar merchants in Constantinople and Alexandria.119 Finally, the Khazars conducted a lively barter trade with the Volga Bulghārs in order to obtain sable/marten, ermine and squirrel pelts.120 Khazar boats regularly ventured upstream from Ītil121 and these vessels coming from the Khazar lands went as far north as Volga Bulghāria.122 he Khazar boats sailing up the Volga from Khazaria were undoubtedly in the employ of Khazar merchants both Jewish and Muslim. Finally, we should note the merchant ships that plied the

Caspian123 as well as the Khazar ships that tried to enter the harbor at Darband.124 hese reports indicate that Khazar merchants were active on the Caspian. In sum, Khazar merchants were active by land traversing the steppe and by water venturing into the interior of European Russia as well as into the Caspian. It is a serious mistake to believe that the Khazars were simply passive onlookers who did nothing but collect a tithe from foreign merchants in the capital in return for providing them with a secure place to do business. Khazar merchants played an active role in the international trade that passed through the khaganate and were busy throughout western Eurasia sometimes as local agents for family businesses centered in Ītil. he transcontinental commerce of the khaganate revolved around three main products: the furs and slaves desired in the Islamic world and the silver dirhams that were so eagerly sought in European Russia and the Baltic. he demand for slaves and furs is probably self-explanatory. Furs provided both warmth and status to the Islamic elite. As noted above, black and red fox pelts known as burtāsī were highly valued by Islamic rulers who paid as much as 100 dīnārs apiece for the black burtāsī. hese pelts were more desired than those of sables or martens and were used for hats, catans, and coats.125 Since the Burtās lands lay due north of Khazaria and the Burtās were Khazar tributaries, there can be no question that Khazaria occupied a key position in this part of the fur trade. here was great demand for fur throughout the Islamic world. Most of the Bur ās furs coming from Khazaria as well as those acquired by Khazar merchants in Volga Bulghāria were no doubt shipped to such Near Eastern markets as Baghdad, al-Mu ammadiyyah, etc. he many goods from Khazaria which reached the Abbāsid capital, were speciically noted by one source.126 Fur was unquestionably among this merchandise. At the same time, there was also a great demand for the furs of European Russia in Central Asia. Al-Maqdisī, for example, singles out sable, miniver, ermine, fox, marten, and beaver among the numerous furs exported to Khwārizm from Volga Bulghāria.127 Given this desire for fur throughout the Islamic world, it is understandable why

two major export routes existed. he earliest route led through Khazaria to the Near East while the later route went from Volga Bulghāria across the steppe to Khwārizm. hese two routes will be discussed in greater detail when we come to silver dirhams. he Khazar khaganate played a key role in the transcontinental slave trade of the Viking age. Slaves were sought as household servants, ield workers, military recruits, and a variety of other purposes. While the slave trade is oten thought of in terms of the export of slaves from Khazaria to the Islamic world and Byzantium, it should not be forgotten that the khaganate itself and its capital of Ītil in particular constituted large markets for slaves. If Istakhrī is to be believed, the slaves found among the Khazars were all pagans since the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions disapproved of the enslavement of a fellow believer.128 However, there was unquestionably a great demand for slaves among the neighbors of khaganate and the Khazars did their best to accommodate this demand. here is little evidence on the Khazar slave trade of the ninth century. Our best source for the trade of this period does not mention slaves among the goods that Rus’ merchants brought to Khazaria.129 In the tenth century, Rūs merchants supplied large numbers of slaves to the Volga Bulghār markets on the middle Volga.130 It appears that most of these slaves were destined for the markets of Central Asia.131 Most of the slaves exported to the Islamic world via the khaganate were apparently gathered in the southern parts of European Russia where the capture of prisoners destined for slave markets was widespread. he Khazars raided the Pecheneg lands each year in search of booty and slaves and they also invaded the Ghuzz and Bur ās lands less frequently for their same purpose.132 One report even states that the “Khazar slaves brought to the Islamic lands are mostly from” the country of the Khazarian Pechenegs.133 he Hungarians also furnished the Khazars with Saqlāb slaves who had been captured in war and then

transported to the port of Kerch.134 While our source (Ibn Rusta) states that Kerch was a port in Byzantine territory, it had long been ruled by the Khazars and was included by Khagan Joseph among the Crimean towns still paying tribute to the Khazars ca. 950.135 While Ītil was the main Khazar center for the slave trade going via the Caspian and Caucasus, Kerch was apparently the chief port for the Khazar slave trade in the Black Sea. At the same time, the Khazars were endangered by other peoples seeking potential slaves. he Pechenegs, for example, raided the lands of their neighbors and sold their captives as slaves.136 In general, one gets the distinct impression that every people in this part of western Eurasia raided its neighbors in search of slaves.
he Numismatic Evidence
While the written sources reveal a great deal about the transnational trade of the khaganate, they do not provide evidence for its origin, evolution, and decline. he thousands of Islamic silver coins or dirhams deposited throughout western Eurasia constitute our best source for the analysis of these key issues. Since these hoards can be dated by their most recent dirham, we know approximately when they were buried. Despite the fact that silver coins had been struck by Islamic rulers since the earliest days of the Umayyad caliphate, almost none of these coins reached Khazaria at that time. he long hundred-years’ war between Khazaria and the Umayyads (ca. 650–ca. 750) made any signiicant commerce between the two states very diicult if not impossible. he situation changed, however, with the emergence of the Abbāsid caliphate. he caliphs in Baghdad had too many problems in too many parts of their vast empire to pursue the war with the Khazars. Consequently, starting in the 760s, the caliphs sought a rapprochement with the khagan, a strategy that slowly but surely succeeded despite some initial diiculties. herefore, it was only during the last quarter of the eighth century that signiicant trade between the caliphate and the khaganate became possible. It is thus no surprise that the irst hoards of Islamic dirhams only

appeared in the Caucasus, European Russia, and the Baltic at this time. Islamic commerce with Khazaria and the north thus dates to the period from ca. 775 to ca. 800.137 he great Islamic commerce with European Russia and the Baltic that began ca. 775 continued until ca. 1025 and underwent numerous changes. For our purposes here, it is pertinent to note that during the irst phase of this trade, ca. 775–ca. 900, Khazaria functioned as the key intermediary between the Islamic world and European Russia. he chief routes for this commerce ran from Iran and Iraq via the Caspian and Caucasus through the khaganate and then proceeded into the interior of European Russia mainly by the Don-Donets basin. However, during most of the tenth century, Khazaria assumed a secondary position as the main route for the export of dirhams to the north ran from Khwārizm to Volga Bulghāria and from there went by the upper Volga and other north Russian rivers to various parts of European Russia.138 In other words, the great Viking-age trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe can be divided into two distinct periods and Khazaria played a very diferent role in each. Contrary to what our written sources suggest, this commerce experienced great luctuations over the course of time and was hardly static. here are no literary sources indicating the changes in the volume of Viking-age trade with the Islamic world over the course of some two and one-half centuries, i.e., from ca. 775 to ca. 1025. However, an approximate date for the burial of a dirham hoard can be obtained from the hoard’s most recent dirham. It is thus possible to determine how many dirhams were in the hoards deposited during any time period. he number of dirhams deposited in European Russia and the Baltic during any given period is not necessarily a function of the number of new dirhams imported from the Islamic world during that period. Some dirhams remained in circulation for a century or more while others were

deposited very soon ater being struck. Nevertheless, the number of dirhams deposited during a given period does depend in large part upon the quantity of imports during that period. he number of dirhams that were buried increased when growing imports made more dirhams available and declined when imports decreased. he number of dirhams in the hoards deposited at any given time is not a perfect indicator of the volume of dirham imports. But, given the absence of written sources containing precise data, it is the best indicator we have. A comparatively large number of dirhams being deposited relects a growing trade while a declining number points to a decrease in the volume of dirham imports. Around 22% of the dirhams deposited in European Russia come from hoards deposited in the eighth and ninth centuries while 78% originate from hoards buried in the tenth and early eleventh centuries.139 Since almost all the dirhams deposited in the Baltic lands came via European Russia, these coins must also be considered. he comparable igures from the Baltic are 16% for the eighth and ninth centuries and 84% for the tenth and early eleventh centuries.140 In other words, around 20% of the dirhams imported into northern Europe were deposited at the time (ca. 775–ca. 900) when Khazaria was the key intermediary in the commerce between the Islamic world and the north while some 80% were deposited in the tenth and eleventh centuries when Volga Bulghāria was the primary intermediary and Khazaria only played a secondary role. he Volga Bulghār trade, if we may use this term, was four times greater than the Khazar trade. It is crucial to keep this fact in mind. While the written sources do not ignore the Bulghār trade, they fail to bring out the fact that the tenth-century Bulghār trade was so much greater than the ninth-century Khazar trade. Khazaria’s role in the tenth-century trade was, in fact, rather insigniicant. In a study which I am now preparing, I calculated the percentage of Sāmānid/Central Asian and Abbāsid/Near Eastern dirhams in various hoards from European Russia and Sweden deposited between ca. 925–ca. 950 and ca. 936–ca. 945 respectively.141 In the hoards from

European Russia, the Sāmānid/Central Asian dirhams which were exported north via Volga Bulghāria constituted between 75%–100% of the coins in the typical hoard. By way of contrast, Abbāsid/Near Eastern dirhams being exported north via Khazaria amounted to less than ive percent of the normal hoard and were not present in a number of the hoards. Similarly, in the Swedish hoards, Sāmānid/Central Asian dirhams formed 80%–90% of the dirham in an average hoard while the Abbāsid/Near Eastern dirhams only comprised 5%-10% of the coins. While the export of dirhams from the Near East to northern Europe via the khaganate continued during the tenth century, it only amounted to about one-tenth of the total Islamic trade with northern Europe. Furthermore, many dirhams were sent north from the Near East ater the collapse of the khaganate.142 During the period up to 965, the true Khazar share was thus around ive percent of the total trade. Ninety percent of this trade, on average, originated in Central Asia and reached northern Europe via Volga Bulghāria. Some years ago, in a study that some found controversial, I estimated that around 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 whole dirhams were exported to the Baltic from European Russia.143 About the same number of dirhams were probably deposited in European Russia. In other words, the trade of northern Europe with the Islamic world resulted in the export of some 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 whole dirhams into European Russia and the Baltic. Some 20% or 20,000,000 to 40,000,000 of these dirhams can be attributed to the ninth-century Khazar trade while 80% or 80,000,000 to 160,000,000 of these dirhams can be associated with the tenth-century Bulghār commerce.

Near Eastern commerce. his 10% amounted to 8,000,000 to 16,000,000 whole dirhams of which 4,000,000 to 8,000,000 can be attributed to the period 900–965. In other words, during the ninth century, 20,000,000 to 40,000,000 whole dirhams passed through Khazaria as part of the Islamic trade with northern Europe while the igures for the tenth century were 4,000,000 to 8,000,000. Tenth-century dirham imports through Khazaria were only about one-ith of what they had been in the ninth century but they were still substantial. Nevertheless, the khagan’s revenues had declined sharply. he 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 whole dirhams he obtained during the ninth century from his tithe on goods passing through the khaganate dropped to 400,000 to 800,000 during the tenth century. While the above calculations are unquestionably speculative and further reinements are necessary, they do provide, for the irst time, a fairly concrete idea of what the change from the Khazar route to the Volga Bulghār route meant for the khaganate. he decline of four-iths in the volume of the Islamic trade passing through Khazaria unquestionably had a major impact upon the economy of the khaganate. In particular, the great reorientation in the Islamic commerce ca. 900 dramatically altered the relationship between the Khazars and the Volga Bulghārs. Written sources do not tell us when the Khazars extended their domination over the Volga Bulghārs, but it is clear that by 922 Khazar authority over the Volga Bulghārs was irmly established. In that year, the Bulghār ruler made frequent complaints to Ibn Fadlān regarding the Khazars “who have enslaved me.”144 It thus seems probable that the expansion of Khazar power northward to the Bulghār lands of the middle Volga was inspired, in large part, by the great shit in the trade route leading north from the Islamic world, a shit which placed the Bulghārs at the center of the highly proitable trade of Central Asia with northern Russia. he Khazars apparently attempted to compensate for the precipitous decline in their revenues from the Islamic trade by taking a share of the growing wealth being amassed from this commerce by the Volga Bulghārs. Despite the numerous complaints of the Bulghār ruler about Khazar “enslavement,” the written sources suggest that the Khazar yoke was much less severe than we might believe. On the one hand, the Bulghār ruler paid the khagan a tribute of one sable skin per household.145 his

no doubt amounted to a very substantial quantity of fur. Gardīzī’s igure of 500,000 Bulghār households146 is no doubt an exaggeration. But, even if the correct igure were only one-tenth of that, 50,000 sable pelts were worth around 100,000–125,000 dirhams at the prevailing price in Volga Bulghāria.147 he khagan unquestionably realized a good income from his Bulghār tribute. On the other hand, the Bulghār ruler collected the very same tribute of one sable per household from his people.148 he Khazar overlords did not receive more tribute than their Bulghār vassals. Furthermore, the Bulghār ruler collected a tithe from the ships of both Khazar and Rūs merchants who came to his market.149 Khazar merchants were thus treated on a par with the Rūs merchants and received no special preference. Finally, there is no indication that the khagan received a share of the huge proits made by the Bulghārs from their trade with Central Asian merchants. he khagan obtained a nice tribute in fur which had great political symbolism and real economic value but that was all. A tribute worth at least 100,000 dirhams per year hardly compensated for the fact that as a result of the shit in the main trade route from the Islamic world, some 72,000,000 to 144,000,000 whole dirhams were now exported to northern Europe through the Volga Bulghār lands. If the imports amounted to around 100,000,000 coins then the Bulghār ruler’s tithe would equal about 10,000,000 dirhams, a sum equal to one hundred years of the Bulghār tribute to the khagan. he political power of the khaganate was slowly but surely eroded during the course of the tenth century by the tremendous loss of income that arose from the diversion of the Islamic trade from the Caspian-Caucasus route through Khazaria to the Central Asian route that led through Volga Bulghāria. In her recent study of the Saltovo culture, S.A. Pletneva noted that the chronological boundaries of the Saltovo culture coincided with the period of the lourishing of the khaganate, i.e., from the late eighth century until the early tenth century.150 What Pletneva did not ask is
146 Gardīzī, “Two Chapters,” p. 157. 147 Gardīzī, “Two Chapters,” pp. 158–159, says that the Volga Bulghārs paid two and one half dirhams for an ermine pelt.

some observations on the economy 239
why the khaganate reached its zenith at this time. It is not a mere coincidence that the khaganate and the Saltovo culture prospered during the very time when the main trade route connecting the Islamic world with northern Europe led through Khazaria. he economy of the khaganate experienced a long period of growth precisely because Khazaria dominated the Islamic trade with the north and derived great revenues from it. he wealth coming from this commerce allowed the khaganate to hire large numbers of Islamic mercenaries from Khwārizm (the alLārisiya).151 With this additional force, the Khazars were able to impose their control over many neighboring peoples and force them to pay tribute as well as furnish troops.152 he revenues coming from the Islamic trade with northern Europe thus formed the foundation for the expansion of Khazar power into such areas as the middle Volga, the Oka basin, and the middle Dnepr. he reports, discussed above, of the numerous dependent peoples in the khaganate relect this period of growing political power based on the revenues from the Islamic trade. Even before the shit to the Central Asian route, problems had begun to develop in the Islamic trade of Khazaria. During the period from ca. 850 to ca. 875, the Islamic trade with the north boomed and numerous new Near Eastern dirhams were deposited in northern Europe soon ater their striking. However, very few new dirhams struck in the Near East between ca. 875 and ca. 900 reached European Russia and the Baltic during this time.153 he volume of trade as measured by the import of new dirhams dropped precipitously. he Near Eastern mints were still supplying large numbers of dirhams at this time, the great demand for these coins still existed in northern Europe, and the khagan would still proit from the export of dirhams to the north. he most likely explanation is that there was some disruption in the trade routes leading through the khaganate. he Pechenegs, Magyars and/or some other group now made it impossible for Rūs and Islamic merchants to meet and exchange their goods as they had done for the past century. It was apparently in response to this crisis that the new route from the Sāmānid lands in

240 thomas s. noonan
Central Asia through Volga Bulghāria was developed. Or, to put it more correctly, the old caravan route across the steppes from Central Asia to the middle Volga experienced a renaissance due to the diiculties in the Caspian-Caucasus route. In short, the khaganate already began to experience a loss of revenue in connection with the Islamic trade starting around ca. 875 and this process became even more pronounced beginning around ca. 900 when the new Central Asian route circumventing the Khazar homeland began to function. It is no wonder that starting in the late ninth century Khazaria had to contend with a continuing series of wars and revolts inspired by its enemies. According to the Schechter Text/Cambridge Document, the Khagan Benjamin (ca. 880–900) had to wage war against a coalition of ive peoples whose members, according to Pritsak, consisted of Byzantium, the Pechenegs, the Black Bulgars, the Torks/Ghuzz, and the Bur ās. Khazaria triumphed against this coalition thanks to the assistance of the Alans.154 During the reign of Khagan Aaron (ca. 900–920), alliances shited and the Alans, inspired by Byzantium, fought with the Khazars who now employed Tork mercenaries to help them defeat the Alans. Finally, during the reign of Khagan Joseph (ca. 920–960), Byzantium bribed the Rus’ to attack the Khazar town of Tamartakha (ca. 925). he Rus’ were repulsed and forced by the Khazars to raid Byzantine territories in the Crimea.155 It is thus quite evident that Byzantium sensed problems in Khazaria starting in the late ninth century and launched a series of wars against the khaganate. We can also conclude that these problems stemmed, in large part, from the disruption of the old Near Eastern trade route and the emergence of the new Central Asian route. Byzantium was very quick to exploit the signiicant loss of revenue produced by these changes and their negative impact on the Khazar economy.
Inter-Regional Commerce
Most accounts of the commerce of the khaganate focus upon its foreign trade. It is sometimes forgotten that there was a very active commerce

some observations on the economy 241
within Khazaria as well. he existence of merchant irms in Ītil which had branches in diferent parts of southeastern Europe has already been noted. here was also a very active trade along the Volga between Ītil and Volga Bulghāria.156 Merchants regularly travelled between the Bur ās land and Ītil both by boat and land.157 Other Khazar merchants went further north along the Volga as far as Volga Bulghāria. his Khazar-Bulghār commerce was quite extensive and based on barter. While the Khazars acquired furs, wax and honey in the Bulghār lands,158 it is not clear what they exchanged in return for them.159 In fact, when ships from the Khazar lands arrived in Volga Bulghāria, the amīr collected a tithe “of the entire merchandise.”160 he lower and middle Volga were thus the center of a very lively internal commerce within Khazaria. he most revealing evidence on domestic trade is probably provided by the inds of large vessels such as amphoras and large pitchers used to transport and store a variety of products. Amphora shards are found in most Saltovo towns and many villages. While most of these inds have not been fully published and much remains to be done in the study of early medieval amphoras, it is clear that the various types and shapes of amphoras fall into two broad categories, imported and domestic. Imported amphoras came primarily from Constantinople and areas of the Black Sea other than the northern coasts. hese amphoras were primarily used to transport oil and wine to the Crimea and Khazaria. However, as we have seen, large quantities of amphoras were produced in both the Byzantine and Khazarian regions of the Crimea. Shards of the two main types of amphoras made in the Khazarian regions of the Crimea have been found throughout the Crimea as well as along the lower Don including Sarkel, along the Northern Donets as far as Saltovo, and in the Azov region at such sites as Tamatarkha.161 In short, the Saltovo potters of the Crimea produced many of the amphora in which wine from the Saltovo vineyards of the Crimea was shipped to other parts of the khaganate. Amphoras may well have been produced elsewhere in the khaganate. At Tamatarkha, for example, Pletneva divided the amphora inds of the eighth and ninth centuries into four groups based on the

242 thomas s. noonan
characteristics of the clay. One type was unquestionably imported from elsewhere. However, those shards belonging to another type widespread in southeastern Europe during the eighth and ninth centuries were considered to be locally made as were the shards belonging to a third type. But, as Pletneva added, it was impossible to prove this scientiically at the time she was writing.162 It is diicult to estimate the volume of this internal wine and oil trade. One reason for this is that the exact igures on amphora inds from such sites as Sarkel in the lower Don are diicult to uncover. here is no doubt that a relatively large number of such shards were found at Sarkel in strata dated from the second half of the ninth to the irst half of the tenth century. As in other sites, it appears that these amphoras included both those imported from outside the khaganate and those made within its borders.163 More recently, a chart published by Flerova suggests that over 2100 amphora shards were found in the Khazar strata of Sarkel during the excavations of 1949–1951.164 Finally, Pletneva has published an interesting map which shows the relative quantities of amphora shards (under 10% of all pottery, under 50%, etc.) found at various Saltovo sites.165 here is no doubt that amphoras constituted a signiicant percentage of the pottery found at numerous sites. It is hoped that future research will distinguish the types made inside and outside the khaganate and give us more precise igures on the number of shards from each site. When such data appears, it should be possible to analyze the wine and oil trade of Khazaria in much greater detail. In conclusion, wine was a very interesting item in the Khazar economy. Some wine was imported from abroad. Other wine came from the nearby vineyards in the Byzantine parts of the Crimea. But, some of the wine produced in the Khazarian Crimea and elsewhere in the khaganate was consumed locally as well as being exported to other parts of Khazaria. he wine trade of the khaganate thus accommodated a variety of tastes and a variety of pocketbooks. Large red-clay pitchers normally having one handle were widely employed throughout Khazaria in place of amphoras. In fact, they

probably evolved from amphoras in several stages while losing one handle. hese pitchers began to appear in the stratum of Tamatarkha dating to the eighth century and became extremely widespread in the ninth century replacing amphoras not only within the town but also for transport elsewhere. he quantity of inds at this site is so great that it is believed that one of the centers for their production was located here or in a neighboring village. his opinion is reinforced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of red-clay pitchers found at Tamatarkha in the strata of the eighth and ninth century were made from the same clay. Only a few shards from one part of the town were made from a diferent type of clay and apparently belonged to imported pitchers.166 More recently, Baranov has concluded that the high-throated pitchers found in several Saltovo sites in the Crimea as well as among the remains of Byzantine ships that sank along the Crimean coast were made in the Taman’ peninsula from whence they were sent to the Crimea, the Azov region, and the Don area.167 here was thus a signiicant volume of internal trade within the khaganate that encompassed forest products such as fur and honey, agricultural/food products such as grains, meat, and wine, and manufactured products such as metal jewelry, amphoras and large pitchers.
Conclusion
he prosperity and political viability of the Khazar khaganate were based on the existence of both a lucrative international trade and a well developed domestic commerce. A highly diversiied internal economy with a developed agriculture, extensive animal husbandry, and dynamic crat production was supplemented by widespread hunting and ishing. In many ways, Khazaria survived for so long because it was largely self-suicient and not dependent upon essential imports from abroad. Along with this balanced internal economy, Khazaria derived considerable income from its key role in the trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe. In the period from ca. 775 to ca. 900, the khaganate became large, powerful, and rich due, in large part, to the proits of

this trade. However, the shit of the main trade route from the Islamic world to European Russia via Volga Bulghāria ca. 900 caused a sharp drop in Khazaria’s income which threatened its political power. Hostile neighbors like Byzantium sensed this weakness and began a determined campaign to destroy the khaganate and annex much of its territory. he highly diversiied internal economy could not compensate for the loss of so much revenue derived from foreign commerce.



KHAZARIA AND RUS’:
AN EXAMINATION OF THEIR HISTORICAL RELATIONS
Vladimir Ja. Petrukhin
An impartial evaluation of the relations between Khazaria and Rus’ (or Eastern Slavs) within the limits imposed by oicial Soviet historiography was rather uncommon: the role of Khazaria was mainly pictured as an obstacle in the highly progressive processes of the development of the Russian state. In present-day studies (and not only in the recurrences of the old “Eurasianist” theories) the role of Khazaria is oten presented as almost determining these processes: going as far as the supposition that the calling-in of the Varangian princes to Novgorod by the Slavs, the Chud’ and the Merja (862 acording to the Primary chronicle—Povest’ vremennych let, PVL) was provoked by the threat of Khazar hegemony in Eastern Europe (cf. Novosel’tsev 1991, p. 6). On the contrary, the sources give evidence for another process: as early as the 9th century, the early Rus’ were forcing their way into the international markets through the river routes controlled by Khazaria. Archaeology, and above all numismatics, together with the Arab sources help us realize a certain community of interests that made the Varangians, the Slavs, the Merja and the Chud’ unite. From the period between the 8th–9th centuries, Arabic silver was imported to Eastern and Northern Europe via Khazaria (cf. Noonan 1983), and the onset of this import can be dated from the 860s—the date given in the chronicle for the calling-in of the Varangians (cf. Potin 1970; Noonan 1994, p. 226 f.). Sometimes, the hoards of the 9th century Arabic coins in the North of Eastern Europe are interpreted as tribute given to the Varangians, but it is much more likely that they represent evidence of the distribution of proits; the local upper strata had exercised their right to a part of the treasures and buried it as hoards in their settlements. he princes of this multi-tribal union with a certain cause (because the union actually included a number of peoples—“tribes”) were claiming the “imperial” title of khagan. Besides the Arab sources, these claims were recorded S.A. 839 in the Annales Bertiniani: a Byzantine embassy to the Carolingian emperor came with “certain men who said that they, that is, their people were called Rhos, their king was known as the



246 vladimir ja. petrukhin
Chaganus”. his is at the same time the earliest mention of the Rus’. he embassy of the Rus’ arrived in Constantinople “for the sake of friendship” and asked for permission to return home through the territory of the Carolingian empire. he emperor Louis the Pious, who was accustomed to repelling Viking attacks, suspected that they were spies as they turned out to belong to the “gens of the Sueones” (cf. Nazarenko 1999, pp. 288–290). heir fate as well as the destination of their return journey are unknown: whether they wanted to go back to Birka or Ladoga, because neither Novgorod nor Kiev of that time are ixed in the data of the written sources or archaeology. From this viewpoint, the latest attempts to ind the “Rus khaganate” in the Dnieper or Volkhov basin do not seem to be promising (cf. Sedov 1999, Zuckerman 2000) as they are based on a strained interpretation of the sources. he reports of Arab geographers about a mysterious island or peninsula of ar-Rûs ruled by a khagan actually date from the 9th century, but we do not know either its location or whether it actually did exist or was merely a relection of certain literary legends, either of Biblical origin, about the “Islands of peoples” or ancient graeco-roman traditions about hule. he new attempts to associate this island with Novgorod and neighbouring Gorodishche (“Old town”) are based on a direct identiication of the toponym’s meaning in alien languages: the Scandinavian name of Novgorod—Hólmgarđr (“Island town”—Franklin, Shepard 1996, p. 27 f.) and the vocabulary of Arab geographic literature (cf. Konovalova 2000, pp. 400 f.). One should remember in this connection that even Alexey A. Shakhmatov tried to ind this island near Staraja Russa: according to the late medieval sources there existed a locality named Ostrov (“Island”). his hypothesis, though antiquated from the point of view of modern historiography, was popular since the late Middle Ages (cf. the 16th century Voskresenskaja chronicle) and implied that Staraya Russa was the centre of the early Rus’ and Novgorod—New town—was the centre of the Varangians. Judging from the text of the Novgorod I Chronicle, Shakhmatov thought that the Varangians Askold and Dyr had settled in Kiev before the Varangian princes were called into Novgorod. Anatolij P. Novosel’tsev in one of his last works (1991) developed this hypothesis and was even ready to attribute to Askold and Dyr the embassy of 839 and the foundation of the “Rus khaganate” in the Middle Dnieper region. Shakhmatov based his constructions rather on the new (for his day) archaeological conception of the Norman colonization of Eastern Europe in the 9th10th centuries than on the textological data. Nowadays, it is evident that

in the 9th century the Scandinavians penetrated only into the North of Eastern Europe—into Ladoga, Novgorod and the Upper Volga. No reliable 9th century Scandinavian complexes were discovered either in the Upper or in the Middle Dnieper region—all of them should be dated from the 10th century. We have practically no traces of the retinue of Askold and Dyr, though according to the written sources it came in 860 via the route “from the Varangians to the Greeks” and settled in Kiev (cf. Petrukhin 1995, pp. 85 f.). Equally, we have no grounds to associate with Kiev the data about the Rus’ from the Annales Bertiniani—judging from the inds of coins. Generally, the Dnieper route was not functioning until the late 9th century and the Arabic silver traveled through the Don and the Oka to the Upper Volga and then to the Baltic (Noonan 1992). Valentin V. Sedov’s latest hypothesis (1999) which develops the traditions of Soviet historiography is marked by even greater misinterpretations of the sources: he seeks a powerful state of the early Slavonian Rus’ in the Middle Dnieper region and now associates it not with the Slavonic “antiquities of the Anti” on the right-bank Dnieper but with the let-bank Dnieper area of the so-called Volyntsevskaja culture. According to this hypothesis in the 830s the Khazar khaganate had to build Sarkel and other fortresses on the Don against the Rus’ who had actually formed this culture.1 In many aspects this construction follows Mikhail I. Artamonov’s hypothesis which, as far as we can imagine it nowadays,
1 As Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions (DAI, pp. 170–175), the fortress Sarkel
was built by the Byzantines under the emperor heophilus at the request of the khagan
and bek. Obviously, this fact has stimulated scholars to search for a Russian threat to
Khazaria. he logic of such suggestions seems dubious: though the people “rhos” were
actually mentioned for the irst time in connection with their embassy to heophilus,
this embassy can hardly be perceived as the main enemy of the Khazars—for the good
reason that Khazaria, at that time, was a Byzantine ally. he information about the raids
of the Rus’ against Amastris and Surozsh (Khazarian-Byzantine Sugdea) which are
placed before 842 (the end of heophilus’ reign) goes back to hagiographical sources,
but according to the later “Life of Stephen of Sudgea”, Rus’ was based in Novgorod and
not in the Middle Dnieper region. In this connection the traditional supposition seems
better grounded: Constantine Porphyrogenitus reports about another serious problem
in the Khazarian steppe of the 9th century—the aggravated relations between the Kha
zars and the Magyars. Probably, the system of fortresses on the Don was to defend the
khagan’s domain from the rebellious nomads and control the river and steppe routes
the branches of the “Silk road” (cf. Golden 1980, pp. 67 f.; Pletneva 1986, pp. 50 f.; 1996,
pp. 142 f.). Obviously, the Magyars were the people who blocked the return road for the
embassy of Rus’ to heophilus in 839.
It is chronologically diicult to connect the construction of the Khazarian fortresses
with the Volyntsevskaja culture: in the irst quarter of the 9th century in the let-bank
Dnieper; it was replaced by the so-called Romenskaja culture (cf. Sukhobokov, Jurenko
1993).

was formed under the direct pressure of oicial Soviet historiography and correspondingly was characterized by certain inherent contradictions (cf. Artamonov 1962, pp. 304 f.; 365 f.; Artamonov 1990). Actually, Artamonov thought that “as . . . the Slavs took possession of the Middle Dnieper region by the consent and with the assistance of the Khazars, when they settled there they became tributaries of the Khazar khaganate” (Artamonov 1990, p. 277). Here V.O. Kljuchevskij’s words (1987, pp. 139–140) should be recalled about the Khazar “yoke” which, as he thought, was not extremely hard and even helped the prosperity of the economy because the river routes to the Black Sea and Caspian markets were free for the loyal tributaries of the Khazars. In fact, most likely these river routes had been blocked—in the Middle Dnieper region there are practically no coin hoards from the 9th century, though the Khazar period in the Middle Dnieper region and even in the region between the Dnieper and the Don is marked by an intensive agricultural colonization, both Slavonic and Alanian. Even migrants from the right-bank Dnieper, the bearers of the Lucka Rajkovetskaja culture (Vinnikov 1998) settled on the Don. It is clear why the Khazars patronized the colonization of the forest-steppe zone: the nomads needed corn. his fact provides ample ground for the supposition that the data of the Arab sources on the twenty thousand (!) families of as-Saqâliba (in Arab tradition this is the term for the Slavs) and other inidels captured by the Arab commander Marwân b. Muhammad in 737 during his raid into Khazaria really concern the agricultural colonists from the Don (cf. Shakhmatov 1919, pp. 34–37; Novosel’tsev 1990, pp. 202–203; cf. also in this book the article by Tatiana Kalinina). he system of fortresses on the Don and in the basin of the Severskij Donets evidently helped to control these important regions, including the Vjatichi on the Don (the bearers of the so-called Borshevo culture) and Oka, as well as the Severjane on the let-bank Dnieper (signiicantly, their name is connected with the river-name Seveskij Donets; cf. Vinnikov, Pletneva 1998, pp. 38–39). And it is no less clear why the Slavic tributaries of the Khazars were interested in an alliance with the gangs of the Rus’: they also were forcing their way into the international markets. Artamonov thought that in the early 9th century when the Khazar khaganate was engaged in an internecine war—the uprising of the Kavars and the Magyars, in the Middle Dnieper region its rival—“the Khaganate of the Rhos” came into existance (Artamonov 1990, p. 286 f.). Here the problem of the Dnieper Slavs tribute to the Khazars which

was abolished, according to the chronicle, in the late 9th century by the Russian prince Oleg is tactfully avoided, as well as the chronicle concept of the Varangian origin of the Rus’. In this connection Artamonov’s concepts of the Rhos in the Middle Dnieper region were based on the “commonplace” of the historiography of that time about the autochthonous Rus’. Lately, a lot of works it have been published demonstrating that the names with the stem Rhos- (Rhosomoni, etc.) bore no relation to the name Rus’ (cf. the list in: Melnikova, Petrukhin 1991). Taking that into account, Sedov based his concept of the Slavonic origin of the Rus’ on a gloss—an insertion into the work by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurdadbech, dated from 840–880. It states that the merchants called ar-Rûs are “a sort of Slavs” (as-Saqâliba); they move from the distant Slavic lands to the Rûm (Black) Sea, where the ruler of Rûm (the Byzantine emperor) levies a tithe on them; another route leads them by the river of Slavs to Baghdad via Khazaria, and ar-Rûs pay a tithe to the ruler of the Khazars (Kalinina 1986, p. 71; сf. Коnovalova 2000). his is the only case in the Arab geographic literature where the Rus’ are identiied with the Slavs, but in the reports about the “khaganate of the Rus’ ” (to be more correct—about the khagan of the Rus’) used by Sedov, the Rus’ were actually opposing the Slavs: attacking them on their ships, selling them as slaves, etc. (cf. Ibn Rusta’s data: Novosel’tsev 1965, pp. 397 f.). he most ancient evidence of the origin of the Rus’ from “the gens of the Swedes” is the passage in the Annales Bertiniani (cf. the later chronicle formulae “from the Varangian gens”, etc.). In this connection one should turn to the so-called Anonymous report—the source of the data used by Ibn Rusta and others about the tribute collected from the Slavs by the Rus’ and the Magyars. his report throws light on the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe before Oleg’s raid on Kiev recounted by the chronicle. he Arab anonymous author, whose text Ibn Rusta used, reports that the land of the Magyars is situated between the countries of the Pechenegs and of the tribe Isghil/Asgil, Ashgil (Esgel, Esegel)—a section of the Bulgars of the Volga; the Magyars collect tribute from the neighbouring Slavs (as-Saqâliba), capture and sell them as slaves to the Greeks (ar-Rûm) in their landing stage at K.r.kh (Kerch). he Magyars roam between the two rivers in the country of as-Saqâliba—the Itil (which lows to the Khazars) and the Duba (or Ruta): beyond one of these rivers the people Nandar lives (they belong to ar-Rûm) and over their country there is a high mountain, beyond which a Christian people M.rwât lives.



250 vladimir ja. petrukhin
Here, the rivers between which the Magyars nomadized presents a major problem. One of them—the Duba was long ago identiied with the Danube, and in fact the people Nandor lived over it (this was the Magyar term for the Bulgars going back to the ancient Turkic ethnonym Onogundur). he Bulgars of the Danube settled in the territory of the Roman Empire (Byzantium) and were ascribed to ar-Rûm. Correspondingly, the mountain beyond which the M.rwât lived should be identiied with the Carpathians; in fact beyond the Carpathians lived the Slavs—the Moravians. he problem of Itil is more diicult as the Turkic term itil meant ‘a river’. Most of the scholars identify the Itil here with the Dnieper and not with the Volga (cf. among the latest works—Zakhoder 1967, pp. 47 f.; Kalinina 2003; Mishin 2002, pp. 54–60). he Magyars migrated over the Dnieper to the land Atelkuzu (Etelköz in Magyar means the country between two rivers)—and Constantine Porphyrogenitus tells us about it (DAI, Ch. 38). Ibn Rusta remarks that, as people said, “in earlier times the Khazars used to dig ditches against the Magyars and other peoples neighbouring with their country” (cf. Lewicki 1977, pp. 32–35; commentary—p. 107; cf. Zachoder 1967, pp. 48 f.). he question of dating the events described above is no less diicult. It is important that the anonymous author and Ibn Rusta do not mention the Rus in the country of the Slavs. In the text ar-Rûsiya “is situated in an island surrounded by a lake. he island where they (ar-Rûs) live extends for three-days travel, it is covered with forests and swamps . . . hey have a king who is called khâqân of ar-Rûs. hey attack the Slavs, coming to them in their ships: they disembark, capture them, then carry them of to Khazarân and Bulqâr and sell there. hey have no ploughed ields and they feed only with the products carried from the country of the Slavs.” From there, ar-Rûs used to set of to the Slavs to collect tribute and enslave them like the Magyars. It is signiicant that in the Anonymous report the routes of ar-Rûs and the Magyars difer: the Magyars trade with Bosporus while ar-Rûs trade with Bulgaria on the Volga and Khazaria. Rus’ mainly use the Volga route, their chances to move by the Don are questionable and their route apparantly lies far from the Dnieper. he data from Constantine Porphyrogenitus on the migrations of the Magyars can clear up the situation. He reports (DAI, Ch. 38) that for three years the Magyars (whom Constantine calls the Turks) had lived under the direct domination of the Khazars in Levedia—the country called ater their commander. hen the Pechenegs defeated by the Khazars occupied the country of the Magyars; a part of them was forced



an examination of their historical relations 251
out to Persia (?), and another part migrated to the West to Atelkuzu. he khaqan summoned Levedia from Atelkuzu and ofered him the position of the archon of the Magyars. he latter refused, and the Magyars elected Arpad their ruler: these data evidently testify to the beginning of the “autonomy” of the Magyars. Scholars traditionally locate the country Levedia to the West of the Don and Atelkuzu—to the West of the Dnieper. Constantine’s data about the Magyars (DAI, Ch. 38) demonstrate the situation typical of the relations between the Slavs and the nomads which did not consist of mere domination and paying tribute: the Magyars borrowed from the Slavs such important terms as military leader and law. Levedia is called the irst military leader (βοεβόδα), though Arpad was elected the archon, whom the Magyars raised on the shield according to the Khazar custom—law ( ). Characteristically, the Pechenegs also swore oaths to the Greeks according to the own laws (ζάκανα)—the Slavonic zakon became the term of the international law (judging from the treaties of the Rus’ with the Greeks, the Russian law—Zakon russkij—was recognized in Constantinople in the 10th century: cf. DAI, p. 290, commentary 5). Based on these data on Slavic-Magyar cooperation one can suppose that the transformation of the Slavonic culture in the let-bank Dnieper area by mid-9th century—the formation of the Romenskaja culture of the Severjane—was connected with the new Magyar domination, though (according to the Russian chronicle), as previously, the Slavic tribute must have been still paid to the Khazars—through their Magyar vassals (cf. Tolochko 2003, p. 26). In any event, now the area of the Romenskaja culture cannot be characterized as containing numerous Saltovo antiquities (cf. Grigorjev 2000, pp. 180 f.): the Magyars could have isolated the Slavs of the Dnieper from Khazaria. However the question is discussed—the Varangian tribute from the Slavs before the summoning of the Rus’ princes or the tribute paid by the Slavs to the newcomers—‘nakhodniki’ of Rjurik (PVL, p. 13)—the events described evidently took place before Oleg appeared in Kiev. By this time, the Magyars had already settled in Atelkuzu to the West of the Dnieper being for a time in conlict with the Khazars who tried to defend themselves with fortiications. According to the Anonymous author, Kerch was no longer a Greek town or a Khazar possession (contrary to king Joseph’s data—on the situation in Kerch according to the archaeological data, see Aibabin 1999, p. 222). Evidently, the uprising of the Magyars who joined the Kavars in opposition to Khazar domination



252 vladimir ja. petrukhin
must be dated from this period. However, the joint raid of the Magyars and the Kavars to the West, as far as Vienna, is dated 881 (Zuckerman 1998, pp. 674–679). Oleg who appeared in Kiev in 882 (according to the chronicle date) took advantage of the situation. Oleg came to Kiev with his Varangian and Slovene army which was called Rus’: the chronicle and other data demonstrate that Ibn Khurdâdhbeh’s gloss about the ar-Rûs merchants as a “type of the Slavs” goes back to the 880s though the whole work is dated from the 840s. he gloss itself was connected with the dynamics of the situation in Eastern Europe. For a proper understanding and dating of the gloss in Khurdâdhbeh’s work, the data of other sources should be taken into account. In particular, it is evident that the route of the ar-Rûs merchants to Byzantium (Rum) led them around Khazaria. Evidently, it must be the Dnieper route which was established not earlier than the raid of the Rus’ on Constantinople in 860, ater the calling-in of the Varangian princes, when, according to the Primary chronicle, Rjurik let Askold and Dyr go there from Novgorod. he corrected date of the passage from the so-called Bavarian Geographer locating the Rus’ (Ruzzi) near the Khazars generally corresponds to such a course of events: the list of the peoples was compiled in the second half of the 9th century and, as Alexander V. Nazarenko supposed (1994, pp. 39–40; 1996, pp. 16–17), was based on the Cyrillo-Methodian tradition. It also conirms indirectly the relative trustworthiness of the early chronicle dates connected with the dynamics of the development of the river routes in Eastern Europe by the Rus’. Under 882, the Primary Chronicle describes Oleg and Igor—Rjurik’s successors—pretending to be merchants travelling “to the Greeks”: this is the irst mention of the trade route “from the Varangians to the Greeks”. Having Askold and Dyr murdered, Oleg settled in Kiev and appropriated the tribute which the Khazars had levied on the let-bank Slavs—Severjane and Radimichi: so it is evident that the Volyntsevskaja culture marks the borders not of the “Rus’ Khaganate” but of the tributary territory, the dominion of Khazaria—the predecessor of the Russian land—the domain of the Kievan prince (cf. Nasonov 1951; Artamonov 1990, p. 277; Petrukhin 1995, pp. 83 f.). he Volyntsevskaja culture and the Romenskaja culture ater it formed in the 9th century, was the prehistoric kernel of the Rus’ land, in the let-bank Dnieper region. he Volyntsevskaja culture, Slavic in its basis, comprises certain elements of the Alanian—Bulgharian SaltovoMajatskaja culture of the Khazars: some settlements have the traces of



an examination of their historical relations 253
yurts. he remnants of the huge (up to 40 m square) yurt-like dwellings were found in the greatest fortiied site of the Volyntsevskaja culture near Bititsa on the Psel’ river. One of the irst explorers of these inds, D.T. Beresovets, (1965) thought that Bititsa was the administrative centre of the khaganate deep in Slavic territory.2 Two major monuments associated with the nomad world were also discovered in the let-bank Dnieper region—these are the complexes near Malaja Pereshchepina and Novye Senzshery in the Vorskla basin (cf. Flerov 1996, pp. 3336, 68–69). Irrespective of the attribution of the famous hoard from Pereshchepina to the Bulghar khan Kubrat (Zalesskaja et al. 1997) or to a Khazar ruler (Ambroz 1982) it is evident that this region was traditionally (from the 7th century) important for the “nomadic empires”. he comparison of the archaeological data with the chronicle permits us to suppose that the Volyntsevskaja culture was characteristic of the Slavic tribes—the “confederation” of Poljane, Severjane and, probably, some units of Radimichi—the tributaries to the Khazars (cf. Shcheglova 1987). he inds of the Volyntsevskaja-type monuments near Kiev in the right-bank Dnieper region (cf. Petrashenko 1990) make more clear the stability of the legend of Kij—the founder of Kiev—as a boatman through the Dnieper (though Nestor as the adherent of the version of his princely origin argued against it). In Kiev, the remnants of a “Saltovo”type burial-ground with cremations have been discovered (Karger 1958, p. 137). he transformation of Volyntsevo culture to the Romenskaja (Romny) culture in the 9th century was connected with disappearence of yurt-like dwellings and appearence of the irst silver hoards in the eastern periphery (Khazar border) of the Severjane tribal territory (cf. Noonan 1983, pp. 273 f.; Grigorjev 2000). he Khazars—or their allies the Hungarians—had to share their trade proits with the neighbouring Severjane and Radimichi. Signiicantly, the Oka segment of the trade route (with the Vjatichitributaries of the Khazars) accumulated a big part of the silver coins
2 One of the later scholars interpreted Bititsa as a tribal centre of the Slavic “Rus”
opposing the Khazars (cf. Sukhobokov 1992, pp. 65 f.), but the fact that in this forti
ied site besides the Slavic semi-earthhouses there were found the traces of the spacious
yurts, numerous items of equipment typical of the nomad horsemen, cauldrons, etc. (cf.
Sukhobokov, Jurenko 1993) provides evidence also for the presence of steppe-dwellers
there. he ind of a hoard with agricultural implements is also signiicant.

imported via Khazaria to the North—to the Upper Volga, Novgorodian land and Scandinavia (cf. Kropotkin 1978; Noonan 1983, pp. 273–276). Evidently, the ar-Rûs merchants had to share their proits with the local population—i.e. with the Vjatichi who controlled the portages from the Upper Don to the Oka. In light of the fact that there are only single inds of hoards in the territory of the Khaganate itself, one has the paradoxical impression that the tributaries had greater possibilities to accumulate silver than the dominating Turkic group (cf. Noonan 1983, p. 276). It seems that these possibilities were connected with their payments in furs and corn as well as with their fur and corn trade. Judging from the Russian chronicle, the tribute from Vjatichi and Radimichi—both of them in regions with hoards—could be estimated in a monetary unitthe shcheljag. Under the year 885 the chronicle reports that the Radimichi paid Oleg shcheljags as they had paid the Khazars. Under 964 the Primary chronicle reports that Svjatoslav asked the Vjatichi like Oleg: “to whom do you pay tribute?” hey answered that they paid it to the Khazars—a “shcheljag” from each plough. It is clear that the Vjatichi like the Radimichi paid this typical peasant tribute—from each ploughin the same mysterious “shcheljags”. Lately the “shcheljags” have been interpreted as a relection of the Jewish name for a dirhem—“sheleg” (“white”, “silver coin”—Novosel’tsev 1990, p. 117). he linguists however think that it could rather be an adoption from the Old Scandinavian Skillingr (Vasmer 1987, p. 508; cf. Noonan 1983, pp. 276–277). his hypothesis corresponds with the historical situation: judging from the hoards in the Oka region, from the 9th century the Vjatichi served the Rus merchants in the Oka route and could adopt the West European name of a monetary unit. It seems that the same name (and the name Rus’ itself) Oleg brought into the let-bank Dnieper region. But it is no less clear why the Slavic tributaries of the Khazars, especially in the Middle Dnieper area, were interested in an alliance with the bands of the Rus’: they also were forcing their way into the international markets. he “transfer” of the capital by Oleg to Kiev—“the mother of Russian towns” (in 880s) was evidently connected not only with the ideas of the princely clan that the Rus’ princes ruled over all the Slavs (such was the viewpoint of the chronicler) but also with their striving for the world markets around Khazaria. As was noted, the moment was very favourable for this transfer: Khazaria was engaged in a conlict with the now joined Magyars and Kavars. In this connection it is signiicant



an examination of their historical relations 255
that before the capture of Kiev Oleg stayed in Ugorskoje and the Black Ugrian migration—through Ugorskoje—to their future motherland in Pannonia was apparently described (under 898) as linked with the preceding settling down of the Rus’ in Kiev. Was Oleg’s state consolidating many Slavic and Chudian tribes from the Volkhov and the Upper Volga region to the Middle Dnieper Rus’ khaganate? he sources indicate that Russian princes kept on claiming the title of khagan—the rulers of vast “nomadic empires” dominating over many peoples and tribes—the Avarian and the Khazar khaganates. In early medieval diplomatic practice, khagan was considered equal to the title of emperor and therefore the claims of the irst Rus’ princes and other rulers to this title were disputed in the 9th century diplomatic documents. In 871, the Carolingian emperor Louis II wrote to the Byzantine emperor Basil I: “In Latin codes the title “khagan” is used in respect of the ruler of the Avars but not of the Khazars (Gazani) or the Northmen (Nortmanni), or to the prince of the Bulgars (principum Vulgarum)” (cf. Chronicon Salernitanum. Cap. 107; Nazarenko 1999, pp. 290–292). his passage indicates that in the Frankish Empire, irstly, the information about the Khazars was scant, and secondly, since the term Rhos appeared in the Annales Bertiniani, Rus’ had been irmly associated with the Normans while the claims for the title of khagan set up in 839 had not been recognized. Basing themselves on this phrase, both the adherents of the “Russian khaganate” in Kiev and those viewing it as located on the Volkhov came to the paradoxical conclusion that Louis’s diplomatic argument was directed against the Byzantine tradition: supposedly, the “Byzantine chancellery” still used titled the ruler of Rus’ the ‘khagan’ (cf. Nazarenko 1999, pp. 290–292). Such a conclusion might be possible if the same chancellery had also titled the Bulgarian prince ‘khagan,’ but in the 9th century Byzantine Empire the ruler of Bulgaria was still named ‘archon’ just as the Rus’ princes were named ‘archons’. he only possessor of the title ‘khagan’ recognized in the Byzantine Empire was the ruler of Khazaria. herefore, Louis’s message cannot be used as evidence for the existence of the Russian khaganate—it merely provides evidence regarding the claims of the Rus’ princes. Sometimes these claims are considered as evidence that at least in the 830s the Khazar khagan possessed full power and had not been reduced to the position of a “sacral king” by the bek. he Rus’ princes would not have considered such a position enviable (Novosel’tsev 1990, pp. 134 f.;



256 vladimir ja. petrukhin
cf. Zuckerman 1995, pp. 251–255). As concerns the prestigiousness of the title ‘khagan’ for the Russian princes who claimed real power over Eastern Europe, one cannot help noticing a paradox in the sources’ data. In the 920s Ibn Fa lân described the mode of life of a Rus’ prince as that of a sacral king: the king (malik) has his residence in a high castle with four hundred champions of his retinue, each of them has his own slave-girl. he most dependable of his men die with the king ater his death. All of them—the champions and the girls—sit (and sleep at night) near the king’s great and richly ornamented throne-bed, shared with “forty slave girls destined for his bed. And sometimes he lies with one of them in the presence of his fellows, without descending from his throne.. He does not leave the throne even to relieve himself, and if he wishes to ride somewhere, he mounts a horse directly from the throne... He has no other activity except copulating with his girls, drinking and feasting. He has a lieutenant (khalîfa), who commands troops, ights his enemies and substitutes for him before his subjects” (Kovalevskij 1956. p. 146). his description clearly corresponds to the mode of life of the Khazar khagan in Ibn Fa lân’s report:
As concerns the king of the Khazars, who is called Khâqân, he does not show himself except (once) every four months, appearing at a great distance. hey called him Great Khâqân and his deputy is called Khâqân Beh. It is the latter who leads his armies and governs them and takes charge of the afairs of the state and cares for the state and appears before the people and the neighboring kings show submission to him . . . he custom of the (great) king of the Khazars is that he has twenty ive wives. Each of them is one of the daughters of one of the kings who confront him, taken freely or by force . . . he length of his rule is forty years. If the king exceeds it by a single day, the subjects and his courtiers discharge or kill him, saying his reason has failed and his understanding is become disordered . . . (Golden, 1980, I, pp. 98–99)
he Russian princely matrimonial tradition might have been inluenced by the Khazar one: according to the Primary Chronicle before his baptism prince Vladimir (like king Solomon) had a lot of wives and concubines in Kiev. But what is most essential is that the description of the Russian “sacral king” does not correspond to Russian historical reality. According to both the Russian Primary Chronicle and the Byzantine sources (Constantine Porphyrogenitus), synchronous to Ibn Fa lân’s report, in their policy prince-vojevoda Oleg as well as prince Igor were very active: they were not prisoners in their “castles”. And although the Chronicle



an examination of their historical relations 257
stories about the death of the irst Russian princes, especially of Oleg (912) and Igor (944), correspond to the motif of the “ritual death”, the historical context of their death demonstrates active conlict with the tributaries—the Slavonic tribes. Vladimir absolutely does not resemble the “sacral king” of Ibn Fa lân’s account: to gain possession of Kiev he himself killed his rivals including his elder brother. here are no traces of the “Khazar” diarchy in the 10th century Russian tradition. It is evident that the claims of the irst Russian princes to the prestigious title of khagan were mainly connected with their political ambitions and directed “outside” to be demonstrated at the courts of the Byzantine and Frankish emperors (cf. the data of Annales Bertiniani). he Russian merchants’ tales about the “ceremonial life” of the Russian king also presented information for an “outside” observer (Ibn Fa lân) and cannot be directly connected with the realities of this life (Beilis 1992; Golden 1993, Petrukhin 2004). he claims of the irst Russian princes to the title and more likely—to the power of the Khazar khagan—were quite natural; the Khaganate not only had spread its rule over the Slavic tribes bordering with the steppe in the Middle Dnieper and Oka regions (Vjatichi), actually it had control over the river routes leading to the Middle East and Byzantium via the Volga, the Don and the Dnieper. In the 960s the Khazar king (melech) Joseph wrote to Hasdai ibn Shaprut—the Cordoban caliph’s high oicial: “I protect the mouth of the river (Itil—Volga, V.P.) and prevent the Rus arriving in their ships from setting of by sea against the Ishmaelites (Moslems—V.P.) and (equally) all (their) enemies from setting of by land to Bab (“ the Gate”, Derbent—V.P.). I wage war with them. If I let them (in peace) for a single hour they would crush the whole land of the Ishmaelites up to Baghdad . . .” (Kokovtsov 1932, p. 102). Based on the legend of the calling-in of the Varangian princes found in the Russian chronicle, a supposition can be put forward that the original division of the spheres of inluence in Eastern Europe went by the Oka basin: the Upper Volga and the territory of Muroma were controlled by Rjurik’s men while the Vjatichi paid tribute to the Khazars. he chronicle describing Oleg’s army which included “the Varangians and the Slovene and the others who were called the Rus’ ” as well as Ibn Khurdâdhbeh’s description of the route of the Rûs merchants with their interpreters—the Slavic eunuchs—note the cooperation of the Rus’ and the Slavs. he break-through of the Rus’ to the South—to Kiev and Constantinople (c. 860) was connected with the establishment of the direct route



258 vladimir ja. petrukhin
to Byzantium via the Dnieper (the way “from the Varangians to the Greeks”) and the securing of it for the Rus’ ater Oleg’s campaign. he appropriation by the Russian prince of the Khazar tribute from Severjane and Radimichi and the formation of the Dnieper Slavs group on the territory controlled by the Khazars obviously resulted in conlict with Khazaria and the trade blocade of Eastern and Northern Europe: in the last quarter of the 9th century the entry of Arab silver through Khazar territory was in crisis (Noonan 1985, 1987, pp. 200 f.). he inlow of Arab silver to Rus’ resumed in the 910s, but now it went from the Samanids through Volgo-Kama Bulgaria—around Khazaria. Bulghar becomes the main trading station for international trade with Rus’ (in 921/922 Ibn Fa lân still called its ruler a tributary of the Khazar khagan). Ibn Fa lân himself came with the caliph’s embassy which was invited to Bulghar to convert the Volga Bulghars to Islam (Kovalevskij 1956): a fact which indicates its relative independence; in 950s the Bulghar rulers began to mint their own coins—and this is a demonstration of real independence (cf. Noonan 1992, p. 251). he Middle Dnieper region matched the Middle Volga. Here the maximum number of silver coins (more than 10000) dates to the irst quarter of the 10th century—the hoards were found on the both banks of the Dnieper including Kiev—and these are the irst Kievan hoards (NAR, pp. 359–360). Oleg who had irmly established himself in Kiev continued the expansion along the route “from the Varangians to the Greeks”. Having united in his army all his subject tribes he undertook a campaign against Constantinople (in PVL under 907) and concluded a treaty with the Greeks in 911 (its text is preserved in PVL). However, in this treaty Oleg was titled “great prince” (archon is the corresponding Greek title) but not “khagan”—the Khazar khaganate with a legitimate ruler still existed (cf. Petrukhin 2002). hese events described in PVL were revised more than once in presentday historiography. his “revision” was based on a formal comparison of the data of the Novgorod I Chronicle (NPL) with the so-called Cambridge document alongside the documents of the Jewish-Khazar correspondence (s. among the latest works Golb&Pritsak 1997, 2004 and the discussion in the editor’s commentary). NPL dates Igor’s unsuccessful raid on Constantinople back to 920 and Oleg’s revenge campaign—to 922, while the Cambridge document associates the raid on Byzantium of a “melek” of Rus’ Hlgu with the reign of Romanus Lecapenus (920–944). he motif of Oleg’s death on his way “over the sea” (NPL) coincides with Hlgu’s death “over the sea” (Cambridge document). In other details



an examination of their historical relations 259
the descriptions of the events in NPL and the Cambridge document are completely diferent: in NPL Oleg undertook a successful revenge campaign (ater Igor’s defeat at the walls of Constantinople), while Hlgu, ater his defeat at the hands of the Khazars, was forced, on their demand, to invade Byzantium and was utterly defeated. he identiication of Oleg and Hlgu based on the likeness of their names and some motifs in the narrative sources should be considered a sort of “historiographic misunderstanding”: Oleg’s grave in Kiev was well known according not only to PVL but also to the 12th century Kievan chronicle, while the text of NPL presents a shortened local version of the chronicle legend about Oleg’s death. he date 920 of Igor’s campaign in NPL and the resulting date of Oleg’s campaign are connected not with the real dates of certain deeds by Rus’ princes but with the limited circle of sources available to the author of the Primary Chronicle. He did not know George the Monk’s chronicle with its precise date of Igor’s campaign—941 and dated it from the early period of Romanus Lecapenus’s reign. he name Oleg/Hlgu was a “patrimonial” Russian princes’ name and belonged to a Russian princely clan representative who had been obviously defeated by the Khazars and was forced to participate in the campaign against Constantinople among Igor’s troops in 941. his name was not mentioned among the names of the princes of “Russian gens” in Igor’s treaty with the Greeks (944) because Hlgu was not alive by that time. Correspondingly, the Cambridge document’s statement that ater Hlgu had been defeated Rus’ submitted to Khazar rule should be regarded as a traditional view of the “nomadic states” regarding their defeated opponents and not as the real domination of the Khazar khaganate which was on the eve of its fall (Petrukhin 2000). Obviously, Hlgu was not a Kievan ruler: supposedly, he resided in Chernigov—the centre of the Dnieper let-bank traditionally connected with Khazaria. Kiev itself was formed as a town and the centre of Poljanian land in the pre-Christian and the “pre-Russian” period—the period of the Khazar tribute. In the view of the newly found letter from the Kievan Jewish-Khazar community (palaeographically it is dated to the 10th century) this period evoked (and revitalized) a new burst of interest in the problem of the origin of Kiev. he latest attempt by Omelian Pritsak (cf. Golb, Pritsak 1982) to regard the letter from the Kievan JewishKhazar community as evidence of Khazar rule over Kiev in the 930s as well as the attempt to identify the Poljane with the Khazars seems merely paradoxical. he contents of the letter indicate, rather, the rule of non-Jews (goyim) over the Kievan Jews who were forced to send the



260 vladimir ja. petrukhin
debtor, Jacob, a member of their community, with his request for help so far abroad that the letter was found in the Cairo genizah. In Old Rus’ the right to administer justice belonged to the prince, and judging from the treaties between Rus’ and the Greeks of 911 and 944, inancial operations were also under the control of the prince and his administration. It should be noted that according to the letter the Kievan community seems to have been relatively poor: for a debt of 100 coins it managed to gather only 60. In Old Rus’ silver coins—Arabic dirhems (Old Russian kunas) were in use, and thousands of them have been found in Russian hoards. It is diicult to form a judgment on numbers of the community: there are eleven signatures under the letter, evidently they belonged to the heads of wealthy families.3 In any event, certain traces of this community in pre-Christian Kiev really did exist. While the hypothesis of the Khazar (Khorezmian) origin of the name Kiev arbitrarily tears this toponym out of the range of similar Slavonic names (cf. Trubachev 1992, pp. 58 f. and the ongoing discussion with the author of this hypothesis, O. Pritsak, in—Golb, Pritsak 1997, pp. 210 f.), the name of the other “Poljanian brother”—legendary founder of Kiev Khoriv (Khoreb) and the mountain-name Khorevitsa demonstrate the Biblical tradition. It was on Mount Horeb that Moses saw the Burning Bush and received the Tablets of the Law; there also the Holy Land was promised (Exodus 3.1–2 f.). he Christian chronicler obviously did not “recognize” the Biblical name in the Kievan placename: evidently, the mountain—name Khorevitsa had been deeply rooted in the pre-Christian Kievan microtoponymy; judging from the Slavonic names of the Kievan community members (cf. the “oxymoron”-like name Gostjata ben Kjabar Kohen, etc.—Torpusman 1989) this microtoponymy was also Slavonic. Besides that, we have some other grounds for searching for traces of the Jewish-Khazar community in this microtoponym: the treatise “De administrando imperio” by Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved another Kievan toponym—the name of the fortress Sambatas (DAI, ch. 9) which also refers to Jewish sources.
3 he interpretation of the names of the community members—signatories to the
letter (Turkic, according to O. Pritsak, or Slavonic, according to A. Torpusman) should
be considered hypothetical. Equally, the meaning of the runic inscription in the lower
let part of the letter is not clear: its interpretation by O. Pritsak as a decision by a Khazar
oicial in Kiev (hoqurum—“I have read”) is based not on the Khazar but on the Orkhon
tradition and specialists consider it questionable (сf. remarks by Vladimir Napol’skikh //
Golb, Pritsak 2004, pp. 221 f.).

he names Sambatas, Sambation, etc. refer to a miraculous river from the Talmudic legends which seethes on weekdays and lies at rest on Sabbaths; beyond it the ten lost tribes of Israel were condemned to live in exile (Arkhipov 1995, pp. 71–96). his river lows along the extreme frontier of the inhabited world: for the Jewish diaspora Kiev was such an extreme frontier. Obviously, the problem of the “non-recognition” of the name Horeb by the Russian chronicler cannot be explained as a simple lack of knowledge of the Biblical text (though the Philosopher’s Speech—the brief chronicle’s account of the sacred history—telling about how the Law granted, does not mention Mount Horeb). In the chronicle the theme of the Exodus is directly connected with the deliverance from the Khazar tribute. And it is not a simple establishment of “historical fact”—the domination of Russian princes—contemporaries of the chronicler—over the Khazars (in Tmutarakan’): the motif of this deliverance concludes the Cosmographic Introduction to PVL, ater it follows the chronicle itself—the year by year history of the Russian land. he Cosmographic Introduction “continues” the sacred history with the history of Slavic settlement in Japheth’s “lot”—the “lot” of Noah’s son who was specially blessed (Kravetskij 1996, p. 89); moreover, the coming deliverance of SlovenePoljane from the Khazar captivity with their simultaneous obtaining the future Russian land as the Promised Land became the central episode of this Introduction. Kiev as the centre of this land could not be associated with a “marginal”, though a sacred locus like Horeb (according to the chronicle’s gloss about the route “from the Varangians to the Greeks”, the approaching glory was predicted for Kiev by the Apostle Andrew): such an association was characteristic of the preceding Jewish-Khazar tradition, and the chronicler was overcoming it (in this respect he was the follower of the Russian princes—see Petrukhin 2003). he chronicle associates the overcoming of the Khazar tradition not only with the military and political crash of Khazaria under Svjatoslav, but also with the following act of the Choice of Faith. It reports very briely about the campaign against Khazaria. Under 964 it tells that Svjatoslav campaigned on the Oka and the Volga (!) and subjugated the Vjatichi who had settled there. hen, “Svjatoslav marched against the Khazars; when the Khazars learned that, they came out with their prince—the khagan [. . .] Svjatoslav overpowered the Khazars and seized their town—Belaja Vezha. He defeated both the Jas and the Kassogians”. he Khazar town should obviously be interpreted as their capital Itil (Atil) in the Lower Volga; Belaya Vezha—the former fortress Sarkel



262 vladimir ja. petrukhin
which the Byzantians had built on the Don for the Khazars—became a Russian town. he prince conquered the Jas (the Alans) and the Kassogians (the Adygeis) in the North Caucasus; probably, Tmutarakan’ was also subjugated by Kiev. Obviously, Svjatoslav had crushed the khagan’s domain—the territory for nomadizing between Sarkel on its western frontier and Itil (Atil) as the winter camp (cf. Golden 1980, pp. 82–83; Pletneva 1986, pp. 49–50) which was described by king Joseph in his letter. hus, the prince made a circular raid through the Khazar dominions moving from the Lower Volga to the Don and returned to Kiev (cf. Artamonov 1962, pp. 426–428). he mention of the second campaign against the Vjatichi under 966 is the result of the later division of the Initial Chronicle text into annual records—cf. Petrukhin 1995, pp. 103 f.). Mstislav, settled in Tmutarakan’ by his father Vladimir Svjatoslavich, again (in 1022) had to campaign against the Kassogians who surrendered to the Russian prince. Signiicantly, when intervening in the princely internecine struggles in 1024, Mstislav came to Rus’ with “Khazars and the Kassogians” and he laid his claim to Kiev—thus trying to “restore” the Khazar dominion while his brother Jaroslav was sitting in Novgorod. he whole situation seems to “return” to the beginning of Russian history—to the epoch of Oleg, but the “return” did not take place—the Kievans rejected Mstislav and he was forced to reside in the let-bank Chernigov (PVL, pp. 64–65). his connection between Chernigov and Tmutarakan’ (the steppe in the broader sense) was typical of the whole early medieval period of Russian history. In any event, when Russian princes resided in Tmutarakan’ in the late 11th century they could be titled the “archons of Matrakhia (Tmutarakan’), Zikhia (in Old Russian the Kassogian realm) and the whole of Khazaria”—such was the inscription on the Byzantine seal of Oleg Svjatoslavich, the son of a Chernigovian prince (Janin 1970, pp. 26 f.). he past political domination of Khazaria over Rus’ was rather illusory, but equally the Russian rule over the lands which the Khazar khaganate had once possessed was also not long. In the early 12th century, Byzantium established the control over Tmutarakan’ and in the mid-12th century the Russians were forced to leave Belaja Vezha.4 In the chronicle, the overcoming of the Khazar tradition is chiely associated with the Choice of Faith and the Christianization of Rus’

an examination of their historical relations 263
under Vladimir in 986. he chronicle motif of the Choice of Faith was put in a concrete historical context. he arrival in Kiev of envoys from the Moslem Bulghars was not a mere missionary action—they came to conclude a peace treaty ater the war of 985, but Moslems could not conclude it with the pagans. Cf. the report of Ibn al-Athîr about the Khazar conversion to Islam ater the fall of the khaganate under Svjatoslav: in 965 “a tribe of Turks (the Oghuz—V.P.) attacked the Khazar land and the Khazars appealed to the people of Khorezm, but the latter denied assistance saying that they were inidels (al-kufâr), but if they accepted Islam they would help. hey converted to Islam except their king, and then the people of Khorezm helped them and forced the Turks to set them free, and ater that their king also accepted Islam” (Novosel’tsev 1990, p. 222). Evidently, here the pagan Khazars are implied: the Judaists are not inidels but the “people of Scripture” (ahl al-kitâb), that is why the Moslem author highlights in particular the Judaic Khazar king who converted to Islam separately from his people. Obviously, the Bulghar envoys also made the conversion of the inidel Vladimir to the “true faith” a condition of the peace treaty with Rus’—here their missionary activities were traditionally grounded. he attempts of the German missionaries to convert Rus’ to Christianity also had a tradition: as Vladimir’s answer to the embassy of the “Germans from Rome” indicates, the “fathers” of the prince did not accept their faith. Correspondingly, the character of the Jewish-Khazar embassy (“Khazarian Jews”) needs a thorough historical analysis, especially in view of the fact that in the Old Russian (and Byzantine) literature it is almost the only mention of the Judaism of the Khazars (or in Khazaria—cf. Chekin 1990; cf. on Constantine the Philosopher’s polemic with the Jews before the khagan—Arkhipov 1995, pp. 17 f.). he scholars interpreted the acknowledgement of the Jews that “their land”—Jerusalem—was given to the Christians as evidence of the later origin of the whole motif of the Jewish embassy: in fact, Jerusalem was captured by the Christians in the course of the irst Crusade in 1099 (PVL, p. 454: cf. Berlin 1919, pp. 134–135). his statement, however, should be rejected on the following grounds: irstly, the polemic on faith is included in the Novgorod I Chronicle as well as in PVL and therefore it is the part of the text of the so-called Initial Chronicle of 1095. Secondly, the Crusadors were Latin Catholics, and the First Crusade was undertaken in the period of the intensiied Greek—Latin (and Russian—Latin) polemic ater the division between the Greek and the Latin Churches in 1054. he whole



264 vladimir ja. petrukhin
dispute corresponds to the traditions of this polemic, and the seizure of Jerusalem by the Crusaders could hardly be interpreted by the chronicler as the establishment of Christian rule over it, especially in view of the fact that the town was captured from the Moslems and not from the Jews. More likely, the chronicle polemic on faith relects the traditional “imperial” Byzantine claims on the Holy Land: actually, the “Philosopher’s Speech” tells that “Romans” (Rumians) have captured the land of Jews (PVL, p. 40). hus, the chronicle motif of the Khazarian Jews follows the early tradition and not the construction dated from the early 12th century. Nowadays ater the discovery of the letter from the Kievan JewishKhazar community the local Kievan sources of this tradition become quite obvious. Sometimes a special purpose is perceived even in the chronicler’s words about the Khazarian Jews stating that they had heard about the arrival of the Bulgars and the Germans to Vladimir. In fact it was a mere rhetorical device typical of the chronicle’s debates on faith: according to the chronicle, the Philosopher commissioned by the Greeks arrived ater the Jews and also spoke about the rumours he had heard. he Philosopher had heard only about the German and Bulghar embassies—so Vladimir reported to him about the Jewish embassy and became the addressee of the “Philosopher’s Speech” with its anti-Jewish polemic. Despite the wide-spread opinion (cf. Makarij 1994, pp. 230 f.; Toporov 1995, pp. 517 f.) the Jewish activity could not match the missionary work of the Latins and the Moslems on the ground that missionary work was not characteristic of the Judaic tradition (it was noticed even by V.N. Tatishchev in the 18th century—Tatishchev 1995, p. 231). It was prescribed to warn those who wanted to be converted to Judaism of the persecutions of the Jews for their faith (and not to claim that their desires became real)—cf. the motif of the dispersion of the Jews for their sins in the Jewish-Khazar correspondence. In the epoch of the milllenarian expectations (the end of the 1st millennium of the Christian Age) the Kievan community rooted in the Slavic-Russian world could participate in a traditional medieval interconfessional dispute despite the traditional Jewish prohibition of the missionary work (Petrukhin 2001a). he historiographical notions of the real possibilities for spreading and even propagation of Judaism in Rus’ present an obvious overstatement. Rus’ was guided by the Byzantine cultural model and adopted from Byzantium not only Christianity but also the active (polemical) rejection of other confessions; the polemic on faith as well as the



an examination of their historical relations 265
“Sermon on Law and Grace” by Ilarion are full of this rejection. he anti-Jewish rhetoric of the “Sermon” was actual so far as Rus’ became the successor of the Khazar khaganate: the Russian princes—Vladimir and Jaroslav—received the right to the title of khagan (this title seems to be recognized in Byzantium: Vasilevski 1991, pp. 14 f.), but for Christian Rus’ the state religion of Khazaria was the Past—Old—Law. he “new” Russian people, as it was called by Ilarion as well as by the Chronicler, was opposed to the “old” people of the Old Testament as the last people blessed by the Grace. It is essential that Ilarion did not use the Slavonic term židove for the Jews, actual neighbours of the Slavs, but the bookish term ijudei (Birnbaum 1981, pp. 228–229). As was already noted (cf. Fedotov 1966) the historical conception of the chronicler compared the deliverance of Rus’ from the Khazar captivity with the deliverance of Israel from the Egyptian exile: even Byzantium (practically not mentioned by Ilarion—cf. BLDR. V.1, p. 44) was excluded from this historical tradition. his opposition of the “old” and “new” peoples, the Jews and the Russians, became constant for the whole Old Russian (and not only Old Russian) tradition.

THE KHAZARS AND THE MAGYARS
András Róna-Tas
Introduction
My paper is based on my book Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages (Budapest, 1999, CEU Press), which has been published several years ago in Hungary. It deals in 600 pages with the early history of the Hungarians and East Europe until the middle of the 10th century. It focuses on the relationship of the Hungarians with the Turks, above all with the Khazars. In the following I shall concentrate on some of my new results leaving aside references and citations, which can be found in at my book. See also the bibliography the end of this paper.
1. Khazar studies in Hungary
he main periods of Khazar studies in Hungary are the following: a) Khazars in the Latin chronicles 12th–17th centuries, b) Khazars in the historical works of the 18th-early 19th centuries, c) Khazars in the so-called Ugor—Turkic discussion on the origin of the Hungarians, Vámbéry and Budenz, Hunfalvy, Pauler, Munkácsi, d) From Zoltán Gombocz (1898) to Louis Ligeti and e) present studies. Of great importance is the work of Gombocz (Die bulgarisch-türkischen Lehnwörter in der ungarischen Sprache 1912), less known are the changes in the opinion of Gombocz. It is also unknown that the key igure of Hungarian oriental studies, Louis Ligeti, gave a lecture on the Khazars in 1945 at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, which he never published. Ligeti’s paper on the Kievan letter (1981, published in 1984) raises some problems of the word written in runiform letters in connection with earlier solutions given by Pritsak (1982). His last, great monograph published in 1986 he Turkic connections of the Hungarian language before the Conquest and in the age of the Árpáds remained inaccessible to the greater circle of scholars, not only because it appeared only in Hungarian, but also because of its structure and uneven reasoning. If I should summarise the history of the Khazar



270 andrás róna-tas
studies in Hungary in one sentence I would say: it is the history of the suppression of the “Khazar problem”.
2. The name of the Khazars
he name of the Khazars played an important role in the identiication of their language. In his work published in 1912, Z. Gombocz analysed the name of the Khazars. He claimed that a) it is a self-designation, b) it has a word medial -z- and c) it is of Turkic origin. From these he came to the conclusion: “Aus der oben gegebenen deutung des namens Kazar kann nur gefolgert werden, dass das chasarische eine z-sprache war, und folgedessen als quelle der alttürkischen lehnwörter der ungarischen sprache nicht in betracht kommt” (1912:199). his claim was accepted by later research and inluenced not only research on the Turkic loanwords in Hungarian but also the judgement of the main historical questions of the Khazars. We know from Priskos that around 463 A.D. Oghur tribes appeared in Eastern Europe. Ater the establishment of the irst Turkic Khaghanate in 551 East Turkic tribes also reached Europe. If the Khazars spoke a z-Turkic language, they may have arrived in the West only ater the middle of the 6th century, if they spoke an r-Turkic language they pertained to the groups, which arrived in the middle of the 5th century. he discovery of the Terh Inscription by C. Dorjsüren and its publication by S. Kljashtornyj in 1980 (English version in 1982) brought a decisive change in the discussion. he Terh inscription written in the Turkic runiform script and dated from the year 754 A.D., contained the Turkic form of the name as Qasar. In two successive papers published in 1982 and 1983 respectively, I demonstrated that the form with intervocalic -s- is the original form, I showed that the verb qaz-, on which the etymology of Gombocz was based, never existed. I pointed out that the form Qasar is extant in other sources as well (the Shine usu and Tez inscriptions, Chinese, Syriac sources etc.). Finally I claimed that the name Qasar through Iranian mediation went back to a title, qasar, which is derived from the name Caesar, as are the titles Kaiser or Tsar. If the claim of Altheim (1959), more recently accepted and argued by Ludwig (1982) can be corroborated that the Khazars, or at least their leading clans came from Khorasan, the historical background for the transmission of the title is clear. his etymology also excludes the much-debated Uighur origin of the Khazars, and makes probable that the Qasar tribe



the khazars and the magyars 271
mentioned in the Chinese Tang shu (Hamilton 1955) joined the Uighurs late and came from the West. L. Bazin (1981–82) came to a somewhat diferent solution. In any case this reopened the way to the correct interpretation of the Turkic loanwords in Hungarian and many questions pertaining to the history of the Khazars.
3. The Hungarian language as a source for the history of the Khazar language and people
In the 1912 work of Gombocz we ind 227 words which he claimed were of Old Turkic, or more precisely of Bulghar Turkic origin. he list itself is of high scholarly value. Nevertheless the progress achieved in the study of the history of the Turkic languages and the history of the Hungarian language respectively in the last 90 years (the list was ready in 1908) made a thorough revision necessary. I cannot go into details here, it is enough to mention that about 20% of the suggested etymologies turned out to be wrong, and almost all of them need revision. More important is that since then the list of loanwords has been almost doubled. he handlist that is the base for a forthcoming monograph on the Old Turkic loanwords of Hungarian (see now Berta-Róna-Tas 2002) contains about 450 words. In this respect Hungarian is the most extensive source for the language of the Khazars and the Bulghars. Of the pertinent questions I will mention only the problems of the source language, chronology and semantics. here are two main candidates which could have served as the source language for the Old Turkic loanwords in Hungarian: Khazar and Onoghur-Bulghar. We see now that the question of the language of the Khazars is more complicated than was earlier thought. Not one but several languages were spoken in the Khazar Empire, but it seems to be very likely that the dominant language was an r-Turkic or Oguric language. he language of the Onoghur-Bulghars was also an r-Turkic language. In a few cases, however we can distinguish Khazar and Bulghar elements in Hungarian. he periodization of the borrowing or copying is easier to determine. It began in the 6th century and the main inlux of Old Turkic words ended around 800. It did not, however, cease. Some words may have been borrowed even in the 9th century. here are new results stemming from research on the language of the Avars who lived in the Carpathian Basin from 568 A.D. until the Conquest of the Magyars in 895. We



272 andrás róna-tas
have now new data on the language of the early Avars that indicate that they, or at least one group of them spoke an Oghuric language. In 670680 parts of the Bulghar groups joined the Avars and began to play an important role in the Avar Empire. he Franks in the irst half of the 9th century defeated the Avar Khaganate and this speeded up the slavicisation of the population. At the time of the arrival of the Hungarians, in 895, great groups of the Avars were already bilingual Turko-Slavs. It became an interesting question: did the Hungarians borrow some of their Old Turkic loanwords already in the Carpathian Basin? In a few cases we have a positive answer. he semantic range of the loanwords is very wide; words pertaining to animal husbandry, agriculture, horticulture, terms of political organisation, the terminology of social contacts, beliefs and other areas give a vivid picture of the everyday life of the Khazars and of KhazarHungarian contacts.
4. Early contacts: Khazars and Magyars from the 5th to the 7th century
When, in the 5th century A.D., the Turks appeared from the East, from the Kazakh steppe, the Hungarians lived in the southern part of the Urals and not in what is to-day Bashkiria as is claimed by some scholars. he change in their way of life was more gradual than was hitherto supposed. he change from an economy based on primitive agriculture and animal husbandry to a nomadic way of life was slow. In place of their earlier Iranian and Permian interaction, the Hungarians came into contact with new neighbours. Among them were also the ancestors, or some of the ancestors of the Khazars. At the end of the 6th or the very beginning of the 7th century the Hungarians moved southwest and occupied the place of those Bulghar groups which themselves let this region and settled in the region of the Donec—Dniestr—Bug rivers. In the Kuban—Don region the Hungarians came into contact with the Khazars who are irst mentioned around 540 in the Kârnâmag (“he Deeds of Khosraw Anôshirwân,” found in the Arabic translation of (Ibn) Miskawaih d. 1030, published by Grignaschi 1966) and in 555 in the Syriac geographical annex of the ecclesiastic history of Zakharias the Rhetor.

5. The Bulgharia of Khuvrat, its new location and its defeat by the Khazar—Magyar coalition
According to the Byzantine sources Khuvrat, the ruler of the Bulghars revolted against the Avars and proclaimed his independence in 635. Until recent times it was the common opinion (based mainly on the researches of Moravcsik 1930) that the Bulghar empire of Khuvrat was in the region of the river Kuban. his now has to be revised. he identiication of the tomb of Khuvrat with his signet-ring by Werner (1984), a new interpretation of an interpolation in the Armenian geography of Ananias of Shirak (formerly quoted as Pseudo-Movsês Khorenac’i, now edited by Hewsen 1992), a reinterpretation of the works of heophanes and Nicephorus, more precisely their common source, and an itinerary in the work of Constantine Porphyrogenitos (see Róna-Tas 2000:1–22), reveal that the Bulgharia of Khuvrat was around the Dnieper and not in the region of the Kuban river. his is of essential importance, because the history of the independent Khazar Emipre began in 670 when the Khazars, in alliance with the Hungarians, defeated the Bulghars. One group of the Bulghars moved to the Lower Danube and founded Danubian Bulgharia; another group found shelter among the Avars in the Carpathian Basin. Small groups appear in Dalmatia and even in Italy. One group under Bat Bayan withdrew to the north and slowly began to move to the northeast. heir descendants will appear later as the Volga Bulghars.
6. The migration of the Magyars from the Kuban region to the Dnieper—Danube region or Etelköz: end of the 7th century
he power of the Khazar Empire extended to the West ater the defeat of the Bulghars. It reached the Crimean Peninsula and in a more or less tight way spread over the whole Pontic steppe. It had to be the political decision of the Khazar rulers that the Hungarians should move to the region evacuated by the Bulghars. he Hungarians slowly occupied the territory between the Dnieper and the Lower Danube. his is the land which was called by the Hungarians Etelküzü (“Mesopotamia”) and which has been thoroughly described later by Constantine Porphyrogenitus. At the end of the 7th century the Hungarians defended the western borders of the Khazar Empire. he question of Levedia and Etelküzü produced a lively discussion in the Hungarian literature. Now



274 andrás róna-tas
it is clear that we have to abandon the idea that Levedia was a place separate from Etelküzü. It was the headquarters of the Levedi-clan in the eastern part of Etelküzü, while the Almush-clan, the ancestors of the later Hungarian royal family, ruled over the western part.
7. Khazar—Magyar political relations in the 8th–9th century
During the irst period of the life of the Hungarians in Etelküzü their relations with the Khazars was very close. Among other things this was relected by the fact that the Hungarian chietain was given a Khazarian wife. he very close connections can also be seen in the mirror of the Khazar loanwords of the Hungarian language. About 800 A.D. the situation changed. hree rebellious Khazar tribes called the Khabars or Khavars let the Khazars and joined the Hungarian tribal confederation. If the Hungarians had been under heavy Khazar rule, it would have not made any sense to seek refuge among them. On the other hand it is certain that the Hungarians were not totally independent of the Khazars. A totally independent ruler on the steppe took the title khagan, and this was not the case with the Hungarians. In the De administrando imperio of Constantine Porphyrogenitus we come across an interesting story. It is related that sometime earlier the Khazar ruler wanted to promote Levedi, a Hungarian chietain to become the irst arkhon among the Hungarians. Levedi however refused the dignity and suggested ofering it to the head of another clan, Almush or his son Árpád. his happened, and Árpád was selected and elected. his story, recorded from Hungarian visitors in Constantinople, was, for a long time, accepted at face value. I think, however, that this story is garbled. he Levedi clan, loyal to the Khazars was put aside, and the Almush clan took over as the leading power. his was presented as the “generosity” of Levedi. Nevertheless, the Khazar ruler formally recognized the change of power. he relationship between the Hungarians and Khazars in the 9th century was very similar to that of the relation between the Volga Bulghar ruler and the Khazars in the 10th century. Ater 800, Khazar sovereignty over the Hungarians was only formal.

8. The role of the Khazar Empire in the formation of the Magyar tribal confederation: the Khavars. Did there exist a sacral kingship among the Magyars?
In the irst period, until about 800, Hungarian political organisation was essentially inluenced by Khazar rule. Ater 800 the three newcomer Khavar tribes were united into one tribe and integrated as the eighth tribe into the union of the seven Hungarian tribes. he Khavars played an important role in the confederation. In about 842 the fortress of Sharkel was built most probably against the Hungarians. In 862 western sources already mention the incursion of the Hungarians into the territory of the Frankish Empire. Similar raids are known from the years 881, 892 and 894. Although the Khavars (cowari) are mentioned in the western annals only once (881, the Annals of Salzburg), it is almost certain that the Khavars played an important role in all of them. here exists a famous description of the Hungarians from the years around 870. Most probably it was a part of the second work of Ibn Khurdâdhbih (written about 885–886) but taken over by al-Jayhânî (worked between 913–941). his report has been transmitted to us in some of the later works, such as those of Ibn Rustah (writing in Arabic) and of the Persian author Gardêzî. According to this report, the Hungarians had a nominal ruler whose title was künde and an acting ruler, whom they obeyed in war and other matters: the jila. his system changed during the time of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Árpád became the ruler, he became künde and he was the acting ruler at the same time. Second to him was the jila and third in rank was the karkha. What transpired was similar to what took place with the coming to power of the the Carolingian dynasty. he major domo or the commander in chief took control. here is no trace of any sacral kingship among the Hungarians. Some scholars (following K. Czeglédy 1966, 1974) have claimed that the institution of sacral kingship existed among the Hungarians and was modelled on that of the Khazars. his cannot be maintained.
9. Khazars, Pechenegs and Magyars: the Magyar Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895
In 894, the Hungarians defeated the Danubian Bulghars. In the same year the Pechenegs, beaten by the Oguz, crossed the Volga and tried to break into Khazaria. his did not succeed. In 895, the Danube Bulghars



276 andrás róna-tas
and the Pechenegs in a pincer operation defeated the Hungarians who let Etelküzü and occupied the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin. he Pechenegs occupied the Pontic steppe from the Don river to the Lower Danube. his changed the balance of power around Khazaria.
10. Khazar—Magyar contacts in the 10th century: the correspondence of Hasdai ben Shaprût and King Joseph
Did the Hungarians have any contact with the Khazars ater the Conquest of 895? Some sources describe these contacts, which were of a commercial character. Byzantine sources relate that the Hungarians sent commercial envoys to the East, certainly to the Khazars and to those Hungarians who moved with the Bulghars to the Volga—Kama region. A group of Khwarezmians, who played an important role in the life of Khazaria in the 10th century, was also at home in Hungary. Hungarian sources record them as Khaliz. In the famous letter of Hasdai ben Shaprût to the Khazar king Joseph we read that the letter was to be sent through Jews who live in the country of the Hungrin i.e. the Hungarians. hey forwarded the letter through Rûs and Bulghâr to the king of the Khazars.
11. Summary
he histories of the Hungarians and the Khazars are strongly interrelated. Linguistic sources are more ample on the Hungarian side until the end of the 9th century, from the second half of the 9th century also written sources help us to reconstruct Khazar-Hungarian relations. Nevertheless there are more open than solved questions, and the solution can be achieved only through a more thorough co-operation.

THE KHAZAR MOTIF IN JUDAH HALEVI’S SEFER HA-KUZARI
Eliezer Schweid
Judah Halevi’s fascinating book, beloved of both scholars and laymen, may well have been the main source of the myth of the Jewish Khazars and its persistence from the twelth century to the present.1 It is only natural, therefore, that a collection of articles devoted to the Khazars should include a discussion of this motif in a book popularly named for the Khazar king. However, it should be pointed out at the start that Judah Halevi himself did not intend to develop that motif. On the contrary: for his own polemical purposes, he needed a story that had already been popularized as a historical fact. Indeed, Judah Halevi’s work originally had the rather unpoetic but apt title, Kitâb al-hujja wa’l-dalîl i nasr al-dîn al-dhalîl (“Book of Argument and Demonstration in Aid of the Despised Faith”).2 Moreover, he openly used the conversion of the Khazar king and his people merely as a calculated literary device. Judah Halevi learned the art of the philosophical dialogue, creating a didactic weave of dramatic plot and philosophical deliberation, from Plato.3 Readers were told in advance that the “scholar” of the dialogue was a literary label for the author, and that, similarly, the King of the Khazars was essentially a literary representation of the active reader whom the author aims to convince. On the other hand, in the opening passage of the literary framework, Judah Halevi states his reliance on “something I had once heard concerning the arguments of a Rabbi who sojourned with the King of the Khazars . . . about four hundred years ago.”4 He adds, moreover, further conirmation of his story, saying that, according to “historical records,”

the King of the Khazars had become a convert to Judaism ater consulting with three wise men—a Christian, a Muslim, and a Jew. It seems plausible that he made use of the letter from the Khazar king to R. Hasdai ibn Shaprut, which at the time made a tremendous impression on Spanish Jewish communities. However, prior to all these remarks, Judah Halevi explicitly declares that he had been inspired to write his book by a topical challenge: “I was asked to state what arguments and replies I could bring to bear against the attacks of philosophers and followers of other religions, and also against [Jewish] sectarians who attacked the rest of Israel.”5 Given this declaration, the rather casual, obscure continuation, “his reminded me of something I had once heard concerning the arguments of a Rabbi,”6 has an obvious meaning: it tells the reader that the story is a literary device. For a reason to be clariied presently, Halevi preferred to formulate his answers to the pressing questions that he had been asked, as if they were the very answers that had convinced the King of the Khazars to convert to Judaism some four hundred years before. Halevi goes on to tell the story of the Khazar king and his conversion, but in a version adapted to his own needs: he king, described as a devout adherent of the Khazar religion, has a dream in which an angel appears to him. he apparition, portrayed as the king’s reward for his religious devotion, is supposed to enhance his faith: he is told that, while his “intentions are acceptable,” his actions are not. he king has the same dream three times, indicating that it was truly a prophetic dream. Understanding that he must determine which religion teaches the true path of worship, he calls irst on a philosopher and, later, on three religious scholars, one ater the other.7 he literary details of the story reveal its precise, sophisticated features, cleverly designed to base the scholar’s arguments on a irm foundation of direct religious experience—for without prior experience those arguments will not stand up to philosophical criticism, as I shall show below. Now why did Judah Halevi prefer the story of the Khazar king to, say, a direct confrontation between a Jewish scholar, on the one hand, and his contemporary counterparts—a philosopher, a Christian, a Muslim, and a Karaite—in order to protect his Jewish readers (he was clearly thinking

of them alone) against scornful attacks on their faith? In answer, I would point out, irst, that for Judah Halevi, the story of the conversion of the Khazar king, inspired by a prophetic dream and a profound discussion with representatives of the diferent religions, was an incontrovertible historical fact. Second, just as he saw the king’s prior religious experience as a vital element in the Jewish scholar’s persuasive eforts, he considered the historicity of the conversion story as an indispensable tool in convincing his Jewish readers of the validity of his arguments. To understand this assertion, one must consider the historical background of the interfaith polemic to which Judah Halevi was referring: power struggles between Christianity and Islam over the control of the Land of Israel, on the one hand, and of the Iberian Peninsula, on the other. hese military and political power struggles played a decisive role in the aggressive confrontation between the two religions as they strove to expand their spheres of inluence: Both Christians and Muslims saw in their own successes, coupled with their antagonists’ defeat, clear proof of the truth of their faith, of the fact that God was ighting on their side; and both Christians and Muslims considered humiliation of the Jews—stubborn claimants for the title of the chosen people, holding fast to the Mosaic faith as the only true one—as palpable proof that God had abandoned his former nation to their fate. his argument undoubtedly had its efect on many Jews. he long, diicult exile began to undermine their faith; under such circumstances, the conversion to Judaism of a great, successful king like the King of Khazars, together with his whole nation, could be seen by the Jewish reader as demonstrating that, contrary to their enemies’ claims, God had not deserted them in the historical conlict over the truth of their religion.8 It is worth considering Judah Halevi’s use of the historicity of the Khazar story for his apologetic needs. A more simplistic historical approach would have simply pointed to the factuality of the event to prove that, despite the Exile, God had not forsaken his people, and that four hundred years previously the Jewish religion had enjoyed a highly signiicant success, on a par with the profane victories of Christianity and Islam. As Halevi was perfectly well aware, the mere fact that a nation of idolaters had converted to Judaism and thereupon prospered could not explain

religions were convincing, unlike those of the Jews (ibid., p. 34).

the wretched condition of the Jewish people, whose condition in Exile was not afected by that event. he Khazars’ conversion and their political triumphs had not altered the situation of the Jews themselves. he way in which Judah Halevi tells the story of the Khazars’ conversion is worthy of attention in this connection. First, throughout the text of Part I, which describes the Jewish scholar’s eforts to convince the king of the truth of Judaism, he also tries to prove two crucial statements: First, the Jewish religion is the only one intended from its very inception for the entire human race (hence also for the Khazars); it was passed down from one generation to the next, irst by selected individuals, then by a selected family, and later by the entire chosen people, and it was destined, in a perhaps not very distant future, to be accepted by all the nations. Second, only in the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, only in the Land of Israel, and only in the holy tongue, Hebrew, could the supreme virtue achieved through observance of the precepts of the Torah—the unique, immediate, proximity to God—be revealed. he King of the Khazars is thus informed that he must indeed undertake to observe the one faith originally intended for all nations, including his own, and study it in accordance with the testimony of the Jews; but even when he does so, he will never achieve the level of the descendants of the patriarchs, and will surely not be able to observe in his own kingdom those ritual precepts that depend on the land of Israel—though these precepts are, as the scholar tells him, the major means of achieving proximity to God. his statement indeed annoys the king when he hears it for the irst time;9 the scholar, unabashed, explains that the Jewish nation is unique for its super-human quality of possessing the “Divine essence” (Arabic: al-’amr al-’ilāhi), just as the human race is superior to all other living creatures in its possession of the “intelligent essence.” Hence, just as no animal can become a human, members of other nations cannot become Jews in the full sense of the word, even if they accept the Torah and undertake to observe all the precepts that can be observed outside the Land of Israel.10 he king understands all this and accepts the situation; this is the basis for the next stages of the story of the Khazar conversion, as recounted in the opening section of Book 2:
9 Ibid. 12 (p. 39).
10 his is essentially the substance of the irst and second parts of Sefer ha-Kuzari,
beginning in the middle of Part I, ibid., pp. 51–118.



the khazar motif in judah halevi’s SEFER HA-KUZARI 283
Ater this the Khazari, as is related in the history of the Khazars, was anxious to reveal to his vizier in the mountains of Warsan the secret of his dream and its repetition, in which he was urged to seek the God-pleasing deed. he king and his vizier travelled to the deserted mountains on the sea shore, and arrived one night at a cave in which some Jews used to celebrate the Sabbath. hey disclosed their identity to them, embraced their religion, were circumcised in the cave, and then returned to their country, eager to learn the Jewish law. hey kept their conversion secret, however, until they found an opportunity of disclosing the fact gradually to a few of their special friends. When the number had increased, they made the afair public, and induced the rest of the Khazars to embrace the Jewish faith. hey sent to various countries for scholars and books, and studied the Torah. heir chronicles also tell of their prosperity, how they beat their foes, conquered their lands, secured great treasures; how their army swelled to hundreds of thousands, how they loved their faith, and fostered such love for the Holy House that they erected a Tabernacle in the shape of that built by Moses. hey also honored and cherished those born Israelites who lived among them.11
A striking point in this passage is Judah Halevi’s reference to the “Chronicles of the Khazars,” explicitly and emphatically placing the entire event in the context of Khazar, not Jewish, history. his is brought out in four ways: (i) he Jewish scholar has no part in the king’s conversion to Judaism or that of his people. Ater the conversion, the scholar continues to act as the king’s private tutor, but no more. (ii) he direct motive for the conversion is the second apparition of the angel to the Khazar king—a deining revelation for him and his people, which he obeys. (iii) he king and his vizier embrace the Jewish religion on their own initiative, and on their own responsibility; there is no imposed act of conversion in the sense of becoming part of the Jewish nation. he same holds true for the gradual conversion of all the Khazars. (iv) Even ater embracing the Jewish religion, the Khazars do not consider themselves as Jews; and vice versa, the Jews involved in the story do not consider them as such. he Khazars indeed consider themselves fortunate to have Jews living among them, and they build themselves a model of the Sanctuary that Moses built in the wilderness (but not of the Temple in Jerusalem!). he Jews agree to teach the Khazars Torah, but the two nations still consider themselves as separate entities, of diferent origins, homelands, and languages, with all that entails, including the question of the quality and level of their religious faith.
11 Part II, 1 (p. 72).

It is clear, at any rate, that Judah Halevi does not see the Khazar people’s legendary military successes and riches as evidence of the Jewish people’s material superiority; they in no way render Judaism more competitive in relation to Christianity and Islam, as far as earthly achievements are concerned. Neither can these successes compensate the Jews for their sufering; perhaps the very opposite: A Christian or Muslim debater might have argued that if the story, as told by Judah Halevi, were true, it would constitute a third historical proof that the ancient status of a Divinely chosen people had been transferred to a diferent nation! Judah Halevi was thus aware of the trap and took care not to fall into it. On the contrary, from the very start he rejects the argument that earthly successes, such as military victories and political dominion, which stem from natural causes, unrelated to questions of religious faith and truth, may prove the justice of any religion. On the contrary, he believes that the very sufering of the Jews in Exile is the proof that their religion is the true faith, and that they are indeed worthy of their election.12 In this context, the proof in Judaism’s favor is not the existence of a lourishing kingdom that embraced the Jewish religion, but the fact that, despite the apparent superiority of the Christian and Muslim scholars, as representatives of ruling religions, and despite the Jews’ wretched condition in Exile, this successful king preferred the “despised faith,” having been convinced of its exclusive truth. But Judah Halevi’s concern with the historicity of the event goes still farther. Examining how his arguments continue, one realizes that, ultimately, he also intended to highlight the achievements of the Jewish religion in its eforts to gain acceptance among the nations of the world, competing in this regard with Christianity and Islam despite their considerable material advantages. Paradoxically, the argument continues, the earthly power of Christianity and Islam constitutes a weakness, while the earthly weakness of Judaism is its power. his implication of the “Khazar motif ” clearly emerges from Judah Halevi’s view of history and of God’s place and leadership in history—especially with regard to the role played by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in spreading the Jewish religion throughout humanity. While Judah Halevi admits that the exile was a punishment for Israel’s sins, it was also the channel through which Divine Providence announced the Kingdom of Heaven to humanity as a

whole. Christianity and Islam perform this function as well, albeit unintentionally; for in their claim to displace the chosen people, by falsely imitating the latter’s laws, they prepare idolatrous peoples for recognition of the truth in the original faith, the foundation of their own.13 Looking at history from this angle, it is clear that Judah Halevi was also not indiferent to the status of the diferent religions in the world of the present. He was convinced that, ultimately, all the nations would recognize Israel as the chosen people, whose laws were Divine laws and whose God was the true God; for, as the prophet declared, “Out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,” and everything that happens in Jewish history, and in history in general, is designed to achieve that goal. he goal will not be achieved by physical power and coercion, but by all nations’ recognition and acceptance of the truth. In addition, the story at the end of the book, according to which the scholar immigrates to the Land of Israel14—an obvious allusion to the identity of the scholar and the author—proves that Judah Halevi expected the triumph of his people and his religion in the great historical struggle between nations and religions. he Kingdom of God would soon be revealed to the nations, and the advent of redemption was dependent solely on the Jews’ performance of their role. Loyal to the Torah and its ultimate goal, they would rise up and, on their own initiative, return to their ancestral land in order to observe the special precepts that could not be observed elsewhere; they would not abandon the land to the devastation and ruin caused by the nations’ struggle for its domination. For Judah Halevi, the opportunity was there: If the Jews emulated the Christians’ and Muslims’ eforts to dominate the Holy Land—unlike them, not by military conquest but by coming there, settling the land, and observing the precepts that could not be observed elsewhere—the messianic kingdom would be proclaimed, and the superiority of the Jews and of Judaism would be exhibited for all to see. It follows, therefore, that Judah Halevi also considered the Khazar king’s and nation’s conversion to Judaism as proof that the victory of the true religion over its rivals was imminent—not by force and coercion ater the manner of the Christians and the Muslims, but by persuasive

means, based on the testimony of the Torah itself and of the nation that observed its precepts. his seems to represent the full import of the “Khazar motif ” in Sefer ha-Kuzari from the standpoint of its attitude to contemporary history. In what follows, I would like briely to analyze the book’s mode of thought and dialogic art, with a view to examining the signiicance of the motif from a literary and theoretical standpoint.15
he irst obvious step in that direction is to complete our discussion of Judah Halevi’s reasons for presenting his arguments in defense of the despised faith as a discourse between the scholar and the King of the Khazars, rather than a direct polemical dialogue between scholars of the respective religions and between them and the philosopher. Clearly, apart from the polemical advantage gained by describing the scholar’s success and his triumph over the representatives of the other religions, Judah Halevi attached importance to the dialogic situation created by his chosen narrative frame—a situation that he considered ideal for the achievement of his educational aims. In this context, attention should be drawn to two mutually complementary considerations. First, Judah Halevi was not interested in providing a literary arena for his opponents’ arguments, beyond the minimum necessary space given them at the beginning of the book. Neither, for that matter, was he interested in trying to convince them; he knew very well that there was no chance of that. He was writing for his coreligionists only. He was intent on convincing them in order to encourage them, resolve their doubts, and persuade them to immigrate to their homeland. To that end, he would have to inform—or remind—his Jewish readers of things that they should have known as well as he; to re-instruct them in the truth of their own Torah and the truth of the revelatory experiences of their faith. his in turn required throwing new light on traditional religious truth, illuminating the cultural and historical condition that was the root of their aliction and their doubts. An ideal educational and literary tool to that efect was the presentation of the Jewish religion to an outsider, who would be learning that truth for the irst time with the positive intention of properly understanding it, but nevertheless in a completely objective manner.
15 For a detailed analysis of the structure of the dialogue in Sefer ha-Kuzari and its relationship with Judah Halevi’s apologetic methods see my article, “he Art of Dialogue
in Sefer ha-Kuzari and Its heoretical Signiicance” (Hebrew), in Eliezer Schweid, Feel
ing and Speculation (Hebrew; Ramat-Gan, 1970), pp. 37–80.



the khazar motif in judah halevi’s SEFER HA-KUZARI 287
Second, a major problem in any apologetic argument with representatives of opposing religions is to ind a conceptual common denominator, on the basis of which the disputants can present their arguments with a view to “winning,” that is, to convincing one another of the justice of their claims. Put diferently, how can it be decided objectively which of the disputants has proved his case? Medieval religious and interreligious debates were able to invoke such a common denominator—the universal substrate of the civilization of which all three religions were a part, namely, the scientiic-philosophical substrate. Even theologians who denied the legitimacy of applying philosophical considerations to revelatory religion employed the language of philosophy in their attempts to reject theological arguments of other faiths or other divisions within their own faith; this was particularly true of Jewish theologians drawn into enforced polemics. he result, however, was that they were obliged to admit the superiority of philosophy over theology, thus falling into a trap of their own making, since the polemic between the various religions and philosophy was no less critical than interfaith polemics. Judah Halevi’s fascinatingly sophisticated approach to apologetics is particularly evident in this respect. He too makes use of the rational, objective, language of philosophy in order to validate (or invalidate) the arguments of revelatory religion; however, while at the empirical, scientiic level he accepts the validity of the philosophical argument, at the polemical level he treats the philosopher as a metaphysician. hus the philosopher, required to justify his own attitude to revelation, can no longer play an adjudicatory role in relation to religion itself. Who, then, would be the judge? Judah Halevi’s simple solution was to appoint his readers as judges, mobilizing their intellectual and experiential resources for the purpose; as a skilled educator, he knew how to point his readers toward these resources and guide their application of them. his was precisely the pedagogical role assigned to the Khazar king—a model pupil, as a counterpart to the model teacher—the scholar. All the king’s qualities as portrayed in the text contribute to that goal. His claim to objectivity is based not on the philosophy as a metaphysical discipline, but only on his commonsense and intellectual honesty, his critical attitude to both his own and other’s arguments. But it is also based on the fact that the king was not originally a party to the dispute and entered into it only because of his own personal motivation—to determine which of the representatives of the three religions could legitimate his reliance on revelation. Above all, the king represents the kind of people who, though not educated in a revelatory religion, possess by



288 eliezer schweid
virtue of their motivation the experiential and intellectual tools necessary to distinguish a valid religious argument, rooted in a true revelation, from an invalid argument, invoking a false revelation. hus, the Khazar king—an objective judge, profoundly motivated by his dream to discover religious truth—is the ideal educational solution. his becomes evident upon studying the way in which Judah Halevi shaped the man’s character against the background of his imaginary biography: a talented, successful king, that is, a person conversant with profane matters, practical and experienced, eminently sensible and capable of objective judgment. He is moreover a believer, a pious person with high moral principles, and, above all, intellectually honest, with a critical attitude even to himself, driven by his desire to discover the truth. In sum, the Khazar king is portrayed from the start as an objective party, a seeker of truth for its own sake. He is not educationally disposed toward Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or philosophy. He indeed entertains certain prejudices or, more precisely, is inclined to such prejudices, which irst come to light when he summons the philosopher as his irst discussant, despite the fact that the angel in his dream speciically commanded him to consult religious scholars. His prejudices are featured again when he decides not to consult a Jewish scholar, in view of their inferior condition in comparison with Christians and Muslims. hese are clearly typical prejudices of a king, anchored in secular knowledge. On the other hand, they are natural errors of judgment, based on a rationally critical attitude. Indeed, it is the king’s rationality that inspires him irst to turn to the philosopher for criteria with which to evaluate religions, and his rationality is behind his view that the Jews’ lowly state implies the inferiority of their religion. Nevertheless, he is clearly not prejudiced in relation to philosophy per se or the religions themselves, since up to that time he had taken no interest in them and knew nothing about them. All this, however, was not suicient in Judah Halevi’s view to empower the Khazar king to judge issues of faith and ritual. He could not evaluate the truth of a revelatory religion unless he himself had previously experienced some kind of religious revelation, which had in fact driven him to investigate questions relating to human worship of God. his, of course, explains the device of the king’s prophetic dream. he king’s motivation for his inquiry into religious truth is rooted not in scientiic curiosity, but in a fervent religious sense, which is rewarded by a prophetic revelation—not actual prophecy, for that was the perquisite of the Jews in their own land when the Temple was still standing.



the khazar motif in judah halevi’s SEFER HA-KUZARI 289
In sum: it was this combination of attributes that gives the king the ability—and authority—for a critical evaluation of philosophy and the religions, and subsequently of the individual religions, while diligently seeking to learn the truth to be learnt from each; for there is some measure of truth in each of philosophy, Christianity, and Islam, and it is the combination of their respective truths that inally leads the king to the truth of their source and fount, namely, the Jewish Torah. he qualities with which Judah Halevi endowed the Khazar king shape, therefore, not only the literary framework in its endeavor to illuminate the depths of the Jewish faith and its signiicance for humanity, but also the lively, dialogic nature of the text, which is quite rare in medieval dialogic literature. He has created a real drama, with all the tension of a real-life debate and argument. he king’s qualities relect not only diferent aspects of religious truth, but also personal traits and life experiences of a variety of religious personalities. While these qualities are particularly evident in the irst sections of Part I, they are present throughout the book. In fact, it is the king’s character that has attracted readers to this literary masterpiece down to the present time—a lively, inely drawn igure, but nevertheless open, evolving, and maturing, both as a monarch and as a believer.16 It is readily seen that the qualities of the Khazar king in Sefer haKuzari originated in Judah Halevi’s own personality. At the beginning of this article I noted that the Scholar is the author’s literary counterpart; we may now argue that the Khazar king also represents an important side of Judah Halevi’s character. he two igures complement one another as they evolve side by side, for by the time the book ends, the reader realizes that, just as the king has learnt from the Scholar, the latter has learnt from the king. he king, through his integrity and consistency, has essentially led the Scholar to his own decision to draw the logical conclusions from his own teachings and immigrate to the Land of Israel. hus, while teaching his royal pupil the essentials of his faith, the Scholar has taught himself, through his pupil, to understand the profound implications of his commitment to practical observance of the Torah.17 Of course, Judah Halevi’s intention in the brilliant literary portrayal of his protagonists and shaping of the plot was not a personal one. he
16 For a detailed analysis see my article cited in n. 15. 17 See the concluding section of the book (above, n. 14).

two characters, king and Scholar, were designed as models for his Jewish readers, whose doubts and questions had inspired him to write the work. His readers were to identify with both partners to the debate: Like the Khazar king, they should remember the prophetic “dream” that every Jew may have by virtue of his inherent prophetic abilities. his would help them, having been reared and educated as members of the Jewish nation, to mobilize all the resources of their intellect and their personal and historical experience, and thereby to revitalize their weakened belief in revelation. Ultimately, they would draw the inevitable conclusion reached by the Scholar ater he had successfully brought his pupil to the level of his own religious persona at the start of their dialogue: hey would set out for their own homeland, there to be redeemed. In sum: Judah Halevi created the characters of the Khazar king and the Jewish Scholar in Sefer ha-Kuzari as a representative model of the educational process necessary to shape a good Jew, a Jew capable of openly and critically facing the vicissitudes of his own time, overcoming them, and emerging from them as a sincere believer. Sefer ha-Kuzari thus expresses the absorption of the Khazar myth into the Jews’ selfawareness.

IRANIAN SOURCES ON THE KHAZARS
Dan D.Y. Shapira
1.0 In the following, three groups of sources dealing with Khazar history are surveyed. What is common to these sources is their Iranian provenance. he sources can be divided into three groups according to the three languages in which they are recorded: Middle Persian (or Pahlavi); Arabic; New Persian. his division relects not only the language of the texts, but also, to some extent, their historical value as sources belonging to a certain cultural and temporal milieu. Some of the sources in Arabic are supposed to relect Pahlavi originals now lost, while those in New Persian, in almost all cases, go back to Arabic originals (some of them being reworking of older Pahlavi material). here are sources in other Iranian languages, such as Sogdian or Saka-Khotanese, but they contain data on Ancient Turks and have no direct bearing on Khazar studies in the strict sense.
1.1 he Khazars are still believed by some scholars to have appeared on the historical stage irst in the last decades of the Sasanian dynasty in Persia, as an ally of Iran’s foes.1 Shortly ater Heraclius delivered a mortal blow to Iran, new enemies sprang up from the Arabian desert and conquered Iran within a few years. Zoroastrian Iran thus ceased to exist, and a new period in the long history of this country began, a period which is characterized by an adaptation of Islam to the patterns of Iranian civilization, and by a profound Iranization of Islam as a whole. he irst centuries of Islamic rule in Iran brought about interesting developments in pre-Islamic Iranian literary traditions, developments which are generally seen within the framework of the Šu ūbīya trends; we still cannot appreciate with precision the very complicated mechanism of these cultural changes, but in a schematized way, they can be described as a double-track development: on the one hand, absorption of Iranian

traditions into the so-called “Islamic lore”, i.e., into the newly-emerging civilization united by Arabic language, Arabic script, and, to some extent, by Islam; on the other hand, there was a parallel development, namely, reshaping and consolidation of pre-Islamic Iranian traditions within the community of faithful Zoroastrian believers, which became, in the course of time, an oppressed minority in their own country.
1.2 It should be stressed that historical and geographical lore preserved in the traditional literary language of Sasanian Iran, Middle Persian, was recorded in the form which came down to us only during the irst Islamic centuries; we may be quite certain that during the irst formative centuries of Islamic rule, Zoroastrians formulated anew their self-awareness, so the historical and geographical material of our extant Pahlavi sources, though valuable, should be treated with caution.2
1.3 he same applies also to the “Sasanian” material preserved in Arabic sources; though authors writing in Arabic possessed an impressive body of information about pre-Islamic Iran, most of which is generally held to go back to the Sasanian Book of Kings (being thus translated into Arabic3 in the early Islamic Period), it should be nevertheless remembered that the date, origin and authenticity of such material should be closely scrutinized in each case separately.
1.4 As to the sources in New Persian, they are much later than those in Arabic, and as a rule, they rework earlier Arabic material.
2.1 To the irst group of our sources, those in Zoroastrian Middle Persian, belong a few interesting pieces of information. his is how Ayādgār ī Jāmāspīg (12.8–9,15),4 a composition of (partly) geographical character, describes Turkestān:
Turkestān wuzurg gyāg ud hamāg sard, wēšag bawēd, u-šān draxt ī barwar ud mēwag ī xvarišnīg ud *any ciš nihang. hast az awēšān kē Māh

“Turkestān is a vast place and all of it is cold, it is forests, they have few fruit-trees and edible fruits and [other edible] things. here are some among them who worship the Moon and there are some who are sorcerers, and there are some who are of the Good Religion. . . . hey till the land. When they die, they throw (their dead) in forests, and there are some who go to Paradise, and there are some who go to Hell and the Middle Abode (Purgatory).”5
he reader of the descriptions of the Turkic peoples made by Muslim geographers, e.g., by Gardīzī6 or Marwāzī,7 would ind these passages familiar. I think it is clear from this Zoroastrian description that neither Eastern Turkestan is meant, nor the Khazar possessions on the lower course of the Volga, or Don, or in the Northern Caucasus. hough in the classical Pahlavi passages the term “Turkestan” does refer to the land of the Uigurs, here it applies rather to a country in the steppe-forest areas, probably in the present-day Tatarstan/Bašqortostan. he term “Turk” seems to me to be used here not in its generic meaning, but as a general term for the northern semi-nomads, perhaps similar to its application by some Muslim and Byzantine sources to the [proto-] Magyars. he reference to forests and corpse-exposure to reminiscent of the description of the Volga tribes by Ibn Fadlān;8 the people living in “Turkestan” as described here were certainly not Muslims yet, and the reference to the “Good Religion” (which is Pahlavi for Zoroastrianism) as confessed by some “Turks” needs to be explained: in numerous Arabic and Muslim New-Persian texts, the term “majūsī” does mean not “Zoroastrian,” but

rather “dualist,” thus frequently Manichaean, or merely “ire-worshipper,” and some Turkic peoples, like the Patzinaks (Pechenegs), are said to be “majūsī;” in the sense of “ire-worshipper” the term was applied, e.g., to the Rus’, because of their funeral rites. We have an example of such a reference to Khazars, too: ca. 1094, the Spaniard al-Bakrī, the older contemporary of Judah Halevi, noted that the king of the Khazars was previously a “majūsī;”9 I do not think that in that last case the word means anything else but “pagan,” certainly not “Zoroastrian.”10 So, as to our Pahlavi passage, we should assume that the Zoroastrian compiler drew upon a Muslim text in which he found “majūsī,” used by the Muslim author in the sense of “pagan,” but our compiler erroneously interpreted it as “of the Good Religion,” i.e., belonging to his own Zoroastrian community.
2.2 Another example of a post-Sasanian Zoroastrian passage in Pahlavi drawing upon Muslim sources was published by de Menasce,11 and Peter Golden12 called attention to it for Khazar studies:
. . . čiyōn kēš ī Yīšō ī az Hrōm ud hān ī Mōšē az-iz Xazarān ud hān ī Mānī az-iz Turkestān tagīgīh ud čērīh īšān pēš būd bē burd ō wadagīh ud ōbastagīh andar hamahlān abgand, hān ī Mānī az Hrōm ilsō[k]fāyīh-iz anāt,13

into vileness and decadence amongst their rivals, and the faith of Mani even frustrated the Byzantine philosophy.”
Golden correctly observed that this passage is one of the few of the non-Muslim sources to make note of Khazar Judaism. However, this Zoroastrian passage can be approximately dated: it states that the result of the adoption of Judaism and Manichaeism by Khazars and Uigurs was the cause of the decadence of their countries, and thus this passage was recorded ater both Jewish Khazar and Manichaean Uigur Qaganates were weakened or even destroyed, i.e., about the second half of the tenth century.14 In addition, it is unlikely that this Zoroastrian testimony of the Khazar Judaism is irst-hand;15 it was rather channeled through Muslim literature, and in this case, this is, indeed, a valuable piece of evidence for the Zoroastrian-Muslim literary intercourse in Iranian lands (but nothing more). Zoroastrian interest in states where Judaism and Manichaeism were professed is understandable against the Zoroastrian religious background, as Manichaeism was a religion seen by Zoroastrians as an abominable distortion of their own teaching, a form of Iranian heresy par excellence, and Judaism represented for them those destructive Monotheistic teachings which had resulted in Christianity and, especially, in Islam.16
14 he Uigur Qagan was converted in 762; in 840, the Uigurs were defeated by the
Qirghiz, but Manichaeism remained the religion of the royal court in Khocho well until
the middle of the tenth century, when it was gradually replaced by Buddhism. he Impe
rial Turks, or Qaraxanids, converted to Islam ca. 960. It was not infrequently noted by
various scholars that the dates of adoption of Judaism and Manichaeism by, respectively,
Khazars and Uigurs, and the dates of the fall of their Qaganates are fairly close to each
other. However, only the second part of this statement holds water. Cf. now D.D.Y. Shap

15 We do have, however, an attestation of an interesting encounter in the former land
of the Khazars between a Zoroastrian and a Jew (the Karaite collector, A. Firkowicz,
(wrongly) claimed to be responsible for the creation of the so-called “Khazar theory”).

2.3 here is a passage in the Middle Persian apocalyptic work entitled Zand ī Wahman Yašt (or Zand ī Wahman Yasn, henceforth ZWY)17 4.58, in which the name of Khazars was supposed to occur in a list of foreign nations who sought to destroy Iran. his passage describes the period which can be approximately dated as relecting the events associated with the activities of Wahrām ī Čōbēn, the famous Sasanian general, who in 588 (or 589?) crossed the Oxus and killed the Turkic king; ater his victory, Wahrām was sent by Hurmizd IV to the Caucasus to repel the invading nomads, sometimes identiied by much later sources with Khazars. his presumably Khazar invasion was taken as having been referred to already in the Xvadāy Nāmag, the Sasanian “Book of Kings.”18 Wahrām ī Čōbēn was successful at his mission and opened hostilities against the Byzantines in Georgia.19 But when, ater his defeat on the banks of the Araxes, Hurmizd IV decided to remove him, then Wahrām answered with a revolt, usurped the throne and became, for a short period of time, the King of Kings (590–591); in the civil war which followed, neighbors of Iran took vital part. his is the short epoch when wars were waged almost simultaneously with Turks, Byzantines, (still pagan and Christian) Arabs and other peoples.20 he reference to “Khazars” must nevertheless be regarded as an anachronism, for it seems that no Khazars were yet around to invade Iran. As to our problematic word in ZWY 4.58, two diferent emendations of it were suggested by Bailey: one, to HPTL, “Hephthalites”,21 another,

to HĞL, “Khazars”.22 Later, this view was modiied by Henning and by Bailey himself,23 and the most recent editor of ZWY, Carlo Cereti, read the word in question Xadur,24 which stands, as he thinks, for Khazars, though he seems not to be aware of the chronological problem involved in a reference to Khazars in the end of the 6th century.25 It is known that the interpretation of graphical forms of Pahlavi words poses much diiculty. I do not exclude the possibility that the word in question in ZWY is indeed “Khazar.” However, there are examples of Pahlavi historical and pseudo-historical writings which contain passages that could be dated with precision. In most cases the dates relect knowledge of the events of the last great Byzantine-Sasanian war,26 one of the episodes of which was a real Western Türkic invasion (later ascribed to the Khazars), and the developments which followed it, i.e., several decades ater the date of our ZWY passage. So, it could be argued with plausibility that our problematic *“Khazars”-word was inserted back into the text of the Xvadāy Nāmag anachronistically, at the latest stages of the redaction of the text in the last decades of the existence of the Sasanian Empire (or even later), referring thus to the events under Husraw I Anōšurwān (531–579), the namesake of Husraw II Parwēz (591–628).27

the dating of ZWY itself, and he noted that in if one accepts the reading “Khazars,” the
composition cannot be dated before the Late Sasanian period.

3.1 he second group of Iranian sources comprises texts extant actually in Arabic, not in Persian; we are interested here only in the texts in Arabic which describe the Khazar-Iranian relations before Islam. hese texts are generally held to go back, mostly, to the Sasanian Book of Kings, being thus translated into Arabic in the early Islamic Period. he following questions arise: how authentic is their information? Even more importantly, can mention made of the Khazars at such an early period be viewed as anything but anachronistic? Were they derived from the pre-Islamic Sasanian tradition, whether legendary or not, or were they derived from a source (or sources) written in Arabic much later?
3.2 As Dunlop observed, “the material in the Arabic and Persian writers with regard to the Khazars in early times falls roughly into three groups, centering respectively round the names of (a) one or other of the Hebrew patriarchs, (b) Alexander the Great, and (c) certain of the Sassanid kings, especially Anūšurwān and his immediate successors.”28 he irst two categories are, naturally, of legendary character;29 does the third one contain some genuine historical traditions?
3.3 he references to Khazars as active already before Islam appear in Arabic sources (partly derived, presumably, from the Xvadāy-Nāmag) composed in the second half of the ninth century, i.e., about a century ater Ibn Muqafa , Muhammad bin Djahm and others rendered the Sasanian Book of Kings from Pahlavi into Arabic. To such sources belongs, e.g., the work by al-Dīnawarī (died 895 C.E.), Kitāb al-’Akhbār al-Tiwal, according to which Khazars were playing a role of prominence in the Caucasus as early as the sixth century, or Kitāb Futūh al-Buldān by al-Balādhurī (died 892),30 who reports about the Khazar-Sasanian relations, or the History by al-Tabarī (838–932), in which the name of

3.4 In these sources, we have numerous references to the epoch of Husraw I Anōšurwān, who is said to deceive the Khazar Qagan,34 to subjugate the kings of the Caucasus,35 and to build the walls of Darband; Ibn al-Faqīh al-Hamadānī (early 10th century),36 whose information might go back to the Xvadāy-Nāmag (quoted as Akhbār al-Furs) ascribed to Anōšurwān the building of the most important Khazar cities, like Balanjar, Samandar, Xazarān; a similar tradition is known from Balādhurī and Tabarī, and later, from the local Caspian chronicles (cf. below, § 4.4). We are told that ambassadors from the Chinese, the Turks, and the Khazars were constantly at Husraw’s gate;37 the same king kept three thrones of gold in his palace, reserved for the kings of Byzantium, China and the Khazars,38 and according to Ibn-Khurdādhbih,39 persons wishing access to the Persian court from the country of the Khazars and the Alāns were detained at Bāb al-Abwāb.40

Polak41 rightly observed that Husraw I Anōšurwān (531–579) was put into the Khazar context instead of his famous namesake, Husraw II Parwēz (591–628),42 who was the king against whom the Türküts (or, “Khazars”) fought together with the Byzantines.
3.5 In the mid-sixties of the tenth century, the work of al-Tabarī was rendered into New Persian by Muhammad Bal amī, which became extremely popular and was later translated into many languages (Turkish, Čağatay,43 Urdu, and even back to Arabic). he last events appearing in Bal amī are dated by 842 C.E., and this work contains material unattested in al-Tabarī.44 hese authors were contemporary with the heyday of the Khazar Qaganate. he question is, were the Khazars inserted into the Arabic version by the translator(s) of the Sasanian Book of Kings instead of the Turks, whose very early appearance in Persian traditions is well-attested? Ater all, our authors believed, apparently, with justiication, that the Khazar Qaganate was an uninterrupted continuation of the Turkish Qaganate.
3.6 In contrast, the Arabic-writing Persian author Hamza b. al-Hasan al-Іsfāhānī, who wrote his History45 ca. 961, i.e., also in the time the Khazar Qaganate was still existing, and who had access to original Sasanian historical compositions (in some cases, independent of the XvadāyNāmag), included in his composition scarce data on the Khazars, and one cannot but suggest that there were very few, if any, references to Khazars in the original Sasanian Book (or books) of Kings.

iranian sources on the khazars 301
3.7 In Iranian sources surviving in Arabic, Khazars appear as Byzantine allies in the war against Šāhpūr, clearly a reminiscence of the joint Heraclius / Jibğu attack in the late 20s of the 7th century, probably conlated with some remote memory of the Hunnic participation in Kawād’s war against Edessa.46 Such chronological idiosyncrasy is by no means uncommon in Pahlavi literature,47 and the reference to the Turks in the Letter of Tansar was seen as an anachronism of a similar nature.48 My conclusion is that no authentic data about the Khazars in the Sasanian period can be provided by our sources in Arabic.
4.1 To the third group belong texts in the principal Iranian language, New Persian; the irst works written in that tongue appeared in the 10th century. he sources in which references to the Khazars are encountered are mostly translations or compilations from Arabic works, some of them lost. Actually, it is evident that the sources belonging to the third group do not form an independent body of traditions and, therefore, should be discussed within the framework of the study of the Arabic sources. It is only their (New) Persian language that distinguishes them from the Arabic sources, and by no means could they represent an independent Iranian tradition going back to the pre-Islamic period. However, they deserve study, and here I would like to make some observations about some tricky problems found in these secondary texts.
4.2 he New Persian compilations, some of them anonymous, whose information, including that on the Khazars, goes back to Arabic sources, are mostly geographies, like Hudūd al- Âlam,49 written in 982/3, or
46 Compare Bo Utas, “he non-religious Books. Pahlavi Literature as a Source to the
History of Central Asia,” AAAH 24 (1976), pp. 115–124.
47 he Late Sasanian historiography about Anōšurwān’s campaigns against the North
ern nomads and in Yemen is confused; already the source of ha ālibī combined wars
waged under Anōšurwān against the Khazars and the Abyssinians, making the King
of Kings a contemporary with Heraclius, confusing thus two Husraws, I and II (see H.
Zotenberg, Histoire des rois des Perses par Abou Mansôr Abd al-Malik ibn Mohammad
ibn Ismā īl al-ha ālibī, texte arabe publié et traduit, Paris 1900, pp. 614–5). I have dealt

55 he information about the “Khazars” found in the Ta rīkh-i Guzīdah is illuminating
in that it is obvious that the names “Qıbčaq,” “Khazar” and “Turks” were used as mutu
ally-changeable synonyms. Cf. the text (vol. I), p. 115, where “Qıbčaq” is mentioned
instead of that of “Khazar:” Anūširwān reorganized his army in order to check the mal

and led to the Khazar Qagan; a similar history appears in Mudjmal al-Tawārīkh;56 both accounts go to Ibn-Muqafa and to the pre-Islamic Persian traditions.
4.3 here is also a still unpublished manuscript in Persian from the 12th century by Muhammad ibn Alī al-Kātib al-Samarqandī,57 in which an undated legend is told; however, we might deduce from its contents that the legend goes back to the period when the Khazar king was still pagan.58
4.4 here is some secondary material to be found in the local Persian chronicles, where it is sometimes interspersed with important information.59 Written by Ibn Isfandiyār in 1216/17, the Ta’rīkh-i Tabarestān makes mention of the Rus’ attack on the Caspian Sea in 909;60 this information was incorporated into Ta’rīkh-i Rūyān written by Mawlānā Auliyā Allah Âmulī in 1362,61 but he added an apocrypal legend62 about the Khazars in the 6th century, putting them in the context of Jāmāsp, Balāš, Qubād (cf. § 3.3) and mentioning Khazar-Saqlāb inroads to Darband, which seems to be taken from Bal amī. Both sources were used by Mar ašī, the much later compiler of Ta’rīkh-i Tabarestān u Rūyān u-Māzandarān, who wrote in the 15th century.63 hough the texts are of

4.5 Quite another matter are such late references to “Khazars,” who appear always together with Rus’ and/or Saqlāb; it seems that there was a lore of traditional ethno-historical information which combined Khazars, Alans, Rus’, Saqlāb65 and other Northern peoples. So, the famous Persian poet Afdal-ul-Dīn Ibrāhīm Khāqānī (circa 1106–1190), who spent all his life in the Caucasus, mentioned (in his panegyrics dedicated to Akhsatān, a Širwān-Šāh of the 12th century) Rus’ and Khazars (Dīwān, Tehrān 1937, p. 135), and victories over Rus’ and Alans (Dīwān, p. 139, 145), Rus’ and Sarīr (Dīwān, 476; cf. also pp. 36, 406).66 It was Barthold67 who suspected that the Ghuzz or Qıpčāq are meant, and

64 hus, the History of the Caucasian Albanians (III, 21) by Movsēs Dasxuranc‘i (or
Kalankatuac‘i, or Kalankaytuac‘i) tells us that “in 644, a certain people of strange and
foreign appearance called Ruzik attacked from the lands of North, . . . they reached Par
taw, the capital of Albania, in no more than three days, and the city, unable to resist
them, was put to the sword . . .” (cf. C.J.F. Dowsett, he History of the Caucasian Alba
nians by Movsēs Dasxuranc‘i, London Oriental Series. Volume 8, London 1961, p. 224
and n. 4), and the Persian Geography (Hudūd al- Ālam) of 982 conirms that the Rus’
camped at Mubārakī, a large village at the gate of Barda‘a (cf. Minorsky, pp. 114, 398–9);
another attack is reported by Ibn al-Athīr (Ibn-el-Athiri Chronicon quod perfectissimum
inscribitur, volumen nonum, annos H. 370–450 continens, ad idem codicum Parisono
rum, edidit Carolus Johannes Tornberg . . ., Lugduni Batavorum, E.J. Brill 1851–76; al
Kāmil fī-l-Ta rīkh, Beirūt 1966) for 944 C.E.
65 It is understandable why these two groups became frequently combined together
in Muslim (and other) sources beginning from the late 10th century. Alans also were
mentioned together with Rus’; indeed, the relations between Alans and Rus’ became
very close prior to the Mongol invasion.

iranian sources on the khazars 305
Minorsky was right, in my opinion, when he suggested that the name of Khazar applies here to the Kumans.68 Nizāmī (circa 1141–1203), the younger contemporary of Khāqānī, made in his epic on Alexander the Great, Sikandar Nāmah, the Khazars and the Russians to appear as Alexander’s enemies in the North;69 certainly Nizāmī had the same events as Khāqānī in mind when he wrote on this “Rus’-Khazar” invasion.
4.6 Some anachronistic information70 is contained also in the 15th century Persian work by Muhammad ibn Khāwandšāh Mīrkhōnd, whose Kitāb-i Ta rīkh-i Raudat al-Safā (Bombay 1266H = 1849/50)71 was very popular in the West. here are more anachronisms in our Arab-Persian sources of the later dates, like the reference of Ibn al-Athīr (1160–1234), under 421H = 1030 C.E., to what he calls “the raid of Fadlūn the Kurd against the Khazars.”72 According to Ibn al-Athīr, ater an attack on the “Khazars,” Fadlūn was returning to his own country, when the Khazars fell upon him unexpectedly and killed more than 10,000 of his troops. hese “Khazars” recovered the booty which Fadlūn had taken from them and captured the equipment of the Muslims. Polak73 notes that this seems to indicate that these Khazars were still non-Muslims; however, Barthold74 (who identiied this “Fadlūn” as Fadl ibn Muhammad of the Šaddādid dynasty, who ruled at Gandjah) argued that here Georgians and/or Abkhazians75 were probably meant,76 and this opinion was

upheld by Dunlop,77 and by Minorsky.78 I would add that the printed text of Ibn al-Athīr reads (the Beirut edition, IX, p. 409): , “[to] raid the Khazar;” it is self-evident how easily an error could have been arisen.79 his is a glaring example of how the Khazars were introduced into a text by later hands, because they, the Khazars, were better known than other Oriental peoples.80
5.0 In conclusion: Iranian sources, and sources derived from Iranian traditions, provide us with rich information about the cultural milieu of their authors. Some of these sources are indispensable for reconstruction of some lost literary works, which have nothing to do with the real Khazars. he sources should be scrutinized as representative of their literary tradition, and only then we should dare to use them in reconstruction of remote past, while avoiding far-fetched historical speculation.

tion of this short and ambiguous piece of information provided by Ibn al-Athīr, found
it possible to speak of a “small Jewish princedom with its center at Samandar, which
managed to survive until the Mongol-Tatar invasion in 1238–39 and was able to repel
the attack of Fadlun, the Kurdish ruler of Ganja, in 1030.” his article is full of further
badly based and wishful statements. On the problem, see Golden in W. Barthold – P.B.
Golden, “Khazar,” p. 1176b.
In passing I wish to add that according to the local Muslim chronicles edited and
translated by Minorsky (Münedjdjim-bāşı), in 420–1/1029–30 there were invasions
southwards carried out by the people of al-Bāb and Rūs; the latter ones, however, entered
into the service of Mūsā b. Fadl, the son of our “Fadlūn,” helping him to ight his brother;
two years later, it was the people of Sarīr and the Alāns who raided Širwān. he events of
these years are covered pretty well by the local chronists (who certainly possessed much
better information that Ibn al-Athīr the Syrian), and they do not mention Khazars as
taking part in them. In fact, the actions of the people of Sarīr and the Alāns described
under 1030 are almost identical to those described by Ibn al-Athīr. See Minorsky, A
History, pp. 31–2, 47 (Arabic text: pp. 9, 20–1); Minorskij, Istorija, pp. 53–4, 70–1 (Ara
bic text: pp. 11, 22–3), cf. p. 94 n. 20 and p. 154 and n. 133. For more anachronistic
information on the Khazars, cf. also Mirza A[lexandre] Kazem-Beg, Derbend-nāmeh,

whether the Khazar king knows anything about them” (i.e., the traditions current in
Spain about the Khazars). Ibn Šaprūt mentions “an army of Chaldaeans” rising against
the Khazar Jews. It seems that these “Chaldaeans” persecuting Jews (who later came to
Khazaria via “Armīnīya”) were referred to in the lost part of the Cambridge Document.

ARMENIAN AND GEORGIAN SOURCES ON THE KHAZARS: A RE-EVALUATION1
Dan D.Y. Shapira
he importance of Armenian and Georgian sources dealing with different aspects of the “Khazar question” is well acknowledged. Łewond, for instance, is an Armenian source indispensable for studying the Arab-Khazar wars.2 Some aspects of these texts, however, have not yet received due attention, and it is my main purpose here to demonstrate the complicated interaction between these texts. Neither Jews nor Khazars were strangers to the Caucasus. It is suicient to recall that the famous Schechter (or “Cambridge”) Document,3 which records the semi-legendary version of the Jewish migration into Khazaria, begins with the word “Armīnīya.” Unfortunately, we do not know for certain what appeared before that word in the now lost sections,4

5 We do know that ater the Byzantines defeated the Persians in the late twenties of
the seventh century, there was within the Empire, which included, in these years, also
much of Transcaucasia, a forced conversion to Christianity, the irst known so far. As to
‘Armenia’, it is worth noting in passing that such an important, albeit legendary, source
as the Ethiopian Kebrā Negāst, h. 117, made reference to a simultaneous Jewish upris
ing in both Armenia and Arabia (I. Shahid, “he Kebra Nagast in the Light of Recent
Research,” Le Muséon 89 (1976), pp. 133–178, see p. 135); the Jewish revolt in Arabia
refers to the Jewish state of Dhu Nuwās in the twenties of the 6th century; the Kebra
Negast is a source well aware of things Armenian—it is enough to point out that all the
prophecies in this work are put in the mouth of none other than the Armenian St. Greg
ory the Illuminator, cf. I. Shahid, “he Kebra Nagast in the Light of Recent Research,” pp.
136, 173–4. It appears, however, that the reference to a Jewish revolt in Armenia in the
12th century Ethiopian work is only a literary parallelism void of any historical implica
tions; see D.D.Y. Shapira, “Stray Notes on Aksum and Himyar” Scrinium 2 (2006), pp.
416–427, esp. 421–422. On St. Gregory see further.
6 he Khazar invasion into the Northern Caucasus accured circa 660, ater the Turkic
Qaganate collapsed in 657–9, with Berzilia on the Volga being one of the irst Khazar
conquests; as C. Zuckerman has demonstrated (see K. Cukerman, “Xazary i Vizantija:
pervyje kontakty,” Materialy po Arxeologii, Istorii i Étnograii Tavrii, VIII (Simferopol’
2001), pp. 312–333, and in this volume), the Arabs preceded the Khazars in Transcau
casia and not vice versa, and it was the Arabs who became a stumbling block for the
Khazars there, and not the other way round.
but it would seem from the context that it concerned some migration through (or from) “Armīnīya” (which included, for the author of the text, much of Transcaucasia), or of some persecution of Jews5 which resulted in their exodus from “Armīnīya.” Georgia and Armenia (and Caucasian Albania, so tightly connected to both) were for decades, if not centuries, battlegrounds for the Khazars, who repeatedly invaded these countries in order to pillage, or to confront their Arab enemies.6 Armenian and Georgian authors have preserved for us valuable information about Alans, Maskuts, Bulghars, Basils, Savirs, Khazirs / Khazars, Huns and other Northern peoples. However, much of this information, especially that found in the Georgian sources (which are of later dates as compared to the Armenian ones), is legendary in character, and therefore must be treated with caution. Both the Armenian and Georgian historical traditions suggest a very early date for a Jewish presence in their respective countries, but there is a diference between the historical fates of these two Jewries: while Armenian Jews vanished, most of them probably through assimilation, as the Armenian



armenian and georgian sources on the khazars 309
sources themselves suggest (or else, they let Armenia),7 Georgian Jewry continues to survive—and to lourish—even today (albeit the question whether the Georgian Jewry of the Miidle Ages and later can be traced to the irst Christian centuries remains open). We should stress already at this stage that there is no implicit reference in our Armenian and Georgian sources to Khazar Judaism. his silence is remarkable, especially when compared with Old Russian, Byzantine (Vita of Cyril extant in Slavonic),8 Arabic, Persian (including Zoroastrian Persian),9 and Hebrew sources. he impression one gets would seem to imply that everyone knew there were some Jewish Khazars, except their closest, and, one might add, oldest, neighbors. In the following article, I mainly intend to treat the Armenian and Georgian sources dealing with the Khazars, but I will also touch on some of the references to the Jews proper, hoping to demonstrate that both sujets are connected. As it is methodologically unsound to try to separate Armenian and Georgian sources, I shall treat them as a corpus.

Armenia was a Christian nation, torn since 387 C.E. between Byzantium and Sasanian Iran. Armenian Christianity was originally Syriac,10
7 L.M. Melikset-Bek, Armeno-Hebraica, Tbilisi 1945 [reprint: “Aticot” Antiquar
ian Booksellers, Tel-Aviv 1970; no pagination], p. 31, draws attention to the fact that
Armenian sources stopped mentioning Jews in Armenia from the 7th–8th centuries,
and suggested that some of them may have emigrated to Khazaria. On linguistic aspects
of the supposed early Jewish-Armenian and Jewish-Georgian interaction, cf. D. Shapira,

1.1 For Armenians, the most important Armenian historian, their “father of history” (patmahayr) is Movsēs Xorenac‘i.20 He was believed to be one of the pupils of the inventor of the Armenian script, Mesrop Maštoc (died 440) and of the patriarch Sahak (died 439), of St. Gregory’s line. However, the date of Xorenac‘i is still one of the most debated problems in Armenian historiography,21 for he is dated by various authors
18 With only traces of Armenian Vorlagen to be found now in the most ancient Geor
gian texts. he most ancient evidence of the Georgian script, interestingly enough, is a
Georgian inscription from Jerusalem dated 430, less than a decade ater the Georgian
alphabet was—allegedly—invented by St. Mesrop. In the 5th–6th centuries, the Land
of Israel became the most important center of Georgian monasticism ater the oldest
Georgian monasteries, Palavra and Mar-Saba, were founded there (483). he 85 oldest
Georgian MSs come from Mt. Sinai’s St. Catherine monastery, among them mravaltavi

as belonging to the period from the 7th–9th century. In any case, it seems to be proven that the text of his “History” remained unattested by other Armenian authors until the 10th century. His information about the Khazars is unreliable and anachronistic not only for a 5th century author, but even for one living in the 7th or 9th centuries; his accounts of the invasions of the Alans and the Basils (II 50, 85) are modeled upon Josephus’ description of the Alan invasion of Armenia (Wars VII 7.4); it is not certain whether Movsēs only knew Josephus second-hand,22 or whether he had an Armenian version to work from,23 but, as homson has shown, many of the traditions preserved in Xorenac‘i dealing with ancient Jewish colonies in Armenia, are in fact “idiosyncratic elaborations” of Josephus, reshaped to it the Armenian setting, as the aim of Movsēs’ “Jewish traditions” was to establish an honorable Israelite genealogy for his Bagratuni patrons.
1.2 Let us examine the traditions in Movsēs Xorenac‘i about Jews and Khazars:
II 6: King Vałaršak24 summoned a foreign barbarian nation from the northern Caucasus to settle in the upper course of the Araxes, west of Mt Arargats, where Kars is located; the place was later called Vanand, because Vłendur25 Bulgar Vund dwelt there. It is clear that some Bulgar or Khazar colony is cast here into the remote past.
II 9: In the days of Aršak son of Vałaršak, there was much tumult in the regions of the Greater Caucasus, in the Land of Bulgars, and many of them came to Armenia, to the county of Koł.
Khazars as evidence for the late date of Xorenac‘i, cf. L.M. Melikset-Bek, “Xazary po
drevnearmjanskim istočnikam v svjazi s problemoj Moiseja Xorenskogo,” Issledovanija
po Istorii Kul’tury Narodov Vostoka. Sbornik v čest’ akademika I.A. Orbeli, Moscow-Len
ingrad 1960, pp. 112–118.
22 So homson, Moses Khorenats‘i, pp. 25–27.
23 See, now, R.W. homson, “he Armenian Version of the Georgian Chronicles,”
Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies 5 (1990–1991), pp. 81–90 (pp. 82–3), where
the author states that the old Armenian version of Josephus’ History of the Jewish Wars
was lost and the extant Armenian translation of the Wars by Stephen of Lvov (Arme
nian: Ilov) was revised from a Latin rendering.
24 We are dealing with the irst centuries of the current era, but Xorenac‘i’s chronol
ogy is confused.

his tradition airms the former, calling Bulgars by their name; Koł is identical with Vanand mentioned in the preceding passage.
II 58: Contains a genealogy of the Ałavelian family; they are said to be relatives of the Alan princess, Satanik (Satana of the North-Caucasian Nart epic), who became Artašes’ wife. In the days of Xosrov the father of Trdat, the members of the family allied themselves by marriage with a certain mighty man of the Basil people. Again, we have Northmen, in this case Alans and Basils, who go south and become prominent in Armenia. Why our author feels the need to stress the foreign ancestry of certain Armenian clans and regions is a separate question which we shall not deal with here.
II 65: Under Vałarš son of Trdat, at the end of the second century, Nor K‘ałak‘ (Kainēpolis, “the New City,” which is the same as Vałaršapat, mentioned in the Talmud)26 was built south of Mt Aragac; here Vałarš settled a Jewish colony27 and the place became a commercial center. Under the same king, the Khazars and Basils united, passing through the Čoł Gate under the leadership of their king, a certain Vnasēp Surhap (this is clearly an Iranian name, probably *Wīnāsp Suxrāb, or *Wšnāsp / *Gušnāsp Suxrāb);28 they crossed over to this (southern) side of the River Kura, but Vałarš defeated them twice, although he himself died at the hands of their archers. his is the irst time Movsēs mentions the Khazars, in the third century; by all opinions, it is too early.29
II 86: It contains an Armenicized version of the bios kai politeia of St.30 Nino / Nunē, who (sent by St. Gregory the Illuminator of the Armenian

nation) is said to belong to the circle of the virgin martyr, St. Hrip‘simē.31 he Armenian version of the conversion of the Georgian King Mirian / *Mihrān32 contains details taken from the Armenian stories about the conversion of the Armenian King Trdat, the torturer of St. St. Hrip‘simē. But it is to be observed that in the Armenian version of the St. Nino’s account there is no reference to any Jewish milieu, which is so prominent in the Georgian version (especially, in the version of Mokcevai Kartlisai, or he Conversion of Kartli, on which see further). Nevertheless, the Armenian version adds an interesting detail: St. Nino also preaches in the Land of Mask‘ut‘k‘ (i.e., Masagets) in Southern Daghestan, which was later closely associated with the Khazars. As his authority for this information, Movsēs cites Agat‘angełos.33
1.4 To conclude, what we can see of Movsēs’ references to Northern peoples, including the Khazars, is purely legendary and / or anachronistic in character, but there are hints of some kind of connection felt to exist between the Northern peoples and the Jews, and this precisely in descriptions of the period of the Christianization of Armenia and Georgia; the same tendency exists also in other Armenian and Georgian texts, as will be demonstrated later. What we ind in Movsēs about Jews is too little for a ith century author, and yet too much about Khazars, Bulgars and Basils. Movsēs,

2.1 here is another work previously attributed to Movsēs Xorenac‘i, the so-called “Armenian Geography” (or Ašxarhats‘uyts‘) of “PseudoMovsēs Xorenac‘i,”34 which contains authentic and valuable material on Khazars and other North-Caucasian peoples. In fact, it is there that the irst authentic notice of the Khazars in Armenian sources was made.35 he Ašxarhats‘uyts‘ exists in two recensions, the older and longer one (written between the mid-sixth century, when Justinian established the form of administrative division of the eastern Byzantine provinces relected in the work), and the younger and shorter one (dated prior to the second half of the seventh century, before the Arab onslaught). his work contains information originating in the works of Ptolemy, Marine of Tyre, and lost Middle Persian geographical works,36 and it was among the sources used by the author of the “History” of [Pseudo-]Xorenac‘i.

He also mentions the city of the Huns called Varač‘an (Varač‘an k‘ałak‘ nocin Honac‘); to the west lived Savirs on the River T‘ald.51 To the north, near Darband which he equated with Čor, he mentions a tower in the sea. Eastwards, there was a long wall called Azountkawat, that is, attributed to Kawād. Unlike that of Xorenac‘i, this information is authentic.

3.1 We shall now turn to Georgian sources, returning to the sources in Armenian later. he most ancient dated Georgian text, with the exception of the inscriptions, is the Vita of St. Šušanik.52 Šušanik, the daughter of the famous Armenian hero Vardan Mamikonean,53 was married to Varsken, or Vazgēn, the son of Aršuša, the Sasanian pitiaxš (or bdeašx)54
51 Pseudo-Movsēs Xorenac‘i, ed. Soukry, 27/37: “North of Darband is the kingdom
of the Huns, near the sea. In its western (part) is Varač‘an, the city of the Huns, and
Č‘ungars and *Smēnd [*Msndr, see Marquart, Streifzüge, pp. 58, 492]. Toward the East
live the Savirk‘ up to the river T‘ald.” his T‘ald was said (so Golden, An Introduction to
the History of the Turkic Peoples, p. 107, from where the translation is taken) to be Atil,
but the “Geography” knew Atil under its own name, where Basils, not Savirs, were liv
ing, and it was plundered, much northwards, by Khazars and Bušxs, not by Savirs. In
my opinion, T‘ald can be compared to the mysterious Tyzwl of the Letter of Joseph the
Khazar king.

of Eastern Georgia, who fought the Huns at Čor, near the later Darband. Varsken renounced his Christian faith (as it appears, Armenian Christianity), and embraced Zoroastrianism. He also tried to force his new religion on his wife, but in vain. Šušanik was tortured for many years, but did not apostacize and died as a Christian, to be canonized later. What interests us here are the threats uttered by Varsken to send her, riding a donkey, which is reminiscent of a Persian custom of humiliation, to Čor, or, alternatively, to the Gate55 of the (Sasanian) King, both, apparently, implying death.
4.2 he Vita was composed by Šušanik’s confessor Yakob Curtaveli under Pērōz, King of Kings (459–484,) and Vaxtang Gorgasal,56 prior to 483 (less than ity years ater the Georgian alphabet was invented); this follows from the fact that in 482/3 Varsken was murdered by Vaxtang,57 the event being still absent from the text. Hence, the only information we can gather from this text is that there were wars with the “Huns” near Darband, and that these enemies of the Sasanians were seen as bloodthirsty and barbarian enough to enable one to threaten sending someone into their hands. As this source can be dated with the precision of a couple of years, it should be stressed that the fact that the Northern barbarians in the late ith century are called “Huns,” and not “Khazars,” as in many other Armenian and Georgian sources of later dates which describe the 5th century events,58 is another indication that wherever we

of Targamos / Togarma”),69 while using motifs derived from the Persian epic traditions to describe them. In his version, the Caucasian peoples, united, pushed the Khazars back and proceded into their own territory in Daghestan, which is also reminiscent of Xorenac‘i’s account of Vnasēp Surhap’s expedition (cf. 1.2 above). But the Khazars appointed a king to whom all of them submitted, and were successful in progressively pillaging all the Transcaucasian countries, using for their razziahs both the Darial and the Darband passages (pp. 11–12). However, the Caucasian peoples were delivered by the Persian Apridon (*Afrīdōn / Ferīdūn) and by Ardam, a descendant of Nebrot, who is Biblical Nimrod70 (pp. 12–13). Whilst anachronistic and legendary, this account falls well into the framework of the events of the seventh / eighth centuries.71 he source also describes the Ossetes (whose name derives from the Georgian name for the Alans, the North-Caucasian people best-known to the Georgians throughout their history) as the descendants of Uobos, one of the sons

the Caucasian Christians (especially, the Armenians) and the Judaized Khazars (cf. in
the beginning of the Hebrew letter of the Khazar king Joseph, for the texts, see P.K.
Kokovcov, Evrejsko-xazarskaja perepiska v X veke, Leningrad 1932) boasted their
descent from Biblical Togarma. Even though inding a pseudo-Biblical genealogy was
one of the favorite themes of almost all medieval authors who ever mentioned the Kha
zar (cf. Dunlop, he History of the Jewish Khazars, p. 12), the question arises why this
particular genealogy was picked up? Was it because Togarma sounds similar to Türk?
Because of the Turkic-sounding ending -ma? Because of the Turkic roots with the mean
ing “to be tough, sturdy;” “to be born;” “to be straight, honest, upright, true”? (see Sir

of the afore-mentioned Khazar king (p. 12), thus underlining the well established alliance—albeit of later times—between the Khazars and the Alans.
5.4 Another tradition, deriving from an Armenian version of the Persian epic, describes the wars waged in the Caucasus against the Turks, Armenians and Georgians by Kekapos, Paraborot and Kaixosro (Iranian *Kay-Kāwūs, *Farraburz and *Kay-Husraw); this may be reminiscent of the turbulent years of Bahrām Čōbēn.72 A small party of the Turks settled among the Georgians, their allies, helping them against the Persians, and their settlement was called Sark ine, which means in Georgian “iron.”73 Later, these immigrants were labeled “bun-Turks,” which was translated as “etheo-Turks,” from the Persian word “bun,” known in diferent forms also in Armenian and Georgian.74 Since then, Georgians have given refuge to oppressed people leeing from Greece, Syria or Khazaria, for the sake of their help against the Persians (KC, p. 15),75 with the next chapter dedicated to the legendary history of Jewish immigration into Georgia:

Barsils—one of the groups important in the earliest stages of the Khazar ethnic his

74 I think another Iranian etymology is possible (again, this meaning also exists in
both Armenian and Georgian), namely, from the Persian word for “military or royal
camp,” meaning thus something like “royal Turks;” it is to be remembered that as a loan
word from Iranian, bun is attested already in Old Turkic, see Clauson, An Etymological
Dictionary of Pre-hirteenth Century Turkish, p. 347. For diferent views, cf. P. Golden,

5.5 Interestingly enough, Leonti Mroveli informs us straight aterwards that previously it was Armenian, and not Georgian, that was then spoken in Kartli,80 thus relecting old Armenian inluence on Eastern Georgia. Ater a short pseudo-historical interpolation about *Asfandiyār / Ardašīr Pābagān, Mroveli states that, in fact, six languages were spoken in Kartli in ancient times, namely, Armenian, Georgian, Khazar (Xazar), Syriac, Hebrew and Greek. hese garbled traditions cannot be dated (though one may venture to suggest that they stem from an era characterized by a rather friendly attitude to the Khazars and by close Armeno-Georgian ties), but there is perhaps a kernel of historical truth in these accounts which combine the arrival of both Khazars and Jews in Kartli.81 In later, but still legendary, times, Khazar incursions were still frequently mentioned. hey are entirely anachronistic, of course, and the references to them were made due to the substitution of real Khazar razziahs of not so remote (for Mroveli, or his source[s]) times for ancient nomadic inroads. It should be noted, however, that this Georgian source uses “Turks” and “Khazars” as synonyms, frequently referring also to Ossetes, alongside with “Khazars.” We then have two diverse accounts about Alexander’s conquests in Kartli: the irst, that these savage Bun-Turks and Qıpčaqs82 resisted the king in their castles, which included Urbnisi, K’asp’i, Upliscixe, Mxceta, Ojraqe, Sark’ine, Cixe Didi and Zanavi “the quarter of the Jews” (ubani [H]uriata); whereas, according to the second account, unable to stand up to Alexander, they escaped to the Caucasus (KC,

79 Some scholars provided this toponym with a Hebrew etymology (zānāb, “tail”),
which seems to me untenable.

pp. 17–18). Later on, anachronistically again, Khazars feature prominently in the latest part of KC (History of King Vaxtang Gorgasal, composed by Ĵuanšer).
5.6 he structure of these initial chapters of KC is very similar to both Xorenac‘i’s accounts mentioned above, and to the initial chapter of MK, which elaborates the Romance of Alexander; according to the version of MK, Alexander forced the brethren of the Children of Biblical Lot (i.e., the impure Ammonites and Moabites)83 into the Land of Qedar.84 his is, of course, an old and well-known tradition about the enclosed nations,85 but it is worth noting that, as far as I know, there is no other tradition which identiies the enclosed nations with Qedar; although, on the other hand, it should be admitted, the Khazars and other Pontic Türks, like the Crimean and Noqai Tatars, were sometimes identiied with the people of Qedar, especially in the late Hebrew sources.86
83 Compare KC: Jews.
84 Compare KC: Kartli. Was the phonetic similarity evoked, too?
85 Cf. G. Gary, he Medieval Alexander, Cambridge 1956. he Khazars were espe
cially mentioned as one of the nations enclosed by Alexander, see, for instance, Druth
mar of Aquitaine, “Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam” (ed. J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae

race and call themselves Gazari there is one tribe, a very belligerent one, and Alexander
enclosed them.”
86 Besides the obvious fact that both the Biblical Qedar (from the Hebrew root which
means “dark”) and the Khazars were pastoralists, other factors were at work here, among
them, the phonetic similarity between QDR and KaZaR. he phonetic and semantic
similarity was also behind the confusion between Kedari and the phonetically and
semantically close črdileodi (which means “Northern” in Georgian) by the Georgian
authors of MK, who used these ethnonyms indiscriminately with Bun-Turks and with
honni (Huns); see also G. Pätsch, “Die Bekehrung Georgiens Mokcevay Kartlisay (Ver

confused Qedar with the name of the Sons of Q tūrāh (Ketura), who were taken to be
the Ismaelites concealed by Gideon, ater the model of the Romance of Alexander. As
a result, the Sons of Q tūrāh were seen as mighty men residing in the Caucasus, and in
the 10th century CE, the Armenian Catholicos John of Drasxanakert wrote (Yovhanes

Q tūrāh appears in the Jewish literature (the City of Qītōr, in the Targūm Šēnī to Esther,
is located in the South; Qītōr which might mean in Hebrew “steam,” or “bond,” may be
a rendering, by a Volksetymologie, of Iranian band, “fortress” (like in Dar-band), or of
an Iranian form close to Kurdish diz / dež, “fortress,” wrongly analyzed as if from dūd,
“smoke.” Among Iranian Christians, on the other hand, Bēth Qitrāyē, “Islands” (Soqo
tra?) was known to be a bishopric.

88 here are old traditions, which form part of the Alexander Cycle, connecting Jews
with India, cf. L. Wallach, “Alexander the Great and the Indian Gymnosophistes in
Hebrew Tradition,” Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. XI
(1951), pp. 47–83. As is well known, “Indians” might stand for “Ethiopians.”
89 MK reads honni instead of “Jews” ([x]uriani) in KC. It was E.S. Takaišvili [Taqa
išvili], “Obraščenije Gruzii,” Sbornik Materialov dlja opisanija mestnostej i plemën
Kavkaza XXVIII, Tilis 1900, p. 5, who noted that the correct reading must be not honni,
but xuriani, “Hebrews.” he Vorlage had a tilde, while o and u interchange frequently in
the Xucuri alphabet; the text in question has both xuria / xoria, “Jew,” Nom. Sng; xuriani
/ xoriani, Nom. Pl.; xuriata / xoriata, Gen.Pl. (passim) , as was noted by Prof. K. Lerner;
compare also Iebos for Jebus (Iebous). he mention of Jebusites, as the former inhabitants
of the region, looks strange, but it may be that the Amalekites are hinted at; it is perhaps
worth comparing them to Mroveli’s reference to the Armenian language as formerly
spoken in Kartli, as Armenians frequently boasted, besides their origin from Togarma,
also their Amalekite progeny (the irstborn of nations!), because Armenians believed that
their country was the irst nation to adopt Christianity as the state-religion.
However, though there is no doubt that under honni here Jews are meant, the reading
honni can be original. It may relect the later fate of the Jews in question who migrated to
the Huns, i.e., to the North-Caucasian nomads (including, probably, Khazars).
90 he Chaldaeans’ arrival in Kartli is mentioned in the Alexander episode also in KC,

However, one is tempted to connect this migration with the light of Jews from Armenia to Khazaria, as the Schechter Document suggests. Another possibility is to see in these traditions some remote memory of the forced immigration of Savirs from Caucasian Albania into Byzantian Georgia ca. 575.91

However, one observation may nevertheless be of interest: the redactors of these initial chapters of MK and KC felt (as did the author of the History of the Armenian [pseudo-]Xorenac‘i) that the Transcaucasian Jews used to have something in common with the North-Caucasian Turkic nomads.
6.0 In the most important text dealing102 with Khazars they were, however, called “Turks,” which is correct for the period that our source describes, for in the period under consideration, Khazars could still not be distinguished from the Western Turks, or “Türküts.”
6.1 Fighting against the armies of Yazdigird II the Sasanian, the Armenians and Georgians did not participate actively in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and did not endorse the decisions made there, wrongly identifying them later with the teachings of Nestorius.103 hey accepted the compromising Henotikon of the Emperor Zeno (481/2 C.E.) under the Katholikos Babgen (490–515),104 but when the Imperial Church returned to the Chalcedon formula in 518, they rejected it, and in 554 or 555 the Greek Church itself—apparently, on hierarchial basis—,105
101 However, the reference found in KM to the non-Israelite Palestinian nations
(“brethren of the Children of Lot; Jebusites”) identiied with inhabitants of the land of
Qedar in the Northern Caucasus and with Bun-Turks is appealing. Should the reader
realize that, although having some Jewish / Biblical connections, these Northern nomads
are not the true Israel?

views were vindicated by the Chalcedon Council. Another reason for the Armenian
rejection of Chalcedon was purely linguistic: Armenian, at that time, had only one term,
p‘nout‘iwn, for both phusis and hypostasis, and only much later a new term for phusis,
ew‘iwn or koiout‘iwn, was coined.

given the traditional rivalry between the two nations, the mere memory of the form of Christianity once shared by Georgians and Armenians (and Albanians) was suppressed in Georgian sources, and in fact, practically all the extant Georgian literature originates ater the split. During the reign of Husraw II Parwēz, the Sasanian Empire favored the Monophysites rather than the traditionally tolerated Nestorian108 branch of Christianity109 (dubbed “the Church of Persia”), presumably, because of the inluence of Šīrīn, the Armenian wife of the King of Kings immortalized by Persian poets (Xusraw-o Šīrīn), so, in 614, ater Jerusalem was captured by the Sasanian Persians,110 they tried to impose the antiChalcedonian leadership on all the Christians in their realm, including those in the territories conquered from the Byzantines. We know next to nothing about the efect this Imperial decision had in Georgia, although this event certainly has importance for Khazar studies. However, in 625/6, when Heraclius and his “Khazar” allies besieged Tbilisi, the city was defended by its local Georgian Christian ruler subject to Iran, and by a Persian garrison under a Persian oicer. It seems that the genuine account of these events was lost, if it ever existed in a written form in Georgian, because for the later Georgian readers the prospect that their ruler had probably abandoned what was seen since then as the core of Georgian identity, was deemed to be ofensive. he period between 606–629 was a religiously embarrassing period for them, thus
relapsed into their national church and again denounced Chalcedon at Dwin in 645. But
the inal separation followed only the Manazkert Synod of 726, see N. Adontc, Armenija

6.2 In fact, our best Greek source, heophanes,112 reports the events that led to the siege on Tbilisi as follows: the Persians sought to orchestrate an attack on Constantinopole by the Western Huns, called Avars, Bulgars, Slavs and Gepids. In reaction, Heraclius, while in Lazica, invited “the Turks from the East called Khazars”113 to become his allies. heophanes calls them indiscriminately either “Khazars,” or “Turks;”114 they broke through the Caspian Gates and, under their stratēgos Ziebēl, who was second to their Xagan, they invaded Azerbaydjan (Adra’gan). Heraclius set out from Lazica and joined them. Both leaders met under the walls of Tbilisi; Ziebēl, seeing the Emperor, rushed to him, kissed his

Heraclius, with the Khazars, proceeded to Persia, etc. Ziebēl was thus not the Khazar Qagan, but second in rank,116 surely not on the same royal footing with Heraclius; his son can be easily identiied with the šad117 known from other sources. he participation of Ziebēl in the siege was short, and that of Heraclius even shorter; the defenders of the city included Persians (it is uncertain, whether exclusively so, or mostly Persians). heophanes does not mention the sack of Tbilisi and dates all these events to one year, 6117 AM, 625/6 C.E., but it is known that his chronology is erroneous.118

Emperor promised to give his only daughter Eudocia, Augusta Rômaiôn, to the lord of
the Turks (tourkôn kurios), but the marriage was not consumated as the Khazar ruler
was slain in 629. See Nicephorus Patriarcha, Historía síntomos. Breviarium reerum post

reviews published in Revue Numismatique 152 (1997), pp. 453–472, and Zuckerman’s
answer on pp. 473–478. Nicephorus (758–829; Partiarch in 806–815) belonged to the
same generation as heophanes. For the period between 609–799, his chronicle is very
poor. Later, Nicephorus mentioned that Heracleus suggested marrying the same Eudo
cia to the Arab general Ambros (*‘Amr[u]), if only the Muslim would be baptized.
122 However, there is an interesting example of a much later interest in the Khazars.
he stories of Ĵimšer son of the king of the Khazars and of Ĵimšer’s son were interpolated
in the 18th century into the Georgian epic Amiran-Dareĵaniani (cf. Rayield, he Lit

6.5 According to KC, trapped between the Byzantines and the Persians, the eristavta mtavari (“the leader of the heads of the people”) of Kartli, Stepanoz son of Guaram124 (Iranian *Wahrām), did not dare to adopt a royal title. It seems that his religious politics were non-Orthodox and he presumably returned to Monophysite Christianity ater the Sasanian government issued a decree ordering all Christians to embrace it, for it is said that he was impious and did not increase the religion125 and did not serve God. In Georgia, which only a few years before that had gone through a painful split with the mother-Church of Armenia and joined the previously hated Chalcedonians, the situation was extremely sensitive.126 In the war between Byzantium and Persia, presumably Monophysite Stepanoz supported the Persians against the Byzantines supported by his Chalcedonian compatriots, guided by the erismtavar (“ethnarch”) Adarnase, Stepanoz’ relative from the “older” line of the Chosroid House.

Stepanoz, loyal to his Persian masters, fortiied the citadel of Tbilisi (known later as Qal‘a)127 and, though the Byzantines laid siege to Tbilisi, daily made sorties out of the city gates and fought the Greeks, until he was killed, and the Emperor seized Tbilisi. But in the citadel there remained a few who did not surrender. Obviously, most, if not all of them, were members of the Persian garrison, although the text does not state this explicitly. he commander of the citadel insulted the king, that is, the Emperor, calling down from the citadel: “You have the beard of a billy-goat, and you have the neck of a hegoat” (in the 12th century Armenian translation of the Georgian, which is the oldest attestation of the text:128 “Up and depart, you smelly goat”), accusing him thus of pederasty (cf. further). he king commanded:129 “Although this man scornfully calls me a he-goat, yet his remark is not false.” He took the book of Daniel, and found it written thus: “he goat of the West will come forth, and he will destroy the horns of the ram of the East” (a paraphrase of Daniel 8.3–10).130 hen the king rejoiced, and was convinced that everything would succeed for him against the Persians [KC, p. 224]. he king [Emperor] then summoned the son of Bakur, king of the Georgians, a descendant of Dači the son of Vaxtang, who was eristavi of Kaxeti, named Adarnase,131 and gave him Tbilisi and the principality of Kartli.

6.6 Here the sequence is as follows: Heraclius allied himself with the Turks / Khazars, assembled an army and went to Georgia. here is not a single word about Turkic, or Khazar, troops arriving in Georgia; the role of the Persians is downplayed; it was Stepanoz who organized the defence, fought vigorously, but was killed in battle. Ater his death, Tbilisi was captured, but some people, obviously, Persians, kept defending the citadel (at this point we can assume that this continuation of the siege could have been seen as two diferent sieges, as it became, seemingly, in the case of the Albanian Chronicle, cf. further). heir commander mocked the appearance of Heraclius, his beard and his neck. he Emperor read from Daniel, appointed a new ruler of Kartli from the local dynasty and a relative of Stepanoz who had been killed, and departed to ight the main forces of the Persians. He let with the new Georgian ruler a Ĵibğa, who was described as merely an eristavi, “prince,”134 and who had been

king just “a goat,” which is more similar to the old Armenian testimony of the Georgian text of KC. Ctesiphon is called Baghdad (Bağdad), not Babylon; there is no bad word to say about Stepanoz, and his death is not mentioned at any stage of the story: it is the commander of the citadel who was executed. But let us see how the account continues. Ater that, the text tells about Heraclius’ victories in Persia. he text adds that the Emperor returned to Tbilisi, where he assembled all the Christians in the churches and forcibly converted Magi and ire-worshippers (moğuni da cecxlisa msaxurni) and slayed those refusing to be baptized, puriied / sanctiied the religion of Christ (xolo Herak’le gancmida šĵuli Krist’esi), and streams of blood washed the churches (da ek’lesiata šina mdinareni sisxlisani diodes). Surprisingly, the text adds: “and the eristavi was the same Stepanoz the Great, and the Catholicos was Bartholomew for the second time” (da eristavobda igive didi Stepanoz da k’atalik’ozi iq’o Bartlome meored).
It seems that Heraclius carried out a massacre not only of Zoroastrians136 (and, perhaps, other non-Christians—note that the Jews are nowhere mentioned!—perhaps because there were no Jews in the town?), but also of Christians: all the Christians were rounded up into the churches which were washed with rivers of blood. I would suggest that this is an indication that many Georgians in Tbilisi at that point were not Orthodox, but rather Monophysite (or Nestorian?). And ater all that, Stepanoz became the ruler, and the Catholicos Bartholomew returned to his oice for the second time!137 he reference to the skin of the commander of the citadel sent to the king at Gardaban, to the place of Varaz-Grigol, is interesting. VarazGrigol was the Christian ruler of Caucasian Albania who collaborated with the Persians, just as Stepanoz had, but unlike him, Varaz-Grigol crossed the lines. When Heraclius stayed at Gardaban, he forced
136 On Heraclius’ agenda of converting the Persians, see C. Mango, “Deux études
sur Byzance et la Perse sassanide,” Travaux et Mémoires (Collège de France, Centre des
recherches d’histoire et de civilisation byzantines), 9, Paris 1985, pp. 91–118 (pp. 105–118:

Varaz-Grigol to accept the King’s (Monothelite) Orthodoxy.138 What was the point of sending the skin of the Persian oicer to (the place of) Varaz-Grigol? Was it not rather the skin of Stepanoz which was sent (as the version of KC would suggest), in order to intimidate the shaky Christian ally?
6.8 his suggestion is supported by another text to which we shall turn to presently. Another important source in Armenian is the History of the Caucasian Albanians by Movsēs Dasxuranc‘i (or Kałankatuac‘i, or Kałankaytuac‘i) of Uti.139 Caucasian Albania (or Ałuank‘) corresponds roughly to the nortern parts of the present Republic of Azerbaydjan, where a small Udi (or Udin, from *Uti) minority still survives, which belongs to the Armenian Church and speaks a “Daghestani” language. heir Udi language is believed to be derived from one of the dialects of the now extinct Caucasian Albanian / Ałuanian.140 Movsēs’ work was composed between the irst years of the eighth century and 958 C.E.141 and inally edited at the turn of the 11th–12th centuries.142 he chronology of this valuable Albano-Armenian source
138 Ater the Byzantine victories, Heraclius proceded baptizing anew the local Mono
physite Christians into his Chalcedonian Orthodoxy; according to Sambat, the son of
David, Varaz-Gregel was baptized by the Emperor (who took the old Hellene title of
Basileus) into the Greek Christianity, and it was only later that the Albanian Catholicos
Viroy re-baptized him back into the Armenian brand (M.I. Artamonov, Očerki drevnejšej

My understanding of the episode is in agreement with that of C. Toumanof, in his
review of Dowsett (BSOAS 25 (1962), pp. 364–366. C. Zuckerman (see K. Cukerman,

with Varaz-Grigol’s baptism very diferently.

Heraclius invited the Khazars to attack Albania, they ravaged it and, having seen the abundance of booty captured, “the prince their ruler” (išxann tērn noc‘a) decided to return the next year. Indeed, it occured in the 38th year of Husraw II (628), “the year of his murder,” when Ĵebow Xak‘an145 arrived with his son and an immense army of Mongoloid-looking hordes of the Northern barbarians (“of that ugly, insolent, broad-faced, eyelashless mob in the shape of women with dishevelled hair,” žantatesil žprheres laynadēm anartewanoun bazmout‘eann i jew igakan gisarjaks dimeals).146 Having destroyed the walls of Č‘ołay (Darband?) like a lood, he attacked Partaw and pillaged Albania. hen, he turned to Georgia and besieged “the luxurious, commercial, famous, and great city of Tbilisi” (zp‘ap‘kasoun vačarašah hrč‘akawor mec‘ k‘ałak‘n Tp‘łis).147 It was at this stage that “the Great Emperor” (Heraclius) joined his ally148—our Albanian source describes their meeting in one short phrase (“exchanging royal gits, they greatly

It is not clear from this account whether the Persians were successful in entering the besieged city, which the Byzantine engineers tried in the meantime to destroy by using balistras and other siege machines and attempting to make the River Kura (Georgian Mt’k’uari) overlow into the city. Exhausted, Heraclius tells the Khazars to lit the siege for the time being and return the next year. Seeing that, the besieged citizens began to parody the defeated; they brought a huge pumpkin upon which they drew a caricaturesque image of the “king of the Huns,” which stressed his Mongoloid features, and placed this ofensive image on the city wall; they also thrust a spear into the pumpkin, calling out to the Northern armies: “Behold Caesar, your king, turn and worship him, for he is Ĵebow Xak‘an“ (ahawasik Kaysr t‘agawors jer, owr kays, darjarouk‘ erkir pagēk‘ sma, Ĵebow Xak‘an ē ays); they also called “the other king,” apparently, Heraclius, “impure / ilthy and pederast;”149 this wording is similar to that of the corresponding slurs found in the Armenian translation of KC and in MK.150 However, the siege was lited. he two kings withdrew; ater that, according to Movsēs Dasxuranc‘i, “in the 36th year of Husraw” (626),151 Heraclius sent Andrē, one of his nobles, to the viceroy of the king of the North who was second to him in kingship and was called Jebou Xak‘an,152 urging him to invade Persia via the gates of Č‘ołay (Darband?) and promising them rich loot; the Northmen sent back to the royal palace an embassy with an élite force of a thousand warriors, broke through the passage of Č‘ołay, ignored by the Persian garrison, and arrived at the place where Heraclius was based to conclude an agreement with him.153 It is clear that the same story is

6.9 Again, it is not diicult to see that this last account is a repetition, taken uncritically from one of the sources which were before our compiler, resulting thus in creating the false impression that there were two sieges. his Albanian-Armenian version maintains that the defenders of the citadel mocked two rulers; there were two leaders of the defenders, and both were executed in a similar fashion. While the Georgian accounts avoided mentioning the humiliating death of their ruler (it is nowhere stated that Stepanoz was executed), the Albanian source had no reason to pass over the tragic fate of Stepanoz in silence, rather, omitting any reference to the humiliation forced on the Albanian king by Heraclius, Movsēs claims that the stufed skin of the neighbor and relative of the Albanian king was suspended from the top of the wall in Tbilisi, not sent to the Albanian king as a warning.

Heraclius, while in the Georgian sources, especially in the extant text of KC, the defenders mock the Emperor’s appearance, not his sexual behavior; this change of context is stressed by putting a Biblical quotation into the mouth of the Orthodox Basileus.159 According to the Georgian sources, Qal‘a, the fortress of Tbilisi, was captured in a few days ater Heraclius and his army departed for Babylon / Baghdad, i.e., Ctesiphon, while according to the afore-mentioned last account of the Albanian Chronicle, the capture of the city by the Šat‘ was achieved in two months and this happened a year later (629 C.E.), only ater Husraw has been killed in a conspiracy.
6.11 To sum up, it is clear that the Albanian author had more than one source at his disposal, and that his text, whilst garbled, is more complete. As to the Georgian versions of the account about the siege of their capital, they are, however, secondary, and perhaps they are dependent upon the same sources as the Albanian History. At present, it would not be prudent to try to establish a deinitive chronology of the events of the last Byzantino-Persian war in Transcaucasia.
6.12 Some Armenian chronicles repeat, in an abbreviated manner, the account of the History of Albania concerning the siege of Tbilisi (such as the mid-13th century author Kirakos Ganjakec‘i),160 while others (like John Drasxanakertc‘i, following thus Sebēos), whilst referring to Heraclius’ res gesta, omit the episode of the siege.161 he account of Kirakos Ganjakec‘i, e.g. (ch. I, pp. 52–3), is as follows: Heraclius with xak‘an, the Khazar king, invaded Persia. he citizens of Tbilisi mocked the xak‘an alone, and shot at the pumpkin, which was supposed to be a caricature of him. Because this was in the winter season, the Khazar king could not do anything; it seems that the siege was lited. In the spring the xak‘an came

7.0 he History of Albania contains an interesting episode: in 681, Varaz-Trdat, the Christian prince of Albania, which was sufering badly from both the Arabs and “Huns” (Khazars?), sent bishop Israel to the Northern barbarians to negotiate a peace agreement. Ater a long journey lasting about six weeks, Israel arrived in “the magniicent town of Varač‘an,”163 the Hun capital. Israel depicted these “Huns” as tree-worshippers, ofering horses to T‘angri-Xan, “called Aspandiat (*Spandidād / Spandiyār) by the Persians.”164 Israel succeeded in converting their prince Alp‘ Ilut‘uēr and many “Huns,” who asked the Armenian Catholicos to give them Israel as their Patriarch, but their request was denied.165 In fact, this was not the irst Christian mission among the Northern nomads. In the irst half of the 6th century, an Armenian mission of the Bishop Kardost baptized many North Caucasian Huns and a writing system for their Hunnic speech was developed.166 However, Drasxanakertc‘i and Asołik167 report that in the seventh year of Sahak,

164 His account contains what was seen as another Iranian element in their religious
vocabulary, namely a lightning-god K‘uar-xan in which the Persian for “sun” was looked
for by some scholars, or a Turkic word which supposingly means “the heavenly man,”
by others, though I personally, judging from the context and following W. Henning’s
insight, would prefer to see here the Persian word for “charisma” (*xvarr); it was perhaps
a Persian translation of the Turkic term qut, used here either by Israel, or by Movsēs. In
February 2002, during the Second International Khazar Colloquium in Moscow (Koro
liov), Professor M. Qaraqetov suggested a possible connection with the Qaračay-Malkar
word for ‘lightning, storm’ (kюрюў, kърю, kъуары, kъауар-хан), apparently of sub
stratal origin.
165 It is of uppermost importance that Movsēs described the Northern barbarians in
681 as “Huns,” not “Khazars,” though we know now that the Khazar Qaganate was estab
lished ca. 678–680. On the other hand, an Albanian Catholicos Israel is known to have
served in 677–687. One might wonder whether the chronology of Movsēs is wrong and
the mission of Israel, the “bishop,” took place not in 681, but before 677?

8.0 We shall now return to two episodes which should be dated to about a century later than the mission of Bishop Israel.
8.1 he Martyrdom of Abo of Tbilisi169 was written by John Sabanidze [Sabanije] at the request of the Catholicos Samuel (between 785–790 C.E.).170 Kartli was then a vassal of the Arabs, and Tbilisi was a predominantly Muslim town with an Arab garrison. In 775, the new Khalīfa, al-Mahdī (775–785), declared amnesty for all prisoners, and the local Kartlian ruler, Narsē, who had been kept in Baghdad for three years under Abū Dja far (754–775), returned to his country. He was accompanied by a well-educated Arab youth, named, in all probability, Habīb,171 whose name survived only in a shortened Georgian form, Habo, or Abo. Abo settled in Tbilisi, learned Georgian, and became close to Christianity. Narsē intended to rid his country of its Arab masters, and was planning a revolt. He counted on Khazar support and to keep them safe, sent

168 he question has been asked whether Israel’s mission was Jakobite or Monothe
lite; however, the cruelty of the Khazar invasion failed to produce any Christological
distinctions or demonstrate preferences of any sorts, see V.M. Lur’je, “Okolo “Solunskoj

6 January 786. See M. Bíró, M., “Marwān ibn Muhammad’s Georgian Campaign,” Acta

his family to relatives, the royal family of Western Georgia, called then Abkhazia (which included Pontos-Lazica).172 his country was then a vassal of Byzantium, having, at the same time, strong Khazar connections, to the extent that it was sometimes called in Georgian sources the “Lesser Xazareti.” he mother of Leon II, king of Abkhazia, was the Khazar Qagan’s daughter, and Leon’s uncle was another Leo, the Byzantine Emperor called Leo the Khazar (ruled 775–780). Shortly ater the events described in Abo’s Vita, Abkhazia became, whilst backed by Khazaria, formally independent from Byzantium. Narsē, with 300 men, including Abo, led to Khazaria with the aim of asking military support from the Qağan against the Arabs. His route was via the Gate of Ovseti, Darialani (Dar ī Âlān, Bāb al-Lān). We do not know where he met the King of the North, i.e., the Khazar Qagan, but it was certainly not in the Crimea, as one of the former students of the text has suggested.173 here were Christians in Khazaria, and it was there that Abo was formally converted. Alhough Narsē enjoyed the Qagan’s hospitality, his mission was unsuccessful. he Khazars denied him military support, and Narsē, with Abo and his entourage, moved to Abkhazia. It took him 3 months to arrive there,174 while he was passing through the territory of pagan nomads. Nevertheless, in 782 Narsē was able to come to terms with the Arabs and was allowed to return to Kartli. It seems that the Arabs were quite sure that there was no chance of Khazar action in support of Kartli.175 Ater al-Mahdī died in August 4, 785, Arab attitudes towards Caucasian Christians changed and Abo, an apostate to Islam, was arrested on August 27, and executed on January 6, 786, ater he had been allowed to live as a Christian in a Muslim town for some three years. Later, he was canonized. What is important in the description of Khazar ways of life in the last quarter of the eighth century as found in Abo’s Vita are the following observations: the “Khazars Sons of Magog” were Mongoloid (sašinel p’irita, “with horrible faces”), pagan (“having no religious law”), blood

eating and savage (k‘ac velur). However, there is no bias in Sabanije’s description; they worshipped the Creator (šemokmedi), the Turkic God of Heavens Täŋri.176 According to Muslim authors, irst of all, al-Kūfī, in 737, Marwān defeated the Khazars on the nahr al-Saqāliba (identiied by many scholars with the Volga) and attacked Sarīr, and consequently, the Qagan converted, though for a short period of time, to Islam. Marwān let Transcaucasia, in all probability, in 743;177 according to Dunlop, Jewish Khazars, p. 170, the religious debate in which a rabbi prevailed over a monk and an Imam took place circa 740, and subsequently, it was ater that date that the so-called “irst stage of the Judaization” of the Khazars, into a “primitive Biblical Mosaism” occurred. However, this irst-hand description of the Khazar way of life in 780–1 found in our Georgian source should be noted by those who still believe that the Khazars were already converted to one of the monotheistic religions. “Having no religious law” and “eating blood” hardly characterizes Judaism (or, even “primitive Biblical Mosaism”) and Islam.178
176 Jveli kartuli agiograp’iuli literaturis jeglebi, pp. 58.9–11.
177 Before invading Khazaria though the Alanian Gate, i.e., via Georgia, Marwān
ibn Muhammad laid waste to Kartli. Cf. KC I, pp. 241–4; see also Bíró, “Marwān ibn
Muhammad’s Georgian Campaign.” Marwān ibn Muhammad was called in Georgian
sources Murvan Q’ru, “the Deaf,” on account of his cruelty; such usage of “deaf ” for a
tyrannical ruler, kūr in Middle Persian, to which the Georgian word is related, has an
exact parallel in Pahlavi sources.
178 he “second stage of the Judaization,” the installation of Rabbinical Judaism in
Khazaria, occurred, according to Dunlop, Jewish Khazars, p. 170, circa 800, for accord
ing to Muslim sources, Judaism was adopted by the Khazars during the rule of Hārūn
al-Rašīd (786–809). Our Georgian source makes this entire reconstruction impossible
and leaves no time-space for these “two stages of the Judaization.” According to C. Zuck
erman, “On the Date of the Khazars’ Conversion to Judaism and the Chronology of the
Kings of the Rus’ Oleg and Igor,” Revue des Études Byzantines 53 (1995), pp. 237–270,
p. 250, there was only one “stage in Judaization,” ater the Cyril-Constantine Debate of
861 (and, I would add, ater the Danube Bulgars converted to Christianity, leaving thus
no alternative to their Khazar foes but Judaism; thus, it is of interest that Druthmar
of Aquitaine, a Benedictine monk at Corvey in Westphalia, who wrote his “Expositio
in Matthaeum Evangelistam” (see J.-P. Migne (ed.), Patrologiae cursus completus, Series
Latina, Vol. 106 (Paris 1864), col. 1456) circa 864, considered it necessary to contrast
Khazar Judaism to the Bulgar conversion to Christianity (compare now D. Shapira, “Bul

zarskij Almanakh Vol. I (Proceedings of the hird International Khazar Colloquium),

ascribed to the Jewish-Khazar re-interpretation of the Täŋri-cult as a form of primitive
Monotheism seen as equal to Judaism, see now Shapira, “Judaization of Central Asian
Traditions as Relected in the so-called Jewish-Khazar Correspondence . . .” Khazars, ed.

We do read in our text about Khazar religious tolerance (“there are towns and villages in the Land of the North, whose inhabitants live freely in the faith of Christ”), but we hear nothing about Khazar Jews in our Vita. here were Christians in Khazaria, and it was possible for a Muslim to convert to Christianity in Khazaria. here was a bishop at Atil (ho Astēl), whose seat was established between 733–746,179 and Abo probably converted there, while he was staying with his master, Narsē, at “the camp of the seat of the Sons of Magog the Khazars,” by which probably the Qagan’s horde, Atil, is meant.180
8.2 he Book of Kartli, a section of KC, begins with a touching story describing an event181 the precise date of which is a matter of debate.182 he young king of Kachetia Ĵuanšer, the son of the martyr king Arč‘il (d. 786), had four sisters—Goranduxt, Mariam, Mihranduxt and Šušan. he xakan king of the Khazars asked for the hand of Šušan as his wife, promising to help the Georgians against the Arabs. Ĵuanšer sought the advice of his brother, John the king of Western Georgia, his mother, and the sisters, who answered him that it is better to go to Greece, to his fellow Christians, than to be polluted by heathens. his would imply that in the second half of the eighth century the Qagans were still pagan. However, the xakan, some three years later, dispatched to Georgia his general (spasalar) Bluč‘an, who ravaged the country and took Ĵuanšer and Šušan prisoner. Whilst en route to Khazaria, Šušan poisoned herself. Bluč‘an, accompanied by Ĵuanšer, came to the xakan, who became angry that Bluč‘an had not at least brought Šušan’s body, and the general was executed in the manner attested in the milieu of Khazars and their

8.3 his small episode, nevertheless, has aroused a considerable volume of studies, for a rather fortuitous reason. he general’s name was too similar to the name of the irst Jewish “king” of Khazaria, Bulan, and some scholars, trying to establish a Khazar chronology, were naturally tempted to compare the name of Bulan with that of the unfortunate general, or even to suggest that they represent the same person. In fact, the printed text has not Bluč‘an, but Gluč‘an, with the letters b and g being very similar, and in the manuscript tradition there exist some other forms. here is also another, third, person with a similar name: in 901, a Khazar king K.SÂ b.

9.1 It would seem that the gradual penetration of Khazar, Hunnic and other Northern groups into Transcaucasia went along with their violent inroads, as is well attested by our Georgian, Armenian and Arabic sources. In many cases, the Northern settlers adopted the local religion, Christian or Muslim, but it is never stated that the settlers were, or became, Jews. In fact, as already stated, there is absolutely no direct reference to Judaism among the Khazars in our Armenian or Georgian sources.
9.2 However, the Armenian and Georgian sources report on the earliest stages of Northern settlement in Transcaucasia together with their reports of Jewish settlement. here are three possible explanations for this: 1) the sources combine all the immigrations together, telling us about all newcomers, whether they are connected or not; b) the sources preserve traditions that (some of) the Northern settlers professed Judaism; c) combining the legends about the settlement of Northerners in Transcaucasia with the legendary accounts about Jewish immigration, the sources, “remembered,“ so to say, that Judaism was once practiced in the countries from which the Northern settlers came.

THE STORY OF A EUPHEMISM: THE KHAZARS IN RUSSIAN NATIONALIST LITERATURE*
Victor A. Shnirelman
he history of the Khazars is still obscure; their large state, which encompassed up to the half of Eastern Europe more than a thousand years ago, has completely disappeared leaving no precise legitimate heirs. Historical data on the Khazars are scarce and fragmentary permitting very different interpretations. Over the last few decades all the new data on the Khazars were provided by archaeology, the materials from which made it possible to build up various reconstructions. he latter are oten in conlict with each other and with those based on the written sources. As a result, scholars have developed very contradictory views of the Khazars, their political structure and culture, as well as their role in Early Medieval Eastern Europe. hose beliefs nourish by no means the minds of scholars alone. Over the last few decades, they have been proitably used by Russian chauvinists for geopolitical and historiographic constructions aimed at discovering a would be negative Jewish role in the development of many peoples of the world. To put it another way, they manipulate the very scarce and obscure historical and archaeological data as well as doubtful and poorly based hypotheses in order to conirm a priori reasoning and conclusions, which might have far-reaching ethnopolitical consequences today. In this respect one should talk of the anti-Semitic “Khazar myth” being developed by our contemporaries, both scholars and amateur authors, picked up by mass media, and purposefully imposed upon the general public. his paper focuses on various aspects of this multi-faced mythology. When in the early 1990s I began my studies of contemporary Russian nationalism, I was amazed at the frequency of references to the Khazars in literature produced by the Russian radical politicians. Soon I realized that I was not alone. he American analyst Walter Laqueur was also

surprised to learn that in the very late 1980s Russian nationalists were ixated on the “Khazar episode.”1 For them the Khazar issue seemed to be a crucial one. hey treated it as the irst historically documented case of the imposition of a foreign yoke on the Slavs, drawing a close analogy with the “foreign yoke” imposed on Russia from 1917 on. hey were especially alarmed because the Khazars ruled the southern part of Eastern Europe before the Kievan Rus’ state had emerged, i.e. before the Eastern Slavs developed their own state organization. Even worse, the Khazar nobility converted to Judaism. hose historic facts provided an appropriate pretext for arguing that Jewish intrigues and dominance were to be found from the very beginning of Russian history. In this context the term “Khazars” became popular as a euphemism for the so-called “Jewish occupation regime.” It is the problem of the power of euphemisms, or the covert language of hatred, that I would like to address. he Soviet epoch was rich in euphemisms, allegories and equivocal statements, which, on the one hand, provided the interlocutor with necessary information, and on the other hand, permitted him to avoid being persecuted for saying things that could be interpreted as a crime. Euphemisms were extensively used by the dissident authors including the Russian nationalists. During the period of Perestroika, state antiSemitism disappeared from the USSR. At the same time, abolition of censorship and the new freedom of speech made it possible to express dissident or radical thoughts openly. he anti-Semitic movements, which had developed underground previously, went public and were able to carry on their propaganda legally.2 At the same time, in the new, liberal environment only a few people and groups dared associate themselves openly with anti-Semitism. First, such an attitude was not approved by the mainstream of Russian society; second, one could be taken to court for an “attempting to stir up national discord and religious intolerance” with respect to the relevant article of the Russian Criminal Code. Even though this article was rarely invoked and few were sentenced for this



the story of a euphemism 355
sort of crime, many contemporary anti-Semites preferred to avoid the risk. herefore, they tended to present their ideas in the form of euphemisms and allegories. hus, they discussed “Khazar expansionism” and the “Khazar enslavement” of the Slavs rather than writing openly about the Jewish “iniltration” of the Soviet regime and contemporary Russia. Some anti-Semitic publications went so far as to discuss quite openly the role of “Aesopian” (i.e. allegorical) language in their propaganda.3 In this paper I will discuss several diferent approaches to the Khazar issue developed by the Russian chauvinists based on their evaluation of the socio-political situation in general. I argue that one has to distinguish between Neo-Eurasianists, Russian Orthodox nationalists, Neo-pagans, open racists, and some other factions within contemporary Russian nationalism, all of them sharing anti-Semitic feelings. Contemporary anti-Semites oten feign indignation when criticized. Metropolitan Ioann and his spokesman, for example, have, on a number of occasions, indignantly rejected as “provocation” the accusation of the Metropolitan of anti-Semitism.4 he anti-Semites employ several ruses to avoid or to reject this sort of accusation. First, as the Russian antiSemitic discourse demonstrates, contemporary anti-Semites claim that they do not attack the Jews as such but only oppose the most “harmful” ones among them, who strive for world supremacy. Various anti-Semites deine this group in diferent ways. For Vadim Kozhinov, they are the habers or havers [perhaps connecting the Hebrew word “haverim” with “Hebrews.” V.Sh.], the heirs of the ancient Pharisees [with this term retaining its anti-Semitic connotations from the Christian New Testament]. For Douglas Reed and his numerous followers, they are the Ashkenazim, who are allegedly descended from the Khazars and have no relation to the true Jews or the Semites in general.5 For ighters against “international Zionism,” like Apollon Kuz’min, the enemy is the “misanthropic” Zionist ideology and its adherents.

associated with the Kolokol newspaper, it is the “kike-internationalists” whom they sometimes distinguish from the “good” Jews. Viktor Kandyba distinguishes between the “Volga Russes,” or “Russo-Jews,” who seemed good, and [Jewish] “foreigners” and “traders,” who are blamed for all kinds of dishonest deeds. Recently Kandyba came up with a new, euphemistic term of abuse—“Rusalims,” which he evidently derived from “Jerusalem.”6 Over the last three decades or so, the Russian chauvinists and antiSemites commonly used two terms, the “Khazars” and “ethnic chimera,” for both the Jews and their “negative” role in Russian history. he term “ethnic chimera” was coined by the historian Lev Gumilev. Another term, “the Khazars,” was common among the Russian émigrés of the irst wave and began to spread in Russia since the turn of the 1970s. Evidently, it was brought to the USSR by somebody who, like the artist Ilia Glazunov, was sympathetic toward the Russian nationalists, used to go abroad frequently and established close contacts with some Russian émigrés there. However, the term received a true full life due to Gumilev as well, which leads us to a discussion of the scholars’ role in the development of new sorts of racism and anti-Semitism. Indeed, it was Gumilev, who introduced the Khazar myth to the Russian audience, and his works are very popular in contemporary Russia. While identifying “ethnos,” i.e. an ethnic group, with a biological organism, Gumilev maintained that “super-ethnoses” were always inherently connected with speciic natural environments of particular regions and that their components (“ethnoses” and “sub-ethnoses”) developed within their own ecological niches. herefore, there was logically no reason for their competition for vital resources and they were, hence, inclined to cooperate rather than to confront each other. By contrast, an alien ethnic group of newcomers that was related to another “superethnos” was unable to ind an appropriate natural niche in the new area and, instead, began to exploit local inhabitants. For such groups Gumilev coined the term “chimera.” He compared chimeras to parasitic animals or to cancers, which throve by consuming the organism that gave them refuge. He argued that chimeras extracted vital resources from the local ethnos by “employing the technique of lying.”7 Usually,

the story of a euphemism 357
Gumilev reasoned, chimeric entities developed at the junction of two “super-ethnoses” and this particular area turned into a zone of disaster. In other words, “the Eurasian concept of ethnocultural regions and chimeric entities in marginal zones proved appropriate for the interpretation of global historical processes. Where two or more super-ethnoses clash with each other, there disaster increases and the logic of creative processes breaks down.”8 To put it other way, a sharing of the same geographical space by two diferent ethnic groups would invariably have a fatal result. his approach has an obvious ainity to that of the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg who claimed already in the 1920s: “If two or more Weltanschauungen, derived from diferent highest values, occupy a common place in time or space, and each Weltanschauung is meant to be shared by a common group of people, this signiies the existence of an unhealthy palliative which bears within itself the germs of a new collapse.” He argued that this caused a decline of the subjugated cultural entities (“cultural souls”).9 Evidently, this is an ideological justiication of genocide. Its message was clariied by another admirer of metahistorical constructions, Adolph Hitler, in a following way: “he Jew . . . was never a nomad, but only and always a parasite in the body of other peoples . . . Where he appears, the host people dies out ater a shorter or longer period . . .”10 To complete this set of quotations I would like to refer to one more and the last “think tank,” on this occasion to Pavel Globa, a well known advocate of the “Aryan astrology” in contemporary Russia. He teaches us: “Lacking in creative power, Evil is a parasitic germ exploiting more perfect systems, destroying them or otherwise being rejected by them if they contain healthy agents.”11 Isn’t this a metaphoric expression of the same hatred? he Nazi ideology was based on biological racism, which is unpopular nowadays. Yet, it is efectively replaced by cultural racism, which refers to some allegedly innate cultural features like archetypes, cultural codes or modes of behavior. For example, according to Dina Porat, the Islamic fundamentalists depict “the Jew as negative and incorrigible in every respect, demonstrating the same vile character traits that he had

supposedly displayed in Arabia in the days of the prophet Muhammad.”12 A similar idea was deeply embedded into the Gumilev’s theory of the “chimera.” his approach is also common for the New Right movements in contemporary Europe, and similar ideas are conquering Russia nowadays being based on popular primordialist views of “ethnos” and nation. In this context, the slogan of multiculturalism is oten used to legitimate dominance and discrimination with references to “cultural distinctions” and “ethnic roots.” his sort of “multiculturalism” explains modern ethnic conlicts through references to essential “cultural diferences” and “archetypes,” as if they were inherited from prehistoric or early historic ancestors. It is sad that it is in this form that cultural racism is carving its way into the new Russian school textbooks. he Khazar myth plays an important role in this development. Gumilev’s Neo-Eurasian concept of “ethnic chimera” identiied Khazaria with an “aggressive Judaism” and suggested that it be treated as a “zigzag in history” similar to another one, which occurred in Russia ater the October revolution.13 To be sure, Gumilev himself avoided these sorts of analogies. But his thoughtful students understood quite well the secret message of their supervisor, and during the last iteen years or so they made every efort to bring that to the general public. One of them, a Novgorod writer Dmitri M. Balashov (1927–2000), was certain that wherever the Jews came they immediately tried to seize power and to subjugate the natives as it happened in Khazaria.14 Others, V. Ermolaev and K. Ivanov, treated Communism as an “anti-system ideology,” i.e. a chimera, which emerged as a result of a clash between two super-ethnoses with diferent potentials—the Jewish one and the Great Russian one.15 To put it diferently, it is clear to Gumilev’s students and followers that a harmful “chimera” comes into being inevitably at the juncture between the “Jewish super-ethnos” and a European or Eurasian one; that this

“chimera” ruined Russia in the 20th century; that her encroachment upon Russia is only a part of the Jewish plot aiming at world supremacy; and inally, that Khazaria was an explicit manifestation and a proof of the reality of this everlasting conspiracy. It is diicult to disregard the close links between this concept and an approach to world history, which was worked out by Soviet critics of “World Zionism” from the late 1960s on.16 Another of Gumilev’s admirers, the literary critic Vadim V. Kozhinov (1930–2001), suggested that the “Khazar yoke” was much more dangerous for Rus’ than the Mongol one since Rus’ was still shaping itself at that time. He represented Khazaria as a “permanent, persistent and peridious” enemy of Rus’. In order to demonstrate that the struggle against the Khazars was a very heavy burden for Rus’ he, in contrast to what all other Russian scholars said previously, claimed that Prince Sviatoslav’s campaign of 965 against the Khazars was the beginning of a long continuous struggle, and that Khazar dominance was destroyed only by the mid-11th century. Ultimately, all of his reasonings aimed at the unmasking of “militant Khazar Judaism, which tried to enslave Rus’. ” his was the main goal of Kozhinov’s studies, which went far beyond Early Medieval issues that were under discussion.17 he message of the Kozhinov’s publications becomes clear from his contention, which at irst glance has nothing to do with his discussion: “at the time of mass terror in Russia in 1918–1953 there were almost no ethnic Russians among people making crucial decisions. When, just ater Stalin’s death, the Russians came to power for the irst time since 1917, the terror stopped immediately.”18 For Kozhinov himself this sort of digressions is of great importance: it has a “deep relationship with a remote past, which is discussed in my work,” he noted. For example, he discovered a term “comrade” (habr) among the Jewish Khazars, and believed that this provided him with a basis to “establish a direct link between the 8th and 20th centuries.” Moreover, Kozhinov discovered these “comrades” in Judea and identiied them with Pharisees; he

believed that they made a sect, which possessed secret knowledge and despised commoners.19 It is noteworthy that Kozhinov himself emphatically protested against the characterization of his “Khazar” constructions as anti-Semitic. No, he claimed, he was not against the Jews as such; but one had to struggle against an “aggressive policy and ideology of International Zionism.” he true enemies are the “habers,” i.e. a “particular social-ideological segment of the Jewish ethnos, which aims at economic, political and ideological domination both over the Jewish people and the rest of the ‘peoples of the Earth,’—that was manifested so clearly in history of the Khazar Khanate.” And, seemingly, to avoid misunderstanding, Kozhinov accused the Jews of the revolution of 1917 and of the extermination of the best people of Russia.20 Kozhinov made the blasphemous accusation against Jewish leaders that at the time of the Second World War they rescued the habers from the slaughter while deciding who in particular could be sent to the death camps and who should not. He needed all of this in order to “understand perfectly well the historic role of the Khazar Khanate a thousand years before.”21 It is in this way that a forgotten, remote history turned into a very urgent contemporary issue. hus, the Neo-Eurasian approach treats Khazaria as a telling case of the chimera. It argues that the chimeras harmed Russia throughout its entire history and, especially in the 20th century due to a destructive Jewish activity as though this was a crucial aspect of the Jewish struggle for world supremacy. A theory of “chimera” its in perfectly well with the campaign waged by Russian nationalists against “World Zionism.” In fact, Gumilev coined a euphemism for “World Zionism”—nowadays the term “chimera” is oten used in this particular context. Actually, the theory of “chimera” combines Christian anti-Semitism (the idea of an eternal struggle of Judaism against Christianity) with racism (the idea of some eternal inborn characteristics of the Jews).

the story of a euphemism 361
A message of Orthodox anti-Semitism, which was innate in Kozhinov’s concept, was picked up in the early 1990s by the late Ioann (19271995), then the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga. His view of Russian history is interesting for, irst, in contrast to Church tradition, it included the “Khazar episode” as a crucial point in Russian history, and second, it is quite popular among various groups of contemporary Russian nationalists besides the Orthodox ones. Khazaria was represented as the irst victim of “Jewish businessmen, who considered inancial power as a irst step towards the formation of a long-desired world Jewish state, which the Talmudist-Rabbis taught.” he Russian state was fated to be the next victim doomed to be integrated into the Khazar Khanate or to become a new “Judeanized” state of the Khazaria-type. In view of this scary perspective, the Jewish trade in Slavic slaves seemed to be almost an innocent amusement.22 Like the other builders of the Khazar myth, Ioann was interested in Khazaria not merely for itself but with respect to the world historical process. In the “religious war persistently and continuously waged by Judaism against the Christian Church in the course of two millennia” he saw the “roots of numerous cataclysms which violated Russian life throughout the centuries.”23 he irst cataclysm was caused by the Slavic relationship with the Khazar Khanate. To put it briely, the Russian Orthodox nationalists associate Khazaria’s image with a spiritual enslaving of Rus’ and a struggle against Christian statehood. his is treated as an aspect of a general permanent struggle of Judaism against Christianity. Whereas the Orthodox anti-Semites consider the Khazars the bitter enemies of Christianity, the contemporary Russian Neo-pagans provide them with a reverse image. Indeed, for the Neo-pagans the major world evil is represented by Christianity as though the latter was deliberately created by the Jews in order to enslave all the other peoples. In this context the “Khazar episode” acquires an especially frightening meaning. he Russian Neo-pagan historiography was elaborated by Valery Emelianov (1929–1999) well-known for his pathological anti-Semitism.

For him, the essence of world history was a struggle to the death for world supremacy between Zionists (i.e. the Jews) and Masons, on the one hand, and all the rest of humanity headed by the Aryans, on the other hand, and a peridious plan of the struggle was worked out by king Solomon himself.24 Emelianov maintained that Christianity created by the Jews to enslave all the rest of mankind was a powerful tool in the Zionists’ hands. An especially important point for our discussion is that Emelianov managed to “discover” Jewish blood in Prince Vladimir, the baptiser of Rus’.25 What was the fault of Prince Vladimir, why is he disliked by the Neopagans so much? It is not diicult to solve this puzzle. While seeing no serious diference between Judaism and Christianity, Emelianov maintained that baptism of Rus’ by Prince Vladimir and the Russian revolution of 1917 were the most disastrous events in all of Russian history. “Indeed, in 988 A.D. International Zion managed to crush the main and actually the last center of Aryan ideology of those days, and to replace it with the reformed, or, more correctly, Esperantized Judaism in the form of the eastern branch of Christianity, i.e. Orthodoxy.” hus, the Russian people were deprived of their Aryan history, ideology and culture. How did it happen that the Russian Prince began the implementation of this “Devil’s plan”? For Emelianov this was hardly a surprise: indeed, he believed that the Russian Prince had a Jewish mother, and his grandfather was closely connected with the Khazar Khanate, which occupied and mercilessly exploited genuine Russian territories.26 While picking up Emelianov’s discovery, another Neo-pagan antiSemite from St.-Petersburg, Viktor Bezverkhii (1930–2000), maintained that just before the baptism of Rus’, the Jews deliberately introduced a cult of primitive idols and bloody sacriices in order to struggle against this cult later on and to impose a “slavish Christian ideology.” It is in this way that they took revenge for the devastation of Khazaria.27 It is worth mentioning, that since the 1970s an idea of the “Khazar” origin and “undermining activity” of Prince Vladimir was deeply embedded into the Neo-pagan myth and continuously included into respective popular and pseudo-scholarly literature.

For the Neo-pagans, the “Khazar episode,” however long ago it took place, sounds like the present day and afects evaluations of contemporary events. An idea that is widespread among the Neo-pagans is that the Jews still cannot forgive Russians for the destruction of the Khazar Khanate.28 In this way, they explain why the Jews are eager to take revenge. his is illuminated by the following passage from the Bezverkhii’s book: “the descendants of the Khazar Kikes—the AshkenaziKikes—through the conclusion of the Belovezhie agreement in 1991, destroyed the Slavic empire, which was built more than 1,000 years ago.”29 hus, in view of the contemporary anti-Semites there is an unbroken chain, which links the “Khazar episode” with the present day. In general, the contemporary Russian Neo-pagans continue the antireligious struggle of the Soviet atheists against Christianity and depict the latter in black colors only. At the same time, they make extensive use of the heritage of Soviet criticisms of “World Zionism” and represent Christianity as a harmful ideology built by peridious Jews in order to enslave peoples all over the world. In this context, Khazaria’s image acquires a new, fantastic meaning as an outpost of aggressive Judaism making every efort to enslave Rus’ through the introduction of Christianity. his concept has a racist lavor, relating would be negative Jewish characteristics to their blood. Signiicantly, the Neo-pagan approach seems attractive to some contemporary Communist groups who, not unreasonably, appreciate its continuity with the former Soviet ideology based on the state anti-Semitism. Many contemporary anti-Semites appreciate an hypothesis proclaiming the origin of the Eastern European Jews from the Turkic Khazars. It was picked up and developed by an anti-Semite, Douglas Reed, who lived far away from the turmoil in Russia. He tried to demonstrate that the Eastern European Jews with their “destructive instincts” had nothing to do with virtuous and loyal Western Jews. he “Khazar theory” perfectly itted this idea. But Reed enriched it with a racist approach, which was embedded in his discussion of “the savages from the remote Asiatic hinterland” whose rude “instincts” survived through the ages. He accused the “descendants of the Khazars” of all of the European revolutions of the last 500 years.30

he irst edition of Reed’s book came out in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1986. It was published in Russian, hence, intended for a Russian audience. Today, one can say that it fulilled its mission. It arrived in Russia at an opportune time when a “worthy” audience was already there. For the irst time, the book was republished in Russia by a popular Krasnodar magazine “Kuban” by early 1992. By that time, the Soviet Union had inally collapsed, the anti-Russian mood on its fringes had reached a climax, and many ethnic Russians who lived in non-Russian republics or side by side with non-Russian populations were frustrated and anxious while discovering a rapidly growing alienation between themselves and their neighbors. he Kuban was one such region where the Russians lived in close proximity with the Adygeis and other North Caucasian peoples. he relationships between the Russians and nonRussians became rather tense, and the Russian chauvinists tried to throw the blame on the “undermining activity” of “World Zionism.” his gave a special lavor to the environment in which Russia became acquainted with Reed’s book. It is worth noting that the “Kuban” magazine published the book in a shortened version, and only those chapters were included, which narrated prejudicially of the allegedly harmful and destructive Jewish activity. It goes without saying that chapter 17 was among them, the latter part of which discussed the Khazar origin of the Eastern European Jews. In order to provide the reader with a completely “clear pattern” the editorial board added a special appendix where extracts of the Torah were compared with New Testament texts. hey aimed at making the reader familiar with the “misanthropic” essence of Judaism as if the latter demanded for annihilation of all the peoples in the world.31 he “Kuban” edition was appreciated. It was picked up by the wellknown Moscow anti-Semite Viktor Korchagin, then a head of the racist Russian Party of Russia, whose “Vitiaz’ ” Publishing House specialized in the publication of Neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic literature in Moscow. While republishing Reed’s book ater “Kuban” magazine’s edition, Korchagin shortened it even further. He extracted the “Khazar” reasoning of Reed’s chapter 17 and organized a special chapter under the title “the Khazars” (which was non-existent in the Reed’s book!). To put it diferently, Korchagin considered worthy of publication only those parts of
31 Rid (Reed), Douglas. “Spor o Sione,” Kuban’, 1991, October–December.



the story of a euphemism 365
Reed’s book which discussed the Khazars, their relations with the Ashkenazi Jews and the Jewish role in “three revolutions”—English, French and Russian. Korchagin’s edition especially emphasized that the Russian revolution occurred “under Talmudic-Jewish leadership.” Moreover, Korchagin borrowed an idea from an appendix from the “Kuban” magazine: he included there not only extracts from the Torah but also a well-known fabrication, “Adolf Hitler’s Will,” and extracts from the anti-Semitic pamphlet “International Jewry” by Henry Ford. All of this was meant to scare readers with terrible Jewish plans to exterminate the humanity.32 Furthermore, the Russian chauvinist-anti-Semites were fascinated with another book irst published in New York in 1982 by a Russian émigré under the pseudonym V. Ushkuinik (1896–1989). Like Reed, he accused the Jews and Masons of subversive revolutionary movements, in particular, of hostile activity against the Russian Empire. He saw the roots of these inclinations in a “racial instinct.” Ater presenting a frightening pattern of “Jewish superabundance” in the USSR, the author queried why that became possible? In searching for an answer he turned to the theory of the “Khazar” origin of Eastern European Jewry. He recalled the Jewish Khazars’ encroachments upon ancient Rus’ and was in raptures with Prince Sviatoslav’s feat. Further on, he reproduced Arthur Koestler’s idea that the Judaized Turkic-speaking Khazars who led from the defeat constituted the foundation for the Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. While being neophytes, they demonstrated even more zeal toward Judaism than the true Semites. Hence, their unprecedented cruelty toward Gentiles.33 While developing this theory, Ushkuinik enriched it with a new “discovery.” He argued that these “Khazars” maintained their political organization based on double kingship up to the present day. Addressing an unexacting and ignorant reader, he reversed the true pattern and made the Khaqan, instead of the Beg, the possessor of real power. He needed this argument in order to represent Lazar M. Kaganovich as the “direct heir of Khazaria’s khans” under whom Stalin played the role of a dumb Beg. It goes without saying that this makes an excuse for all Stalin’s criminal deeds. he “ritual murder accusation” was also used:

the author made an analogy between the Khazar custom of the ritual murder of their khaqans and the “ritual murder” of the last Russian emperor.34 he book concluded with that “in the mid-20th century the Eastern Jews managed to restore a system of power, which worked in their native Khazaria around the 10th century, but in the form of Russian quasi-Communism.”35 Evgenii Evseev (1932–1990), a well-known critic of the “World Zionism,” was inspired by Ushkuinik’s book to complete his own book “A Satrap” focused on unmasking of Lazar’ Kaganovich’s criminal activity. Adding to his own merit, the author emphasized that he was the irst who paid attention to the “confessional-ethnic character” of this man as though that was a clue to the behavior of the “closest companion of Stalin.”36 While making “etymological studies,” Evseev became interested in Kaganovich’s last name and related it to the term “khaqan,” which meant a “priest” and was a title of “Khazaria’s ruler.” Starting with that, Evseev made a trip to the history of Khazaria and maintained that the Ashkenazi were the “descendants of the Khazars rather than the Semites.” In the rest of the book Evseev did not return to the Khazar Khanate and its real ruler any further. But the latter’s spirit persistently accompanied the reader who saw Kaganovich in no other way but as “a gray cardinal” responsible for but all the criminal deeds of the Stalin’s regime against own people.37 Yet, the author recognized that Stalin more than anybody else was a key character in Soviet leadership.38 To put it briely, while representing the Eastern European Jews as the direct descendants of the Turkic Khazars with all their allegedly persistent criminal characteristics unrelated to any historical changes the theory in question demonstrates its evident biological racism. It is no accident that Evseev referred to Socio-Darwinism, and another amateur heodor Dichev recalls an eternal struggle between the Aryans and the Jews. At the same time, a concept, which argues that the “Jewish Khazars” maintained speciic elements of their original political system

(dual power) through centuries, sufers from cultural racism emphasizing an eternal and insurmountable character of the core elements of a cultural system.39 he Khazar theme turned into a common place of the Russian anti-Semitic literature dealing with Russian history. hus, it seems important that the contemporary Russian nationalists, irstly, have already constructed an image of a harmful Khazaria, which brought only misfortunes to Russia, secondly, believe in the Khazar ancestry of Eastern European Jewry, and inally, as the anti-Semitic authors maintain, are tracing the roots of the subversive activity of the Masons and Zionists against Russia from the “unwise Khazars.”40 hey need a myth of the “Khazar yoke” to make a bridge to another myth of the “Jewish yoke” in the Soviet era. An image of Khazaria not only infuses the Russian radicals with sad recollections and thoughts, but also directs them to practical actions. For example, a recently established National-Statist Party of Russia (NSPR) manifests its complete readiness for that. A “Narod” newspaper issued by its Tomsk branch maintains that “a power structure of the Neo-Khazar Kaganate has been established in the country . . . thus, the primary goal is what has been once already done by the prince Sviatoslav, who had destroyed the Kaganate and opened the door to a beneicial development of the Russian state.”41 he prince Sviatoslav became an important symbol of the movement in question, and in the early 2000s they were producing his monument. hisworkwasirstannouncedbythechauvinist“Pamiat’ ”newspaper,42 and the news was immediately picked up by the NSPR’s web-site.43 he readers were informed that 2005 was not only the year of the 60th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War but also of the 1040th anniversary of the prince Sviatoslav’s victory over Khazaria. hus, both events obtained equal value as the crucial ones in the Rus’-Russian

history. In 2004, several right-wing organizations including the World Foundation of the Slavic Writing and Culture (WFSWC) worked out a program of a celebration of the anniversary of the victory over Khazaria and began the preparations for that. he program included the following reasoning: “Alike Rus’ which has been sufering under the Khazar Kaganate’s yoke, the contemporary Russia is also sufering under the ruling power which reproduces the main features of the Khazar Kingdom. Yet we have a historically legitimate hope for a rescue. In spring 965 the prince Sviatoslav has raided the Khazar Kaganate and stroke it such a blow that it was unable to recover at that time. It is our sacred duty to celebrate an anniversary of that victory.” It is interesting that the author rehabilitated the prince Vladimir and called him a son of the “Slavic Malusha.” Following Gumilev, he maintained that “the Khazar chimera which has once emerged as the Khazar Kaganate, survived in history as some chimeric idea.” Making a bridge to nowadays, he claimed that a “system of the Neo-Khazar Kaganate” has formed in contemporary Russia.”44 hey intended to honor the pagan warrior Sviatoslav at the day of St. Trinity, on June 19, 2005 by which time the monument had to be erected. he monument was designed by sculptor Viacheslav M. Klykov (1939–2006), a WFSWC’s president well known in the patriotic circles who became a member of the organizing committee together with retired generals L.G. Ivashov and I.N. Rodionov linked with the Russian patriotic movement. hey were planning to erect the monument in the Belgorod Region. he initial Klykov’s idea was to decorate a Khazar warrior’s shield with the Star of David. Yet the Federation of the Jewish communities of Russia and the Eurasian Jewish Congress protested against that idea because of its obvious anti-Semitic connotations. Being sensitive to this protest, the Belgorod Region’ authorities suggested that the Star of David should be removed from the shield and that the monument would be erected in the village of Kholki rather than in the city of Belgorod.45 Yet, Klykov did not change his mind, and the sculpture is still staying in his storehouse in Moscow.46

Meanwhile, the victory over Khazaria impressed the Moscow Neopagans. One of their allegedly liberal group “Commonwealth of the Natural Faith ‘Slavia’ ” begins it historical era from 964. It is in this way that they turned the victory over Khazaria into a powerful symbol of their faith.47 hus, since the 1970s, a euphemism the “Khazars” became an integral element of the Russian nationalist lexicon and is used to mark the Jews and their “thirst for world power.” Why do the Russian anti-Semites like it so much? he summary of all its advantages makes the following pattern based on the “Khazar myth,” which is beneicially exploited by the Russian chauvinists. First, Khazaria collected tribute from the Eastern Slavs, and the Khazar traders made a big proit of the slave-trading. hus, one can accuse the Khazars of the encroachment upon the Slavic territories and the attempts to enslave the Slavs forever; second, since the Jews participated actively in the transit trade, which played an important role in the Khazar economy, it is possible to use for the Khazars a common anti-Semitic stereotype, which charges the Jews with cupidity and unlimited thirst for gold; third, the Khazar political inluence upon the formation of the Russian state can be treated as a “harmful dominance” to the extent that the “Khazar instructors” taught the Russian warriors unusual cruelty and sent them to inevitable death; fourth, the unprecedented Jewish inluence within Khazaria can be interpreted as an evident case of their seizure of the state power in an alien state as though that was a materialization of their everlasting goal; ith, the Judaism’s status of the state religion in Khazaria together with a Rabbi’s participation in the famous religious dispute held by Prince Vladimir can be interpreted as a persistent Khazar-Jewish intention to enslave Rus spiritually. Even more so, if one draws Christianity directly of Judaism, it is possible to claim that ultimately the Khazars were a success while imposing Christianity upon Rus’ (this is a favorite view of the Russian Neo-pagans); sixth, while stressing the Khazar origin of Eastern European Jews, it is easy to establish historical continuity between the Early Middle

Ages and nowadays and to maintain that the “Khazars” brought all their behavioral traits, rooted in the “racial” qualities, into present. Moreover, it is also possible to explain the Jewish “subversive activity” against Russia and the Russians with a reference to the revenge for the devastation of Khazaria by Prince Sviatoslav; seventh, pointing to the dualism of the Khazar political power and its assumingly unprecedented vitality among Eastern European Jews, one can make an attempt to interpret from this point the speciic traits of power structure in the Soviet period and even in post-Soviet Russia; eighth, Khazaria can be represented as a case of a lethal efect of intermingling of European and Eurasian populations with the Jews resulting in the formation of an unnatural harmful “chimera.” Moreover, if one considers that the Jewish Diaspora took deep roots in Europe and North America during the last few centuries, one can easily ind a basis for an anti-Western mood as well; inally, while putting the “Khazar theme” into more inclusive antiSemitic discourse, one can interpret the Khazar rule over the Slavs as a prognostic of the realization of the Jewish goal to rule all over the world. In this case the Slavs served as an experimental ield where diferent means and methods for that were developed and tested. hus, the “Khazar episode” becomes of world importance, and the Russian victory over the Khazars makes the Russians a vanguard of the world civilization, its reliable defender from the “World Evil.” In brief, the “Khazar episode” its perfectly well into the Russian messianic idea. Yet, one might also ind arguments to provide the Khazars more positive image. Indeed, the Khazars rescued Eastern Europe of the Arabic invasion and established peace (Pax Khazarica), which permitted the Slavs to colonize new territories; they acquainted them with rich cultural resources of the East; the Slavs learned political culture from the Khazars48 and began to build towns under the Khazar inluence.49 At the same time, the Prince Sviatoslav’s victory over the Khazars paved

the way for the disastrous invasion of Rus’ by the nomadic Pechenegs.50 he liberal Russian historians developed all these arguments about a century ago, but they are entirely ignored by the contemporary Russian nationalists. In fact, the Khazar myth tells us much more about the Russian identity than about the Khazars themselves. Indeed, each of various factions of Russian nationalism prefers its own interpretation of the “Khazar episode”—one that conforms to its attitude towards the Russian identity. he Neo-Eurasians, with their imperial geopolitical view of identity that embraces the entire territory of the former USSR, emphasize the “ethnic chimera” that emerged at the junction of two super-ethnoses and had no roots in the local environment. he eternal cosmic confrontation between Russian Orthodoxy and Judaism is most important for the Russian Orthodox nationalists, who emphasize Orthodox Christianity as the essence of the Russian identity. he Neo-pagans, who associate Russian spirituality with pre-Christian beliefs, attribute all the misfortunes of the Russian people to the Christianization imposed upon them by the “Jewish Khazars.” Russian biological racists, who are constructing a bizarre image of the “Russian race,” emphasize the harm caused by Eastern European Jews who inherited their national character from the Khazars. he cultural racists share this latter view, insisting on the indissoluble continuity and invariability of ethnic traditions due to their transmission between generations. hese diferent approaches to the Russian identity make it diicult for the Russian nationalists to unite their eforts. In brief, the euphemism the “Khazars” is strikingly meaningful for the Russian nationalists. It provides the Russian anti-Semitism with an original lavor. Indeed, for well-known historical reasons there are no other national anti-Semitic traditions, which are able to use the “Khazar myth” that much universally and efectively as the Russian anti-Semites do. Yet, whereas they are unable to develop a common positive basis for the Russian identity, they do all the best to build up an image of the Evil Other to encourage the Russian unity. Indeed, the Russian nation has never been inally formed. Making up the dominant majority, the Russians never felt themselves as a highly integrated ethnic group either,

and their ethnic identity was less developed.51 Hence, the radical intellectuals’ and politicians’ aspiration to canalize the public anger against ethnic “Others” in order to consolidate the ethnic Russians as the nation. Indeed, as we are taught by certain British scholars, the “racist thinkers sought to use ideas about race and nation to make sense of the changes and uncertainties brought about by socio-economic change, and to provide a basis for political mobilization and action.”52 An image of the enemy proves to be very efective in order to consolidate the nation.

THE KHAZARS AND THE WORLD OF ISLAM
David J. Wasserstein
A good deal of what we know of the Khazars comes from Islamic sources, or sources in the Islamic world. A large proportion of it concerns Khazar relations with Islam, or Islamic impressions and knowledge of the Khazars (We have of course nothing from the Khazar side of the relationship). Although this is not true of the material for the pre-Islamic period, partly because of the nature of Islamic historiographical interests and methods, it is true of the material both for the period up to the middle of the tenth century and the disappearance of the Khazar state, and for the period thereater. It might be thought, in consequence of this fact, that for Islam in its irst three centuries the Khazars and their state were of some signiicance, that Muslim relations with them mattered to the rulers of the caliphal empire, and that knowledge of them was of interest and value to those who were concerned with ethnography, geography, and international relations among the intellectual and other elites of Islam. If we consider the matter not from the Khazar viewpoint but from that of Islam, and the Islamist, then the opposite seems in fact to be the case. Our information is spotty and slight; Muslims do not seem to have regarded the Khazars as much more than a people living on their borders with whom they needed to exercise care, perhaps more than with others; and although some material will certainly have been lost, all the signs are that there never was much knowledge about the Khazars available to Muslims.
his begs a question: why was it thus? Should not the Khazars have aroused greater interest in the world of Islam? hey were of great importance in areas with which the Islamic world had had contact for centuries, from the very irst generation of Islam’s existence, and relations with them did matter. heir own potential for contact with the hostile power of Byzantium should have made them an object of more than merely intellectual interest and curiosity to people within the world of Islam. Or is perhaps the assessment itself in error, so that in fact our evidence is slight because so very much has been lost in the course of history? Much certainly has been lost, here as in every other area that we might look at, not only on the Khazar side but also on the Islamic, and

we can but imagine what the lost material might have told us. If we had more evidence, particularly from the Khazar side of the relationship, then things would look very diferent. Rather than simply warming over and serving up the material that we do have, which is for the most part well known to all those who study the Khazars, it seems to me that it may be worth trying to ofer a preliminary answer to these questions.1 I propose to look at three principal issues: one, Islam’s experience of the Khazars; two, the Islamic context of the Jewish aspect of Khazar history; and thirdly, the meaning that we should attach to the materials that we ind on the Khazars in Islamic sources.
1. Islam’s experience of the Khazars
In 641 or so, when the emergence of the Islamic empire and the earliest Arab incursions into the Caucasus irst brought Muslims into contact with the Khazars, the Khazar state had already been in existence for a long time, and it must have looked as though it was a permanent ixture on the political map of the area of the Caucasus. However, the changes brought about in the political geography of the Caucasus and the transCaucasian regions by the growth of the Islamic empire proved critical, and fatal, for the Khazar state and society. In part the decline of the Khazars in the tenth century is to be seen as deriving simply from the character of the Khazar state, as essentially a nomadic empire lying on the edges of large sedentary empires, with a hinterland which was always pressing on it, in other words as internal to itself and not fundamentally a product of the world around it. But in part also we should see the rearrangement of the frontier regions of the two neighbouring empires as responsible. It was precisely here, in the area adjoining the Caucasus, that the changes brought by Islam mattered very greatly, not so much to the Islamic world as to the Khazars themselves.



the khazars and the world of islam 375
Before the rise of Islam, Byzantines and Persians together, in uneasy and oten unwilling and sometimes even unconscious co-operation, had policed their common frontier with the mountains and, beyond these, the steppe, building fortiications and political arrangements designed to keep the nomads at bay and to leave the ground free for the two empires to confront each other in relatively full understanding of each other’s motives and methods. he Byzantines seem to have been better than the Persians at building and nurturing their relationship with the Khazars. he Islamic conquests moved the borders and changed the rules of the traditional game: the Byzantines withdrew westwards, while the Persian empire was destroyed, and was replaced by the new state of the Muslims. Unlike their predecessors, the Muslims were expansionists interested in conquest. As early as 641 we ind Muslim troops at Derbend and attempting to penetrate further still. his was not the same as the lengthy mopping-up operations which characterised the irst couple of decades of Islamic rule in the former Persian empire. Even if they had but limited success, mingled with some failure, in these attempts to conquer new territory in the Caucasus, all of this was a pointer to what was to follow. And while the real, if varying, threat which Khazars and Muslims constituted to each other remained alive for a full century thereater, we also note one feature of that century which shows the direction of the historical wind. he Khazars removed their capital northwards, to get out of the way of the dangers posed by Arab raiding; and Arabs made attempts to advance in the same direction. In 713 Maslama b. ‘Abd al-Malik, a son of the great Umayyad caliph ‘Abd al-Malik and himself a general of great distinction, captured Derbend, an achievement which he repeated the following year, when he also destroyed the town. But in the following two decades the pendulum swung backwards and forwards, and in 730 the Khazars were able to defeat and kill another Muslim general, Jarrah b. ‘Abd Allah al-Hakami. Now the Umayyad caliphate itself began to sufer from the major internal diiculties which destroyed it two decades later, but it was still able to send Marwan b. Muhammad, who was to become the last Umayyad caliph a little later, to deal with the Khazars. Another gited military leader, in 737 he advanced beyond Atil, and defeated the kaghan. he kaghan agreed to accept Islam and to become a subject of the caliph. his dramatic arrangement lasted only three years, thanks both to Umayyad Muslim weakness and to Byzantine support for the Khazars,

and it seems likely that the conversion to Islam of the kaghan did not outlive the political accommodation with the Muslims. Under the Abbasids, only a decade or so later, things were little different: al-Mansur tried to arrange a marriage between a governor of Armenia and a daughter of the kaghan, but it did not work out satisfactorily, as the woman died in childbirth; the Khazars themselves seem to have leaned towards Byzantium for much of the time. A later caliph, al-Wathiq (227/842–232/847) is said to have sent two embassies to the Khazars; one of these at least, that associated with the name of Sallam the Interpreter, seems to be authentic and to have been despatched with the aim of investigating at irst hand the political and military situation of the caliphal frontier in the Caucasus.2 We possess fairly numerous scattered references of one sort and another to individual Khazars inside the caliphate, and to Khazars in caliphal service. One such reference, apparently unnoticed so far, comes from the year 303/915–16, when we hear of a young Khazar being murdered by someone called Harun b. Gharib al-Khal, in the course of a drunken spree in the caliphal capital, Baghdad.3 However, perhaps the most notable fact to emerge from our
2 he identity of this ambassador, like that of the envoy involved in an earlier embassy sent by the same ruler, Muhammad b. Musa al-Khwarizmi, is striking: both were extremely learned men. Al-Khwarizmi (ca. 184/800–ca. 232/847) was a scholar, a scientist, mathematician and astronomer of wide learning, a number of whose works were translated into Latin in Spain some centuries later and had much inluence in the development of medieval science and mathematics. See on him the useful article (by Juan
Vernet) in EI2, IV, 1070–71, with much additional bibliography. he second ambassador, Sallam al-Tarjuman, was a high civil servant, but involved in chancery practice, and is said to have known some thirty languages (hence the name by which he is known).
See Dunlop (supra, n. 1), pp. 190–93. It could be argued that the employment of men like these in such embassies points to broader intellectual curiosity among Muslims; however, it could equally be argued, and possibly with greater force, that it points, more simply, to eicient organisation by government. Dunlop, p. 193, mentions the possibility that Sallam may have been a Khazar, and even perhaps a Khazar Jew, pointing out that ‘the name Sallām was occasionally carried by Jews’. his argument seems thin, though it could perhaps be strengthened a little by the fact that we have no father’s name given for him. 3 he incident is reported in the continuation of al-Tabari by ‘Arib b. Sa‘d al-Qurtubi,
Sila Ta’rikh al-Tabari, ed. M.J. de Goeje, Leiden, Brill, 1897, repr. 1965, pp. 55–56, sub
anno 303/915–16. We cannot actually be sure, in this case, that the victim really was a Khazar, despite the explicit statement in the source. It is said of him that he was “a man of the Khazars known as J.w.’.m.r.d.”: it is not diicult to see the Persian for ‘young man’ behind this apparent identiication, and a Persian description of an unknown youth killed in a drunken brawl need not be seen as compelling evidence of a Khazar identity, whatever our source alleges.



the khazars and the world of islam 377
material is not the presence of the occasional Khazar from the Caucasus in the sophisticated metropolis of Islam, but the presence of large numbers of Muslims in the Khazar state in the irst half of the tenth century (ten thousand at one stage in Atil, their capital, if we are to believe the reports), and the presence in their army of the Arsiya, Muslims who were exempt from ighting against their co-religionists at times of war between the Khazars and Muslims. his is reported by Mas‘udi, a contemporary, and may therefore relect some sort of truth.4 We cannot know how much truth there may be in the report, but its existence, and the fact of its occurring in a contemporary observer of such overall general reliability as Mas‘udi, together encourage the impression of growing Muslim inluence. Even if these Muslims were not in the Khazar army as representatives of the caliphal state, what we have here is nevertheless an indication of the penetration of Islam beyond the caliphal frontiers in ways which contrast sharply with the expansion of Islam in other parts of the world in this period; this situation also ofers an index of the types of problem to which the Khazar state was now subject, in the last decades of its existence. All the evidence suggests at a minimum a forward policy by a great power. he relationship between Muslims and Khazars has been viewed variously in the past. It has been fairly normal to see the Muslims as attempting here part of what they are oten said to have been trying a little later in the far west. hey have been seen as trying to drive ever onwards and conquer the whole of Europe, taking it in a pincer movement of conquests from east and west more or less simultaneously, at least if we take a macro-historical (and, let it be said, perhaps an overly Eurocentric) view. On this view the Muslim campaigns against the Khazars in the irst century or so of the Hijra and their attempts to make permanent conquests beyond the line of the Caucasus represent an endeavour to outlank Byzantium in a great Drang nach Westen. Such a view, such an ambition, and such a means to attaining it, seem to me alike somewhat far-fetched, despite the undoubted successes of the Muslims and their persistence in trying to maintain and even go beyond them. It requires us to accept that Byzantium had succeeded already at this primary stage in persuading the Muslims that it could not be conquered. It calls for
4 Translated in Dunlop, pp. 206, 211 f., with discussion.



378 david j. wasserstein
us to believe that the Muslims (and even some non-Muslims) had a far greater knowledge and understanding of the geography of Europe, east and west, than they actually can be shown to have had at any time before the end of the middle ages.5 And it also calls for us to suppose the early Muslims to have possessed an extraordinary degree of conidence in their own abilities, one belied by the real limitations of their extraordinary successes on the ground. Another view that can be adopted is that the constant Muslim conlicts with the Khazars represent something altogether diferent, namely the desire, on the part of the Muslims, to re-establish the Khazars in their former role, as guardians of the new frontier. On this view, the Khazars should be seen as akin, in terms of seventh-century political analysis, to the Ghassanids or the Lakhmids of the sixth-century Byzantine and Persian frontiers with the deserts of Arabia. his view has perhaps a little more merit to it, especially given what some Arab Muslims at least will have known of the history of their own region in the previous century, as well as relecting the realities of the situation itself. And there is a third view, which does not exclude the others. his view, which to my mind has a lot more to it than those others, is the simpler and more economical one, that here as elsewhere in this critical irst century of the existence of Islam what Muslim arms were trying to achieve was the extension of the territory which a surprisingly favourable military and political situation (in religious terms Providence?) had made available to them. hat is to say, if conquests were available, then they should be made. he direction that such conquests should take, in the sense of an alleged desire, or a supposed strategic aim, to conquer the whole of Europe, is not here the issue. Here were Muslims in the Caucasus, and here were possibilities opening up before them. We have what looks like an example of this more pragmatic approach in 652 (only 20 years ater the death of the Prophet) in the campaign of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Rabi‘a al-Bahili against Balandjar. He was killed, and the large army that he was leading was comprehensively defeated. It is worthy of note here that we are told that this campaign into Khazar territory was undertaken in contravention of standing orders from the caliph (at this time ‘Uthman).6 his may or may not be true—we

have no way of knowing, especially for this exceedingly early period of the history of Islam. But it is also noteworthy, in this context, that such negative orders are said to have been in existence also on the occasion of other such campaigns of the early period: thus Egypt was conquered in contravention of explicit caliphal orders against even entering the country; and similarly Spain, al-Andalus, somewhat later, at the start of the eighth century, was conquered in disobedience to identical instruction from the caliph (by now someone else: Walid I); and there are doubtless other examples that could be cited. his makes one wonder whether we have here some sort of literary topos—is a caliphal prohibition perhaps a necessary preliminary to the beginning of a great conquest for Islam in the literary-historical tradition? Or alternatively, whether what we have, for what will have been, it should be remembered, an extremely early and disordered and disorganised formative period in the history of the development and growth of the Islamic world empire, is perhaps the truth. (We hear nothing in these sources, by the way, about pincer movements, about ambitions towards the west, and the like.) he rulers in Arabia and in Syria were, understandably, wary of the dangers implicit in campaigns in areas which were unknown but clearly not safe or easy, against opponents whose strengths were largely untried and unmeasured, at enormous distances from Madina or Damascus, distances which made the lines of communication with the troops on the ground, and perhaps also lines of supply, unacceptably long. he dangers involved in such campaigns were obvious—and the chances of success correspondingly impossible to assess. he Umayyad experiences were not such as to encourage reckless adventures in the Caucasus. What is in fact suggested by our knowledge of Muslim attempts to deal with what may be described as a “Khazar problem” is that the Khazars were seen by Muslim rulers in Damascus and, later, in Baghdad as a potentially very dangerous frontier people who needed to be dealt with as circumstances permitted. Conquest as such was not a realistic policy. Occasional embassies needed to be sent, to conciliate and to threaten, to gather information and to explore possibilities, above all to keep channels of communication open;7 armed intervention was desirable from time to time, less to conquer or to absorb territories that could be

retained and controlled only with diiculty, and more to ofer reminders of the realities of caliphal power in the short term and the potential which that power had to do substantial damage to the Khazars in the long run.
2. he Islamic context of the Jewish aspect of Khazar history
he Jewish material on the Khazars is of considerable interest in this context too. By the term ‘Jewish material’ I refer of course to the famous correspondence, between the Andalusi Jewish court oicial Hasdai ibn Shaprut and the Khazar king Joseph, some of which has been so carefully edited by Norman Golb and Omeljan Pritsak.8 Ater their work on this material, there can scarcely remain any doubt about the genuineness of the contacts between the Khazars and the Jews of al-Andalus, or about their importance. I am here not so concerned with the contents of this material. What these texts say is very important in a number of ways, but it is not of direct relevance to my argument here. What is of concern here, to the Islamist, is rather the context in which that material came into existence, the context that permitted it to come into existence, and indeed the ways in which it was able to survive.9 he Correspondence, at least that part of it that involves Hasdai ibn Shaprut, is quite extraordinary material, and it is, I think, worth drawing attention here to just how extraordinary it is, from the point of view of the Islamist and the non-Islamist alike. Its creation required a number of diferent and quite unrelated things to be true, simultaneously. It was necessary for the Khazars to be Jewish. It was necessary for there to be somewhere another Jew who was not only interested in the Khazars but also in a position to do something to try to ind out about them. It was necessary for the Khazar state to survive just long enough for
8 Norman Golb and Omeljan Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the tenth cen
tury, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1982. 9 As to this last, the manner of its survival, we should not be indiferent to the fact that the Cairo Geniza is a unique survival from the Mediterranean middle ages (unique certainly in its size and importance; other survivals of similar type have yielded much less, and much less signiicant, material). he nature of the Geniza, as a Jewish repository, its character as a way-station to burial of its contents, and the accident of its survival unburied (something which ensured the physical survival of the documents in it) are all vital ingredients in this.



the khazars and the world of islam 381
contact between the two to be possible (we need to remember that the bulk of the correspondence belongs to the years immediately before the inal collapse—in other words, if Hasdai ibn Shaprut had been active and interested just a very few years later there would have been no possible addressee for him to write to, and he would never have received any answers to his letters). And, inally, and perhaps most importantly, it was necessary that there exist a world, a Kulturraum, that provided by Islam, which made the actual creation of a link between the Jew, Hasdai, in the extreme West, and the Khazar, Jewish, state, in the area of the Caucasus, far away in the East, not completely impossible. Each of these features of the situation, taken on its own, is highly improbable, a fact that we do not remember oten enough; each of them is also a necessary but not a suicient condition for the outcome; all of them together are indispensable. If any one of these conditions had been absent, then the link could not have been made. hat we should ind all of them in combination producing a series of documents beggars belief. And that these few documents should then in their turn happen to enjoy that curious blessing of the historian, the accident of survival, calls for the utmost caution in studying them and in accepting their authenticity. Yet we do ind them, and they do appear to command scholarly acceptance. It should be noted that the Islamic Kulturraum in which all this occurred was not merely where it just happened to occur. It was the special character of this Islamic world that made it all possible. It was the special character of Islamic Spain, al-Andalus, as an Islamic state, and as an Islamic state that was not part of the ‘Abbâsid Islamic state, that propelled Hasdai, a Jew, to what looks to have been a position of some importance. It was the special character of the Mediterranean basin as a largely Islamic lake that made it possible for Jews both to travel widelyas they had more or less ceased to do before the rise of Islam—and to make contact with Jews in other places;10 it was the special nature of relations between Cordoba, in Islamic Spain, and Constantinople that encouraged in Hasdai the idea that he could make contact with the

of Islam, 2nd edition, III, p. 991 (by André Miquel).

Khazars.11 All of this would have been wholly impossible before the rise of Islam. A glance at the situation of late Roman and Byzantine Jewries makes clear how very greatly the advent of Islam changed things for the Jews everywhere, for the better. And another glance at the nature of the new world created in the Mediterranean basin by Islam helps to explain the conversion to Judaism of the Khazars as it also explains the world-view, in a literal sense, of Jews and others of the tenth century. Jews were part of the world of Islam, as their situation in it was a function of the character of that world. hese Hebrew documents are in an important sense, therefore, part of what we should see as the evidence of links, of information and more, between the Khazars and the world of Islam. It was the Islamic world that created a new environment and a new sense of what was normal and possible in that environment. It is almost certainly this also that lies behind the well-known (modern?) legend of the survival and light to Spain of members of the Khazar royal family following the collapse of the mid-tenth century.12 hat legend itself seems to be an outgrowth of a self-interested remark in Ibn Daud, writing in the middle of the twelth century, to the efect that there were a few Khazars in Toledo in his own day.13 We may with some justice doubt the truth of the statement—as we doubt other details in that writer’s text (though no one seems to doubt this one)—but the notion of a few Khazars coming so far in the middle ages becomes less wholly unacceptable when we consider that the great bulk of the journey would have been conceived of as taking place within the oikoumene of Islam.
3. he meaning of the materials on the Khazars in Islamic sources

beyond them. he early wars against the Khazars settled down eventually to an uneasy state of no peace, no war, ending inally with the disappearance of the Khazars as an independent people. But even in the worst period for the Khazars, defeated, with their kaghan a less than eager convert to Islam, the Khazars had never become fully part of the Islamic world-empire, and they had never really either become part of the fully known world of Islam and its surroundings. hey had remained always just on the edge.14 he Caucasus was ater all very diicult terrain; it was very far away; and it did not, when all was said and done, have so very much to ofer. Muslim geographical writers mention them in some little abundance. We have a large and quite varied selection of writers who ofer a few sentences each about this people. But if we look at these texts closely then three principal features emerge. First, for centuries, Muslim writers just copy material about the Khazars from each other; most of what we ind can be traced back to a single very early source. While this may indicate that we have some good early material here, and while it may also suggest something quite impressive about the ability of early Muslims to ferret out, collect, preserve and transmit such material to their successors, it also suggests other things: in particular lack of access to newer material and also perhaps lack of interest in acquiring more. Secondly, much of what is reported is of a type with what we hear of other outlandish peoples living just on or over the edge of the Islamic world. Despite what we can conirm from other sources, there must always be a nagging worry about how far unconirmed elements in all of these reports represent merely what might be termed the “invention of the savage” in classical Islam or the perhaps natural tendency of medieval writers about such areas to let their material grow. Dunlop mentions, for example, that one of the reports that we have of the embassy of Sallam al-Tarjuman speaks of ‘an island of sheep’, while another tells us that, while he was with the Khazar king, Sallam saw a mermaid.15 And thirdly, there really is not all that much there: the motif of the dual kingship; some information about the variety of their religious life (but can we really believe that they had so many mosques or that there were really ten thousand Muslims in Atil?); the geography of their capital and

384 david j. wasserstein
a little about nomadism, and their relationships to other such peoples, and so on. But there is not very much beyond this. Ibn al-Nadim, a bibliographer, not a geographical writer, ofers an isolated report to the efect that the Khazars wrote in Hebrew. He is writing in the middle of the tenth century, which makes the report all the more intriguing. And it is also striking in this connection that the only surviving texts that we have from the Khazars should be, in the Correspondence, in that language. But Ibn al-Nadim tells us nothing more than this about their cultural activity, and we hear nothing at all reliable about this from any other source, so it is diicult even to know how far we can accept that statement, let alone build anything on it.16 Ibn al-Nadim himself is curiously uninterested in non-Muslims. What he tells us here is part of a broadbrush introduction to his work in which he gives some information about cultural and literary activity in world societies as a preface to a work on literary writing in Arabic—and there is no information at all about such material emerging from Khazar Muslims, nor even of the identities of any Khazar ‘ulama’. Regardless of the actual igures that our sources profer, if there really were such a large Muslim community in the Khazar state, not to mention some thousands of Muslim soldiers, we should expect there also to have been, by the tenth century, some ‘ulama’ there who might have entered the historical record. here are not. What all this adds up to is an image of the Khazars in classical and later Islam which is slight and uninformed, rough at the edges and conforming to a pattern developed for nations outside, but only just outside, the boundaries of the known world, the world of Islam. We may note that no Muslim writer seems to think that the Khazars, as Jews, partook in Jewish culture as this was known to Muslims (apart from the isolated remark of Ibn al-Nadim noted above);17 nor do they suggest that the

Khazars might ofer any sort of external protection to the Jews living under Islamic rule, on the pattern later developed by Christian states for Christians in the world of Islam, or even have any special links with their Jewish brethren in the Islamic world.
Conclusion
he Khazars were not unimportant; they enjoyed some signiicance at certain periods, and in a very few places, essentially during the formative period of the empire. he struggle with them was part of the initial boundary-setting and hence self-deinition of Islam; anything that happened thereater was not much more than a temporary disturbance of those boundaries. heir religious identity as Jews did not make them an object of great interest to Islam, not so much because they were Jews and belonged to a despised religion, but rather because of a more general Muslim lack of interest in the outside world, at least once the essential information about them as dwellers on the Islamic edge had been obtained and digested. I stress the unknown over the known, the unknowable over what we can know, quite deliberately here. hose who have studied the Islamic materials on the Khazars in the past, pre-eminently Dunlop, have extracted from those materials as much as they can reasonably be expected to yield. But these sources can also be compared with those for other groups in similar situations. I refer not only to such groups as the Celts as they appear in ancient, Latin and Greek, literary sources;18 we can compare also, for example, the peoples of Africa in medieval Arabic sources or, perhaps with greater justice, the nations of western Europe.19 If we consider what our sources tell us of what medieval Muslims actually knew of medieval Christian Europe, of its peoples and its geography, of its religion and its cultural life, its trade and its politics, then it is also

not all that much. (he link with al-Andalus can be discounted here. hat distorts the matter somewhat, but it does not change it fundamentally.) Lack of interest, together with lack of access to new materials, ofer a general explanation of this phenomenon. But there is a little more to it than this. Relative ignorance of the Khazars on the part of the Muslims must be seen in a context. hat context has two faces. On the one hand there is the fact that the Khazars themselves disappeared early into the mists of a largely unrecorded history: unlike the Jews elsewhere, or the Christians of the Middle East, or the other nations and groups which were in their diferent ways absorbed into the Islamic world, the Khazars disappeared completely, and they had of course never been fully part of that world. Secondly, there came a point, once classical Islamic civilisation became suiciently strong and conident in and of itself, when it simply became less interested in the world outside. his is evident in its geographical or ethnographic writing, which is endlessly repetitive of earlier writing, as in other aspects of its cultural life. hat we should ind little information overall, and that repeated in diferent forms from one writer to another as time goes by, should not surprise us very much. As in the case of the ancient Roman world, as Claude Nicolet has reminded us,20 so too, as André Miquel has pointed out for Islam, the new world empire of Islam was simply so large and varied that it could be seen as encompassing the whole world, or all of it that really mattered. he Muslims invented a world, and the Khazars did not really belong.

YIDDISH EVIDENCE FOR THE KHAZAR COMPONENT IN THE ASHKENAZIC ETHNOGENESIS
Paul Wexler
Two areas of research that can promise immediate and indisputable contributions to our understanding of Khazar civilization are the archaeology of the sites in the Empire and the reanalysis of extant historical documentation. A third topic, the fate of the Judaized Khazar population ater the collapse of the Empire in the late 10th century at the hands of Kievan Rus’ and speciically the possibility of a Khazar component in the Ashkenazic ethnogenesis, has for a long time greatly excited the curiosity of scholars and laymen alike but sufered from a dearth of convincing evidence (see e.g. Koestler 1976). It is, however, unlikely that the irst two areas of research cited above will signiicantly elucidate the third question. I believe that there are two major and three minor avenues of research available for uncovering the whereabouts of the Khazar Jews: the major avenues are linguistics and toponymics. he relatively minor avenues of research are numismatics, history and the archaeology of Khazars outside their Empire; a potentially promising avenue of research is genetics. Searching for Khazarisms or Hebraisms in languages presumed to have been in contact with Khazar Turkic is not very revealing of the fate of the Khazar Jews since the linguistic contacts could have taken place in situ before the collapse of the Khazar empire and the evaluation of the data is complicated by our ignorance of the Khazar language (see references in Wexler 1987: 72, 211–212; 2002: 515). Toponymic evidence, on the other hand, can show the extent of Khazar settlement both before and ater the 10th century, e.g. a recent study by Lewicki (1988) shows Turkic Khazars (including Jewish Khazars) prior to the 10th century accompanying other ethnic groups into Hungary, Serbia, Rumania, Poland, Moravia, Slovakia, and Austria (see also Wexler 2002: 219, 530 f.). I believe that there is one unexpected source, yet untapped, that can conirm a Khazar component in the Ashkenazic ethnogenesis: the Yiddish language. his suggestion may come as a surprise since Yiddish lacks typical Turkic linguistic features, such as vowel harmony and a

basically agglutinative structure. Nor does the Yiddish lexicon reveal a rich corpus of unique Turkic or Iranian elements unattested in the coterritorial and contiguous Eastern Slavic languages or Polish (for examples, see Wexler 2002: 87–88, 124–5, 150, 166, 171, 310–311, 359, 467, 510, 513, 519–520, 522; Poljak 1951: 315–323, intriguingly, had a brief chapter on the genesis of the Yiddish language in his book claiming that the Ashkenazic Jews were descended from Khazars, but gave neither convincing evidence nor analysis). Given the fact that most of the Ashkenazic territory, along with a great many Jewish communities from the Middle East to China, were under Mongol domination during the 13th century, some putative Yiddish Khazarisms may prove to be of some other Turkic or Mongolian provenience. However, one possibly Khazar Turkic feature in Yiddish may be the so-called “periphrastic” conjugation, whereby indeclinable Hebrew verbal elements are usually combined with the Yiddish auxiliary verbs ‘to be(come)’, as in Yiddish bojdek zajn ‘to examine’ (< Hebrew bōdeq ‘examining; he examines’ + the German ‘to be’). his pattern might ultimately be of Khazar origin, since Turkic and Iranian languages also have this conjugation for the integration of Arabic verbal material; it is lacking in Western Yiddish (i.e. Judaized German) and in German and German-derived slang lexicons (such as Hungarian and Slavic) that utilize a sizeable Hebrew component (primarily of Yiddish origin) but is attested in Judaized variants of Eastern Slavic in the 17th century (Wexler 1987: 98–99; 2002: 522–524). he geography of the construction thus suggests an Eastern origin. I do not accept the common view that Yiddish is a form of German. I believe that Yiddish arose approximately between the 9th and 12th centuries when Jews in the mixed Germano-(Upper) Sorbian lands of present-day Germany “relexiied” their native Sorbian, a West Slavic language, to High German (and to a lesser extent, Hebrew or Hebroid and unique, mainly Balkan Romance) phonetic strings (on the process of relexiication, a factor in the genesis of many creole and non-creole languages, see below and Horvath and Wexler 1997). I strongly suspect that the Sorbian Jews descend primarily from Balkan, and possibly also Caucasian, Slavo-Avar and German Slavic converts to Judaism. “Sorbian Yiddish” was brought to the Kiev-Polessian lands in the 15th century (in modern terms, northern Ukraine and southern Belarus’), where it was not adopted blindly by the indigenous Slavic Jews. Rather, the latter adapted it, by relexifying a second time, this time from Eastern Slavic to Yiddish vocabulary. In the process, they also accepted new German words that were not originally licensed for Yiddish and



yiddish evidence for the khazar component 389
discarded some existing Germanisms which were incompatible with the speciic requirements of Kiev-Polessian (see discussion of Yiddish tejl below). A pre-Ashkenazic Jewry in Eastern Europe has to be primarily of Khazar origin; by the time of the Ashkenazic arrival in Eastern Europe, the descendants of the Khazar Jews were apparently Eastern Slavic-speaking. he latter may have been attracted to Yiddish thinking that it was a form of German, a language of high prestige in Central and Eastern Europe, and/or because of respect for Ashkenazic culture. hey preferred to relexify to Yiddish because it would have been relatively easy just to learn new words; they could have retained most of their native Eastern Slavic grammar, which was suiciently close to the original Western Slavic grammar of Yiddish. he ability to relexify KievPolessian to Sorbian Yiddish and to inluence the latter suggests that the Eastern Slavic Jews outnumbered the Ashkenazic emigrés coming from the West—though historians always claim the reverse without ever providing the slightest factual substantiation. he Sorbs, Avars and Khazars who converted to Judaism in the late irst millennium (the evidence for this is both direct and indirect: see Wexler 1993b) must have been the major if not sole players on the stage of the “Ashkenazic” ethnogenesis and the prime initiators of the two relexiication processes. Why would Slavic-speaking Jews relexify? he most compelling explanation is that the confrontation of Germans and Slavs was resulting in the widespread erosion or extinction of Sorbian language, religion and culture, leaving the Jews increasingly isolated from the Christianizing and Germanizing Slavs. Relexiication rather then shit to German might have struck the Jews as a good way to avoid Christianization—a concomitant factor in the Germanization process. Furthermore, Judaism might have been attractive to pagan Sorbs because no political commitments were involved (unlike Christianity which entailed espousing German language, and cultural hegemony), and because Judaism ofered Sorbs an opportunity to escape the status of slaves which was being imposed by German settlers on the pagan Slavs and to preserve their Slavic culture and language. In the east, the desire of the Khazar ruling class to preserve neutrality vis-à-vis the Byzantine Christians and the Baghdad Arab Caliphate, along with the cultural inluences of visiting Jewish merchants made Judaism popular. Relexiication is always motivated by a desire to create a new ethnic identity, i.e. by identiicatory rather than communicative needs. his is tantamount to suggesting that non-Jews who joined the Jewish community before the 1200s (when both Christianity and Islam became irmly institutionalized) may



390 paul wexler
have sought a unique linguistic analogue to their new ethno-religious identity, i.e. it was largely they who were responsible for the creation of Yiddish. he near-universal acceptance of Yiddish in the area between Franconia in the west and Ukraine in the east suggests that converts to Judaism may have outnumbered “ethnic Jews”. he value of Yiddish to Khazar studies lies precisely in the fact that Yiddish grammar is clearly Slavic in origin; only the vocabulary of Yiddish is predominantly German. his means that Yiddish is a Slavic rather than a Germanic language (see my 1991, 1993b, 2002). While Yiddish began in the mixed Germano-Sorbian lands as a Western Slavic grammar with a predominantly German and not insigniicant Hebrew lexical component, it was acquired by Jewish speakers of Eastern Slavic by the latest in the 15th century in the Kiev-Polessian lands (though possibly even in the 10th century from Ashkenazic traders visiting Kiev, as well as in Central Europe among migrating Khazar Jews). Contemporary Eastern Yiddish can thus be described as the products (and partial merger) of two relexiication processes from Western and Eastern Slavic. he Kiev-Polessian Jews (now Slavic-speaking) altered the Sorbian grammar to it the norms of their related Eastern Slavic grammar; while accepting most of the Yiddish lexicon, these Jews also added new Germanisms. Since it is highly unlikely that the Eastern Slavic grammatical features found in Yiddish could result from the Slavicization of an originally Germanic language (see details below), I must assume that there was a suiciently large Eastern Slavic-speaking Jewry in Ukraine and Belarus’ that could have radically inluenced the development of the imported “Sorbian” Yiddish grammar. In other words, Yiddish provides circumstantial evidence that the Khazar Jews became assimilated to Eastern Slavic language by the late 10th century (if not sooner), and apparently settled widely throughout the Kievan Rus’ Principality, in addition to migrating into Central Europe (see Lewicki 1988, Wexler 2002: 530–533). It is very important to understand the nature of the phenomenon known as “relexiication”. he latter is oten confused with widespread borrowing, but the two processes have little in common (for details and examples of other languages, see Horvath and Wexler 1997). In borrowing, the speaker takes usually words from another language and typically uses them in the manner of the source language (though, subsequently, the borrowing language can innovate in the use of the loans). Usually, the volume of lexical borrowing is modest, though it can sometimes become the majority component (witness the Romance component in



yiddish evidence for the khazar component 391
English or the Arabic and Iranian components in pre-Reform Turkish). In relexiication, the speaker converts all of his original vocabulary into foreign words but uses the latter only with the meanings and derivational behavior of the former. here is also no automatic change in the grammar of the relexiiers. Hence, it is more precise to say that in relexiication the speaker borrows foreign “phonetic strings” with no meanings. On the surface, the “relexiied” language looks like it is related to the language that provided the lexicon; hence, not surpisingly, Yiddish has always struck most native speakers and non-native observers alike as a (distorted or unique) form of High German. Other Slavic languages which have undergone relexiication are Ashkenazic and Modern Hebrew (both of which are Yiddish grammar relexiied to Classical Hebrew), Esperanto (Yiddish relexiied to Latinoid lexicon), some forms of contemporary Sorbian (German relexiied to Sorbian lexicon) and Ukrainian and Belarusian (Russian relexiied to Ukrainian and Belarusian lexicon) and Old Church Slavic (Greek relexiied to a mixed Western-Eastern-Southern Slavic lexicon). Conirmed non-Slavic languages created via relexiication number about two dozen worldwide (Horvath and Wexler 1997, Wexler 2002: 23–24). Another feature of borrowing in the context of language contact is that there is no way to predict what elements of the lexicon, phonology or grammar will be borrowed. On the other hand, a distinctive property of relexiication is that we are in a position to predict what words will be accepted by the relexifying language. his is because relexiiers can only accept foreign phonetic strings that can be calibrated according to their original replaced elements. In other words, Sorbian- and Ukrainian-speaking Jews could only accept from German words that did not violate the derivational norms of Sorbian and Ukrainian (see examples below). he ability to predict the lexicon of a language is a crucial test for prior relexiication in the language. To establish this test for Yiddish, I collected in Wexler 2002 a corpus of some 600 sets of German roots, generating a grand total of over 3500 individual words (this corpus will be vastly expanded as Wexler [ms]). I compared this corpus with the Sorbian and Ukrainian translation equivalents, pretending not to know the lexicon of Yiddish. If Yiddish were really Sorbian and Kiev-Polessian that had become relexiied to High German vocabulary, it should be possible to predict which German words out of the 3500 examples could be accepted by Yiddish and which would have to be rejected. In place of the rejected Germanisms, the Sorbian and Khazar Jews would have



392 paul wexler
had six alternative sources of enrichment: they could (a) invent unique German words and meanings, (b) use other German words which were not rejected, (c) retain original Slavic words, (d) borrow Hebrew words, (e) invent Hebrew (“Hebroid”) words, and (f) utilize unique Romanisms and Hellenisms which earlier Jews had acquired in the Balkans en route to the Sorb lands (see Wexler 1992). All sources have been utilized simultaneously. he blockage of so much German vocabulary explains why the German component of Yiddish is so impoverished compared to that of any dialect of German, especially in the domain of synonyms. Indeed, of all the approximately two dozen known Jewish languages (e.g. Judeo-Spanish, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Chinese, Judeo-Greek, etc.: see Wexler 1981, 1993a), Yiddish has by far the most Hebrew and Hebroid components. he explanation for this astounding fact is that Yiddish was “created” via relexiication (from Slavic). he Hebraisms were required to replace the thousands of blocked Germanisms. Armed with predictions, I went to the most puristically oriented Yiddish dictionary, that of Weinreich 1968, for conirmation. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that in about 95% of the cases, my predictions were correct (see Wexler 2002). Consider the following two examples:
1. German has two forms of a single root to denote ‘name’ and ‘to name’: Name and nennen. I predicted that the Sorbian Jews would only accept one of the terms, because in Sorbian and Eastern Slavic languages originally ‘name’ and ‘to name’ were expressed by diferent roots, see Ukrainian im’ja ‘name’ but zvaty(sja) ‘to name’. It so happens that the Sorbian Jews took only German Name—see Yiddish nomen. For nennen, Yiddish uses a diferent Germanism, rufn (zix)—where the relexive particle zix imitates the Ukrainian use of synonymous -sja. 2. I predicted that German Zweifel ‘doubt’ (< zwei ‘two’) could not be borrowed by Yiddish since Slavic languages (unless they are inluenced by German, such as modern Sorbian and Croatian) do not form the term ‘doubt’ from ‘two’. See e.g. Ukrainian sumniv ‘doubt’, sumnivatysja ‘to doubt’ vs. dva, dvi ‘two’. herefore, Yiddish should lack German Zweifel; indeed, only Germanizing speakers in the last century have accepted the latter as cvejl. I can then predict that the Yiddish word for ‘doubt’ will be either real Hebrew, pseudo-Hebrew (Hebroid), Slavic or an innovative Germanism. It turns out to be Hebrew sâfeq (plural sfeqôt) > Yiddish sofek (plural sfejkes) ‘doubt’, zajn mesupek, zajn in sofek, soken ‘to doubt’.



yiddish evidence for the khazar component 393
here are a number of other diagnostic tests that strongly suggest the existence of relexiication. One important test is when the grammar and phonology of a language have a diferent origin from that of the bulk of the vocabulary. his test is readily met by Yiddish, since the Germanic component is almost exclusively in the vocabulary, while Yiddish phonology and grammar tend to follow Slavic norms; conversely, the Slavic lexical component of any Yiddish dialect never exceeds 10% of the total, and most of the items are recent post-relexiication loans from Eastern Slavic and Polish (approximately 75% of the vocabulary is High German and 15% Hebraisms and innovative Hebroidisms). As expected in relexiication, most of the original Sorbian and Kiev-Polessian words have been relexiied. By comparing the lexicons of the putative unrelexiied substratal and superstratal lexiier languages, it is possible to predict with extremely high accuracy which Germanisms will be acceptable in Yiddish, and therefore, where Yiddish will acquire Hebraisms, Hebroidisms and/or retain unrelexiied Slavisms. No other model of Yiddish genesis can make predictions about the component structure of the language. here are four rules for the blockage of Germanisms in Yiddish: (i) German morphophonemic alternations and derivational morphology are blocked in Yiddish unless they enjoy Sorbian and/or Kiev-Polessian parallels. German derivational sets rarely surface in Yiddish in toto, see e.g. Yiddish štark(er) ‘strong(er)’ vs. German stark: stärker ~ Ukrainian kripkyj: kripšyj with a stable root. he few examples of German Ablaut relationships that are accepted by Yiddish are invariably matched by a Slavic pair, see e.g. German Schweiss ‘sweat’/schwitzen ‘to sweat’ > Yiddish švejs/švicn, since a single root (also with alternations) is used in Slavic to express the noun/verb pair, see e.g. Sorbian pót/poćić so, Uk pit/potytysja (the relexive so/-sja is not copied by Yiddish—at least not now). (ii) German roots are blocked in Yiddish if Slavic translation equivalents do not broadly overlap semantically. (iii) Yiddish tends to select German synonyms in accordance with the lexical inventory of Slavic. (iv) German roots which match roots with similar form and meaning in Slavic (the words in question may or may not be cognates) were usually blocked in Yiddish, since they were apparently perceived as Slavic elements. here are four types of common lexicon: (a) German words > Slavic; (b) Slavic > German; (c) cognates; (d) non-cognates with chance similarity in form and meaning. Examples that fall under headings (a) and (c-d) are blocked for relexiication; only examples



394 paul wexler
in (b) are potential Yiddish words (usually in their German form, e.g. Yiddish bajč ‘whip’, blince ‘pancake’). For example, German Witwe(r) ‘widow(er)’ was blocked in Yiddish because of the existence of a close cognate Sorbian wudowa f, wudowc m. hus Yiddish uses almone f, almen m < Hebrew. Drosdowski 1989 believes German Witwe(r) may be related to Waise ‘orphan’; both Germanisms are absent in Yiddish, which suggests relexiiers may indeed have regarded the two allomorphs as related. Slavic lacks a parallel, though Sorbian syrota f, Ukrainian syrota m, f ‘orphan’ are ultimately related to Lithuanian šeirᕣs ‘widower’ (Schuster-Šewc 1978–1996: 1402). Hence, Yiddish acquired josem m, jesojme f ‘orphan’ (with unique gender diferentiation); note that almen ‘widower’ is a Hebroidism since Old Hebrew ’almān meant only ‘alone, forsaken’. Another example of cognate blockage is German Schwein ‘pig’ and derivatives, due to Slavic cognates, see e.g. Sorbian swinjo, Ukrainian svynja; Yiddish has instead xazer < Hebrew and ljoxe < Ukrainian l’oxa. (he same constraint on relexifying to cognates explains why the Arabic-speaking Judaized Berbers in Spain blocked most of the Arabic component of Spanish when they relexiied from Judeo-Arabic to Castilian before the Expulsion: see Wexler 1996.) Moreover, contemporary Yiddish dialectological evidence can even suggest that the Slavic-speaking descendants of the Khazars probably moved, ater the collapse of their kingdom (or, by the latest, ater the Mongolian invasion of Kiev in 1240) northward into Černihiv and Belarus’ and to the west and south into Halyč and eastern Poland, areas less endangered by the Mongolian invasion. his is because the Slavic component in Yiddish is oten from southern and western Belarusian and northern Ukrainian dialects—precisely the area of the original Kiev-Polessian dialect up to its disappearance in the early 15th century (Šerech 1953). In addition, it can be shown that the Yiddish assignment of gender to German and Hebrew nouns in Yiddish can only fully be motivated by reference to Sorbian and Ukrainian/Belarusian grammar. hus, Yiddish tejl(n) ‘part’ < German Teil(e) has either masculine gender (like German) or feminine gender (like the Slavic translation equivalents, e.g. Ukrainian, Belarusian částka). Native Sorbian dźěl m ‘part’ (with a diphthong) probably initially prevented Yiddish from accepting cognate German Teil due to formal and semantic similarity; in that case, Yiddish tejl is best regarded as an acquisition of the second relexiication phase, unless Ukrainian dil m ‘part, share’ was perceived as a cognate. Given the existence of Yiddish xejlek m ‘section, part, share, portion’ from



yiddish evidence for the khazar component 395
Hebrew, tejl may have been acquired only ater the termination of the two relexiication processes. Hence, it is possible oten to hypothesize whether a Germanism was most likely accepted by Yiddish via relexiication, or therater. he Yiddish preference for two German plural suixes -(e)n, -er and Hebrew -ōt (> Yiddish -[e]s), and the concomitant rejection of other German plural suixes and strategies (e.g. -e, voicing of the inal consonant, internal vowel change alone), also ind a smooth explanation in the fact that by chance Slavic grammars have a small set of similar-sounding unproductive noun-stem inixes which are now associated oten with the plural number, see e.g. Ukrainian maty ‘mother’, plural matery (with -er-), nebo ‘sky, heaven’, plural nebesa (with -es-), im’ja ‘name’, plural imena (with -en-). In the matter of grammatical morphemes, similarity of form and meaning is not a barrier, but rather facilitates relexiication. In this context, I can also say that Yiddish probably once had a dual number, which it inherited from its Sorbian substratum, but which became extremely productive in the Eastern Slavic milieu (Sorbian, along with Slovene, retains the Common Slavic dual category, though not without far-reaching changes). Nowadays, Yiddish no longer has a dual number; the category is also lacking in German. he evidence for my claim comes from the fact that the distribution of the plural suix -(e)n in German difers radically from that of -(e)n with Yiddish nouns of German origin. Yiddish -(e)n even appears with some Hebrew nouns (e.g. jam ‘sea’). Curiously, the Yiddish use of -(e)n with German and some Hebrew nouns (only some of which denote a paired object, such as ‘eye’, ear’, etc.) can usually be correlated with the distribution of the Ukrainian and Belarusian “pseudo-dual”—the use of a special plural sufix ater the numbers 2, 3, 4 consisting of the plural ending with the stress of the singular stem. Consider again Yiddish tejl(n) ‘part’ (vs. German Teil[e]), which matches the pseudo-dual of Ukrainian částka ‘part’, plural častký but dvi částky ‘two parts’; the corresponding Belarusian částka lacks (at least presently) a special plural form ater 2, 3, 4—see Belarusian (dzve) částki ‘(two) parts’, with no movement of stress to license the pseudo-dual. he pseudo-dual is considerably more productive in contemporary Ukrainian than in Belarusian, and the corpus of Yiddish nouns with -(e)n (where German requires a diferent plural sufix) ofers a much better match with Ukrainian than with Belarusian. Such facts suggest that the original Slavic-speaking Jewry resided in the Kiev-Polessian Principality for the most part (what is now Ukraine and possibly southern Belarus’).



396 paul wexler
Our ability to predict which German words will be accepted by Yiddish (oten accompanied by the ability to suggest whether a Germanism was accepted by Yiddish in the irst Sorbian or in the second KievPolessian relexiication stage), and where Hebraisms (or newly invented Hebroidisms) will appear in Yiddish (along with other, less powerful, indices not discussed here), dramatically support the Relexiication Hypothesis for Yiddish. If Yiddish were indeed a German dialect that had undergone intense Slavicization over a period of 700 years of contact with Slavic languages, as the traditional (and still majority) theory erroneously holds, we would expect Slavic impact to appear on all levels of the language and in a haphazard, non-predictable way. And that is largely not the case. Furthermore, how could the imaginary Slavicization of a Germanic Yiddish possibly account for the high volume of Hebraisms in Yiddish? Another dilemma for the view that Yiddish becames a heavily Slavicized form of German is that Colonial German dialects in Central and Eastern Europe (allegedly very closely related to Yiddish itself) were in contact with Slavic for even longer than Yiddish and yet they do not manifest a profound “Slavicization” (see Weinreich 1958). Nor do other languages long in contact with Slavic, such as Romani and obsolescent Karaite (for the belief that the Karaites are of Khazar origin, see Zajączkowski 1947). he Slavic “imprint” of Yiddish is thus hardly ascribable to many centuries of alleged contact with Slavic. he fact that Yiddish is a Slavic language has important implications for the ethnogenesis of the Ashkenazic Jews. Ethnographic evidence also suggests that the Jewish religion and folk culture are largely of Slavic, pre-Christian origin; subsequently, many of the latter customs were “Judaized” by linkage to similar Palestinian Jewish religious and folk patterns (on the “Judaization” of non-Jewish practices, see my 1991, 1993b). Establishing an Ashkenazic-Khazar connection would strengthen the claim that the bulk of the Ashkenazic Jews were of SlavoTurkic (or Turko-Slavic) rather than Palestinian Semitic origin, just as a study of other Jewish languages and ethnographies has led me to suspect similar non-Jewish origins for other “Jewish” groups (see my 1996 on the largely Berber origins of the Sephardic Jews). he renewal of Khazar studies, in turn, can provide valuable input to Yiddish linguistics, by uncovering further details about the westward Khazar migration into Central Europe before and ater the collapse of the Khazar Empire. Up until now, I have assumed that the Jews who resided in the mixed Germano-Sorbian lands beginning with the 9th



yiddish evidence for the khazar component 397
century were of Balkan origin (the centuries-old theory that the Ashkenazic Jews are predominantly of French and Italian origin has absolutely no factual basis, as I tried to show in Wexler 1992 and 1993b). he evidence for the Balkan connection lies in (a) the unique Romance component of Yiddish unattested in German dialects, which proves to be of Italian, Rhaeto-Romance and Balkan Romance, but never French, origin, in (b) the considerable archaeological and historical attestation of Jews throughout the Balkans and Panonnia (in contrast to relatively sparse attestation in central France and Italy), and especially in the JudeoTurkic indings in southwest Hungary and the Vojevodina (Serbia—see e.g. the Avar necropolis at Čelarevo studied by Bunardzić 1980, 1985 and discussion of Lewicki 1988 above), and, inally, in (c) the religious practices of Jews in Western Slavic lands (including present-day eastern Germany) which bear resemblances with Byzantine Jewish ritual. A putative migration of Jews from the Balkans to eastern Germany (and from there into western Germany and northern France) inds a parallel in the Balkan “Serbs” who migrated to the German lands where they became “Sorbs” ater the 6th century (on the latter topic, see Kunstmann 1987). In view of Lewicki’s indings, there is now the possibility that the Sorbian Jews may be mainly of both Balkan Avar and Caucasian Khazar origins, and that it is the latter who greatly expanded the original small Mediterranean Jewish founder component. By chance, one week ater the international Khazar colloquium was held, geneticists (unaware of the Khazar colloquium) met at an international conference near Jerusalem under the auspices of Tel-Aviv University to explore the origins of the Ashkenazic Jews and their diseases. Whatever origins geneticists choose to posit for the speakers of Yiddish (as well as other Jewish languages), the evidence that has been accumulating in the last eight years since the two conferences increasingly shows that Yiddish was born of Slavic stock (see now Wexler [ms.])—to be sure, with a unique history within the Slavic family of languages. It will be exciting to see in the coming years whether the Ashkenazic Jews turn out to be in the main Slavic-speaking Semites or Slavic-speaking Slavo-Turks (or Turko-Slavs)!

THE KHAZARS AND BYZANTIUM—THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
Constantine Zuckerman*
he Byzantine Empire and the Khazar Kaghanate share about three hundred years of common history. he links between the two states were initially very close. he emperor Justinian II married, ca. 700, a sister or, according to a diferent tradition, a daughter of a Khazar kaghan. In 732/3, the emperor Leo III betrothed his son, the future emperor Constantine V, to another Khazar princess. he ofspring of this marriage, Leo IV nicknamed the Khazar, ruled Byzantium in 775–780.1 he military collaboration culminated, in 840–841, in the construction of the great Khazar fortress of Sarkel on the Don under the guidance of Byzantine engineers and cratsmen.2 All these features are quite exceptional. Byzantine emperors were in no habit of marrying foreign princesses or of putting the Empire’s engineering skills at the service of a far-away foreign power. his idyllic relationship contrasts sharply with the picture projected ca. 952—iteen years before the Kaghanate’s collapse—by the Byzantine diplomatic manual De administrando imperio. here, Khazaria is perceived as a dangerous enemy and several peoples are named as potential allies, capable of ighting it on the Empire’s instigation. Likewise, a contemporary Khazar source, the anonymous Letter from the Genizah of Cairo, depicts Byzantium as enticing neighboring peoples to attack Khazaria.

he watershed in the relations between the two countries is clearly marked. Judaism was adopted as the state religion of Khazaria very soon ater the failed mission of Constantine the Philosopher, the future apostle to the Slavs, to the kaghan’s court in 861.3 his act, though never mentioned in any Byzantine source, was perceived by the Byzantines as a slap in the face and, of course, as a theological challenge. No later than 872, the emperor Basil I launched a vast campaign aimed at converting the Jews of his realm to Christianity, preferably by conviction, eventually by force. his campaign lingered for a while, was suspended by Basil’s son, Leo VI, and then rekindled, in an emphatically anti-Khazar context, by the emperor Romanus Lecapenus towards 930. here was, doubtless, more than one factor that drove the former allies apart. he Hungarian tribes invaded the Pontic steppe in the late 830s and weakened the Kaghanate considerably, depriving it of its western part. he Hungarian factor, largely overlooked by the scholars, had a major impact on the inner development of the Khazar State, undermining the kaghan’s power and prompting the creation of a parallel dynasty of kings by the kaghan’s deputy, the bek.4 More importantly in the present context, the Hungarian occupation of the steppe north of the Black Sea drove a wedge between Khazaria and Byzantium and reduced the former’s value as ally. Yet, this spatial separation would justify a downgrading in relations, not the extreme animosity to which attest both the De administrando imperio and the Genizah Letter. here is no reason, therefore, to contest the Letter’s claim that Byzantium’s sudden hostility towards Khazaria was due to the latter’s conversion to Judaism. While keeping this general framework of byzantino-khazar relations in mind, I will only touch in this paper on their earliest stage, well before they were clouded by religious discord. When did Byzantines and Khazars irst meet? his question goes far beyond the Byzantine context. It

I will argue that the Khazars arrived in the region later than is generally believed, and then soon discovered their common interests with Byzantium.

he search for early evidence on Khazars used to start with anachronistic references in the eighth-century History of Armenia by Movses Xorenac’i—which feature the Khazars in Transcaucasia in the irst centuries of the common era—and with attempts, mostly abandoned nowadays, to link the Khazars with the Akatziroi, rebellious subjects of Attila in Priscus of Panion.5 he Syriac adaptation of the Greek Church History by Bishop Zachariah of Mitylene may put us on a more solid ground. his text, produced in 569, contains an ethnographic appendix which carries the date of 555. Based on Ptolemy, it is expanded, among other things, with a list of thirteen peoples “living in tents” north of the Caucasus which includes the ksr (Kasar).6 Most scholars consider this to be a reference to Khazars.7 But to infer from this passage—as some scholars do—that its author situates the Khazars in the Northern Caucasus is clearly unwarranted. “Beyond” the thirteen peoples living in tents, he places “the tribe of the pigmies and of the dog-men, and north-west of them the Amazons”. he legendary tribes, borrowed from Ptolemy, live on the limits of the known land, and their position shows that the thirteen peoples ill the entire space of Ptolemy’s Asian Sarmatia, from the Caucasus ridge to the sources of the Kama. his localization of the Khazars does not necessarily bring them any closer to Byzantium. As of the middle or the last third of the sixth century, the Khazars appear in the descriptions of raids on Persia and Byzantium by nomadic

tribes. hese descriptions, however, are very late. hey belong to Arab historians of the ninth-eleventh centuries, and although they ultimately go back to a Persian tradition, they cannot be used to deine the ethnic identity of the invaders. When the same raids are described by sources, Byzantine or Armenian, more or less contemporary with the events, the Khazars are never mentioned. Ater a thorough scrutiny of the Arabic sources, D. Ludwig believed that he had found reliable evidence in the Book of Deeds of the Shah Khusro I (531–579), supposedly an oicial Persian document preserved more or less intact, in an Arabic translation, in the eleventh-century chronicle of Ibn Miskawayh.8 his appreciation of Ibn Miskawayh’s source, which goes back to M. Grignaschi,9 has been recently contested, however, by Z. Rubin, who describes it as a “literary composition” of undetermined date and of “loose and inaccurate” terminology.10 Rubin studies the data of Miskawayh’s source on the tax reform of Khusro I, but his characterization applies just as well to its description of the “Khazar kaghan” as the chief of the Turks. No wonder, therefore, that A.P. Novosel’cev, the last to address the issue, insists on the contradictions and the unreliability of evidence on the Khazar participation in the sixth-century Turkic raids. Following M.I. Artamonov, he associates the Khazars with the Sabirs, or Sabir Huns, who appear in the sixth century sources either as allies or as enemies of Byzantium in Transcaucasia. Later genealogies of Turkic peoples list Sabirs and Khazars as brothers, sons of Togarma, and so Novosel’cev hypothesizes that the Khazars were part of the Sabir tribal confederation and only gained prominence, and visibility in the sources, as the confederation collapsed in the late sixth century.11 he Togarma of the medieval genealogies, however, had ten sons, and this would allow for many more ethnic cocktails with Khazars as an ingredient. he attempts to extract historical data from the patently unreliable Arabic and Persian sources are most contestable, yet they have a

rationale. he evidence on the Khazar presence in the Northern Caucasus culminates in the story of their alliance with the Emperor Heraclius in the late 620s. Some sources present Heraclius’ allies as Turks, the early-ninth-century chronicle of heophanes describes them as “Turks, who are called Khazars”, other sources present them as Khazars. he latter include the History of (Caucasian) Albania by Movses Dasxuranc’i, a compilation whose chapters on the late 620s were, in all opinions, composed shortly ater the events described (infra). his major sourcewhich seems to reinforce the view of a gradual emergence of the Khazar power on the north-eastern outskirts of the Byzantine realm—occupies a place of choice in Khazar studies. Movses Dasxuranc’i’s identiication of Heraclius’ allies as Khazars is taken at face value by many scholars, but not by the better informed among them, aware of the dominant position of the Western Turkic Kaghanate in that time and area. he latter argue that the formal alliance was concluded with the chief of the Turks whose Khazar subjects, being the closest to the scene of operations, supplied the mass of the troops. his basic argument is admitted by M.I. Artamonov, A. Bombaci and D. Ludwig (to name but a few).12 A.P. Novosel’cev argues that the Khazars, once emancipated from the Sabir sway, created a state north-east of the Caucasus ridge, only nominally dependent on the Western Turkic Kaghanate; the latter’s subsequent decline allowed them to consolidate their statehood, to expand their power-base, and thus to become the major force north of the Caucasus, capable of confronting the Arabs in the 640–650s. “he crucial importance <of the Heraclius episode> for the problem of the origin of the Khazars, i.e., the tribe that made up the Khazar realm’s dynasty”, has been recently re-emphasized by O. Pritsak: a scion of “the Old Turkic A-shih-na dynasty”, who supposedly mingled with the Khazars in Albania, “was destined to become the progenitor of the dynasty of the Khazar qagans”.13 he prevailing view is well summarized

by J.-P. Roux who considers the events of 626–627 as the “naissance oicielle” of the Khazar people and the text which describes them, as “une belle introduction à leur histoire”.14 In a paper published in 1995, I suggested that Heraclius’ allies were Turks.15 his view will now be supported with a detailed analysis of the relevant chapters of Movses Dasxuranc’i. he reader should be warned the the A-shih-na link of the Khazar dynasty, an old phantom of the Khazarology, will thereby lose its last claim to reality and the “oicial birth” of the Khazar people will be somewhat postponed.
The Two Sources of Movses Dasxuranc’i on Heraclius’ Campaign
he description of Heraclius’ campaign against Persia and of the invasion of Transcaucasia by his northern allies comprises seven chapters of the History of Albania (Book II, 9–16).16 his vivid and oten intimately informed narration of the events was obviously produced long before the late-tenth-century compilation of the History which most scholars attribute to Movses Dasxuranc’i. But this narration has its problems. It dates the events by regnal years of the Persian Shah Khusro II (590–628) which go from the year 38 to 36 and then back to 38, and this is only the most blatant indication of its chronological disarray. C.J.F. Dowsett believed that this was due either to a mix-up of pages in an early manuscript or to the compiler’s lack of care for “presenting his sources in their true chronological order”; he proposed two alternative ways of re-arranging passages in chs. 11–12.17 he chronological incoherence of the Heraclian chapters is glossed over by A. Akopjan (Hakobyan) who derives chs. 9–14, 16 from a Life of the Albanian Catholicus Viroy (died ca. 630), which he dates in the early 630s; ch. 15 is considered as part

of a sermon by Viroy, inserted in the text by the inal editor, Movses Dasxuranc’i.18 J. Howard-Johnston suggests that two chapters, 14 and 15, originate in a Life of Viroy and conjectures for the rest (chs. 10–13, 16) “an ultimate documentary origin.” Unlike Akopjan, he admits “a certain amount of chronological confusion” in the text, created when its “two strands were (. . .) woven together”.19 he actual solution is much simpler. he section on Heraclius consists of two sources which are neither mixed up nor interwoven but crudely pasted together. he irst source, hereater Source A, comprises ch. 9–11; chs. 12–16 come from Source B. he dividing line between the two sources is very apparent: the History abruptly drops the description of the events of Khusro’s 38th year at the end of ch. 11 and switches, in ch. 12, back to the year 36. he two sources are also very diferent in nature. he elaborate and precise description of Khusro’s last days in ch. 12–13 must go back to Viroy who was detained for twenty-ive years at Khusro’s court and only liberated ater his dethronement. Viroy’s later dealings with the northern invaders (ch. 14) are described by a person who accompanied the catholicus on his mission; the same person could have access to—or recreate from memory—a sermon by Viroy (ch. 15) and provide a vivid description of the northerners’ cruelty end eventual demise (ch. 16). Source B, rather a history of the writer’s times than a Life of Viroy, was produced not before the early 640s—ch. 13 ends with a forecast of an imminent collapse of the Sasanian power and of the rise of the Ismaelites—but probably not much later. he author of Source A lays no claim to have lived through the events described. On the contrary, he emphasizes the length of the “time that

passed” that clouds his thoughts and obliges him to undertake complex chronological calculations; the attacks on Albania instigated by Heraclius are only the irst among “countless” barbarian invasions which he intends to narrate (ch. 9). he author makes a bad mistake—noted by commentators—in attributing to Khusro II the foundation of the city “Greater than Antioch”, actually built on the order of Khusro I for Byzantine captives in the 540s (ch. 10). Another anachronistic detail appears in his version of Khusro II’s letter to the northern invaders which describes Heraclius as “vagabond and fugitive” who led from the Persian king “to the isles of the Western Sea” (ch. 11), an obvious reminiscence of emperor Constans II’s (641–668) light to Sicily in the 660s. he account of Heraclius’ Persian war is short and vague; its main interest consists in a few details—drawn, no doubt, from a local tradition—regarding the author’s native village, Kałankatuk’, and the neighboring country. he diference in quality between the two sources becomes even more apparent once we recognize—something which, surprisingly enough, has not been done—that they basically tell the same story. hey provide a parallel account of two invasions of the Persian Empire, and of Albania in particular, by barbarians from beyond the Caucasus. he irst invasion—dated by Source A soon ater Khusro’s year 35 (624/5) and by Source B in the beginning of the year 37 (summer 626)—hits Albania and Azerbaijan. It ends in a rather abrupt fashion ater an exchange of letters—quoted, in diferent versions, in both sources—between the Shah Khusro and the chief of the invading host. he second invasion, in the last (38th) year of Khusro, is more eventful. Its description difers in the two texts because one of them (Source B) was produced by an eyewitness, while the other (Source A) relects its perception many years ater the event:
– he destruction and sufering caused by the second invasion of Albania are compared by the Catholicus Viroy to the capture of Jerusalem by Titus (ch. 15, cf. chs. 14 and 16). In Source A (ch. 11), this invasion is remembered less for the loss of life and property—duly noted—than for a miraculous salvation of most of the population in the mountains, an appraisal which seems to be inspired by the fate of the author’s village, Kałankatuk’. – Source B (ch. 14) preserves the name and the title of the Persian marzpan (governor) of Albania, Semavšnasp, who led the country at the approach of the invading host, and names another Persian noble,



the khazars and byzantium—the first encounter 407
Gadvšnasp, who stayed with the catholicus.20 In Source A (ch. 11), the Persian governor sent by Khusro, styled “our prince” (išxan), goes by the name of Gayšak’. – According to Source B, Heraclius’ northern allies invaded Albania for the irst time via Derbend, while on the other occasion they came by way of Iberia, i.e. through the Darial pass, began the hostilities by capturing Tbilisi and only later arrived in Albania. Source A does not describe the itinerary of the irst invasion but claims that the second time the enemies came via Derbend, mildly devastated Albania and then turned their rage against Tbilisi. he testimony of Source B, as always correct, has a crucial bearing on our understanding of the last, decisive phase of Heraclius’ struggle against Persia (infra). he reversal of the invaders’ itinerary in Source A could be due to the dramatic weight of the famous scene of mockery of the besieging kings by the besieged people of Tbilisi which—variously described in Sources A and B and in later sources—becomes, in the former text, the climatic point of the entire campaign.
Regarding Source A, several more remarks are in order. It has long been noted that the coverage of the seventh century (or rather of its last three quarters) in the History of Albania is of much higher quality than the rest of the book. his observation prompted a number of scholars to attribute most of the History, essentially Books I and II, to an eighthcentury author.21 A. Akopjan has argued in a recent monograph against this view, insisting on the contribution of a late-tenth-century author, Movses Dasxuranc’i, who had used two major seventh-century sources, a “Life of Viroy” and a “History of 684” (named ater the year of its presumed composition). But just as Akopjan’s concept of a “Life of Viroy” did not stand up to a critical scrutiny, it can be shown that the hypothetical “History of 684” is an unhappy combination of two diferent sources. he irst source (II, 18–28) is entirely focused on the igure of the seventh-century Albanian prince Juanšer, whose military prowess and
20 he manuscripts transmit the name of the governor in a variety of forms:
Semavštnas, Semavèšpnas, Semavšpnaz, Semavšpnaw; it is corrected by Arak’elyan
(p. 154, n. 9) in order to create a parallel to the name Gadvšnasp (pp. 157, l. 3).
21 Among the recent protagonists of this view are F.D. Mamedova, O xronologičeskoj

186; Smbatjan (cited n. 16), pp. 13–16 (with diferent arguments).

astuteness in maneuvering between the great powers of the time are celebrated in the most laudatory terms. Juanšer’s achievements are traced to the 33rd year of his reign, marked by an elaborately described visit to the caliph’s court in Damascus. he text provides a coherent chronology, based on equations between Juanšer’s regnal years and external chronological systems (reigns of Yazdgerd III and Constans II, years of the Hegira); his year 33 corresponds to 669/70. C.J.F. Dowsett qualiied this text as a “public address to the prince” because of a vivid exhortation at the end of ch. 28.22 Whether it was destined or not for an oral recital, it has every feature of a panegyric of a living ruler. It can be dated to 670. he following chapters (II, 29–45), supposedly a continuation of the “History of 684”, are very diferent in structure, in style and, even more so, in focus. hey are centered on the abbot, later bishop, Israyel, discoverer of major relics and apostle to the Huns. Included in his story is an elaborate account of Juanšer’s assassination and burial (chs. 34–35) which, rather than linking it to the preceding Eulogy, highlights a difference in approach: the prince’s death is explained by his own sinful behavior and, structurally, serves as pretext for the Hunnic invasion that triggers Israyel’s mission. he Eulogy of Juanšer quotes a number of documents which, only a few lines long, are all literary fabrications; Israyel’s biographer copies authentic documents over whole pages. What is more, the two parts of the “History of 684” are separated by ten empty years, between Juanšer’s year 33, which corresponds to 669/70, and his death in September 680.23 Neither the change of focus nor this chronological gap in what is supposed to be a continuous historical narrative have been explained. hese arguments suice in order to reject Akopjan’s reconstruction of the “History of 684”. Ch. II, 18–45 comprise two textual components which need to be considered separately. here is every reason to identify the Eulogy of Juanšer as the continuation of our Source A. Written in a high rhetorical style, chs. 9–11 and 18–28 complete each other. he terminal phase of Heraclius’ Persian campaign was the occasion of Juanšer’s father’s rise to power and of the creation of the dynasty. hus it provided a logical start for a panegyric of Juanšer. Some salient features of this family history explain, moreover, why a later editor chose to replace part of the Eulogy with a fragment

from a diferent source (Source B: chs. 12–16). he editor, who claims to have learned the story “from reliable and truthful historians”, resumes it in ch. 17. It turns out that Juanšer’s father, known to us by his Christian name Varaz-Grigor, was born to a noble Persian family that took over the Albanian district of Gardman ater having slaughtered the local chietains. Varaz-Grigor was baptized by Catholicus Viroy—no doubt in 628 or 629, when he realized that integration was the only way to keep his position in Albania ater Persia’s defeat—and became the irst prince of Albania. I suspect that Varaz-Grigor is none other than Gadvšnasp of Source B, a Persian of a “leading” family who did not lee with the governor but stayed with the catholicus.24 His road to power was cleared by a massacre of the descendants of the old Albanian royal house (attributed in the text to Varaz-Grigor’s grand-father, Vardan, this action actually proited Varaz-Grigor). he Eulogy of Juanšer must have presented his father’s rise to princehood in a diferent light, and this is precisely the part—the events of 628–637—which has been rejected and replaced, no doubt for an open bias. Identifying chs. 9–11 as the irst part of the Eulogy helps to explain the upbeat tone of ch. 9, in which the author announces the eventual humiliation and demise of the “countless” barbarian invaders of Albania. For a skillful panegyrist, Albania’s plight in the 620s provided a welcome contrast with its secure prosperity about half a century later, at the apogee of Juanšer’s power. he Eulogy’s anonymous author was a native of Kałankatuk’, and his origo, Kałankatuac’i, has been mistakenly attributed by some medieval (as well as modern) Armenian authorities to the inal editor of the History of Albania, Movses Dasxuranc’i. Produced in 670, the Eulogy is roughly contemporary with the History of Armenia by Pseudo-Sebeos (terminated in 660), in which the story of Heraclius’ Persian campaigns is also based, essentially, on an oral tradition, weaving solid facts with emerging legends. he story of Bishop Israyel is more diicult to situate. hough generally well informed about his hero, its author complains that he could ind no information on the beginnings of Israyel’s monastic engagement. Such a remark is typical of a saint’s Life, or at least of a text written ater
24 his episode is analyzed very diferently by C. Toumanof, notably in his review
of Dowsett’s translation, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (of the)
University of London 25, 1962, pp. 364–366. Despite a double reference to Varaz-Grigor’s
baptism, in the History of Albania and in a Georgian source he quotes, Toumanof pre
fers to consider Varaz-Grigor as a Christian, who only switched from Monophysitism
to Byzantine Orthodoxy.

the death of the saintly protagonist.25 What is more, it has long been observed that the chapters on the deposition of relics in Book I (ch. 2730) belong to the same author who describes their subsequent discovery by Bishop Israyel in Book II. I would tend, therefore, to side with those who admit the existence of an eighth-century—probably early-eighthcentury—History of Albania and consider the Story of Bishop Israyel as part of its main narrative. his History was itself a compilation, whose author integrated in his text the Eulogy of Juanšer, replacing a part of it with a fragment of a diferent source, Source B. his working hypothesis diminishes but does not deny the rôle of the late-tenth-century author and editor, Movses Dasxuranc’i, in shaping the text available to us today. Both the Eulogy of Juanšer and the Story of Bishop Israyel provide crucial data on the Khazars that will be commented below. A clear separation between Sources A and B not only eliminates all chronological contradictions—born out of scholars’ attempts to construct two parallel texts into a consecutive narrative—but also provides the key to the identity of the northern invaders. In ch. 11, they are identiied as Khazars (Xazirk’) in the opening line and later called the “army of the North” (zork’ hiwsisoy) and Huns (Honk’). he former ethnic description is applied by C.J.F. Dowsett to the invading army in the subsequent chapters (Source B) as well, but it is absent from the original text. Source B points out repeatedly that the invaders came from the North and also provides an exact indication of their origin which, surprisingly enough, has never been exploited. he story of the irst invasion ends with the sentence: Turkann darjaw yašxarh iwr, translated by Dowsett: “he messenger returned to his own country”. he translator admits that the meaning of the word turkan, unattested to in Armenian, is a matter of learned speculations.26 But “messenger” its poorly in the context. he text describes an exchange of letters between the leader of the invaders and the Shah Khusro that takes place in the Persian territory. It would make no sense for a messenger, carrying Khusro’s response, to go back to his own country while his chief is in Persia. he problematic phrase can only describe the retreat of the invading host,
25 his remark, at the beginning of ch. 29, collides with Akopjan’s concept of the “His
tory of 684”, since in 684 Israyel was alive and active. herefore, Akopjan (article cited
n. 23), p. 30, n. 33, attributes it to Movses Dasxuranc’i. his solution is rather forced:
the early stages of Israyel’s ascetic endeavor could interest his hagiographer, not a tenth
century historian of Albania.

just as the parallel description in Source A resumes in one sentence the efect of Khusro’s menacing letter: . . . ew darjan andren ènd noyn durn (“and <the invaders> went back through the same gate”).27 he word turkan describes the invaders and it has a meaning. As pointed out by K.H. Menges, turkan is “the Persian plural of Turk”.28 his is what it stands for in our text. A form lacking the plural ending k’, and thus perceived as singular in the Armenian morphology, is followed here by a verb and a pronoun in singular (I suspect this to be a hyper-correction by an editor or scribe).29 hus source B, produced soon ater Heraclius’ Persian campaign, identiies his northern allies as Turks, the same way as do the History of Armenia of Pseudo-Sebeos (T’etalk’),30 Patriarch Nicephorus’ Breviarium, composed in the 770s,31 the Georgian Chronicle32 and the Chronicle of Brussels, a late but valuable source.33 By way of contrast, heophanes’ Chnronography, compiled ca. 813, describes the allies as “Turks, who are called Khazars”,34 and they go by the latter name in some later sources, Greek and Oriental alike. his

late transformation of Turks into Khazars is a historiographic phenomenon which, obviously, bears no evidence on the Khazars’ actual presence in the Northern Caucasus in the 620s. In the Eulogy of Juanšer, the invaders loose their true identity forty-odd years ater the Persian war; major upheavals in the steppe in the 630–660s made it diicult for an author relying on an oral tradition to igure out which Turkic tribe had invaded his country in a not so distant past (infra). Our textual analysis has implications on two related controversies: the identity of Heraclius’ Turkic ally and the rôle of his troops in Heraclius’ last assault on Persia. Sources A and B both name the ally Jebu Xak’an. Source A describes him as a king (t’agawor) like Heraclius (ch. 11). By way of contrast, Source B explains that Jebu Xak’an was a deputy of the King of the North—also named Xak’an tout court—, second man in his kingdom (yaᒑord ark’ayin hiwsisoy, or er erkrord t’agaworut’eann nora); his son, identiied by his title of Šad, is described as a nephew of the King of the North.35 In the subsequent narrative (ch. 14), Šad’s father, Jebu Xak’an, is called, nevertheless, simply king (t’agawor). Greek sources are equally divided. Nicephorus airms that Heraclius met the “master” (kyrios) of the Turks: the Turk’s projected marriage with Heraclius’ daughter Eudokia, described by Nicephorus, only makes sense, in fact, if the former is the ruler of his people. heophanes, however, explains that Heraclius’ ally Ziebèl “was second in rank ater the Chagan”.36 Scholars have long noted that both the History of Albania and heophanes, or rather their respective sources, comment on the meaning of the title jebu/jabghu, which designates the kagan’s deputy. he identity of Heraclius’ ally and his relation to the King of the North are much debated. he question has been exhaustively reviewed by A. Bombaci and D. Ludwig (supra, n. 12), who provide the useful references. I will keep to the main point. J. Marquart identiied Jebu Xak’an as T’ong Yabghu Kaghan who, though independent in practice of the Eastern Turkic ruler, Hsieh-li Kaghan, ruled the Western Turks with the inferior title of jabghu. Logically, Ju. Kulakovskij identiied the King of the North as Hsieh-li Kaghan. his scheme has been contested by scholars who identify T’ong Yabghu Kaghan as the King of the North and who

the khazars and byzantium—the first encounter 413
consider Jebu Xak’an/Ziebèl, the commander of “Khazar” troops, either as a brother of T’ong Yabghu Kaghan, in charge of the westernmost part of his realm, or as a Khazar ruler. Marquart’s and Kulakovskij’s identiications have been defended by Bombaci. What is more, once we have shown that Source B identiies the invaders as Turks, there is no more reason to attribute Jebu Xak’an/Ziebèl any Khazar connection. However, reading two distinct sources as one weighed on Bombaci’s argument and exposed it to Ludwig’s criticism. In fact, each source has its logic. Source A (Eulogy of Juanšer) makes no complicated distinctions. As for Source B, its author, a close collaborator of the Catholicus Viroy, had dealt for a year (late spring 628-summer 629) with the Turks who camped in Albania; when mentioning Jebu Xak’an/T’ong Yabghu Kaghan for the irst time, he explains his exact hierarchical position (ch. 12). Later, in describing Viroy’s negotiations with the “prince” šad, he calls the latter’s father simply king (never King of the North), as he was no doubt treated by Viroy. Bombaci argued that T’ong Yabghu Kaghan and his successors, in retaining the inferior title of jabghu, recognized the superiority of the kaghan of the Eastern Turks. In a hierarchical system deined in family terms, Hsieh-li Kaghan (King of the North) and T’ong Yabghu Kaghan (Jebu Xak’an), two distant cousins, become brothers, and the latter’s son, the King’s nephew. But the King of the North never appears on the scene. His shadowy authority does not inhibit Jebu Xak’an’s actual freedom of action. A proper distinction between the two sources also allows a clearer view of the decisive phase of Heraclius’ Persian campaign.37 In 624 and in the winter of 624/5, Heraclius attempted a daring sally in the Persians’ rear, aiming at the heart of the rival empire. His short stay in Albania during the winter is remembered in Source A as about as destructive as the subsequent “Khazar” invasion. Successive victories over three Persian generals, Shahraplakan, Shahrvaraz and Shahen, in the late winter and the spring proved Heraclius’ military talent, but his small troop was chased away nevertheless by the superior Persian army. he plan to engage the Turks as allies was born during the stay in Transcaucasia. It was, no doubt, early in 625 that Heraclius sent the Patrician Andrew as his ambassador to the North, as described in Source B (ch. 12). he

rest of the year 625 seems to have been generally uneventful. he Persians spent it raising and training more troops, and Heraclius probably employed the spoils from the previous year to do the same.38 he return embassy of the Turks slipped into Persian territory via Derbend, penetrated into Lazica, traveled by sea to Heraclius “royal palace”—this would not necessarily indicate Constantinople but simply the place where it found Heraclius—and then went back the same way. he negotiations of the summer 625 laid the ground for the Turkic invasion of the summer 626. here can be no doubt that Heraclius planned a junction with his new allies in the Persian territory, but it did not work out. In the summer 626, he was blocked in the northern Asia Minor. He had the satisfaction of destroying, in conjunction with his brother heodore, a vast Persian host commanded by Shahen,39 but then he could only watch, helpless, as the Avars and the Persian troops of Shahrvaraz gathered for what could be the inal assault on Constantinople. Heraclius’ failure to show up explains the abrupt end of the irst Turkic invasion of Azerbaijan. he Avar siege of Constantinople failed miserably, however, and the next year’s campaign was much better prepared. Heraclius did not even try to break through the Persian lines. Instead, he embarked his people on ships and sailed to Lazica, traditionally pro-Byzantine and, in any case, not garrisoned by the Persians. he sea itinerary is indicated by Nicephorus, who fuses Heraclius’ two campaigns in Transcaucasia, in 624/5 and 627/8, into one,40 and by our Source A (ch. 10), which applies

it, mistakenly, to the irst invasion of Transcaucasia rather than to the second. his way of transporting the troops is a sure sign that Heraclius’ expeditionary corps was rather small (infra). From Lazica the emperor proceeded to Iberia and there, under the walls of its besieged capital Tbilisi, he met the Turkic chief, Jebu-Xak’an. Source A (ch. 11) dates the second invasion of Persia by Heraclius’ northern allies and the siege of Tbilisi in Khusro’s year 38 (from June 627) which, as it indicates correctly, was the year of his assassination (on 29 February, 628). Source B (ch. 14) provides a parallel account of the siege of Tbilisi, indicating that it lasted for two months. Finally, heophanes states that Heraclius, together with the Turks, invaded Persia in the month of September and that on 9 October he reached the land of Chamaetha (in the vicinity of Ganzak), where he rested his army for one week.41 All these indications it well together. Heraclius’ troops and the Turkic host joined early in July, captured Tbilisi late in August or early in September, and then invaded Persia proper, no doubt via the corridor of Nakhichevan. heophanes, however, makes the surprising statement that, before the October break, “the Turks, in view of the winter and the constant attacks of the Persians, could not bear to toil together with the emperor and started, little by little, to slip away until all of them had let and returned home.” Heraclius then rallied the army with a pious appeal to Christ and continued to ight the Persians on his own.42 his appraisal of the Turks’ rôle as allies reduces it, basically, to the destruction of the Christian city

sea-transfer all the way to Lazica is favored by Stratos (cited n. 37), p. 198, but rejected
by Howard-Johnston (cited n. 19), p. 23, who suggests that Heraclius might have trav
eled by sea with his personal staf, while the troops were assembled “in the coastal plain
east of Trebizond which provides relatively easy access to western Georgia.” However,
there is every reason to doubt the existence of a land road that an army of size could take

Topography of the Pontos (Dumbarton Oaks Studies 20), Washington 1985, I, pp. 19–20.

of Tbilisi. But heophanes’ chronology of their retreat is implausible,43 and, more importantly, it is contradicted by the data of Source B. here the Turkic invasion of Albania takes place soon ater the return of the Catholicus Viroy (ch. 14), who was liberated by Kavad Shiroe late in February or early in March and probably did not regain his country before the beginning of April 628. On this schedule, the Turks must have invaded Albania in April or in May. his date dovetails with the end of the winter campaign 627/8. Ater having won a decisive victory over the Persian general Rahzadh on December 12, Heraclius advanced, by the early February, very close to the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, but then retreated north, across the Zagros Mountains, to the city of Ganzak in Atropatene, which he reached on March 15. It was obviously then that the Turks let Heraclius and moved at a leisurely pace, pillaging the country on their way, some 300–400 km farther to the north-east, to Albania, which—as Viroy later learned to his dismay (ch. 14)—was assigned to them as permanent quarters. As for heophanes’ error, it seems to have an easy explanation. According to a contemporary source using Heraclius’ oicial dispatch, the Easter Chronicle, the emperor, by God’s grace, did not encounter the dire winter conditions before his entire army was safely and comfortably bivouacked in the houses of Ganzak.44 heophanes probably knew—perhaps from Heraclius’ previous dispatch which is now lost—that the Turks had let with the winter snows, but, confused by this very late winter (in March) and by the double stay in Ganzak (at the beginning and the end of the campaign of 627/8), he made the Turks “slip away” on eve of the irst stay, before the normal winter season. his allowed him to construct the victory over Persia as an exclusive deed of Heraclius’ Christian troop. A just appraisal of the rôle of the Turks in the campaign of 627/8 is crucial for understanding not only the mechanics of Heraclius’ victory but also the military situation of the Empire in general. Heraclius’ sea-borne expeditionary corps, which invaded Persia via Lazica in the late summer of 627, was necessarily small. he only igure available, 5000 men, provided by the tenth-century chronicler Eutychius, carries little authority but sounds like a fair appraisal.45 By way of contrast, the

number of Turkic allies is put by heophanes at 40 000.46 he evidence of Source B makes it clear that the Turks fought with Heraclius through the winter of 627/8 and thus, by implication, that this campaign was won by the Turks. heir dominant presence explains why it was no longer Heraclius—as on the previous campaigns—who sought to avoid a frontal battle, but, on the contrary, the Persians who retreated before him. Khusro’s order to Rahzadh to confront Heraclius was perceived by the Persian nobles as a suicide order and was instrumental in mustering the support for Kavad Shiroe’s rebellion (History of Albania II, 12). he decisive rôle of the Turkic allies in the campaign of 627/8 also explains why Heraclius, once deprived of their support, attempted no military action against the Persians and agreed to a border settlement that wiped all territorial gains made under Mauricius. As for Persia, it never recovered from the military and political upheaval of 628. A Chinese chronicle, which obviously draws its information from the Turks, notes that T’ong Yabghu Kaghan devastated Persia and killed the Shah Khusro II.47 Apart from killing the shah (which only involves a slight exaggeration), this tradition, never taken seriously by scholars, is essentially correct.
The Khazars’ Appearance North-West of the Caspian: Whence?
he Khazar conquest of the wide steppe region between the Lower Volga in the East and some point between the Dniepr and the Danube in the West started in the 660s, prompting, no doubt ca. 670, the creation of the Khazar Kaghanate. his process can be closely followed in several contemporary or nearly contemporary sources: the Armenian Geography (in two versions), the Eulogy of Prince Juanšer and the Story of Bishop Israyel in the History of Albania, and the common source of Nicephorus and of heophanes on the Bulgarian migration. hese Armenian and Greek sources will be interpreted here with help of others of the same

origin, and of some recent archaeological data. It is not my intention, however, nor am I in the least competent, to attempt to make sense of the Arabic accounts of the seventh-century conquests allegedly involving the Khazars. he traditional use of these accounts—transmitted orally for well over a century before being irst put in writing—as the basis for early Khazar history has resulted, I believe, in much confusion. We shall rely instead on sources which are the closest in time to the events described. he irst source to put us in touch with real Khazars is the Description of the Earth (Ašxarhac’oyc’), known as the Armenian Geography. Ascribed in some manuscripts to Movses Xorenac’i and sometimes quoted as (Pseudo-)Movses, this text is now solidly attributed to the seventh-century Armenian scholar of encyclopedic knowledge, Anania of Širak. It is preserved in two versions, one long and one short; both are now available in an English translation by R.H. Hewsen.48 I have argued elsewhere that the long version was composed by Anania between 660 and 665 (no doubt closer to the latter date) and that the short version, representing an abridgement and a slight revision of the text, was produced by the author himself for inclusion in his vast scholastic compendium, the K’nnikon, not many years later.49 One of the rare updates in the short version is highly revealing for Khazar history. he long version of the Geography features the Khazars twice. In the description of hrace, in Europe, the author mentions the island of Piwki (Ptolemy’s Peuke), in the estuary of the Danube: “On this island lives Asparhruk (Asparukh), son of Xubraat’ (Kubrat), who led from the Khazars from the mountains of the Bulgars”. he son of Kubrat who “led from the Hippic Mountains” is further mentioned in the description of Asian Sarmatia. In this description—based, as I argue elsewhere, on very recent data50—Asparukh’s fate contrasts with that of four other

the khazars and byzantium—the first encounter 419
Bulgarian tribal groups that dwell north of Caucasus.51 It would appear that by the early 660s, the Khazars had defeated and chased away Asparukh but not yet subdued any other Bulgarian tribe. he description of Asian Sarmatia contains yet another mention of the Khazars, which is more consequential. It is part of a rather precise description of the Volga. he Volga’s upper course goes by the name of Ira (Rha) and is formed of two sources, in which one recognizes the upper Volga and the Oka. Ater they unite, this river reaches the Hippic Mountains and “sends an arm” to the river Tanais that falls into the Maeotis Lake. he Rha then “turns east near the Ceraunian Mountains” (Privolžskaja Vozvyšennost’), receives the waters of two rivers coming from the east (the Kama and probably the Samara) and forms “a seventy-arm river that the Turks call At’l (Atil or Itil). In its midst is an island where the people of Baslk’ takes refuge from the mighty people of Khazars and Bwšxk’ who attack (them) from east and west when they come there in the winter. It is called the Black Island since it becomes black because of the multitude of the Baslk’ nation, men and animals, who come there. Ptolemy calls it the Crow Island. he arms of the river At’l unite again past the island and reach the Caspian Sea, separating Sarmatia from the land of the Scythians.”52 his description of the Volga was obviously not made with a modern map at hand, yet it is coherent and clear. he author has a good notion of the Upper Volga with its numerous tributaries that form the “seventyarm” Atil. His perception of a link between the Upper Volga and the Don relects the easy movement of goods between the basins of both rivers.53 He also knows that the middle and lower course of the Volga

of the Baslk’ nation, men and animals, who lock to it and make it appear black. Ptolemy
calls it the Isle of Crows. he branches of the Etil unite and enter the Caspian Sea, divid
ing Sarmatia from the land of the Scythians.”

translates the passage and compares it with Ptolemy V, 8, 7–8, ed. C. Müller, I, 2, Paris
1901, p. 913. However, Anania’s description of the Volga is very diferent from Ptol
emy’s—which he uses not directly, but in a fourth-century compilation of Pappus of
Alexandria, see Hewsen (cited n. 48), pp. 28–32—because of the new information he
brings in. Elements of Ptolemy’s description are re-employed by Anania rather freely:
thus Ptolemy’s Mount Korax-Crow in the Caucasus gives the name to the Crow Island
on the Middle Volga. S.T. Eremjan, Rasselenie gorskih narodov Kavkaza po Ptolemeju i

which separates, indeed, Sarmatia from Scythia—takes no important tributaries. It is amazing, therefore, that this very straightforward text has always been taken to mean the opposite of what it says. While the author describes a river formed of many tributaries that lows to the sea in one stream, all commentators of the passage apply it to the delta of the Volga, that is to a river that splits into many streams before lowing into the Caspian. he reason is that no one seems to be able to ind a big island in the middle course of the Volga. A related problem concerns the localization of the people of Baslk’. he people that Anania of Sirak calls Basłk’—in the short version, he also uses the form Barsilk’- is irst mentioned under the name of Barselt in the context of the 550s. According to heophylactus Simocatta, this people, along with the Ounnogours and the Sabirs, submitted to the Pseudo-Avars.54 his reference provides a vague indication as to their place of dwelling. By far the latest mention of their country appears in the late-twelth-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian who identiies it as Alania: “le pays d’Alân qu’on appelle Bersâlia”.55 his reference is part of a legend about the settlement of three Scythian brothers—two of them are identiied as Khazar and Bulgar—in Roman territory under the emperor Mauricius. he legend has been variously rationalized by Khazarologists. As part of this process, the country of Bersalia (or Barsilia) has been detached from Alania and moved east, to the interluvium of the Terek and the Sulak in Northern Daghestan, described by M.G. Magomedov as the “cradle of the Khazar state”. Others, like D.M. Dunlop, admit, in deference to the Armenian Geography, that “the available notices (. . .) do not permit us to restrict Barsilia and the Barsilians

of a “bifurcation” of the Volga which presents the Don as an arm of the Volga. Eremjan
also fails to recognize that Anania situates the connecting “arm” very high upstream,
above the Samara Elbow, and strives, for his part, to localize it below the modern delta
of the Volga.

to a small territory at the east end of the Caucasus” and devise, like A.P. Novosel’cev, a mega-Barsilia embracing a considerable territory in the central and the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus as well as the Lower Volga.56 his is, however, a faulty reasoning based on very poor evidence. Coherent geographical data localize Barsilia well over a 1000 km away from Alania. he Armenian Geography names, as neighbors and enemies of the Baslk’, “the mighty people of Khazars and Bwšxk’ (i.e. B[o]wšxk’=Bušxk’).” he same people of Bušxk’ is listed in the entry on Scythia as dwellers of Scythia, east of the At’l-Volga. he Bušxk’ have been identiied by M.I. Artamonov as Bashkirs,57 well situated by the ninth-tenth-century Oriental sources—in particular by Ibn Fadlân who visited them in 922—north-east of the Volga’s Samara Elbow (Samarskaja Luka), on the lower Kama.58 his localization of the Bashkirs makes it diicult to situate their neighbors, the Baslk’, on the Lower Volga. R.H. Hewsen rejects, therefore, Artamonov’s identiication for the Bušxk’ in the entry on Asian Sarmatia, without proposing an alternative identity. Nevertheless, he identiies the same Bušxk’ in the Scythian entry as the Volga Bulgars, the Bashkirs’ western neighbors who do not appear in the region, in fact, before the eighth century.59 hus he stretches the people of Bušxk’ along the entire Middle and Lower Volga. What is more, Arab geographers based on the late-ninth-century Anonymous Relation, notably Ibn Rusta (ca. 920) and Gardizi, name Barsûlâ as one of the three clans of

Golden’s solution, according to which the Barsils have “split in two groups perhaps in connection with the formation of the Khazar state or due to the Arab-Khazar wars.”61 But is it really worth it to stretch the Bušxk’/Bashkirs and to split the Barsils just in order to accommodate, in a very partial way, for a stray indication of Michael the Syrian?

Volga, next to the Bashkirs. he former text speciies, moreover, that the Baslk’ take refuge on a big island created by the Volga at the point where the last major tributaries low into it to form the At’l. his is a fairly precise description of the Samara Elbow. Anania of Sirak was not working, as said, with a modern map and so his description of the Volga conveys a geographic reality that all but the most detailed maps dissimulate. Most of the maps present the Samara Elbow as an open arch. hey omit the small river of Usa which lows into the Volga and transforms the Elbow into practically an island, well over 200 km in perimeter, attached to the mainland, in the North-West, by an isthmus only 2 km wide. he position of the Samara Elbow, the refuge of the Baslk’, indicates the true location of Barsilia. he new localization of Barsilia, about 1,000 km to the north from its traditional site, has several implications. In the irst place, it provides a precise ethnic label for the population of the Samara Elbow, described in recent studies as early or proto-Bulgarian.62 he Barselt-Barsils, neighbors of the Ounnogours, were identiied as a Bulgarian tribe by W. Tomaschek,63 and this identiication can now be conirmed by archaeology. he archaeologists who study the seventh-century population of the Samara Elbow and its vicinity note, moreover, the heterogeneous character of the inds: of the cranial features of the defunct as well as of the burial goods and customs. hat, for an anthropologist, the best parallel for a series of crania from the Samara Elbow is the tenth-century Hungarian material from the Central Europe,64 is by no means surprising: these crania attest, no doubt, to the presence of the Bashkirs, very closely related to the later Hungarians. A group of burials, notably near Šilovka, north-west of the Samara Elbow, have been related by the excavators to a distinctive burial culture, best attested to east of the Dniepr and on the Sea of Azov, which they believe to be Bulgarian and deine

Maršak) deines the same culture as PereščepinaVoznesenka and attributes it to the early Khazars.66 he cultural and ethnic mixture, discovered by the archaeologists in the Samara Elbow region, its precisely the description of the Armenian Geography. To appraise the implications of the new localization of Barsilia on the Khazar history, we should continue the comparison between the long and the short versions of the Armenian Geography. he chapter dedicated to Asian Sarmatia in the long version mentions the people of the Turks localized east of the Volga, beyond the Sabirs. It is further indicated that “the khakan is their king and khatun is their queen, the wife of the khakan”. In the parallel chapter of the short, revised version, the Turks are no longer mentioned, while the Khazars are noted in the list of tribes who inhabit Asian Sarmatia, apparently as the most northern tribe. More importantly, the notice regarding the kaghan of the Turks is replaced with the following statement: “he king of the north is the khakan who is the lord of the Khazars. he queen, or khatun, the wife of the khakan, is of the Barsilk’ nation”. he military struggle, described in the long version, gives birth to a new ethnic alliance. What is more, the Khazar ruler bears now the supreme title of kaghan that previously belonged to the ruler of the Turks. he new elements in the short version could have been introduced as early as ca. 670. hus the Armenian Geography gives us a real feel for the dynamics of the changes produced by the rise of the Khazars. Two Byzantine chroniclers, Nicephorus the Patriarch of Constantinople and heophanes the Confessor, provide a description of the emergence of the Khazars that goes back to a common source composed ca. 720 at the latest. According to heophanes, whose rendering is fuller and closer to the original, “the great nation of the Khazars issued forth

Batbaian <the eldest son of Kubrat>, chietain of the First Bulgaria, from whom they exact tribute to this day”.67 hus “the great nation of the Khazars” only came into sight of the Byzantines—as of the Armenians—ater it had conquered Barsilia. Most scholars admit that the creation of the Khazar Kaghanate coincided with the integration of the Barsils and took place in their country, yet in situating Barsilia west or north of the Caspian they argue for the North-Caucasian origin of the Khazar statehood. Now we see that there is as little evidence to support this reasoning as to justify the Khazar presence in the Northern Caucasus in the early seventh century (supra). he Khazars came from the Middle Volga and surely not alone. he rapid political accommodation with the subdued Barsils suggests that the latter were part of the Khazar horde that moved south. If so, the perennial enigma of Khazar archaeology—linked to the preponderance of “Bulgarian” material—and the mysterious reference of al-Istakhrî to two kinds of Khazars, dark and bright,68 inds a possible solution. he Khazar conquerors, who subjugated the Northern Caucasus and the Pontic steppe, comprised a strong Barsilian (Bulgarian) element. In the new country, the Barsils were no doubt regarded as Khazars.
The Khazars’ appearance north-west of the Caspian: When?
As early as 555, the name of Khazars appears to have been known to the anonymous author of the geographical excursus in the Syriac adaptation of Zachariah of Mitylene’s Church History (supra). If the Khazars are one of the thirteen peoples “living in tents”, they must have nomadized west of the southern reaches of the Ural ridge: on the north-western outskirts of the nascent Turkic Kaghanate, on the edge of the Finno-Ugric world and on the frontier of the forest and the steppe, in the region where the close contacts between the Finno-Ugrians and the Turks will give birth to the Hungarian people. But the Khazar expansion southwards only

starts a century later. he combined evidence of archaeological excavations and of several contemporary texts indicates the circumstances and the chronology of their movement. he excavators of the Samara Elbow burials date the earliest monuments to the second half of the seventh century. R.S. Bagautdinov, A.V. Bogačev and S.E. Zubov airm that the vast majority of settlements of the region’s earlier population—the Imen’kovo culture which they attribute to the Slavs—disappears, ca. 600, under the pressure of the “protoBulgars”, whose advancement to the Middle Volga they plausibly relate to the creation of a powerful confederation of Bulgarian tribes under the Khan Kubrat. his analysis creates a gap of half a century between two successive populations which is contested by G.I. Matveeva, who believes in the survival of the Imen’kovo culture well into the seventh century.69 he migration of the “proto-Bulgars”—whom I identify as Barsils—probably took place in the 640–650s, at the apogee of Kubrat’s power. By ca. 660 at the latest, this attempted expansion brought the Bulgarian tribes into collision with the Bashkirs and the Khazars. While the Barsils were subjugated and eventually absorbed by the Khazars, this could be only partly the case of a much stronger part of the Bulgarian horde led by Kubrat’s son, Asparukh. According to the long version of the Armenian Geography, Asparukh was defeated by the Khazars and led from the Hippic Mountains to an “island” in the delta of the Danube (supra). Two main identiications for the Hippic Mountains have been proposed. M.I. Artamonov attaches this name to the low ridge of Ergeni and to the Stavropol’ Hights, north of the Kuban plain where he situates the center of Kubrat’s Bulgaria. By way of contrast, V.F. Gening argues for a more western location of the site, identifying it as the Doneckij Krjaž70 he latter view is more compatible with the well-informed description of Anania of Širak, who mentions the Hippic Mountains before—that is, to the west of—the Ceraunian Mountains which make the Volga turn to the East. “Close to the Hippic Mountains”

lows the “arm” that links the Volga to the Don; the sources of the ive rivers that low into the Maeotic Lake are localized in the Hippic Mountains. It would probably be better, in fact, not to restrict Anania’s Hippic Mountains to the Doneckij Krjaž, but rather consider them as part of the low plateau south-west of the Privolžskaja Vozvyšennost’, including the Belogor’e Heights near Voronež pierced by the tributaries of the Don. Asparukh would have advanced rather far to the north, where he was checked and defeated by the Khazars. he Barsils’ settlement in the Samara Elbow region would appear, in this analysis, not as an isolated breakthrough, but as part of a larger expansion of the Bulgarian tribes northwards. his movement was perceived by the Khazars as an aggression and a threat. he victory over Asparukh, commonly viewed as the irst stage of the Khazar assault on the Bulgarian confederation, was essentially a defensive action. However, it did show the Khazars the way of a potential expansion and, to that extent, triggered their victorious southern campaign. Asparukh was defeated by the Khazars shortly before the composition of the original, long version of the Armenian Geography (between 660 and ca. 665),71 which still seems to view the Khazars as a far-away military power. By way of contrast, the Eulogy of Juanšer notes a Khazar invasion in Transcaucasia two years ater the visit to the region of the Emperor Constans II in his 19th year (659/660), that is in 662. he Albanian prince defeats the invaders single-handedly and expels them beyond the Caucasus. To evaluate this information, we should review systematically the references of the Eulogy, as reconstructed above, to the northern tribes. It should irst be reminded that Heraclius’ allies are described, indiscriminately, as Khazars and Huns (supra). he mix up is surprising because, in seventh-century Albania, the name of the Huns applied not to distant ith-century invaders but to close and well-known neighbors
71 Since, according to the common source of Nicephorus and heophanes, the Kha
zars fought Asparukh ater his father’s death, the year of his defeat would have to be
set somewhat later if one accepts the argument for Kubrat’s death ca. 665, see recently
I. Božilov, H. Dimitrov, Protobulgarica (zametki po istorii protobolgar do serediny IX
v.), Byzantinobulgarica 9, 1995, pp. 7–61, on pp. 32–33; cf. Golden (cited n. 7), p. 245.
According to heophanes, Kubrat died in the days of “Constantine the Western”, better
known as Constans II (641–668), who spent his last years (663–668) in the West; this
is taken to indicate that Kubrat died during Constantine’s stay in the West. But this
interpretation is patently forced. In qualifying Constantine as “the Western”, the author
simply wants to distinguish him from his homonymous son.

dwelling north of Derbend.72 Further, the Eulogy claims (II, 22) that, ca. 660, Juanšer’s fame reached so wide that even the King of Turkestan—the kaghan in the Armenian Geography—expected from him tokens of love and peace. hat Juanšer’s fame could reach the kaghan is doubtful, if only because, according to Chinese sources, the Western Turkic Kaghanate was inally destroyed by the Chinese in 659 ater years of decline.73 he next chapter (II, 23) describes the aborted Khazar invasion of 662. In ch. II, 26, the King of the Huns invades Albania in 665 and Juanšer goes to meet him without fear, although no king of Persia “had ever been able to behold the King of Turkestan in person.” Impressed by this encounter, the King of Huns reconciles with Juanšer and gives his daughter in marriage to Juanšer or to his eldest son.74 he caliph’s esteem for the Albanian prince grows then considerably, since he knows that this matrimonial link allows Juanšer to unleash at any moment the tribes of Turkestan (II, 27). he demise of the Turkic Kaghanate during the early years of Juanšer’s reign explains the ethno-political amalgam in the Eulogy. he ruler of the North-Caucasian Huns, once a modest subject of the kaghan, must have gained independence and, to enhance the glory of his in-law, Juanšer, he is assimilated by the panegyrist to the King of Turkestan. he Huns’ association with the Khazars is part of this tribal amalgam. Writing in 670, about the time Anania of Širak revises his Geography, the author of the Eulogy knows of a mighty tribe that is now the master of Turkestan. Just as in the description of Heraclius’ campaign, the Khazars=Huns replaced the Turks, the Khazars, I suspect, may have replaced the Huns in 662. he loose ethnic nomenclature of the panegyrist is hardly a solid base for ascribing to the Khazars a minor invasion that could be easily fought of by Juanšer alone. he importance of the Eulogy is rather in its testimony that, by 670, the Khazars were known and held in awe in Transcaucasia. he Story of Bishop Israyel which, as suggested above, is part of an early-eighth-century History of Albania, puts us on a more solid ground. here, the anonymous “king” of Huns of the Eulogy, related by marriage to Juanšer, has a name, Alp’-ilit’uer (ch. 36), and it is explained that ilit’uer (better eltebär) is actually a title, which he earned for the

many feats of bravery performed in Turkestan with the Khazar kaghan (ch. 41). In this text, the ruler of the Huns is never styled a king—which implies sovereignty—but a great prince of his people. hese indications relate to the events of ca. 682–684 when, ater Juanšer assassination, the Huns irst invade Albania to avenge his death and then let themselves be baptized by an Albanian bishop, Israyel. he text conirms the image of the Khazars as the new masters of Turkestan and thus as the successors of the Turkic Kaghanate. More importantly, the text indicates that by the early 680s, the Khazar Empire with its hierarchy of subordinated tribes is in place, reaching to the Caucasus ridge and to the limits of Albania in the east. In the west, a follis struck between 654 and 659 gives a terminus post quem for the ire that marks the Khazar conquest of the city of Bosporus.75 In 685, the Khazars invaded Transcaucasia, no doubt for the irst time. his invasion is described in a number of sources, notably in a short Armenian Chronicle composed in the second year of Justinian II (686/7); once ascribed to Anania of Širak, it has been recently attributed to Pilon (Philo) of Tirak.76 he same invasion had probably inspired the description, in the History of Armenia by Movses Xorenac’i, of the “hosts of the northern people united, Khazars and Basilk’ ,” who invade Transcaucasia through the pass of Derbend.77 he Chronicle of 686/7 notes the smashing defeat of the Armenian, Georgian and Albanian armies by the Khazars in August 685. More importantly, the text makes it clear that

relates the ire to a presumed Khazar raid of 679–680—a date derived from Nicephorus
and heophanes—which provoked the light of Asparukh and a major devastation in
the Northern Pontus. In heophanes, however, AM 6171 (678/9) is the approximate
date of the Bulgarian migration across the Danube into Byzantine territory; there is no
indication as to the date of their clash with the Khazars which provoked their initial
installation north of the Danube.

this attack was not directed against the Arabs and did them no harm: three years earlier, in fact, the Christian nations of Transcaucasia had stopped paying taxes to the Arabs who, in any case, did not maintain an army in the area.78 A year ater the Khazar raid, in the late summer 686, Justinian II sent an army under the strategos Leontius that subjugated Armenia, Iberia, Albania, Boukania (i.e. Moukania=Mukan) and Media, the latter two localities corresponding to Azerbaijan.79 Byzantium’s eastern adventure, which involved a visit to Armenia by Justinian II in person, in 688, lasted until the Byzantine defeat by the Arabs near Sebastopolis/Sulusaray in 692. here is no way to deny that the Byzantines proited greatly, and promptly, from the Khazar invasion in order to take over a region, whose inhabitants would not have submitted to them if they were in a state to resist. his is not a proof that the Khazar and the Byzantine military expeditions were coordinated beforehand, but this was surely enough to show to Justinian II the potential proit of a future alliance.

he Byzantino-Khazar collaboration begins very soon ater the Khazars appear in the Northern Caucasus and the Pontic steppe. It takes various and oten peculiar forms. he most striking case is Crimea, which the Khazars penetrate in the last third of the seventh century. While they are the only military power in the region, they do not expel the Byzantine administration from Cherson, the empire’s traditional northern stronghold. Ater his overthrow in 695, Justinian II is exiled to Cherson. Ca. 710, when relations are strained, we ind a Khazar governor (tudun) in Cherson, but soon aterwards the city peacefully returns to Byzantine authority.80 At the same time, a new city emerges, Sougdaia, modern

p. 536. heophanes dates Leontius’ campaign in the year of creation 6178 (1 September
685–31 August 686), but the Chronicle composed in the second year of Justinian II (10
July 686–9 July 687) knows nothing of it. he dates we retain imply that the Chronicle
which mentions no other event ater the Khazar invasion—was composed very early in
Justinian II’s second year. J.F. Haldon, Byzantium in the Seventh Century, Cambridge
1990, p. 71, dates Leontius’ expedition in 688/9, confusing it, no doubt, with the subse
quent visit to the region of Justinian II in person.

Sudak, on the eastern shore of Crimea. A.I. Ajbabin considers it, with good reasons, as a late-seventh-century Khazar foundation.81 he city’s early prominence is attested to by recent inds of Byzantine seals, probably originating from a collapsed customs house, the earliest dating from 696–697.82 Manifestly, the city functions from the start as a trade point with Byzantium. Unsurprisingly, the Khazars are very closely involved in the Byzantine internal politics of the period. Ca. 700, they provide a refuge and a wife to Justinian II. When the latter switches his alliance to the Bulgarians, the Khazars sponsor the revolt of Bardanes Philippicus who, in 711, assassinates Justinian II. he son of Leo III, Constantine, marries a Khazar princess in 732/3; this happy event coincides with a massive Khazar invasion of Transcaucasia which destabilizes the Arabs and allows the Byzantines to recover some of their possessions in the area. If one discards Justinian II’s marriage in exile, this is the irst foreign dynastic marriage in Byzantine history. For a century and a half, Byzantium had no closer ally than Khazaria. he friendship was nourished by sharing common enemies: the Arabs, who confronted the Khazars at Derbend, and the Bulgarians in hrace, who did not forget Asparukh’s defeat and, as late as 894, singled out the captives from an elite Khazar regiment in Byzantine service by cutting of their noses.83 hen, this special relationship broke down and was transformed into an intense hatred. his hatred was entirely due to the Khazars’ religious choice. Who would ever dare to claim that the religion can be separate from politics?
