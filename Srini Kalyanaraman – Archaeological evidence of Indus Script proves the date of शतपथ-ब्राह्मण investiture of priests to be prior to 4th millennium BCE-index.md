Archaeological evidence of Indus Script proves the date
of शतपथ-ब्राह्मण investiture of priests to be prior to
4th millennium BCE
◼ Investiture ceremony of priests in शतपथ-ब्राह्मण , attested on Indus Script with embroidered trefoils of Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest', podār 'assayer of metals'
This attestation of शतपथ-ब्रा ह्मण narrative on Indus Script is stunning. The evidence conclusively
provides evidence that Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization is dated close to the date of शतपथ-ब्राह्मण tradition, hence certainly post-Rgveda by at least a millennium during the Tin-Bronze-alloying revolution of Bronze Age. Since Indus Script is dated from ca. 3300 BCE (pace discovery of HARP potsherd), Rgveda should be dated at least a millennium prior to this date, i.e. earlier than 5th millennium BCE.
Decipherment of Harappa potsherd (HARP) kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS tagaraka 'tabernae montana fragrant flower' rebus: tagara 'tin ore'. Thus, tin smithy.
-- Dotted circle hieroglyphs of Indus Script signify purification of ores, smelting of metals led by Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest', podār 'assayer of metals'
-- Dotted circle hieroglyphs of Indus Script Corpora embellish goldsmith's portable furnace, statue of Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest' with trefoils, gold-bead fillets on forehead and right shoulder, signify two metallurgical processes: smelting, purification of metals
Dotted circles are an abiding set of hieroglyphs of Indus Script. What do they signify? I submit that they signify two Meluhha rebus renderings: Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest', धावड dhāvaḍa 'iron
smelter' See: Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest', धावड dhāvaḍa 'iron smelter' is paṭel 'headman' of metalworkers' guild https://tinyurl.com/y2287ve9
dhāī 'dot' and vaṭṭa.'circle' Rebus: धावड dhāvaḍa 'iron smelter'
pot 'perforation' pot 'gold, glass bead' rebus: Pot ̥r, 'purifier priest'; पोतदार [pōtadāra] m ( P) An officer under the native governments. His business was to assay all money paid into the treasury. He was also the village-silversmith.(Marathi)

Hieroglyphs of dotted circles signify perforations: Konḍa (BB) pot- (-t-) to bore, perforate.Rebus: N. pote ʻ long straight bar of jewelry ʼ and P. pot 'bead'. Thus, together with kunda kammaṭa 'fine gold mint', the dotted circles as perforations signify pot 'jewellery of beads', pote 'long straight bar of jewelry (like a gold ingot)'. A rebus rendering of this word also signifies: पोतृ प्/ओतृ or पोतृ, m. " Purifier " , N. of one of the 16 officiating priests at a sacrifice
(the assistant of the Brahman ; = यज्ञस्य शोधणयणिि Sa1y. ) RV. Thus, dottedd circles are signifiers of the work of lapidary goldsmith as a purifier of fine gold metal. This word is semantically expanded as an 'assayer of metal': पोतदार pōtadāra m ( P) An officer under the native governments. His business was to assay all money paid into the treasury. He was also the villagesilversmith.पोतदारी pōtadārī f ( P) The office or business of पोतदार: also his rights or

Rtvij wear embroidered shawls, embroideries of trefoils, tridhatu of Traidhâtavî (ishti).
This submission is based on the details provided in the शतपथ-ब्राह्मण in a remarkable referene to traidhatavi needles, i.e. needles of copper, silver and gold used to decorate the robe with single dotted circle, double dotted circles and trefoils (three dotted circles fused into a flower-like adornment).
The embroidery tradition of Traidhâtavî (ishti) of investiture ceremony for Potr with trefoils on his uttariyam -- in the concluding celebration of a yajna -- continues into historical periods with trefoils adorning handicrafts made by artisanss and embroideries of Kutch even today.
शतपथ-ब्राह्मण 13.2.10 TENTH BRÂHMANA
1. When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for himself that passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly world. 2. They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless, are the people (clans), and the Asvamedha is the royal power: they thus supply him with people and royal power combined. They are made of gold: the meaning of this has been explained. 3. Three kinds of needles are (used), copper ones, silver ones, and gold ones;--those of copper, doubtless, are the (principal) regions (of the compass), those of silver the intermediate ones, and those of gold the upper ones: it is by means of these (regions) they render it fit and proper. By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches 1) they are many-formed, whence the regions are many



5
formed; and they are of distinct form, whence the regions are of distinct form. Note: On people (clans): Viz. because of the large number and the small size (insignificance) of the needles, or wires, (and the common people). On 'stitches' (on the robe?): It is doubtful what word, if any, has to be supplied here,--perhaps it means, by way of their being (in sewing) horizontal and vertical. The commentary is silent on this passage. https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44092.htm
13.3.4 FOURTH BRÂHMANA
3. The first oblation (of blood) he offers 2 in the throat (gullet) of the Gomriga 1; for Gomrigas are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. 4. The second oblation 1 he offers on a horse-hoof; for the one-hoofed (animals) are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. 5. The third oblation he offers in an iron bowl; for the people (subjects) are of iron 2, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the people from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. Note: That is, their value--as compared with that of the king or nobles, and the Brâhmanas--is that of iron, compared with that of gold and silver; cp. XIII, 2, 2, 19. 13.2.2.18, 19: 18. And as to why there are copper (knives) for the 'paryaṅgyas,'--even as the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the
king, so those 'paryaṅgyas' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit, copper--to gold: with their own form he thus endows them. 19. And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other animals, indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the peasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a rattan mat (lying) north (of the Âhavanîya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anushtubh nature, and related to the Anushtubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,-the horse was produced from the womb of the waters 1, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb. Udavasânîyâ (closing offering) includes Traidhataviya ishti (Yajna involving three minearal ores): 13.6.2.17. ...The Traidhâtavî is the final offering (Udavasânîyâ): the mystic import is the same (as before 1). (Note: The process is as set forth in V, 5, 5, 6 seqq. As noted in V.5.5.7, the Traidhâtavî ends with presentation of gold coins. Such gold coins are either tied as goldbead-fillets on the forehead and right shoulder of the priest or stitched on as embroidered adornments on the robe of the priest.
5:5:5: 6. And that which had been his (Vritra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out 1 Cf. III, 2, 1, 28.: it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî (ishti). 7. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vishnu, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vishnu stood by him. 8. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds.

9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Yagus-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the Rik-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-ishti (completing oblation) for the performer of the Râgasûya.
... 11. And, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidhâtavî (ishti), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the Râgasûya. ...
16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas 2 each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing 3, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each.
Note: According to Sâyana, these 'satamânas' are similar to the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony; see p. 104, note 2. These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, VI, 7, 1, 2 seq.) were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins.

Thus, Smelter (ores) and implements workshop. Fillets with Indus script hieroglyphs of dotted circles, lathe, brazier signify पोतृ purifier priest of kole.l 'smithy, temple' http://tinyurl.com/nacgzus Indus Script Corpora are sangara 'proclamations'. This is signified by sangada 'hieroglyphmultiplex of lathe and brazier.' The proclamation is also recorded on a gold fillet of Mohenjodaro which most likely was worn on the forehead of a leader of the guild, community of metalworkers. This decipherment is consistent with the trefoil and dotted circle fillet which adorn the statue of a Potr, purifier in kole.l'smithy, temple'. The dotted circles also adorn the 'standard device' of lathe and brazier hieroglyph-multiplex. This decipherment is also a determinative of Indus Script Corpora as catalogus catalogorum of metalwork.

[quote]A Counting Disc? Was this disc (Image 1) from Mohenjo-daro at the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi used for counting? The circles with dots in the middle are identical to those found on other ivory objects from Mohenjo-daro thought to have been used as counters (2). Merchants or officials might have used these to keep track of goods, running their thumbs over the dots to track quantities. Or could there have been some other purpose?
Let us look at the counting argument. The disc seems to have three circles of dots, of 15, 11 and 6 dots. These add up to 34, which is not divisible by 8. We tend to think that Indus people, used a base eight system to count with, which corresponds to the sum of fingers on two hands, using the thumb to count with, as people still do. Yet looking at the other counters (2), only the final one (d) seems to largely have groups of 4 and 8 dots. The first object (a) has 7 dots, and is similar to a rectangular ivory object with 4 dots on it from Nausharo that might have been used as a counter or dice (Fig. 113, in Kenoyer, Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, p. 214). The second (b) has a set of four dots on top, then what seem to be 3 dots (the bottom one is obscured but the dot and part of a circle is visible). The third counter (c) has



22
7 dots at the top, and then is broken into 5 groups of 3, which corresponds nicely to the 15 in the circular disc. Indeed, perhaps in the circular disc (1) it is not 6 but 7 dots in the innermost circle, for a grand total of 35? Neither do any of these numbers seem to fit a base 10 or decimal system that the Harappans also seem to have used.
Note too that the same dots are found on an ivory comb far away in Gonur Depe, Turkmenistan https://www.harappa.com/content/prehistoric-contacts-between-central-asiaand-india. Could they have had a purely decorative purpose?... Mark Kenoyer writes, of objects similar to those in the second image and specifically (c), that "bone and ivory counters with circles and lines, carved in ways that do not correspond to dice, may have been used for predicting the future" (Ancient Cities, p. 120).[unquote] https://www.facebook.com/KacchiPlains/

Dotted circles are used on head-bands or fillets to signify priests of Mohenjo-daro.
What do the headbands or fillets on artefacts, say, of statues of eminent persons, signify? paṭṭa is a badge of distinction. The wearer of the badge is recognized as a guide. It is an appellation of dignity, of high office in a community. Hence, the priests, purifiers, Pot ̥r, पोतृ, are identified by
the paṭṭa 'badge' or fillet. Pot ̥r, पोतृ, are signified by trefoils: kolom 'three' Rebus: kolimi 'smithy,forge' PLUS Dotted circle khaṇḍa ‘A piece, bit, fragment, portion’; kandi ‘bead’ Rebus: khaṇḍā ‘tools, pots and pans and metal-ware’; kanda 'fire-altar'. pot ʻ glass bead ʼ

Ahar-Banas region of Rajasthan (close to the Khetri copper belt) is a copper complex. Ahar-Banas culture finds point to copper/iron metalwork during the Chalcolithic period.
Iron points and nails from Gilund.
“The copper objects discovered at Gilund invite comparisons to the copper assemblages of Ahar, Balathal and Ojiyana...Implements fashioned from copper sheets are present at all the excavated Ahar-Banas sites except Purani Marmi...Although many scholars have noted the mineral wealth of the Aravalli Range, along which many Ahar-Banas sites are located, the number of copper objects discovered is surprisingly low...Misra suggested that the location of the furnace in the lowermost level indicated early knowledge of metallurgy...Copper technology at Gilund is also demonstrated by the presence of six vitrified fragments found in Middle to Late Chalcolithic trenches. They are blackened to the point that the flay has become like pumice, and one of the fragments still has what appear to be pieces of copper attached to the inside. It is likely that these fragments were once part of one or more crucibles used in the smelting of copper...copper technology was practiced by the inhabitants of Ahar-Banas sites in Rajasthan during the Chalcolithic.” (opcit., p.18)

Gardez Gaṇeśa with Indus Script hypertexts फड 'cobra hood' (फडनीस phaḍanīsa 'scribe' of)
karaṇḍa mukuṭa to signify खरडा kharaḍā,'wealth-accounting ledger', र्रडा karaḍā 'hard alloy of iron' https://tinyurl.com/yd4abfqs Broad strap antarīya on Gardez Gaṇeśa pratimā is Indus Script hypertext to signify metals (iron) manufactory of Sarasvati civilization. Amarakośa provides a synonym for Gaṇeśa with the expression tri-dhātu, 'three minerals'. The pratimā has vivid iconographic details to further elaborate on the metaphor of Gaṇeśa an iron smelter, a wealth-accounting ledger keeper, a scribe.
Gaṇeśa wears an unusual crown, shaped like a wicker basket. The rebus reading of the crown
worn by Gaṇeśa is karaṇḍa hieroglyph र्रुं डी karaṇḍī f (Dim. of र्रुं डा ) A little covered basket
of bamboo. karaṇḍa 'wicker-basket' rebus: र्रडा karaḍā 'Hard from alloy--iron, silver &38' A
similar sounding word signifies that Gaṇeśa is a scribe, writer: खरड kharaḍa f (खरडणें) A
hurriedly written or drawn piece; a scrawl; a mere tracing or rude sketch.खरडा kharaḍā a daybook; a note-book. Thus, Gaṇeśa is keeper of a day-book, wealth-accounting ledger. These metaphors are conveyed by the karaṇḍa-shaped mukuṭa 'crown' worn by Mahāvināyaka of Gardez. Elephant trunk: karibha, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'; ib 'stylus' (as in English nib of stylus).
Gaṇeśa wears a yajñopavita, 'sacred thread' adorned with a cobra-hood:phaḍā'cobra hood'rebus phaḍā,paṭṭaḍe 'metals manufactory'. kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter' kolle 'blacksmith. panja 'claw of beast, feline paw' rebus: panja 'kiln'.
Thousands of Gaṇeśa pratimā also show a mouse:mūṣa 'mouse' rebus: mūṣa 'crucible'. Thus, Gaṇeśa is an iron worker producing crucible steel. This metallurgical competence makes him the



37
leader of the guild, ironworker guild-master, Mahāvināyaka.
