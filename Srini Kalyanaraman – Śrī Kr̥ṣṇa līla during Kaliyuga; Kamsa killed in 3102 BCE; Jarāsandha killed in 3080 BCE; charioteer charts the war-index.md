The death of Jarāsandha
The enmity between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Jarāsandha was life-long. These two mighty powers confronted each other eighteen times. Śrī Kṛṣṇa decided to kill Jarāsandha, the King of Magadha, in a duel. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa with Arjuna and Bhīma, reached the city of Magadha in the guise of Brāhmaṇas. They started from the kingdom of Kuru travelled through Kurujāṅgala and passed by Padmasaras and Kālakūṭa, visited the holy. places of Gaṇḍakī, Mahāśoṇā, Sadānīrā and such others, crossed the river Sarayū and reached the opposite bank. Then they travelled through the countries of East Kosala and Mithilā. Touring through the countries they crossed the rivers Carmaṇvatī, Gaṅgā and Śoṇa. Wearing matted hair and barks of trees they reached Girivraja, the capital city of Magadha. There were three big drums, which were used only on special occasions. The hide of elephant was used for making them.* Seeing all these sights they reached the presence of Jarāsandha, who welcomed them with necessary formalities and talked with them. But they kept silence. At last Śrī Kṛṣṇa told him that his two friends were having the vow of silence, which would terminate only at midnight. So the King left them in the sacrificial hall and went to the palace. He came to them at midnight and asked them who they were. Śrī Kṛṣha revealed to him that they were Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna, who had come to fight a duel with Jarāsandha, who had unreasonably put many innocent Kings in dungeon, and challenged him to select any one of them for duel. Jarāsandha, trembling with fury, selected Bhīma. In that duel Jarāsandha was killed. (Mahābhārata Sabhā Parva, 3 Chapters from 20).
Asti and Prāpti, the two wives of Kaṃsa, were daughters of Jarāsandha. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa, the two daughters went to their father and shed tears before him. Jarāsandha became angry and with a mighty army surrounded the city of Mathurā. A fierce battle was fought between Jarāsandha and Kṛṣṇa. At last Balabhadrarāma caught hold of Jarāsandha and was about to kill him, when an ethereal voice said that Balabhadrarāma was not the person to kill Jarāsandha. Accordingly Rāma and Kṛṣṇa set Jarāsandha free. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
Bhima, Arjuna and Krishna in the disguise of Brahmins went to Girivraja a city within the Kingdom of Magadha, to kill Jarāsandha, the ruler of Magadha, who was the father-in-law of Kamsa.
Jarāsandha’s killing by Bhima is just before the the Rājasuya yajna of Yudhiṣṭhira which is associated with the consecration of a king and prescribed as a means to establish a king's sovereignty. This yajna is performed in 3080 BCE. After the dice game, Pāṇḍava go into exile for 13 years; they return in 3067 BCE to wage the Great War.

Thus, Jarāsandha is killed in 3080 BCE (when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is 32 years of age – DOB 3112). Kamsa is killed in 3102; 22 years later Jarāsandha is killed and Sahadeva, son of Jarāsandha is anointed the King of Magadha. Sahadeva ruled for 21 years and got killed by Drona in MBh war. Thus,3067 BCE (Date of MBh war, death of Sahadeva) + 21 = 3088BCE is the year of the killing of Jarāsandha.
“After thus causing the annihilation of Jarāsandha by Bhimasena and after being properly honored by Sahadeva, the son of Jarāsandha, Lord Krishna, accompanied by Bhimasena and Arjuna, returned to the city of Hastinapura. When they reached the precincts of Hastinapura, they blew their respective conchshells; and by hearing the sound vibrations and understanding who was arriving, everyone immediately became cheerful. But upon hearing the conchshells, the enemies of Krishna became very sorry. The citizens of Indraprastha felt their hearts become joyful simply by hearing the vibration of Krishna's conchshell because they could understand that Jarāsandha had been killed. Now the performance of the Rājasuya sacrifice by King Yudhisthira was almost certain. Bhimasena, Arjuna, and Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, arrived before King Yudhisthira and offered their respects to the King. King Yudhisthira attentively heard the narration of the killing of Jarāsandha and the setting free of the kings. He also heard of the tactics which were adopted by Krishna to kill Jarāsandha... After the slaying Jarasandha, King Yudhisthira sent his brothers to conquer the other kings of the earth. He sent Arjuna to the north, Bhima to the east, Sahadeva to the south and Nakula to the west. The intention of the brothers was not to claim the thrones of these kings, but to defeat them, extract tribute and make them agree to King Yudhisthira's domination. After being subjected, the defeated kings were invited to Maharaja Yudhisthira's Rājasuya sacrifice.” Mahabharata (abridged) Chapter 5 - Lord Krishna Benedicts the Imprisoned Kings https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mahabharata/d/doc118385.html
After यवर्विर , Yudhiṣṭhira performed Rājasuya, he became the emperor and was invited to play Pachisi, a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni.
Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva led armies across the four corners of the world to obtain tributes from all kingdoms for Yudhishthira's sacrifice. The noncompliant Magadha king, Jarāsandha was defeated by Bhima and Krishna. At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honored guest. At the yajna, many kings were present there, including Duryodhana and Shishupala. Shishupala was beheaded by Krishna for his evil deeds.
Jarāsandha’s defeat thus occurred before the Rājasuya yajna of Yudhiṣṭhira. This yajna occurred 13 years before 3067 BCE (the date of MBh war) since the Pāṇḍava had to go into exile after losing the game of dice. The date of the yajna is 3080 BCE.
Sahadeva (Sanskrit: सहदेव) (not to be confused with Sahadeva, the youngest of the Pāṇḍavas) was a ruler of the Barhadratha dynasty of Magadha. In the Mahabharata, he is mentioned as the son of Jarāsandha, who was placed on the throne of Magadha by the Pāṇḍavas on the former's death in a duel with the Pāṇḍava prince Bhima.
According to the Puranas, he was killed in the Kurukshetra war and succeeded by Somādhi; Vāyu, Matsya (called Somāpi in The Vishnu Purana Chapter XXIII - Descendants of the kings of Magadha) Somādhi ruled for 58 years, V. or for 50 years M.
After the death of Jarāsandha, his son Sahadeva took refuge with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who crowned him King of Mathurāpurī. (Mahābhārata Southern text, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24).

Sahadeva ruled for after the death of Jarāsandha. Sahadeva died in the MBh war.
Since Sahadeva became the ruler after the death of Jarāsandha, we can determine the date of death of Jarāsandha: the death of Jarāsandha occurred in 3067 BCE + 13 = 3080 BCE.
Earlier, in 3102 BCE, 11-year youth, kiśora, 'youth' Śrī K ̥rṣṇa had killed Kamsa, as part of his avatāra, mission of incarnation of the Supreme Divine.
