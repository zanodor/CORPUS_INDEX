The Truth about Blonde hair and Blue eyes.
(MOD this is the revised version, please post this instead of the former one. Thanks.)
Hello WN folks,
Just curious if you guys have awareness of these facts about blonde hair/blue eyes, about hair/eye coloring. Just wanted to see your opinion. Please let us keep this civil. Off course, I am asking about this issue to WNs who beleive having blonde hair and blue eyes = Superiority. I won't give response, just wanted to hear your thoughts, your logic. Thanks.
Human hair color: Human hair color - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"Hair color is the pigmentation of hair follicles due to two types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. Generally, if more melanin is present, the color of the hair is darker; if less melanin is present, the hair is lighter. Levels of melanin can vary over time causing a person's hair color to change, and it is possible to have hair follicles of more than one color."
"Blond Blond hair ranges from nearly white (platinum blond, tow-haired) to a dark golden blond. Strawberry blond, a mixture of blond and red hair is a much rarer type containing the most amounts of pheomelanin.
Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but both only in small amounts. More pheomelanin creates a more golden blond color, and more eumelanin creates an ash blond. Many children born with blond hair develop darker hair as they age, with the majority of natural blonds developing their hair color into a very dark, almost brown, color by the time they reach middle age. Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Eastern Europeans and their descendants, but can be found spread around most of Europe. Blond hair is exceptionally rare among those without European heritage, however the Melanesians of New Guinea are one of the few non-European races and the only black race known to have a high blonde hair rate. This is because the Papuans/Melanesians have the highest rate of the newly-evolved ASPM haplogroup D, at 59.4% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele. Sub-saharan African has the lowest while the caucasian race has the second highest of 50% which may also account for their wide range of hair colors."
This is my argument:
If it's true the majority of natural blondes developing their hair color into very dark, almost brown, color by the time they reach middle age, doesn't that show us hair coloring is just really a matter of levels of melanin that can change over time? That blondness is not something special or "a superior thing" or these people are "superior beings" that many of you believe. It's simply a lack of melanin AND melanin levels even in blonde people can increase over time. Does this logic makes sense to you?
Also, many children born with blonde hair develop darker hair as they age. So what's about that? They were superior beings when they were children then became "less" or "inferior" when they grow up? They're still the same persons, right. Or, you mean to say they were not true blondes, and those kids who keep it blonde until they get older are true blondes and really superior, but then again, study states the majority of these blondes develop their hair color very dark, almost brown in middle age, they lose their "blondeness" too, just more late in
1/12



life.
What do these facts tell about "the truth of blondeness" then? The real reason behind the differences of *hair coloring* of races/groups of people? Is it a matter of superiority or simply a matter of melanin levels?
Isn't it clear to you it's just low levels of melanin at some point in these people's lives.
I've even read articles in the past stating NATURAL (not those dyed blonde hair which are naturally brunette medium thick hair) blonde hair as well as African hair are the thinnest, weakest, lifeless, unhealthiest hair type. It's limp and dry. Another term for blonde hair is "baby hair" or "corn hair". It says Asian Black hair is the thickest, strongest, shiniest, softest, healthiest, bounciest, most lustrous hair type. The hair strand of typical Asian hair is about 3 or 5 times thicker in diameter than that of the White European hair strand when seen under the microscope. That's why the Asian hair is so straight as the strand has more weight to pull down making it straight. Wavy and curly hair has little weight to pull the strand down. Typical blonde hair is known as wavy blonde hair.
"Some ethnic differences in hair shape are also apparent under low-power microscopic examination: On cross-section, Asian hair is seen to circular in shape and is larger in diameter than the other ethnic types, African hair is more elliptical (oval) with a wide degree of variation in shape, and Caucasian hair tends to be intermediate in cross-section between Asian and African hair. In longitudinal (lengthwise) shape, African hair shows irregular curling and twisting, Asian hair is straight with no irregularities, and Caucasian hair is generally straight with few irregularities in shape. The irregularities in longitudinal shape of African hair contributes to its tendency to break more easily than Asian or Caucasian hair."
Blonde hair has its own beauty, however, looking "eye candy" is not enough measure of True beauty or superiority. A True Beauty and a True Superior feature = a Healthy and Strong gene. A beauty w/o strong health is just a "facade" = a false, superficial beauty, not true beauty. That's why i think "Asian hair" is superior, the True beauty. Plus, most of the considered good-looking blondes or have quite thick/quite shiny strands of hair are actually brunettes with dyed blonde hair or wig/hair extension. Artificial beauty is not true beauty.
(As well as Asian skin i find it superior as Asian skin is the softest, smoothest, clearest/cleaness, less hairy, most youthful skin that retains it's beauty and youth much longer than Whites. The white skin of fair Asians do not burn in the sun too unlike the white skin of many Europeans that they can get skin cancer. Those are strong, superior skin qualities/skin health, a mark of superior gene. How is a skin that burns in the sun and age fast and not clear/etc. superior? A skin that burns in the sun with high risk of getting skin cancer is not even NORMAL skin for normal humans, not very fitting skin type for survival. Both the light and dark skin of Asians are also the beautiful type of "fair" skin (porcelain white and yellowish gold, not ghostly pasty pale like White fair version) and "darker" skin (nice sensual lightmedium-dark tan, not too dark as Blacks.)
Not all people find blonde hair to be more beautiful than jet black shiny hair. If you can only take a worldwide survey on individuals on their personal preference, blonde hair will not dominate. The hair color only seem to dominate as the White culture/media idealized light hair and since the Western is the current dominant influence in the world you'll see western products being modeled by many blondes around the world. Many people have preference for brunette and black hair as most people of the world have dark hair. Blonde is "too foreign" or "unnatural" to them. Many prefer jet black hair as it looks like shiny black diamond and looks very feminine, healthy/youthful/clean silky smooth, mysterious/mystical, exotic, sexy, intellectual and sophisticated with depth and substance, classy elegant, and sensually womanly. An ideal woman needs to look intelligent and sophisticated as well. Possess that "feminine mystique" quality that intrigues and mystify men.
Another thing, it says blonde hair is not exclusive to White race. The Melanesians, Black people, the Black race you view as the most inferior race, have high rate of blonde hair.
What does that says about "blonde" hair again? If it's really a superior attribute makes people 2/12



superior then why some of the Black people who you say are inferior naturally possess the color as well?
Is blondeness "really" superior?
English is not my first language and i'm writing this at work this issue is not so important to me so excuse me if I wasn't able to express my thoughts very good.

Re: The Truth about Blonde hair and Blue eyes.
(Part 2)
Found these posts online can't verify how accurate it is historically speaking.
What I can personally derive from that, is that blondeness hasn't *always* been the ideal in Western cultures like some believe. That's the point.
"Historically speaking blonde ment prone to illness and weak – therefore not diserable."
"White women with blonde hair and blue eyes were not seen as the prime figure of beauty until AFTER WWII. (something i learned). before then, it was only white women with "Dark Features" who were seen as ideally beautiful."

About Blue eyes (as well more on blonde hair)
Blonde hair and blue eyes are a result of flaw in DNA, abnormality in gene. People with natural blue eyes or blonde hair posses natural flaw in gene. Blonde hair and blue eyes are rare not cos it’s specially superior or favored by God or the Nature like many believe,
most people of the world have dark gene it’s cos most humans have normal genes created by God/Nature. In science, recessive gene is called "abnormal gene".
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FAIL TO REALIZE is that scientists have proven that blonde hair and blue eyes are caused by a recessive gene (a flaw in the DNA). But people are so use to seeing many people with the blonde hair and blue eyes and so they think it is normal to have these colors. This is something that many doctors already know about. The blue eyes happen because it is due to not enough oxygen getting to the baby(womb). I read once that the state of Utah has more blondes and blue eye people than any other part of the United states. At one time in history, blonde hair was very rare. It was so rare that at one time Adolf Hitler had a lot of people in his army that were blonde and blue eyed. To him this was the ultimate human being. But Adolf did not know what scientists now know today.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color " In 2008, new research revealed that people with blue eyes have a single common ancestor. Scientists tracked down a genetic mutation that leads to blue eyes. "Originally, we all had brown eyes," said Hans Eiberg from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the University of Copenhagen.[35] Eiberg and colleagues showed in a study published in Human Genetics that a mutation in the 86th intron of the HERC2 gene, which is hypothesized to interact with the OCA2 gene promoter, reduced expression of OCA2 with subsequent reduction in melanin production.[36] The authors concluded that the mutation may have arisen in a single individual probably living in the northwestern part of the Black Sea region (around modern Romania) 6,000–10,000 years ago during the Neolithic revolution.[35][36][37] Eiberg stated, "A genetic mutation affecting the OCA2 gene in our chromosomes resulted in the creation of a 'switch,' which literally 'turned off' the ability to produce brown eyes."
"The genetic switch is located in the gene adjacent to OCA2 and rather than completely turning off the gene, the switch limits its action, which reduces the production of melanin in the iris. In effect, the turned-down switch diluted brown eyes to blue. If the OCA2 gene had been completely shut down, our hair, eyes and skin would be melanin-less, a condition known as albinism.[35]"
Is it not interesting that Adolf Hitler was under the impression that blue eyes, blond hair, and white skin were attributes to the ultimate race? This is an interesting question because scientists have discovered this.:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color (under Medical Implications)
"Those with lighter iris color have been found to have a higher prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) than those with darker iris color;[51] lighter eye color is also associated with an increased risk of ARMD progression.[58] An increased risk of uveal melanoma has been found in those with blue, green or gray iris color.
.[42][45] However, a study in 2000 suggests that people with dark brown
eyes are at increased risk of developing cataracts and therefore should protect their eyes from direct exposure to sunlight.[59]
Some study stated also stated "The lighter the eyes, the weaker the immune system."
Apparently, the light eyes have much more medical complications than the dark eyes. So in medical sense, the dark eyes is healthier and stronger gene, therefore, it's the superior gene. It's the normal gene.

Recessive gene disorders
Because there are so many genes in each cell, everyone carries some abnormal recessive genes, but most people don't have a defect because the normal gene overrules the abnormal one. But if a fetus has a pair of abnormal recessive genes (one from each parent), the child will have the disorder. It's more likely for this to happen in children born to certain ethnic groups or to parents who are blood relatives. Recessive gene disorders include:
cystic fibrosis : a disease that causes the respiratory system to produce thick mucus that clogs the lungs
sickle cell disease : a disease where red blood cells form a "sickle" shape, rather than the typical donut shape, get caught in blood vessels, and cut off oxygen to tissues
Tay-Sachs disease : a disorder causing mental retardation, blindness, seizures, and death
beta thalassemia : a disorder causing anemia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis
CF is most common among Caucasians; one in 25 people of European descent carry one allele for CF. Ireland has both the highest incidence of CF in the world; 2.98 per 10,000 - and the highest carrier rate in the world with 1 in 19 individuals classed as carriers. Cystic fibrosis is Ireland's most common life-threatening inherited disease. Ireland also has the largest proportion of families with more than one child suffering from CF.[2][3][4][5] Approximately 30,000 Americans have CF, making it one of the most common lifeshortening inherited diseases in the United States.

Do brown eyes see better than blue?
Recent research shows that blue-eyed men prefer blue-eyed women. Thus it appears that, at least to some observers, eye colour is important. But why do humans have different eye colours? It mostly comes down to the amount and location of melanin (yes, the same substance which controls skin colour) in the human eye. Pale eyes such as blue, grey or green eyes contain little melanin, dark brown eyes more. Which eye colour you get is primarily determined from genetic variation based on the eye colour of your parents. But does your eye colour influence how you see? It turns out that it does. The darker the eyes, the more light is absorbed as light waves pass through the eye, and the less light is available to reflect within the eye. Light reflection (scatter) within the eye can cause susceptibility to glare (eg. sun or headlights) and to poor contrast discernment. Thus it seems that people with darker eyes may have better vision in high-glare situations – perhaps this makes them better night drivers, for example. Eye colour may also affect your colour vision. Here it seems that lighter eyes may provide some advantages. So it seems to me that blue-eyed people should really go for dark-eyed partners – this way one can pick the paint colours, and the other can drive home at night.

Are people with lighter eyes (blue or green) more sensitive to sun light?
(Most testify it's true)
Quite a lot of East Asians wear glasses not that the East Asian eyes geneticaly have eye problems, it's a result of too much studying as well as the Japanese have history of staring at the sun.

Re: The Truth about Blonde hair and Blue eyes.
(Part 6)
Those have scientific basis. True, someone has said "blue eyes is the color of the sky, blond hair is the color of the sun.Brown is the color of the Earth. Both has it's place in the cosmos but one is high, the other is low". However, that notion of superiority or being higher form as they resemble the high sky and the sun is purely "romanticism" and no essence of truth. As well a narrowminded shallow perception of the Cosmos. In medical sense, the light genes are not superior at all, in fact, quite inferior. The idea angels have blue eyes and blonde hair are mere illusion or fantasy has no reality basis. Nobody ever seen an angel, there's no even proof they exist.
About "Evolution"
Someone said "Evolution is not a progressive linear transition from inferior to superior forms. If it was there would be no other life forms except the purported superior one. It is a continual reshaping of forms in response to selective factors of environment."
But, even if you believe otherwise, if by your definition evolution means to become superior form, the light features of the Europeans actually cannot classify as having evolved to superior forms.
The blue eyes/blonde hair maybe the latest to "evolve" and look aesthetically beautiful so there's the misconception, but it's not a superior or higher evolved in essence. It's actually just a genetic flaw.
Evolving to *superior forms* the genes should become stronger, healthier, dominant. Only superficial people who cannot see beyond coloring will say the light features of Europeans are superior even less healthier/stronger, recessive not dominant.
In aesthetic sense, the light features can be viewed as a positive mutation, but in genetic health/strength sense, it's a negative one. It's a gene not as healthy/strong/dominant as dark gene, therefore, superficiality set aside, we can objectively say, it's quite lower or inferior gene. Many people are blinded by the coloring aesthetic appeal and rarity of the blue eyes and blonde hair that they cannot see the light of the truth.
Again, True beauty and True superior gene = Healthy, Strong gene. Dominant, healthy, strong gene is the natural and true basis of superiority. Not simply superficial eye candy or it has no substance.
Ok those light colors are rare and look nicer to many people but people have different preferences. There's something fascinating and mystifying with the clear misty dark marble starry East Asian eyes they speak to the soul and many are charmed by them. They look all the same? So are the blue eyes.
You can say light features is beautiful too like the dark features (or, more beautiful color to many people) but by no means genetically superior, in the true sense of the word. Having blue eyes/blonde hair/the White skin color of Europeans definitely doesn't make the possessor Higher evolved or Superior.
Asian eyes are not truly black. Most of the people who appear to have black eyes have, infact, extremely dark brown eyes that seem to be black. When a light shines in the eyes, you can see that they're a very dark brown color.
Can humans have black eyes colors?

Are blond haired, blue eyed people genetically superior to other hair/ eye/ skin colours?
"Superior as a whole - no. Superior (advantaged) in the cold Northern European environment that they evolved to adapt in - yes. You're correct that these were the some of the last features to have devoloped, since the environment that they developed for was one of the last settled. Though they are the latest, they may not be the greatest since they are not really superior as it only proffers an advantage in the environment it was developed in. The Caucasian race that sports these features was the most recent branch in our family tree, as they followed the retreating glaciers (global warming - oh my) and occupied Northern Europe. While the other races, which had been in place for tens of thousands of years, were already adapted to their own environments and had no need for these features. As a matter of fact these features, evolved to deal with colder environments, are actually a disadvantage/maladaption in other hotter (our original) environments. A good example is that a Caucasian in sub-Saharan Africa would be easily suceptible to sunburn, and other heat related casualties. Oddly in biological terms, these are actually specializations which , which in the long run may be a disadvantage in the hotter post-glacial world." Source(s): BS (Biology)
"The period of time for a mutation to appear has no correlation to the degree of "superiority" of the mutation. "
"Brown eyed/haired people are less prone to sun damage to their skin and can see better in bright conditions than blue eyed people... so no."
" No. The hair and eye colors or racial characteristics are just examples of endemicism (adaptation to local conditions).
Natural selection might have favored the development of hair and eye color in the cloudy environments they became most common in. Though I suspect sexual (mate) selection had more to do with it than anything.
Evolution is not a progressive linear transition from inferior to superior forms. If it was there would be no other life forms except the purported superior one. It is a continual reshaping of forms in response to selective factors of environment.
There is no such thing as a genetically superior organism. A form that is highly successful in one environment will fail miserably in another if the conditions that favor that form are replaced with unfavorable conditions.
I'll give a clearer example. If the ability to reproduce were determined by the ability to lift large weights people with weightlifter physiques would be more numerous than people with other builds. In an environment where sprinting determined reproductive success people with runner's builds would be more commonplace. In both instances apparent superiority would be dependent on external circumstance which, in the real world, is more complex and changeable.
Hair and eye color are the result of a very small number of genes which require only minor changes to produce. All of which could be re mutated out of existance if need be. Not some

clever re-engineering that makes the organisms 'better'."
"no, it makes you more likely to get cancer"
"No and yes ...
First, I would be very reluctant to say which skin/hair/eye colouring appeared last in the general population since I have no idea about that - and I wonder if anyone has even investigated that one yet.
My main point - variations in population like skin colour etc appear as adaptations to local conditions. So blond hair & blue eyes are very likely superior for the conditions prevelant in the geographical area in which they first appeared.
*BUT* these same variations could not be 'superior' in other locations ... otherwise the same variation (or very similar) would have appeared in a number of locations around the globe.
Since populations have only recently started to be connected in the sense of mobility and social interaction we are a long way from seeing what adaptations (if any) emerge in the global population as a result of the new environment of the 21st centurary and beyond. "

Re: The Truth about Blonde hair and Blue eyes.
(Part 8)
Regarding the Color Diversity of the Europeans supposedly makes them "superior".
Europeans may have more color diversity and that's aesthetically pleasing only, that color diverisity doesn't make them above or superior to races with less color diveristy as their color diversity was a result of gene mutation/lower melanin level only nothing more, and it wasn't exactly a superior evolution. Objectively speaking, the light eyes/blonde hair/pale White skin of the European race is biologically disadvantaged outside of aesthetic sense.
In humans, brown eyes contain large amounts of melanin within the iris stroma, which serves to absorb light at both shorter and longer wavelengths.
Brown eyes are the most common eye color, with over half of the world's population having them.
Why is it the most common? Because it's the original NORMAL human eye color, because it's the most advantageous in most conditions.
Light eyes is only advantageous in the environment they have adapted to.
If all humans had settled in Northern Europe part of the world and if most had blue eyes and blond hair, these colorings won't be viewed as special and if dark eyes/hair was rare they would be seen as special and a superiorly evolved gene, and rightfully so, as it's the stronger and healthier gene.
Scandinavians are fascinated to exotic dark featured people. It's a well-known fact.
If the blonde hair/blue eyes/White Nordic skin are so beautiful features then why the majority of blue-eyed/blonde/whit skinned women prefer dark featured men of theri own race as well as quite a lot of men of other races while many blnde/blue eyed/white skinned men have preference for dark featured women (dark featured european women as well as exotic dark featured women of other races). It's pretty common.
My own theory is that, aside from these colorings many of them find to be so common (not special in their reality) is many may have instinctively or subconsciously think/feel their recessive genes/very ligth coloring appearnce are quite not biologically normal and less aesthetically beautiful than darker featuers and desire a dark featured mate to reproduce a more balance, more normal, healthier, stronger offsprings. That's just my theory.
I've read many posts everywhere online light featured Europeans who state preference for dark features saying they're so light and want the opposite color of themselves. This is easily observed and in forums you'll read a lot of these light featured Whites saying things like "I LOVE dark features in guys or girls." They're surely excited with their darker color attraction similar to the disposition of people who have preferecne for lighter features.
If they themselves find these light features specially superior or most beautiful won't they want to preserve them pass on to theri offsprings?

About Red hair: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair
"It is associated with fair skin color, lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light."
"...when UV-radiation is strong (like in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer."
Pain tolerance and injury
Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain compared to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels),[35] while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain.[36][37][38] Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic.[39] Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men.[40] A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide.[38]
The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to be because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two different hormones: the skin pigmentation hormone melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the pain relieving hormone known as endorphins. (These hormones are both derived from the same precursor molecule, POMC, and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated MC1R gene, which produces a mutated MC1R receptor, also known as the melanocortin-1 receptor.[41] Melanocytes, which are cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R receptor to recognize and respond to melanocyte-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin, but if the melanocytes have a mutated MC1R receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. The MC1R receptor also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones.[41] Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some "cross talk" between the POMC hormones that may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.
There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding
complications.[42][43] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising.[43]
Red hair of pathological origin
Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:
In cases of severe malnutrition, normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde. The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor, is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine.
One variety of albinism (Type 3, aka rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea, results in red hair and red-colored skin.[44]
Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin

About Grey eyes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color
"A gray iris may indicate the presence of a uveitis. However, other visual signs make a uveitis obvious. Gray iris color, as well as blue, are at increased risk of uveal melanoma.
About Red and Violet eyes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color
The eyes of people with severe forms of albinism may appear red under certain lighting conditions owing to the extremely low quantities of melanin,[55] allowing the blood vessels to show through. In addition, flash photography can sometimes cause a "red-eye effect", in which the very bright light from a flash reflects off the back of the eyeball, which is abundantly vascular, causing the pupil to appear red in the photograph.[56] Although the deep blue eyes of some people such as Elizabeth Taylor can appear violet at certain times, true violet-colored eyes only occur due to albinism
