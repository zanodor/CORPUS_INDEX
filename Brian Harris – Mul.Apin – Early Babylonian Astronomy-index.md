Abstract - English
This thesis is an attempt to investigate whether the Babylonians of the periods prior to
the 6th Century BCE possessed an interest in the workings of celestial bodies reaching
beyond the scope of what would today be regarded as astrology – the idea that the
movements of the stars were signs from the gods, foretelling the future. The objective
is thus to see whether it is possible that at least some of the texts recording the
phenomena present in the night sky could have been compiled for what could be
termed a more “scientific” purpose: recording the stars out of an interest in how the
universe works.
It will be acknowledged that to the people of the time, the formal study of the
movements of astral bodies, as well as any supernatural implications they might hold,
were not separate fields. This, of course, stands in contrast to the differentiated
modern schools of astronomy and astrology. In order to investigate the possibility that
to some individuals the former took precedence (and by implication that they
possessed what could be termed a more “scientific” frame of mind), selected sources,
particularly the different sections of the text known as MUL.APIN, will be analysed
for signs of content and approaches more befitting to the field of generalised study
than that of divination.
It will be found, however, that although some texts do show signs of study isolated
from divination (through, for example, the inclusion of detail which would have no
relevance to the aforementioned), others, which at first glance appear purely
astronomical, contain information contrary to what would be expected of a thorough
investigation of visible reality. This includes idealised dates and intentionally falsified
information, inserted to have the recorded universe appear to conform to conservative
ideology. In order to make this point clearer, cosmological aspects of this ideology
will be introduced even before the astronomical texts are analysed.
Finally, it will be concluded that while scientific inclinations amongst the individuals
recording the stars during this era was by no means the norm, there are indications
that they were emerging in some. Though the field of Babylonian astral observations



during this period cannot, as a whole, be classified as a science, does not mean that all
its practitioners should be disqualified as scientific thinkers.
Opsomming – Afrikaans
Hierdie tesis is ‟n poging om te ondersoek of die Babiloniërs van die periode voor die
6de eeu v.C. ‟n belangstelling in die werking van die hemelliggame gehad het anders
as wat vandag as astrologie beskou sou word – die idee dat die bewegings van die
sterre tekens van die gode was wat die toekoms voorspel. Die doel is om te kyk of dit
moontlik is dat ten minste sommige van die tekste wat die verskynsels van die
naghemel aanteken vir ‟n meer “wetenskaplike” doeleinde geskryf is: die
dokumenteer van die sterre uit ‟n belangstelling in hoe die heelal werk.
Daar word erken dat vir die mense van destyds die formele studie van die bewegings
van hemelliggame, asook enige bonatuurlike implikasies wat hulle mag inhou, nie
afsonderlike velde was nie. Dit is in teenstelling met die onderskeie moderne skole
van astronomie en astrologie. Ten einde die moontlikheid te ondersoek dat vir
sommige individue eersgenoemde voorrang geniet het (en by implikasie dat hulle ‟n
meer “wetenskaplike” denkwyse besit het), word geselekteerde bronne, veral die
verskillende afdelings van die teks bekend as MUL.APIN, geanaliseer vir aanduidings
van inhoud en benaderings wat meer van toepassing op die wetenskaplike veld as dié
van divinasie is.
Daar is egter bevind dat alhoewel sommige tekste aanduidings toon van studie wat
onderskeibaar is van divinasie (byvoorbeeld, deur die insluiting van besonderhede wat
van geen toepassing op die voorgemelde is nie), bevat ander, wat aanvanklik suiwer
astronomies voorkom, inligting in teenstelling met wat van ‟n deeglike ondersoek van
die sigbare werklikheid verwag sou word. Dit sluit geïdealiseerde datums en opsetlik
vervalste inligting in wat ingevoeg is om die aangetekende heelal skynbaar aan
konserwatiewe ideologie te laat voldoen. Om hierdie punt duideliker te maak, word
die kosmologiese aspekte van hierdie ideologie bekendgestel voor die astronomiese
tekste geanaliseer word.



Ten slotte, word die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat ofskoon wetenskaplike neigings
onder individue wat die sterre gedurende hierdie tydperk gedokumenteer het geensins
die norm was nie, daar wel aanduidings is dat dit in sommige te voorskyn kom.
Hoewel die veld van Babiloniese sterrewaarneming gedurende hierdie periode nie in
sy geheel as ‟n wetenskap geklassifiseer kan word nie, beteken dit nie dat al sy
beoefenaars as wetenskaplike denkers gediskwalifiseer moet word nie.

1. INTRODUCTION
The night sky is beautiful to look at. Stars shining in the dark fascinate modern
viewers of the sky as much as they did people living thousands of years ago. For those
captivated enough to view the sky over long periods and across successive days, it
becomes obvious that the sky is not a stagnant beauty – everything in the sky tends to
move. Once the interest of the viewer has been peaked and attempts are made to
identify exactly how these objects move, astronomy is born.
Astronomy can be defined as “the disinterested scientific study of celestial
phenomena” (Black & Green 1992: 36). It is the science which deals with space,
celestial objects and the physical universe in its entirety (Concise Oxford Dictionary).
It is derived from Greek, “astro-nomos,” which means “star arranging.”
One ancient civilization which developed an early interest in the movements of the
stars was the Babylonians. Texts which deal with celestial phenomena are already
quite large in number by the beginning of the first millennium BCE, and these are by
no means even the oldest texts dealing with the subject. The Babylonians, as such, can
be said to be early examples of astronomers - investigators of the stars - and by
implication scientists.
According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary, science is defined as:
The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the
structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and
experiment; ) the systematically organised body of knowledge on any subject.
Science thus strives to find the nature of a given subject, without making assumptions
or drawing conclusions outside the observable evidence. How this knowledge is
applied does not matter; in Babylonian terms, as shall be discussed, it is therefore
perfectly acceptable that it be used to tell the time. However, once immeasurable and
unobservable factors are added, the system is no longer a science, but a belief. In
terms of the movements of celestial bodies, it is therefore important to divide
astronomy from a very similar term, astrology.



2
Astrology, in contrast to astronomy, is defined as “the observation of the movements
of the stars with respect to the divination of the future” (Black & Green 1992: 36).
Although the subject matter appears to be similar to astronomy at first glance, the
associations of the movements of the stars with the indefinite, unobservable and
incalculable factor of future events disqualifies it as a science, and thus separates it
from astronomy itself.
While the Babylonians are seen to have an apparent interest in astronomy, their belief
in astrology is without question. Very early in their history, texts appear which
connect the movements and appearances of the Sun, Moon and stars with predicted
future events. Unfortunately, the Babylonians did not distinguish between astronomy
and astrology (Koch-Westenholz 1995: 21), their similar subject grouping them
together into a single corpus, and thus it is often difficult to determine where the
science ends and the belief starts, if the science is present at all. This is particularly
true for the earliest celestial observations.
This interlinked nature of the two different modern terms often undermines the view
of the Babylonians as people with a scientific frame of mind. The modern assumption,
after all, is not simply that astrology does not belong to the field of science, but that it
goes against it completely. As such, the position of Babylonians as scientists is
questioned.
The investigation that follows is an attempt to define that the Babylonians were
not devoid of a scientific frame of mind with respect to the early observations of
celestial bodies.
2. DESIGN AND SOURCES
In order to prove a scientific mindset in the Babylonian approach to stellar
investigation, texts of suspected astronomical content need to be identified and
analysed for clues hinting towards this condition. Special attention obviously needs to
be paid to texts which were well known during antiquity, to see how far this principle
applies.



3
In order to identify such texts, a brief knowledge of the history of Babylonian
astronomy is first required.
The earliest texts indicating Babylonian interest in celestial bodies dates to
approximately 1700 BCE (Bienkowski & Millard 2000: 40). The interest during this
time, however, seems to be purely astrological; the texts all being what are known as
“omen” texts. A standard series of these omen texts was finalised in approximately
1000 BCE, and was named Enuma Anu Enlil. By this time, however, the first
astronomical texts, known as astrolabes, had already appeared – texts which made use
of astronomical observations to serve calendar functions. During the Neo-Assyrian
period (9th-7th centuries BCE), individual scholars were tasked to observing the
heavens in order to make predictions of the future for the king (Bienkowski & Millard
2000: 40). Many such letters of correspondence still survive. The astronomical
knowledge of this and earlier periods was then accumulated into a compilation text
known as MUL.APIN, this being in approximately the seventh century BCE, and
marks the end of the “early” period.
The “later” period began in approximately the 6th Century BCE, and saw the rise of
texts known as “astronomical diaries.” These recorded the positions of the stars each
night with incredible precision, as well as recording important political and economic
events (Bienkowski & Millard 2000: 40), possibly in order to draw up future omens.
From this period time onward, astronomy itself became more and more accurate, with
the periods of stellar phenomenon (including those of eclipses) calculated by means of
complex ephemeris tables (Olmstead 1938: 20). The transition of merely observing to
mathematically predicting astronomical phenomena has led to the astronomy of the
time as being classified separately as “mathematical astronomy.” The last dated text
of this period is dated 75 CE (Rochberg-Halton 1995:1932).
For the purpose of determining whether the Babylonians subscribed to a scientific
frame of mind during the earlier, non-mathematical period, the following texts have
been identified for investigation:



4
Enuma Anu Enlil (Section 4.1)
The first major text, Enuma Anu Enlil, is as has been stated, an astrological rather than
an astronomical text. In terms of popularity, however, it is the most widely known of
the stellar texts; so prominent, in fact, that it lent its name to the scribes of the entire
combined corpus. Despite being mostly of an astrological nature, there are hints in
one section of proper scientific approach – the oldest known. Enuma Anu Enlil thus
needs to be included in the investigation.
Astrolabes (Section 4.2)
The second text, the astrolabes, is the first example of a text which can be declared as
truly astronomical. The system it set in place was also followed by many of the
astronomical texts to follow, and so is an obvious inclusion.
MUL.APIN (Section 5)
The third text, which is also the primary text, is the largest compendium of
astronomical texts known from the “early” period of Babylonian astronomy,
MUL.APIN. The text will be divided into multiple sections, each suspected to
originate from a different source, and analysed in terms of its astronomical content.
This will serve to indicate exactly what the Babylonians knew and how thorough they
were in their investigations, as well as hinting at exactly how scientifically minded
they were.
AO 6478 (Section 6)
The final text to be discussed will be the unnamed tablet AO 6478, chosen due to its
relation to MUL.APIN, as an indicator of the progression of the systems used.
Texts of the later (mathematical) Babylonian astronomical corpus, such as the
Ephemerides, will not be covered. Though the accuracy of their data is extremely
impressive and their categorization as astronomical texts without question, it is more
important to investigate the appearances of the scientific mindset during the earlier
periods. While the ephemerides are known to be the “peak” of Babylonian
astronomical knowledge, the evidence of the existence and progression of the
scientific mind can be concluded without delving into these extremely mathematical
texts.



5
Before examining the identified texts, however, it is prudent to in fact first delve into
the unscientific side of astronomical knowledge. Since astronomy is the study of the
stars, it is important to define exactly what it is the Babylonians believed it was that
they were studying. The only sources for this information, unfortunately, come from
myth. While myth is generally regarded as “unscientific” itself, the fact of the matter
was that the scribes making the calculations of the astronomical tablets most likely
believed, or were aware of, these myths. MUL.APIN, despite being considered
“astronomical,” still indicates religious and mythological connections to its data.
Belief in myth does not stop one from still following scientific approaches, rather,
though it may in fact change the way data is approached.
As such, the cosmogony of the stars with respect to popular belief needs to be
investigated first, and perhaps the implications of these cosmological aspects with
respect to later astronomical systems introduced.
Enuma Elish (Section 3.1)
The first text to be investigated with respect to stellar cosmology is the Babylonian
Epic of Creation, Enuma Elish. It is chosen for the fact that it was the most well
known cosmological text in circulation during the period the others texts to be
investigated were written. Not only does it indicate how the stars came to be about, it
is also the origin of much of the religious connotations stars held even in astronomical
texts like MUL.APIN. The mention in the text of the system of astrolabes, one of the
astronomical texts to be examined, helps to define that text‟s prominence in society.
The discussion of Enuma Elish will be followed by a short description of other
creation epics for purposes of comparison.
KAR 307 & AO 8196 (Section 3.2)
The next set of texts, a pair of unnamed tablets designated KAR 307 and AO 8196,
are chosen as the only really valid sources of information for the belief of where the
stars could be found – what space entailed. While their dating should actually exclude
them from the period of investigation, their content is at least suspected to be older
than the texts themselves, and no other sources for this information are available.



6
The Etana Epic (Section 3.3)
The last cosmological text, Etana and the Eagle, is chosen to help better define the
information presented by the previous texts, KAR 307 and AO 8196, by giving a
finite value for one of the levels of Heaven, and thus limiting the actual height of the
stars in the sky. While this information does not seem very exact, it helps to provide a
stark contrast with values determined in the astronomical text AO 6478, and thus
shows that established institutions were sometimes ignored in favour of more accurate
data.
Finally, after the various texts have been investigated, a few points will be made about
the astronomical scribes, since it is their mind frame that is being analysed for hints of
scientific inclinations. A brief summary of the conclusions drawn from the
investigations of the various texts will then end the investigation.
3. COSMOLOGY AND THE STARS
Stars, in their most easily definable form, are points of light. The object (or objects)
emitting or reflecting this light is so far away from the observer that all we can see is a
tiny speck. Though seemingly obvious, a condition for being termed a “star” is that
this point of light must occur in the sky (else this definition could apply to things as
mundane and inappropriate as domestic lighting when viewed from a distance). In
true astronomical terms, however, a star is a giant ball of gas, constantly undergoing
nuclear processes, and as such constantly emitting electromagnetic waves. The light
waves produced from these reactions are particularly intense, such that the object can
be seen from extremely far away. Our Sun is, of course, such a star, albeit a rather
small and lonely one (most stars are many times larger and are often paired with a
sibling star). For ease of use, however, the term “star” is mostly used to describe all
the similar lights in the night sky, be they planets or entire galaxies in reality.
Ironically, star is usually not applied to the Sun.
In Babylonian culture, “star” has even broader connotations than the loose modern
usage of the word. The word for “star” is MUL in Sumerian (Horowitz 1998: 153) or
kakkabu in Akkadian (Civil et al. 1971: 45). MUL, however, can mean a fixed star, a
planet, a comet or an entire constellation. As such, when the term “star” is read in the



7
following sections, it should not be assumed to necessarily indicate a single star (in
most cases, in fact, it will refer to a constellation).
Since the modern understanding of stars has been acquired through the use of
complex instrumentation, it is understandable that the conceptualizations of the nature
of the stars in ancient Mesopotamia are by no means scientific. It is likely that even
the more scientifically-minded scribes would have based their assumptions of the
nature of the stars on fixed traditions. Since these assumptions would be likely, then,
to influence their compositions of later more scientific texts, it is necessary to
investigate what their likely understanding of the nature of the stars could have been,
and thus the traditions which would be suspected to lead to these views need to be
investigated. As such, it is the well-known stories and myths of the period in question
which need to be taken into consideration.
3.1 COSMOGONIES
When investigating the nature of the stars in the cosmological-religious sense, the best
place to start is the place where everything starts – to clarify, with stories of how the
universe began. Stars, as a prominent part of the universe, are likely to have their
origins explained in such tales. The first text to be discussed is, as such, the
Babylonian Epic of Creation, Enuma Elish.
3.1.1 ENUMA ELISH
Although the earliest exemplars of Enuma Elish available to us date back no further
than the early first millennium (Horowitz 1998: 108), it is believed to be somewhat
older. More likely than not, the story itself was probably conceived of as far back as
the Old Babylonian period, when the city of Babylon rose to the most prominent
position amongst the Mesopotamian cities under Hammurabi and his successors.
Enuma Elish, after all, introduces the Babylonian city god, Marduk, as the most
important of the gods, and installs him as the creator of the universe (Ee IV: 138-146).
Even if the myth was not conceived of during this period, according to Horowitz
(1998: 108) it was likely already established by the Kassite period. As he points out,
an inscription of the Kassite king Agum I (thus from approximately 1570 BCE)



8
describes how the cella of Marduk (and Sarpanitum) has its doors decorated with
creatures which have their origins in this creation myth.
As a text (or at least a story) which could have been responsible for an individual‟s
view of the world, and perhaps the stars, it is a likely candidate. Enuma Elish was
well known, being recited every year on the fourth day of the New Year Festival
(Oates 1979: 169), and so the view it presents would most likely be accepted as truth
in the absence of better alternatives.
As with other cuneiform texts, Enuma Elish is named after the first words which
appear on the tablet: enuma eliš la nabû šámamu. Together with many other important
texts in this field, it was first translated by King (1902), who translates this first line as
“When in the height heaven was not yet named.” The epic spans seven tablets, of
which we have many different exemplars. As such, much of the text missing from
King‟s initial translation has been filled in.
The translation used for purposes of this investigation is taken from:
Forster, B.R. 2003. “Epic of Creation (Enuma Elish),” in Hallo, W.W. (ed.) The
Context of Scripture, Vol. I: Canonical Compositions from the Biblical World.
Leiden: Brill.
All quotations from the translation itself are given in the format Enuma Elish [Tablet
number]:line numbers. Note that the spellings of names are not necessarily identical
Forster avoids signs such as Š.
According to this creation story, in the beginning, there was water... or more
specifically, the deities Tiamat and Apsu (Ee I: 3-5), the personifications of what
would later be the sea and underground water (Horowitz 1998: 109). They mixed their
waters together, and several gods were born: Lahmu, Lahamu, Anšar, Kišar (Ee I: 10
12). Anšar was the father of Anu, who was the father of Nudimmud (more commonly
known as “Ea”, also “Enki”– the names are used interchangeably even within Enuma
Elish). As such, the universe began not with the creation of a space, but directly with
the birth of deities originating from the water. This is an interesting theory, very
unlike the majority of creation stories throughout history, and has an interesting



9
modern link – most scholars today believe that all life on our planet indeed originated
from the water.
The space in which these gods dwelled, Anduranna (Horowitz 1998: 109), was inside
of Tiamat (the female of the original pair – of the “matrix) (Ea I: 4), and the activities
of the gods inside her were such a hindrance that she could not rest or sleep (Ee I: 38).
Together with Apsu and Mummu (said to be the pair‟s advisor, though his origins are
unclear) they plotted against the gods, but this plan was halted by Ea. He cast a spell
on Apsu, putting him to sleep (Ee I: 64-65), and stole his powers (aura) for himself
(Ea I: 68). The defeated Apsu is then forever turned into an ocean (Horowitz 1998:
111) on which Ea erects his own home after also defeating the advisor Mummu (Ee I:
70-71).
The fall of her partner enrages Tiamat, who then declares open warfare on her godly
children. By the end of the first tablet, she has created 11 new species of monster for
the sole purpose of warfare (amongst these are the creatures previously stated as
appearing on Marduk‟s cella), and chosen the god Kingu as her new companion,
granting him power and giving him the “Tablet of Destinies” (Ea I: 156). Tiamat is
not as easy an opponent as Apsu was: events can be summarised by Anšar‟s own
words (Ee III: 55-56): “I sent Anu, but he could not withstand her; Nudimmud was
afraid and turned back.” Eventually, the task fell upon the god Marduk (often referred
to as “Bel”), who accepted the task with one condition: he would need to be made
king of the gods (Ee III: 159). The gods agree, but decide to test his power, and now
an event of considerable interest to those seeking an understanding of Babylonian
cosmology with respects to the night sky occurs.
The gods create something which they tell Marduk to make disappear and reappear
through the power of his word alone. This word was originally translated by King as
“garment” (Ee IV: 19), but is now read as “constellation”. This first constellation
(lamā šu) is then made to disappear and reappear at Marduk‟s command (Horowitz
1998: 111). Horowitz‟s assumption that this is a forerunner of things to come is
probably correct – later constellations, after all, disappear over the horizon only to
reappear again on the opposite side a few months later. The investigation of Enuma
Elish cannot stop here quite yet, however, since at this point in the epic, even though



10
the first constellation has appeared, it is all alone and does not even have a place in
the sky to sit.
The epic naturally progresses into a fight between Marduk and Tiamat, where Marduk
defeats Tiamat by forcing her mouth open with wind (Ee IV: 98) and then driving his
spear through her mouth into her heart. Kingu is also defeated (having being so
terrified of Marduk that he could not accomplish much) and the monsters subjugated.
Marduk then takes the body of Tiamat, and uses it as building material to create the
rest of the known universe, the surface of the Earth (Ešarra) and the heavens (Ašrata /
šamāmū), each of them the same size as the already existent Apsu (Horowitz 1998:
112-113). He assigns each of these regions to a different god: Anu receives the
Heavens, Enlil the Earth and to Ea, he leaves the Apsu (which Ea himself had built
and claimed in any event). A note of interest: with respect to Ašrata (the heavens),
when Marduk speaks of it to the other gods later, is said to have a solid floor (“whose
ground I made firm” - Ee V: 121). This will be discussed in more detail in Section
3.2: The Three Levels of Heaven.
Marduk‟s shaping of the world eventually reaches the stage of most importance to
those interested in understanding Babylonian conceptualization of the night sky at the
beginning of Tablet V:
“He made the positions (stations) for the great gods. He established in constellations
the stars, their likenesses” (Forster 2003: 399 - Ee V: 1-2).
As such, according to Enuma Elish, the stars in heaven are all the creations of
Marduk, and, just as importantly, the stars are likenesses (we can go so far as to say
representations) of the gods themselves.
“He marked the year, described its boundaries. He set up twelve months of three stars
each” (Forster 2003: 399 - Ee V: 3-4).
These lines link directly with texts discussed later, the “Astrolabes” – they imply that
each month could be identified by a succession of three stars/constellations rising in
the sky within three separate bands, which will be discussed in more detail in Section
4.2: The Astrolabes.



11
“After he had patterned the days of the year, he fixed the position of Neberu to mark
the stars‟ relationships. Lest any make an error or go astray, he established the
positions of Enlil and Ea in relation to it” (Forster 2003: 399 - Ee V: 5-6).
Neberu is the only star in Enuma Elish to be mentioned by name, and is also,
according to Tablet VII line 136, one of the names of Marduk himself. As such,
Neberu is Marduk‟s star, and so it should be obvious that it has prominence. This star
is said to set the course for the rest, shepherding the stars like sheep (Ee VII: 130
131), but considering that there are three bands in the system mentioned, it required
two other stars to accompany it; these being the stations of Enlil and Ea.
After the creation of the stars, Marduk opens “gates” on the “two sides” (Ee V: 9)
this is a vague reference to gates which the Sun, Moon and possibly stars travelled
through as they appeared or disappeared over the horizon, the two sides obviously
implying East and West. The Gates of Heaven are mentioned often outside of this
text, particularly in prayers to Šamaš/Utu, such as the Prayer to the Gods of the Night
(Heimpel 1986:130). It should be noted, of course, that the Sun has not yet been
placed in the sky at this point in Enuma Elish.
After the stars are created, Marduk installs the Moon into the region known as elatu
(The Heights) (Horowitz 1998: 116). Sadly, Enuma Elish disappoints those hoping for
a glimpse of early astronomical insight on the part of the Babylonians by saying that
the Moon waxes and wanes simply because Marduk commanded it to do so (Ee V:
15-22). The fact, however, that Marduk commands that the Moon should wax for the
first 15 days of the month and then wane for the rest gives us a piece of seemingly
obvious but nevertheless valuable information: the length of a month was regulated
via the phases of the Moon. This is, of course, exactly the opposite of what is said, but
logical thought (as well as the simple fact that the system on months was in place
before the writing of this myth) dictates that this must be the case.
The information relevant to the study of the stars unfortunately ends at this point for
Enuma Elish, since lines 23-46 of Tablet V are incomplete in all known exemplars
(Horowitz 1998:117). The few fragments which are available indicate that they spoke
about the Sun, the year and the divisions of daylight and night-time (watches), which



12
would have been interesting to connect with the later texts to be studied. Sadly, when
the text picks up again at line 47, the focus has shifted from the astral bodies to rain.
Only after the stars and the heavenly bodies have been created does Marduk create the
features of the Earth‟s surface, despite the fact the Ešarra had already been conceived.
Interestingly, according to another creation epic, The Bilingual Creation of the world
by Marduk (CT 13), Marduk creates the Earth‟s physical surface by heaping dirt on a
raft (Horowitz 1998: 118). Amazingly, only after the stars and the surface have all
been created does Marduk separate the regions of Heaven and Earth, by setting up
Tiamat‟s crotch as a brace (Ee V: 61).
The epic continues with the creation of the city of Babylon and the installation of the
gods into heaven and the underworld. As written, the epic seems to indicate that 300
Anunnakkū were installed in heaven and 300 in the underworld (Ea VI: 40-44), while
300 Igigi were assigned to heaven and 600 to the Netherworld (Ea VI: 69). This is
possibly a mixture of traditions – later texts usually term the heavenly gods Igigi and
underworld gods Anunnakkū (Black & Green 1992: 34). The epic ends with an
exaltation to Marduk. Forster is of the opinion that this is the focus of the entire myth,
and as such the epic could just as easily be called “The Exaltation of Marduk”
(Forster 2003: 391). In terms of our understanding of Babylonian cosmology with
respect to the stars, as well as any hints to astronomical knowledge, the final two
tablets speak of very little apart from the aforementioned explanation of Neberu, but
there is, however, one other important exception: after everything else has been
created and the universe is in order, Marduk installs a final constellation, the Bow, in
the heavens (Ee VI: 90-91) – the constellation of the goddess Ištar (Horowitz 1998:
24).
To summarize the important data obtained from Enuma Elish:
Against all odds, there is not only mention of stellar cosmology, but also a reference
to an actual astronomical text within this epic. The mention of the astrolabes in the
“official” story of creation implies that this text was accepted and used on a wide
scale. It can be described, in brief, as a system in place to determine, via the stars,
what month of the year it was, and that Marduk‟s star (Neberu) played an important



13
role in this system. It can also be concluded that a principal time unit in use by all
societies (the month) was determined by astral phenomenon, the phases of the Moon.
Needless to say, however, that Enuma Elish is by no means an astronomical text, but
at least helps us better define the concept of what the people believed about stars in
the cosmological sense of the word.
In terms of astral cosmology: The first constellation was created by the various gods
to test Marduk, but the rest were created by Marduk himself. One constellation, the
Bow, was installed only after the rest of the universe was completed. The stars were
set up in the Heavens, which were created out of the body of Tiamat (implying that
they were created from water). The stars passed through the horizons via “gates.” The
Moon came into existence after the stars, and changed its form due to divine
command. Finally, the stars themselves were likenesses and representations of the
various gods. Quite often in astronomical texts, when referring to a star, the text will
refer to it as “the god.”
Unfortunately, Enuma Elish does not show any signs of a logical or scientific mind
behind any of the events that take place or the aspects of the universe that are created,
except perhaps for the already mentioned fact that the gods originated from water
(truly the source of life). More substantial evidence of the existence of Babylonian
scientific minds will have to be searched for elsewhere.
3.1.2 OTHER CREATION MYTHS
[Special mention must be made at this point to the work of Wayne Horowitz,
Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography, which simplified the task of investigating this
aspect of Babylonian cosmology. It is the foremost work on the subject, without
which this section would have required an intensive investigation all of its own.]
As has been stated, Enuma Elish is used as the basis of investigation for Babylonian
cosmological thought with respect to the creation of the stars because it was the
“official” account of creation, even though this implies a forced belief or one created
from propaganda. But, as has been mentioned, it is the account which would have
been most popular during the period we are interested in (the early first millennium



14
BCE). Particularly when speaking about broader Mesopotamia (rather than just
Babylonia) there are several different accounts of creation in existence, which one
would suspect to give different ideas about the heaven of the stars. Oddly enough, this
is not really the case – the stars themselves are usually just joined to the concept of
“heaven”, and given little prominence of their own.
Importantly, of course, is that the creator god (when applicable) of most of the
accounts is different – only two other accounts of creation by Marduk are known, the
first being the aforementioned Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk, known
from one relatively complete exemplar (CT 13) (Horowitz 1998: 129) and another
partial fragment. The second, The Babyloniaca of Berossus (see Burstein 1978), was
written after the period of relevance, and originated not from Babylonia but from
Greece (Horowitz 1998: 133) (albeit by a priest of Bel/Marduk), so does not apply.
For the most part, if a specific creator god is named, it is usually one of either
Ea/Enki, Anu or Enlil. To name some examples: it is in fact suspected that the
Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk was originally an Enki myth, as is
supported by the occurrence of the name on the smaller fragment text (Horowitz
1998: 130). Tablet NBC 11108, an UR III Sumerian tablet, attests that the first god to
exist (along with Ki, “the Earth”) and to “make the heavens shine,” (Horowitz 1998:
138) (possibly referring to the placement of stars) was Anu in his role as Heaven itself
(Rochberg 2005: 317); the same is true for the self-speaking ritual incantation When
Anu Built the Heavens (Horowitz 1998: 149). In the theology of the religious capital
of Nippur, the original creator god was Enlil (Rochberg 2005: 318).
Even when a specific creator god is not mentioned, the division of Heaven and Earth
is a popular, recurring theme, and the division of the three gods Ea, Anu and Enlil
amongst these regions remains the same, whether by claim or lot, such as in the
Akkadian Atrahasis (Horowitz 1998: 145).
Unfortunately, the most promising of all the variant creation stories, that which
appears in the Akkadian text designated K.7067 (Horowitz 1998: 147), is mostly lost.
Only 13 poorly-preserved lines remain. It appears that the text indicated that the stars
were created by the “Great Gods.” Since the line before this term introduces Ea, we



15
can only assume that the Great Gods must mean the three prominent deities Ea, Anu
and Enlil. While they are setting up the heavens, they “multiply the width by the
height” (line 6) – implying that everything is precisely calculated. Multiplying width
by height gives one the area of a rectangle, the use of which we cannot possibly guess
within the broken context, but the link to mathematical calculation has been made.
We read that the gods divide up the stations (hinting to the Astrolabe texts), and there
is mention of minas, the measurement used by water clocks, which shall be discussed
at length in Section 4.2: Astrolabes. The text also makes the link between the stars
and another aspect of the culture: omens and oracular decisions.
3.2 THE THREE LEVELS OF HEAVEN
The creation myths are the only available hints as to the beliefs of the origins of the
stars, but to hope for a more scientific theory of their origin is certainly out of the
question. None of the creation myths, however, hint as to exactly what the stars are. It
is claimed they are stations of the gods and their representations, but the real physical
nature of stars is never explained; nor is their place in the sky detailed.
Two tablets, unfortunately both from a much later period than the rest of the texts to
be investigated, help to clarify a few points concerning Babylonian beliefs about the
stars with respect to the latter – their place in the sky. While the tablets themselves are
from a later period than the rest of the text, it is suspected, however, that the views
they describe are much older, and should thus not be dismissed when attempting to
create a cosmic picture for the earlier periods.
The tablets in question are designated by the museum numbers KAR 307 and AO
8196 (Horowitz 1998: 3). The sections of interest reads as follows, taken from
Horowitz (1998) and checked against Huxley (1997) for KAR 307.
KAR 307
30. The Upper Heavens are luludānītu-stone. They belong to Anu. He settled the
300 Igigi inside.



16
31. The Middle Heavens are saggilmud-stone. They belong to the Igigi. Bel sat on
the high dais inside,
32. in the lapis lazuli sanctuary. He made a lamp of electrum shine inside.
33. The Lower Heavens are jasper. They belong to the stars. He drew the
constellations of the gods on them.
AO 8196
20. The Upper Heavens are luludānītu-stone. They belong to Anu.
21. The Middle Heavens are saggilmud-stone. They belong to the Igigi.
22. The Lower Heavens are jasper. They belong to the stars.
The two texts are remarkably similar – so much so that it is expected that they were
derived from the same source (Horowitz 1998: 8). KAR 307 adds extra information to
the end of each line, most likely derived from a second source. This combination of
data leads to a slight discrepancy, in that the Igigi gods are placed in both the Upper
Heavens and Middle Heavens (Horowitz 1998: 8), though that is not to say that they
did not occupy both. The placing of the Igigi in the heavens in general is known from
Enuma Elish (Ea VI: 69), and in line 37 of KAR 307, it is noted that 600 Anunnaki
dwell in the underworld. This is the later division of the gods known from the Kassite
period (approximately from the 15th to the 12th centuries BCE) (Horowitz 1998: 8),
and so this should be considered the earliest possible origin for the worldview
described within.
The text implies that the heavens are split into three different sections, Upper, Middle
and Lower, and each is said to be made out of a different stone - this warrants some
investigation before any astronomical assumptions can be made. The first, and most
logical assumption that can be made, is that the heavens are not, as in many other
cultures, a completely spiritual realm floating in the sky. They have a very physical
component: they are made out of stone. Of course, the gods live in the heavens, there
are shrines and sanctuaries – so the stones the heavens are made out of are probably a
description of their floors. Huxley (1997: 190) believes the opposite; that the stones
listed are for the roofs.



17
Of the three heavens, the highest level of the heavens, or Upper Heavens, is the first
to be mentioned. When Marduk is said to assign the heavens to Anu, this is apparently
the level he is given, or is at least the level in which he can be found. The Upper
Heavens are said to be made of luludānītu stone – a stone of which the modern
equivalent is unclear. Fortunately, the Babylonians themselves compiled a text called
Abnu-šikinšu, written for the very purpose of identifying different stones.
Abnu-šikinšu (STT 108) line 15 states:
“The stone whose appearance is red covered with white and black patches in named
of luludānītu stone” (Horowitz 1998: 10).
The Upper Heavens, as such, are said to be made out of a majoritively red stone. As
far as cosmology of the stars is concerned, however, this fact is of little importance;
the compositions of the two lower levels are of greater interest.
The Middle Heavens are where Marduk‟s own cella can be found, the doors of which,
as has been stated, were believed to be decorated with depictions of the monsters of
Tiamat. The floor of the Middle Heavens is said to be made out of saggilmud-stone.
For this stone, Abnu-šikinšu (STT 108) line 88 states:
“The stone whose appearance is like lapis-lazuli is named saggilmud-stone”
(Horowitz 1998: 11).
Lapis-lazuli, of course, is a blue stone. Interesting to note is that Marduk‟s (Bel‟s)
cella is said to be made of lapis-lazuli itself (according to KAR 307 line 32), creating
a picture of a very blue level of heaven. While important in the greater scheme of the
universe, this is still not the level of heaven of most interest to astronomical
investigation – that role belongs to the heavens one level down.
The level of the heavens closest to the surface of the Earth is naturally the Lower
Heavens. They are said to be made out of jasper, though this needs to be clarified. The
ancient term for “jasper” referred not only to the stone known as jasper today, but
almost all stones from its greater mineral family, chalcedony (Horowitz 1998: 13).
Most varieties of chalcedony are translucent – you can see through them. As such, it
is possible to look through the floor of the Lower Heavens and see the bottom of the



18
blue-coloured floor of the Middle Heavens – explaining why the sky appears to be
blue.
Jasper itself is not colourless, though, so an explanation is required to explain why the
shade of the sky was unaffected. Again, the best source for such information is Abnu
šikinšu, which, in lines 76-77 of the previously used exemplar (ST 108) state:
“The stone whose appearance is like the clear heavens is named jasper.
The stone whose appearance is like a rain cloud is named jasper.”
(Horowitz 1998: 14)
Jasper, then, is by itself the blue colour of the sky. Even without being translucent, the
sky itself would still appear blue. The second line from Abnu-šikinšu presents an
interesting thought – by relating the cloudy sky to jasper, it makes one wonder if there
is perhaps a connection. Other shades of jasper included purple, yellow and red
(Horowitz 1998: 14) – the colours of the sky at sunset. This is simply conjecture,
however; there is no evidence that the jasper of the Lower Heavens was in any way
transformational. No explanations for these changes in the sky are, unfortunately,
known.
While the nature and colour of light is of interest to scientific study, what is more
important with regards to the Lower Heavens is that they belong to the stars. The first
fact to note is that the stars and constellations are said to be drawn – the “paint” used
(which would help in identifying exactly what the physical stars were supposed to be)
is not mentioned, but the constellations are said to be drawn directly onto the jasper.
The term used in the text, inna muhhi, is said to imply that this inscription was done
on the side of the stone facing the Earth (Horowitz 1998: 14), so one did not look
through the translucent stone to see them.
Considering that the stars were seen to move across the sky in a fixed fashion, being
drawn on a solid surface seems a logical conclusion. Sadly, there are no satisfactory
explanations for this aspect of cosmology known from Babylonian sources, so it can
only be assumed that the people believed the skies rotated (Huxley 1997: 192), most
probably due to divine command.



19
In terms of astral cosmology, as such, tablets KAR 307 and AO 8196 thus help define
the relative position of the stars in the universe. They appear on a special surface of
the heavens, made of jasper, which is somewhat lower than the realms of the gods
themselves.
In terms of actual astronomical content, KAR 307 mentions two pieces of information
before the section introducing the levels of heaven, which have not yet been
introduced. The first is that the disk of the Sun in the heavens is 60 bēru, and that of
the Moon is 40 bēru (Horowitz 1998: 5). It is not stated how these values are
obtained, and should not be assumed to belong to a defined corpus. Naturally, these
values are nowhere near correct: with reference to the calculations which will be
presented in Section 3.3: Etana and the Eagle, the moon is about 17 times larger than
the given value (at 3476 km) (Reidy & Wallace 1991: 54), and the Sun is more than
4500 times larger (at about 1 400 000 km) (Harrison 1981: 25).
With regards to indications of increasingly more scientific approaches to recording
and explaining the phenomena of the sky, the tablets show varying amounts of
promise. KAR 307 is actually a religious compilation detailing mythological events,
and as such the completely arbitrary assignment of values for the sizes of the Sun and
Moon are not surprising. AO 8196, on the other hand, is in fact an astronomical tablet
with similar types of content to MUL.APIN (the primary text to be discussed). Sadly,
not much of the tablet remains intact, and in any event the text itself has an origin
later than the period of interest – but the scientific approach to the tradition of the
heavens, which is believed to be older, can be investigated.
Explaining the composition of the heavens through the use of stones is, to a certain
degree, logical. In order to conform to wider religious beliefs, which stated that there
were structures in heaven, they would need to have a solid floor. Through association,
solid material which thus matched the colour of the heavens is the obvious
conclusion. This process of association cannot, however, hold true for the Upper
Heavens, since they were not visible from the Earth‟s surface. The only explanation
for the constitution of the Upper Heavens, it appears, is mythological (thereby
virtually arbitrary) assignment originating in older traditions. Even while the listed



20
constitution of the Lower Heavens can be believed to have its origins in deductive
logic, this is not the type of logic a scientific mind subscribes to. Deduction from
baseless facts is not just unscientific; it goes against the spirit of science completely.
No hints of scientific approach can thus be detected within the theory of the heavens.
3.3 ETANA AND THE EAGLE
The highest level of the heavens mentioned in KAR 307 and AO 8196, the Heavens
of Anu, are mentioned in several other texts, one of which is the very well known
Epic of Etana. Like Enuma Elish, it is simply a story, but it deals with a real historical
figure and was so well known to the people of ancient Babylon that any apparent
cosmological information it included would likely have been incorporated into the
understanding of the general populace.
The translation used for the following section is taken from:
Dalley, S. 2003. “Etana” in Hallo, W.W. (ed.) The Context of Scripture, Vol. I:
Canonical Compositions from the Biblical World. Leiden: Brill: 453 – 457.
The Epic of Etana focuses around the king of Kish, Etana, who is searching for the
Plant of Birth so that he may lift his disgrace of not yet having had an heir (Etana II:
137–140). He asks the sun god, Shamash, for assistance, who tells him to seek the
help of an eagle lying in a pit.
The eagle itself is by no means ordinary. It is introduced in the beginning of tablet II
as the resident of a poplar tree growing in the shade of a throne-dais. The ground
underneath the tree is home to a snake. The eagle is said to catch wild boars, donkeys
and even bulls to eat – the snake/serpent similarly catches goats and cattle. Clearly
these are particularly large animals. The serpent, however, is wary of the eagle, and as
such they pledge before Shamash not to “overstep the limits” Shamash has set (Etana
II: 16). The eagle, however, does overstep its limits, and eats the serpent‟s young. At
the advice of Shamash, the serpent then sets a trap for the Eagle, lying in wait inside
the carcass of a wild bull (Etana II: 73-88). When the eagle starts to eat the carcass,
the serpent cuts its wings and throws it into the pit where Etana finds it.



21
After Etana nurses the Eagle back to health, the Eagle combs the Earth for signs of the
Plant of Birth, but is unsuccessful. Eventually, the eagle suggests to Etana that they
fly up to Heaven to speak directly with Ishtar, the goddess of birth. It is implied that
Ishtar would have been able to reveal the location of the plant, or possibly assist Etana
directly.
The fragmentary nature of the rest of the epic makes it difficult to determine exactly
in what order certain events now occur. In Dalley‟s translation quoted here, the first
attempt at an ascent into the heaven‟s fails, as Etana becomes scared, but after both he
and his wife receive a dream, Etana and the eagle attempt the flight again.
The second ascent into heaven is what is of considerable interest in terms of
understanding the Babylonian view of the universe: the flight is given a distance. As
the two are flying up towards heaven, the eagle stops each time after the pair has
ascended one bēru into the sky, during which time they gaze upon the land, Etana
amazed by how small everything becomes. After the third such stop, they eventually
reach the Heaven of Anu (Etana III: 38).
As has already been mentioned, Etana was a popular epic. Depictions from the story
already appear on cylinder seals from 2300 BCE (Baudot 1982: 1-8, Dalley 1993:
453), and the supposed author of the text, Shulgi‟s scribe Lu-Nanna, lived during the
late second millennium BCE (Dalley 1993: 453). Considering that the latest tablets
used in its translation originate from the Neo-Assyrian period, the epic was certainly
widely known. As such, most of the literate populace would have been exposed to the
value of 3 bēru for the height of the Heaven of Anu.
Dalley (1993: 45) translates the term bēru as “mile” in the translation quoted above,
but this is not correct. A bēru is defined in Babylonian terms as the distance in which
a person walks in 2 hours (Van der Waerden 1949: 6). Considering that the average
person walks at a rate of between 2.2 and 2.5 kilometres per hour, a bēru is roughly
equal to five kilometres. As such, the closest modern equivalent unit is the league (3
miles). Using this value, it can be stated that the Babylonians believed the Heaven of
Anu to be 15 kilometres up into the sky.



22
There is no mention of the other levels of heaven in Etana and the eagle; the epic is
undoubtedly older than the tradition of multiple Heavens. It is true that Etana and the
Eagle do make two stops before reaching the Heaven of Anu, but there is no
indication that these occurred due to reaching different layers. However, for those
people who used the traditional values of Etana, this meant that the level of the stars
would need to be much further down than the 15km mark.
In terms of astronomical value, the Etana epic contains no information. Any hint of a
scientific approach to explaining the visible universe is also non-existent; it is a myth
in which snakes are capable of eating cows. Unfortunately, due to its popularity, it
would nevertheless have influenced the conceptualization of the visible heavens in the
minds of later scribes by providing an unusual constraint. Luckily, this view did
eventually change, as will be discussed in Section 6: Related Text: AO 6478.
3.4 STELLER COSMOLOGY CONCLUDED
From the above sources, a basic picture of the stars can thus be concluded upon: They
were created by the gods and represented the gods; their divine connections, however,
are the only hint as to what they really “are”. They were painted onto the surface of
the lowest level of Heaven, made of Jasper, which rotated in such a way as to make
them appear to move.
While these concepts are important to know before delving into more scientific texts,
they are themselves void of any indication of scientific mind frames amongst early
Babylonian scribes. Having paved the way, however, it is now possible to begin
investigation of the more important works with actual astronomical implications.
4. EARLY ASTRONOMICAL TEXTS
It is impossible to give an exact date for the birth of astronomy in Babylon. While
texts themselves can be dated, it is impossible to tell when the first person, looking up
at the sky, tried to figure out exactly how it worked. Astronomical texts, on the other
hand, can be dated, though whether the oldest of those known today were the first to
be written is impossible to know. A large amount of texts (more than 1500) are



23
available for the period after 300 BCE (Rochberg-Halton 1995: 1932), but in order to
investigate the emerging scientific mind, it is the earlier texts that are most important.
Early astronomy, in this case, really pertains to that which was available up until the
composition of the tablets of MUL.APIN around the 7th or 8th century BCE.
Babylonian astronomical texts, whether early or late, focus on the movement of
celestial bodies. They realised that this movement had interesting implications, as
well as practical applications. Astronomy as a science thus began as soon as it became
apparent that recording this movement was a good idea. Amazingly, however, the
earliest attestable inclusion of astronomical categorization does not seem to have
practical application at all, and even more amazingly, this information is found within
a text that is, in fact, astrological.
4.1 ENUMA ANU ENLIL
Enūma Anu Enlil, or “When Anu and Enlil...” was the most important and extensive
collection of omens for its time. In its entirety, it comprised of (it is estimated) 70
different tablets and 7000 omens (Neugebauer 1969: 101). Many of these were
discovered in the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh (Aaboe 1974: 278), but only one
tablet is of interest to the investigation of astronomy and scientific approaches: tablet
number 63 (Reiner & Pingree 1975: 7).
Tablet 63 is also known as The Venus Tablet of Ammişaduqa. It is the final tablet in
the series to deal with the planet Venus (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 32), and by the time
the transliteration by Reiner & Pingree used as the source for this investigation was
compiled, it was already known from 20 different exemplars (Reiner & Pingree 1975:
7). The contents of the tablet (to be exact, its tenth omen) indicate that its original
sources originated from the period shortly after the “Year of the Golden Throne,”
which is known to be the eighth year of the reign of the king Ammişaduqa (Hunger &
Pingree 1999: 34). Several scholars have attempted to calculate the exact date in the
modern calendar for this year, but most of the conclusions are completely different.
The values range between 1500 and 2000 BCE (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 35), but the
value of approximately 1650 BCE has received the most acceptance. It should be
noted, however, that this is not the date for the compilation of the final tablet



24
appearing in the Enūma Anu Enlil corpus – this only came into being in about 1000
BCE (Neugebauer 1969: 101).
The lines numbers and data appearing in the following section are derived from:
Reiner, E. & Pingree, D. 1975. Babylonian Planetary Omens: Part One – The Venus
Tablet of Ammisaduqa. Malibu: Undena Publications.
The Venus Tablet of Ammişaduqa is made up of 59 different omens. These appear to
be made up of four different sections, of which the first and third sections make up the
bulk of the data. The fourth section repeats the omens of the first and third section, but
arranges them in chronological order of months. The second section, on the other
hand, deviates from the rest, and is in fact the section of most interest in terms of its
astronomical content (Reiner & Pingree 1975: 7).
Most of the lines of the Venus tablet follow the same format, of which examples are
given in the form of the first two omens:
1) On the 15th of Šabatu, Venus disappeared in the west, stayed away from the sky for
three days, and on the 18th of Šabatu, Venus became visible in the East: Adad will
bring his rain, Ea will bring his floods, kings will send other kings messages of
reconciliation.
2) On the 11th of Arahsamnu, Venus disappeared in the east, stayed away from the sky
for two months and (seven or eight) days, and on the 19th of Tebetu, Venus became
visible in the west: the harvest of the land will prosper.
Omens, of course, are predictions. They follow a very basic if:then format, if you see
something happing, it is a sign something specific will happen later. The “if”
statement is known as the protasis; the “then” statement the apodosis (Hunger &
Pingree 1999: 5). The omens of Enūma Anu Enlil follow this pattern, although in this
sixteenth tablet, the protases are somewhat complex. The apodoses, however, are
quite clear: rain and reconciliation for the first, prosperity for the second.



25
Within the omens, the planet Venus is described as disappearing and reappearing on
certain days of the year. The reason for this is quite simple: planets of the solar system
orbit around the Sun, but because they orbit it at different distance, it takes each one a
different amount of time to complete each orbit. The planet Venus has a closer orbit to
the Sun than the Earth, and, as such, will become invisible to the viewer when the
three astronomical bodies form a straight line. When the planet is on the opposite side
of the Sun to the Earth (known as the Superior Conjunction), the Sun obviously
obscures the planet from view. When Venus is between the Sun and the Earth
(Inferior Conjunction), while not being obscured, it will nevertheless not be visible
due to the Sun‟s brightness.
When Venus reappears in the sky, it will be visible on the horizon that day just before
dawn. This is known as a heliacal rising (Koch-Westenholz 1995: 30), a term that
will be used often within this investigation. Likewise, the last visible setting of a star
at sunset before it disappears (since it now crosses the sky during bright daylight) is
known as the heliacal setting (Koch-Westenholz 1995: 30).
The following is a list of data for the first 9 omens (and their repetitions), followed by
the 10th omen which simply mentions the Year of the Golden Throne.

Table 1: Venus Tablet data



26
It should be noted that periods of visibility are not listed on the tablet itself, they are
calculated here in order to correlate the data with the values which will be presented
from Tablet 64‟s second section.
The apodoses of the respective omens are as follows:
1) Adad will bring his rain, Ea will bring his floods, kings will send other kings
messages of reconciliation.
2) The harvest of the land will prosper.
3) There will be hostilities in the land, the harvest will prosper.
4) The land will be happy.
5) There will be rains and floods, the harvest of the land will prosper.
6) The harvest of the land will prosper.
7) There will be scarcity of barley and straw in the land, there will be ubbutu
8) There will be rains in the land, there will be ubbutu
9) There will be rains in the land, there will be ubbutu
[ubbutu may refer to famine or desecration, but its translation is uncertain (Reiner &
Pingree 1975: 13)]
By analyzing the data presented in these first tens omens, a few conclusions can be
drawn about the nature of this text.
While the purpose of the text appears astrological, the nature of the information
within the protases seems to be astronomical. The reason one can assume this is
because it is too complex to be a regular protasis. In terms of omens using stellar
phenomena as their protasis conditions, the format would generally require fewer
constraints. In this instance, Venus‟ heliacal setting for a specific day of the year, its
period of visibility and its heliacal rising are all noted. The identification of the data to
real years of the reign of King Ammişaduqa also implies that these are records before
being predictions. The systematic recording of phenomena in the night sky, in turn, is
a factor of astronomical approach.
The data itself has a few interesting implications:



27
Periods when Venus is invisible are, as has been explained, when it is exactly between
the Earth and the Sun and when the Sun is between it and the Earth. It remains
invisible for only a short time during the inferior conjunction (when Venus is between
the Sun and the Earth) and for longer at superior conjunction (when it is on the
opposite side of the Sun to the Earth). This is clearly recorded in the text, with
invisibilities jumping between single days and periods just over two months in length.
However, Venus and the Earth both travel around the Sun at a constant speed. As
such, the time it takes for them to return to the same relative positions to one another
and the Sun should always be the same. In other words the time it takes between, for
example, superior conjunction to the next superior conjunction should always be
constant. This value is known as the synodic period, and will be discussed in greater
detail in Section 5.2.2: [MUL.APIN Tablet II] Section XI: Planetary Visibility. In
terms of the data for Tablet 16, that means that adding the periods of invisibility and
the calculated values of visibility for each couplet of omens should always give the
same value, but:
For Omens 1 & 2:
3 days + 8 months 23 days + 2 months 7 days + 8 months 4 days
= 18 months 37 days
= 19 months 7 days
For Omens 3 & 4:
20 days + 8 months 19 days + 2 months 1 day + 8 months 29 days
(Note that an intercalated month is added to the period of visibility for omen 4.
Intercalation will be discussed at length in Section 4.2)
= 18 months 59 days
= 19 months 29 days
Clearly, the Babylonians did not yet realise at this stage how the planetary cycle
worked. The observations, as such, could not have been very accurate. Inaccurate or
not, the systematic nature of the data hints at the existence of an early scientific mind
at work. Had the apodoses not been added to the end of each observation, this text
would be indistinguishable from a true astronomical text. The apodoses in this text do



28
not seem to be connected with the recorded data in any event – identical apodoses are
allotted to several different omens in the text, as seen in the given section for omens 2
and 6, as well as 8 and 9, yet the omens with common apodoses do not share common
heliacal risings, heliacal settings or periods of invisibility.
While the original scribe for this section may have been thorough in his observations
(accuracy aside), both he and the scribes which copied the text after him made several
mistakes. Omens 4 and 6 list incorrect month names (Reiner & Pingree 1975: 17-18
footnotes) and days respectively, and omens 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 have different values in
some exemplars.
Before any final conclusions can be drawn with regards to Tablet 64, however, the
second system (used from omens 22 to 33) needs to be discussed. For this section, no
table of data is necessary. For all the omens of this section, Venus rises in the east,
remains visible for 8 months and 5 days, and then disappears for 3 months. After
reappearing in the west, it remains visible for (once again) 8 months and 5 days and
then disappears for 7 days (Reiner & Pingree 1975: 24).
There is no doubt that the second system was derived from a difference source to the
other sections of Tablet 64, and its contents indicate a huge shift in understanding. It
is clear that by the time this source was written it was understood that the synodic
period of Venus was constant. The very existence of an altered system implies a
striving for greater accuracy, and the quest for accurate understanding is one of the
hallmarks of the scientific mind.
Enuma Anu Enlil may have been most prominent in the ancient world for its
astrological function, but even there are these hints of a few scientific minds emerging
from within its corpus. It would, however, take quite a long time between the
recording of the data from the reign of Ammişaduqa in Tablet 64‟s source before the
first true astronomical texts would appear.

4.2 ASTROLABES
The first truly astronomical texts, per se, were known as astrolabes. Before continuing
with a discussion of the astrolabes, however, disambiguation is necessary, since the
term has more than one meaning.
From the Concise Oxford Dictionary:
Astrolabe (noun) - An instrument formerly used in making astronomical
measurements and in navigation for calculating latitude, consisting of a disc with the
edge marked in degrees and a pivoted pointer.
This is entirely correct; the term “astrolabe” originally referred to a device most often
found in the navigator‟s room on ships. It consisted of a circular section, and had an
astronomical function.
Astrolabes, in terms of ancient Mesopotamian studies, are entirely different...
although they are still circular, and have astronomical functions. Mesopotamian
astrolabes, however, were not used for navigation or the calculation of latitude, and
most importantly, they were not instruments - they were tablets. According to
Rochberg-Halton (1995: 1929), it is because of their similarity in depicting a cyclic
returning of the stars to the same place (after a year has passed) that led to these texts
being named “astrolabes.”
Several exemplars of the astrolabe texts have been identified and published.
Amazingly, however, the very first astrolabe to be published was not a single tablet,
but an astrolabe compiled from various fragments in the British Museum. It was
published by a man named Pinches in 1934 (Van der Waerden 1949: 10), and
remained the primary text for astrolabe studies for a long time.
The oldest knows astrolabe text is KAV 218, designated the Berlin Astrolabe, or
Astrolabe B. It originates from the reign of Tigleth-Pileser I, close to the end of the
second millennium BCE (Horowitz 1998: 155). It is highly suspected, however, that
the first astrolabes were drawn up in the Middle Babylonian period, or even earlier.
One passage of text from Astrolabe B can be linked to a much older Middle



30
Babylonian tablet, VAS 24120, while the system the astrolabes was based on appears
in the Middle Babylonian Prayer to the Gods of the Night (Horowitz 1998: 158-159).
Astrolabe B is what is known as a list astrolabe, but the original astrolabes were
actually round. To be more precise, they consist of three concentric rings. The
astrolabe is then divided into 12 wedges of equal size, and thus one astrolabe is
divided into 36 sections.
The top section of each wedge is given a label: a month of the year. The labels of the
months follow on one another chronologically in a clockwise direction. Just
underneath the month-label appears the name of a star, usually together with a
number. Each of the 36 different sections of the astrolabe follows this pattern.
The following tables contain the information presented on a typical astrolabe (most of
the data, apart from some variations of star names, remain constant for all exemplars,
though not all contain numbers) with the sections of at the bottom of the table being
the sections closest to the centre of the astrolabe. Those at the top are, in turn, closest
to the rim. The tables progress as if being read in a clockwise direction. In the case of
the stars, the mul determinative has not been included.

Table 2.2: Astrolabes continued
The three concentric circles are described as representing the three paths of the sky,
the Paths of Ea, Anu and Enlil. All the stars which can be found on the outer band
belong to the Path of Ea, those in the middle band belong to the Path of Anu, and
those closest to the centre of the astrolabe belong to the Path of Enlil.
To fully understand what these “paths” mean, it is important to in fact first jump to
one of the many sections of our primary text, MUL.APIN, for a definition. Though
they were already mentioned (at least by implication) in Enuma Elish, the Path of Ea,
the Path of Anu and the Path of Enlil remain vague until a clarification is made.
In MUL.APIN Tablet II the following lines appear (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 88-89):
A.1 From the 1st of Addaru until the 30th of Ajjaru the Sun stands in the path of the
Anu stars;
A.2 wind and weather.
A.3 From the 1st of Simanu until the 30th of Abu the Sun
A.4 stands in the path of the Enlil stars; harvest and heat.
A.5 From the 1st of Ululu until the 30th of Arahsamnu the sun
A.6 stands in the path of the Anu stars; wind and weather.
A.7 From the 1st of Kislimu until the 30th of Šabatu the Sun stands in the path
A.8 of the Ea stars; cold.



32
What this implies is that these “paths” are in reality bands across the sky, a way to
divide the sky into different sections.
To state some basic planetary facts, since the Earth spins about its own axis, as areas
of the Earth face the Sun they experience day, while those away from it experience
night. At the equator, the sun appears to travel directly overhead, but the spherical
nature of the Earth means that places in other latitudes view the sun from varying
angles - areas further away from the equator experience a lower arcing Sun. For areas
in the North, such as Mesopotamia, the noon sun would be visible in the southern sky.
If that was all there was to it, however, the Sun would always rise and set in exactly
the same place. The Earth‟s axis, however, is not at a perfect 90 degrees to its orbit,
but rather tilted about 24° to the right (clockwise). For this reason, points on the Earth
sphere are, at different times of the year (when the Earth is at different points in its
orbit) actually at different distances from the Sun. At the same time, their relative
position to the Sun, as well as the viewing angle, changes. For the Babylonians,
situated in the northern hemisphere, they are closest to the Sun when the Sun appears
to be at its northernmost declination in the sky.
Declination is a modern term, used to divide the sky up into measurable sections.
What it entails is to map Earth‟s own latitudinal lines into the sky. In other words, if
you are standing on the equator, the centre of the Earth beneath your feet, everything
directly above your head (stretching from one horizon to the next) lies on the celestial
equator. From other parts of the Earth, this imaginary line shifts just like the path of
the Sun shifts, sinking lower and lower into the sky towards the north in the southern
hemisphere and to the south in the northern hemisphere, however, the starting points
of the line are always due-east and due-west. The mid-point of this curved line is
calculated by facing towards the appropriate direction in the sky (for Babylon, this
would be south) and dividing everything ahead into 90 equal sections. With 90 at the
top, the celestial equator will cross the point (90-current latitude), so, for example at
the latitude of 35° North for Babylon, this would be at the point 55 increments above
the horizon. Though not quite in the regular sense of the word, these increments are
known as degrees, and the celestial equator is given the value 0, just like the equator



33
of Earth. In a similar fashion, the other latitudinal lines can be determined in the night
sky, and are measured by their difference in degrees with respect to the celestial
equator – everything above it is positive, everything below is negative.
A star which rises on the starting point of the band +10° will follow that particular
band until it sets, and so is a good indicator of which areas in the sky the look for a
star (its counterpart, Right Ascension, together with which exact positions can be
determined, is not of application to the Astrolabes).
While the rising and setting of the stars follows fixed routes, it has already been
explained that the Sun tends to wander. On a daily basis, it still seems to travel along
the paths of specific declinations, but over the course of the year it can be seen to have
strayed. Its northernmost declination (for Babylon) occurs at the same time when the
Sun is closest to the Earth, during the day of the Summer solstice, the longest day of
the year. At the latitude of Babylon, the Sun appears to be rising at an angle 30° North
of due East at this date (Horowitz 1998: 172), so +30°. During the equinoxes, when
the length of day and night are the same, the Sun appears to rise and set due East
West, thereby following the celestial equator at 0°. With sunrise at Winter solstice,
when the Sun is furthest away, it occurs at 30° South of due East (Horowitz 1998:
172), so -30°.
Analyzing the information obtained from MUL.APIN, additional information can be
calculated. This text clearly divided the year into four different seasons; one of heat,
one of cold, and two of moderate (to use the most positive derivation of “wind and
weather”) temperatures. These seasons are exactly how we still define them, and as
such the period of Simanu to Abu defines summer, Ululu to Arahsamnu autumn,
Kislimu to Šabatu winter and Addaru to Ajjaru spring. These periods are all exactly
three months long (which a comparison to the outer rim of the astrolabes can verify),
and as such the seasons were of equal length.
MUL.APIN directly states that the Sun is in a different “path” of the sky during each
of the different seasons. The only way in which such an equal division is possible is if
these “paths” were similar to the bands of the sky used in determining modern star



34
coordinates. If this is the case, the exact constraints of these paths should be
calculable.
In summer, the Sun travels through the path of Enlil. As such, the path of Enlil is the
northernmost of the 3 paths. During winter it travels through the path of Ea, thus this
is the southernmost path. On its way through the sky the Sun naturally travels through
due East twice throughout the year during spring and autumn, and this is exactly what
it states in MUL.APIN – the Sun travels along the Path of Anu during two seasons.
During a year, the Sun will have travelled through its 60° range twice, as such, its
travels a virtual 120°. There are four seasons of exactly the same length (3 months),
so in one season, the Sun moves 30°. Summer does not start when the Sun is at its
closest to the Earth and the temperature at its hottest, though – rather, the solstice
occurs in approximately the middle of the season. As such, when the Sun is 30° north
of due east, half of the summer has already passed, and as such the Sun would have
already moved half of the declination for one season, 15°. As such, summer would
have begun when the Sun was at +15°, and will end at exactly the same point. Exactly
the same is true for winter, when the Sun is in the South. This leaves the declinations
for autumn and spring between 15° North and 15° South of due East, which makes
absolute sense, as the equinoxes thus occur (correctly) exactly when the Sun is due
East (0°).
What this means for the three Paths is thus quite clear. The path of Anu should begin
exactly in the centre of the sky if one is facing east, with its borders 15° to the left and
right of this point. Since, according to the Astrolabe texts, as well as other sections of
MUL.APIN, we are certain there are only 3 paths, the Sun‟s limit of 30° North and
South should be ignored as far as the other paths‟ limits are concerned. It is only
stated, that the Sun travels within these paths, not that it defines them. Rather, when
facing east, everything to the left of the Path of Anu (in other words, everything north
of it), lies in the Path of Enlil; everything to the right (in the South) is in the path of
Ea. Since the path of Anu does not continue above the viewer‟s head, but rather slants
to the south to follow the celestial equator, the paths in fact have different shapes and
sizes. While the Path of Anu is a slanted band across the sky, the Path of Ea is a small



35
semicircle below it in the southern section of the sky, while the Path of Enlil
encompasses the entire northern sky and everything above the viewer‟s head.
The fact that the paths seem to focus on the southern sky is by no means strange – for
an individual standing in the northern hemisphere, the southern sky is the area of most
interest, with the highest concentration of stars. For stars to be visible from the surface
of the Earth, they either need to be extremely large and bright objects, or relatively
close (in astral terms). As such, the largest portion of stars visible from the surface are
within the same galaxy (the Milky Way) as the Earth‟s own solar system – this
galaxy, like many, is round and flat, and so the object within it are also concentrated
in a band. This band, like the celestial equator, is centred in the southern sky.
Figure 1: The Paths of Enlil, Anu and Ea
Returning to the astrolabes themselves, it is now clear that the stars closest to the rim
are thus the stars visible in the southern parts of the sky, those closest to the centre are
in the north, and those in the central band are basically in the middle.
The true name for astrolabes is actually “The three stars each.” The way the astrolabes
are divided means that for each wedge, one star from each of the three paths is listed.



36
Each of those wedges, in turn, is labelled by a month name. Astrolabes, as such, are a
form of calendar – each different month of the year is determined with the help of 3
stars. According to last section of Astrolabe B, the condition the stars in the
appropriate section of the list need to fulfil is, in fact, to rise. In other words, a star
listed in a section of the astrolabe will become visible for the first time that year
during the morning just before sunset – it will rise heliacally.
This system of three stars representing a month is specifically mentioned in Enuma
Elish tablet V, as mentioned in Section 3.1.1: Enuma Elish. To be mentioned in the
epic of creation, it can be assumed that the system behind the astrolabes had an
important function, and this is indeed the case.
The Babylonians defined months with respect to the Moon (Neugebauer 1947: 37).
Months started just when the moon began to wax – just after new moon. As passage
of four seasons took approximately 12 of these months, and thus this was designated
as the period for one year. The problem, of course, was that a true year is not exactly
12 lunar months long. Lunar months, in fact, cannot be expressed in terms of finite
numbers of days. An official Babylonian year of 12 lunar months was about 355 days
long – 10 days too short.
What this meant is that over time, seasons would begin to shift, and activities based
around them would no longer be predictable. People like farmers need to know
exactly when to prepare the soil and plant their crops, and thus are extremely reliant
on calendars. Astrolabe B‟s menology section itself states that Ajjaru is the month to
“turn the soil” and Du‟uzu is the time to “pour the seed” (Horowitz 1998: 164).
Luckily, the Babylonians realised that the stars would return to the same positions at
exactly the same time once every true year. The stars became markers for the calendar
that should have been adopted in the first place. What would then occur is that when it
was observed that the stars of the astrolabe rose a month late, an extra month was
added to that year in order to realign the lunar and stellar calendars.



37
When viewing the astrolabes, the numbers below the names of the stars seem to be an
odd addition. Fortunately, similar schemes appear in other texts, including
MUL.APIN, and can therefore be explained without too much of a problem.
The numbers on the list are generally referred to as minas and shekels in the list form
astrolabes. Mina is the term used for a weight of water that was used to measure time
by means of a special instrument known as a water clock. These weights of water
were poured into the clepsydra (bowl) of the instrument, which then emptied from it
by means of an opening or hole (Fermor & Steele 2000: 211). Though minas are
actually the weights of the water, they can also be used as the time unit itself (since
the weights always take the same amount of time to empty). The Babylonians
preferred to base their numerical systems on a base of 60, and in this way there are 60
shekels in one mina. One and a half mina is thus denoted as 1;30. This form of
annotation is a modern construct, though. Early Babylonian numerical texts require
considerable patience to decipher, since often numbers like 3, 180 (3x 60) and 10800
(3x60x60) are all simply written as 3 (Neugebauer 1969: 15-16).
Taking this into account, it is clear that the numbers of the middle ring are simply half
of those for the same month in the outer ring; the same is true for the inner ring
equalling half of the middle ring (thus a quarter of the outer ring) – they simply
indicate half watches and quarter watches („watch” is the term used to imply the entire
day or night respectively). Of more general interest is the progression of these
numbers throughout the months. By using the outer ring as a base, the value is highest
for Simanu, at 4 minas. It decreases at a constant rate every month until reaching its
lowest point during Kislimu, at 2 minas, exactly 6 months after its original peak. The
values then start rising again (keeping the same rate) until Simanu of the next year.
The exact implications of these values can be stolen from the primary text,
MUL.APIN, when it declares for a very similar system:
“4 minas is a daytime watch, 2 minas is a night-time watch”
The numbers visible on the astrolabes in fact represent the hours of daylight, which
are at their longest, according to this scheme, during Simanu. Simanu is indeed during
the Babylonian summer, and as such the day of longest daylight (the summer solstice)



38
is likely what is represented by the 4 minas. The shortest amount of daylight, as such,
will occur during Kislimu.
This data is, however, not very accurate. The ratio for the longest to the shortest day is
here 2:1, but for the latitude of Babylon, a ratio of 3:2 would be more accurate, and a
ratio of 7:5 would be close to the truth (Fermor & Steele 2000: 211). Neugebauer
(1947: 39) attempts to explain this discrepancy by explaining that the rate water
empties from most containers is not constant, but rather depends on the weight of the
water still in the container. He arrives at a value which in fact implies that the 4:2
mina ratio actually really does empty in a 3:2 time ratio. As logical as this sounds, it is
in fact at opposition with the data, since this ratio of emptying would result in an
inconstant rate of change.
In terms of accuracy, however, there are a few issues with the astrolabe texts which
need to be mentioned. First of all: with respect to the Paths of Ea, Anu and Enlil as
defined in MUL.APIN, many of these constellations are listed under the wrong
sections. Of course, since the astrolabes are older than MUL.APIN, the system was
perhaps not quite as refined yet. For the most part, the astrolabes hold true if one
considers the constellation listed under Enlil to be the northernmost of the three listed,
and that listed under Ea to be the southernmost of the three listed. As such, the
constellations may have been chosen more for their relative positions rather than their
existence in a defined band.
Secondly: some of the stars listed, like muldili.bat and mulsag.me.gar, are planets.
Planets do not rise in the same month every year, and as such cannot rightly function
as indicators for months. According to tradition, however, this is how things should
be, since Marduk set up his own station mulsag.me.gar (Neberu / Jupiter) to be the
watcher over the rest of the stars, and set the stations of Anu and Enlil to accompany
it (Ee V: 5-6). It can only be assumed that the other planets may have also been
included due to tradition, since they do not fit the necessary criteria otherwise.
As the first truly astronomical texts, the astrolabes do not disappoint. While not quite
as complex and rich in information as the texts which followed, they provide enough
to be clear and fulfil their purpose. For the first time, there are also hints of the



39
development of scientific thought patterns with respect to texts. For intercalations
schemes, the amount of information required is not actually very much. The heliacal
rising dates of 12 different stars could just as easily serve the same purpose. However,
the creator of the original astrolabe found it necessary not only to provide multiple
alternatives, but also to systematise them. The division of the constellations into
separate regions is an exercise in categorization, showing interest in the observed
phenomena. The addition of the data from the water clocks only goes to argue that the
individual was extremely thorough, since these values were not necessary for the
greater purpose, they were simply an alternative method of calculating the same
things (instead of watching for star risings, daylight could be measured).
Before proceeding with the primary text, one last point needs to be mentioned about
the Astrolabes. A few broken texts, such as K6087 (Van der Waerden 1949: 11) list
some of the astrolabe stars under the headings “The Stars of Elam”, “The Star of
Akkad” and the “Stars of Amurru.” The stars are listed as rising in the correct order
(Van der Waerden 1949: 11) but the division of the stars between the three paths does
not follow, and the stars are not given risings dates. The Astrolabes could possibly
have originated from these texts, but the texts themselves are too fragmentary to
obtain anything more than a suspicion.
5. MUL.APIN
While the astrolabes and even Enuma Anu Enlil show some signs of emerging
scientific views and methodology, the primary focus of this investigation is on a text
known as MUL.APIN.
MUL.APIN owes its discovery, or at least identification, like most of the texts
discussed so far, to L.W. King. In his 1912 publication, Cuneiform Text from
Babylonian Tablets, he published tablet BM 86378 via 8 plates (Hunger & Pingree
1999: 57). Its contents immediately sparked the interests of several scholars, including
Father X. Kugler, famous amongst his contemporaries and later scholars for his work
with the later mathematical astronomy texts (the work in question being a 1909
publication, Sternkunde - for praises of his work see, for example, Olmstead 1938:
113). More importantly, it also sparked the interest of E.F. Weidner, who made it a



40
mission to locate more exemplars of this text (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 3) and with
great success. These and other scholars published many discussions and
interpretations, all the while continuing the search for more tablets. A. Sachs, who
knew about Weidner‟s interest, also identified many British Museum tablets as being
a part of this text, and sent Weidner the transcriptions (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 3).
What makes MUL.APIN so remarkable is that it is, in its most simple definition, a
compilation of astronomical data. Although the connection of the stars to various gods
is mentioned and there is a small section on omens, the majority of the text focuses on
that which could actually be seen. MUL.APIN is a compendium of all that was
(believed to be) known, via observation or basic calculation, about the bodies of the
night sky, up until the point of its compilation – there is evidence for the use of a
multitude of different sources within its contents.
MUL.APIN spans across two tablets, of which only the first was published by King
back in 1912. The second would only be published 12 years later (Hunger & Pingree
1999: 57). As with cuneiform texts in general, the text is named after the first words
which appear on it, in this case being mulAPIN, the constellation (or simply “star”) of
the Plough. Its name is confirmed in the colophons (colophons being sections visibly
separated from the rest of the text, often by a line, and usually at the bottom of the
tablet) of several of the exemplars, amongst others the original BM 86378 (Hunger &
Pingree 1989: 123). Ironically, though many other tablets have been found, this first
text‟s clarity of lines and the fact that it is largely complete ensures that it remains the
basis for all the following texts. It is also most likely the most similar to the original
compilation of the text, since it specifically designates itself as “Tablet 1” (Hunger &
Pingree 1989: 8) and fits well in terms of content division with the tablet believed to
be closest to the original version of Tablet 2, BM42277 (which similarly calls itself
Tablet 2 of MUL.APIN) (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 8). Both are divided into four
columns.
To give a date to MUL.APIN is not simple, though the exact dates of two exemplars
are known from their colophons. The earliest of these is from VAT 9412+11279:
stated to be written by the self proclaimed “small apprentice scribe” Nabû-rešu-iši,
during the Eponymy of Sennacherib (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 123), giving the exact



41
date of 686 BCE. The later dated text originates from the reign of Seleucus. Though
the date is not stated on the tablet itself, the originally published BM 86378 is
estimated to have been copied in about 500 BCE (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 123).
Although the oldest confirmed date comes from the 7th century BCE, this does not
mean that MUL.APIN was compiled during this period. The chances are good that it
is a bit older. MUL.APIN, first of all, was a popular (or at least important) text in
antiquity. Evidence from other written sources is available (sections from MUL.APIN
are used and quoted in other texts), but the most obvious evidence is that when
Hunger & Pingree compiled their 1989 translation of the text, they were able to make
use of 40 different exemplars (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 3-4). Admittedly, this is split
into 28 versions of tablet I and 12 of tablet II, but the exemplars have different
origins. Only a fraction of all written texts survive – most texts, such as those quoted
in the section on creation myths (barring Enuma Elish itself, of course) only are
known from one or two existing tablets. Naturally, many may simply be lost in a
museum storeroom somewhere, and Weidner‟s drive to find more copies led to many
seeing the light of day when otherwise they would have suffered the same fate. Even
then, 40 is a high number.
This high total usually does not imply that several copies were made at once, but
rather that it was re-copied over time. This is usually evident in textual changes
between examples, creating time-based variations, though the list-nature of the data
presented has meant that this was not the case. The only real differences between
versions comes from the fact that 24 of the known tablets were written in Babylonian
script, while the other 16 were written in Assyrian script (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 3
4).
For most texts, discerning a date of origin is next to impossible. Dates for exemplars
can obtained through, for example, relative dating (such as comparing objects found
in the same excavation level to approximate a date), but to date the origin of a text
itself one would require knowledge of some form of calculable phenomenon, such as
the position of the stars at the time of its writing... which is exactly what a majority of
MUL.APIN itself is dedicated to, the positions of the stars in the heavens.



42
MUL.APIN‟s own content would have been the best form of evidence possible for
dating, but as it turns out, things are not that simple.
Exactly how the following dates were determined will be explained after the data of
the subsequent sections used has been investigated, but the most promising conclusion
is that from Reiner & Pingree‟s (1981) publication Babylonian Planetary Omens II,
that the majority of the data from MUL.APIN comes from the period 1000 BCE, and
was taken from a latitude of 36 degrees north, in Assyria. However: this is believed to
be the oldest data, and not all the data can be said to originate from this time. As has
been stated, MUL.APIN is a compilation drawn up from a variety of sources, some
even contradicting others in the information they present. As such, the date of
compilation is not reliant on the dating of the information, though admittedly knowing
the date of the youngest source would help to at least narrow down the range in which
the compilation could be carried out (i.e. between the date of youngest source and 686
BCE, the youngest possible date). Sadly, only some of the sources present data such
can be used to calculate their dates of origin; the youngest date is impossible to
calculate. It should also be remembered that the sources used to compile MUL.APIN
would have come out of the Astronomical Library in Babylon, where the majority of
such texts were collected, and could have been several hundred years old by the time
of their inclusion. Fortunately, as far as analysis is concerned, the dating of the
contents is more important than the dating of the compilation, and, as has been stated,
such dates can be calculated via the contents itself.
The contents of MUL.APIN can be divided into multiple different sections, each
section usually pertaining to a different source used, though the text itself does not
distinguish between them. Instead, it is up to the reader to group the relevant
information. In order to answers the questions regarding the Babylonian
conceptualization of the sky (what they knew, what they believed and what they saw)
each of these sections will be dealt with separately.
As previously mentioned, the translation which shall be used henceforth for
MUL.APIN comes from:



43
Hunger, H. & Pingree, D. 1989. MUL.APIN. An Astronomical Compendium in
Cuneiform. Horn: Verlag Ferdinand Berger & Sohne.
This translation makes use of column and line numbers derived from BM 86378, of
which here is quoted in the form “iii.5”, of which the lowercase roman numerals (iii)
indicate the column number, followed by the line number. Tablets I and II will be
dealt with separately, and as such Tablet II begins again with i.1.
5.1 TABLET I
5.1.1 SECTION I: STAR LIST
The first section of MUL.APIN spans 79 lines - the entire first column of the first
tablet and the first 35 lines of the second column. It soon becomes apparent that what
is presented here is a systematic classification of heavenly bodies: Line 39 of column
1, as well as lines 18 and 35 of column 2, make it clear that the purpose of this list is
to divide up the constellations (though sometimes single stars) according to the
different Paths in the sky in which one can find them; the aforementioned Paths of
Enlil, Anu and Ea from the Astrolabes.
Unlike the Astrolabes, however, there are not only 12 stars inserted into each path.
The Astrolabes had a very specific function, after all, in helping people to determine
the different months of the year via the use of the 3-star/constellation rising, whereas
the Star List seems to have been created for little other purpose than classification.
The uneven amounts of constellations in each Path are evidence of this, what is in the
list is what is simply what is seen; visible reality.
Following the name of the star, in each case, is the name of the god that
star/constellation is associated with. Despite the fact that scholars attempt to classify
MUL.APIN as a purely astronomical text, the stars were still most certainly associated
with the gods as had been done prior to, and following, the compilation of this text.
Since it is fairly certain that the three paths encapsulated the entire sky, the Star List is
in fact a list of every constellation known to the Babylonians (or Assyrians, as the
case may be for this particular section) at the time. As such, it provides the greatest
insight into what they believed they could see within the sky at night. As such, after



44
the introduction of the line, the original name of the constellation will be given, as
well as a list of modern stars thought to belong to the constellation in question (as
quoted from the list of modern star equivalents used in the primary translation
(Hunger & Pingree 1989: 137 – 138)). These modern associations, of course, cannot
be verified with absolute certainty, since most were calculated with the assistance of
later sections of MUL.APIN itself. This will be explained in more detail under the
appropriate sections.

mulSAG.ME.GAR
Modern stars: [The planet, Jupiter]
i.39. 33 stars of Enlil.
Thirty three is the highest number of stars listed amongst the different paths, which of
course makes absolute sense. According to the calculations made in the Astrolabe
section, this path encompasses the greatest portion of the sky. The stars and
constellations quoted from lines 15 to 21 are in fact circumpolar stars (Hunger &
Pingree 1989: 137), of which the circular paths in the sky are so high that they never
set over the horizon. It is unfortunate that this cataloguing of stars, an activity which
likely originated from a mind craving systemization, is nevertheless burdened by what



49
can only be assumed to be a forced inclusion of mulSAG.ME.GAR (the planet Jupiter)
to the end of this path. Despite the fact that later sections of MUL.APIN (Section
VIII: The Ecliptic Continued – Planets) attest that the scribes of the time recognised
that all the different planets followed the same paths through the sky, Jupiter was
most likely separated from the rest and included into the Path of Enlil due to its
connotations as Nēberu, the star of Marduk (Brown 2000: 116). Having it introduced
as an Enlil star in Enuma Elish, the formal creation myth of the time (more
specifically, it is stated as the star completing the trio of stars, of which the others are
Stars of Anu and Ea, as discussed in Section 3.1.1: Enuma Elish), meant that the
social pressures to keep it in this path would have made it impossible to contradict.

52
Modern stars: [The planet Mercury]
ii.18. 23 stars of Anu.
As expected, the Path of Anu holds less important stars/constellations than the Path of
Enlil, since its area is smaller. As is noted in the translation‟s astronomical
commentary, the very first star listed of this Path actually is actually associated in the
mythological/religious sense with god of the next path, Ea, since the religious
connotations of the separate stars would have been in place before the systematic
division of the sky (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 139). Notably, all of the planets known
to the ancient Babylonians (barring Jupiter) are also listed in this path. The route the
planets follow in fact entails that they do stray from this path sometimes, but since
they would be in this most of the time, it is the path with which they are associated.
5.1.1.3 THE PATH OF EA
ii.19. The Fish, Ea, who goes at the front of the stars of Ea.

(2) Original name: mulSUHUR.MÁŠku6

ii.35. 15 stars of Ea.
The Path of Ea holds the least amount of important stars or constellations as
predicted, since its area is even smaller than the Path of Anu.
The first section of MUL.APIN, as a catalogue, is already a sign of emerging
scientific tendencies. The systematic classification and categorization of the aspects of
the universe is one of the prime aspects of science itself. Sadly, as has been stated,
this scientific approach did have to accept compromises with respect to the
classification of the star of the primary god at the time, Marduk, in order not to cause
unnecessary trouble for the scribe.
5.2.2: SECTION II: HELIACAL RISINGS
As has been explained in Section 4.1: Enuma Anu Enlil, not all stars and
constellations can be seen at the same time. They appear on the eastern horizon one
morning, though can obviously only be observed briefly before the light of the Sun
hides them from view. Every day they rise slightly earlier, and after some time, these
stars can be seen during the night, eventually disappearing again over the western
horizon and remaining invisible again for some time.



55
Line 36 of column 2 reads: “On the first of Nisannu the Hired Man becomes visible.”
It is followed by several more lines of exactly the same style, listing a date and
stars/constellations becoming visible, up until line 12 of column 3. Even from the first
line, it is clearly evident that what is being presented is a list of dates on which certain
stars become visible in the sky, and line 42 of column 2 and lines 8-9 of column 3
clarify this even further: one constellation, the Arrow, is mentioned twice in the list
on the 15 of Du‟uzu it is said to become visible, following the same pattern as the rest
of the stars, while on 15 Tebetu it is specifically mentioned as now being visible
during the evening. Since the other entries follow the pattern as mentioned for the
Bow on 15 Du‟uzu, it is confirmed that Section II lists the heliacal rising of stars: the
time of their first visibility on the eastern horizon.
The information presented in this section can be summarized as follows:
Date of Heliacal Rising Stars / Constellations appearing
1 Nisannu Hired Man
20 Nisannu Crook
1 Ajjaru Stars
20 Ajjaru Jaw of the Bull
10 Simanu True Shepherd of Anu; Great Twins
5 Du‟uzu Little Twins; Crab
15 Du‟uzu Arrow, Snake, Lion 4 minas is a daytime watch, 2 minas is a night-time watch.
5 Abu Bow; King
1 Ululu (broken in all exemplars)
10 Ululu Eridu, Raven
15 Ululu ŠU.PA (Enlil)
25 Ululu Furrow
15 Tešritu Scales, Mad Dog, Habaşirānu, Dog 3 minas is a daytime watch, 3 minas is a night-time watch.
5 Arahsamnu Scorpion
15 Arahsamnu She Goat, Breast of the Scorpion
15 Kislimu Panther, Eagle, Pabilsag
15 Tebetu Swallow, Arrow now visible in the evening 2 minas is a daytime watch, 4 minas is a night-time watch
5 Šabatu Great One, Field, Stag

Table 3: Heliacal Risings
In arguing that the Babylonian approach to astronomy was at least partially scientific,
this section shows a bit of promise. As with the first section, it is an exercise in
classification. This time around, that classification is systemised even further by
presenting the information in clearly chronological order (the order of the Babylonian
months already being known from other texts). More importantly, however, is that
this section has practical applications – on the first of Nisannu, it is not stated that the
Hired Man “became” visible, but that it “becomes” visible – the text is meant to be
used as a reference for the dates when the constellations become visible every year. In
a sense, it is like an Astrolabe focusing on the use of single stars, but can be used to
determine more specific dates rather than just the current month. Having mentioned
the astrolabes, it is important to note that section II lists day and night watches for the
colures (equinoxes and solstices), just like the astrolabes, and in all the sections of
MUL.APIN these dates have all shifted backwards by one month (to be more precise,
the months have all been shifted forward). It can only be assumed that this was caused
by a formal alteration of the calendar by the administration, and as such falls outside
the scope of this investigation. Unlike the first section, there is no inclusion of
information that could be tied to religious beliefs, a factor which is so often brought
up in arguments against scientific thinking.
But, while section II does support the desire for classification and systemisation of
knowledge - hints of a scientific mind – it also introduces an aspect of thought which
the “true” scientific mind frowns upon: generalisation, or more accurately,
approximation.
The dates of the different heliacal risings, in each instance, seem to be rounded off
usually to the nearest 5. In a few instances, entries appear for the first of the month,
but these could just as well have been made for the last day of the previous month
(which, as shall be explained shortly, is considered the 30th for all the different
sections). Any systematic person, when asked to arrange data, will attempt to start



57
from a well-defined point, and so one can infer that the scribe of this section‟s original
source may have set his 30s to 1s simply so that he could start on the date of the new
year, 1 Nisannu.
Nevertheless, the simple fact is that stars are not grouped in such an orderly way that
the constellations people believe to see in them all rise perfectly within five days of
one another. This imperfection also creates a situation where it is rare for
constellations to rise at the same time, yet section II has, in some instances, three
rising on exactly the same date. As far as the search for the nature of the stars in terms
of scientific principals goes, deliberate approximation is a serious fault.
5.2.3 SECTION IV: HELIACAL RISINGS CONTINUED
Before continuing the investigation of the second section, it is prudent to skip straight
ahead to the fourth, since the information contained within it is extremely similar to
that found in section II of Heliacal Risings.
Section IV spans from column 3, line 34, to column 3, line 48. All the lines follow
exactly the same format as the first: “55 Days pass from the rising of the Arrow to the
rising of the star of Eridu.” Once again, the list deals with the risings of stars; this
time however, it lists periods between risings that do not always follow on each other
in a direct chronological fashion. The information presented is summarised in the
following table:
First Star/Constellation
Second Star/Constellation
Days between heliacal risings
Arrow Eridu 55
Arrow (line 35) ŠU.PA 60
ŠU.PA Furrow 10
Furrow Scales 20
Scales She-Goat 30
She-Goat Panther 30
Panther Swallow 30
Swallow Field 20

Field Fish 40
Fish Crook 35
Crook Stars 10
Stars Bull of Heaven 20
Bull of Heaven True Shepherd of Anu 20
True Shepherd of Anu Arrow (line 47) 35
Arrow Bow 20
Table 4: Days between heliacal risings
The first order of interest in this list is that, for the first time, simple arithmetic can be
performed in order to check some of the suspicions one may have regarding the
information presented.
According to section II, the Arrow rises on the same date every year, 15 Du‟uzu. In
modern astronomy, we know this to be the case; stars appear to rise heliacally on the
same date every year (with only a minor discrepancy) as the Earth returns to the same
position in its orbit around the Sun, and the same section of space becomes visible. If
one ignores the very first entry (Arrow to Eridu) and the very last entry (Arrow to
Bow), the constellations complete a full cycle: if one stars with the Arrow in line 35,
one can determine the amount of days until Arrow rises again in line 47. The sum of
days is therefore:
60 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 35 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 35
...Which gives 360 days.
In modern terminology, as has been stated, a year is defined as the amount of time the
Earth takes to return to the same position in its orbit around the Sun. This is known to
be 365 days, not 360. In fact, since the spinning of the Earth around its own axis and
its orbit around the Sun do not influence each other at all, this number is not quite that
well defined – it in fact takes 365 and approximately one quarter days (Stott & Twist
1997: 80). The data, as such, has faults.
When comparing this information with section II, a few interesting things become
clear. If we rearrange the heliacal risings of section II to start at Arrow, we see a huge



59
similarity in the choices of constellations listed, except that the list in section IV is
more selective.
The following 3 entries from section II stand out:
On 15th Arahsamnu the She-Goat rises
On 15th Kislimu the Panther rises
On 15th Tebetu the Swallow rises
Each of these constellations rise exactly one month after the other, and according to
section IV, the difference in days between the risings of She-Goat and Panther, as
well as Panther and Swallow, are in both instances exactly 30 days. Ignoring section
II‟s entry for 5th Arahsamnu (Scorpion), the constellation preceding She-Goat, the
Scales, was also supposed to rise on the 15th of the previous month (Tešritu), and sure
enough the period listed by section IV between Scales and She-goat is again 30 days.
As such, the dates for this section of MUL.APIN, and in fact all the sections of
MUL.APIN, follow the Babylonian system of the “ideal year,” when all months are
30 days long. Since there are 12 months in a year, a year is 360 days long. Even if one
takes the data for other intervals where the dates each month are not identical, such as
between Furrow (rising 25 Ululu) and Scales (rising 15 Tešritu), the periods (in this
case listed as 20 days) are always correct for all months ending on the 30th. This
concept of the “ideal year” is also known from texts involving administration,
particularly when money is involved (Brown 2000: 113).
From the previous calculations, it has simply been assumed that section IV lists
heliacal risings, though admittedly absolutely nothing would change if the author had
intended to list first night visibility, since the periods between each would remain
exactly the same.
Interestingly, section IV helps to argue in support of the hypothesis that the movement
of certain dates to the 1st of the month may very well have been a matter of personal
opinion, since for the most part the two sections corroborate each others‟ information,
perhaps to the point that they one may have once originated from the same source (or
perhaps, as Hunger & Pingree (1999: 65) attest, section IV was actually based on
section II, and the compiler of the text included this seemingly duplicated information



60
unknowingly). As has been stated, the dates and periods between heliacal risings for
the separate lists always match, but one date has a certain discrepancy: according to
section II, Crook rises on 20 Nisannu and Stars on 1 Ajjaru, but the difference listed
in section IV is 10 days, not 11. This would put the rising of Stars on the 30th of
Nisannu (or the 0th of Ajjaru) as suspected.
Sections II and IV together tell us much about Babylonian society in terms of its
calendar, but sadly, section IV adds little to the conclusions on the scientific approach
to information than was already apparent in section II, apart from reinforcing the fact
that the data used was often approximated. Not only does section IV keep section II‟s
rounded dates, but the calculations to determine the length of the ideal year indicate
that even this important facet of society (let alone scientific knowledge), supposedly
based on proper astronomical observations, was an approximation.
Interestingly, a theory presented by Van der Waerden in his publication “The Thirty
Six Stars” (1949: 19), is that the author of the original text of section II drew his
information from two different sources, one listing the risings on approximations of
the real dates, the other of the ideal dates. In Babylonian society, it is suspected that
the official new year started on 1 Nisannu, but that the astronomical new year began
with the rising of the star of Sirius (in the constellation of the bow) (Van der Waerden
1949: 19). This is, in fact, mirrored by sections II and IV of MUL.APIN – one starts
on 1 Nisannu, the other begins with a listing of the Bow‟s rising. Van der Waerden‟s
theory is that the first few (4-5) entries of section II were from a list of real dates, and
that when the two lists were added together the period in question would in fact (with
a fair amount of calculation and assumption) form a list representing a number of days
closer to a proper year. As such, he believes the author of the text to be aware of the
inaccuracy of the information, and attempting to fix it. There are clues that this may
be the case, or least that the first 4-5 lines of section II are taken from a different
source (Van der Waerden 1949: 19). The dates for these entries are, unlike the rest,
only divisible by 10 (if one takes 1 as 30). Also, section II happens to list the familiar
measurements for water clocks at the colures (solstices and equinoxes) on the 15th of
the respective months, but the equinox on 15 Nisannu, within the section supposed to
be from a different source, is left out. Note that the colures have little or no bearing on
the rest of the information from these two sections, and have thus been excluded from



61
the more detailed analysis. Van der Waerden‟s theory, however, is somewhat dated;
even the stars believed to make up the various Babylonian constellations have
changed since his theory was made. Also, if some dates were from the “real” calendar
and others from the “ideal,” the data from section II would no longer fit the data from
section IV. Even worse, it could imply that section IV was indeed just derived from
section II, but using misunderstood data. Even if the theory did hold true, it would
simply mean that one individual wanted to rebel against the system and correct its
mistakes – the theory is based on the assumption that the ideal and real calendars were
already known to be different. Scientific thought is naturally more prominent in some
individuals and less prevalent in others, and perhaps this is evidence of this principle
in terms of the Babylonians, but all in all, it is highly doubtful.
5.1.4 SECTION III: SIMULTANEOUS RISING AND SETTING
Though most scholars generally group sections II and IV of MUL.APIN together, the
third section, ranging from lines 13 to 33 of the third column, is also connected to
heliacal risings. The lines of the third section read as follows:
“The Stars rise and the Scorpion sets.”
Unlike the other two, however, no dates or periods are given, and in terms of modern
interest this section is treated on its own. What is recorded, quite simply, is which
constellations are disappearing over the western horizon when others are appearing in
the east. The available data is tabulated as follows:
Rising Setting
Stars Scorpion
Scorpion Stars
Bull of Heaven ŠU.PA
True Shepherd of Anu Pabilsag
Arrow, Snake, Lion Great One, Eagle
Bow, King She-Goat
Eridu, Raven Panther

Panther, Eagle Great Twins, Little Twins
Field, Great One, Stag Lion, Snake, Habaşirānu
Fish, Old Man Furrow, Mad Dog
Table 5: Simultaneous rising and setting
For the ancient scribe compiling MUL.APIN, inserting this section between the
sections modern scholars tend to group together would have made perfect sense. The
source for section II, after all, lists the dates of heliacal risings of stars. The source for
section III lists which constellations would set at approximately the same time as the
stars already mentioned rose. The source for section IV, interesting information but
nevertheless already mentioned, was inserted afterwards, to act as a form of
addendum. Placing section IV after section II would require the reader to search far
back along the text in order to determine what the dates of the setting constellations
were.
Of course, this is purely conjecture. The scribe could just as easily have copied over
the texts given to him by a superior from a pile, and scribes in the future would not
wish to alter the structure of an already existing text. If, however, the information was
grouped as previously stated, this is simply more evidence of mind frames striving for
logic and systemisation.
In terms of content, section III itself does not actually offer much more insight into
the possible striving for scientific thought. It is, after all, simply a list of visible
phenomenon – when one constellation is rising, the other can be seen setting. The
practical uses of the list during the time are a complete mystery, but perhaps that in
itself is an even greater indication of an approach to the scientific investigation of
reality: if the list has no actual application, then the only reason for its existence is
simply to be a list... a record of what was observed, jotted down out of pure interest,
and nevertheless chosen to be included in an important astronomical document simply
because without it the compendium would not be “complete.” Again, this is mostly
conjecture – there is no actual evidence, for example, that MUL.APIN was an attempt



63
at summarizing everything known about “astronomy” (the term itself not even
existing in any Mesopotamian language without including “astrology”), but
nevertheless, it does warrant thought.
Ironically, although this section of MUL.APIN was probably of least practical use
during the time when MUL.APIN was a textbook of the stars, it is the section
(together with Section V) which has answered the most questions with regards not
only to MUL.APIN but also to Babylonian astronomy in general.
To clarify:
The modern stars listed in Section 5.1.1 [MUL.APIN Tablet I] Section I: The Star
List, most certainly never appear in any ancient text. There is no Rosetta Stone of
Heaven written by the Greeks to tell us which constellations in their system were
equal to what stars in the Babylonian tradition – as such, for a long time, there was no
way to link any specific star or constellation in the sky with any known name. It is
known that it was the “Chaldeans” (the Greek name for the Babylonians) who
introduced the Greeks to both the concepts of astronomy and astrology, and as such
the chances are good that many of the constellations were kept, but which and to what
extent are difficult to determine. Only certain constellations have minimal doubt
towards their connection to both systems, via there apparent depictions of the same
things, such as the Crab (Cancer), the Lion (Leo) and the Goat-Fish (Capricorn), and
even then this doubt does exist – admittedly, the chances of two separate cultures both
envisioning a constellation depicting a hybrid water-dwelling goat and then placing it
in different parts of the sky is quite slim, but mostly even analogous constellations
would first need to be proven rather than assumed.
Starting with section I of MUL.APIN, the approximate paths in the sky followed by
specific stars or constellations is listed. Basic positioning is thus made known, but
little else can be inferred, and while the stars of the constellations in the Path of Ea are
narrowed down considerably, the enormous size of the Path of Enlil allows for little
deduction. Section II provides substantially more data – it provides the chronological
order of the risings of certain constellations, as well as the approximate dates on
which they rise heliacally. Together with the information from Section I, a general



64
idea can be constructed of at least where each constellation appeared in the
Babylonian sky with respect to the others.
What occurs in Section III (and Section V, to be discussed shortly), is that the
previously listed data is given important constraints: not only does one know that the
first star of the constellation of She-Goat rises on (approximately) 15 Arahsamnu, one
also knows that the last star of the constellation disappears over the horizon when the
Bow rises on about 5 Abu. Periods of visibility can be used to better approximate a
star or constellation‟s declination – low periods of visibility in the sky mean that the
stars rise and set in positions closer to the southern point of the horizon. Not only are
the declinations further defined, but the relations of the different constellations
become even more sturdily interlinked – a chain is formed.
Scholars, as such, have been able to use Section III‟s data to its fullest in creating
basic lists of Babylonian stars. The analogous stars listed in section I were calculated
by Reiner and Pingree; the most recent (and, by consensus, decently accurate) attempt
at creating a list.
The modern calculations have little to do with the ancient thought processes, however,
so will be largely omitted. It should be noted, however, that in most attempts at
identification the analogous Greek constellations (such as the Great Twins = Gemini,
The Scorpion = Scorpio) are often used as a starting point, and then once more data is
acquired, are investigated from a backwards perspective to see if they still fit in the
system. Another interesting technique, directly linked to section III, is that once the
general declination of a constellation is known, the difference in its period of rising
and setting can help to determine that constellation‟s constraints – its size. Heliacal
risings, after all, rely on the appearance of the first star of the constellation, while the
setting implies the disappearance of the last star. Once the declination for a star is
known, the amount of time it takes to set is also known, and the difference in time
between this setting of the first star and the setting of the last star can be used to
determine the amount of sky the entire constellation takes up.



65
Reiner and Pingree‟s work not only helps to define the constellations, but amazingly
the nature of the data in section III also allowed for an approximate dating of the text.
The reason for this is as follows:
Just as the Earth revolves around the Sun, the Sun revolves around the centre of the
Milky Way galaxy. As far as life on Earth goes, this has very little impact; there is no
creation of time-based phenomenon (seasons and the year) such as with the Earth‟s
orbit around the Sun. The Sun‟s orbit around the centre of the galaxy is, after all,
extremely slow.
As previously stated: when the Earth returns to its original position in its orbit around
the Sun, after a single year has passed, the same stars should appear in the sky again
at the same time. The same section of the sky, in other words, should be visible again.
The fact of the matter is that by the time the Earth returns to its same position, the Sun
itself has moved (actually, the entire universe has shifted slightly – everything orbits
around something else eventually) such that the Astronomical year in fact differs from
the Solar year – it is about 20 minutes shorter (Horowitz 1998: 153). This variation in
the lengths of the two types of years brings about a very important consequence:
during the date of the compilation of MUL.APIN section II, the Bow was said to rise
on the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. The date of its rising changes by
one day every 74 years, so if one knows which star to identify, and calculate back
from modern position to work out when this statement would have been true, a date
can be determined. Sadly, since the data of MUL.APIN comprises of infuriating
approximations, the process becomes longer.
To make matters more complex, not all portions of the sky are visible from the same
positions on the Earth – everyone is viewing the sky from a different angle. The view
of the stars from Babylon would not be identical to the view from Assyria. As such,
calculating when the bow rose for Babylon and when it rose for Assyria could lead to
(albeit only slightly) different dates. Not only do the positions of stars seem to vary
from place to place, but because the Earth‟s axis, which as has been mentioned is
slanted, actually wobbles (its slant changes slightly over the course of many
thousands of years) declinations even for one location actually do change.



66
However: changes in declination lead to alterations in the times of constellations‟
rising and setting. As such, simultaneous rising and setting actually becomes an even
more valuable constraint to the rest of the data – once the stars of the constellations
of, for example, the Scales and the Hired Man are known, the use of simultaneous
rising and setting, which (due to all the complex movements already mentioned) are
only correct for very specific times and viewing angles, finally allow for data to be
inserted into theoretical models which can help pinpoint, quite accurately, the origins
of the rest of the data. Reiner and Pingree‟s conclusions are that the data from
MUL.APIN for sections I, II, III and VI, are all mostly correct for a date of 1000 BCE
(Reiner & Pingree 1981). The place of observation, amazingly enough, does not best
fit Babylon, but rather of an area along the 36°N Meridian – in line with the city of
Nineveh.
5.2.5 SECTION V: SIDEREAL DAY
Following the simultaneous risings and settings, the fifth section of MUL.APIN is
only 2 lines long (column 3, lines 49-50). The section reads:
iii.49. The stars enter into the night in the morning 1 UŠ each day.
iii.50. The stars come out into the day in the evening 1 UŠ each day.
The two lines hint, obviously, at progression, since something is happening each day.
Entering into the night in the morning implies that something is occurring at a later
stage each day – it starts happening in the morning, but gradually enters into the night.
This continues during the night, now edging towards day. This is a phenomenon
already investigated: the varying rising times of the stars. The stars appear to rise
earlier and earlier each day, until eventually they become visible in the evening.
As the Earth orbits around the Sun, it spins around on its own axis. This, as has been
stated, causes night and day. One day, however, is not exactly equal to one spin of the
Earth‟s axis, but rather the period from when a point of the Earth‟s surface is directly
facing the Sun the next time it is directly facing the Sun; the time from noon to noon,
24 hours. Though the phenomenon is caused by the spinning of the Earth‟s axis, it in
fact takes a bit longer than a single spin to cover a full 24 hours, since the Earth



67
continually moves relative to the Sun. Regions on the Earth‟s surface, however,
“point” to the exact same section of space every time after it has completed one axis
revolution, a period slightly shorter than the Solar day. As such, with respect to
daylight, stars appear to rise earlier and earlier each day.
The term to define when a section of the Earth is facing the same direction of space is
known as a “sidereal day” – a length of time equal to its spin around its own axis. A
sidereal day is calculated to be 23 hours and 56 minutes long, 4 minutes shorter than a
Solar day, and as such, the stars should rise 4 minutes earlier each day.
Looking at the two lines from MUL.APIN, it is stated that the stars grow closer to the
night from the morning by 1 UŠ a day – in other words, they rise 1 UŠ earlier. UŠ is
known from multiple other sources to be a Babylonian unit of time, which is simply
confirmed again here. It subscribes to the typical base 60 system of most Babylonian
numerical units, in that it is divided into 60 GAR. Furthermore, 360 UŠ are known to
make up one day – so one UŠ is equivalent to, amazingly, 4 minutes of modern time
(Van der Waerden 1951: 22).
There is no indication as to how this value was calculated. As such, no conclusions
can be drawn about methodology with regards to scientific approaches. In fact, it
should be assumed that this value was obtained purely through numerous observations
and comparisons. All it tells us, then, is that someone, sometime, had the dedication
and drive to determine this.
5.2.6 SECTION VI: ZIQPU STARS
Section VI, which starts from the very first line of the fourth column, and spanning 30
lines, in fact consists out of two different lists (originating from two different original
sources). However, the extremely similar nature of the contents promotes that they be
discussed as a single unit, and truthfully, scholars such as Hunger & Pingree have
done the same.
Unlike the other sections, both lists of section VI start with lines which could be
termed “introductions”. The introduction to the first list reads:



68
iv.1. The ziqpu stars which stand in the path of Enlil in the middle of the sky
iv.2. opposite the breast of the observer of the sky, and
iv.3. by means of which he observes the rising and setting of the stars at night.
Lines 7 to 9, appearing after the first list, repeat this information. Rather than an
introduction to the following section, these lines are possibly a “conclusion”,
confirming what has been said – only a few words in the beginning of the sentence
have been changed.
iv.7. All these are the ziqpu stars in the path of the stars of Enlil which stand in the
middle of the sky
iv.8. opposite your breast, and by means of which you observe
iv.9. the risings and settings of the stars at night.
The second list, as such, most likely starts with the following lines, which also form
an introduction to the data that follows:
iv.10. If you observe the ziqpu, you stand
iv.11. in the morning before sunrise, West to your right,
iv.12. East to your left, your face directed towards South.
From these lines, it is noticeable that a completely new concept is being introduced,
that of a special type of star/constellation known as a ziqpu star. Fortunately, the
information gleaned from the two introductory sections is enough to discover exactly
what this term entails.
To observe a ziqpu star, a person should be facing south. This is a logical first step in
any astronomical observation since, as has been explained in Section 4.2: Astrolabes,
the majority of the objects in the night sky of the northern hemisphere appear in the
southern part of the sky. Since the ziqpu stars should be observed in the morning
before sunrise, one can suspect that they are somehow connected to the heliacal
risings of stars. Ziqpu stars, however, are claimed to be visible opposite the breast of
the observer – as such, when viewed the ziqpu stars will be due south in the sky. The



69
most defining feature, of course, is that they are all stars of the Path of Enlil. When
facing south, not much of the Path of Enlil can be observed – although the largest
path, containing the entire northern sky, only a very faint sliver of it is visible when
facing south. In fact, the only part of the path really visible, which can still be claimed
to be part of the southern sky, is that which passes almost directly overhead. This is
not a problem, however, since this is exactly what the final condition implies: ziqpu
stars appear in the middle of the sky, which can thus be implied to mean directly
above the observer‟s head. Ziqpu stars, by definition, are thus stars or constellations
which will, at some stage, pass through the very centre of the sky.
The first source of section VI is a very basic list of 14 such ziqpu stars, with no
additional information presented. The ziqpu stars listed are as follows:
ŠU.PA
Dignity
Standing Gods
Dog
She-Goat
Panther
Stag
Old Man
Crook
Great Twins
Crab
Lion
Eru (Frond)
Abundant One
The second list is somewhat more elaborate. Not only does it list ziqpu stars, it also
lists constellations which rise at the same time as the current star is fulfilling the role
of the ziqpu. This seems to have been the actual purpose in the identifications of ziqpu
stars – the introduction to the first list clearly states that they are the means by which a
person observes the rising (and setting) of the other stars. According to Olmstead
(1938: 116), a physical instrument known as a ziqpu (a type of pole) was used by



70
Tukulti-Urta I in the twelfth century BCE while rebuilding the Ashur palace. As such,
the stars most likely obtained their name from this instrument, as both would entail
the use of a vertical line to assist in making other observations. Ironically, while the
first lists states this function, it provides no data, while the second list, which provides
the data, does not explain why.
The format of the second list is as follows:
iv.13. On the 20th of Nisannu the shoulder of the panther stands in the middle of the
sky,
iv.14. opposite your breast, and the Crook rises.
The data can be tabulated as follows:
Date Ziqpu Rising Constellation
20 Nisannu Shoulder of the Panther Crook
1 Ajjaru Breast of the Panther Stars
20 Ajjaru Knee of the Panther Jaw of the Bull
10 Simanu Heel of the Panther True Shepherd of Anu
15 Du‟uzu Bright star of the Old Man Arrow
15 Abu Dusky stars of the Old Man Bow
15 Ululu Great Twins ŠU.PA, Eridu
15 Tešritu Lion Scales
15 Arahsamnu Eru (Frond) She-Goat
15 Kislimu ŠU.PA Panther
15 Tebetu Standing Gods Swallow
15 Šabatu Dog Field
15 Addaru She-Goat Fish
Table 6: Ziqpu stars
A quick glance at the dates in the second list immediately reminds one of Section II
they are rounded off. The chances are very good that the original source for the rising
constellation was the same as that used for Section II. Notably, the dates of the rising
for Bow and Field have been altered – they now occur on the 15th of their respective
months (both rise on the 5th in Section II). Hunger & Pingree (1999: 70) assume that
this was arbitrary; the dates were changed simply to fit the rest of the scheme, as no



71
risings for the 15th occur for these respective months in Section II. The dates for the
first four entries are not rounded to the 15th of the month; however, this may simply
have been due to the fact that the data would have become simply too inaccurate. The
ziqpu stars for the first four entries, after all, are single stars, not constellations. In the
first list, Panther is listed as a ziqpu star, but the constellation of Panther is extremely
large. The second list, which can be assumed was written later, divides it up into
smaller parts, making use of its prominent stars rather than the constellation as a
whole. As single stars, the observations would have stricter limitations, and as such
the author may have decided to keep the dates as they were, with the deviations at a
minimum. Of course, since the dates were rounded in the first place, and the Old Man,
also broken up, has its two prominent stars rising on the 15th, means that this has to
remain an enigma. Interesting to note, however, is that the unchanged dates are from
the part of section II‟s list which Van der Waerden (1949: 19) believes to have had a
different original source.
In term of scientific thought and approaches, the second list thus has negative
connotations. The scribe of this list, in order to conform to a scheme, seems to have
been prepared to arbitrarily alter known data to suite his own needs. The data,
inaccurate to start with, has been made even more so. It should be mentioned that this
is not something which does not occur in the modern scientific community – many
scientists are guilty of “tweaking” data to suits their own needs – but it goes against
what can be defined as the drive behind the scientific mind, the search for truth.
Comparing the two lists, it is noticeable that several constellations from the first do
not make it into the second. These are:
The Stag, the Crook, the Crab, the Abundant One and Dignity.
As it turns out, this exclusion is not completely arbitrary. According to the theory of
Hunger & Pingree (1999: 69), these ziqpu stars were cut because later scribes felt that
they did not properly fit the criteria – in other words, they should never have been
included in the first list in the first place.
Before proceeding, a few aspects on the modern system of locating stars via
declination need to be expanded upon. As mentioned in Section 4.2: The Astrolabes,



72
when determining the position of the celestial equator, it was explained that the point
above the viewers head is given a value of 90. The celestial equator is found in the
sky by subtracting the observer‟s latitude from this value. Since Hunger and Pingree
(1999: 66) believe this to have been from 36°N, this new point is designated the 0°
line. Working back up to the point directly above the observer‟s head, which is also
where the ziqpu stars appear, simply means to go up those 36 points again. Since
these points are intersected by the equivalent lines of declination, the ziqpu stars for
36°N should, in turn, all thus have a declination of close to +36°.
By calculating the right ascensions of the stars mentioned in the first list, Hunger and
Pingree came up with the following data:
Constellation ziqpu Star Declination
ŠU.PA α Boötes +35;2°
Dignity α Coronae borealis +39;50°
Standing Gods β Herculis +31;47°
Dog ζ Herculis +41;11°
She-Goat α Lyrae +39;47°
Panther α Cygni +37;33°
Stag γ Andromedae +26;7°
Old Man α Persei +35;16°
Crook α Aurigae +36;12°
Great Twins α Geminorum +31;43°
Crab ε Cancri +24;36°
Lion ε Leonis +32;57°
Frond γ Comae Berenices +44;17°
Abundant One β Comae Berenices +43°
Table 7 = List Va (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 69)
Since declinations of entire constellations are difficult to determine, as ziqpu stars,
Hunger and Pingree use bright and prominent stars from the constellations in
question. There is, of course absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians looked for
specific stars within the constellations – the ziqpu stars, unless otherwise stated,
should be assumed to be the constellations in their entirety. The calculation of the



73
declinations for these different stars, taken for 1000 BCE at 36°N, nevertheless does
give an indication of the declinations of the constellations in general.
The constellations which are no longer included in the second list have declinations as
follows:
The Stag +26;7°
The Crook +36;12°
The Crab +24;36°
The Abundant One +43°
Dignity +39;50°
Considering that ideal ziqpu stars should have declinations as close to +36° as possible, the
Crab and Stag are believed to have been cut from later lists because they were actually too
low in the sky. Similarly, the Abundant One is also too low in the sky, though in the opposite
direction (to the north). Ideally, the Frond, which has even higher declination than the
Abundant One, should have been cut as well, but was likely kept since it fit well with the date
criteria of the second list.
Dignity was likely excluded from the second list because it was unnecessary within the
required context, but the exclusion of the Crook is apparently an error. According to Hunger
and Pingree‟s (1999: 70) calculations for the second list, many of the entries are simply
wrong. The Crook would have been a better match for the entry of 5 Abu, the reason for the
selection of the Dusky Stars of the Old Man is unknown. It also seems that the scribe of the
original text, while copying from other sources, read them incorrectly – the true ziqpu star for
Arahsamnu is missing, and the star for the following month, Eru, is inserted in its
place. This error is repeated until the end of the section, ending with the She-Goat on
15 Addaru which should be the ziqpu star for 1 Nisannu, a date not mentioned in the
second list (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 70).
The Babylonians in terms of the second list can, on the one hand, be seen as
scientifically-minded. To scientists, concepts and theories require constant revision,
with disproven and irrelevant hypotheses discarded. This is exactly what the scribe of
the second list has attempted to do – to create a revision of existing knowledge, where
outdated concepts are removed (constellations too far from the centre of the sky
removed from the list) and new ones added (the splitting of Panther into sections).



74
The scribe of this section is also a very different type of scholar, clearly focusing his
time on the studying of secondary texts (since his knowledge seems to be based solely
on what he is reading, hence the numerous mistakes). His apparent drive to revise
outdated data is countered, however, by the fact that his errors are never corrected
after the first compilation of MUL.APIN, the sections do not change. Despite the fact
that many of the scribes possibly knew the information was incorrect, it was never
removed or changed in the later copies. It appears, then, that customs, traditions and
established institutions preventing the alteration of the text were considered more
important than actual scientific progress.
5.1.7 SECTION VII: THE ECLIPTIC
The final section of the first tablet is nine lines long, ranging from lines 31 to 39 of
the fourth column. As with section VI, a few introductory words are given to explain
the list that follows:
iv.31. The gods who stand in the path of the Moon, through whose regions the Moon
in the course of a month
iv.32. passes and whom he touches:
It concludes with the same lines, but adds “All these are” to the beginning of the first
sentence.
The list is as follows:
Stars
Bull of Heaven
True Shepherd of Anu
Old Man
Crook
Great Twins
Crab
Lion
Furrow
Scales



75
Scorpion
Pabilsag
Goat-Fish
Great One
Tails
Swallow
Anunitu
Hired Man
There is not much to clarify with regards to this list – the introduction is really self
explanatory. During its path through the sky, the Moon will, at some point, pass in
front of the listed constellations.
Notably, as shall be mentioned in the following section, since the Sun and Moon
travel across the same path of the sky, the Sun also passes through these
constellations. The rising of the Sun within specific constellations (thus passing
through them) is the definition of the Greek Zodiac. This list is, to be exact, a list of
the constellations on the ecliptic, discussed in more detail in the following section.
This list would have been extremely useful to the early scholars in the identification
of the Babylonian constellations, particularly since it confirms that many of the
suspected analogous constellations indeed followed the same path – Scales, Crab,
Scorpion, Goat-Fish, Lion, etc., and could thereby be assumed to be constituted of
roughly the same stars.
This list does not, unfortunately, add much to the investigation of scientific thought.
As with many of the other lists, it hints at a desire for systematic recording of
information, but the lack of additional data (dates) leaves this text feeling incomplete.
It is simply a record of basic observation with no practical application, not complete
enough to be considered to have been written by someone with a truly inquisitive
mind.



76
5.2 TABLET II
5.2.1 SECTION VIII: THE ECLIPTIC CONTINUED
PLANETS
The second tablet of MUL.APIN begins with the line:
i.1. The Sun travels the same path the Moon travels
In the next few lines, this information is repeated, each time replacing the subject with
a different “star”
Jupiter
Venus
Mars
Mercury (whose name is Ninurta)
Saturn
These are then followed by a short conclusion:
i.7. Together six gods who have the same positions, who touch the stars of the sky
and
i.8. keep changing their positions.
Apart from the first god, the Sun, the others are of a special type of star. In section I of
tablet I, each time one of these particular stars is introduced, it is added that it “keeps
changing its position and crosses the sky.” Unlike the other stars, the positions of
these five do not remain fixed. They are, of course, the five planets of the solar system
that can be seen from the surface of the Earth, the rest being invisible without the aid
of instruments. In other texts, stars are often referred to (metaphorically) as tame
sheep, while the planets are bibbu, wild goats.
This section is a logical progression from Tablet I Section VII: The Ecliptic (Section
5.1.7), which introduces the path of the Moon. Here it is just expanded upon by
explaining that the Sun and the planets, the only stars to change their positions with
respect to the rest, follow the same path – in other words, their progression through



77
the sky is similar. Not only that, but it is emphasized that they have the same
“positions” – likely indicating that they rise and set on the same points of the horizon
(Hunger & Pingree 1999: 73).
In the astronomical sense, this is perfectly true. The Moon‟s orbital path around the
Earth is approximately level with the Earth‟s orbital path around the Sun, which,
when applied to the illusion of these bodies crossing the sky, leads to them following
the same path. The orbital paths of the other planets around the Sun are also
approximately level with the Earth‟s orbital path, and so for them it is the same. When
describing the path of the Sun, Moon and planets across the sky, it is thus generally
stated that they follow the ecliptic – the term for the plane of the Earth‟s orbit.
The fact that the orbit of the various bodies in the solar system is basically level can
be explained by how it is believed to have formed – from a cloud of gases and solid
particles. Gravity pulls objects together, and so the centre of this cloud condensed to
form what is now the Sun. The Sun‟s gravitational pull caused the rest of the particles
to start spinning around it, and flatten into a disc. Any further explanation requires
delving into the nature of the universe and requires complex explanations requiring an
understanding of the nature of gravity and different dimensions (using the often joked
about but nevertheless relevant “rubber sheet” theory) so will be avoided – however,
to summarize, the planets and moons were formed by new centres of gravity attracting
other matter within this already flattened cloud.
Of course, why the Moon should be chosen to be the representative of the ecliptic in
MUL.APIN is never clarified. The texts itself offers no hints. It can only be surmised
that it was chosen because it is the most clearly visible and definable of the
astronomical bodies. While the Sun and Moon can be observed at the same time in
order to make comparisons, and similarly the Moon and the planets can be observed
at the same time, the invisibility of the planets in daylight means that it is difficult to
relate them to the Sun. The Moon, being the most clearly definable in its relation to
the rest, is therefore the representative of the path.
This passage indicates a willingness of the mind not to restrain itself to only a single
system – while Section I groups the planets together with the other stars due to their



78
similar appearance, this section group them together with the Moon and Sun due to
similar movements. The desire to interrelate data is a factor of scientific approach, but
then again, the movements of the planets are an indisputable observable fact, so
perhaps this assumption is unfounded.
5.2.2 SECTION XI: PLANETARY VISIBILITY
The structure of the second tablet of MUL.APIN is nowhere nearly as logical as the
first, at least to the modern reader. As such, the various sections of the second tablet
will not necessarily be investigated in order. Keeping to the investigation of the
planets, the next section to be investigated is therefore that which stretches from line
44 to line 67 of the first column.
This section of MUL.APIN is dedicated first to recording the amount of time the
various planets are not visible in the sky, and secondly to the amount of time they
remain visible in the sky. Together with their respective periods of visibility, a short
description of the planet is given.
It should be mentioned that this is the first section of MUL.APIN to list variables – in
some cases, several possibilities are listed. It is possible that the text from which this
section was copied into MUL.APIN was derived from multiple sources. The data is
presented here grouped in terms of the various planets, listed in descending order
according to their distance from the Sun (and increasing complexity of data) rather
than the order in which they appear in the text:
Saturn:
Appearance: Red or white
Saturn becomes visible in the East, and stands in the sky for
1 year
It disappears in West, and remains invisible for
20 days



79
Jupiter:
Appearance: Not given
Jupiter becomes visible in the East, and stands in the sky for
1 year
It disappears in West, and remains invisible for
20 days or 1 month
Mars:
Appearance: Bright red, or [missing] and small
Mars becomes visible in the East, and stands in the sky for
1 year 6 months, 1 year 10 months or 2 years
It disappears in the West, and remains invisible for
2 months, 3 months and 10 days or 6 months
Venus:
Venus appears in either the East or the West, and stands in the sky for
9 months.
It may disappear in the East, after which time it will be invisible for
1 month, 1 month 15 days or 2 months
and then become visible again in the West.
If it disappears in the West, it will be invisible for
0 (literally, it appears again the same evening), 3, 7 or 14 days
and then become visible again in the East.
Mercury:
Appearance: Red and bright or yellow and dark



80
Mercury becomes visible in either the East of West, remains in the sky for
7, 14 or 21 days, 1 month or 1 month 15 days,
After it disappears it will be invisible for the same amount of time that it was
previously visible, and may reappear in either the East or the West.
There is another entry for Mercury, which simply states
“Mercury becomes visible in either the East or West and disappears within a month”
its wording and style is most similar to the style used for the first entries (the
disappearances), but it is the very last line of the section. This is, perhaps, evidence
that two sources were used, and that the scribe forgot to include this information in
the beginning.
The Babylonian drive to observe and record led them, in this instance, to discover that
the planets moved at different speeds throughout the sky. This is caused by the fact
that the further planets are away from the Sun, the longer it takes them to complete a
single orbit. Unlike fixed stars, the planets keep moving, so after a year the planets
will not have returned to the same relative positions. The time taken for this to
actually occur is known as a synodic period, the time it takes for the Sun, Earth and
planet to form a straight line. When calculated correctly, this should be equal to a
planet‟s period of visibility plus its period of invisibility. Venus and Mercury,
however, will disappear twice within a synodic period, caused by the fact that they are
closer to the Sun than the Earth with faster orbital periods, making their visibility in
the dark somewhat erratic. When they are between the Earth and the Sun, as well as
when they are on the opposite side of the Sun, they are not visible.
The synodic periods for the different planets (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 74-75):
Saturn: 378 days
Jupiter: 398 days
Mars: 780 days
Venus: 584 days
Mercury: 116 days



81
The observations for Jupiter and Saturn, which are by far the easiest, are quite close.
For the rest, however, the data is a mess. As mentioned by Hunger and Pingree, there
are combinations of values under the different planets which do give values close to
what should be expected (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 74), but there is little or no
structure to the information. For Mars, to obtain a value close to 780 days, the longest
listed visibility can be added to the shortest listed invisibility, but the opposite
(shortest visibility with longest invisibility) gives a lower, different value, and the
intermediate values are simply impossible.
As for Venus – the values presented in this source were most likely derived from the
Venus Tablet of Ammişaduqa, the 64th tablet of Enuma Anu Enlil, discussed in Section
4.2: Enuma Anu Enlil (admittedly even in this tablet the periods of visibility hardly
ever reach 9 months). Astronomical scribes, after all, were all knows as the tupsar
Enuma Anu Enlil, a factor which shall be investigated in Section 7. These values
follow tradition, but that does not mean that they are correct. In general, a period of
visibility of 90 days for Venus is too long (Hunger & Pingree 1999: 74).
For Mercury, the observer clearly gave up on attempting to properly classify the
(truthfully daunting) data. Instead of ordering the values of the periods in such a way
as to allow a system to be followed, the periods are simply listed in values of
increasing numbers of days. Then again, the rest of the section follows the same
structure, so perhaps the scribe who copied this text misinterpreted what he was
reading.
This section is, without a doubt, an astronomical text – it exists purely to state the
obtained values, and does not attempt to interpret them (such as Enuma Anu Enlil
does with its similar data). However, with regards to the Babylonian approach to
scientific method, the text is wanting. Considering the fact that the lines were likely
copied word for word from the initial separate sources, a correlation of the data
cannot rightly be expected, but it should then also be remembered that these two
sources were inserted into MUL.APIN directly after one another for a reason. It is a
mystery why other scribes did not attempt to create a more complete version with
matching data for inclusion into this important compendium.



82
Then again, in terms of logic and the thoroughness of investigation, it is sad to say
that there is no evidence that the Babylonians realised that the periods of visibility
added to the periods of visibility would give a constant value in each instance. As
such, the scribes would not even see the need to match observations. Finally, the data
of this section is simply inaccurate. Somewhere along the line, the scientific approach
to the data was skewed and lost.
5.2.3 SECTION IX: INTERCALATION
Returning back to lines 9-24, the text reads as follows:
i.9. On the 15th of Du‟uzu the Arrow becomes visible.
i.10. 4 Minas is a daytime watch, 2 minas is a night-time watch.
i.11. The Sun which rose towards the North with the head of the Lion
i.12. turns and keeps moving down towards the South at a rate of 40 NINDA per
day.
i.13. The days become shorter, the nights longer.
i.14. On the 15th of Tešritu the Sun rises in the Scales in the East,
i.15. and the Moon stands in front of the Stars behind the hired Man; 3 minas is a
daytime watch, 3 minas is a night-time watch
i.16. On the 15th of Tebetu, the Arrow becomes visible in the evening. 2 Minas is a
daytime watch, 4 minas is a night-time watch.
i.17. The Sun which rose towards the South with the head of the Great One turns
and
i.18. keeps coming up towards the North at a rate of 40 NINDA per day. The days
become longer, the nights become shorter.
i.19. On the 15th of Nisannu the Moon stands in the evening in
i.20. the Scales in the East, and the Sun in the West in front of the Stars behind
i.21. the Hired Man.



83
i.22. On the 15th of Nisannu, on the 15th of Du‟uzu, on the 15th of Tešritu, on the
15th of Tebetu,
i.23. you observe the risings of the Sun, the visibility time of the Moon, the
appearances of the Arrow,
i.24. and you will find how many days are in excess.
Much of this information has already been presented in MUL.APIN. This is a list,
after all, of the conditions surrounding the colures (equinoxes and solstices). This is
evidenced by the inclusion of the data from the water clocks, which has been
explained in Section 4.2: The Astrolabes.
Additional information is given here in terms of the progression of the Sun with
respect to time – it is said to move at a rate of 40 NINDA per day. 60 Ninda equal 1
shekel, 60 shekels equal 1 mina. This is simply additional information, since the rate
can be calculated by dividing a 1 mina change in water by the amount of days it takes
to change, 90. Nevertheless, by clearly stating this information, we can confirm that
the rate of water exiting a water clock was supposed to be constant (which would
mostly counter Neugebauer‟s (1947:38) weight theory).
Apart from the water clock data, a few astronomical conditions are also set for the
dates of the colures – the Sun and Moon are expected to rise and culminate with
specific constellations on the specific dates. All this sees superfluous, as most if the
information can be found in other sources, but the very last line of the section hints to
exactly why these specific dates and observations are important:
“You will find how many days are in excess”.
This section, in other words, does not exist to list the phenomenon, but rather instructs
others to observe the sky on the given dates, and find out if the sky is different to what
is expected. As such, it is the first mention in MUL.APIN of the system for which the
astrolabes were originally created – the system of intercalation. Section IX cannot be
stated to be a purely scientific text – the purpose is more important than simply the
data. However, the nature of the information means it is still astronomical, and as
such saw its inclusion into MUL.APIN. There are little indications, however, of any
inclination towards scientific approaches.



84
5.2.4 SECTION XIV: INTERCALATION CONTINUED
There is a considerable leap in the text between the first mention of intercalation in
section IX and its next appearance in the second column. Clear progression of
information, however, demands that this second intercalation scheme be investigated
next.
This section starts on (what is calculated to be) the eighth line of the second column,
but it should be noted that from this point the numbering of translation used differs
from the original tablets. The reason for this is simply convention: As was previously
explained, line numbers are usually based on the most complete examples of tablets
discovered. For Tablet II, these line numbers are based on VAT 9412+11279, yet for
this tablet, what is believed to be the first 15 lines of the second column are missing.
Tablets which do preserve this information do not follow the regular format, and as
such, the consensus is to rather restart the column numbering from the first existent
line in VAT9412+11279. Section XIV, as such, starts with what the translators‟ term
“Gap A, line 8” (Hunger & Pingree 1989: 88-89, 131). It continues until the official
20th line of the second column.
The first two lines stated are the most unique, reading:
A.8. If, on the 1st of Nisannu, the Stars and Moon are in conjunction, this year is
normal.
A.9. If on the 3rd of Nisannu the Stars and Moon are in conjunction, this year is a
leap year.
The lines that follow them are all of a similar format, but usually focus on heliacal
risings:
ii.5. If the Fish and the Old Man become visible on the 15th of Addaru, this year is
normal.
ii.6. If the Fish and the Old Man become visible on the 15th of Nisannu, this year is
a leap year.



85
The majority of the information, like lines 5-6, simply state: if something should be
observed on the 15th of the month, but is instead observed on the 15th of the next
month, the year is a leap year.
Condition Ideal Date Leap Year
Stars and Moon in conjunction 1 Nisannu 3 Nisannu
Arrow rises 15 Du'uzu 15 Abu
Sun and Moon in conjunction 15 Arahsamnu 15 Kislimu
Arrow visible at night 15 Tebetu 15 Šabatu
Fish and Old Man rise 15 Addaru 15 Nisannu
Table 8: Intercalation
The Babylonians, despite keeping with their conventional system of assigning 12
lunar months to a year, were, as has been mentioned, were certainly aware that the
system was not correct. When months were too far off it caused problems for farmers,
and (most likely directly connected to this fact) the late rising of stars were quoted as
being unlucky (Horowitz 1998: 164). Here, the system of correction is described in
minute detail. The calendar would be fixed by introducing an extra month into the
year – an intercalary month – which is mentioned several times in the following lines
of this section. This month was not a new month, but rather a repetition of another
month in the calendar. Three such possible months are listed in MUL.APIN:
ii.18. An intercalary Nisannu belongs to the reign of Šulgi,
ii.19. an intercalary Addaru belongs to the reign of Amurru,
ii.20. an intercalary Ululu belongs to the reign of the Kassites.
These months obviously have historical significance, but sadly, this is not explained.
Most of the time, when the decision was made to intercalate, the month to be repeated
was the month in which the decision was made, and would follow it directly.
Line 12, appearing before these listing, states a fact that can be derived from the
earlier texts, but here is stated openly:



86
ii.12. 10 additional days in 12 months is the amount for one year.
The Babylonians, as such, were aware that the year they were using was exactly 10
days too short. The lines that follow are made up of commands. What they describe,
in short, is that if you discover a discrepancy of 10 days in the phenomena, you should
announce a leap year for the third year from then. Basically, the author of the text is
saying not to wait until the last minute, leap years can be declared in advance.
Astronomical data from these two sections is probably at its most practical, just as it
was for the astrolabes – the fixing of the calendar would have been vital to the proper
functioning of society. Yet these sections also provide evidence of a society bogged
down by unwillingness to reform established institutions. A more scientific and
accurate approach to the length of the year would have prevented these problems from
occurring in the first place. Practically, though, it must be admitted that basing dates
of the month on the lunar cycle was simple enough for the uneducated populace to
apply, while more accurate stellar observations would have only been possible for the
scribes. Practicality has to take preference over scientific accuracy.
5.2.5 SECTION XII: THE COMPASS
The final lines of the first column of tablet II present an interesting connection to the
most important aspect of practical modern astronomy of the last few centuries
compass points. During the day, it is relatively easy to find ones general bearing with
respect to the points of the compass. The Sun, after all, rises in the East and sets in the
West – observation around these times helps one to identify directions. Of course, on
a long trip, particularly at sea, heading vaguely north can land a person or ship in a lot
of trouble. The stars, per say, always have been better indicators. Constellations tend
to stick to their declinations at least, and as such bearings can be calculated very
precisely with the right reference material. For the casual observer of the sky, on the
other hand, even without complex reference books, basic compass points can still be
determined at night.
The key to basic observation is the existence of circumpolar stars or constellations.
These are constellations which appear to never actually rise or set (they still circle



87
around a fixed point, just never disappear beneath the horizon), and are found in the
part of the sky equivalent to the hemisphere of the viewer (a circumpolar star in the
northern hemisphere is in the northern sky). In modern astronomy, the best indicator
for North, in the northern hemisphere, is known as the Pole Star. In the southern
hemisphere, there is no true “pole star” – the exact southernmost part of the sky is
void of special stars – but the Southern Cross constellation always points to the south.
Of course, these constellations have shifted since Babylonian times, but MUL.APIN
provides its own list of constellations that served a similar purpose.
i.68. If you are to observe the direction of the winds: the Wagon lies across where
the North wind rises,
i.69. The Fish lies across where the South wind rises, the Scorpion lies across
where the West wind rises,
i.70. the Old Man and the Stars stand where the East wind rises.
i.71. On the day of your observation the stars will indicate to you which wind
blows.
The list insists on naming winds, but it can be surmised that this source was inserted
into MUL.APIN for its greater application of determining the compass points in
general. Even if this was not the intention, it did still fulfil this purpose.
Looking at the text, The Wagon (the constellation for North) is indeed a circumpolar
star which, at the time, had a small rotation. As a pole star (or in this case,
constellation) it would be accurate enough to serve as a general indicator for North.
As the star for South, the Fish was probably about as good as any of the various
constellations in the Path of Ea. It would, however, be invisible at times, and even
when visible it would only indicate a general southern direction. As for the
constellations for East and West, these would only be accurate for certain times of the
year. Constellations rising on the Eastern and Western horizons make large arcs
across the sky, and then set in the opposite direction. One can only hope that the date
for the information has been omitted; if not, the scribe for this source was extremely
ignorant. Scorpion, the constellation for West, is actually a constellation of the Path of
Ea (one would expect the Western constellation to be from the Path of Anu) so will, at



88
best, be in the south-western segment of the sky just before the time of its setting. The
best way to explain this is to emulate Koch (1995) in assuming that the Scales
(referred to in section I as “the horn of the Scorpion”) is what is actually being
referred to.
This section of MUL.APIN is an attempt at a scientific text with practical
applications. Sadly for a person attempting to apply this information without knowing
any better, it could get that individual hopelessly lost. As the text progresses, it
becomes evidently more clear that the scribe in charge of compiling the different texts
of MUL.APIN did not, himself, have much astronomical knowledge, or perhaps was
too worried about breaking tradition to allow him to ignore such an inaccurate text.
The scribes of the original sources for most of the preceding sections would have been
able to identify this information as false.
5.2.6 SECTIONS XIII - PATHS
The portion of MUL.APIN dealing with the Paths of Enlil, Anu and Ea has already
been dealt with in Section 4.2: The Astrolabes, and thus shall not be repeated. This
would have appeared in the first seven lines of Gap A.
5.2.7 SECTION XV – SHADOWS
It should be noted, before continuing with the discussion of section XV, that this
section has only a very shallow root in astronomy. It deals with the lengths of
shadows during certain times of day for the colures of the year. However, while not
an astronomical text per se, it is an exercise in scientific data collection. The data is
presented in a straightforward, unintroduced fashion, beginning with line 22 of
column 2.
ii.21. On the 15th of Nisannu, 3 minas is a daytime watch, 3 minas is a night-time
watch.
ii.22. 1 cubit of shadow, 2 and a half bēru of daytime
ii.23. 2 cubits of shadow, 1 bēru 7 UŠ 30 NINDA daytime
ii.24. 3 cubits shadow, two-thirds bēru 5 UŠ daytime



89
A complete table of the data can be presented as follows. Note that 1 mina of water in
a water clock measures 2 bēru of time – 1 bēru is 120 minutes long. Unlike the
regular base 60 system employed by most other Babylonian mathematical units, there
are only 30 UŠ in one bēru, as such, a personal notation is used in the following table.
The base-60 notation is kept for UŠ;NINDA.
15 Nisannu / Summer solstice 15 Du'uzu
Winter solstice 15 Tebetu

Table 9: Shadows
It is not stated exactly how large the object is which is having its shadow measured
rather it should be assumed that the shadow lengths in cubits are simply relative.
The closer the sun is to the horizon, the shorter shadows are – more of the ground is
obscured behind the object. They are at their shortest when the sun is directly
overhead, so at noon. The very first problem can thus be seen on the list with regards
to the winter solstice – 3 bēru implies 6 hours after sunrise.
In the regularly used system, since the winter solstice day:night ratio is 1:2 according
to Babylonian tablets, it means that the day is only 8 hours long. Noon, should occur
midway, after 4 hours of daylight, thus 2 bēru, and the shadow length afterwards will
increase again. This is not the case in the list, however – the shadow length continues
to decrease up to the 3 bēru mark.
Of course, the nature of the data in this list points to a very different assumption – that
the scribe used, as his ratio for day to night on the solstices the value of 3:2 rather



90
than 2:1, the value Neugebauer (1947: 38) tried to prove the use of in terms of
astrolabe water clock measurements. This is in fact very close to the correct ratio for a
location with Babylon‟s latitude, and this text is the earliest available example of this
ratio being used.
Even if one does assume the more appropriate ratio of 2:3 for the winter solstice
values, the day is 9.6 hours long, and noon should occur after 4.8 hours. The columns
for summer and winter solstice have, in fact, been swapped around (Hunger &
Pingree 1999: 80).
Upon closer examination, length of the shadow multiplied by the time in bēru gives
the exact same value for a specific date. The implication of this fact is quite important
– the data in this text was not all observed and measured – it was calculated. The
values are too perfect. It is also highly unlikely that a person going through the trouble
of painstakingly recording such values would get their own dates mixed up. This
“perfection” of the data is highly in contrast to the approximations of the first few
sections of Tablet I – as Hunger & Pingree (1999: 80) point out, when calculated
values would equal amounts of NINDA not writable in the base 60 system, they are
left out rather than rounded off. It is for this reason that the equinoxes stop at shadow
lengths of 3 cubits – 4 cubits would occur at 13;22 and a half (with no value smaller
than NINDA a half was impossible to write), and also why there are no entries for
shadows 7 cubits long.
As an astronomical text, section XV is sparse on information. It is simply made
known that shadows decrease in size throughout the day, and have different relative
sizes throughout the year (or, inversely, that they have equal lengths at different times
of the day). While this is tied to an important astronomical phenomenon, the
movement of the Sun, it seems a trivial addition. As a scientific text, however, it is
remarkable. The 3:2 shadow ratio implies that the author of this text was aware that
the day:night ratios for solstices were not 2:1 as previously believed – 3:2 also
happens to be basically correct for Babylon. Also, the extremely precise nature of the
data implies not only a scientific mind-frame, but that of a perfectionist. Considering
that many of the values were likely calculated, rather than observed, simply adds to
this view of precision – it indicates a dedicated drive to find out what is real.

5.2.8 SECTION XVI – NIGHT, MOONRISE AND MOONSET
The final section of astronomical data in MUL.APIN, tablet II, begins on the 43rd line
of the second column. Information is presented in couplets of lines:
ii.43. On the 1st of Nisannu a night-time watch is 3 minas 10 shekels; 12 UŠ 40
NINDA setting of the moon
ii.44. On the 15th of Nisannu a night-time watch is 3 minas, 12 UŠ rising of the
moon
Each couplet follows this basic format, listing the length of the night on the 1st and
15th of each month, and describing period of time it takes for the moon to set after
dark on the 1st (it should be new moon) or rise after nightfall on the 15th (when it
should be full moon).

Table 10: Sunset to Moonset / Moonrise
As far as lengths of the night go, this section returns to the original ratio of 2:1 for
day:night and vice-versa on the solstices. Not only that, it makes it clear that the
increase and decrease of minas / shekels of water in the water clocks were supposed
to empty at a constant rate. This list is really an extrapolation of already known data,
but instead of listing only the weights of water for the watches on the colures, it lists
them for every 15 days – the rate it took for 10 shekels of water to empty out.
The new information, as such, is the information presented on the times it takes for
the moon to rise or set respectively after nightfall. It indicates that the Babylonians
were aware of the relation between the periods of the Sun and Moon – the longest
difference in time between sunset and moonset occurs on the longest night of the year,
the shortest difference on the shortest night of the year. Not only that, but the
differences in the times between moonrises and moonsets followed on one another,
and were extremely linear – the rate of change was constant.
Despite how simple the list appears, it is possible that the values listed were
calculated rather than observed – once a few constants have been calculated for this
list, the rest are very easy to simply fill in. If that was the case, it may also be possible
that the rates of changes for the watches of the night may have been assumed, which
would make this text less disruptive to Neugebauer‟s (1947: 38) theory of water
clocks.
In terms of scientific approaches, then, the list might be seen as a rushed text
originating from short-cut methodology, something which an individual wishing to
state the absolute truth would avoid. If this was not the case, and the text was created
from observational data, then it is an exercise in systematic categorization like many
others. It should be notes that the text itself does not serve much more practical
purpose than any text simply listing the colures – it exists simply because someone



93
thought the world would be a better place if everyone knew the periods between
sunset and moonrises or moonsets.
5.2.9 SECTION X – OFFERINGS AND HORSES
Though section XVI is the final astronomical source in MUL.APIN, there are still two
sections of the tablet II which have not been covered. The compilers of MUL.APIN
thought it necessary to include them in this compendium of astronomical knowledge,
however, so they shall be investigated in brief. The first appears on lines 25 to 45 of
the first column. An example of the information presented is given:
i.25 On the 10th of Ululu the star of Eridu becomes visible, on the 15th ŠU.PA;
i.26. on the day their stars become visible you observe their risings, their glow and
i.27. their (untranslated), and the wind that blows; you guard the horses
i.28. so that they do not drink water from the river.
i.29. When their stars have been made visible,
i.30. you present offerings to them; horses
i.31. will touch bitumen and drink water from the river.
The rest of the section contains almost identical information, simply changing the
respective dates and constellations. This is clearly not, by modern definitions, an
astronomical text. It requires the observation of astronomical bodies, but has nothing
to do with the pursuit of recording of knowledge. It is, quite clearly, a text serving a
religious function. From the text, it is clear that the heliacal risings of the stars were
somehow special. When the star becomes visible, it is necessary to present offerings
to it, or at least to the god it represents. Though the text commands to watch for other
signs (such as the glow of the stars), it does not explain exactly what to look for with
respect to these signs, or how the consequent actions should change. For some
inexplicable reason, ŠU.PA, Eridu and the five planets all seem to have influence over
horses, or at least over horses‟ appetite for bitumen. Whether this was an aspect of all
stars, or at least the stars in terms of gods, is unclear.
In terms of hoping that the Babylonians were approaching astronomy from purely
more from the scientific angle, the inclusion of this text into the great astronomical



94
compendium of its day is a heavy blow. Clearly, the stars were not just vaguely
associated with the gods, but were so deeply steeped in the religious consciousness
that they were even made offerings to. The effect of not making these offerings – a
negative impact on horses – is completely illogical and unscientific. One can only
hope that the compiler of MUL.APIN inserted this text simply because it was based
on astronomical observations (heliacal risings), and not because it was deemed an
important element of the corpus.
5.2.10 SECTION XVII – OMENS
The second of the two non-astronomical sources in MUL.APIN also happens to be the
very last portion of the compilation, spanning from the 16th line of the third column to
12th line of the fourth, including an 8 line gap.
It starts with the line:
iii.16. If the light of the stars is red, the irrigated land will prosper.
This is, most certainly, an omen - it follows the general pattern of protasis-apodosis,
an if-then statement. All of the omens listed in this final section of MUL.APIN are, as
can be expected, related to astronomical phenomenon, though wind needs to be
included in the definition. As with other omen texts, the signs seem to have little
logical links to the effects.
In connection with section X, two linked omens should be mentioned:
iii.23. If the UR.RI.RI star approaches the Chariot, horses will die.
iii.24. If the UR.RI.RI star approaches the Furrow, the same.
Horses, without doubt valuable assets to society, are the only animals to be mentioned
several times within MUL.APIN‟s religious and astrological sources. MUL.APIN‟s
other omens, for the most part, also focus on the effect of the stars on the greater
society - mostly the king and the land.
iii.33. If Jupiter is bright: rain and flood.
iii.41. If the Sun sets in a nīdu-cloud, the king will die.



95
All forms of astronomical body, it appears, are listed harbinger for Earthly events
within MUL.APIN, be they stars or planets, the Sun or the Moon. Not all the entries
within section XVII are true omens, however; one in particular is more similar to the
commands of section X, but is in this case compliance is optional:
iii.35. On the day the Lisi-star becomes visible, a man should wake up at night all
that is around his house
iii.36. people, cattle, sheep and donkeys,
iii.37. and he must not sleep; he should pray to the Lisi-god, then he and all that is
around his house will experience success.
For the most part, the omens listed in this section have physically possible protasis,
but there are a few exceptions:
iii.48. If a star passes from the West to the East, for 3 years the land will experience
evil.
This event is ominous, of course, because it goes against the norm, but it is not only
unlikely; it is impossible. How it was determined what the effect would be if this were
to occur is difficult to fathom.
Unlike many other omen texts, MUL.APIN does not offer a counter-condition to its
omens. It lists the effects, such as the death of the king, but does not describe any
form of ritual to prevent this from happening.
In all, the astronomical bodies of section XVII are listed as harbingers mainly of
weather conditions (like irregular flooding patterns), deaths (and diseases); wars (and
revolutions) and every so often, prosperity.
6. RELATED TEXT AO 6478
While later Babylonian texts of mathematical astronomy (such as the Ephemerides)
are not of application for the current investigation, there are a few texts of later origin
that do deserve mention due to the similarity (and progression) of the content. One
such text is known from two tablets, K.9794 (from Assyria) and AO 6478 (late Uruk)
(Horowitz 1998: 182). Of these, however, only AO 6478 is viable for use, as K.9794



96
is a fragment of only 19 lines. The astronomical data is introduced in the second line,
and is translated:
“The distance between ziqpu stars that stand in the Path of Enlil in the middle of the
sky opposite the one who observes the sky, and the rising and setting of the stars that
he sees in their midst at night” (Horowitz 1998: 183).
Immediately a connection can be drawn to tablet I, section VI of MUL.APIN – this
source also deals with ziqpu stars. However, unlike the lists of MUL.APIN, AO 6478
does not list easily observable data such as concurrently rising constellations, rather, it
lists the measurable distance between the various ziqpu stars. Where this list is
particularly unique is that it introduces two completely new terms:
UŠ ina qaqqari (UŠ / degrees on Earth – possibly should read “sky”)
Bēru ina šamê (bēru / leagues in heaven)
For each period between stars, measurements are given in minas of water, UŠ ina
qaqqari and Bēru ina šamê.
The following table has been derived from a similar table of data presented in
(Horowitz 1998: 84).

Table 11: Stellar distances
The values for the difference in minas of water is quite straight forward, they indicate
the amount of time between one constellation and another are overhead, but it should
be noted the water clock outflow rate is not identical to those used to measure entire
watches. Here, one mina of water empties in about 24 minutes (rather than 240
minutes). The units of most interest, however, are the degrees, or UŠ. The modern
definition of a degree is derived from UŠ, and as previously mentioned, stars come
out one UŠ / degree (4 minutes) earlier each night. When adding the totals for UŠ ina
qaqqari, unlike regular UŠ, the total is equal to 364, not 360. 360, after all, is an ideal
rounded value used simply for its ease of application in the base-60 (hexagesimal)
system. By implication, since one rotation of the sky is made up of 364 UŠ, the length
of duration for a day is now off. However, the value for one year, when considering
that stars rise one UŠ earlier each day, is now much closer to the real value – 364 days
is a much closer approximation to a year‟s length than 360. The value for the variant
UŠ ina qaqqari was perhaps thus slightly different from the regular UŠ, but it is
difficult to determine.



98
What is of even more interest, however, is the value for Bēru ina šamê. Generally, 30
UŠ = 1 bēru. However, for AO 6478, 1 UŠ is equal to 1800 bēru. As such, there is
only one possibility: the bēru here indicate actual distances (Horowitz 1998: 185).
When bēru is used to indicate distance, instead of 2 hours of arc, it measures 2 hours
of walking distance. This was explained in Section 3.3: Etana and the Eagle, and per
se, one bēru is approximately equal to one league (which Horowitz here in fact uses),
or 5 kilometres. The proposed distances between different constellations, therefore, is
quite vast (though, in truth, nowhere nearly vast enough).
In view of scientific approaches, the Babylonian mindset has clearly evolved
somewhat. Not only is a water clock used which will give more accurate
measurements for smaller amounts of time, but the introduction of the new variation
of UŠ is clearly an attempt to fix the flawed Babylonian year. In view of the inclusion
of linear distance into space, an opinion on the scientific approach has to remain
neutral. Whether these values were somehow calculated or were arbitrarily decided
upon is unknown.
Amazingly for a scientific, astronomical text, the most important consequences are, in
fact, cosmological. The reason for this is as follows.
Since the ratio of distance:degrees remains constant, the Path of Enlil along which the
ziqpu stars travel has to be a perfect circle. Whether the Babylonians were aware of
this fact is uncertain, but relatively likely. By adding all the differences in Bēru ina
šamê together, by arriving back at the start, one has in fact travelled the entire
circumference of the Path of Enlil.
Modern mathematics states that the circumference of a circle is equal to the radius
multiplied by 2 π. The Babylonians did not know this ratio, but they nevertheless did
have a formula of their own for its calculation, the radius multiplied by 6 (which is
close enough, 2 π equals roughly 6.28). This means, since the circumference is
known, the radius of the circle can be calculated;



99
radius = 655 200 divided by 6
= 109 200 bēru.
The radius of the circle has an important implication: it is the distance of the observer
to the distance of the ziqpu star itself. As such, the distance from the Earth‟s surface to
the Lower Heavens of the stars was 109 200 bēru, or 546 000 kilometres. This is,
quite frankly, a huge jump from the 3 bēru the eagle flew to the even higher Heaven
of Anu in the Etana Epic mentioned in Section 3.3: Etana and the Eagle.
7. THE SCRIBES OF ENUMA ANU ENLIL
In order to determine whether the scribes of the older Babylonian astronomical corpus
possessed, or at least were starting to show signs of, a scientific frame of mind, it is
the evidence itself which has been of most influence: in other words, the appearances
of hints towards this state of mind within the texts themselves. However, just like
these views were likely altered by the scribes‟ cosmological beliefs with regards to
the stars themselves, the chances are also good that they could have been influenced
by other factors within the lives of the scribes. Before it can be determined exactly to
what degree the scribes were adopting scientific frames of thought, it is perhaps
prudent to briefly discuss exactly who and what these scribes were, in case these
deductions nullify the conclusions already drawn.
Firstly, scribes held an extremely formal position. The term did not indicate a person
simply capable of reading and writing at the same status as the rest of the general
citizenry - all scribes were employed by the king; they formed part of the social elite
and were mostly the sons (though women are attested for) of men of prominence
(Pearce 1995: 2265). During the times of the composition of the earlier Babylonian
astronomical corpus, scribal activity was conducted, for the most part, in the palace
itself (Pearce 1995: 2273). In order to be a scribe, or tupšarru, it meant that one would
have to have knowledge of the greater body of texts of the scribal repertoire, known
as the tupšarrūtu (Rochberg-Halton 2004: 210), and forced scribes specialising in
certain fields to have knowledge of certain core texts. Of the texts discussed, Enuma
Anu Enlil was one such “text book,” and it is possible that MUL.APIN may have been
another.



100
For the most part, scribes tended to form a separate level of society that was, for the
most part, quite exclusive (Rochberg-Halton 2004:213). This stretched as far as the
texts themselves – many were meant to only be read by other scribes. One such text,
to name an example investigated, is KAR 307. It states in its opening line that the
tablet is the “secret of the Great Gods,” and further “let the knowing reveal it only to
the knowing, do not let the unknowing view it, it is a taboo of the Great Gods”
(Horowitz 1998: 5). Similar lines can be found amongst many other texts, particularly
those dealing with topics live divination, magic, medicine or, more importantly,
astronomy (Rochberg-Halton 1995: 217). The implication of this is that the
astronomical knowledge presented in the previous texts was likely known only by the
scribal class of society, and as such, astronomy was by no means a facet of the lives
of the common populace.
Many scribes held very important positions in society, the highest being the advisor to
the king (Rochberg-Halton 1995: 223). Such advisors, it is recorded, were expected to
be able to advise the king in matters of rituals, divination and astronomical works
(Nemet-Nejat 2002: 203). As such, considering that scribal knowledge was kept
within one‟s own field of the “knowing,” astronomy and astrology fell under the field
of study of the same school of scribes (Nemet-Nejat 2002: 203). As suspected from
the intermingled nature of astrological and astronomical data within the majority of
texts, they were considered aspects of the same thing (Rochberg-Halton 195: 223).
The names given to the scribes of this particular school were tupšar Enūma Anu Enlil,
the Scribes of Enūma Anu Enlil (In CAD [T] (19:151) - tupšar Enūma Anu Enlil, the
term is described as “astronomer”)
The name of this body of scribes obviously implies that their primary function was to
have knowledge of omens. Astronomy, as such, is not as important to Babylonian
society as astrology. To clear any doubts, in the colophons of the purely astronomical
texts of the later period, the scribes often refer to themselves and their position as a
tupšar Enūma Anu Enlil. The term remains associated with the astrologer/astronomer
scribes right up until the very last known texts of Babylonian astronomy.
The scribes who wrote the texts under investigation thus had a wide field of
knowledge. Firstly, they were expected to know the details of the heavens; the periods



101
and movements of the astronomical bodies. They were expected to know how to
interpret what could be seen in the heavens in terms of what the supposed
implications of such signs could be. Lastly, they were expected to know what to do to
counter each specific sign if it has bad connotations. A good example of this was to
install a substitute king on the throne if a sign was received that the king was going to
die (Rochberg-Halton 1995: 78). This substitute king (usually a criminal) would then
be executed after a while in order to ensure the prophecy came true and the real king
would be safe. Amazingly, if the real king died before the execution/sacrifice, the
substitute (criminal or no) would remain king.
As a class in its entirety, the scribes of the astronomical texts cannot be declared
scientists in the modern sense of the word. Their principal functions revolved more
around divination, and their astronomical knowledge was used simply to supplement
it. However, none of this information argues against the idea that individual scribes
did not possess scientific frames of mind, nor does it imply that the approach to the
information could not gradually become more scientific. While the corpus itself was
by no means scientific, it did not specifically impede the awakening of scientific
thought processes. As such, the conclusions drawn from the texts themselves remain
in place.
8. CONCLUSION
Science, as has been defined (Section 1), is the study of the structure and behaviour of
the world. It is the study, as such, of the nature of everything that can be observed. By
implication, it is the study aiming to learn how physical reality works. To have a
scientific frame of mind, therefore, implies a desire to know the structure and
behaviour of the world and want to know how everything works
The preceding investigation has been an attempt to identify this scientific frame of
mind amongst the early Babylonians, by focusing on their views of the stars before
the date of 700 BCE through the texts originating from this period dealing with the
subject in question.



102
The people of whom the mind-frames were investigated were naturally the scribes of
the texts themselves. Later investigation of the nature of their occupation in fact made
it clear that in terms of views on the stars, the scribes were in fact the only choice, for
access to texts dealing with this aspect of physical reality was mostly restricted to
members of their profession (Section 8).
The requirements of their profession meant that they were often involved in actions
which were not only unscientific but in fact went against the principles of science,
drawing conclusions about reality (in this case the future, through divination) without
having been able to study and observe it. As such, classifying them as true scientists is
impossible. This does not, however, mean that individuals were disqualified from
possessing scientific frames of mind.
Since conceptions of reality are often influenced by local ideology (be it forced or
simply through constant or early exposure), the popular and official traditions which
the individual would have been exposed to before his entry into the scribal school
have been included in the investigated (Section 3). These would form the basis of
what the scribe believed the nature of the subject into which he would be delving was;
in this case, what the stars were believed to be. The view of the stars presented by
such texts as Enuma Elish (Section 3.1.1) and the tradition of the Three Heavens
(Section 3.2) indicate a generally accepted cosmology in which the assignment of
aspects of the nature of the stars – their origin (Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.2),
position in the sky (Section 3.2) and height above the world (Section 3.3) – appear to
be completely arbitrary. Only in the case of the sky, its colour being similar to a blue
stone (and thereby the association of the sky with the stone – Section 3.2), can the
reasoning behind one of these aspects of belief be seen. Association, however, is far
from evidence. As such, the general Babylonian populace was exposed to a system of
understanding the universe where study and the acquisition of evidence was not the
norm. The construction of scientific mind-frames would thus not be a factor of
society, and any inclinations towards them would rely solely on the inherent nature of
the individual.
For this purpose, the investigation of whether individuals possessed scientific frames
of mind has centred upon the texts they wrote, of which the following can be said:



103
Scientific mind-frames desire to know how the world around them works. By
implication, if aspects of the functioning of the world are identified, it means that an
individual with a general interest in the phenomena set out to figure out how it works.
Remarkable discoveries listed in the texts of the Astrolabes (Section 4.2), Enuma Anu
Enlil (Section 4.1) and MUL.APIN (Section 5) include that fixed stars travelled along
set courses in the sky, and returned to the same position in the sky at a regular interval
(one year) (Section 4.2) rising exactly 4 minutes earlier each day (Section 5.2.5); also
that planets like Venus had similar periods (Section 4.1), and that the time ratio of the
longest to the shortest day every year remained the same (even if they got that ratio
wrong), and that the Sun shifted its position in its orbit at a constant, progressive rate
(Section 4.2). Such discoveries would usually provide enough of an argument to end
an investigation of such a matter, but unfortunately, the existence of astrology, which
did not tie itself to specific stellar phenomena but to the movement of stars in general,
meant that many of these discoveries may have been made not due to the
aforementioned curiosity of how the world works, but rather for the explicit purpose
of determining what observations would influence the future in what ways
(determining omens, as in Section 5.2.10).
Since scientific minds wish to know exactly how the world works, they tend to
categorize similar subjects of observation into groups in order to better understand
their relations to one another. In terms of the stars, this was done on many levels, the
most basic being that constellations were catalogued into three different paths in the
sky determined by their positions (Section 4.2). In order to better understand these
relations, most observations were entered into systems or catalogues, such as in the
astrolabes (Section 4.2) or the MUL.APIN lists (Section 5), including data related to
such aspects of the stellar observations as which stars rose when others set (Section
5.1.4), which stars would pass directly overhead at dawn (Section 5.1.6), and which
stars were touched by the Moon in its travels throughout the sky (Section 5.1.7), to
name but a few. Unfortunately, while the scientific mind is the type to categorize and
list purely out of interest, astrologers would still do the same in order to determine
which phenomena had what possible result – just because the lists of data in
MUL.APIN do not contain apodoses, does not necessarily mean that they were not
created for divinatory purposes.

Generally, a person with a more scientifically-inclined mindset will crave greater
accuracy to better fulfil his understanding of the nature of the world. In this regard,
the texts of MUL.APIN unfortunately still disappoint – many of the values are
approximations (Section 5.1.2), mostly with respect to dates, and as such what is
presented is far from reality. The section on the compass (Section 5.2.5) provides
information which is simply wrong, so there is little chance of a thorough, inquisitive
mind behind this source.
Some other texts, on the other hand, are extremely accurate (or at least precise), such
as the Shadow Clock (Section 5.2.7). The Shadow Clock by itself presents quite a few
indications of scientific methodology at work. While the data is accurate, the nature of
the data (the length of shadows at specific times of day) means that it is ironically also
almost completely useless with regards to any possible practical application, even
with respect to divination. While it could be applied to determining of dates by
calculation of the day:night ratio for the day in question, much simpler methods to
determine the same thing existed; and as such the existence shadow clock may owe its
existence solely due to the desire of a single scribe to interlink the various aspects of
physical reality. As such, it implies an origin in individual interest, a strong indicator
of a scientific mind-frame.
This is further evidenced by that fact that the longest:shortest day ratio changes to a
more correct value than the ones used in many of the other MUL.APIN sources, since
the scientific mind is never content to accept a system unconditionally; if any aspect is
seen not to fit in the system as originally assumed, the system will be re-evaluated and
data possibly dropped from the system. In the same manner, redundant ziqpu stars are
removed from their list in Section 5.1.6.
The opposite is also true – the scientific mind will embrace new data or even adopt
completely different systems in order to acquire more knowledge. AO 6478 (Section
6) is one such text in which an entirely new system (and using revised equipment) is
used. Scientific minds crave progress. By the implications drawn from this text, a
completely new value for an old cosmological idea (the height of heaven) is even
given.



105
Sadly, just as the texts show examples of progress, some also show signs of
stagnation. Social implications (such as being branded a heretic) aside, the inclusion
of Jupiter into the Path of Enlil rather than Anu, just to conform to the original system
mentioned in the Enuma Elish, is completely contrary to scientific values and beliefs,
almost as bad as intentional falsification of data as shown in Section 5.16.
Finally, the scientific mind will strive to gain as complete a picture as possible from
that which it observes. In terms of the astrolabes (Section 4.2), which have practical
applications as a form of calendar, single heliacally rising stars could have been
presented each month and the text would still serve the same purpose. However, stars
are included for each of the three different paths in the sky, and a water clock table is
included as yet another alternative.
With respect to whether or not the Babylonians possessed a scientific frame of
mind with reference to the early observations of the heavenly bodies, it can
therefore be deduced that one portion of the civilization, the scribes, did in fact
shows signs of a scientific frame of mind, yet it varied from one scribe to another
and was not by any means the most commonly attested.
