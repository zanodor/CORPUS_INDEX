The Gundestrup Cauldron Mythology and Cosmology
The Native Way of understanding Cosmos
Gundestrup Cauldron Peat bog, Gundestrup (Denmark) First century
B.C.E. Silver partially gilded. Diameter 69cm., Height
42cm.Copenhagen, Nationalmuseet.
The Gundestrup Cauldron is a religious vessel found in Himmerland,
Denmark, 1891. It was deposited in a dry section of a peat bog,
dismantled with its five long rectangular plates, seven short ones
and one round plate. Each plate is made of 97.0% pure silver and
filled with various motifs of animals, plants and pagan deities.



Sophius Müller(1892) reconstructed these plates into the present
form of the cauldron: five rectangular plates are placed in the inside
of the cauldron leaving 2cm of space between each, and the seven
(originally eight) plates form the outside of the cauldron. The round
plate is assumed as the base of the cauldron. The reconstructed
cauldron with its spherical base and cylindrical side is 69cm. in
diameter and 42cm. high; both the inner and outer plates are almost
of the same height ( about 21cm) forming the cylindrical side of the
cauldron.
As the largest surviving piece of Europian Iron Age silver work, the
Gundestrup Cauldron has been given a special interest by many
scholars. Especially, its high quality workmanship and iconographic
variety have generated an incessant inquiry into the origin of the
cauldron. Though the date of the cauldron is generally attributed to
the 2nd or 1st century BCE (La Tène III), there still remains much room
for controversy concerning the place of its manufacture. The main
problem comes from the fact that its style and workmanship is
Thracian rather than Celtic despite its decorative motifs manifestly
Celtic. So far, scholastic opinions have been largely divided into two
groups: those who argue for the Gaulish origin and those who argue
for the Thracian origin. The former locate the manufacture of the
cauldron in the Celtic west while the latter opt for the Lower Danube
in southeastern Europe.
The Vessel
The whole vessel represents the Whole World as known from the
ancient 3 World division and dimension of Earth, the nearest
Celestial World and the farthest celestial world of the Milky Way.
- Maybe the Vessel also once have had a lid in order to show some



details regarding "the top" of these 3 Worlds? In that case the
imagery would have shown some mythological "world axis" imagery.
Interpretation
In Norse Mythology these 3 worlds is mentioned: Midgaard for the
humans; Asgaard for the nearest celestial world where the Sun, the
Moon, the (5) Planets and for the Star Constellations and Udgaard
(Out-Yard) for the farthest world representing the Milky Way galaxy
where the Giants (Jaetter) live.
The interactive Mytho-Cosmological plays between these 3 worlds
must be incorporated in the telling of vessel imagery. That is: We are
dealing with the cosmological creative and interactive forces in these
3 worlds and we are also dealing with the Mytho-Cosmological
geographical and celestial locations of these 3 worlds.
- Some knowledge would be of an obvious physical character as for
instants day and night observations and the Seasons, and even the
immediate knowledge of the "Udgaard", the Giant Milky Way
contours. But the fully knowledge beyond the Milky Way, could only
have been collected by spiritual means i.e. by Shaman travelling
gathering intuitive, non verbal knowledge. It is the intuitive travelling
knowledge "beyond" the Milky Way, that is incorporated in the
Worlds Creation Myths.
The Plates
1. The Base: A Bull in the center. A Woman with a Sword, Bull and
2 Dogs
2. 5 inner plates.
3. 7 outer.



4. The plates on the outside show 4 male and 3 female busts.
5. (Maybe there once also was a Lid?)
The Base
In the Norse Mythology Creation Story, http://www.native
science.net/Creation.Myth.Norse.htm the Giant Audhumbla
Cow/Bull, located in the southwards warmer and lighter Muspelheim,
"licked forward" the Milky Way Giant of Ymir, the northern
hemisphere Milky Way figure.
The logical choice of a Bull/Cow comes from combining the Bull's
roar with the thundering sound of creation in the Milky Way galaxy
center. And of course when also choosing a Cow and the Utter milky
symbols, this gives the natural associations to nourishing and to the
white river of the Milky Way and thereby building op the the telling of



how all life once began in the center of our galaxy.
On this base plate, the Bull/Cow is centered southwards as in the
Milky Way center in the Star Constellation of Sagittarius, and Ymir is
hovering above as the northern Milky Way contours on the Northern
Earth night hemisphere. (A physical observable symbol)

Inner Plate A
This plate shows a variety of animals around the horned figure in the
center. The horned figure is presented with his legs folded and wears
a torque around his neck. he holds another torque in his right hand
and a horned serpent in his left hand. This torque-wearing god with
stag antlers is generally identified as the Celtic god, Cernunnos.
Cernunnnos is the Lord of the animals and the torques he wears are
the symbols of wealth and prosperity. Cernunnos was first
recognized by the inscription of the Paris monument which, along
with the inscription, shows a horned deity wearing torques on his
antlers. Because of this antlered deity, this plate has often been cited
by those who argue for the Gaulish origin. However, this general



identification of the central figure with Cernunnos has been
challenged by some scholars. As early as 1971, Powell noted that
there is no ground for believing that every Celtic horned god should
be called "Cernunnos depending solely upon the defective
inscription in Paris. In agreement with Powell, Olmsted(1979)
suggests that the figure be classified as "Dieu Accroupi." According
to him, all of the "accroupi" figures with antlers, torques and serpent
come from north central Gaul, while only a quarter of the "accroupi"
figures with one or two attributes come from outside the region.
Apart from the identity of the horned deity, it is recognized, however,
that the posture and dress of the figure are not necessarily Celtic.
His folded legs seen from above hint at the possible link with
Buddhism in the East and his costume - tight-fitting breeches and
coat fastened by a belt at the waist - is often matched by the
costumes of horse-riding races from southeastern Europe. More
recently, Anders Bergquist found that the shoes of the deity with zig
zag bindings are exactly the same type as those found in Thracian
silver repoussé from Sãlistea and Durentsi. His discovery seems to
confirm the eastern influence on the Gundestrup Cauldron for no
such examples have been found in the Celtic West.
Although, as in the identification of the central figure, scholars have
difficulties in identifying some animals surrounding the central figure,
it is generally accepted that beside him on the left and right are a
hound and a stag. On the back of the stag is depicted a bull which
repeats itself on the upper left corner of the plate. The bull on the
left is followed by two other animals: a dolphin with a rider and a lion.
However, the identities of these animals have been occasionally
refuted. For example, Powell argues that the dolphin is actually a
sturgeon. Also, the lion right behind the dophin is identified as a boar
by some scholars. Finally, a confronted pair of animals in the lower
left part of the plate are generally considered as lions. These diverse



animals are given special interest by those who argue for the
Thracian manufacture of the cauldron. Powell claims that the stag
and bulls have the "stolid look" that seems to have come from
eastern Europe and that the confronted pair of lions are typically
oriental.
Concerning the iconography of the plate, many scholars assume that
the plate has a coherent narrative. Klindt Jensen notes that the eyes
of the three figures- Cernunnos, the stag, and the hound- are level,
thus suggesting a striking connection between them. Most notably,
Olmsted identifies the central figure as a Gaulish prototype of later
Irish Cú Chulainn in Táin and reads the whole plate as a combination
of episodes from the same tale. According to him, the sequence of
the three figures on the upper left corner describes the various
transformations (shape-shifting) of the two Irish bulls: Donn Cuailnge
and Finnbennach. He calls attention to the fact that the sequence of
animal transformations ending in the two bulls occurs in the same
order in both the tale and the plate.
(Paris Cernunnos)
Interpretation:
When one observe a man riding on a Dolphin, one cannot possibly
think of a scene of Earth. This stage is not set and played out in the
human Norse Midgaard area. The dear-horned younger man hold the
Torque symbol of Life in his right hand, and also around his neck,



and the Serpent symbol of creation in his left.
Inner Plate B
This plate shows an antithetical arrangement of animals around a
bust of a goddess. The goddess is presented in the center with a
six-spoked rosette wheel on either side of her. She is flanked by two
elephants confronting each other. Below them are two griffins
arranged in the same antithetical manner and a hound is placed in
the lower center of the plate, between these two griffins. The
goddess seems almost identical with the goddess on plate (g): she
has S-curve hair strands and curvilinear eye-ridges forming a T
shape with her nose. The rendering of her arms is also similar to that
on plate (e). Though it is not certain that the six-pointed wheels
represent a wagon, the goddess is usually interpreted as riding a
wagon. Actually, a chariot is often represented by a single wheel of
the same type in Gaulish coinage. Olmsted suggests that the
presence of the elephants on either side of the wagon could have
resulted from the influences of the Roman coinage which portrays
elephants pulling a chariot. Olmsted also identifies her with the
Celtic Goddess Medb. She is a god of war and rulership; diverse



animals and the chariot represent her war-like nature as a territory
goddess.
Though elephants are also depicted in the Celtic west, the fantastic
characters of the animals are often explained in the oriental context.
Especially the griffins with their segmented wings and rounded bird
heads are similar in concept to those imaginary animals often
observed in Thracian metal works (Phalerae). Even the elephants
suggest an oriental influence. Olmsted notes that the elephant is less
a manifestation of the actual animal than a synthetic creature
incorporating diverse parts of other animals: the body of the
elephant shows the rear leg and tail of the bull on the plate (D) and
the trunk of the lion on the plate (C). Its head is also same as that of
the bull except its trunk, clumsily added to the head. Thracian
characters of the animals are more clear in their hanging feet: the
feet of the griffins are literally hanging in midair, not wearing any
weight of the body. The bodies of these animals are decorated with
interspersed large and small dots and lines. This also can be read in
the context of Thracian workmanship for the decorative techniques
of hatching and punch marks are characteristic of Thracian silver
smithing.
(Phalera from Stara Zagora)
Inner Plate C



This plate shows an intriguing iconography of two deities with a
broken wheel: in the center of the plate, a bust of a bearded deity is
depicted with a half-shaped wheel on his right side and a full-length
leaping figure is holding the rim of the wheel from the right. Under
this leaping figure, a horned serpent is presented. The rest of
animals are placed clockwise around this group of two deities: in the
upper part of the plate, two identical beasts are depicted on either
side of the group, both facing the left side of the deities and in the
lower part, three griffins are depicted in parallel, all facing the right
side of the deities. The space between the upper and lower group of
the animals is filled with some botanical patterns which are usually
identified as ivy tendrils.
The bust of a bearded god in the center is almost identical with the
small bust on the right shoulder of the goddess on plate (e). On the
other hand, the leaping figure holding the wheel on the left is similar
to the gods of the plate (A) and (E) in its size and dress. He wears
tight fitting, short-sleeve clothes and a horned helmet ending in
knob like terminals. Drawn on these similarities, Olmsted
reconstructs the narrative of this plate in relation to the other plates;
according to him, the gods on plates (A), (C), (E) are different
representations of the same god, the Gaulish version of Cú Chulainn
in Irish tale Táin Bó Cuailnge. Like Cú Chulainn in the Táin, the young



god wearing the horned helmet uses a broken wheel in confrontation
with the bearded god, Fergus who, on plate (e), accompanies the
goddess sharing traits with Irish Medb. The horned serpent under
the feet of the young god can be read as the Irish goddess Morrigan
who, in another anecdote from the tale, disguised herself in the
shape of an eel and finally had her ribs crushed under the feet of Cú
Chulainn.
Indeed, the unique presence of a broken wheel suggests that this
plate may be a description of a particular narrative. Yet, there is no
guarantee that this half shaped wheel was meant to be a broken
wheel. Ellis Davidson notes that the wheel was a familiar
Scandinavian symbol in the period of the late Bronze Age, a basic
motif in the rock carvings which continued to appear throughout the
Iron Age. On the other hand, some scholars identify the bearded
deity with Jupiter Taranis of the Celts whose traits are wheels.
Besides, Olmsted fails to explain the existence of the fantastic
animals such as lions(?) and griffins. Even if we accept his argument
that the beasts in the upper part of the plate are variants of the wolf,
the griffins are completely inexplicable in the context of the Irish tale,
Táin, for griffins are unknown in early Irish tradition. Actually, these
griffins are all the same with their segmented wings, rounded bird
heads and hanging feet as those on plate (B). As manifest examples
of Thracian style, they are often compared with the fantastic animals
of Sark, Helden, Paris phalerae of Thracian origin and the Agighiol
vase (belonging to 4th BC Thracian style). Especially the Agighiol
vase shows the parallel expressions of the hanging feet depicted on
plate (B) and (C): the deer with their legs dangling in midair as well as
griffins and lions.



(Agighiol Vase)
Inner Plate D
This plate is generally interpreted as a bull-slaying scene. Three bulls
are placed in a horizontal line, facing the same direction. They have
massive, ham-like rumps and short but thick necks which resemble
those of a bull on the Sark phalerae. Focusing on their shape and
hatching patterns of the bodies, Powell traces their origin back to
Anatolian and earlier Urartian tradition. On the lower right side of
each bull, a man is standing in the posture of attacking the bull with
a sword. Under the feet of each bull, by the side of each man, a dog
is depicted as running toward the left while a cat-like creature is
running in the same direction over the back of the bull. These cats as



well as the dogs have the same hanging feet. As shown in other
plates, the spaces between each figure are filled with tear-drop
shaped leaves.
The three fold composition of this plate is often related with the
Celtic triad in which the actions of heroes and the slaying of
monsters are set in groups of three. Here, the figures are not
completely identical; the middle man wears a jacket and the other
two do not. However, the basic concept of the composition seems to
have a strong connection with the Celtic tradition. Since all the bulls
and human figures are represented in a highly stylized, static,
monumental posture, Ellis Davidson concludes that the scene
depicts a ritual killing with "no attempt at realism."
Inner Plate E
Interpretation:
This plate is horizontally divided in the middle by the Tree of Life.



On the left-most side of the plate, the standing god wears what
seems to be a pigtail or a tight-fitting knitted cap with a tassel. He is
much larger than the rest thus dominating the whole scene. He holds
a small man upside down over a bucket-shaped object; he seems to
be either plunging the man in the bucket or pulling him out. Before
the god, under the bucket, a dog is depicted in midair as if leaping
up. The rest of the scene is filled with two rows of warriors vertically
arranged along with the dividing stem of a tree in between: the upper
warriors are horse-riders and the lower warriors are foot-warriors
holding spears and shields. The last three men in the lower row are
blowing musical instruments which are safely identified as the Celtic
instrument, carnyx. Over the carnyx in the far right corner is
depicted a ram-headed serpent similar to that on plate (A).
Along with the plate (A), plate (E) is said to be the most Celtic in its
iconography because of the presence of the carnyx. It consists of a
long thin tube at the top of which is added a boarʼs head with jaws



wide open and a projecting mane on the back. The decorated
helmets of the warriors in the upper row are also Celtic. Here, we
have five different types of helmets: one has a boar on top, one a
pair of crooked thin horns ending in knobs, one a crescent shape
with concave side down, one a bird with its wings folded. These
helmets with various adornment fit with Poseidoniusʼs description.
Besides, Olmsted notes that the weapons of the soldiers such as
shields with circular bosses are those of western and central Europe.
However, there are some details which are not apparently Celtic. For
example, the distinctive costumes of the men, of the same type as
those elsewhere on the bowl, are not characteristic of Celtic Gaul, as
Müller observed long ago. Most notably, the round disc securing the
straps on the horse is exactly the same type as an iron phalera from
southern Europe. Both discs consist of a round central decoration
surrounded by smaller circles at the circumference. Based on this
observation, Bergquist argues that it points to the eastern origin of
the cauldron: he quotes from Allen(1971: 24) that the auxiliary
horsemen of the Romans, many of whom came from Thrace rode on
horses "plentifully decked with phalerae" and that such cavalry are
possible agents of the transmission of the phalerae across Europe.
Also, the similar arrangement of figures and plant pattern is found in
the Thracian helmet from Agighiol on which the horse riders are
depicted in parallel below the horizontal line of ivy pattern.
(Bergquist and Taylor:14)
Concerning the symbolic content of the scene, quite a few
interpretations have been made. The most widely accepted one is
that the scene portrays a ritual dipping and that the bucket-shaped
object is a cauldron of rebirth. This cauldron of rebirth is associated
with Celtic gods, particularly the Dagda in later Irish literature. Since
the scene depicts the warriors and the idea of the dead being reborn
into an after life is common to Celtic mythology, the theme of rebirth



seems quite convincing. In favor of this interpretation, Ellis Davidson
reads the dog and the horned serpent as symbols of the Other
world. On the other hand, Gricourt (1954) suggests that the scene
depicts the dead warriors marching in as spear men below and riding
away alive as horsemen above. However, there seems to be no
guarantee for his interpretation. Olmsted challenges this usual
interpretation by asking why the resurrected warriors rise in rank,
marching up as dead foot soldiers to ride off as horsemen after
resurrection. Furthermore Olmsted argues that the bucket shaped
object is not a cauldron and that the scene depicts a death by
drowning which is often found in Irish tales such as Aided
Muirchertaig maic Erca and Aided Diarmada. Another quite
interesting interpretation is made by Kimmig (1965). He suggests
that the foot soldiers are carrying a tree which is to be placed as a
votive offering into one of the sacred pit shafts which have been
excavated on Celtic territory.
(Agighiol helmet)
The Outer plates show 4 male and 3 female busts.
Outer Plate a



Though many scholars since Müller believe that there are at least
two artists involved in the manufacture of the cauldron, the outer
plates share some basic characteristics. Most of all, as Sandars
points out, all the gods are represented in a static posture and the
scenes show almost symmetrical arrangements of the figures. Other
common features of the gods include the stylized or patternized hair
with the top of the head left bald, no ears, small mouths, T-shaped
line of eye brows and nose, and the insetting of eyes with glass.
The basic iconographic concept of the outer plates - arrangement of
human busts around the cauldron - has been often compared with
that of Rynkeby cauldron and Bavai calendar vase from Belgium
though the letter is assumed to post-date the cauldron; it is assumed
to be of the early Roman period. Recently, Bergquist and Taylor
suggest that the arrangement of the human bust may indicate
southeastern origin because faces are arranged around bowls in
Southeast Europe too. They also notes that human busts are often
observed in the later Thracian style metal works.
On plate (a), a bearded god holds a small man in each hand over his



shoulders. He is in so-called "orans position"with his arms raised.
Like another male god on plate (d), he doesnʼt wear a torque; instead
he has long whisker-like strings. Each of the two men seems to hold
a boar with one of their arms. However, from a closer view, one can
recognize that each one reaches his hand upward to a boar and just
touches it. The one on the right has a dog below him while below
that on the left is a horse with wings, a so called "Pegasus." As
shown in the inner plates, the identifications of the scenes on outer
plates have not been very successful either. Olmsted, who reads the
whole scene on the cauldron as a manifestation of the Irish tale, Táin,
identifies the central god with Gaulish equivalent of Cú Rói who
judges between the heroes in the Irish myth. Here, according to his
interpretation, the Gualish Cú Rói judges the champions competing
for the boar.
(Rynkeby Cauldron) (Bavai Vase)
Outer Plate b



Plate (b) shows a male deity holding two sea horses or dragons.
These two animals have the mixed characters of horse and dragon;
they have a long, serpentine body of a dragon and a horse-like head
and two front legs. Their ribs are prominently fluted and the tails and
wings are swirled. Below the god is a double-headed monster
attacking small figures of fallen men. This double headed creature
has been given a special interest by many scholars. Jacobsthal
associates it with the Early La Tène beast from Cuperly and a two
headed beast on a coin from the Jersey hoard. This monstrous
figure, which continued to appear until late in the Middle Ages, is
also said to be an animated fire-dog, representing the metal frame
set frontally across the fire on an open hearth, with bull or ram heads
at either end.(Davidson: 498) A number of such fire-dogs have been
recovered from rich Celtic graves in England and on the Continent.
Based on this interpretation, Ellis Davidson assumes that the men
reclining beside it are feasting beside the hearth and that this
iconography may indicate a possible link between this deity and the
Other World in the feast of which the dead join their ancestors. On
the other hand, as early as 1913, Hubert suggested that this scene
should be related to the sea or water since the god holds the sea



horses. As for the central god, he drew parallel to the Welsh and Irish
god of the sea and the other world: Manawydan and Manannan. As
an extension of Hubert's interpretation, Olmsted relates the god to
the Irish character Froech who fights with water monster in Táin Bó
Fraích.
Outer Plate c
This plates shows a deity with his upraised hands in "orans position"
as the other male gods on the outer plates. However, unlike the
others, his hands are empty. He has a boxing man at his right and on
the left is a leaping figure with a small horse rider below it. The
leaping figure is similar to the one on the base with his upturned
queue of hair, which is also found in plate (g). The two men are
dressed in the same type of garment as that shown on the inner
plates, a close fitting jacket or vest with tight trousers ending at the
knee. Since this kind of dress is commonly observed in horse-riding
races, there are no iconographic details characteristically Celtic or
Thracian on this plate. Hence, the depicted scene has found no
parallel either in Celtic mythologies or Thracian image repertory.



Outer Plate d
The iconographic details of this plate are comparatively clear: a
bearded god is holding two stags in each hand. Stylistically, this
plate share some characteristics with the plates (e) and (g): all of
them have a dotted background which ends in a zig-zag boundary at
the top of the plate and ivy tendrils which fill the empty spaces
between the figures. Since boars and stags were the major animals
revered by the Celts, one may argue for the Gaulish character of this
plate. But they were sacred animals also among the many other
peoples of central and southern Europe. Olmsted identifies the
animals as deer and the god as Gaulish equivalent of Irish Segamain,
who is prominently associated with deer. However, he admits that
deer hunting is a common feature in the saga literature.
Outer Plate e



Plate (e) shows a bust of a goddess in the center and the smaller
busts of two male gods on her shoulders. She wears a torque and
has a typical mask-like face with her small mouth and T-shaped eye
brows and nose. The bearded deity on her right shoulder is almost
identical with the central god on the inner plate (C) even in their
round shaped pattern beneath their beard. They may represent the
same god in a different context or just two different gods. If the
former is the case, this means that the decoration program of the
cauldron is based on a certain kind of narrative or a group of
narratives and that each plate is interconnected with one another
iconographically. In favor of this view, Olmsted identifies the central
goddess with Irish Medb and the two gods with her husband Ail and
her lover Fergus. The tale says that because of her many sexual
partners, she "never had one man without another waiting in his
shadow." Based on this passage, Olmsted suggests that this scene
may represent sexual relationships of Medb. The background of the
figures is dotted and filled with ivy-tendrils as shown on the (d), (g).
Outer Plate f



Plate (f) shows an interesting iconography. The central goddess
holds a small bird in her upraised right hand while her left arm is
placed across her chest. Crossed over her left arm is lying a small
man and on the opposite side to the man is a dog upside down.
Some have suggested that the goddess is cradling the two figures
on her chest. But this would hardly be the case because the figures
are depicted as fallen rather than cradled.(Davison: 498) The
goddess has two birds of prey - which may be eagles or ravens - on
either side of her head. On her right shoulder is seated a small
female figure, over whose head is a lion-like animal runs. On the left
side, another small figure is holding the hair of the goddess as if
plaiting her hair. Olmsted notes that the small bird in her right hand is
same as that on the helmet on plate (E): both are seen from the side
with a head like those of the larger birds but with a straight beak and
their almond shaped wings are folded. Though the narrative of this
scene is not known, Bergquist and Taylor associate its iconography
with silver phalera of Galiche; both show a female bust with a bird
above each shoulder. Since the two plates are of distinctively
different style, their claim does not seem plausible. However, they



argue that both are, nonetheless, in the same technical tradition
high repoussé silver smithing- and in the same structure of
iconography.
(Galiche phalera)
Outer Plate g
The goddess is crossing her arms on the chest. On her right
shoulder is a man struggling with a lion and on the left is a leaping
figure who is almost identical with the one on plate (c) and base
plate. The man on the right is often associated with a motif borrowed
from the theme of Heracles and the Nemean Lion. However, it is a



widespread motif of ancient times which can be traced back beyond
classical art to Near Eastern and oriental prototypes. Bergquist and
Taylor compare this plate with that of a silver jug from Orlovo in
south Russia. In the latter, a female face is flanked by figures of men:
the man on her right is wrestling with an animal and the other on the
left is standing alone. They also have flower blooms around their
bodies as shown on this plate. On the other hand, Olmsted
associates the head of the goddess with that on the Marborough Vat
found in Britain; he notes that the technique of rendering the eye,
nose, eye ridges, and hair is similar.
