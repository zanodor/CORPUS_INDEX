Fourth Rosetta stone: Shogaura Copper plate. Syllabic Brāhmī details Indus Script crypt hieroglyphic writing
Sohgaura coper plate inscription. ca. 7th cent.BCE Pre-Mauryan. Brāhmī inscription refers to a pair of kṓṣṭhāgāra (dvāra koṭṭhaka); the two storehouses described as tri-garbha (i.e. having three rooms).
The decipherment of Line 1 which is in Indus Script clearly demonstrates the purpose served by two store-rooms for itinerant blacksmiths and artisans who work with crucibles and smelters. This purpose is explained further in the Brāhmī script inscription portion of the Sohgaura copper plate, specifying the locations of the facilities.

Now, the Brāhmī inscription is consistent with the rebus readings of Indus Script hieroglyphs and refers to the junction of three highways named Manavati, in two villages called Dasilimita and Usagama. The storehouses were made at this junction for the goods of people using the highways, which are indicated in line 3 by mentioning the three places to and from which they led. One of the names give is recognized by Fleet as Chanchu. (Fleet, JRAS, 63, 1894 proceedings, 86, plate, IA 25. 262; cf. Sohgaura copper plate/B.M. Barua. The Indian Historical Quarterly, ed.

Indian historical tradition attests to the use of copper plates of historical periods to conveyance property rights. This tradition is traced to Indus Script hypertext tradition which continued on punch-marked and cast coins from mints (with continued use of hieroglyphs such as svastika, elephant, tree, yupa etc.as sacred symbols on coins), on some inscriptions (like Dhruva II) which use the hypertext of endless-knot motif and Sohgaura copper plate. Sohgaura copper plate is the Rosetta stone for the Indus Script, firmly anchoring the hypertext cipher to create data archives of wealth-producing metalwork. Sohgaura copper plate inscription is in two scripts: 1. Indus Script and 2. Brahmī. Indus Script inscription is a sāsana --, a succinct declaration of the form and purport of two कोष्ठागार to support itinerant metalworkers. Brahmī inscription is a syllabic-based anvaya, an elucidation of the sāsana firmly defining the grains stored, the objective and logistics (of tri-junction of three roads). The intent is clear: to protect the metalwork wealth rpoducers and merchants. "The original name of the village is Swāhāgārā where the Vedic Brahmins conducted Yajnas..." http://wikimapia.org/7432371/Sohgaura

Sohgaura or Soghaura is a village on the right bank of River Rapti, about fourteen miles south-east from Gorakhpur. The plate measures 2 1⁄2 X 1 7/8 inches. The copper plate was cast in a mould. The writing is NOT incised, but in bold, high relief. (JRAS 1907, p. 527). “In the first place, this archaeological find affords the oldest known and clear example of the use of a copper-plate as a material for writing, especially for inscribing a record in Brāhmi characters...Secondly, the record has its uniqueness and importance for the standard of Brahmi characters which it presents, the standard which, in the opinion of Dr. Fleet, ‘refers it to at any rate an early date in the Maurya period, BC 320 to about 180’...

Indus Script epigraphs are also sāsana -- n. ʻorder, messageʼ to document trade. Indus Script Corpora contain over 200 tāmra-sāsana.
Decipherment of over 200 copper plate inscriptions of Indus Script of the Bronze Age (from ca. 4th millennium BCE) are related to wealth-accounting ledgers of metalwork.
It is notable that some inscriptions following the Indus Age, starting with Sohgaura copper plate pre-Mauryan inscription, are inscribed on copper tablets. So far, no other civilization has recorded such use of copper plates as recording devices for economic transactions.
A copper plate found at Sohgaura is said to belong to pre-Mauryan period (that is, 1st millennium BCE) and mentions famine relief efforts. This anticipates hundreds of copper plate inscriptions of later centuries documenting, typically, land grants or शासन n. an
order , command , edict , enactment , decree , direction (शासनं- √कृ [काङ्क्ष ् Baudh. ]

Sohgaura copper plate is an edict or order concerning two storehouses. The word used is: koṭhagalani = koṭṭhāgārāni, bhalakan(i) = bhārakāni, ‘heavy loads’ (on high roads leading to Śravasti).

Anvaya: logical connection of words in Brahmi epigraph: Indus Script hypertexts describe the facilities associated with two storehouses (with 3 rooms each), smelter, (furnaces) for implements, smithy/forge/crucible; mint, coinage; silver & fine gold engraving. The purpose of the edict is to protect -- during days of famine and distress -the artisans and wealth-producing itinerant workers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, silversmiths of metalwork guilds.
Line 1 in Indus Script hypertexts is further elucidated in the subsequent four lines of syllabic Brāhmi epigraph, giving the locus of the tri-junction of three main roads (See readings provided by JF Fleet, BM Barua and SN Chakravarti).
1. Two storehouses: ete duve koṭhagalani tighavani = ete duve koṭṭhāgārāni trigarbhāṇi = these two storehouses with three rooms each.

The inscription has the top line showing Indus Script hypertexts and bottom lines written in Brahmi script.
Brahmi text has been deciphered as related to the facilities of two koṣṭhāgāra made available at the junction of three roads for merchants during the period of draught. The top line in Sarasvati hieroglyphs connotes these two koṣṭhāgāra (storehouses) and also indicate the facilities of furnaces made available to itinerant smiths-merchants.
"The earliest known copper-plate, known as the Sohgaura copper-plate, is a Maurya record that mentions famine relief efforts. The Sohgaura copper-plate refers to a pair of Kosthagara (granaries) to be used in the time of distress."
“JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, pp. 1 ff. The plate, which was not fashioned by hammering as in the case of most copper plates, was cast in a mould of sand. The letters and emblems were previously scratched into the mould with a pointed instrument. They therefore appear on the plate in relieve.” (DC Sircar, 1965, Indian Epigraphy,Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, Fn 2, p.79)
Copper plate presented in May 1894, by Dr. William Hoey, ICS and Dr. Vincet Smith to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Park Street, Kolkata. “Although scarcely more than 2 1⁄2 inches wide and 1 1⁄2 inches in height, the plate was in astonishingly good condition and covered in symbols and lettering that had been cast in such high relief that they were easy to make out. The writing consisted in four lines of the script that Hoey recognized as the Brahmi of the Asokan columns. But above the lettering was one line made up of seven distinct symbols representing what appeared to be two trees in railings, two buildings, a spear, a central image of three domes topped by a sun and moon and beside it a globe topped by what appeared to be a pair of horns, a familiar symbol known as taurine. It was (Vincent) Smith’s view that no plate of such antiquity had even been found in India – and in this surmise he was subsequently proved correct. He declared the characters of the writing to be ‘ancient Nagari of the Maurya period’ but confessed himself unable to make sense of the text because its language appeared to be Pali rather than Sanskrit. Dr. Rudolf Hoernle, principal of the



8
Calcutta Madrassa College and a leading light of both the ASB and the Indian Museum, was then brought in and fared little better. The meanings of the seven symbols were equally mystifying, although the central image of three linked domes topped by a sun and moon struck Smith as undoubtedly ‘Buddhistic’ and probably represented a memorial stupa. The two structures of wooden posts and thatch roofs obviously represented three-storied buildings of some sort but perhaps the most intriguing element were the two trees, each set behind railings but distinctively different from one another. Smith thought the tree on the left was meant to represent a sal tree but offered no opinion as to what the other might be. Dr. Hoey presented the plate to the ASB – a misplaced act of generosity, as it turned out, for so chaotic was the Society’s curating in the years that followed that it was some decades before it could be officially admitted that the Sohgaura plate was missing believed stolen. The loss is incalculable, for the plate may well be the earliest copper plate ever found in India, very likely made at the time of Asoka himself – whose personal seal may well be represented by the central stupa image – if not earlier. Fortunately, a photograph of the plate was taken and a copy sent to Prof. Buhler, who published the first tentative translation in his own journal, the Vienna Oriental Journal: ‘The order of the great official of Sravasti (issued) from (their camp at) Manavasitikata: These two storehouses with three partitions (which are situated) even in famous Vamsagrama, require the storage of loads of Black Panicum, parched grain, cumin-seed and Amba for (times of) urgent (need). One should not take (any thing from the grain stored).’ In fact, Buhler was uncharasterically wide of the mark here, except in so far as he identified the plate as being some form of order about the storage of food supplies. He was equally uncertain about the significance of the line of images above the inscription, five of which he took to be mangala or auspicious symbols. He thought the railings round the two trees identified them as chaitya or sacred trees, ‘such as are often mentioned in the Buddhist canon, the Brahminical books and elsewhere – the second of them without leaves being probably one of the so-called ‘shameless’ trees which shed their leaves in winter’. The spearlike object, which Vincent Smith had thought resembled a long-handled spoon, he identified as ‘toilet mirror, as the mirror is one of the auspicious symbols and is depicted as such, together with other symbols, and is depicted as such, together with other symbols, above the entrance of the Jaina cave at Junagadh, called Bawa Pyari’s Math’. As for the supposed Buddhist symbol of combined stupas at the centre, this Buhler thought ‘may be meant for a rude representation of Mount Meru’ – the mountain at the centre of the cosmos in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist cosmography. Lastly, there was that curious symbol of the orb linked to the pair of horns, which Vincent Smith had described as the sun and moon. This, according to Buhler, was ‘a nandipada, the footmark of Shiva’s bull Nandin’.
Bharatiya Indus Scriopt tradition continues on copper plate inscriptions.
Some glyphs on line 1: kut.hi = tree; rebus: kut.hi = smelting furnace; kos.t.ha_ga_ra = storehouse; s'u_la = spear; cu_l.a = kiln; kan.d.kanka = rim of jar; rebus: copper furnace; bat.a = quail; rebus: kiln.
The Sohgaura copper plate refers to a pair of kos.t.ha_ga_ra (dva_ra kot.t.haka); the two storehouses described as tri-garbha (i.e. having three rooms) are illustrated on line 1. (Fleet, JRAS, 1907). The illustrations indicate that the three rooms are in three storeys, with supporting pillars clearly seen. The inscription refers to the junction of three highways named Manavati, in two villages called Dasilimita and Usagama. The storehouses were made at this junction for the goods of people using the highways, which are indicated in line 3 by mentioning the three places to and from which they led. One of the names give is reognized by Fleet as Chanchu. (Fleet, JRAS, 63, 1894 proceedings, 86, plate, IA 25. 262; cf. Sohgaura

Some devices used on punch-marked coins also occur as the first line of the Sohgaura copper plate inscription. ( Fleet, J.F., The inscription on the Sohgaura Plate, JRAS, 1907, pp. 509532; B.M. Barua, Sohgaura copper plate, Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol. X, 41).
Non-religious nature of sign graphs on Sohgaura copper plate
“Lastly, with regard to its subject-matter, the inscription is found to be a public notification about the judicious use of certain things in two storehouses by persons carrying on traffic along the high roads leading to S’ra_vasti, or it may be, by persons carrying on traffic by all the three kinds of vehicles along the high roads, in times of urgent need...What we owe to Dr. Fleet’s study of the nature of the devices (used on the top line of the copper plate) is the recognition in all of them a significance other than that of religious symbols. To quote him in his words: ‘Two of them obviously represent the storehouses themselves, which are shown as shed with double roofs. The lower roof in each case is supported by four rows of posts; and these perhaps stand for four rows of posts, the front posts hiding, those behind them. In the

other devices I recognize, not religious emblems, Buddhist or otherwise, -- (I mean, not religious emblems employed here as such), -- nor Mangalas, auspicious symbols, but the arms of the three towns mentioned in L3 of the record.’...” (BM Barua, 1929, The Sohgaura copper-plate inscription, ABORI, vol. 11, 1929, pp. 31-48).
The text of the inscription (which is considered by some to of pre-Mauryan days, i.e. circa 4th century BCE) refers to some famine relief measures and notifies the establishment of two public storehouses at a junction of three great highways of vehicular traffic to meet the needs of persons (apparently merchants and metal-workers) using these roads. The first line which is full of glyphs or devices should relate to the inscription and the facilities provided to the traders. Next to the symbol of the kos.t.haagaara is a s’u_la (spear). This is phonetically cuula ‘kiln’ for metals to be heated and copper/bronze/brass vessels and tools, worked on by metalsmiths. Similarly, the first glyph of a tree on a platform can be read as kuti ‘tree’; another word kuti in Santali means a ‘furnace’ for melting metals. The other devices are: three peaks mounted by a rimless pot, a rim of a jar, a tree branch with a bird perched on top. These can also be explained in the context of Sarasvati heiroglyphs and the context of metals/minerals-trade.
The second symbol from the left and the second symbol from the right may refer to a kos.t.haagaara. Ko.s.thaagaara is a pair of storehouses are referred to by this name in the Sohgaura plaque inscription, and illustrated on the same plaque (Fleet, The tradition about the corporeal relics of Buddha, JRAS, 1907, pp. 341-363: I find a mention of a place named Chanchu, which I take to be the same one, in the Sohgaura plate (JASB, 63, 1894. proceedings, 86, plate; IA, 25. 262). That record, as I understand it, is a public notification relating to three great highways of vehicular traffic...It notifies that at the junction, named Manavasi, of the three roads, in two villages named Dasilimata and Usagama, storehouses were made for the goods of people using the roads. It indicates the roads by mentioning in line 3, the three places to and from which they led; as regards the junction of them.). They are described as trigarbha, having three rooms; Fleet discusses this at length, but it is evident from the illustrations that these rooms are on three storeys, for the storehouses are represented as small three-storeyed pavilions; it is true that the roof of the top storey is "out of the picture," but its supporting pillars can be clearly eeen. For another use of garbha as designating chambers of a many-storeyed building, see Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Indian Architectural Terms, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 48, no. 3, SEPT 1928, pp.250-275. The devices on the top line of the Sohgaura copper plate can be read rebus as hieroglyphs, as in the case of Sarasvati hieroglyphs: 1. tree, kut.i (as smelting furnace); 2. tree twigs, kut.i (as smelting furnace); 3. cup, bat.i (as a furnace for melting iron ore); 4. bird, bat.a (as iron or metal); 4. two kos.t.ha_ga_ra (as storehouses), comparable to a sign graph with four posts used on Sarasvati epigraphs (so called Indus inscriptions); three mountains with a U graph on top summit. The presence of furnace facilities for working with metal tools in the two warehouses can be explained in the context of the types of conveyances, parts of which may require mending and to work/tinker on metallic articles and wares of itinerant merchants who need such publicly provided facilities in times of emergency as the s’a_sana in Brahmi writing notes.

This note has presented two continuities from Sarasvati civilization: 1. use of punches to mark devices on punch-marked coins and 2. use of copper plate to convey message related to an economic transaction.



12
This continuity of tradition is linked by the metallurgical tradition of s’reni/artisan guilds working with metals, minerals and furnaces to create copper/bronze artifacts and terracotta or s’ankha bangles and ornaments of silver, copper or semi-precious stones such as agate, carnelian or lapis lazuli. The code of the writing system which was employed on Sarasvati hieroglyphs with 5 or 6 sign graphs constituting an inscription, is the same code which was employed on devices of punch-marked coins (produced in mints belonging to guilds) and on copper plate s’a_s’ana-s or historical periods of pre-mauryan times in India, like the evidence presented by Sohgaura copper plate. Since this plate contains a Brahmi inscription, this constitutes a Rosetta stone to explain the meanings of the sign graphs or glyphs employed on the top line of the plate in the context of the facilities provided in two warehouses to traveling caravan merchants or rive-faring merchants. http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2012/07/sohgaura-copper-plate-inscription-as.html
"The oldest northern document was supposed at one time Oldest to be the dedication of the relics of Buddha at Piprawa, which was believed to date from about 450 b. c, but more recent criticism has thrown doubt upon that theory. 5 At present the oldest extant inscription is the Sohgaura copper plate from the Gorakhpur district, which is tentatively assigned to a date about fifty years prior to Asoka. This document, which is concerned with government storehouses, needs further elucidation." https://archive.org/stream/earlyhistoryofi00smit/earlyhistoryofi00smit_djvu.txt (Vincent A Smith, 1924, The early history of India from 600 BCE to the Muhammadan conquest, including the invasion of Alexander the Great, OUP).
"From all of undivided Bengal, less than two dozen copperplate charters are known for the entire period preceding the ascent of the Pala dynasty, and only a single (fragmentary) stone inscription. Two new copperplates have recently come to light, both from the Puṇḍravardhana area, i.e. North Bengal. The first is dated to year 159 of the Gupta era (478 CE), and hence issued during the reign of Budhagupta; the second is dated to the year 5 of a previously unknown king named Pradyumnabandhu, who must have ruled in the period between about 550 and 650 ce—a period for which Puṇḍravardhana had heretofore lacked any historical documentation. This article makes the new inscriptions available in edition with translation and some discussion of what the contents might contribute to the historical study of early Bengal." Arlo Griffiths.

Review of the 'archaeological scandal' :
The Buddha and Dr Führer: an Archaeological Scandal by Charles Allen - review Sara Wheeler on the man who claimed to have found the Buddha's birthplace By Sara Wheeler 2:00AM GMT 05 Jan 2009
In 1898, on an estate between the foothills of the Himalayas and the Gangetic Plains, a thirdgeneration British planter called William Claxton Peppé excavated an intriguing brick stupa. At 24 feet, he unearthed a hefty stone coffer containing five reliquary vases. Besides a glittering heap of jewels and gold, one of the vases held ashes. An inscription around the rim recorded that the ashes were the remains of the Buddha, and that they had been deposited by members of his Sakya clan.



14
In this dense and quirky volume, Charles Allen unravels the saga of the discovery, a twisted tale of truth and lies that has divided Buddhist scholars for a century. He begins, quite properly, by reconstructing the forested Tarai landscape of the fifth century BC in which the Buddha grew up, material he touched on in his 2002 volume The Buddha and the Sahibs. The account of Peppé’s dig that follows includes a cast list ranging from civil servants to Sanskrit scholars and a maverick Bengali babu, as well as extensive and informative background material. One gripping passage reveals how the various prakrit or vulgar languages the Aryans introduced were formalised into Sanskrit, which went on to become the dominant literary language of northern India and Mahayana Buddhism. Unfortunately, shortly after Peppé’s discovery, a German archaeologist called Dr Anton Führer, a former Catholic priest digging 15 miles away, was involved in an archaeological scandal. Führer had claimed to have discovered the Buddha’s birthplace at Lumbini, just over the border in Nepal, as well as the city where the young Buddha lived as Prince Siddhartha. The trouble was that Führer had been tangentially involved in the Peppé dig – an association that cast doubt on the authenticity of the vase and its ashes. Allen suggests, plausibly enough, that the German “willingly suspended disbelief” in his desperation to find answers. “Führer wanted,” writes Allen, “to believe that the sacred landscape explored ... in the fifth and seventh centuries still existed in that same idealised form in the last decade of the 19th century. So strongly did he believe this that he sought to make it so.” I would have liked more on Führer, as one ends up with little sense of the man. Overall, though, as in his previous work, Allen displays a strong sense of narrative, conjuring shikaris bent over trenches in their enormous solar topees while a naked sadhu from the local temple looks on from the shade of a banyan tree, no doubt thinking all foreigners insane.
A comprehensive final chapter assesses the validity of the Peppé dig using carbon dating. In dealing with recent discoveries in the region, and with modern interpretations of the evidence, Allen covers the grim, yet hilarious battle, between India and Nepal over the true location of the Buddha’s birthplace. Unlike the respective tourist boards, he concludes that we don’t yet know where exactly the Buddha was born and raised, though Allen favours the Nepalese claim that the ruins of Tilaurakot by the river Banganga are the site of Kapilavastu. And he vouches for the authenticity of Peppé’s discoveries. Allen is a distinguished author in the field; his previous books include Plain Tales from the Raj andKipling Sahib. He is a scrupulous researcher who respects his sources. In these pages he pieces the story together like the shards of a broken vase while avoiding the Führer tendency to reach hasty conclusions. The Buddha and Dr Führer represents a personal mission to remove the stain of impropriety from an important set of archaeological findings, and Allen has achieved his goal with admirable rigour. The book is well illustrated with integrated maps, photographs and artistic images. None the less, this latest offering has a much narrower appeal than the author’s previous work, and its detailed analysis of archaeological history will discourage all but the most committed Buddhist scholars.
