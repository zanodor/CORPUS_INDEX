TRUBNER'8 ORIENTAL SERIES.
"A knowledge of the commonplace, at least, of Oriental literature, philosophy, and religion is as necessary to the general reader of the present day as an acquaintance with the Latin and Greek classics was a generation or so ago. Immense strides have been made within the present century in these branches of learning ; Sanskrit has been brought within the range of accurate philology, and its invaluable ancient literature thoroughly investigated ; the language and sacred books of the Zoroasti'ians have been laid bare ; Egyptian, Assyrian, and other records of the remote past have been deciphered, and a group of scholars speak of still more recondite Accadiau and Hittite monuments ; but the results of all the scholarship that has been devoted to these subjects have been almost inaccessible to the public because they were contained for the most part in learned or expensive woi-ks, or scattered throughout the numbers of scientific periodicals. Messrs. Trubner & Co., in a spirit of enterprise which does them infinite credit, have determined to supply the constantly-increasing want, and to give in a popular, or, at least, a comprehensive form, all this mass of knowledge to the world."

economic and political condition of India at the present time, or more interesting
than his scholarly history of the India of the past."

ESSAYS ON THE SACRED LANGUAGE, WRITINGS,

by Prof. E. P. Evans. I. History of the Researches into the Sacred Writings and Religion of the

' Essays on the Sacred Language, "Writings, and Religion of the Parsis,' by the
late Dr. Martin Haug, edited by Dr. E. W. West. The author intended, on his return
from India, to expand the naaterials contained in this work into a comprehensive
account of the Zoroastrian religion, but the design was frustrated by his untimely
death. We have, however, in a concise and readable form, a history of the researches
into the sacred writings and religion of the Parsis from the earliest times down to
the present—a dissertation on the languages of the Parsi Scriptures, a translation
of the Zend-Avesta, or the Scripture of the Parsis, and a dissertation on the Zoroastrian religion, with especial reference to its origin and development."

TEXTS FROM THE BUDDHIST CANON
COMMONLY KNOWN AS " DHAMMAPADA."
With Accompanying Narratives.
Translated from the Chinese by S. BEAL, B.A., Professor of Chinese, University College, London.
The Dhammapada, as hitherto known by the Pali Text Edition, as edited
by FausboU, by Max Miiller's English, and Albrecht Weber's German translations, consists only of twenty-six chapters or sections, whilst the Chinese version, or rather recension, as now translated by Mr. Beal, con
sists of thirty-nine sections. The students of Pali who possess Fausboll's text, or either of the above-named translations, will therefore needs want Mr. Beal's English rendering of the Chinese version ; the thirteen abovenamed additional sections not being accessible to them in any other form ; for, even if they understand Chinese, the Chinese original would be unobtainable by them. "Mr. Seal's rendering of the Chinese translation is a most valuable aid to the
critical study of the work. It contains authentic texts gathered from ancient canonical books, and generally connected with some incident in the history of
Buddha. Their great interest, however, consists in the light which they throw upon
everyday life in India at the remote period at which they were written, and upon
the method of teaching adopted by the founder of the religion. The method
employed was principally parable, and the simplicity of the tales and the excellence
of the morals inculcated, as well as the strange hold which they have retained upon
the minds of millions of people, make them a very remarkable study."— ^'imes.
"Mr. Beal, by making it accessible in an English dress, has added to the great ser vices he has already rendered to the comparative study of religious history."

Academy "Valuable as exhibiting the doctrine of the Buddhists in its purest, least adul
terated form, it brings the modern reader face to face with that simple creed and rule
of conduct whicli won its way over the minds of myriads, and which is now nominally
professed by 145 millions, who have overlaid its austere simplicity with innumerable
ceremonies, forgotten its maxims, perverted its teaching, and so inverted its leading
principle that a religion whose founder denied a God, now worships that founder as a god himself, "

THE HISTORY OF INDIAN LITERATURE. By ALBRECHT WEBER.
Translated from the Second German Edition by John Mann, M.A., and
Theodor Zachaeiae, Ph.D., with the sanction of the Author.
Dr. BuHLER, Inspector of Schools in India, writes: — "When I was Professor of Oriental Languages in Elphinstone College, I frequently felt the want of such a work to which I could refer the students."
Professor CowELL, of Cambridge, writes : — "It will be especially useful to the students in our Indian colleges and universities. I used to long for such a book when I was teaching in Calcutta. Hindu students are intensely interested in the histoi-y of Sanskrit literature, and this volume will supply them with all they want on the subject."
Professor Whitney, Yale College, Newhaven, Conn., U.S.A., writes :
" I was one of the class to whom the work was originally given in the form
of academic lectures. At their first appearance they were by far the most learned and able treatment of their subject ; and with their recent additions they still maintain decidedly the same rank."
" Is perhaps the most comprehensive and lucid survey of Sanskrit literature
extant. The essays contained in the volume were originally delivered as academic
lectures, and at the time of their first publication were acknowledged to be by far
the most learned and able treatment of the subject. They have now been brought
up to date by the addition of all the most important results of recent research."Times.

A SKETCH OF
THE MODERN LANGUAGES OF THE EAST INDIES.
By ROBERT N. CUST.
The Author has attempted to fill up a vacuum, the inconvenience of
which pressed itself on his notice. Much had been written about the languages of the East Indies, but the extent of our present knowledge had
not even been brought to a focus. It occurred to him that it might be of use to others to publish in an arranged form the notes which he had collected
for his own edification. " Supplies a deficiency which has long been felt."

Times.
" The book before us is then a valuable contribution to philological science. It
passes under review a vast number of languages, and it gives, or professes to give, in
every case the sum and substance of the opinions and judg-mentsof the best-informed writers."

"These are tales supposed to have been told by the Buddha of what he had seen
and heard in his previous births. They are probably the nearest representatives of the original Aryan stories from 'which sprang the folk-lore of Europe as well as India.

" In this new volume of Messrs. Trubner's Oriental Series, Mr. Edwin Arnold does
good service by illustrating, through the medium of his musical English melodies,
the power of Indian poetry to stir European emotions. Tlie ' Indian Song of Songs '
is not unknown to scholars. Mr. Arnold will have introduced it among popular
English poems. Nothing could be more graceful and delicate than the shades by
which Krishna is portrayed in the gradual process of being weaned by the love of ' Beautiful Radha, jasmine-bosomed Radha,' from the allurements of the forest nymphs, in whom the five senses are typified."

the work of translating Eastern ideas as Mr. Arnold has done in bis splendid para
phrases of language contained in these mighty e^ics,." —Daily Telegraph.

THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
By a. earth.
Translated from the French with the authority and assistance of the Author,
The author has, at the request of the publishers, considerably enlarged the work for the translator, and has added the literature of the subject to date ; the translation may, therefore, be looked upon as an equivalent of a
new and improved edition of the original.
" Is not only a valuable manual of the religions of India, which marks a distinct
step in the treatment of the subject, but also a useful work of reference."—.^icadem?/.
"This volume is a reproduction, with corrections and additions, of an article
contributed by the learned author two years ago to the ' Encyclopedic des Sciences
Religieuses.' It attracted much notice when it first appeared, and is generally
admitted to present the best summary extant of the vast subject with which it deals."

Tablet.
" This is not only on the whole the best but the only manual of the religions of
India, apart from Buddhism, whicli we have in English. The present work . . .
shows not only great knowledge of the facts and power of clear exposition, but also great insight into the inner history and the deeper meaning of the great religion, for it is in reality only one, which it proposes to describe."

Modern Review.
" The merit of the work has been emphatically recognised by the most authoritative
Orientalists, both in this country and on the continent of Europe, But probably

Kapila is the ' earliest attempt on record to give an answer, from reason alone,
to the mysterious questions which arise in every tho\ightful mind about the origin of
the world, the nature and relations of man and his future destiny,' and in his learned
and able notes he exhibits 'the connection of the Sankhya system with the philosophy of Spinoza,' and ' the connection of the system of Kapila with that of Schopen
hauer and Von Hartmann.' "

Foreign Church Chronicle.
" Mr. Davies's volume on Hindu Philosophy is an undoubted gain to all students
of the development of thought. The system of Kapila, which is here given in a translation from the Sankhya Karika, is the only contribution of India to pure philosophy.
. . . Presents many points of deep interest to the student of comparative philosophy, and without Mr. Davies's lucid interpretation it would be difiicult to appreciate these points in any adequate manner."

A MANUAL OF HINDU PANTHEISM. VEDANTASARA,
Translated, with copious Annotations,
By Major G. A. JACOB,
Bombay Staff Corps ; Inspector of Army Schools.
The design of this little work is to provide for missionaries, and for others who, like them, have little leisure for original research, an accurate summai-y of the doctrines of the Vedanta.
" The modest title of Major Jacob's work conveys but an inadequate idea of the
vast amount of research embodied in his notes to the text of the Vedantasara. So
copious, indeed, are these, and so much coUateral matter do they bring to bear on
the subject, that the diUgent student will rise from their perusal with a fairly
adequate view of Hindu philosophy generally. His work ... is one of the best of
its kind that we have seen."

•'The first instalment of Dr. Hahn's labours will be of interest, not at the Cape
only, but in every University of Ei>rope. It is, in fact, a most valuable contribution to the comparative study of religion and mythology. Accounts of their religion and

what he has been able to collect himself."

By C. p. TIELE,
Doctor of Theology, Professor of the History of Eeligions in the University of Leyden.
Translated from the Dutch by J. Estlin Carpenter, M.A.
" Few books of its size contain the result of so much wide thinking, able and labo
rious study, or enable the reader to gain a better bird's-eye view of the latest results
of investigations into the religious history of nations. As Professor Tiele modestly
says, ' In this little book are outlines—pencil sketches, I might say— nothing more.'
But there are some men whose sketches from a thumb-nail are of far more worth
than an enormous canvas covered with the crude painting of others, and it is easy to
see that these pages, fuU of information, these sentences, cut and perhaps also dry, short and clear, condense the fruits of long and thorough research."

PREFACE.
Since Colonel H. Yule began to publish his extensive
researches on European mediaeval travellers to Eastern
Asia, a lively interest has been awakened, not only among
professional geographers and Orientalists, but also among
general readers, in the accounts left by those adventurous
men who in the Middle Ages, in the period of the Mongol
domination, crossed the inhospitable wildernesses of Cen
tral and Eastern Asia. Towards the middle of the four
teenth century, in the period of the decline and the fall
of the Mongol dynasty, these regions became again imper
vious, and then for many centuries remained inaccjessible
to European exploration.
Colonel Yule's first work on the subject, " Cathay and
the Way Thither," was published in 1866, just when the
Kussian conquests and discoveries in Central Asia com
menced to throw new geographical light upon these tracts.
Five years later, in 1 871, appeared his " Book of Marco
Polo," an admirable monument of erudition, which did
not fail to assure to the learned commentator of the
celebrated mediaeval traveller the success of unrivalled
competency in this field of investigation. A new edition
of the work, much enlarged and revised, was issued in

As I was living in China when these so ably elucidated
editions of mediaeval travellers were published, and taking,
of course, the highest interest in the chapters relating to
the Far East, it was soon evident to me that the most
important sources of information derived from Chinese
literature bearing upon the subject had never been made
use of by the commentators of Marco Polo and of other
mediaeval travellers. Colojiel Yule, not having access to
the Chinese authors in their original language, had been
confined in his quotations from Chinese works to trans
lations, in some cases not very trustworthy, by European
sinologues.^
Taking advantage, therefore, of the favourable circum
stances under which I found myself placed for many years,
for bringing together all materials supplied by Chinese
literature regarding the mediaeval history and geography
of Middle Asia, I published from 1874 to 1876 a series of
papers giving the results of my researches.
It seems" to me that Peking is the only place where
such investigations can be successfully carried out, for
the greater part of the ancient Chinese books required for
reference can hardly be found in any European library
or in other parts of China. The Eussian Ecclesiastical
Mission in Peking possesses a very valuable and rare
collection of Chinese works, purchased through a long
series of years at the expense of the Eussian Government.
Moreover, since the opening of the Chinese capital as a
residence for foreign legations and missionaries in i860,
many eminent sinologues have taken up their abode within
^ In the Introduction to my paper on Chinese Mediaeval Travellers, 1875, I ventured to show by numerous examples how little entitled to confidence are the numerous translations from the Chinese as given by the late M. Pauthier in his bulky work on Marco Polo, and in his essays of a kindred character

its walls, to several of whom I am deeply indebted for
kind assistance in my researches. I may mention in
tlie first place the late Archimandrite Palladius, who was
always Avilling to communicate the valuable information
which he had collected during his long residence in
Peking (since 1840) regarding the literature of China.
I am not less indebted to my lamented friend W. Fr.
Mayers, late Chinese Secretary of the British Legation,
whose unexpected death deprived Orientalists, and espe
cially sinologues, of one of their most accomplished and
zealous representatives.^
I have also been laid under much obligation by a friend
of many years' standing, Mr. C. Arendt, first Chinese
Interpreter of the German Legation, and one of the most
erudite and competent among living sinologues. He has
frequently assisted me in the elucidation of difficult
passages found in the Chinese texts of these ancient
books.
When my papers on the Mediaeval Geography, &c., of
Asia first passed through the press in Shanghai, about four
teen years ago, I had the great advantage of my late friend
A. Wylie's kind assistance, not only in taking charge of
the proof-reading, but also in giving himself the trouble
previously to study critically my manuscripts, and to
illustrate my publications with many valuable notes,
showing his intimate and multifarious acquaintance with
the languages of the East, as well as with the history,
astronomy, and mediaeval geography of.Eastern nations.
About three years have elapsed since I was invited by
the late Nicolas Triibner to prepare for his " Oriental
Series " a new edition of those of my Asiatic papers re

lating to the mediseval geography of Central and Western
Asia. I accepted the proposition, and thus the subjects
dealt with in the two volumes form a carefully revised
and improved edition of three of the above-mentioned
essays, gathered into one collection, viz.

1. Notes on Chinese Mediaeval Travellers to the West.
1875.
2. Notices of the Mediaeval Geography and History of
Central and Western Asia. 1876.
3. Chinese Intercourse with the Countries of Central
and Western Asia during the Fifteenth Century. 1877.
Since the first publication of these papers, large ad
ditions have been made to the stock of our knowledge
regarding the regions of Central Asia, which previously
to the Eussian occupation of these tracts had been in
accessible to scientific exploration. Thus new light has
been thrown upon many interesting geographical ques
tions suggested by the narratives of mediaeval travellers,
or hitherto based only upon more modern but vague and
dubious Chinese accounts.
To bring the new edition of those former researches up
to the present advanced state of knowledge on the subject,
I had to study a vast amount of literature, written for the
greater part in Eussian, which has come to light during
the last fifteen years, on Central Asia, and was obliged to
read through a great number of works and papers, some
of them published in Eussian Turkestan, and, therefore,
difficult to obtain.^ In general, all reading accessible to
me bearing on the subject has been made use of for the

elucidation of mediaeval geographical questions arising out
of my researches.
Although, after the extensive surveys made by order of
the Eussian Government in the newly-conquered Asiatic
provinces, there is no want of detailed maps of Central
Asia and other parts of the Asiatic continent, I have
nevertheless prepared a sketch map illustrating the narra
tives of Chinese mediaeval travellers. The map appended
to this volume was originally intended to elucidate the
travels of Cliang Ch*un, whose route is marked in red,
but it will be also found serviceable in following the
itineraries of other Chinese and Western mediaeval tra
vellers of the Mongol period.

NOTES ON CHINESE MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS TO THE WEST.

INTKODUCTION.
Chinese literature, so vast in extent, contains very considerable accounts of the geography of Asia at different times, and of the nations who formerly lived in that part of the ancient world. The greater part of these accounts is to be found in the histories of the various dynasties which have up to the present time successively ruled in China. At the end of each of these dynastic histories, twentyfour in^ number, a section more or less extensive is found devoted to the foreign countries and nations who came in contact with the Chinese empire. They are generally termed sz yi, the four kinds of barbarians, in allusion to the four quarters of the globe. These notices were probably collected by Chinese envoys, or compiled from the reports of envoys or merchants of those countries coming to China. Almost all Chinese works treating of foreign countries drew their accounts from these sources; and even the celebrated Chinese geographer and historian Ma Tuan lin, who wrote under the Mongol dynasty, has for the greater part compiled his excellent work, the Wen Men fung UaOy from the dynastic histories.^ Another category of Chinese accounts of foreign countries is drawn up in the form of narratives of journeys undertaken by Chinese. It seems the Chinese never travelled
^ The Marquis d'Hervey de St. Denys was the first sinologue to attempt the tr£inslation of the whole section of the Wen hien t'ung k"ao referring to countries beyond China proper. Two volumes of his able translations, provided with valuable notes, have hitherto been published, with the title Ethnographie des Peuples etrangers d la Chine : I. Orientaux, 1876; IL Meridionaux, 1883.



4 INTRODUCTION.
for pleasure, or visited distant countries for the purpose of enlarging the sphere of their ideas, as Europeans are accustomed to do. All the narratives of travel we meet in Chinese literature owe their origin either to military expeditions, or official missions of the Chinese emperors, or they were written by Buddhist or other pilgrims who visited India or other parts of Asia famed for their sanctity. The number of such reports, written by Chinese travellers on different parts of Asia beyond China, is by no means inconsiderable. They often contain very valuable accounts regarding the ancient geography of Asia ; but it is not easy to lay them under contribution in elucidating
this subject in a European scientific sense. Generally it
is difficult to search them out ; for they do not exist, for the greater part, as separate publications, but lie concealed among the numerous volumes of the Chinese collections of reprints (tsung sJm). Many of these interesting 'ancient
narratives of travels have been lost, and their existence in former times is only known from ancient catalogues or by the quotations of other Chinese authors. In order that Western science may profit by the study of these narratives, it is necessary not only that they be correctly translated, but these translations require a great number of explanations, without which they would still remain unintelligible to savants unacquainted with the Chinese language and the Chinese manner of viewing things, so different from our way of looking at the same. I intend in the following pages to give some translations of ancient Chinese accounts of travels to Western Asia, and shall try to explain them as far as my knowledge and the means of reference at my disposal will permit. But next
I shall confine my investigations solely to the period embraced by the thirteenth century, the period of the development and the zenith of the power of the Mongols in Asia. It seems that at that time Eastern Mongolia was connected with Persia and Eussia by great highways through Central Asia. The Chinese and Mongol writers of that period



INTRODUCTION. 5
record that Chingliiz Khan on his expedition to Western Asia in 12 19, first established these roads, and had many difficulties in leading them through the inaccessible mountains, which in some places stopped the passage. It is further related that the great conquerors successor, Ogotai Khan, established on these roads military stations on a large scale. At that time considerable Mongol armies were sent repeatedly to the far west, overrunning Western Asia and the eastern part of Europe. Couriers passed hither and thither, as well as envoys from different Western kingdoms ; and even the kings themselves were often obliged to render homage in person to the great Khan, at his residence in the depths of Mongolia. We learn from the Eussian annals that Eussian princes, and even granddukes, were forced to undertake the long and painful journey to Karakorum, in order to obtain their investiture. One of them, the Grand-Duke Yaroslav, died on his way home, in the desert of Mongolia, in 1246. Another sovereign of the West, Haithon, king of Little Armenia, has described his journey to the court of Mangu Khan
in 1254. Eight years before, in 1246, Piano Carpini, a Franciscan friar, despatched by Pope Innocent, had visited the Mongol court. Another Franciscan monk,
Riibruquis, or rather BitbroucJc, was sent, in 1253, on a
similar mission to Carpini's, by Sfc. Louis, and arrived at the Mongol camp in the reign of Mangu Khan. Narratives of both journeys have come down to us. Finally, the great traveller Marco Polo traversed Central Asia in the second half of the thirteenth century, and then spent many years in China at the court of Khubilai Khan. He has left behind detailed accounts of the countries he visited, which have been for several centuries the subject of learned investigations and commentaries by distinguished
orientalists. Considering the rich material furnished by these Western mediseval travellers in relation to the knowledge of the ancient geography of Central Asia, and the valuable



6 INTRODUCTION.
accounts on the same subject given by several Persian authors contemporary with the rise of the Mongol Empire, it seems to me that some notices about what the Chinese authors of the same period say regarding Central and Western Asia will present some interest. Besides numerous statements relating to the above-mentioned regions found scattered in the Yuan shi or Chinese history of the Mongol dynasty, and other Chinese historical or geographical works treating of the Mongols, there have been preserved five Chinese narratives of journeys to the far West, published in the thirteenth century, and these form the subject of my investigations. The first in point of date comprises the itinerary of Chinghiz Khan's army from Mongolia through Central Asia to Persia in 12 19. The author of this narrative was Ye-lil Cliio tsai, Chinghiz Khan's minister, who accompanied the great conqueror on his expedition to the west. The Mongol army then went, for the greater part, by the same route by which Cli ang ch'an (y. infra) proceeded. The next in chronological order is the short and somewhat confused record of an envoy of the Kin emperor (North China), sent in 1220 through Central Asia to Persia, and as far as the Hindukush mountains, to meet Chinghiz Khan there. The third place in the series will be given to the journey of the Taoist monk CKang cJiun, made by order of Chinghiz, from China to Samarkand, also to the encampment of the conqueror in the Hindukush mountains. This narrative, before all others, claims attention as regards the detailed accounts and trustworthy observations by which
it is characterised. The traveller left his native country, the province of Shan tung, A.D. 1220, went to Yen (the present Peking), rested there some time, and then crossed the eastern part of Mongolia in a north-eastern direction, in order to present himself to Chinghiz' younger brother, TJdjughen, who had his encampment at that time near



INTRODUCTION. 7
the lake Buyiir, in the north-eastern corner of Mongolia. From thence he went along the river Kerulun to the west, crossed the mountainous country in which afterwards the celebrated Mongol residence Karakorum was founded, and passed probably near the present Uliassutai. Then we can pursue his route over the Kin shan mountains or the Chinese Altai, across the desert, to Bishbalik,
situated, as is generally believed, somewhere near the present Urumtsi, and along the northern slope of the T'ien shan or Celestial mountains to the lake Sairam. Thence the diarist of the journey mentions the city of Almalik, situated in the present province of Hi, the Chu river (only, however, spoken of on the way back), the ^river Talas, and the city of Sairam (still existing to the northeast of Tashkend). Farther on Ch'ang ch'un crossed the laxartes, arrived at Samarkand, and after having rested there some months, set out to meet Chinghiz, who was at that time in the Hindukush mountains, on the frontier of India. He was obliged to make this journey from Samarkand to the Hindukush twice. On this route he passed the Iron gate south of Samarkand, crossed the Oxus, came to Balkh, &c. On his homeward way our traveller followed the same route by which he came; went at first in the suite of Chinghiz, who was returning home from his expedition ; but afterwards he was permitted to go in advance, reached the country west of the present Uliassutai, and from there went directly across the Mongolian desert to about the present Kukukhotun and Peking, where he arrived in 1224. The fourth Chinese mediaeval traveller to Western Asia whose account I have translated is Gliang Te. He was sent in 1259 by Mangu Khan to the Khan's brother, Hulagu, who was at the head of the expedition against the Calif of Baojdad. Cli an cr Te left Karakorum, and passed by the lake of Kizilbash. From Almalik to Samarkand he followed, it seems, the same way as Ch'ang ch'un. Thence he proceeded to the west, crossed the



8 INTRODUCTION.
Oxus, arrived at the Elburs mountains and the country where the Mulahi or Assassins lived. It does not seem that he went himself to Bagdad, but he describes the residence of the Calif as well as Egypt, India, and other countries of the West. Finally, I give the translation of the biography of a Mongol officer, Ye-lu Hi Hang, in which his adventures during his peregrinations in Central Asia, a.d. 1260-62,
are recorded.

EXTRACT FROM THE SI YU LU.
It is kno^Yn that Ye-lil CJiu tsai, Chinghiz Khan's minister, who accompanied the conqueror on his expedition to Persia, 1219-24, has left behind an account of the places and countries they passed through, which was published with the title Si yu lu, " Account of a Journey to the West." The original book does not seem to exist now, but I was fortunate in finding at least an abstract of it preserved in one of the vast Chinese collections of reprints. Unhappily, the Chinese, in making abstracts from more extensive works, are seldom able to distinguish between what is important and what is not ; and in the present abstract, consequently, some passages, which have been separated from the context, are not quite intelligible. Nevertheless it is of no little importance, even in its mutilated form, regarding the elucidation of the mediaeval geography of Asia, and enables us to trace the great highway by which the Mongol armies passed from Mongolia to Western Asia; a subject all the more interesting, as the Persian authors say very little about it. Before giving the translation of the abstract of the Si yu lu, I may be allowed to say a few words about the author of the original narrative. As is stated in his long biography,

^ An abstract of his biography is also given in the Yuan shi lei pien. The author of this " History of the Mongol Dynasty in China " has added some interesting notes, drawn from rare books, not found in the Yiian shi. AbelRemusat in his "Nouv. M^l. Asiat," ii. 64.seqq., has translated a part of these biographical notes.

dant of the imperial family of the Liao or Ki-tan, which dynasty reigned over Northern China, A.D. 916-1125, and was overthrown by the Kin. Ye-lil was the name of the imperial family of the Liao. Ch'ii ts'ai was descended from a son of ApoM, the founder of the Liao dynasty ; his ancestor had a small principality near the celebrated mount Yi wu lil, situated near the present Kuang ning hien in Manchuria ; his father was a hig^h of&cer in the service of the Kin. Ch'u ts'ai was born in A.D. 1190. At the time Chinghiz Khan's army took the residence of the Kin (the present Peking), in 121 5, he was made prisoner. Chinghiz attached him to his person, and after having proved his capabilities, gave him the highest post in his empire. Ch'u ts'ai accompanied Chinghiz on his expedition to Western Asia. According to the Chinese annals, he acted also an important part as statesman during the reigns of Chinghiz' successors. He died, as the Yuan shi reports, of grief over the bad administration of the empire, during the regency of Turokina, in 1243, it seems, at (Peking. The Ji hia Jciu wen, an archaeological
and historical description of Peking and its neighbourhood, published in the seventeenth century, states that Ch'u ts'ai was buried at the southern foot of the hill Weng shan, near Peking. In 1627 the temple with his grave still existed there, containing his marble statue and that of his wife. He was represented with long moustaches reaching down to his knees. In his biography it is also stated that Chinghiz, when he first saw him, was surprised by his tall figure and his splendid beard. According to another statement (in a description of Liao tung of the Ming time), Ch'u ts'ai was buried at the cemetery of his ancestors near Mount Yi wu lii, in Manchuria. This seems more plausible, and then there may have been at the Weng shan only a temple and a monument to his memory. In another and more complete edition of the Ji hia kiu wen, published in 1774, it is stated that the name of the Weng shan was changed, in the reign

of K*ien lung, to Wan shou shan, and that at that time no traces of Ch'u ts'ai's monument remained; but in 175 1, by imperial order, a new temple and a monument were erected there in honour of the meritorious statesman. Wan shou shau (the Hill of Longevity) bears up to this time the same name. It is a lovely hill, about seven miles north-west of Peking, till the war in i860 the summer residence of the Chinese emperor. As is known, the noble palace there was destroyed and burnt by the allied armies. I have frequently visited this place, with its picturesque ruins, covered with climbing plants, and overshadowed by dense groves reflected in the azure lake, but was not able to detect amongst the ruins the monument of Chinohiz Khan's minister.
o
It is strange that Eashid-eddin, the able Persian historian, who gives such circumstantial accounts of the history of the Mongols, and mentions all the ministers and other high officers of that empire, and for the greater part in perfect accordance with the Chinese historians who compiled the official documents of the Mongols, does not mention at all Ye-lu Ch'u ts'ai, who by the Chinese, however, is celebrated not only as an ingenious statesman, but also as a distinguished astronomer and poet. D'Ohsson, therefore, in his " Histoire des Mongols " (ii.
p. 193-194), tries to identify Ch'u ts'ai with Mahmiid TehadJ, often mentioned by the Persian authors as a high officer under Chinghiz and his successors. But d'Ohsson is wrong ; the name of Yelvadj occurs repeatedly in the Yuan shi, and other Chinese historical works of that period. Eashid states that Mahmud Yelvadj was a Mohammedan, and that his son, Mass'ud Bey, afterwards governed Turkestan and Transoxiana.
In the Yuan shi annals, year a.d. 125 i (eight years after Ch'u ts'ai died), we read that Ya-lao-wa-cKi was appointed governor of the province of Yen king (E"orthern China), and Ma-su-hn (Mass'ud) governor in Bi-sJii-ha-li (Bishbalik), and other countries. In the Yuan diao pi

shij a Chinese translation of a Mongol history of the Mongols, written 1240, Ye-lii Ch'a ts'ai's name does not appear, but Yelvadj is mentioned there as a Mohammedan from Urgendj. In the Tsin cKeng lu, a description of Chinghiz Khan's exploits, written about the close of the Mongol dynasty, mention is made of both at the same time. It is there said : " The administration of the taxes on the land north of the Yellow Eiver was confided in 1229 to Wu-du sa-han, whilst the same appointment in the western countries was given to Ya-lu-wa-cKi, In 1 24 1 the latter took charge of the administration of the Chinese people." Urtu in Mongol means "long," sahal, " beard." Thus Wu-du sa-lian seems to be intended for " the long-bearded." I stated above that Ch'u ts'ai was famed for his long beard.
In the article I am about to translate, Ye-lii Ch'u ts'ai is not mentioned by this name, but by the name he bore as author, Chen jen Jcil shi. This abstract of his narrative is found in the first chapter of the Sim chai lao Mo tsung fan, a book written in the time of the Mongol dynasty (see Wylie's "Notes on Chin. Lit.," p. 134), and this is included in the bulky collection called Chi pu tsu chai tsung shu. The author first gives the names and titles of four generations of the Ye-lii family, beginning with Ch'u ts'ai's father, and states that all of them left behind memoirs, which tof^ether form a work of one hundred volumes, well known to all literary men. After this he states that Chen
jen kli shi (or Ch'u ts'ai), at the time of the rise of the Mongol empire, accompanied Chinghiz on his expedition to the West; that he travelled fifty or s:xty thousand li
;
that he remained six or seven years in the Western countries, and that he wrote a book ab^-iit his travels, which he named Si yu lu, " An Account Journey to the West." As this book was very rare (even at the time the author wrote), he considered it useful to preserve an
abstract of it, which he gives as follows :




57 YU LU {YE-LU CH'U TS'AI). 13
In the year a.d. 1218,^ in spring, in the third month (April), (Ye-lii Ch'u ts ai) left Yiln chung (the present Ta tung fu in Northern Shan si), crossed the T^en sJian mountain,^ traversed the ta tsi (great stony desert), and the sha mo (sandy desert), and reached the camp of Chinghiz Khan. In the next year (12 19) a vast army was raised and set in motion towards the west. The way lay through the Kin shall mountain.^ Even in the middle of the summer, masses
2 I shall always use in my translations, instead of the Chinese cyclic characters, the corresponding Christian date, which will be more convenient for the reader. My late friend A. Wylie has had the kindness to calculate for me all the Chinese dates occurring in the texts I translated. Of course Old Style is always to be understood. ^ T'ien shan, Celestial Mountains, is properly the name of the lofty chain in Central Asia, beginning in Russian Turkestan, and stretching eastward to the Mongolian desert beyond Hami. But here, in this case, evidently the Yin shan of modern Chinese maps is meant. This chain stretching from west to east in Southern Mongolia, is the boundary range between China and the Mongolian plateau. Among the Chinese geographers some trace its beginning from the Celestial Mountains, and therefore the two names are sometimes used promiscuously (compare note 152). A. V. Humboldt, independently of the Chinese views, it seems, inclined to the same opinion, that the Yin shan is a continuation of the T'ien shan (Ritter's " Asien," i, 236). This view, however, has not been confirmed by recent European explorations of those regions. Yin shan in Chinese means " Northern mountain." Father A. David visited the Yin shan in 1866 ; Colonel (now General) Przewalsky in 1871. 5 By Ein shan, or "Gold mountain," the Chinese understand the Altai range of our maps. The latter name has generally been derived from the Mongol word altan, gold. But, as Radloff and Potanin prove, this etymology is untenable, the name of the mountain being derived from al, high. Besides this, gold is very scarce in the Altai. The name of Kin shan is frequently met with in Chinese history ; it occurs, it seems, for the first time in the annals of the fifth century. According to Chinese records, the people of the T'u ku.: (Turks) took their origin in these mountains. The Kin shan is often mentioned in the Yiian shi or History of the Mongol dynasty, where it sometimes is also termed A-le-tai. In Rashid-eddin's
History of the F ' " dIs the Altai mountains are repeatedly noticed (see note 98). Thi. _ ^ ^itain chain takes its origin in Southern Siberia, southeast of Semipalatinsk, and then stretches in a south-eastern direction across Western Mongolia, nearly as far as the northern bend of the Yellow River. The upper part of the Mongolian (Chinese) Altai was form.erly, after Ritter, erroneously marked " Ektag Altai " on our maps. This name of Ektag, mentioned in the narrative of Zemarchus' mission to the Khan

of ice and snow accumulate in these mountains. The army passing that road was obliged to cut its way through the ice. The pines and kui trees ^ are so high, that they (seem to) reach heaven. The valleys there are all abounding in o^rass and flowers. The rivers west of the Kin
of the Turks in a.d. 570, is unknown to the Mongols now-a-days, and hardly refers to the Altai, During the last thirteen years the Chinese Altai has been repeatedly visited and crossed by Russian explorers : Colonel Matussovsky, 1873 ; Potanin, 1877 ; Colonel Pevtsoff, 1878. It is a high mountain, many of its summits being covered with eternal snow. As to the route followed by Chinghiz in crossing the Altai, there are only three of the roads leading over this mountain range which can be taken here into consideration, and which connect the city of Kohdo, situated east of the Altai, with the Chinese colony Bulun tokhoi, near the Kizilbash lake, and also with the city of Ku cKeng, on the northern skirt of the T'ien shan. The first of these roads, the shortest communication between Kobdo and Bulun tokhoi, practicable only in a part of the year for riders, leads through the defiles of Terekty (10,500 feet) and Urmogaity (9710 feet), north-west of Kobdo, to the sources of the Kran river, an aSluent of the Black Irtysh. Potanin proceeded by this way in September 1876 ("Mongolia," i. 30 seqq.). The second road passes from Kobdo in a southerly direction, crosses the Altai in the pass of Ulan daban, reaches the Bulgun river, and descends along it and its continuation the Ulungur, near the mouth of which Bulun tokhoi is situated. The Ulan daban pass seems to be more practicable than the Urmogaity, but it presents also great difficulties. This route was partly followed by a Russian caravan proceeding in 1877 from Kobdo to Ku ch'eng (Potanin, I. c, i. 124). The third road crosses the Altai still more to the south-east, in the pass of Dabysten daban. This is the Chinese post-road from Kobdo to Ku ch'eng, and also to Bulun tokhoi. It is practicable the whole year, and even for carts, it seems (Potanin, I. c, i. 128 seqq.). 1 am not prepared to decide by which of these roads the Mongol armies passed in 1219. Compare also below, notes 147, 148. Rashid-eddin states (d'Ohsson, i. 212, 216) that Chinghiz (after having crossed the Altai) passed the whole summer of 12 19 at the sources of the Irtysh river, in order to equip anew and complete his cavalry corps. In his march to the west with a numerous cavalry, Chinghiz was always obliged to choose such roads as presented the most abundant pastures. The valleys of the Upper Irtysh, as well as the Kran river, are still famed for their pastures. The same statement about Chinghiz encamping on the river Ye-rh-di-shi is recorded in the afore-mentioned Ts'in ch'eng lu. By the same Chinese characters the name of the Irtysh is repeatedly rendered in the Yiian shi (Annals, s. a. 1206, 1208 ; war with the Naimans). ^ Kui is the Chinese classical name for Juniperus cJiinensis, which tree attains generally a large size in China. But the Chinese traveller saw probably larch trees.

This river, as is known, discharges itself into the Zaisan lake, from the north-western corner of which it comes out again, and then bears the name Irtysh.

1579 Ran hai is an ancient Chinese name to designate the Mongolian desert, and especially, it seems, the elevated north-western part of it. This term occurs for the first time in the Chinese annals under the year B.C. 119. It is there stated that a Chinese general, after having defeated the Hiung nu (the troublesome northern neighbours of the Chinese), pursued them as far as the Han hai. A commentator of the T'ang dynasty explains han hai by " northern sea." Baron Richthofen (" China," i. 24) is wrong in translating these two characters by " dry sea." He bases thereupon the theory of the existence of a vast lake in ancient times in these regions which now-a-days present a barren desert. The Chinese annals of the fifth century notice the Han hai as the northern boundary of the Juan juan tribes, whose power in that period extended over the greater part of Mongolia. Two centuries later the Chinese annals (T'ang shu) state that the dominions of the T u Tcue (Turks) reached northward to the Han hai ; and we learn from the same T'ang history that in a.d. 630, in the country of the Hui hu (Uigurs, they occupied the land on the Upper Selenga, and its affluents), the tu tu fu (military governorship) of Han hai was established. Notwithstanding the fact that a Chinese commentator translated han hai by northern sea, there is no evidence from Chinese history that this term has ever been applied to an inland sea. The Ming Ti t'ung chi, or Geography of the Ming dynasty, under the head of Liu cKeng (situated between Turfan and Pichan), states expressly that han hai is not a Chinese name, but an appellation the barbarian tribes apply to the desert east of that place. On modern Chinese maps the desert east of Hami bears the name of Han hai. Li, a Chinese road measure. According to Williams' " Middle Kingdom," ii. p. 83, at present an English mile is = 2,89 li. Judging from some Chinese itineraries of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, it would seem that the length of the li has not considerably changed since that time. But Gaubil in his " Histoire de I'Astronomie Chinoise," i. 77, has proved

mew.^^ West of the aforesaid city, 200 li distant, is the city of Zim fai Men, where also a tablet of the T'ang is found.12 South of the city (of Bishbalik), 500 li distant, is Huo clion, the same place which at the time of the T'ang was called Kao cliang, and also Yi cliou}^ West
of Kao cli ang, 3000 or 4000 li distant, is the city of Wu-diian, which is the same as the realm of Yil fien of the T'ang dynasty. There is a river there in which is found white and black yil stone (jade).^* At a distance of more than a thousand li, after having
that in the twelfth century one degree of latitude was reckoned at 338 li.
Thus an English mile, according to this calculation, 13 = 489 li. It is therefore difficult to value exactly the length of the li in ancient Chinese itineraries, all the more as the estimates of distances in Chinese narratives of journeys in general are very arbitrary. The Chinese text implies that by Han hai an inland sea is to be understood. But there is probably an error, due to the abbreviation of the original account, for farther on in the text it is said that the traveller crossed the Han hai (and, no doubt, not in a boat). It is difficult to say what sea or lake, with an island in it, is meant. There are many lakes in these regions. Lun t'ai is mentioned in the Tsien Han shu, chap, xcvi., before our era, as a Chinese military colony in the Si yii, west of Yen Tci, 680 li distant. Yen ki is generally believed to answer to the present Kharashar in Eastern Turkestan. Father Hyacinth identifies Lun t'ai with the present Hughur. The author is right in identifying Huo-clwu or Karahhodjo with ancient Kao cliang, but he errs with regard to Yi chou ; for this place at the time of the T'ang was the same as Yi wii, lu of the Han (Hou Han shu, chap, cxviii.), or the present Hami. Wang Yen te, a Chinese envoy, who went to Kao cliang at the end of the tenth century, passed through Yi chou, and then proceeding westward, he mentions several places before he arrived at Kao cliang (see the translation of his narrative in Stan. Julien's "Melanges de Geographic Asiatique, " p. 90-92). The author who abbreviated Ch'u tsai's narrative probably made a mistake, or omitted some characters. ^* Yii t'ien has for a long time been recognised by A. Remusat as answering to the Khotan of the Mohammedan authors (see his "Histoire de la Ville de Khotan"). Yu f ien is mentioned in the Tsien Han shu, chap, xcvi., two centuries before our era. Khotan is evidently intended by the Wuduan of our Chinese traveller. In the Yiian shi the name is spelt 0-duan; and on an ancient Chinese map of the fourteenth century (see part iii.) we find it more correctly rendered by Hu fan.

crossed the Han liai,^^ one arrives at the city of Bu la}^ South of this city is the Yin shan mountain, which extends from east to west a thousand li, and from north to south 200 li}'^ On the top of the mountain is a lake, which is seventy or eighty li in circumference. The country south of the lake is overgrown with lin Tcin trees, which form such dense forests, that the sunbeams cannot penetrate.^^ After leaving the Yin shan one arrives at the city of A-li-ma}^ The Western people call a lin Uin (crab-apple) a-li-ma^^ and as all the orchards around the city abound in apple trees, the city received this name. Eight or nine other cities and towns are subject to A-li-ma
:
in that country grapes and pears abound, j The people cultivate the five kinds of grain, as we do in China. West of A-li-ma there is a large river which is called I-lie?'^
The traveller, after having spoken of several places situated to the south of his road, continues his itinerary. '^^ Bula is evidently the city of Pulad mentioned by Rashid-eddin, the Phulad in Haithon's itinerary, not far from the Sairam lake, the Bolat of Rubruquis. For further details, see Part III., explanation of the ancient Chinese map of the fourteenth century, on which this place appears as P'u-la. This city was probably situated in the valley of the river Borotala of our maps. ^'^ By Yin shan here the author means the Borohlioro or Talki mountains, a branch of the T'ien shan, stretching in a north-westerly direction north of Kuldja. Compare notes 4 and 52. The lake on the top of the mountain is evidently the Sairam lake. Lin Icin in Chinese is a small apple. Generally the wild apple (crabapple) is designated by this name. Przewalsky notices the great abundance of apple and apricot trees in a wild state in the T'ien shan mountains, especially on the northern slope, producing excellent fruit. In autumn the soil in the forests is covered with these fruits (see his travels to the Lop-nor, &c., 1876, in "Peterm. geogr. Mitth.," Erg. heft liii. p. 2) Dr. A. Kegel (" Gartenflora," 1877) speaks also of the abundance of wild apple trees yielding relishable small red apples in the mountains north of Kuldja [Pyrus prunifolia, Willd.). Excellent apples are also cultivated in the neighbourhood of Kuldja. A-li-ma-li is without any doubt the Almalih of the Persian authors of the thirteenth century ; situated, it seems, not far from modern Kuldja. For further particulars see Part III., sub Almalik, and note 172. Alma, in fact, means "apple" in the Kirghiz and other Turkish languages. '^^ This is the river Hi, which runs through the Chinese province of the B

Farther on, west of this river, is the city of Hu-sz'-wo
lu-do, the capital of the Si Liao. Several tens of cities are subject to it.^^ Several hundred li west of Hu-sze-wo-lu-do is the city of Torla-sz?'^ From this place 400 li and more to the
same name, and discharges into the Balkash lake. It is mentioned by this very name in the T'ang shu as early as the seventh century. In the
account the T'ang history gives of the Si Tu hiie or Western Turks, it is stated that they were divided into two hordes, one of them east of the I-li river, the other west of it. The Persian authors of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries also mention this river. According to Rashid-eddin (d'Ohsson, ii. 353), the prince Algu, grandson of Chagtai, had his residence on the river Bile. The Mesalek alahsar, written in the first half of the fourteenth century, and translated by Quatremere ( "Notices et Extraits," &c., XIII., i. p. 230), speaks of the river^//a on the eastern boundary of Mavaran-nahar (Transoxiana). 22 The Si Liao, or Western Liao, are the Karahhitai of the Persian authors. The empire of Karakhitai was founded by a prince of the K'itan or Liao dynasty, who escaped with a body of followers from Northern China, on the overthrow of that dynasty by the Kin in A.D. 1 125. This chief, called by the Cliinese Ye lii To. shi, conquered the whole of Eastern and Western Turkestan, and even Khovarezm. Rashid-eddin states that the capital of the Karakhitai was Belasagun (probably the same word as the Mongol halgasun, meaning "city"). The Chinese authors call it Hu-sz-wo-lu-do. The three last characters of the name, wo-lu-do, written also wa-r-do, are intended for ordo, or residence of the Khan. Hosun in Manchu means " strength." Perhaps hu-sz' had a similar meaning in the language of the K'itan, who, as is known, belonged to the same Tungusic stock as the Manchus. According to the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, the capital of the Karakhitai was on the OKui river, the Chu of our maps. For further details on the Karakhitai, see Part II. This empire was destroyed in 1208 by Guchluk, the son of the last Khan of the Naimans. Guchluk was slain by the Mongols in 1218. Thus the empire of the Karakhitai did not exist when Ch'u-tsai passed through these regions. ^3 The name of a place, Talas, in Turkestan, occurs as early as the sixth century in the Byzantine annals, in connection with the account of an embassy sent by the Emperor Justin in a.d. 569 to the Khan of the Turks in Central Asia (Yule's " Cathay," clxv.). About sixty years later, the Chinese pilgrim Hiian ts'ang, on his way from China through Central Asia to India, passed the city of Ta-lo-sz\ For further particulars on this part of his journey and other Chinese notices found in the T'ang annals about Talas, see note 584. The Mohammedan authors call the same city Taras. This name is frequently met with in the ancient history of Persia. See J. de Mohl's " Livre des Rois " (Shahnameh). To Ibn Khurdadbih (ninth century) and Ibn Haukal (tenth century) Taras was known as an important trading

south-west are the cities of K'u-djan, JBa-p'to, K'o-san,
and Ba-lan?-^ K'u djan abounds in pomegranates. They are as large as two fists and of a sour-sweet taste. People take from
place between Moliammedans and Turks. Edrisi (twelfth century), Abulfeda, Ibn Batuta (thirteenth and fourteenth century), and other Arabian geographers and travellers, mention Taras as a city of Turkestan ^distant from the Oxus twenty-two or twenty-three days' journey, according to Isstakhri and Edrisi). Rashid-eddin reports that in A.d. 12 10 Mohammed of Kharezm defeated the army of the Karakhitai near Taras. Rubruk in the narrative of his journey (1253) mentions the city of Talas on his way to Mongolia ; but he was not himself there. He was told, when proceeding from the Volga to Cayalic, that the city of Talas, situated in the vicinity of mountains, was distant six days' journey from the route he followed. He speaks of some Germans, who, as he had heard, were living in Talas (Rubruk, p. 280, 279). In 1255, Haithon^ king of Little Armenia, passed through Talas on his homeward journey from Mongolia. He saw there Hulagu, the brother of Mangu Khan. Now-a-days a place bearing the name of Talas or Taras does not exist. Sultan Baber, who wrote his Memoirs in the beginning of the sixteenth century, in his account of Ferghana, there speaks of Taras-Jcand as a city which had been destroyed before his time by the Mongols and Uzbeks, As to the site of ancient Taras, we can only conclude, from the scarce accounts about it left by Persian and Chinese authors, that this city was situated on the road from Samarkand to Almalik, or more precisely, between Sairam (near the present Chimkent) and Belasagun (on the river Chu). Meyendorff, on the map appended to his " Voyage d'Orembourg k Boukhara" (1820), places ancient Taras, arbitrarily it seems, at the present city of Turkestan (about twenty-three miles east of the Syr-daria) ; and by this error he misled d'Ohsson (see the map appended to his history of the Mongols), Vivien de St. Martin (see his geographical notes appended to Stan. Julien's "Mem. s. 1. Contrees Occid."), and others. There can be no doubt now that ancient Taras or Talas was situated on the river in Russian Turkestan bearing up to this time the name of Talas, and which the post-road from Tashkand to Vernoye crosses at Aulie-ata. Valikhanow who visited the latter place in 1858, does not hesitate to identify it with ancient Taras (" Memoirs of the Russ. Geogr. Soc," 1861). Schuyler, in his "Turkestan," ii, p. 120, is also of opinion that Aulie-ata lies probably near the site of ancient Taras, Further particulars regarding Taras may be found in Quatremere's
"Notices et Extraits," &c,, XIII., i. p, 224, note, —in P, Lerch's "Archeol.
Journey to Turkestan," 1867 (in Russian), —and in Dr. Max Schmidt's valuable article on the journey of Rubruk (" Zeitsch. d. Gesellsch. f. Erdkunde," 1885, p. 194 seqq.).
^ The author mentions some cities in Ferghana. The first is Khodjend on the Syr-daria. K'o-san is Kasan, mentioned by Ibn Haukal (tenth century) as an important city of Ferghana (Abulfeda, ii. p. 226). At

thirst.25 Around the city of Ba-lan there are everywhere ha-lan gardens ; hence the name (see note 24). The blossoms of the ha-lan tree resemble those of the apricot, only they are a little paler. The leaves are like the leaves of the peach tree, but a little narrower and smaller. The blossoms appear in winter, the fruit ripens in summer.^^ In JBa-pu are large water-melons, weighing fifty pounds each. A long-eared (i.e., a donkey) can only carry two of them at the same time. North-west of K'u-djan (Khodjend) there is the city of 0-ta-la. More than ten other cities are subject to it One time the chief of this place ordered several envoys (of Chinghiz), and several hundreds of merchants (who were with them), to be put to death, and seized upon their goods. That was the cause of the army being directed against the Western people.^^
the time of Sultan Baber (Memoirs) it was an unimportant place. It is marked on modern maps of Ferghana to the north-west of Namangan. Ba-lan may be identified with Kandi-hadam (almond-town), which, according to Baber, was famed for its almonds. He places it east of Khodjend. Indeed, on the Russian map of Ferghana I find a place marked Kanyladam between Kokand and Khodjend. Ba-lan in the Chinese text is misspelt for la-dan, as the Chinese materia medica renders the Persian name for almond (see note 26). I am not prepared to sa}^ what place is meant by Ba pu, but there must have been a city of a similar name in Ferghana, for my Chinese mediaeval map (see Part III.) marks a place Ba-hu between K'o-san (Kasan) and Ma-rh-i-nang (Marghinan). -5 See Baber's Memoirs. He praises the excellency of the pomegranates of Khodjend. 2^ This is a tolerably correct description of the almond tree, which, as is known, resembles much the peach tree ; only the fruit is diff'erent. The almond tree is not found in China, but the Pen tsao kang mu, a Chinese materia medica and natural history of the sixteenth century, gives (book xxix. fol. 10) a good description of it under the name of ha-dan king or ha-dan apricot, and states that it grows in the country of the Mohammedans. See also note 204. 0-ta-la is the ancient city of Otrar in Transoxiana. According to P. Lerch ('* Archeol. Journey to Turkestan," 1867), its ruins can still be

They have gold and copper coins, but their coins are not provided with a hole, nor have they rims (as the Chinese copper coins have). Around the city, to an extent of several tens of li, there are everywhere orchards, groves, flower gardens, aqueducts, running springs, square basins, and round ponds, in uninterrupted succession; indeed, Siin-sz'-kan is a delicious place ! The water-melons there are as large as a horse's head. Eegarding grain and vegetables, however, the shic, the no, and the ta tou are not found there.^^ It does not rain there in summer.

Ch"u ts'ai, in his statement about the cause of the war with Khovarezm, agrees perfectly with the Persian authors. Gairkhan Inaldjuk, governor of Otrar, had killed Chinghiz Khan's envoys, sent along with a numerous caravan of merchants to Mohammed of Khovarezm (d'Ohsson, i. 206) See also note 487. 28 Mistake for south-west. The indications of the directions and distances in this account are often erroneous. -9 Siin-sz'-kan is evidently intended for Semiscant. Colonel Yule, in his " Cathay," &c., p. 192, has proved that this was an ancient name for Samarlcand. At least the Nestorian bishops in the Middle Ages termed this city Semiscant. Besides this, we learn from Clavijo that Samarkand was also called Cimesquinte. The etymological notice of the Chinese author with respect to this name of Samarkand seems to be perfectly correct. Semiz, in all the languages of Turkish origin, means "fat." Kand, as is known, in Persian means a village, a town. See also note 827. The shu is a glutinous variety of the common millet {Panicum miliaceum) cultivated in China. No is the glutinous rice peculiar to Eastern Asia, as is also the ta-tou or Soy bean {Soja hispida). Ch'u ts'ai saw the black mulberry tree {Morus nigra), which is very common in Persia and Transoxiana. It is indeed not fit for feeding the silkworm. 2^ This seems to be the name of a stuff, probably cotton. Kassam is an Arabic name for cotton (see Ibn Beithar's "Mat. Med.," transl. by Son

West of Siin-sz'-kan (Samarkand) six to seven hundred li is the city of F'u hua}^ It abounds in every kind of products, and is richer than Samarkand. There is the residence of the so-li-t*an of the Mou-su-lu-man (Mussulman) people. The cities of K'u-djan (Khodjend) and 0-ta-la (Otrar), and others, all depend on P'u hua. West of Bokhara there is a great river (the Amu-daria), flowing to the west, which enters a sea.^^ West of this
river is the city of U-li-ghien, where the mother of the

tlieimer, ii. 304), Now-a-days cotton is called guza in Turkestan (Kostenko's *' Turkestan," iii. 30). ^3 As is well known, the Chinese consider white as the mourning colour. ^•^ Bokhara, which at the time here spoken of belonged to Mohammed, Sultan of Khovarezm, whose residence was Urghenj. But he often resided also in Bokhara, and was, according to Rashid-eddin, in the latter city just when Chinghiz appeared in Transoxiana. 23 It is now a well-established fact that tlie Amu-daria or Oxus formerly flowed into the Caspian Sea. According to Abulghazi, who lived in the first half of the seventeenth century, the change of the course of this river from the Caspian to the Aral took place in a.d. 1575. Mas'udi, however, who lived in the ninth and tenth centuries, as well as Abulfeda in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, both agree in stating clearly (Mas'., i. p. 211 ; Abulf., ii. p. 209) that the Djihun or Oxus discharges itself into the lake of Khovarezm or Aral. P. Lerch, in his valuable article on Khiva or Khovarezm (1873), comes to the conclusion that the Oxus in ancient times flowed into the Aral, as now-a-days. It was, according to Lerch, only towards the end of the fourteenth century that this river carved itself a new road to the Caspian Sea. But since the year 1575 the Oxus falls again into the Aral. I may, however, observe that Arab Shah, who died 1450, states, I. cap. 45, that the Jihun or Oxus discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. 2^ U-li-ghien is Urghendj, the ancient capital of Khovarezm. In the days of Chinghiz it stood, according to Rashid, on both banks of the Oxus, with a bridge connecting them (d'Ohsson, i. 267). The Mongols destroyed the city in 1221, but it recovered subsequently, and does still exist. It is called Kunia (ancient) Urghendj, to distinguish it from Yeni (new) Urghendj, the present commercial capital of Khiva, north-east of the city of Khiva, near the western border of the Amu-daria. Kunia Urghendj is situated about ninety miles north-west of New Urghendj, and is twenty-seven miles west of the present channel of the Amu-daria.

The above name, at the time of the T'ang, evidently referred to a tribe in Siberia, for the T'ang historians state that they are a nomadic people living north of the Han hai (see note 9). The po ho plant grows in their country. They have excellent horses, with heads like camels. This country is very far from the Chinese capital. It is bounded on the north by the sea. Proceeding from the Han hai northward, one will observe that the days become long and the nights short. After sunset one has no time to roast a sheep's liver till the sun rises again. What people are meant by Ku-li-han cannot be investigated. We know nothing regarding the history of Siberia at so early a period. As to the plant po ho, which is often mentioned in the T'ang history as produced in Northern Mongolia, this is Lilium spectabile, Link., the bulbs of which are much eaten by the Mongols and the tribes of Southern Siberia ; a fact noticed already by Pallas in the last century, and confirmed by modern travellers. Po ho, in China, is a general name for lily.

PEI SHI KI.
Pei sm KI, or "Notes on an Embassy to the North," is the title of a short account of an envoy of the Kin emperor sent to Chinghiz Khan. The northern dynasty or the Mongol court is meant. But as Chinghiz, at that time, had left Mongolia and waged war in Western Asia, the envoy, in reality, travelled not to the north, but to the
west. This narrative is of little importance, and hardly repays the trouble spent in searching it out in the Chi pu tsu chai tsung sJm (already mentioned), a bulky Chinese work of more than 30,000 pages, containing a very large number of small articles on different matters, collected, as is usually the case in Chinese books, without any system and without a detailed index. The Pei shi ki is found there as chapter xiv. of the Kid tsien chi, a book written by Zm KH in 1295, and treating of different matters re
garding the Kin dynasty (see Wylie's "Notes on Chin. Lit.," 159). But Liu K'i is not the author of the Pei shi ki; he must have reproduced it from another book. This is proved by the statement of the author of the article, that he himself knew the envoy who returned from the West in 1222, and that he took down the report from his account. The name of the aforesaid envoy of the Kin emperor is Wu-Jcu-sun^^ Chung tuan. His biography is found in the
Uksun was the family name of the descendants of the imperial house of the Kin. Now a days uksun in Manchu means " race, family." As is known, the Kin or Niichi belonged to the same stock as the Manchus.

Kin shi, or history of the Kin dynasty, chap, cxxiv., and his mission to Chinghiz is there also shortly recorded. Chinghiz, who at first was tributary to the Kin, in 1 2 1
1
had withdrawn his allegiance, and made his first irruption into Northern China. He ravaged the provinces of the Kin empire to the Yellow Eiver. Chung tu (the present Peking), the residence of the Kin emperor, was taken by the Mongol armies in 12 15. Whilst Chinghiz turned his arms to Western Asia, one of his generals, the famous Mukuli,^^ continued the war in China with the greatest success. The Kin emperor, in his distress, resolved to despatch an envoy to the great conqueror to solicit peace. This was the subject of Wu-ku-sun's mission. In his narrative nothing is reported regarding his diplomatic negotiations, but his audience with Chinghiz in the country of the Mohammedans and the discourse he had with the emperor are recorded in the Yuan shi, as well as in the T'ung kien kang mu {vide p. 33). The anonymous author of the Pei shi ki records the report of the envoy as follows :

In the seventh month (August) of the year 1220, Wuku-sun Chung tuan, vice-president of the Board of Eites, was entrusted by the emperor {U-tio-lu of the Kin dynasty) with a mission to the northern court. An T'ing chen, secretary in the Academy, was appointed his assistant. Wu-kn-sun returned in the tenth month (October or November) of 1221,^^ when he addressed me in the followincr terms :

o
I have been sent a distance of ten thousand li west of the border of heaven, and not wishing all the curious things I saw in my travels to remain unrecorded, I therefore request you to write down my narrative.
Thus the Mohammedan authors call him. The Yiian shi spells the name Mu-hua-li. This seems to be an erroneous date for his return. In the narrative of Ch'ang ch'un's journey [vide p. 72) it is stated that they met the envoy of the Kin on his way back, west of the Talas river, on the 13th of the tenth month of 122 1. In Wu-ku-sun's biography, the twelfth month (January 1222) is given as the time of his return to China.

In the hvelfth month (January) of 1220 I passed the northern frontier (of the Kin empire), and proceeded in a north-western direction, where the ground rises gradually. Advancing parallel with (the northern frontier of) the Hia empire/*^ after having travelled seven or eight thousand li, I arrived at a mountain. East of it all rivers flow to the east; west of it they run to the west, and the ground gradually descends>^ Farther on, after travelling four to five thousand li, the climate becomes very hot. I passed through more than a hundred cities ; not one of them had a Chinese name. Inquiring about the country, I was told that many tribes were living there, namely, the Mo-li-hi,
*® At the time in question there was a Tangut dynasty, Hia, reigning over the present Ordos and Kansu, 982-1227, In Wn-ku-sun's biography the following account of his journey is given :

" Wu-ka-sun and his assistant, An Ting chen, received orders to set out to the Mongol coui't in order to sue for peace. (On their road) they fell in with the first councillor Mu-hua-li (the commander-in-chief of the Mongol army in China. See note 44). An T'ing chen was then retained (by Mu-hua-li), and Wu-ku-sun continued his journey alone. He proceeded along the northern border of the Hia empire {vide note 46), crossed the Liu sha desert, passed over the Tsung ling mountains, arrived in the Si yii (Western countries), and was presented to the emperor (Chinghiz)." Liu sha, in the above passage, means literally "moving sand." According to ancient and modern Chinese accounts, this desert is situated west of the well-known Chinese barrier Yii men Jcuan (in Kan su). This name liu sha appears already in the Chinese classics (Shu king, Tribute of Yii). Przewalsky on his road to Lake Lob-nor, in 1877, mentions this " moving sand." By the name of Tsung ling (onion-mountains) the Chinese, since the time of the Han dynasty (second century b. c), understand the high mountain chain which separates Eastern Turkestan (Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, &c.) from Western Turkestan (Kokand and the land on the laxartes and Oxus). The passage in Wu-ku-sun's account about the rivers flowing east and west of the Tsung ling is borrowed from the Han history. It would seem, therefore, that the route followed by Wu-ku-sun lay south of the T'ien shan mountains (as the way is described by M. Polo). This supposition, however, would be in contradiction with the further account of Wu-ku-sun's journey, where he enumerates a number of tribes and nations who almost all lived north of the T'ien shan. The statements in his narrative are so vague, and the distances given so exaggerated, that it is difficult to draw any conclusion. But it is certain that he returned by the route north of the T'ien shan. See also note 73.

the Mo-h'o-li, the Ro-li-hi-sz\ the Nai-man, the Hang-li, the Gui-gu, the T'u-ma, and the Ho-lu ; all are barbarian
tribes. Farther on I travelled over several tens of thousands of li, and arrived at the city of I-li in the country of the Hui-ho. There is the residence of the king of (or of a king of) the Hui-ho}^ We were then in the first decade of the fourth month (beginning of May). The empire of Ta-shi, or the great K'i-tan, was formerly in the middle of the country of the Hui-ho (Mohammedans). Ta-shi Lin-ma belonged to the people of the Liao}^ Tai tsu liked him for his intelligence and eloquence, and gave him a princess as wife.^^ But Ta-shi secretly bore the emperor ill-will. At the time the emperor moved his arms to the west, Ta-shi was at first with him, but afterwards he took his family and fled beyond the mountains (probably Altai). Then he assembled the tribes on the frontier and emigrated to the north-west. On their wanderings they rested at places abounding in water and pastures. After several years they arrived at
^s AH these names can be identified when comparing them with the names of tribes in Mongolia and Central Asia in the days of Chinghiz Khan, as mentioned by Rashid-eddin (d'Ohsson, i. 423 &eqq.). The Mo-li-lii are probably the Merhits {Mie-li-H in the Yiian shi) ; the Mo-Tco-li may be the Mekrins. The Ho-li-ki-sz are the Kirghiz. Regarding the Naiman, see note 98. The Hang-li (in the Yiian shi the name is spelled Hang-li, but more frequently K'ang-li) are the Kankalis of the Persian authors. The name Gui-gu is probably intended for Uigur. The T'u-ma are the Tumats of Rashid, and the Ho-lu, finally, the Karluks {Ha-la-lu in the Yiian shi). I repeat that the distances given by "Wu-ku-sun must not be taken au serieux. I am not prepared to decide what place he means by I-li. There was a city Ili-balik, probably on the Hi river. But more likely the author means Eri or Heri, now-a-days called Herat {vide infra, note 684). By Hui-ho the Chinese in the seventh and eighth centuries understood the Uigurs, which name subsequently was used to designate the Mohammedans in general {vide Part II.). 50 See note 22, and the article on the Karakhitai in Part II. 51 The author can only mean T'ai tsu or Aguta, the first emperor of the Kin dynasty, 1115-1123. See Part II., article on the Karakhitai, and note 567.

the Yin shan inountain,^^ 13^^ could not penetrate owing to the rocks and the snow. They were obliged to leave their carts behind, and to carry their baggage on camels. Thus they arrived in the country of the Hui-ho (Mohammedans), took possession of the land and founded an empire. From day to day Ta-shi's power increased; he reigned some thirty years and more, and after death was canonised as Te tsimg. When he died his son succeeded. The latter was canonised as Jen tsung. After his death, his younger sister, by name Kan, took charge of the regjencv ; but as she held illicit intercourse and killed her husband, she was executed. Then the second son of Jen tsung came to the throne. Owing to his appointing unworthy officers, the empire fell into decay, and was finally destroyed by the Hui-ho. At the present day there are few of these people left, and they have adopted the customs and the dress of the Hui-ho.^^ The empire of the Hui-ho (Mohammedans) is very vast and extends far to the west. In the fourth or fifth month (May, June) there the grass dries up, as in our country in winter. The mountains are covered with snow even in the hottest season of the year. When the sun rises it
becomes hot, but as soon as it sets it gets cold. In the sixth month (July) people are obliged to use wadded coverlets.^* There is no rain in summer; it is only in autumn that it begins to fall. Then the vegetation shoots forth ; and in winter the plains become green like our country in spring, and herbs and trees are in blossom.
^- The Borokhoro or Talki mountains, north of Kuldja. See note 17. It is all the more probable that Ta-shi passed by this way to Transoxiana, as the Persian authors state that the Karakhitai before entering Turkestan founded a city on the Imil river (north-east of these mountains). Comp. d'Ohsson, i. 442. ^2 A more detailed account of the Western Liao or Karakhitai is given in the History of the Liao dynasty, a translation of which will be found in Part II. Wu-ku-sun, in his report, has some statements regarding the Karakhitai not found in the Liao history. ^4 Wu-ku-sun speaks probably of the climate in the Hindukush. He presented himself to Chinghiz somewhere in those mountains.

The people (of the Hui-ho) have thick beards, the hair of which is entangled like sheep's wool, and of different
colour, black or yellow in different shades.^^"^ Their faces are almost entirely covered by hair ; only the nose and the eyes can be seen. All their customs are very strange. There are the following kinds of Hui-ho
:

The Mu-su-lu-man Hui-lio (Mussulman) are very bloodthirsty and greedy. They tear flesh with the fingers and swallow it.^^ Even in the time of Lent they eat meat and drink wine. The Hui-ho of I-li^'^ are rather weak and delicate ; they do not like to kill, and do not eat flesh when they fast. There are further the Hui-ho of Yin-du (Hindustan), who are black and of good character. Many other things could be reported about these people (of the Hui-ho). The chiefs there choose their servants amongst the black and vilest class of the people of Yin-du^ and mark their faces by burning. The people are all living
in cities ; there are no villages. The roofs of their houses are covered with clay.^^ All the woodwork in the houses is carved. They use white glass for their windows and
for vessels. The country is very rich in silver, pearls, cotton, hemp, &c. Their arrows, bows, carts, clothes, armour, spears, and vessels are all of strange appearance. They use large bricks for building bridges.^^ Their boats
^5 The statement is perfectly correct. The Persians even now-a-days use to dye the hair of their beards with henna (the powdered leaves of Lawsonia inermis, also of the Balsamine), which produces an orange colour. If afterwards indigo is applied, the hair becomes quite black. But a great part of the men prefer the orange colour for their beards. It is the custom up to this time, with the Mohammedans in Persia, not to use knives or forks at their meals. They tear the flesh with their fingers. The Chinese never take any meat with their fingers, but use the so-called chopsticks. 5^ The name I-li occurs here for the second time in this narrative, although it was rendered above by other characters. See note 49. As is well known, even now-a-days the flat roofs in Western Asia are covered with clay. The roofs of Chinese houses are covered with roof-tiles. The Chinese bridges are built of large square stones.

There are water-melons weighing sixty pounds. The apples there are very prettily coloured. The onions and melons are also very fine and fragrant. As regards animals, camels are found there, but they have only one hump.^^ The oxen there have a hump on their neck.^^ Their sheep have
large tails.^^ There are also lions, elephants, peacocks,
buffaloes, and wild asses.^* There are snakes with four legs.^^ There is also a dangerous insect which resembles a spider : when it bites a man he cries out and dies.^^ In those countries there is a great variety of beasts, birds,
fish, insects, &c., not found in China.
There is a hill (or mountain) called T a-li-sz -han. It has an extent of fifty or sixty li, and appears like a green
screen, being covered with forests of hui trees.^^ At the
foot of the hill is a spring.^^ The people are dressed simply. The flaps of their coats
have not right and left ; all wear girdles. Their clothes, cushions, and coverlets, are all made from wool. This wool grows in the ground.^^ Their food consists of liu ping

For writing they use reeds.^^ At their funerals they never use coffins or sarcophagi. In burying the dead they always put the head towards the west. Their priests do not shave their
heads. In their temples no images or statues are seen. It is only in the cities of Huo choii and Sha chou'^^ that statues are found in the temples (of the Mohammedans ?) as in China. There they recite also Buddhist books written in Chinese letters. The language of the sacred books of the Hui-ho is unintelligible to the Chinese.
(After Wu-ku-sun had finished his report), / {i.e., the author of the article) said to him : Your journey indeed is an extraordinary fact. Anciently, in the time of the Han dynasty, Chang K'ien and Su Wu"'^ were entrusted with missions to far countries. They returned after several years, having endured much suffering, and risked their lives.

Schuyler ("Turkestan," i. i88) writes : "In Tashkend embroidery is a trade practised chiefly by the men." Evidently an old practice.

The Hiung-nu, after in vain attempting to induce him to turn traitor, banished him to the Pei hai (northern sea, or Lake Baikal), where he was tending sheep for many years. Pinally the Emperor Wu ti succeeded in delivering his faithful minister, who subsequently acquired a great popularity amongst the Chinese. 75 An allusion to Wu-ku-suu's mission to Chinghiz to sue for peace.

your mind did not falter ; and it is remarkable that your face bears no token of fatigue. It is because from youth up your heart has been full of devotion to the throne; and thus you were able to travel amongst the barbarians as gaily as if you had not left home. You have preserved your life and your honour, and your bold feat has made a great sensation amongst your contemporaries. Indeed, you are a glorious man ; and it is with great pleasure that I undertake to write your report for the benefit of future
historians.
As Wu-ku-sun in his report says nothing regarding his audience with the Mongol emperor, I may be allowed to translate, for the sake of completeness, from the Ytian shi, what I have found there on this subject. In the annals
there, sub anno 1221,^'^ it is stated :

In this year the Kin emperor despatched Wu-ku-sun Chung tuan to Chinghiz with a letter, in which he begged for peace. He agreed to be the emperor's younger brother {i.e., his vassal), but made the condition to retain the title of emperor.
Sub anno 1221, ibidem, we read:—In autumn Wu-kusun was presented to Chinghiz in the country of the Hui-ho (Mohammedans).^^ The emperor said to him : " I formerly asked of your sovereign to cede the land north of the Yellow Eiver, and to reign over the country south of it with the title of wang (king). On these conditions I would have suspended the war. But now Muhua-li (see note 44) has already conquered all these countries, and you are compelled to sue for peace." Wu-kusun then implored the emperor to have pity. Chinghiz replied : " It is only in consideration of the great distance you have come that I can be indulgent. The land north

Cha'ng ch UN (family name KHu) was a Taoist monk of great repute for wisdom and sanctity. He w^as born A.D. 1 148, in Si Ilia, a city belonging to the department of Teng chou fu, in Shan tung. In the beginning of the thirteenth century he was held in great respect at the courts of the Kin and the SungP Chinghiz, after his invasion of Northern China, heard of the great sage, and sent him a flattering invitation to come to his court. In the meanwhile, the Mongol chief undertook his expedition to Western Asia, and Ch'ang ch'un was obliged, notwithstanding his advanced age, to abandon his recluse life in the mountains of Shan tung, and expose himself to the dangers of a long journey through Central Asia to Persia and the frontiers of India, where he met the great conqueror. The journey there and back occupied three years, 1221-24. The Si yii lei was not written by Ch'ang ch'un himself, but by Li Chi cJCang, one of his disciples, who accompanied him and kept a diary of the journey. Another admirer of the sage, Sun si, published it, and wrote a preface, which is dated 1228. The Si yu ki is indued in the Tao tsang tsi yao, a great collection of Taoist works. It is also found in the Zien

yun yi tiling shu, a collection of reprints published in 1848 "by Yang, a learned Chinese in Peking.^^ This account of Ch'ang chain's travels has been translated in extenso into Eussian by the late Archimandrite Palladius, and was published, in 1866, in the fourth volume of the " Eecords of the Pekin Eccles. Mission." Another translation of the Si yu ki was made into French by the late M. Pauthier in 1867. But Pauthier translated only a short and very bad extract of the narrative as found in the Hai kuo t\t chi, a Chinese geographical work treating of foreign countries, and published in 1844. Besides this, his translation contains so many mistakes, that the whole
article becomes unintellif^ible.
The translation of the Si yu ki which I give in the following pages is not such a complete one as that of Arch. Palladius. I have omitted all the numerous poems composed by Chang chun on different occasions during his journey, as well as some conversations on Taoist matters. In some instances I give only a resum4 of the
narrative, when of little interest. Bat all relatiniT to history and geography is faithfully rendered and accompanied with such notes and commentaries as my acquaintance with the subject permits. But before entering upon the subject, let me record
here an interesting ancient document — the correspondence between Chinghiz and Ch'ang ch'un, preserved in the Cho keng lu, a Chinese work written in about the middle of the fourteenth century. See chap, x., article KHu chen jen (K'iu, the man of the truth). The translation of these letters will enable the reader to form a judgment of the character and mode of thought of those illustrious men. Chinghiz, in his simplicity, professes such sound principles of governing people, and his words express such profound truths, that they would be valid even in our days
80 The same collection contains also the Si yil hi, or " Records of the Western World," by Hiien Thsang, translated by Stan. Julien in his "Memoires sur les Contr^es Occideutales," 1858.

and for our countries in Europe. On the other side, Ch'ang ch'un inspires sympathy by his modesty, candour, and sincerity. He seems to have been endowed with high intelligence, knowing well his time and human nature. This was the reason that Chinghiz, who was about to include Northern China in his empire, laid such great stress upon his advice. But there was yet another reason for which the Mongol chief was impatient to make the sage's acquaintance. According to Palladius, Ch'ang ch'un belonged to the Northern Taoist school, to the sect of " the golden lotus," the professors of which called themselves tsuan chen, "the perfect, true, and sainted men." They were all adepts in spiritual alchemy, i.e., they looked in the spiritual world for the tan or philosopher's stone, the secret of immortality, &c., which mysteries had been vainly searched after for centuries by material alchemists. One of the first questions Chinghiz addressed to Ch'ang cliun at his first audience was, " Have you a medicine of immortality ? " It is a curious fact that Chinghiz and Ch'ang cKun died in the same year and in the same month, -i.e., in the seventh month of 1227. With reference to Chinghiz' letter addressed to Ch'ang ch*un, I need not mention that it was not written by himself ; he could not write in any language. Evidently the ideas of the conqueror were taken down by a Chinese in
his suite, very likely by Ye-lil CIiu tsai, his able minister. This letter, which is written in a classical Chinese style, reads as follows :

" Heaven has abandoned China owing to its haughtiness and extravagant luxury. But I, living in the northern wilderness, have not inordinate passions. I hate luxury and exercise moderation. I have only one coat and one food. I eat the same food and am dressed in the same tatters as my humble herdsmen.^^ I consider the people my

children, and take an interest in talented men as if they were my brothers. We always agree in our principles, and we are always united by mutual affection. At military exercises I am always in the front, and in time of battle am never behind. In the space of seven years I have succeeded in accomplishing a great work, and uniting the whole world in one empire. I have not myself distinguished qualities. But the government of the Kin is inconstant, and therefore Heaven assists me to obtain the throne (of the Kin). The Sung to the south,^^ the Hui
lio to the north,^^ the Hia (see note 46) to the east, and the barbarians in the west, all together have acknowledged my supremacy. It seems to me that since the remote time of our slian yil^^ such a vast empire has not been seen. But as my calling is high, the obligations incumbent on me are also heavy ; and I fear that in my ruling there may be something wanting. To cross a river we make boats and rudders. Likewise we invite sage men, and choose out assistants for keeping the empire in good order. Since the time I came to the throne I have always taken to heart the ruling of my people ; but I could not find worthy men to occupy the places of the three (kung) and the nine (k'ing).^^ With respect to these circumstances I inquired, and heard that thou, master, hast penetrated the truth, and that thou walkest in the path of right. Deeply learned and much experienced, thou hast much explored the laws. Thy sanctity is become manifest. Thou hast conserved the rigorous rules of the ancient sages.

the world; but to thee the people who have acquired sanctity repair, like clouds on the path of the immortals, in innumerable multitudes. I knew that after the war thou hadst continued to live in Shan tung, at the same place, and I was always thinking of thee. I know the stories of the returning from the river Wei in the same cart, and of the invitations in the reed hut three times repeated.^^ But what shall I do ? We are separated by mountains and plains of great extent, and I cannot meet thee. I can only descend from the throne and stand by the side.^^ I have fasted and washed.^^ I have ordered my adjutant, Liu Chimg lu (see note 96), to prepare an

Commiserate the people in the present situation of affairs, or have pity upon me, and communicate to me the means of preserving life. I shall serve thee myself. I hope that at least thou wilt leave me a trifle of thy wisdom. Say only one word to me and I shall be happy. In this letter I have briefly expressed my thoughts, and hope that thou wilt understand them. I hope also that thou, having penetrated the principles of the great tao, sympathisest with all that
is right, and wilt not resist the wishes of the people. "Given on the ist day of the 5th month (May 15), 12 19."
8^ This is an allusion to two examples from Chinese history, that sa^^es had been invited by emperors to occupy high charges. Wen wang, the virtual founder of the Chou dynasty (twelfth century B.C.), found an old man fishing in the Wei river, whose conversation proved so sage that the prince begged him to enter his service as minister, and took him along with him in his cart. The other allusion refers to Chu Ko liang, who was sought out by Liu Pei, the founder of the Shu Han dynasty, whom his fame for wisdom had reached. He was found (a.d. 207) inhabiting a reed hut, and was with difficulty persuaded to abandon his hermit's life. ^'^ Chinghiz proposes to Ch'ang cliun that he should take Chinghiz' place in governing. A Chinese phrase of politeness, meaning that the host has worthily prepared himself to receive the guest. In ancient times, in China, the emperor used to send a cart for the sages when inviting them.

I confess that in worldly matters I am dull, and have not succeeded in investigating the tao, although I tried hard in every possible way. I have grown old and am not yet dead. My repute has spread over all kingdoms; but as to my sanctity, I am not better than ordinary people, and when I look inwards, I am deeply ashamed of myself. Who knows my hidden thoughts ? Before this I have had several invitations from the southern capitaP^ and from the Sung, and have not gone. But now, at the first call of the Dragon court (he means the Mongol court), I am ready. Why ? I have heard that the emperor has been gifted by Heaven with such valour and wisdom as has never been seen in ancient times or in our own days. Majestic splendour is accompanied by justice. The Chinese people as well as the barbarians have acknowledged the emperor's supremacy. At first I was undecided whether I would hide myself in the mountains or flee (to an island) into the sea, but I dared not oppose the order. I decided to brave frost and snow in order to be once presented to the emperor.

old and infirm, and fear that I shall be unable to endure the pains of such a long journey, and that perhaps I cannot reach your majesty ; and even should I reach, I would not be good for anything. Public affairs and affairs of war are not within my capacity. The doctrine of the tao
teaches to restrain the passions ; but that is a very difficnlt
task. Considering these reasons, I conferred with Lm Clmng lit, and asked him that I might wait in Yen or in Te liing (now Pao an chou) the return of your majesty. But he would not agree to that, and thus I myself undertook to lay my case before the emperor. I am anxious to satisfy the desire of your majesty, and to brave frost and snow, wherefore I solicit the decision (whether I shall start or wait). We were four who at the same time became ordained monks. Three have attained sanctity. Only I have undeservedly the repute of a sainted man. My appearance is parched, my body is weak. I am waiting for your majesty's order. "Written in the 3rd month (April) of 1220."
Sun Si, in his preface to the Si yu hi, says :

" Ch'ang ch'un was a man of a high perfection. At the time I attained the age of manhood (I had heard much of him, but) I conceived that this venerable man must long ago have soared up to heaven, and after his transformation lived in the company of the clouds in the high spheres of the universe, and was sorry at not having seen him. But in the winter of the year 12 19 there was suddenly a rumour that the master,^^ who lived near the sea (in Shan tung), was invited (by Chinghiz) to set out on a journey. In the next year, in spring (1220), he arrived indeed at Yen king (Peking), and stayed in the monastery of Yu su kuan. Then I had the satisfaction of seeing him personally. When he sat, his position was immovable, like a dead body ; when he stood upright, he resembled a tree

the wind.^^ From his conversation I learned that he was a man who had seen and heard much. There was no book which he had not read. From day to day I felt an increasing veneration for him. The number of men, attracted by his glory, who solicited the favour of being his disciples, increased every day. When the express (despatched by Chinghiz) arrived for the second time, the master set out for the west. At his departure his disciples asked him when he would return. He said, ' After three years.' This happened in the first month of 1221, and indeed, in the first month of 1224, the master returned from the west after just three years' absence, as he predicted. The master, in his journey to the west, travelled over more than 20,000 li. He saw places which are not laid down on our maps, and which are not moistened by rain or dew. Although he was received everywhere with great honours, the journey was very painful
for him. ]N"evertheless he was always cheerful, liked conversation, and wrote verses. He loved nature in her various aspects. At every place he stopped at, he visited all that was remarkable. As regards his views of life and death, he considered them like warmth and cold, but thoughts about them did not perplex his mind. Could he enjoy such perfections if not penetrated by the tao (true doctrine) ? " Written in 1228, on the 2nd day of the 7th month."
The Chinese text of the >S''^ yu hi begins with a short biography of Ch'ang ch*un, as above related. Then several invitations are referred to which the master received from the courts of the Kin and the Sung, but were refused. In the year 1220, the emperor CKeng-gi-sz (Chinghiz) sent his adjutant Liu Chung hc,^^ with an escort of twenty
All these qualities are considered by the Taoists as marks of a high degree of contemplation and absence of passions. Liu Chung lu was a deserter from the army of the Kin, who entered the service of Chinghiz at the time he invaded Northern China. Chinghiz

Mongols, to Ch'ang ch'un, who then was in Shan tung. Liu Chung lu transmitted to him an invitation from the emperor and a golden tablet, on which an order was written to treat the master in the way the emperor himself was wont to be treated. Chung lu reported that in the fifth month (May, June) of 12 19 he received from the emperor the order to seek the master. The emperor at that time was in the luu-li-do^'^ of the Nai-manP^ Ch'ang ch'un agreed to go with Chung lu, and chose nineteen from among his disciples to accompany him. In the beginning (February) of 1220 they set out for the north, and arrived at Yen (Peking) towards the end of the second month (beginning of April), where the master was received with great homage. In Yen the master was informed that Chinghiz had moved to the west, and he felt apprehensive that his advanced age would not permit of his enduring the fatigue of a long journey. He wished to await the time of Chinghiz' return in order to be presented, and it was resolved to ask the permission of the emperor. There was yet another question which alarmed Ch'ang ch'un. Chung lu, by order of his sovereign, had assembled a number of girls to be brought to the emperor's harem. The master said, " Owing to actresses having been sent from the kingdom of Tsi to the kingdom of Lu, Confucius left Lu (which was his native country). Although I am only a savage of the mountains,^^ how can I travel in the

The Chinese authors assign the same country to them. At the time spoken of (121 9) the Naiman were already subdued, and Chinghiz remained for a time in the ordo of the Khan of the Naiman, where he prepared for his expedition to the west. See note 5 at the end. He left for the west in autumn. 99 Ch'ang ch'un, when speaking of himself, always uses this modest expression.

company of girls ? " In order to lay before the emperor these questions, Chung lu despatched a courier with a report, and the master sent also an address to the emperor. On the 15 th of the fourth month (May 18) 1220, the master with his disciples and Liu kung (see note 96) left Yen (Peking), and travelled to the north. The way led through Ku yung}^^ One night, at the northern exit (of the pass), we met a gang of robbers ; but they bowed and said, " We do not harm the master." In the fifth month (June) we arrived at Te hing}^^ and passed the summer there in the temple of Lung yang kuan.
At the beginning of the winter (1220) A-li-sien arrived, sent by the prince and soon after another envoy came. They invited the master to call upon the prince on his way to the emperor. He made an affirmative sign with his head. In the same month, the courier sent to Chinghiz returned, and brought a letter from the emperor to the master, in which the latter was aiiain invited in the most flattering terms. Chung lu also received a letter, with the imperial order to take the greatest care of the sage. The master then conferring with Chung lu said
:

The Ku yung gate exists still in a defile north of Peking, known to European travellers who visit the great wall at this point by the name of Nan Jcou pass. Nan kou is a village at the southern entrance of the pass. See A. Wylie's article " On an Ancient Buddhist Inscription at Keu yung kwan " {Jour. Hoy. Asiat. Soc, 1870). Now the city of Pao an chou, north-west of Peking, Here Chinghiz' younger brother is meant. In the Yiian shi, where he is often mentioned, his name is spelled O-ch'i-ghin.

At the time that Chinghiz waged war in the west, his brother Udjukin was entrusted with the government of the Mongol empire. He had his territories and residence in the northeastern corner of Mongolia, according to Rashid (d'Ohsson, ii, 7), near Calaltchin alt and the river Olkui (Ulgui on the Russian map).

all things required for such a long journey. Would it not be better to pass the winter in Lung yang kuan, and start in spring?" Chung lu agreed, and so they passed the winter there. On the 8 th of the first month (February i), 1221, we started again. It was a fine day ; the friends of the master brought presents, and standing before his horse, shed tears, and asked him: "Master, you undertake a distant journey of several tens of thousands of li ; when shall we have the happiness of again bowing before you ? " The master replied : " If you will be strong in the faith, I shall meet you again." As the friends pressed the question, he said evasively : " Our staying and our travelling depend not on our own will." But the friends would not desist, and wished a decisive answer. Then the master
said : " I will be back in three years—in three years."
He repeated it twice. On the loth of the first month (February 3, 122 1) we passed the night at Ts2oi ping k'oio}^^ The next day we passed the defile called Ye-lm ling}^^ To the south we saw the T'ai liang ling'^^^ and other mountains. The mountain air was delicious. Towards the north there were only cold sandy deserts and parched grass. Here are the
According to the great Chinese map of China, this is the name of a defile about thirty li west of Kalgan (Chang kia k'ou). ^'^^ Ling in Chmese means " a pass " and also " a ridge of a mountain." The Ye-hu defile or mountain ridge is situated five li north of the Shan fang p'u k'ou, one of the gates in the great wall, next to the west after the gate of Kalgan. See my "Recherches Arch, et Hist, sur Peldn," note 190. In about the middle of the thirteenth century a Chinese traveller, Chang Te hui, went from Peking to Karakorum. The narrative of his journey, which has been preserved, was translated into Russian by Archim. Palladius in the " Memoirs of the Siberian Section of the Ceogr. Soc," 1867. An English version of the same by Schuyler is found in the Geographical Magazine, 1875. Chang Te hui, who in the first part of his journey went by the same way as Ch'ang ch'un, calls this defile 0-hu ling. Ye-hu or 0-hu represent probably a Mongol word.

106 The traveller who proceeds from Peking to Kiakhta has to pass north of Kalgan (a little east of the ancient road followed by Ch'ang ch'un and Chang Te hui) an elevated mountain ridge, and then finds himself on the table-land of Mongolia. Indeed, the change of the climate, vegetation, &c., here is very sudden. My friend Dr. Bushell, in his interesting "Notes of a Journey Outside the Great Wall " (/. R. G. S., vol. xliii.), makes just the same remark as the Chinese author made about 650 years earlier on the sudden change of the climate when entering Mongolia. Compare also Przewalsky ("Mongolia," &c., i. 33): "That range, along the axis of which is carried the Great Wall, and which forms (north of Kalgan) so distinct a definition between the high chilly plateau of Mongolia and the warm plains of China." . . . Ibidem, i. 131 : "On the 6th of May we again stood on that point of the marginal range of Mongolia where the descent to Kalgan commences. Again the great panorama of mountain scenery lay at our feet, the bright green plains of China sparkling like emeralds in the distance. There it is warm and spring-like ; here, on the plateau, Nature was only just waking from her long winter's sleep." '^^'^ It was the place where Chinghiz in 121 1 had vanquished the army of the Kin. This battle at Ye-hu ling is recorded in the annals of the Yiian shi. The southern part of the plateau of Mongolia, north of the Great Wall and in the regions here spoken of, represents a vast plain, treeless, but in summer covered with luxuriant grass and abounding in water. This prairie, the imperial pasture-land, extends west and east to a great distance. To the north, a low ridge of hills separates it from the sterile Gobi desert. In this " pays des herbes," in ancient times, many fortified places were built to prevent the invasion of the wild hordes of Mongolia into China. Fu chou was one of the most important of these places. Ch'ang ch'un, in one of his poems recorded by Palladius, calls it little Yen (Peking). But it seems to have been abandoned or destroyed subsequently, for Chang Te hui, who passed there twenty-seven years later, states that only the wall of Fu chou remained. Ancient Fu chou must be looked for, as Archim. Palladius first determined from his own local observation, in the ruins called Khara balgasun by the Mongols of the present time. Khara balgasun lies on the road from Peking to Kiakhta, about thirty English miles from Kalgan. See also my " Rech. Arch, et Hist. s. Pekin," note 191. 109 Perhaps the lake marked K'o-le hu on modern Chinese maps. Ha and po both mean lake.

It is difiScult to say what lake is meant, for Mongolia is very rich in salt lakes ; but they change often as regards their size or disappear, whilst in other places new lakes arise. This is a rampart in Southern Mongolia, raised by the emperor Madalcu of the Kin dynasty during the time of his reign, called Ming chang, A.D. 1 190-96, and from this the name of the wall is derived. See also Chang Te hui's itinerary, ivfra, note 114. Great Sha t'o. This name, ska t'o, the Chinese apply to certain portions of the Mongolian desert. Slia= "sand," ^'o = dangerous, rugged, uneven. Thus the name may be translated by "sandy downs." It answers perfectly the nature of that desert spoken of. Przewalsky, who went by the same way as Chang ch'un, states ("Mongolia," &c., i, p. 106): " Twenty-seven miles beyond Dolonnor we entered the aimak of Keshikten. From this point of the road a succession of sandy hillocks, called by the natives guchin gurhu, extends as far as the Dalai nor," &c. Przewalsky gives a detailed description of these sand-hills. Marignolli, in the fourteenth century, notices the cyollos kagon, or sand-hills thrown up by the wind, on the northern verge of the Mongolian desert. See Yule's " Cathay," 339. There was, in the seventh and eighth centuries, a tribe of the Western T'u kiie (Turks) called Sha t'o, and who had received this name from the desert in which they lived (between the Altai and the T'ien shan). T'ang shu, chap, cclvii. b. See also note 151. It may be here the proper place to say a few words regarding the Chinese names applied to the Mongolian desert. The Mongols call it, as is well known, Gobi, and on modern Chinese maps this name is also rendered by Ge-bi. An ancient Chinese name for the desert, still in use up
to this time, is Sha mo (s/m = sand, mo = desert, sandy plain). Another ancient name for the Gobi was So mo (northern desert). It was properly applied to the desert extending from Kan chou (in Kan su) east to the Ordos, whilst the waterless solitude west of Kan chou was, and is still, known under the name of Ta tsi, also Sha tsi. Tsi means properly a rock. Compare also note 9 on the desert Han hai. Isolated elm trees {Ulmus pumila) are not unfrequent on the Mongolian plateaux, as I know from my own observation. They owe their existence to water-springs in the desert, and are sometimes of a large size.

extending more than ten thousand (1) li, no tree is to be seen. We left the sandy desert on the ist of the third month (March 25, 122 1), and arrived at a place called Yil rli li}'^^ where we began to find settlements. The people for the greater part are engaged in agriculture and fishing.
ii"* Let me quote here the diary of Chang Te hui (see note 104), who went by the same way as Chang ch'un as far as this Lake : " On the north from Fu chou (see note 108) I came to CKang cliou (according to Palladius' investigations, the ruins called Tsagan halgasun by the Mongols, eight miles north-west of Khara balgasun, and, like this place, on the road to Kiakhta). ... On the east of that city is a salt lake, about lOO li in circumference, called the Dog's lake, on account of the similarity of its shape to that of a dog (probably the same as the lake with many sinuosities mentioned in Chang ch'un's itinerary). More than loo li north of the city I noticed an old rampart, which stretched far off over the mountains and valleys. On the south a ruined town is joined to it, a fortified place, in which the boundary-guard was quartered. (This is the boundary -line Ming ch'ang in Chang chun's itinerary.) From this fort I went four stations more, and then came to the Sha t'o desert, in the whole expanse of which there are no stones or clods of earth. From a distance you see, as it were, a chain of low hills and hillocks ; but when you come to them they are only sand heaps. The trees which can grow on this soil are only elms and willows, and these are miserable, scattered about, and grow in clusters. The water is everywhere saline. I went in this desert six stations and then came out of it. After that I went north-westerly one station to the lake Yii rli po. There are really two lakes, both in circumference more than loo li. Between them is a dry passage from north to south. On the south-west of the lake is the temporary palace of a princess." (Detailed description of the palace.) The Yil rh li of Ch'ang ch'un and the Yil rh po of Chang Te hui are the same. Li and po both mean " lake ; " yii = to fish. This lake is twice mentioned in the Yiian shi, for the first under its Chinese name Yii rh li. Annals, sub anno 121 5, It is stated there that Chinghiz encamped near it after returning from his invasion into China. In the biography of Te sic shan (Yuan shi, chap, cxviii.) this lake is again mentioned, and the name is written there Ta-rh nao-rh (nor = lake in Mongol), also T'a-rh hai-tze {hai tze in Chinese = little sea). Its position is given there as distant 300 li north-east of Shang tu, the summer residence of Kubilai Khan. In the year 1270 the city of Ying cKang was founded on this lake. In the great Chinese geography of the empire the same lake, in South-Eastern Mongolia, is called Pu yii rh hai (meaning also " fishing lake "). This name is not to be confounded with Buyiir, a lake in North-Eastern Mongolia. The Chinese geography states that the (modern) Mongol name of the Pu yii rh hai is T'a li. In the times of the Mongols there was a junction of several post-roads at this point. Chang Te hui, who went to Karakorum,

At that time it was ts'ing ming (fifteen days after the
spring equinox), but there was no trace of spring, and the ice was not yet melted. On the 5th of the third month (March 29) we started again, and travelled in a north-eastern direction. All around we saw habitations, consisting of black carts and white tents.^^^ The people here are nomades, and change their abode according to the prevalence of water and pasture. No tree could be seen, and we met only yellow clouds (of dust) and decayed grass. Finally, after twenty days and more without changing the direction, we reached a sandy river, which flows to the
north-west, and discharges itself into the Lio kil river.^^^
here turned to the west. Ch'ang ch'un, -who was bound to the encampment of the prince Ocheghin, took a north-eastern direction. The first European who visited the lake in question was Father Gerbillon. See the narrative of his journey from Peking to Nipchu (Nerchinsk), in Du Halde's "China," iv. He saw this lake on the 27th of June 1689, and gives a detailed description of it. He calls it Taal nor, and is of opinion that it is about fifteen "lieues " in circumference. According to the Father it abounds in fish. At a distance of half a " lieue " from the lake he saw a ruined pagoda, and a marble slab with a Chinese inscription dating from the Mongol period. The same lake and the surrounding country were scientifically explored about sixteen years ago by Przewalsky. His accounts of it are in accordance with those of Gerbillon, but he calls it erroneously Dalai nor. The real name of the lake is, as I have been informed in Peking, by Mongols from those regions, Taal nor, as the Jesuit Father writes the name. Taal in Llongol means a plain ; nor, a lake. According to Przewalsky ("Mongolia," &;c., i. 108), this is the largest of the lakes of South-East Mongolia. In shape it is a flattened ellipse, with an axis elongated from north-east to south-west. It is about forty miles in circumference, and lies at an elevation of 4200 feet above the sea ; its climate is therefore as rigorous as the rest of Mongolia. In the middle of April its shores were still frozen. It does not entirely thaw till the first half of May, The lake abounds in fish. ... In early spring several hundred Chinese make their appearance on its shores for the purpose of fishing, and remain till late in the autumn.
Probably the large carts covered with felt—tents on wheels—are meant, as described by Marco Polo, Rubruck, Ibn Batuta, and others. See Yule's "M. Polo," i. 244-246. According to Potanin (''Mongolia," ii, 108), the practice of carrying felt tents upon waggons is now-a-days entirely obsolete in Mongolia. In ancient Chinese history the Kerulun river, in North -Eastern

We crossed tlie sandy river, the water coming up to the girths of the horses. The borders of the river were overgrown with willow-trees. After travelling three days in a northern direction, we entered the siao Sha fo (little Sha t'o desert; see note 112). On the 1st of the fourth month (April 23), 122 1, we reached the encampment of the prince 0-cJien (see note 102).^^^ At that time the ice was only beginning to melt, and the first green was seen on the ground. There was a wedding being celebrated, and many Mongol chiefs had arrived with mare's milk. We saw several thousands of black carts and felt tents standing in long rows. On the 7th (April 29) the master was presented to the prince, who asked him about the means of prolonging life. As it would have been unbecoming that the prince should hear the precepts of the master before the master had seen the emperor, it was agreed that on his return the master should call again on the prince. On the 17th the prince ordered that a hundred horses and bullocks should be given to expedite the master, and we started again (May 9). Our way led in a north-western direction. On the 22d of the fourth month (May 14) we reached the river Lii-kil (or Kerulun), which here forms a lake of several hundreds of li in circumference. When the waves rise by the wind, great fish are thrown out, and the Mongols catch them easily. We then went along the southern shore of the river
Mongolia, is called Lu Jcii. In the Yiian shi it is generally named K'ie-lulien, which, is a transcription of the Mongol name Kerulun. The sandy river crossed hj Chang ch'uu was probably the Khalga gol, which, however, is not a direct affluent of the Kerulun. See also note 127, regarding the Kerulun. Palladius is of opinion that the encampment of the prince was on the Khalga river. ' But it would seem from the narrative that it was farther to the north. Palladius thinks that the lake Buyiir is meant. I may observe that the Buyiir is not in direct connection with the Kerulun, but communicates by the river Orshun with the great lake Kulon or Dalai nor, into which the Kerulun discharges itself. It seems to me that the great lake mentioned

It was so dark that the stars could be seen, but soon it brightened up again.^^o In this country it is cold in the morning but warm in the evening. We saw huang Jma (yellow flowers) in abundance. The river flows to the north-east. On both banks of it are many high willow trees, which the Mongols
use for making their tents. After a journey of sixteen days (up the Kerulun, along its southern bank), we arrived at the place where the river chancres its direction, windinor round the hills to

in the narrative was tlie Kulon. Father Gerbillon visited these lakes in 1698 (Du Halde's " China," iv.) ; Pallas, in the last century, saw the Kulon. He states that it is abounding in fish. Gerbillon says the same regarding the Buyiir. The Buyiir lake is frequently mentioned by Rashideddin in connection mth the ancient history of the Mongols (d'Ohsson, i. 62, 75, 428, &c.) The lake Keule mentioned together with the Buyiir on p. 75 is probably the Kulon. Hie is a kind of cultivated Allium. Ye hie, or wild hie, denotes one of the numerous Allium species of Mongolia. Camels are very fond of them. ! 12*^ This statement gives a stamp of authenticity to the whole narrative. A. Wylie, who, in the first edition of my ** Chinese Mediaeval Travellers," gives a long and interesting article on the eclipse observed by Ch'ang ch'un, has found by calculation that there was a solar eclipse on May 23d (old style), 1221, central about 3 h. 45 m. civil reckoning at London. All astronomical details furnished by Ch'ang ch'un, in the above passage and farther on, with respect to this celestial phenomenon, are in general in accordance with Wylie's calculations. The same eclipse is also mentioned in the Chinese astronomical annals, and with the same date as given by Ch'ang ch'un. See Gaubil's " Traites de 1' Astronomic Chinoise " in Souciet's "Observ. Math. Astron.," &c., iii. 354. ^^ In China the name of huang hua is applied to the yellow Day Lily, Hemerocallis fulva. This species is hardly found in a wild state in Northern Mongolia.

The married women put on their heads a thing made of the bark of trees, two feet high, which they sometimes cover with woollen cloth, or, as the rich used to do, with red silk stuff. This cap is provided with a long tail, which they call gu-gu, and which resembles a goose or duck. They are always in fear that somebody might inadvertently run against this

In 1698 Father Gerbillon went by about the same way as Chang ch'un, from the Kulon lake upwards along the Kerulun, and to the Orkhon. He mentions rich pastures on the borders of this river. Some thirty years ago the Kerulun valley was surveyed by Russian topographers. See the new Russian map of Asia. See also note 127. ^-•^ The road followed from Yu rh li to Karakorum by Chang Te hui (see note 104). 124 "Wyiie tries to determine from these indications the position of the travellers.

According to this it is probable they were south of the southern bend of the Tula river, somewhere about E. long. 107° ; and as four stations farther to the north-west took them across a river, that river was doubtless the Karuha {Kharukha of the Russian map, an affluent of the Tula).

Farther on, after four stations, to the north-west we crossed a river beyond which a plain extended with luxurious grass and abounding in water. The plain was surrounded by mountains with picturesque valleys. On the east and on the west (of the river ?) we saw the ruins of an ancient city. We could recognise the position of

Meng hung, a Chinese general, contemporary of Chinghiz, has left very valuable accounts regarding the Mongols. He had been in Mongolia, and knew them from his own observation. In his Memoirs he states the following about the coiifure of Mongol ladies : The wives of their chieftains (princes) wear a cap which they call gu-gu. It is made from wire, about three feet high, and has the appearance of a bamboo (?) The whole is covered with purple velvet. Several Western mediaeval authors mention this peculiar coiffure of Mongol women, which, according to Potanin's inquiries ("Mongolia," ii. p. 23, note 27), is unknown, now-a-days, in Mongolia. Carpini (615) states on the subject :

"Mulieres maritatae super caput habent unum quid rotundum de viminibus vel de cortice factum quod in longum protenditur ad unam ulnam, et in summitate desinit in quadrum : et ab imo usque ad summum in amplitudine semper crescit, et in summitate habet virgulam unam longam et gracilem de auro vel de argento seu de ligno, vel etiam pennam : et est assutum super unum pileolum quod protenditur usque ad humeros ; et tam pileolum quam instrumentum prsedictum est tectum de bukerano sive purpura vel baldakino ; sine quo instrumento coram hominibus nunquam vaduut." Rubruquis, p. 232: " Mulieres maritatae habent ornamentum capitis quod vocant bocca" (some MSS. have hotta). After this he describes this coiffure in about the same way as Carpini. The Mohammedan authors also know this head-dress of the Mongol princesses, and term it hogtak. See Quatremere's " Histoire des Mongols de la Perse," i. 102, note, and Yule's "Cathay," 131. The Uigur writing was introduced by Chinghiz among his people a few years after Chang ch'un visited Mongolia (Palladius).

Let me quote here the narrative of Chang Te hui's journey (see note 104), who, from the bend of the Kerulun westward, seems to have followed the same route as Ch'ang ch'un. This traveller, after leaving the lake YU rh (see note 114), went north-westerly twenty stations, and then arrived at a river, which the northern people (Mongols) called Ki-lu-lien (Kerulun). His report then continues as follows :

On both banks of this river willows grow plentifully. It flows to the east, and has a' very rapid current. The natives there say that there are j&sh in it three and four feet long, which, however, it is impossible to catch either in spring, summer, or autumn ; but in winter they make holes in the ice and catch them. Along the river there live Mongols and Chinese together. There are some miserable huts with earthen roofs. The land there is much cultivated, but they only sow hemp and wheat. On the northern side of the river is a large mountain called K'u-su-wu, that is, " black mountain." If you look at it from some distance there seems to be a thick forest on it, but when you are near, this turns out to be dark stones, which receive this colour from the constant mists on the mountains." Palladius is right in identifying this with the mountain called now-adays Tono, about which the Kerulun, running from the north, makes a semicircle so as to turn to the east. Gerbillon saw the Tono in 1696. Our traveller continues : "From the southern side of the mountain I went south-west nine stations, and came to another river, in width and depth equal to one-third of the river Ki-lu-lien, Here there are also large fish, which are caught in the same way. The river runs to the west, and is exceedingly swift, so that it is impossible to cross it. In the northern
language (Mongol) it is called Ilun Du-la, that is, ' the hare.' " Tulai in Mongol means "a hare." No doubt here the river Tola is meant, which the caravans from the south going to Urga have to pass. The traveller evidently did not cross it, and went along its southern bank. The Tola from Urga runs about a hundred miles in a south-western direction, and then turns to the north. The T'u-la or T'u-wu-la river is often mentioned in the Yiian shi. Rashid-eddin calls it Tula, sometimes Tura. With respect to Eun, prefixed to the name of the river, see note 308. The traveller continues : "I went down the river (Tola) one station to an ancient town (not ' wooden town,' as Mr. Schuyler repeatedly translates) constructed by the K'i-tan. It is about three li in circumference ; the back is turned to the mountain, the front to the river. From this place the river runs to the north." After that the traveller went in a north-western direction, to a lake called U-u-gie-nao-rh (the Ugei nor of modern maps of Mongolia), from which there was a carriage road to Ho-lin {Karakorum, see note 304),

there.i'-s
situated from the lake south-west about 100 li distant. It does not seem that Chang Te hui visited Karakorum, but he crossed the river on which the modest Mongol capital stood. The traveller further states :

"From the lake (Ugei nor) directly west is a small ancient city also constructed by the K'i-tan. To the west the city opens on a broad valley, loo li in circumference. Around it are mountains on every side. ... In the middle of it runs the river Ho-lin (the Orkhon). From this place Chang Te hui went to the summer residence of Kubilai Khan, which was beyond the river Ta-mi (Tamir), somewhere in the Khangai mountains. After this digression let us return to Ch'ang cli un's itinerary. Where was the river he crossed beyond which a plain extended, surrounded by picturesque mountains, and on which a ruined city of the K'i-tan stood ? It cannot be denied that these particulars bear a striking resemblance to the description Chang Te hui gives of the plain in which the Ho-lin [Orl'hon) river runs, and where he notices a city of the K'i-tan. But he mentions also the ruins of a K'i-tan city on the Tola river, and Palladius thinks that Ch'ang ch'un crossed this river. That is, however, not probable, for then the traveller would have been obliged to cross the river a second time. Wylie (see note 124) and Paderin look for the K'i-tan city in question on the Karuha river, which is an affluent of the Tola. It is difficult to trace Ch'ang cli'un's route precisely. The regions here spoken of have repeatedly been traversed during the last twenty years by Russian officers ; for the straight road from Urga to Uliassutai passes by the above-mentioned lake Ugei nor and crosses the Orkhon and other tributaries of the Selenga. In 1873 M. Paderin discovered what he believes to be the ruins of ancient Karakorum. An English translation of his report, annotated by Colonel Yule, is found in the Geographical Magazine, 1874. About ten years ago Professor Pozdneyeflf visited the valley of the Orkhon. See his " Mongol annals Erdeniin," 1883. In 1879 Colonel Pevtsoff went from Urga to Uliassutai. He published, in 1883, an interesting book on his travels in Mongolia, and appended to it an excellent map of Mongolia, the best now existing. Regarding the K'i-tan, see note 22. Palladius states on the subject : " The K'i-tan of the tenth and eleventh centuries left traces of their rule in all the countries which touch China on the north. Ruins of their fortifications and towns are met with not only on the Tola, but on the Kerulun and in Manchuria. The K'i-tan letters, mentioned by Ch'ang ch'un, were formed on the basis of the Chinese characters. Specimens of them are preserved on the Shu shi hui yao. According to the Persian historiographers, the Karakhitai were often at war with Khovarezm, and may have possessed Samarkand for a time.

On the 13th of the sixth month (July 3), 1221, we passed over a mountain called Ch'ang sung ling (mountain of high pines), and stopped on the other side. There were many pines and Jcuai trees (see note 1 39). They grow so high as to reach the clouds, and so dense that the sunbeams cannot penetrate them. They predominate in the valleys on the northern slope of the mountain. On the southern slope few are found.^^^ On the 14th (July 4) we passed over a mountain crossed a shallow river, and passed the night in a plain. It was frightfully cold, and the next morning we found a thin coat of ice on the water. The natives said that generally in the fifth or sixth month snow begins to fall in this country, and that, happily, this year it was not so cold as in other years ; therefore the master changed the name of the mountain into Ta han ling (mountain of the great cold). Eain here is always accompanied by hail.^^^ Thence we went more than a hundred li to the southwest, through a mountainous country, on a winding road. There was a stony river, more than fifty li long, the banks of which were about a hundred feet high. The water in the river was clear and cold, and bubbled like sonorous jade. On the steep bank we saw a large kind of onion, three or four feet high.^^^ In the valleys splendid pine trees were growing, of more than a hundred feet in height. The mountains stretched to the west in a continuous chain,
all covered with tall pioe trees. We were five or six days travelling in these mountains, the road winding round the peaks. It was magnificent scenery, the slopes of the

This striking fact is also reported by Elias (p. 129, note) with respect to the mountains of Mongolia, Carpini, 610 : " De dispositione aeris in terra Tartarum : Ibi est etiam

rocks covered with noble forests, with the river gliding through the depths below. On level places pines and birches were growing together. Then we ascended a high mountain which resembled a large rainbow, overlooking an abyss of several thousand feet deep. It was dreadful to look down to the lake in the depth.^^'^ On the 28th of the sixth month (July 18) we stopped
to the east of the %uu-li-do {ordo, see note 137) of the empress.^^^ Chung lu (the adjutant) sent an express to
Altliougli it is impossible to ascertain the route followed by Cli'ang cliun since he left the bend of the Kerulun, there can, however, be no doubt that he traversed the mountainous country watered by the Orkhon, Tamir, and other affluents of the Selenga. Perhaps he proceeded partly by the afore-mentioned straight road from Urga to Uliassutai, which crosses those rivers. At any rate he passed over the high range of mountains stretching from north-west to south-east and forming the watershed which divides the basin of the Selenga from that of the Dsabkhan and the lakes east of the Altai. This chain is known to the Mongols by the name oi Khangai. The description given by the Chinese traveller of the inhospitable mountains they passed through agrees well with the Khangai, which in some places rises to a considerable elevation. Shishmareff, who at the end of July 1868 visited Uliassutai, situated at an elevation of 5400 feet, on the western slope of this mountain, saw one of its summits there covered with snow ( " Peterm. Geogr, Mitth.," 1870, p. 116). There is a defile of nearly 10,000 feet elevation north-east of Uliassutai, marked on Potanin's map. This able explorer of Western Mongolia has tried to trace Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary over the Khangai (Potanin's "Mongolia," i. 235, seqq.) He comes to the conclusion that the Chinese traveller came out from it near the present Uliassutai. Khangai is an ancient name. The Han hai mountain is mentioned in the Yiian shi, annals sub anno 1204, with reference to Chinghiz Khan's war with the Naimans. The same name is found there, sub anno 1289, Kublai Khan's war with Kaidu. On the same occasion Rashid-eddin notices (d'Ohsson, ii. 461) that the dominions of Kubilai and Kaidu were separated by the mountains Kanghai and the Kobi desert. On modern Chinese maps the name is spelled Hang-ai. Potanin identifies the " mountain of high pines " of Ch'ang ch un with a mountain which the Mongols call Undur shana (high pine), an eastern
branch of the Khangai, —and the " stony river " of the Chinese traveller, with the Chilot'jb (meaning " stony " in Mongol), a southern affluent of the Selenga. The Undur shana lies east of the Chilotu. The lake beneath the mountain, resembling a rainbow, in the Chinese account, is, according to Potanin, the Chagan nor, from which the Chilotu river comes out. The Chinese commentator of Ch'ang ch'un's travels explains that they arrived at the temporary residence of one of the principal wives of

announce our arrival, and the empress immediately sent an invitation to the master. We crossed a shallow river which flows to the north-east, the water of which came only up to the axle of the cart, and then entered the encampment. On the southern bank of the river there were more than a thousand carts and tents. The Chinese princess and the princess of Hia^^^ both sent presents of millet and silver. At this place eighty
hin of flour cost fifty Hang ; for the flour is brought from beyond the Yin shan}^^ a distance of more than 2000 li, on camels, by the Western barbarians. Although it was the hot season we had no flies in our tents. Willi- do (in Mongol) means in Chinese hing kungP'^ Carts and tents had all a magnificent appearance, such as was unknown to the ancient Sha7i yii}^^ On the 9th of the seventh month (July 29), 1221, we left the Oirlo, and travelled in a south-western direction five or six days. Several times we saw snow on the tops of the mountains, and at their base we often met with grave-mounds. On the top of one of the mountains we
found traces of sacrifices offered to the spirits (of the mountains). After two or three days we passed over a mountain which rises in the form of a pointed peak. It
Chinghiz, The Yiian shi states (chap, cvi.) that Chinghiz had four ordo, in every one of which one of his principal wives resided with a number of concubines. This ordo of the empress seems to have been, as Potanin judiciously assumes, on the river Ater, one of the sources of the Selenga. Here the princesses of the emperors of the Kin and the Mia (Tangut, see note 46) are meant. Chinghiz, after vanquishing these sovereigns, took their princesses as concubines. This is reported also in the Yiian shi. Rashid (d'Ohsson, i. 418) calls the Kin princess, taken for wife by Chinghiz, GuJcdju.

was covered with pines and Jcicai trees.^^^ To the west was a lake. We passed through a vast defile to the south, and found a river flowing westward.^*^ On the northern side we saw a great variety of trees, and for more than twenty li we found on our road abundance of Jcm'^^'^ and fragrant grass. To the north lay ruins of an ancient city, Ho'la-siao}^^ Proceeding to the south-west, we passed about twenty li through a sandy desert, where water and grass were scarce. There we saw the first Hui-ho (see note 149), who were occupied irrigating their fields by means of aqueducts. After five or six days' travelling we reached a mountain, and having passed on its southern side, rested at a Mongol encampment (station), passing the night in a tent. At daybreak we started again, and travelled along the Nan shan (southern mountains), on which we saw snow.i^^ The master wrote a poem (detailing his journey from Fu chou to the mountains mentioned). At the station we were told that to the north of these snowy mountains is T'ien Chen-hai ha-la-7io-sun. Ba-la-ha-sun (balgassun) is the same as " city " in Chinese. There are
Kuai is a coniferous tree, according to the Dictionary of the T'ang dynasty, identical with the kui or Junijoerus ; but here probably larch trees are to be understood. Potanin {1. c.) thinks that the pointed peak in the narrative is the Otkhon khairkhan, one of the snowy summits of the Khangai, east of Uliassutai. At the foot of it is a lake, at the sources of the Bogdyn river. The river flowing westward, after Cliang ch'un had come out from the defile, was, according to Potanin, the Uliassutai river. Here the traveller found himself west of the Khangai range. Kiu in China is Allium odorum ; frequent in the Peking mountains, and also much cultivated. 142 rpi^jg name bears some resemblance to Uliassutai. The city of this name dates only from the middle of the last century, but the river Uliassutai, near which it is situated, was probably long ago known by this appellation. TJliassu means a poplar. Uliassutai is the adjective form. Potanin is embarrassed in tracing Ch'ang ch'un's road west of the Khangai mountain. Between this range of mountains and the Altai (noticed farther on in the narrative) there are no mountains of a considerable elevation. Besides this, the diarist does not mention the crossing of the Dsapkhan river.

magazines of corn ; therefore the city is also called tsang
t'ou (the head of magazines).^** On the 25 th of the seventh month (August 14) a number of Chinamen, artisans and workmen, who lived there (compare note 144), came in procession to see the master. They were all ravished ; met him with exclamations of joy, bowed before him, and accompanied him with variegated umbrellas and fragrant flowers. There were also two concubines of the Kin emperor, Chang tsung}^^ and the mother of a Chinese princess, who met the master with exclamations and tears. The latter said : " For a long time I have heard of your reputation and your virtues, and was always grieved at not having seen you; but now, unexpectedly, I have met you in this country." The next day Chen-hai arrived from the northern side of the A-lu-lian mountain.^^^^ Chang cliun said to him that he was much surprised at seeing the people ruled by Chen-hai carrying on agriculture, for in the desert this is a rarity. He also asked Chen-hai's opinion about the
Tien means ''field" in Chinese. Chen-hai was the name of a high officer in the service of Chinghiz. His biography is found in the Yiian shi, chap, cxx. There it is stated that Chinghiz established a military settlement at A-lu-huan. A city was built there, and Chen-hai was appointed to the government of the place. This explains the above name. There were 300 families and more from Western Asia, employed in weaving gold brocade, and 300 from Pien king (now Kai feng fu in Ho nan) making woollen cloth. Chen-hai is stated in this biography to have been minister during the reign of Ogotai and Kuyuc, Chinghiz' successors. This must be the Chingcal mentioned by Rashid. D'Ohsson (ii. 189) calls him "le chancelier Tchingcai." Carpini (763, 764) speaks also of the
Chancellor Chingay, with whom he conferred at the court of Kuyuc. According to Rashid, Chingcai was an Uigur, and was killed by order of the Emperor Mangu (d'Ohsson, ii. 269). The Yiian shi does not speak of his perishing by a violent death. As to the situation of the ancient Chinese colony, Potanin conjectures that it was somewhere near the Tsastu-bogdo mountain, an eastern branch of the Altai, about 46° 40' N. lat.; but it seems to me that it was farther to the north. ^^5 These concubines had been taken by Chinghiz after the surrendering of Yen (Peking). Evidently the same as the A-lu-huan in Chen-hai's biography. (See note 144.) We shall see afterwards that this mountain was about 1000 li south-east of the Upper Yenissey. See note 262.



SI YU KI (CH'ANG CH'UN). 6i
question of remaining there and waiting the return of the emperor. Chen-hai declared that he lately had received orders from Chinghiz to expedite the master when he arrived in this country, as soon as possible, and that he would be responsible for the master's staying there for any length of time. He manifested his intention to go with the master, so that the latter could not object, and decided to proceed on his journey again. Chen-hai observed further, that in the regions they would have to pass through now there were precipitous mountains and large marshes which could not be traversed by carts. He proposed to travel on horseback, and to restrict the number of the suite and the carts. The master agreed, and left nine of his disciples behind. A monastery was built for them, in the construction of which everybody assisted

the rich with money and the workmen with their labour ; so that in less than a month the edifice was finished. It was named Si hia kuan (Si hia was the name of Ch'ang ch'un's native place). On the 8th of the eighth month (August 26), 1221, the master started again, taking with him ten disciples. There were only two carts with the caravan, and more than twenty Mongols from the station (encampment) accompanied him. Liu kung (see note 96) and Chen-hai had also a hundred riders with them. The way led to the west, in the vicinity of high mountains. One of the servants of Chen-hai reported that these mountains had a bad fame for their goblins, and that once a goblin pulled him by the hair. Chen-hai narrated further, that once it occurred also to the Khan of the Naiman (see note 98), who passed through this country, to be charmed by a goblin, and that he was obliged to offer a sacrifice to him. The master did not make any remark on these tales. After having travelled south-westward about three days, we turned to the south-east, passed a great mountain, proceeded through a vast defile, and on the 15th of the eighth month (September 2) we were at the north

eastern side of the Kin shan mountains (the Altai ; see note 5). We stopped here for some time, and then went south. These mountains are very high and vast, with
deep defiles and long slopes. There is no road for carts. The road over these mountains was planned and constructed by the third prince, at the time the army went to the west.^*'' The hundred riders (who formed the escort) were ordered, at difficult ascents, to pull our carts by ropes, and to place drags upon the wheels when descend
ing. In the space of about three stations (three days' journey) we crossed successively three ridges of mountains, and arrived then at the southern side of the mountain (they had now crossed the Kin shan), where we stopped near a river, at a place abounding in water and grass.^*^ Here tents were pitched, and we were waiting several days for bullocks and horses. The master (profiting from this rest) made three poems (in which he celebrates the scenery of the Kin shan). After having crossed the river, we proceeded southward and passed over a low mountain with stones of different colours. On the sides of this mountain no tree or grass was found. Within seventy li we saw two red-coloured hills ; and thirty li farther, stopped at a fresh-water well
in the midst of a salt desert, where we prepared our food
Ogotai, the third son of Chinghiz, who probably preceded the bulk of the Mongol army proceeding on this way to the west in 12 19, ^^ From the statement, that in the defile Ch'ang cli un passed through, the road had been prepared for the passage of the Mongol army, we may conclude that he went by the same way as Chinghiz Khan and Ye-lti Ch'u tsai (see the first narrative), but unfortunately the geographical definitions in the narratives of the Chinese travellers are so vague that it is impossible to decide where they crossed the Altai range. As the defile of Dabysten daban is the less difficult among the passes leading over that mountain chain, the Mongol armies and our travellers may have passed by this defile. But, on the other hand, the rich pastures noticed in the above text and the river the travellers had to cross would lead us to suppose that they had come down from the Ulan daban pass to the Bulgun river. Compare note 5.

with this water. The grass around the well was much trampled down by sheep and horses. Chung lu then had a conference with Chen-hai about our journey. He said : " We are come now to the most difficult part of the road ; what is your opinion ? " Chenhai replied : " I have known these places well for a long time; " and addressing the master he said : " We have before us the 'po ku fien (field of white bones). It is thickly strewn all over with black stones. We have to travel more than 200 li to reach the northern border of the Sha fo (sandy desert; see note 112), where we shall find plenty of water and grass ; then we have to cross the great Sha t'o, in extent about 100 li (from north to south). This desert extends west and east, I cannot tell exactly how many thousand li. On the other (southern) side of the desert is a town of the Ilid-ho}^^ There only shall we find water and grass again." The master asked: "What do you mean by 'field of white bones '
'? " Chen-hai replied : " That is an old battlefield

a field of death. At one time a whole army perished there by exhaustion; no one escaped. A short time ago, at the same place, the army of the Nai-man was destroyed.^^^ Whoever crosses the desert in the daytime and in clear weather {i.e., exposed to the sun) will die from fatigue, and his horse also. Only when starting in the evening, and travelling the whole night, is it possible to reach water and grass on the next day by noon." After a short rest we started in the afternoon. On our road we saw more than a hundred large sand-hills, which seemed to swim like big ships in the midst of the waves. The next day, between eight and ten o'clock in the morning, we reached a town. We did not get tired travelling at night-time, only we were afraid of being charmed by goblins in the darkness. To prevent charms,
By Hui-ho Mohammedans in general are to be understood. See n ote 49. By Chinghiz. See note 98.

we rubbed the heads of our horses with blood. When the master saw this operation he smiled and said : " Goblins flee away when they meet a good man ; as it is written in the books. It does not suit a Taoist to entertain such
thoughts." At sunset we started again, leaving behind on the road all our tired-out bullocks, and put six horses to every cart ; henceforth we used no more bullocks.^^^ At the time we were still at the northern border of the great desert, we had observed on the southern horizon something like a silver-hued morning twilight. We asked
The above accounts in the narrative refer to the inhospitable barren solitudes which extend between the Altai chain and the Celestial Mountains, and which on the west are bordered by the Dsungarian mountains. During the space of the last ten years, these uninhabitable tracts, suitable only for wild horses and wild camels, and for which Przewalsky proposes the name of Dsungarian desert, have been repeatedly traversed, in various directions, by Russian travellers. Captain Sosno^oslcy, and his companions of travel, crossed it, when returning from China, between the city of Ku ch'eng and the Russian military station of Zaisan, in September 1875. The expedition was near perishing during this passage. Such accidents are not uncommon in these regions. See Dr. Piassetsky's "Travels in
China," ii. 483 seqq. —PrzewalsJcy. from October to December 1877, went
by the same way, from Zaisan to Ku ch'eng and back. And in 1879, in spring, the intrepid traveller again crossed the same desert,' proceeding from lake Ulungur (Kizilbash) up the rivers Urungu and Bulgun, and then turning to the south, went to Barhul. See his "Tibet," 21 seqq.

Potanin, on his journeys from Kobdo to Barkul, and from Hami to Uliassutai, in 1877, had to cross the most eastern narrowed portion of
the same desert. See "Mongolia," i. 145, 181. — Potanin gives also {I. c. i. 124 seqq.) two itineraries of Russian commercial caravans proceeding, in
1877, from Kobdo, via Ulan daban and Bulgun river, to Ku ch'eng. The Dsungarian desert is described by Przewalsky and the other travellers as an elevated (from 1800 to 2500 feet) barren plain, for the greater part destitute of water, sandy in some parts ; in other places thickly covered with pebble. This latter is, as Potanin notices (i. 146), of a black colour, and gives to the desert a peculiar darkish aspect. Compare the statement in the Chinese account that all over it was thickly strewn
with black stones. —Piassetsky compares the sand-hills in this desert (sha t'o in the Chinese text, see note 112) to the waves of the sea. The Chinese diarist makes a similar comparison. The Russian caravan had to cross, before reaching Ku ch'eng, a desert consisting of sand-hills, and extending for eighty versts from north to south. Although it is impossible to determine the line actually followed by

our companions, but nobody knew what it was. Then the master said : " That must be the Yin shan mountain chain." The next day, after crossing the desert, we met some woodcutters, and asked them. They confirmed the words of the master. It w^as the Yin shan. On the 27th of the eighth month (September 14), 1221, we arrived at the northern side of the Yin shan. There was a small town (the town of the Hui-ho, spoken of by Chen-hai). The Hui-ho came to meet the master, and the chief of the town presented fruits and Persian linen cloth (Po-sz pu). He told us that 300 li distant, on the other side of the Yin shan, there was the city of Htto chou ; that it was very hot there, and that Huo chou w^as celebrated for the abundance of grapes.^^'^ The next day we proceeded westward along a river, and passed two small towns. At this time (middle of September) wheat was just beginning to get ripe. The land was artificially irrigated by spring-water (conducted from the mountains), for rain is rare there. Travelling farther to the west, we reached a large
city called Bie-sz-ma}^^ The %vang (ruler or prince), the officers, the people, the Buddhist and Taoist priests, &c.,
Ch'ang cli'un in crossing the Dsungarian desert, we may conjecture that his guides had chosen the shorter and at the same time less dangerous route, i.e., from the Bulgun river or the Urungu to about the spot where now Ku ch'eng stands. There is now, as Przewalsky states, a road practicable for carts connecting Ku ch'eng with Bulun tokhoi via the Urungu river. ^5^ The Tien shan or Celestial Mountains ; see note 4.

came long distances out of the city to meet the master. We lodged in a vineyard west of the city. The relatives of the ivang of the Hui-ho brought wine made of grapes/^^ various fruits, &c. The devotion the people felt for the master increased from day to day. In his company were seen Buddhists, Taoists, and Confucionists. The master inquired much about the country and its customs. They told us that at the time of the T'ang dynasty (618-907) this city was the tuan fic of Pei t'ing}^'^ and that up to this time the frontier towns estab
lished by the T'ang still exist. They related further, that several hundred li to the east is a fu (city of a department)
called Si liang}^^ and 300 li to the west a hien (district
city) called Lun fai}^^ The master asked what they reckoned the distance to the place where the emperor (Chinghiz) then was. All agreed in estimating it at 10,000 li and more to the south-west. On the 2d of the ninth month (September 19) we started again, and after four days' journey westward, stopped east of the city of Lun tai (see note 159), where the chief of the Tie-sie came to meet us.
Chinese wine is made of rice. Pei t'ing in Chinese means " northern court." In the seventh century (T'ang period) this was one of the residences of the Tu-kue (Turks). After the latter had submitted to the Chinese, Pei t'ing in 702 became the seat of a Chinese governor-general, tu hu fu. I cannot explain why the above text has tuan fu. In 981, when Wang Yen te visited the Uigur country, Pei t'ing belonged to the Uigurs. In the days of Chinghiz this place was called Bishbalik (i.e., Five cities), and was the capital of the Uigurs. Klaproth in his " Mem. rel. h, I'Asie," ii. 355 seqq., has pointed out that the site of ancient Bishbalik answers to the present Urumtsi. Si Hang of that time was the present Liang chou fu in the province of Kan su. This place, however, was not to the east, but to the southeast of Bishbalik, and at a considerable distance. There must be an error, or the author speaks of another city of this name. The same place is mentioned in the itinerary of Ye-lii Ch'u t'sai, 200 li west of Bishbalik. This author, as well as the diarist of Ch'ang ch'un's travels, place it north of the T'ien shan. As has been observed in note 12, it would seem that the Lun t'ai of the Han dynasty must be looked for south of these mountains. According to Palladius ("Ancient Traces of Christianity in China,"

Russ. Orient. Record, i. 25-63). Tie-sie is the Chinese transcription of the word tersa, used by the Persians since the time of the Sassanides to designate the Christians, and sometimes also the Fire-worshippers and Magi. The name of Tai'se is applied expressly to the kingdom of the Yogurs (Uigurs) by Haithon the Armenian in his account of the kingdoms of Asia (beginning of the fourteenth century). John of Montecorvino, in a letter wiitten at Peking at about the same time, speaks of Tarsic characters, meaning evidently Uigur letters. Yule thinks (" Cathay," 205) that the application of this term to the Uigurs indicates the extensive prevalence of ISTestorian Christianity among them. I have little doubt that Ch'ang ch'un here saw the Bogdo ola, the lofty solitary mountain situated between Urumtsi, Turfan, and Ku ch'eng, connected, however, with the main chain of the T'ien shan. It rises skyward with its threefold snow-covered summit to an elevation of about 14,000 feet, and has produced a stupendous impression upon all modern travellers who saw it from the desert. According to Przewalsky, it is visible at a distance of 250 versts. Dr. A. Regel, in the map of these regions (see note 1 53), represents the Bogdo ola in profile. Pevtsoff visited this mountain in 1876. The name of this place was probably Djamhalik Balik means city. A city Chang-ha-li is repeatedly mentioned in the Yiian shi. It appears also on the Chinese mediaeval map, west of Bie-shi-ha-la. Haithon, king of Little Armenia, on his way back from Mongolia, mentions Djambalekh, west of Bishbalik. Djambalik was evidently situated on the great highway leading along the northern slope of the T'ien shan, as now-a-days, to the Sairam lake, and farther on to the Hi valley. Dr. A. Regel, who proceeded by this way from Urumtsi to Kuldja, marks on his map many ruined cities. In the Yiian shi the name Wei-wu-rJi is applied to the Uigurs. For farther particulars on this nation I beg the reader to refer to Part II.

spoke with him by means of an interpreter. It must be observed that the country from this place eastward belonged to China at the time of the T'ang dynasty. West of it there are neither Buddhists nor Taoists. The Hui-ho only worship the west.^^* The next day we proceeded farther to the west, and went along (the northern slope of) the Yin shan as far as about ten stations. We crossed also a sandy desert, where the loose sand is collected by the wind into moving hillocks, resembling the waves of the sea.'-^^ No vegetation is visible there ; the carts cut deeply into the sand, and the horses also sink. To cross this sandy desert took a whole day's journey. This is probably a part of the great desert (which Chen-hai) called the field of white bones. It is bounded to the south by the Yin shan mountains.^^^ After leaving the sandy desert, we travelled five days, and stopped on the northern side of the Yin shan. The next day, early in the morning, we proceeded southward on a long slope seventy or eighty li, and stopped in the evening to rest. The air was cold ; we found no water. The next day we started again, and travelled southwest-ward, and at a distance of twenty li suddenly got sight of a splendid lake of about 200 li in circumference, enclosed on all sides by snow-topped peaks, which were reflected in the water. The master named it the Lake of
By Hui ho the Mohammedans are to be understood (see note 49), for, when praying, they always turn towards Mecca. These are probably the Cyollos Kagon or " sand-hills thrown up by the wind," noticed by Marignolli, in the fourteenth century, on his way from Armalec to Camhalec (Peking). See Yule's "Cathay," 339. Compare also "Arab Shah," i. cap. 45 : "Arenarum cumuli, instar montium in regionibus Mogolorum." The road followed by Ch'ang ch'un along the northern slope of the T'ien shan to the Sairam lake is still a great highway, on which the commercial caravans from Kuldja to Urumtsi, Ku ch'eng, &c., pass. Dr. Kegel, when returning from his expedition to Turfan via Urumtsi, went by this way. The sandy desert through which Ch'ang ch'un had to pass is marked on recent maps south and south-east of lake Ebinor. It seems that the ancient Mongol road passed by the valley of Borotala before reaching the Sairam lake. See note 16.

Heaven}^'^' Following the shore, we descended in a southern direction, and on either side saw nothing but perpendicular cliffs and rugged peaks. The mountains were covered to their summits with dense forests, consisting of birches and pine trees more than a hundred feet high. The river winds through the gorge for about sixty or seventy li, with a rapid current, sometimes shooting down in cascades. The second prince,-^^^ who was with the emperor at the time he went to the west (in 12 19), first made a way through these mountains, cut through the rocks, and built forty-eight bridges with the wood cut on the mountains. The bridges are so wide that two carts can pass side by side.^*^^ We passed the night in the defile,^^^ and left the next morning; then entered a broad valley which stretched from east to west, well watered, with abundant grass, and here and there some mulberry trees or jujubes.^^^ The next station from this was the city of A-li-ma}'^^
-^ The same lake is mentioned in Ye-lu Ch'u ts'ai's narrative. See note 17. This is without any doubt the Sairam lake in the mountains north of Kuldja. It appears also under its Kirghiz name, Sutkul, in the narrative of King Haithon the Armenian (see note 476). PutimtsofF, a Russian traveller, was the first European who visited this lake, in 181 1 ; he gives an exact description of it. See Klaproth's " Magasin Asiatique," i. But it was only after the Kussian occupation of Kuldja in 1871 that the Sairam lake and the surrounding country were surveyed by Russian topographers. In the autumn of 1873 Mr. Schuyler paid a visit to this interesting mountain lake. He finds that Ch'ang ch'un gives an excellent description of it (Schuyler's "Turkestan," ii. 188). Dr. A. Regel was the first naturalist who, in July 1877, studied the flora of these regions. '^^^ Chinghiz Khan's second son, Chagatai. Palladius remarks that Ye-lii Ch'u ts ai (see the first narrative), in his poems, speaks of these bridges, and of the splendid mountain lake. The defile by which Ch'ang ch'un went down from the mountains surrounding the Sairam lake to the plain of the Hi river is now-a-days known by the name of the Talki pass ; it leads over the Borokhoro range. Schuyler, I. c, ii. 188 : "The little river Talki (in the ravine of the same name) came bounding over the rocks in a succession of pretty cascades. High walls of rock. Superb vegetation in the ravine ; wild apples, wild apricots, elms, poplars." The Chinese post-road from Peking to Kuldja passes by the Sairam lake, the Talki defile, and Suidun, a place situated north-west of Kuldja. The valley of the Hi river.

which was reached on the 27th of the ninth month (October 14). The ruler of the realm of P\i-su-man'^'^^ came out of the city, together with the Mongol ta-lu-huachi^'^^ to meet the master. We stopped at a fruit orchard
west (of the city). The people here call a fruit (X-/^-ma; and as the place is famed for its fruits, the city received the above name.^^^ There is a kind of cloth called the tu-lu-ma}^^ The people say that it is woven from vegetable wool We got seven pieces of it for winter clothes. This hair resembles the down (enclosing the seeds) of our willows. It is very clean, fine, and soft; and they use it for making thread, ropes, cloth, and wadding.^^^ In culti
vating the fields, the people use also artificial irrigation by means of aqueducts. For drawing water they use a jar, which they bear on their heads. When they saw our Chinese pail for drawing water, they were much delighted.
Some Orientalists have identified ancient Almalik with A-li-ma-t'u of modern Chinese maps, now-a-days Verny, north of lake Issikul. But tliere can be no doubt that ancient Almalik was situated in the valley of the Hi river, not far from the present Kuldja. Semenolf, in his Russian translation of Ritter's "Asia," ii. 96, note, states that Almalik stood in the valley of the Hi river, about forty versts north-west of Kuldja. The late Professor Zakharoff (he died last year), who was Russian Consul at Kuldja when Mr, S. visited this place, told me that he communicated the above supposition to Mr. S. ; for he knew from hearsay that at a distance of seven versts from Suidun there were vast ruins of an ancient city. ^''3 This is probably the same as Carpini's Bisermini, a mutilation of the word Mussulman. See d'Avezac's learned notice regarding this appellation used by the Slaves (Carpini, 749, 750). In the ancient Russian annals the Bussurman are often mentioned, the Mussulmans being always meant. ^"^^ A Mongol word, darugachi, is rendered by these Chinese characters. According to Rashid-eddin, the Mongol governors were called claruga, which name is also found on ancient Persian coins of the Mongol period (d'Ohsson, iii. 410). Alma means " apple " in all the languages of Turkish origin. See also note 20. According to Dr. Regel, Suidun, near which place probably Almalik was situated (see note 172), is still famed for its apples and pears. See note 18. i''^ Tolma is still the name of a stuff in Eastern Turkestan.

''Cathay," lii. ; d'Ohsson, i. 203. The river Talas; for mo-lien is intended for niuren = river in'MongoL There is some confusion in the narrative. It is quite impossible that the travellers could make the distance from Almalik to the river Talas (see note 23), nearly 600 English miles, in four days. Mr. Lerch thinks that by the T a-la-su mo-lien, not the Talas, but the Chu river is meant. Mr. Schuyler {" Turkestan," i. 397) is of opinion that the diarist meant the Hi river, but by a slip of the pen called it Talas. It seems to me more simple to suppose that the traveller, in arranging the notes written down during the journey, inadvertently transposed some portion of the itinerary. This is evident from the fact that he notices the country of the Karakhitai (see farther on in the text) after the river Talas, whilst Ye-lU Ch'u tsai (see note 22) as well as Chang te (see the next itinerary) mention the Karakhitai before they arrived at the river (or city) Talas. Moreover, Rubruk, who proceeded through Central Asia from west to east, in accordance with the two Chinese travellers last spoken of, first notices the city of Talas, and then reached the country where formerly the Karakhitai dwelt. It is known that the residence of the Khans of the Karakhitai was situated on the Chu river (east of the Talas), of which Jiiention is made on Ch'ang ch'un's homeward journey. The distance given there between this river and Almalik is in accordance with the truth. Thus it is also easy to be understood why the diarist of Ch'ang ch'un's journey believes that the journey from the Talas river to Sairam, about 116 English miles, had taken a whole month, whilst he supposes that the distance from Almalik to the Talas, 600 miles, had been traversed in only four days. ^^'^ I am not prepared to say whether by this small town the city of Talas or Taras is to be understood. See also farther on, note 185.

in advance to announce to the emperor the arrival of the sage, while Chen-hai remained with the latter. Travelling again westward during seven days, we crossed a mountain, and met a Chinese envoy, who was returning to China.^^^ The envoy bowed before the tent of the master, who asked him : " When did you leave ? " The envoy answered: "I saw Chinghiz for the last time on the 1 2th of the seventh month (ist of August). The emperor is pursuing the Suan-tuan Han'^^^ to Yin-du (India)." Next day there was a great snowfall, and we reached a small town of the Hui-ho (Mohammedans). The snow was one foot deep, but was quickly melted by the sun. On the 1 6th of the tenth month (November i), 1221, we went in a south-western direction, crossed a river on a bridge of planks, and in the evening reached the foot of the southern mountains. Here were (formerly) the dominions of Ta shi Lin-ya, who was a descendant of the Liao}^^ As the armies of the Kin subdued the Liao, Ta shi Lin-ya with several thousand men withdrew to the north-west. After ten years' peregrination from one place to another, he finally reached this country. Here the climate is quite different from that of the regions north of the Yin shan (T'ien shan). The country has many plains, and the people are employed in agriculture and breeding of silkworms. They make wine from grapes. The fruits there are about the same as in China. It does not rain there during the whole summer and autumn; hence the fields are irrigated artificially by
canals led off from the rivers, and the corn is brought to

As has been shown in note 1 79, the account of the Karakhitai does not stand in its right place in the narrative. Regarding these Karakhitai or Western Liao, compare note 22. The river which Ch'ang ch'un crossed on a bridge of planks is probably the Chu river. Rubruk also (280) had to cross a great river in the country of the Karakhitai. See also note 540.

west low countries, which stretch out for ten thousand li}^^ This kingdom (of the Karakhitai) existed about a hundred years. As the power of the JVai man was broken (see note 98), they fled (i.e., Guchluk, the son of Tayank Khan, chief of this tribe) to the Ta shi Lin-ya, and after becoming powerful, overthrew that nation (the Karakhitai). Subsequently the suan-tuan (Sultan of Khovarezm) conquered the western part of their dominions. Then Chinghiz arrived; the Nai man (Guchluk) were totally destroyed, and the suan-tuan was also overthrown. We were informed that the way still before us presented many difficulties. One of our carts was broken, and we
were obliged to leave it behind. On the 1 8th of the tenth month (November 3) we travelled westward along the mountains. After seven or eight days' journey, the mountains suddenly turned to the south. We saw a city built of red stones, and there were the traces of an ancient military encampment. To the west we saw great grave-mounds, which resembled the tou sing (the constellation of Ursa major). Passing over a stone bridge,i^^ and travelling five days along the south
It seems that the above account of the country has also by a mistake been interpolated in the historical notices of the Karakhitai. It would better agree with the country farther west, near the Sir-daria. Schuyler believes that Ch'ang ch'un here crossed the Tolas river, and that his city built of red stones was the city of Tolas. He states, further, that the city mentioned by the Chinese traveller still exists there. But as Lerch in one of them found a stone with a Manchu inscription relative to a victory of the Chinese over the Dsungars in 1758, this identification has no value (Schuyler's "Turkestan," ii, 122). I am not prepared to decide whether Schuyler is right in conjecturing that the river T'a-la-su in Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary was not the Talas, but the Hi river, and that the river near the grave-mounds was the Talas. There is some confusion in the itinerary with respect to the succession of the geographical accounts given. There can, however, be no doubt that the Chinese traveller after leaving Almalik (near present Kuldja) crossed the Hi river ; it seems not far from Kuldja (see note 251), then probably proceeded to the spot where the modern Verny stands. Following the Alatau mountains to the west, he crossed them probably at the Kastek pass, on the route of the old post -road. (The new post- road, from Yerny to

But I followed the precepts of our master, who teaches that thoughts about dying and living ought not to perplex the mind of a man of the true doctrine (Taoist).

He crossed the Chu river very likely at the present Tokmak, and reached the foot of the Alexandrofsky range.

The post-road from Aulie-ata to Tashkend passes • near Sairam. Lerch (" Archseological Journey to Turkestan," 35) states that Sairam is the ancient Isfidjah of Ibn Haukal and other Arabic geographers. Kashid-eddin mentions Sairam, together with Talas, among the places inhabited by Turks ("Berezin," i. 2). Lerch (I. c, 35) comments upon this statement that the date given there does not correspond with the Mohammedan new year ; for the first day of the Hegiral year, 6i8, was February 24, 1221. Lerch thinks, and Wylie is of the same opinion, that Ch'ang cliun assisted at the festival of the "great Beiram," i.e., the conclusion of the fast of Ramazan. This festival fell on the 18th of November 1221. But the narrative says they held the festival on the 4th of the eleventh Chinese month (November 20). Wylie explains this by the fact that the Mohammedans were accustomed to determine the first day of the month, not by astronomical calculation, but by the time when they first got sight of the new moon.

The same name is applied to the river by Sultan Baber ("Memoires de Baber," trad. p. Pavet de Courteille, p. i). The laxartes is repeatedly mentioned in the Yiian shi, and always termed Ho- clean, or designated by similar sounding characters. In the " History of the T'ang," in the article on the kingdom of Shi or Che-chi (Shash, Tashkand), it is stated that south-west of it is the river Yao-sha (evidently the laxartes). Now-a-days this river, as is known, is called Syr-daria, or river Syr.

By his orders boys performed some plays, dancing with swords and climbing on poles. After this we passed two cities more, travelled half a day among mountains, and came out at a valley which stretched from south to north.^^* Here we passed the night under a splendid mulberry tree, which could cover with its shade a hundred men. Farther 'on we reached another city, and saw on the road a well more than a hundred feet deep, where an old man, a Mohammedan, had a bullock which turned the draw-beam and raised water for thirsty people. The emperor Chinghiz, when passing here, had seen this man, and ordered that he should be exempted from taxes and
duties. On the 1 8th of the eleventh month (December 3), 122 1, after crossing a great river, we arrived at the northern side

The traveller proceeding from Tashkend to Samarkand has to cross the mountain range bordering the Zarafshan basin to the north-east. He crosses it south-west of Djizak, in the defile known by the name of " Gate of Tamerlane." The travellers were now in the Zarafshan valley, stretching from south-east to north-west. The river crossed was the Zarafshan. Now-a-days the road from Djizak to Samarkand crosses it at the foot of the Chupan ata hill, six miles north-east of SamarJcand, which latter name the Chinese author renders by Sie-mi-sz -lean, or, more correctly, he intends Semiscant, by which name the city was also known in the Middle Ages. Compare Yule's "Cathay," 192. A bishop of Semiscant is mentioned in the
"Mirabilia" of Jordanus. We learn from Clavijo that Samarkand was also called Cimesquinte. In the Yiian shi Samarkand is termed Sie-mi-sz' -kan, and also Siin-sz'-kan.

" On our road, at a distance of about a thousand li, is a great river (the Amu river). I have been informed that the rebels have destroyed the floating bridge and the boats there. Besides this, we are now in the depth of winter. I think it would be better to wait and start in spring."

As it never rains in summer and autumn, the people have conducted two rivers to the city,^^^ and distributed the water
is an honorific title. Probably Ye-lii Cliu tsai, who was a K'i-tan, is meant. See introduction to the first narrative (p. 9). It is sure that since the days of the great Timur the site of the capital of Transoxiana has not changed ; but whether the city of Samarkand, destroyed in a.d. 1220 by Chinghiz Khan, stood on the same spot also, cannot be ascertained. There are vast ruins all around modern Samarkand, especially north and west of the city. The ruins in the north are known to the people by the name of Afrosiab, and are supposed to represent the Samarkand of early ages. Coins referring to a period previous to the Mongol occupation have occasionally been found there. As has been noticed above, the modern city of Samarkand lies about six miles south, or rather south-west, of the Zarafshan river, the Sogd river of the ancient Arabian and Persian geographers. At the Chupan ata hill, situated north-east of the city, and between it and the river, the latter divides, and from this spot runs westward in two channels, the Ak-daria and the Kara-daria, the first being the main river, the second, in the south, an artificial channel. Another watercourse passes about six miles south of Samarkand. This is the Angar aryTc, called also Bargam, an artificial channel diverted from the Tipper Zarafshan and joining the Kara-daria about sixteen miles west of Samarkand. Thus Samarkand lies in the middle of a large island formed by the Zarafshan and the aryks (channels) derived from it. The city itself is supplied with water by two rivulets which come from the south, and seem to be connected with the Dargam. These aryks, derived from the main river, and serving to irrigate the fields of the fertile Zarafshan valley, seem to be of very ancient date. Edrisi, ii. 197, 198, and Abulfeda, II. ii. 213, 219, describe in detail the system of irrigation in the valley of Sogd. Edrisi mentions the Dargam channel. As to the hill Chupan ata, which rises to an elevation of 480 feet above the level of Samarkand, Ibn Haukal (tenth century),

Before the dynasty of the suan-tuan (Saltan of Khovarezm) was overthrown, the city of Samarkand had a population of more than a hundred thousand families, but after the occupation only the fourth part remained behind.

Sultan Baber in his " Memoirs," i. 97, 98, terms the Zarafshan river Kuhik, and states that it passes north of Samarkand at a distance of two kuruh. Between it and the city, he says, is the Kuhik hill, from which the river derives its name. Baber notices also the Darr/ham channel passing south of Samarkand. There are several modern accounts of Samarkand and the Zarafshan valley published before and after the Russian occupation. IST. Khanykoff and A, Lehmann' visited Samarkand in 1841. Khanykoflf in his " Khanate of Bokhara " (in Russian) gives a map of Samarkand and environs. The same map was reproduced in 1865 in Petermann's " Geogr. Mitth.," tab. 8, Lehmann's account of his journey has been published, after his death, in voL xvii., 1852, of Baer and Helmersen's "Beitr. z. Kenntn. d. Russ. Reichs." In the " Zeitschr. d. Gesellsh. f. Erdkunde," Berlin, 1871, is a very valuable article on the Zarafshan valley, accompanied by a detailed map, by Dr. W. Radloff of the Academy of St. Petersburg. A paper on the same subject by Prof. Fedchenko has been translated into English in the "Journal of Roy. Geog. Soc," London, for 1870, with a map. Ifo si means the country west of the Yellow River. This was a Chinese name for the Tangut empire, partly subdued by Chinghiz in 121 8. See note 46. I am not prepared to say what hill and what river near it are meant. It does not seem that the Ckupan ata (see note 197) is intended. I may observe that, according to Khanykoff, Vambery, and others, the citadel of Samarkand, adjoining the city, is built on a hill. It includes the celebrated reception-hall of Timur and a palace of the Emir of Bokhara. Further on in the Chinese narrative it is stated that the hill with the palace was situated north of the river (perhaps an error of the diarist). This palace, in which Ch'ang ch'un was lodged, is also alluded to in the poems of Ye-lu CUu tsai (Palladius).

here, but as this part of the city had become insecure owing to numerous robbers, he had withdrawn to the northern side of the river. The master with his disciples then occupied the palace, declaring that Taoists have no fear. The T'ai shi furnished everything for the master's subsistence, and from day to day his veneration for him increased. We saw there peacocks and great elephants,^^^ which liad come from Yin-du (India), a country situated several thousand li to the south-east. The master remained ..for the winter in Samarkand, and the adjutant with several hundred soldiers proceeded to explore the road in advance. We had often visits of Chinese, who came to bow before the master. There was also an astronomer, whom the master asked about the eclipse, which had happened on the ist of the fifth month (see note 120). The astronomer said: "At this place (Samarkand), between seven and nine o'clock in the morning it was at its greatest, when six-tenths of the sun were eclipsed." The master then remarked that he observed the same eclipse on the river Lio kil, and just at noon it was total ; but that when he arrived in his journey to the south-west at the Ki7i shan (Altai mountains), the people told him that at that place the eclipse was at its greatest at ten o'clock in the morning, and seven-tenths of the sun were eclipsed. Thus the same eclipse was seen at different places in different aspects. Rung Ying ta^^'^ in his commentary on the CKun tsiu (Spring and Autumn Annals by Confucius), says : " When it happens that the moon stands opposite the sun, we have an eclipse ; but it is only observable for those who are straight under the moon. As regards those who are distant from this spot, the aspect of the eclipse changes for them at every thousand li. If one take, for instance, a fan, and put it before a light,

then a place will be seen entirely covered by the shadow ; whereas on the sides, where there is gradually more light, one is by degrees farther removed from the overshadowed place." At the end of the twelfth intercalary month (beginning of February), 1222, the adjutant returned from his exploration, and said to the master : " The second prince has moved out with his army, and the bridges have been repaired. I had sent to his encampment to inform him that the master intended to present himself to the emperor. The prince said that the emperor was then staying southeast of the Ta site shan,^^^ but that the road by which the master would be obliged to pass was covered with deep snow to an extent of about a hundred li. Therefore the prince invited the master to come to his encampment, and wait there for the favourable time for starting. The prince offered also to give the master a convoy of Mongol
soldiers." After Chung lu had finished his report, the master replied (declining the offer) : " I have heard that the country south of the (Amu) river is completely destitute of vegetable aliments ; and I use only rice, meal, and vegetables. Please express my excuse to the prince." In the first month (February and March), 1222, the ha-lan (trees) began to flower. The ha-lan (fruit) resembles small peaches, the fruit being gathered and eaten in autumn. The taste is like that of the hu t*ao (walnut).^^* On the 2d of the second month (March 15), the time of the equinox, the blossoms of the peach trees dropped. The astronomer Pang Li Kung and others invited the master to walk outside the city to the west. The adjutant and some officers accompanied us, and brought wine with them. The day was fine and the air delicious, the flowers and the trees were in their full freshness;

everywhere we saw lakes, orchards, terraces, towers, and tents. We lay down on the grass, and were all very happy together, talking about matters sublime. The 15th of the second month (March 28) was a holiday (in honour of Lao tsz\ the founder of the Tao sect). The officers begged the master again to take a walk with them west of the city. There were gardens and groves succeeding one another uninterruptedly to an extent of more than a hundred li. Even Chinese gardens cannot be compared (with those of Samarkand) ; '^'^^ but the gardens in that country are very quiet ; no singing of birds is heard there. At the beginning of the 3d month (middle of April) A-li-sicn-^^ arrived from the Emperor's encampment with the following decree : " Sainted man, thou hast arrived from the country wdiere the sun rises ; thou hast met with great difficulties in crossing mountains and plains ; indeed, thou hast taken great pains. I am now about to return, but I wait impatiently for thine explanation to me of the doctrine of the Tao. Do not delay meeting me." The adjutant, Chung he, received an imperial order: "Invite him to come. If you accomplish my wishes I shall reward you." The Emperor also gave an order to Chenhai: "Accompany and protect the master on his way; then you will experience my benevolence." Besides this, the iuan Jm (commander of ten thousand), Bo-hc-dji,^^'^ re
ceived an order to escort the master through the I^^on gate. The master inquired of A-li-sien about the way, who
All modern travellers who have visited Samarkand speak of the extensive gardens outside the walls, presenting many charming landscapes and picturesque sceneries. 206 This is, it seems, the same A-ll-sien who was sent by Udjulcin, the brother of Chinghiz, to Peking, to invite the master on the part of the Prince, and who, on that occasion, accompanied the master on his journey to the west. See p. 44. -^'^ This is probably the Burgudji or Burdjic mentioned by Kashid as one of the four heroes in Chinghiz' army, who commanded his lifeguards (d'Ohsson, i. 40 ; ir. 4, 457). These four heroes are also mentioned in the Yiian shi, chap, xcix., lifeguards, and have their separate biographers. Bu-lu-dji's biography is found in chap, cxix.

reported: "I left this place (Samarkand) on the 13th of the first month (February 23), and, after three days' travelling to the south-east, passed Tie men kiian (the Iron gate ; see note 211); five days later I crossed a great river (the Amu or Oxus). On the ist of the second month (March 13) I passed over the high snowy mountain (Hindukush), where the snow was very deep. By pushing in my whip I could only penetrate one half of the bed, even on the trodden path the snow lay five feet deep. Thence proceeding to the south, I arrived at the encampment of the Emperor.^^^ When I informed the Emperor of your arrival, he was much rejoiced. He ordered me to rest several days and then return." The master then set out on the 15th of the third month (April 26), leaving behind three of his disciples. He toolc five or six with him. Chung lu and the others accompanied him. After foar days' travelling w^e passed the
city of Kie-slii}^^ There Bo-lu-dji,^^^ who had previously received orders, escorted the master through the Tie men kuan-^'^ with a hundred Mongol and Mohammedan
Chingliiz was, at that time, south of the Hindukush, near Kabul. The city of Kash, south of Samarkand, the birthplace of Tamerlan, more commonly called Sliahr sabz (green city). On m^odern Russian maps the city is simply called Shahr. Under its ancient name, Kash, it is mentioned by Ibn Haukal in the tenth century (Abulfeda, II. ii. 218). But much earlier the name appears in Chinese works. The history of the Tang (section of foreign countries) mentions, in the seventh century, a little realm, Shi or Kii-sha, also Kie-shuang-na, situated 150 li east of Na-she-ho (Nakhsheb, now-a-days Karshi). Under the name of Kie-shuang-na, Kash is also spoken of in Hiian ts'ang's narrative of travel in the seventh century (Stan. Julien's "Mem. s. 1. Contr^es Occid.," i. 22, 23 ; ii. 283, 285). -^•^ Bo-lu-dji was probably stationed here to guard the defile of the Iron gate. Tie men kuan means Iron gate. The earliest notice of this defile, situated about 55 English miles south of Kash, we find again in Chinese works. The T'ie men kuan is mentioned, in the Tang shu, in connection with the realm of Kii-sha or Kash (see note 209). Hiian tsang gives
the following account of it : — "From Kie-shuang-na (Kash), going southwest 200 li, the way leads through mountains with difficult passages. There are no people or villages, and little water or vegetation. Then going 300 li south-east the Iron gates are reached.* It is a narrow defile

soldiers. We crossed the mountains in a south-eastern direction, and found them very high. Masses of rocks were lying scattered about. The escort themselves pulled
formed by two parallel mountains, which rise on each side perpendicularly and have the colour of iron. There are in the defile folding gates strengthened with iron and furnished with many iron bells hung up. Because of these circumstances and of the strength and difficulty of this pass, it has received the name of Iron gate. Here, at the Iron gate, is the northern boundary of the kingdom of T'u-huo-Io (Tokharestan)." According to the Yiian shi (annals suh anno 1224), Chinghiz advanced as far as Eastern Yin-du (Hindostan), and met at Tie men kuan, the Jciie tuaii (upright horn), a strange animal which advised the conqueror to go back and cease his conquests. The earliest Mohammedan author who mentions the Iron gate, and under its Persian name, dar-i-ahan (Iron gate), is the Arab geographer Yakubi (end of the ninth century). According to him, it is the name of a town. Ihn Haulcal (tenth century) gives an itinerary from Nassaf (the same as Nakhshab or Karshi) to Termed, in which the Iron gate appears. Edrisi (twelfth century) locates at the Iron gate a small well-peopled town. The Iron gate is repeatedly mentioned in the Persian works on the history of Timur. Sherif-eddin gives (" Petis de la Croix," iii. 173), the itinerary of the route followed by Timur when he returned with his army from the Indian campaign in spring 1398. After having crossed the Amu river, he remained two days in Termed, and then set out for Kash. The first day he halted for the night at the Kishlak (winter residence) oE Jehan Shah ; on the second, at the bath of Turki ; on the third day he passed through the Koluga, or Iron gate, and halted for the night on the river Barik. On the fourth day he arrived at Jigdalik ; on the fifth, at Kuzimondak ; on the sixth, at Duz Bildjen, where Timur was met by his son, Shah Rukh, On the seventh he halted at a brook, and on the eighth day entered Kash. Sultan Baber in his Memoirs terms the Iron gate also Koluga (i. 56, 269). It was not till the beginning of the fifteenth century that a European traveller saw the Iron gate. CLavijo, on his journey as the ambassador of Henry III. of Castile to the court of Timur in 1404, crossed the Oxus at Termed. He left this place on the 22d of August, and slept in the plain. On the 23d they travelled over extensive plains, amongst many wellpeopled villages. On the 24th they dined in a great building, where Timur on this route used to halt, but continued their march and slept on a plain near the banks of a river. On the 25th they dined at the foot of a very lofty mountain, where there was a handsome house, ornamented with very fine brjckwork, &c. Over these mountains led a pass called the Iron gate. The ravine through which it goes looks as if it had been artificially cut, and the mountains rise to a great height on either side, and the pass is smooth and very deep. In the centre of the pass there is a village, and the mountain rises to a great height behind. In all the mountain range there is no other pass besides the Iron gate, so that it

guards the land of Samarkand in the direction of India. This gate produces a large revenue to the Lord Tiinur Beg, for all merchants who come from India pass this way. These mountains of the Iron gate are without woods. They say that in former times there were great gates covered with iron placed across the pass, so that no one could pass without an order. The same day they went on, and passed the night in the open on a hill. On the next day, after they had taken their siesta in the vicinity of a nomad camp by a stream, they again halted in the evening on a range of hills, and after a short repose started again at midnight, and so arrived at the great city of Kash on the 28th August ("Narrative of Clavijo's Embassy to Timur," translated by R. Markham, 1859. Hakluyt Society, pp. 1 19-123). After Clavijo, for 471 years no European traveller had planted his steps on this road, when in 1875 a Russian scientific expedition visited the Iron gate. This expedition, headed by Major Mayeff, which had for its object the exploration of the mountainous country of Hissar and of the northern affluents of the Upper Oxus, first followed the road from Karshi to Baisun. After passing the broad Chakcha valley, they beheld in front of them the gorge so famoiTS under the name of the Iron gate, known now to the natives as the Buzgola kliana (goat-house). Not far from the northern entrance of the pass the road from Shahr Sabz (Kash) and that from Karshi join. P. Lerch wrote in the " Russische Revue " of 1875 a short report of the Hissar expedition, accompanied with very interesting notes, especially regarding the Iron gate. Colonel Yule presented an English translation of this article in the " Geographical Magazine " of 1875. Some of the above details have been borrowed from this paper. ' In 1878 the Russian military mission to the Emir of Afghanistan, headed by General Stoletoff, passed through the Iron gate. Dr. Yavorsky, the physician of that mission, in his " Travels into Afghanistan and Bu
khara," i. 72, gives some details regarding this pass. A much-detailed description of the same, drawn from the report of the Hissar expedition, is found in Kostenko's "Turkestan," ii. 122, 123. The precise site of it is given in the great Russian map of Turkestan. It is about one and a half English miles long, and stretches from north-west to south-east. It is, as it were, a rent across the mountain, which here forms a watershed. This picturesque defile, bordered on both sides by high rocks, is at the most thirty paces wide, in some places only five paces. The Chakcha river runs through it, and leaving the northern issue, turns northward. Beyond the southern issue of the pass is the streamlet Shurab, which discharges, it seems, farther south into the Shirabad daria. Here the roads divide. The principal road turns eastward to Derbend, about five English miles distant from the ssue, and leads to Baisun and Hissar ; whilst a difficult bridle-path branches off in a southern direction, and leads to Shirabad and to the Amu river.

The road from the Iron gate south to Shirabad and to the Amu river leads along the Shirabad daria river, through a mountainous country with difficult ascents and defiles. The small river vi^hich Ch'ang ch'un crossed in a boat was evidently the Shirabad, a northern affluent of the Amu. 213 ip^ie Amu river or Oxus. As has been stated before, muren = xiwev in Mongol. -^^ These two characters, in Chinese, denote reed. But I am inclined to suppose that the Chinese traveller saw the tall round stems of the asafoetida plant {Scorodosma fcetidum), and took them to be reeds. This plant is very common in Central Asia, and just in the regions Ch'ang ch'un passed through. The erect stem of this plant is five to seven feet high, nearly naked, with the umbels collected at the summit. Mayeff reports that the people in the valley of the Wakhsh (Upper Oxus) use the stems of this plant for making fences. See also Schuyler's " Turkestan," i. 228. The Chinese carts have only two wheels, and when not used, two sticks are placed perpendicularly beneath the ends of the shafts to prevent them touching the ground. -^^ Schuyler ("Turkestan," i. 323) notices enormous lizards {Stellio Lehmanni) in the steppes and gravelly plains near the Syr-daria, about four feet long and of a dark greyish-brown colour, greatly resembling a small crocodile.

to the Emperor, who greeted him, and said : " You were invited by the other courts (the Kin and the Sung ; see note 79), but you refused. Now you have come to see me, having traversed a road of ten thousand li. I am much gratified." The master answered: "The wild man of the mountains (see note 99) came to see the emperor by order of your majesty; it was the will of Heaven." Chinghiz invited him to sit down, and ordered a meal to be set before him. After this he asked : " Sainted man, you have come from a great distance. Have you a medicine of immortality ? " The master replied : " There are means for preserving life, but no medicines for immortality." Chinghiz lauded him for his sincerity and candour. By imperial order two tents were pitched for the master east of the emperor's tents. The emperor
gave him the title of shen sien (the Idi mortal). At the beginning of the hot season the master went with the emperor to the snowy mountains, to pass the
summer there.^^^ The 14th of the fourth month (May 25), 1222, was fixed for explaining the doctrine of the Tao (true doctrine) to the emperor; but just as the time arrived, news was
^^"^ According to Rashid-eddin, Chinghiz spent the summer of 1222 in the plain of Beruan or Peruan, where in the spring of 1 221 a battle had been fought between the Mongols and the Sultan Djelal-eddin (d'Ohsson, i. 300, 301, 317). The Yiian shi (annals) states : " The emperor, in order to avoid the great heat of the summer, moved to the river (valley) of Ba-luwan." Parioan is still the name of one of the elevated defiles in the Hindukush, between Kabul and the Anderab valley. There is also a river and a little town of that name, visited by Father Goes in 1603 on his way from Kabul to Badakhshan, &c. (Yule's " Cathay," 558, and map appended). Peruan is already mentioned by Ibn Khordadbeh (ninth centviry) among the cities depending on Bamian (Sprenger's "Postrouten des Orientes," 37). Sultan Baber in his "Memoirs" (i. 285) states that the pass of Parwan is very difficult, and that betAveen this place and the great col there are seven minor defiles. He reports also (i. 2S0) that the wind blowing during the summer in Kabul is known under the name of " wind of Parwan." The Turkish admiral, Sidi Ali, on his way from Kabul to Badakhshan in 1556, passed by the Parvan pass and then
reached the city of Andera (Anderab). See " Journal Asiatique," ix. 203. Compare also about Parwan, Wood's "Journey to the Oxus," 1838, and note 671 below.

received that tlie Mohammedan rebels in the mountains \Yere about to renew hostilities. The emperor decided himself to attack the enemy. Therefore the day for the master's explanations was postponed until the 1st of the tenth month, which was a felicitous day. The master begged permission to return (to Samarkand), but the emperor said : Will you not be too much fatigued to make the journey a second time ? " The master replied : "It is only twenty days' journey;" but the Emperor objected : " There is nobody to escort you." The master answered : There is a man, Yang Akou, who has received orders to go with me." The emperor then assented, and after three days he gave orders that Yang Akou should take a thousand horsemen and conduct the master back by another way (than that he had come).^^^ Proceeding on this way, we crossed a high mountain, in which is the SJd men (Stone gate), and at a distance the rocks had the appearance of candles. An immense slab lay across these rocks, like a bridge, and beneath was a rapid torrent. Many of the soldiers' donkeys were drowned in crossing this torrent, and on its borders many dead bodies were seen lying. This defile had been taken by the armies a short time before we passed.'^^^ On our way we saw men returning from the war, who carried with them a great many corals. Some of our

Chen-hai remained with the emperor. Dr. Yavorsky ("Journey to Afghanistan," i. 72) was struck by the resemblance the description of the Stone gate in the Chinese narrative bears to the Nandagan pass, English miles north of Shirabad. But this identification is untenable. The diarist states expressly that Ch'ang ch'un did not return by the same way he came ; and besides this, the sage, in one of his poems, alludes to the position of the Stone gate being south of the Amu river. It seems to me that the way now followed by Cii ang ch'un from the Hindukush to Samarkand lay more to the west. He passed probably partly by the same route as Burnes in 1832 from India to Bokhara. This traveller, in describing his way down the north-western slope of the Hindukush, gives about the same details as noticed in the Chinese narrative with respect to the Stone gate.

place) we arrived at Sie-mi-sz-'kan, or as the city is called by the Ta sJii (Karakhitai), Ho chung fu (the city between the rivers).^^^ The officers came to meet the master, and directed him to his former lodging (in the new palace ; see note 119), which was situated on the northern side of the river. This river (the Zarafshan) has its sources in the snowy mountains (east of Samarkand), therefore its water is very cold. The palace in which the master lived was
on a hill about a hundred feet in height.^^^ It was
reflected in the bright water of the river. In the fifth month (June and July), during the hot season, the master was accustomed to sit at the northern window and enjoy the breeze, while at night he slept on the terrace of the roof ; and in the sixth month (July-August), the hottest time of the year, he bathed in the basin. Thus the master spent his time in the far west. Tlie arable land in Ho clmng (Samarkand) is suitable for all kinds of corn.

But it may be also that the appellation Ho clmng fu for Samarkand refers to the position of the city between the Zarafshan and the channels diverted from it. See note 197. Palladius reports that Ye-lil CKu tsai, in one of his poems, says that the Si Ziao or Kharakhitai called Samarkand llo chung fu. -^^ See note 199. 223 Persia it is the custom, up to this time, to sleep during the hot season on the flat roofs in the open air.

The women of the chieftains and the rich envelop their heads with a piece of gauze, from five to six feet long, and of a black or dark red colour. Sometimes flowers and plants or other figures are embroidered upon it. They wear their hair dishevelled. Sometimes they put wadding under it (under the covering of the head?). The women of the lower classes do not braid their hair into a queue on the top of the head. They cover their heads with linen and other stuff, and thus bear some resemblance to our (Buddhist) nuns.

The superior above sings in a loud tone, and the men and women, hearing his voice, meet at this place and pray below. The same custom exists throughout the whole country. AVhoever neglects to perform these ceremonies is executed. The superior is dressed like the others, only his head is wrapped with a piece of white mo-sz (muslin). In the seventh month, as the new moon had just appeared (August 8, 1222), the master sent A-li-sien with a report to the emperor, asking about the time for the explanation of the doctrine of Tao. The answer of the emperor, written on the same report, was received on the /til of the eighth month (September 13). On the 8th of the same month (September 14) we set out for the emperor's encampment. The Tai sM accompanied the master twenty or thirty li, and returned. On
the 1 2th (September 18) we passed the city of Kie-slii (Kash; see note 209). On the 13th we were joined by a convoy of 1000 men on foot and 300 on horseback, and entered the high mountains. The route we followed now went round the Tie men huan (Iron gate). We crossed a river with red water, and proceeded through a defile to the south-east, where there were rocks several li in height. At the foot of the mountains is a salt spring, the water of which deposits white salt after evaporation. We took a large quantity of it with us. Farther to the south-east we ascended a mountain which forms a watershed. To the west we saw a high valley, which seemed to be filled up with ice, but it was salt. On the top of the mountain there was a red-coloured salt, with the appearance of

even in winter.^^^ Poor men sell water in jars.^^^ On the 14th of the eighth month (September 20) we arrived at the south-western foot of the Iron gate. Here
the issue of the defile is bordered by terrible rocks. One on the left has fallen down, and the river to an extent of a li was covered by rocks.^^^ On the 15th (September 21) we arrived at the river (the Amio river again).^^^ It resembles the Yellow River in China, and runs in a north-western direction. Having crossed it in a boat, we stopped on the southern bank. To the west there is a mountain fortress called T'uan ha
Schuj^ler (" Turkestan," ii. 79) states that near Karshi are the mines of that peculiar, excellent, rose-coloured rock-salt which is largely sold throughout the whole of Central Asia, and that this salt is obtained in the mountains about ten miles south of Karshi. Mayeff (Hissar expedition) and Kostenko (" Turkestan," iii. 161, 162) report that the mines of the rosecoloured rock-salt are situated in the Bashhhurd mountains, in the district of Hussar. See also M. Polo, i. 160 : "Salt mountains south of Telekan." 2"^^ The Chinese do not like water ; they prefer drinking tea even in the hot season. It is still the custom in Persia that water and ice are sold on the roads to thirsty travellers. 23^Burnes notices similar phenomena in the Hindukush, and attributes them to earthquakes. 2-^9 It is difficult to trace Ch'ang ch'un's route from Kash to the Amu river on his second journey. The narrative states expressly that they did not go by the shortest way, through the Iron gate, but turned round it. The assertion, then, that they arrived farther on at the south-western foot of this defile, is a mistake. The diarist may have taken the entrance of another pass to be the Iron gate. From the statement about the rock-salt in the mountains they passed through, we may conclude that their way lay through the Hussar district, and west of the Iron gate. There is a road, explored by Russian travellers, from Kash (Shahr) to Hussar, and then through a mountainous country with many difficult passes to Kelef on the Amu daria (Kostenko's " Turkestan," ii. 131). There is yet another road, still more westward, leading from Samarkand through Karshi to Kelef. The diarist is also mistaken, it seems, in stating that their journey from Kash to the Amu river took only three days. The distance is about 130 English miles.

Chen-Jcun, the physician of the third prince (Ogotai). We proceeded up the stream (in a boat) ; but after thirty li the water was too shallow, when (we went on shore, and) travelling during the night, we passed Ban-li,^^'^ a very large city, the inhabitants of which had revolted not long ago, and lied. We heard the barking of the dogs in the city. At daybreak, after taking breakfast, we went to the east more than twenty U to a river running northward, which could be forded on horseback, and passed the night on the eastern bank of this river. On the 22d of the eighth month (September 28) Chenhcci^^- came to meet the master, and accompanied him to the emperor's encampment. On his arrival Chen-hai asked the master whether he wished to be introduced immediately to the emperor, or to rest first. The master begged to be presented. It must be said here that the
professors of the Tao (true doctrine), when admitted to an audience, were never required to fall upon their knees or to bow their heads to the ground. On entering the imperial tent, they only made a bow and placed the hands together (a sign of esteem among Chinese monks).
-^^ Ba-la stands for "balik," city. I have little doubt that by the city of T'uan, the fortress Kerduan is meant, which, according to E,ashid, offered resistance to the Mongols for a whole month (d'Ohsson, 1. 294). After its capture Chinghiz crossed, as the Persian historiographer reports, the
Hindukush and besieged Bamian. A more precise indication of the position of Kerduan is not given. Ch'an ch'un did not pass by this place. The travellers only heard of it. Ye-lil CKu tsai in his narrative of travel mentions a city called Chuan situated west of Ban (Balkh). This seems to be the same as Tuan. The Chinese character cJiuan is easily miswritten for tuan. ^^^Ban-li is the city of Balkh. Ye-lii CKu tsai (see note 37) has only the character Ban for Balkh. The Yiian shi, in reporting the capture of Balkh by the Mongols, writes the name Ban-le-ho. On the Chinese mediaeval map the name is more correctly spelt Ba-li-ho. According to Rashid, Balkh was taken by Chinghiz in 1 22 1. Most of the inhabitants were massacred (d'Ohsson, i. 272). See note 218. Chinghiz then had left the Hindukush, and was somewhere north of it, three days' journey from the Oxus, as appears from the narrative farther on.

The master was then presented to the emperor, who ordered tung lo to be set before him ; but the master firmly refused to drink it. The emperor asl^ed him how he was supplied with victuals in the city where he lived (Samarkand) ; when the master expressed his satisfactioD, Next day the emperor sent a man to invite the sage to dine every day with his majesty. The master replied : " I am a wild man of the mountains ; I cultivate the true doctrine (Tao), and therefore I like seclusion." The emperor then permitted him to live as he liked. On the 27th of the -eighth month (October 3) the emperor set out on his return to the north (and the master accompanied him). The emperor on the road often sent wdne made from grapes, water-melons, and other eatables to the master. On the ist of the ninth month (October 6), 1222, we crossed the river (Amu) on a floating bridge, and proceeded to the north. On the 15th (October 20), at the suggestion of the mas
The Chinese characters tung lo denote, according to the dictionaries, preparations from mare's or cow's milk, as kumis, sour milk, &c. The kumis, a fermented liquor made by the Mongols and other nomades of Asia from mare's milk, was their habitual drink in the Middle Ages, and earlier, as now-a-days, M. Polo (i. 249) calls it kemiz. Rubruk (227, 228) gives a detailed description of the preparation of cosmos, as he terms this beverage. He notices also a special kind of it, called cava cosmos or black cosmos, prepared for the use of the rich (unknown now-adays). In the Yiian shi, chap, cxxviii., biography of the Kipchak prince Tu-t\i-ha, it is stated that "black mare's milk" (evidently the cara cosmos of Rubruk), very pleasant to the taste, used to be sent from Kipchak to the Mongol court in China. Rubruk (229, 234) describes another preparation, curd dried in the sun, &c.. which he calls griut, gruit, or grut. The latter is, it seems, the right reading, for Potanin ("Mongolia," ii. 1 12), in describing the different preparations of milk, which form the principal food of the Mongols, states that Jcwt (Pallas writes hurut) in the Kirghiz language denotes a kind of cheese formed into hard cakes. The Mongols call the same arul. Rubruk, 240: "Dederunt nobis bibere (Tartari) de lacto suo vacino, a quo contractum erat butiriim, acetoso valde, quod ipsi vocant airam.'"

A-Jiai -^^ translated the words of the master into Mongol for the emperor. The emperor was highly edified, and the discourse of the sage pleased his heart. On the iQtli (October 24) the night was bright, and the emperor called the master again to continue his explanations, with which he was much satisfied. On the 23d the master was again invited. The emperor ordered his words to be written down in Chinese as well as in Mongol. After this we followed the emperor in his march to the east (i.e., back to Mongolia), and approaching the great city of Sie-mi-sz-Jcan (Samarkand), encamped twenty li west of it. On the first of the lOth month (November 5) the master solicited permission to visit the place where he lived before (the palace on the hill near Samarkand), which the emperor granted. The imperial camp then was thirty li east of Samarkand. On the 6th the master appeared again before the emperor, together with the councillor A-hai (who was the interpreter). Chinghiz asked the master : " Shall the bystanders withdraw ? " to which he replied that they might remain, and explained to the emperor as follows
:
" The wild man of the mountains these many years has devoted himself to the investigation of Tao, and likes to be in solitude. Around the tent of your majesty I hear the noise of your soldiers, and I cannot keep my mind quiet ; therefore I solicit from your majesty the permission to travel henceforth alone, in advance or behind. This will be a great favour to the wild man of the mountains." The emperor assented. At that time (November) rain first began to fall, and the grass became green again. In that country, in the middle of the eleventh month (December), rain and snow became more frequent and moistened the ground. The
A-hai is mentioned in the Yiian shi, chap, ex., as T'ai shi or councillor.

master went to Samarkand and distributed the remainder of his provisions to the hungry people, who were very numerous. On the 26th of the eleventh month (December 29), 1222, we set out on our journey. On the 23d of the 12th month (January 25, 1223) there was a snowfall, and such an intense cold that a great number of our bullocks and horses died on the road. Proceeding to the east, we crossed three days later (January 28) the Ho-cKan mulien (Syr-daria ; see note 189), and reached the encampment of the emperor (who was also on his homeward journey). We were told there that during the past night the bridoe across the river had been broken down and
carried away. (Chinghiz again had discourses with the sage, but I omit them as being of no interest.) On the ist of the first month (Chinese new year, February 2, 1223) the master took leave. The commanderin-chief, the physician-in-ordinary, and the diviner-inchief came to congratulate the master. On the nth (February 12) we proceeded again eastward. Sie-mi-sz'-kan was now behind us, at a distance of more than a thousand li. On the 21st (February 22) we went to the east of one station, and arrived at a broad val
ley (plain) well watered and rich in grass,^*^ where we stayed for some time, in order to restore our tired horses and bullocks. Sai-lan (Sairam) is three days' journey from this place to the north-east. On the 7th of the second month (March 9) the master was admitted to an audience and said to the emperor : " At the time the wild man of the mountains left the seashore (Shan tung), he gave his word to be back again in three years. It is indeed my ardent desire to see my native mountains again in this third year." The emperor replied : " I am myself returning to the east. Will not you go with

He solicited earnestly to be sent home ; but the emperor refused his assent, saying : " Wait a little ; in three or five days my sons will arrive ; there are still some points in your doctrine not quite clear to my mind. Having understood all, I will not object to your going home." On the 8th the emperor was hunting in the mountains to the east, and in shooting a boar he was thrown from his horse. The wounded boar stopped, and the emperor was in danger. (I omit Cli ang cli un's conversation with Chinghiz about the necessity of desisting from the pleasure of hunting at his advanced age.)^^^ On the 24th of the second month the master ventured again to solicit his being sent home; but the emperor said : " Wait a little. I must think over the presents to give you on your departure ; " so he was again obliged to remain. But on the 7th of the third month (April 8) he renewed his request, when the emperor made him a present of bullocks and horses. The master refused, saying that post-horses would be sufficient for him ; and the emperor granted a decree, with the imperial seal, which released all professors of the doctrine of Tao from taxes. He ordered A-li-sien to accompany the master on his journey to the east, appointing him silan cliai (imperial envoy). Meng-gu-dai and Go-la-ha-hai were appointed his assis
tants. On the loth of the third month (April 11), 1223, the master finally took leave of the emperor, and we started

In three days we arrived at Sai-lan (Sairam ; see note 1 86), In the mountains south of the city there are twoheaded snakes, two feet long, which are frequently seen by
the'natives.^^^ On the 15th (April 16) the disciples of the master went
out of the city to sacrifice at the tomb of the disciple who died there (on the journey hither). We spoke about carrying with us his mortal remains, but the master said : The body, formed temporally of the four elements, decays without any value ; but the soul has a real existence, is free, and cannot be grasped." Then we spoke no more about that, and the next day we started again (April 17). On the 23d of the third month (April 24) we were joined by the imperial envoy A-gotc (who had received orders) to accompany the master on his journey along the southern bank of the CJiioi mu-Uen}^^ Ten days later we were at a distance of more than a hundred li west of A li ma (Almalik; see note 172), and crossed a large river.^^^ On the 5th of the fourth month (May 5), having arrived
at a garden east of the city of A li ma, Chang hung, the
Levshin in his work on the Kirghiz-Kaisaks (i. 143), enumerating the snakes of those regions, concludes with the statement that the superstitious fancy of the people adds to this list certain two-headed snalces. It is well known that the steppes of Russian Turkestan, and especially those bordering on the Syr-daria, swarm with serpents. Compare Schuyler's " Turkestan," i. 231, about the serpent-defile between Jisak and Samarkand. One of the serpents, the Ei^yx jacidus, which has been called also Boa tatarica, is characterised by a short obtuse tail and a small head. This resemblance of the tail to the head may have been the basis of the popular conception regarding two-headed snakes. -50 Mu-lien — muren, river in Mongol. The CJiui river of the Chinese author is evidently the Cliu of modern maps of Turkestan. This river rises in the T'ien shan, south-west of the Issikul lake, passes near this lake, at a distance of only four miles from its western corner ; farther on, in the plain, it flows in a north-western direction, and finally discharges into the lake Sauman kul. As has been noticed in note 185, the old road from Pishpek to Vernoye, which crosses the Chu river at Tokmak, and by which probably Ch ang ch'un proceeded, has been abandoned since these tracts belonged to Russia. The new post-road crosses the river about forty English miles downward. This can only be the Hi river.

bridges, and proceeded fifty li up the torrent to the Heavenly lakeP^ Thence we went in a north-eastern direction, crossed the
Yin slian (i.e., a branch of it), and after two days' journey, came to the same post-road which we had followed on our journey hither, and which leads south of the Kin shan (Altai) to a great river. Then proceeding from south to north, we passed to the eastern side of the Kin shan.^^^ On the 28th of the fourth month (May 28) there was a great snowfall, and the next day all the mountains around were white. We then went in a north-eastern direction along mountains, and in three days reached the front side of the A-hu-han mountain (see note 146). The disciples (left by Ch'ang cli un here in a new-built monastery) and the others came a long distance to meet the master, and directed him to the monastery Si hia laian. Just as the
master .got out of his cart it began to rain, when all were very glad and congratulated each other, saying : " In this country it very seldom rains in summer ; rain and thunder rarely happen except in the mountains to the south and
Chinghiz' second son, Chagatai. The Persian historians state that the dominions of Chagatai stretched from the country of the Uigurs and Kayalik west as far as the Djihun (Amu-daria), and that he liked to pass the summer at AlmaliJc, near the high mountains Guk and Kut. In winter he used to live at a place called Meruzik ila (d'Ohsson, ii. 2, 107), These statements relate to a time posterior to Chinghiz ; but Chagatai had his appanages near Almalik already in his father's lifetime. 253 The Sairam lake ; see note 167.

their fields and gardens by means of aqueducts.^^^ In the eighth month (September) wheat ripens, and there is then no rain. At the time the corn ripens it is damaged by mice (or rats) ; these mice are all white. In this country cold predominates, and the fruits ripen late in the year. In the fifth month (June) we found on the borders of the river, at a depth of about one foot, ice in the ground about a foot thick ; and the master sent his servants every day after dinner to bring some.^^^ To the south a high mountain range is to be seen, covered with masses of snow, which never melts even in the hottest season of the year.^^^ There are many remarkable things in this country. A

The same author {Ibid., 21, 30, 80) states that in North-Western Mongolia agriculture is carried on in many places, even by the Mongols (Durbots, Torguts). See also Potanin's "Mongolia," i. 81. Although it is impossible to determine the place where Ch'ang ch'un, on his homeward journey, stopped for the second time, and where, since his first visit there, in remembrance of it, a monastery had been built, there can be no doubt that this oasis, fit for agricultural purposes, must be looked for in the elevated desert which extends between the Altai and the Khangai range. The Dsapkhan is the only river of note on this plateau. It discharges into the Kirghiz nor, and is connected with two other great lakes. Its borders in some places are rich in pastures. Matussowsky in 1 8 70, and
Pevtsoff in 1878 and 1879, traversed this desert in several directions. Its elevation is from 3500 to 6000 feet. This explains the statement of our Chinese traveller that even in June they found ice in the ground. The Lamaitic monastery of Narhandji, on the Dsapkhan, was found by Pevtsoff [1. c, 40, 275) to be at an elevation of 5160 feet.

Elias {" Journey to Western Mongoba," 131) speaks of the Mongoban gales. Compare on the same subject Potanin {I. c, 63, 100, 151), who describes well the whirlwinds so frequently met in Mongolia. Przewalsky, in his "Tibet," 32, explains the causes of the furious gales in Mongolia in winter. Morgan, in his translation of Przewalsky's "Journey to the Lob nor," 199, reports that the Tartars and Kirghizes (in Dsungaria) have a legend that the hurricanes in their country issue from some caverns which the Kalmuks have in vain tried to fill up with stones ; thus the same story as that related by the Chinese traveller. Comp. also note 316. 260 PevtsoflE {I. c, 21, 30) notices coal-mines in the mountains about 100 versts south-east of Kobdo. 261 Pevtsoff {I. c, 243) reports a similar phenomenon with respect to the rivers Kungui and Mukkur-kungui. The first discharges into the Airik lake, formed by the Dsapkhau, the other into the salt lake Khara nor. The sources of these rivers, which rise north-west of Uliassutai, at a distance of about ten English miles one from the other, are formed by springs issuing from the sand. Pevtsoff was told by the Mongols that their actual sources are in a mountain situated between them. But the water soon disappears in the earth, and after running for some distance underground, springs forth again from the sands. This is without doubt the country Kemkemdjut, mentioned by Rashid as contiguous to the dominions of the Kirghizes (d'Ohsson, i. 103). Kem

Chinese live there, and carry on the business of manufac
turing different kinds of silk and other stuffs. From the monastery (of Si hia kuan) the Kin shan (Altai) is visible, where much hail falls (see note 130). In the fifth and sixth months there is more than ten feet of snow. On the northern slopes of the Kin shan there are pines about a hundred feet high. The land is interspersed with deserts. In this country the jo20 tsung jitng grows. The natives (Mongols) call this plant so-yen. In their language water is called wu
su, and grass ai-hu-sic}^^ The assembled people said to the master : " This country
kemdjut was situated on the Kem river or Upper Yenissei. Even now-adays the tribes living on the Yenissei call it Kevi, which means a river. The main river is called Ulu kem (great river), one of the affluents KemchiJc (small river). At the embouchure of the latter there is still a place known as Kemhemdjih. Kemkemdjik is mentioned in the Yiian shi under the name of K'ien chou. In chap. Ixiii. there is an article devoted, to the Ki-li-ki-sz (Kirghizes), in which it is said that K'ien chou, forming the south-eastern part of the dominions of the Kirghizes, derives its name from the river K'ien. This river is repeatedly mentioned in the Yiian shi. The name is sometimes also written Kien. By the same name (Kien was pronounced Kim in ancient times) the Upper Yenissei was already known to the Chinese in the seventh century. The T'ang history has a long article on the Hia-Tcia-sz' (or Kia-kia-sz'), the ancestors of the Kirghizes, and living in the same country, and there the Kien river is noticed. It is stated, among other things, that the country produces millet, barley, wheat, and that the people usually pay the taxes in sable and squirrel skins. Colonel Yule identifies the Kien-kien-chou of the Chinese and Kemkemdjut of Rashid with the region Chingintalas of M. Polo (i. 214, ii. 538). I may finally state that the forests on the Upper Yenissei still abound in sables and squirrels. -^2 Tatarinoff in his " Catal. Medicam. Sin." calls the drug with the above
name Orobanche prceparata. A drawing of it with description is given in
Ganger's " Repertorium fiir Pharmacie, &c. in Russland," vii. (1848) : Chines. Roharzneiwaaren. I have seen the plant in question. It is an enormous Phelipea (order Orobanchacese), about one foot long, the stem from two to three inches thick. This succulent plant is brought from Mongolia to Peking in a salted state. It gives out a disagreeable smell. The Chinese materia medica quotes an author of the Mongol period, who notices a Mongolian drug so-yang (evidently the same as soyen in the narrative), and states that this is a kind of jou tsung jung, under which name an orobanche is described in the same work. In modern Mongol, water is wusu, and grass uhusu.

here is in a state of deep barbarism. From the most remote time the people have never heard of the true doctrine. "We had only to do with the charms of mountain goblins and other bad spirits ; but ever since the master founded a monastery here, there has been a service established. On the first and the fifteenth of every month the people have assembled and have taken a vow not to kill living creatures. Certainly that was an effect of the true doctrine (Tao) ; what else could have produced this change ? At first the Taoists here had much to complain of the malice of bad men, and were not left quiet. There was the physician Lo sheng, who always tried to annoy the Taoists and to injure them. But once passing by the Taoist temple, he was thrown from his horse and broke his leg. Then he was moved to repentance, owned that he was punished for his sins, and begged pardon." A-li-sien and the others said to the master : " The southern route has much sand and is very stony ; little grass and water are found there. Our travelling company is numerous; the horses will be extremely fatigued, and we have to fear many delays on the road." The master replied: "Then it would be better to start in
three parties."
On the /th of the fifth month (June 6), 1223, he sent six of his disciples in advance, and started himself with six disciples on the 14th (June 13). He was accompanied for twenty li by the most respectable people of the place; then they got down from their horses, bowed before the master and shed tears. The master spurred on his horse and departed quickly. On the i8th the
remaining five disciples set out. Proceeding eastward, on the i6th (June 15) the master
Ch'ang ch'un, leaving the place where he now sojourned, returned to China by the direct way, crossing the great Mongolian desert in a southeastern direction, which road led him to the present KukuTchoto [Kui hua ch'eng).

Proceeding to the south-east, we crossed a great sandy plain, where we found grass and trees infested with mosquitos. We passed the night on the eastern bank of a river. Farther on the master travelled from time to time in his cart. The disciples asked him from what complaint he suffered; to which he replied : " My malady cannot be understood by physicians ; it is a purification by the help of the sainted men and the sages. I cannot get well suddenly ; but you need not be anxious." The disciples were afHicted, and did not understand his words. Then one of them had a dream, in which a spirit said to him : " Be not alarmed about the master's sickness. After his arrival in China he will get well again." We proceeded by a sandy road for more than 300 li ; water and grass were very scarce. We travelled uninterruptedly ; even at night our horses did not rest. Finally, after two days we emerged from the sand, and were then near the northern frontier of the Hict (Tangut empire ; see note 46). Here huts and tents became more frequent, and we had less difficulty
in getting horses. The disciples who travelled behind reached us here. On the 2ist of the sixth month (July 19), 1223, we stopped at Yu yang huan}^'^ The master still continued to abstain from food. Next day we passed the customs
barrier and reached fifty li to the east of it, Feng chou^^^

The above name is not marked on the great Chinese map, but the defile in question is, it seems, the Onghin daba of Pevtsoff's map. See also Richthofen's map of China. According to the great geography of the Chinese empire, ancient Feng chou was situated near the present Kukukhoto {Eui hua ch'eng).

where the first officers of the place came to meet the master, who began again to eat as he was accustomed
to do. We were then at the end of the summer, and the master was in the habit of sitting at the northern window of the house in which he stayed. At the request of the master of the house he wrote some verses on silk paper. On the ist of the seventh month (July 29) we started again, and arrived after three days at Ilia slmi}^^ The next day we left, and on the 9th (August 6) arrived at Y'iin cliung^^'^^ where the master spent more than twenty days. The military commandant of Snan te^'^^ sent an express to Yiin chung with a letter to the master and an
offer of cart and horses. At the beginning of the eighth month (end of August) the master started, and proceeding eastward, we reached Yang ho, passed Po teng, Tien cJieng, Huai an, and crossed the river Hun ho}''^^ The commandant met the master far out of the city (of Silan te), and lodged him at the monastery Chao yuan kuan. The Taoists received the master with great distinction, and told him that in the last winter some of them saw GKao hung (the disciple who died at Sairam) entering the monastery and leading a horse by the bridle. All came to meet him, but he disappeared suddenly. He was also seen at other places.

THen clieng and Huai an are now district cities. By Hun ho the diarist means the river Yang ho of modern Chinese maps. It passes Siian hun fu, and joins farther to the south-east the San Jean ho, when the united river takes a south-eastern direction and passes about ten miles west of Peking. Now-a-days the name of Hun ho is applied to the river only after it has entered the plain.

in Northern China addressed letters to the master inviting him to visit them. These invitations succeeded each other like the spokes of a rolling wheel; but the master answered that he was sorry he could not divide himself into several bodies, to satisfy the wishes of all. According to a vow taken at the time Ch'ang ch'un passed the battlefield of Ye-hu ling (see note 104), covered with white human bones, there was on the 15th (September 10) a service performed by Ch'ang ch'un's disciples in Te hing,^'^^ at the monastery of Lung yang kuan, to help the destitute souls to pass over. After the service, an officer from the emperor (Chinghiz) arrived to inquire about the master's journey, health, &c. Ch'ang ch'un spent the winter in Lung yang kuan. The governor of Yen king (now Peking) and other officers from that city sent an express with a letter to the master, in order to invite him to stay in the monastery of Ta fien chang kuan, to which he assented. At Nan kouf^^ in the monastery of Slun yu kuan, the Taoists of Yen king met him. The next day venerable old men, men and women, assembled from all sides, and accompanied the master with fragrant flowers when he entered Yen king, and the people bowing before him obstructed the road. At the time the master started for the west, the friends wished to know when he would return, to which he
replied: ''In three years—in three years and indeed his prophecy was realised, for it was on the 7th of the first month (January 28), 1224, he arrived at the monastery of Ch'ang t'ien kuan.^^^

long and painful journey to his native soil, T break off the narrative of his adventures. The Si yu ki continues Ch'ang ch'un's biography until his death ; but the further
events of his life are of little interest, and have nothing to do ^dth my programme. I will only briefly state that the master remained at Peking. By order of Chinghiz, the ground of the gardens of the northern palace of the Kin was given to him for the purpose of establishing there a Taoist monastery. This monastery was built on the KHung Jma island, and the people were forbidden to gather fuel in the park of the island and to fish in the lake.2^*^ The master, who lived there, sometimes took a walk to the top of the hill on the island, and enjoyed the magnificent view he had of the surrounding gardens. Farther on in the narrative we read : " On the 23d of the sixth month (July 8), 1227, it was reported to the master that, owing to heavy rain, the southern embankment of the lake had fallen down, and that the water had gushed into the eastern lake, so that it was heard at a distance
of several li. After this all fish and tortoises disappeared, and the lake became dry." Ch'ang ch'un took this for an omen of his death, and indeed he died on the 9th of the seventh month (July 23), 1227. Next year his disciples, with the help of a great number of other Taoists, who had arrived from different parts of China, built for the mortal remains of the sage a monastery, the buildings of which were finished in forty days. The 9th of the seventh month (August 10), 1228, was fixed for the ceremony of transferring and burying the body. During the sixth month (July) heavy rain fell uninterruptedly .2''''' The people were afraid that the ceremony
The K'iung hua island and the lake still exist. They are now within the imperial city, but at the time of the Kin dynasty these pleasure grounds were situated north of the capital. ^^'^ It seems the climate of Peking has not changed since that time ; for now in July and August the rainfall at Peking is generally so abundant, that all communication becomes interrupted, and a great part of the capital is inundated.

would be hindered; but on the ist of the seventh month (August 2) the heavens suddenly cleared up, and all were much gratified. When the coffin was opened, the appearance of the master was the same as he had showed in his life. During three days people came from far and near, princes, officers, and others, more than ten thousand. All were astonished at this wonder and laid their hands on their foreheads. The funeral ceremonies continued three days. On the 8th of the seventh month (August 9), at eight o'clock in the morning, at first black cranes flew past from the south-west, then followed white cranes.^^^ The people looked at them with astonishment. On the 9th at midnight was the last funeral service, after which the mortal remains (literally, the exuvise of the immortal part of man) of the master were buried in the monastery. This monastery received the name Fo yun kuan (the Monastery of the White Clouds).^^^
The Taoists consider cranes and storks as the birds of sainted and immortal men. On cranes the Taoists who have attained perfection are said to soar up to heaven. The Chinese white crane is the beautiful Grus tnontigncsia. It is of large size and of a splendid white colour. Only the neck and some feathers of the wings are black. M. Polo (i. 286) speaks of five different cranes found in those tracts. One of them is all white, and is the biggest of all, &c. ^'^^ This Taoist monastery, Po yiin kuan, exists still, west of Peking, one li west of the SI pien men gate. It is still, as Palladius states, the first Taoist monastery in China. In the principal temple, where the remains of Ch'ang ch'un repose, there is a statue representing the sage. In another
temple we find his statue again, and those of six of his disciples. A third temple contains the statues of his eighteen companions of travel. On the 19th of the first month, the birthday of Ch'ang ch'un is celebrated every year in the Po yiin kuan, and the people of Peking repair in great numbers to this place.

SI SHI KI:
EECOED OF AN EMBASSY TO THE REGIONS IX
THE WEST.
PEELIMINARY NOTICES.
The traveller whom we are now about to follow in his journey from Mongolia to Western Asia was an envoy dispatched by the Mongol emperor Mangu Khan, in the year 1259, to his brother Hulagu^ who at that time had just succeeded in overthrowing the Calif of Bagdad. The name of this envoy, a Chinese, was GKang Te. After his return, the report of his journey was taken down by a certain Lite Yio, who termed his pamphlet as above stated. This narrative was then incorporated in the Yu fang hia hna, published in the Mongol period (see
Wylie's " Notes on Chinese Literature," p. 1 34). Other editions of the Si shi ki are to be found in the Shufu, a work issued early in the Ming (Wylie, L c, p. 136); in the Yuan shi lei pien, an abridged history of the Mongol dynasty, published in 1693 ; in the Hai Jcuo fu chi, a modern Chinese geographical work published 1844 ; and in several of the bulky ts\mg shu or collections of reprints. The narrative, as it has been transmitted by Liu Yu, from a geographical point of view, is much inferior in value to the record of Ch*ang ch'un's travels, which, in this department of literature, I find, occupies a higher place than many reports of our European mediaeval travellers. The style of the Si shi ki presents the inconveniences we often have to complain of in Chinese books



no CHINESE MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS.

vagueness in the ideas, often ambiguity in the expressions, and omission of the principal matters in the report, whilst some absurd details are minutely recorded. The indications of the geographical position of places are far from being precise, and the proper names are often corrupted. Besides this, many typographical blunders have
crept into the different editions, which make it difficult for the reader to understand who has access only to one edition. But notwithstanding these blemishes, I am far from declaring the Si shi ki unserviceable for the elucidation of the ancient geography of Asia. We have not to look for accuracy in the ancient Chinese views of regions so far from China, and our science must accept thankfully all literary documents which come down to us from such a remote time. I have compared the texts of four different editions of the Si shi ki in the above-mentioned works, and as the erroneously used characters and omissions are happily not the same in the different texts, I have been enabled to recon
struct the complete original of the article for my translation. The Si shi ki has been twice translated into French by two well-known sinologues. Abel Eemusat translated it from the Yuan shi lei pien, chap, xlii., in his " Melanges
Asiatiques," 1825, i. 171 seqq. Pauthier translated the text found in the Hai kuo t'u chi, and published his translation in the Introduction to his "Marco Polo," 1865. But, as 1 have already stated, both texts are incomplete, and the French sinologues have misunderstood the greater part of the article. Therefore I venture to present a new and complete translation of this curious and ancient literary document. The subject of the greater part of the Si shi ki is the expedition of Hulagu to Western Asia, and accounts of the countries which his armies successively passed through. Pauthier fell into an error in assuming that Liu Yu, who took down the report of the envoy Ch'ang Te^ accompanied the expedition. He calls him " commissaire chinois de I'expedition." Liu Yu never was in Western Asia, and



SI SHI KI—INTRODUCTION.
even Cli'ang Te in his report speaks not as an eye-witness of the events he records regarding the conquests of Hulagu. The introduction to the text Pauthier translated states clearly that Cli ang Te was sent to the west after Bagdad had been taken. There is yet another Chinese account of Hulagu's expedition to Western Asia, preserved in the biography of the general Xuo JCan, Yuan shi, chap, cxlix. This distinguished general, who was a Chinaman (his father and grandfather had already signalised themselves as valiant warriors in the Mongol army), was with Hulagu in Persia, Bagdad, &c. ; and in his biography the events of the expedition, and the different countries and places through which the Mongol armies passed, are mentioned in the same order as in the Si shi ki. But both reports seem to have been written independently, and there is also a difference in the spelling of the proper names. I shall compare them at the proper places, in order to corroborate Ch'ang Te's report. Pauthier seems to be right in suggesting that this Xtio K'an of the Chinese authors must be the general KuJca Ilka mentioned by Eashid-eddin as commanding, together wdth Bukatimur, the right flank of Hulagu's army (d'Ohsson, ii. 193). Having thus furnished evidence that the narrative of the journey reported in the Si shi ki is not a diary of the march of Hulagu's army, as the Prench sinologues assumed, I proceed to show what is recorded in the Persian and Chinese annals about this prince, his expedition, and the route followed by his troops through Central Asia. The Chinese statements on this subject, as found in the Yuan shi, are very incomplete ; but Eashid-eddin, the able Persian historiographer, furnishes detailed accounts of the conquest of Western Asia by the Mongols. I may be allowed to give here, before commencing the translation of the Si shi ki, an abstract of the chief points of Hulagu's campaign, as recorded by Eashid and other Mohammedan authors. This will enable the reader to form a judgment of the authenticity of the statements of the Chinese traveller.



112 CHINESE MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS.
HuLAGu's Expedition to Western Asia, after the Mohammedan Authors.
(D'Olisson, iii. 134 seq^g. j Quatremere's "Histoire des Mongols.")
In 12 19 Chinghiz Khan had turned his arms against Western Asia, and especially against the powerful realm of Khovarezm. Transoxiana and Eastern Persia had been conquered and devastated by Chinghiz and his three sons. The conqueror himself, pursuing the Sultan Djelal-eddin, had pushed on as far as the Indus, whilst one division of his army, commanded by the generals Sitbutai and Chebe, had penetrated to Western Persia and Georgia, crossed the Caucasus, and in 1223 made their first appearance in Eussia. Chinghiz left Western Asia in 1224, and returned with his army to Mongolia. A Monf^ol crovernor was left to administer the devastated countries. The conqueror died in 1227. His son and successor, Ogotai Khan (1229-41), sent an army to Persia again, where, in the meanwhile, Djelal-eddin had succeeded to some extent in re-establishing his power. This army was commanded by the Mongol general Charmogun^^^ who dispersed the sultan's armies, and, after Djelaleddin was slain, in 123 1, continued to devastate the western part of Persia. In 1235 a vast Mongol army was directed, under the supreme command of Batu, the grandson of Chinghiz, to the countries north of the Caspian Sea. The Mongols devastated Eussia, making it tributary, and carrying fire and slaughter westward, overran Poland, Moravia and Silesia, and ravished Hungary. But in 1241 Batu left the devastated countries, and withdrew his

armies, which retreat was occasioned probably by Ogotai Khan's death. In the eastern part of Persia it seems Khorassan was tranquilly governed by Mongol governors, who had their seat in the city of Ttts ; but in the western part, in the province of Adjerbeidjan and the adjacent countries, the Mongol armies continued during more than twenty years to commit all manner of atrocities. After Charmogun's death in 1241, Baidju took the command. The name of this Mongol lieutenant was well known at that time even in Europe. Pope Innocent sent a mission to him in 1246. But notwithstanding the increasing power of the Mongols in Asia, and the terror they spread everywhere, the success of their arms in Western Asia was not satisfactory. There was still the realm of the Calif of Bagdad, which had preserved its independence, and in the mountains of Elburs and in Kuhistan the Ismaelians or " Assassins " braved the Mongol arms in their impregnable fortresses and castles. Therefore among the first cares of MangitKhan (1251-59), when he had ascended the throne of his grandfather Chinghiz, were the affairs in Western Asia. At the great kuriltai (assembly) on the accession of Mangu, an expedition on a large scale to Western Asia was decided upon, and Hulagu, the younger brother of Mangu,^^^ was appointed commander-in-chief. To compose the army, all the princes of the imperial family were obliged to furnish two men out of every ten of their troops. A thousand engineers from China had to get themselves ready to serve the catapults, and to be able to cast inflammable substances (naphtha).
According to Rashid, Tului, fourth son of Chinghiz {T'o-lei in the Yiian shi, chap, cxv., where his biography is found), had four sons by his principal wife, SiurTcuhteni {So-lu-ho-t'ie-ni in the Yiian shi, Seroctan in PL Carpini, 667)

Order was given to reserve all pasture-land westward of the Tiingat monntains,^^^ between Karakorum and Bishbalik, for the cavalry. Besides this, the roads were repaired and bridcres were constructed over the rivers that had to

provisions for the troops. The ejeneral Kitihuka^^^ moved out with an advance guard of i2,ooo men in 1252, end of July. Hulagu left Karakorum, the residence of his brother, on the 2d May 1253, and returned to his ordo,^^^ in order to organise his army. On the 19th October of the same year, all being ready, he started for the west. In Almalik (see note 172) Hulagu was well entertained by the Princess Organa.^^^ Farther on he was met by Mass'ud^^^ governor of Turkestan and Transoxiana. He spent the whole summer of
The same name occurs a second time in the Mohammedan records, Rokn-eddin, the chief of the Ismaelians, sent after his seizure to Mangu Khan, is said to have been killed in the Tungat mountains on his way back from Karakorum (d'Ohsson, iii. 201). The name has some resemblance to Tangnu, which is the name of a mountain chain in North-Western Mongolia, stretching parallel with the Kliangai range, and north and north-east of it. It would seem, however, that here by Tungat the Khangai itself is meant. See note 132, -S3 In the Yuan shi this name reads K'ie-di-hu-hua (see farther on). It is not known where Hulagu's ordo and his appanage were situated, but probably not far from Karakorum, 285 Organa was the widow of Kara Hulagu {Ha-la-hii-Ue in the Yiian shi), and the latter was the grandson of Chinghiz' second son, Ohagatai. I have stated above (note 252) that Almalik was the capital of Chagatai's dominions. Organa reigned there 1252-60, Colonel Yule has rightly pointed out ("Cathay," 522) that the statement of Rubruk, according to which he passed through a region called Organum in 1 254, is founded on a misapprehension. He confounded the name of the princess with the
name of the country. A similar misconception is found in Hue's '
' Voyage dans la Tartarie," &c., p, 56, The traveller informs us of the existence of a kingdom in Mongolia called Uje (le royaume de Bfe). Nobody would be able to find such a name on any map of Mongolia. But Hue himself gives unconsciously the key to identify this kingdom in stating that the king of it was the son-in-law of the emperor of China. " Efe," in Manchu, means the son-in-law of the emperor. The word is used also by the Chinese, -^^ In the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1251, his name is spelt Ma-su-hu, and his appointment as governor of these countries is noticed there.

1254 iu Tiirkestan^^'^ and did not arrive at Samarkand till September 1255. In a lovely meadow near this city a splendid tent was pitched for the prince, who passed forty days here in drinking and debauchery. In Kesh (Kash ; see note 209) Hulagu was met by Argun, the governor
general of (Eastern) Persia.^^^ He spent a month there, and issued proclamations addressed to all the sovereigns of Western Asia, summoning them to assist him in the extermination of the Mulahida. The Mulahida^^^ or Isinaelians, also known by the name of Assassins, given to them by the Crusaders, were a secret Mohammedan sect who had their principal seats in a number of strong castles in the Elburs mountains and in Kuhistan. The sect of the Mulahida was a branch of the SJdyas, or adherents of Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed, who was the fourth Calif, and was overthrown by the Omayads. His sons Hassan and Hussein were also killed. The Shiyas consider the Califs of the Omayad dynasty as usurpers, and believe that the legal pontifical dignity lies with the Imams, or descendants of Ali. Ismael, the eldest son of the fifth Imam, v/as addicted to drinking, and was therefore deposed. His younger brother was made Imam. Then one part of the Shiyas, which recognised Ismael, revolted. This was the origin of the Ismaelian sect. Their principal seat was in Syria. At the end of the eleventh century, Hassan Sahah, one of their converts in Persia, made himself master of the mountain castle Alamut, near Kazvin, which belonged to the Seldjuk Sultan Melik shah. Subsequently he conquered also the adjacent mountainous district Riidhar, the castles of Lem

Erom their residence, the castle of Alamut, Hassan Sabah and his successors spread terror over the whole of Western Asia. Ismaelian emissaries penetrated everywhere, and assassinated the people. Even the sovereigns were not secure. Two Califs were assassinated by order of the chief of the Ismaelians. At the time Chinghiz arrived in Persia, Djelcd-eddin Hassan was at the head of this sect, and sent an envoy to the conqueror. He died in 1221, when his son, Ala-eddin Moliammed, was only nine years old. The latter was assassinated in 1255, and was succeeded by his son Rokneddin Kursliah, who was chief of the Ismaelians at the time Hulagu's armies appeared in Persia. Hulagu crossed the DjiJmn (Amu-daria) on the 2d of January 1 2 56. The Sidtan of Bum and the Atabey of Fars had sent envoys to congratulate the prince. Other lords of Western Asia had appeared in person. A lion-hunt was oro'anised there, and ten lions were killed. Leaving? the Oxus, Hulagu advanced to Slmhirgan (fifty-three English miles west of Balkh), and spent the winter in the
prairies of this district. In spring he proceeded to Zaweh (south of Mshapur), and gave orders to the generals Kiika Ilka and Kitid)uka to achieve the conquest of the dominions of the Mulahida. Kitubuka had besieged the
fortress of Ghirdkuh for two years, but it still held out. Hulagu then went to Tus, where he received Shahin Shah, the brother of the chief of the Ismaelians (June 1256), who came to offer his submission. Erom Tus he

The name of Ghirdlcuh appears in the Yiian shi as Ghi-rh-du-kie (see farther on). Ghirdkuh means "round mountain." D'Ohsson (ii. 189, 1 90) is wrong in believing that this mountain castle was situated in Kuhistan, the mountainous country west of Herat and south of Nishapur. Ghirdkuh or Kerdeh-huh was in the district of Kumes, three parasangs west of Dameghan. See Quatremere's " Hist. d. Mongols," 278, note.

proceeded by Kabushan, in the province of JSfisJiapur,^^^ to Bistham, from which place he sent envoys to Eokneddin, summoning him to destroy his castles and to repair in person to the prince's encampment. Eokn-eddin beo-oed the favour to retain two or three of his castles, and sent orders to the commandant of Ghirdkuh to surrender that fortress to the Mongols. In the beginning of October Hulagu arrived at Demavend}^'^ Eokn-eddin was again summoned to destroy his fortresses, but he tried to protract the negotiation in the hope that winter would intervene and stop the operations of the Mongols. Hulagu passed to Bai,^^^ and ordered all his troops to enter the district of Budbar from different parts at the same time, and laid immediate siege to the fortress of Meimitndiz. Bukatimur and Kuka Ilka, with the right flank, came from Mazanderan.

Demavend, or, as Abulfeda (II. ii. 169) writes, JDonbatvend, is the name of the highest mount in the Elburs chain. It rises to a height of nearly 20,000 feet, and is covered with perpetual snow. At the foot of this majestic mount, on the route from Teheran to Astrabad and Khorassan, is the city of the same name. 1:93 rpj^g ruins of this celebrated city, mentioned in Holy Scripture and visited by Alexander the Great, are still to be seen, about five English miles south of Teheran. -^^ Khar or Khuar (Xoaprjprj of Isidor, Choara of Pliny) was a great city between E,ai and Simnan, on the road to Khorassan.

Eokn-eddin, who was in Meimundiz, surrendered himself to the Mongols (19th November 1256), and gave orders for the surrender of all the fortified places in Eudbar, Kumes, and Kuhistan. Alamut and Lembasser, two of the strongest, alone refused to capitulate. Hulagu himself then led his troops to Alamut by the road leading through Sheherek, the ancient capital of the sovereigns of Deilem.^^^ Alamut capitulated, December 20, 1256. Lembasser was taken in January 1257. More than fifty fortified places of the Ismaelians then surrendered, and were all demolished. Eokn-eddin was sent to Mans^u Khan. He was badly received. Mangu refused him an audience, and ordered him to be taken back to Persia. Eokn-eddin on his way home was murdered in the Tungat mountains (see note 282). In Persia all the Ismaelians who had been taken prisoners were killed. Having exterminated the Ismaelians, Hulagu spent some time in the neighbourhood of Kazvin,^^'^ and then started for Hamadan. An expedition was prepared now against Mostassim, the Calif of Bagdad, who had reigned there since 1242. On the 21st September 1257, the Mongol prince sent an envoy to Bagdad and summoned the Calif to raze to the ground the wall of the city and appear in person before the prince ; to which the Calif gave a haughty reply. Hulagu having now decided to attack Bagdad, the Mongol general Baidju, who was stationed in Bum, received orders to move out, and with his troops to form the right flank. He crossed the Tigris at llosstd,^^^ arrived near the western side of Bagdad, and there joined the corps of Buhatimur, Sugundjac, the princes Bolga, Tutar, Kidi, &c. This right flank of the
Deilem is a name applied to a region situated in the Elburs mountains south of Ghilan. On the Chinese mediaeval map the name is spelt Di-lien. -^"^ Ko-dsi-yun on the Chinese mediaeval map. Mao-si-U on the Chinese mediaeval map.

Mono-ol armv was directed towards tlie western side of the citv. In tlie meanwhile Kituhuha and Kudussun, conimandino- the left flank, invaded Luristan}^^ Hulao-u with the centre of the army left Hamadan. His march to Bag'dad lay through the snowy mountains which separated the two Iraks. Kcrmansliah^^^ was devastated. He reached on the i8th of December the river Holiuan (an eastern affluent of the Diala river), where he halted for thirteen days. The generals Kuka Ilka and Oroktii were with him. The commander-in-chief of the Califs army was Solciman Shah. Eibeg, the Little Devatdar, or vicechancellor, and the general Fcth-eddin Ihn Cover had been sent to attack Hulagu on the road of Holwan. But when the right flank of the Mongol army approached Bagdad, this division of the Calif's army crossed the Tigris again and attacked the vanguard of the Mongols near Anlar, The Mongols retired to the Dodjeil (the canal which connects the Tigris and the Euphrates), where the bulk of the Mongol army was posted. The Devatdar imprudently advised to pursue the enemy. The Mongols opened the dikes during the night, and thus succeeded in flooding the country behind the Califs army, of which the greater part perished. The generals Ibn Corer and Cora Sinkor were killed. The Devatdar escaped with some residue to Bagdad. A few days after, the right flank of the Mongol army reached the suburb of Bagdad on the western bank of the Tioris. Kitubuka, having devasted Luristan, approached also the Califs capital. Erom the i8th of January 1258 Hulagu encamped on its eastern side, and the vast city was now invested. On the 30th the assault began from all sides, and a great breach was effected in a tower flanking one of the gates. On the ist of Eebruary the whole tower was destroyed, and the Mongols captured by assault all the wall on the eastern side of the city. The vice-chancellor and a body of 10,000 men tried to

escape down the river, but the Mongols were expecting and repulsed them, and forced them to return to Bagdad, The Calif now, seeing that resistance was hopeless, sent several deputations offering terms. Hulagu demanded that Soleiman Shah and the vice-chancellor should be sent to him, and on their arrival he ordered them to return and bring out all their forces. Afterwards he ordered both to be executed. On the loth of February the Calif himself entered Hulagu's encampment with his three sons and surrendered his capital, which was then plundered during seven days.^^^ On the 20th of February 1258, Hulagu left Bagdad, owing to the infection of the air by the great number of dead bodies. On the 21st the Calif and his eldest son were executed near a place called Valmf. Hulagu remained there until the 8th of March. Kuka Ilka and Karabuka with 3000 men were left in Bagdad. Bukatimur (the brother-in-law of Hulagu) was detached with a Mongol force to take Vassit, Kufa^^^ and other cities. On the 17th of April Hulagu returned to Hamadan. The Noyen Oroktu captured after a long siege the city of Erhil (Arbela). Hulagu proceeded to the lake of Ormia (Urumia), where he ordered a castle to be built on the island of Tala, in the middle of the lake, for the purpose of depositing here the immense treasures captured at Bagdad. A great part of the booty, however, had been sent to Mangu Khan. In the beginning of August 1258 we find Hulagu in Meraga, where he received the homage of the prince of Mossul. But he soon left this place for Tehriz, where he
fixed his residence. At this time the princes of Fars and

Kufa is likewise omitted on the ancient Chinese map, but a place K'u-fa is noticed in the afore-mentioned list, together with Wu-Tci-ha-la Okbara, an ancient city of Chaldsea) and Wa-si-di, which is the Vassi taken by Bukatimur.



HULAGU'S EXPEDITION TO PERSIA. 121
two rival Seldjuk Sultans of Eum, and other little sovereigns of Western Asia, came to do homage. In the same 3^ear the general Kitubuka is reported to have reduced the country of X^tr or Liiristan and its Atabey Teghele. I apologise for this long extract from the Persian historians about Hulagu's expedition to Western Asia. But I considered it necessary, before presenting the concise and often incoherent accounts given regarding the same matters by a Chinese author in the Si shi ki, to give a suc
cinct but coherent statement of the facts. I did not mention details regarding the expedition undertaken by Hulagu in September 1259 to Syria, the assault of Aleppo in 1260, and the conflicts v^^ith the Sultans of Egypt; for these events do not seem to be alluded to in the Chinese report. Let me finally quote, for the sake of completeness, a few passages from the Chinese annals referring to the expedition of Hulagu. In the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1252, it is stated : "The emperor (Mangu) sent the general ICie-di-hu liua (Kitubuka of the Persian authors) to attack the Mu-li-lii (Mulahida or Ismaelians) and to lay siege to the fortress Mo-lai GJii-rh-dic-k'ie (Ghirdkuh of the Mulahida). The prince Hil-lie-iuio (Hulagu) received orders to subdue the
countries of the west belono^ingj to the dominions of the
su-dan (Sultan)."
It is further stated that in the following year Hil-lie-ivu was ordered to start, together with Wu-liang-ho-dai^^^ for
Wu-liang-ho-t' ai was the son of the celebrated Mongol general Su-hudai, whose name was well known to his contemporaries ; for Suhutai devastated the countries around the Caucasus, and Russia, Hungary, &c. In the Russian annals he is repeatedly mentioned. His biography as well as that of his son are found in the Ylian shi, chap. cxxi. It is said there that Wuliang-ho-t' ai took part in the expeditions to Russia, Poland, and Germany, and distinguished himself in the conquest of the Chinese province of Yiin nan ; but nothing is reported there about his having been with Hulagu in Western Asia. Probably the imperial order was recalled, and this general was then employed in Ylin nan. Rashid states (d'Ohsson, ii. 314-318) that Uriangcadai (evidently the same as Wu-liang-ho-t' ai) waged war in Karadjanh (which is the same as Ylin nan).

the west, and subdue Ha-li-fa Ba-ha-da (Bagdad of the Calif) and other countries. Under the year 1257, the Yiian shi mentions the taking
of the fortress of Glii-rh-dit-kie by ICic-di-hu-liiia. In 1258 it is recorded that Hil-lie-wu subdued the empire of the Ha-li-fa in the Si yil (Western Asia), and dispatched a courier to the emperor to report the victories. Besides these, we find no more accounts in the Chinese annals regarding Huhagu's expedition. But many interesting statements regarding it appear in some of the bio
graphies in the Ylian shi, as I shall show farther on.
TRANSLATION OF THE Si ShI Ki.
In the year 1252 Hil-lie-iuu (Hulagu), the younger brother of the emperor (Mangu), had taken the supreme command of the troops, and received orders to attack the Si yil (Western Asia). In the space of six years he succeeded in extending the frontier of the empire by nearly ten thousand li. On the 20th of the first month (February 13) of 1259, Cloang Te set out as a courier dispatched to the west (to the prince Hulagu). After leaving Ho-lin^^^ he travelled
Ho-lin is the Chinese name for Karahorum, the celebrated residence of Chinghiz' first successors. The full name, as it appears in the Yiian shi, chap. Iviii., is Ha-la ho-lin. It is said there that this name is derived from the name of a river west of the city, Rashid states (d'Ohsson, i. 430) that Karakorum was the name of a mountain, from which the city received the name. According to the Yiian shi, annals, Ogotai Khan, in 1235, in spring, ordered to raise the walls of Ha-la Tio-iin and to build the palace Wan an Icung within it. His successors Kuyuk and Mangu resided there; but Kubilai Khan transferi'ed, in 1260, the residence to Ta tu or the present Peking. PI. Carpini, in 1246, was the first Western mediaeval traveller to mention Karakorum (I. c, 608). He was near the city, but did not see it. Eight years later (in 1 254) Pubruk visited this place, and left an account of Karakorum (Z. c, 345). M. Polo (i, 227) gives also a short description of the city from hearsay. In 1825 A. Remusat published, under the title " Pecherches sur la Ville de Karakorum," an interesting paper on the ancient Mongol capital, and tried to determine its site from ancient Chinese itineraries. After Pubruck, for four centuries and a half no European traveller had passed through the country where the ruins of that celebrated city had to be looked

throngli tlie country of Wu-sun in a nortli- western direction more than 200 li, tlie ground rising gradually. After a halt, the traveller then crossed the Han Hai. The country was very high and cold, and notwithstanding the great heat in summer, the snow never melts there. The rocky mountains were covered all over with fine pine trees.^*^^ After seven days travelling in a south-western
direction, Cli ano- Te had crossed the Han hai,^^'^ and de
for, when in about 1713 the Jesuit missionaries visited the valley of the Orkhon ; and 160 years later, Paderin, Russian Consul at Ui'ga, tried to decide the question of the position of ancient Karakorum by local investigation. Guided by the itinerary of the Chinese mediaeval traveller Ch'ang' Te hui (see notes 104, 127), he succeeded in discovering, at a distance of thirty or forty English miles south-east of lake Ughei nor, and from four to six miles west of the Orkhon river, the ruins of an ancient city, which the Mongols called Kliam Jchcron (Black rampart), also Khara balgasun (Black city). This he believes was ancient Karakorum. The account given by Paderin of his journey and his discovery was published in the " Proceedings of the Russian Geographical Society," 1873. -^^ English translation of this paper by Mad. Eedchenko, annotated by Colonel Yule, appeared in the "Geographical Magazine," 1874, p. 137 segq. It seems, however, that Paderin is mistaken in his supposition. At least it does not agree with the position assigned to the ancient Mongol residence in the Mongol annals Erdenin erikhe, translated into Russian in 1883 by Professor Pozdneyeff. It is there positively stated (p. no, note 2) that the monastery of Erdenidsu, founded in 1585, was erected on the ruins of that city, which once had been built by order of Ogotai Khan, and where he had established his residence ; and where, after the expulsion of the Mongols from China, Togontemur again had fixed the Mongol court. This vast monastery still exists, one English mile, or more, east of the Orkhon. It has even been astronomically determined by the Jesuit missionaries, and is marked on our maps of Mongolia. Pozdneyeff, who visited the place in 1877, obligingly informs me that the square earthen wall surrounding the monastery of Erdenidsu, and measuring about an English mile in circumference, may well be the very wall of ancient Karakorum. 305 There was before our era, and in the early period after it, a people called Wu-sun, who dwelt at first north of the present province of Kan su, and emigrated subsequently to Dsungaria. In the time of the Mongols it had disappeared centuries ago. The Chinese, however, like to use ancient names of countries in their books. Compare note 319. 30(i -^^y translation of the above somewhat obscure passage is perhaps not correct ; for the literal meaning of it would be : The stones (rocks) of the mountains all bear figures of pine trees. ^^'^ About the Han hai see note 9, Ch'ang Te, as appears from his account, comprises in this appellation the Khangai and the Altai mountains, and the elevated plateau between these ranges.

scending gradually for 300 li, arrived at a river several li broad. It was called Hun mu-Uen,^^^ and in summer often overflows the country. He crossed the river in a boat, and a few days later passed the river Lung-guP^ Thence he proceeded again in a north-western direction, the distance by road southward to Bie-shi-ha-li^'^^ at the nearest point being 500 li. There were a great number of Chinese (in the country through which the traveller was
now passing).^^^ They cultivate wheat, barley, sJm (millet, Panicum miliaceum)^ and Jcu (Setaria italica). The river (Lung-gu) flows westward, stagnates and forms a lake, which is more than a thousand li in cir
Hun muren or Hun river. Hun in Mongol as well as in Chinese means "muddy." Another Chinese traveller, a contemporary of Ch'ang Te, calls the Tula river Hun Du-la. See note 127. The commentators of the Si shi ki agree in identifying the Hun muren of the mediaeval traveller with the Dsapkhan of our days. Matussoffsky, in July 1870, went along the southern bank of this river, in its middle part, for more than seventy miles. According to him (Potanin's "Mongolia," i. 367), it forms many branches ; its water is generally deep ; fords are not frequent. It has a rapid current, and overflows sometimes the adjacent lowlands. Pevtsoff (p. 41), who in September 1878 saw the same portion of the river, but it seems at the time of low water, says that the water of the Dsapkhan is generally shallow, seldom attaining a depth of six or seven feet, whilst its breadth varies from 80 to 140 feet. Potanin, I. c, 222, crossed the Upper Dsapkhan in July 1877, where it was fordable. But the identification of the Hun muren of the Chinese traveller with the Dsapkhan is not free from doubt
;
for Ch'ang Te states that a few days after crossing the Hun muren he reached the Ulungur river. The distance between this river and the Dsapkhan, as the crow flies, is more than 230 English miles, and the Altai with its difficult defiles has to be crossed. Ch'ang Te does not mention at all this mountain range. Perhaps his Hun muren was the Black Jrtysh, which is a more important river than the Dsapkhan. Doubtless the Ulungur river, which discharges itself into the Kizilbash lake. Bishbalik ; see notes 155, 157. Thus Ch'ang Te's route lay more to the north than that followed by Ch'ang ch'un. The traveller evidently proceeded along the Ulungur river down to lake Kizilbash, where still a cart-way exists (see note 151). There is now near the mouth of the Ulungur a Chinese city, Bulun toJchoi, founded in 1872 ; but, as Przewalsky states ("Tibet," 14), there was a Chinese settlement before that time. According to Potanin [1. c, i. 15), Chinese and Turguts cultivate the land around this city. They sow wheat, barley, millet, Setaria italica, &c.

cumference. Its name is Ki-tse-li-la-sz It abounds
in excellent fish. There are mills (on the river) which are put in motion by the running water. Proceeding gradually westward, Ch'ang Te arrived at a city called Ye-man.^'^^ Farther to the south-west a city Bu-lo was reached. In this country wheat and rice are cultivated. On the mountains many po trees are found, but they do not thrive vigorously, and grow tortuously between the stones. The dwelling-houses and bazaars stand interspersed among the gardens. The houses are built of clay, and the windows furnished with glass. To the north of this place (Bu-lo) is the Hai fie sJian
(the iron hill of the lake). A furious wind comes out from the hill (or mountain) and blows people passing there into
the lake.316
For the first information regarding the lyizilhash or LTungur lake, as it is more commonly called now-a-days, we are indebted to Sosnoffsky and Matussoffsky, who in 1873 visited it, and explored the country around it. Before that time the existence of a lake called Kizilbash was known to us only from Chinese maps and from Ch'ang Te's narrative. Potanin saw the same lake in 1S76, and Przewalsky in 1879, on his journey to Tibet, passed by the Ulungur lake, and then proceeded along the river of the same name, which, as I have stated, discharges into the lake near Bulun tokhoi. According to Przewalsky, the lake as well as the river abound in fish, of which the most common are a Squalius and Carassius vulgaris (Crucian). The Kizilbash is also mentioned in the Yiian shi. In chap, cxlix., biography of Te hai, it is stated that Dje-ho (the famous Mongol general, Tjebe of Rashid-eddin), on his expedition to the west, passed by the lake Ki-tse-Li-ha-shi and attacked Tie shan (iron hill), Ye-man is probably intended for Emil or Imil, which was the name of a city situated on a river of the same name in the days of the Mongols. The river has still the same name. It is an eastern affluent of the Alakul lake. I shall speak more in detail of this place in Book III. Evidently the same as the city of Bu-la in Ye lii CKu tsais narrative. See note 16, Po is the Chinese name for Thuja orientalis, a species confined to Eastern Asia. Our traveller saw probably juniperus shrubs. There can be no doubt that the lake here alluded to is the Ala kul. PL Carpini as well as Rubruk, on their journey to the Great Khan, passed by this lake. Carpini (751)) after mentioning the city of Omyl (Emil ; see note 313), continues: "Inde exeuntes qiioddam mare non multum magnum invenimus. In littore autem illius maris est quidam mons parvus, in



126 CHINESE MEDimVAL TRAVELLERS.
Proceeding south-west twenty li, Cli ang Te reached a defile whicli was called T^ie-mu-rh tsan-cTia. It was guarded by Chinese. The way leading through the defile was very rugged, with overhanging rocks.^^^ After quitting
quo est quoddam foramen iit dicitur, unde in hyeme exeunt tarn magnse tempestates ventorum, quod homines vix et cum niagno periculo possunt transire. In sestate autem ibi semper auditur quidam sonitus ventorum, sed tenuiter de foramine exit, sicut nobis incolse referebant. Per littora illius maris ivimus per plures dies ; quod mare plures insulas habet ; et illud demisimus a siuistris." Rubruk (294), after quitting Kailalc, arrived in four days at a great
lake, with a. great island in it. A valley opened upon the head of the lake from the south-east, and up this valley among the mountains was another lake. Through this gorge at times such furious gusts of wind blew that riders were apt to be blown into the lake. Putimtsoff, a Russian traveller, was the first who visited the Alakul lake in modern times, in 181 1. Thirty years later Schrenk explored the lake and its environs (Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," 1868, p. 80). Since the Russian occupation of those tracts the Alakul has frequently been visited and described by European travellers. See Morgan's account of the lake in his translation of Przewalsky's '"'Journey to the Lob nor," p. 188 seqq. ; Kostenko's "Turkestan," i. 171. At the present day the Alakul consists of three lakes. From the largest of these three, the Alakul strictly speaking, rises the black rocky cone called Aral tube (insular peak), 630 feet above the surface of the water. This is probably the T'ie shan (or iron hill) of the lake," noticed in our Chinese narrative, and mentioned also in the Yiian shi (see note 312). Near it is a second small island, and some versts to the north a rock rises straight up from the water, connected with the shore by a narrow neck of land. To the south-east of the Alakul is another lake, Djelanashch Tcul or " open lake," so called because it can be seen from a great many points in the neighbourhood. This is probably the second lake which Rubruk saw. It has no communication with the Alakul. Rubruk's valley opening upon the head of the lake from the south-east can also be identified. It is the ^narrow valley separating the Barlyk from the Alatau range, which leads in a south-eastern direction to the steppes of Mongolia. Kostenko ("Turkestan," i. 55) states that this gorge, known under the name of Kaptagai, is famed in the whole of Central Asia for the violent tempests which blow in it, and frequently put a stop to all communications. Morgan reports that the Kirghizes and the Tartars have a legend that this wind issues from some caverns which the Kalmuks have in vain tried to fill up with stones. It must be noticed that Ch'ang Te, in speaking of the iron hill in the lake, only states that it is to the north of the place he passed through. He did not himself see the Alakul. Twenty li is, it seems, a mistake. The text leads us to understand twenty li from the city of Bu-lo. Wylie suggests that T'ie-viu-rh tsancKa may be intended for "temor cham," iron road, or " temor cham chab

this defile Cli'ang Te arrived at A-li-ma-li.^^^ Tliere tlie reservoirs in tlie market-places were connected by running water. As regards fruits, there were melons, grapes, and pomegranates of excellent quality. The Hui-ho (Mohammedans) in A-li-ma-li lived mixed up with the Chinese, and gradually their customs had got changed into the customs of the middle kingdom. South (of Alimalik) there was a city called Clii-mii-rh.
Amongst the inhabitants there were a great many Chinese from Ping and Fen.^'^^ There is in this country an animal which resembles a tiger, but its hair is more dense, and is gold-coloured,
while the skin is without stripes. It is very ferocious and
attacks men.^-^ There is also an insect resembling^ a spider. When the poison of it enters a man's body, violent thirst is felt.

sar," iron roadway, in Mongol. There can be no doubt that the defile here noticed is the same described in Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary, and passed by the latter before arriving at Almalik. See note 170 ; compare also note 443. AlmaliJc ; see note 172. 319 Ping or Ping chou was the name of one of the twelve provinces into which China was divided 4000 years ago, corresponding to the northern part
of the present provinces of Chili and Shansi. We must not be surprised at meeting with this name in an article written in the thirteenth century, after it had disappeared from Chinese maps for many centuries. Chinese authors even in our days consider it a requisite of the erudite style to use the most ancient names of places in their writings, instead of the common ones. Fen means Fen, chou, now Fen chou fu in Shansi. See also note 305. Even at the present time the people of the province of Shansi are much inclined to seek their fortune far from their native soil. Pallas in his " Nachrichten iiber die Mongol. Volker," i. 36, states that the Kalmuks told him about a beast called Khara Jchulla (black-eared) which is found in the Altai mountains. According to their description, it resembles the lion, and is very ferocious. Its fur is long-haired and of a deep brown colour. This beast, as well as that mentioned in the Chinese narrative, is the desert lynx, Felis caracal, which, as is known, possesses great strength and fierceness. Its fur is not spotted, as that of the common

European lynx. The latter is also found in Central and Eastern Asia, and, as E-adde states, the Siberian lynxes are not spotted. The fur of the lynx is much appreciated by the Mongols. They call it sheluss. Rubruck (231) mentions, among the furs used by the Mongols, the papio, which properly means the baboon ; but most probably he saw skins of the lynx. '^'^^ Schuyler (" Turkestan," ii. 123) states : " This region (Aulie ata on the Talas river) is infested by the harakurt (black worm) spiders {Latrodectes lugubris), by far the most venomous of all such vermin native to this country. It is said that its poison will kill a man. The Kirghizes annually lose many animals through the bite of this spider." Ihid., 128 : " The tarantula {Lycosa singoriensis) is black with a body of the size of a pigeon's egg, covered with dark brown or black hair. The phalange [Solpugo araneoides and S. intrepida) is of a yellowish or reddish brown, also with long hair, and when walking seems as large as one's two fists. They frequent the steppes and live in the sand."
A very correct Chinese description of the phalange is found in the Si yii ircn hien lu, a record of Eastern Turkestan and Central Asia, published in 1777) ^ Manchu officer, from personal observation. The author states : The pa cha cKung (insect with eight legs) is found everywhere in the countries of the new frontier (Turkestan). It resembles the spider, and is of globular form and dirty yellow colour. It has eight not very long legs and a reddish-brown mouth. The mouth is formed by four branches. (I may observe that the mandibles of the phalange present four sharp claws, with which they inflict wounds. ) When the insect bites iron, it can be heard. Its body is yellowish green ; the skin is transparent, like that of the silkworm. It is found in damp places near canals, and also in houses. The larger ones are the size of a hen's egg ; the smaller ones are as big as a walnut. When violent wind blows, they quit their holes, and, aided by the wind, enter the houses. They run very quickly, and when angry, rise on their eight legs and attack men. If one should happen to creep upon a man's body, he must not touch it, but wait until it goes away of its own accord, when there will be no danger. But as soon as one interferes with the insect he is bitten immediately. The poison enters the body, causes great pain, and penetrates to the heart and to the marrow of the bones. When in such a case immediate help cannot be obtained, the man's body will mortify and death will ensue. When he has been only slightly bitten, if he catch the insect and bruise it, there will be no danger. But when it has succeeded in spitting a white web on the wound, then death will be inevitable. Sometimes the sap expressed from the plant tsien tsao (a kind of madder plant, Ruhia) and applied to the wound is useful, but generally out of a hundred men bitten by the pa cha cKung, only one or two escape." 3^'^ The Chinese have only copper coins, which are provided with square holes. Ingots of silver, estimated by weight, form the money in use.

Ch'ang Te now entered tlie country called Ma-a^'^^ where the people (in winter) are used to put horses to sledges, and carry heavy burdens in this manner from station to station, going very quickly. It is reported that the Ki-li-hi'SZ (Kirghizes ; see note 262) instead of horses
use dogs (for drawing sledges).^^* On the 24th of the second month (March 18) Cliang Te passed between the two mountains I-tuP^ The ground there was level and the population numerous. The country was intersected in all directions by canals, which irrio-ated the fields. Numerous ancient walls and other
o
ruins were seen. The people said that in former times the K\-tcm dwelt there.^^^ Clianc^ Te calculated that this country was 15,000 li distant from Ho-lin (Karakorum).^^^ In the neighbourhood there is a river called Yi-yiln ; it
It is difficult to say what country is intended by Ma-a, perhaps Mavar-an-nahar, by which term the Mohammedan authors understand what we call Transoxiana, the countries beyond (east of) the Oxus, Mavar-an-nahar, in Arabic, has also the meaning " transfluvialis." Properly only the land between the Oxus (Djihun) and the laxartes (Sihun) was called so, whilst the countries east of the Sihun were comprised in the general name of Turkestan. But d'Herbelot ("Bibl. Orient.," art. " Sihoun ") observes, that the Mohammedan authors very often confounded Turkestan with Mavar-an-nahar. Although snowfall is not uncommon in Turkestan, and masses of snov/ in winter lie in the mountains there, I do not believe that in the countries Chang Te passed through sledges have ever been made use of. As to dog-sledges, M, Polo (ii. 480) mentions them as in use in the dominions of KingConchi (Siberia), and Schildberger (beginning of fifteenth century) in Ihir-sibir. The Kirghizes in the thirteenth century dwelt on the Irtysb and the Upper Yenissei. 3-3 Colonel Yule in his "Cathay" (ccxiii.), written in 1866, when good maps of Turkestan did not yet exist, asks whether Itu of the Chinese travellers may perhaps mean the two parallel ranges called Ala-tagh. Ch'ang Te's way lay indeed, as that of Ch'ang ch'un (see note 185), along the northern slope of the Alatau, north of Issikul lake, and crossed it in the KasieA;pass, and then came to the river Chu, which runs there in a broad valley between the Alatau and the Alexander ranges. 3-6 As regards the iCi-tan or Karakhitai and their settlements on the Chuvwex, see notes 22, 179, and 185.

The name of Yellow River used here refers, as Colonel Yule thinks, to the muddy colour of its water. Indeed,'the great geography of the Chinese empire (Stan. Julian, "Melanges de Geogr. Asiat.," p. 72) explains, with respect to the name of the CKui river, that in the language of the Dzongars cJiui means " muddy." 330 The city of Talas. See note 23, 331 The city of Sairam. See note 186. Ch'ang ch'un mentions also a tower in Sairam. 332 rpj^jg name is probably misspelt. It appears, however, also in the Ylian shi, chap, cxlix,, biography of K'uo Pao yii, in which it is recorded that this general, after taking part in the expedition against the K'itan, and in the sacking of the ordo of Ku-chu-ho (Guchluk, gurkhan of the Karakhitai, whose residence was on the Chu river), reduced Bie-shi-lan, and then crossed the river Eu-cKang (Sir-daria ; see note 189). It seems that by Bie-shi-lan TasKkend is meant. 333 The 3rd of the third month in China is a holy day and a fair day. 33^ The Sihun or Sir-daria ; see note 189. 335 Literally, a shoe resembling a bow. 335 The Chinese name of the great^ mountain range which separates Tibet from Eastern Turkestan. 337 See note 249.

rich and the poor. On the 8th of the third month (April i) Cliang Te
arrived at the city of Siln-sz-'kan,^^'^ which is very large and populous. Just at that time a great many flowers were in bloom. Among the plants of that country, only the mo li liua {Jasminum samlac), the tsiang loei (a rose), and the mci kui (also a rose) are the same as in China. There are numerous other flowers, the names of which cannot be recollected. West of the city (of Samarkand) the people cultivate vines, the common rice, and wheat, which is sown in autumn (winter-wheat). The country produces many medicinal plants, all unknown in China, and very efficacious in curing diseases. There is the a-rh-dji, which resembles the T^io sJien (a leguminous plant, Sophora angustifolia in Japan), and
cures the ulcers of horses. It is also useful in cases of wounds and in the prevention of miscarriage. Taking a dose the size of a bean and swallowing it, the patient will
recover. The a-si-rli resembles the ti ku pi (cortex radicis
Lycii), and is useful in cases of retained placenta. It is also employed in wounds inflicted by sharp weapons when the pus is not discharged. Take this medicine, masticate and rub it into the wound, when suppuration will appear. The o-sa-rh resembles the kie keng {Platycodon grandijlorum), and cures wounds inflicted by sharp weapons, also rupture of the bowels and of the tendons. By rubbing this medicine, after it has been masticated, into the

The Chinese author, in comparing the medicinal plants of Samarkand with those of China, means the drugs (roots). I am not able to venture upon identifying these drugs. The Amu river or Oxus. See note 213. This is a correct statement as to Persia and Transoxiana. In China, on the contrary, it very seldom rains in autumn or winter, but in the hottest season very heavy rains are the rule. The birds here mentioned belong to a kind of starling. Pastor roseus, which is a zealous exterminator of locusts ; and in the countries visited by migratory locusts, these useful birds follow them in flocks of hundreds and thousands. It is impossible to identify the places mentioned in Ch'ang Te's itinerary after he crossed the Amu river. Judging from the description he gives of the country, there can be little doubt that he followed the direct route to Tebriz, where Hulagu had fixed his residence, through Khorassan. It is not said whether Chinghiz Khan's expedition in 1220, or that of Hulagu in 1256, is meant, but probably the latter. We have seen that Hulagu rested with his army for several months in the prairies of Shuhur(jan, ^^'«st of Balkh. There appears in the above passage, in the Chinese text, the term ao-lu-t'un, which Remusat in his translation takes to be the name of a man, Ala-eddin. Pauthier explains that Ao-lu-t'un was a Mohammedan general in the Mongol army. But the French sinologues are mistaken. By ao-lu, which term occurs frequently in the Ytian shi, " head-quarters " are meant. Thus the Chinese explain this Mongol word. It is the same as aoul, used in many Asiatic languages to designate an encampment of nomades. It has become also a Russian word. T'un means a military camp. By Ma-lan and Na-shang probably Meru (Merv) and Nishapur are meant. Both cities are repeatedly mentioned in the Yiian shi, and

their fields.^^* This realm (of the Ismaelians) had 360 mountain fortresses, all which had been reduced. There was, how
ever, west of Dan-lian a mountain fortress, Ki-du-hii-gii^''^ on a very steep rock, which could not be reached either by arrows or by stones (thrown by catapults). In the year 1256 the imperial army arrived at the foot of this fortress. The rock was so steep, that when one looked upwards his cap fell off. But as the army advanced simultaneously from all sides, the enemy was seized with

But it means the lucern (Medicago sativa), even in our days the favourite fodder plant for horses and cattle in Persia. The name may also be read Hi-sao-rh. Perhaps Sebzivar, west of Nishapur. ^^^ Conolly, in his journey to the north of India overland, i. 250, speaks of rock-salt mines near Nishapur. See also note 235. ^•^^ The Mulahida or Ismaelians. See note 289. 353 rpj^g traveller saw the humpbacked cattle, zehu, Bos indicus, so common all over India and the whole of Persia. The zebu is mentioned much earlier in Chinese books. The history of the Posterior Han dynasty, in the beginning of our era, speaks of the feng niu, humpback oxen, as found in T'iao chi, a far country in the west, which seems to answer to Persia (Tadjiks). This is still the custom all over Persia. The aqueducts are all subterraneous, in order to prevent the evaporation of the water. As in Persia it never rains in summer, agriculture would be impossible there without this artificial irrigation. ^^•^ Ghirdlcuh is meant ; see note 290. Dan-han is evidently intended for Damghan.

terror. The minister, Da-dje JVa-shi-rh, was delegated to offer submission.^^^ After this Wu-lu-wu-nai suan-fan surrendered. Suan-fan (in their language) means kuo wang (king). His father with one part of the armymaintained himself in the (other) mountain fortresses. Then the son received orders (from Hulagu) to take these
fortresses, and in seven days all surrendered.^^^ The booty of gold, precious stones, and other precious things was enormous. Among the spoil were girdles valued at a thousand silver hu each.^-'^^
Let me quote for comparison, from the biography of the abovementioned general, Kuo K'a?i, the accounts given about the capture of the fortresses of the Ismaelians. Kuo K'an was ordered to take part in the expedition to the west commanded by the prince Hii-lie-wu (Hulagu). In the year 1253 the army {i.e., the vanguard commanded by KituhuJca) reached the realm of Mu-nai-hi. The roads had been made impassable by the enemy by means of trenches and wells ; and the wells had been poisoned. But Kuo K'an defeated the army of the Mu-nai-hi, took a hundred and twenty-eight cities, and killed the commander, Hudu-da-rh wu-dju su-t'an. In the year 1256 Kuo K'an arrived at Ki-du-hu (Ghirdkuh). The fortress was situated on the top of the mountain Dan-han. It was only accessible by suspended ladders, and these were guarded by the most valiant troops. Kuo K'an invested the place (according to the Persian authors the Mongols built a wall all round), but it could not be taken. It was then l)attered by means of catapults (Jda 2^'cio), when the commandant, Bu-djo Na-shi-rh, surrendered. Hli-lie-wu sent Kuo Kan to Wu-luimi-nai su-t'an to summon him to come and submit in person. His
Renmsat identifies this minister with the celebrated astronomer and minister, Nasser- eddin of Thus. The Chinese traveller may have intended this high officer ; but the Persian historians state that Khodja Nassereddin, as Pashid calls him, was not in Ghirdkuh, but with Pokn-eddin in Meiraundiz. It seems, however, that Ch'ang Te confounds the assault of the latter place with the capture of Ghirdkuh. We have seen, in the accounts given by the Persian authors of the same events, that Pokn-eddin, having surrendered himself, gave orders to the commandants of the fortresses to capitulate. But his father, mentioned in the Chinese report, was not alive at the time spoken of. He had been slain in December 1 255. Up to the present time the rich in Persia adorn their girdles with precious stones of great value.

father, A-li, maintained; himself in the western fortress. Kno K'an took it, and then went to the eastern one, forced it also, and killed all the people.2»9
The army of the Mu-la-hi consisted exclusively of Assassins?^^ They were accustomed, when they saw a young man, to seduce him by holding out some advantage, and brought him to feel no repugnance to assassinating his father or brother. After this they enrolled him, and having been intoxicated by wine, he was carried into a cavern, and there diverted by music and fair damsels. During several days all his wishes were gratified. Finally, he was carried again to the former place, and when he awoke they asked him what he had seen, and informed him that if he would agree to become a tze-Uo (Assassin) he would enjoy after death all that happiness by which he was surrounded. Then they gave him every day certain prayers and exorcisms to read. Finally, (iiis heart became so captivated that) he was not afraid to execute any commission, and accomplish it without fear of deatli. The Mu-la-hi sent their emissaries secretly to the countries which had not yet submitted, with orders to
Compare notes 356, 357. By A-li, evidently Ala-eddin, the father
of Rokn-eddin, is meant. He was dead at the time spoken of, but he was ahve at the beginning of the siege of the fortresses. It is reported that Ala-eddin had succeeded in sending reinforcements to the invested fortress Ghirdkuh (d'Ohsson, iii. 189). 3(io rj^Yie Chinese text has tze k'o. The first character means "to stab," the second " guest." Both in combination mean, not a simple assassin, but an assassin sent by the orders of another to stab a man. Thus the Chinese term tze Tco would be more significant for designating the Ismaelians than our " Assassin." This latter term was carried to Europe by the Crusaders. S. de Sacy thinks that they were called HasMshiya or Hasldshin, from their use of the preparation of hemp called hashish; and thence, through their system of murder, came the modern application of the word assassin. Rubruk, p. 265, states : " Mare Caspium habet montes Mulieh, hoc est Axasinorum ad orientem." Ihid., -p. 347: " Mangu Chan misit fratrem suum uterinum in terram Hasasinorum qui dicitur Mulihet ab eis, et precepit quod omnes interficiantur.
"
M. Polo, i. 145, calls the country of the Ismaelians also Mulahet, and his account of their mystical cult is almost exactly the same as given by the Chinese author.

stab the rulers. It was the same with regard to women. (I understand they were also sent to assassinate.) The realm of the Mu-la-hi was hated in the western countries. During forty years they had spread terror through the neighbouring kingdoms, but when the imperial army arrived they were exterminated ; not one escaped. On the 6th of the fourth month (April 28) Ch'ang Te passed the city of GJii li-rh.^^^ There the snakes all have four feet and are five feet long. The head is black and the body yellow. The skin resembles that of the slia yil (shark). They eject from the mouth a handsome red substance.^^^
In Kuo K'an's biography we read : In the first month (January and February) of 1257, Kuo K'an reached Wu-li-rh (I suppose the same as Ghi-li-rh). The enemy was enticed into an ambuscade and defeated. Hai-ya su-t'an (Sultan Giath 1) submitted.
Ch'ang Te passed the city of (or the city belonging to) A-la-ding (Ala-eddin) and Ma-tze-ts ang-rli?^^ There the people had their hair dishevelled, and wrapped their heads with a red turban.
Kuo K'an's biography : Proceeding farther to the west, he reached the dominions of A-la-ding, and dispersed his army of 30,000 men. Ma-dsa-da-rh su-t'an surrendered. (There is evidently a confusion of the names.)
Henceforth Ch'ang Te's narrative loses the character of a diary. He says nothing more about the way followed farther on, or about his mission to Hulagu. The last date he gives in his diary is the 6th of the fourth month (April 28). His journey from Karakorum to Ghi-li-rh (some
where near Mazanderan), February 13th—April 28th,
It is impossible to identify this place, but probably it was near the eastern border of the province of Mazanderan. 362 Perhaps the traveller saw chameleons. These lizards, as is known, have a long prehensile tail. Their tongue is long and red, and covered with a viscid saliva, being darted at their prey. But chameleons are not so long as the narrative states. 3t;3 Perhaps Mazanderan is meant ; but in Kuo K'an's biography almost the same name is given to a sultan.

1259, had taken seventy- four days. Hulagu, as tlie Persian authors report, was at that time in Tebriz, where
he had established his residence. It was only in September of 1259 that he started for the expedition to Syria. The
rest of the Si shi ki consists, as we shall see, in relating the military events before Ch'ang Te's arrival, in accounts of the newly-conquered countries in Western Asia, their products, the customs of the people, &c. The traveller seems to report only what he had heard. At the end of the narrative it is stated that he was abroad fourteen months. His diary embraces only a period of two months and a half. No indication is found there where he spent the rest of the time. Let us see what the traveller further
reports.
Since the imperial (Mongol) armies had entered the Si yii (the countries of the west), about thirty realms had been conquered. There is a Buddhist kingdom {Fo km) called K'i-shi-mi {Cashmere), situated north-west of Yin-du {Hindustan). There the cloths and the cup of Shi-kia (Sakiamuni or Buddha) are handed down from generation to generation. The men in that country have a venerable and patriarchal appearance. They look like the paintings we see in China representing Ta-mop'^ They (the religious) eat only lenten food. One man consumes in a day one lio of rice. They spend the whole day till late at night in religious exercises and contemplation. ^"^^
The cup of a Buddhist monk {"patra in Sanskrit). 3^-5 Ta-mo is Bodhi-dharma, the twenty-eighth of the Buddhist patriarchs in India, who went to China in the first half of the sixth century, and established there the doctrine of Buddha (Edkins, "Chinese Buddhism," 99). The French missionaries in former times, who wished at any cost to prove the early existence of Christianity in China, when they first met the name of Ta-mo in Chinese books, had no doubt that the apostle Thomas was meant, who thus had carried the Christian faith to China. See Gaubil's "Histoire de I'Astronomie Chinoise," p. 56, note. One ho is as much as can be held with both hands placed together. 2^'' M. Polo (i. 175) states with respect to Cashmere: "Indeed this

In the year 1258^^^ the kingdom of Bao-da^'^^ was taken. It stretches from north to south 2000 li. The
king had the title of Ra-li-fa (calif). The city (the capital) was divided into a western and an eastern part.
A large river ran between them. The western city had no walls, but the eastern one was fortified, and the walls were
built of large bricks. The upper part of the walls was of splendid construction.^^! When the imperial army arrived beneath the walls, the battle began, and a great victory was gained over 400,000 men. At first the western city was taken and the population massacred ; then the army continued besieging the eastern city. After six days' storming it was taken,
country is the very original source from which idolatry {i.e., Buddhism) has spread abroad. " And farther on we read : '* There are in this country eremites, who dwell in seclusion and practise great abstinence in eating and drinking," &c. 368 \Yg j-ea.d in the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1253 : The emperor (Mangu) sent the generals Ta-ta-rh-dai and Sa-li tu-lu-hua to Hin-du-sz^ and K'ie-shi-mi-rh. This fact is confirmed by Rashid-eddin, who states that when Hulagu received orders to attack Iran, Salt noyen was sent with 2000 men to Hindustan and Cashmere to conquer and to govern these countries. He was subordinated to the command of Hulagu. Sail succeeded in conquering many countries, and made great booty, which he offered to Hulagu, together with many Hindu prisoners. As Rashid informs us that Sali belonged to the tribe of the Tatars Tutulcaliuts, it is possible that the correct reading of the above Chinese passage would be : The emperor sent the general Ta-ta-rh-dai Sa-li tu-lu-hua, &c, Tu-lu-hua is probably intended for daruga, governor. See note 695. Compare d'Ohsson, ii. 280, and Berezin's "Rashid," i. 63. '^^^ Remusat and Pauthier translate : 1257. The Chinese text has ting sze, which indeed answers to the year 1257. But as the Chinese year began in February, the end of the year ting sze was in January 1 258, and just in January 1258 Bagdad was taken, according to the Persian authors. ^''^ I may observe that M. Polo (i. 64) terms Bagdad Baudas. 3''^ This description of Bagdad agrees perfectly with the accounts left by the Mohammedan authors of the residence of the Calif. Ancient Bagdad was situated on the eastern border of the Tigris, and was fortified, whilst the suburb Karshi, situated on the western border, had no walls. ^''^ The Persian authors also state that Bagdad was taken after six days' storming.

and several tens of thousands were killed. The Ha-li-fa
tried to flee in a boat, but was captured.
In Kuo Kan's biography we find some additional details about the capture of Bagdad :

Bao-da is a great kingdom in the west. It is 8000 li in circumference. Between the two cities there runs a large river. At the time of the siege Kuo Kan constructed floating bridges to intercept the retreat of the enemy on the river. After the city was taken the Ha-li-fa tried to flee in a boat, but having seen that the river was barred, he went himself to the encampment (of the Mongols) and surrendered. In the same biography a general of the Ha-li-fa, by name Djouda-rh, is mentioned, who was pursued by Kuo Kan. In the evening the Mongol army was tired and wished to rest, but Kuo Kan did not permit this, and so proceeded more than ten li farther on. In the same night there was a heavy rain, and the place at which they first wished to rest was inundated, the water there being several feet deep. On the next day Hjou-da-rh was captured and executed. ^'^ Kuo Kan took more than three hundred cities.
The kingdom of the Ha-li-fa at that time, considering its wealth and its numerous population, stood at the head of all the realms in the regions of the west. The palace of the Ha-li-fa was built of fragrant and precious woods.^'^* The walls of it were constructed of black and white jade. It is impossible to imagine the quantity of gold and precious stones found there. The wives of the Ha-li-fa were all from China.^^^ There were large pearls called tai

Ch'en (properly Ch'en hiang), aloe-wood, highly prized in the East. It is yielded by Aquilaria Agallocha in India. The aloe-wood of Cochin-China is obtained from Aloexylon Agallochum. 2. Tan (properly t'an hiang) is sandal- wood, yielded by Santaluni album. 3. Wu mu, ebony, derived from various trees, the best from Diopyros Ehenus. 4. Hiang clien hiang, a red fragrant wood, obtained from Cyminosma resinosa, a tree of the Indian Archipelago, In Kuo K'an's biography it is stated that owing to the conflagration of the Calif's palace the air was impregnated with fragrance to a distance of a hundred li. An absurd statement. There is evidently some mistake in the text.

One time the Hali-fa had headache, and when his physicians could not help him, a man was sent for who played on a guitar of a new invention with seventy-two strings. His headache ceased immediately after he heard this music. The Ha-li-fa was venerated as a patriarch by all the people of the western countries who were subject to him.
T'ai sui is the planet Jupiter ; tan, a globule. Chardin ("Voyages en Perse," iii. 31) states that the Turks and the Tartars call the pearl "margeon," or globule of light. ^'''^ Evidently the name of a precious stone. See note 407. ^''^ Se se is not, as Pauthier believes, a musical instrument, but the name of a precious stone, produced, as the Chinese materia medica states (Pen ts'ao kang mu, viii. 55), in the country of the Mohammedans. That of a bluish-green colour, like the sea, was called se se at the time of the T'ang dynasty. It is probably the turquoise. See Appendix II., and note 512. The common Chinese name for diamond, and not, as Pauthier translates, an instrument for boring diamonds. According to the Mohammedan annals, the Califate of Bagdad endured 626 years, A.D. 632-1258, under fifty-one Califs. In the Yiian ch'ao pi shi we read that under the reign of Ogotai Khan, the general Charmahan (see note 280) sent, together with other products from Western Asia, a number of t'ohichaut (the Mongol plural form of t'obich'a) to the Mongol court. This term is explained there by "horses from Bageda with long necks and long legs," which description would suit the breed of the so-called Turkoman horses, highly prized even at the present day in Western Asia. In an Uigur-Chinese vocabulary of the fifteenth century t'obicKa is translated by ta si ma (big western horse). See also Shaw's "Vocabulary of the Turki Language," p. 71, topchaq= long-necked Turkoman horse ; andPavetde Courteille's "Mem. de Baber," preface.

To the west of Bao-da, twenty days' journey on horseback is the T'icn fang^'^ and in it the divine envoy of Heaven, the (first) patriarch of the western people, is

When trying to grasp it, only the true believers will succeed ; the unbelievers will never catch it. The people of the country have many sacred books written by the Pei-ijenia-rJi. The people are wealthy. There are more than
twenty cities.
^Ye read in Kno K'an's biography : To the west of Bao-da, at a distance of 3000 li, there is (the country of) T'ien famj. The general, Dja-shi, there sent a letter (to Hnlagu) in which he begged to offer his submission. All believed that his intention was sincere. His offer was accepted, and no precautionary measures were taken. But Kuo K'an made the following objection : Do not forget that treason on the part of the enemy can put our army in danger. In time of war all is deceit. We must take precautions, otherwise we risk bringing shame upon ourselves. Precautions were accordingly taken, and indeed Dju-shi came to attack our army ; but he was defeated by Kuo K'an. Ba-rh siian-t'an (Sultan Bar) surrendered.
To the west of T'ien fang is the kingdom of Mi-si-rh^^^^ a very rich country. There is gold in the ground. In the night at some places a brightness can be seen. The people mark it with a feather and charcoal. When dig

It is difficult to make these confused statements consistent with any of the military expeditions of the Mongols, as reported by the Mohammedan writers. Perhaps the war against Nassir Salah-eddin Yussuf in Syria is intended. Vassaf gives the text of two long letters Nassir exchanged with Hulagu before the hostilities began (d'Ohsson, iii, 294). Sultan Bar is perhaps the Emir Beibars, who commanded the Egyptian army, which entered Syria in 1260. 386 Egypt, the Mizraim of the Bible.

Biography of Kno K'an : In the year 1258 (or beginning of 1259, see note 369) the prince Hu-lie-ivu (Hulagu) ordered Kuo K'an to cross the sea on the west and subdue Fu-lang. He summoned the ruler to surrender. Wu-du suan-t'an said : " Last night I dreamed of a divine man. Now I see this divine man is the general." And he surrendered immediately. After this the imperial army returned.2^1

It is only in the night that the gatherer can see it." According to Kef erstein (" Mineralogia Poly glotta," 59, 60), the topazion of Strabo is not what we call topaz, but the chlorophan, a variety of fluor-spar, which exhibits a phosphorescent light when heated ; and exposed to the sun in the daytime it emits light in the darkness. Diodorus Siculus and Pliny mention the same stone. The island where it is found is in the Upper Nile, and has been visited by modern travellers. The Chinese envoy, Kan Ying, who about A.D. 1 00 reached the Mediterranean Sea, reported that in the country of 7'a Tsin (the Roman empire) there is a gem emitting light in the night. Ch'ang Te, in stating the same about gold, had probably misunderstood the story he heard about shining stones. 388 The character nai is probably a misprint for to, which is very like the former. Then the name of the Sultan would be K'o-to, and could be identified with Sultan Kuttuz, who at that time reigned in Egypt. P'u-sa (Bodhi-satva in Sanskrit) is one of the Buddhist saints, next to Buddha most venerated for his love and protection of living beings. His idol is represented in almost every Buddhist temple, often in the form of a female, and with curious ornaments, especially on the head. The Chinese are used to sleep in a nude condition. 391 Pu-lang doubtless the Franks are meant, the inhabitants of the western part of Europe. Since the beginning of the fifth century of our

era the Franks are frequently mentioned in the Byzantine annals, by which name the chroniclers always designate the nations of Latin and German origin. The old German tribe of the Franks first appears in Roman history under the reign of the Emperor Valerianus, a.d. 246-253. They then dwelt on the Lower Rhine, and afterwards gave rise to that powerful Franconian empire which, under Charles the Great, embraced a great part of Europe, and with which the history of France and Germany begins. In Du Gauge's " Glossarium Medite et Infimse Latinitatis," sub " Francia," we read: " Cum igitur tam late sese diffudisset Francorum nomen et virtus bellica et in exteras et remotas Europse regiones sese propagasset eorum imperium, inde factum, ut Graeci non modo, sed etiam Saraceni, Arabes et Abyssini, Europeanos populos Francorum nomine donarint." Du Cange then quotes many passages from ancient writers about the meaning of the word Frank. There can be no doubt that the Persian faranr/, applied even now-a-days to all European nations, originated from our Franks. D'Herbelot, in his " Bibliotheque Orientale," observes that the Mohammedan writers applied the term Fafange or Afrange (Arabic) to the whole of Europe, with the exception of Rum (the Byzantine or Greek empire, the Fo-lin of the Chinese authors). The Franks seem to have been unknown in Persia when the Sassanian dynasty reigned there (a.d. 226-652). In the " Shah-nameh " their name does not appear, whilst Rum is frequently mentioned there. Mas'udi, the well-known Arabic geographer and historian, is well informed regarding the Franks. The poet Saadi (beginning of the thirteenth century) was, it seems, the first Persian author who speaks of the Franks. As we learn from his " Gulistan," he was made prisoner by them in Tripoli. Compare about this term, used by the Mohammedans in the Middle Ages, Yule's "Cathay," 336. The mediaeval traveller Marignolli states : " They term us Franks, not from France, but from Frankland."

Ibid., 292. Pegolotti's "Notices of the Land Route to Cathay:" "They call Franks all the Christians of these parts from Romania westward." Romania, Rum of the Mohammedan authors, is the Greek or Byzantine empire. The statement of our Chinese traveller, that a Mongol general should have crossed the sea and summoned the king of the Franks, is absurd. It is, however, a fact that the Mongols had some differences with the Franks established at Sidon, and Hulagu gave orders to expel the Franks from Syria. In the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1 341 or 1 342, it is stated that the kingdom of Fo-lang sent as tribute a beautiful black horse, about eleven feet long and six feet eight inches high. It was black all over, except the feet, which were white. Colonel Yule has produced evidences (" Cathay," 340) that this horse spoken of in the Yiian annals was brought by Marignolli, who in his narrative states that he arrived at Peking in 1342, and brought great horses for the Khan. In the first edition of my " Notes on Chinese Mediaeval Travellers " I ventured to suggest that the name of Fu-lin or Fu-lan, applied in the

eggs are of the size of a sheng (a certain measure for
grain).^^^ There is a kingdom, Shi-lo-tze (Shiras), which produces
T'ang history to a country in the far west, may also be intended to designate the Franks. But now a closer inquiry into the facts convinces me
that this view is untenable. Tu-lin in the T'ang historj^—the name appears first in P'ei Kii's account of Western countries, beginning of the
seventh century— denotes the Byzantine empire or E.um of the Mohammedan authors ; not only the Asiatic part of it, as Dr. Hirth tries to prove in his very valuable book, " China and the Roman Orient." See also Colonel Yule's judicious investigations on the subject, " Cathay," Ivii. It is only once that the ancient name of Fu-lin occurs in the Yiian shi. In the biography of Ai-sie (perhaps Joshua or Joseph), Yiian shi, chap, cxxxiv., it is stated that his native country was Fu-lin. It is further said there that he was well versed in all languages of the West, and also in astronomy and medicine. He served at first Kuyuk Khan. Kubilai Khan entrusted him in 1263 with the direction of the astronomical and medical boards of the Si yii (Western Asia, Persia). Afterwards he received the title of Fu-lin loang (prince of Fu-lin). His sons and grandsons, as mentioned in the same biography, have all names which sound like names of Christians : Ye-li-ya (Elias), Lu-Jco (Luke), An-tun (Antony). One of his daughters was called A-na-si-mu-sz'
.
The large bird with camel's feet is the ostrich, in Persian shuturmurg (camel-bird). The statement that when it runs it flaps its wings is quite correct. As is well known, the ostrich, notwithstanding its wings being well developed, is not able to fly, but when running rapidly it always extends its wings, which fact is also alluded to in Holy Scripture, Job xxxix. 18 : "What time she lifteth up her wings (thus the correct English translation), she scorneth the horse and his rider." The ostrich, although found only in the desert of Africa and Western Asia, was known to the Chinese in early times, since their first intercourse with the countries of the far west. In the History of the Han {T'sien Ran shu, chap, xcvi.) it is stated that the Emperor Wu ti, B.C. 140-186, first sent an embassy to An-si, a country of Western Asia, which, according to the description given of it, can only be identified with ancient Parthia, the empire of the dynasty of the Arsacides. In this country, the Chinese chronicler records, a large bird from eight to nine feet high is found, the feet, the breast, and the neck of which make it resemble the camel. It eats barley. The name of this bird is ta ma tsio (the bird of the great horse). It is further stated that subsequently the ruler of An si sent an embassy to the Chinese emperor, and brought as a present the eggs of this great bird. In the Hou Han shu, chap, cxviii., an embassy from An si is mentioned again in A.D. 10 1. They brought as presents a lion and a large bird. In the History of the Wei dynasty, a.d. 386-558, where for the first time the name of Po-sz' occurs, used to designate Persia, it is recorded that in that country there is a large bird resembling a camel and laying eggs of large size. It has wings and cannot fly far, It eats grass and flesh, and swallows men.

pearls. The name of the ruler is Ao-sz A-fa-hei. To the south-west is the sea (Persian Gulf). The men who are engaged in pearl-fishing get into a leather bag, having
only their hands free. A rope is attached to their loins, and thus they glide down to the bottom of the sea. They take the pearl-oysters together with sand and mud, and put them in the bag. Sometimes they are attacked there below by sea-monsters, when they squirt vinegar against them and drive them away. When the bag has been filled up with oysters, they inform the men above by pulling the rope, and are then hoisted up. Sometimes it
happens that the pearl-fishers die (in the sea).
The biography of Kiio K'an states : The imperial army (after returning from Egypt and Syria) went to the south-west (it is not clear from what pLace) to the kingdom of Shi-lo-tze. The enemy's
In the History of the Tang (618-907) the camel-bird is again mentioned as a bird of Persia. It is also stated there that the ruler of T'u-huo-lo (Tokharestan) sent a camel-bird to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese materia medica Pen ts'ao Icang mu, written in the sixteenth century, gives (chap, xlix. ) a good description of the ostrich, compiled from ancient authors. It is said, amongst other things, to eat copper, iron, stones, &c. , and to have only two claws on its feet. Its legs are so strong that it can dangerously wound a man by jerking. It can run 300 li a day. Its native countries
are A-dan (Aden), Dju-ho (on the Eastern African coast). A rude but tolerably exact drawing of the camel-bird in the Pen ts'ao proves that the ostrich was well known to the Chinese in ancient times, and that they paid great attention to it. In the History of the Ming dynasty, chap, cccxxvi., the country oi Hu-lu-mo-sz' (Hormuz on the Persian Gulf), is mentioned as producing ostriches. In a learned article on the geographical distribution of the ostrich by the well-known ornithologists Hartlaub and Finch (Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," xvi. 380), it is observed that in recent books of ornithology the ostrich is always spoken of only as a bird of Africa, whilst Xenophon saw it on the borders of the Euphrates ; and ancient Persian authors as well as the Chinese mention it as a Persian bird, occurring even in the eastern part of Persia. The inquiries made on this subject by modern travellers have led to the interesting conclusion that up to the present time ostriches are met with, although not frequently, in Western Asia. The Prussian Consul at Damascus states that every year about 500 ostriches are killed in the deserts near that place. The well-known traveller, Vambery, informed the authors of the above-mentioned article that ostriches are well known in Kerman, and that they are also occasionally killed on the
Lower Oxus, near Kungrat,

The country of Yin-dio (Hindustan) (amongst the enumerated kingdoms) is the nearest to China. The population of it is estimated at twelve millions of families. There are in that country famous medicines, great wal

People who have to prefer a complaint strike against the bell. Then their names are registered and their cause is investigated. The houses are made of reeds.

Shi-lo-tze seems to denote Shiraz, the capital of Ears. At the time the Mongol armies invaded Western Asia, Ears formed a little realm governed by attabeys, or ancient governors of the Seldjuks, who had become independent. The Chinese characters a-t'a-hei are doubtless intended for this name. When the Mongol armies appeared in Persia, the atabey of Pars, Ahuhchr, had spontaneously rendered homage to Chinghiz, and was not troubled in his possessions. His son, Saad II., was with the army of Hulagu. After his death Mahomet was elevated to the dignity of atabey, but he was dethroned by his brother Seldjuh. Hulagu sent a division to Shiraz to punish Seldjuk, who was killed. Then Aish Khatun, a princess of the dynasty of the atabeys of Ears, who had married the son of Hulagu, was put on the throne. See Malcolm's " History of Persia," i. 388-398, and d'Ohsaon, iii. 400 scqq. What the Chinese author reports about pearl-fishing is quite exact, and sounds in some parts like a translation made from the statements of the ancient Arabic geographers regarding pearl-fishing in the Persian Gulf. Mas'udi, i. 328 ; Edrisi, i. 373, 374 ; Ibn Batuta, ii. 246. The island of Baharein is well known also in our days for the pearl-oyster beds in its neighbourhood, largely worked by the proprietors (Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," 1873, p. 37). •^^^ Ki she hiang (chicken-tongue-fragrance), more commonly called ting hiang (nail-fragrance), are cloves, the dried aromatic flower-buds of Caryophyllus aromaticus. •''^ According to the Pen ts'ao Jcang mu, chap. viii. 36, article t'ic, iron, pin t'ie is a very fine steel, brought from Po-sz' (Persia), which makes very sharp swords.

Polo's "steel and ondanique," which, according to Yule's learned investigations (" M. Polo," i. 93), is the famous "Indian steel." The custom of lying in water is still common during great heats in Sind and Mekran. Yule's " M. Polo," i. 123.

The biographer of Kiio K'an is evidently mistaken in speaking, after noticing Shiraz, of a country Fin t'ie, -which, as we have seen in the Si shi ki, is correctly mentioned among the products of India. In this biography it is clearly stated that the imperial army reached Pin t'ie. Kuo K'an defeated the enemy, and Sultan Gia-ye surrendered.
In the seventh month (July, August) of 1259, the Sultan A-dsao of the kingdom Wu-lin came to offer his submission. He surrendered 120 large and small cities with 70,000 families. In the mountains there much silver
is found.
The biographer of Kuo K'an states regarding the same events as follows : In the year 1259, the scattered army of the kingdom of Wu-lin, amounting to 40,000 warriors, was defeated. The Sultan A-oie ding, surrendered, and 124 cities were captured.^^''
The kingdom of the Hei K"i-tan (Black K*i-tan) is called KH-li-iuan. The name of the ruler is Hu-kiao-ma-ding. Having heard of the glory of the prince (Hulagu), he came to submit. He has a great city called Ba-li~szP^
The biography of Kuo K'an mentions also K'i-li-wan, and states that it is south of Wu-lin. The ruler is called Hu-du-ma-ding. After this in the biography it is said that the Si yii (Western Asia) was subdued, and Kuo K'an went home to the Emperor Mangu, arriving there a short time before the latter died. Mangu Khan died in August 1259.
With Kerman, Cliang Te finishes his enumeration of
3^'' I am not prepared to venture any identification with respect to the country Wu-lin and the name of its ruler as given by the Chinese authors. K'i-li-ivan is, no doubt, Kerman. The Chinese character tuan is easily misspelt for 7nan. The Chinese author is right in calling Kerman the kingdom of the Black K'i-tan, or Karahhitai (^a?-a = black in Mongol, as well as in the Turkish languages). This dynasty, originating in Eastern Asia (see note 22), reigned in Central and even Western Asia nearly a century, until it was overthrown by Chmghiz in 12 18, When the latter had left Persia, Borah Iladjih, at first an officer of the Khan of Karakhitai, afterwards entering the service of the Sultan of Khovarezm, had succeeded in establishing himself in Kerman, and founded a dynasty which maintained itself there till 1309 (d'Ohsson, iii. 5-7). The Sultan Hu-ldao-mading, or Hu-du-ma-ding, seems to be Kotb-eddin, who reigned about that time in Kerman, but he died in 1258 (d'Ohsson, iii, 133). As to the city of Ba-li-sz, it is probably Bardasir, called also KcwasJiir in ancient times the capital of Kerman. See Abulfeda, II. ii. 102 ; d'Ohsson, iii. 6.

The remainder of his report contains only an account of beasts, plants, precious stones, and other products found in western countries.

399 rpi^e proper name of the lion in Chinese is shi. The character tze, in the popular spoken language, is often appended to words without having any signification. The lion, although an inhabitant only of Africa and Western Asia, was known to the Chinese in early times. It is first mentioned in Chinese books in the second century B.C. In the Tsien Han s7iu, chap, xcvi., it is stated that in the kingdom of Wu-Jco-shan-U (the eastern part of Persia) the animal shi is found. The accounts of this and other western countries, as found in the History of the Early Han, had been gathered by the Chinese general Chang KHen, who, about 12S B.C., visited Western Asia. Most probably the character shi, properly meaning "master," was intended to render the Persian name of the lion, Avhich is shir. The character shi for lion, now used (with the radical "dog"), appears fii'st in a Chinese dictionary of about the year A.D. 600. The Hou Han shii, chap, cxviii., reports that in A.D. 87 the ruler of An-si (ancient Parthia) sent a lion and an ostrich as presents to the Emperor of China. In A.D. loi another lion was sent from there to China. In the History of the Northern Wei (386-558), where Persia is first described under the name of Po-sz\ lions are mentioned as beasts of that country. The History of the T ang speaks of a lion sent by the ruler of Kang (Samarkand) to the Emperor of China in the seventh century. In the fifteenth century, during the Ming period, lions were repeatedly carried from Western Asia to China. The lion enjoys still a great popularity in China, although now-a-days the Chinese know this beast only from ancient paintings, or from the grotesque ancient marble lions guarding the entrances of the palaces of the emperor or the princes. Li Shi cheri, the author of the Chinese materia medica Pen ts'ao kang mu, who wrote in the second half of the sixteenth century, gives in chap. xli. some interesting accounts regarding the lion, which prove that this animal has made upon the Chinese the same lofty impression as upon Western nations, who in their popular traditions always consider the lion as the king of animals. Li Shi chen, in explaining the Chinese name of the lion, suggests that it was originally called shi (master), as being the king of animals. Its Sanscrit name is seng gia (singha). It is found in the Western countries. It resembles the tiger, but is smaller. The colour of its skin is yellow or like gold. The head is large and like copper, the forehead is like iron, the claws are like iron hooks, the teeth like a saw, the ears are pointed, the nose is turned up, the eyes shine like

The wolves in those countries have also manes>*^^ The Jc icng tsio (peacocks) of the western countries are like the peacocks represented in our paintings, only they have the tail covered by the wings. But every day at
noon the tail opens like a splendid gre'en screen.^^^ There are also hiang mao (fragrant cats),^*^^ resembling
lightning. The roar of the lion resembles thunder. When the lion is enraged, it is imposing by its teeth ; when it is cheerful, it is imposing by its tail. The tail of the male lion has at its end a large tuft of hair. Its face is provided with whiskers. When the lion roars, all other beasts flee away
and the horses urinate blood. A good drawing of the lion is found in the ancient Chinese dictionary ya. The commentator of this dictionary, who wrote in the third century, tries to identify the lion (slii) with a beast suan
ni mentioned in the Rh ya—a completely arbitrary identification. The drawings accompanying most of the editions of this dictionary date from the eleventh or twelfth century of our era. The lion seems to have spread in ancient times over the whole of Western Asia, as far even as Transoxiana, and was also not uncommon in Greece. Alexander the Great is reported by Curtius to have killed a lion between the present Samarkand and Bokhara. We are told by the Persian authors that Hulagu, in 1256, arranged a lion-hunt near the Oxus, and that ten lions were killed. As far as I know at the present day of Western Asia, lions are found only in Southern Asia, especially near Shiraz. 400 Perhaps the author speaks of hyenas. I have often seen the Chinese name of the peacock translated by " bird of Confucius." Indeed the character h'ung represents Confucius's name, and tsio means bird. But the Chinese do not intend this meaning. K'ung means also great, excellent ; and in the days of Confucius the peacock was not known in China. It is first mentioned in the first century of our era in the Hou Han shu, chap, cxviii., amongst the animals found in T'iao-chi (Persia, Tadjiks). The Pen ts'ao kang mu, chap. xlix. fol. 17, gives mo-yu-lo as the Sanscrit name of this bird (its Sanscrit name is mayura, but in the Tamil language the peacock is myloo or mail, according to Balfour's " Cycl. of India "), and states that it occurs in Kiao-chi (CochinChina). In China it has always been considered as a rare bird, and our traveller Ch'ang Te seems only to have seen paintings of it in China. Now Chinese mandarins wear peacock feathers on their caps as a mark of distinction, but the bird is not frequently met with. As is known, the native country of the peacock is India, also the Indian Archipelago. The author means doubtless the civet cat, which produces the perfume known under the name of civet, and highly prized by the Orientals. There are two species of Viverra yielding this perfume

Africa, and V. zihetha in Asia, especially in India, Arabia. Both are kept in a half-domesticated state for the purpose of yielding civet. In the mountains west of Peking this name is applied to Felis microtis, a wild cat. The Pen tsao hang mu, chap. 1. fol. 83, writes the name Feng Tcio t'o (wind-footed camel), explaining that it means swift like the wind. The Chinese authors here mean the one-humped camel or dromedary [Camelus dromedarius). The latter name is derived from the Greek dpofias, ados, swift. So Strabo terms the swift camels with which Alexander the Great pursued Darius, and afterwards Bessus, the murderer of the Persian king, to Bactria. The one-humped camel is a native of Africa and the south-western part of Asia, whilst the two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus) is an inhabitant of Central Asia and Mongolia. In a wild state it is found in the deserts of Western Mongolia and Eastern Turkestan. It is remarkable that the existence of camels, and their usefulness as beasts of burden in different parts of the ancient world, depend upon certain climatic conditions which are diametrically opposite. The two-humped camel, inhabiting the vast plateau of Mongolia, where the winter is exceedingly cold, is not fit for supporting heat ; but in winter it is qualified to bear extreme cold, snowstorms, and want of nourishment for a long time. In winter-time the Russian mail between Kiakhta and Peking can only be carried by camels through the Mongolian desert. The western camels, on the contrary, are beasts fit only for the hot, sandy deserts of Africa and Western Asia, where the temperature in winter does not attain low degrees, and is very sensitive to snow and cold. Numbers of camel skeletons can be seen on the roads crossing mountain ranges in Persia and covered with snow in winter-time. Both the one and the two humped camels, although confined originally to different parts of Asia, were known in early times to the Eastern as well as to the Western Asiatics. On the bas-reliefs of the ruins of Persepolis the two-humped camel is frequently represented. On the other side, it can be proved from the Chinese annals that the Chinese, acquainted from remote times with the camel of Mongolia, knew also dromedaries in the second century B.C. It was again the general Chang K'ien (see note 399) who brought the first accounts of the camels with one hump only, found in the country of the Ta Tiie-ti (Massagetae), near the Oxus, Subsequently they are often mentioned in the dynastic histories, in the chapters treating of Western Asia. The two-humped (domestic) camel of Mongolia is larger and plumper-shaped than the dromedary, and cannot be trained for swift racing like the slender-shaped one-humped camel, Chardin, the wellknown Erench traveller, who visited Persia about two hundred years ago, states that the camels in Persia, trained for the service of the couriers, are

As regards wild camels, the Pen ts ao kang mu quotes an author of the eleventh century, who states that they are met with only in the deserts north-west of China proper. Their existence there, even in our days, has been ascertained by Przewalsky. 405 Tj;jg conveyance of letters by means of pigeons is an Oriental invention. The Persian mediceval authors mention repeatedly carrier-pigeons used in Western Asia, even in time of war. In 1262, when the Mongols besieged the city of Mossul, a tired pigeon, destined for the besieged, sat down on one of the catapults of the Mongols, and was caught. It was found that the pigeon carried the news of the approach of an army sent to relieve Mossul. The Mongols had just time to send a corps against the enemy (d'Ohsson, iii. 372). Carrier-pigeons are known also in China,
406 tsao hang mu, treating of the coral (chap. viii. fol. 53 —it is ranged there among the precious stones) ventures no explanation of the name shan hu. It seems not to be a Chinese name. Corals are not found in China. I find them for the first time mentioned in Chinese books, end of the first century of our era. It is said in the Hou Han shu, chap, cxviii., to be a product of Ta Tsin (the Roman empire). In the Tang shu, or History of the T'ang, chap. cclviii.&, article Fu lin (the Byzantine empire ; see note 391), some accounts of coral-fishing are given in the following terms : "The coral tree grows in the sea on rocks like mushrooms. It is at first of a white colour ; after a year it changes to yellow, and in the third 3^ear it becomes red. The branches of it are much entangled. The coral tree, which attains a height of three or four feet, is fished' up by iron nets, by means of which it is broken off from the rocks." This account dates from the seventh or eighth century. It is a short but quite correct description of coral-fishing as it is practised even in our days in the Mediterranean, the only sea where true red corals, Corallium rubrum, are found. The Pen ts'ao gives as the Sanscrit name of the coral, ho-hai-so-fu-lo. (There are two Sanscrit names for it, prabdta and vidruma ; the former is also used in Singhalese.) The red coral is highly valued in China. By lan-cKi and ya-sze evidently foreign names of precious stones are rendered. The first name is perhaps intended for ladjaverd, the Persian name for laipis lazuli, and ya-sze seems to render the Arabic yashm or yashb,

According to Emanuel (" Hist, of Prec. Stones," pp. 173, 174), it was most highly prized by the ancients. I have not seen jasper in China, but lapis lazuli is well known there. The Chinese call it tsing kin (azure gold). See also Appendix, article on "Precious Stones." 408 This legend is very ancient. It is related by Sinbad the Sailor in the ninth century. He had heard of a valley of diamonds (in India), and of the stratagems adopted by the merchants to procure them. At the season when eagles breed in the surrounding mountains, they throw vast joints of meat in this inaccessible valley strewed with diamonds. The diamonds, on whose points the meat fell, would adhere to it. The eagles descend from their lofty station to convey the prey to their nests. The merchants appear at the proper time, and by extreme vociferation compel the eagles to drop these precious morsels, which commonly afford these adventurers an ample compensation for their labour (Major's "India in the Fifteenth Century," xxxvi.). M. Polo (ii. 348) relates the same story. His version is the same as that given by the Chinese author. The sa-ha-rh of the Chinese author is, it seems, ambergris, the amber of the Arabs, called also sahabiri (Crawford's " Diet. Ind. Islands," 1 1). It is highly valued in perfumery by the Orientals. I find in Ibn Baithar's "Materia Medica," translated by Sontheimer, ii. 210, the following notice about the origin of amber : " There is at the bottom of the sea some substance which the sea-beasts eat, and then vomit it ; which is amber." The Fen ts'ao, chap, xliii. fol. 5, mentions ambergris under the name lung sien hiang (dragon's saliva perfume), and describes it as a sweet-scented product, which is obtained from the south-western sea. It is greasy, and at first yellowish white ; when dry, it forms pieces of a yellowish black colour. In spring whole herds of dragons swim in that sea, and vomit it out. Others say that it is found in the belly of a large fish. This description also doubtless points to ambergris, which in reality is a pathological secretion of the intestines of the spermaceti whale (PJiyseter macrocephalus), a large cetaceous animal. The best ambergi-is is collected on the Arabian coast. In the Ming shi, chap, cccxxvi., lung sien hiang is mentioned as a product of Bu-la-ioa [Brava, on the east coast of Africa), and an-ba-rh (evidently also ambergris) amongst the products of Dsu-fa-rh {Dsahfar, on the south coast of Arabia). In the Pen ts'ao the Mao yil is ranged among the scaly dragons. The character kiao is explained there by " crossed eyebrows." Evidently the two prominent bone ridges are meant, which stretch from the margin of

vomited substance hardens. (That is the sa-ha-rh.) The
price of it equals that of gold. It is adulterated with
rhinoceros excrements. The git-du-si is the horn of a large serpent. It has the
property of neutralising poison.*^^ The lung cluing ma (dragon-horses) are found in the western sea. They are provided with scales and horns. People do not allow mares with colts to graze near (the
sea-shore). The colts are drawn into the sea, and do not
come back.^^^ There is also a black eagle (tsao tiao). It lays only
the orbits to the nose of Crocodilus hiporcatus. The author of the Pen ts'ao gives gung-bi-lo as the Sanscrit name of the kiao yii. Indeed, the crocodile in Sanscrit is kumhhira. See also Fauvel's interesting article on "Alligators in China" (Journ. N. China Br. As. Soc, xiii.).
Gu-du-si {gu = bone, du = strong, si = rhinoceros). But these characters here are not to be translated, for they represent probably the foreign name of a medicine. Tor further particulars see Pen tsao, chap, xliii. fol. 40. The Cho Tceng lu, a work written in the fourteenth century, states
also that the gu-du-si is the horn of a large serpent. We read in the " Mirabilia " of Friar Jordanus (first half of the fourteenth century) that India Tertia (Africa) is the country of rhinoceroses, civet-cats, horned adders, true negroes, ambergris, and zebras (Yule's "Cathay," 182). There is in Northern Africa a viper, Cerastes cornutus, horned viper, well known to the ancients, and remarkable for its fatal venom and for two little horns formed by the scales above the eyes. In China as well as in India the people from time immemorial attribute also anti-poisonous virtues to the rhinoceros horn. The ancient materia medica attributed to Emperor Shen nung, B.C. 2700, states that the horn of the rhinoceros cures the hundred poisons." The rhinoceros and goblets made from the rhinoceros horn are repeatedly mentioned in the Chinese classics, and even at the present day the latter can be purchased everywhere in China, as in the days of Confucius. Compare about rhinoceros horns, Biisching's " Asien," ii. 838. The Chinese author had probably heard of the large cetaceous animal dugong, which is described in zoology under the name of Halicore cetacea. This beast is found in the Indian Ocean and also in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and frequents the shallow sea and the coasts, where it feeds on the submarine sea-grass pastures. According to Biisching, "Asien," ii. 836, the dugong is called Kadelkudira or sea-horse by the Tamulians. The word dugong is a corruption from the Malay duyong. The dugong has given rise, in ancient times, to many miraculous legends circulating among the Arabs and Persians. We ought not to wonder, when the Chinese author attributes to it horns and scales, according to Chinese views, indispensable decorations for a marvellous animal.

three eggs in one brood. From one of these eggs a dog comes out; it is of a grey colonr and short-haired. It follows the shadow of its mother (when she flies). In hunting game it is always successful. The lung chung yang (literally, " sheep planted on hillocks ") are also produced in the western countries. The people take the navel of a sheep, plant it in the ground and water it. When it hears thunder it grows, the navel retaining a connection with the ground. After the beast has become full grown they take a stick and frighten it. Then the navel breaks off and the sheep begins to walk and eats grass. In autumn it can be eaten. The flesh of the navel (of the butchered sheep) can be planted again.*^^
' ^^-^ It is not difficult to divine that this miraculous story of a lamb which grows like a plant is nothing other than the reproduction of the mediaeval legend of the lamb-plant, Tartarian lamb, Agnus scythicus. Eriar Odoric, in the fourteenth century, was the first European traveller who referred to this story (Yule's " Cathay," 144), but it must have been current much earlier in Western countries, for the Chinese authors mention it in the ninth century. In the T'ang shu, chap, cclviii.6, article Fu-Un (Byzantine empire), I find the following account : " There are in the country of Eu-lin sheep which grow from the ground. The people wait till they shoot out, and then surround (the plant or beast) with a wall, to protect it against wild beasts. If the umbilical cord connecting the lamb with the ground
is cut off, it will die. (There is another method to keep it living. ) A man duly caparisoned mounts a horse and rushes upon the lamb. At the same time a great noise is made to frighten it. Then the lamb cries, the umbilical cord breaks off, and it goes to graze." According to Odoric's report, these lambs are found in large melons. Hieron. Cardanus, and after him J. C. Scaliger (both in the first half of the sixteenth century), in their account of this miraculous lamb, state that th.e Agnus scythicus is found in the lands of the noble Tartar horde called Zavollia (meaning beyond the Wolga, for za in Eussian beyond). The seed is like that of a melon, but the plant, which is called Sarome^^, or "the lamb" (baran = sheep in Russian), grows to the height of about three feet in the form of that animal, with feet, hoofs, ears, &c., complete, only having in lieu of horns two cui'ly locks of hair. If wounded, it bleeds ; wolves are greedily fond of it. In 1725 Dr. Breyn of Dantzig first declared that the pretended Agnus scythicus was nothing more that the root of a large fern covered with its natural yellow down, and accompanied by some of the stems, &c., in order, when placed in an inverted position, the better to represent the appearance of the legs and horns of a quadruped. Linn^us in 1 752 received a fern from Southern China, gathered by Osbeck, and did not hesitate in declaring it to be the Agnus scythicus, and to name it Polypodium Barometz. Loureiro

There is a woman in those western countries who understands the language of the horses, and can predict
(in this way) good and evil. Many other marvellous things are seen there, but all
cannot be reported. Ch'ang Te's journey to the western countries and back had taken eleven months (the Hai kuo t'u chi has fourteen months).
Here the report of Cli ang Te's journey concludes. Lm Yio, the author of the Si Shi Ki, adds the following remarks :

The Si yil (the countries in the west) was first opened (for China) by the general Chang ICien (see note 74), Those countries, their mountains and rivers, have up to our days been the same ; but as those times belong to remote antiquity, the names of the countries have changed, and it is difficult to inquire into their political changes. What at the present day is called Han hai was in ancient time Kin shan}^^ The Yin-du of our day is the same as Shendn of the Han dynasty.^^^ The camel-bird (now found in western countries) is the ta ma tsio of the kingdom of An-si (see note 392). Mi-si-rh is the same as the kingdom

He gives heu tsie as the Chinese name {i.e., hou tsi, dog's back, from the resemblance of the rhizoma of the plant to a dog, as the Chinese botanical works state). Modern botanists called the plant Cibotium Barometz. It is a tropical plant, found in South China, Assam, and on the Sandwich Islands. Nowhere in the books at my disposal can I find mention of it near the Wolga. The English Cyclopaedia (quoted by Yule), in assigning to this plant an elevated salt plain to the west of the "W olga, derived its information, it seems, only from Scaliger's conjecture. How then can Th. Moore state in the ''Treasury of Botany" that the Agnus scythicus is without doubt the Cibotium Barometz ? Mediaeval travellers as well as the Chinese annals agree in assigning to this marvellous plant-animal the countries of Western Asia or Eastern Europe. ^^^ The Chinese author is wrong. Man hai and Kin sTian (the Altai) are not the same. See note 9. The general Chang K'ien brought the first information about Shen-tu.

Fu-lin, mentioned in the time of T'ang.^^^ This can be proved by comparing the products, customs, &c., of the respective countries (as mentioned in different times).
Tor instance, the T'ang shu states that Fu lin is 40,000 li distant from the (Chinese) capital ; that it is situated on the borders of the sea, and that it is rich in rare and precious products. All agree well with the recent statements (about Mi-si-rh), and there can be no doubt as to the identity.

THE PEEEGEINATIONS OF YE-LU HI LIANG

(Translated from his biography in the Ylian shi, chap, clxxx.)
Ye-lu Hi LIANG ^Yas the great-grandson of Ye-lit Ch'io tsai, Chinghiz Khan's and Ogotai's minister, and the author of
the Si yu lu, translated in the first section of this part of
my Eesearches. The name of Hi liang's father was Clm. Hi liang was b.orn iied.T Ho-lin (Karakorum; see note 304). Father and son were both distinguished scholars, and held offices under Hien tsung (Mangu Khan). In the year 1258, when the emperor encamped near the mountain Liu pan shan,'^^'^ Hi liang was with him ; and when Mangu subsequently
This mountain has still the same name. On modern Chinese maps it is marked south of the city of Ktt yiian chou, department of P'ing liang, in Kan sic. According to the Chinese annals, T'ung Men hang mu, Chinghiz died near the Liu pan shan in 1227, after having subdued the Tangut empire. The Ylian shi, however, implies that he died in Northern Mongolia. We read there, in the annals, s. a. 1227, that in the fifth intercalary month the emperor moved to the mountain Liu pan shan in order to avoid the heat of the summer. In the sixth month the empire of the Ilia (Tangut) submitted. Chinghiz rested on the river Si Jciang in the district of Tsing shut (in Kansu ; it has still the same name). In autumn, in the seventh month (August), on the day jen luu, the emperor fell ill, and eight days later died in his palace Ha-lao-t'u on the river Sa-li. This river Sali is repeatedly mentioned in the Yiian shi, viz., in the first chapter, in connection with the first military doings of Chinghiz. Rashid reports (d'Ohsson, i. 58) that Chinghiz in 1199 retired to his residence Sari Jcihar. The Yiian ch'ao pi shi (Palladius' transl., 81) writes the same name Saa?^ Iceher [I'cher in modern Mongol means "a plain"). On the ancient map of Mongolia found in the Yuan shi lei pien, Sa-U Vie-rh is marked south of

directed his host southward, Hi liang and his father accompanied him. In the year 1259 the emperor died in Shto,'^^^ when Hi liang with the heavy baggage (of the army) proceeded northward to the province of Shen si. In the next year, 1260, Shi tsu (Kubilai Khan) was elected emperor, when A-li-hii-ko revolted (against his brother). Kubilai sent to Hun-du-hai to require him to appear.
the river Wa-nan (the Onon of our maps), and close to Sa-li Tcie-rh we read, " Here was the original abode of the Yuan " (Mongols). Thus it seems the passage in the Yiian history translated above intimates that Chinghiz died in Mongolia, and not near the Liu p an shan, as is generally believed. The Yiian ch'ao pi shi (Pall, transl., 152) and the Ts'in cheng lu (Pall, transl., 195) both agree in stating that, after subduing the Tangut empire, Chinghiz returned home, and then died. Colonel Yule in his " M, Polo," i 240, states " that Rashid calls the place of Chinghiz' death Leung shan, which appears to be the mountain range still so called in the heart of Shensi." I am not aware from what translation of Rashid Yule's statement is derived, but d'Ohsson, i. 375, note, seems to quote the same passage in translating from Rashid : " Liu-pan-shan was situated on the frontiers of the Churchc (empire of the Kin), Nangias (empire of the Sung), and Tangut ; " which statement is quite correct. In 1258, when Mangu Khan waged war with the Sung, and commanded his host in person, he had for a time established his head-quarters in the mountains of Liu pan slian (Yiian shi, s. a.), and then proceeded to the province of Sze ch'uan, where he died. Shu is the ancient name for what is now called the Chinese province of Sze cKuan. There are some discrepancies in the reports of the Western and Eastern chroniclers respecting the death of Mangu. The Chinese annals T'ung kien kang mu record that he died in the seventh month (end of July or August) of 1259, before the walls of Ho chou, a city of Sze ch'uan (30° 8' N. lat.), which had been besieged without success for several months. The Yiian shi gives the 13th of the seventh month (August 3), 1259, as the date of Mangu's death, and states that he died, after an illness of several weeks, near the mountain Tiao yic shan (in the vicinity of Hochou). Abulfaragius makes him die by an arrow-shot. Haithon says that he was drowned, while Rashid tells us that he died from dysentery. Arihhuga was the youngest brother of Mangu and Kubilai. When Mangu set out for China in 1257, he left Arikbuga in command of Karakorum with Alemdar as his coadjutor. After Mangu's death and the election of Kubilai, Arikbuga laid claim to the supreme khanship.

APPENDIX I.
THE JOURNEY OF HAITHON, KING OF LITTLE ARMENIA, TO MONGOLIA AND BACK, a.d. 1254
1255.
It may not be out of place to review here, in completion of my notes on Chinese mediseval travellers, this interesting narrative, to which frequent reference has been made in these pages. It mentions also many of the places marked on the Chinese mediaeval map of Central and Western Asia, upon which I shall comment in another part of my Mediaeval Eesearches. The account of Haithon's journey was originally written in Armenian by Kirakos Gandsaketsi,^^^ who belonged to the suite of King Haithon (Klaproth). A manuscript copy of it, dated 16 16, was found in the monastery of Sanahin in Southern Georgia, and was translated into Russian by the Armenian Prince Argutinsky, and published in the Ptussian periodical " Sihirsky Westnik," 1822, p. 69, seqq. Klaproth translated it from the Eussian version into
French. See " Nouv. Journ. Asiat.," xii. (1833), 273. In 1870 M. Brosset translated into French all the writings left by Kirakos, and also Haithon's journey (" Memoires de I'Academie des Sc. de St. Petersb."). The same Armenian author was translated into Eussian by Professor Patkanoff in 1 874. For the English version of the narrative here given, I have of course compared all the translations just mentioned. Haithon I. (or Hethiim, as the name is written in the Armenian manuscript), son of Constantine Eupen, became
He was a native of Gandsak, the present Elisa-vetpol (Patkanoff).

king by his marriage with Isabella, daughter and only child of Leon II., king of Little Armenia (Cilicia). Haithon ascended the throne in 1224, abdicated in 1269 in favour of his son, Leon III., and then became a monk.^^*^ He died in 1271. The narrative of his journey
is entitled :

JOURNEY OF HETHUM, THE PIOUS KING OF THE ARMENIANS, TO BATU AND MANGU KHANS, IN 703 AND 704 (OF THE ARMENIAN ERA), A.D. 1254-I255.
The pious friend of Christ, Hethum, king of Armenia, who resided in the city of Sis in Cilicia, had sent his brother, Sempad, commander-in-chief of his troops, to Giug Khan (Kicyuk), with presents. Sempad returned from the court of the Khan, where he had been well received, brino;in(x letters from the monarch.^^^ After Mangu Khan's accession, the great hasiliopator and general, Batu, who had established himself in the north, on the borders of a large river called Mhil,^^^ which falls into the Caspian Sea, sent to King Hethum ordering him to come and proceed to the court of Mangu Khan.
King Eaithon I. is not to be confounded with his kinsman, Haithon, prince of Gorhigos, who also became a monk, and spent the latter part of his life in a monastery in Poitiers, in France. He is the author of a History (and Geography) of the Eastern Kingdoms, written in 1307 by Nicolas Falcon in French, from the dictation of Haithon (Bergeron's " Voyages en Asie "). Falcon afterwards translated this account into Latin ("Historia Oi'ientalis "). Falcon's original French manuscript, which bears the title " Merveilles des XIIL Hoyaulmes d'Aise," was published in 1877 by L. de Backer in his "Extreme Orient au Moyen-age," But Backer is egregiously mistaken in asserting (p. 22) that this Haithon, prince of Gorhigos, was the same as Kirakos, who wrote the account of King Haithon's journey to Mongolia. According to Patkanoff, Kirakos states that he was born in 1 20 1. It is also ascertained that he died in 1272. According to Brosset, Sempad left his native country in 1248, and returned home in 1250 in the company of the son of Gaiat-eddin, Sultan of
Rum. We possess a letter from Sempad, written on the journey. See Yule's "Cathay," cxxvii. 452 rpjjg Yolga river, called amongst all the nations of Asia Mil, Etcl, or £dzil.

Hethum, who feared him, departed secretly and in disguise, for he had to pass through the dominions of the Turks, governed by the Sultan of Bum, who hated Hethum on account of succour he had received from the Tatars, The name of the Sultan was Aghadin.'^^'^ He rapidly traversed the territory of the Sultan, and in twelve days reached the city of Kars,^^^ where he presented himself to Bachu noyan,^^^ the commander-in-chief of the Tatar army in the East. He visited also other great personages, by whom he was entertained with honour. After this he halted in the district of Aragatsotn,^^^ in front of Mount Arai, in the village Vardenis, in the house of a prince called Kurd. This prince, who was an Armenian, was a Christian, as well as his sons, Vache and Hassan. His wife, Khorishah, was of the race of the Mamikonians, daughter of Marzpan, and sister of Aslanbek and Gregory. Hethum remained in this place until they had brought him the wealth of his palace, which was requisite for the presents he had to make, and which was forwarded to him by his father, the prince of princes, Constantine, who then was an old man, and by his sons, Leo and Thorose, whom he had entrusted with the government during his absence, his wife, the pious Zalel, being dead. The name of Zabel is the same as Elizaheth, namely, " the week of God ; " and, conformably to the true interpretation of her name, she reposed on the will of God. This princess, the daughter of the great king Levan (Leo), the first that was crowned, was kind, indulgent, and a friend of the needy.
Patkanoff reads A la-cddin. But the diarist means probably Yzz-eddin or Rohn-eddin, the sons of Ghiath-eddin ( + 1245), who at the time here spoken of disputed about the possession of the throne of Rum. They had a younger brother, Ala-eddin, whom they had dispatched to the Great Khan, and who died on the way' thither (d'Ohsson iii. 92 seqq.). This city of Armenia now belongs to Russia. This Mongol general, who then devastated the western part of Persia, is frequently spoken of by the Mohammedan authors. In 1246 the Pope sent the Friar Anselm with a letter to Baidju (d'Ohsson, ii. 221, iii. 79). According to Klaproth's investigations, near the celebrated convent Echmiadzin, in the vicinity of Mount Ararat.

When the great patriarch, Constantine, learned that the king had passed without accident, and was in Great Armenia, he despatched to him the vartaped Jacoh, a wise and eloquent man, whom he had sent formerly to JoJm, the king of the Greeks, who possessed Asia, to form a contract of friendship and alliance. The lord Tcr-Stcphen, bishop, and the vartabed Mikhitar of the monastery of Skcvra, went there likewise. The priest Basil, who was sent from Batu ; Thorose, a regular priest, who had come
with him ; Karajpet, priest of the king's palace, a gentle and well-informed man. All these and many princes came and accompanied the king through the country of the Aghovans^^'^ and the gate of Derhend,^^^ which is the
same as the fortress Chor. They visited Batu and his son Sartakh,'^^^ who was a Christian, and were overwhelmed with honour by them. Hethum was then sent by them to Mangu Khan, by a very long road, beyond the Caspian Sea. They set off on the 13th May 1254. After passing the river Ayekh,^^^ they arrived at 0?^^^^ which is half way between Batu and Mangu Khan (i.e., between their respective residences). Thence they proceeded to the river Ertich (Irtysh), entered the country of Naiman,^^^ and then arrived at Khara Khetai}^^
Patkanoff identifies this name with Albania of Ptolemy and Strabo (or Shirvan). Compare also Rubruk, 266, Albania. In the ancient wall which runs from the castle of Derbend on the Caspian Sea along the ridges of Caucasus. ^•^^ Batu, grandson of Chinghiz. He conquered Russia, and established his chief residence at Sarai, on the banks of the Akhtuba branch of the Volga. Sartakh, the second son of Batu, is mentioned also by E-ubruk (253, 375). Bar Hebrseus informs us that he loved the Christian religion, that he was baptized, learned to read, and became aS^deacon. After the death of his father in 1 2 55, he set off from the Volga and went to Mangu
Khan in order to obtain the investiture of Kipchak, but he died on the way (Klaproth). The Ylian shi writes his name Sa-li-ta. The laik of the Middle Ages is the Ural river of our maps. Perhaps the Organum of Rubruk, the present province of Hi. See note 285. The tribe of the Naiman. See note 98. Karakhitai. See note 22. ^

On the 13th of Septemlier Hethum reached Tataristan (Mongolia) ; and on the day of the consecration of the cross (September 14) had an audience with Mangu Khan, the splendid and glorious lord. He offered presents to him, and was honoured by the Khan according to his rank. The king remained fifty days in the ordo.*^^ Mangu Khan had given to him a diploma, attested by a seal, to prevent any one troubling either him or his country. He received likewise a letter of enfranchisement of the churches throughout the country. The king departed on the ist of ISTovember. In thirty days he arrived at Gumagicr (or Gumsgur),^^^ went on to Berbaligh, and then to Beshhaligh}^'^ After this they went through a desert country inhabited by naked wild men with horse-hair on their heads. The breasts of the females were extremely large and pendant. These people have no language.^^^ There are also wild horses of yellow and black colour.^^^ The (wild) mules are of white and black colour, and larger than common horses and donkeys.^^^
^^"^ Rubnik in his narrative states (p. 375) that on his way back from Mongolia in 1254, when he was at a distance of twenty days' journey from Karakorum, he met Sartakh (see note 459), who, with his herds, wives, and children, went to Mangu Khan. He heard that the king of Armenia went in advance, and had passed about the end of August. Mangu Khan then was probably in Karakorum or somewhere near it.
A place unknown to me. Haithon most probably went by the same way as Ye-lli Ch'u ts'ai and Ch'ang ch'un, Bisklalih. See note 157. 468 T[je story of wild men in the Dsungarian desert seems to have been current in the Middle Ages. Carpini's report on the subject (648, 649) reads as follows : " Prope civitatem Oviyl (Emil ; see note 313) ad meridiem est quoddam desertum magnum, in quo sylvestres homines pro certo habitare dicuntur, qui nullo modo loquuntur, nec in cruribus habent juncturas ; et si quando cadunt, per se surgere sine aliorum adjutorio minime possunt
;
sed tantam discretionem habent quod faciunt filtra de lana camelorum, quibus vestiuntur, et ponunt etiam contra ventum ; et si aliqui Tartari vadunt ad eos et vulnerant eos sagittis, ponunt gramina in vulneribus et fortiter fugiunt ante eos." 469 Przevvalsky, as he relates in his " Tibet " (41 seqq.), saw wild horses in the Dsungarian desert. Some of them were piebald. '^''o The Chinese call wild mules the djigetai, Equus hemionus of the Mongolian desert. It is about the size of a mule and of a yellowish colour.

Wild camels, with two humps, are seen there like

Wild camels, with two humps, are likewise noticed by Przewalsky, I. c, 43, as inhabiting the Dsungarian desert. This is the Chang -ha-la in Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary. See note 162. Haithon, on his way back, evidently went by the same way as Ch'ang ch'un and Ye-lli Ch'u ts' ai.
A place Gu-t'a-ha is marked on the Chinese mediaeval map west of Djambalik. It is probably the same as KkutuTcbai of our maps, which is the name of a place north-west of Urumtsi, on the great way to Kuldja. ^''^ On the Chinese mediaeval map a place Yang-gi-ba-li appears west of Gu-t'a-ba (Khutapai of Haithon). ^''5 Regarding Pulad, see note 16. The name Suthul and the appellation " sea of milk " have been satisfactorily explained by Klaproth. In the Kirghiz language, sutkul even now means " lake of milk ; " and this name is applied by the Kirghizes to Lake Sairam of our maps, situated in the mountains north of Kuldja. Sairam, or, as Klaproth writes, Sairini or Chagan Sairim nor (the white lake of tranquillity), is its Mongol name. See also note 167. ^-^^ This is evidently a corruption of Almalik, which city was situated near present Kuldja. See note 19. 478 This seems to be the same as I-U-ha-li of the Chinese mediaeval map, marked there south-west of A-li-ma-li. '^''^ Su or ussu means " river " in Mongol. By Ilan su evidently the Hi river is meant. 480 Here probably the Alatau is meant, the high mountain chain which stretches from east to west, north of Lake Issikul. The traveller proceeding from Kuldja to Tashkend has to cross a branch of the Alatau in the Kasteh pass. See notes 185, 325. '^^ Regarding the city of Talas, which was situated near present Aulieata, see note 23. 482 gy. u East " here Western Asia, i.e., the Orient in our sense, is meant. See p. 115, Hulagu's sojourn in Turkestan in 1254 and 1255.



I70 HAITHON.
Segnakh, where there is the mountain KharcJiuh, whence came the Seldjuks. It commences from the Thoros mountain and runs on to Parcliin,^^^ where it ends. They went (turned aside) to meet Sartakh, the son of Batu, who was on his way to Mangu Khan/^* and then proceeded to Sengakh^^^ and Savran,^^^ which is a very large city; after which they passed through Kharachuh, Ason, Sori (or Savri), Otrar, Zurnukh, and arrived at Bizak!^^^
^3 Of the greater part of the above names I can make nothing. They may refer to obscure places not mentioned by other mediaeval authors. Segnakh is noticed by E-ashid. When Chinghiz had reached Otrar in 1 219, he divided his army into four corps, one of which, under the command of his son Djuchi, was sent along the Sihun downward. The first city the Mongols captured on this way was Signac. See d'Ohsson, i. 221. According to Lerch ("Archaeological Journey to Turkestan"), the ruins of this city are found forty-two versts south-east of Fort Djulek (on the Syr-daria), and distant eighteen versts from that river. These ruins are called Sunak-kurgan. See also the great Russian map of Turkestan. The mountain Kharchuh, which commences from the Thoros and runs to Parchin, is without doubt the mountain chain which stretches in a north-western direction between the rivers Talas and^Syr-daria, and appears on modern maps as Karatau. The Thoros of the Armenian diarist is the Alatau and its western continuation, the Alexander's chain. After Signac, Djuchi took, as the Mohammedan historians report, Barkhalighkend (d'Ohsson, i. 222). This is the same as Ba-rh-cKi-li-han of the Chinese mediaeval map, the Ba-rh-djen of the Ytian shi, the Barchin of PI. Carpini (750), and the Parchin in Haithon's itinerary. It is difficult to reconcile this statement with Rubruk's report that he met Sartakh, about six months earlier, on his way to Mangu, twenty days' journey from Karakorum. See note 464. Klaproth takes Sengakh and the afore-mentioned Segnakh to be the same, and he seems to be right. Haithon from Signac turned aside to visit Sartakh, and then returned to Signac. According to Lerch [1. c), who visited in 1867 the ruins of ancient Sauram or Sabran, they are situated fifty versts north-west of the city of Turkestan, on the post-road to Fort Perovsky. Edrisi and Yakut mention Sabran, as do also the historians of the time of Timur. Lerch is of opinion that Ason is the same as Yassi, which in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries was the name of the modern city of Turkestan. It is mentioned by the historians of Timur and by Mirkhond. Sherifeddin as well as Abd-er-Razzak notice a place called Kharachuk between Yassi and Sabran. This agrees with Haithon's itinerary. On the great Russian map of Turkestan a river Karachih appears west of Turkestan. It discharges into the Syr-daria. On the great Russian map of Turkestan the ruins of Otrar are marked



HAITHON. 171
From Dizak they reached in thirty days Samarhand}^^ Next they came to Saripid, Kerman, and BoJcara,'^^^ and
crossed farther on the great river DJeihim.^^^ Then they went to Mermn, Saraskh, and Tus, which is before you get to KJiomssan,'^^'^ called also Rogastan. After that they entered Mazanderan, passed through Bestan, and then the country of Erak, on the frontier of Midhed, came to Damgan, and reached the great city of BeiJ^^^ Thence they reached Khazvin, Avklier, Zanghian, Miana. From here in twelve days they arrived at Tavrej}^^ After twenty-six days more, and having passed the river Emskh (Araxes), they arrived at Sisian, the residence of Bachu nuyeii, the general of the Tatar army>^* The latter sent
about six English miles north-east of the mouth of the Arr/s, an eastern affluent of the Syr-daria, and at a distance of about fifty miles south-east of Sauram. Lerch visited these ruins. See note 27.
A place Zurnuk is mentioned by the Mohammedan mediaeval authors. Chinghiz, after the capture of Otrar, besieged Zernuk ; took it, and then proceeded to Bokhara (d'Ohsson), i. 227. Yakut states that this place was situated beyond Khodjend in Turkestan, but its actual position is not ascertained. Dizak in Haithon's itinerary is the city of DjisaTc of modern maps about sixty-six English miles north-east of Samarkand. 488 There is evidently a mistake in the figure. Patkanoff observes that Saripul is on the Zarafshan river ; but I cannot find this place on the map of Turkestan. Kerman is the city of Kermineh, situated on the road from Samarkand to Bokhara. They crossed the Djeihun or Amu-daria probably at Amol (called also Amuyeh), which was somewhere near the present Chardjui. '^^^ Mermen is Merv-Shahdjan. Serakhs and Tus, two well-known cities in Khorassan. From Merv, Haithon's itinerary presents no difficulty whatever, and we may trace it on our maps of Asia. The country of Erak, on the frontier of Mulhed {Mulahida, Ismaelians ; see note 289), is Irak Adjemi, the largest province of Persia. With respect to Hei, see note 293. Kazvin, Ahhar, Zendjan, Miane, Tavris, well known cities of Northern Persia. ^^^ Compare note 455. The Friar Anselm and his companions, sent by the Pope with a letter to Baidju, arrived at the camp of this general, which was near the castle of Sitiens, in 1 247. This latter name is probably identical with Sisian in Haithon's itinerary. According to Patkanoff, this place lies between the Gokcha lake and the Araxes.



172 HAITHON.
Hethum to Khoja nuyen, whom he had left in command of the army in his stead, and went himself, taking the principal part of his troops, to meet Hulavu^ brother of Mangu Khan, who had come from the east. At length the pious king Hethum reached the house of Prince Kurd, in the village Vardenis, where he had left his officers and his baggage. He there waited the return of the priest Basil, whom he had again sent to Batu, to communicate to him the letters and order of Mangu Khan, and to cause him to issue orders conformably to their tenour. I omit the rest of the narrative, which presents no geographical interest. Eight months after quitting the court of Mangu Khan, Haithon arrived in the country of the Armenians. This was in 1255 (end of July).

APPENDIX 11.
A CHINESE MEDLEVAL ACCOUNT OF WESTERN PRECIOUS STONES.
In the Clio heng hi, notes on different matters referring to the time of the Mongol dynasty, written by a learned Chinese in the fourteenth century, an article is found (chap, vii.) entitled Hui-lmi shi foit (" Precious Stones of the Mohammedans "). This notice reads as follows :

The precious stones in the countries of the Mohammedans vary in appearance and in price. Towards the end of the reign of Kubilai Khan (end of the thirteenth century), one of the rich Mohammedan merchants sold a red la (balas ruby) to the emperor. It weighed one Hang
and tln^ee tsien, and was estimated at 140,000 ting, paid in bank-notes.*^^ The emperor placed it on the top of his cap, and thus it was afterwards successively transmitted from one emperor to another. The emperors always put it on at the new year, on their birthdays, and on other solemn occasions. The following are the precious stones I {i.e., the Chinese author) know, and I shall give a list of them :

I. Eed stones, of which there are four kinds. The la. When of a pale red colour it is very beau
tiful.496
One liang = ten tsHen = oz. avoird. One ting at the time of Kubilai Khan was fifty liang silver

not, as Pauthier erroneously states (M. Polo, 320), ten liang. But the paper money was worth only a tenth of its nominal value. La denotes lal, which is the Persian name for the halas ruby, which is of a rose-red colour. See Keferstein's "Mineralogia Polyglotta," 1849, p. 20, and Emanuel's "History of Precious Stones," 1867, p. 220. Now-adays the name for ruby in China is hung pao shi (red precious stone).



174 PRECIOUS STONES.
The hi-dje-da. The stones which are of a deep red colour and thin are the most valuable/^^
The si-la-iii is of a dark red colonr.*^^ The gu-mu-lan has an irregular colour ; it is red mixed with dark, yellow. This stone is found in large pieces, and is the least valuable of the above mentioned.^^^ 2. Green stones. There are three kinds found together in the same mines. The dju-ha-hi takes the first rank. It is of a deep green
colour.^o^
The dju-mii-la is of medium quality.^^^
The sa-hu-ni, which is of a pale green, belongs to a lower
class.^^^
3. The stones called ya-hu or ya-gu.^^^ The red ya-gu has on the surface a white water.^^* The ma-sze-gen-di. Without lustre. A variegated stone. This stone and the red ya-gu are dug from the same mines.^^^ There are three kinds of blue ya-gii, viz. :

According to Keferstein, p. 23, the Persians call bidjade a red precious stone of India. He believes it to be the garnet. Si-la-ni means probably "from Ceylon," It is known that very fine rubies and other precious stones come from that island. I do not know what red stone is meant by gu-mu-lan. Keferstein, p. 68, gives Jcumala as the Malayan name of a precious stone of extraordinary beauty. Perhaps opal. 500 The green stones of the Chinese author are without doubt emeralds, and the names given to them can easily be recognised as Arabic and Persian names for different varieties of this stone. See Keferstein, I. c, 43. The name dsobab, meaning " cantharides," flies with beautiful green wings, was applied by the Arabs to a first-quality emerald of a deep green colour. ^'^^ This name is probably intended for zmerud or samurod, general names for emerald in Persian and Arabic. Even now the emerald in Peking bears a similar name, being called dsu-mu-lu. But it is also known under the name of lii pao shi (green precious stone). Sabuni, meaning "soap-green," is the Persian name of an inferior kind of emerald of a pale colour. In Arabic and Persian the name yalcut is applied to what we call ruby and corundum (Keferstein, 1 1, 28). The Mohammedan authors distinguish red, blue, yellow, white yakuts. This is a ruby. I cannot find in Keferstein a name sounding like this.



PRECIOUS STONES. 175
First quality, of a deep blue colour.^^^ The ni-la7i, medium quality, of a pale blue colour.^^^ The tvu'po ni-lan, lower quality, of a muddy blue
colour. The yellow ya-gu.^^^
The white ya-gu.^^^ 4. Stones belonging to the category mao-tsing.^^^
The (true) mao-tsing has a fibre of lustre in the interior. The tsou sliiii ski when dug from the mines resembles
the mao'tsing.^^'^
5. Stones called ticn-tzc}'^^ The ni-she-hu-di (i.e., from ni-she-hu or Nishapur). This is the species found in the country of the Mohammedans. It is distinguished by its fine structure.
506 "jij^ig ig what we call sapphire or blue corundum. Now-a-days in China it is called Ian pao shi (blue precious stone). ^^"^ The name nilan is applied in Hindustan to the blue sapphire. 508 Tiie yellow corundum or sapphire, known to jewellers under the name of Oriental topaz (Keferstein, 17). This is what we call the white sapphire (Keferstein, 17). 5^*^ 3Iao tsing means " cat's-pupil," and denotes the same stone as known to us under the name of cat's-eyc. Now-a-days the Chinese call it mao yen (cat's-eye). The Chinese as well as Europeans derived these names from the peculiar lustre of the stone, resembling, when held towards the light the contracted pupil of the eye of a cat. This name means " stone with walking water " (undulating lustre). The stone may be identified with the chrysoberyl or cymophane. The latter name means in Greek "floating light." In the Pen tsao hang mu, chap. viii. fol. 55, article Pao shi (precious stones), it is stated that the stone called tien tze is of a greenish blue {pi) colour, and that at the time of the T'ang dynasty it was known under the name of se-se. See note 378. I have little doubt that by tien tze (the first character means properly indigo) the Chinese mediaeval authors understood the turquoise, the Persian name of which is firuze. Now very miserable Chinese turquoises of a greenish blue colour are sold at Peking under the name of sung rh shi (pine-stone). It is known that the beautiful blue stone which we call turquoise is dug near Nishapur. The Juaher nameh, a MS. treatise on precious stones, quoted by Ouseley ("Travels in Persia," i. 21 1), mentions four places in Asia where turquoises are found, viz., Nishapur, Shebavek in Kirman, a mountain in Adjerbeidjan, and Khodjend. M. Polo, i. 91, 93, states that the kingdom of Kerman produces the stones called turquoises. Barbosa, in 1 5 10, states that the true turquoises are found in Niexer (Nishapur) and Quirimane, country of Sheikh Ismail (Stanley's transl., p. 216).



176 PRECIOUS STONES.
The hH-li-ma-ni (i.e., from Kirman). It is also called
Ho si tien tze (tien tze from Ho si),^-^* and has a coarse
structure. The stone of King chou, called also tien tze from Siang yangp-^ It changes its colour.
China, and especially the capital, is very rich in precious stones, but as very few kinds of them are produced in this country, it is evident that they have been brought from abroad ; and I suppose most of the beautiful rubies, sapphires, emeralds, &c., sold in Peking, and emanating for the greater part from the establishments of impoverished princes and nobles, came to China in early times, and especially at the time Western Asia was devastated and plundered by the Mongols.
s^"^ Ho si (west of the Yellow River) is a Chinese mediaeval name for the Tangut country. King chou is the ancient name of a Chinese province. It answers to parts of the provinces of Hu nan and Hu pei. The department of Siang yang is in Hu pei. It is true that the turquoise sometimes changes its colour. Pumpelly ("Geol. Researches in China, Mongolia, Japan," ii8) notices the existence of sung ur shi, a mineral similar to turquoise, in the province of Yiin nan.

( 179 )
In this second part of my researches, I wish to render
accessible to European scholars interested in the mediseval history and geography of Asia some accounts found in ancient Chinese and Monsjol works, and referrino: to the days of Mongol supremacy in Asia. As I have access to many special sources of information with respect to Eastern Asiatic literature, I have been enabled to gather a considerable amount of material, not previously published, bearing on the history and the geographical knowledge of that period. These Eastern sources of information will generally prove to be meagre and fragmentary, and sometimes they only become intelligible when compared with the detailed records left behind by the Arabic and Persian chroniclers ; but they have nevertheless a considerable interest, and we shall see that much fresh light is derived from Chinese and Mongol writers, in corroboration of the statements of European mediseval travellers across the Asiatic continent, and in elucidating dubious questions with respect to Asiatic history and geography. It is now a rule adopted for all branches of knowledge that in scientific researches the leading idea must be to bring to
light the truth. With respect to some sciences—as, for in
stance, geography—this aim can be obtained with more or less completeness by means of direct observations. But as to history, and especially history of remote times, we depend entirely upon the statements and views of ancient chroniclers, whose style is often far from being clear, whilst the veracity of their reports is not always to be relied on. The same must be said with respect to ancient geographical accounts and narratives of travels. For researches in these departments it is therefore of great importance to com

pare the statements of several contemporaneous authors who have written on the same subject. Judging from this point of view, it seems to me that the ancient historical and geographical accounts of the Chinese, as far as they treat of nations, countries, and events spoken of also by Western writers, present a high interest ; all the more so when we have to compare statements on the same subject of nations so diametrically different in their mode
of viewing things.
BIBLIOGEAPHICAL NOTICES.
It has appeared desirable to put at the head of this essay a critical review of the works from which the information dealt with in these pages has been derived. I may begin with the Chinese and Mongol literature. Among the Chinese works extant treating of the history and geography of Asia in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Yiian shi or Chinese History of the Mongol dynasty without doubt takes the first rank. It is only to be regretted that the work has been compiled with great carelessness by the Chinese scholars of the Ming dynasty who had been entrusted with this task. In the annals of the 3fing shi or History of the Ming, suh anno 1369 (a year after the expulsion of the Mongols from China), we find the following statement with respect to the compilation of the Ylian shi :

" In this year the detailed records of the reigns of the thirteen Ylian emperors were procured, and the emperor (Hung wu) gave orders to compile the history of the Yuan, under the direction of Sung Lien and Wang Wei. The work, which occupied sixteen scholars, was begun in the second month of 1369, and finished in the eighth month of the same year. But as at that time the record of the reign of Shun ti (the last Mongol emperor in China) was not yet received, the scholar Ou yang Yu and others were



BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. i8i
sent to Fci pHng^^'^ to obtain the required information. In the sixth month of 1370 the Yiian shi was complete."
A new edition of the Ylian history was published during the reign of Kia tsing (1522-67). The edition to which my frequent quotations from the Yiian shi always refer bears the date of 1603. There were several other editions of the work issued under the Ming. As far as I know, three editions of the Yiian shi have
been published under the present dynasty—one in 1659, another about the middle of the last century, and the third in the present century. I may venture a few remarks with respect to the second one, which is an unhappy revision
of the former editions. A learned committee, consisting of Chinese, Manchus, Alongols, Western Mohammedans, &c., was appointed by the Emperor K^ien lung (1736-96) to revise the Yiian shi, and especially the foreign names of men, places, &c., occurring so frequently in that work. These savants, in their reformatory zeal, proceeded on the idea that all the proper names had been incorrectly rendered in the official documents of the Mongols, and had to be changed. They
pronounced the same verdict with respect to the histories
of the Liao and the Kin. Thus in the new editions of the
histories of the Liao., Kin, and Yiian, all the original proper names without exception disappeared, and were replaced by names of a new invention, which generally have
little resemblance to the original. By this way of corrupting the names in the original histories, which have generally rendered foreign names as correctly as the Chinese language permits, the ICien lung editions of these works have become completely unserviceable for historical and geographical investigations. K'ien lung was very proud of the happy idea of metamorphosing the

l82 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.
ancient proper names, and issued an edict that in future no Chinese scholar should dare to use the ancient names. When the three histories had been corrupted, K'ien lung ordered the same committee to explain the meanings of the new names ; and this gave rise to a new work entitled Ziao Kin Yuan shi yii hiai, or explanation of words (proper names) found in the histories of the Liao, Kin, and Ylian. In this vocabulary, all the names of men,
countries, places, mountains, rivers, &c., in the three histories have been systematically arranged, but according to the new spelling. The original spelling of the name, however, is always given, and the chapters are indicated where the name occurs. This renders the vocabulary very useful for reference, and we may lay aside the fact that the principal object in view of the learned committee was the absurd explanation of the meaning of the newly-invented names. I may give a few examples of the sagacity these savants displayed in their etymological commentaries. In
the original edition of the Ylian shi the title of the Calif of Bagdad is quite correctly rendered by Ha-li-fa. The committee changed Ha-li-fa into farhha, and explains that it means a village in Manchu. By Bie-sJii-ha-li in the uncorrupted Yuan shi, Bislibalih is to be understood. The meaning of this name in the Turkish languages is " five cities," and the Chinese term Wu ch'eng, meaning also " five cities," occurs repeatedly in the Yuan shi as a synonym of Bie-shi-ha-li. The committee, however, transformed the
name into Ba-shi-ho-li, and states that hasJii in the language of the Mohammedans means " head," and holi " kidneys." The river Kerulun in Northern Mongolia, and not at all far from Peking, was termed K'ie-hi-lien in the original Ylian shi ; but the committee found this name dissonant, and invented the more euphonic name Gi-lu-rh for this river. None of the ancient proper names in the Ylian shi found mercy with the severe critics. This may serve as an example of what the Chinese of the last century mean by scientific research.

The most recent edition of the Ylian slii (also with corrupted proper names) is dated 1824, but it was only finished in 1848. The numerous translations from the Mongol history found in Pauthier's " Marco Polo " have all been made from this corrupted text. At the time Eemusat and Klaproth wrote, the Yiian shi was unknown in Europe, and it seems that even the old Catholic missionaries in PekiuCT had not seen it. The old sinologues knew only an extract of the great Mongol history (see farther on). The Ylian shi has been compiled from official documents. Perhaps we must except the biographies, for which the information was probably often derived from private sources. It seems that the greater part of the documents on which the Chinese history of the Mongols is based had been drawn up in the Chinese language ; but in some cases they appear to have been translated from the Mongol. I conclude this from the fact that in the Yiian shi places are often mentioned, not, as usually, by their Chinese names, but by their Mongol names represented in Chinese characters. I may quote a few instances, and select such
topics as will at the same time serve to corroborate the statements of Marco Polo and Eashid-eddin who, as is known, generally mentioned places and countries of Eastern Asia by their Mongol names. The province of Yiln oian, in the south-western part of China proper, bears this name in the annals of the Yiian shi (as in our days), and in the geographical part of it we find it mentioned as one of the twelve provinces of China. But M. Polo and Eashid always term this province Carajang (M. Polo, ii. 36 ; d'Ohsson, ii. 639), probably a local name adopted by the Mongols. Polo and Eashid both state that the capital of this province is called Yachi,
which latter place Klaproth tries to identify with Wei cJi'u, Pauthier with Zi kiang fii. Eashid states further (Quatremere, " Histoire des Mongols," pref.) that some of the inhabitants of . Carajang are white, and these are . called

Chagan jang by the Mongols. These names do not appear in the Chinese annals, nor in the description of Yiin nan in the Yiian shi (geogr. part). In the latter account Gara jang and Chagan jang are rendered by Wu man and Po man (Black and White Barbarians). But in the biographies of Djao-a-Uo-pan, A-T-s%elan (Yuan shi, chap, cxxiii.), and others, these tribes are mentioned under the names of Ha-la-djang and CKa-han-djang, as the Mongols used to call them ; and in the biography of Wu-liang-ho t'ai (see note 303), the conqueror of Yun nan, it is stated that the capital of the Black Barbarians was called Ta-cKi. It is described there as a city surrounded by lakes from three sides. In the annals of the Yiian shi, the tribe of the Onguts,
so called by Eashid—Polo styles them Ung (i. 276) —is mentioned under its Chinese name Fo Ta-ta (White Tatars), whilst in the biographies it is termed Wang-gu, sometimes Ynng-gu, There can be no doubt about the identity of the Fo Ta-ta and the Wang-gn. In the biography of A-la-wu-sze TH-gi Hu-li (chap, cxviii.), it is stated that he was the chief of the tribe of Wang-gu. Chinghiz bestowed one of his daughters on A-la-wu-sze's son as wife.^i^ But in the annals of the Yiian shi, s.a. 1203, the same A-la-wu-sze is spoken of as the chief of the Fo Ta-ta, who surrendered to Chinghiz. Si Hia (Western Hia) or Ho si (west of the Yellow Eiver) was the Chinese name of the Tangut empire. In the annals of the Yuan shi it is always designated by these names, but in the biographies this kingdom and the people are generally called by their Mongol name, i.e., Tang-wu. This name occurs frequently there. A number of valiant warriors in the Mongol army were of Tangut origin. M. Polo, i. 206, describes the great province of Tangut.^is
Rashid calls this chief of the Onguts Alakush T'lkin huri, stating that TiTcin Tcuri is a title (d'Ohsson, i. 84). The country of the Tanguts was known to the Mongols also under

The name for the Ydloiu River in the Yiian shi is generally Ho.^^^ The Mongols called it, and call it even now, Kara murcn, or the Black Eiver. In the narratives of M. Polo and other mediaeval travellers, and in Kashid's records, the river appears likewise under the name of Kara murcn. In one instance this Mongol name is applied to the Yellow Eiver also in the Yuan shi, and written there Ha-la mu-lien (chap, c, imperial pasture
lands). The Ylian shi comprises 210 chapters in four sections. The first section, Pen hi (47 chapters), contains the biographies of the thirteen Mongol emperors in Mongolia and China, and the historical records (annals) of their reigns, beginning with Chingliiz and ending with Shun ti, who was overthrown by the Ming in 1368. The first chapter treats first of the history of the Mongols before Chinghiz, and then records the doings of the reign of the great conqueror. The second chapter comprises the reign of Ogotai and Kuyiok, and the third that of Mangio. The next fourteen chapters (4-17) are devoted to Kubilai Khan. The remainder of the annals continues the history of the Mongol empire in China to the fall of the dynasty. The second section, Chi, memoirs, chap. 48-105. Chap. 48, 49.

the name of Kashi or Koslii (d'Ohsson i, 95). Klaproth ("Nouveau Journ. Asiat.," xi. 464) translates a passage from Rashid, in which it is said that the country of the Tanguts is called also Hoa si, which means "west of the great river " in the language of the Katayans. Ho, meaning simply ''the river," is the name by which the Yellow River is designated in the most ancient Chinese topography, found in the chapter Yii hung of the Shu hing. The name Huang ho, or Yellow River, appears first in the Tai ping huan yil Jci, a description of the Chinese empire, end of the tenth century. ^-^ In chapter xlviii. an interesting account of the astronomical instruments placed in 1279 on the observatory of Ta tu (Peking) is given. A. Wylie has translated this notice in his article on the Mongol astronomical instruments. Two of these instruments are still extant, and Wylie gives a photograph of them.

superintendency was established for the three ports of iCing yuan (the present Ning po), Shang hai, and Can pu. These three ports depended on the provmce of Fa Jcien, the capital of which was Tsiian chou. Farther on, the ports of Fang chou and Fu chou are also mentioned in connection with foreign trade. Chang chou (in Fu kien, near Amoy) is only once
spoken of there. We meet further the names of Wen chou and Kuang chou as seaports for foreign trade in the Mongol time. But Tsiian chou in this article on the sea-trade seems to be considered as the most important of the seaports, and it is repeatedly referred to. I have, therefore, no doubt that the port of Zayton of Western mediaeval travellers can only be identified with Ts iian chou, not with Chang chou, as has been suggested by some commentators of M. Polo (Phillips, Douglas. See Yule's "M. Polo," ii. 217, 219, 222). There are many other reasons found in Chinese works in favour of this view. Gan p u of the Yiian shi is the seaport Gan fu of M. Polo (i. 173). Fang chou, as is known, is Polo's Kinsay. Compare M. Polo, i. 429. Compare M. Polo, i. 419. By djan-cKi a Mongol word is rendered. Even in modern Mongol a post-station is called djam or dzam (northern pronunciation). Properly it means " way." European mediaeval travellers (E-ubruk, M. Polo) call the Mongol post-stations yam or yamb, and the diarist of the embassy of Shah Rokh to the Chinese court in 1420 uses the same name, yam-Jchane, for the post-houses in China (M, Polo, i. 420, 423). Pauthier, in his "M. Polo," p. I335, suggests
that the word yam may be intended for yi ma, '
' qui en chinois signifie poste aux chevaux." But yi ma means a post-horse, not a station. There is no Chinese etymology in the word yam, which even now-a-days is used by the Tatars of Kazan to designate a post-station ; and the Russian word

yamshchiJc, meaning a driver carrying the post, has evidently been borrowed originally from the Tatars, There are in the Russian language a good many Tatar words. The Russian linguists generally derive the word yam from the Mongol dzam, supposing that it was pronounced yam in ancient times. But we have seen that the Yiian shi renders quite correctly the Mongol djam, and we may conclude that this was the Mongol term for post-station even in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all the more as the Mongol text of the Yiian ch'ao pi shi (written in 1240, see farther on) also uses djam-cJii for postal communication. I may observe that the character djan, by which the Mongol word for station has been rendered in the Yiian shi, means also station in Chinese ; but the addition of the character cJii, which here represents only a sound, proves that djan-cKi was intended to express a foreign word. Yam is probably of Turkish origin. See M. Polo, i. 421. See M. Polo, i. 389.

The remainder of the biographies record the lives and
doings of eminent statesmen, officers, generals, scholars, artists, priests, and even remarkable women, &c. The biographical section of the Yiian shi contains a great amount of information with respect to the ancient geography and history of Asia. It is not easy, however, to lay it under contribution, for the accounts, which are scattered over nearly a hundred chapters, are generally short and fragmentary, and have chiefly a value with respect to comparative investigations. The biographies found in the Yiian shi bear evidence to the liberal views of the Mongol emperors as to the acknowledgment of merit. They seem never to have been influenced by national considerations. Among the prominent men whose biographies are included in the Mongol history, we meet representatives of most of the nations of Asia subdued by the Mongol arms, viz., Chinese, KH-tan, Nil-chi, Tanguts, Onguts, Uigurs, Kanglis, Alans, Kipchaks, KarhiJcs, Merkits, Persians, and other Mohammedans, &c.

the Mongol emperors ; others distinguished themselves as valiant captains. The Mongols were conscious of the
intellectual superiority of the more civilised nations. Kubilai, after establishing his power in China, did not oblige the Chinese to learn Mongol. He was, on the contrary, a protector of Chinese literature, which was very flourishing in the days of the Mongols. Of course the greater part of the biographical section of the Yuan shi is devoted to persons of Mongol origin; but we are not surprised at finding that, with a few exceptions, all the distinguished Mongols belonged to the army, or were darugaclii (governors) in the provinces. The fourth section of the Yuan shi concludes with some accounts of various foreign nations and countries, east and south of China, and some seaports of India (chap. 208-210).

In 1828, Father Hyacinth translated the first three chapters of the Yuan shi into Kussian, with the title " History of the Eeign of the first four Khans of Chinghiz Khan's Dynasty." His version is very correct ; it is to be regretted, however, that this accomplished sinologue translated from the corrupted text of the Yuan shi. It is therefore impossible to make use of his version without comparing it with the original Chinese text. A complete translation of the original text of the Ylian shi would be a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the mediaeval history and geography of Asia. It would throw much fresh light especially on the history of the Mongols, and be serviceable to explain many dubious questions in the narratives of European mediseval travellers.

contiuuation of the Hung Men lu ; the latter being a historical work embracing the annals of the Wii tai period (907-960), the Sung, Ziao, Hia, and Kin dynasties. The Yuan shi lei pien, although only an abstract of the Yuan shi, is a very valuable book of reference ; for the learned author has added a great deal of interesting matter, drawn for the greater part from rare works of the Mongol period. The first ten chapters comprise an abstract of the annals of the Ylian shi, and have been translated by Father Gaubil in his "Histoire de Gentchisean et de toute la Dynastie des Mongous," 1739. A curious ancient map is found at the head of the Yuan shi lei pien. It bears the title so mo t'u, "map of the desert," and comprises the Mongolian desert and the adjacent countries. The map has the appearance of a reproduction of an ancient map compiled in the . days of the Mongols. There are some names of places marked, especially in the neighbourhood of Karakorum, which are not mentioned in the Ylian shi or in other works ; and it is very unlikely that Kiai shan drew this map up from the descriptions at his disposal. A. Eemusat in his " Eecherches sur la Ville de Kara-koroum" (18 1 7), gives an incomplete reproduction of it. See also

In 1866, Archimandrite Palladius made the learned world (in Eussia) acquainted with a Chinese, or rather Mongol historical work of considerable importance. In the fourth volume of the " Eecords of the Eussian Ecclesiastical Mission at Pekiag" he presented a Eussian translation of the Yuan diao pi shi, or " Secret History of the Mongol Dynasty." In the introduction to his translation Palladius gives a minutely detailed history of the work, from which we learn that it was originally written in Mongol, and had been finished in a.d. 1240 at the time of a great assembly on the river Kerulun. It treats of the early history of the Mongols, the reign of Chinghiz, and the beginning of the reign of Ogotai. In the early



BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 193
Ming time a Chinese translation of it was made. Tlie text translated by Palladius is included in tlie same collec
tion in AYliicli the narrative of Cliang cliun's travels is found (see note 80). The Yiian ch'ao pi shi is mentioned in the Hung wu slii lie or detailed record of the reign of Bung wu, under the year 1382. It is stated there that it had been written in Uigur letters in Mongol, and that a Chinese translation of it Avas made, to which the Monojol
text was annexed, —not in the original letters, but by rendering the Mongol sounds by Chinese characters. After Palladius had published his translation, he happened in 1872 to obtain a MS. copy of the Ming edition of the work, the Chinese text, accompanied with the Mongol text (in Chinese characters). It was found that the text Palladius had translated was only an abstract of the original work, which comprises fifteen chapters, but has no title. Although many archaisms and clerical errors occur in this text, the restoration of the Mong-ol orisrinal presents little difficulty for men acquainted with both Chinese and MongoL Por all who have made the history of the Mongols their study, this rare document of ancient Mongol literature presents a high interest. It corroborates generally Eashid-eddin's records, and occasionally we find
passages in it which sound like a literal translation of the statements of the Persian historiographer. This proves that Eashid had made use of the same source of information as the unknown author of the Ylian cli ao pi shi. As to the dates in the latter work, they are generally in accordance with the dates given by the Mohammedan authors ; but in a few cases the Ylian ch'ao pi shi commits great chronological blunders and misplacements of events, as, for instance, with respect to the war in the west (see
farther on).
Palladius' MS. copy of the Yiian cliao pi shi now belongs to the library of the St. Petersburg University. An accomplished Mongol scholar, Professor Pozdneyeff, has
undertaken to publish a facsimile of the texts with a N

translation and notes. The preface and the greater part of the texts have already been printed.
In the Eussian " Oriental Eecord/' 1872, Archim. Palladius has published the translation of another ancient historical record referring to the warlike doings of Chinghiz. The Chinese title of the book, of which Palladius possessed only a MS. copy, is Huang yuan sTieng wu Tsin clieng lu. It seems to have been compiled from Mongol documents in the first half of the fourteenth century, but the author is unknown. This work is repeatedly quoted in the Yuan shi lei pien.
I may also mention a history of the Mongols compiled in the middle of the seventeenth century by the Mongol prince Ssanang Ssetsen. A German translation of it was published in 1829 by J. Schmidt in St. Petersburg. There is also a Chinese translation of the work extant, known under the name of Meng-gu yiian lu. It seems that this Mongol history is based principally on traditions, not on official documents ; therefore it sometimes diverges widely from the other more authentic records of Mongol history we know; and with respect to the dates, it is quite untrustworthy. Professor Berezin in his translation of Eashid (see farther on) says that the non-existence of
Ssanang Ssetsen's history would be no loss to historical science.
Finally, in reviewing the Chinese and Mongol works treating of the history of the Mongols, I ought not to omit mentioning the Clio heng lu, written in the middle of the fourteenth century by the learned Tao Tsung yi. It comprises thirty chapters, and contains notes on different matters referring to the time of the Mongol dynasty. There is in it a considerable amount of information with respect to the customs, institutions, &c., of the Mongols,

grapliical accounts "bearing on that period. I have had an opportunity of giving translations from the Cho keng lu in my Archseological Eesearches on Peking and in the first part of the present volume. In the first chapter of the work we find a list of the names of seventy-two Mongol
tribes, and after this other lists of nations and tribes in China, Eastern and Central Asia.
As the Chinese and Mongol sources of information with respect to the Mongol nation are very little known to European scholars, our historians who have written the history of the Mongols have relied almost entirely upon the Mohammedan historiographers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, whose conscientious records concerning the Mongol era are indeed entitled to the greatest confidence. The Chinese and Mongol chroniclers never present so detailed, coherent, and intelligible accounts as do the able Persian historiographers on the same subject ; but, as I have stated above, I assign to the authors of the Far East also a great importance, and especially with
respect to comparative historical researches. The subsequent notices concerning the Mohammedan authors who wrote on the Mongols are borrowed from d'Ohsson's " Histoire des Mongols," where more detailed accounts on this subject will be found. I mention only the most important Persian works.
The Tarihh Djihan Kushai, or history of the conqueror of the world, written by Alai-eddin Atta mulk Djuveni, records the events of the last ten years of Chinghiz Khan's reign. It first gives an account of the conquest of Transoxiana and Persia by the Mongols. After this the reigns of Ogotai and Kuyuk and the beginning of the reign of Mangu are treated of. It terminates in 1257. In this history we find also interesting accounts of the Uigurs and the Karahhitai, of which I shall give a

translation farther on. Alai-eddin in 1252 accompanied his father, who was in the Mongol service, to the grand Knriltai held at the accession of Mangu Khan. He died
in 1283. The Tarikh Djihankushai has been continued by Ahdullah, son of Fazel-ullah, more generally known under his honorific title Vassaf id Hazret, or the "panegyrist of his majesty." It contains the history of the Mongols
from 1257 to 1327.
Among the Persian authors who wrote on the Mongols and other nations of Eastern and Central Asia, and the
great political events which shook the different states of Asia in the thirteenth century, the first rank is incontestably due to the celebrated historiographer Rasliidedclin, who in his remarkable work Djami %it Tewarihh^ or collection of annals, gives the most complete and intel
ligible record of the history of the Mongols. Besides this, we find in his book very valuable and detailed accounts of the nomadic Tatar and Turkish tribes who in the days of Chinghiz lived in Eastern and Central Asia. One chapter is devoted to a very interesting and quite exact description of China or Khitai and the adjacent countries at the close of the thirteenth century. Eashid was born at Hamadan about A.D. 1 247, and was a physician by profession.^^^ Ghazan Khan named him vizier of the Persian empire in 1298. He continued in
In the Tarilch-i-Khata, or History of China, which A. Miiller Greiffenhag attributes to Abdallah Beidavi, and which he translated into Latin in 1677, we find two passages (edition of 1689, pp. 5-6, 12-13) where it is clearly stated that Rashid was a Chinaman : " E,exido'd Din Vezirius, e Philosophis Chatajorum, Lilagi et Melcsun nomine, terris Him g-ping -xang oriundus." But Quatremere in his " Histoire des Mongols," preface, pp. 4» 85, 99, has proved that, although Miiller's translation is correct, there
was an omission in Miiller's Persian text. We have to understand that Pulad ChinJcsanl; who assisted Rashid in the compilation of his history of the Mongols, was a native of Khata. Besides this, Quatremere has had the ingenuity to guess that the Tarikh-i-Khata, dated 1317, and attributed by Muller to Abdallah Beidavi (who however died in 1292), in reality was

the office of vizier during the reign of Oldjaitu, to whom he presented his work in 1307. Eashid was put to death by order of Abu Said in 131 8. He states in the preface to his work that in compiling itfhe was considerably aided by the great noyen Pulad cliinksank (a Mongol evidently), generalissimo and minister of the empire, " who knows better than any man living the origin and history of the Turkish tribes, and especially of that of the Mongols." Eashid mentions also important historical documents with respect to the history of the Mongols preserved in the archives of Ghazan Khan, and to which he had access. He speaks further of the Mongol annals called Altaii depter (golden book), kept in the treasure-house of the Khan, and committed to the charge of the senior of the Begs (Berezin's Eussian translation of Eashid, i. pp. 8
and 183). The first attempt to translate the Djami ut Tevarikli was made by a German orientalist. Hammer PurgstaU, who selected for this purpose one of the most interesting chapters of the book, the account of China proper. But Klaproth found much fault with Hammer's version, especially in the defective decipherment of proper names, and published a new translation in correction of Hammer in
1833, in the "jSTouv. Journ. Asiat.," xi. Another translation of the same chapter is found in d'Ohsson, ii. 633. See also Quatremere's "Histoire des Mongols," preface, 86-90. In d'Ohsson Histoire des Mongols,'' of which the first edition appeared in 1824 (see farther on), the main authority
written by Benaketi. A MS. copy of the Tarikh-i-Benaketi in the British Museum leaves no doubt that Quatremere is right. The eighth book of this historical work comprises the history of Khata, in which Benaketi closely copies Rashid, without adopting his arrangement ; but as Benaketi occasionally gives some details not found in the defective manuscripts of the Djami ut Tevarikh now extant, we may conclude that he made use of a complete MS. of that work. The author renders the Chinese cheng siang, meaning prince or high minister.

But d'Ohsson does not always give a literal, coherent translation of the Persian historian, but rather works up Eashid's statements, together with those of other writers, in his elaborate history of the Chinghizkhanids. In 1836 the accomplished Trench orientalist Quatremdre began to publish in the " Collection Orientale " his " Histoire des Mongols de la Perse" translated from the Djami ut TevariMi ; but only the fifth part of this section (one volume) appeared. It terminates with the death of Hulagu. A complete Eussian translation of the Djami ut Tevarikh has been undertaken by a competent Eussian orientalist, Professor /. N. Berezin of St. Petersburg. He is pub
lishing the original Persian text and a Eussian translation in the " Memoirs of the Eussian Archseol. Society." The first volume, 392 pages, comprising Eashid's accounts of the various nations and tribes of Turkish and Mongol origin living in the eastern part of Asia, was issued in 1858 ; the second volume, containing the early history of the Mongols down to the time of Chinghiz Khan's accession to the throne, A.D. 1206, saw the light in 1868. It has 239 pages Persian text, 335 of translation and commentaries. As the author informs us, four volumes are to follow, of which one is now in the press. It seems to me that none of the previous translations of Eashid can enter into competition with that of Berezin. Not only has he at his disposal several of the best manuscripts of the Djami ut Tevarikh, but he is also considerably aided in the understanding of the Persian author's record by his acquaintance with Eastern Asiatic languages. Berezin states in the preface that Eashid's style is quite easy of understanding, and that the only difficulty the translator ^ meets is to get the correct reading and pronunciation of the foreign proper names occurring so frequently in the
Persian text, the diacritical points of the letters being often omitted in the manuscripts. Professor Berezin has also translated and very ably annotated the accounts given

In commenting upon geographical names in Central and Western Asia mentioned in ancient Chinese and Mongol writings, I have frequently to refer for corroboration or elucidation to the geographical accounts of those countries as given by the Mohammedan authors of the same period. We now possess many excellent European translations of the most important Arabic and Persian geographical accounts. I may mention the following Mohammedan geographers and historians repeatedly quoted in these pages. Mas'udi, the famous historian and geographer, who visited India, Ceylon, and the coast of China in a.d. 915. He died in 956. He is the author of the " Meadows of Gold," treating of history, geography, and other things.

S^prenger's " Post- u. Eeiserouten des Orientes," Abh. f. d. Kunde d. Morgenlandes, iii. 1864. Istakhri, who lived in the tenth century, is the author of a geographical work, "The Book of the Countries." Mordtmann translated an abridgment of it into German with the title " Das Buch der Lander," 1845. Iln Haukcd, who was Istakhri's contemporary, wrote in 977 a description of countries, which is nothing but a reproduction of Istakhri's book with additions by Ibn Haukal. The work Ouseley translated with the title " Oriental Geography of Ehn Haukal^' 1 800, is in reality a Persian version of Istakhri. Firdusi of Tus, the famous Persian poet, " the Homer

An indispensable book of reference with respect to
Asiatic history and geography, for students in this department w^ho have not access to the original sources, or who are not acquainted with Arabic and Persian, is d'lTerdelot's " BiUiotJieque Orientate, ou Dictionnaire Universel, contenant tout ce qui fait connaitre les Peuples de 1' Orient, leur Histoire," etc. The first edition was published in 1697 in Paris, the second in Maestricht in 1776. Klaproth calls d'Herbelot " le pere de nos connaissances sur I'Orient." The only reproach to which this eminent orientalist is open is that of merely giving, in his " Bibliotheque Orientale," translations from Mohammedan authors without venturing any critical remarks, or even taking exception to contradictions in the statements he brings forward. The second edition of the " Bibliotheque Orientale " (the edition



BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 20I
to wliicli I always refer) has a very valuable appendix:
Supplement a la BibliotMque Orientalc," par C. Visdelou et A. Galland. About 200 pages of this supplement are from the pen of Visdelou, and contain a great amount of interesting information, drawn from Chinese sources, with respect to the history and geography of Eastern and Central Asia. Claude Visdelou, born in 1656 in Bretagne, went as a missionary to China in 1685, and spent there twenty-four years. In 1709 he went to Pondicherry, where he died in 1737. I feel no hesitation in asserting that he was the most accomplished sinologue among the old Jesuit missionaries in China. All his translations show a profound and critical knowledge of the Chinese language. With respect to China, Visdelou takes the same place as Klaproth assigned to d'Herbelot with reference to Western Asia, and well deserves to be termed the father of our knowledge of Chinese historical records," especially the history of the nations of Central and Eastern Asia. In the first part of the supplement, Visdelou explains, from Chinese sources, a number of proper names and terms used by the Mohammedan authors with reference to China, viz., Fagfur, Tencu, Sin, Loukin, Klianhou, Namkink, KhatJiai, Khanhalig, Cara-CaJhaian, Van, Ca, Dacouk, DapikJien, Fenek^ Giagh or Tcliagh. (The latter seven terms refer to chronology and astronomy.)
The second part is entitled ''Histoire de la Tartarie,'' pp. 18-133, and gives the complete history of the nations and tribes of Mongolia and Central Asia, all the information being drawn from the histories of the Chinese dynasties. We find there the history of the Hiung-nu, the Wei, the Geou-gen, the Tou-kioue (Turks), the Hui-ho (Uigurs), the Sie-yen-to, the Kie-kia-sze (Kirghizes), and many others.
After this, forty-three pages are devoted to the histories of the K'i-tan (Liao) and the Kin (translations from the Liao shi and Kin shi). On pp. 11 7-1 19 we find an interesting dissertation on the invention of gunpowder by



202 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.
the Chinese, and the cannon they made use of in the Middle Ages. The accounts Visdelou gives of the Yuen or Mongol dynasty occupy only one page. The Manchus are treated of in six pages. The third part contains a dissertation on the term
The fourth part (thirty pages) has further explanations of names and countries, places and nations, of Central and Eastern Asia occurring in the writings of the Mohammedans, viz., Cara-JcJiotan, Khotan, Aigiir (Uigur), Botom, Turk,' Ung, Cathay, Tatar, Mogol and others. Finally, Visdelou gives a short account of the reigns of the first five Mongol emperors.
The fifth part, pp. 165-190, is a learned treatise on the famous Nestorian taUet at Si an fu.
I ought not to omit from my bibliographical notices an extensive work on the history of Asiatic nations, written
in the last century by a French orientalist of great repute.
It cannot be denied that J. Be, Gkdgnes in his " Histoire des Huns, Turcs, Mogols et autres Tartares occidentaux," published in Paris, 1756-58, in five volumes, has contributed a great amount of new information, drawn from Mohammedan, Chinese, and other sources ; but the competent reader will admit, I think, that the vast material brought together has been badly worked up by the author, who in his conclusions and identifications draws too much on his imagination, and seldom deems it necessary to give any
evidence for the correctness of his views. In many cases it is impossible to decide who is responsible for any given account or opinion, whether it is De Guignes or the ancient author he quotes. Thus his researches on Asiatic history have but little claim to be considered scientific investigations, It may be said that he has rather spread confusion than shed light. Even the title of his work implies
an error, for he identifies the Runs, who first appeared in history about A.D. 375, with the Hiung-nu, a people



BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 203
first mentioned in the Chinese annals in the third century B.C. as living in Mongolia, and who for nearly 400 years were constant disturbers of the Chinese frontier. In 216 A.D. the power of the Hiung nu was completely destroyed by the Chinese, and their names disappeared from Chinese
history. In his identification (i. 215), De Guignes, of course, was only guided by similarity of sounds. Klaproth has shown that De Guignes' view is opposed to all that we know re^ardinfr the Huns and the Hiuncj-nu. The same French orientalist has also broached the famous hypotheses, that the Chinese were an Egyptian colony, and that the Chinese discovered America in the fourth century.
After De Guignes, a more able and clear-sighted orientalist of the present century undertook to write a history of the Mongols. In 1825 the Baron C. d'Ohsson published his Histoire des Mongols depuis Tcliinguiz Khan jusqu'a Timour Bey ou Tamcrlan,'' in four volumes (other editions in 1834 and 1852). A map showing the political divisions of Asia in the thirteenth century is appended. In this elaborate work, which I quote frequently in these pages, the learned author has gathered all the documents bearing upon the history of the Mongols known at the time he wrote. D'Ohsson's information is drawn principally from the Mohammedan authors, of whose records he gives translations. D'Ohsson was himself of oriental origin (Armenian), and therefore well versed in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish. He was also well acquainted with many European languages. His "Histoire des Mongols" is written in an attractive style. It seems to me that d'Ohsson has exhausted the sources respecting the history of the Mongols, as far, at least, as information can be drawn from Mohammedan and other Western Asiatic and European mediaeval writers. It is only from the ancient records of the Chinese and Monfijols that some new licrht on this subject can be expected.

About ten years ago Mr. IT. H. Roworth published a bulky work in three volumes on the "History of the Mongols," which deserves to be noticed on the occasion, as being the first attempt to write a history of the Mongols in Enojlish. The author has brouc^ht tos^ether with much research and sagacious criticism all that had been previously written on the subject by European orientalists. Besides this, the same author published in the Journal of the Koyal Asiatic Society from 1875 to 1883 ^ series of papers witli the title " The Northern Frontagers of China^' in which he gives a summary of the histories of the Khitans or Liao, the Kin or Golden Tatars, the Hia or Tangut, and the Manchus.
I have also to quote repeatedly in these pages the narratives of those well - known European mediaeval travellers who visited Eastern Asia in the thirteenth century. As to Piano Car2oini and Eubruk^ my references are invariably to the pages of the (original) Latin editions in the "Eecueil de Voyages et de Memoires publie par la Societe de Geographic," tom. iv. 1839. John of Piano Carpini, despatched by Pope Innocent to Kuyuk Khan, set out from Lyons in April 1245 ; on the 4th April 1246 he reached the head-quarters of Batu on the Wolga ; on the 22d July he arrived at the camp of the Great Khan near Karakorum. He left Kuyuk Khan on the 13th November, and on the 9th May 1247 reached again the camp of Batu, and returned safely in the autumn
of 1247. Ruhniqiiis, or rather Eiibrouck, was sent by St. Louis on a mission to the Tartar chiefs. He entered the Black Sea on the 7th May 1253, and landed at the port of Soldaia, on the Crimean peninsula. On the ist of June he set out for his long journey, first visited Sartakh, who was beyond the river Tanais, and then Batu. whose camp was



BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 205
near the Volga. On the 14th September he left the court of Batu, and on the 27th December reached the court of Manf^u Khan near Karakorum, where he remained for more than six months. On the loth July 1254 he commenced his journey back, and on the i6th September arrived again at the court of Batu. Hence he proceeded along the western shore of the Caspian Sea to Derlend, traversed Great Armenia, went to Iconmm, Little Armenia, Cyprus, and finally reached, in September 1255, Accon (in Palestine), where he wrote the report of his journey. The third traveller in the thirteenth century through Central Asia, whose name frequently appears in these pages, is Marco Polo, the most valuable of all Western authorities with respect to the mediaeval geography of Asia. He was a young man when he accompanied his uncles, who were merchants, across the Asiatic continent to Khanbalik or Peking. They set out in 1271, travelled by way of Bagdad to Hormuz on the Persian Gulf, then turning northwards, traversed Kerman and Khorassan, Balkh and Badakhslian, and reached the Pamir steppe. This they crossed, and then continued by way of Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, by Lake Lobnor and Tangut, until they reached Kubilai's court in 1275. M. Polo remained seventeen years in China. He left it in 1292, and returned by sea, visiting many ports in the Indian seas. In 1295 he
reached Venice, his native place. My quotations from M. Polo's travels refer to the magnificent edition published by Colonel Yide, the " Book of Ser Marco Polo,'' in two volumes,
second edition, 1875. As to Odoric, Marignolli, and other mediaeval travellers to China in the fourteenth century, I rely upon Colonel Yule's '''Ccttliay and the Way Thither^' 1866.
Among the works to which reference will be made in this part of my researches, I may finally mention Karamzins "History of Russia,'' published 1815-29, in twelve volumes. This extensive work gives the original

text of all the ancient Russian annals in Slavonian. In vols. iii. and iv. the invasion of Russia by the Mongols is treated of, principally from Russian sources. I always quote the Russian original work, for the French translation of it by St. Thomas and Jauffret, 1820, shows many mistakes. Besides this, the translators omitted the citations of the annals.
In concluding these notices, it remains for me briefly to review a few modern Chinese geographical works and maps occasionally referred to in this volume, and upon which most of my identifications of ancient names of places in China proper, Mongolia, Manchuria, and Eastern Turkestan are based. The most important of these works is the Ta TsHng I t^ung chi, or great geography of the Chinese empire under the present (Ta Ts'ing) dynasty.^^^ It was first issued in 1743. The second much enlarged edition was published in 1764, in 500 chapters, and contains detailed descriptions of Eastern and Western Turkestan. At about the same time a special geographical description of Eastern and Western Turkestan, accompanied with maps, was compiled by order of Emperor KMen lung, and published in 1763 with the title Si yu chi. My friend Mr. C. Imbault-Huart has translated a part of it in his Becueils de Documents sur VAsie Centrale," 1881. The Sin k^iang chi Ho, or description of the new frontier, published in 1820, deals with the same subject as the Si yu t'u chi, but is an independent work, in which a OTeat deal of new matter is contained. The best modern Chinese map of the imperial dominions and the dependencies is the Ta Ts^ing I Vung yil Vu,
published in Wu chang fu in 1863.
As I have stated in note 521, there existed in the days of the Mongols
a Chinese description of the empire with the title Yuan I t'ung chi. A similar work, the Ming I t'ung chi, or Geography of the Ming empire, published in 1461, is stiJl extant.

A very useful book for reference is the geographical
dictionary Zi tai ti li clii yiin j^ici^ ^in sJii, in which ancient and modern names of places in China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia are arranged according to a system, under about 1600 characters. The identifications of ancient names of places in this work are quite reliable, for the author of it has drawn his information from the geographical sections of the Chinese dynastic histories, where the successive changes of the names are noticed. About twelve years ago a new edition of this dictionary with historical maps was published. U. Biot published iu 1842 a " Dictionnaire des ISToms anciens et modernes des Villes et Arrondissements de TEmpire chinois," but his book is too incomplete for exact and detailed researches.

ITOTICE OF THE K^I-TAN AND THE KAEAKHITAI.
The original seats of the KH-tan were in Southern Manchuria {Liao tung), where they are mentioned in the Chinese annals as early as the fourth century of our era. A. Eemusat ("Langues Tatares") and Klaproth ("Asia Polyglotta") hold them to have been Tunguses, and of the same stock as the Kin and the MancJms. As can be concluded from some K'i-tan words which have been preserved in ancient Chinese works, they were a mixed race, in which the Mongol and Tungus element predominated considerably. Very interesting accounts, not published before, of the K'i-tan and their early history are found in Professor WassiliefF's " Historical and Archaeological Eesearches with respect to the middle part of Eastern Asia " (Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia), from the tenth to the thirteenth
century, 1857 (in Eussian). These notices are principally drawn from the Ziao shi, or Chinese history of the Liao
(K'i-tan) dynasty, and the Ziao Jcito chi, or history of the
K'i-tan nation. The first section of the Liao shi (the annals) has been translated into German from the Manchu text by H. C. v. d. Gabelentz, and was published by his son in 1877. Compare also Professor W. Schott's " Kitai
and Karakitai," 1879 (Akad. d. Wiss., Berlin). In the beginning of the tenth century, the chief of the K'i-tan, named Ye lio ApaoJci, having subdued all the K*i-tan tribes, made himself master of a great part of Mongolia, and in 916 proclaimed himself emperor with the (Chinese) name T^ai tsu, 916-927. The son of this conqueror,



KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO). 209
T^ai tsting {Te huang), 927-947, conquered a part of ISrorthern China, and gave his dynasty the title of Liao. This K'i-tan or Liao empire subsisted for two centuries, 916-1125, in Northern China (only the northern part of
the provinces of Chili—including modern Peking— and Shansi), and the adjoining regions of Manchuria and Mongolia. It is well known that the name of Kathay, applied by the Mohammedan authors and by European mediaeval travellers to China, or rather Northern China, originated from the word K'i-tan. Even now-a-days the nations which know China from an inland point of view, as the Eussians, Persians, and the nations of Turkestan, style China Kitai, The Iv'i-tan or Liao empire was overthrown by the Kin (see note 574). Benaketi, or rather Eashid-eddin, whom he copies in
his description of Khatai,^^^ states : North of Khatai are the nomadic people which the Chinese call Kliidaii, the Mongols Kara kitai. The country where they live borders on the deserts of Mongolistan. In times past one of these nomades, called Kaoliclii Aia, conquered Khatai, assumed the title of king, and transmitted the throne to his descendants, who occupied it for a long space of time. Farther on Benaketi says that the name of Kaoliclii Aiaki was Liao, which means king. He conquered the world, and eight of his descendants reigned over his empire 219 years. According to d'Ohsson (i. 114), Eashid writes this name Bjulidji Apaki. A few years before the overthrow of the Liao dynasty, a prince of the imperial family of the Liao escaped westw^ards, gathered an army, and conquered Eastern and Western Turkestan ; Khovarezm became tributary to him. His empire became known as Ka7u Khitai in Western Asia, and subsisted for nearly a century. Its rulers caused much trouble in the Mohammedan countries in the twelfth century. It was destroyed by Chinghiz Khan,

who, having subdued the Tartar tribes in Mongolia, and made several irruptions into China and the Tangut empire, directed his armies towards the west; and there it was next the turn of the Kara Khitai empire, which then bordered upon the expanding empire of the conqueror, to experience the invincibleness of his arms. The name of Km^a Khitai was not invented in Western Asia; it seems to be of Mongol or Turkish origin; for Jcara means " black " in both languages, and Khitai, as I have stated, is intended for K'i-tan or Liao. The ancient Mongol annals style this people Karakitat, which is the plural form of Karakita. The reason why they were termed Black Khidans by the Mongols is unknown. As the founder of the Kara Khitai empire was a prince of the Liao, the Chinese annals call it Si Liao, Western Liao, the other name being unknown to the Chinese.^^^ Accounts of the Kara Khitai and their empire in Central Asia have come down to us from two different sources. The eastern (Chinese and Mongol) records on the subject are found in the Ziao shi, in the Chinese annals Kang mu, in the Titan cliao ^ji shi, and other Chinese mediaeval works. On the other side we possess notices of the same people by the Mohammedan historians in the Tarikh Djihan Kushai and the Djami ut Tevarikh. The Chinese records on the Si Liao (Western Liao) have been translated into French by Visdelou and Du Mailla. The first translated from the Liao shi, chap, xxx., end of the annals, reign of the last Liao emperor, T'ien tso (i 101-25), and his translation was published in the
" Suppl. a la Bibl. Orient.," p. 10 seqq. He gives a very correct and literal version of the Chinese text ; he has, however, occasionally omitted some particulars {e.g., proper names), considering them probably unimportant. Du Mailla translated from the Chinese annals Kang mu. See his "Histoire de la Chine," viii. p. 408-419. The com

pilers of the Kang mu seem to have, made use of information independent of the Liao history.^^^ I shall present here a new and complete translation of the article on the Si Liao in the Liao history. This
translation will be followed by others on the same subject, not published hitherto, and drawn from the histories of the Kin and Ylian and other Chinese or Mono-ol mediaeval
works. The Liao shi {I. c.) reads as follows :

Ye-lil Ta-sJii^^^ was the founder of the dynasty called Si Liao. He was a descendant in the eighth generation of T^ai tsu (or Apaoki, the first Liao emperor). The honorific title Chung tc (highly meritorious) had been bestowed upon him. He was well versed in the literature of the Liao, as well as in that of the Chinese ; and besides this he was a clever horseman and skilful archer. In 1 1 1 5 he received the degree of slii (doctor), and was admitted a member of the han lin (national academy) ; and as he was lin-ya^^^ in the academy, he was generally called Ta-shi lin-ya. Subsequently he wag appointed civil and military governor in the north-eastern provinces. In the year 1220, the Emperor T'ien tso, pressed hard by the Kin, had abandoned his throne and taken to roving about. Ye-lli Ta-shi then assembled the dignitaries of the empire, and placed on the throne Slmn, a prince of the imperial family. But Shun fell ill and died, and then his wife, Siao te, was entrusted with the regency and the defence of Yen (the present Peking, at that time the capital of the Liao empire). When the army of the Kin
arrived at Yen (in 11 20, according to the Liao annals), Siao te fled to the emperor T'ien tso,^*^ who grew very
538 There are some discrepancies in these two records with respect to the same events ; and for the dates the Kang mu is generally one or two years in advance. Ye-lu was the name of the reigning family of the K'i-tan or Liao. Lin-ya seems to be a term of the K'i-tan language. Visdelou translates it by "academicien," The Liao emperor was at that time in Tien te. See annals of the

angry, ordering her to be put to death, and reprimanded Ta-shi ^^'^ for having raised to the throne the prince Shun,
whilst the legitimate emperor was still alive. Ta-shi then answered : " Even at the time when the empire was still in full vigour, your majesty had not been able once to repulse the enemy, but had fled far away, abandoning the people in their calamities ; and had I then placed Shun on the throne, the reigning family would still have been descendants of our ancestor T'ai tsu. Has it not been the more dignified course now thus to act, instead of imploring the enemy for mercy ?
"
To this the emperor had nothing to reply. He entertained Ta-shi with a feast and pardoned him ; but Ta-shi did not feel himself in safety, and having killed Ki-sie
and Po-li-kuo,^^^ he declared himself sovereign. Then at the head of two hundred well-armed horsemen he departed by night (evidently from T'ien te) and proceeded northward. After a march of three days they crossed the E^ei sliui,^^^ where Ta-shi met with Chuang-gu-rh, the chief of the Fo Ta-ta,^^^ who offered him four hundred horses, twenty camels, and about a thousand sheep. Thence proceeding westward, he arrived at the city of ICo~hcn.^^^ In Fei fing tu hu fio''^'^ he rested for some time and assembled the

chiefs of the seven cliou (cities) ^'^^ and the eighteen pto
(tribes). The seven choii are enumerated as follows
:
Wei-iou (the Uigurs, Hid-fan. Tze-ho. see farther ou). Si7i. T'o. Ch'ung-te. Ta-lin.
The names of the eighteen tribes are also given
:
1. Ta huang Shi wei. 7. Ni-la. 13. Tsu-piL 2. Ti-la. 8. Ta-la-cKui. 14. Pa-su-wan. 3. Wang-gi-la. 9. Ta-mi-li. 15. Tang-gu. 4. Ch'a-chi-la. 10. Mi-rh-ki. 16. Hu-mu-sze. Test. II. Ho-chu. 17. Hi-ti. 6. Pi-ku-te. 12. Wu-kii-li. 18. Kiu-rh-jn.
Ta-shi spoke to the assembled chiefs as follows : " My ancestors had founded a vast empire, and had to endure many trials ; nine emperors have successively reigned over it for two hundred years. ISTow the Ki7i, who are subjects of our dynasty, massacre our people and destroy our cities. Our emperor, T'ien tso, has been constrained to liee shamefully and abandon the empire, being continually
in trouble. ISTow, relying on the justice of my cause, I have come to ask your assistance for the extermination of our common enemy and the re-establishment of our empire. I am sure you will feel compassion for our distress. Can you see without remorse the destruction of the temples of our tutelary genii ? No doubt you will
The Kang mu, in recording the same, says : " the seven chou at the western frontier." It seems that the tribes here mentioned occupied the western part and even the east of Mongolia. Shi ivei (i) is a name applied since the fourth century to a considerable tribe, divided into many branches, and occupying the land near Lake Baikal. See " History of the Northern Wei " and "History of the T'ang." The above name means Great yellow Shi wei. Ti-la (2) are perhaps the T'ie-le of the T'ang History, in which name the Telenguts of Rashid may be traced. The Wang-gi-la (3) are perhaps the Cuncrats ; CKa-cKi-la (4) the Djadjerats ; and Mi-rh-ki (10), the Merkits oi Rashid. By Tang-gu (15) it seems the Tanguts are meant. The same name appears in the geographical section of the Kin shi, province of Si king (see note 546). There we find also the name of a tribe Wu-ku-li (12).
We shall see farther on, from the accounts of the Kin shi, that Ta-shi's influence extended over the whole of Mongolia.

The assembled chiefs then raised an army numbering more than 10,000 horsemen, and Ta-shi appointed officers and furnished the troops with arms. In the following year (1121), in the second month, on the day Ma wu, Ta-shi, after sacrificing a black bull and a white horse to heaven, to earth, and to his ancestors, put his troops in order and set out for the west. He had previously sent to Pi-le-ho, king of the Rui-liu (Uigurs), a letter of the following tenor : " In times past, my ancestor, the Emperor T'ai tsu, who directed his army to the north, when passing through the city of Bu-guhanj"^^ sent an envoy to your ancestor, Wu-mu-chit, in Kan cliou,^''''^ with the following message : ' Do you still cherish the remembrance of your ancient country? I shall occupy it for you if you wish to return.' But your ancestor thanked the emperor, saying that his people had left their ancient abodes for more than ten generations, that all were quite happy in their present country,
and that there was no desire to return to their oricrinal patrimony. This proves that we have been for a long time on good terms with your people. It is now my intention to advance westward to the Ta-slii,^^^ and I ask permission to pass through your country. Do not entertain suspicion." Pi-le-ko having received this letter, immediately went to meet Ta-shi ; and on reaching his encampment, three days were spent in entertainment. When Ta-shi started again, the king presented him with 600 horses, 100 camels, and 3000 sheep ; and to prove his sincerity gave some of his sons and grandsons as
Bolcob Khan, a famous khan of the Uigurs, who had his residence near the place where afterwards Karakorum was built.

hostages ; and declaring himself a vassal of Ta-shi, accompanied the latter as far as the boundary of his realm. Thereupon Ta-shi, proceeding farther to the west, vanquished all enemies he met on his road, maintaining peace with those who surrendered voluntarily. Thus the army advanced 10,000 li, overthrowing kingdoms and taking innumerable camels, horses, cattle, sheep, and goods. The power of Ta-shi's arms increased from day to day,
and also the valour of the soldiers. When he arrived at Silns%-kan,^^'^ he met the united army of all the western kingdoms, numbering 100,000 men, and commanded by the Hurh-shan.^^^ The two armies were fronting^ one another at a distance of two li apart, when Ta-shi addressed his troops in the following terms : " We see before us a numerous host, but it wants an able commander. When they are attacked in front, the rear will fail to come to the rescue, and there can be no doubt our army will gain the victory."
After this he formed his troops in three divisions, order
ing the princes Siao Wa-li-la, Ye-lil Sung slum, and others, at the head of 2500 men, to attack the right flank of the enemy, whilst the princes Siao La-a-hu and Ye-lil Mu-sie received orders to lead 2500 men against the left flank, and Ta-shi himself with the main body of the army, assaulted the centre. These three divisions rushed at the same time upon the Hu-rli-slian, whose army was completely defeated, and to an extent of ten li the ground was covered with dead bodies. Ta-shi with his army rested in Siin-sz'-kan ninety days. The king of the Hui hid (Mohammedans) came to offer his submission and brought products of his country as tribute. After this
Samarkand. See note 195. Hu-rh-shan has some resemblance in sound with Khorazm Shah. Kutb-eddin Mohammed, 1097-1127, first assumed the title of Khorazm Shah. He was a vassal of the Seldjuks, who at that time reigned in Transoxiana and Ferghana. The Mohammedan historians, however, do not record a battle at Samarkand between the Kara Khitai and Khovarezm Shah or the Seldjuks ; but they mention about fifteen years later a great defeat of the Seldjuk Sultan Sangiar of Khorasan by the Gurkhan of Kara Khitai. See note 587.



2l6 KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO).
Ta-shi proceeded to the west as far as Ki-rh-man.^^^ There all his ofi&cers, civil and military, assembled and proclaimed Ta-shi emperor. This happened on the fifth day of the second month of 1124 (according to the Kang mu, 1 125). The emperor, who was then thirty-eight years old, assumed at the same time the title of Go-rh-han,^^^ and the Chinese title T^ien yu Huang ti, the years of his reign being named Yen Icing. Ta-shi bestowed also honorary titles upon his ancestors and his wife. After this he assembled the officers and spoke to them as follows : " We have made together a journey of 40,000 li
;
we have crossed deserts and suffered many hardships by night and by day. That you may share in my glory, J am about to grant honorary titles to your ancestors." He then conferred posthumous titles upon the ancestors of the prince Siao Wa-li-la and on those of forty-nine other distinguished ofiScers. In the year 1126 Ta-shi conducted his army back to the east. After a journey of twenty days on horseback they reached a fertile land, where a capital was founded and named Hu-sz' wa-rh-do.^^'^ The name of the reign was then changed to K^ang kiio.^^^ In the same year Siao Wa-li-la was appointed commander-in-chief (I omit the other appointments mentioned in the Chinese text). An army of 70,000 horsemen was raised for an expedition to the east. After sacrificing to heaven a black bull and a white horse, Ta-shi ordered a banner to be set np, around which he assembled his troops, haranguing them in the following ' terms : " Our

Hu-sz' has some resemblance to hosun, meaning " strength " in Manchu. For further particulars regarding the capital of the Kara Khitai, see note 583. The two characters mean "kingdom of peace." This was also an ancient Chinese name for Samarkand.

great Ziao dynasty rose under difficult circumstances, and it was due to the merits of my ancestors (the great work) was accomplished. But their successors w^ere addicted to pleasure and debauchery, and neglected the government of their people ; when riots broke out and our empire was destroyed. Now I w^ish to conduct you back to the So mo (Mongolian desert) and to re-establish our ancient splendour. This is no country for me and my people to dwell in." Thereupon Ta-shi enjoined the commanderin-chief, Siao Wa-li-La, to move out, giving him the following instructions : " March out now ; take care to reward merit and punish those who do not perform their duties. Try to share conscientiously with your troops fortune and misfortune ; choose places rich in grass and water for encamping ; before giving battle, take care duly to estimate the strength of the enemy. Be ever cautious not to draw down upon yourself a defeat." Thereupon the army moved out and made a march of more than 10,000 li without meeting with any success. They lost a great number of horses and cattle, and were constrained to return, the troops being exhausted. Ta-shi then said, " Heaven is not propitious towards me." He died in the tenth year of hco, or A.D. 1135 (according to the Kang mu in 11 36), having reigned twenty years.^^^ He was canonised Te tsung.
When Ta-shi died, his son Ti-lie was not of full age, and his widow, by name T^a-bu-yen, called also Kan t'ien huang hoio, was entrusted with the regency. The name of her reign was Hien tsing. Seven years later Yi-lie himself took charge of the government ; and the name of his reign was Sliao King, which lasted thirteen years, 1 142II 55. He ordered a census of the people over eighteen years old, when it w^as found that there were 84,500
families in all. After death he was canonised as Jm tsung. His son being still a minor, P'u-su-wan, the younger

sister of the late emperor, undertook the regency, and reigned fourteen years, 115 5—69. The name of her reign was CJiung fic, and her title was CJi eng {ien £ ai hou. She had married Siao To-lu-hio, the son of (the above mentioned) Siao Wa-li-la, but held illicit intercourse with her husband's younger brother, P\c-gu-djisha-li. She conferred upon her husband the title of Tu7ig ping luang, but subsequently gave orders to kill him. Siao Wa-li-la, however, surrounded the palace with troops, and the empress was killed, together with her lover, by arrow-shots. Dji-hc-gic, the second son of Jen tsung, was next proclaimed emperor. His reign was named T'ien hi, which lasted thirty-four years, 1 169—1203. It happened in autumn of 1203, when the emperor was on a hunting excursion, he was made prisoner by K' il-cli lo-lil, prince of the Nai man,^^^ who had been lying in ambush with 8000 men. The latter then took possession of Dji-lugu's throne, adopting the dress and the customs of the Liao. But he left to the late emperor the title of T'ai sJiang huang, and to the empress the title Huang t'ai hou. As long as they were alive, K'u-ch'u-lti visited them twice a day. Some time after Dji-lu-gu died, and with him the Liao dynasty became extinct.
Besides the above Chinese record regarding the Si Liao or Kara Khitai, many other fragmentary notices on
the same subject may be found in Chinese literature, especially of the Kin and Mongol periods. I may quote some of them in order to complete my accounts from
Chinese sources. The Si Liao and Ta-shi's exploits are spoken of with

The Kang mu places the date of Guchluk's taking possession of the throne of the Si Liao at 1 20 1, eighth month ; but the Yiian shi states that he fled to the K'i-tan only in 1208, which latter date is in accordance with the statements of the Mohammedan authors.



KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO). 219
some detail in the Pei shi ki, or the narrative of an envoy despatched by the Kin emperor to Chinghiz in 1220. A translation of it is found in the first part of this book. From the particulars the Kin envoy gives with respect to
the peregrinations of Ta-shi, it appears that his way from Mongolia to Transoxiana led through the Talki defile, north of the present Kuldja. The diarist of Cliang
ch'un's travels to the west, as well as the traveller Cli ang
Te, and Ye-lll Cliu ts'ai in his narrative, all when passing through Turkestan mention the traces of the K'i-tan empire, as do also the European mediseval travellers Carpini and Eubruck. Interesting notices throwing some new light on the Kara Khitai are found in the history of the Kin dynasty in one of
the biographies, which I shall translate presently. The Kin (see note 5 74), after destroying the empire of the Liao or
K'i-tan in Eastern Asia in 1 125, and establishing their dynasty in Northern China, extending their power also over a great part of Mongolia, being apparently very uneasy about the foundation of a powerful Liao empire in Turkestan, did not let an opportunity slip of gathering information regarding it, and even sent envoys to them. The following account is translated from the biography of Nien-'ko Han-nu, Kin shi, chap, cxxi., where some particulars of the intercourse between the Kin and the Kara Khitai in the twelfth century are recorded. Nien-ko Han-mo was a meritorious officer in the army of the Kin, in the first half of the twelfth century. The emperor had granted him, as a mark of distinction, a harness, a bow and arrows, and a war-horse. After these statements the biographer gives a long notice of the Si Liao and Han
nu's mission to their court. This account reads as follows:

At the time T' ai tsu passed through Ku yung^^^
The first Kin emperor, Aguta, 1 115-23. 562 rpj^jg g^iii name of a defile and a fortress in it, north-west of Peking. The defile is more generally known to European residents at Peking under the name of the Nan hou pass.



220 KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO).
Ye-lu Ta-shi, a prince of the Liao, withdrew through the defile of Ku pei Jcoio.^^^ (The capture of Yen, or Peking, by the Kin is recorded in the Liao shi under the year 1 120.) But he appeared again, took Feng sheng chou^^^ and intrenched his troops twenty-five li east of Lung menf^^ This intrenchment was taken by Loii shi (a general of the Kin), and Ta-shi with his troops surrendered. Tsung wang (also a general of the Kin) captured the heavy baggage of the Liao emperor near the place called Tsing cJmngf'^^ and on this occasion Ta-shi served as guide. The (Kin) emperor pardoned all the princes and soldiers who had been made prisoners, and ordered a communication to be made to Ta-shi that, notwithstanding his having been taken in arms, the emperor acknowledged his merits, especially on account of the service he had rendered in guiding the (Kin) troops. This happened in 1 1 2 i ; but subsequently Ta-shi
fled, it was unknown in what direction.^^^ In the year 1124 a report was received from the chief of some tribes (in Mongolia) who had surrendered to the Kin, stating that Ta-shi had been proclaimed king
in the northern regions ; that his realm consisted of two provinces, a northern and a southern ; that he possessed 10,000 cavalry horses, numerous herds and great riches in products. The emperor gave orders to continue the pursuit of the Liao prince, and not to neglect at the same time to procure authentic information about Ta-shi.

There are several defiles of this name (Dragon-gate) in the mountains north and west of Peking. 566 rpj^jg happened in ii 21, according to the annals of the Liao shi. With respect to Ta-shi's relations with the Kin, the historians of the Liao and the Kin are in contradiction ; or at least the Liao shi does not say that Ta-shi had been made prisoner by the Kin, but only states that he repaired to the Liao emperor after the fall of Peking. The Kang mu records that Ye-lu Ta-shi, having been made prisoner by the Kin, near the defile of Kii yung, was released and sent by the Kin emperor to find the Liao emperor, who was wandering about in Southern Mongolia.



KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO). 221
In the next year, 1125, one of the governors at the frontier reported a rumour that the Hia (Tangut empire) was in colhision with Ta-shi and plotting an invasion of the province of Shan si. The emperor again gave orders to inquire into the matter and at the same time to arm for . war. In 1 129 a report came to hand from a general commanding in T'ai cliou (in Eastern Mongolia), in which he notified that Ta-shi had already succeeded in taking the two military encampments situated in the regions of the northern tribes. He expressed his apprehensions with respect to the security of the imperial pasture lands which were situated not far from the above-mentioned places. The emperor was at first afraid that the tribes in the north
might revolt if troops should be collected in those regions. However, in 11 30, Ye-lil Yil-ta^^^ and two other commanders were sent to pursue Ta-shi. They had been ordered also to raise troops from the tribes (in the north), but these tribes refused to obey. This expedition proceeded as far as the river Wu-na and then returned. Yii-ta made a report that Ta-shi was said to sojourn in the country of Huo cJiou,^^^ and to be in collusion with the Ria (Tanguts).^^^ Thereupon the emperor sent an envoy to the Hia to demand an explanation ; but they replied that
56S ^ prince of the Liao, who had deserted and entered the army of the Kin. Huo chou is the same as Kardkhodjo, near Turfan. The Kangmu, in recording (s. a. I131) the expedition of Ye-lli Yii-ta, states that he started with 10,000 men to look for Ta-shi, who was said to approach Huo chou. As the Kin did not put absolute trust in this general, his family were retained as hostages. He advanced as far as the city of Ho tung, north of the desert, more than 3000 li distant from Yiin chung (the present Ta t'ung fu, in Northern Shan si). But this expedition missed its aim, and only devastated the provinces of Yen (Northern Chili), Ylin chung, and Ho tung, which had to furnish the troops with provisions. The rumour spread about the approach of Ta-shi towards Huo chou in 1 1 30, as reported in the Kin shi and the Kang mu, seems to have been in connection with the great but unsuccessful expedition sent by Ta-shi to the east about the same time. See above my translation of the account from the Liao shi.



222 KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO).
they had heard nothing of Ta-shi, and that their country was not contiguous to Huo chou. (In the Kin shi, annals, s. ^.''1130, we read that the Hui-hu (Uigurs) of Huo chou, having captured Sa-ha-tifu-tie, a partisan of Ye-lti Ta-shi, delivered him over to the Kin.) In the year 1 144, envoys from the Hui-hu (Uigurs) came
to the court of the Kin to offer tribute, and they stated that Ta-shi was not then alive, but that his people dwelt in their {i.e., the Hui-hu's) vicinity. Then Han-nu (in whose biography all these accounts are recorded) received orders to accompany the envoys of the Hui-hu to their country. He departed, and afterwards nothing more was heard of him. Under the reign of Ta ting, 1160-90, a merchant of the Hui-hu, by name I-si-lan, arrived with three companions at the south-western frontier (of the Kin empire). These merchants gave the following statements: "Our native country is called Dsou-gua (the biographer adds that this is the name of a foreign tribe). The name of
the capital is Gu-sz-o-lu-do.^'^'^ The people of this country
are not of a warlike character, but are engaged in agriculture, and every year pay one-tenth of their produce to the government. Old men say that in times past, when the K'i-tan arrived, the people of Dsou-gua surrendered without offering any resistance. The encampment in which the ICi-tan live is so large that it takes half a day to ride
round it.^^^ A short time ago the ruler of the K'i-tan had sent A-lcn-sze, his son-in-law, with 10,000 men to subdue the Ye-bu-lien and other tribes, but his expedition was not successful. The war, however, is not yet finished." The emperor ordered these Hui-hu to be settled near Hienping fu (now T'ie ling hien in Southern Manchuria), where settlements of the Hui-hu had existed from
olden times.
^1 Evidently the same as Hu-sz'-wa-rh-do. See note 557. 5''2 Compare, farther on, the statements of E-ubruck about the remains of the encampment of the Kara Khitai.



KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO). 223
In the same year, Sa-li-ya, chief of the Nien-la-cn, and
Bo-gu, chief of the K' ang li,^''^ and other tribes, sent envoys and begged to be admitted as vassals of the Kin emperor. They offered the seal given to them by Ta-shi and solicited a new seal from the Kin. The emperor 2[ave orders to instruct the (governor at the south-western
frontier to send officers to those countries to inquire into
the sincerity of the tribes ; whereupon an envoy was de
spatched together with an interpreter. They saw Sa-li-ya, who maintained his sincerity, and from him they heard also of the fate of Han-nu. Sa-li-ya told them that many years ago the Kin emperor had sent an envoy, named Han-nu, by way of Huo-chou (Karakhodjo) to the dominions of Ta-shi. He had met the latter when he was on a hunting excursion, and had been asked by him why he did not get down from his horse. Han-nu had replied that he was the envoy of the Kin emperor, and that it was the place of Ta-shi to dismount in order to listen to the imperial message; upon which Ta-shi had ordered Han-nu to be put to death. Such was the information the envoy brought back to China. I may finally quote a passage from the history of the
Sung dynasty referring to the Kara Khitai. It is stated
there, s. a. 1 1 8 5 : " In the second month of this year information was received from spies that Ta-shi ling-ya, the chief of the K\-tan dynasty, had sent to the emperor of the Hia, asking permission to pass through his dominions in order to invade the Kin empire."
Let us turn now to the records of the Mohammedan historians regarding the Western Liao or Kara Khitai. See d'Ohsson, i. 441-443. Eashid-eddin has gathered the following information with respect to this dynasty :

^''^ The Kankly of the Mohammedan authors, of which I shall speak more fully farther on.

After the sovereign of the Churclie^'^'^ had destroyed the empire of the Kara Khitai,^^^ a prince of the latter, by name Nushi Taifu^'^^ standing in high esteem in his
^4 The Churche of the Mohammedan authors are the same as the Nii-chi of the Chinese historians. The original spelling of the name by the Chinese was Ju chen (Klaproth's " Asia Polyglotta ; " Plath's " Mandschurey," i. 107 ; Wassilyefi's " Hist. East. Asia," p. 41). They originally dwelt near the river Amur and were tributary to the K'i-tan. In the beginning of the twelfth century the Nii-chi revolted. The leader of this revolt is called A-gu-da in the Chinese annals. He won several victories over the K'i-tans, and in 11 15 adopted the title of emperor, and gave his dynasty the Chinese name Kin (gold). His successor, U-Jci-mai, accomplished the destruction of the K'i-tan empire in Manchuria, Mongolia, and Northern China in 1 125, and succeeded also in conquering from the Sung (Chinese empire) all the provinces of Northern China. The boundary of the Kin empire to the south then was the Huai river. The Kin dynasty reigned in Manchuria, Mongolia, and Northern China more than a century. The Kin were overthrown by the Mongols in 1234. It is known that the Niichi or Kin were the ancestors of the present Manchus. Their history is given in the Kin shi or Chinese history of the Kin. The Persian chroniclers heard the name Churche probably from the Mongols, and this seems to have been the proper name of this nation. In the 2'a Kin Jcuo chi or (Chinese) history of the great Kin nation, we find a statement that the Niichi or Kin were properly called Chu-li-djen. M. Polo states (i. 227) that the Tartars originally dwelt in the north, on the borders of Chorcha. On page 335 he speaks again of the province of Chorcha, and no doubt means Manchuria. In Benaketi's " Tarikh-i-Khata," which, as I have stated in note 532, is rather a plagiarism from Rashid's account, we find the following notices
of the Churche (Miiller Greiffenhag, " Abd. Beidav. Hist. Sin.,"jp. 15) : " Contiguous to the Kidan or KaraKhitai there is another nation engaged in agriculture. The Kathayans call it Niu che, the Mongols and other people Churche. Among these people there was a man called Huonyen Agudai, whose cognomen was Daigim. The Mongols call him ATcuda. He overthrew the dynasty of Kara Khitai in Khatai. The Altun Khan (golden khan) who lived at the time of Chinghiz, and the one who was destroyed under the reign of Ogotai Khan, both were called Daigim.''' Huonyen is the Niichi word for prince. Wan-yen, in constant use through the Kin history. Daigim is the Chinese T'ai Kin or Great Kin. Eashid terms the (original) Liao dynasty in Eastern Asia also Kara Khitai. D'Ohsson states (i. 163) that Rashid terms the founder of the Kara Khitai dynasty Tushi Taifu. Thus Nushi here must be a misprint in d'Ohsson's translation or a clerical error in the Persian MS. Tushi seems to be the correct reading, for it is nearer to Ta-shi, which, as we have seen, was the name of the foimder of the Western Liao dynasty, according to the
Liao shi. D Ohsson explains—I am not aware on what authority—that

own country, fled first to the country of the Kirghizes, then passed to the Uigurs, and finally arrived in Turkestan. Being a man of high intelligence and capacity, he suc
ceeded in rallying a considerable force in these countries and conquered the whole of Turkestan,^" whereupon he took tlie title of Gurhkan,^^'^ meaniog " Great Khan." These events took place in 1 128 and 1 129.^'^^
After ISTushi Taifu's death, his son, who was then only seven years old, was proclaimed gurkhan. He lived to the age of ninety-five, and died about 1 2 1 3 . When Chinghiz was born, the gurkhan was forty-four years old, and had already reigned twenty-five years.^^^ The author of the " Tarikh Djihan Kushai " gives more detailed accounts of the Kara Khitai. He records as follows :

The khans of Kara Khitai derive their origin from Kliitai. The founder of this empire had a great reputation among his own people, but had been constrained by political events to leave his native country. He took the title of Gurkhan, meaning " Universal Khan." It is reported that, when he left Khitai, he was accompanied
by only sixty foUowers,^^^ but some assert that he was at the head of a numerous army. These emigrants, first reached the frontier of the Kirghizes, making incursions
Tai fu in Chinese means " general en chef." This view is not correct. T'ai fu, literally " great man," now-a-days means a physician, but only in the popular language. Ta fu, which likewise has the meaning of "great man," is an old term which was applied to civil officers. ^'"^ In the article on the Kerait tribe E-ashid states (Berezin, i. 98) that the gurkhans of Kara Khitai reigned over Maverannahar and Turkestan. See note 556. ^"^^ Tour or five years earlier (1124), according to the Liao shi. According to the Liao shi, Ta-shi was succeeded in turn by his son and grandson. The latter was on the throne thirteen years, 1169-1203. Thus Rashid has omitted one of the gurkhans ; but he may be more correct than the Liao shi in stating that the last gurkhan of the Kara Khitai died about 1 213. The Liao shi puts this event earlier. As to the dates referring to the history of the Kara Khitai given in the Ytian shi, the latter is in accordance with Rashid. See note 560. Two hundred, according to the Liao shi.

upon their territories ; but when the latter had taken measures to repulse the aggressors, the Kara Khitai withdrew to the country of the river Imil, where they founded a city, of which the ruins are still to be seen.^^^ The tribes of the Turks submitted to the Khitan prince, who, after a short time, found himself at the head of 40,000 families. He then proceeded to Belasagun, a city which is now called Gu-lalik by the Mongols.^^^ The
See note 313. ^^'^ According to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai (d'Ohsson, i, 433), the city of Belasagun had been founded by Buku Khan, sovereign of the Uigurs, in a well-watered plain of Turkestan with rich pastures. The Arabian geographers first mention Belasagun in the ninth or tenth century as a city beyond the Sihun or Yaxartes, depending on Isfidjab (Sairam, according to Lerch), and situated east of Taras (see notes 23 and 585). They state that the people of Turkestan considered Belasagun to represent "the navel of the earth," on account of its being situated in the middle between east and west, and likewise between north and south (Sprenger's " Poststr. d. Or., Mavarannahar "). Abulfeda, II. ii, 127, quotes, with respect to Belasagun, two authors of the tenth and twelfth centuries, according to whom it lay not far from Kashgar. We know from the record of the Arabian historiographer Ibn el Athir, who wrote at the close of the twelfth century, that Belasagun in the tenth and eleventh centuries was the capital of the khans of Turkestan. As we shall see farther on (see the article on the Uigurs), there is som.e reason to believe that this dynasty, known also under the name of the lick Jchans, was an Uigur dynasty, and that the khan of Belasagun, dethroned by the gurkhan of Kara Khitai, was an Uigur prince. The Mohaminedan chroniclers who notice Belasagun as the capital of Kara Khitai in the twelfth and in the beginning of the thirteenth century furnish only vague indications regarding its geographical position. But we find several notices in the Mongol and Chinese annals of that period which enable us to determine more precisely the proper position of the capital of Kara Khitai. We have seen that, according to the Liao history, the founder of the Western Liao dynasty, or Kara Khitai, had established his residence twenty days' journey east of Kermane (the latter place being situated between Samarkand and Bokhara). This residence is named there Hu-sze-wa-rh-do. It appears further, from the reports above quoted of some Mohammedans v/ho came to China from the country where the Western Liao then reigned, that the encampment of the latter was in the vicinity of a city, Gu-sze-o-lu-do. This latter name and Bu-sze-ioa-rh-do are evidently the same. Ye-lil-CKu tsai (see the first narrative in Part I.) states that Hu-sze-wo-lu-do, the capital of the Si Liao, was situated west of the river Hie (Hi). In the Yiian shi, chap, cxx., in the biography of Eo-sze-mai-li, it is stated that he was a man from the Si yii (Turkestan),

sovereign of this country was descended from Efrassiydb (a mj^thical king of the Turks spoken of in the ancient Persian chronicles), had lost his power, and had ceased to reign over the tribes of the Karliihs and Kanhalis, who even made incursions upon his territories. When the Kara Khitai approached his country, the sovereign sent envoys to their chief and invited him to take possession
a native of the city of Gu-dse-iva-rh-do, and a confidant of the K'uo-rh-han (gurkhan) of the Si Liao. I have little doubt that these names, applied by the Chinese authors to the capital of the Kara Khitai, are identical with Belasagun, which, according to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, was called Gu halik in the days of the Mongols. In the Yuan ch'ao pi shi we find a more precise indication of the position of this place. It is stated there that Ung Khan had fled (close of the twelfth centui-y) to the gurkhan of the K'i-tan, who lived on the river Ch'ui (see Palladius' transl., p. 72 ; d'Ohsson, i. 53). This river of Russian Turkestan. Chic, or Choo of our maps, is still styled CKui on modern Chinese maps (see note 250). It is mentioned in Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary. The valley of the Chu river is famed for its pastures (Kostenko's "Turkestan," i. 268). This fact agrees well with the statement of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai that Belasagun had been founded in a well-watered plain with rich pastures. I am inclined to suppose that the name of Belasagun, or Balasgun as it is sometimes spelt, is a corruption of halgassun, which in Mongol means city. It is not unlikely that the same word was used also by the Turkish tribes. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai states that the Mongols designate Belasagun by the name of Gu-haliJc. It seems to me that this latter name bears some resemblance to Gu-dse-ioa-rh-do, for balik and ordo (city and residence) have nearly the same meaning. It is not improbable that ancient Belasagun was situated at the same place where, according to the T'ang history, the khan of one branch of the Western T'u klie (Turks) had his residence in the seventh century. It is stated in the T'ang shu that Ihi Shaholo Shehu Khan, who reigned in the first half of the seventh century, placed his ordo on the northern border of the river Sui ye. This river and a city of the same name are frequently mentioned in the T'ang annals of the seventh and eighth centuries, in connection with the warlike expeditions of the Chinese in Central Asia. Sui ye was situated on the way from the river Hi to the city of Ta-lo-sz' (Talas). In 679 the Chinese had built on the Sui ye river a fortress ; but in 748 they were constrained to destroy it, (Comp. Visdelou in " Suppl. Bibl. Orient.," pp. 110-114; Gaubil's "Hist, de la Dyn. des Thang " in "Mem. cone. Chin.," xv. p. 403 segq.). In A.D. 629 and 630 the Buddhist monk Hilan Thsang proceeded from China to Samarkand by a route south of the Celestial Mountains, crossed this range in the Ling shan (ice mountain) or Musart defile, and arrived at the Tsing cKi (limpid lake). The description he gives of this lake leaves no doubt that he passed by the lake Issikul. Five hundred li north-west

of his realm.^^* The Khitan prince then arrived at Belasagun, and the descendant of Efrassiyab abdicated, merely retaining the title Ilk-Turhan, or chief of the Turks. After this the gurkhan of Kara Khitai appointed governors in all the provinces of his empire, from Kiom-kidjih to Barserdjan^ and from Taras to Tamidj.^^^
of this lake he reached the city on the river Su ye, which was about six or seven li in circuit, and where the merchants from the surrounding countries congregate. Here was also the residence of She hu, the khan of the Turks (Stan. Julien, " Mem. .s. 1. Contrees Occid.," and " Vie de Hiouen Thsang "). The Su ye of the Buddhist monk and the Sui ye of the T'ang history are the same, and only the Chui or Chu river can be meant. ^^^ Compare the report of the Mohammedan merchants found in the Kin shi and above translated, that Gu-sze-o-lu-do had surrendered to Ta-shi without offering resistance. With the exception of Taras, the places or countries here noticed are unknown to me. Concerning the latter place, I beg to refer to note 23, in which I tried to determine the position of ancient Taras from the fragmentary statements on it left by the Mohammedan authors. There can be no doubt that this city was situated on the river which still bears the name of Tolas, and probably not far from the -present Aulie-ata, on the great highway leading from the Hi river to Samarkand. The Buddhist monk Hiian Thsang, quoted in note 583, who proceeded by this way in A.D. 630, after leaving Su ye (the Chu river) came 400 li west to a well-watered country, which he calls Tsien ts'iian, or "thousand springs," and which on the south is bordered by snowy mountains, and on the other sides is level tableland. Going from the Thousand Springs westward 140 or 150 li, he came to the town of Ta-lo-sz', which was eight or nine li in circuit, where merchants from all parts assembled and lived here with the natives. Vivien de St. Martin, in his geographical notes appended to Stan. Julien's translation of Hiian Thsang's narrative, identifies Tsien tsuan with a place, 3Iing hulak^ south of Lake Karakul, thus carrying the traveller far north-west, and then locates his Ta-lo-sz between the aforesaid lake and the laxartes. But this view is untenable. Ming bulak, meaning " Thousand Springs " in Mongol and other languages of the East, is a quite frequent name for places in Mongolia and Central Asia. It seems to me that the Thousand Springs of the Chinese traveller, bordered on the south by snowy mountains, whilst on the other sides all was level land, must be rather looked for somewhere on the northern slope of the high mountain range stretching from Lake Issikul westward, and marked on Russian maps as Alexander s chain. Many rivers and torrents, tributaries of the Chu, run down from these mountains, which are very rich in watercourses. The great highway from Kuldja to Tashkand or to Samarkand crosses all these rivers, and also the Talas at Aulie-ata. I have, therefore, no doubt that Hliang Thsang's way from the riVer Chu to Che shi (Tashkand) followed the same direct route along the northern slope



KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO). 229
Subsequently he subdued the Kanhalis!"^^ His troops conquered Kashgar and EJwtan ; he sent also an expedition against the Kirghizes. Bislibalik was taken, and Fergana and Transoxiana^^'^ submitted. Thus the predecessors of Osman (of Samarkand) became the vassals of the gurkhan. Having accomplished these conquests, he sent his general, Ernuz, against Khovarezrn, who carried fire and slaughter through that country. Atsiz EJwrasm Shah offered his submission and paid a large tribute, when Ernuz withdrew. Some time after the gurkhan died, and his widow, Keuyunlv, occupied the throne. She was subsequently convicted of an illicit intercourse, and killed together with her lover.^^^ One of the two brothers of the deceased gurkhan was then placed on the throne.^^^ The Sultan Tahash, successor of Atsiz, continued to pay tribute to the gurkhan of Kara Khitai, and was on good terms with him. He also recommended his son and successor to follow the same policy in regard to the gurkhan, whose empire was a strong barrier to protect Khorasm from the dreaded
people of the east.
of the Alexander's chain, and that his Ta-lo-sz' or Talas was near the present Aulie-ata. The city of Ta-lo-sz' is also frequently mentioned in the T'ang annals of the seventh and eighth centuries, generally together with Sui ye and Tsien tsiian. It is stated there that the kingdom of Shi (Tashkand) used to keep a garrison at Ta-lo-sz'. We have seen that most of the Chinese medieval travellers who in the thirteenth century went through Central Asia to Samarkand notice a river or a city of Ta-lo-sz' on their road. Compare the Chinese record above, that the X'ang-li offered the seal of the Kara Khitai to the Kin emperor. 587 WT-g read in the "Bibl. Orient," that the Seldjuk sultan Sandjar (who reigned over Khorassan and Transoxiana) conducted his host against the Gurgiah (gurkhan) of Kara Khitai (in 1141, according to De Guignes) ; but he was defeated, and the Kara Khitai captured his harem. Sandjar fled to Termed. See also Weil, "Khalifen," iii. 276, 588 Evidently P'M-m-z(jan., the younger sister of the successor of Ta-shi, is meant. She was, in fact, killed together with her lover. See the Chinese records above. 589 ^ grandson of Ta-shi was placed on the throne, according to the Chinese annals.



230 KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO).
The Mohammedan authors do not record the names of the gurkhans of Kara Khitai, as the Liao shi does, but they give detailed accounts of the reign of the last gurkhan of this dynasty, who was dethroned by the ISTaiman prince Giichluh The following are the chief points of the Mohammedan records on this subject,
translated by d'Ohsson, i. 105, 166, seqq.
:

Guchluh, when his father, Taiyang, khan of the Naimans, had been slain, and the power of this tribe had been broken by Chinghiz, made a league with Tukta, khan of the Mcrkits, A.D. 1208. Chinghiz' army attacked
Guchluk and Tukta, who had rallied their active forces on the river Irtysh, and defeated them near the river
JDjem!"^^ Tukta was slain, but Guchluk escaped, and
fled, at first to BisKbalih, then to Kudja, and finally arrived in 1208 in the dominions of the gurkhan of Kara Khitai,^^-^ where he found shelter and was well received at the court; the gurkhan even gave him his daughter in marriage. But some time after, Guchluk formed a plot to dethrone his benefactor. Having obtained the permission of the gurkhan to receive in his empire the remnants of the ISTaiman tribe, who were scattered over
the countries of Bishbalik, Imil, and Kayalik, Guchluk
In the Ylian shi, annals, s. a. 1208, the same events are recorded ; but the river where the battle took place is not mentioned. The war between the Mongols and Guchluk and Tukta is also spoken of in chapter cxxii, , biography of Ba-rh-dju d-rh-te-te-gin, king of the Uigurs. There the river, where Guchluk and Tukta were defeated, is termed CKan. In the biography of Su-bu-t'ai (ibidem, chapter cxx.), the same river is called CKen or Shen. In the Ts'in cheng lu, the same name reads Tsien. Probably one of the affluents of the Upper Irtysh in the Mongol period had a similar name. Regarding JBishhaliJc, see note 157. It was the capital of the Uigurs. D'Ohsson identifies Kudja with Kucha in Eastern Turkestan. . The Yiian ch'ao pi shi (Pallad. transl., 1 10) states that Guchuluk, after losing the battle (on the river Djem), fled through the countries of the Wei-wu (Uigurs) and the Kharlu (Karluks) to the river CKui, where he made a league with the gurkhan of Kara Jcita. The date, 1208, given by the Mohammedan authors for the arrival of Guchluk in Kara Khitai is in accordance with the Ylian shi.



KARAKHITAI (57 LIAO). 231
collected a considerable force, consisting of Naimans and Merkits, and entered into league with Mohammed, sultan of Khovarezm, and Osman, prince of Samarkand, both vassals of the gurkhan. Mohammed and Osman attacked Kara Khitai, and Gucbluk tried at the same time to take the capital, Bclasagun. But his troops were defeated by the Kara Khitai near the river Chinhudje, and Guchluk was obliojed to retreat. In the meantime, the troops of Mohammed and Osman had entered the dominions of the gurkhan and gained a victory over him beyond the city of Tarns, when Guchluk, taking advantage of this event, succeeded in dethroning his father-inlaw. This happened in 121 1 or 12 12, two years after which the old gurkhan died. He was, however, treated with great respect by Guchluk to the end of his days. Having strengthened his authority on the throne of Kara Khitai, Guchluk marched against Ozar, prince of Almalik,
made him prisoner, and ordered his execution. The people of Kashgar and KJwtan, who had withdrawn their allegiance from the usurper, were reduced to obedience by Guchluk's troops, who during several years devastated these countries. Guchluk was a cruel persecutor of Islam. He was himself a Nestorian Christian, as most of the ISTaimans were ; but after his marriage with the daughter of the gurkhan he became a Buddhist. The Arabian historian Ihn el Athir, who wrote at the close of the twelfth century, has left an account of the military doings of the founder of the Kara Khitai dynasty, of which I may give here a brief sketch borrowed from Grigorieff's Eussian translation in his "Eastern Turke
stan," p. 290. I may notice that Ibn el Athir is the first Mohammedan author to mention the Kara Khitai. His record reads as follows :

In the year 522 (a.d. 1 128) there appeared at the frontier of Kashgar the gurkhan of Sin (China), nicknamed " the cripple." He was at the head of an immense army, Ahmed, son of Hassan, who at that



232 KARAKHITAI {SI LIAO).
time ruled over Kashgar, collected his troops and marched out against the enemy ; but he was defeated and died. When the gurkhan had left Sin and arrived in Turkestan, he found there many of his countrymen who had previously emigrated. They were in the service of the khans of Turkestan, who had intrusted them with the defence of the eastern frontier. On the arrival of the gurkhan, all these people went over to him, and with their aid the latter succeeded in establishing his authority over the whole of Turkestan. But the gurkhan did not interfere with the administration of the conquered countries. He contented himself with imposing taxes upon the people, collecting one dinar from each family, and obliged the rulers who had surrendered to attach to their girdles
a certain silver tablet, as a mark of their subjection. Subsequently the gurkhan directed his host to Maverannahar, then ruled over by Malimud, son of Mohammed. This prince advanced from Kliodjend to meet the enemy. A battle took place in the month of Eamazan of 5 3 i (a.d. 1 1 37). Mahmud was defeated and put to flight. He returned to Samarkand and then raised the whole country to appear in arms. He asked also the assistance of the (Seldjuk) sultan Sandjar, imploring him to invite all Mohammedans in order to make a joint attack on the infidels. Thereupon auxiliary forces arrived from Khorassan, Mazanderan, Sedjestan, Ghazna, and other Mohammedan countries. In 1 141 Sandjar himself crossed with
his troops the Amu river. But the gurkhan on his part had also gathered a vast army, consisting of Turks, people from Sin (China) and Khata (K'i-tans), and other countries. He met Sandjar at Katwan, and forced him to withdraw into the valley of Dirgham, where, in 1 142, a decisive battle was fought. The Mohammedan army
was totally defeated. Sandjar escaped, but his wife, a daughter of Arslan Khan, was made prisoner, together with a number of the Mohammedan chiefs. After this the Khata people and the Turks established their power in



KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO). 233
Maverannahar. The gurkhan remained there till 1 1 4 3
,
when he died. He was succeeded in the government of the empire by his daughter, who soon died. She was succeeded by her mother, and finally Mohammed, the son of the gurkhan, reigned.
The Mohammedan authors give the following short accounts of the destruction of the Kara Khitai empire by
the Mongols (d'Ohsson, i. 172). When Chinghiz prepared his expedition to the Mohammedan countries in Western Asia, he despatched a body of 20,000 men, under the command of the Noym Chebe,^^'^ in 1 2 1 8, against Gitchluk, who at that time was in Kashgar. When Chebe approached, Guchluk fled. The Mongol general proclaimed religious liberty, and the people massacred Guchluk's soldiers. After this the Mongols pursued Guchluk and captured him in the mountains of BadakJishan. Chebe ordered him to be beheaded.
The records of the Chinese and Mongol authors regarding the same events, although only fragmentary, corroborate the statements of the Persian historians, and even throw some new light on the subject. In the Yuan shi, chap, cxx., biography of Ho-sze-mai-li (Ismael ?), it is stated that he was a man from the Si yil (Turkestan), a native of Gu-dse-wa-rh-do (the capital of
the Kara Khitai), and a confidant of the Jcito-rh-han (gurkhan) of the Si Liao. He governed the two cities Ko-san and Ba-sze-ha, subject to Gu-dse-wa-rh-do. At the time
The word no-yen as a Mongol title occurs frequently in the Yiian shi. Kovalevsky, in his Mongol Dictionary, translates it by " prince, master, lord, commander." Ohehe was a famous general in Chinghiz' army. His name will be met frequently in these pages. According to E,ashid, who narrates some anecdotes in the life of this hero, he belonged to the Mongol tribe of Yissuts (d'Ohsson, i. 172 ; Berezin, i. 208). In the Yiian shi, where mention is repeatedly made of his exploits, the name is written Dje-bo or Dje-Me. It is strange that his biography has been omitted from the Yiian shi, whilst those of all the illustrious men of the Mongol period are found there.



234 KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO).
of Chinghiz Khan's expedition to the west, he surrendered, together with the chiefs of these cities,^^^ and then entered the avant-guard commanded by Dje-hie (see note 592). When the Naiman (in Kara Khitai) were attacked, Ho
sze-mai-li killed their khan, K' U'cUu-lil (Guchluk), and Dje-bie ordered him to take the head of the victim and carry it through the cities of his empire (i.e., Kara Khitai).
After this the cities of K^O'Shi'lia-Tli (Kashgar), Ya-rhJcien (Yarkand), and 0-duan (Khotan) surrendered to the Mongols.
The Yiian ch'ao pi shi states (Pallad. transl., cxxxi.)
:
Chinghiz ordered Dje-hie to attack GuchithcJc. Dje-bie pursued him to the country called Salikhkun, killed him, and then returned. This event is erroneously recorded there under the year 1 206. But the Ts'in cheng lu agrees with Eashid in placing the destruction of the empire of Kara Khitai under the year 1 2 1 8. It is stated there
(Pall, transl., cxci.) that Chinghiz sent the great general
Dje-hie against K il-cliu-lu ko-han. He pursued him to
the place Sa-li-huan,^^^ were the latter was defeated.
Piano Carpini in his narrative (a.d. 1246) repeatedly mentions the Kara Khitai, and reports about their destruc
tion as follows (p. 648):

" Naimani etiam et Kara-Kitai, id est Nigri Kitai, ex adverse plurimi in quandam vallem strictam inter duos montes, per quam nos euntes ad imperatorem eorum
593 Perhaps Ko-san and Ba-sze-ha are the same as M. Polo's Casern and Pashai (i. 1 60, 172). The first he notices as a province in Badakhshan, the second was situated south of Badakhshan. Ibn Batuta speaks in the same regions of a mountain, Bashai. It is true it is nowhere stated that Badakhshan was subject to the gurkhan of Kara Khitai ; but it is not impossible that it was so, especially as, according to the Persian authors. Guchluk, when pursued by the Mongols, fled to Badakhshan. As the Mohammedan authors record that Guchluk was captured and executed in Badakhshan, we have to look for Salikhun or Salihuan in that country.



KARAKHITAI (SI LIAO). 235
transivimus similiter convenerunt : et commissum est prcelium, in quo Naimani et Kara-Kitai a Mongalis sunt
devicti, et major pars eorum fuit occisa, et alii qui evadere nou potuerunt in servitutem redacti sunt." It may be concluded from Carpini's report that the battle of which he speaks took place in Western Tur
kestan. Eubruck, who passed through the country of the Kara
Khitai a few years later, in 1253, states (p. 259) that the Kara Katay or Nigri Katay inhabited in former times some mountain pastures, which he passed through ; and in certain plains among these mountains their Coir chan (gurkhan) dwelt, who was deposed by a Naiman chief (Guchluk). On p. 280 he mentions the country of the Kara Katay again among the mountains, with a great river in it (the Clm river), and a valley where there were old entrenchments of earth, over which the plough had passed, &c.
The Chinese traveller Ch'ang Te (see Part L No. iv. ) passed between the two mountains I-tu, in the country of the K'i-tan or Kara Khitai, four daj's before he reached Talas. See also note 325.

THE UIGUES.
The name Uigur was applied in ancient times to an Eastern Asiatic nation of Turkish race, who for centuries had played an important role in the history of Eastern and Central Asia. We know from Chinese sources that in the seventh century they had their abodes in the north-western part of Mongolia, and in the eighth century their khans dwelt near the place where, in the thirteenth century, the Mongols built Karakorum. It seems that at the time of the climax of their power the
Uigurs extended their rule far to the west, and their dominions reached even Transoxiana. In the middle of the ninth century their empire in Mongolia was destroyed by the Kirghizes, and they were dispersed. But some time later there were again Uigur kingdoms in Kan chou, at the north-western frontier of China and in the country north and south of the Celestial Mountains. In the latter tracts especially, the Uigurs where known to the Mongols, in the days of Chinghiz Khan, and to the Chinese, as Wei-wu-rh. Very little is known about the Western Uigurs in Central Asia. The Mohammedan authors of the eleventh and twelfth centuries seem to comprise them under the general name of Eastern Turks. The name Uigur is first found in the writings of the Mohammedan
authors in the thirteenth century : and in the same period the name Wei-iou-rh first appears in the Chinese-Mongol annals. Before that time the Chinese termed the Uigurs Hui-ho, by which name, as we shall see, the Chinese historians of the Mongol period generally designated the Mohammedans.



THE UIGURS. 237
As the Uigurs originated from Eastern Asia, we have
of course to look for their history to the Chinese his
torical records, where bulky articles are devoted to this nation. It is not my intention here to give a complete
translation of these accounts, which would be very tedious to the reader. The history of the Uigurs from Chinese sources has long been made accessible to European savants. A good translation of the most important of these records has been given by Yisdelou in the " Suppl. "Bibl. Orient." Father Hyacinth, in his work the "Nations of Central Asia " (in Eussian, I 8 5 i ), gives the most detailed information regarding the history of the Hui-ho or Uigurs, translated from the Chinese annals. But these accounts conclude with the ninth century. Besides these, Klaproth has written a series of very able articles on the Uigurs and their history and language, in which he proves convincingly that the Hui-lio of the Chinese authors,
anterior to the Mongol period, are identical with the Uigurs ; that the idiom of this race belongs to the stock of the Turkish lano-uasres : and that the Mohammedan authors are right in classing the Uigurs among the Eastern Turks. See Klaproth's "Eundgruben des Orientes," 1 8 1 1 ; " Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren ; " his " Verzeichniss der Chines, und Mandschur. Bticher der Koniglichen Bibliothek in Berlin," 1822; his " Asia Polyglotta," 1823; his "Tableaux Hist, de I'Asie," 1826; and his
"Mem. EeL a I'Asie," ii. 301 seg'^'., 1826. Accounts of the Uigurs and their language are also found in Yambery's " Uigurische Sprachmonumente und das Kicdathio Bilik," 1870. The latter, written in Kash
gar, in A.D. 1070, in the Uigur language, is a treatise in
verse on the duties of a ruler to his people. Vambery
gives a translation of this MS. and a vocabulary of the
Uiojur lancrua^^e.
Thus I may confine myself to a summary of the leading facts in the history of the Uigurs from Chinese
sources ; but I shall occasionally dwell longer upon topics



238 THE UIGURS.
not previously published, and upon questions not yet
satisfactorily elucidated.
In the History of the T'ang dynasty (a.d. 618—907) a long article is devoted to the Hui-ho or Uigurs (chap, cclvii. a). It is there stated that at the time of the IsTorthern Wei (a.d. 386—558) the same people were called Kao-cKe (the name may also be pronounced Kao-ku).^^^ During the Sui dynasty (a.d. 589—618) they were known under the name of Wei-ho, They were sometimes also termed Wu-ho, Wu-Jm, and Yilan-ho. Properly
it was only one of the tribes of the Kao ch'e, called
Yilan-ho, from which, according to the T'ang history, the
Hui-ko derived their origin. They at first paid tribute to the khans of the T' u-hile (Turks), but in the beginning of the seventh century they revolted, together with three other tribes of the T'ie-le, declared themselves independent, and took the name Hui-ho. They elected
Sze-gin their ruler. He had the title T^e-gien.^^'^ The name of his family was Yo-lo-ge. The dominions of the Hui-ho were then situated north of the Sie-yen-io.^'^^
The ruler had his residence on the river So-ling.^^^ It
was distant 7000 li from the capital of the T'ang {CJiangan, the present Si an fu in Shen si).
Sze-gin's successor, P'u-sa, established his residence on
In the history of the Northern Wei it is said that the Kao cKe descend from the Hiung-nu. They originally dwelt south of the Mongolian desert and west of the Yellow River, but towards the end of the fourth century of our era they emigrated to the northern verge of the desert. Kao cKe means "high cart." The ancient historians explain this name by the high wheels of their carts. They are sometimes also called T'ie-le, but properly the Kao-ch'e were only a branch of the great (Turkish) fauiily of T'ie-le, who were divided into many tribes. Teghin was in ancient times the title of the rulers of the Turks ; e.g. Alp teghin, Sebeg teghin of the Ghaznevid dynasty (tenth century).
A powerful tribe of the T'ie-le (see note 596). Their abode was on the northern verge of the desert. The Selenga river, a south-western affluent of Lake Baikal.

the river Tu In the year 629 he despatched an envoy to the emperor of China.
P'u-sa's successor, Hu-lu Szc-li-fa Tio-mi-clu, subdued
the tribe of Sie-yen-to (see note 589), crossed the mountain ^(9-/a?i-s/^a?i/'^^ reached the Yellow Eiver, and in 630 sent an envoy to the emperor of China in acknowledgment of his supremacy ; whereupon the Chinese considered the kino-dom of the Hui-ho with the fourteen
tribes of the THc-U (see note 596) as a vassal state.
The territories occupied by these tribes all received Chinese denominations. Their rulers were considered Chinese governors. Thus the land of the Hui-ho tribe proper became the governorship of Han-lmi (see note 9). About twenty khans of the Hui-ho are mentioned in the T'ang history, and many particulars regarding their wars, especially with the T^i-hile (Turks), &c., are given there. I shall only speak of the most distinguished rulers of the Hui-ho. GiL-li F'ei-lo came to the throne in 742. He took
the title Gu-du-lu P'i-liie-kue K' o-han^^'^ killed the khan of the T'u-hue (TviYk^) in 745, and destroyed their empire in Mongolia. He then ruled over the territories of the ancient Hmng-nu. His dominions extended to
the east as far as Slii-wei^^^^ and westward to the Kin shan (Altai mountains), whilst they were bounded on the south by the Ta mo (great desert). P'ei-lo established
The river Tula or Tola, an affluent of the Orkhon, which discharges into the Selenga. This mountain bears still the same name on modern Chinese maps. It is the Ala shan, near the left bank of the Yellow E,iver, visited by Przewalsky in 1871, ^''^ ^M^Zw^' in Turkish means "happy." K'o-han is evidently intended for Jckan, which is the title of the Turkish sovereigns in Asia. In the " Bibliotheque Orientale " this term is translated by "grand et puissant seigneur." The Byzantine historians write Xayduos. 1 may observe that in the Chinese annals the title Jchan appears for the first time under the year A.D. 312. It is there stated that in this year the Han, by name I-li, of the tribe T'o-ha (afterwards the dynasty of the Northern Wei), gave assistance to the Chinese against the Hiung-nu. ^"3 See note 549.



240 THE UIGURS.
his residence between the Wu-te-Jcien mountains and the river Kun.^^^ The Hui-ho nation at that time was divided into nine tribes, viz., Yo-lo-go (which was the tribe of the family of the khan), Hu-du-go, A-wu-chai, Yo-wu-go,
Du-lo-wu, Go-sa, Hi-ye-wu, Mo-go-sze-go, and Hu-iven-so. The Hui-ho were at first on good terms with China, but subsequently, when they grew stronger, they often disturbed the Chinese frontier by their predatory incursions. Mo-yen-djo, the successor of P' ei-lo, came to the throne in 756. He took the title Go-U-U o-lian. He was a valiant warrior, and gave assistance to the Chinese emperor against the rebellion raised by An ho shan. The emperor bestowed upon him a Chinese princess by name of Ning huo. The princess was accompanied by a Chinese envoy to the court of the Hui-ho, where she was handed over to the khan. Mo-yen-djo died the year after this marriage, and the princess returned to China. I-di-ghien, the successor of Mo-yen-djo, in 759 took
the title Mou-yil Tio-han. Before his accession to the throne a Chinese princess had been given to him in marriage, and after her death in 768 he married another Chinese princess, who survived him, and then lived for many years apart from the court of the Hui-ho. She died in that country in 790. Mo-yii died in 779. His successor, Ho-gu dic-lu, with the title F'i-k'ie Ico-han, reigned from 779 to 789. A year before his death he married a Chinese princess, Hien an, who lived twenty years at the court of the Hui-ho, and then died in 808, having been the wife of four khans successively. In the year 788 the Hui-ho solicited the permission of the Chinese emperor to change their former name into Hui-Tin, which would better answer to their warlike char
acter (Im means " a falcon " in Chinese). The emperor
As we shall see farther on, E-ashid states that the Uigurs dwelt near the mountain of Karakorum, which was near the OrJchon river. One of their tribes was called UteTcien. This latter name sounds like the Chinese Wu-te-Men. The Kun river may be identified with the Orkhon.



THE UIGURS. 241
acceded to this request, and some years later the Hui-liu
assisted the Chinese in their war against the T he-fan
(Tibetans) by expelling the latter from Fei t'iiig (see note 157), which had been previously captured by the T'ufan, while they sent the prisoners to the emperor of China. Again, in the year 822, a Chinese princess was given in marriage to a khan of the Hui-hu. Her name was T'ai Jio. A Chinese envoy accompanied her to the residence of the khan, where she kept her own court and was
assisted by two ministers. In the meanwhile the north-western neio-hbours of the Hui-hu, the Sia-gia-sz (or Kie-gia-sz , KirgJiizes) had grown strong, and after harassing the Hui-hu by frequent attacks during about twenty years, they at length, in 840, captured and destroyed the residence of the khan of the Hui-hu. The khan was slain and his people were all dispersed. One of the ministers of the
late khan, by name of F' ang-t* e-le, at the head of fifteen tribes (of the Hui-hu), fled to the Ko-lo-lu (Karluks). Some of them went to Tibet and Ansi. The rest of the
Uigurs, thirteen tribes, emigrated to the south, and finally established themselves near the mountain Ts' 0 tze shan, where they elected a new khan. They then repeatedly disturbed the Chinese frontier; but in 847 the Kirghizes and the Chinese succeeded in dispersing them. The last khan fled to the west ; and such of the people who were left went over to F' ang-te-le, who in the meantime had taken possession of Kan cJwu (in what is now Kansu) and of the cities west of the Tsi desert (see note 1 1 2). He was finally recognised as Khan by the emperor of China. The Hui-hu, however, could never again recover their strength. Such are the most noteworthy points of the accounts reg^ardincf the Uigurs oiven in the T'ansj shu.

In the History of the Liao we find the following records regarding the intercourse of this empire with the Uigurs.
I may notice here a curious tradition recorded by Chinese authors, that in the time of their power the Eui-hu once made prisoner one of the Q



242 THE UIGURS.
We read there, under the year 913, that the Hui-hu of Huo choio (see note 13) presented tribute to the Liao emperor. In 917 the Hui-hu (it is not said from what part) sent an embassy. Another embassy despatched by the Hui-hu (ruler) Ba-li arrived at the court of the Liao in 924, when A-pao-ki, the first Liao emperor, was encamped near the ancient city of the Hui-ho (Karakorum
;
see note 640). In the same year Bi-li-lco, one of the governors appointed by Wu-mu-dju Ico-han, ruler of the Hui-liit of Kan chou, was captured (by the Liao), whereupon A-pao-ki sent one of his officers to the khan (compare about this mission the account of Ye-lli Ta-shi's expedition to the west, supra p. 242). In 925 an embassy from Wu-mu-dju arrived. In 932 the Hui-hu (ruler) A-sa-lan (Arslan) sent an embassy offering tribute. Suh anno 970 it is reported that the Liao emperor directed an envoy to the A-sa-lan ITui-hu. In 988 the same A-sa-lan Hui-ho offered tribute, and in 996 the Hui-hu (ruler) A-sa-lan despatched an embassy to the court of the Liao soliciting the favour of a marriage alliance ; but the emperor refused. Several embassies from the A-sa-lan Hui-hu are recorded in the Liao slii during the eleventh century down to the year 1053. In 1008 the K'i-tan (or Liao) expelled the Hui-hu from
chiefs of the ICi-tan and forced him to tend cattle, I do not remember in what Chinese work I saw the original account, but allusion is made to this story in the narrative of Wang Yen te, who, towards the end of the tenth century, was sent by the Sung emperor to Kao cKang (the present Karakhodjo). He notices a valley through which he passed, where, according to tradition, the K'i-tan had tended the herds of the Hui-hu (Stan. Julien's "Melanges de Geogr, Asiat,," p. 90).. I notice this insignificant record, because it seems to me that the story M. Polo relates in two chapters (ii. 12- 16) about the Golden Icing taken prisoner by Prester John and forced to look after cattle, might perhaps be traced back to this old Chinese tradition, M. Polo having merely changed the names. It is impossible to reconcile Polo's story with the history of the Kin (see note
574). A similar tradition appears in the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, according to which Wang Khan (Ung Khan or Prester John of M. Polo, i, 227) had been made prisoner, together M'ith his mother, by the Tartars, who forced them to tend their cattle (Pallad. transl., p. 76),



THE UIGURS. 243
Kan cliou aud made their klian Yc-la-li prisoner ; but subsequently the Hui-hu defeated the K'i-tan. Twenty years Later, in 1028, the Hia, or Tanguts, who had founded a powerful empire in the present Ordos, attacked the Hui-hu, and succeeded in annexing to their dominions Kan choic, Kiia cliou, Sic cJiou, and other places belonging
to the Hui-hu. During the reigns of Tao tsung, 1055 1 10 1, and T'ien tso, 1 101-25, the last emperor of the Liao dynasty, ten embassies of the Hui-hu to the court of the Liao are mentioned. The Kin, who superseded the Liao in 1 125, and then ruled over the northern part of China for more than a century, received also embassies from the Hui-hu. The Kin shi records an embassy sent in 1 127 by the Hui-hu (ruler) Ho-li J^o-han, and another in the same year by the Hui-hu Ruo-la-san. The last Uigur embassy in the Kin period is mentioned in 1172. The Chinese dynasty of the Sung, who ruled over Middle and South China from 960 to 11 27, also had frequent relations with the Uigurs beyond the northwestern border of China. In chap, ccccxc. of the Sung History we find an article devoted to the Hui-hu. After
a short rSsume of the early history of this nation (as
related above), the historiographer continues, that in the reign of Hui ch'ang (841—847) of the T'ang, the empire of the Hui-hu (in Northern Mongolia) was broken up owing to internal rebellions. The minister P' ang-le (P'ang-t'e-le in the T'ang shu, vide supra) fled to An-si (the present Turfan). Subsequently he was proclaimed l^o-han, and
founded a new empire consisting of the territories of Kan chou, Sha chou, and Si chou (the same as Kao cli ang or Karakhodjo). But the Hui-hu never again recovered their former power. During the Wu tai period (the five short dynasties which succeeded the great T'ang), in the
first part of the tenth century, several embassies of the Hui-hu were seen at the Chinese courts. These embassies continued during the Sung dynasty, in the tenth,



244 THE UIGURS.
eleventh, and twelfth centuries. Some of them are stated to have been sent by the khans of Kan chou and Sha chou, others came from the Hui-hu of Si chou. The last Hui-hu embassy mentioned in the Sung annals arrived in the reign of Siian ho (i 1 19—26). In the same chapter of the Sung shi is an article on the country of Kao clictng, followed by the narrative of a Chinese envoy, Wang Yen te, despatched by the Sung emperor to that country in 9 8 i . A French translation of these accounts by Stan. Julien is found in the " Journ.
Asiat.," 1847, ix- Julien translated from Ma Tuan lin
;
but this historian, who wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century, has copied the Sung history. At the time of the Han, more than a century B.C., there were north and south of the Eastern T'ien shan two kingdoms called posterior and anterior Clie shi (pronounced also Kit shi or Kit sze). In the days of the T'ang the same country was known under the name of Kao ch'ang, and in the year 640, when it became a Chinese province, the name was changed into Si chou. After the fall of the T'ang in the tenth century, Kao ch'ang was an independent kingdom occupied by the Hui-hu, with whom the
Sung, and, as we have seen, also the Liao, carried on
political intercourse. When Wang Yen te visited this country, its king was called A-sz-lan Ran (Arslan Khan), which name the Chinese historians correctly explain by
shi tze ivang, or Lion's king. His kingdom stretched to the west and south-west as far as Ta shi (dominions of the Arabs), Po-sz (Persia), and Si tien (Western Tibet), and bordered to the south on Yil fien (Khotan). The history of Kao ch'ang in the Sung shi concludes with the tenth century. In the eleventh century the Sung emperors received embassies from the Hui-hu of Kui-tze. The name of a realm, Kui tze, appears already in the Han histories. In the T ang period it was also called Kit tze and K^il chi (Hlian Thsang's travels in the seventh century). It



THE UIGURS. 24S
was situated west of Kao cl/ang, in Eastern Turkestan. The Chinese identify it with modern Kucha, as did also Klaprothj Stanislas Julien, Hyacinth, and others. The article on Kui-tze in the Sung shi, chap, ccccxc, states that this place or territory in the eleventh century belonged to
the Hui-liu. We are further told that their ruler there
is called Shi tze 'luang (Lion's king, Arslan Khan, v.s.), and that he is dressed in yellow garments. From Kui-tze (the residence of the khan) to the dominions of the Ta-shi (Arabs) in the west they reckon sixty days' journey ; to the empire of the Hia in the east, ninety days. The Hui-hu of Kui-tze are also called Hui-hu of Si chou. From the year 1029 to 1097 they repeatedly sent envoys presenting tribute to the court of the Sung. From these statements it would seem that the Uigurs of Kao ch'ang or A-sz'-lan Hui-hu, who maintained political intercourse with China in the tenth century, subsequently transferred their head-quarters westward to Kucha. It may be gathered from the above abstracts, drawn' from Chinese history, that after the destruction of the Uigur empire in ISTorthern Mongolia in the middle of the ninth century, and the dispersion of this nation, the remains of them, who had migrated to the south, nevertheless succeeded to a certain degree in recovering their power, and founded two distinct kingdoms, frequently mentioned in the Chinese annals from the tenth to the twelfth century. One part of them, the A-sz-lan Hui
hu of Kao cli ang of the Chinese authors, settled in the land on the eastern spurs of the T'ien shan mountains,and their realm is reported to have bordered on the west upon Persia and the dominions of the Arabs. Another Uigur kingdom existed during this period on the north-western border of China, and occupied the territories of Kan chou,
Kua chou, Sha chou, and other places in the desert. Klaproth (" Tableau Hist, de I'Asie ") considers the country north and south of the eastern T'ien shan, the Che-shi or Ku-sze of the Han, the Kao cliang of the T'ang



246 THE UIGURS.
and Sung, to have been the original seat of the Uigurs more than a century B.C. Klaproth may be right in supposing that the Uigurs dwelt in these regions at so early a date, but no corroboration of this view can be found in Chinese history. 'No mention is made of Uigurs living in Che-shi or Kao chang in the histories of the Han or the T'ang. They are first noticed after their emigration from the north (ninth century) in that country in the Sung history, which states, in the above-quoted article
on Kao ch'ang, that the latter is also called " the country of the Hui-Jm" because many Hui-hu are settled there. In the Yiian shi we read again of the Uigurs, but now they are mentioned by another name. The Chinese history of the Mongols terms them Wei-wu-rh,^^^ and applies this name to the people living north and south of the eastern spur of the T'ien shan. Their principal seat then was Bie-shi-ba-li (Bishbalik; see note 157). Another city of importance there was Ho-la-ho-djo (Kara
kodjo, the same as Huo choii, and Kao cliang, near the present Turfan ; see note 13). The accounts of the Uigurs found in the Yuan shi consist generally of fragmentary statements scattered over the whole work, but met with especially in the biographies of distinguished Uigurs in the
service of the Mongol emperors. Interesting details regarding their ancient history are given in chap, cxxii. in
the biography of Ba-rh-dju a-rli-fe di-ghin,^^'' prince of the Uigurs in the days of Chinghiz. As the traditions related there show a remarkable coincidence with the accounts of the Mohammedan authors, and as the Persian historians profess to have derived their information concerning the Uigurs from the annals of this nation, there can be
^o'' It is not, however, in the Yiian shi that the name Wei-wu-rh appears for the first time. In the Liao History, chap. Ixix., where the tribes tributary to the K'i-tan are enumerated, we find among them the city of (the) Wei-wu-rh. In chap, xxx,, where the wanderings of Ye-lii Ta-shi are recorded, Wei-ivu is mentioned among the seven cities which had sent their chiefs to Ta-shi. See also note 163, Ch'ang ch'un's travels. Compare note 597 about the title teghin.



THE UIGURS. 247
no doubt that the biographer of the Uigur prince was also acquainted with the historical records of the Uigurs.
The biography of Ba-rli-cljii reads as follows :

I-du-liu is the title of the kings of Kao cJiang, who
in former times dwelt in the country called Wci-ivu-rli. There was in that country (where the Uigurs originally
lived) a mountain called I£o-Un,^^^ from which two rivers
took their rise, the T'u-Jm-la and the Sie-ling-l^o.^^^ It
happened once in the night-time that a stream of light fell from heaven upon a tree standing between the two rivers ; whereupon the tree began to swell like a pregnant woman, and after nine months and ten days gave birth to five boys. The youngest received the name Bu-T^o lian. He was afterwards elected kino- and subdued the neighbouring countries. The thirtieth of his suc
cessors was called Yil-lun di-gin. He was valiant and powerful, and frequently engaged in war with the T 'ang emperor, who tried to form an alliance with him by mar
riage. A Chinese princess named Kin lien (golden lotus)
was given in marriage to Go-li di-gin, the son of Yil-lun.
She lived near Ho-lin, at a place called Bie-li-ho-li-da, meaning " the hill where the spouse lives." There was
also another mountain called T'ien-ko-li yu-da-hof^^ meaning " mountain hill of heavenly reason." South of it stood a mountain HiL-li-da-lio^^^ or " mountain of happiness." When the envoy of the T'ang arrived at the
The same title reads I-du-hut in the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, and IdiJcut in the Djami ut Tevarikh. Ho-lin is the Chinese name for Karalcorum (see note 304). Rashideddin also notices a mountain of this name. In speaking of the ancient territory of the Wei-wu-rh, the biographer means the country where Karakorum was situated. ^i*^ Evidently the rivers Tola and Selenga ; see notes 599, 600. Bu-lco Tian seems to be the same as the P'i-Jcie Ico-han of the T'ang history, v. supra, p. 239. 612 Thirty seems to be a misprint. Tengri in all Turkish dialects means " heaven ; " y uz = modus, ratio ;
tagh = mountain (Klaproth). Kol in Turkish = " accident heureux" (Klaproth).



248 THE UIGURS.
frontier of the Wei-wu-rh, he was told that the supremacy of Ho-lin depended on the possession of the mountain of happiness ; if the T 'ang could destroy it, the power of the Wei-wu-rh would be broken. The Chinese envoy accordingly asked from the khan of the Wei-wu-rh merely this mountain as a price for the Chinese princess given in marriage ; to which the khan agreed. As the hill was big, the Chinese made a great fire around and then poured vinegar on it. When it had been broken, it was placed on carts and carried away to China. Subsequently beasts and birds began to utter plaintive cries predicting mischief. Yii-lun died seven days after, and the empire was troubled by the outbreak of rebellions and calamities of all kinds. Several generations later, the dynasty of the Wei-wu-rh was extinguished, and the people were compelled to emigrate.*^^^ They removed their abodes to Xiao choto, which is the same as Suo choio, and occupied the whole country comprised under the name of Bie-shi-ha-li (Bishbalik).^^^ Their dominions then stretched to the
north as far as A-sliio, and south as far as Tsiu tsilan ; on the east they bordered upon Wu-tun and Gia-shi-ha,^^^ and on the west were contiguous to Si fan!'^^ There they dwelt more than 970 years,^^^ to the time of Ba-rh-dju.
Comparing this Uigur tradition with the statements in the T'ang shu on the same subject, we find that they agree in the chief points, although there are some differences between them respecting the names of the khans and the Chinese princesses. Besides this, the Uigur record presents some anachronisms. Goli digin is probably identical with the Go-le Tco-han of the T'ang shu. See notes 13 and 157. The name of a district established under the Han dynasty in the second century B.C. The present Su cliou in Kan su. Probably Khotan and Kashgar are meant. But there is some coiifusion as to the position assigned to these countries in the above account. 61^ Si fan means "western foreigners;" but this name denotes generally, since the days of the Ming at least, and perhaps earlier, the northwestern part of Tibet. 620 There is evidently a mistake again in the figure. The Uigurs were expelled from Northern Mongolia in the middle of the ninth century, and Bardju lived in the beginning of the thirteenth century.



THE UIGURS. 249
Ba-rh-djii was a vassal of the K'i-tan (Kara Kliitai) but after hearing (in 1209) that Chinghiz was about to move on an expedition to So fa?ig,^''^ he ordered the
officers of the K 'i-tan who where stationed in his country
to be slain, and sent to Chinghiz to offer submission. The emperor then sent envoys to the I-du-hit, who was much delighted, and despatched another embassy to Chino-hiz with the followino; answer : ''Your servant has heard of your majesty. I hate the K'i-tan, and for a long time I have entertained the desire to submit to your power. Now that the message of your highness has reached me, I am happy to have an opportunity of accomplishing my
desire ; and I shall rejoice to hear that all nations have acknowledged your majesty's supremacy." Chinghiz at that time attacked T^ai-yang han'^'-^^ and T^o-t^oF^ When the latter had been slain, his four sons ^^'^ fled with the head of their father to the river Ye
rh-di-sJii (Irtysh ; see note 5). Then Ba-rh-dju joined (the Mongol army) and defeated and killed the four sons
in a battle on the river CJian (or Tsan)F^^ After this lie sent envoys with valuable presents to the emperor; and when Chinghiz was encamped on the river KHe-lulien (Kerulun ; see note 1 1 6), the I-du-hu arrived in person (in i 2 1 1, in spring, according to the annals of the
Yuan shi), and solicited permission to make a present of horses and dogs to the sons of the emperor. Chinghiz was moved by the I-du-hu's words, bestowed upon him
his daughter Ye-li-an-dtcn,^^^ and received him as a son.

He had previously crushed a rebellion of ten thousand men of his troops, who had been unwilling to submit to the new institutions. After his death the title of I-du-hu passed successively to his son, grandson, &c. (I omit the details regarding his
successor.)^^^ There are many other biographies in the Yuan shi devoted to Uigurs of eminence in the service of the Mongol emperors.

Let us now turn to the western mediaeval accounts of the Uigurs. They were not known by this name in Western Asia before the beginning of the thirteenth century or the Mongol period ; but it may be assumed that the Arabs came in contact with these people at a much earlier time. The afore-mentioned Chinese envoy Wang Yen te informs us that at the end of the tenth century, when he visited the country of the Uigurs of Kao ch'ang, their empire extended to the west as far as the dominions of the Arabs and Persia. We know further from the Tarikh Djihan Kushai that the city of Belasagun (see note 583) had been founded by Buku Khan, sovereign of the Uigurs ; and even in Chinese history we meet with an



252 THE UIGURS.
allusion to the fact that the founder of the Kara Khitai dynasty had established his residence (on the river Chu, as we have seen) in a country inhabited by Hui-hu. Eeinaud, in the preface to his " Abulfeda," p. 360 seqq., affords evidence that the Turkish race called Tagazgaz by the Arabian geographers of the ninth and tenth centuries
is identical with the Uigjurs, Mas'udi states that in his days (he died 956) the Tagazgaz were the most valiant, numerous, and best governed among the Turk tribes. Their empire extended from Khorassan to Sin (China). Their principal city was called Kushan ; their king had the title irklian. Mas'udi adds that the Tagazgaz were the only Turk tribe who professed the Manichean doctrine. Eeinaud thinks that Kushan is Kucha in Eastern Turkestan ; Barbier de Meynard identifies this name with Kao cUang of the Chinese annals. As to the doctrine of Mani (or Manes), I may observe that Wang Yeng te, in his narrative, notices in Kao ch'ang a temple of (devoted to) Mani {Ma-ni sz), and served by monks from Persia, who have their particular rules, and who declare the books of the Buddhists to be heretical. Ibn el Athir (i 160-1233), in his Kamil-ut-Tevarikh, gives an account of the Ilkhans, or khans of Turkestan, who reimed there and in Transoxiana from the middle
o
of the tenth century till 121 3. De Guignes, Eraehn, Eeinaud, and other Orientalists, take them to be an Uigur dynasty ; and it seems they are right. Professor Grigorieff published in the Memoirs of the Eussian
Archseol. Soc, xvii., 1874, a paper on this dynasty, which he calls the Karakhanids, from the name of the first ruler, Satuk Karakhan, who embraced Islam. But the first distinguished sovereign among the Karakhanids was Boghra Khan, whose empire is said to have extended eastward as far as Sin (China). Belasagun was his
residence. He ruled also over Kashgar, the capital of Turkestan (called also Ordukend), Khotan, Karakorumy



THE UIGURS. 253
Taras, and Farah (Otrar). Boghra Khan made an expedition to Mavarannahar, captured Bokhara, and died on his way back to Turkestan in 993. His successor, Ilek EJmn, in 1008 superseded the dynasty of the Samanids in Mavarannahar, and estab
lished his authority over this country. He was succeeded by hi's brother Toghan. In the year i o 1 7, we are told by the Arabian historiographer, a numerous army from Sin (China) appeared in Turkestan, and advanced as far as three stations from Belasagun. But Toghan
collected his troops, defeated the enemy,*^^^ and pursued him for three months. On his return to Belasagun he died in 1018. The next rulers enumerated are Arslan Khan, Kadyr Khan, Arslan Khan, and then Boghra Khan. In the reign of this latter the above-mentioned Uigur MS., the
Kudatku bilik, was written. It is dated a.d. 1070, Kashgar. In the reign of Mahmud Khan the Kara Khitai conquered Turkestan (Belasagun, Kashgar).^^^ The Ilkhans continued to rule over Maverannahar (Samarkand, Bokhara) as vassals of the gurkhan of Kara Khitai. In
1 2 1 3, Osman, the* last of these khans, was killed by Sultan Mahmud Khorazm Shah, who then took possession of these provinces. As has been stated above, the name Uigur occurs in the Mohammedan records first in about the middle of the thirteenth century, although it was known probably earlier in Western Asia ; it is applied to that branch of the Uisfurs known to the Chinese and Mongols under the name of Wei-wu-rh, and established on the eastern spurs of the T'ien shan (Bishbalik, Karakhodjo). The state
^-^ This event is also recorded in the Byzantine annals. Comp. Muralt's "Essai de Chron. Byzant.," i. p. 590, s. a. 1017, where we read : "Toghan defeats the Turks near Belasagun." The Chinese annals do not mention this expedition, which probably was undertaken by the Eastern Uigurs, not by the Chinese. This happened in about 1 124, according to the Chinese annals.



254 THE UIGURS.
ments of the Mohammedan authors regarding the Uigurs and their history are, as we shall see, in substantial accordance with what the Yuan shi records about the Wei-wu-rh. The Tarikh Djihan Kushai gives accounts of the Uigurs in great detail. I present in the following pages an English version of d'Ohsson's translation (i. 430 seqq.), omitting, however, some unimportant particulars. The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai first states, in the
introduction of his article, that his information has been
drawn from Uigur books ; but signifies his disbelief in
these tales, which he reports only as a curiosity, whereupon he continues as follows :

The Uigurs have a tradition that they originally dwelt on the banks of the river Orhm,^^^ which takes its rise in the mountains called Karakorum,^^^ whence the name of the city recently built by the khan (Ogotai) has been
derived. Thirty rivers take their rise among these
mountains, and thirty tribes dwelt on their banks.^^^ These Uigurs, who had their abodes in the valley of the Orkun, were divided into two tribes. Having considerably increased in number they elected a king, and five hundred years later BtcJao Khan appeared. People say that he is the same as Efrassiah.^^^ There is among the mountains of Karakorum an ancient pit of Pijen.^^^ The vestiges of a city and a palace are to be seen on the banks of the Orkun. The ancient name of this city was Ordu halik, but it is known now under the name of Mao
The Orkhon of our maps. Probably the Kun river of the T ang history is the same. See note 604. See note 609. These regions, in fact, abound in water. Numerous rivers and rivulets run down from the north-eastern slope of the Khangai mountain, all tributaries of the Orkhon or the Selenga. 634 This is the name of a famous king of the Turks mentioned in Firdusi's " Shahnameh." 63» The name of a Persian hero who was taken prisoner by Efrassiab, and kept for some time in a well. He was delivered by the famous Kustem. See the " Shahnameh.

halik.^^^ Before the palace are found some stones covered with inscriptions, which we have seen. In the reign of the khan (Ogotai) these stones were removed, when a pit was discovered in which was a great stone tablet with an inscription. The khan ordered it to be examined by people of different nations, but no one was found who could read it. Finally the khan sent to China for men who are called Karnes (see note 641). The inscription, which proved to be in their language and character, was as follows :

At a place called Kumlandju^ situated at the junction
of the rivers Tugola and Selinga^'^^ which take their rise in the mountains of Karakorum, there were two
trees close together ; one of them a fistuk tree, resembling a pine, evergreen like a cypress and with cone
like fruit ;
^'^^ the other a wild pine. Between these two trees a hillock appeared, upon which a stream of light descended from heaven ; whereupon the hillock began to grow, and marvellous things were seen about it. Just after the lapse of the period of a woman's pregnancy, the hillock opened, and five hillocks resembling tents were
seen. In each tent was a little boy, and to these boys the people paid the greatest respect. The youngest of them, called Buhu tekin, was very intelligent, and subsequently the Uigurs made him their khan. The reign of Buhu Khan was very prosperous, and he was marvellously assisted by three ravens sent by heaven. They knew all the lano^uasfes of the world and broucrht news whencesoever it was required. It happened once that a spirit under the shape of a maid appeared to Buku Khan in a dream and conducted him to the mountain Kut tag.^'^^ There they

Besides, this tree is not found in Mongolia. 639 Probably the same as the Hu-li-da-Jio or " Mountain of Happiness " in the Chinese records. See p, 247.

had conferences every night for seven years, six months, and twenty-two days. On the last night the maid took leave and revealed to Buku that he would rule over the whole world. He then assembled his troops and sent his brothers to wage war against the Mongols, the Kirghizes, the Tanguts, and the Khitai. All returned to the river Orkun with great booty and a large number of
captives. After this the city of 07'du halih was built.^*^ Buku Khan had another dream, in which he saw a man dressed in white, who gave him a piece of jade in the form of a pine tree, and said to him, "As long as you
are able to keep this piece of jade in your possession, you will rule over the four quarters of the globe." His minister had the same dream. Buku Khan then directed his armies to the west and arrived in Turkestan, where he established his residence in a beautiful plain abound
ing in water and pasture. There he built the city of
We have seen that, according to the T'ang annals, Gu-du-lu P'i-JcieIcue K'o-han, chief of the Hui-ho, in the middle of the eighth century established his residence on the river Kun (Orkun of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai). I have no doubt that P'i-Tcie-Tcue K'o-han is the Buku Khan of the Persian record and the Bu-k'o lian of the Yiian shi. The ancient map of Mongolia appended to the Yiian shi lei pien marks Bo-Tco han cKeng or city of Bo-ko han north-east of Karakorum. The existence of the ancient capital of the Uigurs near the place v^^here afterwards the Mongols built Karakorum, and of the ancient inscriptions there, is corroborated by
the annals of the Liao (K'i-tan). We read in the Liao shi, chap. ii. : The emperor T'ai tsu (Apaoki, 916-927) in 924 undertook a journey through the ancient territories of the Shan-yii (the khans of the ancient Iliung-nu in Mongolia). On the first day of the ninth month he encamped near the ancient city of the Hui-hu, where he ordered a marble tablet to be erected, with the accounts of his victories engraved. . . . He gave orders also to take water from the Kin ho (Golden river), and stones from the TFi* s/iaw (Black mountain, probably the Karakorum mountain), and carry them home on carts to the river Huang ho (the Shara muren in Eastern Mongolia), and the mount Mu-ye (a sacred mount of the Liao, situated at the junction of the Lo-ha river and the Shara muren), to build a monument for posterity, to prove that the rivers and the mountains have come to offer tribute. . . . On the 29th of the same month (the emperor sojourned still at the same place), he ordered the ancient monument of P'i-k'o han to be restored. Besides this an inscription was made in letters of the K'i-tan, T'u-lcue (Turks), and Chinese, to glorify the feats of P'i-lco han.



THE UIGURS. 257
Belasagim, now called Gu-halih (see note 583). In the space of twelve years Buku Khan succeeded in subduing the whole world. His armies advanced as far as the regions where the people resembled brutes, and they were informed that no inhabitants were to be found beyond. The kings of all the subdued countries were carried to Buku Khan, who received them with benevolence,
with the single exception, however, of the king of India, to whom an audience was refused owing to his extreme ugliness. All were allowed to return to their countries after tribute had been imposed upon them. When Buku Khan had completed this great enterprise, he left Belasagun and returned to his native country. As to the religion of the Uigurs at the time spoken of, they had certain magicians which they called Kam^^^ The same are found even now among the Mongols. These magicians say that they are possessed by demons, who inform them of everything they wish to know. Even now the greater part of the descendants of Chinghiz have the firmest faith in them. Nothing of importance is undertaken without consulting the astrologers. These Kams also cure maladies. The Uigurs sent to the khan
of Khitai—an idolatrous country—for the men called Numi. These have a sacred book called num,^^^ which'is
their moral code, a collection of fables and tales inter
spersed with good precepts. Amongst other things, it is
^"^^ There can scarcely be any donbt that by Kam the Shamans are meant, conjurors who have their peculiar superstitious belief, and who even nowa-days sustain an important role in Mongolia and some parts of Siberia. In the History of the T'ang, chap. cclix.&, in the article Kie-gia-sz (Kirghizes), we find a statement (referring to the ninth century) that in this country the fortune-tellers or diviners are called ^an (evidently the same as Kam). Potanin informs us (" Mongolia," ii. 8i) that now-a-days the Shamans are called Bo by the Mongols, Kham by the Urianghai tribe north of the Tangnu-ola mountains, Balcsy by the Kirghizes (compare Bacsi of M. Polo). In Siberia and Russia they are called Shamans ; and this is, according to Professor Schott, Berlin (Ermann's " Archiv.," xxiii.), originally a Tungus word. The Chinese term them t'iao shen (dancers before the spirits). D'Ohsson renders Numi by " lamas."_ In modern Mongol num means a "sacred book."
K



258 THE UIGURS.
enjoined to abstain from injuring other persons, or even dumb animals. There are several sects of the Numi, who differ in their dogmas. The most wide-spread is the sect believing in the doctrine of metempsychosis, &c. When the Numi arrived from Khitai, the Uigurs arranged a discussion between them and the Kam, in order to test the respective merits of the two religions ; but after the Numi had read some chapters of their books, the Kam could say nothing in reply. The Uigurs thereupon embraced the religion of the Numi. Amongst all the
idolaters of the East, these are the bitterest enemies of Islamism. We have not given more than the hundredth part of the absurdities found in the Uigur books in
order to show the ignorance and stupidity of these people. One of my friends told me that he had read in a book the above-related story of the two trees, with the explanation, that a man had scooped out the trunks of
these trees, put his boys in the cavities, and placed a
light in the vicinity. Buku Khan was happy to the end of his life, and was succeeded by one of his sons. Subsequently the Uigurs observed that all beasts, domestic as well as wild, and
even the little children, uttered the words gliech, ghech, which means " go away." They took this for a divine command and emigrated ; but the same sounds continued to be heard by the Uigurs until they had arrived at the plain where subsequently the city of Bislibalik was founded.^**
There they settled and established five divisions, which
they called Bislibalik (five cities).^^^ From that time the
Ghech in Turkish is the imperative mood of the verb ghechmeJc, " to go away." See Klaproth "Mem. Rel. I'Asie," ii. 341. The Persian historian does not state at what time this emigration of the Uigurs took place ; but as, according to the Chinese accounts of the Uigurs, P'i-lcie Tco-han or Buku Khan lived in the middle of the eighth century, and the empire of the Uigurs in Northern Mongolia was destroyed in 840, they emigrated probably to the T'ien shen immediately after this event. I am not aware what d'Ohsson intended by " ils batirent cinq quartiers auxquels ils donnerent le nom de Bishbalik ; " it is not clear whether he means one city with five divisions or five separate cities.



THE UIGURS. 259
descendants of Baku Khan have continued to rule over
this country, and their kings bear the title of IdiJciU.
Eashid, in his accounts of the Uigurs, gives some new information (d'Ohsson, i. 436, 109; Berezin, i. 124).
The name Uigur, which means " allies, auxiliaries," in Turkish, he explains by the tradition that Oghuz Khan, the progenitor of all the Turk tribes, had bestowed this name on some of his relatives who adhered to him when he was attacked by the others. Eashid states further :

It is reported that in the (ancient) country of the
Uigurs there are two ridges of mountains ; one is called Bithratu huzluh, the other Uskun liik tangrin. Between them is the mountain Karakorum, the name of which has been given to the city built by Ogotai Khan. Near the two chains there is yet another mountain, called Kut tag (see note 639). There is in these regions, occupied an
ciently by the Uigurs, a country irrigated by ten rivers, and another with nine rivers. Those tribes who dwelt
on the borders of the ten rivers wxre called On Uigurs
;
those who settled in the valleys of the nine rivers, Tokuz
Uigurs.^^^ The following are the names of the ten rivers,
called also On Orkitn
:

Islikil ; in some MSS. Ishlih. Onigher. Tukair. Uzkaicler ; in some MSS. Ashander. Bularj Berezin reads Tula. Baclar J in some MSS. Tardar. Ader (this is still the name (Eder) of one of the sources of the Selenga). Uch tabin. Kamlandju (a place of this name is mentioned in the Tar. Dj. Kushai, at the junction of the Tola and the Selenga. Vide su]pra). UtiJcian (the name of a mountain Wu-te-lden near the river Kun (or Orkhon) is mentioned in the T ang history. Vide supra, p. 240).
On in Turkish means " ten ; " tohuz, "nine " (d'Ohsson).



26o THE UIGURS.
Nine tribes were settled on the first three of these
rivers ; five tribes on the next four rivers. The ninth river, Kamladju, traversed the land of the tribe Ong
;
and on the borders of the tenth, Utikian, the tribe Kamen
ati {Kumuh ati) dwelt.^*^ Besides the aforesaid tribes, there were a hundred and twenty other Uigur tribes, the names of which are unknown. At first the Uigurs for a long time had no sovereign ; each tribe was ruled by its
chief. But finally the tribes elected two general chiefs, one by name Mitnke hai of the tribe Ishkil, to whom they
gave the title of Il-Iltyrir ; the other, of the tribe Urkan
dur, was called Kid-Irkin. Both ruled conjointly. Their posterity reigned for a hundred years over the Uigurs. In later times the rulers of the Uigurs bore the title of Idikut, i.e., Lord of Happiness. In the days of Chinghiz, Bardjuk was Idikut of the Uigurs. When the gurkhan (of Kara Khitai) had conquered Mavarannahar and Turkestan, Bardjuk became his tributary, and Shadkem was appointed the gurkhan's governor in the country of the Uigurs, where he was hated on account of his extortions. Subsequently Bardjuk heard of the great success of Chinghiz, and gave orders to kill the Kara Khitai governor, who then was in the city of Karakliodjo, and hastened to recognise Chinghiz, to whom he despatched Katalmysh-Kata, Omur-ugid, and Tatari with a letter, in which he wrote : " As when the clouds break and disclose the sun burning with renewed lustre, as the cracking ice displays the pure blue stream below, so did the arrival of thy envoys (Chinghiz had previously sent two of his officers) change my grief into the most lively joy." Chinghiz had been previously
6^'' In the T'ang History [v. supra) nine tribes of the Uigurs are enumerated, of which Rashid does not give the names. The great Chinese geography states that the Selenga has six sources and three affluents ; but only the principal sources are enumerated there. The system of the Selenga abounds in watercourses. Compare the great Chinese map and the map appended to Pevtsoff's "Mongolia." ^3 This passage sounds like a literal translation from the Yiian ch'ao pi



THE UIGURS. 261
informed that the Idikut had refused to harbour the brother and the sons of Tuhta (see notes 623, 624) after
their defeat on the river Djem (see note 590), and accordingly the envoys were kindly received. Chinghiz invited the Idikut to come in person to render homage, and to bring as presents the most precious things found in his treasury. When Bardjuk arrived, he was received with the greatest cordiality by Chinghiz, and returned home with many marks of distinction. When Chinghiz subsequently attacked GucMuh (son of the khan of the N"aimans and gurkhan of Kara Khitai), Bardjuk at the head of 500 of his men accompanied the expedition and returned covered with glory. When Chinghiz directed his host against the Tadjiks (Persia), the Idikut with his division accompanied the army of the princes Chagatai and Ogotai, distinguished himself at the capture of Otrar^ and after this was in the suite of Chinghiz. When the latter had returned from the west and again marched out against the Tangut empire, Bardjuk with his division left Bislibalik and joined the army of the conqueror. To reward all these merits Chinghiz had promised to Bardjuk his daughter Alhcm highi in marriage, but owing to Chinghiz' death the marriage was postponed. As this princess finally died before the marriage had been consummated, Ogotai Khan bestowed upon the Uigur prince another princess, Aladji highi (see note 626) ; but Bardjuk died, and then the princess was given to his son Kishmain, who succeeded his father as Idikut of the Uigurs. After the death of Kishmain his brother Salendi succeeded him.
I may finally mention the Christian mediseval autho
rities who have left notices of the Uigurs. The latter were probably known long before the Middle Ages to the
shi, and furnishes evidence, which indeed might be fortified by many other examples, that the author of the Mongol history of Chinghiz has drawn his information from the same sources as Rashid-eddin. See the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, chap. xi. fol. 4, Chinghiz' relations with the Idikut.



262 THE UIGURS.
ISTestorian Christians, who since the fifth century began to spread their faith among the heathen nations of Asia. We know that already in the seventh century their church was numerously represented in Central and Eastern Asia. J, S. Assemani, the celebrated orientalist ( 1 687— 1 768), in his "Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Yaticana," states that in the history of the ISTestorians the name of Ighur or laghuT is of frequent occurrence, and denotes the Eastern Turks of Khatai. Ahulfaradj or Bar Hebrceus (1226-86), who in his chronicle, written in Syriac, has a good many details about
the Eastern Christians, notices the Igliurs as a numerous tribe of the Eastern Turks belondnoj to Khatai. It is a well-established fact that the Uigurs, when they first reduced the Turkish language to writing, borrowed the alphabet from the early Nestorian missions ; but it is impossible to fix the date of this adoption of the Syriac written characters by the Uigurs. It is also well known that the Uigur character was the original source of those still used by the Mongols and Manchus. PI. Carpini (1246) does not hesitate to declare that
the Uigurs were ISTestorian Christians. We read in his
narrative (650, 65 i) : "Chingis contra terram Huiurorum processit ad bellum ; isti homines sunt Christiani de
secta Nestorianorum : quos bello devicit; et illorum litteras acceperunt, nam prius (Mongali) scripturam aliquam non habebant ; nunc autem appellant eandem litteram Mongalorum." BuhrucJc, however, who visited the country of the
Uigurs a few years later, states that they are idolaters. When speaking of the idolaters of Asia (282) he says: " Primi sunt lugures, quorum terra contiguatur cum prsedicta terra Organum,^*^ inter montes illos versus orientem
;
et in omnibus civitatibus eorum sunt mixti N"estorini et Saraceni, et ipsi etiam sunt diffusi versus Persidem in civitatibus Saracenorum." After this Eubruck gives a

THE UIGURS. 263
detailed account of the worship of the Uigurs. Further on (289) he says: " Apud lugures est fons et radix idiomatis Turci et Comanici." Haithon, in his " History of the Eastern Kingdoms " (see note 450), applies the name Tense to the country of the Uigurs, whom he terms logurs (see note 160).
PI. Carpini (651, 708) mentions Sari-Huiur among the countries or nations subdued by Chinghiz. In the Ylian shi, chap, cxxi., biography of Su-hu-tai, it is stated that in 1226 this Mongol general received
orders to cross the Ta tsi (great stony desert, see note
112) and to subdue the tribes of Sa-li Wei-iou-rh, T'e-le, and Clii-min. In the Ming shi the abode of the Sari Uigurs (Yellow Uigurs) is more precisely indicated. We
read there, chap, cccxxx., that the military station An ting, situated 1500 li south-west of Kan chou, was in the country of the Sa-li Wei-iuu-rh mentioned in the Ylian History. Thus we have to look for the Sari Uigurs somewhere north of Zaidam, on the southern verge of the stony desert. An envoy from Khotan, sent to the Chinese court in i o 8 1 , reported that between Khotan and the Tangut empire he had to cross the desert of the yellowheaded Hid-lio. (See Eemusat's " Ville de Khotan," p. 95.) These are probably the same as the Sari Uigurs. The Sarigh Uigurs are repeatedly spoken of in the descriptions of Timur's warlike expeditions against the Jetes, end of the fourteenth century, as given in the Jarikhi Eashidi. It appears from these Mohammedan accounts that this tribe was west of Charchan. See Bellew's " History of Kashgar " in Eorsyth's " Mission to Yarkund," 1873, P- I47> 153? In the same history,
p. 167, we read: ''Said of Kashgar set out in 15 15 on an expedition against the Sarigh Uigur, twelve days' journey from Khotan."

CHINESE MEDIEVAL NOTICES OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.
It was in the reign of emperor Wu ti (B.C. 140—86) that the Chinese first became acquainted with the countries of Western Asia. In 126 B.C. the adventurous Chinese general Chang K' ien returned, having been absent for more than ten years, from the countries of the laxartes and the Oxus. After he had opened up communication between China and the far west, the intercourse of the Middle Kingdom with Western Asia, by water or overland, was maintained, with short interruptions, during many centuries, by the several dynasties which successively reigned over the whole of China or a part of it. Thus the Chinese came in contact with the nations who now profess Islam long before Mohammed had made his appearance. The Pariliians (dynasty of the Arsacidse, B.C. 256—a.d. 226) were known to them under the name of An-si. Since the middle of the fifth century of our era mention is made in the Chinese annals of the country or people of Fo-sz',^^^ and the notices given of it leave no doubt that Persia is meant. Many embassies from Po-sz' to China are recorded in Chinese history from the fifth to the seventh century, and in the T'ang History we find even some particulars regarding Yi-sze-sze (Yezdejerd III.), the last king of the Sassanian dynasty, who was slain in 652. The Arabs are spoken of in the Chinese annals soon after the rise of Islam. The great T'ang dynasty,
The famous Chinese traveller Huan Thsang, in the middle of the seventh century, calls Persia Po-la-sz' (Pars).



THE MOHAMMEDANS. 265
618-907, was contemporary to the rise and zenith of Arabian power. In the T'ang History the Arabs are always styled Ta-shi. By these two characters doubtless the Persian " Tazi " was represented. This was the name by which the Persians designated the Arabs.^^^ The Arabian legends regarding Mohammed are recorded by the Chinese historians quite in accordance with Mohammedan tradition, and the accounts of the first conquests of the Arabs are also given by them with
tolerable correctness. The T'ang shu notices also several embassies of the Califs to the Chinese court in the seventh and eighth centuries, namely, of Han-mi mo-moni (a Chinese corruption of Emir al mumenin, " Prince of the Believers," a title which was assumed by OtJiman), A-bo-lo-ba (Abul Abbas), A-pu cJia-fo (Abu Djafar), A-lun (Harun al Eashid). It is known from Chinese sources, as well as from the accounts given by Arabian
travellers who visited China, that in the eighth century there were great factories of Arabian merchants in Canton. The intercourse between the Arabs and China still continued by land and sea during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. The History of the Sung, 9601280, mentions twenty embassies sent by the Ta-shi, The Sung did not reign over the whole of China
;
for the northern provinces were subject, at first to the K'i-tan or Liao, and subsequently to the Kin. The Liao in the north had also communications with the Arabs. In the Liao shi, chap, ii., it is recorded that the first emperor of the Liao dynasty received an embassy from the Ta-shi in 924, when he sojourned near the ancient capital of the Hui-ho (see note 640).*^^^

266 THE MOHAMMEDANS.
Archimandrite Palladius, in his article on the Mohammedans in China (" Eecords of the Eussian Eccl. Miss. Peking," iv. 438), states that in Si an fu, where the well-known Nestorian tablet of the time of the T'ang was dug up, another ancient monument has been discovered, referring to the introduction of Islam into China. This Mohammedan tablet is said to bear the date A.D. 742, and records that during the reign of the Sui emperor K' ai Miang (581—600), Islamism first penetrated to China. Palladius gives no details about this tablet, but he has kindly informed me that it is spoken of in several Chinese works on Mohammedanism. I find in the Ming I t'ung chi or Geography of the Ming, published in 1 46 1, the following statement, referring evidently to
that alleged inscription. In chap, xc, fol. 12, we read under the head of Mo-de-na, the realm of the ancestor of the Hui-hni or Mohammedans (Medina), that in the reign of K'ai huang of the Sui dynasty, Sa-ha-ha Sa-a-di Gan-go-szf^^ a man who had arrived from that country, first taught his doctrine in the Middle Kingdom. But at the time assigned here to the introduction of Islam into China, Mohammed w^as still an obscure merchant. Palladius quotes also a biography of Mohammed, written by a Chinese Mohammedan, in which it is stated that in a.d. 587, the emperor of China sent an embassy to Mohammed in Arabia, to invite him to China. The
latter refused, but sent his portrait, which, however, subsequently disappeared from the canvas, in order that it might not become an object of worship. Another Chinese Mohammedan work, the Hui-hui yilan led, an apocryphal narrative of the introduction of Mohammedanism into China, bearing date 1754, records that in the year A.D. 628, the emperor of China sent an envoy with a letter to the king of the Mohammedans
;

THE MOHAMMEDANS. 267
and \yhen this embassy returned, it was accompanied by a turbaued Mohammedan priest and 3000 followers. These are said to have formed the foundation of the Mohammedan colonies in China. These tales are not corroborated by the chroniclers of the Sui and T'ang periods. There can, however, be no doubt that at the time of the T'ang many Mohammedans were settled in China. In early times, when the Chinese began to extend their power over the countries west of China proper, they denominated them by the general term Si yil, or " western
countries." It seems this name came first into use when Chanq- K'ien had returned from Western Asia. In the History of the Former Han, chap, xcvi., where the coun
tries of the Si yll are first described, it is stated that the Si yli begins at the Chinese fortresses Yil men kuan and Yang huan. Both were situated in the western part of the present Kansu, west of Kia yil huan, one of the principal gates of the Great Wall, and near the end of it. The name of Si yli is still applied in a general sense to the same regions of Central and Western Asia inhabited by Mohammedan people. Down to the twelfth century the Mohammedans are not designated by a general name in Chinese history. In the T'ang history, where they are first mentioned, they go under the name of Ta shi (Arabs). Hui-hui is now the common Chinese name for all professors of Islamism. It seems this term occurs first in the Liao shi. In the article on the Western Liao or
Kara Khitai above translated, it is stated that the ruler
of the Hui-liiii paid tribute to the chief of the Kara Khitai (a.d. 1124). The History of the Kin also once uses this name, stating that in the twelfth century there w^as a regiment of the Hui-hid in the army of the Kin, who were able to cast inflammable substances. In the Yuan shi the term Hni-liui for Mohammedans is met with in only a few instances ; they being generally styled there Hui-ho or Hiii-lm. These latter denominations



268 THE MOHAMMEDANS,
have given rise to a great confusion in Chinese history
;
for in the T'ang period, and even in the twelfth century, only the Uigurs were designated by these names. The Yuan shi, however, applies to the Uigurs a new name, Wei-wu-rh, whilst the terms Hui-ho and Hui-lm, when met with in the Yiian history, always denote the Moham
medans. It is difficult to explain the origin of this confusion of names. Perhaps the Chinese confounded Uigurs and Mohammedans because the Western Uigurs in Turkestan, Kashgar, &c., had accepted Islam. In the transliterated Mongol text of the Yiian ch'ao pi shi (middle of the thirteenth century) the country of the Mohammedans is termed Sart-ol (Sart-aul). The same name is tliere also applied to the people. The
Chinese translation of the Mongol text, made in 1388, renders Sartol by Hui-lm. The Sart or Sartol of the Mongols are evidently the same as the Sarti of PL Carpini (p. 710). ISTow-a-days Sart is a designation of the settled Mohammedans in Turkestan, Transoxiana, Khiva, who do not lead a nomadic existence. P. Lerch (" Euss. Eevue," i.) derives the word Sart from laxartes ; for in old writers it was used at first almost exclusively for the settled inhabitants of the lower valley of the laxartes. Most of the merchants then were Sarts, as now-a-days.^^^ In a few cases the Chinese writers of the Mongol period call the Mitssidmaiis by this very name. In the Yiian shi, chap, v., we read that in 1262 an imperial decree was issued that young men belonging to the
families of the 3£u-su-man, Wei-ivu-rli (Uigurs), Ye-liJco-wen (Christians), and Ba-shi-man (Mollahs), are to be
employed in military service. The Kin envoy Wu-ku-sun, 1220 (see above, p. 30), speaks of the Mu-su-lu-man Hui-ho in Persia.
654 D'Ohsson is wrong in stating that the Mongols called the Mohammedans Tadjiks (i. 216). In early times the Persians were called Tadjiks, and even now-a-days this name is applied in Turkestan and Transoxiana to the aboriginal Iranian population there.



THE MOHAMMEDANS. 269
The diarist of Cli ang cli un's travels (see p. 70) notices in Central Asia a realm of the P^u-su-man, the ruler of which seems to have had his residence at Almalik. P'-u-su-man is evidently the same as Bussitrman of the ancient Eussian annals, by which name the Mohammedans are always to be understood (Karamzin, iv. 104). PL Carpini states (749, 7 50): " De terra Cangitarum (Kankalis) intravimus terram Biscrminorum. Isti homines linguam Comanicam (Kipchak) loquebantur, et adhuc loquuntur ; sed legem Sarracenorum teuent/' &c. But generally P. Carpini terms the Mohammedans Sar
racens, as do also Eubruck and M. Polo. I may quote a statement from the Yuan ch'ao pi shi pointing to the fact that even before the rise of Chinghiz Mohammedan merchants carried on trade with the nomad tribes in the most eastern part of Mongolia. "VYe read there : " When Chinghiz was encamping on the ILokQ Baldjuna (in 1203),^^^ a Sartatai {i.e., a native of the country of the Sarts, a Mohammedan) by name Asan (Hassan), arrived from Alahitshi digit huri of the tribe Wangut. He had taken along with him a thousand sheep and a white camel, for his passage down the river
Ergunie^^^ to barter for sable and squirrel furs. When he stopped at the lake he met with Chinghiz." The conquest of Chinghiz and his successors had opened a highway of communication between the east and west of Asia ; and western people began to frequent
the far east, and even to settle there. The Mongol emperors patronised the colonisation of China by foreigners ; and with respect to the Mohammedans, it seems that
655 Tj^g Mohammedan authors also mention Chinghiz encamping there, but they speak of a river Baldjuna (d'Ohsson, i. 72). The Baldjuna lake, from which the Tura river takes rise, lies south of Chita, in Transbaikalia. Alakush tiJcin Jcuri of Rashid, chief of the Ongut tribe (d'Ohsson,

270 THE MOHAMMEDANS.
since Hulagu, the brother of Mangu Khan, ruled over Western Asia, emigration from Persia to China had considerably increased. I think it not unlikely that the Mohammedans now scattered over the whole of China proper, and forming large communities, especially in the provinces of Kansu, Shansi, and Chili, are for the greater part descendants of those Saracens mentioned by M. Polo in the same provinces. Eashid-eddin states in his description of China (Yule's " Cathay," 269) that in his time all the inhabitants of Karadjang (Yunnan) were Mohammedans ; and I feel tolerably certain also that the Mohammedans of Yunnan, called Panthays by the Burmese, and who in 1857 captured Ta li fu from the Chinese, and maintained their power in this province till 1873, may be traced back to the time of the Mongol emperors. The Yiian shi gives many biographies of distinguished Mohammedans in the service of the Mongols. A number of them occupied high offices. I may quote the names of the Hui-ho met with in the history of the Mongols,
and notice occasionally some particulars from their bio
graphies. In chap. cxxv. we find the biography of Sai-dien-ch i
shan-sze-ding, called also Wu-ma-rh. He was a Hiii-hu and a descendant of the Bie-an-ho-rh.^^^ In his country Sai-dien-cJi i means " noble family." He has a long biography, from which we learn that he submitted to Chinghiz when the latter waged war in Western Asia, and entered his life-guard. Under Ogotai and Mangu Khans he was governor and held other offices. Khubilai Khan appointed him minister. He died in Yunnan, where he had
been governor. He left five sons, viz., Na-su-la-ding (ISTasr-uddin), Hasan (Hassan), Hu-sin (Hussein), Shansn-ding wu-mo-li, and Ma-su-hu (Mas'ud). All these
held hisjh offices. Na-su-la-ding has a separate biography in the same

THE MOHAMMEDANS. 271
chapter. He was governor of the province of Yunnan, and distinguished himself in the war against the southern tribes of Kiao-cM (Cochin-China) and Mien (Burma). He died in 1292, the father of twelve sons, the names of five of which are given in the biography, viz., Bo-ym-cli a-rli^^'^ who held a high office, Wu-ma-rh (Omar), Djc-fa-rh (Djafar), Ru-sien (Hussein), and SJia-di (Saadi). The Sai-dien-cJi i of the Yuan shi is without doubt the same personage spoken of by Eashid (d'Ohsson, ii. 467) under the name of Sayid-Edjell. According to the Persian historian, he was a native of Bokhara and governor of Karadjang (Yunnan) when Kubilai, in the reign of Mangu, entered the country. Subsequently he was appointed vizier, and in the beginning of Kubilai's reign he had charge of the finances. His son, Nasr-uddin, was appointed governor in Karadjang, and retained his position in Yunnan till his death, which Eashid, writing about A.D. 1300, says occurred five or six years before (according to the Ytian shi, Na-sit-la-ding + in 1292). His son, Abic-heJvT, who had the surname Bayan Fenchan (evidently the Bo-yen-cTi a-rh of the Yiian shi), was governor in Zaitun at the time Eashid wrote. He bore also his grandfather's title of Sayid Edjell, and was mini
ster of the finances under Kubilai's successor (d'Ohsson, ii. 476, 507, 508). Nasr-uddin is mentioned by M. Polo, who styles him Nescradin (ii. 84). In chap, cxxiii. of the Yuan shi we find the biography of A-la-iva-rh-sze, who is stated there to have been a ffui-ho and a native of Ba-wa-rh (Baurd in Khorassan). He was commander of a thousand in his own country. When Chinghiz arrived at Ba-wa-rh, A-la-wa-rh-sze surrendered and entered the Mongol army. His son,
This Bo-yen is not to be confounded with the eminent general of the same name, who was a Mongol, and who is mentioned as Bayan Chincsan by M. Polo (ii. 128). The biography of this valiant captain is found in the Yiian shi, chap, cxxvii. It is quite in accordance with the biographical notices Rashid gives of the same personage. He calls him Bayan (Berezin, i. 196).



272 THE MOHAMMEDANS.
A-la-wu-ding (Alai-uddin), was a valiant warrior in Kubilai's army. He died in 1292, at the age of a hundred and two. His son, Djan-sze-ding, had five sons, namely, Wit-ma-rh, A-san-bu-bie, Hin-djo-lan-cha, A-Jiama (Ahmed), and O-tu-man (Othman). Other Hui-ho or Mohammedans, whose biographies have been incorporated in the Yiian shi, have the following names :

Chap. 134. San-ghi-sze. —Chap. 194. Na-su-la-ding
(Nasr-uddin), son of Ma-Jw-mu (Mahmud).—Chap. 196. Tie-li-mi-sJii. Chap. 205. A-ho-ma (Ahmed). His biography is placed in the Yiian shi under the rubric "Yillanous Ministers." This is the " certain Saracen Achmath " to whom M. Polo has devoted a chapter entitled " Oppres
sions of Achmath " (i. 401). Another Mohammedan who held high offices in China under Cliinghiz and his successors was Mahmud Yelvadj. His son, 3fas\cdj was governor of Turkestan. Both are spoken of by the Persian authors, as well as in the Yuan
shi (vide supra^ p. 1 1). The annals of the Yiian shi further mention a Mohammedan named Ao-du-la ha-man, to whom Ogotai Khan had leased on rent all the revenues of his empire. He is stated there to have caused indirectly the death of Ogotai by making him a present of wine. The khan, who was given to drinking, found it so delicious, that he drank till midnight, and the next morning expired, in December 1241 (Yiian shi, sm6 anno). D'Ohsson calls this man Ahdior Rahman (ii. 1 89). It seems he quotes the name from the Persian authors. In the biographies of the following distinguished men,
the Si yil (vide supra, p. 267) is given as their native country. Evidently Persia is meant. Chap. 120. Dja-ba-rh huo-djo, a valiant companion in arms of Chinghiz. He was a native of Sai-yi (perhaps
Seyistan), which country (or tribe) is said there to be in

the Si yil. He was the chief of this tribe, wherefore he bore the name Huo-djo, which in their language is the
name of an office.^^^ He was of a tall figure, had a
splendid beard, large eyes, and a broad forehead. He was brave, and a skilful archer and rider. Chinghiz
accidentally seeing this man in his army, was surprised at his appearance and became interested in him. This must have happened at an early period of Chinghiz' career, for Dja-ba-rh is stated to have been with the conqueror when he waged war with Wang han (Ong Khan of the Kerait tribe) in 1203. Thus it seems that Mohammedans served in the Mongol army even before the rise of Chinghiz. This biography states also that Dja-ba-rh had been entrusted by Chinghiz with a mission to the famous Taoist monk Kiu CKang cJiim, who lived among the mountains of K\on lun^^^ Cli ang ch'un asked Djabar which he would prefer, honours and splendour, or a numerous posterity. Djabar then answered, " After a hundred years riches and splendour will be of no value to me ; but I should wish my sons and grandsons to be prosperous and to continue my lineage." Ch'ang ch'un said, " Your wish shall be realised." And indeed it was
so. Djabar died at the age of a hundred and eighteen, and left a numerous posterity. Several of his descendants are mentioned in his biography.

employed at the siege of Siang-yang-fu.*^^^
The biography of Ismael's son I-lio-di-ya-rh-ding is found in chapter cxxxvii. In chapter xlviii., on astronomy, mention is made ol Dja-ma-Ia-ding, a Persian astronomer, who in 1267 presented to Kubilai seven Persian astronomical instru
ments, of which a brief description is given. They are enumerated by their Persian names. He is said to have also presented a new scheme of chronography.^^^ The historians of the Ming period always term the Mohammedans Hui-hui ; and, as has been stated above, this is the name also by which all professors of Islam in China proper, as well as in Central and Western Asia, are known to the Chinese in our days.

NOTICES OF THE WARLIKE EXPEDITIONS OF THE MONGOLS TO THE WEST.
The material wliicli hitherto has been worked up by our historians dealing with the conquest of Western Asia and Eastern Europe by the Mongols was almost exclusively derived from Western, and principally Persian
sources. It is only in a few cases that d'Ohsson, in his
" Histoire des Mongols," quotes with respect to these events Father Hyacinth's above-mentioned translation of the first three chapters of the Yiian shi, where the doings of the Mongols are recorded down to the year 1260. It is not to be wondered at when d'Ohsson, although he possessed a knowledge of the Eussian language, has not
been able to find in this translation corroborations of the Persian records, the former being made from a corrupted
edition of the Ylian shi, as I have stated above. I can also understand when d'Ohsson says with respect to the Si shi ki (see Part I., No. 4), of which he had seen
Eemusat's translation : " Get itineraire n'a rien ajoute a nos connaissances." A correct translation of this ancient narrative and a translation of an uncorrupted edition of the Yiian shi would have furnished him with many
arguments for his historical researches. I am, however, far from assigning to the Ghinese and Mongol historical accounts a high historical value. These fragmentary and aphoristic notices can often be understood only when comparing them with the more detailed Western records. But it is needless to say that every ancient historical
document is calculated to add some new light, all the

more when bearing upon a subject repeatedly ventilated by European savants. Proceeding from this point of view, I shall present in
this part of my researches, comparative notices of western and eastern accounts with respect to the Mongol invasions of the countries of the west. I omit the review of Hulagu's expeditions to Persia, Syria, &c., 1258—60, for this subject has already been treated of in the previous
part (p. 112 seqq.).
I. CHINGHIZ KHAN'S EXPEDITION TO WESTERN ASIA,
A.D. 1219-25.
I begin with a sketch of the records of Mohammedan authors regarding the first invasion of Western Asia by the Mongols, my notes being an abstract from d'Ohsson's work (I., chap. 7), to which I shall add my remarks. Mohammed Khorazm Shah, on his return from an expedition to Irak Adjem in 1218, received at Bokhara some envoys from . Chinghiz, who were, however, all sub
jects of the Shah,—it seems Mohammedan merchants returning from Mongolia. They brought presents and a peaceful message, with a proposal of the Mongol khan to establish rei^ular commercial intercourse between Mongolia and the dominions of the Shah. Mohammed apparently received them with cordiality, but felt that it would be to his prejudice to form an alliance with Chinghiz acknowledging his supremacy. After this, Chinghiz despatched a caravan consisting of 400 merchants, all Mohammedans, to Khorazm, who were also entrusted with diplomatic messages. But when they arrived at Otrar they were plundered and put to death by order of the governor of that place, by name Inaldjuk Ga'ir Khan ; and this was the origin of the war. Be
^ As to the number of merchants sent on this occasion to Khorazm and killed in Otrar, the Mohammedan authors do not agree in their statements.



CHINGHIZ-PERSIA, I2ig-2S. 277
fore beo-inniiio- hostilities, Cliinohiz sent a Turk named Bagra, accompanied by two Mongol officers, to ask satisfaction for these outrages ; but Bagra was executed by order of Mohammed, and the two Mongol officers were sent back after being shaved. Some time subsequently, Mohammed began hostilities by attacking a body of Mongols who had pursued the Merkits to the territories of the Kankali. This battle took place north of the city of Djcnd on the Lower Sihun. It must be remembered that after the destruction of the empire of the Kara Khitai (Guchluk), the dominions of Chinghiz were conterminous with those of Khorazm Shah. Towards the end of 12 18 Chinghiz left his ordo, entrusting his younger brother Udjughen with the government of his states (see note 102). The Mongol army spent the whole summer of 12 19 on the river Irtysh in order to equip anew and to complete the cavalry. Chinghiz was joined there by the prince of the Uigurs (Bardjuk), by Signak TeJdn, prince of Almalik, and by Arslan, khan of the Karluks. The army marched out in autumn, and no resistance was opposed to the Mongol arms until the Sihun (laxartes) had been reached. ^'^^ When the army had arrived at Otrar (end of 1219 it seems) it was divided into four corps, the first of which, commanded by Chinghiz' sons Ogotai and Chagatai, invested Otrar. The second, under the command of Chin
ghiz' eldest son, Djuclii, was directed to the right against the city of Djend. The third corps, conducted by the Mongol generals Alak, Sugtu, and Togai, marched up the
Some assert that there were only four. Ye-lii Ch'ii ts'ai (see Part I., p. 20), who ill his narrative speaks of the catastrophe of Otrar, states that several envoys of Chinghiz and several hundreds of merchants had been murdered. The Yiian ch'ao pi shi says, with respect to the same event, " The Sartol had killed Chinghiz Khan's envoy Wuhun, and put to death a hundred men in all, 665 rj^YiQ Mohammedan authors give no details regarding the march of Chinghiz from the Irtysh to the Sihun. The itinerary of Chinghiz' army through Central Asia is found in Ye-lli Ch'u tsai's itinerary (p, 13 seqq.).



278 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
Sihun to BenaJcet (or FenaJcet). Chinghiz himself with the main army advanced upon Bokhara. After a five months' siege, Otrar was captured and pillaged ; its governor, Gair Khan, was taken prisoner and afterwards put to death by having melted silver poured
into his ears and eyes. Djuchi on his way towards Djend arrived at Signah. The city was captured after being stormed for seven days. Ozkendj Barklialighkend, and Esliiiass suffered the same fate. Djuchi then marched against Djend, which was also stormed. One division was despatched to take Yenghikend. All these cities were situated on the Sihon, the last at a distance of two days' journey from the lake of Kliorazm (Aral). The Uigur troops, numbering 10,000 men, were then allowed to return home,^^^ and were replaced by 10,000 men, Turkmans. The left flank of the Mongol army was also successful in its operations. Bcnaket, which was garrisoned by Turk-Kanhalis, surrendered. The Mongols then attacked Khodjend, whose governor was the valiant Timur-melik. Being constrained to abandon Khodjend, he retired with a thousand men to a castle on an is i and in the Sihon, where he held out for a long time. But having lost the
greater part of his troops, he was at length forced to flee, and succeeded in reaching Khorazm, where he joined Bjelal-eddin^ the son of Mohammed Shah, from whom he did not separate until the death of that prince. Meanwhile Chinghiz, accompanied by his son Ttdui, had advanced into Transoxiana, and in March of 1220 appeared at Bokhara^^'^ which was then a large and
In the Yiian shi, biography of the Uigur prince Bardju {v. supra, p. 250), it is stated that he assisted at the storming of Nishapur. In the article on the Uigurs {v. supra, p. 261) Eashid likewise testifies that this prince, after the capture of Otrar, did not return home, but remained in the suite of Chinghiz. ^^'^ This is the first date the Mohammedan authors give after the starting from the Irtysh. The military events above related must have taken place in the beginning of the year 1220



CHINGHIZ—PERSIA, i2ig-2S. 279
magnificent city. After several days' siege, tlie garrison
tried to force its way tlirougii the Mongol lines, but was almost destroyed. The city surrendered, but the citadel held out twelve days. Chinghiz next advanced along the fertile valley of the Bogd (Zarafshan river) towards Samarlvand, which was tlien garrisoned by 40,000 men, most of whom were Kankalis. Samarkand surrendered in April 1220, when the greater part of the inhabitants were slaughtered. Whilst the Mongols devastated Transoxiana, Mohammed Shah behaved with the greatest indifference. He was at Samarkand when the enemy entered Transoxiana, and then fled to Nakhsheb. He was at first disposed to repair to Ghazna ; but when he had reached Balkli, he
was persuaded by one of his viziers to retreat to Irak Adjem. On the 1 8th of April he halted at Nisliabur,
but after a rest of three weeks was obliged to start again, being informed of the approach of the Mongols through Khorassan. He then took the road to Kasvin, where his son, Bohi-cdclin, was said to have rallied about 30,000
troops.
When sojourning at Samarkand, Chinghiz had sent two corps in pursuit of Mohammed, under the command of Chebe (see note 592) and Sichutai Baliadur^^^ They crossed the Djihun (Oxus, Amu) at Pendjab, and advanced into Khorassan. Chebe took the way through Nisliabur to Mazanderan, whilst Subutai proceeded through the Kumuss to Irak Adjem, passing through Kabuslian, Tus, Esferain, Damegan, and Simnan. Both corps met at Bayi (near the present Teheran). Mohammed, trying to flee to Bagdad, was near being taken by the Mongols ; but he succeeded in escaping,
I shall speak more fully of this valiant Mongol general (see note 689). Bahadur is an honorific title, meaning "brave " in Turkish (d'Ohsson, i. 35). The Russian bogatyr, a valiant man, a champion, seems to have the same origin. This is probably the same root as the Manchu honorific title ha turn, meaning brave, now conferred as a military distinction. In the Yiian shi the above term is generally rendered by ha-du-rli.



28o MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
and retired through the mountainous country of Ghilan to Mazanderan. The Mongols, however, were already masters of that country, and Amol and Asterahad had been sacked. Mohammed arrived in Mazanderan almost alone, and hid himself for some days in a village on the shore of the Caspian, till his asylum was betrayed, when he fled to a small island in the Sea of Ahsukun,^^^ where he subsequently died of an attack of pleurisy. Turkan Kliatiin, the mother of Mohammed, had at that time left Kiirhandj, the capital of Khorazm, and hid
herself with the princesses in the castle of Hal, among the mountains of Mazanderan ; but she was discovered, and obliged to surrender. After the fall of Samarkand, Chinghiz encamped with his army in the country between this city and Nakhsheb (Karshi), and spent the whole summer of 1220 there. In autumn the military operations recommenced. One army, commanded by Djuchi, Ogotai, and Chagatai, was sent against Kurkandj or Urghendj, the capital of Khorazm, which at that time had no ruler ; for owing to a revolt of the troops, Djelal-eddin had been constrained to leave, and had fled to GJiazna. Timur-melik was with him. Tului, the fourth son of Chinghiz, received orders to devastate Khorassan, whilst Chinghiz himself directed the main army to the south, beginning this expedition with the siege of Termed, situated on the north bank of the Djilmn, which w^as captured after ten days' storming. Chinghiz then wintered (i 220— 2 i) in the district of Seman, whence Badakhslian was invaded. In the spring of 1221, Chinghiz crossed the Djihun with his army. The city of Balkh surrendered ; but being afraid to leave it, Chinghiz slaughtered the inhabi

See Abulfeda, i. 77 ; II. ii. 180. ^"^^ Compare Ye-lii Ch'u ts'ai about Turkan Khatun (Part I., p. 22).

tants cand destroyed the city. Hence he advanced upon the fortress of Niissrethuli, situated in the mountainous country of Talckan. This place had been ineftectually besieged by one of his generals for six months, but was
captured when Chinghiz' army arrived. Meanwhile Tului, executing the orders of his father, had invaded Khorassan, and sent his brother-in-law, Togachar, with the avant-guard to Nessa. After sacking this place, Togachar advanced upon Nislictbur, in ISTovember 1220, but was killed on the third day of the siege. Tului directed his main army, numbering 70,000 men, upon Mcru-Skahidjan, which was captured in February 1221, and then marched upon Nislictbur. The latter place was taken by assault ; the destruction of the city occupied fifteen days, April 1221. Thence Tului pursued his way to Herat (more generally styled Heri in the Middle Ages). A detachment of his forces destroyed the tomb of the Calif Harun al Eashid, near the city of Tus, and the country of Kuliistan, through which Tului's way lay, was laid waste. The Mongols arrived at Herat, and after eight days' attack and the death of its governor,
the city offered to capitulate. On the capture of this
place, Tului joined his father in Talekan. At that time Urghendj had also been taken by the
other sons of Chins^hiz, after a siecre of more than six months. The capture of the place had been partly retarded owing to a disagreement which had arisen between Djuchi and Chagatai. When Chinghiz heard of this quarrel he grew very angry, and ordered Ogotai to take the command. After the fall of Urghendj, Ogotai and Chagatai both came to join their father. Only Djuchi remained in the country north of the Sihun. Chinghiz, after spending the summer of 1221 among the mountains surrounding Talekan, recommenced the operations and advanced towards Ghazna, where Djelaleddin had rallied considerable forces. The Mongols were
detained a whole month by the siege of the fortress of



282 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
Kerduan. When the place had surrendered, Chinghiz crossed the Hindukush and attacked Bamian. There one of his favourite grandsons was killed ; and to avenge his death he ordered the city to be destroyed and the
whole district to be made a desert. The Mongol general Shihi Kutuku had been posted with a corps of observation on the mountainous frontiers
of Kctbul and Zabelstan, to cover the operations of Chinghiz. This corps was defeated by Djelal-eddin in the plain of Beruan ; but the latter was not able to profit by his victory, being abandoned by a part of his
troops. He therefore determined to retreat towards the river Sind. He was pursued rapidly by Chinghiz, who arrived at Ghazna fifteen days after the sultan had left it. Djelal-eddin had not yet crossed the river when the
Mongols arrived. A desperate battle was fought, in
which the sultan's troops were defeated. He jumped into the river with his horse and swam across it. This happened in December 1221. Some time after, Djelaleddin was said again to rally some forces beyond the Sind. In the spring of 1222, Chinghiz sent his two generals, Bela and Turtai, in pursuit of the sultan, who retired towards Delhi. They proceeded to invest Midtan ; but as it held out bravely and they were afraid of the
terrible heat there, they retired again to Ghazna, after ravaging the provinces of Multan, Lahore, Peshawur, and Melikpur. On the defeat of Djelal-eddin, Chinghiz sent Ogotai to destroy Ghazna, and the general Ilchikadai received
orders to punish Herat, which had revolted. After a siege of six months, Herat was taken on the 14th of June 1222, and destroyed. Besides this, Meru was plundered for the second time. Ogotai, after destroying Ghazna, asked permission to attack the city of Sistan
;
but Chinghiz objected, owing to the excessive heat, and
recalled his son. Chinghiz spent the summer of 1222 in the plain of



CHINGHIZ-PERSIA, i2ig~23. 283
Benian witli liis troops, and when Bela and Turtai returned from India, the whole army set out again. Ogotai joined the main army with his corps near the fort Guncain hiirgan. The Mongols wintered in the mountainous
country of Buya-ketiver, about the sources of the Sind. In the spring of 1223, Chinghiz determined to return home to Mongolia by way of India and Ttibet The army indeed moved out in that direction, but
was obliged to return to Peshaiviir, owing to the great difficulties the routes presented. Having crossed the mountains of Bamian, the conqueror passed the summer of 1223 in the district of Bakalan, where he had left the heavy baggage. In the autumn he started again ; and on passing Balkh, ordered the extermination of the population, who in the meanwhile had reoccupied the ruins. He then crossed the DjiJiun and advanced to Bokhara. The winter of 1223-24 was spent near Samarkand. In the spring of 1224 the army marched out again. On the river Sihun, Chinghiz was joined by his sons Ogotai and Chagatai, who had been engaged in hunting near Bokhara. In the summer of 1224 he encamped in the district of Kalan taslii, and passed his time in hunting excursions. In February 1225 Chinghiz reached his
ordo in Mongolia.^^"^
In note 217 I identified this name with Parwan, which now-a-days is the name of a defile, a river, and a little town in the Hindukush, north of Kabul. But this identification is not free from doubt ; for the Mohammedan authors state that the plain of Beruan or Peruan was in the vicinity of the district of Bamian (d'Ohsson, i. 300, 301, 305, 317). Howorth ("Mongols," i. 89) states, I am not aware on what authority, that it was one day's march from Ghazna. Erom one passage in d'Ohsson, i. 305, one might indeed suppose that Chinghiz on his way from Bamian to Ghazna, passed by Parwan, It is not without interest that we compare these records of the Persian historians regarding Chinghiz' expedition to Western Asia with the *S't yu hi, or narrative of Ch'ang ch'un's journey to the conqueror, who was then somewhere in the Hindukush mountains. The diarist of this journey wrote as an eye-witness, and his dates receive a stamp of authenticity from the fact, that the date he gives for the occurrence of a total solar eclipse

Let us turn now to the Chinese and Mongol records concerning the events related in the foregoing pages. In the annals of the Yiian shi we read suh anno 1 2 1 9 : In summer, in the sixth month (of the preceding year) the envoys of the emperor had been killed in the Si yil (Western Asia), and the emperor determined to lead an army in person against these countries. He captured

It may be said that all the details in the narrative vi^ith respect to Chinghiz and the war in the west agree well with the statements of the Persian authors on the subject, with the exception that, according to tlie latter, Chinghiz sojourned a year longer in Western Asia than the Chinese narrative will admit. I shall point out this discrepancy. With respect to the date of Chinghiz' starting from Mongolia, both the Si yu ki and Rashid agree. The latter states that the Mongol army, having passed the whole summer of 1219 on the Irtysh river, moved out in the autumn of the same year. In the Si yu ki we read that in the fifth month of 1219 Chinghiz was in the country of the Naimans, who, as is known, dwelt on the Upper Irtysh. In April 1220, when Ch'ang ch'un arrived at Peking, he was informed that Chinghiz had left for the west on the 29th October 1 22 1. Ch'ang ch'un met, in Western Turkestan, the envoy of the Kin, returning from Chinghiz' encampment, who had seen the latter, end of July, and who reported that he was pursuing the Sultan to India. According to Rashid, Chinghiz spent the summer of 1 221 among tlie mountains of Talekan (northern spurs of the Hindukush), and did not arrive at Bamian, it seems, till autumn. In December 1 22 1 Djelal-eddin was defeated on the river Sind. Ch'ang ch'un, after his arrival at Samarkand, December 3, I22I, went twice to the encampment of Chinghiz. The first time he started from Samarkand on April 26, 1222, crossed the Oxus on May loth, saw the emperor on the i6th, and went with him to pass the summer in the snowy mountains. According to Kashid, Chinghiz was at that time in the plain of Beruan in the Hindukush. In June Ch'ang ch'un returned to Samarkand ; he set out for the second time on September 14th, and arrived in fourteen days at the encampment of the emperor, which seems then to have been at a distance of only three days journey from the Oxus (i.e., south of the river) ; for according to the Si yu ki the emperor subsequently set out for the north on October 3d and crossed the Amu on the 6th. Ch'ang ch'un accompanied Chinghiz on his way to Samarkand, where they arrived in November 1222. Chinghiz' encampment was 30 li east of the city. In March 1223 Ch'ang ch'un was with the emperor (m their homeward journey, east of the Sihun, it seems, near Tashkend, when the latter was hunting in the eastern mountains ; and on the 9th the emperor remarked to the sage : " In three or four days my sons will arrive." All the events here reported from the Chinese narrative are corroborated by Rashid ; only there is a discrepancy of just a year between the dates in the two accounts. As I have stated above, according to Rashid it was

was captured. Ibidem, s, a. 1221 : In the spring the emperor besieged

not till the spring of 1223 that Chinghiz determined to return home ; he spent the winter of 1223-24 near Samarkand. In the summer of 1224, having crossed the Sihun, he was hunting in the district of Kalan tashi, which answers, it seems, to Tashkend. I think the Chinese narrative gives the correct dates, and the Persian author has been mistaken in retaining Chinghiz a year longer in Western Asia. ^3 Here evidently Jnaldjuk Ga'ir Klian {v. supra, p. 276) is meant. According to the Persian authors, Chinghiz encamped in the summer of 1220 between Samarkand and Nakhsheb. ^''^ The Chinese historians who compiled the Yiian shi from official documents have been misled by the different spellings of the names of the same cities in different reports ; for 0-t'a-la and Wo-t'a-la-rli both are intended for Ortar ; Bu-hua and Bu-ha-rh both for Bokhara ; Siin-sz -kan and Sie-mi-szc-kan both for Samarkand. Thus they report the capture of the cities of Ortar, Bokhara, and Samarkand twice under different years. Owing to this mistake some chronological confusion has crept into the Yiian shi with, respect to the first Mongol expedition to Western Asia. The events, however, are recorded there with tolerable correctness. The last two names answer, it seems, to Yanghikand and BarklialigJcand of the Persian authors [v. supra, p. 278). The ruins of the first still exist, south-west of Eort Kazalinsk, at a distance of about two English miles from the left border of the Syr-daria, and about one day's journey from the mouth of the river. See Lerch's interesting investigations regarding the ancient cities of the Lower Sihun in his " Archaeol. Journey to Turkestan " in 1867. Yanghikand is first mentioned by Ibn Haukal and Mas'udi in the tenth century. See also Abulfeda, 11. ii. 216. We read in PI. Carpini's narrative (747, 750)5 "De terra Cangitarum (Kankly) intravimus terram Biserminorum (Mohammedan Turks in Central Asia). ... In hac terra invenimus urbes innumeras subversas, et castella diruta, et villas multas desertas.

Some believe that Otrar was meant, and others identify it with Urghendj. Lerch thinks that by Ornas Carpini intended Fshnass {v. supra, p. 278). I may observe that the ancient city of Yanghikand, near the mouth of the Sihun, is not to be confounded with a city noticed in the " Memoirs of Sultan Baber " (beginning of the sixteenth century) under the name of Yanghi or Taraz Icand (Taras), north of Ferghana, in Turkestan. The same is also mentioned 360 li east of Sairam in the Chinese history of the Ming in the fifteenth century. About this defile see note 211. ^"^ It does not seem that here the envoy Wu Tcu sun is meant (see Part I.

In the biography of Su-bu-t' ai^^^ Yiian shi, chap, cxxi., some particulars are found regarding the pursuit of Mohammed Shah of Khorazm, with which, according to the Persian authors, the generals Chebe noyen and Subutai hahadiir had been entrusted.

Bela of the Persian authors [see p. 282), This was the name of one of the most distinguished generals in the Mongol army. He is repeatedly mentioned by the Persian authors as well as in the Yiian shi, and his name is met with even in the ancient Russian annals, Rashid, treating of the Uriankhits, states that Suhutai belonged to that Mongol tribe (Berezin, i, 145). In the Yiian shi (chap, cxxi.) he has a long biography, in which all his exploits in China, Western Asia, Russia, and Hungary are recorded with some detail. I shall give successively in the proper places translations from his biography. The Yuan shi states that Su-bu-t'ai belonged to the Meng-gu (Mongol) tribe of the Wuliang-ha. His ancestors were hunting together with the ancestors of Chinghiz on the river Wa-nan (Onon). Su-bu-t'ai entered Chinghiz' army in the beginning of the thirteenth century. ^^'^ In the biography of the Uigur prince Ba-rh-dju [v. supra, p. 250) Mohammed Shah is termed Han Mie-li Su-tan (Khan Melik Sultan).

dans), the ruler of it, Mie~li, fled and abandoned his
throne. Then Su-bii-Vai and Dje-lie (see note 592) received orders to pursue him. They arrived at the river Hui-li, where Dje-bie attacked the enemy, but without success. Then Su-bu-t'ai made a great fire on the eastern bank of the river, to mislead the enemy with respect to the Mongol forces. Mie-li was struck with fear, and fled the same night. Su-bu-t'ai with a host of 10,000 men went in pursuit, passed Bu-han clitian^^^ and the city of Bi-li-han.^^^ He pursued Mie-li uninterruptedly day and night through countries destitute of water (the deserts of Khorassan). Finally, when he was
about to catch him, Mie-li fled to an island in the sea, where he died a month after. Su-bu-t'ai captured all
his treasures, precious stones, silver vessels, &c., and sent them to the emperor. . In the Yiian shi, annals, 1223, we read: In order to avoid the heat of the summer, the emperor moved to the valley Ba-lu-wan ; after which he was joined by the princes Dju-cJii, Cha-ho-t'ai, and Wo-Jcuo-fai, and the

When he subsequently had moved out and reached the fort of K'o-wen, he was joined by his generals. K'o-wen is probably the Gunaun Kurgan of the Persian authors {v. supra, p. 283) ; perhaps the Khewek pass in the Hindukush, mentioned by Sultan Baber. Daruga, Mongol governor.

In the Yuan cUao pi sJii we find a more detailed description of the military doings of Chinghiz in the west. The events, however, are not recorded there in chronological order, and there is some confusion also in its statements. I do not wish to trouble the reader with
a complete translation, and will therefore confine myself to quoting from this ancient Mongol record only such
passages as may present special interest. The year 12 19 is given also in the Yiian cliao pi shi as the date of Chinghiz' departure for the countries of the west, in accordance with the Persian authors and the Yiian shi. Chinghiz entrusted his brother Ocheghin,^^^ it is said there, with the government of the Mongol empire, and took with him his wife Hu-lan ; Dj'ehe having command of the avant-guard, and Suhutai of the rear. The following names of places are mentioned in connection with the first Mongol expedition to Western Asia :

took the cities of Isiepur (Nishabur), Chuhhchelien^^^ Ilii

;
but he was defeated by Djalalding, who pursued him near to the place where Chinghiz was encamped. The
latter then sent Djebie, Subietai, and Tohuchar against
Djalalding, who was beaten.''^^ He tried at first to escape towards Bickhar ; but not succeeding, he fled to the river Shin^^^ to which point he was pursued. Nearly all his troops were drowned in the river ; but Djalalding and Mielik escaped. Bala^ who was sent in pursuit, crossed the river Shin and proceeded to the country of Hindu. Not being able to find Djalalding, he captured a number of camels and sheep, and returned. Chinghiz then went up the river Shin, took the city of Batkesie, arrived at the rivers Ukie horohan and Geun horohan^^^ and pitched his camp at Baruan keher^^^
700 rpj^g Persian authors notice the quarrel of Djuchi and Chagatai, interfering with the progress of the siege of Urghendj. Chinghiz appointed his younger son Ogotai to superintend the siege.

According to the Yiian cli ao pi slii, Chingiiiz spent one summer, it is not clear in what year, in the mountains Altan liorhuan, where the king of the Mohammedans ^Yas accustomed to encamp. Tinally, we read in the same Mongol annals that Chinghiz, in the seventh year after he left Mongolia, in the autumn of 1225, returned to his principal encamping-place Karatmij^'^ on the river Tula?^
The accounts given in the Tsiii clieng lu of Chinghiz' conquest of Western Asia are remarkable for their strong
accordance with Eashid's records. There is only a difference in the dates, the Ts'in cheng lu being a year in advance. I shall present a complete translation of these accounts. In the year 1 2 1 9 Chinghiz moved out at the head of a great host to subjugate the western countries. He spent the summer of 1220 on the river Yerdishi (Irtysh). In the autumn he started again, and captured all the cities on his way. Thus the army arrived at 0-to-la-rh (Otrar).
Chinghiz left his second and third sons to invest this place, which was soon taken by assault, and in 1 2 2
1
marched himself with his fourth son upon Bu-ha-rh (Bokhara). This city was captured, and also Sie-mi-szhan (Samarkand). Chinghiz' eldest son captured the cities of Yang-glii-han (Yanghikand), Ba-rh-djin, and others (see note 676). Chinghiz spent the summer in the summer residence of the su-wan-tan (sultan) of the Siyil (Western Asia).^^^ Subsequently he ordered Hu-tii
^'^^ The Chinese text of the Yiian ch'ao pi shi renders Karatun by Hei lin (black forest) ; and in the Yiian shi, Hei lin is also frequently mentioned as a favourite encamping-place of Chinghiz. Rashid terms the same place Karaun Jcabdjal, explaining that it means "black forest" (d'Ohsson, i, 73). Indeed Tcara in Mongol means " black," and oi (genitive oin) " forest ;
"
Jcabdjal = defile. ''"^ Now-a-days the Mongols pronounce the name of this river Tola. The city of Urga is situated on it. ''^^ According to Rashid, Chinghiz, after the capture of Samarkand, spent the summer in the country between this city and Nakhsheb (Karshi)

hu no-yen to take command of the avant-gnard.'^^*^ In the autumn of the same year he sent his eldest, second, and third sons with the right flank of the army to attack Yil-lung-kie-dji (Urghendj) and Bii-djin-ye-ha-da (?). Chinghiz' third son was entrusted with the chief command. The emperor himself with the main army marched upon the Iron-gate (see note 2 1 1), captured Tie-rli-mi (Termed), destroyed Ban-le-ho (Balkh), and then hesieged Ta-li-han (Talekan). In the winter the fourth prince took the cities of Ma-ln-dl a-ye-ll 0 (Maruchak), Wn-lu^^^ Si-la-sz (Serakhs), Ni-slia-w^L-rh (Nishabur), and Ye-li (Heri or Herat). In the spring of 1222 the fourth prince captured T\i-sz (Tus) and JVi-shet-wu-rhJ^^ At the beginning of the hot season he received orders to make haste to join his father ; but before doing so he made an incursion into the country of the Mu-la-di (see note 682), devastated it, crossed the river So-so-lan (see notes 683 and 701), and sacked Ye-li (Herat). When the fourth prince had joined the emperor, they attacked Ta-li-han in concert. Chinghiz' three eldest sons had at that time taken the city of Yu-lnng-hie-dji (Urghendj), and the eldest prince had arrived at his father's camp.'^^^ The second and third sons came only when the fortress had been destroyed. Meanwhile Bja-lan-ding, the su-li-fan of the Si yu^ had fled. Chinghiz had sent Bje-'bie^ who commanded

''11 This name is probably misspelt for Ma-lu, Meru or Merv. The name of Nishabur occurs here for the second time. Indeed, according to the Persian authors, this place was tv/ice sacked. According to the Persian authors, Djuchi, the eldest son of Chinghiz, after the quarrel with his brother (see note 700), did not join his father. He died in 1225 without having seen Chinghiz. The Yiian ch'ao pi shi, however, states, in accordance with the Ts'in cheng lu, that after the fall of Urghendj, Djuchi, Chagatai,and Ogotai repaired to the camp of their father.

In the spring of 1223 Chinghiz moved out with his army and proceeded northward, following the course of the Sin-tze su. (Here is a break in the MS.) The third prince reached the city of Bu-si-sze-dan^^^ and asked permission of Chinghiz to attack it, but the emperor recalled his son in view of the hot season commencing. He spent the summer with his troops on the liver Ba-lu-wan (Beruan), and defeated the enemy in the
adjacent countries. After the arrival of the corps of Ba-la, the army moved to the west, and when they had reached the fort of Ke-un (see note 694), the third prince also arrived. When Chinghiz had captured the western
countries he placed a da-lu-hua-cli i in every city.

In the year 1224 Chinghiz started on his homeward route, and in the spring of 1225 reached his native land, after an absence of seven years.
2. EXPEDITION OF THE MONGOL GENERALS SUBUTAI
AND CHEBE TO WESTERN PERSIA AND THE
REGIONS OF THE CAUCASUS, a.d. 1220-24.
I may again commence with the records of the Mohammedan authors (d'Ohsson, i. 324, 444 seqq.). We have seen that in 1220 Chinghiz had sent out two corps under the command of Subutai and Chebe in pursuit of Mohammed Shah. They ravaged Irak Adjem and Mazanderan, and after the miserable end of Mohammed they continued to carry fire and slaughter over Persia. The cities of Hayi, Kum, Hamadan, Kazvin^ and Zendjan were sacked. The two generals then advanced on Tehriz, the capital of Azerhaidjan, which province was ruled by the Atabeg Uuzheg, a Turkish prince. He bought off the Mongols by rich presents, who then evacuated Azerbaidjan and wintered in the plain of Mogan, on the shore of the Caspian Sea. In the beginning of the year 1221 they advanced into Georgia nearly as far as Tiflis^ and defeated the Georgian army. After this they returned to Tehriz, levied a second contribution upon that city, and then attacked Meraga. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Hamadan had killed the Mongol governor placed there ; whereupon the Mongol army proceeded to that city, which was taken and destroyed. Eeturning to the north, the Mongols captured Erdebil, and appeared for the third time at Tebriz. Euzbeg fled to Nakhshevan, and Tebriz again paid ransom. After this the Mongol host was directed against Georgia, and an army of 30,000 Georgians was destroyed. Having ravaged the latter country, the Mongols turned upon Shirvan, and captured its capital, Shamahha. Kashid Shah of Shirvan had taken refuge in the citadel of Derlend. The



SUBUTAI—PERSIA, RUSSIA, 1220-24. 295
Mongols had no difficulty in taking the city, but could not capture its citadel. As they intended to cross the Caucasus, they were in need of good leaders ; and by means of cunning and force they obliged the envoys of Kashid to ouide them across the mountains. On the other side of the Caucasus they found the Alans
or Ases, the Lezghis, the Circassians, and the Kipchaks leagued together against them. A battle was fought, but the victory remained undecided. The Mongols then had recourse to craft, and persuaded the Kipchaks to desert their allies, who were attacked and vanquished. After this the city of Terhi was sacked, and the Mongols invaded the land of the Kipchaks, who dispersed without
offering any resistance. A great number of them fled to the Eussians, and the Mongols took possession of their
country, consisting of vast steppes, and advanced as far as the rich city of Sudak^^^ which was subject to the Kipchaks. In 1223 the Mongols undertook an expedition against the Bitssians, who had made a league with the Kipchaks. Their united forces marched out to meet the enemy before they had entered the Eussian territories. The Mongols employed their usual stratagem ; they first retreated, and after being followed twelve days by the Eussians and Kipchaks, lay in ambush, and suddenly rushed out upon the enemy. A battle was fought with great slaughter, which continued several days ; finally, the Mongols got the victory, the Eussians and Kipchaks being utterly defeated."^-^^ After that the Mongols entered Eussia, and carried fire and slaughter over the country. At the close of the year 1223 the Mongols evacuated Eussia and invaded the land of the Bulgars on the Kama
"^^^ Sudah or Solclaya, situated on the south-eastern coast of the Krimea and on the Khazarian Sea (Black Sea). It was in the Middle Ages an important Genoese entrepot. The author of the "Kamil ut Tevarikh," from which the above account is borrowed, means evidently the battle at the river Kalka (see farther on).



296 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
and Middle Volga. The forces sent by the latter to repulse the invaders were defeated. The Mongols then took the route by Saccasin to join the main army and Chinghiz. The Eussian annals (Karamzin, iii. 221 seqq.) give, of course, a more detailed account of the Mongol invasion of Eussia than the Mohammedan authors. Eussia was at
that time divided into several principalities, of which Suzdal ( Vladimir) was the most important, and whose Grand Duke to a certain degree was accepted as feudal lord by the rest. The residence of the Grand Duke was first in Kiev, but after 1 1 69 he dwelt in Vladimir. Amongst the Polovtsy (thus the Eussian annals term the Kipchaks) who had fled to Eussia there was a Prince Kotian (Kutan in the Hungarian annals), who persuaded his son-in-law,, the Prince Mstislav of Galich, of the necessity of taking measures against the Mongols. Mstislav then assembled the princes of Southern Eussia at Kiev, who agreed to make common cause with the Polovtsy against the Tatars (thus the Mongols are always styled in the Eussian annals). The princes of Kiev, Chernigov, Galich (all three
had the name Mstislav), and others assembled their forces on the Dnieper. There they received ten ambassadors from the Mongols. These ambassadors were put to death. After this the Eussian forces marched out, and first met the Tatars near the river Khortitsa (an affluent of the Dnieper, about fifty English miles south of Ekaterinoslav). Having gained the victory, the Eussians crossed the Dnieper and pursued the Mongols nine days to the river Kalka. Mstislav of Galich together with the Polovtsy ventured to attack the main body of the Mongols after crossing the river. But they were defeated, and then the Mongols rushed upon the remaining part of

Some of the Eussian princes who had been made prisoners were fastened to planks upon which the Mongols sat to perform a drinking
bout.
Chinese fragmentary accounts of the Mongol expedition under Subutai and Chebe are found in the Yiian shi in the biographies of two distinguished generals of Chinghiz. In the biography of Su-bu-t' ai, already quoted, we read (after the pursuit of Mohammed has been recorded) : Su-bu-t'ai asked the favour to be allowed to conquer the country of the Kin-clia (Kipchak). He conducted
his army round the sea K\ian-tien-glii-sz^'^'^ and arrived at the mountain T^ai Jiuo lingP^ through which an artificial road was cut. On the other side Su-bu-t'ai met
the chiefs (of the Kipchaks, it seems) Yil-li-ghi'^^'^ and

The Woznesensk annals give the i6th of June 1224 ; the annals of Novgorod, the 31st of May of the same year as the day when this battle took place. In other Russian annals the battle is recorded under the year 1223 (Karamzin, iii. 545). This latter date would agree with the year the Mohammedan authors allege for the first invasion of Russia by the Mongols. Mr. Kunik, the well-known inquirer into the history of Russia, thinks that 1223 is the correct date for this event ; but Bonnel in his "Chronologic Heinrichs des Letten," 1853, seems to prove that the battle at the Kalka river was fought in 1222. See "Melanges Asiat. de I'Acad. d. Sc. St. Petersbourg," ii. 462. The river Kalka (some Russian chroniclers write Kalak) is identified by Karamzin (iii. 232) with the river Kalets, an afHuent of the Kalmius, which discharges itself into the sea of Azov near Mariupol. ''-2 According to d'Herbelot's " Bibl. Orient.," the Turks called the Tpian ^ea dengliiz, which means "sea" {t'ien-ghi-sz' in the above name). The first character, K^uan, means " large " in Chinese, but it is more probable that it is intended here to represent a foreign sound. Kuan in the Uigur language, and probably also in other Turkish dialects, means "a lake." ''-^ Literally "the mountain range of great peace." This name evidently denotes the Caucasus.

story, said to Su-bu-t'ai, "We can scarcely expect fidelity from this man," and ordered him to be put to death. On the proposal of Su-bu-t'ai a special corps had been formed, consisting of Mie-li-Tii (Merkits), Nai-man, and Kin-clia (Kipchaks), who accompanied that general on his return home. He proceeded by the way of Yemi-li {Imil ; see note 313) and Ho-djiP'^ In the biography of Ho-sz-mai-li {vide supra, p. 233) the Mongol expedition to Western Persia and the countries near the Caucasus is also shortly recorded.

3. EXPEDITION OF THE MONGOLS TO THE COUNTRIES
NORTH OF THE CASPIAN SEA AND WEST OF
THE VOLGA, a.d. 1235-42.
In this chapter I shall review the invasion of the countries of the Ki'pcliaks, the Asi^ and the Bulgars, as also the ravaging of Bussia, Boland, Silesia, and Hungary by the Mongols, comparing Western accounts with the statements of the Chinese and Mongols, as I have done in the previous chapter. When Chinghiz and his generals had ravaged Persia, the countries of the Ca.ucasus, and Southern Eussia, A.D. 1220—24, the warlike enterprises of the Mongols towards the west were stopped for some years, the armies being occupied in the east with the conquest of the Kin empire in Northern China. In the beginning of 1234 the dynasty of the Kin was overthrown, and Ogotai Khan

(1229—42) then resumed the conquest of the countries in the west, commenced by his father. The Tarikh Djihan Kushai states (d'Ohsson, ii. 15) that already in 1229 Ogotai had sent an army of 30,000 men, under the command of the generals Gioeuktai and Sunodai, to conquer the countries of the Kipchaks, Sakasins^^^ and Bidgars!^^^ This expedition seems to be alluded to in the Eussian annals. Karamzin (iii. 270)
states : After the battle of the Kalka, for six years nothing was heard of the Tatars; but in the year 1229 certain Sahsins and Polovtsy from the Lower Volga, who fled from the Tatars, came to take refuge in the country of the Bulgars. At the same time the news arrived that the Bulgar troops posted at the river laik (Ural) had
been defeated by the Tatars. But the latter tarried, for it was not till six years later that Baty (Batu) appeared at the Volga and wintered near the capital of the Bulgars.
The Yuan cliao pi shi states : The emperor (Ogotai) ordered the valiant Suhietai to subdue the Eleven Nations in the north (who were not yet subject to the Mongols), viz., the Kanglin, the Kibclia, the Uhadjighi, the Ulusu, the Madjar, the Asu, the Siesu, the Sierkesu, Keshimir,
Bular, and Lala, —to cross the two rivers Djayakli and Idil, and to march directly upon Kiva Mien Kermen. These eleven nations and the cities against which Subutai had been ordered to wage war are twice more enumerated in the Yiian cli ao pi shi, with some variations in the spelling of the names. There appear also two new names, Mieghie or Meketmeng and Kelie. I shall try to identify these names, as far as my acquaintance with the mediaeval geography of the regions here spoken of may enable me.
"^^'^ See note 720. "^'^^ At the same time another army, commanded by Oharmogun, had been directed to Persia.



KANKLY, ETC. 301
The Kaxglin of the Yiian ch'ao pi shi are, without doubt, the same as the Kankalis or Kankly of the Mohammedan authors. They lived in the beginning of the thirteenth century in the wide steppe lands east of the laiJc river (Ural) and north of the Lake of Khorazm (Aral). The Kipchaks (Komans) were their western neighbours. Rashid in his accounts of the Turkish tribes (Berezin, i. 18) devotes only a few lines to the Kankly. He states that they first invented wheeled cars

hanUy in
Turkish, whence their name is derived— but says nothing
about their abodes. We learn from Abulghazi (i 605—64) that the Kanklys, at the accession of Chinghiz, occupied
the country as far east as the Issigol Lake and the rivers
Cliu and Talash (Taras). Two European travellers traversed in the middle of the thirteenth century the steppes where this nation then dwelt, and they have left the following short notices
of them :—Piano Carpini, after quitting the country of the Comani (Kipchaks), states (749) : " Post hoc terram intravimus Cangitarum quse magnam habet in pluribus locis penuriam aquarum ; in qua etiam homines pauci morantur propter aquse defectum. . . . Et tam Comani quam Cangitae non laborant, sed tantum de animalibus vivebant ; nec sedificabant domos, sed in tabernaculis habitabant." After this Carpini entered the country of the Bisermin (the Mohamm.edan Turks of Western Turkestan). Eubruck terms the same people Cangle. Page 265 : " Quid am Comani qui dicebantur Cangle." Page 274: " Cangle quedam parentela Comanorum." Eubruck set out from the Volga on the i6th September 1253, and then travelled eastward through the country of the Cangle till the ist November. In the Chinese historical works of the Mongol period,
''35 The Kanklys and the Kipchaks or Comans belonged indeed to the same race (Turks).



302 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
the Kanklys are repeatedly spoken of, but the information the Chinese authors give about this tribe is very meagre. The name is generally spelt there K^ang-li, sometimes Hang-li. The K'ang-li were known to the Kin as early as the twelfth century. As I have stated (p. 223), a khan of that nation was desirous of becoming a vassal of the Kin emperor. In the Yuan shi the name K'^ang-li occurs frequently, and especially in the biographies. As they were a warlike nation, the Mongol khans used to place them in their army, and many brave generals of the Mongol empire belonged to the Kankly. In the biography of Bn-hu-mu, Yiian shi, chap, cxxx., who was a K^ang-li, it is stated that this nation derived their origin from the Kao hil {Kao che)J^^ Bu-hu-mu's
son, K ui-k'ui, has a separate biography in chap, cxliii. In chap, cxxxvi. we find the biography of A-sha-hu-hua, who was a prince of the reigning family of the K'ang-li. It is stated there that when Chinghiz had ravaged the country of the K'ang-li, their ruler died, and left a widow belonging to the tribe of Shen-mie gu-ma-li. Owing to the ruined state of her affairs, she was for a long time unable to leave her country. Subsequently, however, through some miraculous agency, she was surprised on one occasion by the appearance of some richly laden camels. In consequence of this she set out with her two sons, K^u-lil and Ya-ya, for the residence of the emperor, and after two years returned home, leaving her sons with 0-go-t^ai. Thirteen years later she again proceeded to the Mongol court at Ho-lin (Karakorum) to see her sons, who were with the Qm^QmY Meng-U oP'^ A-sha-bu-hua, in whose biography these details are found, was the grandson of this lady and the son of Ya-ya. A-sha-bu-hua, who was a general in Kubilai's army, died
As we have seen, the Chinese historians make the Uigurs also descend from the Kao die ; see note 596. The latter name in Chinese means " high car," 737 Her adventures have furnished the material for a Chinese drama.

in 1 30 1. His brother, T"o-fo, was a distinguished
officer in Kubilai's life-guard. The title of Yilii chung ivang had been bestowed upon him. His son, THe-murh-ta-shi, was minister under the last Mongol emperor, Shun ti. His biography is found in chap. cxl. Ya-ya left also a son, Wa-to-man (Othman). Chap. 123. Ai-mo belonged to the tribe Ba-d%o K^angli. He accompanied Su-bu-tai noyen when the latter waged war in the country of the Kin-clia (Kipchak). His son, ¥€-811-1"ai-rh, distinguished himself at the conquest of the Chinese province Fu kien, and at the expedition to Ji-pen (Japan). He died in 1288. Chap. 133. Ye-su-de-rli, the son of Ai-lo Bo-ya-wuP^ Chap. 134. T'u-hu-hi, in the service of Kubilai, was the ninth son of A-li-ta-shi, who was a grandson of the
K'ang-li prince, I-na. In the same chapter is the biography of Wa-lo-sze^^^
who was the secretary of Kubilai's successor. His father, Ming-li T' ie-mit-rh, had held the same office under Kubilai, and his grandfather, Hai-du, had served in Mangu Khan's army. His great-grandfather, Ha-shi Bo-yao (see note 738), had surrendered in early times to the Mongols, and had been appointed superintendent of the herds belonging to Kubilai's mother. Wa-lo-sze's son, K' ing-iung, who served under the last Mongol emperor, Shun ti, has a separate biography in chap, cxlii.
Chap. 135. T'a-li-clii, served under Kubilai, his
father, Ye-li-li-ho, having surrendered to Chinghiz. Ibidem : Ming-an, also a Kankly in Kubilai's service. Finally, in chap, ccv., under the rubric of " Yillanous Officers," is the biography of the Kankly Ha-ma.
Bo-ya-wu is probably intended for Bayaut. This was, according to the Mohammedan authors (d'Ohsson, i. 197). the name of one branch of the Kanklj^s, to which Turkhan khatun, the mother of Mohammed Shah of Khorazm, belonged. There were a great number of Kanklys in Khorazm when the Mongols first invaded the country. The name of this man is rendered by the same Chinese characters which in the Yuan shi generally represent the name of Russia.



304 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
It is generally believed (Klaproth, d'Avezac, Schott, and others), that the Fechenegs spoken of in the Russian annals, who occupied the steppes of Southern Eussia in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and who subsequently were driven away from these tracts by the Polovtsy or Kumans, are identical with the Kanhlys, who in the days
of Chinghiz dwelt east of the laik. This supposition seems to be founded upon a statement of Constantine Porphyrogeneta (tenth century), that three of the most powerful tribes of the FatzinaJdtes were known by the name of Kangar. Abulfeda (ii. 297) quotes an author of the tenth century who records that the Bedjenaks,
a Turkish tribe, having left their original abode (in Asia), had established themselves between the Khazars and Eum (Byzantine empire). Ibn Sayd, an author who lived
three centuries later, also quoted by Abulfeda (ii. 292), says that the mountains of the Bedjnaks are situated east of the countries of the Kumans. Abulfeda does not mention the Kankly. This name does not appear either, it seems, in the Mohammedan writers previous to the
Mongol period.
As regards the other countries, cities, and rivers enumerated in the above-quoted passages of the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, I may offer the following elucidations :

Kihcha denotes Kipcliah. Of this people more detailed accounts will be given in Part III. Uhadji seems to be intended for Ohezy, Abazi, or Abhhazi. The Abkhazes still inhabit their ancient abodes, i.e., the western part of the Caucasus and the eastern shore of the Black Sea. They are called Ohezy in the ancient Eussian annals, 'ABaayol in the Byzantine annals. Piano Carpini (706—709) calls them Obesi, but erroneously identifies them with the Georgians. Ibn

KANKLY, ETC. 305
Sayd (thirteenth century), quoted by Abulfeda (ii. 286), , speaks of the city of the Abkhazes situated on the Black
Sea. The Ulusu (Oruss in Mongol) are the Eussians. See
Part III. The Asu (Asut in the Mongol text of the Yiian cli ao pi shi, which is the plural form of Asu) are the Asi or Alans of Western mediaeval authors. (See Part III.) The ancient Eiissian annals term them Yasy. The Madjar are the Magyars or Hungarians. The Sierkcsu are the Cherkesses, the Circasi of Piano Carpini (748), the Cherkis of Eubruck (252). The Eussian mediaeval annals mention, among the nations subdued by the Mongols at the time they crossed the Caucasus, the Kassagi. Klaproth states that the ancient name of the Cherkesses was Kassahli, and the Ossets and Mingrelians call the Cherkesses still by this latter name. The Bular (the name is written also Pular and Pidaronan in the Yuan cliao pi shi) are the Bulgars. See Part III.
The Siesit (termed also Sasu) are probably the Saksins. See note 720. The name of Kesliimir occurs also among the names of countries with the conquest of which, according to the Mongol annals, Subutai had been entrusted. But Kashmir lay far out of his way ; and according to the Ylian shi, it was only in 1253 that a Mongol corps was sent to that country. This fact is confirmed by Eashid. See note 368. I may, however, mention that PI. Carpini, whose information was gathered in 1247, in enumerating the countries subdued by the Tartars (p. 708), includes Kasmir in his list. We meet further with the name Lala among the eleven nations or countries enumerated in the Mongol annals. This name is replaced by Kelie where the list is given for the second time. It seems to me that by Kelie thQ Kelar
of the Mohammedan authors is intended. Thus they term u



3o6 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
the king of Hungary, as we shall see farther on, note 769. By a misunderstanding the Mongol chronicler has taken Kelar for the name of a country. Sometimes Eashid falls
into the same error. Comp. Berezin's translation, ii. p. 74: " Ogotai Khan conquered Khatai and the countries of Kelar, Bashkurt, Pula, Desht-kipchak, Euss, Cherkess, As, &c." Again, I. c, i. 2, 51, Kelar appears as the name of a country, and Eashid always associates it with Bashkurt, by which name properly the Bashkirs are meant ; but Eashid applies this name also to the Hungarians (d'Ohsson, ii. 621). Comp. also Carpini, 747 : " Bascarti vel magna Hungaria ; " and Eubruck, 327: " Fascatir vel magna Hungaria."
The Yuan ch'ao pi shi notices two rivers which Subutai had been ordered to cross, viz., the DjayaJch and the Mil. The first of these rivers, the original Turkish name of which is laik or Vjaik, is the Ural river of modern Eussian maps. We find it first mentioned in the Byzantine writers. Zemarchus, sent in 569 by the Byzantine emperor to the khan of the Turks, on his way back came to the Daich river, and then to the Attila (Volga). Constantine Porphyrogenita (tenth century) calls the laik Terix (Yule's " Cathay," clxvi.). As I have stated above, the ancient Eussian annals write this name Yaih. PI. Carpini
styles the same river (743) Jaec ; Eubruck (274), Jagac. In Haithon's itinerary the name reads Jaic. On the Cata
lan map (1375 A.D.) it is called JayecTi. In the Moham
medan historians of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the river laih is frequently mentioned. Eashid notices it in his account of the Kipchak. This is also " the great river Yak, which has its spring in the land of Siberia, near the river Cama, and runs through the land of Nagay, falling into the Mare Caspium," in Jenkinson's narrative of a journey to Bokhara in i 5 5 8. The other river is the Volga. By the name of Idil or Atel, meaning " river " in Turkish, the Turks, and after



KANKLY, ETC. 307
them all Moliammedan geographers, have designated the Volga, which latter name, used by the Slavic nations, seems to be derived from the ancient city of Bolgliar, situated on the A^olga. In the tenth century Istakhri
states (p. 2) that the Khazars live on the river which runs through their country. Ibn Khurdadbeh (also in the tenth century) speaks also of a city Atel. This is believed to answer to the present Astrakhan. In the Byzantine writers the name appears much earlier; the river Attilia
in Zemarchus' itinerary {y. supra). Piano Oarpini, 775 : " Uthil quam Eusci vocant Volga." Ibidem, 743 : " Ilumen Volga super quod vadit Bati est valde magnum." Eubruck calls the Volga always Ethilia. On the Catalan map the name reads Edil. It remains to identify the three cities mentioned in the Yiian ch'ao pi shi in connection with Subutai's expe
dition.
Mieghie (this name is also spelt, erroneously, it seems,
Mekctmeng) is probably identical with the city of Mie-liiesz or Mai-Jco-sz, noticed in the Yiian shi among the cities north of the Caucasus, captured by the prince (subsequently emperor) Mangu (see farther on, p. 3 1 6). Khva (the name is also written Keibie) is evidently intended for Kiev, the ancient capital of Eussia, which was taken by the Mongols in 1240. The Yuan ch'ao pi shi writes Kiim Mienkerman. The second name is intended for Man kerman, which in Turkish means great city." The latter name appears in the relation of Timur's expedition to Eussia in 1395, as given in the Zafernameh, iii. 55. It is there stated that the Kipchak prince Bikyarok Aglen then had his residence at Man kirmen, a city on the Uzi river. The Uzi seems to be the same as the Azzu river of Abulfeda, ii. 80, i.e., the Dnieper of our days. The Eussian annals do not mention a city of the above name on the Dnieper. But we learn from the late Professor Ph. Bruhn in Odessa, who in 1874 published
an interesting article on the ancient names of Kiev



3oS MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
(" Memoirs of tlie Third Archeol. Congress at Kiev," i. p. 294), that this ancient Eussian capital indeed was known in the Middle Ages by the name of Mankerman. Eashideddin, in relating Batu's expedition to Southern Eussia in
1240, reports that he captured, after a siege of nine days, the great Eussian city of Mingercan (or Manherfaan, as Berezin reads). Here evidently Kiev is meant, and the correct reading would be Mankerman. Bruhn quotes also the Venetian envoy Contarini, who about 1475 passed through Eussia on his journey to and from Persia, and who states that Chio (Kiev) is also called Magroman.
According to the Tarikh Djihan Kushai and the Djamiut Tevarikh (d'Ohsson, ii. 699, seqq.), it was resolved at the second Kuriltai convoked in the reign of Ogotai Khan that a vast army should be raised in order to subdue the countries of the Asi, Bulgars, Kipchaks, and Eussians, all bordering upon the territories of Batu/^^ the son of Chinghiz's eldest son Djuchi. Ogotai designated the following princes to assist Batu in these expeditions : Kuyuk and Kadan]'^'^ sons of Ogotai ; Mangu and Budjeh^^^
''^^ The Mohammedan authors call him Batu. In the Yuan ch'ao pi shi his name is likewise written Batu ; in the Ylian shi, Ba-du. To the Eussian chroniclers the Mongol conqueror of Russia was known under the name of Baty. PI. Carpini writes Bati ; Rubruck, Batu or Baatu. "^^^ D'Ohsson states, ii. 99, after Rashid, that Ogotai by his chief wife, Turakina, had five sons, Kuyuk, Kutan, Kuchu, Karadjar, and Kashi ; his two other sons, Kadan Ogul and Melih, were by concubines. Kuyuk, as is known, was afterwards elected Mongol emperor (1246-48). In the Ylian shi, chap, cvii., genealogical tables, Gui-yu and Ho-dan appear as the names of the sons of Ogotai. PI. Carpini, 665 : " Occoday Can hos filios habuit
:
Cuyuc, qui nunc est imperator, Cocten (probably the Kutan of Rashid) et Chirenen." At p. 668 he mentions the Prince Karachay (probably Karadjar). Rubruck (296, 297) calls Kuyuk Ken Khan (the name is evidently misspelt in the manuscripts), and states that he had a brother Seremon, who ventured to contest the election of Mangu Khan. But according to the Mohammedan authors, Shiramun, who opposed Mangu, was a son of Kuyuk's brother Kuchu (d'Ohsson, ii. 187, 247). PI. Carpini, 668, calls him Seremun.These names read Menj-h'o and Bu-cKo in the Yiian shi, I. c, Comp.

A. —Beginning of tpie Campaign—Invasion of the COUNTKY OF BULGAR, A.D. 1 236-37.
The Mohammedan authors report (d'Ohsson, ii. 619 se(ig[?) that, having marched during the whole summer, the Mongol army arrived in autumn at the ordo of the sons of Djuchi, in the neighbourhood of the kingdom of Bulgar, on the river (name illegible in the MS., probably the A^olga). In the winter of 1236-37, the Mongol princes detached Subutai to invade the countries of the Asi and Bulgar. This general proceeded to the city of Bulgar, captured it, and its inhabitants were massacred or dragged away into slavery. Eashid mentions two chiefs,
also note 281. Mangu was subsequently Mongol emperor (1251-59). PI. Carpini (666, 667): " Alterius autem filius Chingis Can, cujus nomen ignoramus (it was Tulei), filios habuit Mengu, cujus mater est Seroctan ; . . . Alius vocatur Bichac." Farther on PI. Carpini writes the same name, it seems, Buigec, and states that this prince was in Hungary. ''^^ Buri is noticed in the Yiian ch'ao pi shi (see farther on, p. 333). PI. Carpini, 666 : " Pilii Chyaaclay sunt Burin et Cadan. Nomina aliorum nescimus." Farther on, 667, he states that both of them were in Hungary. As we have seen, Kadan, according to Rashid, was the son of Ogotai. Rubruck, 279, 280, speaks also of Buri. ^^•5 Kullcan or Gulgan, according to Rashid, was Chinghiz' son by Gulcdju, daughter of the Kin emperor. He was killed in Russia (d'Ohsson, i. 418, ii. 625). In the Yiian shi, I. c, his name reads K'uo-li-kien. Sons of Djuchi, Chinghiz' eldest son. In the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1236, Wa-lu-do (Orda) is mentioned together with his hvothev Ba-du. Shiban's name [Sihan) occurs in Su-bu-t'ai's biography (see farther on). PI, Carpini (665, 666) : " Filii Tossuc Can (this he terms Djuchi) sunt Bati, iste est ditior et potentior post imperatorem ; Oo'du, iste est senior omnium ducum ; Syban, Bora, Berea, ThauV Farther on, 668, in enumerating the Mongol princes, he mentions Sinocur and Thua temur, who seem to be the same as ShinJcur and TuJca timur of Rashid, also sons of Djuchi. See Howorth's " Mongols," ii. 102, Djuchi's descendants.

Bayan (?) and Chihu (?), who came in person to render homage to the princes, and were then released ; but they subsequently revolted, and Subutai was sent again to subdue them. The Eussian annals state (Karamzin, iii. 270) that Baty wintered near the Volga in 1236—37, not far from the capital of the Bulgars, which was destroyed in the autumn of 1237. The Yiian shi does not record the invasion of Bubar. In the biography of Subutai, where all the military
doinqs of this famous greneral are related, no mention is made of Bulgar. But on the ancient Mongol-Chinese map of the fourteenth century (see Part III.), Bu-li-a-rh is marked east of Eussia.
B.—Expedition against the Kipchaks, Bokshas, and . BURTASSES, A.D. I 237.
Eashid reports (d'Ohssou, ii. 623): The Mongol princes,
after deliberation, determined to extend their army and to proceed in a vast line, as is generally done at a hattue. Mangu, who commanded the left flank near the (Caspian) Sea, captured Bachman, one of the most valiant chiefs of the Kipchaks, who belonged to the tribe of Olerlik (?), and Kacliar Ogola, who belonged to the people of . . . (probably Ase). Bachman, who had for a long time evaded his pursuers, had collected a troop of robbers, and
fugitives, and was a constant source of trouble to the Mongols, sometimes carrying off considerable booty from them. As he frequently changed his abode, and hid himself in the forests bordering on the river Atil (Volga),
it was difficult to catch him. Mangu gave orders to prepare a squadron of two hundred boats, and to put a hundred men in each boat. The prince himself with one part of the squadron went along one bank of the river, beating the adjacent forests ; whilst his brother Budjek, with the rest of the boats, ransacked the opposite



KIPCHAKS, BOKSHAS, AND BURTASSES.
bank At one place the Mongols found vestiges of a recently abandoned encampment, and an old woman informed them that Bachman had retired to an island. As they had no boats near that place, they were unable to pursue Bachman, when suddenly a high wind arose, causing the water to go down. The Mongol troops forded the river, and Bachman was taken d Vimproviste ;
his men beino- either drowned or killed. The Monsjols returned with a large booty, without having lost a single man. Bachman solicited the favour to be killed by Mangu's own hand ; but this prince ordered his brother Badjek to cut the Kipchak chief through the middle. Kachar Ogola, one of the chiefs of the Ases, was also killed. The Mongol princes passed the summer of 1237 in that country. In the same year Batu^ Orda, Barhai^^^ Kadan, Buri, Kulkan attacked the Bokshas^"^^ and the
Burtasses^^^
The Yuan shi also reports the capture of Bachman. In chap, iii., biography of Mangu Khan, we read :

In the third month of 1237 Meng-lio invaded Kin-clia
BarJcai, according to Rashid, was a brother of Batu. This is PI. Carpini's Berca (see note 746). In the Yiian shi he is termed Bie-rMco. ''^^ By Bokshas probably the Mokshas are meant. This is still the name of one of the tribes of the Mordvins, a people belonging to the Finnish race, who still have their abodes west of the middle course of the Volga, principally in the governments of Penza (where is a river Moksha and a city Mokshank), Simbirsk, Saratov, Samara. Constantine Porph. (tenth century) speaks of Mophia, a country distant ten days' journey from the Pechenegs. The name of the Morclva appears in Nestor's list of nations in the eleventh century. PI. Carpini, 747 : " Comania habet ab aquilone immediate post Rusciam : Morduinos, Bileros," i.e., Magnam Bulgariam, &c. At p. 709 he writes the same name Moi^dui. E-ubruck (251, 252) notices the people Merdas, called Merdini by the Latins, beyond the river Tanais (Don), and near the great river Ethilia (Volga) ; and in their vicinity another people which he terms Moxel. These latter seem to be the Mokshas, and also the same as the Moxia of Josafa Barbaro (1436). Comp. Fraehn's interesting treatise on Ibn Poszlan's notices of the Russians, 1823.

Meng-k'o, when iD formed of this fact, proceeded immediately with his troops to capture him. Happily a strong wind arose which caused the water to fall, so that it could be forded ; and Meng-k'o said, ^'Heaven opens up my way." Ba-cKiman's troops were massacred, and he was made prisoner. % Meng-k'o ordered him to kneel down; but he replied, " I have been myself a king and do not fear death. I am not a camel that I should kneel." After this he put
the Mongols in mind of the rising of the flood, and advised them to think of returning ; and indeed part of the troops were obliged to reach the opposite shore by swimming. In the biography of Su-bu-t'ai (see note 689) the same story is reported, but there the merit of the capture of
Ba-clii-man is attributed to this general.

I may begin with the accounts found in the Eussian annals, which, of course, give the fullest information regarding these events. Compare Karamzin, iii. 272
seciq.
After the city of Bulgar had been destroyed, the Tatars appeared towards the end of 1 2 3 7 on the frontiers of Eussia, then bounded on the east by Bulgaria. The
cities of Pronsk, Bielgorod, and Ijeslavets were captured, whereupon they arrived at Biazan, where the Prince Yuri/ (George) had shut himself up. This prince was not able to resist the Mongol arms. Eiazan was taken by assault on December 21, 1237, when there was a

general massacre of the inhabitants, in which the Prince Yury with his family perished. The city of Kolomna, defended by Ynry's brother Boman, shared the same fate as Eiazan. Vladimir, the son of the Grand-Duke Turij of Vladimir, had been entrusted with the defence of Moscow ; but he was also defeated by the Mongols and made prisoner. The Grand-Duke Yury now becoming alarmed, left Vladimir, and posted his army on the banks of the Siti (an affluent of the Mologa). He determined to wait
there for auxiliary troops promised by his brothers
Yaroslav of Kiev and Sviatoslav ; his sons Vsevolod and Mstislav having been left meantime to defend the capital, Vladimir. On the 2d February 1238 the Mongols invested Vladimir and summoned the city to surrender. One Moni]^ol detachment had been sent to Siczdal, and having sacked this place, joined the main army at Vladimir. On the 8th of February the city surrendered, and, according; to the Mong^ol custom, the inhabitants were put to the sword, the whole family of the Grand-Duke having perished on the occasion. After this the Mongol troops were divided into several corps, which moved about
in different directions, sackincr the cities and rava^inf:^ the
country. Thus in February 1238 the cities of Voljsky,
Gorodets, Kostromskoi Galich, Fereslavl, Bostov, Yaroslav, Yuriev and Dmitrov were plundered or destroyed. The Grand-Duke Yury, still on the river Siti, awaiting succour from his brothers, was attacked on the 4th of March, and killed with most of his troops. Another Mongol corps had turned towards Novgorod, and after taking Voloh Lamshy and Twer, they invested Torjok, which city surrendered on the 5 th of March, after a siege of two weeks. When Baty had arrived at a distance of a hundred versts from the rich city of Novgorod, he suddenly marched " back (the reason of his return is nnknown), and directed his host against Kozelsk (in the government of Kaluga). This insignificant city was able to resist the Mongols for seven weeks, owing to the



314 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
heroism of its inhabitants. Finally, they were obliged to surrender, and suffered the common fate of those who opposed the Mongols. The Eussian chroniclers report that Baty, having massacred all the inhabitants of the city, named it " the bad city." After this the Mongols returned to the country of the Polovtsy (Kipchaks) ; and Yaroslav, prince of Kiev, the brother of Yury, who had been killed in the battle on the Siti, went to Vladimir, and was proclaimed Grand-Duke.
The invasion of Eussia by the Mongols related above is spoken of in the following terms in the Tarikh Djihan Kushai (d'Ohsson, ii. 619) :

When the city of Bulgar had been taken, the Mongol armies invaded Russia, and conquered that country as far as the city of Mocoss, the inhabitants of which were numerous as ants and locusts. The Mongols were obliged to pass through vast forests, so dense that not even a serpent could penetrate them. The Mongol princes therefore ordered roads to be cut across, wide enough for three carts to pass abreast. Catapults were set up to demolish the wall of Mocoss ; and after a siege of several days, the place surrendered, when immense booty was taken. Orders were given to cut off the right ears of all the corpses ; and thus it was found that
the number slain amounted to 270,ooo.'^^-^ Eashid gives a more detailed account of this expedition (d'Ohsson, ii. 621); but it is to be regretted that the names of the greater number of the places mentioned in Eussia cannot be ascertained owing to the want of diacritical marks in the Persian text. He reports
:
In the autumn of 1237, the Mongol princes marched all together against the Eussians. Kuyuk, Mangu, Kul
D'Ohsson identifies Mocoss with Moscow. He may be right. I would, however, observe that Moscow at the time spoken of was not a large and populous city. It had been founded in 1 147 by the GrandDuke Yury Dolgoruky, but was destroyed in 1176 by a prince of Riazan.



INVASION OF RUSSIA, 1237-38. 31.5
kan, Kadan, and Buri besieged the city of Ban, and took it after three days. (Berezin reads 'Yan, and thinks that Eiazan is intended.) They then stormed the city of Iga, where Kulkan was mortally wouuded. (Berezin reads Fkc, and thinks that Kolomna on the river Oka is meant.) They defeated and killed Uriiian, one of the chiefs of the Eussians (the prince Eoman of Kolomna). The city of Muskav (Berezin) was captured after a siege of five days, and the Emir Ulai Timur killed (Vladimir, who defended Moscow ; but he was only taken prisoner, not killed). It took eight days to capture the city of Yurlvi husurgli (the Great Yurki), (probably Vladimir, the residence of the Grand-Duke Yury). The city of Kir NiJda, the capital of the country of Venceslav, was taken after only five days' siege. (Berezin reads Karinkal, the city of Taroslav, and thinks that Karinkal is misspelt for Torjok.) The sovereign of this country, the Great Yurki, who had hidden himself in the forests, was made prisoner and executed. The Mongol princes now held a Kuriltai, where it was determined to proceed to the interior of Eussia by different routes ; and the Mongols
took all the cities and fortresses they met with on their way. Batu besieged the city of Kil AcasJca for two months without success ; but when he had been joined by the princes Kadan and Buri, the city was taken by
assault in three days. After this the princes cantoned
their troops and took rest for some time.
The information found in the Yiian shi with respect to the second invasion of Eussia is very meagre. In the biography of Meng-k^o (Mangu), in chap, iii., it is stated that when Ba-ch'i-man, chief of the Kin-ch'a, had been killed (see above), Meng-k'o accompanied Ba-du in the expedition against the Wa-lo-sz (Eussians). At the

siege of the city of Ye-lie-dsan^^^ he fought in person, and it was due to his bravery that the city was taken.
D, —Expedition to the Eegions of the Caucasus, A.D. 1238-39.
Eashid reports that in the autumn of 1 2 3 8 . . . and Kadan marched against the Circasses, and in winter killed their prince, Tukan (?). Shiban, Budjek, and Buri made an incursion upon the country of the Merims, a portion of the nation called Chinchak. Barkai defeated the Kipchaks and made the chief of the Mehrits prisoner. In the winter of 1238—39, . . . (probably Mangu's name is to be supplied) with Buri and Kadan invested the city of Mangass (may also be read Mikess), which was taken after six weeks' siege. In the spring of 1239, Kukdai was sent to capture Timur kahalia^^^ and to take possession of the adjacent countries. A corroboration of the account of the siege of Mangass or Mikess seems to be given in the Yuan shi. In the annals there, s. a. 1239, we read: Meng-l^o (Mangu) in
vested the city A-su 3Iie-Jcie-sz\ and captured it after
three months' siege. It seems to me that we have to understand Mie-k'ie-sz', a city of the A-su (Asi or Alans). The same, or nearly the same, name occurs several times in the Yuan shi. Thus, in chap, cxxii., in the biography of
Si-li-gan-hu^''^ it is stated that in 1239, in the eleventh month, the Mongol army reached the city of Asio Mie
Jiie-sz. It was well fortified and difficult to storm. In
the spring of 1240, however, Si-li-gan-lu conducted an
assault, which was successful, and the city was taken.
Probably Riazan is meant. I suppose that by a mistake the character ye has been connected with the name, for Lie-dsan would be just the proper Chinese spelling of the above name, or perhaps Ye-Ue-dsan is the Mongol transcription of E-iazan. The Mongols like to prefix a vowel to foreign proper names. Thus they call the Russians Orus. Literally " Iron gate." Derbend, on the Caspian Sea, is meant, 755 Mongol general of Tangut extraction, who took part in the western expeditions under Batu.



INVASION OF SOUTHERN RUSSIA, 1240. 317
In chap, cxxxii., biography of Ba-dit-rh, the storming of a city called Mai-Uo-sz by Meng-k'o is related. The name of a city called Mai-Jiie-sz' appears also in the biography of the Kipchak prince T\i-tu-lict, I. c, chap, cxxviii. We have seen that the Ylian cli ao pi shi notices
a city called Micgie, taken by the Mongol princes (p. 300). As to the position of this place, I can give no information. I may, however, observe, that Ibn Sayd, quoted by Abul
feda (ii. 287), states that the principal castle of the Alans was one of the strongest places in the world. He does not give the name of it. Mas'udi (ii. 43) speaks also of this castle of the Alans, situated between the kingdom of the Alans and the Kabh (Caucasus), on a considerable river. It is not improbable that this castle of the Alans was in the famous Bariel defile, on the Upper Terek, near Mount Kazbek ; the Babi-Allan (gate of the Alans) of the Mohammedan geographers, the Porta Caucasia of the ancients.
E. —The Eavaging of Southern Eussia by the Mongols, a.d. i 240.
I may again begin with the accounts drawn from the Eussian annals, Karamzin, iv. 6 seg^q. The Grand-Duke Yury of Vladimir and his sons had all perished by the sword of the Mongols ; and after the latter had retired, Yaroslav of Kiev, the brother of Yuri, took possession of the throne of Vladimir, ceding Kiev to Michael of Chernigov. Baty, having reduced the Polovtsy (Kipchaks), again invaded Eussia, ravaged the country of the Mordvins, plundered Murom and Gorokhovets, and threatened the Grand-Dukedom of Vladimir ; but suddenly he turned his host southward to the rich countries of Southern Eussia. He destroyed Pereslavl. One corps of the Mongols was directed against Clurnigoiv, which city, defended by the valiant prince Mstislav Glebovich, the cousin of Michael of Kiev, was taken by



3i8 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
assault and destroyed. Mstislav, however, succeeded in making his escape to Hungary. After this the Mongols proceeded to Kiev, which Mangu had previously reconnoitred. He had advanced as far as the city of Piessochny on the Dnieper, and had been much delighted on getting sight of the magnificent city of Kiev, where his envoys had been previously killed. When the Mongols approached, Michael fled to Hungary, and the boyar, Dmitry, took upon himself the defence of the city ; while Baty, arriving with his immense host, invested it on all sides. I may here give the translation of a passage of the contemporary Eussian annals of Woskressensk referring to the siege of Kiev (Karamzin,
iv. 285). " Like dense clouds the Tatars pushed themselves forward towards Kiev, investing the city on all sides. The rattling of their innumerable carts, the bellowing of camels and cattle, the neighing of horses, and the wild battle-cry, were so overwhelming as to render inaudible the conversation of the people inside the city. A Tatar named Tavrul, who had been captured, reported that Baty himself was before Kiev ; that his brothers (relations) were all valiant captains : Urdiic (Orda), Baidar
(son of Chagatai), Biriii (Buri), Kadan, Bechah (Budjek), Mengu, and Kiuyuk (Kuyuk).'^^^ When the news of the khan's (Ogotai's) death reached Kuyuk, he returned, and
became himself khan."^^^ There was also Sehediai hogatyr,
The Mongols are invariably termed Tatars in the Russian annats. The Hungarian and other Western chronicles of the thirteenth century call them Tartars. Piano Carpini, Rubruck, M. Polo, also write Tartar. But the original Mongol name of the tribe, from which this appellation is derived, was Tatar. Thus the Mohammedan and the Chinese authors spell the name. The name Mongol was little known in the Middle Ages in Europe, but Piano Carpini and Rubruck use also the names Mongal, Moal. ''^'^ Compare notes 741-746. 758 The latter statement must have been added a few years later. The siege of Kiev took place in 1240, but Ogotai died only in December of 1 24 1, and Kuyuk was elected khan in 1246. There are some discrepancies between the statements of Western and Eastern authors as to the date



INVASION OF SOUTHERN RUSSIA, 1240. 319
^vilo did not belong to the khan's relatives, but who was considered his first general ; and another, by name Burundai. These two had conquered the whole country of Bulgar and Suzdal." Notwithstanding the stout resistance of the Eussians, Kiev was finally taken by assault and destroyed. The brave Dmitry was made prisoner. Batu spared his life, but took him along with him. Dmitry is said to have subsequently persuaded Batu to leave Eussia and invade the rich country of Hungary. But before proceeding thither, Batu sacked and plundered the cities of Vladimir in Volhynia, Galich, Ladyjin (in Podolia), and Kamenets. At Kremnets, however, the Mongols suffered a defeat.
The account given by Eashid of the invasion of Southern Eussia in 1240 is very confused, and some of the proper names cannot be pronounced. The Persian
historian states (d'Ohsson, ii. 627):

When the princes Kuyuk and Mangu had left the army in the autumn of 1239, the Prince Batu, with his
when Kuyuk was recalled by his father, and also with respect to the time when Ogotai died. Rashid states (d'Ohsson, ii. 118) : The princes, Kuyuk and Mangu, having received orders from the Emperor Ogotai to return, left the army in the autumn of 1 239. When they arrived in Tartary, Ogotai had already departed this life. But this does not agree with the Yiian ch'ao pi shi, which reports, with many details, Kuyuk's reception by his father when he had arrived from the west (see farther on, H.). According to the annals of the Yiian shi, Kuyuk in 1240 was still with the army
in the west. We read there, under this year : " The Prince Gu-yu had conquered the countries in the west ; but there were still some nations who resisted, and he despatched a courier with a report." D'Ohsson, ii. 155, quotes a passage from Roger's " Miserabile Carmen," in which it is stated that the Tatars suddenly left Hungary owing to the arrival of a courier bringing the news of the great khan's death. The precise date of the arrival of the courier is not given, but it may be concluded that it happened in the winter of 1241-42. This agrees with the Chinese annals. ''^^ Sebediai bogatyr is Subutai haliadur, repeatedly spoken of in these pages, I cannot understand why Karamzin (iii. 11) will have the name Sebediai to be read Sudai, and changes Burundai into Bastyr. Burundai of the Russian chroniclers is doubtless the general Buruldai of Rashid's record, who distinguished himself in Poland and Hungary. (See farther on p. 322).

brothers and the princes Kadan, Buri, Buchek, marched against the Russians and the Karalmlpahs (Black Caps). In nine days they took the great Eussian city of Minger
kan (Kiev, vide p. 307, 308), and after this all the cities of Uladimir (Vladimir). After ravaging the land to a great extent and sacking all the cities on their way, they invested the city of Uch-ogid Uladimir (in Turkish " the three sons of Vladimir ") with their united forces, and captured it in three days. (Berezin reads Ucheslav, son of Uladimir, and thinks that Iziaslav Vladimirovich, prince of Kamenets, is meant.)
As to the Chinese accounts of these events, they are also vague and unintelligible. In the repeatedly quoted biography of Su-bu-t'ai it is stated that in the year 1 241 ''^^ the emperor Ogotai ordered Batu and the other princes to attack Ye-li-han, king of the Wu-lu-sz' (Eussians). They then proceeded to invest the city of T^u-li-sze-lio, which for a long time could not be taken ; but when Ye-li-han had been made prisoner, the city was taken by assault. After this the Eussians all surrendered, and the army returned.
F. —Expedition of the Mongols to Poland, Silesia, AND Moravia, a.d. 1240-41.
The following general sketch of this expedition is drawn from d'Ohsson (ii. 120 seqq?), who quotes Polish and other European annals :

After the death of Boleslaus III. in 1 139, Poland was divided among his four sons ; and when the Mongols proceeded from Eussia westward, they found there four
The date 1241 is a mistake for 1240; for the events reported in the biography under the year 1 24 1 are placed there before the expedition to Hungary, which, as is well ascertained, took place in 1241. ''^^ I can give no explanation about the king Ye-li-ban. The city of T'u-li-sze-k'o is perhaps Kozelsh.

realms. Boleslaus IV., pudicus, reigned over Krakow and Sandomir. Conrad ruled Mazovia and Kuyavia, liis residence being in Plotsk. Henry II. possessed Lower Silesia and the provinces of Gnesen, Posnania, and Kalish, himself residing in Vratislav or Bresiau. The dukedoms of Oppeln and Eatibor belonged to Miecislav. The Tartars first appeared in Poland in the year 1 240, plundered the province of Luhlin, and then retired to Galicia. The next winter, 1240-41, they crossed the Vistula on the ice, ravaged Sandomir, advanced to within seven miles of Krahoiv, and returned again to Galicia. Vladimir, palatine of Krakow, went in pursuit, and succeeded in rescuing the prisoners and recovering a part of the booty that had been taken. But after a short time the Mongols reappeared, devastating Sandomir, Lencisc, and Knyama. The Polish army endeavoured to oppose them, but was defeated near Szydlow, on March 18, 1 24 1. Boleslav and all the nobles fled to Moravia, Hungary, and Germany ; and when the Mongols arrived at Krakow, they found it deserted. After this the Mongols entered Silesia; and as the bridges over the Oder had been burnt, they crossed the
river at Eatibor, swimming or on extemporised bridges. Miecislav retired to Liegnitz, where his cousin Henry rallied an army. The Mongols marched first upon Bresiau, the city having been burnt by the inhabitants, who had shut themselves up in the citadel. The Mongol army did not stay there, but proceeded to Liegnitz, where Henry of Silesia had succeeded in raising a host of 30,000 men, Poles and Germans. Among the latter were the knights of the Teutonic order, commanded by Poppo von Osternau. The commander-in-chief of the Mongols is called Peta by the Polish chroniclers. The
Mongols were superior in numbers to their adversaries. On a great plain near Liegnitz, subsequently called Wahlstatt, on the 9th of April 1 241, that memorable battle

322 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
was fought, which terminated in the complete defeat of the Poles and Germans, and in which Henry was killed. The Mongols remained for some time in the country, and then invaded Moravia, which belonged to the states of Venceslav of Bohemia. The latter sent 5000 men under the command of Yaroslav von Sternberg to defend Olmiltz. This valiant captain not only succeeded in holding out in the fortress, but caused great damage to the Mongols by a sally he made. Finally, the latter withdrew to join the main body of the army, which had been directed to Hungary.
Eashid's account of this expedition is very incomplete and confused (d'Ohsson, ii. 621). He states that Batu, Shihan, and Buruldai marched upon the Polo (Poles) and Basliguirds (Hungarians; see farther on, p. 326). The Polo were a very powerful nation, who professed the Christian faith, and whose territories bordered on the country of the Franks. After this Eashid describes the expedition to Hungary, confounding the Poles with the Hungarians.
An allusion to the Mongol invasion of Poland and
Silesia is found also in the Yiian shi, chap, cxxi., biography of Wu-liang-ho Vai (the son of Su-bu-t'ai ; see note 303). It is stated there that Wu-liang-ho tai accompanied Badu when he invaded the countries of Kinclia (Kipchap) and Wu-la-sz (Eussia). Subsequently he took part also in the expedition against the F'o-lie-rh and Nie-mi-sz
I have no doubt that by these two names the Poles and the Germans are intended. In the Russian annals the Germans are always termed Niemtsy (singular = Niemets). This name occurs first in the annals compiled in the beginning of the twelfth century, the authorship of which is attributed to Nestor, the father of Russian history, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century and died in in6 (see Schloezer's "Russian Annals of Nestor "). Nestor gives the names of the nations living in the eleventh century in Russia and around it. His information is partly drawn from Byzantine sources. But the word Nemgi to designate the Germans

At the time the Mongols ravaged Eastern Europe, Beta IV. reigned in Hungary. His states were bounded on the north by the Carpathian Mountains, and stretched southward to the Gulf of the Adriatic. In 1239 he sheltered in his dominions Kutan, khan of the Kumans^^^ with 40,000 families who had fled from the Mongols. The princes of Eussia, Poland, &c., who had escaped the Mongol sword, had also emigrated to Hungary. Kutan had embraced the Christian religion ; but his people, unable to resist their natural tendencies, having plundered the country they were traversing, and thus irritated the Hungarians, Kutan, being suspected of collusion with the Tartars, was massacred by the mob in 1 24 1. The Kumans, thus brought into the position of declared enemies of the Hungarians, withdrew to Bulgaria on the Danube, ravaging the country on their way.
was in use among the Bohemians in a much earlier period, for it appears in the so-called MS. of Griineberg of the ninth or tenth century. Schafarek, in his "Slavische Alterthlimer," states that the Slavonic nations have always applied this name to the Germans. As to its origin, the Russian linguists generally derive it from nemoi, "dumb," i.e., unable to speak Slavonic. To the ancient Byzantine chroniclers the Germans were known under the same name.

According to the Masalak-al-Absar, of the first half of the fourteenth century (transl. by Quatremere, N. et Ext. xiii. 284), the country of the Kipchaks extended (eastward) to the country of the Nemedj, which separates the Eranks from the Russians. The Turks still call the Germans Niemesi; the Hungarians term them Nemet. The Kumans are the KipcTiaks of the Mohammedan authors, and the
Polovtsy of the Russian annals. In the latter Kotan is termed Kotian Khan of the Polovtsy.

Whilst one part of the Mongol army was devastating Poland, Silesia, and Moravia, the main army, conducted by Batu himself, marched upon Hungary in 1 24 1 . But previous to this he despatched an exiled Englishman who was in the Mongol service to summon Bela to surrender. Batu entered the dominions of Bela in March 1241 by the socalled Russian gate, a defile in the Carpathian Mountains. Peta, who proceeded with his troops from Moravia, reached Hungary some time later by the defile known as the Hungarian gate. The Prince Kadan and the general Subutai directed their corps at the same time through Komania (Moldavia) to Hungary. Bela sent his family to the Austrian frontier and remained himself in his capital. Batu made directly for Pesth, ravaging the country through which he passed. When he reached the capital, the Hungarians were not yet ready for battle. The Archbishop of Kolocha, however, ventured on a sally from Pesth, but was defeated by the Mongols and escaped with difficulty. When the Archbishop of Varadin had arrived with his troops, it was determined to attack
the enemy again. According to their favourite stratagem, the Mongols retired the way they had come, and the Hungarians then marched out. Bela pitched his camp on the western border of the river Sayo^^^ near a place where the river was spanned by a bridge. As it was believed that this bridge was the only place where the Mongols could cross the river, which was bordered by large swamps, a thousand men were posted there for defence. But the
Mongols, who at first had encamped at a distance of five miles, suddenly arrived in the night. One part of them waded through the river, while another forced the bridge by means of a battery of five catapults. At daybreak the Hungarians found themselves attacked from behind ; they were defeated and for the greater part massacred. Bela, however, succeeded in escaping, and fled to the

castle of Thurocz, near the Carpathian Mountains. A few days later the Mongols took Pesth. Whilst these events were taking place in the heart of Hungary, Prince Kadan advanced through Transylvania. After inarching three days through forests, he appeared suddenly at BudanJ^^ The city was captured, and the Count of Ariscalde and 600 German troops were made prisoners. After this Kadan marched upon Varadin, which was easily taken and destroyed. The Mongols had some difficulty, however, in storming the citadel. Farther on they reached >S'^. Thomas, and then the great city of Perg, which surrendered after a week's siege. The Mongols forced the captive Eussians, Hungarians, and Kumans to take part in the assault. A few days later Kadan took the monastery of PJgresh. After this he probably joined Batu, but the annals are silent on the subject. The whole summer and autumn of 1241 the Mongols encamped in the plain of Hungary, without undertaking any military operation. The following winter, when the Danube was frozen, they crossed the river and attacked and destroyed the city of Gh^an ; but they could not force the citadel, which was defended by Count Simeon. The thaw which then happened obliged them to withdraw. But there was another reason for their retreat. While they were besieging the fort St. Martin, a courier arrived bringing news of the great khan's death, with orders for them to return to Mongolia. Thus the Mongols left Hungary in 1242; only one corps, under the command of Kadan, being left behind to pursue the king, Bela. The latter had quitted Thurocz
and repaired to his family in Austria. Thence he proceeded to Zagrab (Agram), where he passed the summer of 1242 ; but when informed of the approach of Kadan, he fled to Dalmatia, going first to Spalatro and then to Trail. Finally he hid himself on a small island situated near that place.
A
city of the Saxons settled in Transylvania. See note 771.



326 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
Kadan hastened through Sclavonia and Croatia, appeared at Spalatro, besieged the fort Clissa, and spent the whole month of March (it seems of 1243) on the seashore opposite the island to which Bela had retreated. After this the Mongols sacked the cities of Cattaro, Suagio, and Drivasto. Finally, Kadan went by the route of Serbia to join Batu's army.
The author of the Tarikh Djihan Kushai, as well as Eashid and other Mohammedan authors of the same period, term the Hungarians BasJikerds (Bashkirs). This
latter name, written also BasJikurd, appears for the first
time, it seems, in Ibn Fozlan's narrative of an embassy to the Bulgars on the Volga in the beginning of the
tenth century (translated by Fraehn, " De Bashkiris," &c., 1822). They seem to have dwelt at that time north of the Caspian Sea and east of the Volga, where the Bashkirs of our days still have their abodes. It was the generally adopted view in the Middle Ages amoDg the Mohammedans as well as in Europe that the Hungarians in Europe sprang from these Bashkerds, a people of Turkish race. Ibn Sayd (thirteenth century) quoted by Abulfeda (ii. 293—295), after mentioning the Bashkerds, an infidel people, dwelling north of the Pechenegs (thus the Bashkirs in their original seats), speaks of the Bashkerds, a people of Turkish descent, living on the river Duma (the Danube is termed Buna in Hungarian), in the vicinity of the Allemanye (Germans), and followers of Islam. After this Ibn Sayd notices the Hongross {Hungarians), settled on the river Buma. He calls them brothers of the Bashkerds, and states that they have accepted the Christian faith from the Germans. PI. Carpini calls Hungary by the same name as it is now known to us. On p. 667 he enumerates the Tartar princes who took part in the expedition to Hungary : " Ordu fuit in Polonia et in Hungaria ; Bati, Cadan, Syban, Burin et BuigQc, isti omnes fuerunt in Hungaria."



INVASION OF HUNGARY, 1241. 327
(Comp. notes 744 to 746.) On pp. 677, 708, he speaks of the Bascart (Bashkirs) near great Bulgaria (on the Volga), stating that Bascart is the same as " magna Hungaria." Eubruck (274) states that the great river Jagac (laik, Ural) comes from the country of the Fascatir in the north. From this country of the Pascatir, he says, came the Ktcns, who subsequently became the Hungarians. The idiom of the Pascatir is the same as that of the Hungarians. ''^^'^ Ibidem, p. 2 3 1 : " Pascatir que est major Hungarian There can be no doubt that the Hungarians were aborigines of Asia, and most probably they originally dwelt near the Ural Mountains, north-east of the Wolga Bulgars. These regions are called Ugra or Yiigra in the Russian annals, and are inhabited by the Finnish nation of the Woguls. Klaproth (" Tabl. Hist, de TAsie ") quotes from the Eussian annals a passage according to which the Eussian Grand-Duke loan Yassilievich (1462— i 505) in 1499 sent his army to the country of Ugra against the Gugidiclies (Yoguls), who were defeated, &c. In consequence of this, loan took the title of Prince of Ugra. There is over one of the gates of the Kremlin in Moscow
an ancient Latin inscription referring to that time, in which Joannes Vasilii is called Magnus Dux Ongarie (Ugra). The Hungarians arrived in Europe in the ninth century, and then called themselves Magyar (to be pronounced Modjor), as they do down to the present time. The Eussian chronicler IsTestor mentions their passing near Kiev in 898, and terms them Ugry. But the name Magyar was also known to other nations in the Middle Ages. Abulfeda (ii. 324) notices the Madjgars;
^^'^ Now-a-days the language spoken by the Bashkirs is a Turkish dialect. Klaproth thinks that the Hungarian language stands nearer to the Finnish stock of languages. But from Yambery's investigations into the subject it appears that the language now spoken by the Hungarians is a mixed language, in which the Turkish element prevails.



32.8 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
it would, however, seem that he applies this name to the Bashkirs in Asia. The name Madjar occurs also in Eashid's record. In the Chinese and Mongol annals of the thirteenth century the Hungarians are termed Ma
dja-rJh. I may finally observe, that there was also, in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a city of Madjar situated on the river Kuma, north of the Caucasus. It was visited in the fourteenth century by Ibn Batuta, and by Wadding (Yule's "Cathay," 401, 233). M. Polo's
Menjar" (ii. 492) is probably the same. A city called Modjary is spoken of also in the Eussian annals (Karamzin, iv. 176, 404). The Eussian Grand-Duke Michael, executed by order of Uzbeg Khan (of the Golden Horde) in 1 3 1 9 near Derbend, was buried in Modjary. It is not improbable that Madjar was a city founded by the Magyars, who at one time dwelt north of the Caucasus, but subsequently were forced by the Pechenegs to emigrate westward. The ruins of ancient Madjar have been visited and described by Gmelin, Klaproth, and
others.
The Tarikh Djihan Kushai describes the Mongol invasion of Hungary as follows (d'Ohsson, ii, 620):

" When the Eussians, the Alans, and the Kipchaks had been exterminated, Batu directed his armies against the Bashghirds, a considerable Christian nation who are said to border upon the country of the Franks. The expedition commenced in the beginning of 1 241, when an army of 400,000 men marched to make head against the Mongols. Batu despatched his brother Shiban with 10,000 men to reconnoitre the forces of the enemy. After a week Shiban returned, reporting that the enemy had a superior force. When the two hosts faced each other, Batu ascended a hill, where he retired for a day and a

INVASION OF HUNGARY, 1241. V-9
night without speaking to anybody, imploring divine protection. He had also ordered all the Mussulmans in his army to pray to Heaven. Next day the troops prepared for the combat, the two armies being separated by a large river (apparently the Sayo). In the night Batu detached one part of his troops, commanded by Shiban, to cross the river and attack the enemy ; but the attempt was unsuccessful on account of the great numbers on defence. The main body of the Mongol army tlien rushed upon the Bashghirds, and penetrated to the camp of the helar, cutting the ropes of his tent. When the Bash
ghirds saw the tent of their kelar falling down, they took to flight ; but only a small number of them escaped; the whole country giving way before the invaders. The vic
tory is one of the most glorious exploits of the Mongols." Eashid copies the Tarikh Djihan Kushai concerning the war in Hungary. Probably by a clerical error in Eashid's record, the name of the Bashghirds is replaced by that of the Polo (Poles). But farther on Eashid speaks of both nations, distinctly stating that though the countries of the Polo and Bashghirds are very large and have many fortresses, they have nevertheless been conquered by the Mongols. These nations, however, subsequently revolted, and in Eashid's time (about 1300) they were not completely subdued, having still their own kings,
whom they called kelarJ^^
Eashid gives yet another description of the Mongol invasion of Hungary (d'Ohsson, ii. 627), with reference, it seems, to Kadan's march through Transylvania, and the pursuit of Bela to the Adriatic ; but the events are confusedly reported, thus :

" In the spring of 1240 (rather 124.1) the princes crossed the mountains . . . and entered the countries of the Bular'^^^ and the Bashghirds. Orda, who marched on

the right flank, traversed the country of Ilaut, and vanquished Bezerenbam (?), who had ventured to oppose the Mongol army. Kadan and Buri entered the country of the Sassansp^ and defeated them in three battles. Budjec traversed the mountains of this country and entered the Kara-Ulag^''^ vanquished the people of the Ulag (Wallachia), crossed the mountains . . . and invaded the country of Misheslav (?), who was also defeated. The princes then marched by five different routes upon the countries of the Bashghirds, Madjars, and Sassans, and the kelar took to flight. The Mongol armies passed the summer on the rivers Tissa (Theiss) and TonJia (see note 781). Kadan moved out with his troops, conquered the country of Mahut (?), and pursued the sovereign of these
countries, the helar, as far as the sea. The latter em
barked at the seaport . . . and fled seaward. Kadan then returned, and captured . . . and . . . who had determined to resist, in the city of Ulahut. These events took place before he had received the news of the khan's death."
Chinese accounts of the Mongol expedition to Hungary, and even some details regarding the battle on the river Sayo, are found in the Yiian shi, in the repeatedly quoted biography of Subutai. After narrating the war against the Kussians (see above), the biographer continues :

" The (Mongol) army crossed the mountains Ha-tsa
inhabitants of which had formerly emigrated from their original seats, and had in the seventh century founded a Bulgarian empire on the Lower Danube. ''''1 Probably the Saxons in Transylvania are meant. As is known, the Saxons from the Lower Rhine had settled there in A.D. 1 143. Michov, " Cronica Polonorum," states: "Partem orientalem Hungariae, quam Almani inhabitabant, Gadan introivit et earn destruxit." 772 D'Ohsson understands that Transylvania and Wallachia were intended. ''^^ Evidently the name of the city of Trau (see above) is to be supplied.

Zi/""^ attacked the llu-lim"'''^ or king of the Ma-dja-rh^'^^
advancing in five corps by five different roadsJ'^'^ Su-but'ai was with Ba-du and commanded the avant-guard. The other corps were conducted by Hio-li-iuu^^^ Si-han, and Ha-danP^ The Jcie-lien being reputed for his
valour, Su-bu-t'ai had recourse to stratagem (i.e., he turned the enemy's flank). When the army had arrived at the river Huo-ning^^^ the corps of Prince Ba-du
crossed the river in its upper course, where it was shal
lower, and where there was also a bridge. Su-bu-t'ai, who had to cross it lower down, where the water was considerably deeper, constructed a bridge by fastening beams together. In the meanwhile Ba-du had been engaged by the enemy, and had lost thirty men, and one of his adjutants, by name Ba-lio.-tu, had also been killed. Ba-du began to get discouraged and proposed to retreat
;
but Su-bu-t'ai said, ' Prince, if you wish to retreat, I cannot hinder you ; but as for myself, I am determined not to return before having reached the river T' u-naJ^^
'^^ The Carpathian Mountains are obviously meant. I cannot, however, explain the name Ha-tsa-li. It may be that " mountains of Galicia " is intended, Rashid [v. supra) speaks of the same mountains mentioned in the Chinese record, but the name is illegible. '''5 Evidently the same as kelar of the Persian authors (see note 769) and ]celie of the Ylian ch'ao pi shi, i.e., hiraly, the Hungarian name for " king." The same name of Ma-dja-rh, denoting Magyar or the Hungarians, is found also in the biography of K'u-o-li-ghi-sze (Yiian shi, chap, cxxxiv.), whose great-grandfather, Ba-sze-bu-hua, is stated there to have taken part in the expeditions against the Kin-cKa (Kipchaks), Wa-lo-sz' (Russians), and Ma-dja-rh. '^^ Rashid also states that the Mongols, when marching upon Hungary, entered the country by five different roads. '^'^^ I do not know for whom this is meant. ''''^ Si-han and Ha-dan are evidently identical with the princes Shi-han and Kadanin Rashid's record and in Carpini's narrative. The latter states (667) that the princes Bati, Cadan, Syban, Burin, Buigec were all in Hungary. ''^'^ As will appear from the subsequent narrative, the river Sayo must be meant, although the name given to the river by the Chinese author has no resemblance to the Hungarian one.

and the city of the Ma-cJia.' '^^^ After this he advanced with renewed ardour, and Ba-du also rushed upon the enemy, who was defeated in the struggle, and the Mongol army reached the capital. Some time later, at a great meeting, Ba-tu ventured to reproach Su-bu-t'ai, saying, ' When we were fighting together on the river Huo-ning, I lost my Ba-ha-t^u owing to your tarrying.' Su-bu-t'ai replied, ' Prince, you know well that the river at the place where you crossed it was shallow, and you had also a bridge ready made before you. You have forgotten that where I was obliged to pass the water was deep, and the construction of a bridge was necessary.' At another meeting, when Ba-du had drunk a great quantity of kumiss and wine made from grapes, the same matter was again discussed ; but then Ba-du did Su-but'ai justice, acknowledging that the successful issue of the
war ao^ainst the Jcie-lin was to be ascribed altoo^ether to
Su-bu-t'ai. After the death of Ogotai, a great meeting of all the princes was convoked in the year 1243. Ba-du refused to go, when Su-bu-t'ai persuaded him, saying, ' You are now the eldest among the princes ; it is not wise to refuse.' Ba-du accordingly left next year to attend the meeting.''^^ When Kuyuk was raised to the throne in 1246, Su-bu-t'ai had arrived at court, and afterwards returned to his native country on the river

Pesth, the capital of the Madjars. 783 The Mohammedan authors also state (d'Ohsson, ii. 195) that Batu, after the death of Ogotai, refused to attend the great meeting ; for he was on bad terms with Kuyuk, who was about to be placed on the throne. Afterwards Batu consented to go, but did not carry out his intention ; nor did he ever again see his native soil. He died on the banks of the Volga in about 1256.

CONCLUSION. 333
K — Conclusion.
When the Mongols had left Hungary in 1242, they proceeded eastward, and remained several months in the countries north of the Caucasus, where some battles were fought with the Kipchaks. Eashid states that after passing a summer and winter on the road, the princes arrived
in their territories in 1243. The Ylian ch'ao pi shi speaks of a quarrel which had broken out at the time of the western war between Batu and some of the other princes. It is there stated that Batu sent an envoy from Kibcha to Ogotai Khan with the following report :

" By the favour of Heaven and an auspicious fate, 0 emperor, my uncle ! the eleven nations have been subdued. When the army had returned, a banquet was. arranged, at which all the (Mongol) princes were present. Being the eldest, I drank one or two cups of wine before the others. Biori and Guyuk were incensed, left the banquet and mounted their horses, at the same time reviling me. Buri said, ' Batu is not superior to me ; why did he drink before I drank ? He is an old woman with a beard. By a single kick I could knock him down and crush him.' Guyuk said, ' He is an old woman with bow and arrows. I shall order him to be thrashed with a stick.' Another proposed to fasten a wooden tail to my body. Such is the language that was used by the princes when, after the war with the different nations, we had assembled to deliberate on important matters, and we were obliged to break up without discussing the affairs. Such is what I have to report, 0 emperor, my uncle." Ogotai, on hearing this report, got very angry, and at first refused to see Guyuk (who had in the meantime arrived from the west) ; but when those around him interceded, Ogotai severely rebuked his son, and gave him to understand that the subjugation of some tribes of the



334 MONGOL EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST.
Urussi (Eussians), attributed to him, afforded no reason for boasting, the whole merit being due to Subutai. As to Buri's case, Ogotai ordered that Batu should apply to Chahadai (Chagatai, Buri's grandfather) for judgment. The conflict between Buri and Batu is alluded to also by Eashid (d'Ohsson, ii. 269). The Persian historian states that Buri, who had taken part in the conspiracy against Mangu Khan, was delivered to Batu in 1252, who ordered him to be executed ; and thus took vengeance on him for some injurious speeches once uttered against Batu in a state of drunkenness.
I may cite also what Eubruck reports with respect to this case. This traveller, who passed through Turkestan in 1254, says (279, 280): " Quesivi etiam de Talas civitate (see note 23), in qua erant Teutonici servi Buri, de quibus dixerat frater Andreas, de quibus etiam quesiveram multum in curia Sartach et Baatu. Mhil poteram
intelligere, nisi quod Buri, dominus eorum, fuerat inter
fectus tali occasione : Ipse non erat in bonis pascuis, et quadam die, dum esset ebrius, loquebatur ita cum hominibus suis : ' Nonne ego sum de genere Chingis Chan
sicut Baatu ? (et ipse erat nepos Baatu vel frater). Quare non vadam super ripam Etilie sicut Baatu, ut pascam ibi ? ' Que verba fuerunt relata Baatu. Tunc ipse Baatu scripsit hominibus illius, ut adducerent ei dominum ipsorum vinctum, quod et fecerunt. Tunc Baatu quesivit
ab eo si dixisset tale verbum, et ipse confessus est. Tamen excusavit se, quia ebrius erat, quia solent condonare ebriis. Et Baatu respondit : ' Quomodo audebas me nominare in ebrietate tua ? ' Et fecit ei amputare
caput."

EXPLANATION OF A MONGOL-CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA.






INTKODUCTOEY NOTICES.
An interesting specimen of mediaeval cartography, showing the geographical knowledge possessed by the Chinese (or rather Mongols), in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, of the countries west of China and Mongolia, has come down to us in the form of a rude map which has survived from a large work treating of the institutes of the Mongol empire and published in the first half of the fourteenth century. The title of this extensive work was King shi ta tien ; but it seems that now only fragments of it exist. The library of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Peking was in former times in possession of a manuscript copy of one chapter of the work, containing an enumeration of the stations on the post-roads in China Proper and a part of Mongolia. This now belongs to the library of the Eumiantsoff Museum at Moscow. This Chinese mediaeval map, which may serve as a pendant to the curious Catalan map of the year 1375, reproduced, as far as Asia is concerned, in Yule's "Cathay," bears
the title Yilan King shi ta tien si pei pi ti li fu, or " Map from the King shi ta tien of the Yiian dynasty, represent
ing the countries to the north-west (of China Proper)." I have seen two copies of it. One of them, in the library of the Russian Mission, was made, as the late Archimandrite Palladius informed me, from the original in the Chinese Imperial Library. Palladius, in his translation of Ch*ang Ch*un's travels, reproduces this map in Russian spelling, without however venturing any identification of the geographical and other proper names found in it. The other

copy I discovered in the first edition of the Hai kuo t^u chi (1844), ^ modern Chinese work on the historical geography of Asia.^^^ More than a hundred names of places and countries of Central and Western Asia, and even Eastern Europe, appear on our Chinese mediaeval map in Chinese characters ; and we shall see that almost all these names can be easily identified with geographical names occurring in the writings of the Mohammedan authors of that period, or in the narratives of European mediaeval travellers througli
Asia. At the end of the geographical part of the Yiian shi,.
in chap, xliii., there is an appendix entitled Si pei ti, i.e., " the countries to the north-west (of China Proper)." It consists of an enumeration of countries and places. Occasionally some descriptive details are added. Even a superficial comparison proves that the Si pei ti and the ancient map from the King shi ta tien correspond, the former being a list of the countries and places marked on the map. There are, however, in the Si pei ti some names of places which are omitted from the map ; and a few names appearing on the map are not found in the text of the Si pei ti. The map of Central and Western Asia from the King shi ta tien seems to be the oldest Chinese cartographical
^ The Hai kuo t'u chi is a book well known to European sinologues. Pauthier, in his **M. Polo," quotes it frequently. Stan. Julien, in his "Melanges de Geographie Asiatique," i. 124 seq., gives a long review of it, and explains the numerous historical maps of Asia found at the beginning of the work, with the only exception of that curious map which forms the subject of my investigations in the present section. He passes it over in silence, although it is the only interesting map in the book ; the rest of the historical maps the Chinese author produces being pure inventions of his fancy, without any value. The great sinologue was apparently puzzled to know what to say of this map ; and, indeed, when seeing it for the first time, without other indications, it is difficult to guess what it is intended to represent, all the more so as, according to our cartographical conceptions^ it is turned upside down. In Chinese maps anterior to the arrival of the Jesuits, South is always at the top and North at the bottom.

production extant. There is no doubt that the Cliiuese possessed maps of China, and even of the countries west of China, Central Asia, at a far earlier period. Stan. Julien, in his "Mel. de G^ogr, Asiat.," 199 seq., mentions several Ciiinese works of the seventh century, treating of Western countries and accompanied with maps. There was the Siti Si yii t\i ki, " Description of the Countries in the West, with maps," published A.D. 606, at the time of the Sui dynasty. A similar work, entitled, Tang St yii t*u chi, also with maps, was published a.d. 650. But these books have long been lost, together with their maps, and only fragments of them have survived in the form of quotations in other works.'^^^ The historical maps presented in the above-mentioned Hal kuo t'u chi are all of the author's own invention, and therefore mere nonsense, without any value. He used no ancient historical map, nor does he even mention the above-quoted ancient works on Western countries. Thus the map of the countries in the West, at the time of the Ylian dynasty, as given in the Hai kuo t'u chi, and translated by Pauthier in his " M. Polo," is not a genuine map of the Mongol period, as he seems to believe.'^^^ The Chinese mediaeval map on which we are now about to comment, although very interesting as an ancient document, has no high claim to correctness and completeness.
At first sicjht it is even difficult to realise that a ofeo^raphical map (in our modern Western sense) has been intended. We find no rivers, lakes, or mountains marked. The whole sheet appears covered by regular squares formed by straight rectangular lines. Each side of these squares seems to represent 100 Chinese li. Some of the squares contain Chinese characters, names of countries and places. Besides the above-mentioned straight (fine)

Neumann translated it into German in his " Asiatische Studien," 1837. ^^' Pauthier, however, does not represent the configuration of the original map of the Hai kuo t'u chi, but adapts it to our geographical knowledge. Tlie original map has no resemblance to the truth.

lines, we observe on the map also some thicker lines, stretching irregularly, and intended evidently to mark political divisions. Tims the map appears divided into three parts, each of the parts being provided with a denomination in large characters. In the same M^ay the list of geographical names in the Si pei ti is divided into three sections with the same headings as on the map, viz., the most eastern part shows the characters Du-lai fiemu-rh; the north-western division is marked Yile-dsu-hu ; the south-western, Bit-sai-yin. As has been noticed above, the map in question belonged originally to the King shi ta Hen, a work apparently corresponding to the Ta Tsing Hui tien of the present dynasty, which treats of the various institutes of the government. We find in the Yuan shi, Annals, s. a, 133 1, the following statement: " The Emperor ordered the members of the Kan lin yiXan (National Academy) and others to collect all the documents referring to the institutes of the (Mongol) dynasty, and to publish a work on the model of the Hui yaOy of the Tang and the Bung dynasties,^^ and to entitle it King shi ta tien." This is all I have been able to gather respecting this work. The date of its publication, a.d. 1331, or a few years later^ aids us in explaining the above-mentioned three names on the map, viz., Du-lai t"^ ie-mu-rhy Yue-dsic-bUj and Bu-saiyin, which can easily be recognised as the names of the Mongol Khans reigning, according to the Persian authors,, at the time spoken of in Turkestan, Kipchak, and Persia, viz.. Dure Timur, Uzheg, and Abu Said; ^^^ and thus we are

Pegolotti, who wrote about the same time, terms him Bonsaet. He is called Busaid by some Arabic writers and on some Mongol coins. The Pope, in addressing him, calls him Bmfssethan {i.e., Busain Khan). Comp. Yule, I. c. 299 ; d'Ohsson, iv. 716.

enabled to see that the map is intended to represent the three Mongol empires west of China, governed by the descendants of Chinghiz Khan. All the other names on the map, written in smaller characters, denote countries and cities situated in these tracts ; and we meet especially with such names as are mentioned by the Mohammedan authors in connection with the wars of that period. The greater part of them do not appear in the Chinese or Mongol annals, whilst others, spoken of in the annals, have been omitted from the map. If we take into consideration the time when this cartographical attempt was constructed in the Far East, and the great distance from China of the countries represented, we must of course be indulgent as to the topographical blunders which occasionally appear on the map. Apparently it has been executed in China, and that only from hearsay. Hence the relative positions of the places are not always in accordance with fact. It is remarkable, however, that the names, when compared with the same as given by the Persian historiographers, show as close an approximation to the original sound as the Chinese language is capable of expressing. It is needless to observe that the principal value of the map consists in
its high antiquity, and in the picture it gives us of the geographical knowledge the Mongols and Chinese possessed in the Middle Ages of the countries west of China. Before commenting upon the countries and places mentioned on the map or in the Si pei ti, it may be well to say a few words on the origin and history of the three great Mongol monarchies in the western half of Asia, which, together with the dominions of the Great Khan (Mongolia, China Proper, Tibet), formed the vast empire conquered by Chinghiz and his successors. According to the instructions given by Chinghiz Khan, his empire, after his death, was divided among his sons, Ogotai, Djuchi, and Chagatai. Ogotai (the third son) with the title of Great Khan, then reigned over China

Proper, Mongolia, Tibet, Auuam, &c. ; Chagatai (the second son), in Turkestan and Transoxiana , whilst the countries north of the Caspian Sea and around the lake of Khorazm (Aral), Kussia, with Poland, &c., had been bestowed upon Djuchi, the eldest son of Chinghiz, or, as he died before Ids father, these dominions fell to the share of his sons. This dynasty is generally called the Golden Horde (Russian annals), or Desht Kipchak (Mohammedan authors). The Khans resided in Sarai, on the bank of the Akhtuba, a branch of the Lower Volga. The author of the Tarikh Djihankushai (d'Ohsson, ii. 2) states that the dominions of Djuchi extended to the west as far as the soil had been trodden by Tartar horses. In the Ylian history (chap, cxvii., biography of Djuchi) we read that the land assigned to hira was situated north-west of the residence (Peking), and very far off. It takes two hundred days to reach that country when travelling by the post-road. Owing to this remoteness, it is very imperfectly known. Tului, the fourth son of Chinghiz, obtained by inheritance only an appanage between the mountains of Karahorum and the sources of the Onan (Onon river in Northern Mongolia), and also his father's private property. But after the death of Ogotai's son Kuyuh (Great Khan, 1246-48), Tului's son Mangio was placed on the throne of China, in 1 25 1; and thus the descendants of Tului became the reigning branch in Eastern Asia; Ogotai had originally his appanage on the river Imil, south-west of the present Chuguchak. When the princes of this branch revolted against Mangu Khan, they fottified their possessions. Kaidu, the grandson of Ogotai/^ subsequently conquered a part of Turkestan, and for thirty years disputed the suzerainty with the Great Khan Kubilai. The tract assigned by Chinghiz, in the distribution of

Jiis provinces, to his son Chagatai, embraced Mavar-annahar (Transoxiana), and part of Khorazra, the Uigur country, Kasbgar, Badakhshan, and the province of Gbazna to ihe banks of tlie Sind. Bishbalik, north of the Eastern T'ien shan (see note 157), was at first the head-quarters of tlie khans, which was subsequently transferred to Almalik (near the present Kuldja). At an early date, however, in the history of Chagatai's dynasty, the claims of Kaidu to the supreme khanship seem to have led to a partition of the Chagatai territory, for Kaidu held under his own immediate sway a large tract, the greater j)art of which belonged apparently to the appanage of Chagatai, over which Kaidu exercised superiority. It is not very clear what were the limits between Kaidu's territory and that of the Chagatai Khans ; but it may be gathered that Kaidu's dominions included Kashgar and Yarkand, and all the cities bordering on the south side of the T'ien shan as far east as Karakhoja, as well as the valley of the Talas Kiver, and all the country north of the Tien shan from Lake Balkash eastward to the Chagan Nor, and the country farther north between the Upper Yenisei and the Irtysh. During a great part of Kaidu's struggles, he found a staunch ally in Dua, the son of Borak, whom he had set upon the throne of Chagatai in 1272. After Kaidu's death in 1 30 1, his son and successor, CAa&a?',^^^ joined with Dna in making submission to Timur, the successor of Kubilai ; but before long the two former princes having quarrelled, Dua seized the territory of Chabar, and thus substantially reunited the whole of the original appanage of Chagatai, as it had been before the schism of Kaidu
(Yule's " Cathay," 522). At the time our map was constructed (about 1330), there seems to have been only one empire in Central

Asia, ruled by a klian of the lineage of Chagatai ; for the map, and likewise the Si pei ti, include all the places of Uiguria, Turkestan, Transoxiana, Kabul, Badakhshan, &c., in the empire of Du-lai t\e-mu-rli, by which latter name doubtless Dure Timur, a son of Dita, is intended. He was khan of the Chagatai empire about 1330. See d'Ohsson, iv., geneal. tabl. 2, branche de Tchagatai. The countries west of the Djihun or Oxus (Persia) conquered by Chingbiz were, after the death of the conqueror, at first considered as common property by his sons, and accordingly governed by mutual agreement (d'Ohsson, iii. 104). When, however, Hulagu, the brother of Mangu Khan, had conquered the rest of Persia and overthrown the Calif of Bagdad, in 1258, he was invested by his brother with the title of Ilkhan, and ruled over Persia, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Armenia. He was the founder of the Mogul dynasty known under the name of the IlkhanSy who maintained themselves in those countries, partly, at least, down to the time when the Great Timur or Tamerlane overran Western Asia, in the end of the fourteenth century. It may be concluded from the records of the Mohammedan authors that, on the west, the Chagatai or Middle empire was separated from the dominions of the Ilkhans by the Djihun or Oxus Eiver, and the boundary seems to be thus represented also on the ancient map. As to Abu Said (the Bu-sai-yin on the map), he was a descendant of Hulagu, in the fourth degree, and reigned over Persia, 1317-35. See d'Ohsson, iv.,
geneal. tabl. i. As regards the khans of the Golden Horde, or Desht Kipchak, who had their residence in Sarai {0. supra), their dominions were situated west of the Middle empire, and north of the empire of the Ilkhans. Our ancient map assigns them to Yite-dsu-hc, by which name evidently Uzheg is meant, a descendant in the fifth degree of Chinghiz Khan's son Djuchi. Comp. note 789. Thus we have in the first half of the fourteenth century, at



INTRODUCTORY NOTICES. n
the time when our Chinese mediaeval map was constructed, three great Mongol monarchies west of China. Nominally the khans of these empires owned a supreme head in the Great Klian reigning in China ; but practically they are generally considered to have been nearly independent. We know, however, from letters of the Persian khans Argun and Oeldjaitu, addressed to the King of France in 1289 and 1305, that they continued to use the Chinese seals of state which the Great Khan bestowed upon them (Pauthier's "M. Polo," yyy, 781). They stamped also the name of the Great Khan upon their coins, and designated themselves merely as daruga or governors (d'Ohsson, iii.
410). It is also worthy of notice that the khans of Turkestan and Persia, and even those reigning over the territories east and west of the Volga (Golden Horde), had their appanages in China, and that up to the fourteenth century, as we may fairly assume from the evidence I shall produce from the Yiian History. In the Ylian shi. Annals, 5. a. 1236 (Northern China then had just been subdued by the Mongols), we read
:
"The Emperor granted to the empress-dowager, the princes and princesses, appanages ia China. (They are all enumerated, and also the appanages. I shall only mention three.) Wa-lu-do and Ba-du (Orda and Batu, both sons of Djuchi) received the department of F'ing yang (in the province of Shansi); and Ch'a-ha-dai (Chagatai) received T'ai yiian (also in Shansi). Ye-lli Ch*uts'ai (Ogotai's minister) presented a report pointing out the inadequacy of such a management; whereupon the Emperor ordered da-lu-hua
cJii (daruga = Mongol governors) to be appointed over the land given as appanages, and that the princes and others should merely receive the revenues." A whole chapter in the Ylian shi (xcv., sui sz) is devoted to the pensions and revenues from appanages which the princes, princesses, sons-in-law of the emperor, and meritorious officers annually drew from the public treasury ; and there we find the

names of princes of all branches of Chinghiz Khan's house. ]n chap, cviii., under the head of chu wangj^^ we find again the names of the Mongol princes under different reigns, and their appanages also enumerated. Sometimes they are entitled waiiff (prince), sometimes ta wang (great prince). Wlien they had an appanage in Cliina, the name of it is prefixed to the title wang. Comp. note 791. To elucidate the question of the dependency of the Mongol khans of the Golden Horde of Persia and the Middle empire, I may quote some statements of Mohammedan and Chinese authors, giving an insight into the relations between these rulers and the Great Khan in China in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Vassaf records two embasssies from the khans of Persia to the Emperor of China. We read in d'Ohsson, iv. 320
:
In 1298 Ghazan Khan sent two ambassadors, the Melik Mo'azzam Fakhr-eddin Ahmed and Bocai Ilchi, to the court of the great Khan Timur, his suzerain. They carried with them magnificent presents, big pearls, and other rare things of great value. They brought also some hunting-leopards (comp. M. Polo, i. 384). . . Ghazan provided the ambassadors with a large sum of money to biiy for him certain productions of China. . . . They arrived at Taidu (the present Peking), and were kindly received by the Great Khan, who gave orders also to pay to the khan of Persia in silk stuffs his share in the imperial manufacture, which had not been paid since Hulagu had left Mongolia (1253). Ghazan's embassy remained four years in Taidu. The Yuan shi also speaks of an embassy sent by Ghazan to the Emperor of China, but records it a few years later than Vassaf. Another embassy maybe meant. We read there, Annals, s.a. 1304: "In the seventh month an embassy from the chu wang (prince) Ha-dsan in the Si yil (Western Asia) arrived at the court with tribute." Ghazan Khan
'^^ Chii wang means "princes of the imperial family." Even the khans reigning over Persia, Turkestan, and Kipchak are always entitled chu wauy in the Yiian shi.

reigned 1 295-1 304. This is probably the embassy to which ^lontecorviiio alludes in his letter of 1306 (see Yule's
" Cathay," 204). Montecorvino states in this letter that he had previously sent a letter to the father vicar and the friars of Gazaria by a certain friend who was attached to the court of the lord Kathan Cham (Ghazan Khan), and who had come to his majesty the Cham. The friend had taken the letter when returning from Canibalec (Peking) to Persia. The second embassy sent by a khan of Persia to the Great Khan left Persia in about 13 12, according to Vassaf (d'Ohsson, ii. 535). The Great Khan of China, Ayur hali hatra,'^^^ after his accession to the throne, sent two ambassadors, Ayadji Ciiinksank and Devlet Shah, to Persia. They arrived at Bagdad, where the Sultan Oeldjaitu spent the winter, in February 13 12, when they delivered the presents of the Great Khan with letters written in the kindliest terms. Subsequently Oeldjaitu (he reigned in Persia 1304-17), on his part, sent an embassy to the Great Khan. The embassy was charged with collecting the arrears of income which were owing to the Ilkhan from the possessions he held in the East as one of the descendants of Chinghiz. The annals of the Ylian shi record, s. a. 1 332, an embassy sent by Bu-sai-yin, prince of the Si yii (Western Asia) to the Emperor Wen tsung (Tob timur). The name of the ambassador was Ho-dji KHe-mad-ding (Kiiodja Kamareddin?). He brought as tribute seven precious stones and
other articles. Bu-sai-yin is Abu Said, Ilkhan of Persia, 1317-36, the same whose name appears on the ancient map. In the biography of Dju cKi , the eldest son of Chinghiz (Yiian shi, chap, cxvii.), it is stated that his dominions were situated very far to the north-west, more than 10,000 li distant from the capital (of China). One of his successors, Yiie-dsi-bie in 1336, sent an Embassy to the Emperor,
'** The Yiian shi writes this name Ai-yii-li ba-li ba-da. He was also called Buyantu Khav, 1312-20.

soliciting the payment of the money due for his appanage in China, namely, PHng yang (in Shan si), Tsin cliou (in Chili), and Yung chou (in Hu nan), this money being required for the establishment of post-stations to facilitate the movement of the troops. The ambassador also reminded the Emperor that the post-stations in Yue-dsi-bie's dominions were not kept in repair by the central government in China, but that he himself had to meet the expense. By Yile-dsi-bie evidently Uzbeg, khan of Kipchak, 1312-43, is meant. Comp. note 789. The annals of the Ylian shi record, s. a. 13 12, that the prince Ye-sien-hu-hua sent an embassy to the Chinese court. This is doubtless the Isseri huka of the Mohammedan authors. He ascended the throne of Chagatai in 1309. Ibidem, s. a, 13 15, it is reported that the people in the dominions of the prince 2^\t-li-tie-'mu-rh being afflicted with dearth, the Emperor gave orders to assist them with money. T*u-lie-t*ie-mu-rh here is the.same as Du-lai-fie-mu-rh on the ancient map, and Dure tiniur of the Mohammedan authors, khan of the Chagatai empire about 1330. See d'Olisson, iv. geneal. tabl. 2. Dure timur's successor was, according to d'Ohsson, Tarma shirin. In the Yuan shi, Annals, s.a. 1332, an embassy of the princes T\t-rh shi-li and Ha-rh-man to the Chinese court is recorded (by the first name Tarma shirin seems to be intended). They -sent as tribute fine Western horses, wine made of grapes, and gold-coloured ya-huP^ On the same page the death of the Prince Ye-sien fie-?mc-rh is noticed. Here probably Issen timur of the Mohammedan authors is meant, a grandson of Dua. See d'Ohsson's geneal. tabl. In the genealogical tables of the Mongol imperial family, as given in chaps, cvii., cviii., and xcv. of the Yuan shi, we find the pedigrees of the branches of DjucM and Chagatai and of Hulagu's dynasty in Persia. The greater part of the names found in these lists can easily be identified with the names of the genealogical tables drawn up by

d'Ohsson from the records of the Persian historians. I shall give the pedigrees of the above-mentioned branches according to the Yilan shi. There is some confusion in the Chinese list regarding the degree of kindred. In Djuchi's biography, chap, cxvii., some of his grandsons and great-grandsons are erroneously represented as his sons. I may observe that Piano Carpini, in his narrative, gives also a list of the Mongol princes of the house of Chinghiz. See notes 742 to 747.

Tu'fu meng-Uo, prince {wang). Tuda Mangu, 1280-87, grandson of Batu (d'Ohsson).
Tu't^u, prince of Ning su. Tuctuca, 1291-1312, son of Mangu timur (d'Ohsson), Ning su wang, as he is entitled in the Chinese table, was probably an honorific title bestowed upon this prince by the Emperor of China ; for there was no place called Ning su in China.
K^iian-sa, entitled likewise Ning su luang. This name is not found in d'Ohssou's table of the khans of Kipchak. Perhaps the Concki of "M. Polo," ii. 478, is intended, the head of the White Horde, called also Kubinji. See Howorth's ''Mongols," ii. 217.

Thus in this Chinese list almost all the reigning khans of the Golden Horde (Kipchak) are enumerated, down to the middle of the fourteenth century. Batu had many brothers. The Mohammedan authors mention 07\kt, Tangut, Shihan, ShinJair, Barkai. Toka timur. .Orda is called Wa-lu-do in the Yiian shi. Shiban's name is there written Si-ban (see note 746). The Mohammedan authors report (d'Ohsson, ii. 251) that when Maiigu was elected Great Khan, Batu sent his brothers Barkai and Toka timur to attend, this solemnity. We read in the annals of the Yuan slii, s. a. 125 1, regarding the same matter: "At the great meeting on the river Wa-nan (Onon), in the sixth month, the princes of the western side were represented by Bie-rh-Tco and Tu-ha t* ic-mu-rh'*

INTRODUCTORY NOTICES. 17
It seems that only the first four names of this Chinese genealogical table refer to the reigning branch of the Chagatai lineage. As to .the rest of the names, I find no corroboration in d'Ohsson's list. But, as has been noticed above, Dua, the son of Borak, Issen buka, Dure timur, and Tarma shirin, all sons of Dua and reigning khans of the Middle empire in the first half of the fourteenth century, according to the Mohammedan authors, are mentioned in other chapters of the Yuan shi.
BRANCH OF HU-LIE-WU.
Hvlagu, Ilkhan of Persia, 1258-65. See note 281.
A-lo.-ha, prince (wang). Abaca, 1265-82, son of Hulagu.
A-hi-hun, great prince (ta wang). Argun, 1284-91, son of Abaka (d'Ohsson). In the biography of Ai-sie, Yiian shi, chap, cxxxiv., it is stated that Ai-sie was sent with a message to A-lu-hun, prince in the north-west. In the annals of the Yuan shi, 3. a. 1284, this name reads A-rh-hun.
Ha-dsan, prince of Tsing yiian (in Ho nan). Ghazan KhaUy 1295-1304, the son of Argun (d'Ohsson).
The rest of the names in this Chinese genealogical table cannot be identified with the names of the Persian khans in d'Ohsson's list. Probably the Yiian shi gives the names of a lateral branch of Hulagu's descendants. Thus the name of Ahu Said, Ilkhan of Persia, 1317-35, repeatedly mentioned in other chapters of the Yiian shi (see above), does not appear in the genealogical table of Hulagu's lineage.

I may observe that the map appended to this chapter is a reproduction of the original Chinese map. I have only omitted the fine rectangular lines, not the thicker lines indicating the political division. The centres of the places (squares), where in the original the Chinese characters representing the names appear, have been marked on my map by points. The names are written in European spelling. Besides this, my map is presented, for the convenience of European readers, upside down, i.e., North is at the top.

Countries and Places East and South of the Middle Empire (Chagatai).
As the Si pei ti enumerates only countries and cities belonging to the three empires of the descendants of Chagatai, Djuchi, and Hulagu, the following six names of the ancient map are omitted from the list given in that
note.
SEA CHOU.
Sha chou means "sand city" or "sand district" in Chinese. This name dates from Aj). 622, when it was founded by the first emperor of the T'ang dynasty. But there was at the same place, or near it, an important outpost of China even in the second century B.C. The Han Emperor Wu ti, B.C. in, established there, west of the gate Kia yil kuan in the Great Wall, and at the eastern border of the sandy desert known to the Chinese from remote time as Ziic sha (moving sand), a fortified town and a district called Tun huang. This was the starting-point of



SHA CHOU. 19
the early expeditions of the Chinese towards the West. The Chinese Buddhist monk Huan tsang, as is recorded by his biographer, on his way from China to Central Asia in A-D. 629, after passing Kvai chou (see note 998), arrived at Tun huang. But in the itinerary of his homeward journey, sixteen years later, the name of Sha chou appears instead of Tun huang. In the eighth century, Sha chou was captured by the Tibetans; subsequently the Uigurs of Kan chou seized the district of Sha chou. In the eleventh •century it belonged to the Hia or Tangut empire, and -after the destruction of this kingdom by the Mongols in 1227, and the foundation of the Mongol-Chinese empire, Sha chou became a " lu" or department in the province of Kan su. M. Polo, when proceeding from the city of Lop to China, passed through Sha chou. He states (L 206)
:
" After you have travelled thirty days through the desert
"
(the " moving sands " of the Chinese), " you come to a city called Sachiu, lying between north-east and east ; it belongs to the Great Kaan." In ancient times the great highway from China to Central Asia passed through Sha chou, and not only the Lopnor route taken by M. Polo, but also the northern route leading through Hami touches Sha chou, as may be proved from ancient, and even more recent, Chinese
itineraries. At the time of the Ming dynasty, Sha chou was an important military station. In the last century the name of Sha chou was changed again into its original name Tun Jiicang, which now-a-days is a district city in the province of Kan su. General Przewalsky was the first European traveller who, since the time of the Jesuit missionaries, visited the oasis of Sha chou in 1879. He informs us (" Tibet," 93) that Sha chou is also called Tun huang. The great Chinese map of the empire, however, places ancient Sha chou about 100 li south-west of Tun huang. But this -seems to be an error (see note 998).



20 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
KO-MU-LI=KAM.\JL, KAMI.
This is without doubt the Camul of M. Polo. That
traveller states (i. 212) that this province, with the chief
city of the same name, lies between two deserts—the great desert of Lop, and on the other side a smaller desert. It belongs to the great Caan. Eashid-eddin, who wrote about the close of the thirteenth century, when the Middle empirewas for the greater part in the possession of Kaida, then engaged in a struggle with Kubilai, records (d'Ohsson, ii. 640) that Karakhodjo (see farther on), a city of the Uigurs, lies between the two states and maintains neutrality. Our ancient map locates Ko-mu-li east of the Middle empire, but close to the frontier. Karakhodjo is placed there,, west of Ko-mu-li, inside the Middle empire. M. Polo is the first Western author who mentionsKamul, but he did not himself visit the place. Marignolli was in Kamul in 1342, and seems to have spent some considerable time there. This city appears to have been the see of a Nestorian bishop in the thirteenth century (Yule's " Cathay," 390 ; " M. Polo," i. 213). It reads Camull on the Catalan map. Kamul is the Turkish name of the place; the Mongolscall it Khamil (Potanin, Mongolia) ; the Chinese, Ha-mi,. Tliis latter name, however, appears for the first time in the Chinese annals not earlier than the Mongol period. In ancient times this fertile oasis was known to the Chinese by other names. It is first mentioned in Chinese history in the first century of our era under the name of I'WU-lu or I'Vm. In the history of the posterior Han dynasty, chap, cxviii., article Si yu (Western countries), it
is stated that I-wu-lu is an important place, situated in a fertile country 1000 li north of the fortress of Yil men huaUy and represents the key to the Si yli. This oasis belonged originally to the Hiung-nu^ the ancient inhabitants of Mongolia. It was taken by the Chinese a.d. 73, who then established military colonies there. Some cen



TA SHBA LIK—TIBET. 21
turies later it was again occupied by the Turkish tribes of Mongolia. At the time of the T'ang dynasty, in the seventh And eighth centuries, I-wu-lu was subject to China, and its name was then changed into / chou. Thus the place is called in the narrative of Wang Yen te, who, in A.D. 981, was sent by a Chinese emperor of the Sung dynasty to the Uigurs of Kao chang, who at that time ruled also over Hami. In the Yuan shi we first meet with the present Chinese name of the place, Ha-mi. This name is found in chap. cxxii., biography of the Uigur Prince Ba-rh-dju. But more generally the Ylian shi writes the name Ho-mi-li or JCo-mi-li. See Annals, ,9. a. 1286. The Emperor bestowed money and cattle upon the impoverished people of Ko^li-li and Ha-la-ho-djo (Karakhodjo). Suh anno 1289, the people of Ko-mi-li are stated to have been again afflicted with dearth. The Emperor then ordered corn to be sent irom the province of Kan su to Ko-mi-li.
T'A-Sm-BA-LI=TA^liBALlK.
The Chinese name is probably intended for Tashhalik^ meaning " stone city " in Turkish. The place is marked on the ancient map east of Kamul. I have not been able to trace this name in any Western or Eastern author as applied to a city near Kamul. I may, however, observe that the above-quoted traveller, Wang Yen te, a.d. 981, proceeding from China to Kao chang, before arriving at I chou (Kamul) passed through Siao Sin chou or "Little Stone City."
rU-BO.TE=TlBET.
The names we use in Europe to designate the mountainous country bordering upon China Proper on the west, Tibet, Tuhet, Tebet, are all apparently derived from the Arabic ; for the name of Tibet among Western authors first occurs in the Eastern Travels of the Arab merchant Soleyman, who visited, according to Reinaud, China in the middle of



22 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
the nintli century. In the same century the Arab geographer Ibn Khurdadbih states that China is bounded by the sea, by Tibet, and by the country of tlie Turks. Masudi (beginning of the tenth century) frequently mentions Tibet.
Now-a-days this latter name is unknown to the natives of Tibet, who call their country Bot, which is also the Indian name for Tibet. But Markham, in his " Missions to Tibet,'*' p. 136 note, is wrong in stating that Tibet is a Persian word. As will be shown in the sequel, this name was^ known at an early date to the eastern and northern neighbours of the Tibetans, and the Arab travellers heard it evidently first in China. It would seem that in ancient times the Tibetans themselves applied this name to their country. The most detailed accounts of the early history of Tibet are to be found in the histories of the Chinese dynasties* Father Hyacinth in his history of Tibet and Kukonor, in Kussian, 2 vols, and a map, 1833, ^^s translated from the Chinese annals all the historical records regarding the Tibetans and Tanguts ; but his translation concludes M'ith the beginning of the twelfth century. In 1880 my friend S. W. Bushell, M.D., translated, in the Journal B. A. Soc.y the chapters referring to Tibet in the history of theT*ang dynasty, A.D. 618-907. In the early historical records of the Chinese, the foreign tribes living west of China Proper are comprised in the general name K%ang or Si KHang (Western K'iang). These names occur in the Chinese classics. Since the seventh century Tibet has been termed Tu-fan in the Chinese annals. This name in the history of the T*ang is applied to a powerful kingdom bordering upon China on the west, which during the T*ang period caused much trouble to the empire. It is said there that the T*u-fan people originated from the KHang. The character fan in the above name^ as first shown by E^musat, ought properly to be read po, being written with a phonetic, which has the two sounds



TA SHBA LIK—TIBET. 23
fan and jpo. This is confirmed by an inscription in Tibetan and Chinese from a stone monument at Lhassa of the year 822, of which Bushell gives a facsimile, and in which Bod is rendered in Chinese by the same character Fan. Tu-fan is therefore equivalent to Tuhod. In the history of the Sung dynasty, which ruled over the greater part of China, 960-1280, the name T*u-fan is still used, but in the history of the Liao in Northern China, 916-1125, it is recorded that in 1047 ^^ envoy from the kingdom of T*ie-bu-te arrived at the court of the Liao to solicit help against the Ilia (Tangut empire). Sub anno 1060 v/e read that the Liao emperor gave a princess to be married to the son of the sovereign of T'^vr-bo-t^e. The same event is reported in the Sung history, where tliat kingdom is called T'u-fan. To the Mongols Tibet was known in the Middle Ages under the name of Tubot. In the Mongol text of the
Yuan ch*ao pi shi (Pallad. transl., 148), in one case, the valour and fierceness of the Mongols are compared with. those qualities in the dogs of Tubot?^^ The Chinese translator (fourteenth century) renders " dogs of Tubot " by "dogs of Si fan." About this name see farther on. In the Ytian shi Tibet is mentioned under different names. Sometimes the Chinese history of the Mongols uses the ancient name Tu-fan. In the Annals, s.a. 125 1,
we read : " Mangu Khan entrusted Ho-li-dan with the command of the troops against T''u-fan." Sub anno 1254 it is stated that Kubilai (who at that time was still the heir-apparent), after subduing the tribes of Ylin nan,
entered T'^u-fan, when So-ho-to, the ruler of the country*, surrendered. Again, s. a. 1275: "The prince A-hc-chi (seventh son of Kubilai) led an expedition to T\o-fan." In chap, ccii., biography of Ba-sz-ba, the Lama priest who invented Kubilai's official alphabet, it is stated that this
Lama was a native of Sa-sz'-hia in T^n-fan. In the Ming period the name Wu-sz-tsang was applied
"^^ Comp. " M. Polo," i. 41, on the mastiflf dogs of Tebet.

to Tibet. This name appears already in the Yiian shi, chap, cxxiii., biography of Djao-a Tco-pan, and once more in chap. Ixxxvii., in connection with the Mongol troops cantoned there. Wu-sz'-tsang is a corruption of the joined names of the two provinces, U and Tsang, which form Central or Great Tibet (Markham, xxvi.). The north-eastern part of Tibet was sometimes designated by the Chinese name Si fan, and Hyacinth (l. c. ix.) is of opinion that in ancient tinjes this name was even applied to the whole of Tibet. Si fan means " Western barbarians." The biographer of Huan ts'ang reports that when this traveller, in 629, visited Liang chou (in the province of Kan su), this city was the entrepot for merchants from Si fan and the countries east of the Ts*ung ling mountains. In the history of the Hia or Tangut empire (in the Sung shi) we read, s. a, 1003, that the founder of this empire invaded Si fan and then proceeded to Si Zm?i^~ (Liang chou). The Yiian shi reports, s. a 1 268 : " The (Mongol) Emperor ordered Meng-gu-dai to invade Si fan with 6000 men." The name Si fan appears also in chap, ccii., biography of Dan-ba. Kegarding the application of the name Si fan in the Ming period and in our days, I beg to refer to the next
part. Eashid-eddin, in his account of China and other countries of Eastern Asia, notices Tiibbet, on the north-west of China (d'Ohsson, ii. 640); and in his History of the Mongols he mentions {I. c. i. 82) a country, Buri-tibet, to which Singun, the son of Ong Khan, is stated to have fled after his father had been defeated by Chinghiz in 1202. The existence of a country of this name is corroborated, not only by Piano Carpini (658), who records the conquest of Burithahet by the Mongols, but the name occurs also in the Ts*in cheng lu, where we read (Pallad. transL 176) that Ong Khan's son fled to the people of

£o-li fu-fan. As we have seen, Vu-fan is equivalent to
Tibet. Rubruck, after speaking of the Tanguts, devotes also a
few words to the Tibetans :— P. 289—" Post istos sunt Tebet, honiines solentes comedeie suos defunctos, ut causa pietatis non facerent aliud sepulcrum eis nisi viscera sua." . . . Ibidem, p. 329: " Thebet scribunt sicut nos, et habent figuras valde similes nostris." " M. Polo," ii. 33-44, has two long chapters on the province of Tehet ; and in i. 292 he speaks of the sorcerers of Tebet and Kesimur at the court of the Great Caan. Colonel Yule observes [I. c. ii. 38) that Tibet was always reckoned as a part of the Mongol-Chinese empire ; but it is not very clear how it came under subjection to the Mongols, no conquest of their armies being related by either the Mohammedan or the Chinese historians ; indeed, it seems that, with the exception of the above-quoted passages from the Chinese Annals, nothing more is said of the warlike enterprises of the Mongols against Tibet. I may finally notice that now-a-days Tangut is the common name by which the Mongols designate the whole of Tibet, although, according to Przewalsky's investigations, the Tangutans, the occupants of the country on the north-east of Tibet, in the Kukonor basin, constitute a distinct Tibetan-speaking race. As we have seen, these Tangutans in the Middle Ages formed an independent kingdom at the north-western frontier of China.
Tien-du is the name by which India was known to the -Chinese since the first century of our era, when Buddhism was introduced from India into China, See history of the Posterior Han, chap, cxviii. But a more ancient Chinese name for India is Shin-du. This name, evidently

rendering the Seins\s.nt Smdhu, meaning "river" (in tins case the river Sindh ; see note 704), which was taken for India, first appears in the Chinese annals about B.C. 120, after the expedition of the general Chang K'ien toWestern Asia, who reported on the country of Shin-du from hearsay. The Chinese authors of the Mongol period generally call India Hin-du-sz''(see Yiian shi, Annals, s. a. 1253) or In-du (see Part I.). These names they evidently borrowed from the Persians, who call India Hindustan,
K'I-SHI-MI.RH=KASRMm.
Eegarding this country I have only a few words to say. Kashmir became known to the Chinese during the T'ang period in the seventh and eighth centuries. In the T'ang History, s. a. 713, an embassy from K'o-shi-mi to the Emperor of China is recorded. Under the name of Kiashi-mi-lo this kingdom appears in the narrative of Hlian ts*ang about a century earlier. Kashmir is frequently mentioned by Eastern and Western travellers, and historians of the Mongol period. Ch*ang Te (1258) speaks of the Buddhist kingdom KH^shi-mi, north-west of In-du (India). K*ie-shi-mi-rh in the Yiian shi (see note 368) ; Keshimir in the Yuan ch*ao pi shi Compare also Kasmir in Piano Carpini, 708; Keshimur, "M. Polo," i. 175.

Countries and Places in the Empire of Dulai T*iE-Mu-RH (Middle Empire).
WEI- WU.RH=VIG\5'RB.
The country of the Wei-wu-rh or Uigurs is marked on the ancient map on the eastern border of the Middle Empire. The Si pei ii list has under the head of " Country of the Wei-wu-rh " a short note stating that in the year 1283 post-stations were established there in four places (cities), and also a treasury was founded for the



BISHBALIK. 27
exchange of paper money. A full account of the Uigurs has been given in Part II., to which I beg to refer.
^JJE:-*S//7-5^-L7=BISHBALIK.
We know from the statements of the Persian authors, as well as from Chinese mediaeval accounts, that there was a city called Bishbalik, the capital of the Uigurs. Sometimes the name was applied to the whole country of the Uigurs north and south of the eastern spur of the T*ien Shan, which comprised several cities besides Bishbalik, Karakhodjo (Huo chou), Lukchak, and others, and surrendered to Chinghiz. Bishbalik in Turkish means " Pen
tapolis," or five cities. In the list of places and countries in the Si pel ti we find the following note under the head of Bie-shi-ba-li :

In the year 1278 Ba-sordia-li received a tiger tablet, investing him with authoritj'- to direct the military
post-stations in Bie-shi-ba-li, the (other) cities of the country of the Wei-wu-rh (Uigurs) and in Tsz4i (a j;lace unknown to me). In 1280 the wan-hu (commander of ten thousand) K'i-kung-chi (see his biography, Yiian shi, chap, clxv.) was sent (by the Emperor Kubilai) to guard the
frontier at Bie-shi-ba-li. In 128 1 the prince A-dji-ghi'^'^ requested that thirty new post-stations might be established between the mountain T'ai ho ling ^^^ and Bie-shiba-li. In 1283 the Emperor appointed a governor for Bieshi-ba-li, Huo chou, and the other places (of Uiguria). In 1 284 the Prince A-dji-ghi sent an envoy to the Emperor with a memorial stating that among the twenty-four cities formerly under the command of Dji-bi-fie-mu-rh,'^^ there
797 A-dji-ghi was, according to the Yiian shi, chaps, cvii., cviii., geneal. tabl., a grandson of Chagatai, a son of Ua-la-hii-lie (Kara Hvlagu of Rashid). Adjighi is not mentioned by Rashid. 7*8 In the biography of Subutai the name T'ai hiw ling (Mountain of Great Peace) is applied to the Caucasus (see i. 297). I am not aware what mountain here may be intended. ''*" According to the Yiian shi, chap, cvii., geneal. tabl., this was » grandson of Ogotai, a son of K'uo-duan {Cotan of Rashid).

were two, namely, C/i'a and Dai, then governed by da-luhua-chi (Mongol governors, see note 695), and annexed, not to (the province of) Bie-shi-ba-li, but to K^ito duan (Khotan). He solicited tliat they might be restored to Bie-shi-ba-li, to which the Emperor acceded. In 1287 a military colony was established at Bie-shi-ba-li, formed of a thousand of the troops which had recently surrendered, to which also the commandership-in-chief for the whole country (of the Uigurs) was transferred. Bie-shi-ba-li is repeatedly mentioned in the Ylian shL This place it seems played an important rdle in the war between Kubilai Khan and the revolted Prince Kaidu. See Annals, 5. a. 1278, 1284. Sometimes we read in the Ylian shi, "Bie-shi-ba-li and the other places" {i.e., the other cities in the Uigur country, Kardkliodjo, Lu-gu-cli en, T^a-gu-sin, &c.). The term Wu-cKeng (five cities), which is a literal translation of Bishbalik, occurs also occasionally in the Ytian shi to designate this place or country.^ Compare the note on A-li-ma-li in the Si pei ti, where it is stated that 6000 li north-west of Shang tu (Kubilai's summer residence in South-Eastern Mongolia) is Wei-wu-rh wu cTieng (the five cities of the Uigurs), which at the time of the T*ang was called Pei fing (northern court), and was the seat of a governor-general (compare about Pei t*ing, note 157). The term Wu cJieng or Pentapolis is found also in the biography of Tie-Uo-shu, Yuan shi, chap. cxxxv. According to Klaproth's investigations ("M^m. Eel. k I'Asie," ii. 355 seq.), BisKbalik of the mediaeval author and Pei Ving of the T*ang period are identical with the present Urumtsi, a city situated on the northern slope of the Eastern T*ien shan.^^
^^ It may be the proper place to say a few words on the little-known city of Urumtsi. This is a Dsungar name, which appears first in the Chinese annals in 17 17. Compare the JSan chou tsi lio, a topographical and historical account of the three districts of ffami, Turfan, and Urumtsi. The Chinese write the name Wu-lu-mu-ts i. After the Emperor K'ien lung had conquered Dsungaria, in the middle of the last century, Urumtsi

Wang Yen te, despatclied in a.d. 981 by the Sung emperor T*ai tsung to Kao cliang or Karakhodjo (see the article on the Uigurs), gives in his narrative an itinerary which permits us to determine approximately the position of ancient Pei t*ing. The Chinese envoy, after crossing the desert, passed through / chou (Hami) and arrived at Kao chang (Karakhodjo). The king of Kao chang, owing to the great heat, had retired to Pei t^ing, and Wang Yen te was invited to meet him in his summer residence. The envoy traversed the district of Kiao ho, and in six days arrived at the entrance of the defile in the Kin ling (Gold mountain). Two days later he reached Han kia chai. From this station he went on for five days more, and then began to ascend the Kin ling mountain. When crossing it he had to endure heavy rain and snowstorm. On the summit of the pass was the dragon-hall, in which a stone was found with the inscription, "Little snowmountain." The mountain all over was covered with masses of snow. The travellers were obliged to put on winter clothes. On the next day the envoy reached Pei t ing, which was situated in a long valley, &c.^^i
became better known to the Chinesei We learn from the Si yil wen kicn lu (1773) that in 1765 the Chinese built a new city at a distance of eight li from Urumtsi, near Hung shan tsui (Promontory of the Red Mountain). The city was built on eight hills. Three thousand Manchus were settled there. The place was commanded by a Chinese general. In 1775 it became a district city and then was named 2'i hua chou. Urumtsi is situated in a fertile, well-watered valley. On the south-east of it rises the Bogda-ola mountain (see note 161), with its three snow-covered summits, known also by the name Ling shan (Divine Mountain). In the mountains west of Urumtsi coal is found, &c. Urumtsi has been astronomically determined in 1756 by the Jesuit Father d'Arocha(Peterm. Geogr. Mitth., 1880, p. 467). According to him, its geographical position is 43"" 27' N. lat., 27° 57' W. long. Peking. This place has frequently been visited in latter times by Russian merchants, but I have not been able to find anywhere a European account of it, besides a few words by Dr. A. Regel, devoted to Urumsti (Peterm. Geogr. Mitth., 1880, 209). Regel speaks of its picturesque situation in a broad valley between two mountains. ^^ In November 1879 Dr. A. Regel proceeded from Karakhodjo tO' Urumtsi (see note 800). The distance between these places is, according

Ill the days of Chinghiz and his successors the great highway from Mongolia to Western Asia passed through Bishbalik. Thus this place is mentioned by Ch'ang ch'un in 122 1 as a city on the northern slope of the T*ien shan. He was told that ancient Pei t'ing occupied the same site. Two years earlier Ye-lli Ch*uts*ai, who accompanied Chinghiz on his expedition to Western Asia, had passed through Bishbalik. He states that Huo chou (Karakhodjo) lies 500 li south, of this place. King Haithon's route likewise led through Beshhaligh. PI. Carpini, Ptubruck, M. Polo do not mention Bishbalik, although the first two of these mediaeval travellers probably saw the capital of the Uigurs. The name of Bishbalik appears in Ibn Batuta's narrative (Yule's "Cathay," 506). He states that when he iirrived at Khanbalik (1346) the khan was absent, for he liad gone forth to fight Firuz, the son of his uucle, who had raised a revolt against him in the territory of Karakoram and Bishhaligh in Cathay. The name of Bie-shi-ba-li is repeatedly mentioned in the biographies of the Yiian shi. Sometimes it appears under its ancient name Pei tHng. In chap, cxxiv. we read, in the biography of Meng-su-sz, that he was a Weivnc-rh, and that his ancestors lived in Bie-shi-ba-li ; chap.

EO-LA-B UO-DJO = KARAKHODJO.
Karakhodjo is frequently mentioned by Eashid as a place in the country of the Uigurs. Bardjuk, the Uigur prince, when he determined to submit to Chinghiz, gave orders to kill the Karakhitai governors in Karakhodjo
to his map, about 133 English miles. Regel had to pass, south of the Bogdo ola, the defile of Dabanshan, at an elevation of more than 4000 feet. Wang Yen te's journey from Kao chang (Karakhodjo) to Pei iing took fifteen days. His King ling pass may well be the Dabanshan. It is, iiowever, not quite clear whether Pei t'ing, the summer residence of the king, which the Chinese identify with Urumtsi, was really situated in that valley. Perhaps its site is to be sought in one of the more elevated valleys of the Bogdo ola. See note 161.



LURCHA K. 31
<d'Ohsson, i. 109). At the end of his account of Kathay Eashid states (d'Ohsson, ii. 640) that one of the bodies of troops protecting the frontier of the Great Khan is posted in the vicinity of Karakhodjo, a city of the Uigurs, which lies between the dominions of the Great Khan and those of Kaidu and Dua (the rebellious princes), and maintains neutrality. The Chinese name of Karakhodjo in the Mongol period was Huo chou (Fire city). Sometimes the first sound is also represented by another homophonous character; sometimes the name is also written Ho chou. In the Si yu ki, and also in the Si yu lu, Ho chou is stated to lie 500 li south of Bishbalik (beyond the Tien shan), and is identified in the latter narrative with Kao chang of the T'ang period (see vol. i. 16, 65). In the Yiian shi the same place is noticed several times under its different names. In the Annals, s. a. 1286, it is recorded that Kubilai ordered cattle and corn to be given to the people of Ho-lahuo-djo and Ho-mi-li (Hami), who suffered from dearth. Karakhodjo is further mentioned chap, cxxviii., in the biography of A-shu, who was a grandson of the famous Subutai. A-shu had been sent in 1286 against a rebellious prince, and died in Ha-la-ho-djou, The city of Karakhodjo still exists, 40 versts south-east of Turfan, according to Kegel, who visited this place in 1879. He writes the name Karagudsha,
L U-G U-CH' EN= LUKCHAK.
This name appears on the ancient map east of Ho-lahuo-djo. The history of the Ming gives a short note on
this place, calling it Liu cJi'eng (Willow city) or Lu cJien
(see Part IV.). At the time of the Han it was called Lm chung. It is stated in the " History of the Posterior Han," chap, cxviii., introduction to the section on Western •countries, that since the year a.d. 123 the Chinese military governor of the Si yil had his residence in Liiv

cli'ang.
It seems that in the repeatedly quoted narrative of Wang Yen te (a.d. 932) this place is also noticed ; for the envoy is stated to have passed through the country of Liu chung before reaching Kao ch*ang. Further details regarding this place, which is called Livk'O'tsin on recent Chinese maps (about 60 li south-east of Turfan), see in Klaproth's article, "M^m. Kel. k FAsie,"

TA-G U-SIN= TOKSUN (?).
This place is marked on the ancient map between Kamul and Bishbalik. I may observe that a place ToJco-sun appears on modern Chinese maps south-west of Turfan. It was visited by Eegel in 1879.
DJANG-BA-LI= DJAMBALIK.
This place on our ancient map stands west of Bishbalik, A city CK ang-ha-la appears in Ch'ang ch'un's itinerary (1221) west of Bishbalik. It was then ruled by an Uigur prince. The same city is mentioned in the itinerary of Ye-lli Hi liang. It is stated there that it was east of the river Mana-sz\ The latter name is still applied to a river and a city on the great highway from Urumtsi to Kuldja. Haithon, on his way from Karakorum to Western Asia (1254) passed through Djamhalekh, west of Beslibalegh,

West of Djambalik, on the ancient map. I have little doubt that this name has survived in the Khittukhai of modern maps, a town on the road from Urumtsi to Kuldja, between the former place and Manas.. Eegel calls it Kotuhy, I may observe that in the itinerary of King Haithon (1254) a place Khutaiyai appears between Djamhalekh and Yan kibalekh, of which I shall speak presently

A-LI-MA-LI=A.hUXlAYi.
A-H-ma-li, the Almalik of the Mohammedan authors, is frequently mentioned by the annalist of the Mongol era, as also by the travellers of the same period, passing from Western Asia to Mongolia, and vice versa. With respect to
this place, therefore, I beg to refer to the first part of my " Eesearches," where some particulars about A-li-ma-li, as given by Chinese travellers, will be found. As can be concluded from those accounts, ancient Almalik lay on the great highway from Mongolia to Persia, and was situated near the site of tlie modern Kiddja?^'^ It seems the Persian historians first mention Almalik s.a. 121 1, in whicii year Ozar, prince of Almalik, is stated to have acknowledged the supremacy of Chinghiz. This ])rince was subsequently slain by Guchluk, gurklian of Karakhitai. By order of Chinghiz, his son Sihiah Tckin succeeded him on the throne, and Chinghiz gave him in marriage a daughter of his son Djuchi. When the conqueror directed his host to Western Asia, he was joined by Siknak (d'Ohsson, i. iii, 212). We know nothing more about Almalik in the days of Chinghiz. Afterwards this place seems to have been the capital of tlie Middle Mongol Empire. The Tarikh Djihankushai states (d'Ohsson, ii. 100) that Chagatai, to whom this empire was

He was misled by the fact that the Russian fort Vernoye was built in 1854 at a place and on a river which the Kirghizea call A Imaty,

assigned by his father, had his headquarters in the country of the Uigurs (Bishbalik). In the same work we read that he was in the habit of spending the summer in the country of Alvialik, near the high mountains Gueuk ^^ and the mount Kut, whilst he preferred to pass the winter in Menizik Ila. Sometimes the residence of the khan of the Middle Empire is also called Oluh iff (d'Ohsson, ii. lOO, 107, iii. 1 19, 122). When Hulagu passed through Almalik in 1253, he was well entertained there by the princess Organa, the widow of Kara Hulagu, the son of Chagatai
{I. c. iii. 138).
In the second half of the thirteenth century, Almalik sustained an important o^dle in the struggle between the khans of the different branches of Chinghiz' lineage. When Kubilai ascended the throne in 1260, his brother AHkhuga (see note 281) laid claim to the crown, and collected troops in the north. After he had been defeated by Kubilai, he went with the rest of his army westward and attacked Algu, grandson of Chagatai, who at that time ruled over the Middle Empire. Algu had been allied with Arikbuga, but after the defeat of the latter had espoused the cause of Kubilai. Arikbuga's avant-guard, commanded by Karabuka, met the troops of Algu near the city of FtUad and the lake Sut (Sairam lake ; see note 476), and was defeated. Algu then returned to his residence on the river Hile (Hi), and disbanded his troops, when suddenly Assutai, one of Arikbuga's generals, at the head of another division, advanced through the defile called "Irongate,"^^ crossed the river Hile and

In book ii. 13, «. a. 1375, Timur's expedition against the Jetes in Mogholistan, it is stated that Kamareddin, the commander of the Jetes, was encamped at Gheuk topa (Blue Hills), situated, it seems, not far from the river Ab lie (Hi river), in which one of Timur's generals was drowned. In book iii. 9, s. a. 1390, we read that Timur's generals sent against the Jetes marched to Issighcul (lake Issikul), arrived at GkeuJc topa, and then took the road to the mountain Ardjatu and Almnlegh, near the river Ab lie. 804 Tjjg ^^if^i defile, north of Kuldja.

captured Alnialik}^'^ Algii retired towards Khotan and Kashgar, and when Arikbuga himself had arrived and had established his headquarters on the river Hile, to pass the winter there, Algu retreated to Samarkand. In 1264 Arikbuga made peace with his brother Kubilai. In 1266, after the death of Algu, Kubilai gave the uluss of Chagatai to Muharek Shah, son of Kara Hulagu. The Chinese annals record the war between Kubilai and Arikbuga, but not the struggle between Arikbuga and Algu. A-li-ma-li is for the first time mentioned in the Yuan shi, annals, s. a. 1277, in connection with the war against Kaidu. This war, which was continued for about twenty-five years, caused much trouble to Kubilai, who was obliged to maintain a considerable army at the northwestern frontier against his nephew. The expeditions against Kaidu are recorded in some detail in the Chinese annals as well as by the Persian historians. M. Polo also devotes a chapter (ii. 457 seq.) to the battles fought between the Great Kaan and Caidu. According to the great traveller, in the year 1266, King Caidu and another prince called Yesudar ^^ made an expedition to attack the Great Kaan's barons Chibai and Ghihan^^'^ sons of Chagatai, and defeated them. In 1268 Caidu attacked the Great Kaan's son Nomogan, and George, the grandson of Prester John, who were at Caracoron. The battle was without victory on either side ; but Caidu,

He gives a more intelligible version of the above passage. He writes the name of the river Hi, and translates : " Assutai, after passing through the Timur kahlakah (porte de fer), arrived near the river Ili and Almalik, and attacked unexpectedly the hordes of Algu." **"* The name Ye-su-da-rh occurs repeatedly in the Yiian shi. In chaps, cxxix. and cxxxiii. we find the biographies of two persons of this name. I am not, however, prepared to identify M. Polo's Yesudar. 8^ Perhaps M. Polo means by Chibai the prince Chi-bie-t'ie-mu-rh, who, however, according to the Yiian shi, was a sou ofO gotai. He is there mentioned as a general in Kubilai's army, and in connection with the war against Hai-du (Kaidu).

liearing that the Great Kaan was sending a great army to reinforce his son, retired to great Turkey and Samarkand. There are some discrepancies between the records of these events in the Chinese annals and those given by M. Polo, especially respecting the dates. The Ytian shi, in the article Si pei ti, gives the following note on A-li-ma-li and the expeditions against Kaidu :

The prince Hai-du had his encampment in A-li-ma-li and the other places.^^ Proceeding from Shang tu (Kubilai's summer residence) in a north-western direction 6000 li, one reaches the Five cities of the Wei-wu-rh (Bishbalik of the Uigurs). Four to five thousand li farther westward Mq^ A-li-ma-li, In the year 1268 Hai-du revolted, raised an army, and went southward (evidently a mistake for eastward). Shi tsu (Kubilai) repelled his aggression near Fei tSng (Bishbalik). Hai-du was pursued as far as A-lima-li, when the emperor gave orders to discontinue the pursuit. At the same time he conferred the chief command of the troops in the country of A-li-ma-li on the prince Fei ping wang^ The latter was assisted by the minister An-Hcng.^^^
^^ Kaidu's appanage was originally, it seems, at Kayalik (see note 813), a place mentioned by the Mohammedan authors, the CaUac of Rubruck. In the Yuan shi, annals, s. a. 1252, it is recorded that Mangu khan, after his accession, ordered Hai-du to live in the country of Hai-ya-li. ^^ Pei p'ing wang was the title of Na-mu-han, the fourth son of Kubilai, In the short biographical note devoted to this prince in the YUan shi lei pien, chap. xxx. fol. 16, we read that this title was granted to him in 1266. In 1282 it was changed into Pei an wang. ^^^ An-t'ung of the Yiian shi is evidently the Noyan Hantum of Kashid (d'Ohsson, ii. 452). His biography is found there in chap, cxxvi. He is stated to have been a great-grandson of the celebrated Mongol general Mu-hua-li (see notes 44, 47), the conqueror of Northern China. In the year 1275 he went with Na-mu-han, who was sent by the emperor to defend Ho-lin (Karakorum) against Hai-du. They then passed some years at the northern frontier, were made prisoners by the revolted prince Si-liTci, but finally returned to China in 1284. Detailed accounts of the treason of Si-li-ki and the seizure of Na-muhan may be read in de Mailla's '* Histoire de la Chine," ix. 389. Rashid's record on the same subject is given in d'Ohsson, ii. 452 scci. Si-li-ki (Shireki of Rashid), a son of Mangu khan, was in the army of Na-mu-han



ALMALIK. 37
It seems that in the expeditions sent by Kubilai against Kaidu, the armies of the Great Khan advanced sometimes to great distances. Thus in the biography of Yil-wa-sM, Yiian sbi, chap, cxxxii., this general is stated to have given
battle to Hai-du .in the country of I-bi-rh Shi-hi-rh.^^^ Vassaf states that in 1301 the united hosts of Kaidu and Dua met the army of the Great Khan some days' journey distant from Xayalik, which was on the frontier of the two empires (of Dua and Kaidu). There Kaidu fought liis last battle ; he was victorious, but died soon after. According to the Yiian shi, however, this battle was fought between Karakorum and the river Tamir (d'Ohsson, ii.
516). Mention is made of Almalik by most of the mediaeval travellers who traversed Central Asia. As to the reports of Chinese travellers respecting this place, they have been noticed in Part I. It remains to review the statements of western mediaeval travellers about Almalik.
when he formed a conspiracy against Kubilai. Na-mu-han and An-t'ung were made prisoners by the conspirators, who directed their forces towards Karakorum ; but the latter were defeated by Kubilai's valiant general Pe-yen. According to the Yiian shi, Na-mu-han was made prisoner by Si-li-ki in 1277, in the country of A-li-ma-li. ^^^ It is not diflRcult to recognise in this name Siberia. Rashid in his notice of the Kirghizes (d'Ohsson, i. 103) states that their country stretches to the great river Angara, which runs to the boundary of Aber Sibir. In the Yiian ch'ao pi shi we read that in 1206 Djuchi, the son of Chinghiz, subdued all the tribes who lived in the forests {Oriangutes sylvcstres of Rashid) south of Shiblr. Compare Quatrem&re's learned note on Ihir Sibir mh\% "Hist, des Mongols," p. 413. The Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) writes Sibir or Abir. Ibn Arab Shah (i. 45) states that Kipchak on the north borders upon Abir or Sibir. The Sebur on the northern border of the Catalan map is evidently intended for Sibir. J. Schildberger, who from 1394-1427 visited many countries of Asia, and accompanied the great Tamerlane in his expeditions, mentions a country Ibissibur. The ancient history of Siberia before these tracts had been conquered by the Russians is very dark. Regarding the origin of the name, we know only that there existed in the sixteenth century, on the river Irtysh, sixteen versts above the present Tobolsk, a Tatar city, Sibir, taken by Yermak in 1581, the ruins of which are still traceable. Subsequently the Russians began to apply this name, as a general appellation, to the whole of Northern Asia



38 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
In the narratives of Piano Carpini and Eubruck, a name similar to Almalik does not appear ; but it seems that Eubruck applies the name Organum to the country of Almalik (see note 285). Haithon, the king of Little Armenia, on his way home from Mongolia, passed through Halualekh (Almalik). Farther on he arrived at Ilanhalekh, and crossed the river
Ilan (Hi). Almalik in the fourteenth century was a Latin missionary bishopric, and, it seems, also a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church. There is a letter of a Franciscan missionary extant, dated SitArmalec, in the empire of the Medes (probably Imperium medium is meant), a.d. 1338 (Yule's
" Cathay," ccxliv. 231). Marignolli visited " Armalec of the Middle Empire " in 1 341, a year after the Bishop and six Minorites had suffered martyrdom there (1. c. 338). Ibn Batuta (about 1330-34) speaks of Almalik as situated at the extremity of Maver-al-nahar (Transoxiana),near the place where Sin (China) begins. In another passage we find Ibn Batuta observing that Almalik was the proper capital of the empire of the Tatar Sultan Ala-eddin Tar
mashirin^^^ (I. c, 503, 522). Pegolotti, in his notices of the land route to Cathay (first half of the fourteenth century), reckons a distance of forty-five days' journey with pack-asses between Oltrare (Otrar) and Armalec, and a journey of seventy days from Armalec to Camexii (Kanchou in China), I. c. 288. As has already been noticed in note 803, the name of Almalegh appears in the Zafernameh, book iii. 9, in the relation of Timur's expedition against the Jetes in Moghulistan in the year 1 390. Sultan Baber, who wrote in the beginning of the sixteenth century, in his Memoirs (i. i) speaks of Almalik

He reigned till 1330.



KARLUKS. 39
as of a city destroyed before his time by the Mongols and Uzbeks. That is all I have been able to gather regarding ancient Almalik.
THE COUNTRY OF THE KO-RH-LU = KARLUKS.
This appears on the ancient map north of Almalik. Evidently the Karluks are meant, who formed one of the sections into which, according to the Mohammedan historians, the nation of the Turks was divided. From the statements of Istakhri, who lived in the tenth century, about the Kharlekhie, we may conclude that they lived east of the Guzes, who occupied the tract between the Caspian Sea and the Sihun, and west of the Tagazgaz, who, as we have seen, are identical with the Uigurs. It seems that the Chinese annals mention the Karluks two or three centuries earlier. In the history of the T*ang there is a long article on the Tie-le, a people inhabiting Western Mongolia and Central Asia. (See note 596.) They were divided into many tribes, which are all enumerated. One of these tribes there is termed Ko-lo-lu, and said to be descended froto the T'u-Jcite (Turks). They lived in the mountainous country north-west of Peit*ing (Urumtsi), on both sides of the river P^u-gu-cKen. There are in their country many cross mountain ridges. In the second half of the eighth century they quarrelled with the Uisrurs, their eastern nei2jhbours, and extended their dominions fkr to the west. They took even possession of the city of Sici ye (on the Chu river ; see note 583). For further particulars see Hyacinth's translation of the whole article on the Ko-lo-lu in his "Ancient Nations of Central Asia," i. 437. "We have seen that, according to Chinese history, the Uigurs, after their dispersion by the Kirghizes in the middle of the ninth century, partly fled to the Ko-lo-lu
(in the west).

Rash id, who traces the origin of the Karluks back to Oghuz Khan, the progenitor also of the Uigurs, Kankalis, Kipchaks, and other Turkish tribes (Berezin, i. 19), says nothing about their abodes in the thirteenth century; but, as we may conclude from a statement of the Tarikh Djihankushai, they dwelt not far from Kayalik.^^^ It is tliere recorded (d'Ohsson, 1. iii.) that in 121 1 Arslan khan, chief of the Tui'k Karluks and at the same time prince of Kayalik, together with Ozar, prince of Almalik, both till then vassals of the gurkhan of Karakhitai, came to submit to Chinghiz, who gave to Arslan a Mongol princess in marriage.^^* In the Ylian shi, annals, s. a. 12 11, it is stated that A-silan Han, from the Si yil (western countries), the chief of the tribe Ha-la-lu, surrendered to Chinghiz. In the Yuan ch*ao pi shi we read (Pallad. transl. 130) : Chinghiz sent Kubilai to subdue the people of the Kharhmt (Mongol plural form of Kharht); but their chief, Arselan, surrendered voluntarily, and presented himself to Chinghiz, who gave him one of his daughters in marriage. The same is recorded in about the same terms by Eashid (Berezin, i. 132): "In the days of Chinghiz, the chief of the Karluks was Arslan khan. Chinghiz sent Kiibilai noyen, of the tribe Berulas^^^ to subdue the Karluks, but Arslan surrendered voluntarily ; when Chinghiz gave him a princess of his house in marriage, and granted
'''^ Kayalih is mentioned by Vassaf in connection with the battle fought iTi 1 30 1 between the army of Kubilai and the united forces of Kaidu and Dua (d'Ohsson, ii. 516). It is the Cailac of Rubruck (281). Colonel Yule (" Cathay," ccxiii.) thinks that this city was situated near the modern city of Kopal. It is an interesting fact, noticed in the "Trans. Russ. Geogr. Soc," 1867, i. 290, that in a tumulus (kurgan) in Kopal an ancient gold ring with precious stones was found by a Tatar in 1857. It bore the inscription "Arslan," in Turkish letters. Kegarding the Chinese name for Kayalik, comp. note 808. ^^* The marriage of A-rU-sz' -Ian with a Mongol princess is also recorded in the Yiian shi, chap, cix., table of the princesses. ^^5 In the Yiian shi, chap. cvii.

him the title Sart,^^^ i.e. Tadjik, observing that it was im
possible to leave him the title Arslan khan." I have no doubt that the Corola, mentioned by PI. Carpini, 709, among the nations subdued by the Mongols, are the Karluks. In the Yiian shi the Karluks are generally termed Hala-lu. In chap, cxxxiii., biography of Ye-han di-ghin, the name is written Hia-la-lu. Ye-han di-ghin, who was a general under Kubilai khan, belonged to this tribe. It is stated in his biography that his grandfather was in the country of Wa-sz-gien (Uzghend) with three thousand men, troops of the Hia-la-lu, when Chinghiz invaded Western Asia. He came to the emperor to surrender, and presented a great number of cattle and sheep. His son, the father of Ye-han, was called Ye-mi huo-dji. Ye-han's sons were Ho-na-cJii di-ghin and Ye-stc-sha. All these were in the service of the Mongol emperors. Sha-ts^ilan (biogr. in chap, cxxxii.) was also a Ha-la-lu or Karluk. His father, Sha-di, had been a general under Chinghiz, and had distinguished himself in the war with the Kin in Northern China. lu chap. cxc. Ha-la-lu appears again as the native counti-y of Bo-yen.
P'Cr.Z^ = PULAD.
This is the city of Pulad of the Persian historians, mentioned in connection with the war between Arikbuga and Algu (see p. 34), as situated not far from the lake Sat. Haithon, when proceeding homeward from Mongolia, passed through Pidad, and then arrived at the lake
Siithid (Sairam lake). Rubruck, when speaking of the Germans (Teutonici) in the service of the prince Buri, says (280) : " De illis

Quando veni in curia Manguchan intellexi quod ipse Mangu transtulerat eos, de licencia Baatu, versus orieuteiii (they had been before in Talas) spacio itiiieris unius mensis a Talas, ad quamdam villam que dicitur Bolat, ubi fodiunt aurum et fabricant arma, unde non potui ire nee redire per eos." Kashid-eddin, enumerating the countries and places inhabited by Turk tribes, also mentions Pida (Berezin, i. 2). The Chinese mediaeval travellers through Central Asia mention the same place in "the same regions. Ye-lil CJiu ts^ai passed, in the suite of Chinghiz, through the city oi'Bu-la, north of the Yin shan mountains, on the top of which was a lake (the Sairam lake). In the itinerary of Ve-lii Hi Hang the name of the same city, Bu-la, appears again. The city of Bo-lo, to wliich Chiang Te came
before crossing the defile THe^mic-rh ts^an-cJia (in the Talki mountains, north of Kuldja), seems also to be identical with Pulad (see i. 17, 125, 162). This place was situated evidently on the great highway from Mongolia to Persia, not very far from lake Sairam, perhaps in the fertile valley of the river Boro tola, which discharges itself into the Ebinor. The ancient Chinese map places P*u-la between Almalik and Emil, near or in the country of the Karluks.
TE-MI'SHI = EMlL (IMTL).
Ye-mi-shi is placed on the ancient map north-east of Pulad, and I feel no hesitation in identifying it with Emil or Imil, the name of .a river and a city repeatedly mentioned by the Chinese as well as by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period. There can be no doubt
that the character shi in the Chinese name on the map is a misprint or a clerical error; for the Yuan shi writes the name Ye-mi-li. There is still a river Emil, south of Chuguchak, emptying itself into lake Alak kul. The



EMIL. 43
valley of this river is famed for its pastures, and, as I have been informed by Eussian travellers, traces of ancient settlements can be seen there. We know from the Tarikh Djihankushai that the Karakhitai, on their peregrinations to the west in about 1 1 22, founded a city in the country of Imil (see
L 226). PI. Carpini writes (648) : " In terra autem praedictorum Kara-kitaorum Occoday-can filius Cliinghis-can, postquani positusfuit imperator, quandam civitatem jedificavit, quam Oniyl appellavit." Ibidem (751): "Deinde terram nigrorum Kitaorum fuimus ingressi ; in qua tantum de novo unam civitatem sedificaverunt, quae Omyl appellatur; ubi Imperator domum sedificavit, in qua vocati fuimus ad bibendura." According to the Tarikh Djihankushai, Ogotai, tlie third son of Chinghiz, had his appanage on the river Imil}^'^ The same work states that Ogotai's son Kuyuk (Great Khan, 1246-48), in the spring of 1248, set out for the banks of the Imil, his own special uluss, where he hoped the climate would better agree with the broken state of his health. But he died when seven days' journey from Bishbalik
(d'Ohsson, ii. 2, 234).
A place or country, Ye-mi-li, is several times mentioned in the YUan shi. In chap, cxxi., biography of Su-bu-tai (see note 689), we read that, after accomplishing the conquest of the countries north of the Caucasus, Su-bu-tai went home by the way of Ye-mili and
Ibidem, annals, s.a. 1252, it is stated that Mangu khan,
817 In the annals of the Yiian shi we read that after the death of Chinghiz, his son Ogotai arrived from the country of Ho-ho. It seems that Ho-bo was somewhere near Imil. At least in the itinerary of Ye-lii Hi Hang, a country Huo-hu is mentioned after Te-mi-li (Imil). 8^8 Imil is coupled here with Ilo-dji. I may observe that in the history of Tamarlane, the (summer) residence of Mogolistan (eastern branch of the Chagatai empire), taken in 1389 by Timur, is called Ay mid Guja. Zufernameh, iii. 5.

after his accession in 1252, ordered T^o-t'o^^^ to live in the
country of Yc-mi-li. The name of the same country appears in Ye-lii Hi Hang's itinerary (see i. 160, 161).
I-LI-BA-LI=IU.BM1K.
This name in the ancient map seems to represent IlihaliJc, " the city of Hi." It appears there south-west of Almalik. King Haithon, proceeding from Almalik westward, arrived at Ilan-laleh, and then crossed the Ilan
(Hi) river. This seems to be the only instance that any mediaeval author mentions a city of this name. The city was evidently situated on the Hi river, perhaps near the place where now the post-road from Kuldja to Tashkend crosses the river. There is on the left bank the borough Hiskoye.
YE-YUN-CHL
It is impossible to identify this name, which, on the ancient map, is placed west of Ilibalik. I may, however, observe that a similar-sounding name appears as that of a river in the Si shi ki. In this narrative a river, Yi-yiin, is mentioned in the country of the Karakhitai, somewhere in the region of the river Chu (see i. 1 29).
K'U-GH'A=KVCB.A.
Here the city of Kucha in Eastern Turkestan is meant. On modern Chinese maps the name is written K'u-cJie. The Chinese geographers identify it with ancient Kui-tsz\ a kingdom in Central Asia, first mentioned, before our era, in the history of the Anterior Han. Eashid records (d'Ohsson, i. 105) that Guchluk, the son of the khan of the Naimans, having been defeated by the
819 T'o-t'o, according to the Yiian shi, chap. evii. geneal. table, was a grandson of Ogotai, and son of Ha-Ia-cJia-rh. The latter is mentioned by Hashid (I. c, ii. 99) under the name of Karadjar. See note 742.

Mongols, fled through Bishbalik to Kiidja, to the khan of the Karakhitai. Under the article Sunit, liashid mentions a corps of the Mongol army composed of Uigurs, Karluks, Turkmans, and men from Kashgar and Kuchai (Berezin,
i. 46). WO-CH'I=\JCB..
This name is assigned on the ancient Chinese map to a place between Kucha and Kashgar. It may be identified with the modern city of Uch or Uch Turfan in Eastern Turkestan, west of Aksu, situated on the great highway from Kamul to Kashgar, south of the T'ien shan. On modern Chinese maps the name is written Wio-shi. The Emperor K*ien lung, who, after the conquest of Eastern Turkestan and Hi, in the middle of the last century, bestowed Chinese names upon the principal cities there, named Uch Yung ning cJieng. The Chinese geographers identify Uch with the ancient kingdom Yii fou mentioned in the histories of the Han. The Si yii wen kien lu states that the people of Turkestan usually call this place Uch turfan, turfan meaning residence. The ancient Chinese map and the list in the Si pei ti are, it seems, the only instances in which Uch is mentioned in Chinese works of the Mongol period. I may observe that a place, Ucli-ferman, is mentioned in the history of Timur's military doings in connection with the w^ar against the Jetes in 1375 (Zafernameh,
ii. 14).

Kashgar is often mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the Middle Ages. This name appears even in Firdusi's Shahnameh referring to the ancient history of Persia.



45 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
Abulfeda, 11. ii. 229, quotes with respect to Kashgar authors of the tenth and twelfth centuries. In the Tarikh Tabari, written towards the end of the tenth century, and translated by Zotenberg, we read, iv. 1 98, that in the reign of the Calif Soleiman, 715-717, his general Kutaiha (proceeding from Ferganah) conquered Kashgar, a city near the Chinese frontier, and sent an envoy, Hobaira, with horses and other presents to the king of China. Kutaiba had ordered the envoy to summon the king of China to submit, and to inform him that Kutaiba had taken an oath to tread upon Chinese soil. In return the king despatched four of his princes to the Arab commander-in-chief, and sent also a little earth from China, upon which Kutaiba might tread to keep his oath.820 We have seen (see i. 252, Uigurs) that, according to Ibn el Athir, who wrote in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, there was in Eastern Turkestan, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the dynasty of the Ilkhans, who ruled over Kashgar, Khotan, Yarkand, and even Western Turkestan. In the beginning of the thirteenth century, and probably already in the twelfth century, these tracts belonged to the gurkhan of Karakhitai (d'Ohsson, i. 170 seq.). In 1218 this empire was destroyed by the Mongols, who then took possession of Eastern Turkestan, which after Chinghiz' death devolved on Chagatai.
The Chinese geographers, and after them our sinologues, identify Kashgar with the country Shu-le mentioned in the histories of the Han since the second century B.C. In the days of the T*ang (seventh and eighth centuries) it was still known under the same name, and the T*ang shu states that the capital of Shu-le is called Kia-shi or Kasha, which name has some resemblance to Kashgar.
^° This seems to be the same Arab embassy to the Chinese court which is recorded in the history of the T'ang ; «. a. 713, however. The envoys brought as presents beautiful horses and a magnificent girdle, and refused to perform the prostration before the emperor. See my pamphlet on Chinese Knowledge of the Arabs, &c., 1871, p. 8.



KHOTAN. 47
In the Yiian shi, Kashgar is generally wriiten K'o-shiha-li. This name there is generally found coupled with Khotan (see the next) and Yarkand. Yarkand is repeatedly noticed in the Ylian shi The name is generally written Ye-li-Tcien there. It appears in
the itinerary of Ye-lii Hi liang, but has been omitted from the ancient map. I do not find it mentioned in the Ming history. Now-a-days the Chinese call ic Ye-rh-kiang, and identify it with the ancient kingdom of So-kil of the Han
period. M. Polo states with respect to the kingdom of Cascar (L 189) that it was subject to the Great Knan, and says the same regarding Cotan (i. 196), whilst Yarken (i. 195), according to M. Polo, belonged to Kaidu. This does not agree with Kashid's statements about the boundary between Kaidu's territory and the khan's. Kashgar {Kashimgar) was at this time a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church (" Cathay," ccxlv.).
HU'TAN=KYLOTK-^.
The earliest accounts of Khotan, in Eastern Turkestan, we find in the Chinese annals. In 1820 A. R^musat published a book, " Histoire de la Ville de Khotan, tir^e des Annales de la Chine," in which he brought together all historical and geographical information about this ancient kingdom which he had been able to gather from Chinese sources. I may therefore confine my remarks to a brief notice of the Chinese records regarding Khotan. In the " History of the Anterior Han," where this kingdom is first mentioned in Chinese works, in the second century of our era, it is styled Yil-t'ien ; and Khotan is spoken of under the same name in all the succeeding Chinese dynastic histories down to our own day. The first sound of the name is generally rendered by a character meaning "jade," and was chosen probably in allusion to the fame which Khotan has had from the most ancient



48 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
time for its fine jade, so highly prized in China. Yu-fien was visited by the Buddhist monk Fa hien^ A.D. 400, on his way to India. In the history of the T*ang the following synonyms for Yu-t*ien are given : Ku-sa-tan-na, Huan-na, and K^il-tan. The first of these names is the Sanskrit name of Khotan. Under this name it appears also in the narrative of Huan isang, in the seventh century. By K^il-tan the Turkish name of the place seems to be rendered. Besides this, the T*aiig shu states that the northern nomads are wont to call it Yil tun, whilst the western- people (Persians, Arabs) term it Huo-tan. In the Yuan shi, Khotan is repeatedly mentioned, but seldom by its Chinese name, Yii-fien. The Chinese historians of the Mongol period generally try to render the name Khotan, which was in use with the Mongols. In chap, cxx., biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, it is stated that when the khan of Karakhitai had been slain, the cities of K*o-shi-ha-rh (Kashgar), Ya-rh-Jcien (Yarkand), and 0-duan (Khotan) surrendered to the Mongols. Ye-lu Ch*u ts*ai writes the same name Wu-dioan, and adds that this is the same as the Yii-t^en of the T*ang
period (see i. 16). In the annals of the Yiian shi, s. a. 1274, we read: Thirteen water-stations (on rivers, of course ^^^) were established (by imperial order) between the two cities Yil-t'^ien (Khotan) and Ya-rh-lcan (Yarkand), and two land stations north of Sha chou. On the same page the annals state that the people of Yil-Vien were relieved from the onus of collecting jade (for the Emperor). Under the same year it is recorded that the emperor bestowed the sum of 100 Hang of silver upon each family of the 249 soldiers from Ho-shi-ha-rh, Ya-rh-k^'an and
^^ It seems that communication by water was established between Khotan and Yarkand. Both places are situated on rivers, affluents of the 2'arim ; or perhaps there existed a direct watercourse connecting these cities.

Wn-diian (Khotan), who had been killed at the siege of Siang yang fu and Fan clieng.^'^'^ Under the year 1271 Khotan is termed Wa-duan. Sub anno 1288 mention is made of a military colony composed of workmen from Ka-shi-ha-rh and 0-diucn. Khotan is repeatedly mentioned in the early history of Persia, as related in Firdiisi's Shahnameh. The Arabs, in their conquests eastward, never advanced as far as Khotan. As we have seen, Kashgar was the easternmost spot in Asia which the valiant Kutaiba reached, in about 715. In the tenth and eleventh centuries Khotan was under the rule of the Ilkhans (see Part II.). In the beginning of the thirteenth century we find the Gurkhan of Karakhitai in the possession of Eastern Turkestan. In 12 18, after the destruction of this empire, these tracts devolved to the Mongols, and after the death of Chinghiz formed part of the Middle Empire. We have already noticed M. Polo's statement that Cotan was subject to the Great Kaan in the days of Kubilai, which seems to be corroborated by the above-quoted passages from the Chinese
annals. The name of Khotan is frequently met with in the historical and geographical records of the Mohammedan authors of the Middle Ages. Khotan was famed in the West for its musk as well as for its jade. Compare also Klaproth's " Histoire de la Ville de Khotan," translated from the account of a Turkish geographer (" Mdm. Eel. k TAsie," ii. 281-301).

inclined to suppose that Titrkcstan is meant, the Great
Turlry of M. Polo (i. 198, ii. 455, 456, 460). Friar Benedict, who travelled with PL Carpini, states {777) • " I*ost terram Kangitarum (Kankali) venerunt Turhjam ubi primum invenerunt magnam civitatem Janckynt (Yanghikend) facientes circa decern dietas per eandem Turkyam : habet Turkya legem Mahometi. Post Turkyam intraverimt terram quae vocatur Kara-Kytai." The Turkya of Benedict is called the country of the Bisermans (see note 173) in PI. Carpini's narrative. In the Si pei ti the name T^u-ht-ki is put at the head of the places and countries comprised in the Middle Empire, which, as is known, embraced the whole of Turkestan.
A-TE-BA-SHI = AT-BASH.
This name appears on tlie ancient map north-west of Kasligar and north-east of O-dsi-han (Uzgend). A mountain A-fe-ha-sheng is mentioned in the itinerary of Ye-lli Hi Hang after Kashgar (see i. 163). At'hash is still the name of a mountain and a river in the regions of the Upper Syr daria, south of lake Issykul. The At-bash is a southern affluent of the Naryn, one of the rivers which form the Syr daria. The valley of the At-bash is famed for its fertility (Kosienko's '* Turkestan," i. 69, 70, 239). Baron Fr. v. d. Osten-Sacken, who visited the At-bash valley in 1867, has had the kindness to inform me that he saw there very interesting remains of an ancient fortress of strong appearance. A village Athaslii is mentioned twice in the Zafernameh, ii. 14, 7, in connection with Timur's war against the Jetes of Mogbulistan in 1375 and 1376.
O-DSI-HAN = UZGEND.
The place assigned on our map to 0-dsi-han or O-dsi-dsien, as the name reads in the Si pei ti, between At-bash and Marghinan, points to its position in Ferghana. The name has



UZGEND. 51
some resemblance to Uzgend, M'liich city still exists in the eastern part of Ferghana, Fedchenko was the first European who, in 1 87 1, visited this place. He found it in ruins. UzJcend seems to be first mentioned by Ibn Khurdadbih in the ninth century. He notices it as a city of Ferghana, which was the starting-point for the journey across the mountains to Tibet. As the late Professor Grigorieff proves in his "Turkestan/' 219, the Arabs meant Eastern Turkestan by Tibet. Istakhri and Ibn Haukal term this city Urkend; Wiv\s\ Cdll^ it Aderkend, Ibn el Athir states that Malek Shah of the Seldjuks in 1089, proceeded to UzJcend, whither the king of Kashgar repaired to render homage (De Guignes, iii. 219). From d'Ohsson's " Hist, des Mongols," it does not appear that mention is made by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period of this city Uzkeiid or Urkend in Ferghana. It is only on the map appended to the work, and containing nothing but mediaeval names, that a place Euzhend is marked in Fergliana. Besides this, the name of a city Ozkend is placed there on the river Sihun, below Otrar and Signak. This is the city spoken of in the Tarikh Djihankushai as having been captured by the Mongols in 12 19 (d'Ohsson, i. 222). Ozkend is further mentioned by the Mohammedan authors as a place where the gurkhan of Karakhitai had a treasury, which was plundered by Guchluk (d'Ohsson, i. 167). Ibidem, i. 182, we read that in 1209 Mohammed Khovarezm Shah invaded the dominions of the gurkhan, and occupied Turkestan as far as Ozkend. This city of Ozkend in Turkestan still existed in the middle of the fifteenth century. It is mentioned in the Tarikh i Abulkhair, together with Signak and Suzak, among the places of Turkestan captured by the Uzbeg chief Abulkhair Khan (Howorth, ''Mongols," ii. 6Sy). As to the city of Uzkend in Ferghana, I may finally notice that Sultan Baber in his Memoirs (i. 32, 226) states that Uzkend is the ancient capital of Ferghana.



52 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
The Ylian shi speaks of a city Wa-sz'-gien (somewhere in Turkestan ; see the article on the Karluks), which name sounds like Uzgend. Probably Ozkend on the Lower Sihun is meant.
KO-SAN = KASAK.
The position assigned to Ko-san in the ancient map permits its identification with the city of Kasan in Ferghana, situated, according to . the detailed Eussian map, on a small river of the same name, thirty versts north-west of Namangan. It seems to be an unimportant place now-a-days, but was one time the capital of Ferghana. The early Arab historians record (Tabari; see Weil, "Gesch. d. Chalifen," i. 503) tliat in a.d. 712 or 713 Kutaiba, the commander-in-chief of the Calif's troops, took the cities of Shash (Tashkend), Khodjend, and Kasan. Yakubi,. A.D. 892 (quoted by Grigorieff, '* Turkestan," 196), mentions Kasan, in the valley of Ferghana, as situated at the eastern boundary of the territories conquered by the Arabs. Kasan is spoken of by Ibn Haukal, Edrisi, Abulfeda (II. ii. 226). The latter quotes an author of the ninth century, according to whom Kasan was the capital of Ferghana and an important place. Yakut (beginning of the thirteenth century) says the same, but in his days Kasan had already lost its former splendour. We have seen that Ye-lti Ch'u tsai mentions a city K'-o-san, together with K^'u-djan (Khodjend), Ba-pu (Pap), and Ba-lam (Kanibadam), all cities of Ferghana (see i. 19). According to Sultan Baber (Memoirs, i. 9), who wrote at the end of the fifteenth century, Kasan then was a small place north of Ahhsy or Akhsiket, the capital of Ferghana,^^^
823 AkJmket, one of the ancient capitals of Ferghana, is mentioned by Ibn Haukal and other Mohammedan authors of the ninth and tenth centuries. See also Edrisi, ii. 210 ; Abulfeda, II. ii. 226. In the days of Sultan Baber {I.e.) it was still an important place and a strong fortress on the northern bank of the Sihun. Akhsiket was famed for its melons. It seems that now-a-days only the ruins of this place exist ; at least, it»

and situated on the same river which flows to Akhsy (i,e., which flows into the Sihun near Akhsy).
BA-BU =FAF.
This name appears on the ancient map south of Kasan, and is evidently the Ba-pu of Ye-lii Ch'u ts*ai, jnst spoken of. Sultan Baber {I.e. i. 238) notices a place Pap in Ferghana, situated near the river of Akhsy. On the Kussian map I find a place Pap, north of the Syr daria, on the road from Namangan to Khodjend. It lies about sixteen English miles west of Akhsy.
position is only indicated in the detailed Russian map of Turkestan southwest of Kasan, on the northern bank of the Syr daria. According to Baber, the river on which Kasan lies flows into the Sihun near Akhsy. Judging from the Russian map, the Kasan river dries up before reaching the Syr daria. I may observe that Ferghana seems to have been known to the Chinese since the days of the Han, when, in the second century B.C., Chang K'ien first penetrated to the countries beyond the T'sung ling mountains. Hiian ts'ang, in the first half of the seventh century, notices the kingdom of Fei-han, looo li south-east of Che-shi (Shash, Tashkend). It was then 4000 li in circuit, and enclosed by mountains on every side. The soil
was rich and fertile ; excellent horses, sheep, &c. A kingdom called Po-kan, Po-han-va, or Fa-han-na (Ferghana) is mentioned in the same p2riod in the T'ang history, and even as early as the sixth centiu-y (Sui dynasty) among the countries west of the T'sung ling mountains. Its capital is called Si-kien (Akhsiket ?), situated on tlie northern bank of the river Chen chv. There were six larger cities and about a hundred smaller places. One of the first was called Ko-sai (Kasan ?), After the ruler of Fa-han-na had acknowledged Chinese supremacy, this kingdom received in 744 the Chinese name Ning yiian. For further details see Hyacinth's " Nations of Central Asia," iii. 251, 202, 186. The Khanate of Khokand of our days, the history of which is very obscure, is said to have been founded in the middle of the seventeenth century by an Uzbeg prince, Shah Rokh, who established his residence at a place called Kukan, situated twenty versts west of the present city of Khokand, which was built by Shah Rokh's son. See Ritter's " Asien," v 772. The Khoakand in Ferghana of Ibn Haukal is evidently the same name (Abulfeda, 11. ii. 225). Sultan Baber (i. 52) speaks of a district Kukan in Ferghana. Since the year 1876 Kiiokand forms the Russian province of Ferghana,



54 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
MA-RH-I-NANG=UARGB.i}^A^.
This is doubtless the city of Marghinan mentioned by Ibn Haukal in the tenth century as a city of Ferghana (Abulfeda, II. ii. 215J. Sultan Baber, in his description of Ferghana (i. 5), states that Marghinan is famed for its pomegranates and other fruits. P. Nazaroff, a Kussian traveller to Khokand, 1813-14^ who was detained for three months in Marghilan, as he writes the name, gives a detailed description of the city (Klaproth's " Magaz. Asiat.," i. 53). On the Eussian maps the name is also written Marghilan, and on Chinese maps of the last century Ma-rh^
k'o-lang,
H£r-Z)./^iV^= KHODJEND.
There can be no doubt that by Hu-djan on the ancient map the city of Khodjend on the Syr daria is meant. As we have seen, Khodjend is mentioned by the Arab annalists among the cities of Ferghana taken in 712 by Kutaiba. See also Abulfeda, II. ii. 225, who terms the city Khodjanda. When the Mongol armies invaded "Western Asia ia 1220, the valiant Timur Melik defended Khodjend. Sultan Baber, i. 6, speaks of Khodjend as of a very ancient city, and praises its excellent fruits, especially pomegranates. Ye-ltl Cliu ts*ai, w^hen speaking of K^u-djan (see i. 19), also notices the fine pomegranates there. In the Ylian shi, chap, cli., biography of Sie-f a4a-hai, one of Chinghiz* generals, who was with the conqueror in Western Asia, the name Khodjend is rendered by HucHan. Philippe Nazaroff, sent in 181 3 by the Eussian Government on a mission to the khan of Khokand, was, it seems, the first European who saw Khodjend. In 1866 Khodjend was taken by the Eussians.



TASHKEND. 55
The river Syr daria, on the southern bank of which
Khodjend is situated — the Sihun of the Persian authors,
the laxartes of the ancients—is termed Ho-clian or Rule ien by Chinese mediaeval travellers (see Part I.). This appellation may be explained by the fact tliat the Arabs generally called the Sihun " nahar Khodjand," the river of K-hodjeud. See notes 189, 334,
CH'A-GH'I=QnkQ\l OR TASHKEND.
A place of this name is marked on the ancient map, north-west of the afore-mentioned cities of Feriiliana; and this position permits its identification with Cliach, which was, as is generally believed, the ancient name for the present Tashkend. Sultan Baber (i. 97), when speaking of Tashkend, states that in books this city is generally called Shash ; some authors also write Ghach. Shash was taken in 7 1 2 by Kutaiba (vide p. 46). It is mentioned by Ibn Haukal and other authors of the same period. Al Biruny, who wrote in the eleventh century, identiiies it with the " Stone Tower " of Ptolemy, the starting-point for the caravans proceeding to the country of the Seres (China). See Abulfeda, ccclxix. ; 11. ii. 221. In d'Ohsson's " Hist, des Mongols " the name of Shash or Chach does not appear. Tashkand is only once mentioned, iv. 557, s. a. 1306. It is marked also on d'Ohsson's map. In the days of Timur, Tashkend played an important role, and frequent mention is made of this place in the Mohammedan records of Timur's warlike doings. To the Chinese, Shash or Chach was well known during the T*ang period, in the seventh and eighth centuries, and they had frequent intercourse with it. In the T'ang
history this realm is termed Shi,^^* and also Che-chi or Che-che (Chach). It is said there that in the days of the
*^ Shiin Chinese means "stone." Task in the Turkish dialects has the same meaning. Thus Tashkend means "stone city."



56 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
Han it formed the northern boundary of the country Ta v:an, first reached by the Chinese general Chang K'ien in about 130 B.C. The residence is called Che-che. To the south-west the river Yao-s,ha, called also Chen-chu or Chi^
is noticed. Five hundred li to the south-west was Kang (Samarkand). To the north-east Shi bordered upon the dominions of the western T\t-kue (Turks). At Ta-lo-sz* (Talas; see note 585) the king of Shi kept a garrison
(here was the frontier). Slii was famed for its horses, &c. Per further particulars see Hyacinth's " Nations of Central
Asia/' iii. 243. The same kingdom was visited in the first half of the seventh century by Hiian ts*ang, who, according to his narrative, travelled from Talas westward and south-westward, and then arrived at Che-shi (Chach). The name Tashkend in Chinese works seems to occur as early as the Mongol period. In the Ylian shi, annals, s. a, 1309, mention is made of the taxes which had to be gathered from the cities of Sa-ma-rh-kan (Samarkand),
T'^a-la-sz (Taras), and Ta-shi-yilan^'^^ (Tashkend). In the Ming shi Tashkend is termed Ta-shi-gan (see Part IV.).
U- ri-LA -BH== OTRAR
The position of Otrar—this place is evidently meant

is erroneously marked on the ancient map in relation to Tashkend and Sairam. It seems that the name Otrar first occurs in the Mohammedan authors of the thirteenth century. Its ancient name, or perhaps the name of a city near the site of Otrar, was Farab, which is mentioned by the authors from the ninth to the twelfth century. Ibn Haukal states that it was situated on the river of Shash (Sihun). He speaks also of the river of Farab, which comes out from the Shash river (he means probably the Arys^ an affluent of

OTRAR. 57
the Syr daria). Compare Albufeda, ii. y8, II. ii. 220, who
writes Fai^ab or Otrar and its capital Kadar. The Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) mentions Otrar among the cities of Turkestan. The history of Otrar presents two remarkable events. Its capture by the Mongols in 12 19 was the commencement of the conquest of Western Asia ; and it was at Otrar that the great Timur died, i8th February 1405, just when he was about to move out on a great expedition against the emperor of China. Haithon, in his " Account of the Eastern Kingdoms," p. 128, calls Hotocar {Otrar) the greatest city of Turkestan. King Haithon, the traveller, writes the same name correctly Otrar.
Tlie name Ornas or Orpar, coupled in PI. Carpini's narrative with Barchin (see note 6/6), is perhaps intended for Otrar. Concerning the siege and capture of Otrar as recorded in the Chinese annals, see i. 285. The Yiian shi spells the name Wa-fo-lo-rh and O-ta-la. Ye-lil Ch^u tsai mentions O-ta-la north-west of Khodjend (see i. 20). We read in Pegolotti's *' Notices of the Land Route to Cathay," written in the first, half of the fourteenth century
(Yule's '* Cathay," 288) —his itinerary mentions first Gintarchan (Astrakhan), Sara (Sarai), and Saracanco (near
the river laik or Ural ^^^) —that the distance from the latter place to Organci (Urghendj), is estimated at twenty days' journey in camel- waggons, and from Organci to Oltrarre (Otrar) thirty-live to forty days. But the direct way from Saracanco to Oltrarre (passing probably north of lake Aral) is stated to take only fifty days. From Oltrarre to Armalec (Almalik) Pegolotti reckons forty-five days' journey with pack-asses. According to Lerch (" Archaeol. Journey in Turkestan")
®^ This is the Serachuk of Ibn Batutaiii. i. Jenkinson mentions Saraichik as a place existing in 1558. According to Lerch ("Khiva" 23) the ruins of this place can still be seen near Guriev, at the mouth of the UiuJ.

SA.^fA-RH-KAN=SAMAIiK^^^D.
Samarkand is one of the most ancient and celebrated cities of Asia. The fertile valley of the Zarafshan river, in which Samarkand was built, is mentioned under the name of Sogdo in the ancient traditions of Iran. The Zend Avesta names it among the places of abundance created by Ormuzd. From Sogdo the name Sogdiana of the Greek and Roman authors is derived. It is generally believed that the place Maracanda, visited by Alexander the Great (see Arrian's History) is identical with Samarkand. In Firdusi's Shahnameh the names of Sogd and Samarkand are frequently mentioned. Ibn Khurdadbili (ninth century), Istakhri, Ibn Haukal, all state that Samarkand is the capital of Sogd. Very little is known of the ancient history of Samarkand. Before the Arabs had conquered Transoxiana, these tracts, and also Sogdiana, belonged to the Turks. In the tenth century we find the Samanide dynasty was reigning over Transoxiana. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sogdiana was comprised in the dominions of the Ilek khans of Turkestan, who, after the Karakhitai had occupied Turkestan about 1 125, continued to rule over Transoxiana as vassals of the ghurkan. In 1 2 13, Osman, the last of these khans, was killed by Sultan Mahmud Khovarazm Shah, who then took possession of Transoxiana, and transferred his residence to Samarkand. He was there when Chinghiz' army entered Transoxiana. The city surrendered to the Mongols in 1220 and was destroyed, Samarkand, in the days of the Mongols, was repeatedly visited by Europeans and other Christians. There was a metropolitan See of the Nestorian Church and also a Latin missionary bishopric at Samarkand in the fourteenth century (Yule's "Cathay," ccxliv. 192). The Christian mission



SAMARKAND. 59
aries in the Middle Ages called it Semiscant. M. Polo, i. 191, devotes a chapter to the great city of Samarcan, but he did not see it. King Haithon, the traveller, terms it Semergent. The Chinese report respecting Samarkand as follows: There can be no doubt that Sogdiana was known to them as early as the second century B.C., since the famous Chinese general Chang K*ien had visited the countries of the Far West. From the vague accounts found in the histories of the Han, it is not easy to identify the ancient Chinese names applied to the countries of Western Asia. It seems, however, that the country K^arig-ku, first spoken of in tlie history of the Earlier Han, in the second century B.C., included Sogdiana ; for in the history of the Northern Wei (386-558) a country in the west called K^ang is mentioned, and it is stated there that the dynasty reigning in K'ang is a branch of the former dynasty in K'ang-kli of the Han period. In the history of the T*ang the kingdom of K^ang is again spoken of. It was also called Sa-mo-kien^ which name is evidently intended for Samarkand. In the seventh and eighth centuries the rulers of K*ang used to send embassies to the Chinese court. In the first half of the seventh century, the Buddhist monk Htian ts*ang visited Sa-mo-kien, and his itiiierary leaves no doubt that by this name Samarkand is to be understood. We find Samarkand again mentioned in the Chinese annals in the first half of the twelfth century. Ye-lli Ta-shi, the founder of the Karakhitai dynasty, advanced as far as Samarkand, and even beyond it. In the Chinese narrative of his expedition this name is rendered by Siinsz-kan (see i. 215). The same name was also in use in the East during the Mongol period. Chinese mediaeval travellers to the West in the thirteenth century term
Samarkand Siln-sz'-kan and also Sie-mi-sz'-kan. The latter name is evidently intended for Semiscant, a mediaeval name for Samarkand (see note 195). Ch'ang ch*un states
that the same city was also called Ho chvng fit (the city between the rivers), which is a literal translation of the



6o CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
Arabic " Belli nahareiu " (see note 221). An interesting explanation is given by Ye-lii Cli*u ts\ai of the name Sun-sz-lcan (or rather Sic-mi-sz -kan). He states that Western people say that the meaning of this name is *' fat ; " and as the land there is very fertile, the city received this name. Indeed, semiz in Turkish means " fat
"
(see note 29).^27 In the annals of the Yiian shi, where Chinghiz' expedition to the west is recorded,, both the above-mentioned Chinese names for Samarkand occur. Ibidem, 5. a. 1 309, the same city is called Sa-ma-rh-kan, as on our . ancient map. I may, finally, mention an interesting ancient Chinese document referring to Samarkand, and translated by Archimandrite Palladius in the "Chinese Recorder," vi. 108. An ancient monument in CJiin kiang fu, commemorative of Ma Sie-li-ki-sz\ a Christian and a native of Samarkand mentions Sie-mi-sz -hien as a country where the religion of the Ye-li-Uo-weii (Christians) dominates ; and speaks of a miraculous temple there, one pillar of which was in a hanging position, &c. This statement has special interest, for M. Polo, ii. 162, speaks of the Baron Mar Sarghis, a Nestorian Christian, who was governor of Chinghianftc. Polo also records (i. 191) the miracle in the Christian church of Samarcan, where one of the columns was without support.
NA-I£EI-SHA-BU='!<^AK'EISREB (KARSHI).
By this name, placed on our ancient map south-west of Samarkand and south-east of Bokhara, only Nakhsheb or Karslii on modern maps can be meant, a city belonging to the dominions of the khan of Bukhara. It seems that Nakhsheb is spoken of in the history of the Wei dynasty (386-558). At least the name Na-she-ho,
827 Al Biruny ( + 103S) states that SamezJccnd is the Turkish name for Samarkand, and that it means "sun-city." See Sprenger's "Post- and Reiserouten des Orientes," 21.



BOKHARA. 6i
mentioned there under the article K'aiig (Samarkand) as that of a small realm subject to K*ang, has a strong resemblance to Nakhsheb. The same name appears also in the Tang history. Nakhsheb is an ancient city. This name appears in the Shahnameh. It is stated there that in the reign of the Sassanian king N^ushirvan (531-579) the khan of China invaded Transoxiana and defeated the khan of the Heitaleh near Nakhsheb. Ibn Haukal states (Abulfeda, IL ii. 219) that Nakhshab is situated in a plain at a distance of two days' journey from the mountains of Kasli (in the east). A desert extends between Nakhshab and the Djihun (Oxus). Nakhsheb is more than once mentioned in d'Ohsson's " History of the Mongols " (Rashid-eddin and others). When the Mongols first appeared in Transoxiana, Mohammed Khovarezm Shah left Samarkand and fled by way of Nakhsheb. After the capture of Samarkand, Chinghiz encamped the whole summer of 1220 between that city and Nakhsheb. The present name of the place, Karshi, dates from the beginning of the fourteenth century. We read in the Zafernam'^h, i. 14: "The name of Karshi was given to the city because of the palace, in Mongol Karshi, built by Kepek, khan of Turkestan (+1321), 2 J leagues from Nakhsheb. Timur built a citadel there."
^C7-Hf7^4-Z.l = BOKHARA.
All Mohammedan authors agree iu stating that Bokhara is one of the most ancient cities in the world. It is often mentioned in the early history of Persia. In the political changes which have successively taken place in Transoxiana, Bokhara has generally shared a common fate with Samarkand. Thus it was conquered by the Arabs in the beginning of the eighth century. In the tenth century it was the residence of the Samanide dynasty. In the beginning of the eleventh century Bokhara was seized



62 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
by the Ilek khan of Turkestan. When Chinghiz khan arrived, Bokhara belonged to Khovarezm Shah. This place surrendered to the Mongols in 1220. The Chinese annals apparently first mention Bokhara by its very name in the seventh century. In the T*ang history, after the article ou K'^ang (Samarkand), nine smaller kingdoms are mentioned, which in former times had been dependent on Samarkand. One of them, the ruler of which in 627 sent an embassy to the Chinese court, is called An there, and also Bu-huo or Bu-ho. This kingdom of Bu-ho is stated to be bounded to the west by the river JVu-hu.^^^ The same kingdom, Bic-ho, was visited about 630 by Hiian ts*ang. He states that it is broad from east to west and narrow from north to south. In
'* The river Wu-hu is evidently the Oxus or Bjihun, the Amu daria of our days. It is again mentioned in the T'ang shu, in the articles Tu-huolo (Tokharestan) and Ho-li-si-mi (Khorazm). See farther on. Hiian ts'ang writes the name of the river which flows through Khovarezm and Tokharestan Fo-tsu. Both Chinese names may be intended for Wakhsh, which is still the name of one of the principal affluents of the Oxus. Colonel Yule is of opinion ("Cathay," ccxxxiv.) that also the classical name Oxus is derived from Wakhsh. The latter is an ancient name. Edrisi, wlio gives a detailed account of the Djihun and its affluents, states (i. 472) that the Walchsh-ab takes its rise in the country of the Turks, then arrives in the country of Wakhsh, &c. The Djihun is also called Amu or Amuyeh by the Mohammedan authors of the Middle Ages. Quatremfere (" Mongols," xix. 141) states that this latter name is derived from the city of Amol, called also Amuyeh, on the Djihun (not to be confounded with the city of Amol in Tabaristan, near the Caspian Sea). According to Abulfeda (ii. 78, II. ii. 177), the city of Amol, also Amu, Amuyeh, was situated one mile west of the Djihun, in the latitude of Bokhara. Amol is frequently mentioned by the Mohammedan historians and geographers. There was near this place a much
frequented passage over the Djihun. We learn from Biruny ( + 1038) that this passage was between Amol, near the left bank, and Fardber, which lay €ast of the Djihun. See Sprenger's '* Reiserouten der Araber," map i. On the great Russian map of Turkestan I find a place, Farab, on the road from Bokhara to Merv, at a distance of about eight versts from the right bank of the Amu daria, opposite Chardjui, which lies eight versts west of the river. There can be no doubt that Chardjui represents ancient Ami)l. We have seen that the Chinese travellers to the west in the Mongol period call the Oxus A-mu or An-hu.



DA RA N—KA TH—TERMED. 63
point of climate and products it is like Sa-mo-kien (Samarkand). These statements agree with Bokhara. The capture of Bokhara by Chinghiz is recorded in the Yuan shi, where the name is written I^u-hita, and also Mu'ha-rh (see i. 285). Ye-lii Ch*u ts*ai (see i. 22) says that P^u-hua is richer than Samarkand.
i)/-Z/..liV=DARAN (1).
Thus the name is written in the list of the Si pei ti
;
but on the ancient map it is spelt Di-an-li, and placed between Bokhara and Kath. Perhaps Daran is intended, according to Abulfeda, II. ii. 21 1, a city of Khovarezm on its southern border.
ii:6>-r/=KATH.
This name appears on the map south-east of the place where Khovarezm is marked. It seems Kath is meant, a city of Khovarezm. See Abulfeda, II. ii. 210. P. Lerch,
in his learned article "Kliiva" (1873), xvi. 21, states that in the days of Istakhri and Ibn Haukal (tenth century), Kath, then the capital of Khovarezm, was situated on the northern (right) bank of the Djihun. When Biruny wrote, in the first half of the eleventh century, the city had been transferred to the southern (left) bank, to the place where, according to the Russian maps, now the city of Kdt stands, about twenty-two English miles north of Khiva. But it is now about twelve miles west of the river, which, as Lerch proves, in the eleventh century passed by Kath. Kath is not mentioned by the Mohammedan authors translated by d'Ohsson. But in the accounts of Timur's war with Khovarezm, end of the fourteenth century, this name repeatedly appears.
TE-RH-MI^ TERMED.
On our ancient map T'e-rh-mi or Termed is placed north of Balkh. On Ptussian maps the ruins of Termez



64 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
(Termed) are marked on the northern bank of the Amu daria, about eleven English miles north-west of the mouth of the Surkh-ab river. With respect to Balkh, its position is nortli-east. Termed is a very ancient city. The name appears in the Shahnanieh. According to Istakhri, it lay on the way from Bokhara and Samarkand {via Irongate) to Balkh. Timur, end of the fourteenth century, when proceeding from Samarkand to Balkh, always crossed the river at Termez. Now-a-days the passage oVer the Amu daria ou the way from the Irongate to Balkh is more to the west. We read in Edrisi (see note 828) that the river Wakhshab (he applies this name not only to the affluent of the Amu daria of this name, but also to the upper part of the main river), after issuing from the mountain, runs along the frontier of the country of Balkh, and reaches Tarmedh, then flows on to Kilif (this place still exists), to Zam, to Amol, and finally discharges its waters into the lake of Khovarezm. According to the Mohammedan authors, Chinghiz took Termed by assault in the autumn of 1220 (d'Ohsson, i.
271). As to the Chinese authors who mention Termed, the earliest seems to be Hiian ts*ang in the seventh century. His country, Ta-mi, situated on the great river Fo-tsu (Oxus), and coupled with Tu-ho-lo (Tokharestan), is without doubt Termed. The Chinese annals Kang mu record the capture of Tie-li-mi (Termed) by Chinghiz (see i. note 679, and p. 292). In the Yiian shi, chap, cli., biography of Sie-t'a-lahai, where the same fact is related, the name is written
T'ie-li-Tna,
The compiler of the ancient map has committed a gross error with respect to the position of Tus, for the name of



BADAKHSHAN. 65
this city is evidently rendered by the Chinese characters
Tu-sz\—carrying it too far east—east of Balkh—and assigning it to the Middle Empire. As is well known, Tus in the Mongol period was the capital of Khorassan, a province of Persia. Tus is a very ancient and celebrated city. The foundation of it is attributed to Djamshid, a mythical king of Persia. The Calif Harun al Kashid died in Tus, a.d. 809. His tomb there was destroyed by the Mongols in 1221. Tus is the native city of the celebrated Persian poet Firdusi (9401020) aod of the great astronomer Nasr-eddin (1201-74). This city had much to suffer from the Mongol invasion, being first sacked by Subutai in 1220, and destroyed the following year by Tului. It was restored, 1239, by Kuerguez, who had been appointed Mongol governor of Khorassan, and who established his residence there (d'Ohsson,.
iii. 116, 117). In 1256, Hulagu, on his expedition to Persia, spent several days in Tus and its neighbourhood (d'Ohsson, iii. 190). King Haithon, on his way back from Mongolia, passed through Tus, All the Mohammedan geographers speak of Tus. Tus at an early day was an -episcopal See of the Nestorian Church. Yule, "Cathay," xc, states that the existence of an episcopal see at Merv and Tus in 334, raised to metropolitan dignity in 420, is ascertained. In the Yiian shi, annals, s. a. 1222, the capture of the city of T'U'Sz' by T'o-lei is mentioned. B. Fraser was the first European in modern times (1823) who visited the ruins of ancient Tus, seventeen English miles north-west of Meshhed.
BA-DA-HA-8HANG=BADAKE.SB.A}^.
Badakhshan, the mountainous region, including the upper part of the valley of the Oxus, is spoken of by most of the ancient Persian and Arabic geographers. From early times an important trade route passed by Badakhshan, crossing the high transverse mountain chain



66 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
which connects the T'ien shan with the Karakorum ranfo^e and the high table-land of Pamir. This is the direct route from the Tarim basin (Kashgar) to Tokharestan. This transverse chain, which we are accustomed to call Bolor taghy although the name seems to be unknown to the natives of those regions, was crossed by Chinese pilgrims of the early centuries. Since the second century B.C., the Chinese, geographers designate it by the name of Tiung ling (Onion mountains). The route over the Pamir and by Badakhshan in the Middle Ages seems to have been of much greater importance than it is now. It was followed by M. Polo, who notices (i. 165,. i8i) the province of Badashan and the plain of Pamier. The name of Badakhshan is met in the early history of Persia (Shahnameh). Ibn Haukal, Edrisi, Abulfeda, all speak with more or less detail of the province of Badakhshan, situated beyond Tokharestan. The Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period mention Badakhshan several times in connection with the political and military events of that period. Guchluk, the ffurkhan of Karakhitai, was slain in Badakhshan in 12 18 (d'Ohsson, i. 172). In 1221 the Mongols invaded this country {/. c. i. 272). On the same page d'Ohsson translates a short account of Badakhshan by Yakut (-4-1229), stating that this mountainous country is famed for its precious stones, and especially rubies, called halakhsh. The merchants proceeding from Persia to Tibet have to pass through Badakhshan. Badakhshan was known to the Chinese at an early date
;
for in the fifth or sixth century they had intercourse with T*U'ho-lo (Tokharestan), and knew the route over the Ts*ung ling mountains. The name Badakhshan occurs first in Huan ts*ang's narrative, about 630; for the kingdom of Fo-tO'Chang-na, w^hich he notices in the regions of the Upper Oxus, is evidently Badakhshan. In the Yuan shi the name of Ba-da-ha-shang appears only in the list of the Si pei ti.



KABUL, 67
K'0-BU-LI=KAB\JL.
This name is marked 011 the ancient map south-west of Badakhshan. Evidently Kabul, in our days tlie capital of Afghanistan, is meant. According to Ritter ("Asien," v. 237) this is the Ka^ovpa of Ptolemy. Ritter traces the name of Zahulistan of the ancient Persian and Arabic historians (see Ghazna) also to Kabul. Indeed, Albufeda, II. ii. 204, mentions Kabul among the cities of Zabulistan ; but in the ancient historical records of the Persians (Shahnameh) Kabul and Zabulistan are considered as two dis
tinct countries. The Arabs never conquered these regions, it seems. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries Kabul belonged to the empire of the Ghaznian dynasty, and since 1182 to the Sultans of the Gaurian dynasty. When the Mongols appeared, in 12 19, in Western Asia, Ghazna and Kabul had been conquered some years earlier by Mohammed Khorazm Shah. Chinghiz' armies probably entered Kabul, although the Mohammedan historians of that period do not expressly state it ; but they mention Beruan, which is not far from Kabul, in connection with the Mongol military doings in these regions. The Chinese knew probably Kabul from early days. Remusat (" Extension de I'Empire Chinois ") identifies a country, Kao-fu, noticed in the T 'ang history, with Kabul. Ritter {I. c. 682) ventures to trace the Chinese name Kipin, which appears in the same T *ang shu (this western kingdom the Chinese knew already in the fifth century) to Kabul or Kophene ; whilst Remusat is of opinion that Ki-pin is Kandahar. But the accounts of these countries as given in the Chinese annals are too vague to allow us to ascertain their position. We can only understand that they lay beyond the Tsung ling mountains (Bolor).



68 CHINESE MEDIMVAL MAP.
K'0-DSI-N1NG = GY{IZ^\^ OR GHAZNA.
Gliazna or Ghiznin, as the authors translated by d'Ohsson write the name, is also an ancient city mentioned in the early history of Persia (Shahnameh). It was the capital of the country Zahulistan, situated south-west of Kabul. The residence of the Sultans of the Ghaznian dynasty, 976-1184, which ruled over these regions and a great part of India, was at Gh^zna. This dynasty was superseded by the Gaurian dynasty.. In i'2i6 Mohammed Khovarezm Shah took possession of Ghazna and Kabul. Ghazna played an important rdle during the Mongol invasion of Persia. Djelal-eddin of Khovarezm rallied his forces at Ghazna after he had been forced to abandon Persia. The city was destroyed by the Mongols in 1222, but was subsequently rebuilt. Hlian ts'ang, the Chinese pilgrim in the seventh century, notices a city Ho-si-na as the capital of the kingdom of Tsao-ku-cha. Both names appear also in the T*ang liistory. Vivien de St. Martin identifies Ho-si-na with Ghazna. As is known, Ghazna still exists as a town belonging to Afghanistan.

KIN-GHA = KIPCHAK.
The name Kin-cKa has been applied by Chinese mediaeval authors since the year 1223 to the countr}^ of the Kip^ chaks or Desht Kipchak, as the Mohammedan authors termed the tract of land situated north of the Black Sea, the Caucasus mountains, and the Caspian Sea, and covered by vast steppes. D'Herbelot in the '* Bibl. Or." translates the Persian word Desht by " campagne deserte ou il n'y a ni villes ni villages." Charmoy (" Exped. de Timour," Mem. Acad.
St. Petersb., 1836, p. 125) states that Kipchak in the Djagatai-Persian dialect bas the same meaning, i.e., " desert."



KIPCHAK. 69
The Kipchaks, according to Rashid, were one of the five sections into wliich the Turkish nation subject to Oghuz Khan was divided. The Persian historian relates the following legend of the origin of the Kipchaks (Berezin,
i. 18): Oghuz Khan, having been defeated by the tribe of Itharak, was forced to retire to an island between two rivers. At that time it happened that a woman whose husband had been killed in the battle, being suddenly taken ill, was compelled to take refuge in a hole in a tree, where she give birth to a son. When Oghuz heard of this he said : " As this woman has no husband, I shall adopt her son." The boy received the name Kipchak, which is derived from the Turkish word " kubuk," meaning a tree worn hollow by decay. All the people of Kipchak are descended from this adopted son of Oghuz. After seventeen years had elapsed, Oghuz succeeded in gaining the superiority over the Itbarak. He conquered Iran, and returned to his native country. Subsequently, when the Itbarak revolted, Oghuz settled the Kipchak between their country and the river laik (Ural). Since that time the Kipchak nomadise both in summer and winter in those regions. The first Mohammedan author who notices the Kipchaks seems to be Edrisi (middle of the twelfth century),
who, in enumerating (i. 498) the various Turkish tribes, calls one of them Kifchak. The Mohammedan geographers and historians of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries all speak with less or more detail of the Kipchaks (Abulfeda, Ibn Batuta, the Mesalek alabsar, &c.). The eastern neighbours of the Kipchaks were the Kankly {v. supra). The Kipchaks in the Middle Aiies were known to their northern and western neighbours by quite different names. In the Russian annals they are always termed Polovtsy, and mentioned for the first time in the middle of the eleventh century as a people inhabiting the steppes north



70 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
of the Black Sea, the Caucasus, &c. (Karanizin, ii. 6y). Before that time these tracts liad been occupied by the Pecheiugs. The Polovtsy are described as an audacious nomadic people and skilful horsemen. The Russians were frequently at war with them, and it was only when the Polovtsy had been defeated by the Mongols that they made a league with the Russians against the latter (l. c,
iii. 228). The Russian historians generally agree that the name Polovtsy is to be derived from polevoi, which is the adjective of polye, " field." Thus the above name would mean " inhabitants of the field " (plain). In the Hungarian and Byzantine annals the same people bear the name of Kumans.^^^ By this name they were known also to our western mediaeval travellers. PI. Carpini states (742,743): "Ivimus autem per totam terram Comanorum, quae tota est plana, et habet quatuor flumina magna : primum iVepe?' (Dnepr) appellatur, juxta quod, ex parte Rusciae, ambulabat Corenza (a Mongol general), et ex parte altera, per ilia campestria, Mauci, qui major est quam Corenza ; secundum Don, super quod ambulat quidam princeps qui habet sororem Bati in uxorem, qui Cartan appellatur; tercium Volga, istud flumen est Yalde magnum, super quod vadit Bati ; quartum Jaec appellatur (laik, Ural), super quod millenarii duo, unus ex una parte fluminis et alter ex altera parte, vadunt." Ibid, (p. 747) : " Comania vero habet ab aquilone, immediate post Rusciam, Morduinos,^^ Bileros id est Magnam Bulgarian!, Bascartos id est Magnam Hungariam (Bashkirs)." Rubruck (246) describes his journey through the steppes of the Comans in the following terms : " Et tendebamus recte in orientem ex quo exivimus predictam provinciam Gasarie, habentes mare ad meridiem et vastam solitudinem
8 ^ This name may be derived from the river Kuma, which empties itself into the Caspian Sea. *^^ The Mordvins, a people belonging to the Finnish race, still live scattered in the Russian provinces virest of the Middle Volga. See note 748.

ad aquilonem, que durat per xxx. dietas alicubi in latitudine, in qua nulla silva, nullus mons, nuUus lapis, herba est optima. In liac solebant pascere Commani qui dicuntur Cafpchatr M. Polo (i. 52) notices the people called Comaniaiis, and (ii. 491) speaks of the country of Coraania. Haiihon, in his "Account of Asiatic Kingdoms "(129), has also a chapter on the kingdom of Comania. 1 may finally mention that the well-known German traveller, J. Schildberger (beginning of the fifteenth century), mentions the country of Dlstihifshah. Probably he heard of it at the court of Timur. The Mongols came first in contact with the Kipchaks in 1223, when Subutai with his army crossed the Caucasus; but it was only about twelve years later that their country was subdued, when Batu undertook his famous expedition against the nations north of the Caspian and Black Seas. After Batu returned from Hungary in 1242, he establislied his residence in Desht Kipchak, near the Lower Volga. ^^
831 This capital of the Golden Horde was known in the Middle Ages under the name of Sarai, and is mentioned in the Russian annals as well as by western inediseval travellers and Mohammedan geographers (Abulfeda, Ibn Batuta, the Mesalek alabsar, Arab Shah, &c.). Carpini, who visited the court of Batu near the Volga in 1246, does not mention Sarai. Rubruck, who saw Batu in the same region eight years later, is the first author who notices Sarai (380). Sara was known to M. Polo (i. 4) as one of the residences of Barca Kaan, who was the brother and successor of Batu, and ruled over the Kipchak Empire, 1257-65. The late Professor Grigorieff, who many years ago explored the ruins of ancient cities on the Middle and Lower Volga, and published several interesting articles on the subject (" Russia and Asia," 1 876, in Russian), proves that Sarai was most probably founded in 1253. He identifies the ruins situated near th* modern city of Tsarcv, on the left bank of the Akhtuba, a branch of the Volga, with ancient Sarai. There was also a place called New Sarai, but this name is only known from ancient coins struck since the year 1 310. Grigorieff thinks that New Sarai was only a new quarter of the old city. But Colonel Yule, in his learned note on the subject (" M. Polo," i. 5), concludes that there were two cities of Sarai, Old Sarai, near Selitrennoi Gorodok, not very far off from Astrakhan, and the new city, near Tsarev. In 1395 Sarai was set on fire by order of Timur. The city was subsequently rebuilt, but at length definitively destroyed by the Russians in 1480.



72 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
Ye-lli Ch'u ts*ai, who accompanied Chinghiz to Western Asia, is the first Chinese author to mention Kipchak, terming it K^o-fu-cJia.^^^ He describes the country as vast plains without cities, where many horses and much cattle are bred. The Yuan ch*ao pi shi calls the Kipchaks Kihcha ; the Yiian shi always spells the name^m cKa, as it is rendered on our map. Compare i. 310-312, for accounts given in these works regarding the conquest of this country by the Mongols. The Chinese annals Kang mu, s. a. 1237, state concerning Kin-cKa that this country is distant thirty thousand li from China. In summer the nights there are extremely .short; soon after the sun has set it rises again. There are fine horses, and wealthy people breed a large number of them. The people are skilful in working leather and metal. They have blue eyes and red hair. In the biography of T^o-t'^u-ha (Yiian shi, chap, cxxviii.), who was a Kipchak prince and general in Kubilai khan's army, the following somewhat obscure account is given of Kin-ch*a :

The ancestors of the people of Kin-ch*a originally dwelt north of Wu ping, on the river i)/e-/ie?i, near the mountain An-da-han. (All these names are unknown to me.) K'^ilcKu emigrated to the north-west, to the mountain called Yii-li-ho-li, and this name was then adopted for the reigning family. K*u-ch*u had a son So-mo-na, who also had a son I-no-sz\ They were all hereditary princes of Kin-ch*a. "When Chinghiz was at war with the Mie-li-ki (Merkits), their prince, Huo-du, fled to Kin-ch*a.^^^ Chinghiz
®- As we have seen, Edrisi writes Kifchak. ^3 Rashid records (Berezin, i. Ji) that Khudu, a Merkit prince, attempted to flee to Kipchak, but was slaiu by the Mongols. In the biography of Subutai (see note 689) also it is stated that Huo-du, chief of the Merkits, fled to Kin-cKa. He was pursued by Subutai, who vanquished the Kin-ch'a army at Yil-yii. The Mohammedan authors record (d'Ohsson, i. 108) the appearance of the Merkits, conducted by their chief Tuk Togan, north of the Aral lake, and their pursuit by the Mongols.

demanded his delivery, which was refused, wlieii the emperor gave orders to attack Kin-ch*a, When I-no-sz' became old, his realm was troubled by insurrections, and his son Hu-lU'SU-man then determined to send envoys to Chinghiz and offered his submission. Meng-lco (Man<,ni, subsequently Great Khan) received orders to occupy Kin-ch*a. Hu-lu-su-man's son Ban-du-cHa surrendered with his people. Black mare's milk,^^ which was very pleasant to the taste, used to be sent from Kin-ch'a to tlie court of the Great Khan in China; whence the Kinch'a were also called Ha-la-cKi.^^ T^u-t'u~ha, in whose biography the above details are recorded, was a son of Ban-du-ch*a. He died in 1279. His son Chuang-vnc-rh, wlio died in 132J, was also a renowned general, and his sou Yen-tic-mu-rh(see his special biograpliy, chap.cxxxviii.) was from 1328-33 minister of the Great Khan Tob temur in China. Yen-t*ie-mu-rh's brother San-tun was also minister, as was San-tun's son likewise. The name Kin-ch*a appears also in the biographies of the following distinguished persons w^ho belonged to that nation :

Slaves in 862. The origin of the name, which is not quite clear, has been the subject of many controversies. We find it first in the Byzantine annals under the year 865. Dorn, in his "Caspia" (37j, proves that previous to Eurik no mention is made of tlie Eussians, either in the Byzantine annals or by Mohanimedan and other Oriental writers, although the Slaves of Eastern Europe were well-known to the Arabic and Christian authors in a much earlier period. We find no elucidation on the subject in the Eussian annals, for we know the early history of Eussia only from Nestor, the first Eussian chronicler, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century. He calls his native country Bits. The Byzantine annals record that, A.D. 865, under the reign of the Emperor Michael III., a heathen people, previously unknown, arrived from Scythia at the Bosphorus in two hundred ships and besieged Constantinople. The name of this people was Bos. The emperor, who at that time was at war with the Arabs in Asia, made haste to return to deliver his capital, and the fleet of the Eos sailed away. Subsequently the Patriarch Photius(8i5891) sent missionaries among the Eos, many of whom were converted, and a Bishop was appointed at Kiev. According to the Eussian annals, this expedition to Constantinople was undertaken by Askold and Dir, the companions of Eurik, who departed with their fleet from Kiev. See Dorn, I. c. 30; Sophocles' Greek Lexicon of the Eoman and Byzantine periods ; Photii Epistolae. According to Dorn, the earliest Mohammedan author who mentions the name Eus is the geographer Yakuhi^ who wrote about 890. In 921 the Calif Muktedir despatched Ihn Fozlan to the Bulgars on the river Ttil, in order to convert them to Islam. This traveller, who had many opportunities of meeting Eussians, has left a very curious account of this
people, which was translated into German by Fraehn in 1823. See also Yule's " M. Polo," ii. 488.



RUSSIA. 75
The Russians (Bus) are spoken of by all the Arabic and Persian historians from the tenth to the fourteenth century, and of course also by Eashid and the other Mohammedan historiographers of the Mongol period. We have seen from the records of the Russian, Mohammedan, Chinese, and Mongol chronicles (see Part II.) that the Mongols first became acquainted witli the Russians in 1223, when Subutai invaded the countries north of the Caucasus. The Russians were then defeated, together with the Kipchaks or Polovtsy on the river Kalka. Fourteen years later Russia was again attacked by the Mongols. They appeared on the eastern frontier, ravaged Northern Russia in the winter of 1237-38, and in 1240 devastated the southern principalities, Chernigov, Kiev, &c. After returning from Hungary in 1242, Batu established his residence near the Lower Volga (see note 831). His dynasty is known to the Mohammedans as that of Desht Kipchak ; whilst tlie Russian annals call it Zolotaya orda (Golden Horde). Russia was for more than 250 years under its yoke. The Russian Grand- dukes and all lier other princes were forced to repair to the court of the Golden Horde to pay homage. Whoever attempted to disobey, or incurred the khan's displeasure, met with death at the hands of the Mongol executioner. Thus Michael of CheimigoVy who refused to bow before the Mongol idols, was executed in tlie ordo of Batu khan in 1246. The tragedy is reported with some detail in the Russian annals as well as by PI. Carpini (621), who speaks as an eye-witness. Another cruel execution of a Russian prince is recorded under the reign of Uzbeg khan. After the death of the Grand-duke Andrei of Vladimir, two Russian princes, Michael of Twer and Yury of Moscow, disputed the throne. Yury was defeated by Michael, and the wife of the former, being a sister of Uzbeg, was made prisoner and died soon after. Michael was then summoned to appear before the khan, who at that time was travelling towards Derbend. Michael obeyed and

was cruelly put to death in 13 19. His son Dmitry was executed in 1325. After Knssia was subdued by the Mongols, the Grandduke Yaroslav II. of Vladimir, 1238-46, appeared in person before Batu, wlio acknowledged his supremacy over the other Russian principalities. Yaroslav sent his son Constantine to Karakorum, to tlie Great Khan Ogotai. The prince returned in 1245, having been absent for two years. (Russian annals, Karamzin, iv. 31, 295.) In the next year Yaroslav was again summoned to repair with his family to Batu's ordo, and then forced to proceed to the court of the Great Klian, to exculpate himself on account of some denunciations brought against him by one of the Russian noblemen. After an audience with Kuyuk khan, Yaroslav was allowed to return. He died, however, on his way home, 30th September 1246. His body was carried to Vladimir (Russian annals). PI. Carpini, who spent more than three months (July to November 1246) at the court of Kuyuk near Karakorum, saw Yaroslav there. According to him, the Grandduke had been poisoned and died at the court during Carpini's stay there. He whites as follows (761, 762): *Eodem tempore mortuus fuit leroslaus, dux magnus in quadam parte Rusciae quae Susdal^^ nominatur. Hie modo fuit vocatus ad matrem Imperatoris, quse dedit ei manducare et bibere, quasi pro honore, de manu ipsius
;
et reversus est ad hospicium incontinenti, et infirmatus, et fuit mortuus post septem dies, et totum corpus ejus miro modo factum est glaUcum ; quare credebatur ab omnibus quod potionatus esset ibidem, ut suam terram libere et plenarie possiderent : et ad hoc est argumentum quod incontinenti, nescientibus hominibus suis qui erant ibi, misit nuncium festinanter in Rusciam ad Alexandrum ^^^ filiura
^^ Suzdal is still the name of a city north of Vladimir. It was in ancient times the capital of a considerable principality -of the same name, belonging originally to the house of Yaroslav, Grand-duke of Vladimir. *^^ Piano Carpini means the valiant Alexander Nershi, thus named on account of the victory he gained over the Swedes in 1240 on the Neva river. He was Prince of Novgorod.

ejus ut veniret ad ipsam, quia vellet ei terrain patris doiiare;
qui ire noluit, sed reiiiansit: et medio tempore dabat litteras ut ipse veniret ut terrani patris sui haberet. Credebatur tamen ab omnibus quod eum occideiet si veniret, vel etiam perpetuo captivaret." Yaroslav is again mentioned in Carpiiu's narrative, p. 771, iu the chapter de testibus qui in terra Tartarorum nos invenerunt : " In reversione in terrani Biserminorum (Mussuhnans) in civitate Lemfiiic (probably a clerical error for lanckint or Yanghikend, see note 6y6) invenimus Ugneum, qui de mandato uxoris leroslai et Bati ibat ad prsedictuni leroslaum, et Cocteleben et omnem societatem ejus. Isti omnes reversi sunt in terrain Susdalensium in Kuscia; a quibus poterit, si oportuerit, Veritas in venire. Apud Mauci^^^ invenerunt socios nostros qui remanserant dux leroslaus et societas ejus." On p. 749 he alludes to the journey of some Russians who went through the country of the Kankalis to join Yaroslav : " Post hoc terrain intravimus Cangitarum quae magnam habet in pluribus locis penuriam aquarum ; in qua etiam homines pauci morantur propter aquae defectum: unde homines leroslai ducis Euscise, qui in terram Tartarorum ibant ad ipsum, ' fuerunt, propter sitim, plures mortui in illo deserto." Alexander Nevshy (see note ^2)7)> Prince of Novgorod, the son of Yaroslav, was also forced to undertake the painful journey to the court of the Great Khan, in which he was accompanied by his younger brother, Andrei. They returned in 1249. Alexander was invested by the khan with the rule over Southern Russia (Kiev), and in 1252 he ascended the throne of Vladimir. The subjection of Russia to the khans of the Golden Horde referred chiefly to the tribute the Russians were obliged to pay. At first the khans farmed out the tribute due by the Russians to some Mohammedan merchants

(called Bussurman merchants in the Russian annals ; Karamzin, iv. 329}, and the tax-gatherers collected the dues Mith the greatest rigour and cruelty. They were assisted by Mongol officers, called basJcaks by the Russian chroniclers {I. c. iv. 97). Compare Pi. Carpini, 703 : " Baschatos sive praefectos suos ponunt in terra illorum quos redire permittunt." In the fourteenth century the Russian princes succeeded in obtaining permission to collect the taxes themselves/ and to carry the tribute directly to the khan. Besides the heavy taxes there was another duty imposed upon them by the Mongols. At the demand of the khan they liad to supply troops and fight against the enemies of the latter. We shall see farther on that in the time of Kubilai khan there was a division composed of Russian soldiers cantoned even in the vicinity of Pekin. As to the administration of Russia, however, and its political relations, the Mongols did not change the then existing state of things. The grand-dukes were allowed to rule their people as they liked, and the Christian religion was also respected. Karamzin gives (iv. 179) the translation of a yarligh, or written patent, granted in the beginning of the fourteenth century to the Russian clergy by Uzbeg khan. This patent exempted the clergy from taxation. After the death of Uzbeg (1312-42), the dynasty of the Golden Horde began to decline. The first attempt to profit by this debility of the Mongols was made by Dimitry, grand-duke of Moscow, who in 1380 (8th September) defeated the Khan Mamai with great slaughter. This memorable battle, known in Russian history as the battle of the "field of snipes*' (Kulikovoye polye), was fought at the place where the river Nepriadva discharges into the Don, Dimitry received on this account the surname Donskoi. This brilliant victory did not break down the Mongol power, however ; for a few years later Mamai's successor, Tokhtamysh, unexpectedly appeared at Moscow, and sacked and burnt the capital, when Dimitry again



RUSSIA. 79
became a vassal of the Mongols. At the end of the fourteenth century tlie Golden Horde experienced a serious shock by the invasion of the great Tiniur. The latter, in 1395, when pursuing Toktaniysh, advanced as far as Yelets, near the river Don, in the province of Orel, devastating the land adjacent to this river. After the conqueror left Eussia, the grand-duke Vassily I. (i 389-1425) refused to Tokhtamysh the payment of tribute. But he had underestimated the power of the khan, who in 1408 arrived with a great host and imposed a heavy fine on Moscow as indemnity. In the first half of the fifteenth century the Mongol empire of Kipchak was much weakened, owing to
the rise of two new khanates—those of Kazan and the Crimea, The subjection of Russia to the Golden Horde then became quite nominal, and the tribute paid to the khans consisted merely in presents sent from time to time by the grand-dukes, who were on good terms with the Horde of the Crimea. The Mongol dynasty of Kipchak, or the Golden Horde, was destroyed in 1502 by Mengli Girei, khan of the Crimean Horde. In Russian history this date marks the end of the period designated by the name of the Mongol yoke. It seems that Russia was unknown to the nations of Eastern Asia before the Mongol period. In the Mongol and Chinese annals the Russians are first mentioned after Subutai's invasion of Southern Russia in 1223. The Ytian chao pi shi terms Russia or the Russians OnLS, as they are called even now by the Mongols. The Chinese of the Mongol period write A-lo-sz\ sometimes also Wa-lo-sz or U-lu-sz\ All these names evidently render the Mongol appellation Orus.^^ In the Yuan shi Russia is frequently mentioned. Regarding the Mongol and Chinese records of the conquest of Russia, compare Part II. I may notice here some other instances where the Russians are spoken of in the Yiian shi.
** I may observe that in Mongol no word begins with the consonant n Thus the Mongols, in rendering the word Rus, prefix a vowel to the name.

We read in the annals, s. a. 1253, that the Emperor Meng-Uo (Mancru) ordered Bi-dje Bie-rh-Jco to be sent to
Wu-lo-sz' in order to take a census of the people.®**^ It is an interesting fact recorded in the Yilan shi that there was in the first half of the fourteenth century a settlement of Russians near Peking. In the annals, chap, xxxiv., s. a. 1330, it is stated that the Emperor Wen tsung (Tob timur, 1329-32, the great-grandson of Kubilai) formed a regiment composed of U-lo-sz' or Russians. This regiment being commanded by a wan hu (commander of ten thousand of the third degree), received the name " The Ever- faithful Russian Life-guard." It was placed under the direct control of the council of war. Farther on in the same chapter it is stated that 140 king of land, north of Ta iu (Peking) was bought from the peasants and allotted to these Russians, to establish a camp and to form a military colony. We read again in the same chapter that they were furnished with implements of agriculture, and were bound to present for the imperial table every kind of
game, fish, &c., found in the forests, rivers, and lakes of the country where their camp was situated. This Russian regiment is again mentioned in chap. xxxv.
^** This statement seems to be corroborated by the Bussian annals, in which it is reiated (but a few years later) that in 1257 Mongol officers arrived at Suzdal, Riazan, and Murom, to take a census of the people, and special officers were appointed to collect the taxes, when noue but the clergy were exempt. In 1259 two Mongol officers, Berkai and Kassackik, arrived with their families and many Mongols on the river Volkhov, in order to number the Russian people. This measure caused a revolt in Novgorod (Karamzin, iv. 71, 74). I am inclined to identify the Berkai of the Russian annals with the Bi-dje Bie-rh-Uo in the Yiian shi. Bi-dje or bi-dgecKi, as the word is also written in the Yiian shi, is a Mongol title which may be translated by "secretary." In modern Mongol a letter is bickik. In Rashid's " Hist, of the Mongols " we frequently meet with the term bitikchi. D'Ohsson (iv. 371, 380, 381, 410) translates it by "officiers du ddpartement des finances." According to the Yiian shi, chap, xxxv., there were in the hu pu, or Board of Revenue, seven bi-dje-ch'i. In chap, xcix., on the Emperor's body-guard, his secretaries are called bi-dje-cKi. Compare Odoric's report on the. Khan's court at Khanbalik (Yule's "Cathay," 132); '*And there be four scribes to take down all the words the king may utter."

In chap, xxxvi. it is recorded that in the year 1332 the prince Djang-ghi presented 170 Kussian prisoners and received a pecuniary reward.^^ On the same page we read that clothes and corn were bestowed on a thousand Russians. In the same year the prince Yen f^ie-mu-rh ^^ presented 1 5CX) Russian prisoners to the Chinese emperor, and another prince, A-rh-ghia-shi-H, presented thirty. Finally, in the biography of Bo-yen, chap, cxxxviii., he is stated to have been appointed in 1334 commander of the emperor s life-guard, composed of Mongols, Kipchaks, and Russians. Such is all I have been able to find in the Yiian history regarding the Russians. It seems that no one of the Russians in the service of the Mongol emperors in China has played a conspicuous part. At least among the biographies in the Yiian shi the Russians have no representatives, whilst many distinguished statesmen and captains of the Mongol-Chinese empire were from the Kipchaks, Kankalis, Alans, and other nations subdued by the Mongols.
B U-LI-A-RH= BULGAR.
On the ancient map this name is written Bu-s^-a-rh
;
but the second character is evidently misspelt, for the Si pei ti writes the name as above. There can be no doubtthat Bulgar, east of the Volga, is meant. The Mohammedan authors call it also Bular or Bolar (Abulfeda, ii. 324).^**
**^ This is probably Djinkshi of the Mohammedan authors, kbau of the Middle Empire between 1330 and 1333. See d'Ohsson, iv., geneal. tabl. The khans of the Middle Empire were often at war with the klaans of Kipchak, and thus it is not unlikely that Russian soldiers had been made prisoners by Djinkshi *^'' The genealogical table of the Mongol dynasty in the Yiian shi mentions a prince Yen-t'iemu-rh^ a descendant of Kubilai's brother Bo-cKo. It is, however, diflBcultto understand how he should have captured 1500 Russians. The Chinese annals speak probably of another prince of this name. *" Two distinct branches of the Bulgars are known in history. One of them dwelt fur ages on the river Volga. The Byzantine historian Nicephorus Gregoras supposes that they took their name from the river Boi/XTtt (Volga), on which they were settled. These Pulgars have long ago disappeared, and are known to us only from the accounts of contemporary G

Bulgar was the name of a rich country situated on the eastern bank of the Volga, and on the river Kama. The capital of it had the same name. It was a renowned emporium in the Middle Ages. The ruins of the ancient city of Bulgar still exist, and have been the subject of learned investigation by several Kussian scholars.^* These remains are found on the spot where now the village Uspenskoye, called nho .Bolgarskoye, stands, in the district of Spask, province of Kazan. This village is about four English miles distant from the Volga, east of it, and eighty-three miles from Kazan. The fullest ancient account of Bulgar we possess is that written by Ibn Fozlan in the beginning of the tenth century (above, 74), which has been translated from the Arabic by Fraehn. . Most of the Arabic and Persian geographers from the tenth to the fourteenth century speak of Bulgar. Bulgar is, of course, mentioned by the Russian chroniclers at an early date of Russian history, but not earlier than the tenth century. The Byzantine authors of that period knew also Bulgar on the Volga. According to the Mohammedan authors, the Mongols first invaded the country of Bulgar at the end of 1223 (Subutai's expedition), and in 1236, when a new Mongol
Arabic and Byzantine writers, and some ancient coins coined in the city of Bulgar. No written documents of the Volga Bulgars have come down to us. The other branch, known under the name of Bulgars of the Danube, still exists. Probably they belonged to the same stock as the Volga Bulgars. Early Byzantine writers mention them in the regions north of the Black Sea and the Caucasus. They increased in power after the destruction of the empire of the Huns (Attila). Towards the end of the fifth century these Bulgars are recorded to have crossed the Danube. They then settled in Moesia and Thrace, where they still live. The original Bulgars on the Volga, according to Fraehn, were a mixture of Fins, Slaves, and Turks. The Danubian Bulgars since their appearance in history are reckoned among the Slaves, speak a Slavonic idiom, and have been Christians from an early date. ^* Pallas, "Reisen," i.

expedition had been directed to the west, Subutai was again detached with a division to sack the city of Bulgar, whereupon the country submitted (d'Ohsson, i. 345, 11. iii.). Berezin notices a strange Arabic inscription very frequently met with, not only among the ruins of Bulgar, but also in some other places in the province of Kazan. This inscription means "adventus oppressionis." The anagram of the Arabic letters converted into numbers gives the year 623 of the Hegira, or a.d. 1226. It does not appear, however, from the Mohammedan records above quoted that the Bulgars had been troubled in that year. Berezin further states that all the ruins of Bulgar refer to the Mohammedan period, i.e., from the tenth century, when the Bulgars on the Volga embraced Islam, to the fifteenth century, and that the oldest inscriptions found there cannot be traced back earlier than the Mongol invasion. Since the occupation of the country by the Mongols the Bulgars as a nation disappeared fi om history
;
but the city of Bulgar, even during the Mongol period, preserved its importance as a place of trade and a centre of Mohammedan learning. It seems that previous to the foundation of Sarai (see note' 831) Bulgar was the resi
dence of the khans of the Golden Horde. We know coins struck at Bulgar in Batu's reign. PI. Carpini, in his narrative, mentions the Bulgars three times (6y2i 70S, 747), and always under the double name BUeri id est Magna Bulgaria, Rubruck (252) states: " Milia (Volga) est major fluvius quam unquam viderim, et venit ab aquilone, de Majori Bulgaria tendens at meridiem." ^^ M. Polo, i 45, states that Barca Kaan (see note 831) was accustomed to reside at Sara and Bolgara. The Catalan map applies the name Bulgaria to the country south of the Lower Danube, which even now beai*s the same name. Opposite Bulgaria, north of the

Danube, we read on the same map the name Burgaria, whilst the original country of the Bulgars, or rather the city east of the river Edil, is termed there Borgar, In the Ylian ch*ao pi shi the name of Bulgar is rendered by Bular (see i. 300, 305). The Yiian shi does not record the capture of Bulgar by the Mongols. The city of Bulgar seems to have perished early in the fifteenth century, after which Kazan practically took its place.
On the ancient map this name is placed west of Eussia. The only place the medigeval name of which has some resemblance to Sa-ghi-la is Solgat, which, according to Abulfeda (ii. 320), was the capital of the Crimea {Kirym), half a day*s journey from the sea. It is not to be confounded with the Soldaia of Eubruck (2 1 5) and M. Polo (i 2), in the Middle Ages an important seaport on the south-east coast of the Crimea, The Orientals call it generally Sudak, but Edrisi, ii. 394, terms this place Soldadia. Sudak was taken by the Mongols in 1223.
A-LAN ^-5Z= ALANS OE ASES.
This name on the map is intended for the Alans or Aas^ by which latter appellation they were generally known in. Asia in the Middle Ages. Tlie Alans were settled from early times on the northern skirts of the Caucasus, where they are mentioned by the Eoman and Greek authors since the beginning of our era,, as well as by the Byzantine writers and Arabic geographers in a later period. See Klaproth's " Asia Polyglotta," p. 85 seq.; Yule's " Cathay," 316. Mas'udi, ii. 42 seq., gives detailed accounts of the Alans. He terms their capital Maas^ and reports, among others, that there is between the kingdom of the Alans and the Caucasus a castle and a bridge spanning a large river. This castle is known by the name of the castle of



ALANS. 8$
the Alans. It was built in ancient times by a king of Persia, Isfendiar, son of Gushtasp, to prevent the invasion of Persia by the Alans.^^ Mas'udi states that the Alans were Christians, but subsequently embraced Islam. In the Russian annals the Alans are always termed Yasy.^^"' In A.D. 936 Swiatoslav is reported to have captured the city of Bielowej, on the Don, belonging to the Khazars, and to have waged war with the Yasy and the Kasogi. The same Yasi are also spoken of by the Russian chroniclers of the thirteenth century as a people living near the Caucasus beyond the river Terek (Karamzin, iv.
119, 355). The Mongols, when they had passed the Caucasus in 1223, found the Alans living on the northern skirts of the Caucasus. Fifteen years later the Alans became subject to Batu khan, after they had made a stout resistance to the Mongols. The Mohammedan historians who record the expeditions against the Alans call them indiscriminately Alans or Asi (d'Ohsson, ii. 619, 620). Piano Carpini and Rubruck also identify the Alans and the Asi. The former (709) calls them Alani sive Asi, and mentions (748) their abodes south of Comania, Rubruck says (246) :*'... Commani qui dicuntur Capchat; a Teuton icis vero dicuntur Valani, et provincia Valania. Ab Ysidoro vero dicitur, a flumine Tanay (Don) usque paludes Meotidis et Danubium, Alania." On p. 252 we read : " Habebamus auteni ad meridiem montes maximos,
8^ Klaproth is of opinion that this Alan castle is the same as the Pm'ta caurasica of the ancients, known also in later times under the name of Porta cuniana. He places it in the defile of Dariel, valley of the Upper Terek, not far from Mount Kazbek, where the great road from Tiflis to Russia now passes. Klaproth translates also a passage from a Persian history of Derbend, stating that the Persian king Kobad (491-531), in order to protect his empire against the invasions of the Khazars, ordered awall to be erected which from Derbend stretched westward to the 5a6{-^Zan or Alan gate. Mas'udi attributes the construction of this wall to Nushirvan (see farther on sub Derbend). ^"^ De Guignes, iv. 344, erroneously identifies the Yasy of the Russian annals (misunderstood by him) with the Yazygs in Hungary.

in quibus habitant, in lateribus versus solitudinem illam, Cherkis et Alani sive Aas, qui sunt Christiani et adhuc (1254) pugnant contra Tartaros." On p. 243 Eubruck says: "In vigilia Pentecostes (1253; he was then somewhere near the Don river) venerunt ad nos quidam Alani, qui ibi dicuntur Aas, Christiani secundum ritum Graecorum, et habentes litteras grecas et sacerdotes grecos, &c." M. Polo (ii. 491) mentions Alania among the countries conquered by the Mongols, and (li. 162) devotes a whole chapter to an account of the slaughter of certain Alans who were Christians and formed a corps in Kubilai's army. This slaughter took place in the city of Chinginchu (Chang chou fu, in Kiang su). Marignolli, in the middle of the fourteenth century, writes regarding the Alans (Yule's "Cathay," 373) : "They form at this day the greatest and noblest nation in the world, the fairest and bravest of men. It is by their aid that the Tartars have won the empire of the east, and without them they have never gained a single important victory. For Chinguis Caan, the first king of the Tartars, had seventy-two of their princes serving under him when he went forth under God's providence to scourge the world." 8« Ibn Said (thirteenth century), quoted in Abulfeda (ii. 287), distinguishes between Alans and Asses; but he admits that the latter live in the vicinity of the Alans, belong to the same race, and have the same religion as the Alans, who are Turks who have embraced the Christian
faith. But Josafo Barbaro (1436), in his narrative of travels, says : " L'Alania e derivata da' populi detti Alani, li quail nella lor lingua si chiamano As'^ Klaproth identifies the Alans and the As with the
8*8 As will be shown farther on, Marignolli's statement about the prominent position the AJans occupied in the Mongol -Chinese empire is fully corroborated by the Yiian shi. But he is mistaken as to the Alans in Chinghiz khan's service. As we have seen, the country of the Alnn<» was only conquered in the reign of Ogotai.



ALANS. 87
OssetJii, still existing in the Caucasus. Vivien de St. Martin has adduced reasons against this identification, though he considers both tribes to have been originally members of one great stock of Asi, who, by different routes and at times widely separated, severally found their way from Central Asia to the region of the Caucasus. De Guignes (ii. 279), and after him Klaproth (" Tabl. Hist. As.," 174), have endeavoured to prove that the Alans were known to the Chinese since the second century before our era. I may be allowed to show on what facts their supposition is based. In the history of the Anterior Han (chap, xcvi.) a realm Yen-tsai is spoken of 2aX) li nortli^west of K'ang-ku (Samarkand). The people of this country are stated to be nomads and to resemble the people of K*ang-ku. It is further stated that Yents'ai is situated on a great lake (properly a marsh) with
flat shores, which is called the Northern Sea. In the history of the Posterior Han (chap, cxviii.) Yen-t3*ai is again mentioned, and it is observed there that the name of the country had been changed to A-lan-ya, In the history of the Wei (386-558) mention is made of a kingdom Su-t^e north-west of K*ang-kli, situated on a great lake, and anciently called Yen-tsai and Wen-na-sha. I am unable to decide whether these vague accounts of Yen-ts*ai and the resemblance of the name A-lan-ya to Alania are sufficient to establish the identity of these names. We learn from the Yuan shi that in the Mongol period the Alans were not only well known in China, but their nation furnished many able officers to the Mongol-Chinese empire. Several of them held high offices or distinguished themselves as valiant captains. Among the biographies in the Yuan shi, more than twenty meritorious Alans, some of them of royal blood, have been immortalised, and besides these the names of many others are
found there. The Alans are generally termed there A-su, sometimes

also A-sze. The name A-lan occurs there only once, viz., in the list of the Si pei ti, where it is coupled with A-rnc^ as on the map. As we liave seen, the Yiian shi mentions the A-sic first s.a. 1223. I now proceed to give a list of the Alans whose names appear in the biographies of the Yuan shi
Chap, cxxxii., ITaTtg-hiirsz* (the name is also written Ang-ho-sze). When the army of the Emperor Ogotai had reached the country of the A-su, the ruler of it, named Hang-hu-sz*, surrendered spontaneously ; whereupon the emperor granted him the title ha-du-rh (bahadur; see note 668), and a golden tablet of authority, confirming liim as ruler of his country. Order was given also to form a regiment of a thousand men of the A-su people (for the life-guard of the khan). Hang-hu-sz' had two son?, A-fa-cKi and An-fa-pu, the former of whom took service in the emperor's life-guard. Hang-hu-5z', after he had returned home, was slain in an insurrection, and his widow, Wai-ma-sz\ was then placed at the head of the government. She put on armour, quelled the riot, and then handed over the power to her son An-fa-pu, Hang-hu-sz' 's eldest son, A-Ca-cKi, whose biogiaphy is found in chap, cxxxv., was a valiant captain under Maiigu and Kubilai, and distinguished himself in the war against the Sung in China. He had a son named Bo-ta-rh, who was the father of 0-lo-sz\ who had two sons, Du-dan, and Fuding. All of them were officers in the Mongol army. In chap, cxxxii. is also the biography of Yil-wa-shi, another Alan, who distinguished himself as captain under the reign of Kubilai. He was sent against the revolted princes in the north-west (Kaidu, &c.), and carried the Mongol arm3 as far as the country I-hi-rh Si-hi-rh (v. supra). The father of Yu-wa-shi, by name Ye-lie ha-du-rli (Elias bahadur, also a prince, it seems), had surrendered at the same time as Hang-hu-sz*. Others of Yil-wa-shi's descendants are also mentioned.



A LA NS. 89
In chap, cxxiii. we have the biography of Nicgu-la {Nicholas), of the country of A-su, who is stated there to have surrendered at the same time as Ye-li-ya A-su (probably the afore-mentioned Elias is meant) and others, thirty-eight in all. Nie-gu-lu was with tlie emperor Mangu when he waged war with the Sung in China. His son A-t^a-ch^i distinguished himself at the siege of Siang yang fu and in the expedition against the revolted prince Noyen. In the reign of the emperor Jen tsung (13 12-21) A-t*a-ch*i was still active. His son Kiao-hua held a high
ofl&ce at court. In the same chapter we find also the biography of the A-su prince A-rh-sz-lan. It is stated there that his city was besieged by Mangu, when A-rh-sz'-lan together with his son A-san-djen repaired to the camp of that prince and offered his submission. The Mongol prince granted to A-rh-sz'-lan a patent to rule his people, but enrolled half of his troops in his own life-guard, whilst the other half was left to him to protect his dominions. A-san-djen remained with Mangu, but was subsequently killed when fighting against the revolted troops of She-rh-lco.^^ Mangu •ordered his body to be embalmed and sent back to his native country. When A-rh-sz'-lan had been informed of the death of his son, he said : *' My eldest son is cut off in early life, before he could be of service to the emperor. There is my second son, Nie-gu-Lai (Nicholas), whom I offer to your Majesty." Nie-gu-lai was a valiant warrior
;
he took part in Wu-liang-ho-dai's expedition to Ha-la-djang
{the Karadjang of Rashid,—Ytin nan). He left a son Hurh-du-da, who by order of the emperor Kubilai accompanied Bu-lo no-yen when he was despatched to the country of Ha-rh-ma-mou.^^^ Hu-rh-du-da had a son Ru-du t^iemu-rh. All these served in the emperor's life-guard.
*^ It is not clear whether this is the name of a naan or a country. ^^ The character mou in this name may be a misprint for a similarlylooking character, sz', and then the name Ha-rk-ma-sz' is perhaps intended ioT Hormuz.



90 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
In chap, cxxxii. we meet with the names of three A-su (Alans) who are stated to have surrendered when Mangu invaded their country, viz., Ba-du-rh and his brothers U-tsa-rh-hu-han and Ma-Va-rli-sha, The latter was in the avant-guard of the Mongols when the city of Mai-Jco-sz* was stormed (see Part 11. ). In chap, cxxxv. is the biography of K'ou-rh-ghi (George ?), a native of A-su, who in the reign of Kubilai served in the Mongol army. His father, Fu-de-lai-sz\ had been in the life-guard of the Emperor Mangu. K*ou-rhghi's son was called Di-mi-di-rh (Demetrius). In the same chapter are the biographies of two other Alans : Shi-la ba-du-rh and CHe-li, both in Kubilai's army. The father of the latter, Bie-ghi-ba, had accompanied the emperor Mangu in his expedition against the Sung. We may conclude from some of the names of these Alans mentioned in the Ylian history that they were Christians. This supposition is confirmed by the testimonies of Mas'udi, Abulfeda, Rubruck, and M. Polo. The Ylian cirao pi shi terms the Alans Asut (plural form of Asu). See i. 305.
SA-RH-KO-SZ' = CIRCASSIA.
There can be no doubt that this name, appearing on the ancient map south-east of A-lan A-sz\ is intended for the country of the Circassians, or CherJcess, as they are termed by Eashid-eddin (Berezin, i. 2). Abulfeda, ii. 2, writes the name DJerkes. In the ancient Russian annals the Cherkassy are repeatedly mentioned. According to Klaproth (" Asia Polyglotta ") the Cherkesses dwelt in ancient times in the western part of the Caucasus, and also in the Crimea. PL Carpini speaks repeatedly of a people Kerkis, but there is some confusion in his narrative as to the
application of this name. On pp. 6yZy 679, he seems to mean by Kerkis the Circassians; for in recording the



KHORAZM. 91
Mongol conquests in the west he states: "Chirpodan vero eodem tempore misit Occoday-can cum exercitu ad meridiem contra Kergis, quos in bello devicit. . . . Quibus devictis, ad meridiem ivit contra Armenos." But on p. 659, where the same name again appears, the Kirghizes seem to be meant : " Chingis can . . . ivit in expeditione contra Orientem per terram Kergis quos bello non vicit." On p. 708, wliere Carpini enumerates, in a certain geographical order, the nations subdued by the Mongols, he associates the Kergis with the Bascart (Bashkirs), Sarracens, &c., not with the Alani, Georgiani, and mentions the Circasi together with the BiUheni. Rubruck writes (252 ; the traveller was then somewhere between the Don and the Volga) : " Habebamus autem ad meridiem montes maximos (Caucasus), in quibus habitant, in lateribus versus solitudinem illam, Cherkis et Alani, sive Aas, &c."
HUA -LA - TSZ'-M U^ KHORAZM.
This name is marked on the ancient map north-west of Kath (see above), and is intended for Khorazm (or Khovarezm) ; it is a name of very ancient date and was applied to the country of the Lower Oxus, south and south-west of lake Khorazm or Aral. The present khanate of Khiva covers for the greater part ancient Khoiazm. The name appears already in the Zendavesta, the sacred writings of the Parsees, and in the cuneiform inscriptions on the ancient monuments of Persepolis. Lerch, in his learned article, " Historical and Geographical Account of Khiva," 1873, states that Kharizm in Old Persian means '*low land." Qarasmiah is mentioned by Herodotus in the
fifth century B.C. We possess detailed accounts of Khorazm by the Arab geographers Istakhri and Ibn Haukal, in the second half of the tenth century. The capital of the country then was Kathf on the northern bank of the Djihun (see above). This city is already mentioned in the Sliahnameh, iii. yy,



92 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
reign of Kai Khosru (Cyrus). After Kath the most important city of Khorazm was, accordiug to Ibn Haukal, Djordjanieh, which is the Arabic nurne for Urghendj (see note 2>6). Among the other cities enumerated there we find also Khiva, which is now-a-days the capital of the khanate of the same name. Wlien Chinghiz invaded Western Asia, the Sultan of Khorazm was a powerful sovereign, ruling also over Transoxiana and Iran. The capital of Khorazm then was Urghendj, which, according to d'Ohsson (i. 265), was the Mongol appellation of the city. Edrisi, who wrote in the first half of the twelfth century, already notices Djordjania (or Urgliendj) as the capital of Khorazm, and states (ii. 1 89) that it was situated on both banks of the Djihun, i.e., on the ancient channel of the Oxus; for in our days Kunia Urghendj or Ancient Urghendj is far west of the Oxus. The Mongols took Urghendj in 1221, and destroyed the city, but it must have recovered to some considerable extent in the next hundred years, according to the accounts given by Pegolotti and Ibn Batuta. Pegolotti in his itinerary (first half of the fourteenth century) calls it Organci (Yule's " Cathay," 294). A Franciscan missionary, in a letter dated Armalec, 1338, speaks of Urgayithy visited by liim, as of a city at the extremity of the empire of the Tartars and the Persians {I. c. 234). It is the Urghanj of Marignolli, who visited the place in 1339 (/.<?. 321). In 1388 Urghendj was destroyed by Timur, but was subsequently rebuilt (Zafernameh, iii. i). Haithon, in his account of Asiatic kingdoms in the thirteenth century (p. 128), states that the kingdom of Corasm stretches to the east ab6ut a hundred days' journey, and westward as far as the sea Chaspis. On the north it is bounded by the kingdom of Comania, and on the south it borders on Turkestan. The country has many cities. The capital is called Corasm. The Chinese knew Khorazm as early as the seventh



KHORAZM. 93
century. In the T*ang history, in the section treating of foreign countries, we find the following account of Ho-li
st-mi, called also Hiia-sin and Kzio-li:— This country is
situated on the river Wu-hu (Oxus ; see note 828). On the south-west it is bounded by Fo-sz (Persia); to the north-west it extends as far as the IC'o-sa,^^ who belon-^'
to the stock of the Tu-kue (Turks). In this country (of Khorazm), in the time of the Han dynasty, was the city of Ao-kien.^^ The ruler of the Ho-li-si-mi resides in Tsi-topei-che. Among the hit (people of Western Asia) this is the only country where carts drawn by oxen are found. The merchants travel in these carts to other countries. Several embassies proceeding in the eighth century from Ho-li-si-mi to the Chinese court are recorded. The Chinese Buddhist monk Hiian ts'ang, in his peregrinations from China to India in about 630, passed also through Khorazm. He writes the name Ho-li-si-mi-hia, and states that this kingdom is situated on both banks of the river Fo-tsu (Wakhsh or Oxus ; see note 828), extending from north to south 500, and from east to west 20 or 30 U.^^ In the Ylian shi the name, of Khorasm appears only in the list of the Si pei ti. The capture of Urghendj by the Mongols is mentioned in the annals, and the name is spelt there Yu-lung-ghie-cKi. The Yiian cliao pi shi writes it Urungechi.
Ye-lii ch*u-ts*ai states (see i. 22): "West of F'u-hua (Bokhara) there is a great river flowing westward, which enters a sea. West of this river is the city of U-li-gkien^
8'^ In the article Fo-lin (Byzantine empire), in the san-.e T'ang shu, it i» said that this kingdom is opposite the country of K'o-sa. It seems the Khazars are meant. ^^ In the history of the Anterior Han, art. K'ang-kii (Samarkand), Ao-kien is mentioned among the small kingdoms dependent on Samarkand, dstant about 1400 U from the latter place, *"*3 Evidently the Chinese author takes into consideration only the cultivated land in the valley of the Oxus. Even now the khanate of Khiva

SAI-LAN=^A.mAM,
Sairam^^ is still the name of a little town in Russian Turkestan, north-east of Tashkend, and about 6J English miles east of Chimkend. This place was formerly situated on the great highway leading from Almalik (Kuldja) to Samarkand. Now-a-days, the Russian post- road from Kuldja to Samarkand via Chimkend and Tashkend leaves Sairam to the east. Sairam is not mentioned by the early Arabic geographers. Lerch, in his " Archaeol. Journey to Turkestan," considers it as ascertained that the place Isfidjah, which, according to Ibn Haukal, was situated beyond the Sihun on the Turkestan road, is represented by Sairam of later centuries. This later name does not appear in Abulfeda, but the Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) mentions Sairam among the cities of Turkestan. The Mohammedan authors do not mention Sairam among the cities taken by Chinghiz, although this name appears in tlie Chinese annals in connection with the Mongol invasion of Turkestan, and is repeatedly noticed in the itineraries of Chinese travellers to the west in the Mongol period (see i. 74, 1 30). The name is written Sai-lan there, as on the ancient map. Rashid (Berezin, i. 2) mentions Talas and Sairam among the countries and places inhabited from ancient times by Turkish tribes. Farther on (ibid. 13) the same place apparently is called Kary Sairam, Rashid states there that Talas and Kary Sairam are not far from the country where Abuldja khan (ancestor of the famous Oghuz khan, the progenitor of all the Turk tribes) was in the habit of
85* I may observe that there is in Central Asia a lake and a city which on our European maps bear the same name. The lake Sairam lies northeast of Kuldja (see note 167). The city of Sairam is situated in Chinese Turkestan, between Kucha and Aksu.

encamping in winter-time. He adds that Kary Sairam is an ancient and very large city, with forty gates. To cross it takes a whole day. In the days of Kashid this city was inhabited by Turk Mussulmans, and was subject to Kaidu. Ibid., p. 17, we read again that Oghuz khan, after obtaining the supremacy over his relatives who had attacked liim, ruled over the whole country stretching from Telash and Syrim (Talas and Sairam) to Bokhara. In the Yuan shi the capture of Sai-lan by the Mongols is recorded in chap, cli., biography of JSie-t* a-la-hai, one of Chinghiz khan's generals.
BA-RH-GnV-Ll-HAN=BAUK'H.ALlGUKE^T>.
With respect to this city, situated, according to Rashid, on the Sihun, and taken in 12 19 (or 1220) by Djuchi, see note 676. The Yuan shi calls it Ba-rh-djen. It is the Barchin of PL Carpini and the Parchin of king Haithon
(see i. 170). Lerch, I. c, speaks of ancient coins on which the name Barchin is found. The exact position of this city cannot be ascertained. The Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) mentions, among the cities of Turkestan, Djend, Bardjend (not larkand, as Quatrem^re reads), Otrar, Sairam, &c.
D/JJ!\r-I>/=DJEND.
This city was situated on the Lower Sihun. Ibn Haukal, quoted by Abulfeda, II. ii. 216, states that it was near Yanghikend (see note 6y6), It was near Djend that the troops of Mohammed Khorazm Shah had the first opportunity of fighting with the Mongols, before the main body of Chinghiz' army had arrived in Turkestan. In 1220 Djuchi captured Djend. Lerch, I. c, places the site of ancient Djend at Khoi^khuf, on the right bank of the Syr daria, about ten English miles north-west of Fort No. 2 (Karmakhchi).

Countries and Places in the Empire of Bu-SA-YiN, Persia.
BA-MOU=BAMlA^ (?).
This name is not found on the ancient map. It appears only in the list of the Si pei ti as a city belonging to Abu Said's empire, or Persia, without further notice. Ba-mou may be intended for Barnian, a district and important fortress in the Hindukush, taken and destroyed by Chinghiz in 1 22 1. A place of this name still exists, and was visited by Burnes in 1832, and some years ago by Kussian
travellers. I may, however, observe that there is also a place called Bam south-east of Kerman, which name likewise has some resemblance to Ba-mou, and is also an ancient city mentioned by Ibn Haukal.
T'A-BA-SIN = T:B.ABESSA^.
This name also is not marked on the ancient map, but it is noticed in the Si pei ti as a place of Persia. I am inclined to identify it with Thahessan or Thabes, in Kuhistan. See Barbier de Meynard, "Dictionnaire de la Perse," 388. Thabessan, or, as Abulfeda, II. ii. 189, writes the name, Tabasam, in Arabic means "the two (cities of) Thabas," for this place is formed by two cities.
FA-riN=KAIN {1).
This name also does not appear on the ancient map. It is only mentioned in the Si pei ti as a city of Persia. Perhaps Kain is meant, the ancient capital of the mountainous country of Kuhistan. It belonged to the Ismaeiians wlien Hulagu began the conquest of Persia. D'Ohsson,
iii. 158, 17$. This city still exists.



BOST—TALEKAN. 97
BU-SZ'-T'J!:=BOST.
This name is placed on the ancient map south-west of Ghiznin, and this position agrees well with Bost, a city of Seyistan (Sistan) on the river Hilmend. Bost is a very ancient city ; it is the Asbeste of the Zendavesta, the Bis of Isidore of Charax (first century of
our era). See Eitter, " Asia," vi. 64, 1 20. Bost is also spoken of by the Mohammedan chroniclers in connection witli Chinghiz' expedition to Western Asia (d'Ohsson, i. 195, 298). See also Abulfeda, II. ii. 108: Bost in Sidjestan, between Herat and Ghazna, on the river Hindmand. In the Ts'in cheng lu we read (see i. 293) : " In the spring of 1223 Chinghiz moved out with his array and proceeded northward, following the course of the Sin river (Sindh, Indus). . . . The third prince reached the city of Bn-si-sz'-dan, and asked Chinghiz' permission to attack it
;
but the emperor recalled his son in view of the hot season commencing." It seems that the Chinese name here represents the combined names of Bost and Sistan. In the Yuan ch'ao pi shi the invasion of Sistan by Tului, Chinghiz' fourth son, is recorded. Eashid, however, states that Ogotai, the third son of Chinghiz, after destroying Ghazna, asked permission to attack the city of Sistan; but Chinghiz objected, owing to the excessive heat, and recalled his son (d'Ohsson, i. 3 1 7). Bost in our days seems to be an unimportant place, generally not marked in our maps of Asia. In the great Eussian map of Asia I find the name of a place Kala Bist, where the Dori river discharges into the Hilmend. This is probably Bost.
T'A-LI-OAN=TALEKAN.
According to the early Arabic geoi^raphers, the name Talekan was applied to several cities or districts in Western Asia. H



98 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
Istakhri, in the teiitli century, mentions (p. 94) Talekan, a little town above Kazvin {i.e., in tlie Elburs Mountains), and near the district of Dilem (see p. 108). Compare also Abulfeda, II. ii. 168. Barbier de Meynard, /. c. 2,77
j
quotes tlie Persian geo;jrapher Mcstaufi (1330), who states that Talekan is a mountainous district east of Kazvin. Another Talekan appears in Istakhri's geography (119, 122), east of Balkh, near Badakhshan, as tlie capital of Tokharestan. He writes the name also Taikan. The Arabic geographers of the ninth and tenth centuries, quoted in Sprenger's *•' Post- und Eeiserouten des Orientes," distinguish between Tayiqan (Taikan), a city of Tokliarestan, and Taliqan, a city depending on Merv-alRud (now Meruchak). On Biruny's ( + 1038) map of Balkli and Tokharestan, No. 5 in Sprenger's maps, Taliqan appears west of Balkh, between this city and Merv-al-Eud, and Tayiqan east of Balkh.
Edrisi (eleventh century) notices a city, Talikan, east of Balkh, in Tokharestan (i. 475), and another of the same name west of Balkh in Khorassan (1468). See also Abuifeda, II. ii. 207, Taikan in Tokharestan, and 198, Talekan in Khorassan. Two distinct cities or districts Talekan are mentioned in the Persian records of the Mongol conquest of Western Asia. A district Talekan is noticed in the relation of Hulagu's military operations to invest the fortress of Meimnndiz in the Elburs Mountain in 1256 (d'Ohsson, iii. 194). Anotlier district of the same name was situated at the time of Chinghiz' invasion in the south-eastern part of the dominions of Khovarezm Shah. Rasliid reports (d'Ohsson, i. 273, 292, 294) that Ntissretkvh, a fortress in the mountainous district of Talekan, resisted the Mongols for seven months, but was finally taken, when Chinghiz himself arrived in 122 1. The Persian historian does not say whether this Talekan was east or west of Balkh. D'Ohsson on his map places it east of Kunduz, in Tokharestan, where a city of this name still exists. According



TALEKAN. 99
to Wood, who visited it in 1838, it is a poor place. I cannot find on the detailed Russian map a name resembling Talekan between Balkh and ^lerucbak ; but I may observe that on the Chinese mediaeval map T^a-li-r/an is marked between Balkh and Merv, in accordance with the Mohammedan geographers.
M. Polo (i. 160), after twelve days' journey eastward from Balkh, came to a fortified place called Taican, which is the still existing Talekan in Tokharestan.
Hiian ts'ang, in about 630, notices a country Ta-la-lcien, which to the west touches the boundary of Fo-la-sz, Persia. Prom his statements we can conclude that it lay west of Balkh. This is evidently the Talekan in Khorassan of the early Arabic geographers. In book xii. Hiian ts*ang enumerates twelve kingdoms, of which we can identify An-ta-lo-po (Anderab), K^uo-si-to (Khost), Huo (Kunduz), Kili- si-mo (Kishm), as belonging to the old land of Tu-ho'lo (Tokharestan).^^ He does not mention Talekan in Tokharestan. The Chinese annals (Yiian shi) record the capture of T'a-li-han by Chinghiz and his son Tului in 1222.
*55 Tokharestan is a name of very ancient date. The Tokhavl were known to Strabo, Plinius, and Ptolemy as occupying the land of the Upper Oxus. The Arabic geographers apply the above name to the land "between the Upper Oxus and the Hindukush Mountains. Sonietimf^s they include also Badakhshan in this appellation, Taikan (Talekan), Khulm, Bayi.in, Anderab are cities of Tokharestan. The name of I' u-huo-lo, meaning Tokharestan, appears in the Chinese annals first in the fifth century (History of the Northern Wei). In the History of the T'ang we read about this country that it was situated west of the Tsung ling mountains, south of the river Wu-ha (Wakhsh, Oxus). The Chinese of that period identify it with the country Ta hia (Da hae) of the time of the Han. In the seventh and eighth centuries the kingdom of T'u-huo-lo repeatedly sent embassies to the Chinese court. Hiian ts'ang mentions frequently the country of Tu-liolo. He states (book i.) : "Passing through the Iron Gates (from the north), we arrive at the country of Tu-holo. From north to south it is about 1000 11 in extent, from east to west 3000^4. On the east it is bounded by the Tsuwj liny mountains, on the west it touches on Po-U-sz' (Persia), on the south are the great Snowy Mountains, on the north the Iron Gates."

BA-LI-HEI ^BALKR.
Balkh, in Khorassan, is a very ancient city, frequently mentioned in the ancient historical records of the Persians. It is believed to be the Bactra of the early Greek authors. It is known that Alexander the Great conquered Bactriana, which province after him for many centuries was under Greek culture. Balkh was fearfully treated by Chinghiz. Though the city surrendered without resistance, the whole population was massacred by the Mongols in 1221 ; and two years iater, when Chinghiz again passed through Balkh, he ordered the slaughter of the inhabitants who had meanwhile settled there. M. Polo (i. 158) says with respect to the "noble and great city of Bale," that it was much greater in former days, before it had been ravaged and destroyed by the Tartars and other nations. The traveller saw many ruins there. He was told by the people that it was here that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius. Polo further states that here is the end of the empire of the Tartar Lord of the Levant (Ilkhan of Persia). And this city is also the limit of Persia in the direction between east and north-east. This statement is in accordance with our ancient map. It seems, however, that the frontier between Persia and the Middle Empire has often changed. D'Ohsson (iv. 268) states, after the Mohammedan historians, that, in 1300, Dua, khan of the Middle Empire, invested his son Kutlui,^ Shah with Ghaznin, Sidjistan, Balkh, Badakhshan, and Merv. Thus Balkh and Merv, assigned on our ancient map to Persia, seem then to have belonged to the Middle Empire. Balkh was probably known to the Chinese at an early date ; it is difficult, however, to venture any identification upon the vague descriptions of the countries of Western Asia as found in the histories of the Han, Wei, &c.



NISHABUR. loi
A. R^musat identifies the kingdom of Ta hia, reached by the Chinese general Chang K'ien in about 128 B.C., with Bactriana. Here in Ta hia, Chang K'ien first heard of India, whicli country lay some thousand li to the southeast of Ta hia. Hiian ts'ang, in his account of western countries, mentions a kingdom Fo-ho-la (probably erroneous Chinese characters), bounded on the north by the river Fo-tsu (Oxus ; see note 828). Vivien de St. Martin identifies Fo-ho-lo with Balkh. I may observe that the character fo was anciently pronounced ho. In the Ylian shi Balkh is repeatedly noticed, and the name is differently written there. In the annals, s. a. 1 22 1, the capture of Ban-le-ho by Chinghiz is recorded. In Subutai's biography the name is written Bi-li-han ; in Ho-sze-mai-li's biography, Yuan slii (chap, cxx.), A-la-hei. In the biography of ChVhan, Ylian shi (chap, cxxxvii.), it is stated that he was a native of Ban-le-ho, a city of the Si yil (Western Asia). Ch*ang Ch*un, on his way from Samarkand to the Hindukush, passed through the city of Ban-li, by which name again Balkh is meant. Ye-lii Cli'u ts*ai designates Balkh by the single character '^a?!. (See i. 23, 93.)
NAI-SUA-BU-RH = NISHABUR.
This name is found in the list of the Si pei ti, but not on the ancient map. Evidently Nishabur, or Naisabur, as Abulfeda writes the name, the ancient capital of Khorassan is meant ; for Nishabur is repeatedly mentioned under nearly the same name in the Ylian shi, in connection with the Mongol invasion of Persia. In the annals, s. a. 122 1, the name of Nishabur is rendered hy Ni-clia-wu-rh^^ (see Part II.) ; in the biography of the Uigur prince Ba-rh-chu (see Uigurs) by Ni-slia-hu-li ; and in the biography of Ho
sze-mai-li, Ylian shi (chap, cxx.), by Ni-sha-hu-rh.
®^ Abulfeda (11. ii. 189) says that the Persian name of the city is Nishawur.



I02 . CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
According to the Mohammedan historians, Nishabur wastaken and destroyed by the Mongols in April 1221. Nishabur is an ancient city. It is the Niscea of the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Nigaia of the Zendavesta (Hitter, " Asien," vi.a. 56). The Arabic and Persian authors, however, record that Nishabur was founded by King Shapor (Sapor II., 3 1 0-3 80) of the Sassanian dynasty, and that the name is. derived from its founder.
SA- LA-HA -SI= SARAKHS.
This name also is only found in the Si pel ti, not on the map. It seems Sarakhs is meant, a city of Khorassan mentioned by the early Arab geographers. Its foundation is attributed to the early kings of Persia. A city of thisname still exists south-west of Merv, on the river Herirud. This place is mentioned in the Mohammedan relations of Chinghiz' expedition to Western Asia (d'Ohsson, i. 281). The capture of a place Si-la-sz' by the Mongols isrecorded in the Ylian shi, s. a. 1221, where the name appears together with Merv and Maruchak, and probably is intended for Sarakhs.^^^
BA- WA-RH-DI= BAVERD.
Ba-wa-rh-di is also missing from the ancient map. The list of the Si pei ti places it together with Merv and Sarakhs. Probably Baverd or Ahiverd is meant, a city of Khorassan mentioned by the ancient Arabic and Persian geographers. In map No. 4, Khorassan, in Sprenger's" Post- und Reiserouten des Orientes," according to Biruny and the Atwal, Abiverd is placed north-west of Sarakhs, between this city and Nasa. But d'Ohsson on his map locates Nessa between Serakhs and Abiverd. Abiverd is not marked on the detailed Russian map. On Petermann'smap of Iran and Turan, 1879, I find Abiverd about sixty

MERV, 103
two English miles east of Askhabad, on the border of the desert. Peterniann draws probably from some old map pnrtly based upon Mohammedan information. I have not met with the name of Baverd or Abiverd ia d'Ohsson's "History of the Mongols ; " but it seems that in the Yiian shi, in chap, cxxiii., this name appears in the biography of A-lo.'Wa-rh-sz\ where we read that he was a Hui-hu (Mohammedan) from Ba-wa-rh, a commander of a thousand in his country. When Chinghiz' army arrived at Ba-wa-rh, A-la-wa-rh-sz' surrendered and subsequently entered the Mongol service. Compare about Abiverd, Abulfeda, II. ii. 185, 186; Barbier de M., ^. c. 13, 563 {sub Nessa). The name of Baverd, written also Abiverd^ occurs frequently in the Zafernameh ; conquest of Khorassan by Timur, 1382-92, ii. 37, 48; iii. 18, &c. Clavijo, on his way from Northern Persia to Samarkand and back in 1404, passed through Baverd. The name is misspelt in the itinerary : Buelor and Bauhartel {no, 181). Baverd was visited in 1566 by the Turkish Admiral Sidi Ali (" Journ. Asiatique," ix.).
MA-LI-WU='^KK\] OR MERV.
Ma-li-wu is marked on the ancient map south of Bokhara, and evidently denotes Maru (Meru) or Merv, one of the four capitals (Merv, Herat, Nishabur, Balkh) of Khorassan in the Middle Ages (d'Ohsson, i. 245). Marit is one of the places of abundance of the Zendavesta (Ritter, /. c. vi.a. 52). The province Margiana, with the city of Antiochia of Isidore of Charax, is the same as Merv {ibid,
120). The early Arab geographers write Maru, Mem, or MarVy
and distincruish two cities of this name, one of which is
CD '
called Mei^ Shahidjan, the other Meru-al-Rnd. Both are situated on the river Meru-rud, called also Mitrghab
(Istakliri, 116, 118; Abulfeda, II. ii. 195, 196). According to Istakhri, it was near Meru Shahidjan that Yezdejerd, the last king of the Sassanian kingdom, was slain.



104 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
in a mill (a.d. 652). This event is also reported in the Shahnameh. During Chinghiz' expedition to Western Asia, Merv was plundered several times by the Mongols, as the Persian historians record. They mean probably Merv Shahidjan, which was the more important of the two cities ; whilst Mei'tcchak in the same relation (d'Ohsson, i. 280) is Merv-al-Eud. In the Yuan shi mention is made of both cities. It is stated there that in 122 1 T*o-lei took the cities of Ma-lu-dia-ye-k*o, Ma-lu, and Si-la-sz\ The first name is evidently intended for Meruchak. This latter place is identified by Ritter (I. c. 229) with Merv-al-Rud. Meruchak still exists on the river Murghab, about no English miles south-east of Merv.
DI-HI-SZ'-DA N= DIHISTAN.
Dehistan is still the name of the country bordering on the south-eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, north of the Atrek river. Hammer derives the name from the Baoi of Herodotus, and the Daai, a people of Hyrcania, according to Strabo. Istakhri (103) states that Dehistan is a city situated on a neck of land, fifty parasangs from Aheskun (see note 669] . Abulfeda, II. ii. 181, writes the name Dihistan, According to some authors he quotes, Dihistan was also the name of a whole province in the above-stated region. The Tarikh Djihankushai spells the name Dihistan (d'Ohsson, i. 259). Turkan Khatun, the mother of Mohammed Shah, proceeded from Urghendj to Mazanderan through Dihistan. The same name appears once more in d'Ohsson's translation from the Persian historians ; in iv. 685 we read that Hassan and Talish, the sons of Chuban, a revolted general of Abu Said, in 1327 fled from Mazanderan through Dihistan to Khovarezm. On the Catalan map Deystam is marked on the southeastern corner of the Sea of Baku (Caspian).



DJURDJAN—THAMISEH. 105
DJ U- LI-DJA NG = DJ URDJAN.
Djurdjan or Gurgan in the Middle Ages was a famous city situated on the river Guran or GiurgJien, whicli discharges into the south-eastern corner of the Caspian Sea. It is believed that Djurdjan is the Vehrkana of the Zendavesta, and the Hyrkania of the ancient Greek and Eoman writers. See Ritter, "Asia," vi.a. 61. Gurgan is mentioned in the early history of Persia (Shahnameh, i. 393) together with Uehistan. All the early Arab geographers speak of Gurgan or Djurdjan. The latter, according to Yakut, is the Arabic pronunciation (Barbier d. M., l. c. 481). According to Mas'udi, in the tenth century, the trade of Russia with Balkh, Rayi, Bagdad passed through Djurdjan (Abulfeda, lix.). After Timur had subdued Mazanderan in 1392, he ordered the magnificent palace of Shasnian to be built near Djurdjan (Zafernameh, iii. 20). The ruins of ancient Djurdjan are still to be seen. Fraser in 1822 visited the Qurgan river, and saw from a distance a remarkable old tower belonging to Djurdjan {Ritter, /. c. via, 358). In 1849 Bode published a description of these ruins (Dorn's "Caspia," 53, 54).
r A-MI-SHB=TB. AMISER.
This name is placed on the map between Djurdjan and Simnan (see the next), and I have little doubt Thamiseh or Tamis is intended, a city of Tabaristan, according to the early Arab geographers. Istakhri, 98 ; Sprenger's ** Postrouten ; " Abulfeda, 11. ii. 178. Yakut (Barbier de M,, 394) states that this place was situated in the plain of Tabari, sixteen farsakhs from Sariah (see farther on), on the boundary between Tabaristan and Khorassan. The Persians call it also Nemiseh.



I06 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
SI-M[/.NIANO = Sni^Al^.
Istakhri states (98) tliat Simnan is a city in the district
of Komesh; Abulfeda (II. ii. 178) calls it the capital of Kiimess ; other geographers (Yakut) consider Dameghan to be the capital of Kumess. Thie city of Simnan still
exists. It lies south-west of Damejjhan, on the sjreat hicjhway from Kliorassan to Teheran (Eayi). The Mohammedan historians- of the Mongol period frequently mention Simnan. See d'Ohsson, i. 248, iii. 194,
iv. 177, 675.
S^-i/-r4 = SARIA OR SARI.
Sari is still the name of a city in the Persian provinceof Mazanderan. It is an ancient city, mentioned already in the early history of Persia. See Shahnameh, i. 297,. where Sari is coupled with Amol (see the next). The Arab geographers notice it among the cities of Tabaristan. Istakhri (ico) writes the name Sarie ; Biruny and the Atwal, Saria (Sprenger, Z. c.) ; Abulfeda, II. ii. 178^ Sariyah. Thus the spelling Sa-li-ya on our map is jus
tified.
Piitter, "Asien," vi.a. 478, 529, identifies Sari with the Sauloe of Isidore of Charax (first century). In the history of the T'ang dynasty Sari is mentioned as a city of Tabaristan in the eighth century or earlier.
We read there, at the end of the article Fo-sz' (Persia), of a country T'^o-po-sz-tan^ bounded on three sides by mountains, and on the north by a little sea (the Caspian). The ruler of this kinirdom had his residence in So-li.^^^ From ancient times these princes were commanders-in-chief of the Persian eastern army. When Persia was destroyed by the Ta-shi (Arabs), T*o-po-sze-tan refused to surrender, A prince of this country named Hu-lu-han in 746 sent an

AMOL—KHOVAR, 107
envoy to the Chinese court. The Chinese emperor granted him a title. Eight years later Hu-lu-han's son, Tze-hui-lo, entered the Chinese service. The kin<?dom of TVoo-sz'-tan was finally destroyed by the Black-coated Ta-shi (Arabs).^*
A-AfU-LI=AUOL.
Araol is correctly placed on the map west of Sari. It is still the name of a city in Mazanderan, on the river Harhaz, about eight English miles distant from the Caspian Sea. Amol is an ancient city mentioned in the Shahnameh, and by the early Arab geographers as the capital of Tabaristan. Ibu Haukal mentions it as an important place of trade for silk. It was a renowned emporium in the time of Harun al Rashid. Dorn, in his " Caspia," 26, translates a passage from a history of Tabristan written in 12 16, in which it is said that Amol is the emporium for the merchandise brought (by sea) from Bulgar and Saksin (see
note 720). In 1220 Amol was sacked by the Mongol troops under the command of Chebe, sent in pursuit of Mohammed Shah (d'Ohsson, i. 252).
HU-WA-RH=:KaOYAR.
Hu-wa-rh is marked on the map south of Sari, and is the Khovar of the Mohammedan authors. According to Kitter, I. c. 118, Khovar is the Choarene of Isidore of Charax, the Choara of Pliny, near the Caspise portae. Istakhri (99) says that Khovar is a small city situated on a river which runs down from the Denbavend. Abulfeda states (II. ii. 171) that it is a city between Simnan and Eayi, and depending on the latter. The Mohammedan authors translated by d'Ohsson frequently mention Khovar
(iii. 193, iv. 177, 678).
85' See my pamphlet "On the Knowledge Possessed by the Ancient Chinese of the Arabs," &c., p. 9.



io8 CHINESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
The city of Khovar cannot be traced now-a-days, but tlie name has survived in that of a defile and a plain south east of the present Teheran (which lies near the ruins of Ravi). This defile answers to the Portce Caspice of Pliny and the Pi/Ice Caspice of Arrian. It leads through a southern spur of the Elburs chain, which projects into the plain country, separating the fertile plain of Veramin (situated towards Teheran) from that of Khavar or Khar, I can speak of this region from personal observation.
z)/-/.zj5:jv=dilem.
Dilem is a name generally applied to the mountainous part of the Persian province of Ghilan ; but some ancient geographers refer this appellation to the whole of the present Ghilan. Thus Istakhri (97) states that Dilein consists of a mountainous part and a plain extending along the Caspian Sea. The latter part is called Ghilan. Mokadassi in the tenth century (see Sprenger, L c.) includes also Tabarestan, Gurgan, Kumess, and even Khozar beyond the Caspian in the general name Dailem. Abulfeda, II. ii. 172, distinguishes between Dilem and Ghilan, and applies the former name only to the mountainous country south of Ghilan. The traveller who crosses the Elburs chain on his way from Kazvin to Eesht has to pass through Dilem. In the tenth century the kings of Dilem conquered a great part of Persia. Their dynasty is known in history under the name of Dilernits or Buyids. They ruled from
A.D. 934 to 1056.
When the Mongols first invaded Persia, Dilem was in possession of the Ismaelians, who had there several strong castles, Alamut, Zemhasser, Meimundiz, and others. (d'Ohsson, iii. 157—160). When Hulagu went, in 1256, to attack Alamut, he passed by the way of Shakerek^ the ancient residence of the kings of Dilem (/. c. 197). Oldjaitu, khan of Persia, in 1307 was obliged to under



ALAMUT—LEMBESSER. 109
take an expedition against the people of Dileni, who refused to acknowledge the supremacy of the khan (J.c,
iv. 188).
A-LA-MU-TE= ALAUVT,
The castle of Alamut was one of the stronfjest among tie Ismaelian mountain castles in Persia in the thirteenth century. It was built in 860 by a prince of Dilem, on an inaccessible rock in the Elburs Mountains. The water of tlie river Bahir had been conducted to this rock, and surrounded it partly. In 1090, Hassan, chief of the Isinaelians, made himself master of this castle, which belonged to the Seldjuk Sultan Melik Shah, who was then reigning over Persia. Alamut became the residence of the Ismaelian chiefs. This chief used to be called by the Crusaders " the Old Man of the Mountain," and thus he is also termed by M. Polo, i. 145. Alamut was taken by Hulagu, December 20, 1256. See d'Ohsson, iii. 199, 157. Mohammed of Nessa states that Kazvin is the nearest city to Alamut. The name means " Eagle's nest." Colonel Monteith, who ill 1832 visited the ancient country of the Assassins or Ismaelians, has rediscovered Mount Alamut^ north-east of Kazvin ; the ruins of the castle are still to be seen there. The river Shah rud takes
its rise near Mount Alamut (Hitter, I. c. 592).
LAN-BA.SA-Rff= LEMBESSER.
Lembesser or Lemsher was the name of another castle of the Ismaelians, also situated in Dilem, and in the district of Budbar,^^ not far from Alamut, according to Qiiatre
^^ The name of the ancient district of Rudhar, frequently mentioned in the Persian relations of Hulagu's expedition against the Ismaelians (d'Ohseon, iii. 158, 197, &c.), occurs much earlier. Istakhri, 97, states that Rudvar is the residence of the kings of Dilem. See aliso Sprenger, I. c, map No. 6, Ghilan and Tabarestan : Rudzabar, capital of Daylem. Rud

mbve ("Mongols," 143, note). But the exact position of it has not been ascertained. Lembesser was taken by the Mongols in January 1257, it seems. See d'Ohsson, iii.
160, 164, 191, 192, 200. The positions of Alamut and Lembesser, as given on the ancient map, are not correct.
K'O-DSI-YUN^KAZYl'N,
The well-known city of Kazvin, on the great highway from Teheran (near ancient Eayi) to Tabriz, south of the Elburs chain. It is said to have been founded by the Sassanian king, Sapor II., 310-380. (Barbier de M., I.e.
441.)
bar is still the name of a large village, or rather several villages, in the Sefidrud valley, in the Elburs, on the road from Kazvin to Resht. The Pex-sian historians enumerate only five of the numerous mountain castles of tlie Ismaelians in Kuhistan and in the Elburs Mountains, viz., Alamut, Lembesser, Meiniundiz, Lai, and Gkirdkuh. The first four of these were in Dilem, and I understand in the district of Rudbar, which, as d'Ohsson states (iii. 158), was " h^riss^ de chateaux." The exact site of Lembesser and Meimimdiz has not been ascertained. The latter place, commanded by Rokn-eddin, the chief of the Ismaelians, himself surrendered, November 9, 1256 [l. c. 193-196). Lai {I. c. 192) is still the name of a village in the Elburs Mountain, north-east of Rudbar (see Buhse's map of Northern Persia, appended to his Botanical Exploration of these regions, i860). As to Ghirdkuh or Kerdchkuli (Round Mountain), d'Ohsson is mistaken in noticing it repeatedly (I. c. 189, 190, 192) as a mountain castle of the Ismaelians in Kuhistan (south-west of Herat). Ghirdkuh was in the district of Kumes, three parasangs west of Damcghan, as Quatremere states ("Mongols," 278, note) on the authority of Mohammedan authors. This castle opposed a strong resistance to the Mongols. When Hulagu, in 1 256, ^'utered Persia, the Mongol general Kitubuka had been besieging Ghirdkuh for two years, but in vain (d'Ohsson, I. c. 189). According toRashid (Quatremere, I. c), this castle surrendered only in 1270. Ghirdkuh is probably the Tvjado in Haithon's " Account of Asiatic Kingdoms," 181, of which he thus speaks : "The Assassins had an impregnable castle called Tif/ado, which was furnished with all necessaries, and was so strong that it had no fear of attack on any side. Howbeit, Halcon (Hulagu) commanded a certain captain of his that he should take 10,000 Tartars who had been left in garrison in Persia, and with them lay siege to the said castle, and not leave it till he had taken it. Wherefore the said Tartars continued besieging it for twenty-seven years, winter and summer,



SAVA. Ill
Kazviii was taken by the Mongols (Subutai and Chebe) in 1 22 1, and the inhabitants were massacred (d'Ohsson, i. 325). Hulagii, in 1256 and 1257, when attacking the castles of the Ismaelians in Dilem, had his head-quarters in Kazvin (I. c. iii. 200). Ghazan Khan died near Kazvin
in 1304 (I.e. iv. 349). King Haithon, the traveller, terms this city Khezovin.
M. Polo (i. 84) calls Casvin one of the eight kingdoms of
Persia.
SA-IVA=SAYA.
Sava, according to Yakut (Barbier de M., I. c. 298), a city between Eayi and Hamadan. Ibn Haukal, quoted in Abulfeda, 11. ii. 168, states that it lies west of Eayi, and
without being able to take it. At last the Assassins surrendered from fiheer want of clothing, but not of victuals or other necessaries." Ghirdkuh is also mentioned by the Chinese authors ; but they record its capture by the Mongols, it seems, too early, or confound this castle with Meimundiz. Thus in the biography of the Mongol general Kuo K'an, it is reported that in 1256 he arrived at the fortress Ki-du-bu, situated on the top of the mount Dan-han, and accessible only by suspended ladders, which were guarded by the most valiant troops of the Mu naihi (Mulahida or Assassins). Kuo K'an invested the place, but it could not be taken. It was then battered by means of catapults, when the commandant Bu-djona-shi-rh (Khodja Nasser-eddin ; see note 356) surrendered. For further •details see L 134. In the narrative of Ch'ang Te, who was in Persia in 1259, we read : *' The realm of the Mu-nai-hi had 360 mountain fortresses, all which had been reduced. There was, however, west of Dan-han, a mountain fortress K'i-du-bu-gu on a very steep rock, which could not be reached either by arrows or by stones (thrown by catapults). The rock was so steep that when one looked upwards his cap fell off." After this ihe author gives some details regarding the capture of this fortress by the Mongols (see i. 133). In the aimals of the Yiiau shi, the siege of Ghirdkuh is also reported, and s. a. 12 "2. The name is written there quite correctly Ghi-rh-du-k'ie. I have little doubt that in the above-quoted Chinese statement about K'i-du-bu-gu being situated west of Dan-han, the latter name denotes Dameyhan, By the fortress of Shirdckuh near Damghan, mentioned in the Zaferuameh, s. a. 1384 (II. chap, xlviii.), it seems Ghirdkuh is to be understood. The above-mentioned map, appended to Buhse's " Travels in Northern Persia," is the only European map showing the site of Ghirdkuh, northwest of Damghan. Buhse evidently visited the place, but its name does -not appear in the text.



112 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
south of Talaknn (which was near Kazvin). Sava was destroyed by the Mongols in 1 224 (d'Ohsson, i. 349). Sava is the city of Saha in Persia, from which, as M. Polo believes (i. 79, 82), the Three Magi set out when they went to worship Jesus Christ. Tlie city of Sava still exists, fifty miles south-west of Teheran. It is described by Consul Abbot, who visited iD
in 1849.
KO-::>HANG==KASliAN.
Kashan, north of Isfahan, is an ancient city, repeatedly mentioned in the early history of Persia (see Shahnameh, iii. 1 17, 141), and by all the Arab geographers. Kashan was for the first time plundered by the Mongols in 1224. D'Ohsson, i. 349, states that in the beginning of 1224 a Mongol detachment proceeded from Khorassan to Bayi, plundered and destroyed this city, and then attacked Save (Sava), X^icm, and Kashan, which cities suffered the
same fate. Odoric calls Cassan, which he passed through in about 1320, a royal city of great repute, the city of the Three Magi. But the Tartars had to a great extent destroyed it.
I.SZr-FA-HANO=l^-FA.-Rklii,
All the Mohammedan geographers agree that Isfahan is a very ancient city. Kaikobad, the founder of the second Persian dynasty (Kayanides), is reported to have established his residence in Isfahan ; but the residence of the kings of Persia was subsequently transferred in turn to Susa, Persepolis, and Madain. When the Seldjuk dynasty was ruling over Iran in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Isfahan again became, for a time at least, the capital. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Iran was conquered by the Sultan of Khorazm. When the Mongols first invaded Iran, they did not advance as far as Isfahan ; nor when Hulagu subdued the whole of Persia, did this

city share the common fate of the other cities. At least d'Ohssoii does not mention Isfahan in connection with the Mongol invasion of Persia. In the annals of the Yiian shi, s. a. 1229, reign of Ogotai, it is recorded that the chief of the city of I-sz-bala-na in the Si yil (Western Asia) surrendered. Tiie Ts iu cheng In states, under the same year, that the chief of the city of I-sz -ha-la-na sent an envoy with tribute to the Mongol court. Perhaps Isfahan is meant here. In d'Ohsson, ii. 92, we read (after Eashid) that the brother of the prince of Pars arrived at the court of Ogotai with, valuable presents.
A-BA-HA-Rn=ABYiA.K
Abhar is still the name of a city and a river westsouth-west of Kazvin. Istakhri (100) places it between Kazvin and Zendjan, as do also Ibn Khurdadbeh and Abulfeda (II. ii. 166). This city is frequently mentioned by the Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period
(d'Ohsson, iii. 49 ; iv. 8, 566, 706, 734). D'Ohsson spells the name Ehher. It seems that in the days of the Mongols the great high* way from Ptayi (near present .Teheran) to Tabriz passed througli Abhar. The stations west of Dameghan in Haithon's itinerary when returning from Mongolia are: Hre% Khezovin, Avakhr (Abhar), As I know from per^ sonal observation, Abhar lies a little south of the present post-road between Kazvin and Zendjan (resp. Teheran
Tabriz), which passes directly from Kazvin to Sain kala.^^
SUN-DAN-NI- r^ = SULTANIAH.
Saltaniah was the name given to the city founded in 1305 in Media, between Kazvin and Zendjan, by
^^ Chardin, who proceeded from Tabriz vid Kazvin to Isfahan about 225 years ago, passed by the ancient road from Sultanieh to Sancala, and then through the little town of Ebher to Kazvin (Chardin, "Voy. ea Persft," ii. 383).

Oldjaitii, the great-giandson of Hiilagu. For further details see d'Ohsson, iv. 485. Oldjaitu established his residence here, and his successor, Abu Said, resided also in Sultaniah. Thus at the time our mediaeval map was compiled, Sultaniah was the royal residence. Abu Said, who died in 1335, was buried in the mausoleum which he had ordered to be built in his lifetime at Sultaniah (I. c. 720). Odoric, who saw Sultaniah about 1320, says (Yule's ** Cathay," 49): " Departing . from the city of Tauris, I travelled for ten days, and reached a certain city called Soldania, in which dwelleth the emperor of the Persians in the summer season." On the Catalan map the same city is termed Sodania. It was the See of an Archbishop about 1330 ("Cathay," 238). Compare also Abulfeda, II. ii. 157, and Barbier de M.,
I c. 315. Sultaniah was destroyed by Timur at the end of the fourteenth century. He left only the magnificent mosque, which is still admired by travellers who pass by the great caravan and post-road from Teheran to Tabriz. Chardin states (ii. 378) that the father of Shah Abas the Great, who resided at Sultaniah, was buried near this mosque. As is known. Shah Abas transferred the royal residence from Sultaniah to Isfahan. The position assigned to. Sultaniah on the ancient map in relation to Kazvin and Abhar is not correct.

Zendjan or Zandjan is mentioned by the early Arab geographers as a city of Djebal, near the boundary of Azarbaidjan. Istakhri, 1 00 ; Sprenger, I, c. map No. 7
;
Abulfeda, II. ii. 165. Zendjan is often mentioned by the Mohammedan historians relating the Mongol invasions. Subutai sacked the city in 1221. It was near Zendjan that Abu Said in 13 19 defeated the troops of a mutinous general (d'Ohsson, i. 325 ; iv. 635, 640). The city still exists, north-west of Sultaniah.



DERBEND. 115
DU-IW-BEN=I>ERBE1^D
Derbend is a very common name in Persian geography. The word means, according to d'Herbelot, " passage diroit et ferme." By Du-rh-ben on our ancient map, a place located in the north-western part of Persia, only Derbend on the western shore of the Caspian Sea can be meant, a very important strategic point in the Middle Ages, and long before that period. The Arab geographers call Derbend Bah-ul-abvah, meaning " the gate of gates." The Turks call it Demir kapi
(Iron gate). Mas'udi, ii. 2, 3, in speaking of the Kahhh Mountains (Caucasus), states that the Persian king Khosru Anushirvan (531-5/9) built a city called Bah-ul-dbvab on a point between the mountains and the Sea of the Khazars (Caspian). The same king erected also the celebrated wall, which on the one side projects (at Bab-ul-abvab) into the sea for about a mile, whilst on the other side it extends for forty parasangs over the steepest summits and deepest gorges of the mountains to a fortified place called Tabarestart. The wall has from three to three miles an iron gate. Troops were posted there to defend the passages and protect Persia against the tribes settled in the vicinity of the Kabkh Mountains, as the Khazars, the Alans, the Turks, &c. Compare also note 846, and Klaproth's translation of the Derbend Nameh or History of Derbend, written in the sixteenth century (" Nouv. Journ. Asiat.," iii. 439 seq.). There is also another Eastern tradition, to which M. Polo alludes, according to which the wall in question was built by Alexander the Great, and therefore the Persians call it also Sadd Eskanderi (d'Herbelot, " Bibl. Or."). In an Armenian geography, erroneously attributed to Moses of Chorene (who wrote a little after 440), mention is made of the wall of Derbend. Professor Patkanoff has proved that this ancient treatise was written in the seventh
century.

About the end of the seventh century Deibend was taken by the Arabs. This place sustained an important rdle during tlie Middle Ages, and is frequently spoken of by tlie Mohammedan writers who relate the Mongol invasion of Western Asia and the wars of the Persian khans with the khans of Kipchak. Subutai, who in 1222 first carried the Mongol arms north of the Caucasus, passed through Derbend, which then belonged to the little kingdom of Shirvan. He was not able to take the citadel, where E-ashid Shirvan S^ah had shut himself up (d'Ohsson, i. 336). In 1262 Barkai, khan of Kipchak, sent a host of 30,000 men under the command of Nogai against Hulagu. Nogai passed through Derbend into the province of Shirvan. He was at first successful, but was afterwards forced to letire ; Hulagu then proceeded through Derbend in pursuit of him. Some time -after, Hulagu's son Abaka was defeated by Barkai and pursued as far as Derbend (d'Ohsson, iii. 379). This war is also recorded by M. Polo, ii. 495. In 1266 there was another battle fought between Barkai and Abaka near Derbend, in which the former was vanquished (d'Ohsson, iv. 180). In 13 18 Uzbeg, Khan of Kipchak, invaded the dominions of Abu Said and attacked Derbend (ibid. 613). In 1325 Choban, one of Abu Said's generals, passed through Derbend, and advanced as far as the river Terek (ibid. 666), Under the year 1334 another invasion by Uzbeg through Derbend is recorded (ibid, y 16). The first European traveller who mentions Derbend is the Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, in 11 70. He terms it the Iron Gate of Alexander. Rubruck in 1255 writes (252): "Post hos (Lesgos) est Porta ferrea quam fecit Alexander ad excludendos barbaros gentes de Perside." Farther on Rubruck relates his passing through the Porta ferrea on his way back. On p. 263 we read : ^' Est alius qui dicitur Jerra (Berca). frater Baatu qui pascit versus Portam ferream, ubi est.



DERBEND. I17
iter Sarracenorum omnium venientium de Perside et de Turkia." Haithon the traveller calls Derbend by its Persian name (see Part L). Marco Polo notices the Iron Gate, of which the book of Alexander speaks (i. 52). The ancient Russian annals of the thirteenth century speak of the Jeleznya vorota (Iron Gates), by which the high mountains of the Yasy (Asi, Alans) and Cherkess might be avoided (Karamzin, iv. 355). In the days of Timur, Derbend still retained its strategical importance. In 1387 Timur, when encamped on the Araxes, sent his troops against the Kipchaks, who had passed Derbend. In 1395 the conqueror, at the head of liis army, passed Derbend from Shirvan, defeated the Kipchaks, and then invaded Russia (Zafernameh, ii. 56,
iii. 51).
Although Edrisi, ii. 329, enumerates twelve defiles by which the Caucasus could be crossed, it seems nevertheless that in ancient times the only practicable road leading from Persia to the regions north of the Caucasus passed by Derbend. As is known, a splendid artificial road, crossing the middle of the Caucasian range near Mount Kazbek, since the year 1800 connects Russia with the Transcaucasian provinces. Derbend, which since the year 1806 has belonged to Russia, is now one of the finest cities of those regions, situated very picturesquely with its old walls on the slope of the eastern termination of the Caucasus and on the Caspian Sea. A good view of Derbend is given in Yule's " Marco Polo," i. 57. Yule complains that he was not able to find any modern information regarding the famous Caucasian wall which begins at Derbend. I may therefore observe that interesting details on the subject are found in Legkobytov's " Survey of the Russian Dominions beyond the Caucasus " (in Russian), 1836, vol. iv. p. 1 58-161, and in Dubois de Montpereux's " Voyage autour du Caucase," 1 840, vol. iv. p. 291 298, from which I shall give here an abstract :




Ii8 CIIL\ESE MEDIAEVAL MAP.
The city of Derbend is situated on the slope of tlie mountains which descend towards the sea-shore. It is bounded on three sides by walls, of which the northern and the southern are about three versts in length. These walls project into the sea ; and to the south-west they ascend a steep rock more than a thousand feet high, and join the citadel called Naryn kale. (This is evidently the same citadel which the Mongols were unable to take ; v. supra.) The famous Bagh hary (mountain wall) now begins at the village of Bjelgan, four versts south-west of Derbend, but we know that as late as the beginning of the last century it could be traced down to the southern gate of the city. This ancient wall then stretches westward to the high mountains of Tdbasseran (it seems the Tabarestan of Mas'udi). About the commencement it is in a demolished state, but farther on among the wooded mountains it is well preserved. The outer stones of the wall are well hewn, 3 J feet square, and nearly a foot thick. The middle of the wall consists of smaller stones, which, though not hewn, are closely fitted in. At some places the wall measures more than 20 feet in height (originally it was obviously higher), the thickness beinc? not less than seven feet. Trees of remarkable size have grown upon the wall, and frequently these have caused it to fall to pieces. At distances of from a thousand to fourteen hundred feet it is provided with towers and bastions. Thirty-six versts from Derbend, at the village of Lidjili, a well-preserved ancient gate in the wall can be seen. Farther westward an ancient fort connected with the wall is known under the name of Kedjeli kala. It is 28 feet high, 84 feet long, and 24 broad. This western section of the Caucasian wall stretches with some interruptions to Maghal Kushandaga, in the district of Kazikumyhj about eighty versts from Derbend. It is an error to believe that there existed a continuous wall running over the Caucasus chain from the Caspian to the Black Sea. As the Caucasus itself represents to a great extent an insurmountable barrier, it was only required to



BARDA A. 119
shut up the entrances of the defiles leading over the mountains in order to prevent invasions from the north. Thus many remains of that ancient wall are found in the upper valleys of the northern slope of the Caucasus range, and especially in its middle part, in the vicinity of Mount Kazbek. Dubois de Montpereux enumerates the following sites of remains of the wall :

In the famous defile of Dariel, north-east of the Kazbek
(see note 846). In the valley of the Assai river, near Wapila, about 35 versts north-east of Dariel. In the valley of the Kizil river, about 15 versts northwest of the Kazbek. Farther west, in the valley of the Fiaf/ or Foff river, between Lacz and Khilak. From this place farther west about 25 versts, in the valley of the Arredon river, in the district of Valaghir. Finally, the westernmost section of the Caucasian wall has been preserved, which was evidently intended to shut up the maritime defile of Gagry on the Black Sea.
BA-RH-DA-A = BARDA A.
Bardaa, an ancient city, founded, according to Yakuts by King Kobad of Persia (491-531). See Barbier de M., 91. It is mentioned by all the ancient Arab and Persian geographers as the capital of the kingdom of ArraUy by which name the Mohammedan authors designate the country between the rivers Kur and Araxes. The Armenian authors call the same Aghovania. Bardaa in the Middle Ages was a large and rich city. Masudi, ii. 75, states that the river Kur passes at a distance of three miles from Bardaa. Bardaa is of special interest in the early history of Russia. The Armenian and Mohammedan authors agree in recording that in a.d. 944 the Russians captured and plundered Bardaa (Dorn's " Caspia," 285-304). Moses Caghancatovatsi, who lived about the middle or



120 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
towards the end of the tenth century, and whose birthplace was not very far from Berdaa, reports that in the said year a northern people called R^tzik sailed through the Caspian Sea, and arrived unexpectedly at Partav, the capital of Aghovania^'^ captured and plundered the city, and killed the inhabitants. After six months they left
the ruined city (Dorn, I.e. 285, 286). Ibn el Athir (+ 1233) records (he draws evidently from an earlier author) under the same year the same predatory expedition of the Russians, who from the Caspian Sea sailed up the river Kur, and captured and plundered
Bardaa (I. c. 296). It seems d'Ohsson mentions Bardaa only once, iii. 178.
A vizier of Sultan Djelal-eddin sojourned there in 1228. Bardaa was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church in the fourteenth century (Yule's " Cathay," cclv.). Bardaa is frequently mentioned by the historians of Timur. In 1400 the conqueror encamped ten days in the plain of Bardaa, which at that time was the capital of the Karabagh^^ (Zafernameh, v. 8). Dorn states (l. c. 263) that Nadir Shah of Persia (1735-47) destroyed Bardaa. Dorn (/. c. 45) in 1861 visited the ruins of Bardaa. He
gives an illustration of a remarkable tower there. These ruins are situated on the right bank of the river Tetter, a southern affluent of the Kur, near the village of Bardeh, which is on the left bank, south-east of Elisabethopol.
SHE-LI-WANG = SHIRVAN.
By She-li ivang the compiler of the ancient map apparently means Shirvaii, in the eastern part of Trans
^2 It seems Albania is intended. The same name, Aghovania, occurs in Haithon's itinerary (see note 457), and is applied there to Shirvan, the country situated between the Kur river and the Caspian Sea, the Albania of Ptolemy and Strabo, which Rubruck also designates by the name Albania. It does not seem, however, that ancient (Caucasian) Albania included also the land between the Kur and the Araxes. 8^ Now-a-days the city of Shusha is the capital of the Karaha(j\ as the country between the Kur and Araxes is called.



TAKHT I SOLEIMAN. 121
Caucasia (see note 862) ; but he is mistaken iu locating it too far south. Mas'udi states (ii. 4) that after Anushirvan (531-579) had founded Babel-abwab (Derbend) he countenanced several (small) kingdoms in the region of the Caucasus. Among these there was the kingdom of Shirvan, the ruler of which took the title Shirvan Shah. Shirvan was conquered by the Arabs in the reign of the Calif Vathek (842-847). Subsequently it belonged to the Buyids {v.
su/pra, p. 108). At the time of the first Mongol invasion of Western Asia, Shirvan seems to have been ruled by an independent prince, Rashid Shirvan Shah. The country was ravaged by the Mongols in 1221 or 1222, and its capital Shemakha burnt. Rashid had fled and shut himself up in the citadel of Derbend (d'Ohsson, i. 336). In the Yuan shi (chap, cxx.), biography of Ho-sze-mai-li, Shi-rh-wan-sha is mentioned in connection with Subutai's and Chebe's expedition to the region of the Caucasus. Shirvan is still the name of a district in Transcaucasia, having for its capital Shemakha.
SA-LI-MANG = TAKU.T I SOLEIMAN (?).
The Si pei ti writes the name Sa-li-mang, whilst the map has Sa-li-shi. If the former be the correct reading, the name Soleiman may be intended. On modern maps we find a city Soleimania midway between Tabriz and Bagdad ; but this place is out of the question, being founded in 1788 (Eitter, " Asien," vi.J.
566). I am inclined to identify So-li-mang with Takht i Soleiman. The ruins of this city are considered by Sir H. Kawlinson to be identical with Ganzaka, the ancient
capital of Azerbaidjan (Ritter, L c. 1040 seq.). They are situated west of Zendjan, in the mountains where the river Chagatu, a southern affluent of the Urumia lake,



122 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
partly takes its rise. (On our ancient map Sa-li-marif; or Sa-li-shi is located north of Zendjan.) , Eashid reports that Hulagu died in 1265 on the river CliogatiL^ where he was accustomed to stay in winter (d'Ohsson, iii. 406). Hulagu's successor, Abaka, according to the same author, had his ordu on the same river (/. c. 455). Ritter states, on the authority of Rawlinson, it seems, that Abaka had a palace at Takhti Soleiman, the ruins of which are still to be seen.
J/^0-/S/-Lir= MOSUL.
Mosul, the celebrated city of Mesopotamia, situated on the Tigris, is first mentioned by the Arab chroniclers in connection with the first conquest of the Arabs (Ritter,
I.e. vii.&. 176).
When Hulagu invaded Western Asia, Mosul was a small principality ruled over by Bedr-eddin Lulu, who went in person to Meraga in 1258 to offer his submission to the Mongol prince (d'Ohsson, iii. 258). Thus Mosul at first escaped destruction by the Mongols, but after Bedr-eddin's death the inhabitants revolted. The Mongols besieged the city for nine months, and after its capture in 1262 utterly
destroyed it (/. c. 372). Mosul was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church in the Middle Ages (Yule's " Cathay," ccxliv.). M. Polo devotes a chapter of his book to the kingdom oi Mausid (\. 61). He states among other things: "All the cloths of gold and silk that are called Mosolins are made in this country." It would seem from this statement that mosolin or muslin had a very different meaning from what it has now. I may, however, observe that in the narrative of Cliang Ch*un's travels to the west in J 221, it is stated that in Samarkand the- men of the lower classes and the priests wrap their heads about with
a piece of white mo-sze (see i. 89). There can be no doubt that mo-sze here denotes " muslin," and the Chinese



0KB ARA—BAGDAD, 123
author seems to understand by tliis term tlie same material which we are now used to call muslin. Marignolli speaks of Monsol (probably a clerical error for Mousol) on the Tygris, a city built out of the ruins of Nynive ("Cathay," 351).
U-K'I-BA-LA = OKBARA.
U-k*i-ba-la, placed on the ancient map south-east of Mosul, is without doubt the city of Okhara mentioned by the early Arab geographers on the eastern bank of the Tigris above Bagdad, distant ten parasangs from the latter place (Istakhri, 54; Edrisi, ii. 146; Abulfeda, II. ii. 74,
75 ; Sprenger, I. c. map No. 9). Benjamin of Tudela (twelfth century) reached Bagdad
from Okbara in two days (Ritter, I. c. vii.a. 256). It does not seem that Okbara exists now-a-days.
BA-GHI-DA = BAGDAD.
This name has been omitted from the ancient map, but is found in the list of the Si pei ti. As is known, Bagdad was founded by Almansur, the second of the Abbaside Califs, a.d. 764, who before that time resided in Anhar}^ Originally a city was built on the western bank of the Tigris ; but, some years later, it was found more convenient to lay out one on the opposite bank ; and this then became the celebrated city oi Bagdad, where the Calif established his residence. The western city was afterwards considered only a suburb and called Karshi ^^^ (d'Ohssou, iii. 248). The capture of Bagdad by Hulagu in 1258 has been related in i. 119. Subsequently the Mongol khans of
8^* Yakut, quoted by Abulfeda, II. ii. 74, states that the first of the Abbaside Califs resided at Anhar, a city distant ten parasangs west from Bagdad, on the Euphrates river. ^^ This suburb still exists under about the same name on the western bank of the Tigris, opposite Bagdad. See Cernik, " Gebiete des Euphrat. und Tigris," Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," Erg.h. 44, p. 28 ; and map of Bagdad, where this suburb is termed Karshiaka.



124 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
Persia were accustomed to pass the winter in Bagdad (Ghazan, Oldjaitii; see d'Ohsson, iv. 172, ii. 535). PI. Carpini terms Bagdad Baldach (681, 709). The same spelling of tlie name occurs in Haithon's " Accounts of Asiatic Kingdoms," 147, where Baldach is stated to be the greatest city of the kingdom of Chaldaea. Bagdad in tlie Middle Ages was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church ('' Cathay," ccxliv.). M. Polo devote.? several chapters to the Great City of Baicdas (as he writes the name of Bagdad), the last Calif, and the end of his supremacy (i. 64 seq.). Tiie Chinese mediaeval traveller Chiang Te applies nearly the same name as M. Polo to Bagdad in styling it Bao-da. He also gives many details about the Calif and the capture of Bagdad by the Mongols (see i. 138). Ch*ang Te states, in accordance witli the Mohammedan authors, that ancient Bagdad (as now-a-days) consisted of an eastern and a western city, a large river running between them. The western city had no wall, whilst the eastern one was well
fortified. In the Yiian clvao pi shi the name of Bagdad appears repeatedly. It is spelt there Baklitat, and the Calif is termed Khaliho. In the unabbreviated text of this work a list is given of articles, animals, &c., sent from Bagdad to Ogotai khan. I proceed to give the names of these articles, and venture an identification of some of them. The Chinese translation of the Yiian ch*ao pi shi (made in the fourteenth century) furnishes some explanations of these names, which, for the greater part, seem to be Turkish, Persian, or Arabic words. I add a translation of the Chinese explanations in parenthesis :

Shiramala (1). Nakhut (a kind of gold brocate). Nachidut (a silk stuff interwoven with gold). Bardas {a stuff embroidered in gold). Suhut (pearls). Tanas (great pearls).



KUFAH. 125
Tobichaut (horses from 13ageJa with long legs and long necks). Gurin eleut (camels). Dao-u-si (?). Kichidut (camels). Khachidut (mules).
With respect to nalchut and nachidiU, T mny observe that tliese words represent the Mongol plural form of nakh and nachid; and the latter apparently represent tlie stuffs nacchi and nachelti spoken of by Pegolotti in liis notice of the trade at Constantinople (" Cathay," 306). The stuff nakh is named several times by Ibn Batuta, and explained by him as cloths of silk and gold. Eubruck tells us (317) that Mangu khan made him a present of nasic. M. Polo (i. 65) speaks of gold brocades, such as nasich and nac, woven in Baudas. I may finally mention
that in the Yuan shi, chap. Ixxviii. (on official dresses), a
stuff, na-shi-shi, is repeatedly named, and the term is explained there by kin kin (gold brocate). In the same chap, of the Ylian shi we also meet with the term su-hu-dit (evidently the same as suhut in the above list). It is explained as pearls. Sidmt even now is the Mongol name for pearl. In the same chapter we .find also the term fa-na^ explained by tung dm (Eastern pearl). Now-a-days tung chu is the name applied in Peking to the finest and largest kind of pearls ; but tana in modern Mongol means mother-of-pearl. As to the horses from Bagdad called tohichaut, they are also spoken of by the Chinese traveller Ch*ang Te, who applies to them the same name. See i. 140 ; see also note 381. Topchaq in the Turkish Chagatai dialect is a long-necked Turkman horse.
K'U-FA = KUFAII.
K'u-fa also is not marked on the ancient map, but this name appears in the list of the Si pei ti.
The city of Kufah was founded in 638, in the reign of



126 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
Calif Omar (Mas'udi, iv. 225). The Calif of Abul Abbas (750-754) established his residence there, but subsequently transferred it to Anhar. In the first period of Islam, Kufah was a much celebrated city and a centre of Moliammedan learning. Benjamin of Tudela visited Kufah in the twelfth century (Eitter, l. c. vii.a. 266). According to the authors quoted by Abulfeda (II. ii. 73), Kufah was situated on a branch of the Euphrates. Cernik, I. c, on his map places Kufah indeed on a western branch of that river, which- runs through the lake Bahri Nedshef, in lat. 32°. The Mohammedan historians record the capture of Kufah by the Mongols in 1258 (d'Ohsson, iii. 255).
WA-SI-DI=YA^IT,
This name, coupled in the Si pei ti with Kufah, is not found on the ancient map, but evidently Vasit is meant, founded, according to Yakut, in a.d. 703, between Kufah and Basrah (Abulfeda, II. ii. 80). As it was situated not only midway between Kufah and Basrah, but also between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, it received the above name, meaning " the middle " in Arabic (d'Herbelot, " Bibl.
Or."). It seems that Vasit still exists, for it is marked on Cernik's map.
K'1-LI-MANG-SHA-HANG = KIRMANSHAHAN.
Kirmanshahan, or, as it is now-a-days generally called, Kirmanshah, a city of Western Persia, was founded, according to Mirkhond, by the Sassanian king Bahram (Varanes, iv. 388-399), who, on account of his having been governor of Kirman in the lifetime of his father Shapur (Sapor II.), had the surname Kirman Shah. The new city became the residence of Bahram. Nushirvan (539-72) and Khosru Parvez (590-628) also held their courts in Kirmanshah (Eitter, " Asien," vi.&. 374). But according to another author quoted by Yakut (Barbier de M., 438), Kirmanshahan was founded by Kobad (491-531).



NANA VAND—LURISTAN—SHULISTAN. 127
Yakut informs us also that tlie Arabic name of the city is Karmisin. Eashid mentions Kerniansliahan only once (d'Ohsson, iv. 3 1 3).
NA-KA-WAN-DI^^KUKYk^D.
Ndhavand is placed on Cernik's map south of Hamadan and east of Kirmanshah. It is an ancient city. Some Mohammedan geographers assert that it was founded by Noah, whence the name (Abulfeda, II. ii. 165). This place is of historic celebrity ; for it was at Nahavand that, in 642, the famous battle was fought in which the army of Yezdejerd III., the last king of the Sassanian dynasty, was defeated by the Arabs.
Z0-i2H= LOR OR LURISTAN.
Lor, LuVy or Luristan is still the name of the mountainous country between Kuzistan and Irak Adjem. When the Mongols invaded Western Asia, Lur was divided into two principalities, known as Great and Little Ltcr, ruled by Atabegs (d'Ohsson, iii. 261, i v. 171). This
distinction still exists. M. Polo, i. 84, terms one of his kingdoms of Persia Lor.
SHE~LA-TSZ' = SHULISTAN.
The position assigned to She-la-tsz' on the ancient map, between Shiraz and Kazerun, seems to point to Shulistan. The latter name is applied to the SMds, a people who long occupied a part of Luristan, but were expelled by the Lurs in the twelfth century, and then settled in the country between Shiraz and Kuzistan, west of Shiraz. Rashid mentions the Shuls once, in stating that in 1262 Salih, prince of Mosul, besieged by the Mongols, distributed money to the Turkmans, Kurds, and Shuls who were in Mosul (d'Ohsson, iii. 372). The Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) speaks of the Shuls. See Quatremere, "Hist, des Mongols," 381-384.



128 CHINESE MEDIEVAL MAP.
M. Polo, i. 84, names Suolstan or Cielstan (Shelstan) as one of the eight kingdoms of Persia. Ibn Batuta, going from Shiraz to Kazerun, encamped the first day in the country of the Skids.
S1E-LA-SI1I= SHIRAZ.
The history of Shiraz. the capital of Fars or Persia proper, does not begin earlier, it seems, than Islam, for the ancient capital of Ears was Istalchr (Persepolis). Ibn Haukal, quoted by Abulfeda, II. -ii. 97, calls Shiraz a new city founded by the Mussulmans. I may, however, observe that the name of Shiraz is met with in the early history of Persia (Shahnameh, iv. 191). At the time of the rise of the Mongol power, the dynasty of the Salghar Atabegs, who were descended from Salghar, a governor of Fars, reigned in Fars. Salghar's grandson, Sankor, had profited by the weakness of the Seldjuks, and in 1 148 made himself independent. His successors reigned with the title of Ataheg in Favs ; their residence was in Shiraz. When the Mongols for the first time ravaged Western Asia, they did not reach Shiraz; and Atabeg Abubekr (1231-60), who was anxious to be on good terms with the Great Khan, sent his brother with rich presents to Ogotai khan, and received the title Kutlug khan (d'Ohsson, ii. 92). When Hulagu passed the Djihun in 1256, Abubekr sent his nephew to compliment the Mongol prince {ibid. iii. 140). Thus Shiraz was spared by the Mongols until 1262, when Hulagu sent troops to this city to punish Abubekr's successor, Seldjuk Shah, who was guilty of several acts of violence. After a stout resistance the latter was made prisoner in Kazerun and executed. From that time a Salgharian princess, married to a son of Hulagu, had the mere title of Atabeg of Fars
;
for this province was under Mongol administration (ibid,
400 seq.).
M. Polo, i. 84, speaks of the Persian kingdom of Serazy. In the narrative of travel of Chang Te, and in the



KAZERUN—KISH. 129
biography of Kuo iCan, Shiraz is termed Shi-lo-tsz, and the title of Atabeg of the princes of Fars is rendered
there by a-fa-bei (see i. 145, 146).
KO-DSA-LUiyG=KAZE\Wi:i.
Kazerun is still the name of a city in Fars, west of Shiraz. This name occurs in the early history of Persia (Barbier de M., 472). In the history of the Mongol khans in Persia. Kazerun is twice mentioned. In 1264 Seldjuk Shah of Fars was made prisoner by the Mongols in Kazerun and executed there (d'Ohsson, iii. 401). Ibid. iv. 207, it is reported that Kutlug Khodja, a Mongol prince of the Chagatai branch, ravaged Fars in 1300, .lud proceeded through Shiraz and Kazerun to Kuzistan and Guermsir.
Kish, Kis, or Kais is an island in the Persian Gulf, on which for a long time one of the chief ports of trade with India and the East was situated. Kish is not mentioned by the early Arab geographers, for in the ninth and the first half of the tenth century Sii^af was the headquarters of Indian and Chinese trade in the Persian Gulf. Kazvini (fourteenth century) and Hafiz Abru (fifteenth century) attribute the decline of Siraf to the rise of Kish as a seaport since the second half of the tenth century (Ouseley's " Travels in Southern Persia," quoted in Ritter,
"Asien," vi.a. 774-775). M. Polo (i. 64, 85 ; ii. 324, 357) mentions this port repeatedly, but he seems to speak without personal knowledge ; for according to him, Xisi or Kis is a city on the shore of the Indian Sea, situated where the merchants coming from Baudas enter that sea. Ibn Batuta, ii. 243, mentions the city of Kais, called also Siraf. But he also is mistaken. None of the other Persian or Arab mediaeval geographers identifies Siraf with Kais or Kish. Yakut as K

well as Abulfeda notice Kish (called Kis in Arabic) as an island and seaport between Fars and Oman, and speak separately of Sii-af, a city and port of Fars (Barbier, L c.
499. 331 ; Abulfeda, 11. ii. 129, 96). Kish or Kais, Kis, is not to be confounded with the lai'ge island of Kishm, near the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Kish, or, as it is named on our maps, Geise or Kena, is a small island about 100 miles farther up west. It is wooded and well supplied with fresh water. The ruins of a city exist on the north side (Yule's " M. Polo," i. 66, note). According to Ouseley, quoted in Eitter, Siraf lay opposite this island, on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf.
BA-HA-LA-YIN^ BAHAKAIN.
Ba-ha-la-yin is the most southern place or country in Abu Said's empire or Persia marked on our ancient map. There can be no doubt that by Baharain is meant in ancient times the name of a province in Eastern Arabia, stretching along the w^estern shore of the Persian Gulf, and the same as El Hasa on modern maps (Istakhri, 9; Abulfeda, ii. 137). According to Ibn Batuta (ii. 2^^), Bahrein was the name of a city, on the mainland it seems, between which iind Siraf was a gulf with calm water famed for pearlfishing. Now-a-days the name Bahrein is applied to a great island situated in the bay of the same name near the western shore of the Persian Gulf. Tlie bay of Baharein is still well known for its pearl-oyster beds (Colonel D. Wilson, " Pearl-Fislieries in the Persian Gulf," J. K. Geogr. Soc, iii. 1834, 283-286; Brenner's " Eeport on PearlFishing in the Bay of Baharein," Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," 1873, 37). Compare also a Chinese mediaeval account of pearl-fishing in the Persian Gulf in vol. i. 145, 146.
HU-LI-MU-TSZ' = HORMUZ.
This name is found only in the list of the Si pei ti, not on the ancient map. No doubt by Hormuz is meant the



HORMUZ. 131
celebrated emporium at tlie entrance of the Persian Gulf. The name of this place seems to be of very ancient ori^rin, for Arrian tells us that Nearchus, the admiral of Alexander the Great, when returning from India, beached his fleet on the shore of Harmozeia. A place Armuza appears in Ptolemy. But it was only in the tenth or eleventh century that Hormuz acquired its importance as a seaport of Indian trade. It had been preceded by Kish as the principal port in the Persian Gulf (eleventh to thirteenth century) ; and, as we have seen, before Kish, in the ninth and tenth century >S'ira/ occupied the most prominent place among the Persian seaports. The port of Hormuz, which before the Mongol period belonged to the Salgliar Atabegs of Fars, originally stood upon the mainland. M. Polo, who visited this place twice, terming it generally Hormos (once also Curmosa), states expressly that it was a seaport upon the mainland (i. no). The great traveller, when leaving China in 1292, returned by the sea-route. He was entrusted with the important mission of accompanying a Mongol princess from China to the court of the, Persian khan, and they landed at Hormuz (ii. 450). The Ormes visited by OJoric in about 1320 was on an island some five miles distant from the mainland ("Cathay," 56). A few years later Ibn Batuta saw this place. He speaks (ii. 230) of the city of Hormus, situated on the seashore, whence he proceeded to New Hormuz or Djeraun, situated on an island opposite the old city.
Abulfeda, II. ii. 104, relates : " Hormuz is the port of Kerman, a city rich in palms and very hot. One who has visited it in our day tells me that the ancient Hormuz was devastated by the incursions of the Tartars, and that its people trans feired their abode to an island in the sea
•called Zarun." When the Portuguese made their first appearance in the Persian Gulf, in the beginning of the sixteenth century,



132 CHINESE MEDIMVAL MAP.
Hormuz ^^ was a rich entrepot of Indian trade. It was taken in 1509 by Albuquerque, and in tlie sixteenth century flourished as one of the richest ports of the East. But in 1622 the Portuguese were expelled from the island by the united English and Persian forces. Shah Abbas destroyed the city of Hormuz and built another seaport on the opposite shore of the Persian Gulf, which was named Bender Ahhasi. We learn from M. Polo that in the time of Kubilai khan Chinese vessels visited Hormuz. The Ylian shi mentions several seaports of the Indian Ocean as carrying on trade with China ; Hormuz is not spoken of there. I may, however, quote from the Ylian History a curious statement which perhaps refers to this port. In chap, cxxiii., biography otArsz-lan, it is recorded that his grandson Hurdutai, by order of Kubilai khan, accompanied Bu-lo no-yen on his mission to the country of E^a-rh-ma-sz (see note 850). This latter name may be intended for Hormuz. I do not think that by the Noyen Bulo M. Polo could be meant, for the title noyen would hardly have been applied to him. But Eashid-eddin mentions a distinguished Mongol, by name Fulad, with whom he was acquainted in Persia, and who furnished him much information regarding the history of the Mongols. This may be the Bu-lo no-yen of the Hiian History. I finally proceed to translate some details regarding Hormuz in the fifteenth century, found in the History of the Ming dynasty, chap, cccxxvi. This account reads as follows :

Ru-lu-mu-sz* is a great kingdom ,^^7 situated on the Western Sea north-west of Ku-li (probably Kalikut), from which place it can be reached in twenty-five days. In
^^ De Barros, in his " Asia," middle of the sixteenth century (German translation by Soltau, 1821, ii. 31), states that Ormuz is situated on a small island called Djerwig, three miles distant from the Persian coast.

Subsequently he sent an envoy, by name I-dsi-ding, to the Chinese court. He brought a letter written on gold paper and presented horses and products of his country as tribute. After this tlie embassies from Hu-lu-mu-sze were four times repeated, and Cheng Ho was sent thither for a second time in 1430. The kingdom was then ruled by Sai-fu-diTig.^^ Three years later an embassy sent by this prince reached Peking and presented tribute, which was courteously received by the emperor. The country of Hu-lu-mu-sz' is situated on the utmost border of the Western Sea. The trading vessels of the southern barbarians come thither, and the nations of the Great Western Sea, as well as the merchants of the Si yu (Western Asia) meet there for commercial purposes

Ibn Batuta, ii. 231, says that there are hills consisting of a kind of salt, called darani, of which the people make vases. Barbosa (Stanley's traiisl. 41) reports : "Outside of the city of Ormuz, in the island itself, there is a small mountain, which is entirely of rock-salt and sulphur : this salt is in great lumps, and very white and good ; they call it Indian salt, and the ships which come there from all parts take this salt," &c. Corsali ("Ramusio," i. 187), states thafc the rock-salt found in the hills near Ormuz is of a reddish colour. 87^ Compare the reports of Figueroa (16 17) and Kinneir (1813), quoted by Ritter, "Arabien," i. 437, 441, about the various colours of the rocks in the island of Ormuz.

^/-SZ'-i>.4-iV/ = K0NSTANTINAH OR CONSTANTINOPLE.
Konstantinah was the name by which the Persians, Arabs, and Turks used to designate Constantinople (Istakhri, 43 ; Abulfeda, ii. 315). The Mongol khans in Persia were generally on good terms with the Byzantine emperors, and several marriages of Byzantine princesses with Mongol khans are recorded by the Byzantine chroniclers. Hulagu demanded in marriage a daughter of Michael Palaeologus, named Mary, who was sent in compliance with this demand ; but when she arrived in Persia, Hulagu was dead, and she was married to his son and successor, Abaka khan. This princess is mentioned by Eashid under the name of Tespina (d'Ohsson, iii. 418). This is evidently the Greek Aecnroiva, princess. Andronicus the Elder is said to have fjiven his natural daughter to Ghazan, khan of Persia, and a few years later
his sister Mary to Oldjaitu khan {I. c. iv. 315, 318). Other Byzantine princesses were married to the khans of Kipchak.
MI-SZ'.RH=U1SR OR EGYPT.
Mizraim is the name by which Egypt is designated in the Bible. The Arabic Misr is evidently derived from this appellation. It properly means the capital of Egypt
(Istakhri, 18, 28, 146; Abulfeda, ii. 139). When speaking of the country, the Arab geographers use the terms Dyar-Misr or Bilad-Misr (provinces of Misr). In the Yiian shi, the name of Mi-si-rh or Egypt occurs

DLMI-SHI.GHI=J)IUA.^11K, DAMASCUS.
The history of Damascus can be traced back to the narratives of Holy Scripture, where this city, the capital of one of the kingdoms of Syria, is often mentioned. Dimashk is frequently noticed in the Persian annals in connection with the wars of the Mongol khans of Persia with the sultans of Egypt in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In a letter addressed by Arghun, khan of Persia, to King Philip of France, written in Mongol in 1289, and preserved in the French archives, Damascus is termed Dimiski (Pauthier's "M. Polo," 776). In the " M^moires cone, les Chinois," xiv. 246, Father Amiot has translated from the Chinese a petition addressed to one of the Ming emperors by a Mohammedan, Ho-che han tung, from Di-mishi, soliciting permission to travel in China. From the accompanying original petition in Persian, it appeared, as E6nusat states, that by Di-mi-shi Damascus was meant.
DAN-YA='DAMIAT OR DAMIETTA(?).
Although the position assigned to Dan-ya on the ancient map (north of Constantinople) does not suit Damietta, I nevertheless suppose that this city, situated on the eastern mouth of the Nile, was meant. At least there was no country or city north of Constantinople bearing a similar name. Damiat played an important part in the crusades. The Mongol armies never advanced as far as Damietta, but of course the name was well known to them. The Catalan map writes the name DamycU.

PEELIMINARY NOTICES.
The power of the great Mongol Empire in Eastern Asia (Mongolia, China, &c.) established by Kubilai Khan, who in 1260 had moved the seat of government to China, subsisted no longer than while it \vas sustained by the firm and dexterous hand of this illustrious monarch. Not very long after his death (in 1294) the mighty empire began to decline under the rule of his incapable and debauched successors, and at length the weakness of the Great Khans gave free scope to the rise and progress of a new Chinese dynasty. Chu Yiian chang, sl humble Chinese plebeian, became about 1353 the leader of a vast host of insurgents, and, owing to his commanding ability, finally succeeded in overthrowing the Mongol dynasty in China. Having expelled the Mongols from Northern China in 1368, he proclaimed himself Emperor,' taking the title Hung wii. He was the celebrated founder of the Ming dynasty. The Mongols, confined to their original seats, the steppes of Mongolia, continued to rule there as troublesome northern neighbours of the new Chinese empire. A western branch of the Mongols, known under the names of Oirat or KalmuTcs, occupied in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the land north of the eastern T'ien shan mountains, or Eastern Dsungaria. Subsequently we find also tribes of them living in the southern part of Western Mongolia and in Kukunor. Eastern and Western Turkestan, as also the western part of the tracts which we call Dsungaria, continued in the Ming period to constitute the dominions of the descendants of Chagatai, the second son of Chinghiz. This

was the so-called Middle Empire, and included originally Transoxiana. But in the first half of the fourteenth century the Middle Empire came to be divided, and Maverannahr or Transoxiana was then ruled by separate khans of the same house of Chagatai. About fifty years later, in 1370, the great conqueror Timur, who likewise traced his descent from the royal stock of Chinghiz, ascended the throne of Chagatai in Sajnarkand, and laid the foundation of a new dynasty. At his death in 1405 he left to his successors the greatest empire the world ever saw. The eastern part of the Middle Empire (Eastern and Western Turkestan and Western Dsungaria), called Moghulisian, or the country of the Jetes^ by the Mohammedan historians of Timur and his successors, continued to remain under the rule of sovereigns of Chagatai's lineage, and survived the numerous attacks and devastations by the conqueror's armies. Only a century after Timur's death the last Khan of Moghulistan is reported to have been put to death by Sheibani, the founder of the Uzbeg power in Central Asia, and who a few years earlier had driven out the Timurids from Transoxiana. The succession of Khans of Moghulistan was, however, carried on for many years afterwards by one branch of the house of Djagatai in Turfan and the farthest East. Besides this, another Moghul khanship had risen, end of the fourteenth century, in Kashgar^ and seems to have still subsisted in the middle of the sixteenth century. The empire of the Mijngol dynasty of the IlkJians, founded in 1259 by Hulagu, brother of the Great Khan Kubilai, and comprising Persia, Irak Arabi, Mesopotamia, Armenia, became dismembered before a century had elapsed. Abu Said, a descendant of Hulagu in the fourth degree, 1317-35, was the last of the Ilkhans who exercised absolute authority in the empire. Five Ilkhans reigned after him ; and during their short reigns the empire broke into fragments, and the single provinces became independent. Finally, Timur subjugated all Western Asia,



15 & i6cENT.] PRELIMINARY NOTICES. 141
and reduced the petty rulers of Khomssan, Mnzanderau, Fars, &c., to obedience. Sultan Ahmed Jelair, whose father, likewise a descendant of Hulngu, liad founded, after Abu Said's death, a new dynasty in Bagdad, and who had taken also possession of Azerbeidjan, passed the latter part of his life, from the year 1384, in an ineffectual struggle with Timur and his successors, and at length, in 14 10, was taken prisoner and put to death by Kara Yusuf, the valiant Turkoman chief and ruler of Kurdistan. North of the Middle Empire, and also north of the empire of the Ilkhans, was the Desht Kipchak, the dominions assigned by Chinghiz khan to his eldest son, Djuchi. Desht Kipchak occupied the vast steppe lands stretching east and north of Lake Aral, a part of modern Siberia, the land north of the Caspian Sea, and on both sides of the Lower Volga, and, after Eatu's conquest, covered also a large part of Southern Eussia. This vast empire was from the beginning, i.e., after Djuchi's death in 1225, divided into two main sections. The one subject to Djuchi's eldest son, O^^da, dominated in the East, and was known under the name of the White Horde, whilst the western part of the Khanate, the Golden Horde, was ruled over by Orda's brother, Batu, the conqueror of Eussia, who since about 1254 had his residence in Sarai, on the Lower Volga. In the second half of the thirteenth century another branch of Djuchi's lineage acquired authority in the Crimea, and subsequently founded there a powerful Khanate, which subsisted down to the end of the last century. The rival families of the White Horde and the Crimean branch kept up a struggle for the throne of Sarai for a long time. Princes of both houses ruled there alternately according to the chance of their arms. Timur during the whole of his reign was almost constantly at feud with Toktamish, who then ruled over Desht Kipchak, and belonged to the Crimean branch. In 1502 Mengli Girai, the sovereign of the Crimean Horde, dispersed the Golden Horde of Sarai, and thus delivered Eussia from the Mongol yoke. The

Xliaiiate of Kazan, which had been founded in 1439 on tiie relics of the Bolgarian Empire by the Mongol prince
Ulugh ^fohanimed, was, after a long struggle, definitively crushed by tlie Eussian arms in 1552. There was yet another branch of the house of Djuchi in Central Asia, wliich became famous in the fifteenth century under the name of Uzbegs. They formed the special heritage of Sheiban, the fifth son of Djuchi. His original dominions seem to have been contiguous to those of the White Horde. The real founder of the power of the Uzbegs was Ahulkhair, a descendant of Sheiban in the sixth degree. He was born in 141 3, and expelled the White Horde from their original seats. The latter then were received by the Khan of Moghulistan, who gave to tlie Khans of the White Horde some territories on the western limits of Moghulistan, on the river Chu. The people of the White Horde there were subsequently named Kasaks. Abulkhair conquered Khovarezm, and extended his dominions also over Turkestan. His son Sheibani in the beginning of the sixteenth century made himself master of Samarkand and Transoxiana, and some years later succeeded in driving the Timurids out also of Khorassan. The important states founded by the Uzbei^'S in that period in Transoxiana and Khovarezm subsisted down to the occupation of these tracts by the Eussians, and partly still exist there.

farthest extremities of the world known to them. Hiuir/ vm, the first Ming emperor (1368-99) was particularly anxious to be on good terms with Timur or TamerIan, whose rising power at that time began to alarm the sovereigns of Asia. The Chinese annals record several embassies sent by Hung wu to Timur, who did not fail to send in return his envoys with presents to Hung wu. But finally Timur determined to make war on China. As is known, the great conqueror died at Otrar in February 1405, just when he was about to move out on the expedition against the emperor of China. In the same Chinese annals Timur's son. Shah Rok, ruler of Herat, is "Stated to have repeatedly despatched embassies to the Chinese court in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. The Chinese envoys who went to Samarkand and Herat in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries visited also a number of other places and countries on their way thither and beyond, and it seems that from the reports of these Chinese envoys the accounts found in the history of the Ming with respect to the countries in the West have been compiled.
vast fleet and a large force. On his expeditions, several times repeated in the space of about thirty years (see his biography, Ming shi, chap, ccciv.), he visited a number of kingdoms situated on the Indian Ocean up to the Persian and Arabian Gulfs and the eastern coast of Africa, and obtained the nominal allegiance of their rulers. The Chinese accounts of these countries, gathered during the expeditions of Cheng Ho, have been in part translated and annotated by several distinguished sinologues.

144 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
In the Ye hu pien, a collection of miscellaneous memoirs,^^ published in 1606, chap, ix., we read as follows:

The Si yu sheng Ian shi (poems written on the curious things seen on a travel to the West) was composed by An.^^ The author's friend, who published the book, states in the preface that An had the cognomen Chi tao, and that he was one of the most remarkable men of Northern China. In the year 1395 he wa^ sent by the emperor Hung wu to Sa-ma-rh'han (Samarkand). He accompanied the envoy of the ruler of that country (Timur), who returned from China home. They proceeded from Kia yu knan ^®^ 800 li, crossed the Liusha (moving sands) ,®^^ and after travelling 2CXX) li arrived at Ha-mi-li (Kamul, Hami). After this they went through the Han hai ®^^ 1 300 li to ancient Kao cKang.^^^ Farther westward they reached I4a-ba-li (Ilibalik). Hence all rivers flow to the west. Farther on 3000 li, Sa-ma-rh~han (Samarkand) was reached. The ruler of that country and his ministers boasted of the great extent of their dominions, and sent the Chinese envoy to visit the most remarkable places of the empire. An officer was appointed to accompany him. Travelling westward, they reached T*ao-lo-sz (Tauris or Tabriz).
^8^ See W. Schott, " Verzeichniss der Chines., &c., Biicher wnd Handschr. der Bibliothek zu Berlin," 1840, p. 77. ^^' In the Ming shi this envoy An is frequently mentioned. ^'^ This is still the name of a fortress near the termination of the Great Wall, in the Chinese province of Kan su. For nearly 2000 years Kia yii kuan, or rather Yii men kuan, which lies farther north-west, were the starting-points for Chinese travellers and military expeditions proceeding to Central and Western Asia. See also note 937. ^^ This is the Chinese name applied since the remotest time of Chinese history to the sandy desert stretching west and north-west of Kia yii kuan.

I must observe that the figures in the Chinese itinerary show considerable (evidently clerical) errors. As we shall see farther on, the Ming shi estimates the distance between Kia yii kuan and Kamul at 1600 li, and between Hami and Turfan at more than 1000 li.

After this they visited I-sz -hu-lian (Ispahan), and then proceeded southward to Shi-la-sz (Shiraz). On their way back they passed by Hci-lu (Herat) and other cities. They had travelled over more than 10 000 li, and when they returned to Samarkand they had been absent six years. As An Chi tao was not disposed to agree with the propositions of the ruler of Samarkand, he was retained by force. It was only after his (Timur's) death (February 1405) that An Chi tao was allowed to return home. According to the Ming shi, this Chinese envoy returned home in 1407, after twelve years' absence. Subsequently An Chi tao was again entrusted with missions to the western countries. There are two records of European travellers corroborating in some way the above Chinese statements. Clavijo, the well-known Castilian ambassador, who sojourned at the court of Timur from September 8 to November 21, 1404,
states (see Markham's transl. 133 seq.) :" The Emperor Chuyscan, Lord of Cathay, had sent to Timur Beg to demand the yearly tribute which was formerly paid. When Timur (on an audience he gave tlie foreign ambassadors) saw the ambassadors (Clavijo, &c.) seated below the Catbayan ambassador, he sent to order that they should sit above him ; those who came from the king of Spain, his son and friend, were not to sit below the envoy of a thief and scoundrel who was Timur's enemy. This emperor of Cathay is called Chuyscan, which means * nine empires/ but the Zagatays called him Tangus, which means ' pig emperor.* '^^ He
is the lord of a great country, and Timur Beg used to pay him tribute, but he refuses to do so now. . . ." On p. 173 Clavijo speaks again of the same Chinese embassy: "When the Lord (Timur) had returned to Samarkand after an absence of seven years (war in Western Asia), the ambassadors from Cathay arrived, with orders to say that the Lord held that land subject
^' Tangus means " pig " in Turkish. See also note 1063.

to the ein})eror of Cathay, and to demand the payment of tribute every year, as it was seven years since any had been paid. The Lord answered that it was true, but that he would not pay it. This tribute had not been paid for nearly eight years, nor had the emperor of Cathay sent for it, and the reason why he did not send for it was that this emperor died."^^® After this Clavijo gives a somewhat confused and incorrect account of the strufjcjle which ensued between the sous of the feniperor, and then continues : " As soon as the middle brother (second son of Hung wu ^^) reigned alone and was quietly established in his own empire, he sent these ambassadors to Timur Beg, to demand the tribute which was formerly paid to his father. But we did not hear whether he resented the answer given by Timur. . . . Camhalu, the chief city of Cathay, is six months from Samarkand, two of which are passed in crossing an uninhabited land, never visited by any one but shepherds, who wander with their flocks in search of pasture. In this year (1404) as many as 800 camels, laden with merchandise, came from Cambalu to Samarkand in the month of June. When Timur heard what the ambassadors from Cathay had demanded, he ordered these camels to be detained, and we saw the men who came with the camels." J. Shildherger, a Bavarian, who seems to have been at Samarkand at the same time with Clavijo, states with reference to the same Chinese embassy (edit. Neumann, p. 3i): "Now at this time, when Thamerlin had returned after twelve years' absence, had the Great Khan, the Xing of Chetey, sent an envoy to Thamerlin with 400 horses, and demanded the tribute which he had neglected to pay for five years past. So Thamerlin took the envoy with him to Semerchent. Then sent he the envoy away, and bid him tell his master he would be no tributary nor

And so, when he had gathered i,800;000 men, he marched for a whole month, and then came to a desert seventy days' journey long. Many people and horses died from want of water. It was also exceedingly cold. Therefore Thamerlin returned to his capital, where he was taken ill and died."
Another Chinese embassy to the west, about ten years later, is recorded in the Ming History, chap, cccxxxii. fol. 9, in the following terms :

In the year 141 5 Ch'en CJteng returned home from the Si yil (Western countries). He had visited the following
seventeen kingdoms or places : ^^^

This is an Sha-lu-hai-ya (Shahrokliia). ancient name for Lopnor.
Ch'en Ch*eng had procured information regarding the mountains, rivers, products, customs, &c., of these countries. He published these accounts in a book which he entitled Shi Si yil hi, Eecord of an embassy to the countries in the West.s»i

There were two other Chinese envoys sent to Western Asia, whose names occur frequently in the Ming shi, viz., Zi Ta and Li Kui. The first was sent thither in the firsD quarter of the fifteenth century, the second about 1432. The name of Li Ta appears in one of the letters addressed by the Chinese emperor to Shah Eok in about 141 7, which letter had been translated into Persian by Abd-er-razzak, and of which W. Chambers has given an English version in the " Asiatic Miscellany," i. 1785 (see farther on).
The principal Chinese source of information with respect to the countries of Asia and their political intercourse with the Middle Kingdom in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is the Ming shi or History of the Ming Dynasty, which reigned 1368- 1644. At the end o£ this bulky work we find twelve chapters, 320-332, devoted to foreign countries which had intercourse with China in that period. Accounts of foreign countries are also given in the ToMing I tung chi, the great Geography of the Ming Empire, The edition to which I always refer bears the date of a.d. 1 46 1. In the chaps. Ixxxix. and xc. some interesting geographical details on the countries of Asia known to the Chinese in that period are found. The compilators of the Ming shi and of the Ming Geography had evidently different sources of information. However, the statements in both works are not in contradiction with, but rather complete, each other. I shall generally confine myself for my

investigations to tlie JMing shi and the Ming Geography, although there are besides these works many other Chinese books published in the Ming period, and treating of foreign countries. The Kuang yii hi, an abbreviated geography of the Ming empire, published about the commencement of the seventeenth century, has also two sections on border-lands and foreigners. ^^^
I may mention also the Tsien k*io lei shu, published in 1632. The nth and 14th chapters treat of the bordering countries and foreign nations.
In the "Memoires cone, les Chinois," vol. xiv., 1789, p. 238-308, Father Amiot translated a collection of credentials from a number of Asiatic sovereigns who had sent their envoys to the Chinese court, and also supplications from these envoys. Amiot had forwarded to Paris the Chinese texts from which he translated, together with a
copy of the original letters, written in different Asiatic languages. Remusat, in his " Mel. Asiat," ii. 249, comments upon these documents. He was mistaken with respect to their origin, stating that these letters had been addressed to the Emperor Kang hi of the present dynasty. Amiot himself does not appear to have known to what period these documents belonged ; but even a superficial perusal of the latter leaves no doubt that all these letters had been written in the fifteenth century, and were addressed to the Ming emperors. They are preserved in the Sz yi kuan, a book published in the fifteenth century in
the linguistic office at Peking, established in 1407 for diplomatic purposes.
^*' A new edition of thig work was published in 1803. It professes to be enlarged and revised, but as to the political division of the empire, and the names of the provinces and cities, nothing has been changed. Thus E. Biot, in his " Dictionnaire des Villes et Arrondissements dans I'Empire Chinois," 1842, which he compiled from the Kuang yli ki, was mistaken in assuming that he translated a Chinese geography of the present dynasty.



ISO CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
Ill order to turn to advantage the light opened up by the Cliinese annahsts and geographers of the Ming period with respect to the history and geography of Central and Western Asia, we shall have to compare these generally scanty accounts with the statements of Western historians
and travellers on the same subject. Valuable matter in illustration of the history of Central Asia, and especially of the Khans of Moghulistan (Jetes;, is found in W. Erskine's *•' History, of India under Baber andHumayun," 1854, i. 35-68, 537-540. Erskine translates chiefly from the TarikJd Bashidi, written about 1544 by Haider Mirza Doglat, who was himself descended from the princes of Moghulistan. Erskine gives the whole history of the Djagatai dynasty (Middle Empire) in Moghulistan and Kashgar down to the middle of the sixteenth century. The History of the Khans of the Middle Empire in Transoxiana, down to the accession of Timur to the throne at Samarkand, has been translated by Defremery from the Habib essiyer of Khondemir (-}- 1535), in the "Journal Asiatique," 4* serie, xix. xx., 1852. The History of the Great Timur and his conquests was written by Maulana Sherif-eddin AH of Yezd. This work, which he called Zafer nameh, or the " Book of Victory," was completed in 1424. It is, as the author states in the preface, founded upon the records of passing events written down by the Uigur scribes, who always accompanied Timur. The Zafer nameh is well known in Europe by the very fair and accurate translation of F^tis de la Croix (+ 17 13). His Histoire de Timoior Bee vas published by his son in 1722, in 4 vols. This translation is accompanied with five detailed maps, bub we are without explanation by the author as to the sources of his information. The maps referring to Transoxiana and Moghulistan are utterly incorrect, and leave no doubt that he was chiefly drawing on his imagination. The French version of the Zafer nameh was translated into English by J. Darby in

1723, in 2 vols. This history of Timur is, besides its great historical importance, a rich mine of information with respect to the mediaeval geography of Asia. There is a Persian MS. of the seventeenth century by Abu Talib Husseini, professing to be a Persian translation of Timur's Autobiographical Memoirs {Mcdfuzat-i Timuri), in which Timur had recorded the events of his life in the Djagatai Turki language. In 1830 Major Ch. Stewart translated a part of this Persian text, which in his copy concluded with the year 1375. The British Museum now possesses a complete copy of the MS., extending to the year of Timur's death, ^his belonged to the Royal Library
at Lucknow. Elliot, in his "History of India," 187 1, iii. 394 seq., translated from it the chapter referring to Timur's exfjedition to India. Mr. Ch. Rieu, in his "Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts," i. 177, 178, considers the authenticity of these Memoirs of Timur to be open to serious objections. There is another history of Timur, written by Ahmed Ihn Mohammed, with the surname Arab Shah, a native of Damascus, where he died in 1450. He was the preceptor of the Othoman Sultan Murad II. This book, which he wrote in Arabic, bears the title Ajaib al Mukhlukat, or " Wonders of the Creation."- It has been edited in the Arabic text by Golius in 1636, translated into French by P. Vattier in 1658, and into Latin by Manger in 1767. Arab Shah's history of the great conqueror has no claimsto be considered a work of historical value, being more a coarse satire on that prince than his history. It containsan interesting description of the Desht Kipchak. See
Manger's transl., vol. i. chap. xlv. Abd-er-razzak, 1413-83, wrote the history of Timur's son, Shah Rok, and of his great-grandson, Abu .Said. Quatremere in 1843 undertook to translate this work, the Matla-assaadein, &c., into French, but his translation, publislied in the " Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits, (Sec.,'" XIV. i., gives only a part of the life of Shah Eok, and concludes with the year 142 1.



152 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
A complete history of the Timurids, down to the overthrow of this dynasty in Transoxiana and Khorassan bv the Uzbegs in the beginning of the sixteenth century, is given in the Rauzat-us-Safa and in the KTiulasat-ul-Akhbar, the works of the great historians MirkhoTid (-}- 1498) and his grandson Khondemir (-f ^535)- These records have been translated by Major D. Price in his valuable work *' Chronological Eetroepect of Mohammedan History," voL
iii., 1821. One of the descendants of Timur, the fanioas Sultan Baber, after being driven out from his patrimony, Ferghana, by the Uzbegs, and after several fruitless attempts to establish his power in Transoxiana, succeeded in conquering Kabul, and in about 1520 made himself master of Northern India, where he became the founder of the mighty Moghul dynasty, which up to the beginning of the nineteenth century held imperial sway in India. Baber died in 1530 ; his Memoirs, the Baber na^meh, written in the Djagatai Turki language, have come down to us in this original composition and in a Persian translation. They are remarkable for the ability and the judgment with which they were written. The author supplies a mass of most valuable information regarding the political events of his time, in which he had taken so large a share. Besides this, his records deserve special attention on account of the interesting geograpiiical details they contain referring to Fei^hana, Transoxiana, Khorassan, Kabul, and Northern India. The Baber nameh was translated into Englisii from the Persian version by J. Leyden and W. Erskine in 1826. A French translation from the original Turki work was published in 1871, in 2 vols., by an accomplished French orientalist, M. Pavet de Courteille. It is to this edition that my quotations of Baber's Memoirs always refer.
As to the journeys by land from Western to Eastern Asia made within the Ming period by Western travellers,



15 & i6 CENT.] PRELIMINARY NOTICES. 153
I rely upon Colonel H. Yule's admirable work, " Cathay and the Way Thither," 1866, in which the erudite author has brought together, with that critical judgment we are accustomed to meet in his writinors, a j^reat amount of Asiatic documents bearing upon the mediaeval geography of Asia, little known or unknown in Europe before, and where he reviews also the reports of some Mohammedan travellers who in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries went to China by land. The most important of these narratives is that written by Gamtheddin Nakkash on the mission Mirza Shah Eok, the son of Timur, sent to the Emperor of China, 1419-22 A.D. It has been preserved in Abd-er-razzak's History of Shah Eok {v. supra) and in Mirkhond's Kauzat-us-Safa. A good French translation of it from Abd-er-razzak's account was published by Quatrem^re in his History of Shah Rok (Not. et Extr., XIV. i. p. 387-426). Yule, in his *' Cathay," cxcix., presented an English version of Quatremere's translation. Mr. Rehatsek published an original English translation of the same narrative as given by Mirkhond (" Indian Antiquary," ii. 1873). Much earlier, W. Chambers had published in the "Asiatic Miscellany," i. 1/85, p. 71 seq., an interesting article with the title ''An Account of Embassies and Letters that passed between the Emperor of China and Sultan Shah Rokh, son of Amir Timur." Chambers translated from Abd-er-razzak's Matla-assaadein. Of great interest in this account are several letters the Chinese emperor had addressed to Shah Rok in Chinese with a Persian translation. The latter is given by Abd-er-razzak, and Chambers turned these letters into English. On p. ccxiv. Colonel Yule's " Cathay " gives Hajji Mahomed's Account of Cathay and the overland route thither (about A.D. 1550), and on p. ccxx. |:he report on the same subject by a Turkish Dervish (c. 1 560). A more detailed account of Cathay, referring to the end
of the fifteenth century, which has not been noticed by



154 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
Yule, is found in the Khitai nameh, written in Persian by Seid All Ukber, a Mohammedan merchant who had spent some time in Peking, and who wrote this book in 1 516 at Constantinople. He gives in it the narrative of his journey overland and of his sojourn in Northern China. Tiie well-known French orientalist Ch. Shefer possesses a complete MS. copy of this interesting account, and in the
" Melanges Orientaux," 2*^TM® s^rie, vol. ix., 1883, p. 31-67^ translated some chapters of it. Before him Mr. Zenker, a German orientalist, had given an abstract of the Turkish version of the book in the "Zeitsch. f. d. Kunde d.
Morgenl.," xv., 1861, p. 785.
It does not seem that after Marignolli, who, on his way to Khanbalik (Peking) in circa a.d. 1340, crossed Central Asia, any European traveller arrived in China overland in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The next who after Marignolli reports again on these tracts is B. Goes. He went in the beginning of the seventeenth century from India through the land of the Upper Oxus to Eastern Turkestan, arrived at the Chinese city of Su cJiou, where he died in 1607. Goes first established the fact that Kathay and China are the same. His narrative has been most ably reviewed by Colonel Yule. In 1879 the Jesuit Father Brucker published in the " £tudes Religieuses " ac Lyon a very valuable paper on the journey of Goes. He gives some hitherto unpublished letters written by Goes during his journey, which throw new light upon his travel. No indication of ancient political or other intercourse between Russia and China previous to the beginning of the seventeenth century is found either in the Russian annals or in any other ancient document. It was only in 1 58 1 that the valiant Yerniak took Sihir, the capital of the Tatar Khan Kuchum, situated 16 versts above Tobolsk on the Irtysh, and it does not seem that the knowledge possessed by the Russians at that time of the northern part of the Asiatic continent extended farther east than



I5&I6CENT.] PRELIMINARY NOTICES. 155
the Eiver Irtysh and the valley of the Lower and Middle Syrdaria. It is, therefore, very curious to find Russians mentioned in ISTortheru China in about 1543 by F. M. Pinto. This Portuguese adventurer and pirate, who had been taken prisoner by the Chinese and condemned to hard labour in the province of Slien si, was finally set at liberty by the King of Tartary (Mongols), who had made an inroad upon China. While he was with his liberator at the city of Tuymican (?), several Asiatic chiefs and their envoys arrived there. I may quote from Figuier's Frencli translation (1628), chap, cxxiv., of Pinto's narrative the somewhat obscure passage referring to these embassies :

" L'autre estoit le roy thes Mogores, dont I'estat est dans le coeur du pais pres des Corazones (Kiiorassan ?) province proche de Perse et le royaume de Dely et de Chitor, et un empereiir nomme Caran, selon nous I'avons appris icy, a les bornes de sa souverainete dans les montagnes de Goncalidan, a 60 degrez plus avant, avec des hommes que ceux du pais a-ppeWent 3foscovites, desquels nous en vismes quelques uns en cette ville, qui sont blonds, de belle taille, et vestus de hauts de chausses, de casaques et de chappeaux, commes les Flamans et les Suisses que nous voyons en Europe, dont les plus honorables avoient dfes robes fourr^es de peaux et les autres de martres sebellines. lis portaient tons des espees larges et grandes, et nous remarquames qu'en leur language ils usoient de quelques mots latins, m^me qu'en baillant ils repetoient par trois fois : Dominus ! Dominus ! Dominus ! ce qui sembloit avoir en eux plus d'apparence d'idolatrie que de religion et ce qu'il y avait de pire en eux estoit le detestable pesche de sodomie, auquel ils estoient grandement addonnez." The statement about the yawning leaves no doubt that Pinto saw genuine Russians. It is still the custom among the common people in Russia to make the sign of the cross upon themselves when yawning and to invocate God. The first recorded Russian intercourse with China dates from the reign of the Tzar Michael Pedorowich, by whose

order, in 1620, Ivan Fetlin, a Kozak of Tomsk, was despatched to get information about the great river Ob and the kingdom of Kitai (China). Petlin, on his return, put down a report on his journey witli a much detailed
iiinerary. The ori<:inal of it is found in the Imperial Public Library at St. Petersburg. It was published in extenso in 1818 by Spassky in the Sibirsky vestnik (in Kussian). Previously Bergeron (+ 1639) in his "Traits des Tartares," p. *io6, and Fischer, in his "History of Siberia," 1774, p. 267, had given incomplete and incorrect accounts of Petlin*s mission. Petlin from Tomsk proceeded southward to the river Abakan (a western affluent of the Yenissei), went to the river Kemchik (Upper Yenissei), and farther on reached a great lake (the Upsa nor), on which was the encampment of the (Mongol) Altyn Khan. Continuing his route, he came to the encampment of Chasaktu Khan (which in our days lies about a hundred English miles south of Uliassutai), and then crossed the western part of the Mongolian desert. He came out, it seems, at the present Kukukhoto, and passed the Great Wall, which he styles the Chinese krym {krem or kreml in th6 ancient Eussian language denotes a wall with embrasures). Finally, he reached the White City, situated on the Yil ho (Peking. Yu ho is still the name of one of the principal canals which traverse Peking). Inside 6f this city was another which he terms Magnit city, in which the Tzar Taibun (Tai Ming ?) lived (evidently the imperial city). Petlin did not see the Tzar Taibun, for he had not brought with him presents. After this Petlin returned home.

of the islands of the Eastern Sea : Ziit kiu, the Lewchew islands of our maps, between Japan and Formosa, which latter island the Chinese geographers in ancient times comprised in the Liu kiu Archipelago ; Zil-sung, Luzon or Manilla ; Mei-lo-kil, where the ting hiang (cloves) is produced, the Moluccas, and many other
islands. Chap, cccxxxiv. deals with Chan-clicng or Champa, K\in-lun or Pulo Condore, Chen-la or Cambodja, Sien-lo or Siam, Chao'iva or Java, and other kingdoms.
®^ In the Ming Geography the article <»n Corea is followed by a notice of the country of the Nii-chi, whose seats were north of Corea (in present Manchuria). They had formerly ruled over Northern China. Their dynasty was known as the Kin or Golden, a.d. ii 15-1234. See note 574. The same race gave subsequently to China the actually reigning Manchu dynasty.



ISS CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
In chap, cccxxxv. we find accounts of Fo-ni or Bruni, Borneo, Man-la-hia or Malacca, Su-men-ta-la or Sumatra, Su-lu or Sulu islands, P'eng-heng or Paliang, on the eastern coast of the Malay peninsula, Jotc-fio or Johor. Of the Portuguese and Dutch, whose maritime and commercial supremacy in the East in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries extended even to China and Japan, mention is made in the same chapter under the names of Fo-lang-hi (Franks) and Hq-lan (Holland) or Hung mao fan (redhaired barbarians). Chap, cccxxvii. describes the rest of the countries situated on the Indian Ocean up to the Arabian Gulf and the African coast, viz., Ku-li, the great rendezvous of foreigners, as the Ming shi states, seems to be Kalicut, on the Malabar coast (but Yule says perhaps Kayal). Ko-chi is Cochin, on the same coast. Little and OxQdX Ko-lan

15 & i6cEXT.] MONGOLS AND OIRATS. 159
The chapters cccxxvii.-cccxxxii. deal with the countries situated north and west of China and reached by 'land. These form the basis of my investigations in the subsequent
pages.
THE MONGOLS AND THE OIRATS IN THE MING PERIOD.
The whole chapter cccxxvii. of the Ming shi is devoted to the history of the Mongols after their expulsion from China, and in the next chapter a long article on the Wa-la, Oirats or Western Mongols, appears. The history of these Oirats of the Mongol annalists, subsequently known also under the name of Kalmuks, UleutJis, Dsungars, is very imperfectly known, and the origin of these appellations is also quite obscure. Besides the Chinese sources of information regarding the history of the Mongols and the Oirats as found in the Ming shi, there exists an indigenous Mongol chronicle, the Altantobchi, in which the Oirats and their intercourse with the Eastern Mongols are frequently spoken of. Two MS. copies of this rare document had been procured by the Eussian missionaries at Peking, and the learned Lama Galsan Gamboyeff, Professor at the University of Kazan, published the Mongol text of it together with a Eussian version in vol. vi. of the "Journal of the Eussian Archaeological Society," 1858. The Allan tohchi (Epitome aurea), or properly Erdenin tohchi (which has nearly the same meaning), is a much confused record of the history of the Mongols down to the sixteenth century, and generally diiftcult to understand. We meet in it with a great profusion of names of men, places, and events recorded incoherently, and in most of the cases we are embarrassed what to make of these stories and to decide to what period tliey are intended to refer. However, a comparison of the Altan tobchi with the Chinese historical accounts respectingr the Moncrols enables us to detect in it a nucleus of authenticity. Sanang Seisen, a Mongol prince, who in



i6o CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
1662 completed Ins History of the J/ow^/o/s (translated into German by I. J. Schmidt, 1829), relied for the period in question generally upon the Altan tobchi. I would observe, before examining the records found in the Ming history with respect to the Wa-la or Oirats, that the existence of a tribe of this name can be traced back to the very beginning of the thirteenth century. In the Yiian shi the Oirats are termed Wei-la or Wa-i-la; in the Mongol annals of the thirteenth century (Yiian ch*ao p*i shi), Oira or Wan Oira. In the Yiian shi annals, s. a, 1204, the Ta-shi Wei-la are stated to have made a league with the Naiman and other tribes against Chinghiz Khan. Ibidem, s. a. 1208, the submission of the Wa-i-la to Chinghiz is reported. That by Ta-shi Wei-la and Wa-i-la the same tribe is meant, namely, the Oirats, is corroborated by Rashideddin, for the Persian historian reports under the same afore-mentioned years the league and the submission of the Oirats (d'Ohsson, i. Z6, 104). In another chapter, where Rashid reviews the tribes of the Mongols, he states that the Oirats had their seats on eight rivers which unite
and then form the river Kem (or Yenissei). Z. c. i. 424
;
Berezin, i. 79. At the time of the Ming the territory occupied by the Oirats extended farther to the southwest. I may finally say that the Horiads of M. Polo (i. 291) and the Voyrats of Piano Carpini (631, 708) are
evidently the same Oirats.
The Mongols are styled Ta-ta (Tatars) and also Menggu^^ in the Ming shi. The history of the Mongols properly does not enter into the programme of my investigations, but in treating of the Wa-la or Oirats I cannot forbear touching also upon the Mongols, who in the fifteenth century for many years were ruled by princes of the Wa-la.
89« Even now-a-days the Mongols are called Meng-gu by the Chinese ; but it seenis the other name has also partly survived in the popularlanguage, which terms the Mongols Ta tz\



15 & i6 CENT.] MONGOLS AND OIRATS. i6r
The Great Geography of the Ming (1461) states that the territories of the Ta-ta (or Mongols) extend to the east to ^-z^/mri^-Aa (south-eastern corner of Mongolia; see farther on), and border in the west upon T'o-hu-ma^^'^ and Sa-ma-rh-kan (Samarkand). To the north they terminate with the desert Sha-mo. Eegarding the Wa-la the same work says only that they live north-west of the desert Sha-mo. The account of the Oirats in the Ming shi begins asfollows :

The Wa-la are a Mongol tribe and live west of the Mongols. (In the article Ha-mi, farther on, it is stated that they lived north of Ha-mi, i.e., beyond the T'ien shan.) After the expulsion of the Mongols from China (a.d. 1368), a high officer of that dynasty, by name Meng1c Tie-mu-rh, had placed himself at the head of the Wa-la, and when he died the people split into three tribes,^^^ the chiefs of which were called Ma-ha-mu (Mahmud),^^ Tax'p'ing, and Ba-Vu F^'o-lo. When the Ming dynasty had established its power in China, these three chiefs of the Wa-la sent embassies with tribute to the Chinese court. In 1409 emperor Yunglo bestowed upon them the title
wang (prince), and named Ma-ha-mu = Shun ning wang, T*ai-p*ing=ffie?i yi wang, and-Ba-t*u P*o-lo=^7^ lo wang. The Wa-la seem to have been on good terms with the Chinese ; they sent frequently embassies. But subsequently, when the Wa-la princes ruled also over the Eastern Mongols, they repeatedly attacked China. Before continuing the history of the Wa-la, I give an abstract of the history of the Mongols according to the Ming shi.
^ The ancient Mongol chronicle designates by the name of Togrnak the Desht Kipchak or the Khanate of the Golden Horde. See Howorth's *' Mongols," ii. .283. ^''^ Sanang Setzen enumerates four Oirat tribes, Durben Oirat, which means the four allies or confederates in Mongol. See farther on. ^* This name and that of Ismaila Taidji, which occurs in the Altan tobchi as that of an Oirat chief, seem to prove that in the period here spoken of Islam was spreading among the Oirats.

i62 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST,
When tlie Yiiaii or Mongol dynasty liad been overthrown (a.d. 1368) by the Ming, the last Mongol ruler (Togan temur or Shun ti) escaped from his capital (Peking) and fled to Mongolia. He went first to JT'ai p^iTig fu (or Shang tu), the summer residence of the Mongol emperors, and not feeling safe there, afterwards continued his flight to Ying chang,^^ where he died in the spring of 1 370, leaving the Mongol throne to his son Ai-yu-shi-li-da-la.^^^ Soon after the host of tire ^ling arrived before Ying ch*ang, the Mongol emperor succeeded in escaping and fled to Ho-lin,^'^ but his son Mai-di-liha-la was captured, as were also the late emperor's wives. In 1372 the Ming emperor despatched a considerable army tinder the command of his generalissimo SiX Ta against the Mongols. Sii Ta proceeded to the Lu Jcii rivyr,^* and advanced even as far as the T\i-la and the A-lv^hun rivers.^* But he was beaten by the Mongols. Ai-yu-shi

After the expulsion of the Mongols from China it became once more the residence of the Mongol khans. The Mhig Oeography, 1461, in enumerating the ruined cities of Mongolia, gives the following notice of the ancient Mongol capital at the end of the article on
the Ta-ta : —The original name of the city was Ho-lin. West of it w as the river Ha-laho-Un, from which the name was derived. T'ai tsu of the Ylian {i.e., Chinghiz) established here his residence. (This seems to be an error ; at lea,-<t the Chinese annals as well as the Persian historians state that Ogotai Khan, in 1234, built Karakorum. It may, however, be that his father had already encamped on the spot.) It was the capital during five reigns. In the reign of Ta te (1297-1308) the province comprising Ho-lin and other places was established (in Mongolia) with the circuit {lu) of Ilo-liv, where was the centre of administration. In 1320 the name of the province was changed. It was then called Ling pei (the province north of the mountains, i.e., the Yin shan chain, separating China proper from Mongolia). The name of the circuit of Ho-lin was also changed into Ho ning lu. 903 This is the Chinese name for the Kerulun river in Northern Mongolia. See note 116. ^^ The Tola river, on which Urga is situated, and the Orkhon.

li-da-la died in 1378. His son T-o-gu-sz' THe-mu-rli^^ succeeded him, and the Ming emperor sent him an envoy to congratulate him on his accession. Subsequently the Mongols frequently disturbed the Chinese frontier. In 1388 the Chinese emperor sent out a great host against them. T*o-gu-sz' T*ie-mu-rh was completely defeated near Lake Pu yii rh hai^ and fled towards Karakorum. When he had gone as far as the Tu-la river he was killed
by Yesi(j-f ie-rh, a man of his suite.
After this five Mongol sovereigns, all usurpers, reigned successively. Their names are unknown, and they all perished by a violent death. Finally ICun t'ie-mu-rh ^^ ascended the throne, and after him Gui-li-cKi reigned.®^^ He assumed the title k 'o-han (Khan),*^ and changed the name of the dynasty (from Yuan) to Ta-ta. This happened in the beginning of the fifteenth century. At that time mention is first made in the Chinese :annals of that powerful Mongol minister A-lu-tai, who ior more than thirty years acted an important part in
Mongol history.®^® In 1405 he killed Gui-li-clii, and placed Ben-ya-shi-li, a descendant of the Yuan emperors,

The same name occurs also in the Altan tobchi, p. 159, as that of a man of importance, but it is not clear who he was. Father Hyacinth makes A-lu-t'ai to be the progenitor of the Eleuths (see his "Historical Sketch of the Oirats," p. 13). But these views are unfounded. According to the Chinese annals, Tung kien kang mu, translated by De Mailla, A-lu-t'ai subsequently tiook the title of Khan, and Howorth (Z. c. i. 356) identifies him with the Mongol Khan Adal in Sanang Setzen's record.

who was tlieu in Bie-ski-ha-li (Bishbalik), on the Mongol throne. The Chinese emperor sent to the Khan, inviting him to acknowledge his supremacy. As Ben-ya-shi-li refused, a large Chinese host marched out in 1408 against the Mongols. Just at that time the Wa-la had got the upper hand at the Mongol court, and Ben-ya-shi-li had retired with his troops, together with his minister, A-lu-f ai, to the Lu-kil (Kerulun river). He was, however, successful, and destroyed a body of Chinese troops in 1409. But in the next year the emperor Yung lo passed in person the Great Wall at the head of half a million of soldiers. Benya-shi-li and his minister could not come to an agreement as to the plan of defence. They separated ; the khan went westward, A-lui-t*ai towards the east. The imperial army pursued the khan, and defeated him at the Eiver Wa-nan, (Onon), and then proceeded to attack his minister, whose army was also destroyed at Tsing ho chen. Soon after,. Ma-ha-mu, the chief of the Wa-la (see above), killed. Benya-shi-li and placed on the Mongol throne Da-li-ha.^^^ A-lu-t*ai in 141 3 acknowledged the supremacy of the Chinese emperor, who bestowed upon him the title of prince of Ho ning. After this he was for his lifetime in constant war with Ma-ha-mu. His appointment by the Chinese emperor displeased Ma-ha-mu, who withheld- his tribute and collected an army. The emperor upon this set out at the head of a large army, defeated Ma-ha-mu,, and pursued him to the river Tu-la. This was in 14 14. The next year Ma-ha-mu sent an embassy to the Chinese court and excused himself. In 14 16 A-lu-t'ai defeated the Wa-la. When Ma-ha-mu died (in 141 8) he was succeeded by his son T^o-huan,^^^ who continued the strife with A-lu-t*ai. The Chinese emperor bestowed upon T*ohuan his father's title. Shun ning wang.

Wa-la plundered Ha-mi. When the emperor reprimanded them, they sent an embassy and solicited pardon. A-Iu-t'ai tried at first to be on good terms with China, but the emperor did not put great trust in him. Indeed, in 1423 intelligence was received that he was upon the point of making an incursion into China. The emperor then once more marched in person against him. On his way he learnt that A-lu-t'ai had been completely defeated by the Wa-la (T'o-huan), and had been obliged to retire to the river Lmo (Southern Manchuria) ; whereupon the emperor returned to China. In 1424 the emperor again marched against A-lu-t*ai, who had made a raid into
China, but was not successful, for A-lu-t'ai had liastily retired. In 1434 To-huan succeeded in killing his enemy A-lu-t'ai and subduing his people. At that time T*o-huan had already killed the chiefs of the two other branches of the Wa-la and united the whole people of Wa-la. After Da-li-ba's death in 1438, he made an attempt to usurp the Mongol throne, but the people did not agree, and T"^ o-fo-hu-hua,^^^ a descendant of the Yiian emperors, was placed on the throne. He was a son-in-law of T*o-huan, who was then occupying the place of prime minister at the Mongol court. When T*o-huan died in 1440, his son Ye-sien, chief of the Wa-la, succeeded him as minister at the Mongol court, with the title T^ai sJii.^'^^ Ye-sien was a clever captain and the ruler de facto. In 1449 he set in motion a large Mongol host towards China. After passing the Great Wall, the Mongols met the Chinese army beyond Suan hua fu. A terrible battle took place near Tu mu^^^ in which the Chinese were completely defeated. The

It is the same as Taidji in the Kalmnk pedigrees given by Pallas (see farther on). ^'* T'u mu is still the name of a place on the road from Peking to Kalgan, west of Huai lal hien.

emperor Ying tsung, who had imprudently advanced, was made prisoner and kept in Mongolia for nearly two years.^^* The Mongols advanced as far as Peking, but were not able to take the capital. Soon after, Ye-sien, who by this campaign had come to great power, assassinated T*o-t*o-bu-hua pnd took possession of the Mongol throne. But his tyranny caused dissatisfaction among the Mongols. He was put to death by a Mongol, A-la-chi-yuan, wlio had a grudge against him, in 1455. The latter" was assassinated by
Bo-lai, and finally Ma-rh-Tc o-la^^'^ the son of T'^o-t^o-hv/hua, was placed on the Mongol throne, with the title Siao
wang tsz' (in Chinese = little king, regulus), by which thenceforth the Mongol rulers are designated in the Chinese annals. Ma-rh-k'o-la transferred the seat of the Mongol government and his residence to the south of the Great Desert, to the pasture-lands bordering upon the Great Wall, and from there the Mongols spread westward over the Ordos. The history of the Mongols and their frequent wars with China are treated of at length in the Ming History down to the middle of the seventeenth century. As to the Wa-la, their influence in Mongolia was broken with the death of Ye-sien, and their people were dispersed. Ye-sien's son Ho-rli-hu-dai with his people settled on the river Gan-gan, whilst his brother Bo-du-wan and his nephew Wn-hun took their abode in Ha mi. In I459 the Chinese emperor bestowed titles upon them. The Ming shi reports that in the reign of TMen shun (1457-65; the Wa-la prince A-shi fie-mu-rli, a grandson of Ye-sien, repeatedly sent tribute to the Chinese court. In 1472 the Wa-la, together with Ha mi and Turfan, sent an embassy to the Chinese court. The emperor refused the

tribute they presented, summoning the chiefs to appear in person. In 1518 the Wa-la prince Bo-liu, profiting by an expedition the Sultan of Turfan, A-hei-ma, had undertaken towards Su chou, attacked and ravaged Turfan. In 1 530 he was defeated by the ruler of Turfan, and subsequently he suffered also a defeat from the ruler of Harai, and found himself constrained to offer his submission to the Chinese emperor, who, however, refused his protection. This is, in short, the history of the Oirats in the Ming period.
The Western Mongols or Oirats, whom the Chinese annalists of the Ming period term Wd-la, are noticed by the Mohammedan writers of the same period under the name of Kalmaks, and even now-a-days this people is known in Europe by the same name, which is more generally written Kalmuh But this appellation is not native, and the origin of it has hitherto not been satisfactorily explained. (Comp. Howorth, I. c. i. 496.) The Arab geographer I bn Alvardi (+ 1349) seems to be the first Mohammedan author who mentions the Kalmaks (d'Herbelot, " Bibl. Or." suh Jagiouge et Magiouge). The Zafer nameh (iv. 6) states that in 1398, when Timur was on the way to Hindustan, and encamped near Kabul, I'aizi Aglen ^^^ of the kingdom of Kalmak, who, for some difference which had happened between him and the Khan at Ulug Yurt,^^^ had fled, came to this place to lay himself at the feet of the throne. Abulghazi Bahadur Khan, in his " History of the Moguls " (p. 36), reports that he himself had spent, in the middle of the seventeenth century, a whole year among the Kalmaks.
As we have seen, according to the Ming history, the Wa-la or Oirats lived north of Ha mi, beyond the T'ien

i68 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
shau mountains; the Ming Geography says north-west of the Sha mo desert. In tlie Mongol traditions the sacred mountain of Bogdo ula (see note i6i) is frequently mentioned in connection with the Oirats. The Great Geography of the present dynasty in the section on the Mongols identifies the Mongol tribe Wu-la-te, now living north-west of the Ordos (the Urads ; see Howorth, I. c. i. 446 and map), with the Wa-la of the Ming, and states tliat they settled there in the beginning of the Ming dynasty. I am not prepared to decide whether there is any foundation for this assertion. The Chinese authors of the present dynasty write the name of the Oirats generally Wei-la-Ve or 0-/w-^'e, whence the spelling Eleuth, first adopted by Father Gaubil, is derived. Regarding the history of the Oirats, or Eleuths, or Kalmuks, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a considerable amount of information is found in Mongol and Chinese literature, and has for the greater part been made accessible to European scholars. I may notice the following works dealing with the Eleuths and Kalmuks :

De Mailla's "Histoire de la Chine," 1776, vols. xi. xii. " Le pays de Tse vang raptan roi des Eleuths, par le pere Gaubil," 1726. "Conquete du royaume des Eleuths par I'empereur K'ien long, par le pere Amiot " (" Mem. cone.
Chin.," i. (1776), p. 325 seq.). Pallas, " Historische Nachrichten tlber die Mongolischen Volkerschaften," 1776. In this work a whole chapter is devoted to the history of the Kalmuks, the information having been gathered directly from the Kalmuks at the Russian frontier. Pallas, therefore, is an independent authority ; he had never seen the Mongol annals of Sanang Setzen, and depends entirely upon the oral traditions of the Kalmuks. In 1834 the Russian sinologue Father Hyacinth published a " Historical Sketch of the Oirats or Kalmyks." This book is of little worth. Hyacinth, not having then access to the Ming shi, translated the fragmentary accounts of the Oirats found in the Si yil t*ung wen chi, a



15 & i6 CENT.] MONGOLS AND OIRATS. 169
work published by order of emperor K'ien lung in 1763, a geographical and historical dictionary of Central Asia, in which the proper names are given in six languages, viz., Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, Eleuth, Tibetan, Turkish. There is considerable confusion in Hyacinth's views and conclusions. A very valuable article, dealing with the same matter, was published in 1880 by V. Uspensky (now Russian Consul at Kuldja) in his account of the country of Kukenor, in the " Memoirs of the Russian Geogr. Soc." (Ethnogr.
section), vi. Uspensky has made use for his historical and geographical investigations not only of the Ming shi, but also of many little-known or rare Chinese historical records of the last or the present dynasty. He draws a
cjreat deal of interest] nor and new information ref]fardin2 the Mongols and Oirats from the Meng ku yu mu ki, a geographical and historical account of Mongolia, published in 1859, and the Si yil kao ku lu, a collection of historical matters referring to the countries of the west, likewise compiled in our days. Professor A. Pozdneyeff, of the St. Petersburg University, in 1883 translated the Mongol annals Erdeniin erikhe into Russian, and accompanied his translation with very valuable notes. These annals refer especially to the history of the Khalkhas in Northern Mongolia down to the year 1736; but include also the history of the Eleuths, who were at constant war with the Khalkhas, their eastern neighbours, and the Chinese. I would finally notice here H. Howorth's "History of the Mongols," 1876. In vol. i. chap. ix. the author gives an admirable historical account of the Western Mongols, which occupies a prominent place in the rank of critical
investigations on the subject. It has been noticed above that the Ming History speaks of three tribes into which the Oirats were divided in the beginning of the fifteenth century. Sanang Setzen, refer
ring to the same period, terms this people Durben Oirat,



I70 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
" the four Oirats," and names these four sections Kergud, Bagluitvd, Khoit, and Oghelet (Howorth, I. c. i. 558). No mention is made in the Allan tobclii of a division of the Oirats. The Chinese historians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, like Sanang Setzen, mention four Oirats, sz 0-la te, but apply to them other names : Choros (Dzungars), Durhet, Turgut, Khoshot (v. infra). These latter names for the four Oirats are found also in the oral traditions of tlie Kalniuks, collected by Pallas. The term Durhen Oirat has generally been translated by " the four allies " (E^niiusat, Schmidt, and others), but Galsang Gamboyefi' suggests that the name Oirat may perhaps be derived from oi orat^ "people living in the forests." Besides this, Uspensky observes that Durhen^ meaning " four " in Mongol, was also the name of a Mongol tribe, which, as he proves from a statement of Kashid-eddin, in the days of Chinghiz Khan was allied to the Oirats. Kashid speaks of a chief of the Oirats called Kutuga Biki, who belonged to the tribe of Durben (Berezin, i. no; d'Ohsson, i. 86). According to the information gathered by Uspensky from Chinese sources, the Oirats, pressed by the ruler of Turfan, began, towards the end of the sixteenth century, to emigrate southward. One part of them reached Si-ning (east of Lake Kukenor), and subsequently settled north of ih^Nan shan (Southern Mountains). In 1638 the emigration of the Khoshots, one of the dominant tribes of the Oirats, to Kukenor is recorded.
According to Pallas {v. supra), the Oelots or Kalmuks are divided into four tribes, viz., Khoshot, Derhet, Soongar^ and Torgot. But farther on he speaks of a fifth one, Khoit. He gives the pedigrees of the ruling khans of these tribes. I may be allowed to give for comparison some Chinese accounts on the same matter.
The above-mentioned Si yii funa wen chi (see chap.



15 & i6 CENT.] MONGOLS AND OIRATS. 171
vii-xi.) states that the tribe of Djun-ga-rh (Dzongar) comprises the four Wei-la-t*e (Oirats) who in ancient times lived north of the Tien shan. The four Oiiats tlien are enumerated as follows :

1. C/io-lo-sz* (Clioros). 2. Du-rh-ho-Ve (the Derbet of Pallas). 3. Huo-shi-t^e (the Khoshot of Pallas). 4. Hui-fe (the Khoit of Pallas). The detailed genealogical tables of the Khans (or Tai' shi or Tai-tsi, as they were generally called ; see note 914) of these tribes, as found in the Chinese work, when compared with Pallas' list, prove that both have been compiled from about the same sources. The names of the Khans in both lists agree in a general way. The Chinese tables are more complete. The tribe Ch^o-lo-sz' (Choros) is not found in Pallas' table, but the names in the pedigree given for this tribe in the Chinese list agree with the Soongarr Khans of Pallas. Indeed, the Dson^ars, as is known, were a branch of the Choros. Some new information on the same subject is found in the Sheng wu hi, a descriptive account of the various mili
tary operations of the present dynasty. We read tliere, cliap. iii., under the head of "Emperor Kang hi's expedition against the Djungars," the following notice regarding the Eleuths :

The 0-lu te (Eleuths) are of Meng-gu (Mongol) extraction. When the Mongol dynasty in China had been overthrown, the Mongol people split into three branches. One of them lived south of the desert, and continued to be called Menggu; another branch lived north of the desert, and they called themselves K^o-rh-lco (Khalkhas). Both {i.e., the ruling khans of both tribes) are descendants of Chinghiz. A third brai^ch dwell westward. They do not descend from Chinghiz, but they trace their origin back to Tohuan T^ai shi and Ye-sien, K^o-han (Khan) of the Wa-la;^^ and the Wa-la are the same tribe we now call 0-lu-t*e

(Eleutlis) and the four Wei-la-t^e (Oirats). After this the Dames of the four Oirat tribes are given as follows :

1. The CIio-lo-sz' (Chores), who have their pasture-land
in I-li.
2. Tlie Du-rh-hO'fey who dwell on the river E-rh-tsi-sz*
(Irtish).
3. The ru-rh-hu-fe (Turguts),92i i^ T a-rh-la-ha-t' ai, 4. The Ho-shi-fe (Khoshots), in Wu-lu-mu-ts % (Urumtsi). Towards the end of the Ming dynasty one branch of the Ho-shi-t*e emigrated. to Tiing hai (Kukenor). The tribe of the Ch*o-lo-sz' had a powerful ruler, H^unfai-gi, who died under the reign of Kang hi.^22 jjjg gQj^^ Ga-rh-dan^'^'^ when he ascended the throne, assumed the title Djun-ga-rh Khan. This is, it seems, the first time that the name Dsungar appears in the Chinese annals. The meaning of this name in Mongol is " the left hand," and also " eastern wing
"
(of the tribe). Dsungar is, therefore, not, as is generally believed, the name of a tribe, but rather a descriptive term. Even now-a-days all the Mongol tribes living in Mongolia consist of a right and a left wing. We know that the Dsungars, who became powerful in the second half of the seventeenth century, and who dominated over the tracts w^e are accustomed to call Dsungaria, belonged to the Chores, who, as we have seen, form one of the great sections into which the Eleutlis are divided. In

WU-LIANG-HA.
Ming shi, chap, cccxxviii.
This country is situated south of the B^ei lung Jciang (Amur river), and north of the defile Yii yang sai.^'^^ The Ming Geography states that the country of Wuliang-ha borders to the east upon ITai si,^^ to the west upon K^ai ping,^^^ to the north upon Pei hai (Northern Sea). At the time of the Han dynasty this was the country of the Sien pi; in the Tang period the T'u-gu-hun dwelt in it, and at the time of the Sung the KH-tan (or Liao) occupied these tracts.^^^ During the Yuan period it formed the northern pait of the circuit (department) Ta ning lu.^^ A.D. 1389, the emperor Hung wu established in this country three wei or military districts,^^^ viz., To-yen, Fu-yii, and T'ai ning.
*^ There is a defile of this name in the mountains north of Kukokhoto. But the country of Wu-liang-ha did not extend so far west. 9-5 According to the Ming: Geography, Hai-si was the name of a district in the territory of the Nii-chi (see farther on), who were the eastern neighbours of Wu-liang-ha. 926 The same as Shang tu, Kubilai Khan's summer residence in SouthEastern Mongolia. 9^7 See regarding these people Klaproth's " Tabl. Hist, de I'Asie." *» See note 930. 9-9 In order to protect the empire against the invasions of their troublesome neighbours, the Ming had established at the frontiers, on the points most exposed to danger, a number of wei or military posts, on which generally districts of more or less extent depended. About fifty wei are enumerated in the geographical section of the Ming shi at the frontiers of China proper, namely, in Liao tung, Chi li, Shan si, Shen si, Kan su, Sz'ch'uan, and even in Yiin nan. Besides this line of defence, the Chinese tried to establish a second one in the adjacent countries not strictly subject to China, but where the tribes had acknowledged Chinese supremacy. In the section of foreign nations in the Ming shi, fifteen of these wei or military stations, or rather districts beyond China, are spoken of, viz., three in South-Eastem Mongolia and Manchuria, eleven in the tract between the T'ien shan mountains and Tibet (in ancient Uiguria), and four in the

To-yen extends from Taning^^^ southward to Si feng Jcoii^^^ and Silan huafu. Tai ning comprises Kin chou, I chou, Kuang ning,^^^ and extends as far as the Liao river. Fu-yii stretches from Huang ni wa (the puddle of yellow mud)^^ to Shen yang (Mukden), T*ie ling, and K*ai yOan (both north-east of Mukden). These military districts were ruled by the chiefs of their own people, but depended on the Ming. The Mongols frequently overran this country, especially during the period when the Oirat chief Ye-sien ruled over Mongolia. The Chinese annals report also several revolts of Wuliang-ha against China. I omit the details. It appears from the above statements that the country of Wu-liang-ha in the Ming period comprised a part of Southern Manchuria (Shen king), and the south-eastern part of Mongolia, east of the Hingnn mountain chain, and north of tlie Great Wall. I am not able to give any satisfactory explanation of the nan].e Wu-liang-ha. I may, however, observe, that in the Yiian period it was applied to the Mongol tribe of the Orianguts (Urankhit), noticed by Eashid-eddin (Berezin, i. 141). Howorth, on his mediaeval map of Mongolia, locates them between the Upper Yenissei and Lake Baikal. Eubruck (327) calls them Orengai. Now-a-days a Mongol tribe called Uranga or
country south-east of Lake Kukenor. These districts were ruled by native chiefs, upon whom the Chinese emperor bestowed Chinese titles and ranks. The chief of Hami, the largest and most important of these uiei, had the title wang or prince (translated sometimes by *' king"), whilst the chiefs of the smaller military districts were raised to more or less elevated Chinese military ranks. Generally they received the rank of chi hui in different gradations, which in the da\s of the Ming denoted superior officers, or they were appointed tsien hu, or captains of a thousand. "^^^ According to the Ta tsing I t'ung chi, the ruins of the city of ^'a ning lie 560 II north-east of the defile of Si feng k'ou, and lOO li south of the left wing of the aimak of Khortsin, on the northern bank of the River Lo Iia. ^" This is the name of one of the gates in the Great Wall towards the Gulf of Pechili. ^'^- All these names can be found on modern maps south-west of Mukden. ^^ Unknown to me ; probably in Northern Manchuria.

The '• Dictionnaire Cor^en-fran^ais/' published in 1880 by the missionaries, however, states (p. 56) that the lerm o-rang-khai is applied by the Coreans to all foreigners.
In the Ming Geography (146 1), chap.

After their expulsion from China by the Mongols in 1234, they continued to live in their original abode in Manchuria. It is known that the actually reigning Maucliu dynasty traces its origin back to the Nti-chi. The Ming Geography states that the Nli-chi live east of Wu-lianf/-ha. and border to the south upon CJiao sien (Corea). Northward their country stretches to the northern sea of Nu-rh-gan, eastward to the sea. When the, Kin reigned, they had in this country one of their residences, Shang king (Upper Residence) or Hul ning fuP^ After the Yuan had overthrown the Kin, the former established in the country of the Nii-chi ^veivanhufu (military posts of 10.000) to protect the northern frontier, viz., at T^ao-wen, Hu-li-gai, 0-do-lin, T'^o-wo-lin, and Po-Uu kiang, situated south and north of the Run-fung river. The country was inhabited by the Nii-chi and the Shui Ta-ta (Water Tatars),^^^ and formed the circuits ot" Ho-lan~fu ^^ and Shui Ta-ta.

In the Ming period, under the reign of Yung lo, in 1409, after these tribes had acknowledged Chinese supremacy, a Chinese governorship was established there at N^c-rh-gan with 184 wci (nulitary districts) and 20 tiien hu su (military posts of 1000) subordinate to it. All these places are enumerated there, and besides this the names of about sixty other districts, cities, and rivers of the same country are given. After this the Ming Geography enumerates the principal mountains and rivers of the country of the Nu-chi, and gives more or less detailed accounts of them, as also of the productions of the country. We find here the first description of the celebrated mountain CJiang po shan (Long White Mountain), the cradle-land of the now reigning Manchu dynasty. This mountain is said there to be situated in the
district of Hui ningfu (see note 934). It is 200 li high, 60 broad, and 1000 li long. On its summit there is a lake 80 li in circumference. Three rivers flow from this mountain, the Ya-lu to the south, the Hun t'ung (Sungari) to the north, and the A-ye-Jcu (probably the Tumen river is meant) to the east. The Ch'ang po shan was already famed in the Kin period. The name occurs repeatedly in the history of the Kin dynasty. I omit the other details of this interesting ancient account of Manchuria, which does not come within the province of my investi

According to these accounts, Hami lies i6cxd li west (misprint for north-west) of Kia yil kuan.^'^'^ Hami borders north ^^^ on the country of the Wa-lcu (Oirats), west on Tu-lu-fan (Turfan) diwA Hito cA^>ii (Karakhodjo), south on Sha chou, Han-dung, CK i-ghin, &c.^^ Fifteen hundred li south-east of Hami is the city of Su chou. At the time of the Han dynasty this was the country of I'Vni-lu, where the emperor Ming ti (a.d. 58-76) established a military district and a military colony. During the T'ang dynasty (618-907) it was known under the name of I chou. In the Sung period (eleventh and twelfth centuries) it belonged to the Hui-ho (Uigurs). At the end of the Yiian dynasty (overthrown in 1368) a prince of the Wei-vm (Uigurs), by name Na-hu-li, ruled over this
country. He had also the title of Su i/;a7i^(prince of Su). When he died, his brother An-ko tHe-mu-rh succeeded him. Hami is a place of great importance, all the envoys (from the West) who proceed to the Chinese court being
*^ As has been noticed in note 883, Kia yil kuan from early centuries was the starting-point for Chinese military expeditions and travellers proceeding to Central and Western Asia, and even India. It was generally believed that this fortress lies in a defile ; but this supposition is a mistake, as my friend Colonel Matusowsky, who visited the place in 1875, explained to me. The small fortress of Kia yii kuan is situated about seventeen miles north-west of Su chou fu, on a river which comes out from the southern mountains, and running in a north-easterly direction, discharges itself into the Too lai river, an affluent of the Etslna river. Whilst this elevated mountain chain, at the foot of which the fortress has been laid out, represents south of the latter an insurmountable barrier, the land north of Kia yii kuan is an inhospitable desert, destitute of water. This geographical disposition explains the importance of the place, situated upon the only practicable way leading from China to Eastern Turkestan. As has been stated above, the Great Chinese Wall terminates near Kia yii kuan, according to Lieutenant Kreitner, who accompanied Count B. Szechenyi on his expedition to Tibet, and visited Kia yii kuan in 1879, about fifty li south of this fortress, in the Nan shan mountains (Kreitner's " lui Fernen Oaten," pp. 641, 642). ^'^ There are several mistakes in the Ming shi regarding the frontiers of Hami, which I correct from the Ming Geography. •^ On all these districts see farther on.

western froiitier.^^^ The population of Hami belongs to three nations, viz., Hui-hui (Mohammedans), Wei-wiu-rh (thus the Uigurs were termed by the Chinese authors of the Mongol period), and Ha-la-hui (unknown to me). Besides these, the tribes of Siao-le-t^u and Me-Uo-li ^^^ are mentioned in the mountains north-east of Haini. I insert here some accounts which the Ming Geography (1461), chap. Ixxxix., gives on the mountains, rivers, and productions of the district of Hami. The THen shan (Celestial Mountain) lies north of the city of Hami. It is also known under the name of Site shan (Snowy Mountain). In the language of the Fan (foreigners) it is termed Dje-lo-man. In times past the Eiung-nu (the ancient inhabitants of Mongolia), when they crossed this mountain, used to descend from their horses and pray. South of it, at a distance of two li, is a salt lake. The mountain Ma tsung shan (horse's mane's mountain) lies at the south-eastern frontier of Hami. In the vicinity is the defile Wan^ hiang ling. On the summit, in a niche in the rock, is an inscription referring to Li Ling.^^ The river Wei-wu-rh is 1 30 li and more east of the city of Hami. The banks of this river are very sandy, and plenty of willow trees grow there. The Niang tz ts'iian (Lady's spring) is east of the Weiwu-rh river. The hu people (Turks) call it K^o-t^m hu-la
*^ In the History of the Posterior Han (first century of our era) it is stated that I-wu-lu (Hami) is the key to the Si yil (Western countries). It belonged originally to the Hiung nu, but in a.d. 73 the Chinese troops conquered it. •'^^ This name occurs several times in the Ming shi. In the article Handung (see farther on) this tribe is called Ye-me-Jco-li, which may also be read Wild Me-k"o-li. It is stated there that they live two days' journey north-east of Hami. *^- The mountain Ma tsung shan and the inscription of Li ling are mentioned in Wang Yen te's narrative, a.d. 982. Li ling was a Chinese general, who, in B.C. 99, was defeated and made prisoner by the Hiung nu.

(Khatun bulak). In the T*ang period an Uigur princess used to live here. The ruins of the city can still be seen. There is also a pond with a hot spring. The river ffo-lo cKuan flows at the south-eastern
frontier of Hami. At the time of the T^ang^ an Ui<:jur princess used to live here. The ruins of the city can still be seen. There is also a pond with a hot spring. (This account is taken from a Chinese itinerary of the Sung period, quoted by De Guignes, Huns i. 37.) The river Kan lu cKuan (see note 1055) is 300 li northwest of Hami. After this the Ming Geography enumerates the products of Hami, viz., liorses, camels, sheep with large tails,
wheat, millet, ivan tou (common peas). Many tsao (fragrant
jujube),^^ tsiu-tsz (fruit of Crataegus), 7m funglil^^^ yin ya
^^ I think we have to read sha tsao (sand jujube), which is the Chinese name for the fruit of several species of Elaeagnus, a very common fruit in Central Asia. ^^ This product, an exudation from the tree hu t'ung, has already been noticed in Wang Yen te's narrative, a.d. 982. It was known in China much earlier. The Pen tsao kang mu, chap, xxxiv., which writes more correctly hu t'ung lei (tears of the hu t'ung tree), quotes an author of the T'ang period, who states that the exudation is caused by an insect, and that the tree resembles the tree t'ung (Paulownia imperialis). Another author of the seventh century reports that the leaves of the hu t'ung tree (literally foreign t'ung tree) resemble the leaves of the poplar tree. The author of the Si yii wen kien lu, who visited Turkestan in the second half of the last century, in giving an account of the products of Central Asia (chap. vii. fol. 9), writes that the characters hu-t'ung here are intended to render a foreign word which means "fuel." The tree grows abundantly everywhere on sandy places, and sometimes forms forests extending for several tens of li. Generally it grows crookedly, and is not fit for woodwork, and even when the stem rises straight, the wood is not durable. The Mohammedans call this tree hu-t'ung, owing to its being fit only for firing stoves. In the hot season the sap of the tree flows down into the sand, and after hardening resembles amber. It is called then hu-t'ung li (hu-t'ung tears). The stem is covered with a white powder like flour, which is called hu-t'ung kien (kien = soda). The Si yii t'u chl gives t'u-hulu-k'o [tugurak] as the local name of the hxi-t'ung tree. In Dr. A. Kegel's account of his journey to Turfan (Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," 1 88 1, p. 382) I find the following short notice referring to the tree in question : —The desert poplar Populus euphratica, called durangun or tugrjJc by the natives, is a very useful tree in the waterless deserts, where it

After the Ming emperor Hung wu had obtained the allegiance of the Wei-wu-rh (Uigurs),^*^ he established military stations in An-ting, A-du-an, K^u-sien, &c., and sent also an officer to An-k'o fie-mu-rh to make known the imperial manifestos. An-k*o t'ie-mu-rh was welldisposed and despatched to the Chinese emperor an envoy, who arrived in 1403, and brought 190 horses as tribute. Besides this, the ruler of Hami sold to the Chinese government 4710 horses from Hami. In 1410 he sent again tribute, and the emperor Yung lo bestowed upon him the title Chung shun v:ang (faithful and obedient prince), and gave him a golden seal. But in the next year An-k*o t*ie-mu-rh was poisoned by the (Mongol) Khan Gui-li-cKi. By imperial order An-k'o t*ie-mu-rh's nephew To-to, who had spent his time of youth in China as a prisoner of war, succeeded him and inherited his
father's title. In 1406 a (Chinese) military station {nj^eij was established in Hami. T'o-t'o was ill-disposed against China and offended the emperor's envoys. Besides this,, he was given to drinking and neglected the ruling of his country. The people revolted. The emperor sent an officer to warn him, but before the latter had reached

Kami, T*o-t*o had died, a.d. 1410. His cousin T'u-li fie-mu-rh succeeded him with the Chinese title of Chung i wang (faithful and righteous prince). He died in 1425. The emperor confirmed T*o-t*o's son Bu-da-shi-li as Chung shun wang, but owing to his minority, To-huan fie-mii-rh, a brother of T'u-li t'ie-mu-rh, was associated with him with the title Chung i wang. The latter died in 1437. His son T^O't'o t^a-mu-rh succeeded, but died a short time aftei'. Bu-da-shi-li died also, and tlien his son Dao-ioada-shi-li took the reic^n of Hami with the title Chunc; shun wang. All these princes had sent every year tribute to the Chinese court. Under Dao-wa-da-shi-li's reign, Yc-sien, Khan of the Wa-la (Oirats), twice took Hami and
made Dao-wa-da-shi-li's mother and his wives prisoners, A.D. 1440 and 1445. Dao-wa-da-shi-li died in 1457. His
brother and successor, Bic-lie-go, reigned until 1460, and as he died without leaving a son, his mother, Nu~wen-dasJii'li, took charge of the regency. The people could not come to terms as to the election of a new ruler, nor did they wish that the country should be governed by a woman. Disturbances broke out, and in 1463 the princess-dowager was obliged to retire to K\c yii^^^ In 1472, Ba-Ca-mu-rh, a grand-nephew of f^o-huaii fie-mu-rh, was appointed by the emperor to rule as a governor over the district of Hami, but he died in the same year, and his son Jlan cJien was appointed governor of Hami. At that time, Su-t'an A-li (Sultan Ali) of T*u-lu-fan (Turfan) arrived before Hami, captured and plundered the city, and seized the golden seal (granted by the Chinese emperor). He took also prisoner the princess-dowager, and carried her along with him. Ali's brother-in-law, Ya-lan, was left to govern Hami. The Chinese military station was then transferred to the newly built city ICu yil. In 1473 ^^^® Chinese emperor gave orders to Li Wen, commander-in-chief in Su chou, to raise troops in the

military districts of ChH-ghin, Han-dung, among the Me Jco li, and other tribes, and direct them against Ali. In winter this host advanced as far as the river Bu-lunggi-rh,^^^ but did not venture to attack the enem}', and returned. The tribes of the Wei-wu-rh and the Me-Tco-li were also transferred to K*u yli. In 1482, Han-ch'en, who had also his residence in K'u yii, rallied the troops of Ch'i-ghin and Han-dung, numbering together with his own people ten thousand men, and suddenly attacked Hami. Ya-lan fled, and Han ch*en entered the city. In 1488 the title of Chung shun wang was bestowed upon him. Meanwhile Sultan Ali had died (1478). His successor, A-hei-ma, in 1488 appeared before Hami, and, under the pretence of proposing a marriage with Han-ch*en*s daughter, enticed him out and killed him. After this, A-hei-ma took possession of Hami, but in the next year he was obliged to give it back. Hnn-ch*en's successor was Shan-ha, a descendant of T*o-t*o's nephew. In 1493 he was made prisoner by A-hei-ma, who once more captured Hami. In 1495 the city was retaken by the troops of Ku yli, Ch*i-ghin, Han-dung, but Shan-ba was released only two years later. He died in 1505. His son Bai-ya-dsi, who succeeded him, assumed the title Su-fan (Sultan). He was an incapable ruler. In 15 13 Su-t*an Man-su-rh of Turfan took possession of Hami, and since that time the Chinese lost their influence there. Hami depended on Turfan down to the year 1696, when, according to the Chinese annals of the present dynasty, the chief of Hami, Beg Abdullah, acknowledged the supremacy of emperor Kang hi. See Eemusat's " Extension de I'Empire Chinois," &c. I may finally notice that, in the " Memoires cone, les Chinois " (xiv, 242, 245, 247), Amiot has translated four

letters written by the princes of Hami or their envoys to the Chinese emperors.
As recrards Western sources of information in the Miner period referring to Hami, we may mention the narrative of Shah Rok's embassy to the emperor of China, which in 1420 passed through Kamul (Yule's " Cathay," cc). B. Goes was the first European traveller who, after
Marignolli, visited this place in 1605 {Lc. 578). More than a century later, between 17 10 and 17 16, the Jesuit missionaries, by order of emperor Kang hi, determined by direct astronomical observations the position of Hami and some places in its neighbourhood (De Mailla's " Hist, de la Chine," xii. at the end). After this, more than a century and a half elapsed before these tracts became again accessible to European investigation. In 1875, the Russian expedition headed by Sosnovsky, when returning from China, passed through Hami. Dr. Piasetsky and Colonel Matusovsky, who belonged to this expedition, have published some interesting notes on this place. Two years later, in 1877, Potanin visited the oasis of Hami; and in 1879 Przevalsky, on his way to Tibet, spent five days there (Potanin's " Mongolia," i. 162; Przevalsky's "Tibet," 68). According to Potanin, Hami (which is the Chinese name) is called Khamil by the Mongols and Kumul by the Sarts. He derives the latter name from Icum, " sand." I finally notice a very valuable article on Hami by V. Uspensky (Russian Consul at Kuldja), which in 1873 appeared in the " Proceedings of the Russian Geogr. Soc," vol. ix. ; see Peterm. "Geogr. Mitth.," 1873, 3I9)- ^t is a historical and geographical account of the district of Hami, compiled from Chinese sources for the greater part hitherto unknown in Europe.

LIU CH'ENG (WILLOW CITY).
Liu cliaig, or, as tlie name is also written, Zu-chen or Liu-chen, is the same as the country of Liu chung (in the middle of willows) at the time of the Han dynasty, where the Chinese governor of the Si yil had established his residence,®^^ In the T*ang period it was the district Liu chung hien. The distance between Liu ch*eng and Huo chou (see the next) in the west is yo li. Hami lies i(XX5 li east of Liu ch*eng.^^^ A great river passes through the country (it seems between Hami and Liu ch*eng). Many bones (of men and beasts of burden) are met with on this road. People say that there are evil spirits who deceive the travellers, making them lose their companions and thus cause their death. After leaving the great river,
the traveller has to cross the Liii sha.^^^ At the foot of a
Fire mountain (v. p. 190) there is an isolated city two or three li wide ; that is Liu ch*eng. There are fields, gardens, shady trees, flowing waters all around. The soil produces millet, wheat, beans, hemp; there grow also peaches, pears, jujubes, melons, bottle-gourds. There are also plenty of grapes, of small size, but very sweet and without seeds. They are called so tsz' pu fao (small grapes).^^^ As to domestic animals, there are cattle, sheep, horses, and camels. The climate there is pleasant. The people are of good character. The men tie up their hair
;
the women cover themselves with black stuffs. The language they speak is that of the Wei-wu-rh (Uigurs). In 1406 emperor Yung lo sent his minister Liu tie

ordered him to bestow on the ruler of Liu clieng, when passing through his city, some pieces of silk. Then in the next year the ruler of Liu cli'eng despatched Wa-cKi-la, one of his captains of a thousand, with tribute to the Chinese court. In 1409, when An (an envoy who had been sent to Samarkand) returned from the west, the ruler of Liu ch*eng sent again an envoy, who accompanied An. He presented tribute, and was rewarded by the emperor. In 141 3 the ruler of Liu ch*eng sent an envoy, who accompanied Bo-a-rh-hin-Vai (an envoy from Huo chou), and in the winter of the same year the captain of a thousand K\Lang-yin-nu was again despatched to the Chinese court. In 1422 Liu ch*eng together with Hami sent an envoy and presented its tribute, consisting of 2000 sheep. In 1430 the ruler of Liu cKeng sent one of his chieftains, A-hei ha-sht, to the Chinese court. Envoys from Liu ch*eng arrived also in 1440 and 1448. Subsequently, when jTu-iu-fan (Turfan) had become powerful, Liu ch'eng was annexed to it.
Liu ch*eng is mentioned in Wang Yen te's itinerary, A.D. 982. Proceeding from / chou (Hami) westward, he came to the country of P^ao-cKv/xng (probably the Pi chart of our days), and then reached Lu chung. He notices also the desert of the demons. On the Chinese mediaeval map of the fourteenth century (see Part III.) the same place is
called Lu-gu-cKen (see p. 31). It is no doubt the same as the city of . Lu-Uo-tsin, marked on modern Chinese maps about sixty li south-east of Turfan. The Jesuit Pather d'Espinha in 1756, by order of the emperor K*ien lung, determined astronomically some cities of Eastern Turkestan and Dsungaria, and among these also Liikotsin, east of Turfan. He terms it Lukikin (Peterm. " Geogr.
Mitth.," 1880, p. 467).

Emperor T'ai tsung of the T'^ang dynasty abolished the kingdom of Kao ch*ang, which then became a (Chinese) district with the name of Si chou. During the Sung period (tenth to thirteenth century) the Hui-hv, (Uigurs) lived in this country, and used to pay tribute to China. The Yuan (Mongol dynasty) called this country Huo chou (fire city or district). It was then comprised, together with the districts of An-ting, Ku-sien, and others (see farther on), in the country of the Wei-wu-rh^^ which was governed by a da-la-hua-cKi (daroga = Mongol governor). In 1406, in the fifth month, emperor Yung lo sent one of his high officers, Liu fie-mu-rh, to accompany the envoy from Bie-shi-ha-li, who returned home.

prince of Huo chou sent as tribute a piece of jade and
some products of his country. In 1409 an envoy from Huo chou arrived with tribute, together with the envoys from Ha-lie (Herat) and Sa-ma-rh-han, and in 141 3 Bo-arh-hin-fai, a military officer of the prince of H'lo chou, came as an envoy with tribute. At the same time the envoys from An-di-gan (Andegan) and Shi-la-sz (Shiraz) and other countries, in the whole nine, arrived at the Chinese capital. The emperor then ordered Clien CHeng (see above), Li Sien, and others to bring his manifestos to Huo chou, and bestow presents of silk and other stuffs on the ruler, to reward his merits. When the Chinese envoys returned, they were accompanied by an envoy from Huo chou. After this for several years no envoys from this country were seen at the Chinese court until 1448, and this was the last time that Huo chou sent tribute. (It belonged to Turfan in the second half of the fifteenth century.) The country of Huo chou is very mountainous. The mountains are of a bluish-red colour, like fire, hence the
name fire city (district). The climate there is hot. The cereals cultivated by the people and their domestic animals are the same as in Liu ch*eng. The city of Huo chou is ten li and more in circumference. There are more Buddhist temples than dwelling-houses of the people.^^^ East of Huo chou there are the ruins of an ancient city, the remains of the capital of ancient Kao cJiang. The country of Huo chou borders north-west on Bie-shi-ha-li, As Huo chou was a small realm, it could not sustain its independency, and Turfan took possession of it.
Kegarding the mountains, rivers, productions, &c., of Huo chou, see T\i-lu-fan, infra.
^"^ This statement is corroborated by the diarist of the embassy of Shah Rok to the emperor of China, which passed through this country in 1420. He mentions Turfan and Karakhodjo, and says that the people of Turfan were mostly Buddhists, and had a great temple with a figure of Sakya Muni (Yule's " Cathay," cc.).



i88 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
Amiot, in the " Mem. cone, les Cliinois," xiv. 272, notices several embassies sent by the ruler of Huo chou to the Chinese emperor, and translates the respective letters of credence. Sa-ha-la, prince of Huo chou, sent jade and horses as tribute, ffan wan, sent with tribute by the prince of Huo chou, supplicated for silk stuffs. The dates of these letters are not given. Huo chou or Karakhodjo (see note 954) is mentioned in the narrative of Shah Eok's embassy to the emperor of China (see note 957). The Mesalek alabsar (first half of the fourteenth century), p. 224, gives an itinerary from Samarkand to Khanbalik (Peking), in which it is stated that from Almalik to Kamtchou (Kan chou), the first city of Khata on the way, they reckon forty days' journey, and the way passes through Karakhodjo, Dr. A. Kegel seems to be tlie first European who visited Karakhodjo in 1879. The Jesuit missionaries may have been there in the last century, but this name does not appear in their accounts. Eegel (Peterm. " Geogr. Mitth.," 1880, 206) writes the name Karagndja, and states that it is a considerable place, situated on an oasis in the desert, forty versts east of Turfan. He saw near Karagudja the vast ruins of an ancient city, with the remains of a beautiful sepulchral mosque, 400 years old. Eegel reports that, according to tradition, this city, which he terms Old. Tur^ fan, was founded by the heathen emperor Takianus, and destroyed 400 years ago. It seems to me that these ruins must rather be referred to ancient Karakhodjo. With respect to Takianus, Yule in his " M. Polo," i. 116, observes, that all over Mohammedan Asia there aie old sites to which legend attaches the name of Dakiamcs, or the emperor
Decitis.

Ming shi, chap, cccxxix.
T*u-hi-fan (the city) is situated west of Huo chou 100 li. It is distant from Hami more tliaii 1000 li, from Kia yii kuan 2600 li. It lies in the land of ancient CKe-shi, anterior kingdom (see note 955), or Kao cUang, as it was called during the Sui dynasty. The T*ang abolished Kao ch'ang and established in its place tlie district of Si chou, with the capital Riao ho hieny^^ The city of T*u-lu-fan
is situated where the city of An lo ciieng, depending on Kiao ho hien, stood. The Sung (960-1 127) restored the name of Kao cJiang. The Hui-hu (Uigurs) then occupied this country, and used to send tribute to the Chinese court.^^^ The Yuan (Mongol dynasty) established here the head-quarters of a corps of a 10,000. The Ming Geography, chap. Ixxxix., gives some particulars \vith respect to the mountains, rivers, productions, &c., of Turfan, Huo chou, and liu cli*eng, a translation of which I'
proceed to insert here. The mountain Ling shan (mysterious mountain) is situated north-west of the city of T*u-lu-fan. The stones (rocks) there show fine veins like hair. There is also a heap of very hard and bright white stones like bones.^"^ The people call this the place where a million of lo-han (saints, arhat) used to shave their hair and entered into

In the above-quoted article of the Tsien Han shu (see note 955) we read that already before our era the capital of the anterior kingdom of Ch'e-shi was Kiao ho cKeng, or the city surrounded by a river. ^^^ In A.D. 981 Wang Yen te was sent by the Chinese emperor to the prince of Kao ch'ang (see i. 244), "** Evidently a sacred stone heap called "obo " by the Mongols. ^^ According to the author of the Si yii wen kien lu (last century), chap. i. fol. 6, the Ling shan is a mountain south of Urnmtsi, belonging to the T'ien shan. This name has been given to it on account of the marvellous phenomena seen there. It seems to me that Ling shan is probably the celebrated Bogdo ula. See note 161.

The Ch'i ski shan (mountain of red rocks) is a picturesque peak north-west of T'u-lu-fan. It bears this name owing
to the red colour of its rocks.®^^ The mountain T'^an han is seventy li north of the red mountain. Even in summer great masses of snow are accumulated on it. North of this mountain is the boundary
of the Tic-le tribe.^^^ The Huo yen shan (fire mountain) lies east of the city of Liu cKeng. The Sung History gives the following
account of this mountain :—" North of Pei fing (believed to answer the present Urumtsi) is a mountain, the interior of which contains nao sha (sal ammoniac). Inside there is a perpetual fire, and the smoke sent out from it never ceases. Clouds or fog are never seen around this mountain. In the evening the flames issuing from it resemble
torch-light. The bats, from this phenomenon, appear also in a red colour.^^ The mountain Ting hu shan is north of the city of Liu cli eng. There is on it an ancient temple, dating from the time of the T 'ang, with a monument bearing an inscription. The Sung shi, article Kao ch*ang, states that there are more than fifty Buddhist monasteries, all established in the T*ang period. They then possessed the great collection of Buddhist works and several Chinese dictionaries.^^ The T'ien shan (Celestial mountains) is north of the city of Kiao ho cKeng.

KH lien shan. Here was in tlie days of the T'ang.the city T'ien shan Men. The sea (or rather lake) P^u cKang hai'^ is situated south-west of Tu-lu-fan. It is also called Yen tse (Salt lake) or Fo si hai, and is 400 li in circumference. As has been ascertained by Chang KHen, who travelled to the countries of the west, the river which discharges itself into this lake is formed by two rivers ; one of them comes from the Tsung ling mountains (west of Kashgar and Yarkand), the other from Yil fien (Khotan). They unite, and then the river flows eastward and empties itself into the lake. Farther on the water flows undeiground for a thousand li, and issues out again at the foot of the Tsi shi shan mountain. This is the Ho .(Yellow Kiver).^^ The river Kiao ho passes twenty li west of Turfan. It takes its rise in the T*ien shan mountains. Farther on it divides into two branches, surrounding the city of Yai-rhch*eng.^^ This is the same as Kiao ho Men in the days of the T^ang. See note 958. San hai (the characters mean northern sea) is the name applied to the land (desert) stretching from the city of Liu eh' en eastward. There is nothing but sand and stones. There are furious winds in this desert. When encountering them, travellers and horses perish. Han hai is a

But as the whole information it gives about this lake is borrowed from the Ts'ien Han shu, chap, xcvi., introduction, I did not hesitate in writing the name as it is found in the original. The conipilators of the Ming evidently mean Lake Lopnor, but confound it with the lake of P'u lei. The latter is also an ancient name, identified by the Chinese with Barkvl of our days, situated north-east of Turfan, beyond the T'ien shan. ^"^ The famous Chinese general Chang K'ien, who about 120 B.o. returned from his long journey to the western countries, had made some investigations about the sources of the Yellow River, and suggested that the water of the Lopnor, after running underground for a great distance, communicates with the visible sources of the Yellow River near the aforementioned mountain Tsi shi shan (on the Chinese map south of Lake Kukenor, about 34° N. lat.).

The Ming Geography mentions the following products in T*u-lu-fan, Huo chou, and Liu ch*eng :

Horses,— camels,

sha shu (sand rats). They are as big as rabbits. The birds of prey catch and eat them.^^^ Yin

Tsz' mi (thorn honey), a kind of honey (mi) of very tine
taste produced upon a plant called yang tsz\^'^^—A-wei.
*^ Compare also note 9. ^^ The Chinese text can also be understood : they are eaten (by the people) after being caught by birds of prey. The Chinese traveller Wang Yen te (see i. 244) notices in the country here spoken of a kind of rat a» big as a rabbit, with red spots. They are eaten by the people, who use birds of prey for catching them. In the T'ang History, chap, cclviii.6., article Yvr-t'ien (Khotan), mention is made of sha tsi shu (desert rats) a* big as hedgehogs occurring west of Khotan and running after the horses. It seems to me that here jumping hares or Jerboas are meant. Thest* beasts are frequently met in the deserts of Mongolia and Central Asia, especially the Scirtetes jaculus, termed Alakdaga (spotted colt) by the Mongols, Morin yalma (horse jumper) by the Kalmuks. Marco Polo'a Pharao rats eaten by the Mongols (i. 244) are, as Colonel Yule has already pointed out, the same. ^^^ It seems that by yin ya Me and su-ho kiie horns of antelopes and stags are meant (kue=horn in Chinese). The young soft horns (antler5i)i of Cervus elaphus and Cervus axis, in Chinese lu jung, are prepared by the Chinese for medical purposes. I have seen also in Peking druggists' shopsthe full-grown horns of Antilope Saiga and of the elk. All these hornscome either from Manchuria or from Southern Siberia. According tO' Potanin ("Mongolia," i. 83) there is a great trade with deer's horns in Uliassutai. Ibidem, ii. 142, the male of Cervus elaphus is called sogo by the Mongols, This may explain the term su-ho kiie. ^^ The information here given about the po tie and the plant k'u san ia originally found in the T'ang shu, article Kao ch'ang. It appears also in Wang Yen te's narrative. It seems to me that we have here an incorrect description of the cotton plant, first introduced into China from Central Asia in the ninth or tenth century, and thus little known in the period here spoken of. The Chinese text in the T'ang shu does not mention the k'u san plant, but states simply that the po tie is woven of the blossoms of a plant. ^'^ This statement on the honey -bearing plant has been copied out from.

The name of T^u-lu-fan appears for the first time ia the Chinese annals s. a. i^y/ (it was unknown, it seems,. during the Mongol period). The Ming shi records that tlie ruler of T*u-lu-fan, having repeatedly plundered foreign embassies proceeding through his dominions toChina, the emperor in 1377 despatched an army to punish him, and the country was ravaged by the imperial troops. In 1406 the emperor Yung lo sent an envoy to Bie-shiba-li (iMoghulistan), who, when passing through T*u-lu

mu-rh, a commander of a thousand, to the Chinese court. The envoy carried with him jade as tribute. In the next year he reached the capital. In 1408 a Buddhist priest, by name Tsing-lai, arrived with seven disciples (from Turfan) at the capital and presented tribute. The emperor was desirous that they should change their foreign customs, and bestowed upon the chief priest and his followers Chinese titles and rewarded them richly. Subsequently the intercourse with T*u-lu-fan was not interrupted. This realm used to send as tribute to China highly-bred horses and gerfalcons, and products of the country. The Son of Heaven also sent his envoys to Tu-lu-fan. In 1422 the chief of T'u-lu-fan, by name In-gJii-rh-cKa, had been expelled by Wai-sz\ the chief of Bie-shi-ba-li. He then appeared before the emperor to complain. The emperor bestowed upon him a military rank, and caused the ruler of Bie-shi-ba-li to surrender
In-ghi-rh-ch*a's land. The latter was very grateful. In 1425 he came in parson, at the head of his tribe, to the Chinese court and presented tribute; and in the next year he appeared again, and was well received by the emperor. After his returning home he fell ill and died. In 1428 his son, Man-Jco THe-mu-rh, went in person to pay tribute. In 1430, again, an embassy from T*u-iu-fan was seen at the court, but then for about ten years no tribute was offered by this kingdom. When, in 1 441, the envoy from Mi-si-rh (Egypt) returned home, the emperor ordered that various silk stuffs should be bestowed upon the chief of T'u-lu-fan, by name Ba-la-ma-rh ; whereupon the latter in the next year sent tribute to the court. T*u-lu-fan borders upon Bie-shi-ba-li and Yil t^ien^''^ which are both great kingdoms. It was at first of little authority, but afterwards, after taking possession of Huo chou and Liu cKeng (Karakhodjo and Lukotsin, v. supra)
,
in the middle of the fifteenth century, T*u-lu-fan became powerful, and its chief, Ye-mi-Li hiio-.djo, accordingly

assumed the title of wang (king or prince). Envoys from this country were seen airain at the Chinese court in 1452 and 1459, when an embassy of twenty-four men arrived. In 1465 it was settled that in future T'u-iu-fau should send tribute every three or five years, and the number of men composing the embassy should not ex
ceed ten. In 1469 an embassy from T'u-lu-fan arrived, and
reported that their ruler had taken the title of Su-t^'an (Sultan), and now asked the permission to use gerfalcons, parade horses, and cloths with embroidered dragons {i.e., attributes of imperial authority). But the Board of Rites refused, and only presents of silk stuff were bestowed upon the envoy. In the next year the Sultan of T'u-lu-fan sent again an envoy, who asked for certain imperial ornaments, stirrups, saddles, and other things, for his sovereign ; but the Board of Kites again refused to grant this request. At that time T'u-lu-fan had risen to considerable power. Su-fan A-li (Sultan Ali) of T*u-lu-fan, profiting by the circumstance that in Hami there was no ruler (see above), in the spring of 1473 attacked the city, captured it, and carried away with him the princessdowager and the golden seal (given to the prince of Hami by the Chinese emperor). He left his brother-in-law, Ya-lan, with a part of his troops in Hami to maintain the place. The Chinese emperor then ordered Li Wen to rescue Hami, but the latter returned from this expedition without any success. Subsequently A-li sent envoys with tribute to China, as T'u-lu-fan had used to send in former times, and even three envoys arrived at the capital in the same year. They were well received by the emperor, and no bitter word was said to them in allusion to the behaviour of the Su-t*an. However, his envoys displayed great arrogance, requesting, among other things, elephants as a present. The Board of War replied that elephants were an attribute of the imperial cortege only. The emperor received them as presents (from his tribu

taries in the soutli), but would never agree to bestow them upon other people. The envoy then made allusion to T*u-lu-fan's increasing power, in having taken possession of Hami, K'u-sien (see farther on), &c., having captured more than io,ooo men of the Wa-la (Oirats), and pointed to the Necessity for China to be on good terms with the Su-t*an of T*u-lu-fan, through whose dominions all the envoys to and from the west had to pass. But the emperor did not pay much attention .to these arguments. Subsequently A-li's heart changed for the better. He sent again tribute, and no mention was made by his envoys of his former arrogant requests. They endeavoured to re-establish the good understanding with China, and solicited for their sovereign the favour to be officially acknowledged as Su-tan of T'u-lu-fan. The emperor made the condition to release the princess-dowager and hand over the seal of Hami. Some time after a new embassy with tribute arrived from T*u-lu-fan, but the^ did not bring the golden seal of Hami. In 1476 the governor of Kan chou reported that he had been informed by some (foreign) envoys who had passed through T*u-lufan of the death of the princess-dowager of Hami, and that the Su-t*an was not disposed to hand over the seaL Whereupon the emperor refused to receive in the future the envoys of Ali. In 1478 Ali died, and his son A-hei-ma (Ahmed) succeeded him as Su-t*an of T*u-lu-fan, and after his accession sent an envoy to the Chinese emperor.. In 1482 Han-cKen (the ruler of Hami, v. sujpra) succeeded in rallying troops and expelling the people of T*u-lu-faa from Hami. In 1488 A-hei-ma arrived before Hami, enticed Han-ch*en out, killed him, and captured again Hami. After this he sent an embassy to the Chinese emperor to ask for various imperial attributes ; but the emperor gave orders to stop the embassy at Kan chou, and retain its members as prisoners. In 1490 another embassy, accompanying the envoys homSa-ma-rh-hany and carrying lions as presents, was despatched by A-hei-ma to promise the



i5&i6cKNT.] TURFAN, 197
seal of Hanii on condition that the imprisoned embassy should be released. Some of the Chinese ministers proposed to break off entirely the intercourse with T*u-lu-fan. In 149 1 A-hei-ma sent again lions to China, and his envoys promised tliat the seal of H;imi, and eleven captured cities belonging to Hami, should be surrendered ; and indeed the restitution of the seal and the cities ensued, whereupon the emperor ordered the embassy of T*u-lu-fan, in the whole twenty-seven men, to be released. The latter had not yet reached the frontier, when a new embassy despatched by A-hei-ma, consisting of thirty-nine men, reached Pekinsr. But meanwhile A-hei-ma had a^ain attacked Hami (in 1493), captured the city, and made prisoner Shan-ha, the prince of Hami. As soon as this fact had become known, the emperor ordered the arrest of all the members of the embassies of A-hei-ma in China, in the whole 172 men, and their imprisonment at Kan chou. At the same time the passage through Kia yli kuan was shut up. Besides taking these measure?, the Chinese government rallied troops, who marched to attack A-heima. The latter, being apprehensive of a simultaneous attack by his other neighbours, who hated him also (the Oirats), thought it more prudent 'to withdraw and abandon Hami to the Chinese. But he took Shan-ba with him as
prisoner. This happened in 1495. It was only in 1497 that Shnn-ba was released, when A-hei-iua sent him to tiie Chinese frontier, and solicited the permission of again sending tribute. The emperor agreed. Tlien, in 1499, an embassy arrived from T'u-lu-fan, and solicited the release of the 172 men of the former embassies imprisoned in Kuang tung (Canton).^^7 The emperor granted this request. In 1 504 A-hei-ma died. There was a struggle between his sons about the succession. Finally, the eldest, by name of Man-su-rh, got the upper hand, declared himself Su-t*an, and sent an embassy with tribute to the Chinese court. In 1513 JJai-ya-dsi, ipTiuce of HamJ, who was an incap

able ruler, abandoned Chinese protection and fled to T*ii-lufan. Man-su-rh sent to take possession of Hami. Henceforth the Chinese government had no authority with respect to Hami, and was frequently troubled by Mansu-rh, who invaded Su chou and Kan chou. In 1528 it happened that one of his generals, Ya-lan, surrendered to the Chinese. Ya-lan was originally a man from K'ii-sien (see farther on). He had been made prisoner by Su-t*an A-li when he was a boy, and subsequently he had married a sister of Ali. Man-su-rh, when he heard of this treason, got very angry. He tried, at first to cause the Wa-la (Oirats) to unite with him for an invasion of Su chou, and then entered into negotiations with the Chinese about the delivery of Ya-lan. But the Chinese government were not willing to accede. Man-su-rh died in 1 545, designating his eldest son, SKa^ as his successor. But Sha's brother, Ma-hei-ma, laid claims to the throne, and took possession of a part of Hami. After marrying a wife from the Wa-la people (Oirats), he, together with these allies, attacked his brother. In 1 547 envoys from T*u-lu-fan arrived with tribute to the Chinese court. It was settled that T*u-lu-fan was to
send tribute once every five years. In 1570 Sha died, and his brother Ma-hei-ma ascended the throne of T'u-lu-fan, and despatched an embassy to China. But his three brothers revolted, and one of them, named So-fei, aspired to the crown, calling himself Su-t^an, and sending an embassy to China. During the reign of emperor Wan li, 1573-1620, no embassy from T*u-lu-fan has been recorded in the Chinese annals.
This is a r^sumS of the history of Turfan in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, drawn from the Ming history. Not wishing to fatigue the reader with a literal translation of the whole article, I have omitted many details destitute of interest.



i5&i6cENT.] TURFAN. 199
I may notice here tliat in the " Mem. cone, les Chinois,"
t. xiv. p. 242, 245, 247, Father Aiiiiot has translated three petitions addressed to the emperor of China by A-hei-ma and Shan-si-ting, envoys from T'u-lu-faii.
Turfan seems to have been a powerful kingdom in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. As lias already been noticed, the name Turfan does not appear in the records of the authors, either Chinese or Mohammedan, referring to Eastern Turkestan in the Mongol period, whilst they frequently mention the city of Huo chou or Karakhodjo in the country of the Uigurs, situated about twenty-seven English miles east of modern Turfan. The Chinese notice Turfan for the first time s. a. 1377. This leads us to suppose that tills city was built only a few years earlier, and then became the residence of the rulers of those tracts. According to the Si yil wen kien lu, a Chinese description of Turkestan of the last century, " turfan," in the language of the people of Turkestan, means " residence." The names of the rulers of Turfan in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as given in the Chinese account, are for the greater part found in the Tarikhi Easjiidi, a history of Eastern Turkestan or Moghulistan, written in the middle of the sixteenth century, and other Mohammedan historical records referring to the same country .^^^ According to the Mohammedan authors, it was Khizr Khodja Khan of Kashgar and Moghulistan, end of the fourteenth century, who, next Kashgar, made Turfan the second capital of the Moghul empire. The In-ghi-rh-cKa, ruler of Turfan, who, according to the Chinese annals, had been expelled by Wai-sz\ is not mentioned by the Mohammedan authors, but Wai-sz' is without doubt the Weis Khan of Moghulistan whom the Tarikhi Kashidi states to have been killed in 1428. After his death a

division among the Moghuls took place. Yunis Khan reigned in Transoxiana, whilst Isan Buka, + 1462, and after him his son, Dost Mohammed, -\- 1468, ruled over Eastern Moghulistan. The son of the latter, Kepek Sultan, expressly stated by the Mohammedan authors to have ruled in Turfan. This may be the sovereign of Turfan who, in 1469, sent an envoy to inform the Chinese emperor that he had taken the title of Su-fan. Sultan Ali of Turfan, who, according to the Chinese annals, in 1473 captured Hami and died in 1478, is not noticed by the Mohammedan historians. But his son, Su-fan A-hei-ma, whose death the Chinese record s. a. 1 504, is without doubt the Sultan Ahmed Khan of the Tarikhi Eashidi, where it is stated that already in the lifetime of his father, Yunis, he governed the Eastern Moghuls, with Aksu, Turfan, &c. He was defeated by Sheibani Khan in 1503, and died of grief in 1 504. He left seventeen sons, of whom Mansur, the eldest, succeeded. All the sons quarrelled. Mansur exercised authority at Aksu and in the whole territory to the east as far as Chalis and Turfan, He died in 1 544. This is the Su-fan Man-su-rh of the Chinese authors, according to whom he died in 1545, and was succeeded by his son Sha, evidently the Shah Khan of the Mohammedan
historians. Compare also note 1013. Yule, "Cathay," 576, quotes a passage from Haidar Eazi, who in the last century wrote a history of Turkestan, and states that Jalish (Kharashar) is a city near Turfan, both places being under a prince called Mansur Khan, who is mentioned about 1531 as marching by Jalish to attack Aksu. Turfan since the fifteenth century has been repeatedly visited by Western Mohammedan and Christian travellers. The embassy of Shah Rok (see note 957) passed through Turfan. In Hadji Mohammed's account of Katliai, a.d. 1550, it is stated that from Camul to Turfon are tliirteen days' journey (" Cathay," ccvii.). We know that Benedict Goes, on his journey from India



i5&i6cENT.] TURFAN. 201
to China in 1605, halted a month in the fortified town of Turphan (1. c. 578). About a century and a half later the Jesuit missionaries, by order of the emperor K*ien lung, visited these tracts, and Fatlier d'JSsjnnha even determined astronomically the position of Turfan in 1756 {Peterm. "Geogr. Mitth.," 1880, p. 467). But after this, Eastern Turkestan remained a<4ain inaccessible to European exploration for more than a century. Dr. A. Rerjel was the first modern European traveller who visited Turfan, in 1879, and published an account of the city and a sketch map of it (Peterm. ''Geogr. Mitth.," 1880, p. 205, i88r, map 18). These regions, however, are still very imperfectly know^n, and what w^e know about them is almost exclusively derived from Chinese sources of information. We have seen that no trace of commercial or diplomatical intercourse between China and Turfan is found in the Ming shi posterior to A.D. 1 570. After a long suspension of intercourse, an embassy from T*u-lu-fan to the Chinese court is again recorded in the annals of the present dynasty under the year 1646. We read in the Sin kiang chi Ho a description of Turkestan, 1820, that in this year A-hu-le A-ha-me-t'e (Abul Ahmed), prince of T*u-lufan, despatched an embassy with tribute to Shun chi, the second emperor of the Manchu dynasty. Sub anno 173 1 it is recorded that A-min ho-dja, chief of the Mohammedans in T*u-lu-fan, acknowledged the supremacy of the Chinese •emperor, and in consideration of his merits he was invented with the military rank of commander of a division, and accordingly transferred his residence to Xua chou (nearer to China). When the author of the Si yii wen kien lu visited Eastern Turkestan, about 1760, Tu-rk-fan was the residence of Su-li-man, son of A-min huo-djo, who ruled over
six cities, viz., T\c-rh-fan, Pi-djan, Lu-cju-tsin, Se-geng

Turkestan were administrated by officers appointed by the Chinese government and changed according to the rules, Su-li-man had been left hereditary ruler of his country. Among these cities, the Chinese author says, only T\t-rkfan is well populated. The whole population of all these cities may be estimated at 3000 families at the most. For the greater part they are very poor, and not able themselves to provide for their livelihood. In summer-time it is very hot there, and dust is whirled up by the wind. To the south-east of T*u-rh-fan is a mountain ridge entirely destitute of vegetation. Here the sun-blaze is insupportable, wherefore these mountains have been named Huo yen shan, or "fire mountains" (vide note 964). It is not very cold there in winter-time, and snow is also scarce. The products of the country are wheat, millet, sesam, and many varieties of water-melons, melons, and grapes, the
best in the west. The soil is fertile. Cotton and bean.sare much cultivated. One li north of T'u-rh-fan there are sometimes heavy hurricanes, carrying away donkeys and sheep. To the south of T*u-rh-fan all the land is a. desert, in which great herds of wild camels and wild horses are found. The Sin kiang chi lio enumerates in the whole twentynine cities and smaller places depending on Turfan. After the conquest of Eastern Turkestan by the Chinese in the last century, the more important cities there received Cliinese names. Thus Turfan was named Kuang an
cUeng.
Turfan. Their position is more correctly indicated on Kegel's mao. Kegel, however, visited only Turfan, Toksun, and Karakhodjo. In the name PI djan we can trace the Pao chuang in Wang Yen te's itinerary (a.d. 982). This Chinese traveller on his way from Hami to Kao ch'ang (Karakhodjo), after crossing a desert, came to Pao chuang, then passed by Liu chung (Liu ch'eng, Lu-gu-ts'in, v. supra), and reached Kao cb'ang» T'o-k'o-sun is also an old name.



15 & i6 CENT.] SI FAN. 203
THE MILITARY DISTRICTS OF SI FAN.
Under this head the Ming shi, in chap, cccxxx., gives a historical account of the country south and south-east of Lake Kukenor during the Ming period. It is stated there that the name Si fan is applied to the territory situated beyond the frontiers of the Chinese provinces of Shen si (then including the eastern part of present Kan su) and Sz ch'uan, and inhabited by various tribes of Tangut race, anciently known in Chinese history under the name of Si Kiang. The military districts established there by the first Ming emperor, Hung wu, were ruled by native chiefs, who had acknowledged Chinese supremacy, and who were placed under the direct control of four military admini
strations, which had their seats in Si ning, Ho chou, T^ao chou, and Min chou (south-east of Lake Kukenor, in Kan su). In 1 5 12 the country of the Si fan was ravaged by the Mongol chief 1-hu-la T^ai shi, who took possession of the province of Tsing hai or Kukenor. The Kuang yii ki, chap. xxiv. fol. 24, notices that Si fan comprises the territory to the south-west of Shen si, west of Sz' ch'uan and north-west of Yun nan. There were two wei or more important military districts in Si fan, viz., Do-gan and Ztmg ta^ and thirty smaller dependencies, all enumerated in the Ming Geography as well as in the Kuang yu ki. The tribute presented by the Si fan tribes to the emperor used to be carried to the court at Peking by way of Ya chou in Sz' ch*uan. The same Chinese works give also a short account of the mountains, rivers, and products of the Si fan country. The K'^un lun chain, a high mountain to the north-east of the district of Do-gan, is covered with eternal snow. Its local name is I-rh-ma-hu-la.^^ The Yellow Elver runs 500 li south of this mountain.
**> The K'un-lun mouutain, celebrated in Chinese legends, dividing Tibet from Mongolia and the Tarim basin.



204 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
On the border of Si fan there is tlie lake if'o-&o. It is more than seventy li in circumference. It discharges its water towards Yiin nan. This river unites with the river Si-rh, and then takes the name Yang-pi. The Hut river (the Chinese character, not distinctly printed, is perhaps to be read Dseng) comes out from the south-east (southeastern border of Sifan ?) and is called Lu river.^^^ The Huang ho^ or Yellow River, takes its rise on the western border of thfe district of Do-gan, west of the tribe Ma-hu-7nan. Farther on, the river in its course is for some distance hidden underground and reappears again on the surface, forming more than a hundred springs or lakelets like stars. The native name of these lakes is Huo-tun nao-rh. The river then takes for more than lOO li a nortli-easterly direction and forms a great lake. Farther eastward, the river takes the name Chi pao ho. It is joined by the Hulan and other affluents, and finally takes the name Huang ho.^^^ The Ming Geography mentions several tributaries of the Upper Huang ho ; but these names are not found on modern maps.
Si fan in Chinese means " Western Barbarians." The Chinese generally apply this name to the tribes who have their seats in the alpine country south of Lake Kukenor, the land of the sources of the Yellow River, and in the north-western mountainous part of Sz' ch*uan ; but sometimes the Chinese historians use it as a synonymous term for Tibet. For further particulars see the article on
*-^ K'o-ho is perhaps intended for GoTcpo, one of the sources of the Bramaputra, and Yang pi for Tsanpa, an affluent of the latter river. The Ln river or Sahven is marked in the same regions on our maps. Compare Colonel Yule's interesting investijjaticms regarding these rivers in his article "The River of Golden Sand." 1880. ^8- According to modern Chinese maps, the plain in which the abovementioned lakelets are found is called Odon tala (starry plain) by the Mongols, and Sinr; su hai (starry lakes) by the Chinese. The large lake noticed in the Ming Geography is the Oriwj nor of our maps. After leaving this lake the river takes the Mongol name Khatun gol.

Tibet in Part IIF. The Ming shi terms Tibet Wu sz' dsang (see farther on). The Chinese identify Si fan with Tangut (Hyacinth's " History of Tibet and Kukenor," pref. viii.). Indeed, the Tangutans of Przewalsky, north-east of Tibet, in the Kukenor country ,^^ correspond to the Si fan.
The rest of chap, cccxxx. in the Ming shi is devoted to six other military districts, situated partly in Kukenor and Northern Tibet, partly in Kan su, west of Kia \ ii kuaru I shall give an abstract of these accounts presently.
THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF AN-TING.
An-ting is situated south-west of Kan chou, 1500 li distant from that city. At the time of the Han dynasiy here the country was called Eh KHang.^^ In the T*ang period it belonged to the kingdom of T^u-fan (Tibet, v. p. 23). In the days of the Mongol dynasty An-ting was the appanage of a Mongol prince, Bu-yin THe-mu-rh, who had the title Ning wang.^^ This country was properly called Sa-li Wei-vm-rh (Sari-Uigur).^^^ It is about 1000 li
^^ Now-a-days the basin of the Kukenor lake and the mountainous regions in which the greatest rivers of China, the Huang ho and the Yang tsz', take their rise, are comprised by the Chinese in the general name Ts'ing hai or Azure Sea, which has the same meaning as Kukenor in Mongol. ^** Comp. History of the Anterior Han, chap. xcvi. The name Kiang in ancient times was applied to the tribes who lived in the Kukenor country and North-Eastern Tibet. 5'85 The title Ning toang was first bestowed, in 1306, upon Kubilai Khan's eighth son, K'uo-lcuo-cKu. See Yuan shi, chap, cvii., genealog. table. Bu-yin T'ieviu-rh, who ruled over An-ting when the Ming expelled the Mongols from China, seems to have been a descendant of that prince. ^^ I have not been able to find the name An-ting mentioned in the Yiian history, but the name Sa-li Wei-wu-rh occurs there once. Piano Carpini also mentions the Hari-Huiur. For further particulars see i. 263. I am not prepared to say whether the place Sari marked on our maps of Tibet, between 34° and 35° N. lat. and about 86° E. long., Sa-li of the Chinese maps, has anything to do with the Sari Uigurs.



2o6 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
in extent, borders to the east on Han-durij (see farther on), to the north on Sha chou, to the south on Si fan (Kukenor). There are no cities in this country. The people dwell in felt tonts and breed plenty of camels, horses, cattle, and sheep. In 1370 the emperor Hung wu sent an envoy to this country to make known the imperial manifestos, and in 1374, in the sixth month, Bu-yin T*ie-mu-rh sent one of his chief officers, by name Ma-fa-rh, and others to offer tribute to the Chinese court. They brought armour, swords, and products of their country. The emperor was much delighted, and received the embassy kindly. Subsequently a Chinese officer was despatched to An- ting, who divided the country into four, tribes (districts), namely, A-duan,
A-dJen, Jo-sien, and T'^ie-li.^^'^ The prince (Bu-yin T*iemu-rh) in the next year sent one of his officers to the Chinese court to offer the tablet of authority written with golden and silver letters which formerly had been granted to the prince by the Yuan. He begged the emperor to establish in his country two wei or military districts in An-ting and in A-duan; to which the emperor assented. He bestowed on Bu-yin T*ie-mu-rh the title vjang (prince), and to one of his officers, Sha-la, the military rank of ehi hui. In 1376 the emperor despatched an officer to An-ting with presents for the prince and his officers. In the next year the prince was killed by Sha-la, and his son perished likewise. A revolution broke out in the country. Do-rh-dji-ba, a general, revolted, withdrew to the Sha mo (desert), and from there appeared again to plunder Anting. He took also with him the imperial seal. In 1 392 the Chinese general Lang Yu with his host marched out westward (from Kan su, it seems), and advanced as far as the river A-djen. In 1396 the emperor sent one of his officers to set in order the affairs of An-ting, and to

I-pan-dan, a grandson of Bu-yin T'ie-mu-rh, who had retired to Ling-dsang^^ offered tribute to the emperor, who invested him with the title prince of An-ting. It happened in 1424 that Chinese envoys who had been sent to Wu-sz-dsang (Tibet) rested on the rivers Bi-lidju^^ and Huang yang clhian (Antelope river), wlien tliey were attacked by the troops of San-k'o and San-dsi-sz, the first being one of the chieftains in An-ting, the other a <;hi hui of K^il-sien. They robbed the embassy, killed the envoys, and lied. When the emperor heard of this violation of his authority, he became very angry, and sent out considerable forces under the command of Li Ying and K^ang Shou to pursue the rebels. Li Ying arrived at the K'^unlun mountains, and proceeding several hundred li westward, reached the country Ya-ling-k\co, where he met the rebels of An-ting and defeated them with great slaughter. But the rebels of K'il-sien had got wind and succeeded in hiding themselves. Li Ying then returned. In 1446 I-pan-dan died, and his son, Ling-djan-gansie-rhj succeeded him as prince of An-ting. He died in 1490, and was succeeded by his son, Tsien-hen. At that time the prince of Hami'had died without leaving a son. The Chinese government wished that Shan-ha, a descendant of a lateral branch of the princes of Hami, from which the princes of An-ting also derived their origin, should be placed on the throne of Hami. Shen-ba then was living in K'-ii-sien (see farther on). But Ts*ien-ben raised claims in favour of his brother. Nevertheless Shen-ba was elected prince of Hami. Under the reign of Cheng te, in 15 12, the Mongol chief I-hu-la T^ai ski, followed by the tribe A~rh-fo-sz\ conquered Tsing hai (Kukenor, -y. si^.^ra), and ravaged the

adjacent countries. Thus they destroyed also the principality of An-ting.
The name An-ting is not found on modern Chinese or European maps referring to the regions in question. Its position in ancient times can only be approximately determined from the particulars above translated. It was situated west of Kukenor, somewhere near the K*un-lun mountains. More than ten years ago-, the well-known traveller Captain H. Trotter, whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Peking, informed me that, according to the Pandits entrusted with the survey of Tibet, there is north-west of the Tenkiri lake, in the country where the Sokpo Kalmuks live, a famous monastery called Adjan. This name is known also to the Mongol Lamas in Peking. It may be that it is connected witli the district of the same name noticed in the Ming history.
THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF A-DUAN.
A-cluan is comprised in the country of Sa-li Wei-vm-rh (see note 986). As we shall see, the Ming shi notices farther on that A-duan borders east on Han-dung, north on Sha choio. In 1375 emperor Hung wu established here a military administration. Subsequently A-duan was plundered by Do-rh-dji-ha (see article An-ting). In 1406 the chief of A-duan, by name Siao-sie, and others, arrived at Peking to offer tribute, and solicited that the military administration in their country might be re-established. The emperor agreed, and bestowed upon Siao-sie and the other chiefs military ranks. In the reign of Hang hi (1425-26) the chief of K'li-sien, by name San-dsi-sz' (the same who had in 1424 robbed the Chinese envoys on their way to Tibet), induced one of the clii hui of A-duan, by name So-lu-dan, to unite with him for plundering once more a Chinese embassy. The



i5&i6cENT.] A-DUAN. 209
emperor sent a great host in their pursuit, but the Chinese were not able to lay hold of the robbers. They could only prohibit their returning to their countries. In 143 1 the emperor appointed Djen-dji-Jian to administer the military district of A-duan. Altliough his father had been implicated in the robbing of the Chinese envoys, and Djen-dji-han had accordingly retiied to the river Bi-li-dju, where the great highway to Wu-sz'dsang (Tibet) passes, the emperor had pardoned him, ami he had returned with his clan to their former seats in Tie-rh-gu. In this article on A-duan it is finally stated that there was a realm of the same name in the country of the Hui-hui (Mohammedans), distant one month's journey from T*ie-rh-gu.
As to the last-mentioned A-duan, it seems to me that here Khotan is meant, which in the Yiian shi is generally termed O-dican (v. supra). However, as we shall see farther on, the Ming shi treats of Khotan under its ancient Chinese name Yil-t^ien. But regarding the country A-duan, which properly forms the subject of this article, and which, according to the Chinese accounts, was originally comprised in the territory of Sa-li Wei-wu-rh, 1500 li south-west of Kan chou, I have little doubt that it must be looked for in the regions where the Yellow River takes its rise. In the Yiian shi, chap. Ixiii., we find a dissertation on the Sources
of the Yelloiu River. It is stated there that in 1280 Kubilai Khan despatched one of his high officers, Tu-shi^ to explore the sources of the Huang ho. Tu-shi ascertained that the sources of tliis river consist of more than a hundred lakelets or marshes, which, when looked upon from an elevated place, have the appearance of a constellation, wherefore this country is called 0-duan nao-rh, which is the same as Su sing hai in Chinese (starry sea). Odun in Mongol means " star," nor = lake. On modern Chinese p

maps the country from which the Yellow River issues is termed Odun tala (starry plain).
THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF K'U-SIEN.
It lies south-west of Su chou, and borders to the east on the district of An-ting. It is comprised in that country where anciently the Si Jung or Si K'iang of the Han period, or the T*^u-fan in tte days of the Tang dwelt.^^ The Yiian (Mongols) established here a military administration {yiian shi fu, properly " head-quarters "), called K^ii-sien da-lin. In the reign of the first Ming emperor, the chief of K'ii-sien arrived with tribute at the Chinese court. The rank of chi hui was bestowed upon him. A military administration was established at K*ii-sien. When Bo-rhdji-ha revolted {v. supra), the people of K'ii-sien were partly destroyed, and the rest annexed to the district of An-ting. They dwelt in the country called A-djen (v. supra). In 1406 K*u-sien was again separated from An-ting. The rank of chi hui was bestowed upon San-dsi, who had then charge of the district of K'ti-sien. San-dsi-sz' was
appointed his assistant, but' subsequently, at his request, was allowed to move and govern the country Lo-watighuai. Eighteen years later, San-dsi-sz', together with one of the chieftains of An-ting, attacked and plundered a Chinese embassy. A Chinese host marched out to punisli them (as has been related above), but was not able to seize San-dsi-sz', who, with his people, had hidden himself at a long distance. Subsequently he was pardoned by the emperor, who invited him even to return and to administer 42,000 tents (families). San-dsi-sz' then sent an embassy to thank the emperor, and offered camels and horses. In 1430 a Chinese envoy, who had returned from the Si yii (Western countries), reported that San-dsi-sz* again had

stopped and robbed envoys carrying tribute to the court, and that he had entirely shut up the passage. The emperor then became very angry, and ordered great forces to be sent in pursuit of the robbers. San-dsi-sz' succeeded in escaping before the Chinese arrived, but his companion, T^o-f'O'hu-hiia, was completely defeated and killed. At length San-dsi-sz* was again pardoned, sent an embassy to express his thanks, and then was allowed to return to his country, where he died in 1432. He was succeeded by his son, Du-li. In the reign of Ch'eng hua (1465-88), the T^u-lu-fan (people of Turfan) invaded and ravaged K*iisien. In the reign of Hung chi (1488-1506), Shan-ha, the son of the prince of An-ting, who lived in K'u-sien, was called to rule over Hami (v. supra). In 1 5 1 2 the great headman of the Menggu (Mongols), I-hu-la, followed by the tribe A-rh-fu-sz, after making himself master of Ts*ing hai (Kukenor), ravaged also K'u-sien, and destroyed the military administration there.

There are on the Chinese map two posts or stations, Ch'i-r/hin, viz., CUi-yhin hu t'ai (post at the lake Clii-ghin) and CUi-yhin hia t'ai (post at the defile of Ch'i-ghin). A river runs between these two posts connecting two lakes.

was here the district of Tun huang; ^^^ at the time of the Tsin the district of Chang kiln. In the Tang period this land belonged to Kita chou, and in the Mongol period to the circuit (Jii) of Ska chou. In A.D. 1380 the (Ming) general Pu ying, on his expedition westward, arrived at Po cJieng (White city), captured the Mongol commander Hu-du T^ie-mu-rh, then reached the post of Clii-ghin, and made I-lien-djen, prince of Fin,^^ and his people, consisting of fourteen hundred men, prisoners. He seized also the golden seal (granted by the Mongol emperors), and then returned.. Subsequently a Mongol tribe took again possession of Ch*i-ghin. There was a Mongol by name T''a-li-ni, the son of K^u-dju, an ancient (Mongol) minister., He lived at first in the country oi Ha-la-t^o, and in 1404 came with more than five hundred men to submit. He was appointed commander of a thousand, with an imperial seal in CKi-ghin, where a military post (su) was established. T*a-li-ni distinguished himself on several occasions in attacking and capturing rebels and robbers. The emperor in return advanced him
to the rank of chi hui tsien shi. In 14 10 this militarypost was raised to a wei (military district). In 141 1 T'ali-ni died, and his son Tsie-ivang-shi-ghia succeeded to
The stations Ckighin pu and Chighin kia appear in Colonel Matussowsky's itinerary (1 875). In 1879, August, the expedition of Count- B. Szechenyi passed by the same route from Kia yii kuan via Yii men hien. and An si to Sha chou. Lieutenant G. Kreitner, the diarist of this expedition ("Im Fernen Osten," p. 645), mentions the same stations, but write* the names erroneously Tscha tjen pu and Tscha ijcn hia. According tohim, Tscha tjen hia (or Chighin hia) is situated on a lovely oasis abounding in grass and water. There is a little lake, into which three mountain rivers discharge themselves. ^3 In the second century B.C. the Chinese established four districts in these regions at the north-western frontier, viz., Tsiu tsiian, Wu wei, Chang ye, and 2'un huang, the westernmost of these districts, situated west of Yii menkuan. ^^ According to the genealogical table of the Mongol dynasty (Yiian shi, chap, cvii.), the title princes of Pin had been bestowed upon some descendants of Hulagu, Ilkhan of Persia. In this table I-lien-dji Ba-ti appearsas a descendant of Hulagu in the fourth generation.

him. He presented tribute and received a Chinese rank. In 1436 it happened that one of his subjects, a military officer, had plundered an embassy proceeding from A-duan in the Si yii (Khotan, v. supra) with tribute to China, and even killed the envoy and twenty-one men of his suite. But he was punished at the demand of the emperor, and obliged to deliver the goods he had robbed. In 1440 a Chinese envoy who went to Hami passed through Ch'i-ghin. Ts*ie-wang-shi-ghia supplied him with provisions, mules, horses, and even gave him a convoy. In return the empe ror raised him in rank. In the next year it was reported to the emperor that a man belonging to Ts'ie-wang-shighia's tribe, but pretending to be a man from Sha chou, used to stop the envoys coming with tribute from the Si yil and plunder them. The emperor ordered the culprits to be punished. At that time the Wa-la had become powerful,^^ and frequently invaded the neighbouring countries. Ts'ie-wang-shi-ghia, who feared them, solicited from the emperor permission to retire to Su chou. But the emperor did not assent, promising to protect him. In 1443 Yesien, the chief of the Wa-la, sent an envoy with presents to Ch*i-ghin and asked Ts*ie-wang-shi-ghia's dauEjhter in marriasje for his son, and at the same time he asked a daughter of the chief of Sha chou as wife for his younger brother. But both refused, notwithstanding the emperor's advice to accept the proposition. In 1444 Ts*iewang-shi-ghia, who had grown old, retired, and his son A'SU took the administration of Ch*i-ghin, and was confirmed by the Chinese emperor. Ye-sien twice sent envoys to him to propose a marriage, but A-su refused. In 1448 it happened that Chinese troops, escorting an envoy to the prince of Hami, when resting in the city of K*u yil (see note 948), were attacked by the commander of the troops of Ch*i-ghin, who surrounded the city. But the Chinese made a sortie, defeated the rebels, and took

His son TVa sa-fa-rh succeeded him. He died in 147 1, and was succeeded by his son Shang-ho-fa-rh in the administration of Ch'i-ghin. In 1473 the Sic-t^an of T^u-lu-fan, having captured Hami, sent envoys to Ch!i-ghin with a letter to the commander of the troops there, inviting .him to attack China; but the commander put the envoys to death and sent the letter to the emperor. In 1482 Ch*i-ghin assisted Hanclien in retaking Hami (v. supra). In' 1483 the neighbouring tribe, Ye-mie-Uo-li (see note 941) invaded and plundered Ch*i-ghiii. Subsequently the Tu-lu-fan (Turfan) frequently ravaged this district, and finally destroyed the military station there in 15 13. The Chinese gov-eniment then removed the remains of the Mongol tribe of Ch*i-ghin t;o the southern mountains of Su chou. In 1528 they hardly numbered a thousand men. The Ming Geography enumerates the following natural productions in the district of Ch*i-ghin :

Camels,

and silver.

" Histoire des Ming," 177, translates the above name Tche-kin Moung-hou, according to the meaning of the Chinese characters, by " Mongols aux haches rouges." But Clii-ghin is without doubt a Mongol word, meaning " ear," frequently used in Mongol geographical appellations. Archimandrite Palladius, in his "M. Polo in N. China," observes that Ch*i-ghin is properly the name applied to two lakes there, the great and the little one. Kreitner, on the map appended to his narrative of Szechenyi's journey^ indeed places two lakes in the vicinity of Chighin.
THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF SHA CHOU.
Proceeding from Ch*i-ghin 2CX) li westward, one arrives at K^u yil (see note 948). From this place the way leads at first southward, then westward, and after advancing 190 li the traveller reaches Kua chou.^"^ Four hundred and forty li west of Kua chou lies Sha chou.^^ At the time of the Han here was the district of Tun hv/in^, situated at the border of the Si yii, opposite and not far from the two fortresses Yii men kuan and Yang kuan.^^
^^ On the great Chinese map "Ancient Kua chou" appears about 190 li north-west of K'u yii, 100 li east of Tun huang hien (Sha chou), south of the road which leads from this city to An si chou. Kua chou was founded in the beginning of the T'ang period, A.D. 622. Lieutenant Kreitner, who accompanied Count B. Szechenyi on his expedition to Tibet in 1879, visited the ruins of Kua chou (** Im Fernen Osten," 673, 676). It was a large and populous city till about 1 869, when it was destroyed by the Mohammedan rebels. The site assigned to this place on the Chinese map seems to be correct. ®^ There is evidently a mistake in the figures. Przewalsky ("Tibet,'* 93) visited Sha chou in June 1879. He states that Sha chou is also called Tun huang. Lieutenant Kreitner, who reached Tun huang hicn in the same year a few months earlier, states that the ruins of ancient Sha chou are situated opposite modern Tun huang, between the left bank of the Tan river and its branches ("Im Fernen Osten," p. 658, Peterm. "Geogr. Mitth.," 1882, p. 418). The Chinese map, however, locates "Ancient

Shachou was founded under the Wei dynasty (386-558).^^^ During the T^ang dynasty the name was not changed. Subsequently the T^u-fan (Tibetans) took possession of Sha chou. In the days of the Sung Sha chou belonged to the Si Hia (Tangut empire). In the Mongol period there was a circuit (department) Sha chou lu. The history of Sha chou during the Ming period, as related in the Ming shi, has a gre^t resemblance to what has been recorded with reSpect to the afore-mentioned districts. When the Ming established their power in China, Sha chou was, like Ch*i-ghin, in the possession of a Mongol tribe. In 1404 two of the chieftains of Sha chou, K^un-dsi-lai and Mai'dju, came in person to submit to the emperor, who ordered to establish at Sha chou a military district, and put at the head of it the aforesaid chieftains, bestowing on them the ranks of chi hui shi. Mai-dju died in 1410, and then K*un-dsi-lai alone administered Sha chou. In 1424 it happened that an envoy of T^ai ping, prince of the Wa-la (Oirats, v. supra), on his way to the Chinese court found the passage barred by robbers, when K'un-dsi-lai gave him an escort. The latter was accordingly rewarded by the emperor. In 1425 envoys from I-li-ha-li (Moghu
men kuan stood on the same place where now-a-days the city of Yii men hien lies ; the site of Yang kuan was, according to the Chinese authors, 1 30 li south-west of Tun huang. 1000 The Ming shi is wrong. As I have stated above, the name of Sha chou dates from the year a.b. 622. According to the Geography of the Yuan dynasty (quoted in the Ming Geography), the name of Sha chou is derived from the Ming sha shan, the rumbling sandhill near that place. The description of Tun huang hien states that the sand rolling down the hill produces a particular sound similar to that of distant thunder. Compare also about Sha chou, p. 18, and with respect to the rumbling sandhill, the report of a Chinese envoy of the tenth century, translated by Remusat in his "Ville de Khotan," p. 77. According to this traveller, the rumbling sands producing sounds similar to those of thunder are ten li south of Kua chou. See also in Yule's "Cathay," p. 156, ccxliv., about the Friar Odoric's account of the sandy hill in Tartary, on which he heard the sounds of invisible drums.

In 1426 K'undsi-lai's people were suffering from .dearth, and he sent an envoy to China to solicit a loan of corn, promising the restitution in autumn. The emperor, complying with this request, said : " I consider you foreigners also my subjects, and therefore do not require the restitution." The emperor despatched also one of his eunuchs to Sha chou to bestow presents on K'un-dsi-lai. In 1432 there was again dearth in Sha chou, and the emperor consented to relieve the people with corn supplied from Su chou. In the same year the envoys from Ha-lic (Herat), who had carried tribute to the court, complained that they had been plundered on their way in the district of Sha chou by Go-yu^ the chi hui of Ch*i-ghin. K*un-dsi-lai then received orders to inquire into this matter. In 1434 K'un-dsi-lai sent an envoy to the court complaining that the district of Sha chou was frequently plundered by robbers from Si fan (Tangut), who robbed men and cattle ; and as he was not able to resist them, he solicited permission to withdraw and settle with his people at the ancient city of CKa-tian. But the emperor did not agree, saying : " You have been living in Sha chou for more than thirty years ; your people breed plenty of cattle and liorses and have become wealthy; your arguments have no foundation." But in the next year, 1435, Sha chou was plundered by the people of Hami, and as K'un-dsi-lai feared also the Wa-la, he decided to abandon Sha chou, nnd with 200 followers presented himself at the Chinese frontier in a state of extreme penury. The Chinese governor at the frontier supplied them with corn, and proposed to the emperor to establish K*un-dsi-lai at K^u yii. One part of his tribe had emigiated to Hami. Subsequently the chi hui of Han-dung (see fartlier on) established himself in the district of Sha chou, but he was expelled by the chi hui of Clii-ghin. In 1440 the emperor ordered



2i8 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
the Chinese governor at the frontier to rebuild the city of K'u-yic with the assistance of Chinese soldiers. In the winter of 144 1 the work was finished. K*un-dsi-lai sent an envoy with presents to thank the emperor. In 1442 he died. His eldest son, Nan-Uo, with two younger brothers, went to the Chinese court to offer tribute. Nan-k*o received the rank of tu tu tsien shi and returned. Subsequently a great number of Nan-k'o's people made preparations for emigrating to the Wa-la, but the Chinese government succeeded in good time in stopping the emigration, and in 1446 they transferred the whole tribe from Sha chou, more than 200 families, numbering more than 1230 men, to China, to the district of Kan chou. The city of Sha chou was abandoned by the Chinese, and Baiima-sz\ the chief of Han-dung, took possession of it. The brother of Nan-k*o, by name So-nan-hen, was not willing to obey the Chinese government, and surrendered to Ye-sien, the chief of the Wa-la. But the Chinese, who had been informed that So-nan-ben lived in Han-dung, succeeded in capturing him. It had been proposed to execute him, but on account of the merits of his father and brother the emperor pardoned him. He was sent to Tung cKang (in the province of Shan tung).
THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF HAN-DUNQ,
It is situated south of Ch*i-ghin and south-west of Kia yli kuan. It lies also in the land which in the days of the Han constituted the district of Tun huang. In 1 392 a general of the Ming, when pursuing robbers,
arrived in the country of Han-dung. A great number of the people living there fled and hid themselves. But subsequently they returned, and in 1397 the chief of the
tribe, by name So-nan-ghi-la-sz', sent an envoy with tribute to the Chinese court. The emperor then ordered a militaiy administration in Han-dung to be established. As I do not wish to fatigue the reader further by



i5&i6cENT.] HAN-DUNG—HA-MEI-LI. 219
records of embassies sent to the Chinese court, of predatory excursions, and of the plundering of embassies, I may briefly state with respect to the history of Handung that it resembles much the histories of the aforementioned military districts. Han-dung was also ruled by native chiefs who had Chinese rank. The troops of Han-dung, numbering 3000 men, assisted China in the war with Turfan. In the bes^innincr of the sixteenth century the Mongols began to oppress the people of Handung. The Mongols at that time had taken possession of Tsing hai (Kukenor). At length the Chinese government transferred the whole tribe of Han-dung to Kan chou.
THE MILITARY DISTRICT HAN-DDNQ THE LEFT.i«>i
This is the same as ancient Sha chou. There had been a discord among the people of Han-dung, and one part of them, conducted by An-chang, had settled on the territory of Sha chou, after this district had been abandoned by ICun-dsi-lai {y. supra). After An-chang's death his son Ban-mu-sz was put at the head of the tribe. He was suspected by the Chinese government of acting in collusion M'ith Ye-sien, chief of the Wa-la. He died in the reign of Ch*eng hua (1465-88), and was succeeded by his grandson, Dji-Uo. In 1479 the Chinese government established at the ancient city of Sha chou the military administration of Han-dung the left. Dji-k*o then was placed at the head of it. At length the Sultan of Turfan took possession
of this district.
THE COUNTRY OF HA-MEI-LI.
This country is not far from the district of Kan su. The prince Wu-na-shi-li, a relative of the Yiian (the Mongol house reigning in China), was living there when
1001 -phe Chinese character Uo, the left side, is commonly used for the east, but in this case it seems west is intended, for Han-dung, according to this account, lay south of Ch'i-ghin, and Han-dung the left or Sha chou must have been west of it.



220 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
tliat dynasty was overthrown by the Ming. In 1380 the Chinese general Fit Ying, who exercised his troops in Si Hang (present Liang choii fu in Kan su), solicited from the emperor permission to move out with his troops and take possession of the country of Ha-mei-li, in order to open through it a commercial route. The emperor agreed, but advised Pu Ying to be cautious. When Wu-na-shi-li had heard of the general's marching out, he offered his submission, and in the next year despatched the Mohammedan A-lao-ding (Alaeddin) with tribute to the Chinese court. The emperor rewarded him, and sent an officer to the country of the Wei-wu-rh (Uigurs) ^^^ to make known to the foreigners his manifestos. In 1390 the emperor was informed that Wu-na-shi-li frequently disturbed the adjacent districts, and used to stop the caravans of the Mohammedans in the Si yii when passing through his territory, and even when they went by another way he plundered and killed the envoys. The emperor grew very angry, and ordered the commander of the troops in Kan su and another general to punish Wuna-shi-li. The Chinese forces marched out from Si Hang, proceeded westward, and in the night arrived at the city of Ha-mei-li, which they surrounded. One of Wu-na-shi-li's officers came out to surrender. The next morning Wu-nashi-li ordered more than 300 horses to be driven out from the city, and whilst the Chinese were hunting after the horses, he himself, with his family, succeeded in escaping. The Chinese captured his city. Bie-rh-Uie T'^ie-imt-rh, the prince of Fin}^^^ and 1400 men were killed. The son of the prince and 1730 men were made prisoners. The golden and silver seals (bestowed formerly upon the prince by the Mongols) fell also into the hands of the Chinese.

part of Tibet, and then refers to some kingdoms of India which had political intercourse with China.
WU-SZ'-DSANG (TIBET).
We have seen (v. p. 24) that already in the Yiian history Tibet is sometimes designated by this name, which seems to be a corruption of the joined names of the two provinces U and Tsang. The Ming shi states that Wu-sz'-dsang lies west of the border of the province of Yiin nan, and is more than 1000 li distant from the city of Li kiang fu, 1500 U I'rom Ma-hu-fu in Sz' ch'uan, 5000 li from SI ning in Shen si.^^^ Besides the successors of Ba-sz'-ba, whom Kubilai Khan had constituted chief Lama of Tibet (and who had their residences, it seems, at Lhassa), the Ming shi mentions seven other heads of the Lamait Church in Tibet. In the beginning of the fifteenth century the Chinese emperor bestowed upon them Chinese titles.^^^^
A-NAN-GUNG-DE, A KINGDOM IN SI TIEN.^^^
In 1374 Bu-ha-lu, the ruler of this country, sent his chief explainer (kiang chu)^ by name Bi-ni-si, with tribute to the Chinese court. He brought, among other things, a stone which had the property of neutralising poison.
1004 The distances seem to refer to Lhassa, the capital of Tibet. 1006 I'or further particulars on the subject see Klaproth's " Magazin Asiatique," ii. 213. Klaproth translates the article Si dsang (the modern Chinese name for Tibet, Western Dsang), found in the Great Geography of the present dynasty. 1"** Si t'ien (Western Heaven) is a Chinese name applied to India in some Chinese translations of Buddhist works. A-nan-f/un(/-de sounds like Annagoondy, which, according to W. Hamilton ('• East India Gazetteer," 1828), is the name by which the Canarese designated the celebrated city of Bijanagur, founded in 1336 on the Toombuddra river, on the right bank of which the ruins of it can still be seen. Opposite, on the left bank, are the vast ruins to which the name of Annagoondy is usually applied. About 15° 20' N. lat. In 1443 Shah Roksent an embassy to the king of Bijanagur. See "India in the Fifteenth Century," by Major, 1857, Hakluyt Socitty.



222 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
After this no embassy from that country was seen in China. That is all the Ming shi records with respect to this Indian kingdom.
At the end of the short record of the embassy from A-nan-gung-de the Ming history notices also an embassy sent to the Chinese court by the Jcuo shi ^^'' Do-rh-dji Uielie-shi sz-ha dsang-hu of Ho-lin. This embassy reached the Chinese capital at the same time as that from A-nangung-de. Tiie annalist explains that Ho-lin is the name 01 the capital of T''ai tsu, the first Mongol emperor.^^* The kuo shi had despatched his kiang chu (chief explainer), by name Ju-nu-wang-shu, to present to the emperor a
Buddha's statue of copper, sacred relics, white cloth called
ha-dan, one seal of jade, four seals of gold, five of silver, three tablets of authority with golden letters ; all these things having been bestowed upon the kuo shi in former times by the Mongol emperors. The emperor received the envoy kindly. In the next year the kuo shi of Ho-lin once more sent presents, a Buddha's statue, relics, and two horses. The emperor bestowed upon the envoy a
priest's robe of silk.
NI-BA-LA, A KINGDOM OF SI TIEN (INDIA).
Ni-ha-la is situated west of chu Dsang (literally the whole Dsang or Tibet), and quite far from China. The rulers of this country are Buddhist monks. In 1384 the emperor Hung wu despatched a Buddhist monk thither with an imperial rescript and presents. This envoy visited also the adjacent kingdom of Di-yunj-fa. The king of Ni-ba-la, by name Ma-da-na lo-mo, then sent in return an embassy to the emperor to present a Buddha's
^°^^ Kuo shi, or *' teacher of the empire," was a title given by the Mongol emperors to the chief lamas. The Ming annalist explains the term by fcm seng, or Tibetan luma. io«8 The Ming shi is wrong, for Ho-lin or Kai akorum was only founded by Chinghiz' successor Ogotai in 1235.

statue of gold, five horses, &c. This embassy reached the Chinese capital in 1387. Three years later another embassy from the same country arrived, .and the emperor Yung lo subsequently again sent envoys to Ni-ba-la. At that time the name of the ruler of Ni-ba-la was Sha-gosin-di, and that of the ruler of Di-yung t*a was K'^o-ban, In 1418 the emperor Yung lo despatched one of his eunuchs to Ni-ba-la, and on his way thither this envoy passed, through Han-dung, Ling-dsang, Bi-li-gung-wa, Wusz-dsang (Lhassa), and Ye-lan-hu-na}^^^ The kingdom of Ni-ba-la of the Ming historians seems to be Nepal. It is mentioned much earlier in the Chinese annals. The T*ang History records several embassies from Ni-po-lo to the Chinese court in the seventh century. The first arrived in 647. A few years earlier the Chinese Buddhist monk Htian tsang had visited this kingdom (Beal's " Si yu ki," ii. 82). The early Chinese accounts of Nepal have been translated by A. K^musat in his " Nouv. M^l. Asiat.," vol. i. The Ming shi gives the names of two kings of Nepal who reigned towards the end of the fourteenth century, viz., Madana lomo and Shagosindi. Wright, in his " History of Nepal," 1877, P- 178-180, mentions for the same period Mali sinha deva and Sakti sinha deva, who successively reigned there. Shyama sinha deva, the son of Sakti, is stated to have sent presents to China, which so pleased the emperor that he sent in return a seal with the name Sakti sinha engraved on it, and in addition the
title of Rama.
THE KINGDOM OF SU-DU-SUNG-DJO.
This is a kingdom of Si fang (literally Western Eegion, another Chinese name for India, which occurs

1006). The emperor Yung lo in 1405 despatched an envoy to that country ; but owing to tlie great distance, no embassy from there was seen in China.
After this the Ming shi treats again, in the same chapter, of some districts situated apparently in Tibet.
This place (or country) is stated to be situated beyond Sz' ch*uan. It borders on the south with Wu-sz' dsang. The Yuan (Mongol dynasty) first established a military administration in Do-gan. I omit the details on the history of Do-gan.
THE SUAN WEI SZ'ion OF CHANG HO SI, YU TUNG,

These districts were all situated beyond Sz' ch*uan in Tibet. These names (Chinese names) occur already in the Yiian History. The Mongols first established a military administration there. I omit the details.

These districts are stated to lie west of Wei chou in Sz* ch*uan. (Wei chou of the Ming period answers nearly the present Wen cKuan Men.)

BIE-SHI-BA-LI (BISHBALIK, MOGHULISTAN, JETES).wi3
Bie-shi-ha-li is a great empire in the Si yu (countries of the West). It is bordered on the south by YU-tHen
1018 There can be no doubt that by Bie-shi-ha-li or Bishbalik (the name of the empire was subsequently changed into I-li-ba-li or Ilibalik) the Chinese from the end of the fourteenth to the sixteentli century understood the eastern part of the so-called " Middle Empire," assigned originally to Chinghiz Khan's second son, Chagatai, As can be proved by comparative investigations, Bie-shi-ba-li of the Ming History is the same as the empire of the Jeies or Getes of the Mohammedan chroniclers treating of the same period. It was known in the west also under the name of Moghulistan (not to be confounded with the country occupied by the true Mongols to the eastward). Timur, in his Autobiography (Stewart's transl., 46, Ji,), terms this empire Desht Jitteh (desht means desert), and considers the Jitteh his countrymen. Thus they were the followers of the descendants of Chinghiz. As can be concluded from the Mohammedan records, the empire of the Jetes embraced in the days of Timur the present Dsungaria, with Hi and the greater part of Eastern and Western Turkestan. I am not prepared to give any satisfactory explanation of the origin of the names Jetes, Jitteh, or Getes, as some orientalists write it. It is certain that it was unknown to the Persian authors before Timur's time, and it disappears again in the authors posterior to the first half of the fifteenth century. Sherif-eddin, the author of the Zafer nameh, records in detail the expeditions undertaken by Timur against the Jetes in Moghulistan, as does also Arab Shah. Abder-Razzak ( + 1483), who wrote the history of Shah Rok, mentions the Jetes 8. a. 1 425. Some orientalists, in the first place De Guignes, have tried to derive the name of the Jetes from that of the Yue-ti, a nation mentioned in the Chinese annals since the second century B.C., and the GetcB and Massagetce of the classical authors. It has also been made a question whether the Jats, so widely extended over the Pendjab, on the banks of the Indus, and in other parts of India, belong to the same race as the Jetes in Central Asia. See Vivien de St. Martin's interesting investigations on the subject at the end of his treatise, " Les Huns Blancs,'* 1849. In order to corroborate the Chinese records regarding Bie-shi-ba-li, I may put here together what I have been able to gather from various sources with respect to the history of Moghulistan and the Jetes. My information is derived from the Tarikhi Rashidi, transl. by Erskine (v. p. 150) ; from Khondemir's Habib essiier, transl. by Defremery {v. p. 150); Q

Compare also Colonel Yule's able notes on the subject in his "Cathay," 522. The immediate successors of Chagatai continued to reside chiefly in the desert. But within a century of Chagatai's death it had become much the cusitom for the Khans of the Middle Empire to take up their residence in the rich and populous country of Maverannahar. In this period a division of the Middle Empire had taken, place, and two separate Khans governed, the one in Maverannahar, the other in the country of tlie Moghuls and Kashgar. This division existed already in 1 32 1, for the Mohammedan chroniclers tell us that in this year II kkoclja, called also Isan Buka, who reigned in Maverannahar, wits called by the inhabitants of Kashgar, Yarkend, Alatagh, and Uiguristan, who found none among them of the posterity of Chagatai who might fill the throne which was then vacant (Abnl Ghazi, p. 165). Maverannahar continued to have its proper Khans, who, however, were entirely in the hands of their ministers, the amyrs, until at length the great Timur set himself upon the throne of Maverannahar in 1370. Isan Buka seems to have reigned in Moghulistan till about 1330, when he died. After a long interregnum, in 1347 his son Tugldak Timur ascended the throne, 1347-63. Some years after his accession he became a convert to the Musulman faith. Tughlak Timur owed the throne to the Amyr Yuladji, of the powerful family of Daghlat, who then was hereditary ruler of Kashgar under the Moghul Khans, a man of great influence. Tughlak Timur twice, in 1360 and 1 362, invaded and overran Maverannahar, where he established his son Elias Khodja. On the death of Yuladji he bestowed the father's office on his son Amyr Khodaidad, then only seven years old. Against this nomination Kamar-cddin, a younger brother of Yuladji, remonstrated, claiming the office (at Kashgar) as belonging of right to himself. But the Khan persisted in supporting Kliodaidad.
£lias Khodja Khan, 1363-65.— He was in Samarkand when his father,
died, where he was opposed by the chiefs of the country, headed by Amyr Husein, and by the illustrious Amyr Timur, wiio at length defeated hioi, and Elias was compelled to return to his paternal dominions in the desert of Jeteh, where after a short reign he was assassinated by Kamar-eddin.
Kamar-tddln, 1365-89, the usurper. —After putting to death eighteen males of the family of Elias, he assumed the title of Khan and the government of the country. But many of the Moghul tribes refused to acknowledge him. Timur, in his Autobiography, 148, suh anno 1 373, calls him only " the slave and commander-in-chief of the Jetes.
"
Timur was engaged in war with his eastern neighbours, the Jetes, during almost the whole time of his reign. In 1370 or 1 37 1 the Jetes advanced towards Maverannahar. Timur, at

the head of a numerous army, marched out from Samarkand, and advanced rapidly as far as Nekah. When he had reached Sairam and Penki, the Jetes fled. He went as far as Senghizi Ayadje, taking great booty, at length arrived at Acban Kuzy, and returned to Samarkand (Zafer nameh,
ii. 8).
In 1375, in January, Timur marched out from Samarkand against Kaniar-eddin, who had advanced to invade Maveranuahar. When Timur's avant-guard had reached beyond Sairam and arrived at Jarun, they learned that Kamar-eddin was encamped at Ghcuk tupa (near the Hi river ; see note 803). Timur's son, Jehanghir, went to beat up his camp ; Kamar-eddin, however, sought refuge in a mountain pass called Birkc Ghurian, but on Timur's arrival fled again. Amyr Hussein, one of Timur's generals, having been drowned in the river Ah lie (Hi), Jehangir pursued Kamar-eddin through a country which was full of trees and caves. Then his troops devastated the district of the Jetes called Uch-Ferman (pronounced Uch Turfan, west of Aksu). Kamar-eddin again escaped. Timur stayed fiftythree days at Baitak (written also Baj/ak). Among the prisoners taken there was the wife of Kamar-eddin and his daughter Dilshad Aga, whom Timur subsequently took as his wife. Timur leaving the camp, proceeded to the mountain of Karakasmak {Shemak in the Autobiography), where he met his son Jeliangir. From there they marched to Athashi [v. p. 50), and reached the beautiful plains of Arpaiazi {Azbehhary in the Autobiography), where Timur passed two pleasant months in the season of spring.* After this Timur returned to Samarkand by way of Yassi daban and Uzkend (Zafer nameh, ii. 14). In 1376 Timur sent the Amirs Bar Bugha, Adil Shah, and others with 30,000 horse into the country of the Jetes against Kamar-eddin ; but these Amirs revolted and marched towards Samarkand, which they besieged. Timur, who was then on an expedition to Kharezm, returned. His son Jehangir had already defeated the rebels, who fled for refuge to Urus, Khan of Kipchak, and subsequently joined Kamar-eddin, whom they persuaded to join them in making war upon Timur. They proceeded to invade Andedjan (Ferghana), and compelled Timur's son Omar Sheikh, who was governor there, to retreat. Timur then immediately marched against the enemy, who fled. When Timur had reached the village of Atbashi {v. supra), accompanied only by 200 men, Kamar-eddin, who had remained in ambuscade, briskly sallied out and fell upon Timur. But he was repulsed, and when Timur's army arrived, they pursued Kamar-eddin, and defeated him at Sengheziyadge. Not being able to seize him, Timur returned to Samarkand (Zafer nameh, ii. 16-18). Sar Bugha and Adil Shah, who had deserted from Timur, having wandered for two years among the mountains of Karachuk [Karatau chain

When they arrived at Otrar, Sar Bugha surrendered, but Adil Shah, being alarmed, fled again and took refuge at Aksuma, which is the name of a tower built on the top of the mount Karachuk, a place designed for a guard to the country, because one may observe from there what is done in the plains of Kipchak. But Timur went into the mountain in search of this rebel, who was seized and put to death. Sar Bugha was pardoned, and served as guide in the campaign against the Jetes (Zafer
nameh, ii. 19).
Timur ordered his son Omar Sheikh to march against Kamar-eddin directly, whilst Ketai Bahadur should make a detour and get in the rear of the enemy's camp. Omar Sheikh with the main body reached the plain of Kkuratu, where Kamar-eddin was encamped, and defeated him. But Kamar eddin again succeeded in escaping. Ketai having plundered the country of the Jetes, rejoined the prince and they returned to Samarkand. The troops were no sooner upon their return than Timur resolved to march in person into the country of the Jetes. His avant-guard marched day and night, and then came upon Kamar-eddin at Bwjani AsighevZ (Issikul ?), where they put him to flight after a furious battle, and then ravaged the country. Timur afterwards pursued Kamar-eddin as far as Kuchar (Zafer nameh, ii. 20). In 1383 the Zafer nameh (ii. 42) records another expedition sent by Timur against Kamar-eddin. His generals proceeded by Atakum and Behririy arrived at Issigheul (Issikul), and advanced as far as Gheuktopa in search of Kamar-eddin. Not being able to find him, they returned in autumn to Samarkand (Zafer nameh, ii. 42). Khizer Khodja Khan of Moghulistan, 1389-99.—He was the son of Toghlak Timur. When Kamar-eddin put to death the family of the Khans, he was still at the breast. Aided by his mother, the Amyr Khodaidad {v. supra) had concealed this child in Kashgar. The boy when twelve years old was conveyed to the hill country between Kashgar and Badakhshan, then to the hills of Khotan, and finally to Sarigh- Uigur {v, i. 263) and Lob Kanik, far in the east, where he remained for twelve years
more. When Kamar-eddin's power was on the decline, the young man was brought back and raised tf> the Khanship by Amir Khodaidad under the style of Khizer Khodja. He contended bravely against Timur in the field. The Zafer nameh (iii. 5) reports under the year 1389 (the year of Khizer Khodja's accession) an expedition undertaken by Timur to Moghulistan Timur had just defeated the army of Toktamish of Kipchak near the Sihun, when he resolved to march thence directly into Moghulistan. The army was divided into two bodies. Mirza Omar Sheikh was sent one way, Timur with the other body proceeded to KarogucJiar, where he encamped. Omar Sheikh defeated the enemy in the plain called Ichmas AlaghcuZ

^Alakul lake ?). Timnr sent two of his generals in search of the enemy. They marched day and night and arrived at the river Irtysh. They took a great many prisoners, and returned with the spoils to the royal camp. Timur then passed the great desert, and after many days' journey arrived at Aimal guju (on the Emil river (?) ; see note 818), and lodged in the palace Serai Urd<im (Serai ordo). Here a general council was held, and it was decided to ravage the country of the Jetes in various directions. The army was divided into several bodies. The road each body had to take was set down in written memoirs. The country of Yulduz was designated as rally ing-point. The prince Omar Sheikh crossed the mountain Dubeskin Andur and arrived at Kara koja, which is three months' journey from Samarkand by the caravan {v. p. 186). Another body, commanded by the Amir Jehan shah and Sheikh Ali, went to Kara art and Shuragluk. Another body, commanded by Osman Abbas, passed by Saghizgan, Sugulgan, Liglv^wd Gcvcyar. Khodaidad Huseini and Mobasher Bahadur, at the head of another body, went by Urichu to Bikut, where they defeated the hordes of Bulgagi and Ilker. Timur himself proceeded by the road of Oluk kid, and having ascended the mountain Sichkan daiban, met those Bulgagis and defeated them. The Amirs Yadghiar Berlas and Soliman Shah, who had been left in Western Turkestan, between Jete and Kipchak, when Timur invaded the latter country, received also orders to march into Moghulistan. They came to the mountain Urdaban, crossed the river yl6 Kile (Hi river), and arrived at Sutgheul {the Sairam lake, see note 476), and at length at Chichekiik. From there they went to Balaikan, and where.soever they met enemies they destroyed them. When they came to Molzudu they met Khizer Khodja, Khan of -Moghulistan, at the head of a great army, and attacked him. The fight lasted two days, when the battle was finished by a treaty, according to which the Amirs departed with their troops towards Yulduz, the general rendezvous. Timur having passed by Keitu and Konghez* arrived at Yulduz. Having heard the report about the battle with Khizer Khodja, he marched quickly, following the track of the Moghul Khan. He crossed the river at Ulakianaor, passed the great •desert, and arrived at Kara bulak. From there he went to Tebertash, and coming to Kushon kai, he discovered the enemy's army, who however fled, favoured by the darkness of the night. Timur having passed the mountain Nairin KeuteL pursued the enemy as far as Karatash. Then Khizer Khodja abandoned his kingdom to save his life. In the meanwhile the other bodies of Timur's army terribly ravaged the country of the Jetes, and gave no quarter to any one of the inhabitants of that country. They advanced as far as Kulan KeuPl, took possession of an infinite number of horses, camels, and sheep, and made abundance of slaves. When the victorious Timur came to Jalish, all the immense booty was divided among the soldiers (Jalish is the same as Kharashar, v. p. 200).

Timnr arrived at Yulduz, where he encamped. The Amirs and the several bodies of the army who had ravaged all the quarters of Moghulistan and destroyed the Jetes, came to this place, laden with spoils. The Zafer nameh adds that Yulduz is a place of great delight and pleasure ; the many delicious fountains and abundance of pasture render the living therein very agreeable. The beauty of its fountains is the reason of its name, for Yulduz means " the Morning Star." The grass there is sostrong and nourishing, that the leanest- horses, when they have been a week in its meadows, become fat and strong.* From thence Timur sent Mirza Omar Sheikh to his government of Aru/edjan (Ferghana), ordering him to pass by the way of Kaluga (Iroa gate). When he had passed this defile he met the prince Kublik, one of the great Amirs of the Jetes, defeated him and cut his head off. Th& prince Omar then continued his road by Kusan (Kucha), Uch ferman (Uch Turfan), and the great city of Kashgar, and at length successfully arrived at Andedjan, his residence. Timur then resolved to return to Samarkand. He departed from Kechik Yulduz (Little Yulduz) at the head of his army, and when he had arrived at Olug Yulduz (Great Yulduz), he appointed a solemn feast and a magnificent entertainment. They passed several days in this joyful manner. On the loth of August 1389 Timur departed, and made suchexpedition that he arrived at Samarkand on the 31st, although the distance is generally accounted two months' journey by the caravan (Zafer nameh, iii. 5-7). At that time Kamar-eddin was still alive. It seems that after the flight of Khizer Khodja and the returning home of Timur's army, he had again established his power in Moghulistan. In 1390 Timur was obliged to send once more a vast army against this usurper. This army was commanded by Soliman Shah, Khodaidad Huseini, Shamseddin Abbas, and other generals. Having crossed the Sihun at Tashkend, they marched to Issigheul (Issikul lake), where they met 5000 men sent from Andedjan by Mirza Omar Sheikh, who joined them. When they arrived at Gheuk topa (v. p. 227), they stayed some days to inform themselves of the state of the enemy, and then took the road to the mountain Arjatu, and advanced as
* It is impossible to venture on any identification of most of the places, mountains, &c., mentioned in the above itineraries of Timur's expedition into Moghulistan, for the tracts to which they refer are still very imperfectly known. We can, however, ascertain the position of Yuldtiz. which Litter name appears also in the itinerary of Shah Rok's embassy to China in 1420 (Yule's " Cathay," cc). We knew for a long time from Chinese maps that there is a mounttiin Yulduz or DjiUduz north-west of Kharashar, and a river of the same name. Przewalsky was the first European who visited this part of the T'ien shan in 1877. He states that Yuldv.z is the name of au elevated plateau, covered with luxuriant herbage and abounding in water. It is celebrated throughout Central Asia for its beauty, its springs, meadows, and fine breezes. It is the promised land of cattle. See Trzewalsky's " Ti-avels from Kuldja to Lobnor," p. 42, 21. According to Pi zowalsky, the Yulduz consists of two parts ; th» western pan is called the Great Yulduz, the ea>tern the Little Yulduz.

far as Almalegk, where, having swam over the river Ab EUe (Hi), they advanced to KarataL, a horde of Ankatura (a prince of the Jetes), where they learnt that their avant-guard of 400 horse had fallen in with Kamar-eddin in a hunting country and had been defeated. The Amirs then sent several of their captains to the field of battle, where they received intelligence that Kamar-eddin had marched towards the field oi Ichna Buchna. The Amirs immediately departed in search of the enemy, and having passed by Ichna Buchna, they arrived at U/>er Keptadji, where they left their baggage and departed thence towards the Irtish. When they had reached the banks of this river, they learnt that Karaar-eddin had crossed it and was gone towards Taulas in the woods, where sables and ermines are said to be found. They saw the rafts and boats the enemy had built to cross the water. The Amirs stayed some days at this place, and then crossed the river and burnt with their arms, made red-hot. characters on the pine trees there, that succeeding ages might see the marks of the arrival of Timur's army beyond the Irtish. But as six months had passed since they came into these wildernesses, where they wanted provisions, and most of them were living on what they got bv hunting and on wild roots, and as the air became extremely cold, they resolved to return, which they did by Altun Kdurke, where there is a road made on the banks of the great lake called Etrak gheul ; and making great haste, they happily arrived at Samarkand (Zafer nameh, iii. 9>. This is the last time that Kamar-eddin is made mention of in the Zafer nameh. According to Erskine's sources, he perished, worn out with fatigue and disease, in a wild corner of the desert, where he had concealed himself, accompanied by only two attendants, in about 1393. As to Khizer Khodja Khan, he -finally made peace with Timur, and this pacification he consolidated by giving to the conqueror his daughter Tukel Khanum in marriage. This happened, according to the Zafer nameh (iii. 69, 70), in 1397. The same work reports (v. 4) that in 1399, when Tinmr was in Karabagh (between the rivers Kur and Araxes), he received the news that Khizer Khodja, king of the Jetes, had paid the tribute to the Angel Israel, and that after his death dis.'^ensions arose among his four sons, Sliama Jehan, Mohammed, Shir Alt, and Shah Jehan. The same day they also heard that Mirza Eskender, spn of M. Omar Sheikh, had availed himself of this favourable opportunity. Eskender, then only fifteen years old, and entrusted by his grandfather with the government of Andedjan (Ferghana), had got together the troops of this province, and, accompanied by the Amirs, had boldly entered the lands of the Moghuls. They advanced to Kashjar, and pillaged and ravaged the town of Yarkand. Then they marched to Sarek Kamish* Kdapin,f Alir/heul, Yar kurgan, Chartak, and Keiuk Bagh, which places they likewise pillaged.

They at length arrived in the province of Audje in Moghulistan. All the people submitted. They then laid siege to the citadel of Aksu. It consists of three castles, which have a communication with one another, and is considered so strong that the inhabitants of all the neighbouring provinces consider it as a safe asylum in time of war. The Mirza soon encamped with his Amirs without the place, and being prepared to attack it vigorously with instruments for sapping the walls, scaling-ladders, battering-rams, and other machines, he caused several assaults to be made for nearly forty days, when the "besieged were obliged to surrender. Several very rich Chinese went out of the place and ofifered presents. After this the Mirza sent men to make inroads at Bai and Knsan, the former of which is a cool place, fit for the summer, and the latter a warm place, fit for the winter. These places were pillaged, and some princesses of the Jetes found there were made prisoners.* Hence they went to plunder the city of Tarem. (On the Chinese map a place Tarim is marked on the Tarim river, which, as is known, flows into the Lopnor.
)
After these conquests the Mirza departed from Aksu for Khotan. This city is distant 157 days' journey from KamhaJ.ek, capital of Northern China, called Katai, which is a flourishing and populous country, with abundance of water. We count from Kotan to Karakhodja thirty-five days' journey, from there to Tetkaul, frontier of China, forty-one,t where there is a wall situated between two mountains, in which wall is a great gate, and several yam khane or inns to lodge passengers ; and soldiers are always at this place to guard the frontier and the entrance of the wall. From here to Ghen djan fu, a city of China, is fifty-one days' journey ; from that place to Kambalek forty. It is also forty from Ghendjan fu to Nemnai. The author of the Zafernameh adds that he has been assured that there is another road to go from Khotan to the frontier of China in forty days, but there is not one dwelling-place in it ; the sands make it very tiresome, and although the water which is drawn out of the wells in the desert is easily come at, yet in several places it is poison, and kills the animals which drink of it

These two rivers have their sources in the mountain of Karangutah* The Mirza thus reduced all the places and castles of the frontier province (of Moghulistan) to Timur's obedience. He at length departed from Khotan and came to Karanfjutak, a very steep and rugged mountain,+ to wiiich the inhabitants of Khotan and the neighbouring places fly for refuge in time of war. The Mirza did not judge it convenient to hazard his troops there, but returned and spent the winter at Kashgar, and in spring went back to Andedjan.
After Khizer Khodja's death in 1399, he was succeeded by his son Mohammed Khan. His name, and that of his brother, Shama jehan, appear several times in the Zafer nameh and Abder razzak's Life of Shah Rok. In 1397 Shama jehan was at Timur's court. In 141 1 Mohammed Khan is recorded to have sent his brother Shama jehan to invade Maverannahr. As we shall see farther on, the Chinese annals assert that Shama jehan had been the immediate successor of Khizer Khodja, and was succeeded by his younger brother Mohammed.
Shir Mohammed, son of Mohammed, succeeded his father according to the Tarikhi Rashidi, but Abder razzak records, s. a. 14 15, that after the death of Mohammed, Khan of Moghulistan, Nokshi jcJuin, son of Shama jehan, succeeded him. This is in accordance with the Chinese annals. In the next year Nakshi jehan sent an embassy to Shah Rok. According to Mirkhond (and probably also to Abder razzak), in 1425 Shir Mohammed was Khan of Moghulistan. In this year Mirza Olug Beg of Samarkand undertook a great expedition into the country of the Jetes, and defeated Shir Mohammed.
Weis Khan, a nephew of Shir Mohammed, having collected in the desert a band of adventurers, carried on a predatory war with his uncle, after whose death he was elected Grand Khan. He was not rec<mciled to Amir Khodaidad {v. supra), who adhered to his uncle, and called in Ulug Beg from Samarkand. Weis Khan was a prince of great energy. He was throughout his reign engaged in constant war with the Kalmaks, his eastern neighbours. The Tarikhi Rashidi says that he fought sixty-one actions against the Kalmak chief Eshan Tayshi, and only gained a single victory.

Weis Khan had his seat in the vicinity of Turfan, where he excavated several karez, or subterranean aqueducts, for the irrigation of the fields. He was very fond of hunting the wild camel, and annually made an excursion to Lob and Katak in pursuit of the game for the sake of their wool, which his mother used to weave into cloth for his vestments, and he wore no other but these.* In the course of the wars arising out of Ulug Beg's invasion, Weis Khan was accidentally slain by an arrow discharged by one of his own men in 1428-29. In the narrative of Shah Rok's embassy to China, Awia (Weis) Khan is noticed. 1420, at war with Shir Mohammed, and farther on the diarist speaks of an envoy of Awis Khan who had been robbed. They saw him subsequently in Peking. Weis Khan left two S(ms, Isan Buka (11.) and Yunus, each of whom claimed the succession. The latter sought the support of Mirza Ulug Begof Samarkand. But Ulug Beg refused this, took Yunus pris(mer, and sent him to Herat to his father Shah Rok, who placed Yunus under the care of Sherifeddin, the aiithor of the Zafer nameh, at Yezd, where he remained for twelve years. After Sherifeddin's death he was conveyed to Tabriz, and finally to Shiraz. During this time Isan Buka reigned in Moghulistan. When Mirza Abu Said, of the house of Timur, 1451-68, had established himself at Samarkand, Isan Buka invaded Ferghana. Abu Said, in retaliation, sent for the exiled Yunus, conferred on him the Khanate of Moghulistan, and despatched with him an army into that country. Isan Buka, who was then at Yulduz, the farthest eastern extremity of his dominions, on hearing of this attempt, collected his forces, and set out
to the relief of KasJigar, which Yunus besieged. A desperate battle wa& fought, about twelve miles from Kashgar, near AJcsu. Yunus was completely defeated, and arrived at Herat, where Abu Said then was, in tlie greatest distress, Abu Said bestowed on him the territory of Masikhi^ a small hill country dependent on Andedjan and bordering on Tashkend, and sent him to renew the contest. This happened in 1456. Isan Buka died in 1462, and was succeeded by his son. Dost Mohammed, who reigned only four years.
Yunus Khan who, after the death of his brother, Isan Buka, had been joined by many of the tribes, became all powerful when Dost Mohammed died in 1468, and succeeded in establishing his authority in Moghulistan. Dost's son, Kepek, then a boy, was carried off by the immediate followers of the family, and they fled with him to Turfan, at the eastern extremity of the country, where, some time after, he was murdered. Yunus Khan,

after his long sojourn in Persia, had become fond of cities and cultivated countries, and it was not his wish to take up his residence at Aksu. But the tribes disliked settled habitations, preferring to dwell under tents, and compelled him to return to the wilds of Moghulistan. After the disastrous expedition of Abu Said to Karabagh on the Araxes, where he perished in 1469, Yunus Khan, in fulfilment of an engagement with Abu Said, bestowed three of his daughters on Abu Said's sons. Thus he became the maternal grandfather of the famous Sultan Baber. Not very long after, in the course of 1472-73, a Kalmak chief, expelled from his own country through intestine feuds, entered Moghulistan on the east with a numerous army. Yunus, on attempting to resist them, was completely defeated on the banks of the Hi river, and fled with the remains of his army westward. He passed the winter at Kara Tokai, on the Sihun, and moved in the spring to Tashkend. Here he was made prisoner by the governor of this place, who was nominally under the Sultan of Samarkand. It appears that his Amirs, discontented with him, had entered into a conspiracy with the governor. It was only about a year after that Yunu.i was released from his prison by one of his Amirs, and returned to Moghulistan. The Kalmaks had by this time returned to their own country. Yunus then remained for several years in the deserts of Moghulistan, never even hinting at a wish to visit any town. In 1479-80, Yunus assisted Mohammed Haider Mirza Doghlat, Amir of Kashgar, against his nephew Abu Bekr ; but this campaign was not successful, for Abu Bekr was finally left in possession of Kashgar. Much of the latter part of Yunus Khan's life was occupied by his transactions with his sons-in-law, the Sultans of Samarkand and Ferghana. He was particularly attached to Sultan Oniar Sheikh of Ferghana, the father of Baber, whom he frequently visited. His sons-in-law gave up to him Tashkend and Sairam. But when the Khan manifested his intention to remain there, a number of the Moghul tribes separated from his camp, and went home, putting at their head his younger son. Sultan Ahmed Khan, so that the empire was again severed in Yunus' lifetime. Tashkend and Sairam continued for some time to be the usual residence of one branch of the Moghul Khans. Yunus Khan died in 1496.
Sultan Mahmud Khan, the elder son of Yunus, generally called " the Elder Khan," succeeded to his father as Grand Khan, and reigned over the tribes which had entered Tashkend and Sairam, or that dwelt in the neighbouring steppes. But his younger son, Stdtan Ahmed, or " the Younger Khan," continued to govern the tribes that ranged in the more distant parts of Moghulistan, Aksu, Turfan, &c. Mahmud Khan was successful in a war against the Sultans of Ferghana and Samarkand. In 1497 he took possession of Turkestan, lower down the Sihun, and the government of this district he bestowed upon Sheibani Khan, the Uzbek, as a reward for some important services. But Sheibani

was no sooner established in his government than the scattered Uzbeks began to assemble from all quarters under his banners. His power daily increased. Sultan Ahmed, the younger. Khan, who ruled in Eastern Moghulistan, was a man of great energy and capacity. E[e made successful inroads on the infidel Kalmaks, whom he defeated in two bloody battles, which earned for him the name of " Ilachi Khan, or slaughtering Khan. When hia elder brother Mahmud was defeated by the Kaizak- Uzbeks, Ahmed marched to his assistance, invaded their territory, and plundered their country. The rapid success of Sheibani, who in 1500 had made himself master of Samarkand, caused the brothers to act in concert against this common enemy. Thus the younger Khan came to Tashkend with about 1500 men. But in 1503 Sheibani defeated the brothers completely, and they fell into his hands. Subsequently he set them at liberty, and they retired into the desert. The younger Khan died of grief a year afcer, while Mahmud Khan, who had returned to seek the protection of Sheibani, was put to death by order of the Uzbeg in 1 508.
When Sultan Ahmed had set out from Aksu to assist his brother on the Sihun, he caused his eldest son Mansur to be installed as the Khan of the Moghuls ; and now, on his father's death, he continued to exercise his authority at Aksu, and in the whole territory to the east as far as Chcdis (v. p. 200) and Turfan. He died in 1544, and was succeeded by his son Sha Khan. Sultan Ahmed, as well as Mansur and Shah Khan, are mentioned in the Chinese annals as rulers of Turfan (see p. 196- 1 98). It seems
that this line of the Chagatai Khans survived no longer as such. A son of Ahmed, however, succeeded in founding a dynasty in Kashgar, which maintained itself there for more than a century and a lialf (see note 1037).

the king and his envoy. In the ninth month of the same year tlie emperor entrusted the secretary K\ian CKe, the censor Han King, and the councillor T^ang Cheng with a mission to the countries in the west. They bore also an imperial letter for Hei-di-rh-huo-djo of the following tenor :

"Although there are many kingdoms in the world, separated by mountains and seas, and differing one from another in their rules and customs, nevertheless, it seems to me, good and bad feelings, passions and human nature (literally ^ blood and breath ') are the same everywhere. Heaven assists mankind, and looks benevolently on everybody. It is the same with respect to the ruler on whom Heaven bestowed supreme power. Observing the heavenly rules, he is kindly disposed towards mankind, and shows mercy on everybody. Thus all the various kingdoms of the world are entitled to the merciful regards (of the emperor) and prosperity. When the inferior kingdoms will honour the great ones. Heaven will be propitious to them. In times past, when the rulers of the Sung dynasty had become careless, and the wicked officers infringed the laws. Heaven abandoned this dynasty and bestowed the power upon the Yuan (Mongols). Shi tsu (Kubilai Khan, the first Mongol emperor in China) arrived from the Mongolian desert to take possession of China and rule there. The people then became easy again, and enjoyed peace for more than seventy years, when the successors of Shi tsu began to neglect the ruling of their people, and appointed unworthy ofiicers who disregarded the laws. The strong oppressed the weak. The indignation of the people cried to Heaven. The heavenly order then was bestowed upon me. I am holding now the sceptre of power, and am ruling over the black-haired people (the Chinese). I pursue with my troops the disobedient. I treat kindly those who submit. In the space of thirty years I succeeded in tranquillising all provinces of the Middle Empire. The foreign kingdoms also pay their respects, and acknowledge my supremacy. Only the Yiian (Mongols) disturbed the

Cliinese ftoiuier wheii my troops advanced to the lake Fu-yu-rh-hai (see note 1017), and caused a Mongol prince with his host to surrender. At the same time several luindreds of people from Sa-ma-rh-han, who had arrived for the purpose of trade, were made prisoners, and I despatched one of my officers to carry them back to their country. Since that time three years have elapsed. After my envoys returned, you sent an embassy to me to offer tribute. I am much obliged to you, and wish that you may continue to be on good terms with us, and entertain frequent intercourse with China. I send you my envoys to greet you and laud your zeal." The emperor's envoys arrived at Bie-shi-ba-li, and transmitted the letter to the king ; but when it was discovered that they had no presents for him, the gracious letter of the emperor made no impression upon the sovereign of Ijje-shi-ba-li. He retained K^uan CKe, whilst the other Ciiinese envoys were allowed to return home. In the first month of 1397, ^^^^ emperor despatched once more an officer to the king of Bie-shi-ba-li with the fol
lowing letter :

" Since the time I ascended the throne, my officers at the frontier have never thrown obstacles in the way of the foreign merchants who came to traffic with China, and I had also given orders that the foreigners might be kindly treated by my people. Thus the foreign merchants realise great benefits, and there is no trouble at the frontier. Our flowery land (China) is a great power, and we show kindness to your country. Why then has the envoy I sent to you some years ago in order to establish friendly terms been retained ? Why do you act so ? Last year I ordered all the Mohammedan merchants from Bie-shi-ba-li who had come to China to be retained until my envoy K*uan Ch'e should be released. However, I allowed them to carry on trade in- our country. Subsequently, when they complained of their having left their families at home, I commisfcjiated them, and let them return home.

The principal things to be taken into consideration are whether the laws of justice h;ive been observed or not, and whether a laudable zeal has been shown or not. Now I ask you, have you been just
and have you shown laudable zeal ? " When the king had received this letter he released K*uan
Che. After Yung lo acceded to the throne he sent an envoy with a letter and presents to the king of Bie-shi-ba-li.

The envoy was well treated and rewarded. At that time it had happened that An-Jco THe-mu-rh, prince of Hami, had been poisoned by Gui-li-chH, Khan of the Mongols {v. p. 163), and Sha-mi-ch*a-gan made war on the latter. The emperor was thankful, and sent an envoy with presents to him, exhorting the king to be on good terms with T^o-t*^o, the prince of Hami. In 1406 Sha-mi-ch'a-gan sent tribute, and the emperor accordingly despatched Liu T\e-mu-rh, a high officer, with presents to Bie-shi-ba-li. In the year 1407 Sha-mi-ch*a-gan presented three times tribute. His envoys had been ordered to solicit the assistance of Chinese troops for reconquering Sa-ma-rh-han, which country, as they stated, had formerly belonged to Bieshi-ba-li.^^22 The emperor sent his eunuchs, Fa T'^ai and LI Ta^ together with Liu T*ie-mu-rh, to Bie-shiba-li to inquire cautiously into the matter.

presented silk stuffs to the king, and were well received. They returned home in the next year, and brought the intelligence that Sha-mi-clia-gan was deceased, and his younger brother, Ma-ha-ma}^^ had succeeded him. The emperor then sent the same envoys once more to Bie-shiba-li to offer a sacrifice in memory of the late king and bestow presents on Ma-ha-ma. When, in 14 lO, imperial envoys on their way to Sa-ma-rh-han passed through Bieshi-ba-li, they were well treated by Ma-ha-ma, who in the next year despatched an embassy to the Chinese court, offering fine horses and SLwenjpa'o (leopard). When this embassy returned, they were accompanied by An {v. p. 144), who carried sjold-embroidered silk stuffs for the kincj. Ad that time an envoy of the Wa-la (Oirats) complained that Ma-ha-ma was arming for making war on the Wa-la. The emperor sent to warn him. In 141 3 Ma-ha-ma sent one of liis generals with tribute to China. He reached Kan su. Orders had been sjiven to the civil and military authorities to receive him honourably. In the next year (141 4) people returning from the Si yu brought the intelligence that Ma-ha-ma's brother and mother had both died in a short interval. The emperor sent again An to Bie-shi-ba-li with a letter of condolence. When Ma-ha-ma died he left no son. His nephew, Nahei-shi-dji-han,^^^^ succeeded him, and in the spring of 141 6 despatched an envoy to inform the emperor of his uncle's death. The emperor sent the eunuch Li Ta to offer a sacrifice in memory of the late king and confer the title of wang (king) on his successor. In 14 17 Ka-hei-shidji-han sent an embassy to inform the emperor that he was about to marry a princess from Sa-ma-rh-han}^^ and solicited in exchange for horses a bride's trousseau. Then 500 pieces of variegated and 500 of plain white silk stuff were bestowed on the king of Bie-shi-ba-li as wedding presents.

In 14 1 8 an envoy, by name Su-k'o, arrived from Bie-shiba-li, reporting that his sovereign (Na-hei-shi-dji-han) had been slain by his cousin, Wai-sz}^^ who then had declared himself king. At the same time Wai-sz' with liis people had transferred their abode to the west, changing the
former name of the empire (Bie-shi-ba-li) into I-li-ba-li}^'^ The emperor said that it was not his custom to meddle with the internal affairs of foreign countries. He bestowed upon Su-k*o the rank of tu tu tsien shi, and at the same time sent the eunuch Yang Chung witli a mission to Wai-sz', conferring on the king as presents an arrow, a sword, a suit of armour, and silk stuffs. The chieftain Hit-dai-da'^^^ and more than seventy other people of I-li-ba-li all received presents. Subsequently Wai-sz' sent frequently tribute to the Chinese court,^^'^ as did also his mother, So-lu-Van Ha tun (Sultan Khatun). In 1428 Wai-sz* died, and was succeeded by his son, Ye-sien bu-hua}^^^ who also sent repeatedly tribute to China. Tribute was also offered by Bu-sai-in, the son-inlaw of the late king. Ye-sien bu-hua died in 1445, and was succeeded by Yemi-li hU'djo}^^^ The latter sent camels as tribute, and also a block of rude jade weighing 3800 kin, but not of the best quality. The Chinese government returned for every two kin of jade one piece of white silk. In 1457 a Chinese envoy was sent to I-li-ba-li with presents for the king,

and in 1456 again. It was then settled that I-li-ba-li was to send tribute every three or five years, and the number of the people in tlie suite of the envoy should not surpass ten men. Subsequently embassies from that country were seldom seen at the Chinese court. In the "M^m. cone, les Chinois," vol. xiv. 278, Father Amiot has translated a letter addressed to a Chinese emperor of the Ming by She-le-ma onou-che, a governorgeneral in I-li-ba-li, who had presented western horses. The article on Bie-shi-ba-li (or I-li-ba-li) in the Ming history concludes with some notes regarding this country and the customs of its inhabitants. More detailed accounts of the same subject, drawn for the greater part from the Shi Si yii ki [v. p. 147), are found in the Ming Geography, which I proceed to translate here ;

Tlie country of I-li-ba-li is surrounded by deserts. It extends 3000 li from east to west, 2000 from north to south. There are no cities or palace buildings. The people are nomads, living in felt tents, and changing their abode together with their herds in accordance with the existence of water and pasture-land. They are of a fierce-looking appearance. Their common food is flesh and kumis. They are dressed in the same fashion as the Wa-la (Oirats). CKen Clieng (the author of the Shi Si yli ki), however, reports that they are wont to dress themselves in the Mohammedan fashion, but that their language resembles that of the Wei-wu-rh (Uigurs). The king shaves his head and wears a chao-la mao}^^^ on which he sets up the tail-feather of the tsW lao}^^^ He sits on variegated embroidered carpets spread on the
1032 rphe Chinese chai-acter mao means a cap. But here the three characters ckao-la-mao seem to render the Turkish word chalma, meaning a turban. 1033 ipije Pen ts'ao kang mu, chap, xlvii,, gives the following description of
the bird tsz* lao : —This bird lives on the great lakes of southern countries (India). It resembles the hao (a general name for cranes and crane-like birds), but is of enormous size. With its wings displayed, it measures from five to six feet, and when elevating the head it is from six to seven feet high. The colour of its plumage is bluish-grey. It has a long neck. The

ground. When he gives an audience to foreign envoys, it is never required of them to bow their heads to the ground; they have only to kneel down. There is in this country the Po Shan (White mountain),
which sends out continually smoke and fire. It contains much nao sha (sal ammoniac). In order to collect it, the people put on shoes with wooden soles, for leather soles would be burnt. There are caverns in this mountain, in which a kind of dark mud is produced. This flows out and then changes into sal ammoniac. The people use it in curing cutaneous diseases.^**^* The Tiung ling or Onion mountains belong also to this
crown of the head is destitute of plumage, and of a red colour. The beak is dark yellowish, more than a foot long, straight, and flattened. Beneath the crop it has a dewlap like that of the t'i hu (pelican). The feet are black, and the claws resemble those of fowls. This bird is very voracious and quarrelsome, and attacks even men. It feeds on fish, snakes, and young birds. This is quite a correct description of the great Indian stork, Ciconia Marabu, the tail-feathers of which are highly prized in Asia as well as in Europe. The Mongol annals, Yiian ch'ao pi shi [vide i. 192), mention this bird under the name of tokuraun. At least the Chinese translation renders this name by tsz' lao. In modern Mongol, toyoriu means crane. According to Sultan Baber (" Memoires," i. 314,), the feathers used as ornaments in the turbans are yielded by herons, which the people of Kabul are wont to catch. These feathers are largely exported to Irak and Khorassan.
^"'' A similar account of the White mountain is already found in the History of the Northern Wei (fifth century), in the article on the king"dom of Kui-tsz (Kucha, see note 1015). It is stated there that Kui-tsz' is
situated 170 li south of the Po shan. A thick badly-smelling fluid flows out from this mountain, forming a rivulet, which, after the short course of .several li, disappears in the ground. This fluid is used in curing the falling off of the hair and the teeth, and is also given in dysentery. The Sui Si yii t'u ki, an account of Western countries during the Sui dynasty (sixth century), quoted in the Wen hien t'ung k'ao, states about the same Po shan, that it is situated 200 li north of Kui-tsz', and that fire and smoke constantly rise from it. It produces nao aha, or sal ammoniac. The mountain is also known by the name of A-yhie. This latter, according to Klaproth (" Volcans du Thien shan, Tabl. hist. As.," 109, 1 10) means (in Turkish) Fire mountain. Compare also Ritter, iL 333. The Po shan (or Be shan, as the name is written on the Russian maps) bears still the same Chinese name. It lies, according to the maps, about sixty English miles north of Kucha. Since Humboldt and Ritter, the Po shan has always been considered as an active volcano of the Tien shan

country. They owe their name to the abundance of (wild) onions there. They are very high. The natives call them ra-shi da-han}^^ It is very cold in that country. In the mountains and deep valleys a fall of snow is not rare even in the sixth

chain. But no European had visited it till l88l, when, at the instance of Professor Mushketoff, the geological explorer of Central Asia, a Russian expedition, headed by Kisselefif, was sent to decide the question by direct
observation. A short account of the results of this expedition was published in the "Turkestan Gazette," 6th October i8Si. The Be shan or Be fan shan (Alum mountain) of the Chinese, the Zemshtag (same meaning) of the natives, was found sixteen versts north-east of Kucha, in a basin surrounded by the massive Ailak mountains ; its fires are not volcanic, but proceed from burning coal. On the sides of the mountain there are caves emitting smoke and sulphurous gas. The burning is accompanied with great noise. Mushketoff, in his "Turkestan," 1886, i. 172, states that sulphur, sal ammoniac, and alum had been collected on the mountain. He considers the question of the existence of volcanoes in Central Asia as decided in the negative (ibid. p. 131-133). 1035 iphg name Tdunrj ling occurs first in the Chinese annals in the second century B.C., when the Chinese became acquainted with the countries of Central and Western Asia. They apply it to the high mountains which border the Tarim basin to the west, and which connect the T' ien shan with, the Kun lun range. On the way from Kashgar to the Pauiir, followed by Forsytli, there is, south-west of Task kurgan, a pass called N/'sa Task devan,. which latter name resembles the Tash daban in the Chinese account. 1036 This name is evidently mtended for Issikul. This great lake in Western Turkestan is called Jssikul (hot lake) by the Kirghizes, Temurtunor (ferruginous lake) by the Mongols and Kalmuks. It is also known by the name Tuzkul (salt lake). It is mentioned in the Chinese annals asearly as the seventh century. See T'ang shu, chap. 258.6, article Shi (Tashkend), where it is placed near the Sui-ye or Chu river, and named Jc hai (hot sea). The Chinese chronicler adds that the lake does not freeze in winter. The Buddhist monk Hiian tsang, who visited the lake in about. A.D. 630, calls it Tding hai (limpid sea). See Beal's " Si yu ki," i. 25. The name of this lake occurs only once, it seems, in the Mohammedan chroniclers of the Mongol period. See d'Ohsson, iv. 565. Oeuldjaitu, Khan of Persia, who was at war with Isan Buka, Khan of the Middle Empire, is stated to have sent his troops into Turkestan, and they advanced as far as Tolas and hsenkeul. The name Issigkeul frequently occurs in Sherifeddin's narrative of Timur's expeditions into Moghulistan (see note 1013)^

HA-SHI-HA-RJI (KASHGAR).
This is a little realm in the Si yil. In the year 1408 Pa T'ai and Li Ta (two Chinese envoys sent to Bie-shi
ba-li, V. p. 239) visited also Ha-shi-ha-rh. They brought an imperial letter and presents (for the ruler). In 141 3, when Bo-a-rh-hin-f ai returned home (this envoy had been in Samarkand, Herat, Shiraz), he visited also Ha-shi-ha-rh, and (the ruler of it) then sent an envoy with tribute to the court. In the reign of Slian te (1426-36), Ha-shiha-rh offered also tribute. In 1463 a Chinese envoy was sent thither, but no embassy came in return from that
oountry.^^^^
but it would rather seem that was the name of a place. A curious statement is found in Arab Shah, who reports (ii. 393) that Timur banished one part of the Tatars (Kara Tatars of the Zafer nameh, whom he transferred in 1403 from Asia Minor to Turkestan) to the fortress Dowaira, which was situated in the middle of the lake called Tssicoul. This lake, he says, was at the boundary between the dominions of Timur and Moghulistan. Kostenko in his " Turkestan," i. 177, gives an interesting account of
Lake Issikul, from which I may quote the following statements :—The lake
is very deep ; no islands are now found on it, but it has many shoals. No traces of ancient settlements on its shores can be discovered, although there is a tradition among the Kirghizes that there was in ancient times a city which was submerged by the sudden appearance of the lake. But this supposition has no foundation. The water of the lake is brackish. Owing to the numerous hot springs in the lake, the temperature of its water is elevated, and it never freezes, notwithstanding the severe winters in these regions. The bottom of the lake contains a good deal of iron ore, which is thrown out by the waves, and which the Kirghizes manufacture into iron. 1037 The history of Kashgar in the period here spoken of is given in the Tarikhi Rashidi. See Erskine's translation, I. c. ; Yule's " Cathay," 545
;
Bellew's '' History of Kashgar." Compare also Quatremere's article "Le Royaume de Kachgar," translated from the Heft iklim in " Not. et Extr.," XIV. i. 474. Kashgar in the Mongol period belonged to the Middle or Chagatai empire, but it had always been conferred on a chief officer of the Khan's court. Thus in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it was in the possession of the Doyhlat family. Amir Yuladji Doghlat was hereditary ruler of Kashgar under Tughlak Timur, Khan of Moghulistan, whom he had raised to the throne in 1 347. Amir Khidaidad Doghlat succeeded his father in the government of Kashgar, probably soon after 1347. He was then only seven years old, and his uncle, Kamar-eddm, usurped the office at Kashgar as belonging of right to him, and at length also the throne of Moghulistan

YU-T'IEN (KH0TAN).i''^8
Yii-tHen is an ancient name by which this country was known in China since the time of the Han dynasty, and down to the Sung dynasty it has always had intercourse with the Middle Kingdom. In 1406 an envoy from this country arrived at the Chinese court to offer tribute, and when he returned home the chi hui Shen-chung Mu-sa accompanied him, carrying presents and an imperial letter for the chief of Yii-t*ien, whose name was Da4u-wa I-hu-la-ghin, who in return
(see note 1013). After the destruction of Kamar-eddin's power by Timur in 1389, Khodaidad, relieved of his rival, resumed the government of Kashgar, Khotan, Aksu, Bai, and Kucha, and put Khizer Khodja on the throne of Moghulistan. But he retained the real power of the government of Moghulistan till Amir Khodaidad died in 1446. He was a man of great influence, and boasted that in his long reign he had made six Grand Khans of Moghulistan. We have already seen that he is mentioned in the Chinese annals, s. a. 1418. The embassy of Shah Rok to China, when they had entered Moghulistan in 1420, were met by the venerable Amir Khodaidad, who, according to the diarist, was then enjoying great authority in the country. Khodaidad was succeeded by his grandson, Amir Syed Ali, who died in 1457, and was succeeded by his sons Mohammed Haider Mirza in Kashgar, and Saniz Mirza in Yarkend. Haider Mirza was expelled from Kashgar by his brother Saniz, but after the death of the latter in 1464, again took possession of Kashgar. In 1480 he was expelled by his nephew and stepson Ahu Bekr, son of Saniz. Abu Bekr was defeated and expelled in 1 5 14 by Sultan Said Khan, the third son of Sultan Ahmed Khan of Moghulistan, who founded a new dynasty in Kashgar, which maintained itself there for more than a century and a half. 1038 The history of Khotan is very obscure, and it seems to me that almost all we know about it is from Chinese sources. Abel R^musat in his ** Histoire de la Ville de Khotan," 1820, has brought together all he has been able to gather with respect to the history of this country from the Chinese annals since the second century B.C. down to the present dynasty.
See also my note on Khotan, p. 47, We know from the Tarikhi Rashidi that, in the days of the Ming, Khotan belonged to Moghulistan, or rather to Kashgar, the Amirs of which province, as w;e have seen, governed it in their own right, and acknowledged only nominally the supremacy of the Khan of Moghulistan. The Amirs had probably their governors at Khotan. Towards the end of the fourteenth century Timur's troop overran several times Kashgaria, and in the famous expedition of Timur's grandson, Mirza Eskender, in 1399, into Moghulistan, this young prince reached also Khotan. In relating this campaign, the author of the



i5&i6cENT.] KHOTAN, 247
despatched an envoy, by name Ma-la-ha-sa-mu-ding, with a piece of rude jade for the emperor. Tlie chi hui Shang heng accompanied the Khotan envoy on his way home. In 1420 an embassy from Yu-t*ien arrived at the same time when embassies from Ha-lie (Herat) ^^^^ and Ba-dahei-shan reached the Chinese court. It was accompanied home by Ch^eii CKeng and Kuo King. In 1422 another embassy from Yii-t*ien presented fine jade, and in 1424 again an embassy from that country arrived, presenting horses. It was well received by the emperor Jen tsung, who had then just mounted the throne. Jen tsung's predecessor, the emperor Yung lo (1403-24),. had always been desirous that all countries, even the most distant, should acknowledge his supremacy, and during hisrei'jn envoys from the countries of the West used to arrive every year. Those foreigners are very fond of Chinese productions, especially silk, and derive benefit from exchanging them with the goods they bring from their countries. Thus the foreign merchants were in the habit of coming to China under the false pretext of carrying tribute. They brought with them camels, horses, jade,, and other things. When they' had entered China, the government provided them with boats and carts to travel by rivers or by land, took care of their subsistence, and made the necessary preparations at the stations for their maintenance and despatch. The soldiers as well as the
Zafer natneh gives also a short account of this province' (see p. 232). In about 1479 Abu Bekr, nephew of Mohammed Haider Mirza of Kashgar, took possession of Khotan, and finally expelled his uncle also from. Kashgar. On modern Chinese maps, and in Chinese geographical works published in the last century, Khotan appears under the names of Ho-iien and I-li-ts'i. Jlchi or Elchi is, indeed, as we know from the reports of modern European travellers, the real name of the capital of Khotan. During the last twenty-two years Khotan has repeatedly been visited by English travellers (Johnson, 1865 ; Sir Douglas Forsyth, 1870, and 1873-74^ and others) from India. Last year General Przewalsky explored the regions of the Tarim basin. 1'):j9 Here the embassy of Shah Rok to the Chinese emperor, known to us from Mohammedan sources, is alluded to.



248 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
people were fatigued in carrying the tribute (of the foreigners). Besides this, when these embassies returned home, there were always a great number of their people who remained behind with their goods over a tract of several thousands of li, and thus became a burden to the government. Many troubles arose from this state of things, and great expenses for the government as well as for the emperor's subjects. The officers and the people began to murmur. The council of ministers were of opinion that in the future the emperor ought to abandon this solicitude with respect to the foreigners. When the prejudice the government was incurring by these abuses had been pointed out to the emperor, he became very indignant, and ordered the officers who had permitted these inconveniences to be reprimanded. It was then decreed that in future no envoys should be sent to the countries in the West. Owing to these measures foreign embassies did not
arrive so frequently.^^*^ From early times Yli-t'ien has always been a great kingdom. During the Sui and T*ang periods (sixth to tenth century) it subdued the kingdoms of Jung-lu, Hanmiy K'^il-le, and P^'i-shan}'^^'^ and thus its power increased.
1040 rpjjjg gjncere confession of the Ming chroniclers, and the report laid before the emperor, permit us to view in its proper light these so-called embassies from foreign countries so frequently recorded in the Chinese annals, and especially in the beginning of the Ming dynasty. Emperor Yung lo, being anxious to see his glory spread over the " ten thousand kingdoms of the world," had sent emissaries to almost all countries of Asia, inviting them to send embassies to his court. Of course, as these embassies were well received in China, they arrived frequently, all the more as they generally pursued purely commercial objects. Not only did they receive in return for the goods the}' had brought as tribute presents of often mticli higher value, but they were allowed also to carry on trade in China, and thus realised great benefits. There can be no doubt that many of these embassies recorded in the Ming shi were simply mercantile caravans, not always despatched by the rulers of the respective countries. This can be concluded also from some of the supplications translated by Amiot (see p. 149). The author of the Khitai nameh states that all the Mohammedans who go to China, in order to be admitted present themselves as envoys. ^"'^ All these kingdoms are spoken of for the first time in the Ts'ien Han shu, chap, xcvi., before our era.

Towards the end of the Yliaii dynasty Yii-t*ien began to lose its splendour. It was attacked by the adjacent countries. The people fled to hide in the mountains (comp. p. 233). But after emperor Yung lo had re-established order, the countries of the Si yil began again to send tribute, Yu-t*ien recovered its former wealth, and the merchants passed again through this country. Yu-t*ien borders to the east upon the military district of K'u-sien (see p. 210), to the north upon I-li-ba-li (Moghuli
stan). It is distant from Su chou, on the north-east, 6300 /i.i042 According to ancient accounts (History of the Northern Wei, fifth century), Yii-t*ien lies 200 li north of the Tsung ling mountains. The Ming Geography notices more correctly that these mountains (see note
1035) lie to the south-east of Yli-t'ien.
East of the city of Yli-t'ien is the Po yil ho (river of
white jade), west of it the Lil yil ho (river of green jade).
There is a third river, the Hei yil ho (river of black jade), also west of the city. The sources of these three rivers are in the K^un-lun mountains.^^*^ The people who gather jade discover the fine pieces at moonlight in the river, and then dive to take them out.^^** The people of the adjacent countries are in the habit of stealing the jade of these three rivers, and then presenting it as tribute.
1042 'pjjjg figure is evidently too high. The distance between Khotan and Su chou, as the crow flies, is about 3000 li only. I may, however, observe that the caravans from Khotan to China did not go by the direct way, but preferred the much longer way by Kashgai'. Aksu, Turfan, Uami (see above, p, 232). ^"^ Regarding the K'un-lun of the Chinese (see note 980). The western part of it on our maps bears the name of Karakorum mountains, south and south-east of Khotan. The Zafer naraeh terms these mountains Karangutak (see p. 233). I may observe that on modern maps of these regions I find a place of this name marked more than fifty English miles south of the city of Khotan, on the river Yurung kash or Karang kash, which flows to Khotan. It is also the name of a mountain district there. 1044 rJ^Y^Q Zafer nameh mentions two rivers near Khotan which yield jade, iz., the Orak Kash and the Kara Kash {v. supra, p. 233). Capta-in Trotter, who accompanied Forsyth, in his " Account of the Mission to Yarkand and Kashgar," 1873-74, p. 154, notices both rivers under the names of Yurung Kash (white jade), and Kara Kash (black jade), and

Yu-t*ieii produces, besides jade, mulberry trees, hemp,
wheat, rice like that of China, grapes, asafcetida, fine
horses, &c. This country has always regularly sent tribute to the Chinese court down to the reign of Wan li (i 573-1620), and even in this reign embassies from YiL-t'ieu arrived.
SAI-LAN (SAIRAM).
Sai-lan lies east of Ta-shi-gan (Tashkend). It is distant from Sa-ma-rh-han in the west more than 1000 li}^^^ The city is two or three li in circuit, and is situated in the middle of a vast well-populated and fertile plain, where the five
kinds of corn, and many fruits and trees are cultivated. In summer time and in autumn there is found in the grass a little black spider, the sting of which is poisonous.^^^^ The
states that these names are also applied to two districts of Khotan. Jade is obtained near the bed of the Yurung Kash. There are two principal mines, one at a distance of fifteen miles, the other at twenty-five miles from Ilchu Jade is also procured from the bed of the river. The above Chinese denominations of the three jade rivers of Khotan occur first in the Chinese annals in the tenth century (History of the Sung). 1045 With respect to Sairam in the days of the Mongols. I beg to refer

Sairam is situated north-east, not east, as the Chinese account says^ of Tashkend and Samarkand. Sairam as well as Tashkend both lie on the great highway from China to Samarkand. See vol. i., " Chinese Mediaeval Travellers," pp. 74, 130. The embassy of Shah Rok to the Chinese emperor went by Samarkand, Tashkend, Sairam. It seems that the Chinese travellers of the Ming period, to whom we are indebted for this information on western countries, believed that their way lay straight from east to west. Sairam is frequently mentioned by the Mohammedan historians of the fifteenth century in connection with the warlike expeditions of Timur and his successors against Moghulistan and Kipchak. See Zafer nameh, i. 21, ii. 8, 14, 20, 62, vi. 26. Chemkend is noticed there as a village near Sairam (i. 21). Abder-razzak, s. a. 1410: the fortress of Sairam besieged by the Moghuls.

It originally belonged to Moghulistan since the partition of the Chagatai or Middle Empire (see p. 226), but during the latter part of Timur's reign it formed a part of his vast empire, and after the death of the conqueror, continued, it seems, to be subject to his successors in Samarkand. Towards the end of the fifteenth century Tashkend and Sairam were given up to Yunus Khan of Moghulistan, and after the death of this prince in 1496, his eldest son, Mahmud, reigned over the province of Tashkend and Sairam, In 1503 Sheibani, the Uzbeg chief, took possession of these tracts.

In the space of a hundred li the traveller meets many ruined cities, for this land is situated just at the boundary between Bie-shi-ha-li and the dominions of the Meng-gii (Mongols), and therefore has been frequently devastated, and its population has been dispersed. Now-a-days, several hundreds of soldiers are the only inhabitants of Yang-i, and the ruins of the ancient walls are covered with bushes and reeds. In the reign of Yung lo (1403-24), GJCen CUeng (a
Chinese envoy, see p. 147) visited this country.^^^^
1050 There are some irreconcilable contradictions in the above statements. The boundary between Bishbalik (Moghnlistan) and the territories of the Mongols cannot be 360 li east of Sairam. Probably we have to read Samarkand instead of Mongols. Farther on the same Ming shi states, in the article on Samarkand, that this latter country borders upon Yang-i. The name Yang-i seems to be intended for Yanglii hand (meaning new city). But there were in the Middle Ages several cities in Turkestan which bore this name. One of them is spoken of by Rashid-eddin as a city on the Lower Sihun, taken by Chinghiz Khan in 1220. The ruins of it can still be seen near the mouth of the Syr Daria (see note 676). But the Yang-i of the Ming shi refers to another city situated on the Talas river, as can be proved from the statements of the Mohammedan authors in tlie fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Tarikhi Rashidi (Howorth's " Mongols," ii. 286, resp. Veliaininoff Zernof) reports that the city of Taras (or Talas) was called YatigJii by the Mongols, and that there were many people of Yanghi in Maverannahr who were called Yanghelik. In the steppe of Yanghi, gays its author, are found the remains of several cities, and of domes, minarets, and schools, but he adds, it is not known which of these ancient cities was Yanghi, or what were the names of the others. It seems that the Masalek aiabsar (first half of the fourteenth century) gives an answer to this question, for we read in this book (Quatremere's transl. 224) that it was twenty days' journey from Samarkand to Yanghi, and that this latter consisted of four towns, separated from each other by a distance of a fersenkh each. They all had distinct names, and were known as Yanghi, Yaw/hi baligh, Kendjck. and I'alas. From Yanghi to Almalik was twenty days' journey. According to Arab Shah (Manger's transl. ii. p. 147), the city of Janci Bclas (correct reading according to Qnatrem^re and Fraehn in other manuscripts : Yanghi Talas) was situated in the country beyond the Khodjend river (Sihun), and distant from Samarkand fifteen
days' journey, and from Sairam about four days. We read in the Zafer nameh, vi. 26, s. a. 1404, Timur gave the Mirza Olug beg the government of the cities of Tashkend, Seiram, Yenghi, Ashira (correct reading Aspa

Sultan Baber in his " Memoirs," on the first page, notices that there was iu former times north of Ferghana the flourishing city of Yanghi, in books called Tarazkend. But the Uzbeks had destroyeil it. About ancient Taras or Talas see note 23. 1051 ^rab Shah (i. 217) relates the following story in connection with the
foundation of Shahrokia by Timur : —The latter had given orders to build a city (fortress) on the Sihun for the purpose of keeping in check the Jetes of Moghulistan. One day when Tinmr was playing at chess, and was just about to checkmate his opponent, the news was brought to him that the construction of the fortress had been finished, and at the same time another messenger arrived who informed him of the birth of a son. Timur then decided to give to the new-born prince the name of Shak Rok, and ordered the fortress to be named Shahrokia. (Shah in Persian means " the king," and rok the " rook or castle" at chess.) Arab Shah adds that Shahrokia wasbuilt on the opposite [i.e., right) bank of the Sihun, and that a floating bridge was spread there over the river. According to the Zafer nameh (ii. 24), Mirza Shah Rok, Timur's fourth son, was born in 1 377. But
Sherif-eddin refers the foundation of Shahrokia to a later time. We read in the Zafer nameh (vi. 27) on the subject : The city of Fenakend had been so ruined by Chinghiz Khan's army (compare i. 278), that there remained no traces of any edifices till 1 392, when Timur ordered it to be rebuilt and repeopled, and as he then gave it to Mirza Shah Rok, it was called Shahrokia. When the conqueror, in 1404, made preparations for his great expedition to China, he ordered the right wing of his army to pass the winter with the troops at Tashkend, Sairam, and Shahrokia. (Comp. alsoibid. vi. 39.) In the history of the successors of Timur (by Abder Razzak, Mirkhond, &c. ), Shahrokia is repeatedly mentioned. In 1416 Shah Rok's son, Ulug beg, on his way from Turkestan to Samarkand, crossed the Sihun at Shahrokia. In 1449 ^^^ same prince, pursued by his rebellious son Abdullatif, fled to Shahrokia. In 1461 Mirza Mohammed Juki, the son of Abdullatif, revolted against Sultan Abu Said, who was then ruling over Maverannahr and Khorassan (Herat), and at the Sultan's approach shut himself up in the fortress of Shahrokia on the Sihun, protected, as the chronicler reports, on three sides by the stream of the river, and on the fourth by a deep ditch. This place was then rendered unassailable by the Mirza. It was only in 1463 that the f01 tress surrendered after a siege of nearly twelve months by the Sultan's troops. Sultan Baber in hi-*

lien.)
Not far to the south of Sha-lu-hai-ya are mountains, the valleys of which are well populated. There are rich gardens. To the west there is a "reat sandv desert, which extends for nearly 200 li. It is destitute of w^ater, with the exception of some undrinkable brackish water found in some places. When cattle or horses drink it they die.^*^^^
A stinking plant, yielding the medicine a-wei, grows in this country .^^^* There is also a little bushy plant (shrub) from one to two feet high, which exudes a kind of dew which, when hardened in autumn, is eaten by the people
north towards Turkestan, where it finally loses itself in the moving sand, without reaching another river or a sea. An interesting notice rejrarding the site of ancient Shahrokia is found in the " Turkestan Gazette," December i6, 1886. According to the Tarikh nameh, written in the first half of the sixteenth century, Timur, after the foundation of Shahrokia, ordered a canal to be dug in order to conduct the water of the Sihun westward for the irrigation of the Djazir, or the desert which extends between the Jihun and the mountains of Djizak. The dry bed of this canal, known under the name of Urumbai aryk, can still be traced in this desert, which the Russians term '* golodnaya step," or hunger desert, and which the traveller proceeding from Tashkend to Samarkand has to cross between Chinaz and Djizak. By order of the Russian Government an attempt has even been made to re-establish the ancient watercourse in the Urumbai ai-yk, and also in another artificial channel, the Bokhara aryh or Shaar aryk, in the same desert. The author of this note in the " Turkestan Gazette" is disposed to identify the ruins called Sharkia, situated on the Sihun opposite the head of the Urumbai aryk, with ancient Shahrokia. Unhappily the aryks and places mentioned in this article are not found on the detailed Russian map of Turkestan, but it seems that the head of the Urumbai must be looked for south of Chinaz. 105-2 ipj^g river of Khodjend or Sihun.

An-di-gan is a little realm in the Si yil (Western countries). After T'ai tsu of the Yilan (Chinghiz Khan) conquered the Si yli, he divided it, and gave the principalities as appanages to the princes of his house. The smaller ones were governed by officers, like the appanages of these princes in China (v. supra, p. 11). After the fall of the Ylian dynasty, these principalities became independent. Emperor Yung lo repeatedly despatched envoys to these countries, and some of them accordingly sent tribute to the Chinese court. The larger ones called themselves kingdoms, the smaller ones places. During the reign of Yung lo. from seventy to eighty different tribes or places of the Si yil had sent envoys with tribute, to bow respectfully before the emperor's door. An-di-gan was one of these little realms. In 141 3 it sent tribute, together with Ha-lie (Herat). When, in 14 16, the emperor despatched Lu An and others to Ha-lie, Shi-la-sz\ and other countries to oijen a route for commerce, this envoy passed also through An-di-gan and bestowed presents on the chief.

Baber's description of Ferghana at the beginning of his "Memoirs." He writes Andedjan. In 1376 Tiinur made his son Omar Sheikh governor of Andekan (Zafernameh, ii. 16), and when this prince, in 1393, had been appointed governor of Fars, Timur, in 1 393, gave the government of Andekan to Mirza Eskender, third son of Omar Sheikh (ibid. v. 2). In 1404 Timur entrusted the Mirza Ibrahim Sultan, second son of Shah Rok, with the government of Andekan (ibid, vi, 26). In 1409 Shah Rok gave the government of Ferghana to Mirza Emirek Ahmed, a younger brother of Eskender. He was expelled in 14 14 by Mirza Ulug beg of Samarkand, and it seems that henceforth Ferghana depended on Samarkand. When Sultan Abu Said, great grandson of Timur, reigned in Samarkand, 1451-69, his son Omar Sheikh held the government of Andekan. Omar Sheikh died in 1494, and left Ferghana to his son Sultan Baber, who subsequently founded the Mongol empire in India. 1057 These identifications of the Ming shi are altogether arbitrary and wrong. In the days of the Han, Samarkand was known to the Chinese under the name oiK'ang-kU; the T'ang historians called it K'ang or Sa-moMen. See above, p. 59. As to the country Ki-pin, it has been generally identified with Kabul. 1058 This again is nouvsense.

In modern Mongol khurghen means a son-in-law. Klaproth informs us ("Nouv. Joum.

Serai Mulk Khamim, whom he married in 1369, and who subsequently became the mother of Shah Rok, was the daughter of Kazan Sultan Khaii of Turkestan and Maverannahr, who was a descendant of Chinghiz (Zafer nameh, i. 26). Compare also Arab Shah, i. p. 27 : '* Postquam vero Transoxianae imperium sibi vindicasset, Timur, aequalibus suis superior in iiiatrimonium accepit Regum Filias, ideoque addiderunt ei cognomen kurkan, quod in idiomate Moghulensi valet ' gener.' " But Arab Shah ismistaken in asserting farther on (ii. p, 859), that Tiraur's first and second wives were daughters of the emperor of China. I have not been able to^ find either in the Yiiaii shi or the Ming shi, where lists of the imperial princesses under each reign and their respective husbands are given, any corroboration of this suggestion. The Zafer nameh also, which notices nine wives of Timur, knows nothing about a Chinese princess among them. But besides Serai Mulk Khanum, Timur married in 1397 another Mongol princess, of the race of Chinghiz, called Tukel Khanum. She was the daughter of Khizer Khodja, Khan of Moghulistan (Zafer nameh, iii. 69, 70)^ Khanikoflf is therefore mistaken in stating in his "Description of the Khanate of Bokhara," 1843, P- '03> ^-hat the Medresseh Khanym in Samar
kand was built by a daughter of the emperor of China, Timur's wife. He states further that she had brought along with her for this purpose Chinese workmen. I am not aware from what sources the assertions of these authors are derived. The Great Timur, as he reports himself in his Autobiography, was born in 1336, March 19, in the neighbourhood of the city of Kesh (in the village of Ryar, according to Arab Shah, i. p. 15). He belonged to the Mongol tribe of Beritlass or Berlas {v. supra, p. 40), the progenitor of which, Kajuli, was the brother of Kabul Klian, the great-grandfather of Chinghiz. Timur's fifth ancestor, Karachar noyen, had been generalissimo and prime raiaister of Chagatai, the second son of Chinghiz. He first embraced the Mohammedan faith. Kesh, the property of Karachar, then became the resilience of his tribe, Berlas. The name of Timur« father was Taragai.
As Timur was lame— he had been wounded in the hand and foot in Seistan in 1363, he was called also Timur lenk (ZewA;=lame in Persian). See Zafer nameh, i. 8; Arab Shah, i. p. 15, ii. p, 781. This is the origin of the name Tavierlane, by which the conqueror was first known in Europe. In that period the Mongol Khans elected to reign over Maverannahr were mere titular khans, depending entirely on the great amirs, who set them up and murdered them as tli^y liked. After a long struggle between Timur and his brother-in-law, Hussein, for the supreme power, which finished with the defeat and execution of Hussein in 1369, Timur ascended the throne of Maverannahr, and set up his residence at Samarkand in 1370. However, it is a fact worthy of notice that Timur never assumed the title of Khan. Even ia the height of his conquests he called himself only Amir> S

He offered as tribute fifteen horses and two camels, and was well treated and rewarded. Sa-ma-rh-han then sent horses and camels as tribute every year, and in 1392 that country offered as tribute six pieces of velvet, nine pieces of blue so-fu^^^ and green sa-hala}^^ two pieces of each, knives and swords made of pin ^•^1062 armour, &c. At tlie same time Mohammedans from Sa-ma-rh-han had brought horses for sale to Lian^ chou (in Kan su). The emperor ordered these horses to be driven to the capital. During the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty tlie Mohammedans had spread over the whole of China, and especially in the province of Kan su they had settled in great number. Now an order was given to the governor of that province to send them back to their country, and accordingly, more than 1200 Mohammedans set out for Sa-ma-rh-han. In 1394, in the eighth month, an embassy despatched by THe-mu-rh arrived. The envoy offered to the emperor 200 horses, and transmitted a letter of his sovereign of the following tenor :

But in the Yiian shi, chap. Ixxviii., official dress, su-fu (evidently the same), is mentioned as a fine woollen cloth manufactured in the country of the Mohammedans.

(See above, p. 145.) This latter name, Tavgus Khan, applied to the Chinese emperor, occurs also in the Zafer nameh, iii. 70, v. 4, However, the allusion to the vase of Djemshid (see next note) in the above letter gives it a stamp of authenticity. low <j«jjjg j'g without doubt an allusion to the famous vase of Djemshid, spoken of frequently by the Persian poets.

Djemshid in Persian means " vase of the sun." See d'Herbelot's "Bibl. Orientale."

Intelligence then had been received that T'ie-mu-.rh had raised troops, and was about to set them in motion against China, intending to pass through Bie-shi-ba-li (Moghulistan).

Clavijo had left Samarkand on the 2 1st of November 1404. On his way home he went to visit Omar Mirza (Timur's grandson), who was encamped in the plain of Karabagh beyond the Araxes, and when he reached the camp, on the 20th March 1405, he first heard of the death of Timur Beg. But Clavijo is mistaken in stating that Timur died at Samarkand (Clavijo, 179, 186, 187). 1067 ]3y hig ]ast will, Timur had designated as his successor on the throne of Samarkand Pir Mohammed, the son of his eldest son, Jehanghir. Herat devolved to the conqueror's fourth son, SkaJt Rok. But after Timur's <ieath, Khalil Sultan (the Ha-li of the Chinese annals), son of Miran Shah,

Ha-li, who sent presents to the emperor. This envoy was richly rewarded. The emperor then despatched the chi hui Bo-a-rh-hin-Vai to offer sacrifices in memory of the deceased king of Sa-ma-rh-han, and bestow presents of silver and silk stuffs on the new king and the people. About that time Sha-hei Nu-rh-ding}^^ one of the chieftains (Amirs) of Sa-ma-rh-han, sent horses and camels as tribute. When this emljassy returned home, An was sent for a second time to Sa-ma-rh-han with presents for the king. He returned in 1409. An envoy from Sa-ma-rhhan came along with him. Subsequently Sa-ma-rh-han sent tribute every two or three years. In 141 5, when the Chinese envoys Li Ta and CJien CJieiig returned from their mission to the Si yu (see p. 147), an envoy from Sa-ma-rh-han came witli theni, and when this envoy returned, he w^as accompanied by CKen CJieng and Lv, An, carrying silver and silk stuffs as presents for the chief (of Samarkand), U-lu Bai^^^ and others, and when Ch'en
third son of Timur, usurped the throne, and established his power in Samarkand and Maverannahr (Zafer uameh, vi. 46). He had scarcely reigned four years when he was dethroned by Khodaidad Husseini, and conveyed to Moghulistan. The Amir Khodaidad Husseini, a vauant <7"ueral, who had taken part in most of Timur's campa.j^us, after the death of uhe latter sided with Khali], and put him on the throne. Khodaidad was put to death by order of the Khan of Moghulistan in 1409. As to Klialil Sultan, he returned from Moghulistan. Shah Rok, who had taken possession of Samarkand, sent him to Rei in Persia, where he died in I4I1. 1063 The Amir Sheikh Nureadm, a famous general in Timur's army. He was presort when Timur died. In 1409 he revolted against Shah Rok, and retired with his troops to Otrar. He applied for assistance t<i the Khan of Moghulistan, who agreed to invade Maverannahr, when Sheikh Nureddin was treacherously murdered by one of Shah Rok's generals in

annahr and Turkestan, which he held to the day of his death. He resided at Samarkand. The narrative of Shah Rok's embassy to China reports, that when this embassy from Herat had reached Samarkand in February 1420, Ulug Beg had already before this despatched his own envoys with a company of Khatai people. It seems that the embassy here spoken of is the same as the one recorded in the Ming shi as having acc«)mpanied the Chinese envoy Ch'en Ch'eng when he returned from Samarkand. Ulug

Ch*eng went back to China again, an envoy from Samarkand accompanied him. In 1420 Ch*en Ch*eng was once more despatched to Samarkand, together with another envoy, the eunuch Kuo King. In 1430, in the autumn or winter, envoys with tribute arrived from Samarkand. They had been sent by the chief U-hc Bai Mi-rh-dsa (Ulug Beg Mirza, see note 1069) and other chiefs. In 1432 the eunuch Li Kui was despatched to Samarkand with presents for these chiefs. In 1439 ^ fi°® horse was offered to the emperor by the chief of Samarkand. It was of black colour with a white forehead and white feet. By the emperor's orders a picture of it was made, and it was named shui pao.^^'^^ In 1445, in the tenth month, the emperor wrote the following letter to the Prince of Samarcand, U-lu-Bai Icil-liehan (Ulug Beg gurkan, see note 1059) :

" I am thankful to you, king, that you have sent tribute from so far a country as yours, and in reward I send you some pieces of silk stuff and garments for your wife and children, and as a particular mark of my esteem I add some vessels made of gold and jade, a spear with a dragon's head, a fine horse with saddle, and variegated gold-embroi
dered silk stuffs." In 1456 an embassy from Samarkand with tribute arrived at the capital. The Board of Eites on this occasion made a report to the emperor, stating that it had
Beg was a very learned prince and protector of sciences. Astronomy especially fl(mrished in Samarkand under his reign. In 1420 he constructed at Samarkand an observatory, the most important result of which was the formation of the Zich-i-jedeid-i Gurkhani, or new astronomical tables of Ulug Beg, subsequently in general use among the oriental astronomers for their calculations. (See Sedillot's " Prol^gomfenes des Tables Astronomiques de Oloug Beg," 1847, 1853). Ulug Beg was murdered in 1449 by his son AbduUatif. ^•^^ It seems that Ulug Beg has twice made to the emperor of China a
present of a black horse with white feet. We read in the narrative of Shah Rok's embassy that the envoys saw (in 1420) the Chinese emperor mounted on a tall black horse with white legs, which Mirza Ulug Beg had sent him.



264 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
always been considered a rule to reward generously the envoys and other members of the foreign embassies who presented tribute, but that this abuse ought to be abolished and the return presents reduced. The Board of Eites proposed, amongst others, the following rates to be adopted :

Every horse of the breed called a-lu-gu}^'^^ when presented as tribute, to be estimated as equal to four pieces of variegated velvet and eight garments of cheap silk. Three camels = ten garments of cheap silk.
One Tatar horse {Ta-ta ma) = one piece of hempen cloth and eight pieces of cheap silk. They (the embassy from Samarkand) had also brought jade, but only twenty-four pieces of it, weighing sixty-eight kin, were fit for being worked, whilst the rest, 5900 kin, was of no use. The Board of Rites proposed that they should sell it for their own account, but they solicited from the Board permission to accept it at the rate of one piece of cheap silk for every five kin of jade, to which the Chinese government consented. When the embassy went home, the emperor sent presents for the king of Samarkand,
whose name was Bu-sa-yiny^"*^ In 1457 the emperor sent the tu chi hui Ma Yiln and
1071 jj^, Schefer (Khitay nameh, p. 63) holds that by a-lu-gu the Chinese intend tdagh, post-horse. A-lu-gu horses are also mentioned in the letters addressed to the Ming emperors by princes and envoys from the kingdoms of Central and Western Asia. See Amiot's translation, I. c. It is also not improbable that the Chinese by a-lu-gu ma (the last character means horse in Chinese) intended to render the word arghamak, which is still the oame for Turkoman horses in Samarkand. Compare also the narrative of Shah Rok's embassy to China : The Chinese emperor said to the envoys tliat he had a mind to send to Kara Yussuf (the chief of the Turkomans at that time ; he died in 1 420), and to ask from him some fine raceliorses. ^•""^ At the time here spoken of, Svltan Abu Said reigned in Samarkand. He was a grandson of Mirza Mirau Shah, the third son of Tinmr. Two years after Ulug Beg's death, in 1451, he got possession of Samarkand, where he reigned till 1469, when he undertook an expedition to Azerbeidjan against Uzzan Hassan, the chief of the Turkomans, who made him prisoner and put him to death. About the name Busaid or Busain used for Abu Said, see note 789.

others to the Si yil (western countries). They had also presents for the So-lu-fan Mu-sa^^'^^ who ordered an escort for the imperial envoy when lie went home. So-lu-t'^an (Sultan) in their language means " sovereign," and has the same meaning as K^o-kan (Khan) in Mongol. In 1463 the chi hui Chan Sheng was entrusted with a mission to Samarkand. In the reign of Ch*eng hua (1465-88) the So4u-t^anA-hei•ma^^*^* sent three times tribute to the Chinese court. In 1483 he sent an embassy to China, together with the chief of I-sz-fa-han (Isfahan, see farther on). They carried as presents two lions. ^^^^ When A-hei-ma's envoy had arrived at Su chou he requested a high Chinese officer to be despatched to meet him. The subject was discussed in the oouncil of Chinese ministers, and from various sides it was objected that lions w^ere useless beasts; they could not be employed in sacrifice, while they were also unfit to be put to a cart. Therefore such presents should be refused. But the emperor ordered a eunuch to be sent to meet the lions. The food of these beasts consisted of two living
sheep and two jars of ts^u yii (a kind of sour soup), and two jars of milk with honey every day. The name of the €nvoy from Sa-ma-rh-han was F'^a-liuwan}^'^^ He was not satisfied with the presents he had received from the emperor. When he returned home, the emperor ordered the -eunuch Wei Lo and the master of ceremonies Hai Fin to accompany him. They went not by the usual way, but proceeded to Kuang tung (Canton), where the envoy from Samarkand bought a number of Chinese girls. Wei Lo made Hai Pin responsible for this contravention of the law,

He succeeded his father on the throne of Samarkand, and died in 1493. 1075 The Khitay nameh (Shefer's transl. 63) reports that the Mohammedan merchants who (in the fifteenth century) go to China by the land route usually carry with them for sale lions, onces, and lynxes, for these beasts are highly prized there. 1076 Probably Pchelevan, meaning " valiant " in Persian.

and the latter was accordingly degraded. The envoy then asked permission to proceed by sea-route to Man-la-kia, (Malacca), to buy there a suan i,^^^^ and present it to the emperor, but Wei Lo made objections. (It is not stated whether or not P*a-liu-wan was finally allowed to go home.) In 1489 an envoy from Samarkand arrived at Kuang tung (Canton). He had come by way of Man-la-kia, and brought as tribute a lion and parrots. The governor of Kuang tung reported to Peking on his arrival. The Board of Kites objected that the sea-way was not the regular way for tribute carried from Samarkand, and that besides this, a lion was a beast too dangerous to be kept for pleasure. Its transport to the court would cause great trouble and require considerable expense. The emperor himself had declared that he disliked rare birds as well as strange beasts. But nevertheless presents were bestowed upon th& envoy. In the next year (1490) an envoy from Samarkand arrived together with an embassy from Tu-lu-fan (Turfan), to present a lion and a beast called ha-la-hvr-la}^'*^ When they reached Kan su, pictures were taken of these beasts and sent by a courier to the emperor. The ministers proposed to refuse these presents, but the emperor agreed to receive them. An embassy from Samarkand to the Chinese court is further recorded under the year 1 501, and several embassies from the same country arrived in the reign of Cheng te, 1506-22. When in 1523 an embassy from Samarkand had reached the capital, the Board of Rites laid before the emperor a report, pointing out that the embassies from foreign countries to the Chinese court used to be on their road a whole year, and then spent a considerable time at the capital.
1077 I am not prepared to say what the Chinese author means. Suan t, according to Williams' Dictionary, 273, 833, a fabulous beast like a lion. 1078 The caracal^ Felis caracal, the Asiatic lynx. See I., p. 127.

For the whole time their subsistence was at the charge of tiie kuang lu (banqueting office). As there were no sums for defraying these expenses, it was proposed to change these regulations. The emperor agreed. In 1533 Samarkand sent tribute to the court. The envoy arrived together with embassies from THenfang (Arabia) and T'^u-lu-fan (Turfan). The Chinese government was puzzled by the circumstance that these embassies turned out to have been sent by nearly one hundred rulers, who all called themselves vMng (kings or princes), namely,
fifteen in Turfan, twenty-seven m Arabia, and fifty-three in Samarkand. In the year 1536 the number of kings in the western countries who offer tribute amounted even to more than 1 50. The question whether these titles had to be acknowledged by the Chinese government was much discussed in the council ot ministers, and it was finally decided to title them in the imperial rescripts as they used to call themselves. In the new regulations it was further established that in future i^reigners should not be employed as interpreters, and only Chinese interpreters had to be used. In the reign of Wan li (1573-1620) the intercourse with Samarkand was still animated, for those foreigners liked to carry on trade with the Chinese people. Besides this, it was the custom that when they had entered China, the Chinese government took charge of their maintenance. It had, however, been settled that tribute should be sent from Samarkand only once in five years.^^^® After this historical sketch of Chinese intercourse with Samarkand in the days of the Ming, the Ming shi adds a
^^^ In the very beginning of the sixteenth century the Timurids were expelled from Samarkand by Sheihani Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Uzbeg dynasty in Khovarezm, and of Uzbeg power in Transoxiana (r. siipra, p. 142). It does not seem that the Mohammedan annals posterior to the middle of the fifteenth century mention any diplomatical intercourse between Samarkand and China. The so-called embassies from Samarkand, as recorded in the Chinese annals in tlie sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, bore probably a purely commercial character.



268 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
few details describing the city of Samarkand, the productions and customs of the country, &c. As the information on the same subject found in the Ming Geography is more detailed, I present in the following translation a fusion of these notices given in both works. The Ming Geography draws principally from the above-noticed narrative (see p. 147), Shi Si yii Id, the original of which does not exist at the present time. The kingdom of Samarkand extends for 3000 li from east to west. It consists of vast plains. The soil is fertile. The city in which the king has his residence is 10 li wide and upwards, and its population is densely crowded.^^^
1030 In j^Q^ Clavijo, the Castilian ambassador, visited Samarkand. Schildberger seems to have been there at the same time. Clavijo (165-170) gives some accounts of the capital of Tamerlane. He states that it was a little larger than the city of Sevilla, situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall. Outside the city there were a great number of houses, joined together in many parts so as to form suburbs. The city was surrounded on all sides by gardens and vineyards, which extended in some directions a league and a half, in others two leagues. Amongst these gardens, which were outside, there were great and noble houses, and here the Lord had several palaces. Many streams of water flowed through the city and through these gardens, and among these gardens there are many cotton -plantations and melon-grounds. The land is very plentiful in all things. And the name of Samarcand or Cimesqulnte is derived from the words cimes great and quinte a town {v. supra, p. 59). After Clavijo and Schildberger, for nearly four centuries no European visited Samarkand ; so that Ritter in his "Asia" (1837) could give no information respecting it during that period, except some notices derived from Chinese sources. The first European who, after the Castilian ambassador, saw Samarkand, was the Russian subaltern Yefremof. He was made prisoner in 1774 by the Kirghizes at the frontier south of Orenburg, and sold to a Beg in Bokhara, but he at length succeeded in escaping, and fled westward to Samarkand, Khokand, Marghilan, where he passed for a Nogai Tartar. Here he joined a caravan which was going to Kashgar, and from Yarkand took the route to India via Tibet and Delhi. Having reached Calcutta, he embarked for Europe, reached London, and in August 1782 St. Petersburg, where he published the narrative of his peregrinations. For the first authentic account of Saniarkand (Yefremof devotes only a few words to this city) we are indebted to the members of a Russian scientific expedition sent to Transoxiana in 1841. See vol. i. p. 78.
We learn from Professor Vambery's " Travels in Central Asia " that the author visited the celebrated city of Samarkand in 1863, of which he gives a detailed description. But when a few years later the Russians took pos

In the south-western part of the city numerous stores of various kinds of merchandise are found. The city is known also under the name of " city of abundance." In tlie north-eastern part of it there is a beautiful buildin.ij set apart for praying to Heaven. The pillars of it are all of ts'ing ski (blue stone), with engraved figures. There is in this building a hall where the sacred book is explained.^®^^
session of Samarkand (ist of May 1868), and the city became as well known as any other city of the Russian empire, serious doubts were raised whether the Professor's description of the ruins of Samarkand were really founded on personal observation. On the Russian map of Samarkand the walled city is represented as an oblique, somewhat irrtjgular square, each side measuring about two English miles. There can be no doubt that modem Samarkand {i.e., the Mohammedan city^ for the Russians have built a new city to the north-west) is the same as the city of Timur, which is proved by the ruins of the buildings erected by Timur being all comprised in the modern city. The Ark, or citadel, situated on the western limit of the city, on a hill, was built by order of Timur in 1370, immediately after his accession to the throne of
Maverannahr. We read in the Zafer nameh, ii, 2, that Timur, after making Samarkand the capital of his empire, caused the walls of the city to be repaired and a fortress to be erected. He built stately palaces and neat public e(iifices. Ibid, vi. 26, s. a. 1404: Timur went from the College of Serai Mulk Khanum to the Arek (citadel), and lodged at gheuk Serai (blue palac*?), a palace he had built. This blue palace is, I have no doubt, the edifice in the citadel which contains the celebrated gheuk task or blue stone. Vambery (205) calls it the reception-hall of Timur. In the northern part of the city, not far from the northern wall, are the ruins of the Medresseh (College) i Khanym, which, according to Khanykoff and Vambery, was built by a Chinese princess, wife of Timur. I have already proved (see note 1059) that this princess. Serai Mulk Khanum, was the daughter of Kazan Khan of Turkestan and Maverannahr, not of the Chinese emperor. The College of Serai Mulk Khanum is repeatedly mentioned in the Zafer nameh. It was opposite the Great Mosque, finished in 1404 (see note 1081). Professor Vambery describes the Medresseh i Khanym from his own observation, strange to say, as situated near the Dervazei Bokhara (south-western gate), whilst on the map, and according to all the Russian explorers who have described the ruins of Samarkand (Khanykofif, Lehmann, Fedchenko, Dr. Radloff, (fee), it lies near the northern gate, Shah Zindeh. In the Zafer nameh this gate is called Sheikh Zade, and repeatedly noticed. I may finally mention the most interesting of the ancient monuments within the city of Samarkand, the celebrated Sepulchre of Timur, which lies in its southern part. Compare also about Samarkand note 197, 1081 The Chinese reporter saw probably the Great Mosque, the most magnificent of the buildings erected by Timur. The foundation of it was

This sacred book is written in gold characters, the cover being made of sheep's leather. The king wears a white round cap, his wives wind about their heads white silk stuffs. The people are handsome and skilful. The customs and the productions of Samarkand resemble those of Ha-lie (Herat). The use of wine is prohibited, and it is not allowed to sell it in the market. For their beverage and- food the people like sour and sweet things. They mix their broth with rice and meat. Their vessels are of gold and silver. They do not use chopsticks (to take up food with them) nor spoons, but take their food up with their fingers. When they kill oxen or sheep they bury the blood in the ground .^^^^ jj^ trade they use silver coins minted in the country. The following products are enumerated :

Fine horses, single-humped camels, broad-tailed sheep. Lions are met in the reed-jungles near the river A-mu, When they come into the world they have their eyes closed for the first seven days. The people there take advantage of this time to catch the young lions. It is impossible to tame them when they are more developed.^^^ Gi-bi-sz-tan, a tree the leaves of which resemble the leaves of the shan cKa (camellia), whilst the fruit is similar to that of the yin King (Salisburia adiantifolia), but a little

laid in the spring of 1399, after Timur's return from the expedition to India. It was built opposite the College of Serai Mulk Khanum (see note 1080), and finished in 1404. The Zafer nameh (iv. 34, vi. 24) gives a <ietailed description of this beautiful n^osque, which now seems to have -entirely disappeared. Vambery (1. c. 205), giving a short description of the Mosque of Timur from his own observation, states that it lies on the south side of the city ; but neither Dr. Radloff, who describes in detail the ruins of Samarkand, nor other Russian explorers of its remainsj mention thia moscjue. 1082 rpj^jg -g g^jj2 the custom with the butchers in Persia.

When moistening these dishes with water, meat can be eaten in them without using salt^^^ Besides this, gold, silver, copper, iron, and jade are found in this country. East of the city of Samarkand there is a river called Ila-la-hvAan. It is shallow but broad, and flows northward. To the east, the country of Samarkand borders upon Sha-ht-hai-yu (Shahrokia), Ta-shi-gan (Tashkend), Sai-lan (Sairam), Yang-i (Yanghikend). West of Samarkand are K^o-shi (Kesh) and T^ie-li-mi (Termed). All these places (or countries) depend on Samarkand. I may finally notice that in Amiot's translation of letters, &c., there are five addressed to the Ming emperors by envoys from Samarkand.
BU-HUA-RH (BOKHAKA).
Bu-hua-rh is situated more than 700 li north-west of Samarkand. The city lies in a plain, and is 10 li and more in circumference (erroneous figure). The population numbers 10,000 families, and has the repute of great wealth. The land is low and the climate warm. The country produces the five kinds of corn, mulberry trees, silk, hemp, the six kinds of domestic animals, and is very
rich. After this the mission of CJien CUeng (see p. 147) is reported with some details. In 1432 Z^ Ta (see p. 148) visited Bu-hua-rh.
1084 Chardin, iii. 358, reports that the stone salt of Persia is so hard that the poor men build their houses of it.

HEI-LOU (KHORASSAN ?).
Hei-lou is Dot far from Samarkand. These two countries have always been allied by marriages (of their rulers). The mountains, rivers, plants, birds, and beasts of Hei-lou are all of a black colour. Even the men and women there are black.ios^
In 1432 an embassy from this country airived with tribute to the Chinese court. In 1437 another embassy was sent to China by the king of Hei-lou, called Sha-ha-lvr So'lu-fan (Shah Eok Sultan). At the head of this embassy was the chi hui Ha-dji Ma-hei-ma (Hadji Mahmud). He presented tribute and received presents for his sovereign. In 1 44 1 again an embassy from Hei-lou arrived, and in 1453 ^^ embassy from that country reached the capital, together with (a caravan of) thirty-one neighbouring tribes (cities), comprising more than 100 men and women. They presented as tribute 247 horses, 12 mules, 10 donkeys, 7 camels, besides jade, sal ammoniac, fine swords made of
jpin fie (steel).
In 1463 the king of Hei-lou, by name Mu-sai-i,'^^^^ sent his clii hui ts*ien shi Ma-hei-ma She-rh-han and others, with tribute to the emperor. The envoy received presents for his sovereign, and was himself rewarded, and raised to the rank of chi hui t*ung chi. The seven officers who had come with him were all raised to higher ranks. In 1483 an embassy from Hei-lou arrived together with the envoys from Shi-la-sz' (Shiraz), Samarkand, and Badan-sha (Badakhshan). Tliey carried lions as presents.
1085 rpj^e statements are altogether absurd. Hei in Chinese means black, but Hei-lou is not a Chinese name ; it seems to be intended to render the name of Khorassan or Herat, as appears from the mentioning of Shah Rok as the ruler of this country. The Ming shi, however, has yet another article devoted to Herat, where this city is termed Ha-Ue (see farther on). io8« It seems to me that here again Sultan Abu Said of Samarkand (eee note 1 072) is mer.nt. In 1 458 he had taken also possession of Herat and Khorassan, and ruled over this province to the day of his death iu
1469.

The name of the ruler of Ba-dau-sha (at that time) was So-lu-t^an Ma-hei-ma}^"^ Once more an embassy from Hei-lou is recorded under the year 1490. It reached the court at the same time as an embassy from T'ien fang (Arabia) and several other embassies. They brought as tribute camels, horses, and

K'O-SHI (KESH OR KASH).
K*o-shi is situated south-west of Sa-ma-rh-han, 360 li distant from this city. The city of K*o-shi, which is 10 li in circumference, lies in the middle of great villages. There are fine palaces and a beautiful temple. The pillars of it are of jade ; the walls, doors, and windows are adorned with gold, precious stones, and coloured glass. In times past the ruler of Samarkand /^^ ma THe-mu-rh (see note 1059) used to reside in this city. Outside of it there are fields irrigated by water.

Shehr-i-sebz. On modern maps it is generally called Sliehr. We read in the Zafer nameh, i. 4 : When Timur had become absolute master of Maverannahr in 1360, he took up his abode in the city of Kesh^ called also Shehr scbz, or verdant city. Ibid. ii. 28 : Kesh, called also Sheher sebzj the green city, because of the verdure and freshness of its gardens, and a meadow famous for its rare and curious plants, was the place where the most learned doctors of the Mohammedan law assembled. At the same time men of learning came from all parts to this city. Since the end of 781, Heg. (March 1380) Timur made it his ordinary residence in summer, and declared it the second seat of the empire ; wherefore he built there new walls and a new palace, which he named Akserai, because the walls were white. All the sherifs, doctors, and learned men from Khovarezm, after the capture of the capita] (in 1379) were sent to Kesh, as also the tradesmen. Timur was charmed with the beauty of this city, the purity of the air in the surrounding plains, the goodness of the water, the deliciousness of its
gardens. Baber in his "Memoirs," i. 105, 106, gives the following notice

274 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
to the west (should be south) the traveller reaches a great imposing mountain, with a defile through it. One might think that it had been cut artificially. At the exit of the defile, which is 2 or 3 li long, and has a direction from east to west, there is a stone gate. The colour of the stones is that of iron. For this reason the people of the country call this gate T'ie men kican (Iron gate).^^^^ A military post has been established there. There is a tradition that Tai tsu of the Yuan (Chinghiz Khan) met here an animal with one horn.^^^
Avith respect to this city :

Kesh is situated south of Samarkand, at the distance of nine igadj. Between the two cities lies a hill called Amak dayan, from which all the stones brought to the city are quarried. In the spring the plains, the town of Kesh, the walls and terraces of the houses, are all green and cheerful, whence it is named Shehr-i-sebz. At Kesh was the place of Timur's nativity ; he raised there vast buildings. Clavijo, who passed through Kesh in 1404, gives (p. 123) a detailed description of Kesh and the beautiful country around it. He speaks also of a grand mosque which Timur had ordered to be built, which then was not yet finished, within which the body of his father was interred. Timur hg,d ordered another great chapel to be built for his own body. The first-born son of Timur was also interred in this mosque, named Jehanghir. Comp. Zafer nameh, ii. 18, about the magnificent mausoleum erected in Kesh for the body of the deceased prince Jehanghir. The city of Shehr (anciently Kesh) now belongs to the Khanate of Bokhara. It lies about four English miles south-west of the city of Kitab, founded in the middle of the last century. When, in 1870, Kitab for a time was occupied by Russian troops, Mr. Kuhn visited Shehr, and in 1880 published in the "Memoirs of the Russian Geogr. Soc," vi. p. 203, an interesting article on his explorations. The ruins of Timur's palace, Akserai, can still be seen there, as also the remains of four other buildings of the time of Timur. The Russian expedition to Kabul in 1878 passed through Shehr. Yavor!>ky (i. 371, ii. 31) speaks of the beautiful gardens and the splendid vegetation around and within the city. The ancient name of Kesh or Kash has survived in the name of the river Kashka daria, on which the city is situated. 1^*89 Compare about the Iron gate note 21 1. This celebrated defile, through which the road from Samarkand southward to the Jihiin, and farther to Balkh and Kabul leads, is frequently mentioned in the Zafer nameh, and termed there Derbend aheny (Iron gate in Persian), or Kolu' gha. Sometimes the latter name is also written Khulkc or Kehulkeh (i. 5, iii. 2, iv. 33, vi, 23). Kolugha had, it seems, the same meaning in the Djagatai Turki dialect as derbend, i.e., gate. In Mongol, Khalga means a mountain pass, a gate. 1090 About this legend see.i. p. 289, and note 696.

TIE-LI-MI (TERMED).
This place lies south-west of Sa-ma-rh-han, 2000 /land upwards distant from Ha-lie (Herat). There is an old and a new city at a distance of more than 10 li between them. The population of the city and its neighbourhood consists of only several hundred families, who are engaged in the breeding of cattle. The city of T*ic-li-mi is situated east of the river A-mu, which abounds with fish. The country east of the river belongs to Samarkand. To the west are vast forests (jungles) of lu (reeds), in which lions
are met with.^^^^ Clien CKeng and Li Ta (Chinese envoys, see pp. 147,
148) visited T*ie-li-mi.
AN-DU-HUAI (ANDKHUI).
This place is situated 13GO li north-west (should be Dorth-east) df Ha-lie (Herat), and at the same distance south-east (south-west) of Samarkand. The city is surrounded by great villages, and is more than 10 li in circumference. It lies in a fertile, well-watered, and well
1091 The Chinese account of T"ie-li-'mi evidently refers to Termed, but
the Chinese author is mistaken with respect to its position. We have to read north for east, and south for west. About the early history of Termed see p. 63. Termed is frequently mentioned in the Zafer nameh. The name is written also Termez. Timur in his expeditions from Samarkand to Herat and Persia generally proceeded by way of Kesh and the
Iron gate, and crossed the Amu River or Jihun at Termed on a bridge of boats (Zafer nameh, i. 8, 22, il 31, 43, 48, iii. 2, iv. 2, 32, &c.). In Timur's Autobiogr., 53, we read that Timur in 1361 took possession of Old Ttrniez. De Guignes, "Huns," v.- 80, states (evidently on the authority of a Mohammedan author) that in 1407 Khalil Sultan ordered the city of Termed to be rebuilt at a distance of one parasang from the old city. Clavijo (118, 119), who travelled by the great highway leading from Persia to Samarkand, after crossing the great river Viadme (Oxus), arrived at a great city called Termit, which once belonged to India the Less, but was then belonging to Timur, who had conquered it, and from this place the empire of Samarkand began. Clavijo further reports that the bridge over the river at this place was only for the use of Timur, and when he had passed from one side to the other the people had to break it off.

place. Between 1400 and 141 6 An-du-huai used to send tribute together with Ha-lie (Herat), but afterwards the intercourse with this place was not continued.^*^
BA-DA-HEI-SHANG (BADAKHSHAN).
Ba-da-hei-shang is situated norfeh-east of An-du-huai, The city is 10 li and more in circumference.^^^ The country is vast. There are no obstacles on the route (notwithstanding the high mountains the traveller has to cross). The mountains and the rivers present beautiful scenery. The people are peaceable there. Many towers are seen in the country. The merchants from the Si yil (Central and Western Asia) and those from the Si yang (Western Sea, i.e.y Indian, Arabian ports, &c.) all come to this country to traffic. For this reason the people of Ba-da-hei-shang arevery wealthy.
1092 rpjjg ^jn-y q£ Andhui or Andktui still exists in Khorassan, and, as theChinese author correctly observes, it lies midway between Samarkand and Herat. Vambery ("Gesch. Bochara's," &c., i. p. xxx.) suggests that Andkud may have been founded by the Mongols, the name being of Mongol origin, and meaning "united happiness." But the learned Professor i* mistaken in his supposition. Although Andkud is not a very ancient city,. the name does not appear in the early Arab geographers ; it existed, however, in the middle of the twelfth century, long before the name of the Mongols became known in Western Asia. Yakut (Barbier de Meynard, "Diet. Perse," 54) mentions Endekhud, a city between Merv and Balkh, and notices a celebrated jurist who died in this city about the middle of the twelfth century. It was near Endekhod that the army of Sultan Shihab-eddin of Gur was destroyed by Sultan Mohammed of Khovarezm (d'Ohsson, i. 188). This happened towards the end of the twelfth century. The name of Andekud occurs frequently in the Zafer nameh, and in the history of Shah Rok. On modern maps the name is always written Andhui. i<»^ According to Colonel Yule (" M. Polo," i. 164), the ancient capital of Badakhshan stood in the plain of Baharak, east of Faizabad, the modem, capital. This city of Badakhshan is also mentioned in the Zafer nameh, i. 24. Timur, having defeated the princes of Badakhshan in 1 368, remained in the city of Badakhshan, and ratified a peace there between the princes, and the Amir Hussein.



i5&i6cENT.] BADAKHSHAN. 277
At first (i.e.y when the Chinese intercourse with Badakhshan began, under the Ming), the son of Sha-ha-lu (Shah Rok) was the chief of Ba-da-hei-shang.^^ In 1408 the emperor Yung lo sent the eunuchs Fa T'^ai and Li Ta with a letter and presents to the chief of Ba-da-hei-sliang. These envoys had received orders to visit also the countries of Ha-shi'ha-rh (Kashgar) and Ko-i'c-lang^'^^ and to recommend to the rulers of these countries the protection of the merchants passing through their dominions. And since that time the intercourse of the distant countries with China through Badakhshan has met with no difficulties. In 1414 CKen CEeng was sent to this country, and in 1420 an embassy with tribute from Badakhshan arrived at Peking, together with the embassy from Ha-lie (Herat).^*^ When these envoys returned to their countries, they were accompanied by CJien CKeng and the eunuch Kvx) King. In 1 46 1 the prince (wang) of Badakhshan, by name Ma-ha-ma}^ sent an embassy with tribute to the Chinese
1094 During the reign of Timur, <Badakhshan was ruled by its own princes, who acknowledged the supremacy of Timnr. In 1412 the prince of Badakhshan revolted against Shah Rok, who sent his son Ibrahim Sultan thither, who reduced the rebel to obedience. In 141 7 Shah Rok entrusted his son Siurgatmish with the government of Badakhshan. ^^^ Kkod or Khotelan, a name not found on modem maps, was applied in ancient times to a country on the Upper Jihun, north of Badakhshan. Ibn Haukal, quoted by Abulfeda, II. ii. 229, couples it with the country of Wakhsh, and states that Khotal is situated between the river Wakhshab and the river Badakhshan, called also Djariab. Compare also about Khotelan Yule's " Cathay," ccxxxv. Khotlan is frequently mentioned in the Zafer nameh. At first it was ruled, like Badakhshan, by its own princes, but subsequently Timur annexed it to the dominions of his grandson, Pir Mohammed Jehanghir, who ruled over Balkh, Kabul, Ghaznin, &c. 1096 This embassy from Badakhshan is noticed in the narrative of Shah Rok's embassy to China. 1097 J have not been able to make out from Mohammedan sources who ruled in Badakhshan in 1461. But the So-lu t'an Ma-hei-ma of Badakhshan, who, according to the Chinese annals, sent an embassy in 1483 (». supra, p. 273), was without doubt Sultan Mahmud, the second son of the unfortunate Sultan Abu Said. As Mirkhond reports, he took possession after the death of his father in 1469 of Hissar, Badakhshan, Kondez, Bakalan, &c. Sultan Mahmud died iu 1494.

Ha-lie, called also Hei-lu}^^ is situated 3000 li southwest of Samarkand, and is distant from Kia yil kuan (at the Chinese frontier) 12,000 li. It is a large kingdom in the Si yil. When THc-mu-rh, ihefu ma of the Yilan (Mongol dynasty ),^^^ ruled in Samarkand, he sent his son Sha-halu ^^^ to occupy Ha- lie. During the reign of the emperor Hung wu (1368-99) Samarkand and Bie-shi-ba-li (Moghulistan) used to send tribute to the Chinese court, but owing to the great distance no embassy from Ha-lie was seen in China at this period. In 1392 the emperor despatched to the ruler of Ha-lie an officer with a letter and presents, consisting of gold-embroidered silk, &c. But this officer did not reach

In 1397 his father gave him during his life the propriety of the kingdom of Khorassan, and Shah Rok establi^^hed his residence at Herat (Zafer nameh, iii. 67). After Timur's death in 1405, he mounted as independent sovereign the throne of Herat. Shah Rok died in 1447 at Rei. ^^"^ At the beginning of Timur's career Herat was ruled by princes of the Kurt dynasty. In 1381 Timur took Herat from Pir Ali, the last ruler of this dynast}', and constituted his son, Mirza Miran Shah, governor of Herat and Khorassan. But this prince was only for a short time there (Zafer uameh, ii. 31-33). In 1397 Shah Rok was ruler of Herat.

When Yung lo had ascended the throne (in 1403), he sent an officer with a letter and presents to the king of Ha-lie. But the latter did not send any embassy to China. In 1407 the embassies headed by An and by Chen Te wen returned. The latter, a man from Pao ch*ang liien (Kuang tung province), reported that the king of Ha-lie had sent tribute to China, but that owing to the great distance this embassy had not reached the court. Chen Te wen had gathered on his way some information about the customs of the countries seen by him, and presented his notices in the form of a poem to the emperor, who was much delighted, and promoted him in rank. In 1408 An was again entrusted with a mission to the west. He bore a letter and presents for Slia-ha-ho Badu-rh (Shah Rok Bahadur), ruler of Ha-lie ; ^^^^ and when An returned he was accompanied by an envoy of Shall a-lu, carrying with him tribute. (The Ming Geography calls this envoy the chieftain Mo-lai.) They arrived at the Chinese capital in 1409, where the embassy was well received. In 14 10 another enyoy from Ha-lie arrived.
"°' We find ample corroboration for the Chinese records regarding the political intercourse between China and Herat in the fifteenth century in the life of Shah Rok, as recorded by Abder-razzak (see p. 153). These details were translated more than a century ago by Chambers, and are found also in Quatreniere's translation of the ^ame author in the "Not. et Extr.," XIV. i. (I043). My quotations in the subsequent pages refer
to W. Chambers' article, "An Account of Embassies and Letters that passed between the Emperor of China and Sultan Shah Rokh, son of Amir Timur," the ** Asiatic Miscellany," i. 1785, Calcutta, p. 71 seq. Abder-rezzak records :

When the Khakan {i.e.. Shah Rok) returned from his expedition to Seistan (he returned on the 17th January 1409), ambassadors who had been sent by the Emperor of China to condole with him on the death of his father arrived with a variety of presents, and represented what they had to say on the part of their monarch. The Khakan, after showing them many favours and civilities, dismissed them. This seems to refer to the mission of An, which departed from China in 1408. In the article Samarkand, however (see p. 262), it is stated that Bo-a-rh-hin t'ai was sent to offer sacrifices in memory of Timur.

Sha-ha-lu was on bad terms with Ha-li, the son of his elder brother, Timur's successor. They attacked each other.^i^^ Therefore, when tlie envoy of Ha-lie returned home, the emperor sent the tu chi hui Bo-a-rh-hin fai (repeatedly mentioned in connection with missions to the west) to Sha-ha-lu with a letter of the following tenor :

"Heaven has created men and appointed rulers to govern them. They (i.e., the ruler and the people) have mutual duties. I am i-uling now over China, and look upon all nations with benevolence. I make no difference between near and far countries. I have sent several times envoys to you, and accordingly you have done your duty in sending me your tribute. Your people in the west enjoyed peace and were happy. I was also much satisfied by your zeal. But subsequently I was informed that you are living in discord with your nephew ffa-li (Khalil Sultan), and make mutually war one on another. (Do not forget that) only when living in harmony relatives are able to stand up against outward enemies. When near relatives thus quarrel, how shall the distant relatives live in harmony with you ? You must cease to make war, render peace to the people, and maintain the kindred bonds. Then you will enjoy the happiness of peace." ^^^ The emperor wrote a letter of the same tenor to ffa-li
"^^^ Indeed Shah Rok marched out twice, in 1405 and 1406, from Herat against Mirza Khalil Sultan, who after the death of Timur had usurped the throne of Samarkand, but they made peace before their armies had encountered each other. Khalil Sultan was dethroned in 1409. See note 1067. 1104 "j^ig letter, addressed by the Chinese emperor to Shah Rok, which I have translated from the Ming shi, presents a peculiar interest, the original of it having been translated nearly five hundred years ago into Persian, which translation has been preserved in Abder-razzak's Matlaassaadein. This Persian version, turned into English by Chambers {L c), proves that the Ming shi gives only an abstract of this letter. We read in the above mentioned Persian historical record :

They were all much delighted, and they all dispatched embassies, which arrived
and Machin (Southern Cliina) * and all those countries, arrived at Herat. (Detailed description of the festivities and solemnity ordered by Shah Rok on this occasion.) His Majesty, with a splendour like the sun, ascended his throne and bestowed upon the chief of his lords and on the ambassadors the hapj)iness of kissing his hand. The latter, after offering him their presents, delivered their message. The letter they brought from the Emperor of China was as follows :

" The Great Emperor Day Ming sends this letter to the country of Samarkand to Shah Rokh Bahadur. '• As we consider that the Most High God has created all things that are in heaven and on earth, to the end that all his creatures may be happy, and that it is in consequence of his sovereign decree that we are become Lord of the face of the earth, f we therefore endeavour to exercise rule in obedience to his commands ; and for this reason we make no partial distinction between those that are near and those that are far off, but regard them all with an eye of equal benevolence. " We have heard, before this, that thou art a wise and an excellent man, highly distinguished above others ; that thou art obedient to the com)nand of the Most High God ; that thou art a father to thy people and thy troops, and art good and beneficent towards all ; which has given us much satisfaction. But it was with singular pleasure we observed that when we sent an ambassador with kimkhas and torkos + and a dress, thou didst ])ay all due honour to our command, and didst make a proper display of the favour thou hadst received, insomuch that small and great rejoiced at it. Thou didst also forthwith dispatch an ambassador to do us homage, and to present us the rarities, horses, and choice manufactures of that country. So that with the strictest regard to the truth, we can declare that we have deemed thee worthy of praise and of distinction.

Most High God and did homage to our great Emperor Tay zuy* nor did he omit to send ambassadors with presents. He (the Emperor) for this reason granted protection to the men of that country and enriched theui all. We have now seen that thou art a worthy follower of thy father in
his noble spirit and in his measures. We have therefore sent Duji-chnn' bay-azkasay and Harara Suchu and Danching Sadasun Kunchi f with con
gratulations and a dress and kiiukhas and torgos. We shall hereafter send persons whose office it will be to go and return successively, in order to keep open a free communication, that merchants may traffic and carry on their business to their wish. " Khalil Sultan is thy brother's son ; it is necessary that thou treat him with kindness, in consideration of his rights as being the son of so near a relation. We trust that thou wilt pay attention to our sincerity and to our advice in these matters. This is what we make known to thee !
"
Another letter, Abder-razzak adds, was sent with the presents, and contained a particular account of them, besides one calculated to serve as a pass, which was to remain with the ambassadors. Each was written in the Persian language and eharacter, as well as in the Turkish language with the Moghul character, and likewise in the language and character of China. His Majesty attended to the letter, and apprehended its meaning with his usual penetration ; and when he had understood the 'objects of the embassy, he gave his assent to them all, and then gave orders that the Lords should entertain the ambassadors. After the affairs of the Chinese ambassadors were settled, they had an audience of leave and set out on their return. Sheikh MoJiammed Bakshy accompanied them as envoy on the part of His Majesty, and as the emperor of China had not yet assented to the Mussulman faith, nor regulated his conduct by the law of the Koran, His Majesty, from motives of friendship, sent him a letter of good advice in Arabic and Persian, conceiving that perhaps the Emperor might be prevailed upon to embrace the faith. (These letters have also been translated by Chambers, but they are of little interest.) ]i05 About the lions and other beasts brought by the Mohammedan merchants and envoys to China, see note 1075. I^ t^® narrative of Shah Rok's embassy a lion is also noticed among the presents carried along for the Chinese emperor.

^^°* Abder-razzak, I. c. : Day Ming Khan, Emperor of China, having a<]:ain sent ambassadors to His Majesty (Shah Rok), they arrived in ^May 14 1 7 at Herat. The chiefs of them were Bihachin, Tubachin, and Jatbachin (Quatreniere reads: Matchin, Toumatchin, Djatmatchin), who came attended by three hundred horse, and brou^^ht with them an abundance of rarities and presents, such as shotikars (gerfalcons), damasks, khimka stuffs, vessels of China ware. They brought also royal presents for each of the princes and the agas. With them came a letter, the contents of which consisted generally of an enumeration of past favours and civilities, and of expressions of confidence in the future continuance of His Majesty's friendship. The points more particularly insisted on were, that both parties should strive to remove all constraint arising from distance of place and a diveisity of manners, and to open wide the doors of agreement and union, that the subjects and merchants of both kingdoms might enjoy a free and unrestrained intercourse with each other, and the roads to be kept open and unmolested. Moreover, as, on occasion of the first embassy to China, the Amir Seid Ahmed Tarkhan had sent the Emperor a white horse, that animal had, it seems, prbved particularly agreeable to him, and he now sent that lord a number of things in return, together with a picture of the horse drawn by a Chinese painter, with a groom on each side holding his bridle. The ambassadors were handsomely entertained, and at length, as on former occasions, received their dismission, when the Khakan (Shah Rok) sent Ardashir Tavasky back with tliem to China. "''^ Abder-razzak reports s. a. 822 h. (1419): Ardashir, who had been sent to China, returned from there, and gave His Majesty an account of that country and of the approach of a new embassy.

" The great Emperor of Day Ming sends this letter to Sultan Shah
Rokh. We conceive that the Most High has made you knowing, and wise, and perfect, that the kingdom of the Islamites may be well governed, and it is owing to this that the men of that kingdom are become pros])erous. Your Majesty is of an enlightened mind, skilful, accomplished, and judicious, and superior to all the Islamites. You honour the commands of the Most High, and you reverence the things that relate to him, which is the way to enjoy his protection. " We on a former occasion sent Amir Seyray Lida t with others as our ambassadors, who arrived at Your Majesty's court, and you were pleased to receive them with much honour and ceremony, which Lida and the rest represented to us. Your ambassadors, Beg Buka and the others, also arrived here with Lida and the rest on their return, and delivered at this court all the presents of onces, lynxes, and Arabian horses, and other things which you sent ns. We viewed them all. You have on this occasion displayed the sincerity of your affection, and we are exceedingly sensible of your kindness. The western country which is -the seat of Islamism has from old time been famous for producing wise and good men, but it is probable that none have been superior to Your Majesty. Well may we afford protection and encouragement to the men of that country, for we deem it consonant to the will of Heaven that we should do so. Indeed, how should not the Most High be well pleased with those men who practise mutual afifection, where one heart reflects the sentiments of another, as mirror opposed to mirror, and that though at a distance ! In the eye of friendship, generosity and civility are precious above all things, but even in these also there is something more particularly so. We now send Uchang-ku and others, in company with your ambassadors Beg Buka and the rest, who will deliver to Your Majesty our presents, consisting of seven shonkars (gerfalcons), each of which we have flown with our own hands, and kimkhas, &c. The shonkars are not produced in this our Empire of China ; they are constantly brought us as rarities from the sea-coast, so that we have plenty of them, but in that country of yours it' seems they are scarce. + We have sent you choice ones, such as might be deemed worthy the great soul of Your Majesty.

and Ba-da-hei-shen (Badakhshan), and in 1422 Ha-lie sent another envoy, who arrived together with the envoy
of Yit-tHcn. The emperors Jen tsung (1425-26) and Silan tsung (1426-36) generally did not pay much attention to distant countries and were not in the habit of sending envoys abroad, on which account embassies from those countries
trust they will be acceptable to Your Majesty. Henceforth it is requisite that the sincerity of our friendship be increased, and that ambassadors and merchants be always passing and repassing between us without interruption, to the end that our subjects may all live in. plenty, ease, and security. We may then assuredly hope that the. Most High will make usexperience more of his goodness and mercy. " This is wliat we have thought proper to write to you." Each time that letters from the Emperor of China were thus brought to His Majesty there were three, and each was written in three different sorts of character : that is to say, first in the vulgar character, in Avhich we now write, and in the Persian language ; secondly, in the Moghul character, which is that of the Yegurs (Uighurs), and in the Turkish language ; and thirdly, in the Chinese character and language. But thepurport was exactly the same in all. There was another letter which contained a particular account of the things sent, whether living creatures or other rarities, and was written in like manner in three languages and characters. And there was likewise a letter to answer the purpose of a pass. The dates of months and years inserted in each were those of the Emperor's reign. The above English translation from.Abder-razzak's Matla-assaadein by Chambers has been copied from the "Asiatic Miscellany." Quatreraere, who translates the same work, gives some additional information about the same Chinese embassy [1. c. p. 305). On the last day of the month ot Redjeb 822 (August 22, 1419), the ambassadors of Khata, accompanied by Ardeshir, arrived at Samarkand, and offered magnificent presents to Mirza Ulug Beg, who entertained thenk handsomely, and then they departed for Khorassan. In the same year, in October, the ambassadors of Khata, on their way home, visited again Mirza Ulug Beg in Samarkand. On the 9th of September 1420 Abuka (it seems the Beg Buka noticed in. the emperor's letter) and Pulad Timur arrived from China with a great, train and were well received. 1108 This was the famous embassy of Shak Rok to the Chinese emperor, a detailed narrative of which has been preserved in the Matla-assaadein {v. suproif p. 153). This embassy left Herat on December 5, 1419, arrived at Samarkand, February 6, 1420, where they were joined by the ambassadors from Badakhshan and others. They reached Peking, December 14, 1420, and stayed there till May 142 1, when they set out for their homeward journey. They reached Herat, September 2, 1422.

were seldom seen in China during their reigns. However in 1427 one of the chieftains of Ila-lie, by name Da-lahan I-bu-la (Tarkhan Ibrahim ?), presented horses as tribute, and in 1432 the emperoi despatched the eunuch Li Kui to the countries of the West, and entrusted him also witli a mission to Sha-ha-lu (Shah Eok), to whom he had written the following letter :

" In times past, after my ancestor T'ai tsung wen huang li (Yung lo 1403-25) had mounted the throne, you and the rulers of other countries used to send embassies with tribute to the Chinese court. Having respectfully accepted the throne from Heaven, I now rule over the ten thousand kingdoms. For my reign I have adopted the name Silan te, and taking an example of the glorious reign of my ancestor, I look upon the people indiscriminately with benevolence. Previously I sent you a letter and presents, but owing to some hindrances on the way, my envoy did not reach you. Now, as the communication has been reestablished, I send you my adjutant with a letter, in which I express you my thoughts, and invite you to sustain amicable intercourse with us, that we may constitute one family. May the tradesmen of our countries travel and traffic as they like. Will that not be an excellent thing ?
"
Li Kui had not yet reached Ha-lie, when an envoy from that country by name Fa-liu-rh-ding (Fakhr-eddin) arrived at the Chinese capital, where he died in the- official lodging-place. He was buried by imperial order with the
marks of honour due to his position. Another embassy from Ha-lie, bringing with him camels, horses, jade, &c., accompanied Li Kui when he returned to China, and when this embassy went home, in the next year in the spring, Li Kui accompanied it again to bestow presents on the king of Ha-lie and some of his chieftains. They reached Ha-lie in the autumn of the same year. Under the year 1438 again an embassy from Ha-lie to the Chinese court is recorded. (The Ming Geography calls the head of this mission chi hui Ha-dji.)

As Yioiff tsunfj (1436-50) was under age when lie was placed on the throne, and as the ministers neglected tlie intercourse with the foreigners, tribute-bearers arrived only in small number. In 1457, when Ying tsung had ascended the throne for the second time (he was kept prisoner by the Mongols for nearly two years, see p. 166), he decided to re-establish the former intercourse with the Si yil, and in 1463 sent a number of military officers with letters and presents for the foreign rulers of the various countries. The tu chi hui Hai Yung and the chi hui Ma Ts^uan were despatched to Ha-lie, but this country sent no more embassies to China.^^^

This place is once mentioned in the Zafer nameh (vi. 45), and several times in the Matla-assaadeiu. ^^^^ The dynasty of the Mozafferids reigned in Fars (Shiraz) when Timur invaded Persia in 1387 and 1392. After the destruction of this dynasty, Timur, in 1393, conferred the government of Fars on his son Mirza Omar Sheikh, and after the death of this prince in 1394 on Omar's son, Pir Mohammed. The latter was assassinated in 1410, and his brother, M. Eskender, obtained the government of Fars. This prince revolted against Shah Rok, was defeated, and Shah Rok in 1414 appointed his second son, Mirza Ibrahim Sultan, to the government of Fars. Ibrahim, who liad his residence at Shiraz, died there in 1435. In 1452 Sultan Baber of Herat took possession for a short time of Shiraz. He was expelled from there by the Turkomans.

At that time China was waging war in the north (with the Mongols), and was therefore in want of horses. Accordingly Shi-la-sz', Samarkand, and the other countries were induced to send horses as tribute. In 1423, in the eighth month, the envoy from Shi-la-sz' had an audience of the emperor at his travelling palace at Silan hua fu}^^"^ He was kindly received and richly
rewarded, and then proceeded to Peking. A number of his followers remained (or were retained) in China. It was not till after Jen tsung's accession to the throne (1425) that they went home. In 1427 Shi-la-sz' sent camels, horses, and products of the country as tribute. The envoy, named A-li, who presented the tribute, received rich presents, and the rank of tu chi hui was conferred on him. After this for a long time no embassy from Shi-la-sz' was seen in China, when in 1483 again an envoy from that country arrived, in the company of other embassies from Hei-lou (see p. 272), Sa-ma-rh-hany and Ba-dan-sha {Badakhshan), and I-sz -fu-harp.

Clavijo, who visited Tabriz in 1404, states (87) that the city is in a plain between two high ranges of hills, and the hills on the left hand are very near the city and very hot, and the water which descends from them is not wholesome. In 1404 Timur appointed his son, M. Miran Shah, to the government of Azerbeidjan, but some years after the death of the conqueror this province was taken possession of by the Turkomans.

He took along with him plenty of merchandise, and M'hen he had reached Man-la-kia (Malacca) he went on board a trading vessel carrying tribute to China. The party arrived at Kuang tung (Canton), where the eunuch TFei Kilan, then superintendent of the foreign trade at that place, tried to squeeze Ali. The latter departed indignantly, and proceeded to the Chinese capital, where he preferred a charge against Wei Kiian. The Board of Kites proposed to estimate the goods he presented as tribute, to reward him accordingly, and allow him also to proceed to Yiin nan to visit his brother there. But meanwhile Wei Kiian, who was afraid of being punished, had succeeded in bribing the respective officers at court, and Ali's case took another turn. He was represented to the emperor as a spy, who had come to China under the pretence of offering tribute. Accordingly the governor of Kuang tung received orders to send him away, and Ali, notwithstanding his lamentations, was forced to leave China. In 1490 the king of T'ien fang, by name Sii-fan A-hei-ma (Sultan Ahmed), sent an envoy to China, who arrived together with the embassies of Sa-ma-rh-han and T'u-lu-fan (Turfan). He presented as tribute horses, camels, and jade. In the beginning of the reign of Cheng te (1506-22) the superintendent of the imperial horses and stables proposed to commission the military governor of Kan su to procure v^estern mares and geldings. One of the foreign envoys having reported that the best horses were found in T*ien fang (Arabia), the governor of Kan su replied that the best way would be to address the respective envoys when they arrived with tribute at court. But upon the proposition of the president of the Board of War and others, an order was given to the governor to select a number of clever men and despatch them with interpreters to those



I5&I6CENT.] ARABIA {MECCA). 297
countries, in order to make known there the wishes of the emperor. In 1 5 18 the king of T*ien fang, by name Sie-i Ba-la ^•^^1138 gent an envoy to the Chinese court offering as tribute horses, camels, knives made of fish-teeth, and other things. In return he received for his sovereign precious garments, silk stuffs, musk, &c. In 1525 the king of T*ien fang, named I-mci-du-rh, and other princes despatched an embassy to China, presenting as tribute horses, camels, &c. On this occasion the Board of Rites presented to the emperor a report in which it was pointed out that the embassies from the west on their way to the Chinese capital used to be- oppressed and retained, sometimes for more than half a year, by the officers in the province of Shen si, who in their reports accused the foreign envoys that the jade presented by them as tribute was all of bad quality, whilst these envoys retained the best pieces to sell them on their own account. The Board of Rites proposed to bring an action against those officers, and, in order to avoid annoyances on the road, to prohibit the importation of jade in great quantities. The emperor agreed. In the next year (1526) the king of T*ien fang, E-madu-Uang, and seven other princes of tlie same country, sent their envoys with tribute to China. This tribute consisted of jade ;

But the Chinese annals mention frequently the yii among the productions presented as tribute liy the envoys from the countries of Western Asia. This is not easily understood. Although the Chinese state (see p. 249) that the foreigners use to steal jade from the rivers of Khotan, it is, however, unlikely that tlie Arabian embassies, e.g., should have stolen jade at Khotan. But perha^JS these foreigners bought jade somewhere on their road to China.

the affairs of the foreigners, refused to accept it. The envoys of T'ien fang then became indignant, and the interpreter Hu Shi shen, who was also vexed by the measures taken by Ch*en Kiu chuan, wrote down a complaint in the name of the envoys, in which the councillor was falsely accused of having stolen jada The latter, on account of this charge, was imprisoned, and even tortured, and, notwithstanding the intercession of high-placed persons, he was exiled to the frontier. In 1532 an embassy from T'ien fang arrived at the capital together with embassies from T^w-lu-fan (Turfan) Ha-mi, Sa-ma-rh-han. It turned out that the embassy from T*ien fang had been sent by thirty-seven rulers, who all titled themselves wang (kings or princes, see note 929), The Board of Eites then made a report in which it was pointed out that the embassies from the countries of the Si yii arrived too frequently, and that the number of men with them was too large. It was further stated there that these foreigners came to China under the false pretence of bringing tribute, but that their principal aim was to spy out what was going on at court. The Board of Eites thought that strict orders should be given to the officers at the frontier not to allow the foreigners to proceed in great numbers to the capital, but to retain a part of the people accompanyintz those embassies, despatched by rulers who were only nominally vassals of China. The emperor approved of this proposal. According to the former regulations, when foreign embassies had reached the frontier, the Chinese officers were bound to examine the goods selected for being offered
as tribute, and write down a list of all these articles. According to this list the Board of Eites afterwards had to decide with respect to the return presents bestowed on tlie embassies. The rest of the goods, not comprised in the list, were allowed to be sold by the embassies on their own account. In the event of this merchandise not having been sold when the embassies departed, they



I5&I6CENT.] ARABIA (MECCA). 299
had the choice either to take it along or to sell it to the Chinese government, which paid in paper money according to the estimate made by the Board of Kites. Towards the end of the reign of Cheng te (1506-22), when it had been proved that the compradores (who attended to the embassies) made a bad use of these rules, it had been decided that all goods not presented as tribute had to be estimated by official brokers, whereupon the Chinese government bought them in exchange for silk and paper money. Now, then, when the afore-mentioned embassies from Tien fang and the other countries arrived in 1532, the goods which had not been registered as tribute, namely, jade, files, knives, and other articles, were stopped ; but at the request of the envoys the Chinese government agreed to accept them also as tribute and to assess a reward accordingly. These embassies of the foreigners consisted for the greater part of merchants who carried goods for the Chinese market. The covetous Chinese officers at the frontier caused them all kinds of annoyance in order to squeeze them, and often they appropriated to themselves even
goods intended for tribute. But in this year, 1532, the envoys were all clever men,' knowing well the circumstances, and they preferred a charge against the officers, which, however, was not paid attention to by the Board of Eites. It happened at the same time that the eunuch GKen Hao in Han su had sent his slave Wang hung to extort from the envoy (from T'ien fang) a number of fine horses, jade, and other things. The envoy waxed indignant, and when one day he met Wang hung in the street, he ordered him to be seized and delivered up to the authorities, explaining at the same time the case in Peking. Then the Board of Eites proposed to make an example of the delinquents, because the honour of the government had been affected by these abuses. Accordingly a commission composed of high officers was despatched to Kan su to inquire into the matter, and the guilty were sentenced.



300 CHINAS INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST,
In 1538 T*ien fang sent again tribute, and the envoy solicited permission to travel in the interior of China. But the Board of Rites suspected him to be a spy, pointing out, besides this, that there was no instance of such a request having ever been acceded to. Thus the envoy met with a refusal. In 1543 T'ien fang, together with Sa-ina-rh-han, Tu-lufan, Ha-mi, Lu-mi (Rum), and other countries, presented as- tribute horses and other products, and in the sequel Tien fang sent tribute every five or six years. Even during the reign of Wan li (i 573-1620) Chinese intercourse with T*ien fang still continued. I may here notice that among the supplications translated by Amiot (see p. 149) there are two addressed to the Chinese emperor by envoys from T*ien fang : i. A-lo-ting, envoy from T*ien fang, presents as tribute jade and so-fu (see note 1060), and solicits tea-leaves. 2. Sha-chu-ting presents as tribute jade and ten western horses, and
solicits silk, tea-leaves, and porcelain. Before continuing the translation from the Ming shi with respect to Arabia and Mecca, I may premise a short description of that country as found in the Too i chi lio, an account of the countries of the Archipelago and the Indian Ocean by Wang Ta yuan, who visited most of the countries he describes in the first half of the fourteenth century. The Ming Geography quotes some passages from Wang Ta yilan's notices of Arabia. I prefer translating the article in extenso from the original In T^ien fang (Heavenly hall, thus the author terms Arabia) there are many vast deserts. This is the country anciently known under the name of Yiln-chung. It has a pleasant climate, the air being vernal in all four seasons of the year. The soil is fertile and produces plenty of rice. There is an overland road from (the Chinese province of) Yiln nan to this country, by which it can be reached in one year. Another way leads to it by the Western Ocean.

They have in T'ien t*ang the calendar of the Hui-hui (Mohammedans). With respect to the Chinese calendar shou shi li,^^^^ it shows a difference of three days. Tliere is no error in their (astronomical) calculations (as in China). The climate is warm. The people are of good character. Men and women braid their hair. They are dressed in long coats made of fine (cotton or linen) cloth, and gird themselves around also with a piece of fine cloth. The country produces western horses measuring eight feet and more in height. The people like mare's milk, and usually mix it with their food. For this reason they are fat and handsome. For commercial purposes they use silver (coins). They manufacture satin of five different colours. The Ming shi concludes the article on Arabia, or especially Mecca, with the following notices of the country, the customs, products, and sacred places there :

Tien fang is a great kingdom in the Siyil. Its climate is warm the whole year, as in summer. Eain, hail, hoarfrost, and snow are unknown there. But the dew is very heavy, and produces sufficient moisture to cause the herbs
and the trees to thrive. The soil is fertile, and produces millet and wheat. The people are all tall. The men shave their heads and wind a piece of cloth about them. The women cover their heads and take care not to expose
their faces. People say that the name of the founder of the religion of the Hui-hui (Mohammedans) is Ma-ha-ma (Mohammed). He was the principal teacher of this country, and when he died he was buried there.^^^^ On his tomb there

"*^ As I shall show farther on, this description here of T'ien fang refers properly to Mecca, and thus the Chinese record intimates that Mohammed was buried at this place. The reporter took the Kaaba for the tomb of Mohammed. This error with respect to Mohammed's being buried at Mecca has been frequently repeated by the* mediaeval travellers. See Friar Odoric's narrative in Yule's " Cathay," p. 66. Even Mandcville, who had served the Saracens in Egypt, states the same.

is a light which never goes out. The people still adhere faithfully to this religion, and therefore they are all good. Oppressions and revolutions are unknown there, and they have also no capital punishment. The officers and the people always agree. Eobbery and theft are likewise not to be met there.^^*^ T'ien fang is considered to be a blessed country.^i*^ The use of wine is forbidden there. They have temples in which they pray. At the beginning of each month the ruler, the officers, and the people all assemble to pray to Heaven with loud exclamations. The (principal) temple is of a square form, each side of it measuring 90 Men (see note iiii) ; thus the four sides are 360 kien. The columns are all made of white jade (marble), the floor is of fine yellow jade. There is (in the middle of the courtyard of the temple) a hall representing a cube. The steps leading to the hall are composed of
stones of five different colours. In the interior there are five large rafters of aloe-wood. The door-screens are all of gold. The wall in the interior of the hall has been made of clay mixed with attar and ambergris. The gate is guarded by two black lions.^^**

In the Kaaba, as is well known, the famous sacred black stone is kept, an object of the greatest veneration. It is supposed to have been one ot the stones of Paradise, originally white, though since blacked by the kisses of the sinful but believing lips. The worship of stones is a very old form of Semitic cult (Palmer's "Quran," 1880, i. p. xiii.). This celebrated stone, not mentioned by the Chinese travellers of the Ming period, is noticed in the T'ang History as early as the seventh Century, {See my " Notes on the Knowledge Possessed by the Chinese of the Arabs," &c., 1871, p. 7). It is stated there that a lion disclosed to Mohammed the existence near Medina in a hole of a mountain of a sword and black stone with the inscription, " Whoever possesses me becomes ruler." Detailed descriptions of the Great Mosque of Mecca, the Kaaba, the black stone, &c., are found in Ibn Batuta, i. 305-319; Chardin's *' Voj^agc," vii. 163 seq. ; Burckhardt's " Travels," L 134-162. The Kaaba stands in the middle of the square courtyard of the Great Mosque. This

To the left (east) of the hall is the tomb of Sz-ma-i, who ^vas a sacred man in this country. The tomb is covered with precious stones, and the wall around is made
of yellow jade.11^5 On both sides stand two magnificent halls built of stone, in wliich the doctrine (of Mohammed) is preached. Behind the tomb of Ma-ha-ma there is a well, the water of which is limpid and sweet. People who start for the sea-voyage use to take along with them some water from this well, for it has the property of appeasing the waves in time of storm when sprinkled over the sea."*^ The vegetables, fruits, and domestic animals in this country are the same as in China. There are watermelons and melons of enormous size. Sometimes one man is not able to take them up. There are peaches weishins from four to five kin, and fowls and ducks of more than ten kin weight.

According to tradition, the Kaaba was bailt by Ismael, the son of Abraham, and long before Mohammed the people used to make pilgrimages to the sacred stone. The chief shrine of the faith is the Kaaba. The name, which simply means a cube, was given to it on account of its shape, it being built square* The name of T'ien fang applied in the days of the Ming to Arabia, and referring especially to Mecca, means "heavenly square." The Si shi ki, referring to the middle of the thirteenth century, states (see i. p. 141) that west of Bao-da (Bagdad) twenty days' journey is Tien fang, \\\ wliich the divine envoy of Heaven is buried. The second character in the latter name means "house," and the name "Heavenly house" is evidently intended for Bcitullah, house of God, as the Arabs call the Great Mosque of Mecca. Another traveller of the Yiian, in the fourteenth century, as we have seen (p. 300), terms Arabia (Mecca) T'ien Vang (Heavenly hall). 1145 Evidently the tomb of Ismael is meant. The Arabs consider Ismael to be their ancestor. Comjjare with respect to Ismael's tomb in the Great Mosque of Mecca, Ibn Batuta, i. 312. 1146 The well Zcmzen, one of the mo.st venerated object*: in Mecca, is believed to be the spring wliich Hagar discovered when she fled into the wilderness with, her son Ismael.

MODE-NA (MEDINA).
This is the country of the ancestor of the Hui-hui (Mohammedans). It is situated near Tien fang (Mecca). In the reign of Silan te (1426-36) the chief of Mode-na, together with the ruler of T*ien fang, sent an embassy with tribute to the Chinese court. After this no embassy from that country was seen in China. It is reported that the first ruler of Mo-de-na was Mohan-me-de (Mohammed).^^*^ He was endowed with divine spirit, and subdued all countries of the Si yii.

LUMI (RUM).
This country is very far from China.^^^^ In 1524 an embassy from Lu-mi arrived, and presented as tribute a lion and a western ox. One of the imperial councillors laid before the emperor a report in which he pointed out that Lu-mi does not range among the countries which used to send tribute, and that a lion is not a beast proper for being kept. He proposed to refuse such presents. Another high officer, reported that the Chinese authorities at the frontier had detected among the people belonging to the embassy from Lu-mi some men from T'^u-lu-fan (Turfan), and as Turfan constantly made predatory incursions on the Chinese dominions, he proposed to treat the envoy from Lu-mi as a spy, and send him beyond the Chinese frontier. However, the emperor accepted the presents, but
^^^ Aden was known already to the Romans, as is testified by Philo«torgius, who wrote in the fourth century. It is mentioned as a seaport on the Arabian coast by all the early Arab geographers. Edrisi, in the twelfth century (i, 51), says that from Aden ships sailed for Hind, Sind, and China. M. Polo mentions Aden frequently. Barbosa (26-28) gives V detailed description of Adcm and its trade. 11^ This is probably El Hasa, a province on the east coast of Arabia. In the days of Ibn Batuta (ii. 247) there was also a city of this name. 1166 ;^y identification oi Lu-mi with Rum is founded only upon similarity of sounds, and the statement in the Chinese record that Lu-mi is at a great distance from China. From early times the Persians and other Asiatics applied the name of Rum to the Roman Empire, and after its division, relerred it es{)ecially to the Eastern or Byzantine Empire, which, as is known, included the whole of Asia Minor, Armenia, Syria, &c. Rum and the kesars of Rum are frequentl}' mentioned in the Shah nameh. The Arab geographers continued to use the same name for designating the territories of the Byzantine Empire in Asia and Europe. Mas'udi (ii. 293) correctly derives the name of Rum from the city of Rom. He, as *-ell as Tabari (ii. 1-3 1), give a list of the kesars of Rum, beginning with

ordered that the authorities at the frontier should inquire
into the matter. In 1526, in the winter, an embassy from Lu-mi brought again specimens of the same beasts as tribute. After return presents had been conferred upon the envoy, the latter solicited also payment of the expenses of his journey, which, owing to the great distance, amounted to 12,000 and more pieces of gold. But upon the protest of one of the councillors, the beasts were not accepted, and the envoy had to content himself with a meagre remune
ration. In 1 543 Lu-mi sent an embassy, which arrived at the Chinese capital together with the embassies from T^ien fang and other countries. They presented horses and products of the country. The next year the embassy returned home. When they arrived at Kan cJiou, it happened that robbers from the north had crossed the Chinese frontier. The Chinese commander of the troops selected ninety of the men from Lu-mi and sent them against the robbers ; nine of the former were killed in this expedition. When the emperor had been informed of this event, he ordered the slain to be buried with all marks of honour.
Augustus and concluding (Mas'udi) with the emperor Romanus I., about A.D. 920. When, towards the end of the eleventh century, the Seljukian Turks established their power in Asia Minor, the Asiatic nations retained the name of Rum for the territories of this monarchy, but, as appears from Abulfeda {II, i. 315 ; II. ii. 133), continued to call the Byzantine Empire likewise Rum. Subsequently, when, towards the end of the thirteenth century, the Seljukian dynasty disappeared, and the Ottomans succeeded them in these territories, the name of Rum was transferred to the Ottoman Empire. Thus, in the days of Timur and his successors, this name was applied by the Mohammedans, asnow-a-days, to the dominions of the Ottoman Sultans in Asia and Europe. In the Zafer nameh Rum is identified with Anatolia (iii. 28, 55, &c.). Sheri^eddin calls Bayazed, the Ottoman emperor, whom Timur made prisoner iu 1402, Kaiser i Rum. The Chinese annals record several embassies from Lu-mi to China in the sixteenth century. It is not said that they had been despatched by the rulers of this country. I have not been able either to find in the history of the Ottoman empire any allusiou to a diplomatic intercourse with China.

In 1548 and in 1 554 again embassies from Lu-mi arrived. They presented as tribute corals, amber, diamonds, porcelain vessels, so fu (see note 1060), curtains made of sa-ha-la (shawl, see note 106 1), ling yang (antelope), skins

Mi-si-rh or Mi-sz-rh sent an embassy with tribute to China in the reign of Yung lo (1403-25). It was well treated, and the members of it were provided with meat and drink every five days. Orders had also been given to entertain them everywhere on their way through the Chinese dominions. In 1 44 1 the king of Mi-si-rh, by name So-lu-fan A-shila-fuP^^ sent an envoy with tribute to the Chinese court. The Board of Eites on this occasion made a yeport stating that Mi-si-rh is a very distant country, and that the presents usually bestowed on the foreign embassies ought to be diminished. The emperor consented. Then the presents for the king of Mi-si-rh, his wives, and the envoy are enumerated. After this no embassy from Mi-si-rh was seen in China.
Father Amiot {I. c. 241) has translated (from the Chinese version) a letter written by Mo-li ko (Malek), sovereign of Mi'Sz-rh, addressed to the emperor of China, to whom he

According to Weil, "Gesch. d. Chalifen" (v. 167-208), he reigned from 1422, and died on the 7th of June 1438. The envoy may have been despatched from Egypt a short time before the Sultan's death, and it is not unlikely that he did not reach China till three years later. The above Chinese text properly says that the Sultan himself came to China, but there arc probably characters wanting, for farther on it is stated that an enovy was at the head of this.

had sent one of his officers, by name of Ku-li, to offer three horses of the breed a-lu-gu (see note 1071). As this letter, like all the letters translated by Amiot, bears no date, it is impossible to say what Sultan of Egypt had seni this embassy. Almost all the Sultans of the Mameluk dynasty had the title Malek.
Amiot has translated also (l. c. 247) a letter, without date, of a certain Mai-mo from Fei-se-le, depending on the kingdom of Fa-rh-sa-U-ko, who offered two leopards to the emperor ; and p. 246 we find the translation of another letter addressed to the emperor written by Ho-che-haniung of Ty-mi-shi (Di-mi-shi). A. R^musat, who had seen a copy of the original text of these letters, written in Persian, found that Fei-se4e (Beise-le) was intended to render the name of Bassoia, and Di-mi-shi stood for DimishJc or Damascus ("Melanges
Asiat.," ii. 249).
As to the remainder of the countries and cities of Western Asia (and perhaps also Africa) mentioned in the last chapter of the Ming History as having sent tribute to the Chinese court by the overland routes, I shall give a translation of the Chinese accounts, which are somewhat obscure, without venturing on any identification. I am at a loss what to make of these names of countries, cities, and sovereigns, &c., occurring in the subjoined record. As has been proved in the foregoing pages by comparative investigations, the historical as well as the geographical records of the Ming shi concerning the greater kingdoms of Central and Western Asia are generally in good accordance with what we know on the same subject from Mohammedan sources, and there is therefore no reason for supposing that the Cliinese chroniclers should have invented names of foreign countries and rulers. E^musat (I. c.) has, however, suggested that the letters of Western



3IO CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
Asiatic sovereigns and envoys to the Chinese emperors, translated by Amiot, had been fabricated by the Chinese envoys sent to the western countries, but wlio themselves never reached these countries. It is needless to say that this is an arbitrary and utterly unfounded view. E^musat besides this was mistaken with respect to the time these letters had to be assigned to. He believed that they had been addressed to emperor K^ang hi (1662-1723) of the present dynasty. It seems that in the days of K'ang hi China had indeed no intercourse with the countries of Western Asia. Thus, in the first edition of the great Chinese geography Ta Tsing I fung chi, published in 1744, previous to the conquest of Hi and Eastern Turkestan by the emperor KHen lung and to his missions to Western Turkestan and Ferghana, in the section on foreign countries and the map appended we meet with respect to the countries situated north-west of China only with the names of Ha mi, T'u-lu-/an{T\iTia,n), Ye-rh-k'in(YsiT\iend)yBa-li-Jcun'rk (Barkiil), and Wu-lu-imu-ts i ho-fun (city of Urumtsi), for embassies from these places came to the Chinese court in the reign of K*ang hi, at the close of the seventeenth century. It seems that the open communication which existed, as related in the foregoing pages, between China and the countries of Central and Western Asia by the overland route in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, had subsequently been suspended for more than a century. After this digression we now continue the translation of the Chinese accounts regarding the countries of the west, as found in the Ming History.

A-su is a rich country. The climate there is cold and warm, according to the seasons. Dearth is unknown. Theft and robbery are not frequent. In 14 19 the ruler of this country, by name Ya-hu Sha, sent an envoy to China to present to the emperor as tribute horses and products of the country. The envoy was kindly received. But A-su did not send tribute again^ owing to the great distance from China. In 1463 the emperor sent the tu chi hui Fo Tsilan thither, but no embassy from that country was seen again in China.

reign of Yung lo (1403-25) an embassy (caravan) consisting of seventy-seven men arrived from Sha-ha-lu with tribute to the Chinese court. This country is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and is rich. The people are good-natured and disposed to peace. They show reverence to Buddha (see note 1135). The ruler and the high officers live in the city, whilst the people dwell outside. Many rare sea-products are found there. The merchants from the Si yii purchase them at low rates.

3i6 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
EUROPEAN NATIONS MENTIONED IN THE MING HISTORY.
In order to complete my sketch of the intercourse between China and the countries of the west in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by the overland route, I may finally give some extracts from the more or less extensive articles devoted in the Ming shi to the Portuguese, Spaniards, and Dutch, whose nautical and commercial supremacy in the waters of Southern and Eastern Asia lasted during the second half of the Ming period, and who caused much trouble also to the Chinese. These somewhat confused accounts are found in the section treating of the countries reached from China by the searoute.
The Fo-lang-glii (Ferenghi or Franks) are said in the Ming shi, chap, cccxxv., to dwell near Man-la-kia (Malacca). In the reign of Cheng te (1506-21) they took possession of the latter country and expelled its king. In 15 18 they sent a liigh officer, Kia-pi-tan-mo (capitano), and others with tribute to China. They went up the river with their big ships to Kuang tung (Canton), and caused great sensation by their tremendously loud guns. These guns are described in the record.^^^^ These foreigners were lodged in the Hvui ylian post-station, and a report was sent to the emperor. When an order returned to accept the presents and send the foreigners immediately away, the latter did not obey, and the ambassadors solicited permission to proceed to the capital. When the emperor (Cheng te) was travelling in the southern provinces (end of 1 5 19), they despatched an envoy named Huo-dja Hasan to the court. But meanwhile advice had been received

from Canton that the Fo-lang-ghi liad built houses and thrown up entrenchments (at the island Ta mang, see note 1 171) and committed all sorts of atrocities. They were accused of robbery and kidnapping, and even suspected of eating children. The ministers influenced the emperor against the Fo-lang-ghi, and when Cheng te died (in February 1521), his successor Kia tsing took measures to drive them out.^"^ Farther on the same record states that
^'^^ A contemporary Chinese account of tlie same events, i.e., the first arrival of the Portuguese in China, has been translated by the late W. F. Mayers in *' Notes and Queries on China and Japan," 1868, p. 130. The first intercourse of the Portuguese with China is recorded with all particulars by J. De Barros, the author of the classical history of the Portuguese discoveries and conquests in Asia. I refer for the present summary to D. W. Soltau's German translation of de Barros' *• Asia," 1 82 1, iii. pp. 63-76, 203-209. Malacca had been conquered by the Portuguese (Alfonso d'Alboquerque) in 1511. Some years later, in 1515 or 1516, Jorge d'Alboquerque, then governor of Malacca, despatched Rafael Perestrello in a Malay junk to China, On the 12th of August 1516, no news having been received Ironi Perestrello, the governor ordered Ferndo Perez d'Andrade to sail for China. But thi; xpedition failed, and Perez was compelled to return to Malacca, where he found Perestrello, who in the meanwhile had come back from China, having realised an excellent profit from the goods sold to the Chinese. It was then resolved that,F. d'Andrade should try a second time to reach China. Having taken in a cargo of pepper, he sot off with his squadron on June 17, 1517. Thomas Plrez accompanied him in the quality of an envoy from the king of Portugal. Although he was only an apothecary, he had the reputation of a clever man, well qualified for a diplomatic mission. On the 15th of August they reached the island called Tamang, which was three leagues distant from the Chinese shore, Ciud where all the foreign ships which carried on trade with Canton had to anchor. F. d'Andrade met here with Duarte Coelho, his companion in the first expedition, who, after passing the winter in Siam, had reached this port a month ago. Notwithstanding the protestations of the Chinese authorities, F. d'Andrade with some of his sliips sailed up the river to Canton, and saluted by firing the guna. The envoy, Thomas Pirez, was then landed with his suite. The Chinese received him well and lodged him in a comfortable house. The goods the Portuguese had carried with them were also landed and stored up. Whilst D. Coelho was despatched to Malacca to inform the governor of the arrival of the expedition at Canton, J. Mascarenhas received orders to explore the coast of China. He proceeded with a small number of junks to Chincheo, in the province of Fo kieng (Chincheo was the name given by the old Portuguese to the port of Chang chou in Fukien). In August 1518 Simdo d'Andrade arrived at

the Fo-lang-ghi, having taken possession of Ao, in the district of Hiang shan, established a factory there, and
the port of the island of Tamu (Ta mang, v. supra). He had been sent to replace his brotlier Fernao, who had been recalled, and who sailed for Malacca end of September, leaving Pirez and the rest at Canton. Meanwhile intelligence had been received that the emperor of China had assented to receive Thomas Pirez, the envoy. It was, however, only in January 1520 * that l^irez set out from Canton to meet the emperor. The
party went by boat to the mountains Ma len shang (the Mei ling chain), which separate the southern provinces Kan siny and Kan tony and Fo kieng (Kuang si, Kuang tung, and Fu kien) from the northern ones, and then proceeded to Nan king, where the emperor was then sojourning. This journey had taken four months.f The emperor enjoined the envoy to proceed to Peking, and having set out himself, he reached his capital in January 1 52 1. Meanwhile some unfavourable reports had been received from Canton regarding the Portuguese. Owing to the influence of a subject of the Sultan of Malacca, they were denounced to come under the denomination of merchants to spy the country. Besides this, Simao Andrade, who had taken the principal command and had thrown up intrenchments in the island of Tamu, by his atrocious conduct had entirely reversed the good opinion the Chinese liad Ibrmed of his countrymen. The Portuguese were even accused of kidnapping. Thus the emperor refused to see Pirez, and three months after he died.+ The Chinese ministers advised the newemperor (Kia tsing) to put the envoy to death, but the emperor gave instructions that the Portuguese embassy be sent back to Canton and be kept in custody till further orders. The presents were also refused. After S. Andrade's departure in the same year, Diego Calvo had taken the command. When the news of the emperor's death reached Canton, the Chinese authorities summoned the Portuguese to withdraw with their ships from the island of Tamu, and as the latter refused, they were attacked by the Chinese squadron and driven off with heavy loss. Upon this event, which took place in June 1520 (I should think 1521), Pirez and his companions arrived at Canton, and were immediately thrown into prison. No further information with regard to the intercourse of the Portuguese with China is found in de Barros, whose history concludes with the year 1539. He says nothing either with respect to the fate of Thomas Pirez, the first Portuguese ambassador to the emperor of China. Pirez' countryman, the adventurous traveller M. Pinto (see p. 155), who was in China about twenty years after the events above related had taken place, states that Thomas Pirez, after being punished with torture, together with
* The d.-ites given by de Barros do not seem to figree with the dates given for the same events in the Chinese annals. See de Mailla's " Histoire de la Chine," x. 297 geq t According to the Chinese annals, the emperor Chang te in 1519 was engaged in
a tour in the southern provinces. He was iu Nanking in October, and returned to Tekiug in November or December. I According to the Chinese annals, Clieng te died in February 1521.

from this place carried on trade with Fu hien. In 1549 they founded a city there.^^^^ Subsequently men from Ta Si yang (the Great Western Ocean) arrived and settled in this city (the Jesuit missionaries, see farther on). In concluding the account of the Fo-lang-ghi the Ming shi states that they were formerly adherents of the Buddhist religion, but subsequently accepted the faith of the Lord of Heaven. Besides the particulars given in the above account regarding the Fo-lang-ghi or Portuguese, their name occurs repeatedly in other pages of the Ming shi. In the article Man la kia (chap, cccxxv.) the conquest of Malacca by the Fo-lang-ghi in 15 1 1 is recorded, and the measures taken by the Chinese government against these foreigners are spoken of. See Groeneveldt's translation in "Malay
Archip.," &c., p. 1 34. Kegarding their settling in Java and
their trade there, see the article Ghao-wa, chap, cccxxiv., and Groenev., L c. 41. The Ming History further mentions, in the article Su-lu, chap, cccxxv., the attacking of the islands of the Sulu Archipelago by the Portuguese in the reign of Wan li (i 573-1619). Groenev., I. c, 105. Finally, in chap, cccxxiii. the occupatioji of Mei-lo-Jcil (the Moluccas) by the Portuguese is recorded. Groenev., I. c. 11 8.
In the article iM-sung (Ming shi, chap, cccxxiii) the name of the Fo-lang-ghi appears once more, but in this case the Chinese do not mean the Portuguese, but refer to the Spaniards. Lii-sung is even now-a-days the Chinese name for the Philippine Islands, and especially the great island Luzon,
twelve of his companions, was exiled to the north of China, where he subsequently married a Chinese girl, whom he converted to Christianity, and that he died after a long residence in that country. Pinto in 1543 saw his daughter there. But according to other sources, Thomas Pirez was put to death in Canton in 1523 (Williams' "Middle Kingdom," ii.
429). 1172 'pijis gj^y ^,^3 named Macao by the Portuguese. It is the Ao men (gate of Ao) of the Chinese. Ao means properly a bay.

on which Alaiiilla is situated. The first intercourse of the Chinese witli Lil-sung dates from a.d. 1372, when first envoys arrived from that country at the Chinese court. After this the Chinese maintained regular intercourse with Lii-sung. According to the Ming annals, it was in the beginning of the reign of Wan li, thus about 1573, tliat the Fo-lang-ghi made their first appearance in the waters of the Philippines."''^ The Chinese chroniclers report a curious story in connection with the first settlement of the Fo-lang-ghi in Lu-sung, stating that when these foreigners arrived they made rich presents to the king of LU-sung, and begged the favour to occupy only as much land for building houses on as could be covered with the hide of an ox. The king, who did not take umbrage at this demand, assented, and then the foreigners cut the hide of an ox into narrow stripes, with which they surrounded a large area of land."^* The article on Lii-sung in the Ming shi fills nine pages and gives many other details concerning Chinese intercourse with Luzon and the conquest of the Philippines by the Spaniards.
The Ho-lan or Hung mao fan (red-haired barbarians), hj which name the Dutch (Hollanders) are to be understood, are also treated at length in the Ming sld, in chap, cccxxv., where their conquests in the Indian Arcliipelago and
1173 The Philippine Archipelago was discovered by Magellan, the first circumnavigator of the globe, in 1521. After several unsuccessiul expeditions undertaken by the Spaniards to explore and conquer these islands, it was only in 1569 that the Spanish admiral Legaspe discovered Luzon. In 1 57 1 the capital ot Manilla was founded there, and successively the subjugation of the Archipelago throughout was effected. See Crawford's " Dictionary of the Indian Islands." ^'7'* I am not aware whether this Chinese tradition has any foundation, but it is curious to find in an ancient Chinese record the well-known story of the foundation of Carthage by Dido repeated. Du Halde (" La Chine," L 185) reports the same tradition in connection with the settling of the Dutch in Formosa in 1620. He draws also from Chinese sources, for the original of his translation is .found in the T'al wan fu chi or Chinese description of Formosa.



15 & i6 CENT.] DUTCH—FORMOSA, 321
their intercourse with China in the seventeenth century are spoken of. The Chinese chronicler notices that when
Cheng Ho (see p. 142), in the first half of the fifteenth, century, visited the countries of the Indian Sea, he did not hear of the Ho-lan. It is only in the reign of Wan li ( 1 573-1620) that the first mention of them occurs in the Chinese annals. It is stated in this article that the Ho-lan dwell near the Fo-lang-ghi (Portuguese), whom, as we have seen, the Chinese locate near Malacca. In another passage we read that in the reign of Wan li the Ciiinese merchants of the province of Fu kien were permitted to go to Ta-ni, LU-sung, and Kiao-liu-jpa or Ho-lan, and carry on trade with these nations, who subsequently themselves ventured to come to China for trading purposes. Kiao-liu-pa is the Chinese name for Batavia}^'^^ But at tlie end of the account it is correctly stated that the original country of the Ho-lan lies in the Great Western Ocean, and that they profess the faith of the Lord of Heaven. They are said to have red hair, tall bodies, blue eyes sunk deep in their heads. Their feet were one cubit and two-tenths long, &c. Sub anno 1602 it is related that tlie Ho-lan with their big ships proceeded to Ltl-sung, attacked the country, and subsequently also came to Ao (]\Iacao), which they likewise attacked.^^^^ Some years
later the occupation of the P^eny hu islands {Pescadores, between the Chinese coast and Formosa) by the Ho-lan is^ recorded, who arrived with two big men-of-war, established
^^^' Seyger van Rechtern, in the narrative of his voyage to the East Indies (Batavia) in 1628, informs us that the city of Batavia, called Jaccatra by the Javanese, is known to the Chinese by the name of Calappa. In the siune author I lind the somewhat obscure passage, stating that the Chinese call the Dutch Statices, on account of the States. ^^7* According to Valentyn, who in 1724 wrote the history of the Dutch P^ast India Company (established in 1602), the first appearance of the Dutch in the waters of the China Sea was in 1603, when two ships of the Company came to Macao and destroyed a Portuguese galleon there. In 1622 an unsuccessful attempt was made by the Dutch to capture Macao. Their fleet besieged the Portuguese in this place, but they were repulsed with great loss. Y

themselves there, and constructed huts of wood.^^^^ Next they made an attack upon the territories of the Fo-lang-ghi in Mei-lo-kil. (More details with respect to the contest between the Dutch and the Portuguese for the Moluccas will be found in Groeneveldt's translation, p. 1 18.) Finally,
mention is made in this article of the settling of the Dutch in Formosa, and notices regarding the same event are found in the article Ki lung shan, in chap. Qccxxiii. By Ki lung shan (mountain of Ki lung) the Ming History seems to understand the island of Formosa, although Ki lung was only the name of a port on the northern coast of the island. It is still an important trading place. The Chinese record says that Ki lung shan is situated north-east of the P*eng hu islands. Its original name (at the time of the Yiian) was Pe kiang (northern estuary).^^^^ In 1616 the Ji-pen (Japanese) settled in Ki lung shan, and some years later the Hung mao fan took possession of a place (harbour) called Tai wan}'^''^ built houses, anil
^^''7 Seyger van Rechtern records that after th« defeat the Dutch had suffered at Macao in June 1622, their fleet went directly to the Pescadore islands, where they built a fort. 1178 Valentyn (resp. van Rechtern), in his account of the island of Formosa, states that the Chinese call Formosa Pekeande. Perhaps this is a corruption of the Chinese Pe kiang. The latter is not, as it would seem from the -Chinese report, an ancient name for the port of Kilung, for Pe kiang is still the name of a place and a river on the western coast of Formosa, north of T'ai wan. See the map appended to the " Reports on Trade Chin. Marit. Customs," 1880. ii''^ T'ai wan, on the western coast of Formosa, now-a-days the capital city of the island. T'ai = high. terrace, wan = hay, harbour. The Chinese apply the name of T ai wan also to the whole island, called Ilha Formosa (beautifid island) by the old Portuguese. We learn from Seyger van Rechtern that the Dutch, after taking possession of the Pescadores, rendered dangerous the commerce between China and Manilla, destroyed whatever they could seize of Chinese junks, and blocked up the mouth of the river of Chincheo (Chang chou) opposite Amoy, for the Chinese refused to grant them liberty of commerce. At length, in 1624 the Chinese concluded peace with the Dutch, and trade was permitted to the latter, who, however, on their part, agreed to evacuate the Pescadores. They sailed to Formosa, and took possession of a harbour on the south-western side called Taiovan (T'ai wan), where tliey built a fort named Zealand, This fort, the riiins of which can still be

settled there. Besides T'ai wan, the article on Ki lung shan mentions also the ports of Tan shui (Tamsui/, now one of the treaty ports of Formosa on the north-western coast) and Zang k'iao (near the southern termination of Formosa), and a place To-lo-man (unknown to me). On the first arrival of the red-haired barbarians in Chao-wa (Java) in the Wan li period, see Groeneveldt's translation from the Ming shi, pp. 40, 56.
In the same section of the Ming shi, chap, cccxxvi., there is also an article on Fu-lin, a country which has generally been identified with the Byzantine empire, a view which, however, has lately been controverted by Dr. F. Hirth, who, having compared all the Chinese accounts of various times referring to Fu-lin, has come to the con•clusion that Fu-lin is Syria. See his able and interesting book, "China and the Roman Orient," 1855, where, on p. 64, also a translation of the article Fu lin in the Ming shi is found. Compare also Dr. J. Edkins* judicious remarks on Dr. Hirth's conclusions in his "Plea for Kome and Byzantium" ("Chinese Recorder," 1885).
^een, bears the date 1630. A Japanese colony, then resident there, soon retired, and the natives offered no opposition. The Dutch authority in Formosa ended in 1662, when they were expelled from T'ai wan by a Chinese chieftain and pirate, Chinj ching hung (Koxinga of the Portuguese). Valentyn records that the Spanish governor of the Philippines in 1626 fortified the port of Kdung. from which, however, the Spaniards were sub:sequently expelled by the Dutch. Thirty miles from this harbour, on the north-western shore, another settlement was formed at Tan shui (Tamsuy). According to the Jesuit missionaries, the island of Formosa was unknown to the Chinese previous to a.d. 1430, when the discovery was due to the accident of a shipwreck (*' Lettres Edif. et Cur.," xviii. 413). It is true that the name of T'ai wan appears first in the Ming History, but, as the Marquis d'Hervey de St. Denys has proved in his able articles on Formosa ('* Journ. Asiat," 1874, 1875), this island was known to the Chinese in early times under the name of Liu kiu, i.e., they included this Large island in the group of the Liu kiu islands.

I-TA-LI-YA (ITALY).—THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES.
In this article, chap, cccxxvi., it is recorded that in thereign of Wan li (i 573-1620) a man from that country, which is situated in the middle of the Western Sea, arrived at the Chinese capital (Fekini:). His name was Li Ma fouP^ He made a map of the world, with thetitle wan kuo tsuan t% (map of the ten thousand kingdoms), and stated in this work that there are in the world
five ta chou (great islands, parts of the globe). The first is called A-si-ya. It comprises more than a hundred kingdoms, and China is one of them. The second is Ou-lo-pa (Europa), with more than seventy kingdoms. I-ta-li-ya ranges amongst them. The third is Li-wei-ya (Lybia).^^^^ It numbers also more than a hundred kingdoms. The fourth is A-mo-le-hia (America). It is very large, and divided into a northern and a southern part. Afterwards the fifth was discovered and called Mo-ioa-la-ni-kia (Magellanica).^^^^ With respect to the first arrival of the Jesuit missionaries at Peking, and their establishing themselves there, we find in the Ming shi the following details, which are in complete accordance with the information given on the same events by Trigault, Semedo, Du Halde, &c., and prove the authenticity of the reports of these missionaries.

It can be read on his tombstone with Chinese and Latin inscriptions, raised by imperial order in the Portuguese cemetery situated near the (western) Pin.cf tsz' men gate of Peking, where a great number of the early Jesuit missionaries repose. Ricci arrived in China (Macao) in 1 582, but it wasonly in 1601 that he was allowed to come to Peking, where he died in 1610. 11^1 I am not aware why Ricci prefers this name to Africa, ^^'^^ Under this name the European geographers of that time included an extensive tract of land supposed to extend from close contiguity with South A-rnerica to several degrees beyond the South Pole. Comp. Wylie's " Notes on Chin. Lit.," p. 47. Pantoja, likewise an Italian Jesuit, wrote in compliance with an imperial order, as an accompaniment to Ricci's map, a concise geography of the world, which after Pantqja's death was published in 1623 with some additions, under the name of Chi fanrficai hi..

In the ninth year of the reign of Wan li (1581), Li Ma t^ou (Ricci) liad first embarked, and after a sea-voyage of 90.000 li, arrived at Ao (Macao), in the district of Hiang ^han, in the Kuang tiing province. Then his doctrine infected China. In 1601 he arrived at Peking^ and the €unuch Ma T^ang introduced him. to the emperor with the presents he had brought as tribute. Li Ma t*ou stated that he was a man from Ta Si yang (the Great Western Ocean). Thereupon the ministers of the Board of Rites made a long report to the emperor, pointing out that this foreigner seems to be a liar, for according to the Hui tien ^collection of the statutes of the Ming), there is indeed a country Si yang Soli, but nobody has heard of Ta Si yang. " Moreover, this man has appeared at court twenty years after his arrival in China. And what did he offer to the emperor as tribute ? Nothing but strange things which have no resemblance to those rare and precious presents usually offered by the envoys from distant countries. He has brought, for instance, portraits of the Lord of Heaven and of his mother, and also some bones of immortals. As if an immortal who soars up to heaven filiould be provided with bon^s ! Han yil, (a scholar) of the T*ang period, has said that such unclean things can only bring mischief, and therefore ought not to enter into the palace." After this, the report blamed the behaviour of the eunuch Ma T*ang, who, before introducing Li Ma t*ou into the palace, should have applied to the Board of Rites, as is the rule, that the things presented as tribute might have been examined. " This man (Ricci) is staying privately in a Buddhist temple of Peking, and we know nothing about him and his intentions. It is the rule that in the case of foreign countries sending tribute to the court, the envoys are rewarded and entertained as guests. Now we propose to bestow upon Li Ma t*ou a cap and a girdle, and to send him back. He ought not to be allowed to live secretly in either of the two capitals, nor to enter into intimacy with our people." After this the emperor



326 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
came to no decision, when in the eighth month the Board of Rites again laid before him a report, complaining that they had been waiting vainly five months for His Majesty's decision in the matter of Li Ma t'ou. They now tried to prove that it would injure his health if he were staying any longer in Peking. " Just as a bird or a deer when put into a cage is mourning for its. forests and luxuriant grass, likewise men also do not feel easy in a city." They stated further that Li Ma t'ou did not attach any value to presents, and they pretended that he himself was desirous of living in the mountains. Accordingly the Board of Rites proposed to send him to Kiang si, alleging that people living in the deep valleys and mountains of that province are said to attain a high age. However, the emperor did not pay any attention to these arguments. On the contrary, he was pleased with the man who had come from so far a country, and ordered him to remain in the capital, bestowing upon him rich presents, giving him a house, and paying for his maintenance. Subsequently the officers as well as the people conceived an afiection for him, and held him in great esteem. He died in the fourth month of i6io, and was buried by imperial order in the western suburb of the capital (Portuguese cemetery, see note 1 1 80). On the first of the eleventh month of the same year an eclipse of the sun happened, and it turned out that the (Chinese) astronomer had made a grave mistake in his calculation, whereupon the emperor gave order to change the mode of calculation. In the next year the president of the Astronomical Board pointed out two men from the Great Western Ocean, by names of Parig Ti wo and Hiung San pa, deeply versed in astronomy, and who calculated
according to methods unknown in China. A councillor of the Board of Rites proposed to examine again the Mohammedan system of calculating introduced by Hung wu (the first Ming emperor), and to invite for this deliberation the afore-mentioned foreigners. The emperor consented.

Since the time Li Ma t*ou had first entered the Middle Kingdom, his followers arrived in great numbers. One of them, by name Wang Feng su, who lived in Nan king, was an ardent propagator of the doctrine of the Lord of Heaven, and attracted the people of all classes, officers as well as the peasants in the villages. However, the Board of Kites hated the followers of this religion, and was always disposed to put them to all kinds of inconveniences. In 16 16 the Board of Kites laid before the emperor a report, in which it was suggested that the doctrine of the Lord of Heaven was a fallacious and vicious one, exciting the people. It was tried also to prove that they (the missionaries) were Fo-lang-ghi}^^ Wang Feng su, Yang Ma nOy and others, were accused of seducing the people to assemble on the first and the fifteenth days of every month to the number of ten thousand men, under the pretence of praying, but in fact to plot secretly, in the same way as the (secret) society called Fo lien (White Lotus) did, being also in collusion with the foreigners in Ao (Macao). The effect of this report was that an imperial decree went out banishing the followers of this doctrine to the province of Kiiang tung. In the fourth month of 1618 Fang Ti wo addressed to the emperor a petition in which he solicited to be left with his companions, ten in number, in the capital, alluding to their merits and his having held an office in the capital for seventeen years. He tried also to prove that the doctrine had nothing to do with conspiracies, &c. But he was refused by the emperor, and the foreigners went away discontented. Subsequently Wang Feng su changed his name, and passed (again) into Nan kiijg, where he taught secretly his doctrine as before. It was impossible to get at the truth. In his country (I understand Wang Feng su's country) the people are very clever in making cannons. These

cannons are larger than those brought from tlie Great Western Ocean. After one of these had been received in China, attempts were made to imitate them. But it was impossible to make use of these arms. During the reigns of T'ien ki (1621-28) and Cheung cheng (1628-44) men from Ao (Macao) came to the capital, and as they proved to be very clever in military arts, they were emi^loyed in the war in the north-east (against the Manchus).^^^ In the reign of Ch*ung cheng (the last Ming emperor) it happened that the calculation of the calendar had fallen into disorder, and the Board of Eites proposed to apply to the followers of the doctrine of the Lord of Heaven, namely, Zo Ya ku and T^ang Jo wang and others, to appoint a committee in order to rectify the ancient methods of calculation by means of the new system of the foreigners. The emperor agreed, and in 1628 a book was published with the title CKung cheng li shu (Almanack of emperor Ch*ung cheng), which was superior to the former almanack ta Cung li. These (Christian) foreigners who had come to the east had in the Middle Kingdom the repute of being the most intelligent, learned, and honest men. They preached their doctrine, and wrote many useful books on matters never before heard of by the Chinese people. They never asked for any payment. They became well known among the people, and even high officers made them their friends. After this the Ming History enumerates the following Jesuit missionaries under their Chinese names, indicating also their native countries :

1184 Detailed accounts regarding the Portuguese of Macao, who in about 1622 came to Peking, and assisted the army of the Ming against the Manchus, are found in Semedo's "China" (French transl., pp. 138, 146). Semedo at the time liere spoken of was in Peking. See also my article on the subject, *• China Review," vi. 339. In Marc d'Avalo's description of Macao, referring to the first quarter of the seventeenth century, and published by S. van Rechtern, it is stated that the Portuguese had a gunfoundr}' there, where cannons of gun-metal and iron were cast.

NOTICE OF A CHINESE ITINERARY TO WESTERN ASIA OF THE MING PERIOD.
Before concluding these volumes, it remains for me to say a few words on a Chinese itinerary, sketching the overland route from the north-western frontier to the Mediterranean Sea, of which a full translation has been
1185 xhe document above translated is an honourable monument raised in Chinese history to the memory of those venerable Jesuit missionaries who preached the gospel in China nearly 300 years ago. It proves at the same time that their statements with respect to their influence at the Chinese court and the conversion of the highest Chinese officers have by -no means been exaggerated. In 1872 the learned Jesuit Fathers at Sik ka way (near Shanghai) published an interesting pamphlet with the title : Catcdogus Patrum ac Fratrum e Societe Jesu qui a morte S. Fr. Xaverii ad annum MDCCCLXXII Evangelio Propaganda in Sinis adlahoraverunt. The list shows also the names these missionaries adopted in China, and besides this, short biographical notes have been added. This useful compilation enables me to identify the names of the missionaries mentioned in the Chinese record. I may give here their European names :

Li Ma t'ou, A/atthceus Picci, born at Macerata, in Italy, in 1552, Arrived in China in 1582, died at Peking nth May 1610. Lung HuAi min, Nicolaus Longobardi, born in Sicily in 1582, arr. in China 1597, died at Peking nth December 1654. P'aii'j Ti wo, Didacus de Pantoja, a Spaniard, born 1571, arr. in China 1599, died at Macao 1618. Hiung San pa, Sahhathinus de Ursis, born at Naples 1575, arr. in China i6o5, died at Macao 16^0. Yang Ma no, Emmanuel Diaz, jun., a Portuguese, born 1574, came to China 1610, died at Hang chou 1659. Pi Fang tsi, Franciscus Samhiaso, born at Naples 1582, came to China 16 1 3, died at Macao 1649. Ttng Yil han, Joannes Terrenz, born in Switzerland 1576, came to China 162 1, died at Peking 1630.

presented in the first edition of my Eesearches,^^^^ but which I do not consider sufficiently interesting to be reproduced in these pages. It refers probably to the fifteenth century, was first published at the close of the Ming in a strategical description of China, and seems to have been compiled from various itineraries noted down by the numerous Chinese envoys who in that period visited the countries of Central and Western Asia. This Chinese itinerary, which bears the title Si yil Tin ti jen Avu lio, i.e., a sketch of the countries, the people, and the products of the Si yil, begins at Kia yil kuan. the important fortress at the north-western frontier of China (seenote 937). Although the greater part of the geographical names mentioned on the route and in the vicinity of it escape critical investigation, owing to the scantiness of our knowledge with respect to these tracts from other sources, ancient or modern, we are nevertheless enabled to trace in a general way the lines of the itinerary. The mentioning of such places as Sha chou, Ha mi, Karakhodjo, Turfan, Suhashi}'^'^ Kunmishi,'^^^ Chalish (Kharashar, see p. 315), Ku sien (Kucha, see p. 315), Aksu, Kashgar, in the first part of it, leaves no doubt that it follows the great highway through Eastern Turkestan along the southern slope of the T*ien shan chain. As we have learned from the accounts translated above from the Ming shi, this was
Ai Ju lio, J. Aleni, born at Brixia 1582, came to China 161 3, died at Fu chou 1649. The name Wang Fen su is not found in the list of the Jesuit missionaries. But from Semedo's " China " it would appear that the above Chinese name referred to the author of that book. Alvarez de Semedo, a Portuguese, born 1585, arrived in China in 16 13, died at Macao 1658. On pp. 310-338 he gives a detailed account of the persecution and expulsion of the Jesuit missionaries from Nan king in 1617. He was himself then imprisoned by order of the Chinese authorities and sent to Canton. 15ut three years later, after changing his Chinese name, he succeeded in establishing himself once more at Nan king. The list of the Jesuit Fathers gives Lu Te cTiao as Semedo's Chinese name.

indeed the way by which the numerous embassies and commercial caravans from the various countries oi" Western Asia used to proceed to China. Even the embassies from Badakhshan seem to have preferred this route to the shorter way passing by Khotan and Lopnor, on account probably of the great deserts the traveller has to cross in the latter direction. This fact is confirmed also by the narratives of Shah Eok's embassy to China (1420), and Hadji Mohammed's account of Cathay (1550). Goes (beginning of the seventeenth century), on his memorable journey from India through Badakhshan and the Pamir to China, passed also from Yarkand to Aksu, Cucia (Kucha), Cialis (Kharashar), Turfan, Kamul (Hami), Chiaicuan (Kia yti kuan), and from this latter place at the Chinese frontier reached Socieu (Su chou), where he died, April
II, 1607. In the days of Mongol supremacy in Asia, however, in the thirteenth century down to the reign of Kublai Khan (1260), the great line of communication between Eastern and Western Asia lay along the northern slope of the T*ien shan mountains. Karakorum was at that time the residence of the Mongol khansi and this way was indeed the shortest from the Mongol capital to Transoxiana and Persia (Karakorum, Altai, Bishhalik (Urumtsi), Sairam lake, Almalik (Kuldja), Chu river, Talas, Sairam, Taskkend, Samarkand. (See Part I., " Chinese Mediaeval Tra
vellers.") After Kashgar, we meet in our Chinese itinerary a series of names of places for which I have not been able to trace any corroboration elsewhere, and then five names appear which are easily recognised as those of five cities of Ferghana, viz., Andidjan, Sharikhana, Marghilan, Ush, and Kanihadam. From Ferghana we are led to Herat, but before reaching this city the road-book notices a number of names of places situated north and south of the road, amongst which we recognise the city of Kaluga, coupled with the Iron gate (see p. 274), and the cities of Kunduz,



332 CHINA'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE WEST.
KJiulm, JBalkh, Andhui. After Herat we liave Merv, Bok^ hara, Samarkandy and many other names unknown to me. Tlie rest of the itinerary is very dark and confused. Among the numerous geographical names appearing in it, I can trace with more or less certainty only the following places :

Badakhshan, Bastam, Astrabady Shiraz, Isfahan, Sultania^ Tabriz, and four months' journey west of the latter, K^u-sz'-dan (Constantinople). Hence we are transported to Bagdad, and then taken to Mecca, Medina, Misz-rh (Egypt). From Egypt the itinerary turns lo Asia Minor; at least among the cities mentioned farther on we can recognise Siwas, Atina, Angora, Kutahieh, Brussa, After Brussa the sea is mentioned, with big men-of-war navigating in it. The city last spoken of in the itinerary is Lu-mi, 1400 li west of Brussa. It seems that Borne is meant.
