Sūrat an-Najm (Arabic: سورة النجم , "The Star") is the 53rd chapter (surah) of the Qur'an with
62 verses (āyāt). The surah that opens with the oath of the Divine One swearing by every one
of the stars, as they descend and disappear beneath the horizon, that Muḥammad is indeed
God’s awaited Messenger. It takes its name from Ayat#1, which mentions “the stars” (najm).
The surah confirms the divine source of the Prophet’s message and refers to his ascension
to heaven during the Night Journey (Ayah#1 ff.). The surah refutes the claims of the
disbelievers about the goddesses and the angels (ayah#19 ff.), and lists several truths about
God’s power. It closes with a warning of the imminent Day of Judgement.
The first eighteen verses of this sura are
considered to be some of the earliest revelations of
the Qur'an. These verses address the legitimacy of
Muhammad’s prophetic visions. The sura begins
with the divine voice swearing by the collapsing
star that “Your companion,” referring to
Muhammad, has not gone mad, nor does he speak
out of his desire. The passage evokes the process
of vision by tracing the movement along the
highest horizon and then coming down and
drawing near to the distance of “two bows” length.
The passage ends with the affirmation of the
validity of the vision by stating that the heart of the
prophet “did not lie in what it saw.”
The surah is distinguished as being the first that
required Muslims to prostrate, or perform sajdah,
when it is recited, according to Tafsir Ibn Kathir and
a number of hadiths. The sura claims that, when it
was first narrated by Muhammad in Mecca, all
Muslims and non-Muslims who heard the recitation prostrated to God upon its completion
due to the effect that the words had upon them.
The sura is also known for referencing the star Sirius in ayah 49 where it is given the name

Ibn Kathir said in his
commentary "that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of
Arabs used to worship."
