Ur-Namma: ceremoniously carrying the first basket of clay for the
building of a new temple.
Ur-Namma was originally a military governor (or general) appointed by
Utu-hengal, the king of Uruk, who was starting to gain ascendency over
the Gutians after the collapse of the Akkadian Empire. Ur-Namma later
became a king in his own right, the king of Ur. Several years after the
death of Utu-Hengal, Ur-Namma unified the various Sumerian cities and
he gained significant victories over the Gutians. He thus created an
independent Sumerian state, after two centuries of foreign
domination. He went on to conquer all of Akkad. Thereafter, he
signed himself as "Ur-Namma, the king of Ur, the king of Sumer and
Akkad". He ruled for eighteen years (circa 2112 - 2095 B.C.)
Historians thought Ur-Namma overthrew his "masters" att Uruk, the
city of Utu-hengal, and that he even assassinated Utu-hengal to become
the king. More recent studies, however, suggest that Ur-Namma was
actually the younger brother of Utu-hengal, or they symbolically "became
brothers", and that Utu-hengal died in a boating accident (modern
reconstructions of Sumerian history are in constant flux). Another
possiblity is that Ur-Namma became a king by marrying the daughter of
Utu-hengal.
It was also thought that Ur-Namma did not unify the various Sumerian
city-states so much as conquer them because there is some evidence of a
conflict between Ur-Namma’s city of Ur and the city of Girsu. His
conquest of Sumer “need not have been particularly arduous”, and
Magnus Wildell of the University of Chicago has presented evidence that
the conflict has been overstated. What’s remarkable is the fact that Ur
Namma was able to forge the various Sumerian city-states into one single
nation. These city-states had always prized their
autonomy and independence, and had often been at war with each other.
History is filled with many examples of failed attempts to form regional
kingdoms into a single unified nation. Only a leader who is truly great,
who is both strong and diplomatic, like Ur-Namma, can build
a nation without excessive bloodshed and civil war.
Whether Ur-Namma was a governor named by royal appointment, or
the younger brother of a ruling monarch, indicates that he wasn't
necessarily "born to be a king". It is said he was chosen by extispicy, the

reading of divine omens in the liver of a sacrificed animal, rather than
the standard rules of succession. (It's easy to suspect that he made certain
"arrangements" to guarantee the omens were favorable, like some well
placed bribes, a few veiled threats, and other behind-the-scene
machinations.) It shows that Ur-Namma made himself into a king
by his own talent and efforts. He thus became a living god, worshiped in
his lifetime.
Ur-Namma commemorative tablet: dedicated to Inanna, the goddess
of love and war. "Inanna/ Lady of the E-anna temple/ His queen/ Ur
Namma/ The mighty man/ The king of Sumer and Akkad" The
inscription is continued on the back: "Her temple/ he built/ this place
he restored". See the back of this Ur-Namma tablet.
For more than two centuries, after Sumer was conquered by Sargon the
Great, the Sumerians were the subjects of the Akkadian Empire. The
Akkadians were the masters and the Sumerians were the vassals. Then Ur
Namma conquered the Akkadians. It was a difficult challenge for him to

rule both nations after this sudden role reversal, to say the least.
He alone held the two nations together, with the sheer force of his will.
He was a builder of roads, canals, and temples. He began construction
on the famous ziggurat at Ur (pictured on these pages) which was
completed by his son, Shulgi. Ur-Namma codified the laws of the land,
300 years before the famous (Babylonian) Code of Hammurabi.
He ruled his kingdom with competence and justice.
The Code of Ur-Namma, the world's first
known codified list of laws. See the laws of Ur-Namma.
For his time and place he was just as great as Caesar or Alexander;
seventeen centuries before Alexander and twenty centuries before Caesar.
Ur-Namma was killed in combat, abandoned by his fleeing army, in yet
another battle with the Gutians (see "I am Ur-Namma" for his
complete life story) but the dynasty he created would last for almost a
hundred years. It witnessed the last flowering of Sumerian civilization,
which was already ancient, before it was finally destroyed so long ago in
the ancient past.

Ur-Namma stele. (heavily damaged)
Above: Ur-Namma stands before the god Enlil, watering the Tree of Life
to overflowing. Enlil presents Ur-Namma with a measuring rod and rope
used for surveying, and an adze, used for building a new temple. It was
originally thought that the surveying rope symbolized Enlil's
dominion over all the land, and he holds a battleaxe to symbolize his right
to "strike and kill" (i.e., to administer justice) like the fasces used by the

Romans, and the cobra on the front of a pharaoh's crown. I would suggest
that the rope is simply used to mark out the boundries of a new temple,
and the "weapon" that Enlil holds is actually an adze, which is used as a
construction tool, rather than a battleaxe, which is used as a weapon of
war. In other words, Enlil is giving Ur-Namma the tools needed for
building a temple. The god is commonly mistaken to be Nanna, the moon
god for whom the great ziggurat at Ur was built, but this seems unlikely
because no Tree of Life would be associated with a moon god. Below:
Enlil leads Ur-Namma and a worker to begin work on the temple. King
Ur-Namma is shown wearing a shepherd's hat. He is also shown with a
full beard, which was his usual appearance. The statue of him at the top of
the page shows him as completely shaven, as part of the purification ritual
for the dedication of a new temple. The fact that Ur-Namma keeps his hat
on while in the presence of Enlil shows that he too is a god.
This damaged portion of the stele shows Ur-Namma in the presence of an
angel (lamma, guardian spirit).

Line drawing of tablet. The sign uri (Akkad) is missing from the end
of third line, although it can faintly be seen on the original tablet. Ur
Namma's name is on the first line.
I was looking through the Library of Congress cuneiform collection
when I saw this tablet.
It was labelled "Not yet translated". I looked at the name and I said,
"That's Ur-Nammu!!"
(I know, I know, the current pronunciation is Ur-Namma, not Ur
Nammu, so there is no need to point that out to me.) I recognized the
name because it was one of the first signs I had difficulty understanding (it
doesn't look how it is spelled). For me, it was a great moment of
discovery. It's as if I had recognized a friend, in a crowd, from a distance,
when I wasn't expecting him to be there. It was like seeing Ur
Namma himself, across the distance of time. These moments of original
Ur-Namma votive tablet translation about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/23501.html

discovery are what makes the study of Sumerian so interesting.
The Library of Congress is currently in the process of revamping their
cuneiform display.
I assume a translation of the tablet will be included. But for those of you
who "just can't wait", I have included my own translation of the tablet (it's
a common inscription).
The numerical subscript of a sign is not pronounced. The sign that looks
like an asterisk
is dingir and it's represented by "{d}". It designates divinity, and is
likewise unpronounced.
Transliteration:
1. ur- {d} namma
2. lugal urim5 ki-ma
3. lugal ki-en-gi ki-uri
4. lu2 e2 {d} en-lil2-la2
5. in-du3-a
Translation:
1. Ur-Namma
2. King of Ur
3. King of Sumer and Akkad
4. He who built
the temple of Enlil
This tablet references the E-Kur temple mentioned above.
Although the E-Kur was the most important temple built by Ur-Namma,
he is today better known for a temple in the city of Ur:

This magnificent head portrays a king of the late third millennium B.C.
Its heavy-lidded eyes, prominent but unexaggerated nose, full
lips, and enlarged ears all suggest a portrait of an actual
person. While the date and place of manufacture of this piece have been
much debated, its close similarity to the magnificent bronze head found at
Nineveh make a late third millennium date most likely. The head is cast

display in a temple setting.

June 24, 2010
I was idly looking at this picture of "the unknown ruler". It had been
on my website
for more than a year, so I had seen the picture a hundred times
before. Although I always accepted it as an unknown Sumerian ruler, on
several occasions I had thought to myself, "It could be Ur-Namma. It
looks like Ur-Namma. Maybe it's Ur-Namma". However, I didn't
know the provenance of the artifact or the archaeological context in which
it was discovered, so I thought I shouldn't hazard a guess about the man's
identity. I figured that if it was known to be Ur-Namma, then someone
else would have mentioned it long before now.
Earlier in the day I was doing an Internet "image search" on Ur
Namma, thinking I could use another picture of him on this website. The
truth is, I was only doing it out of boredom; I didn't really need
another picture of him. The point is, I had just seen many different images
of Ur-Namma, all at the same time.
So later on, when I idly looked at the picture of the "unknown ruler", I
suddenly knew exactly who he was. I was absolutely certain of it, as if I
had just seen an old friend of mine walk in through the door. I was so
filled with surprise and amazement, I actually spoke aloud. Although I was
the only one around to hear it, I said, "That's Ur-Namma."

Ur-Namma
Mighty man
King of Ur
King of Sumer and Akkad
Ur-Namma ruled from 2112 to 2095 B.C. He
restored Sumerian independence after centuries of foreign
domination. He unified the various Sumerian city-states, thus creating
a new Sumerian nation. He was a founder of the Neo-Sumerian Revival,
the final renaissance of Sumerian civilization (see Ur-Namma
Translation). Ur-Namma was the best of the known Sumerian rulers. He
was an ambitious builder of temples and a just ruler of men. Ur-Namma
was a king, a general, and a self-made living god. In the long history of the
Land of Sumer, there had been many great kings. Ur-Namma was the
greatest of them all.

The Met Museum was correct in pointing out that the statue of "the
unknown ruler" was clearly meant to resemble an actual person,
which was seldom the case in Sumerian art. Throughout most of their
history, the Sumerians made little attempt to depict human beings
as distinct individuals. Rather, like the Egyptians, the Sumerians
portrayed people in a stylized and generic sort of way, as seen below.
Sumerian men were drawn with large noses and big eyes, in a style that I
call, "Stereotypical Sumerian". The women are distinguishable from the
men only by their different clothing and hairstyles.

Sumerian faces: detail from the Royal Standard of Ur. After his victory
in battle, a king drinks and celebrates with a friend (probably a general)
while being attended by two servants. The king is recognizable by his
traditional skirt of woolen leaf petals and by the fact that he is
drawn larger than the others to signify his greater importance. Otherwise
he's indistinguishable from the dozens of other men depicted on the
Standard of Ur. All of the faces are the same. Circa 2400 B.C.
It wasn't until later in their history, when they became more
sophisticated in their art,
that the Sumerians started to depict human beings as distinct individuals.
This occurred at the time of Gudea (circa 2130 B.C.) and was due in no
small part to the artistic renaissance that blossomed in the city of Lagash
during his reign. The "Sumerian woman" is one of the earliest examples of
Sumerian sculpture that closely resembles the person it portrays,
and the statutes of Gudea arguably make him the first recognizable man in
history.
During the reign of Ur-Namma, which started about ten years after the
death of Gudea,
many of the artisans of Lagash were transferred to Ur-Namma's capital
city of Ur.
The statue of Ur-Namma may have been created by these very same
artisans.
Below is a side-by-side comparison of Ur-Namma and the "unknown
ruler". The bearded image of Ur-Namma is from the "Ur-Namma Stele",
seen elsewhere on these pages. The other four images are votive statues of
Ur-Namma that show him at the construction of a new temple where he
ceremoniously carries the first basket of earth. He is also shown as
clean‐shaven, as part of the purification rites for the dedication of a new
temple. The sculpture on the right is in the form of a "foundation figure"
which is shaped like a nail or a peg. It is inscribed with the king's
announcement to the gods that he is the one who built the temple.
Many pegs similar to this one were buried beneath the temple
foundations. The inscriptions on all of the statues pictured below clearly
identifies them to be Ur-Namma.

Note how all four of Ur-Namma's distinguishing features – the heavy

lidded eyes, the rounded tip of the nose, the prominent ears, and the way
the mouth is set, are depicted the same in all of the images.
Images of Ur-Namma:
A comparison of Ur-Namma and the "unknown ruler":
1) All four of Ur-Namma distinguishing characteristics (the heavy
eyelids, rounded nose, large ears, and the way the mouth is set) match
those on the face of the "unknown ruler".
2) The chin, cheek bones, and the overall shape of the head, also
match.
3) The unknown ruler doesn't have any other distinguishing feature to
show that he is someone different than Ur-Namma.
4) With or without a beard, and with or without the royal regalia (the
crown, robe, and symbols of office) they are obviously the same person,
based on the facial features alone.

Ur-Namma and the god Enlil with the Tree of Life between them. Detail
from the "Ur-Namma Stele".
It was this picture, at this scale, which first led me to suspect that the
"unknown ruler" could be Ur-Namma. I had noted the resemblance, even
though this figure is rather small and it's in profile view rather than frontal
view like the picture of the unknown ruler. What first caught my attention
was the heavy-lidded eyes and the rounded shape of the nose. On the
original stele there is another image of Ur-Namma, as shown below:

Ur-Namma profiles: The nose of the figure on the right is chipped and
damaged. The figure on the left is a modern restoration done in
plaster. The nose appears to be the correct shape, but it is perhaps a little
too long.
Notice how the figure of Ur-Namma facing right is more heavy-lidded
than the other figure, the "worker Ur-Namma", facing to the left. The
figure facing left shows his left eye,
the "good eye", as it were. Because of the asymmetry of his eyes, Ur
Namma presents
a different profile depending on which direction he is facing. Click here to

The figure of the king is missing due to heavy damage on the second
register of the stele
(see the restored front of the stele, and see the second register in its
original condition).
This figure of the king was modeled on the large figure of the king at the
top of the stele. According to Jeanny V. Canby, the author of The Ur
nammu Stela, "Despite much damage, the brow, eyebrow, the front of the
eye with heavy lid [...] are still visible." If you look at the original
reconstruction (right) you can see that the right eye never had
the wide open
"<" shape of the left profile shown in the picture above this one. This
would explain why the modern reconstruction seems to be so unusually
modeled. At the time of the reconstruction, the asymmetry of Ur-Namma's
eyes wasn't known. On the other hand, the left profile on the stele (below)
was in good condition, and it clearly shows the open ">" shape of the left
eye.

The asymmetry of Ur-Namma's eyes can be seen on all the images of him.
The asymmetry
is so pronounced as to seem intentional by the different artists. It's not as
if they lacked
the skill to make the eyes more closely match. These figurines were sacred
objects, presumably made by the best artists available, and yet none of the
artists could get the eyes to match? The figurines were modeled in clay
before the were cast in metal, so if an artist didn't get the eyes right the
first time, he could easily remold the clay. The figurines are symmetrical in
all other respects (the arms, torso, face, and nose) and yet the eyes do not
match? It is obvious that the artists intentionally made the eyes
asymmetrical. They used different ways to do it, but the results were
always the same. A high-resolution enlargement of the third picture from

the left (which was originally printed in photographic reverse) clearly
shows the artist's attempt to portray the asymmetry of the eyes.
The artists always show Ur-Namma's right eye as the one that is heavy
lidded.
I'm no doctor, but I have diagnosed Ur-Namma's drooping eyelid as a
condition called ptosis. According to Eyewiki, "Ptosis can affect one eye or
both eyes. It may be present
at birth, or may be acquired later in life. If a droopy eyelid is present at
birth or within the first year of life, the condition is called congenital
ptosis. In most cases of congenital ptosis, the problem is isolated and does
not affect the vision. Any ptosis that develops over a period of days or
weeks can signal a serious medical problem and needs further
neurological and physical evaluation."
I know that Ur-Namma's ptosis was congenital, i.e., a heredity

condition transmitted by the genes, and not a symptom of a serious
medical condition, because his son Shulgi
had the same condition:

The face of Shulgi. All of his foundation figures display his rounded face
and features.
The other figures are rather crude and generic, but this is a realistic
portrait. This is how
Shulgi looked in real life, when he was at the height of his power and glory.

A foundation figure at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was
tentatively identified as Shulgi, "pending further investigation". I believe
it's Ur-Namma because it looks like
Ur-Namma, and not Shulgi, because it doesn't have Shulgi's round face.

Ur-Namma, not Shulgi, After I wrote to the Met Museum and identified
it as Ur-Namma,
they (rather spitefully, I thought) dropped the "pending further
investigation" and definitively identified it as Shulgi without any further
explanation. I would suggest the reason it wasn't inscribed with writing is
because Ur-Namma died unexpectedly in battle before the figure was
completed. That is why there is no writing on it.
It was a mistake for the Met to identify this statue as Shulgi. Notice the
similarity of the face
to all the other images of Ur-Namma shown below:

The asymmetry of his facial features is seen on all of the statues of Ur

unknown ruler":
In this brightly lit close-up picture of the unknown ruler it is easy to see
the asymmetry of his facial features: the eyes, nose, and mouth. Ur
Namma was the only ancient ruler to consistently portray himself in this
asymmetrical manner. See another image of the statue that highlights the
asymmetry of his features.
Because every single facial feature matches on the two men, and
because there are no dissimilarities, it can safely be said that the
"unknown Sumerian ruler" is in fact Ur-Namma, to the exclusion of all
others. It would be difficult to imagine anyone else, ancient or modern,
who could resemble the unknown ruler more than Ur-Namma does.

Three views of Ur-Namma: Click here to enlarge the picture.
The bust of the unknown Sumerian ruler ties together all the other
images of Ur-Namma. The other statues of Ur-Namma (shown above)
are really quite small; they're little more than "figurines". Even so, their
level of detail is remarkable because they faithfully record the
unique combination of facial features that makes Ur-Namma easily
recognizable. The bust of the "unknown ruler" is much larger. At thirteen
and a half inches, it is life-sized, and it's
more highly detailed. I would suggest that the statue of the unknown
Sumerian ruler is clearly modeled from life, with Ur-Namma himself
sitting for this portrait.
The statues of Ur-Namma are realistic. They carefully record how he
looked in life. There's no attempt to idealize his features into nullification
or to make him godlike and perfect. Instead, they show him as he really
was, with the heavy-lidded eyes and the ears that are perhaps too big.
These are not really "flaws", just the inbalance of features that gives
character to a man's face. It's what makes him a unique individual,
it makes him recognizable in a crowd.
There can be little doubt that this statue of Ur-Namma was modeled
from life, and that every attempt was made to show Ur-Namma as he
looked in person, without abstraction and without idealization. I would
suggest that this statue shows us exactly what Ur-Namma
looked like when he was a living man and a reigning king. To stare into the

face of this statue is to see the face of Ur-Namma, the man himself.
Which is exactly what it seemed like when I was staring at this picture.
It must have been a trick of the light, in the way the picture was
transmitted on the computer screen, that made it seem as if he was staring
back at me. And it must have been a trick of my mind, when I first said,
"That's Ur-Namma!", that he seemed to give me just the slightest nod,
with a bemused look on his face and a gleam in his eye that seemed to say,
"That's right". For a brief moment, I was face to face with Ur-Namma, the
greatest of the Sumerian kings,
who was also worshiped as a god. But I wasn't seeing a god or a king, just
the man himself.
In that brief instant I was looking into the face of Ur-Namma, across
4,000 years of history.

Ur-Namma and the unknown
ruler: They are clearly one and the same.
Anyone who has seen the pictures on this webpage could recognize Ur
Namma in other Sumerian works of art. And once they have seen the
picture of the unknown Sumerian ruler, they could recognize this man
(were he alive today) even if he was dressed in a suit and tie. That's how
recognizable he is. Ur-Namma's doesn't look like everyone else.
Note (9/14/2011): I have found a truly realistic statue of Gudea. When I
first wrote this page about Ur-Namma, I said he was the first recognizable
man (and king) in all of history,
but now the honor must go to Gudea because he predates Ur-Namma by a
few years.
See "The Face of Gudea".

Ur-Namma: This is the head of a statue in the Baghdad Museum. It is
labeled simply as a "male with a cap" (it's actually a shepherd hat, the
crown of a Sumerian king). It's displayed
on their website "Treasures of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad" (page 4, #34,
IM 41014). Surprisingly, it isn't cataloged under their classification of
"king". The statue is dated as
"Neo-Sumerian 2150 - 1950 B.C.", which is the historical age of Ur
Namma. It's origin is listed as Uruk, the same provenance that's
given for a foundation statue of Ur-Namma in their collection. Uruk was
Ur-Namma's home town. From this angle, his eyes look asymmetrical,
with his right eye smaller and more heavy‐lidded than his left eye, though
it doesn't seem as pronounced as later images of him. Even if the eyes are
not overly asymmetrical, I still say this is Ur-Namma, based on the hat
alone. Not all shepherd hats were the same.
For instance, Gudea wears a different kind of crown; his crown has a
straight brim and it has the stylized curls of a fleece shepherd's hat. On the
other hand, this crown is smooth, with a fluted brim (it’s really quite
jaunty) and it looks exactly like the crown on all the other images of Ur
Namma. Since the face is beardless, it may represent Ur-Namma when he

was young. The statue of the "unknown ruler" shows Ur-Namma in his
later years. I suggest that the earliest portraits of Ur-Namma did not
emphasize the asymmetry of his eyes. I believe that
Ur-Namma as a young man was self-conscious about his ptosis. A
drooping eyelid is not a kingly look. People expected their kings to have no
outward signs of disability or imperfection. To superstitious minds, a
physical deformity could be a sinister sign, a mark of disfavor by the gods.
The young Ur-Namma was probably dismayed by the new realism in royal
portraiture that was recently begun by Gudea. For his part, Gudea had no
problem portraying himself realistically because his face was charismatic
(see below). His son Ur-Ningirsu also had no problem with realistic
portraits because he was actually quite handsome. At first, Ur-Namma
must have been reluctant to portray himself realistically. He would prefer
a stylized depiction of himself which minimized his ptosis. However, once
he embraced the concept of realist portraiture, he did it wholeheartedly.
Thereafter, all his portraits show the asymmetry of his eyes and his other
features.

Gudea (left) and his son Ur-Ningirsu.
Gudea, Ur-Ningirsu, and Ur-Namma, with their willingness to be
realistically portrayed, are the first truly recognizable men in all of history.
There were no earlier examples of Egyptian pharaohs who are
immediately recognizable by their facial features alone (and in
ancient Egypt, life-like depictions of the pharaohs never really did catch
on). This kind of
"photo realism" in a royal portrait would not occur again for another

fifteen centuries, at the time of the Greeks and Romans, in the statues of
Caesar and Alexander. Nor was there anything like it in ancient China.
During this period of history (about 2100 B.C.) when the
Sumerian civilization, already ancient, was at its apex and was soon to be
eclipsed, the Chinese civilization was just beginning to form. Nor was
there anything like this sculpture in the rest of the world. When this
sculpture was forged in metal, most of the rest of the world was still living
in the Stone Age.
Ur-Namma: Notice his heavy eyelids and
the rounded tip of his nose. His ears are prominent beneath his
shepherd's hat. In Sumer, a shepherd's hat is the crown of a king.
The "unknown" Sumerian ruler: Notice
how his ears are bent down, as if he is still wearing a shepherd's hat.
It's probable that the statue was adorned with a removable shepherd's
crown.
This is clearly the face of a man who was meant to rule.
There are several different places where this statue could have been

displayed: palace, temple, or city square. I agree with the Met's
assessment that this statue was once part of a temple setting since King
Ur-Namma was also worshiped as a god in his lifetime. Given the
importance of this statue, it was probably displayed in the temple where
Ur-Namma was worshiped as a god. In which case, the statue itself would
have been worshiped as a god, as the divine embodiment of Ur-Namma.
In the same way that the Mona Lisa is a masterpiece of painting and
Tablet #36 is a masterpiece of literature (as seen on these pages), the
"unknown Sumerian ruler" is a masterpiece of sculpture. Interestingly
enough, all of these works contain some element of mystery, but more
importantly, all of them are examples of the very best that can be
produced in their given art forms. The sculpture of the "unknown
Sumerian ruler" rivals the best sculptures of The Classical Age, fifteen
centuries before the Greeks and Romans. The skill and artistry of the
unknown craftsman who created this piece should not be overlooked. He
created a living protrait in copper that rivals the painting of the Mona
Lisa, thirty-five centuries before Leonardo da Vinci.
As simply "an unknown Sumerian ruler", this sculpture is a rare and
valuable artifact. As a known portrait of Ur-Namma, it has great historical
importance. As an artistic masterpiece, it is a treasure. As a recognizable
portrait of a man, a king, and a living god, it is priceless.

1 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:25 PM



During my research for “The face of Ur-Namma”, I saw many
references on the Internet to “the unknown ruler”, variously ascribing it as
Akkadian, Elamite (Iranian), and Sumerian. The Metropolitan Museum of
Art has the statue’s origin as being “Iran or Mesopotamia”.
Their comments on the statue begin with the statement:
"During the later third millennium B.C., successive territorial empires
ruled Mesopotamia. The first—the Akkadian empire (2350–2150 B.C.)
was centered at Agade, a city still not located by archaeologists but
probably near modern Baghdad. The Akkadian language of this empire
was a Semitic language that differed greatly from Sumerian, which
previously had been the predominant language of Mesopotamia. In
addition to its political and economic innovations in administering a large
territory, the Akkadian court produced innovative art in a powerful and
naturalistic style."
This seems to suggest that the Met curators thought the statue was of
Akkadian origin.
However, after I informed the Met of my belief that 'the unknown ruler'
was in fact Ur-Namma, they (curiously) inserted the following sentence
into their comments:
"The headdress, however, is similar to that of later Middle Elamite small
figurines found at Susa, one of gold and the other of silver. The eyes,
eyebrows and nose also seem to render a related ethnic type. In the case of
the copper head, the statue may have been made for an Iranian ruler."
Which raises an interesting question: Is the “unknown ruler”
Akkadian, Elamite, or Sumerian?
Ethnicity:
Unlike the Met, I am unwilling to venture into ethnic stereotyping,
but I believe that there is nothing in the facial features of the unknown
ruler that definitely identifies him as being particularly Semitic, as seen
below. I will say that the rounded nose of the unknown ruler is
quite unlike the later artistic depictions of the Persians (Iranians) who are
usually portrayed with sharper, more angular features. Note, too, how the
artistic conventions for showing the curls of the beard is the same used for
all of the statues shown below:

Left to right: An unknown (high ranking) Babylonian god, probably
Enlil, given the number of horns on the helmet. Ur-Ningirsu
(Sumerian), the son of Gudea. Hammurabi (Babylonian)
and Sargon the Great (Akkadian). The Babylonians, Akkadians, and
Sumerians all used the same artistic conventions to portray gods and
kings. Click on the picture to enlarge it.
As for the eyebrows, the Met is probably referring to the fact that the
unknown ruler doesn't have the “joined eyebrows” commonly seen on
Sumerian and Akkadian statues. The joined eyebrows are a stylistic
convention that symbolizes “beauty”. They are quite noticeable on the
images of Gudea, which are very formal and stylized. The joined eyebrows
are not to be seen on all of the statues of Ur-Namma, which are more
natural and life-like.
The lack of joined eyebrows is one of the reasons why I believe the statue
is of Ur-Namma,
who, unlike other ancient kings, chose to represent himself the way he
looked in real life.
In regard to the shape of the eyes, they are distinctive only because they
are heavy-lidded,
which is one of the distinguishing features of Ur-Namma. Otherwise the

3 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:25 PM



shape of the eyes is typical for statues of this period. (As for me,
personally, I’m glad that the eyes of this statue are missing.
Inlaid eyes always look artificial, even on the realistic statues of the Greeks
and Romans. They always give the face a startled expression, like this
statue of Augustus.)
Middle Elamite figurine: 12th century B.C. Click on the picture to see
the silver version of this statue.
This is one of the Middle Elamite figurines mentioned in the Met's
comments. There is another silver one just like it. As can be seen in the
photo, the headdress on the figure is not really similar to the one worn by
the unknown ruler. In any case, the Elamite statues date
from a later period. The Middle Elamite period spans the years of 1500 to
1100 B.C., which
is well beyond the date range given by the Met for the statue of the the
unknown ruler
(2300-2000 B.C.). It is therefore not very useful for the purpose of making
The face of Ur-Namma, part II about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/54701.html
4 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:25 PM



comparisons.
There aren't any known artifacts from the Old Elamite period (2700
1600 B.C.) that are comparable to the statue of the unknown ruler, and it's
unreasonable to assume that the unknown ruler is the only
example of this kind of Elamite portraiture to survive the millennia. The
statue of the unknown ruler looks Sumerian or Akkadian, artistically
speaking, and
there is nothing about the statue that is distinctly Elamite.
Some examples of Elamite art can be found on the Iran Chamber
Society website.
The statue of the unknown ruler is mentioned in the article (about half
way down the page).
Perhaps surprisingly, the article claims the statue is Iranian (Elamite) in
origin. The article states, “The features have probably been coarsened by
the disintegration of the copper.
Thus the eyelids may seem heavier now than they originally were; the
nose, which seems
so thick as to suggest a feature characteristic of some individual, may
again have been accidentally enlarged.” This doesn't sound very
convincing. It is easy to see how the features of an artifact can be
diminished because of accident or erosion, but it is difficult to imagine
how they can possibly become enlarged. As previously noted, the heavy
lidded eyes and the
prominent nose are simply Ur-Namma’s distinguishing facial features. Ur
Namma made
no attempt to depict himself in an idealized manner, to make himself
look "prettier"
than he really was.
As for the possibility that the statue is Akkadian, it is a moot point.
After all, Ur-Namma was the king of Sumer and Akkad.

Headdress:
As for the “headdress” mentioned by the Met, it isn’t really a
headdress, at all. Notice how the headdress of the unknown ruler is not
three-dimensional; it lies flat on his head.
Royal headdresses are always more grandiose. They were taller, to make
the ruler seem
more imposing., and they were more “showy”. Could anyone recognize a
king in a crowd
if he was wearing this kind of headdress? This would be the most
The face of Ur-Namma, part II about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/54701.html
6 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:25 PM



inconspicuous crown
ever worn by a ruler in the history of the world. During my research into
Akkadian, Elamite, and Sumerian history, I was unable to find a royal
headdress that looked even remotely like this one. That's because it isn’t
really a headdress; it's a soft fabric “skullcap”, the kind worn under a
crown or a helmet. A Sumerian king wore a shepherd’s hat as a crown, but
there’s no reason to assume it was made of wool like a real shepherd’s hat.
The crown was probably made of gold, as befitted a king, so it would
require a soft lining. The diagonal lines on the headdress suggest the
supporting straps beneath a crown or helmet. As mentioned in “The Face
of Ur-Namma”, this statue was probably adorned with a shepherd’s crown.
This is the reason why the ears are bent down, to accommodate the crown.
The statue of the unknown ruler is simply Ur-Namma without his hat.
Ur-Namma: Notice how his ears are bent beneath his shepherd's hat. In
the profile photo seen above, notice how the ears are bent at the exact
angle that Ur-Namma wears his hat.
It has always been assumed that the fringe seen beneath his hat was
his hair, but it is probably a lining for his crown, since it exactly follows
the brim. It was probably made of lamb's fleece, and it was part of the
skullcap that was worn under his crown. It can be seen
on the images of the unknown ruler.
There is one more aspect of this statue that needs to be addressed: To
cast a life-size copper statue was a major undertaking in 2100 B.C.,
requiring considerable resources and technical expertise. An
important statue like this one would only be made for a god or a king
(Ur‐Namma was both). It is not just a god; it's too human to be a god (a
god with big ears?) and it doesn't have the horned helmet of a god. There
are no Sumerian depictions of the gods, in metal, stone, or seal
The face of Ur-Namma, part II about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/54701.html
7 of 11 8/18/2020, 3:25 PM



impressions, where a god is depicted without a horned helmet. An
important life-sized metal sculpture like this one would not have been
made for some two-bit Elamite chieftain (the Sumerians considered the
Elamites to be uncivilized barbarians). Nor would this statue be made for
a minor king of some small city-state. Only an important king like Ur
Namma, who ruled two entire nations (Sumer and Akkad), would merit
the creation of this very important statue.
Here I must confess my own personal prejudice in regard to the
Elamites. In 2004 B.C., about one hundred years after the death of Ur
Namma, the Elamites sacked Ur-Namma’s capital city of Ur (“Inside Ur
there is death, outside it there is death. Inside it we are to be finished off
by famine. Outside it we are to be finished off by Elamite weapons. In Ur
the enemy oppresses us, oh, we are finished." Lament for Sumer and Ur).
The Elamites thus destroyed Sumerian civilization. So I’m not wild about
the Elamites. Needless to say, neither was Ur-Namma. After the sack of
Ur, the last surviving king of Ur-Namma's royal dynasty, Ibbi‐Suen,
was hauled away "in fetters" back to Elam. The statue of Ur-Namma
doubtlessly followed Ibbi-Suen into Elamite captivity; so it would be one
of history’s ultimate ironies if the Met was to persist in identifying Ur
Namma as an Elamite.
The Sumerian sign for Elam. See a tablet dated the year Ur
was besieged (destroyed) by the Elamites.
The provenance of the statue hasn’t been published. In any case,
it wouldn’t matter. This statue wasn't found in its original location (it was
dicovered in Azerbaijan). It was probably carried away as booty, perhaps
several times, in the many wars that occurred in the region
during the course of history.
I would suggest that the statue’s unmistakable resemblance to Ur
Namma overrides the vagaries of the archaeological context in which it
was discovered, along the lines of, “If it looks like a duck. . .” Even if this
statue was found in Egypt, it would still be Ur-Namma. Even if it
was wearing a beanie, it would still be Ur-Namma.

Ur-Namma: 3/4 view.
So, to summarize:
1) The "unknown ruler" looks like Ur-Namma, with the same heavy
lidded eyes, rounded nose, large ears, and the same mouth. The chin and
cheek bones also match, as does the asymmetry of the eyes. It matches in
the frontal, both left and right profiles, and the 3/4 views.
2) It matches all of the other known statues of Ur-Namma, ones
which have his name engraved on them.
3) The unknown ruler doesn't have any other distinguishing facial
feature that shows he is someone different than Ur-Namma.
4) Ur-Namma's unusual combination of facial features is so unique,
the unknown ruler can hardly be anyone else. If you still don’t believe that
the unknown ruler is Ur-Namma, then try this experiment. Ur-Namma
looks unlike anyone else in history.
5) Ur-Namma's reign, 2112 - 2095 B.C., falls about mid way in the
date range given by the Met for the manufacture of the statue: 2300
2000 B.C.
6) The place for the manufacture of the statue is also the same given
by the Met: Mesopotamia (Sumer, not Iran).
7) Ur-Namma chose to represent himself as he looked in real life.
He and Gudea are the only known exceptions to rule that ancient kings
portrayed themselves in a stylistic and idealized manner.
8) The ears of the unknown ruler are bent at the exact angle that Ur
Namma wears his crown.

9) The statue of the unknown ruler looks Sumerian (or Akkadian)
artistically speaking, and it doesn't resemble any known Elamite artifact.
10) Ur-Namma is the only king, at that time and place, who was
important enough
to merit a life-sized copper statue. He had the
resources (money) necessary to commission a very expensive work of art,
and he had the skilled artisans who had technical expertise that is
necessary to manufacture such a difficult statue.
I can understand why the Metropolitan Museum of Art may be
reluctant to recognize that the statue is Ur-Namma, without a known
provenance, but I suggest that we don't need
to have Ur-Namma's name carved into his head of this statue to know that
it's Ur-Namma
(just look at all of the pictures above). I further suggest that the unknown
ruler's unmistakable and undeniable resemblance to all other known
images of Ur-Namma is provenance enough.
For example: One time many years ago I turned on the TV in the
middle of a program. It showed two archaeologists standing behind a
statue that they had just discovered.
I took one look at the statue and said, "That's Alexander the Great". The
archaeologists were droning on and on, talking about this and that, and I
was about to jump out of my seat.
I was saying, "It's Alexander! Don't you know it's Alexander?" Eventually,
they got around
to identifying the statue as Alexander. They knew it was Alexander and so
did I, even though
the statue didn't have his name written on it. How did we know this?
Because it looks like Alexander, and no one else. The same is true for the
"unknown ruler"; it looks like
Ur-Namma, and it doesn't look like anyone else in all of history.
Hopefully the Met will not be too conservative in its estimation of the
statue, so that
it may one day get the attention it truly deserves.

of Heaven. I was given strength by the god Ningublaga. Utu the sun god
endowed me with eloquence. Nintur assisted in my birth and Enki treated
me kindly. I was loved by Inanna, the goddess of war. Because of my broad
wisdom and understanding, I was entrusted by An with the kingship of
the Land. The god Enlil called me by an auspicious name.
He beamed at me approvingly
and decreed for me a great destiny for all of time.
For all of time.
I am Ur-Namma, the mighty king of Ur! I am the protecting genius of my
city. Wickedness cannot pass unnoticed before my eyes! I am the
knowledgeable judge. I strike against those guilty of capital offenses and
make them tremble! No evildoer dares to lay his hands on the
holy statues. I clamp down on evildoers, who will be caught like snakes,
and I place my foot on the necks of thieves and criminals!
Ur, city as beautiful as the sky, colorfully decorated, the home of the
gods, the white terraces of your temples are like clouds in the midst of
heaven. Your gate is the blue sky; only when it is opened does Utu
illuminate the horizon.
I am Ur-Namma, the ornament of all the lands. I made Ur resplendent. I
made Sumer flourish with joy in days filled with prosperity and I caused
the people to eat splendid food. Because of me, Ur-Namma, the king of Ur
for whom a favorable destiny was determined, the roads have been made
passable. In the desert the roads are made up as if for a festival; the roads
are passable because of me. The joy in my city of Ur and the territory of
Sumer delights me.
The lord rides high in the city of Ur. The lord rides high in joy!
Utu the sun god marches before me.
I am Ur-Namma, the cosmic bond of Sumer. I am the radiance that covers
the nation. I am
the lord of great wisdom who acts as the constable. I place a shackle on all
the hostile foreign countries, and I block the way to Sumer with a strong
bolt. Wickedness cannot pass!
I fill the wicked lands with my battle cry! In the whole extent of heaven
and earth, no one can escape battle with me. Enlil, the lord Nu-nam-nir,
gave to me the lofty mace that heaps up human heads like piles of dust in

the hostile foreign countries. With the mace that heaps up
piles of human heads, I smash the rebel lands. I beat down the foreign
rebel lands, and I trample them underfoot!
For I am Ur-Namma, the mighty man. The king of Ur. The king of Sumer
and Akkad.
It all started so many years ago, when I was but a youth, when I first
caught the eye of Enlil.
With my brother Utu-hengal, the mighty man, the king of Uruk, the king
of the four quarters, the king whose orders cannot be countermanded, I
helped wipe out the name of Gutium, the fanged snake of the mountains
who acted with violence against the gods, who carried off the
kingship of Sumer to foreign lands, who filled Sumer with wickedness,
who took away spouses from the married and took away children from the
parents, who made wickedness and violence normal in the Land. We drove
the Gutians out of Sumer and Akkad.
After the storm, after the month had been completed, upon the death of
my beloved brother Utu‐hengal, Enlil looked around among the people.
Enlil chose me by extispicy on a day that was very auspicious for him. The
great god Enlil chose me from the multitude of people, making me the
mightiest in the Land. Enlil caused me to arise from my family to become
the good shepherd of the Sumerians, the civilized people. He beamed at
me approvingly and bestowed the kingship on me. Thus I became the king
of Sumer and Akkad. For me, the kingship had been sent from heaven. I
became a living god.
The people lined up before me. I lifted my head up high. I was the tallest
of all the lords, appearing as the noblest among them.
Seldom before had there been a single king for all of Sumer. The many
Sumerian city-states often battled each other for supremacy in the Land:
“Who was king? Who was not king?” Because of this disunity, for the last
two centuries, since the days of Sargon the Great, the Akkadians were
the masters and the Sumerians were the vassals. I, Ur-Namma, was now
the undisputed king of both nations. Now Sumer and Akkad walk the
same path. My wise judgments create concord in Sumer and Akkad. As if I
were fire, even my frowning is enough to create concord. For I am Ur
Namma, the king of Sumer and Akkad.

The lord rides high in the city of Ur. The lord rides high indeed!
I am the king of the Land!
Detail from the Ur-Namma stele: Above: Ur-Namma stands before
Enlil and the Tree of Life. Below: Enlil leads Ur-Namma and a worker to
begin work on a new temple.
The divine plans of brick-built E-Kur were drawn up. The god Enlil had
made up his mind. Filled with pure and useful thoughts, he made them
shine like the sun for the E-Kur, his august shrine. He told me to make the
E-Kur rise high. I myself prepared the brick mold. At the dedication of the
temple, I solemnly carried the first bricks for the temple in a woven
basket on my head. The foundations were laid down firmly and the holy
foundation pegs were driven in. The enkum and ninkum priests praised it
duly, and Enki made the temple rejoice with his artful incantations.
I made the E-Kur, the Mountain Temple, grow high in Dur-an-ki, “The
Bond of Heaven and Earth.” It was wonderful to behold by the multitudes
of people. The eyebrow-shaped arches of the Lofty Gate, the Great Gate,
the Gate of Peace, the Gate of Perpetual Grain Supplies,
these gates I made glittering by covering them with refined silver. The
Anzud bird runs there, and an eagle seizes enemies in its claws. The
temple is lofty; it is surrounded with a fearsome radiance.

In the Gagiššua of the great palace, Ninlil rendered her verdicts in
grandeur. Ninlil the great mother was glad. Enlil and his wife Ninlil, my
queen, relished it there. In its great dining hall, I had them enjoy a
magnificent meal. They looked at me with approval. The E-Kur rejoiced.
Enlil decreed for me a favorable destiny for all of time. He spoke:
"I am the Great Mountain, Father Enlil, whose firm commands and
decisions are immutable! You have made my lofty E-Kur shine gloriously;
you have raised it high with brilliant crenellations. Trustworthy hero, you
have made it shine gloriously in the Land. Ur-Namma, mighty lord, may
your kingship be unparalleled, may your fame spread to heaven's borders,
as far as the foot of the mountains!"
When Nanna the moon god wanted a new temple for himself, I built for
him the towering ziggurat at Ur, its terrace surrounded with a fence of
gold and lapis lazuli. At the dedication of the temple, I inspected the
foundation statue of me. This was important. I carefully read the
inscription, making sure it was written correctly. Then I looked into the
face of the statue, making sure it looked like me. I put it in the foundation
box, and watched as it was buried by the priests. Thus I presented myself
to the gods for all eternity, for all of time. For Nanna, my master, I built
his temple as if it were a verdant hillside. I would not live to see it
completed.
Ur-Namma is the mightiest in the land, the first among the people!
Not only did I serve the gods, I served the people.
I accomplished quite an achievement – justice! I made justice apparent. I
codified the laws of the land; I was the first in the world to do so. I did it
three hundred years before that Babylonian, Hammurabi! As a
knowledgeable judge, I struck against those guilty of capital offenses and
made them tremble. I placed my foot on the necks of thieves and
criminals!
I brought peace and security to the Land. There was no civil war between
the city-states during my reign. I declared an amnesty for all the people.
I am a source of joy for the Land; my life indeed creates! Fields of barley
are resplendent under my rule. Since I have been adorned with the
kingship, no one imposes taxes on my abundant crops, which grow tall.
The owner of the fields walks through the barley; it rises

up to his chest. I have drained the marshes, and I have freed the sons of
the poor from
their duty of going to fetch firewood. I straightened the road that runs
from north to south.
There now is joy and abundance in the city of Ur because of Ur-Namma.
Sweet is the praise of me, the shepherd Ur-Namma!
Once again, I was called to defend my people against the savage hands of
the Gutians.
So once again, I went to war. I have a terrible fame in the houses of the
rebellious lands.
I stormed the houses of the wicked; I destroyed the cities of the wicked.
With heavy
oppression I turned them into haunted places. The shepherd Ur-Namma
destroys the cities
of the wicked; I turn them into haunted places.
This was the year in my reign that I named “The year the land of the
Gutians was destroyed." It was a very good year.
After I made the evil-doers return to their homeland, I returned to my
beloved city of Ur. I loaded its grain on barges; I delivered it to the
storehouses. I directed ships to both the Karĝeština of Enlil and the lapis
lazuli quay of Nanna. I returned the citizens to their homes, and I restored
the walls that had been torn down. I am the foremost workman of Enlil.
Who will dig it? Who will dig it? Who will dig the canal? Wealthy Ur
Namma will dig it. The trustworthy prosperous youth will dig it.
For the people of Sumer, I am their Enkimdu, their god of irrigation and
cultivation. For my beloved people of Sumer, I built not just one canal, but
several. I was proud to name two of the year-names of my reign for these
canals.
I release life-giving water into the canals of Sumer, making the trees grow
tall on their banks. The watercourse of my city is full of fish, and the air
above it is full of birds. Its arable tracts grow fine grain, sprouting
abundantly like a forest.
Ur-Namma is the source of joy for the Land; his life indeed creates!
I am clad in linen in a ĝipar, the cloister of a lukur priestess. I lie down on

the splendid bed in its delightful bedchamber. Today, I have enacted the
Sacred Marriage of the gods with the lukur priestess of Nintur, my lady,
the goddess who gives life. Tonight, our union will bring fertility to the
fields, to the sheepfolds and the cattle-pens, to the people, and to the gods
themselves. There are many goddesses in the land of Sumer, and many
pretty priestesses.
It is good to be the king.
Ur-Namma is the good shepherd; may the population multiply!
To me, the shepherd Ur-Namma, let life be given as a reward.
For Inanna/ His queen/ Ur-Namma/ The mighty man/ The king of Ur/
The king of Sumer and Akkad/ Her temple/ He built
The Gutians, again. I thought I had destroyed them. Once again I was
called upon to defend my people against the savage hands of the Gutians.
Once again I went to war. I called upon my beloved Inanna, my lady of
war, and rushed to the battlefield.
In the vanguard of my troops, I led my soldiers into battle. Like a lion, I
roared my battle cry. Like a fierce storm flashing lightning, I plunged into
the fray.
I was wounded, but I fought on. I was wounded again; I fell to the ground.
Seeing this, my soldiers lost heart and fled in panic. A few brave heroes
fought to save me. They carried me from the battlefield, wounded and
bleeding.

Where was Inanna?
The entire land was struck. The palace was devastated. Panic spread
rapidly among the dwellings of my beloved people. The people abandoned
their homes. In Sumer, cities were destroyed in their entirety; the people
were seized with panic.
Evil came upon the city and made the trustworthy shepherd pass away.
It made Ur-Namma, the trustworthy shepherd, pass away.
An had altered his holy words completely; his words had become an empty
promise. Enlil, deceitfully, completely changed the fate he had decreed for
me. Because of this, Ninmah began a lament. Enki shut the great door of
the Eridug temple. Nudimmud withdrew into his bedchamber and lay
down fasting. At his zenith, Nanna the moon god frowned at the words
of An, the lord of the heavens. Utu the sun god did not come forth in the
sky. The day was full of sorrow.
My mother, miserable because of her son, holy Ninsumun, the mother of
the king was crying "Oh my heart!” because the fate decreed for Ur
Namma had been overturned. The fate for her son had been overturned.
She was weeping bitterly in the broad square, which had once been
a place of entertainment.
The wise shepherd does not give orders any more, in battle and combat.
He was taken to the city of Ur. The king of the Land was brought into the
house. The proud one lay in his palace.
My pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted. My pleasing sacrifices
were treated as if they were dirty. The Anuna gods refused my gifts. In
heaven, An would not say, "It is enough." He would not complete my days.
Because of what Enlil ordered, there was no more rising up. My beloved
people had lost their wise one.
His appointed time had arrived. He passed away in his prime.
I lay down my head and died.
I, Ur-Namma, the mighty man, king of Ur, king of Sumer and Akkad, had
passed away.
Silence descended upon the land of Sumer. The plains did not grow lush
grass anymore; they grew the grass of mourning. The farmer’s fertile fields
yielded him little because the vigor of the land had died.

I, Ur-Namma, the true shepherd, had passed away. I was in my prime.
My body was brought to Arali, the preeminent place of the Land. The
soldiers who accompanied their king shed tears. Ur-Namma, their boat,
their ship of state, was sunk in a land as foreign to them as Dilmun. The
ship was buried in saltpeter. I was buried in saltpeter.
His steeds and his chariots are to be found with Ur-Namma; they were
buried with him.
The roads were thrown into disorder. The roads that once were made up
as if for a festival were thrown into disorder; no one could go up or
down them. Thus in the confusion I was buried in secret. No one knows
where I lay.
Sweet sleep did not come to the people of Sumer. They passed their time
in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched
away.
Alas, my wife had spent her days in tears and bitter laments as my
strength ebbed away. Now my wife has become a widow. She is cast adrift
like a boat in a raging storm. Her kind protective god has left her, and her
kind protective goddess, holy Ninsumun, does not care for her anymore.
My mother, Ninsumun, no longer rests her august arm firmly upon my
wife. Nanna, Lord Ašimbabbar, no longer leads her by the hand. Enki, the
lord of Eridug, does not comfort her. She has been silenced; she can no
longer answer. Like a lioness lured into a perilous pit, she has been treated
heavy-handedly. Like a lioness fallen into a pitfall, a guard has been set up
for her. Like a dog kept in a cage, she is silenced. Utu does not pay heed to
her cries of "Oh my king!" overwhelming her.
My wife is treated so heavy-handedly? What treachery is this?
The fate decreed for Ur-Namma had been overturned.
While I was so treated, foremost Inanna, my warlike lady, was not present
at my verdict. Enlil sent her as a messenger to all the foreign lands, saying
it concerned important matters.
After Inanna had turned her gaze away from the foreign lands, she humbly
entered the shining E‐kur. Then she saw Enlil’s fierce brow. Enlil said,
"Great lady of the E-ana, once someone has bowed down, he cannot rise
again. The trustworthy shepherd, you cannot see him anymore." Then my

lady Inanna, the fierce storm, the eldest child of Suen, made the heavens
tremble and the earth shake. Inanna destroyed cattle pens and devastated
sheepfolds, saying: "I want to hurl insults at An, the king of the gods
Who can change the matter if Enlil elevates someone? Who can change
the import of the august words uttered by An, the king? If there are divine
ordinances imposed on the Land but they are not observed, there will be
no abundance at the gods’ place of sunrise. My holy ĝipar, the shrine
E-ana, has been barred up like a mountain. If my shepherd cannot enter it
before me, I will not enter it otherwise! Why should I enter it otherwise?
Only if my strong one could grow for me like greenery in the desert would
I enter the ĝipar. Oh, if only he could hold steady for me like a river boat at
its calm mooring." This is how the holy Inanna, my beloved goddess of
war, how my lady Inanna spoke to the gods. She alone defended me.
I descended into the netherworld, the land of no return. The journey to the
netherworld is a desolate route.
I presented gifts to the seven chief porters of the netherworld. When the
famous kings who had died, and the dead išib priests, lumaḫ priests, and
the nindiĝir priestesses, all chosen by extispicy, announced my coming to
the people, a tumult arose in the netherworld. Then I seated the people at
a huge banquet. For them, numerous bulls and sheep were slaughtered,
because the food of the netherworld is bitter, and the water of the
netherworld is brackish. The trustworthy shepherd knew well the rites of
the netherworld, so I presented my offerings to all the gods. To Nergal,
the Enlil of the netherworld, I offered a mace, a large bow, and an
artfully made dagger. To Gilgamesh, my brother, the king of the
netherworld, I offered a spear, a heavenly lion-headed mace, and a shield.
To the valiant warrior Ninĝišzida I offered a chariot with wheels
sparkling of gold. To all the gods of the netherworld I presented as many
faultless bulls, faultless kids, and fatted sheep that I could bring.
Lord Ninĝišzida seated me on a great dais and set up a dwelling place for
me in the netherworld. At the command of Ereškigala, all the soldiers who
had been killed by weapons and all the men who had been found guilty
were given into my hands. I, Ur-Namma, with my beloved brother
Gilgamesh, will issue the judgments of the netherworld and render the
decisions of the netherworld.
Like my younger brother Gilgamesh, I could not be reconciled to death.

After ten days passed, the lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed me; my
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed me. My king's heart was full of tears. I
complained bitterly that I could not complete the wall around the city of
Ur. I could no longer enjoy the new palace I had built.
I could no longer bring pleasure to my wife with my embrace, or hold my
sons on my knees. I would never see in their prime the beauty of their
little sisters, who had not yet grown up.
I, Ur-Namma, the trustworthy shepherd, made a heart-rending lament for
myself. "I, who have been treated like this, served the gods well, set up
chapels for them. I created evident abundance for the Anuna gods. I laid
treasures on their beds strewn with fresh herbs.
Yet no god stood by me and soothed my heart. Because of them, anything
that could have been a favorable portent for me was as far away as the
heavens. What is my reward for my eagerness to serve the gods during the
days? My days have been finished for serving them sleeplessly during the
night! Now, just as rain pouring down from heaven cannot turn back,
alas, I cannot return to the brick-built city of Ur.
How iniquitously was Ur-Namma abandoned by the gods, like a broken
jar!
Lord Ninĝišzida, god of the netherworld, god of healing, spoke to me
among the tears and laments. He decreed a fate for me. "Ur-Namma, you
will be remembered. Your august name will be called upon, from the
southlands to the uplands, to your palace. The people will admire
the canals you dug, the large and grand arable tracts you created, the
reedbeds you drained, and the wide barley fields that you caused to grow.
In the fortresses and settlements which you have made, they will call upon
your name to drive away the evil spirits. Ur-Namma, you shall always
be remembered."

Ur-Namma in the Netherworld:
I lived in the eternal twilight of the netherworld. The food I had brought
did not last for long;
so like everyone else, I ate the bitter food of the netherworld, I drank the
brackish water.
I never learned what I did to offend the gods.
Was I too proud? Did I praise myself too extravagantly? Did I overreach
myself? Did I need to be reminded that I was just a mortal man?
Was it because I loved war too much? Did I too greatly love Inanna, my
warlike lady?

Surely this was not the reason I was laid so low. I did what I had to do. I
died in defense
of my kingdom and my people. It was a fitting end for a king. Every king
should do as much.
Enlil never told me the reason why the gods were so offended. This is what
made my fate
so difficult to bear; not knowing, to always be wondering, “Why?”
I never did forgive the gods, Enlil in particular, for whom I had done so
much. I never forgave his lies, his betrayal.
When the soldiers killed in battle descended into the netherworld
and stood before me, I would ask, “What news do you have from Sumer?
What news do you have of my family?” From them I learned that my son
Shulgi reigned for 48 glorious years. Shulgi was just like his father. He was
proud and boastful, just like me, and just as capable. He was also very
educated. He could correct the grammar of the Gutian ambassadors in
their own language! Shulgi was musically and artistically inclined. During
his reign, Sumer enjoyed a cultural renaissance. I was very proud of him.
Lucky is the man who has such a worthy son.
So, in a way, I was able to enjoy the contented old age that had
been denied to me on earth, watching my son grow and mature. This took
away some of the bitterness of my fate.
In Sumer I was still worshiped as a god. The statue made for me when I
was a living man
was worshiped as a god. Unlike other kings of the past, I did not portray
myself as “pretty”
and perfect. My people already knew that I wasn't handsome like Gudea. I
wanted them
to look into the face of my statue and see me as I really was; to recognize
me, Ur-Namma, their king. My statue was crowned with a gold shepherd’s
hat and draped with golden robes. It was imbued with magic by the lumah
priests. Through the eyes of the statue I could still see the people bow
down before it, touching their noses to the ground. Through the ears of
the statue I could still hear the people's prayers to me, even in the
netherworld.
So things continued for almost a hundred years. Shulgi died and ascended

to heaven; as did his successors, Amar-Suen and Shu-Suen. All Sumerian
kings ascend to heaven to live amid the stars. Gilgamesh and I were the
only god-kings to be consigned to the netherworld.
Enlil had seen to that. There's not a lot to do in the netherworld, so I was
restless and bored.
I was never reconciled to my fate, but I got used to it. I learned to live with
it.
Gradually I started receiving bad news about my beloved Sumer from the
soldiers who descended into the netherworld. First there was drought,
then famine. Then the barbarians started crowding the borders. The last
king of my dynasty, Ibbi-Suen, was having difficulties trying to hold
everything together. He was a good man, brave and strong, but he was
not the best judge of character. He allowed himself to be cheated by Ishbi
erra, a petty little king who took twenty talents of silver for desperately
needed grain supplies, then reneged on their delivery. Then in the
ultimate betrayal, while Ibbi-Suen was valiantly fighting our enemies in
the north, the traitor Ishbi-erra switched alliances, leaving Ibbi-Suen
outflanked in the south. Ibbi-Suen had to beat a hasty retreat back to
Sumer. Meanwhile, Ishbi-erra began to carve out his own little kingdom in
the region and he even made pretensions to the throne of Sumer! Ibbi
Suen did nothing; he let Ishbi-erra get away with it. Had I been there,
Ishbi-erra would have been treated differently. He would have felt my
mace on his skull!
Then, disaster. From the thousands of dead Sumerian soldiers suddenly
pouring into the netherworld, I learned that Sumer was under full-scale
attack by the Amorites from the west, the Gutians from the north, and the
Elamites from the east.
One by one the cities of Sumer fell to the invading hordes of Amorites,
Gutians, and Elamites; barbarians by any other name. One by one the
cities fell, until only Ur, my beloved city of Ur, was all that was left to Ibbi
Suen.
After a prolonged siege of Ur, the Elamites broke through the walls around
the city, the walls that I had built. The Elamites poured into the city;
killing, raping, burning, pillaging.
Breaches were made in the walls; the people groaned. On the lofty city
gates where walks had been taken, corpses were piled. On the boulevards
I am Ur-Namma about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/27601.html
15 of 23 8/18/2020, 3:26 PM



where festivals had been held, heads lay scattered. In the places where
the dances of the Land had taken place,
people were stacked in heaps. They made the blood of the Land flow
down the streams
like copper or tin. The corpses, like fat in the sun, were left to melt away
of themselves.
(Lament for Urim)
I wept for Sumer; I wept for my beloved city of Ur.
That night, in the glow of my burning city, a gang of marauding Elamites
with weapons drenched in the blood of my people, burst into my temple
looking for plunder. They crashed through the door of my inner-sanctum.
They saw my golden crown and robes gleaming in the light of the lamps.
They gave a shout and raced toward me. When they got closer,
they suddenly stopped. The barbarians looked into my face, the face of a
god. They just
stood there dumbfounded. The Elamites had never seen a lifelike face on a
statue. In the flickering light of the oil lamps, I must have seemed to them
like a living god of molten metal. Clearly I wasn’t someone to be lightly
reckoned with. After a moment, the leader started shouting loudly at his
men, giving orders. The men formed into a semicircle around me,
facing outward like a bodyguard. It wasn’t for my sake. They meant
to defend me against other looters, so they could present me to their
general and collect a reward.
The next day, in the smoking ruins that had once been my beautiful city of
Ur, the men dared to put their savage hands on my statue! With much
sweating, grunting, and cursing, they managed to load my heavy statue
onto a wagon. My statue was secured to the wagon
with ropes. I was like a war captive. Through the eyes of the statue,
I watched as Ibbi-Suen, the last king of my dynasty, in shackles and
looking frightened and disheveled, was dragged to the front of the wagon
and kicked to the ground by the hooting Elamites. After he was
cruelly beaten, he was pulled up from the ground by his beard. Then Ibbi
Suen was clamped into a neckstock. He would lead the way as we made
the long march to Elam.
That day I died again. I had died once before, as a man, when I was
wounded in battle.

I died again, as a king, when I was led into Elamite captivity.
Never again would I see my beloved city of Ur.
We were paraded through the stinking streets of the Elamite capital,
hissed and booed and spat at by the natives. We were taken to the “palace”
of the barbarian king. I watched while Ibbi-Suen, still shackled, was
roughly hauled before the Elamite king and forced to his knees.
After a short boastful speech by the king, Ibbi-Suen was made to lie on the
ground, face up. Then the Elamite king ceremoniously, and none too
gently, placed his foot on the neck of Ibbi‐Suen, to the shouts and jeers of
the people. Ibbi-Suen would later die a humiliating death at the hands of
his captors. He never should have allowed himself to be taken alive.
Next, the barbarian king turned his attention to me. He walked up to me,
full of insolence, greedily admiring my golden robes and crown. When he
got closer, he stopped in his tracks. He was surprised, like the soldiers in
the temple, by my living face. He stepped up to me, gingerly. He put his
ugly monkey face close to mine. He gulped noticeably. Oh how I wanted
to plant my fist into his face! Then he stepped back, as if he had read my
intent. With a wide sweep of his arm, the barbarian king made some joke
that I didn’t understand, to the nervous laughter of his audience.
For a while, I was displayed in his palace. I was an object of curiosity, to be
gawked at
by the visiting dignitaries; but the Elamite king never seemed comfortable
in my presence,
so he ordered that my statue be destroyed.
The king’s soldiers first stripped off my golden robes. The evildoers had
dared to lay their savage hands on my holy statue! One of the soldiers
took off my shepherd’s crown of gold. The stupid monkey danced around
with my crown on his head, making a mockery of me. Then my head was
removed from its dowel-socket. It would later be displayed again in the
palace of the barbarian king, like a head taken in battle. It was the only
way the Elamite king could feel comfortable in my presence. Then my holy
statue was chopped to pieces for the valuable copper that it
contained. My holy statue was chopped to pieces, to make Elamite
pots and pans, to make Elamite swords and weapons.
In the netherworld, there was nothing left to do. No more dead Sumerian

soldiers descended into the netherworld to be judged by their king. Now
soldiers fought and died for other kings; they were judged by other gods,
in other regions of the netherworld.
All the people who ever knew me when I was a living man had died
off long ago. By now,
I was no longer a living memory in the minds of my people.
I was still worshiped as a god, fervently, by some Sumerians. They seemed
to hope that I could somehow help them, that I could throw off the yoke
that had been placed upon them. They called upon my name to chase away
the evil spirits.
I desperately wanted to help, but what could I do? I was still trapped in
the netherworld. I became numb with grief and helplessness. It was like I
was paralyzed. I grew weaker
every day.
The prayers became fewer and fewer as hope faded away. Then one day
the prayers stopped. There would be no more prayers for me.
For the third time, I died. I had died as a man; I had died as a king; and
now I died as a god.
I, Ur-Namma, the living god, was dead.
The Babylonians, the inheritors of Sumerian civilization, still knew who I
was. They did not remember me directly, but at least they knew who I was.
They wrote praise poems for me, they recorded my heroic deeds.
Sumerian history became Babylonian history. School boys learned of my
exploits. I am grateful to the Babylonians; were it not for them, I would
have been completely forgotten.
As the centuries passed, even the Babylonians started to forget about me.
Fewer and fewer Babylonians knew about me. Only a few
historians – scribal, scholarly kinds of men – remembered who I was. I
had become the faintest of memories.
Eventually, even the Babylonians forgot about me. They forgot their
Sumerian roots. The Babylonians had become too “Babylonian”.
In their turn, it was the Babylonians who were destroyed, in the constant
rise and fall of civilizations that is the history of the world. The clay tablets
recording my heroic deeds were buried beneath yet another collapsing

civilization.
I, Ur-Namma, “the king of eternal fame", was completely forgotten.
So much for the prophecy of Enlil, who had decreed for me great destiny
for all of time,
for all of time.
Enlil, too, was forgotten. All the Sumerian gods were forgotten; An, the
Lord of Heaven; Utu the sun god; Nanna the moon god; Inanna, my lady
of love and war; and all the rest of the Sumerian gods, they were all
forgotten.
All the Sumerian kings were forgotten. Even the Sumerian people and
their glorious history were forgotten.
It’s as if we never were, as if we had never walked the face of the earth.
At last, complete oblivion. I was no longer tormented by my fate and the
fate of my people. Sweet and welcome, complete oblivion had come at last.
I awoke into a dream, the sunlight blinding my eyes.
My holy statue had been found. Well, the head at least; the body had
disappeared long ago. The head was dug up from beneath the ruins of yet
another burned city that had been destroyed in the numerous wars
that occurred in history. It was discovered in Azerbaijan, wherever that is.
Four thousand years had passed. Four thousand years!
I was in a strange and wondrous world, unlike anything I could have
imagined. I was placed
in a box and driven across the land at an awesome speed in a magic

chariot without horses. The box was opened; people stared into my face.
The box was closed. I was transported
here and there. This happened many times.
Then one day I flew (flew! even as a god I could not fly) across a boundless
ocean.
I eventually ended up at The Met Museum in a place called New York City,
wherever that is.
Sumer had been rediscovered! Men had been crawling like ants over the
ruins of my great ziggurat at Ur. Clay tablets, thousands of clay tablets,
had been found all across the region. At first, no one could read them.
They were thought to be Assyrian or Babylonian; no one
remembered Sumer. Over the course of a century, scribal scholarly kinds
of men had painstakingly learned how to read them. Thus they
rediscovered Sumer. It took a while for them to decipher my name (Ur
Gur, Ur-Engur, Ur-Nammu, and then Ur-Namma). The
administrative tablets of my kingdom were read. The Babylonian tablets
recording my deeds were read.
The scholars had resurrected Sumer, which had been buried so long ago.
They also resurrected the Sumerian gods, who had been completely
forgotten. An, Enlil, Utu, Enki, Inanna, and all the other Sumerian
gods, returned to the heavens. They still reign there in a
small part of heaven.
Still, nobody knew who I was. I was just a few lines in a history book. My
glorious deeds were but a footnote in the long history of the world. I was
just a name on a tablet, written in a script that only a few people in the
world could read. Nobody really knew who I was.
My foundation statues were rediscovered. I had thought they would lie
buried for all eternity.
I had made sure they looked like me, with the heavy-lidded eyes,
the large ears, the
rounded nose, and the asymmetry of my facial features. I didn't want to
present myself,
to the gods or to my people, looking like everyone else. My “Ur-Namma
Stele” was also discovered. It was heavily damaged, but there were several
images on it that looked exactly as I appeared in life (I had seen to that).
But no one recognized me. To them, the images of me were just a generic

portrait of “a man”, one that looked any other man.
The curators of the museum thought I was an Elamite. An Elamite! Of all
the indignities! This was to be my Second Elamite Captivity.
Every day, thousands of people filed past me in the museum; year after
year after year.
They stared into my face, they looked at me from all angles; but nobody
knew who I was.
I wanted to shout, “I am Ur-Namma! Don’t you know who I am?” But I
couldn’t, of course.
I was still stuck in limbo. I was still trapped in the netherworld.
Then one day someone finally recognized me. He was merely a scribe, but
at least
he recognized me for who I am.

I am Ur-Namma
The mighty man
The king of Ur
The king of Sumer and Akkad
Now everyone in the world knows who I am.
I am Ur-Namma, resurrected!
I have returned from the dead. I have arisen from the netherworld, the
land of no return, to burst upon the world in all my former glory.
I take my rightful place alongside Caesar and Alexander, Qin Shi Huang

and Charlemagne, and all the other great kings of the world.
Now when people look into my face, they will know exactly who I am: Ur
Namma, the man,
the king, the living god.
I cannot be buried and forgotten again beneath the ruins of another
collapsed civilization.
So Enlil was right all along when he decreed for me a great destiny for all
of time,
because I shall always be remembered.
So once again I am immortal. Once again, I am a god.
