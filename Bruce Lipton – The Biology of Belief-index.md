# Index for Bruce Lipton – The Biology of Belief.pdf

"Bru ce Lipton's book is the definitive su mmary of the new biology and all it implies. It is magnificent, profound beyond words, and a de light to read. It synthesizes an encyclopedia of critical new informa tion into a brilliant yet simp le package. These pages contain a genuine revo lution in thought and understanding, one so radical that it can change the world ." - Joseph Chil ton Pearce, PhD. Author of Magical Child and Evolution's End
"Bruce Lip ton's de lightfully-wri tten The Biology of Belief is a much.need edantido te to the "bottom-up" ma terialism of today's society. The idea that DNA encodes all of life's de velopment is being successfully employed in gene tic engineering. At the sam e time, the shortfall of this approach is becoming evident. The Biology of Belief is a review of a quarter-century of pioneering results in Epigenetics, he ralded by 17,e Wall Street Science Journal in mid-2004 as an importan t new field . Its personal style makes it eminently readable and enjoyable ." - Karl H. Pribram, MD ., PhD., (Hon. Mu lti) Professor Emeritus, Stanfo rd University
"Dr. Lipton is a geni us - his breakthrough discoveries give us tools for regaining the sovereignty over our lives. I recommend this book to an yone who is ready and w illing to take full responsibility for themselves and the destiny of our planet." - LeVar Burton Actor and Director
"Bru ce Lipton offers ne w .insights and understanding into the interface betw een biological organisms, the environment-and the influence of thought, perception an d subconscious awareness -on the expression of one's body healing po tential. Well-referenced explanations and exam ples make this boo k a refresh.ing 'm ust read' for the stu dent of the biological, social and hea lth care sciences . Yet the clarity of the author' s presentation makes it an enjoyable read for a general audience." - Carl Cleveland lIJ, D.C. President, Cleveland Chiropractic College
"Dr. Lipton 's revolutionary resea rch has unc overed the missing connections between biology, psychology and sp irituality. 1£ you want to understand the deepest mysteries of life, this is one of the mos t impor
tan t books you w ill ever read ." - Dennis Perman, D.C. Co-Founder, The Master's Circle

"This book is an absolute mu st read if you want to know, from a scientific v iew point, that your lifestyle is in control of your health rather than you r genetics. From a scientific vie wpoint, Lip ton demonstr ates tha t the min d is more pow erful than drugs to regain our health. The information reveals that your health is more your responsibility than just being a victim of your genes. When I started reading this book, I could not stop until it was finished ." - M. T. Morter, [r., D.C. Founde r, Morter Health System, Developer of the R EST. Technique
"This is a courageous and visionary book that provid es solid evidence from quantum biology to dispel the myth of genetic determinism - and implicitly, victimhood. Dr. Bruce Lipton brings a solid scientific mind to not only inform but to transform and empower the read er with the realization that our beliefs create eve ry aspect of our personal reality. A provocative and inspiring read!" - Lee Pulos, Ph.D., A.B.P.P. Professor Emeritus, University of British Columbia Author of Miracles and Other Realities and Beyond Hypnosis
"Hi story will record The Biology of Belief as one of the most important writings of our times. Bruce Lipton has delivered the missing link between the understandings of biomedi cine of the past and the essentials of energetic healing of the future. H is comp lex irtsigh ts are expressed in a readily un derst andable fashion with a sty le tha t welcomes the scientist and the non -scientist on an equal footing. For anyone interested in health, the we ll-being of the species an d the future of human life, The Biologtj of Belief is a mu st-read . The implications of the perspecti ves outlin ed have the po tential to change the world as we know it. Bruce Lipton' s understandings - and his concise expression of them - are sheer genius."

A CKN OW LE DGM E N T5
Much has transpired betw een my scientific inspiration and the creation of this book. During this time of great personal transformation, I was blessed and guided by both spiritual and incarnate muses -the inspiring sp irits of the arts. I am parti cularly indebted to the following who have helped make this book a r eality.
The Muses of Science: I am indebted to the spirits of science, for I am fully aware that forces outside of myself have guide d me in bringing this messa ge to the world. Special blessings to my heroes, JeanBaptiste de Monet de Lamar ck and Albert Einstein, for their worldchanging spiritual and scientific contributions.
The Muses of Literature: The intention to write a book on the new biology was spaw ned in 1985, though it was not until Patri cia A. King came into my life in 2003 that this book could come into reality. Patricia is a Bay Area freelance writ er and former Newsweek rep orter who worked for a decad e as the magazine's San Francisco Bureau Chief. I will never forget our first meetin g wherein I overw helmed her with a lengthy new science tutorial an d then burdened her with a truckload of aborted manuscripts, sheaves of innumerable articles I had written, boxes overflowing with video-taped lectures and stacks of scientific reprints.
Only as she was driv ing away, did I realize the monumental nature of the task I was asking of her. Withou t formal training in cell biology an d p hysics, Patricia accomplished miracles in downloading and understanding the new science. In a very short time, she not only learned the new biology, she was even able to expand on its topics. Her amazing skills at integratin g, editing and synth esizing information are responsible for the clarity of this book .
Patricia works on book projects, newspap er and ma gazine stories that focus on health issues, especially mind-body medi cine and the role stress plays in disease. Her work has appeared in publications such as the Los A ngeles Times, Southwest Airline's Spirit mag azine and
9



Common Ground magazine. A native of Boston, King lives in Marin
with her husband, Harold and their daughter, Ann a. r am in deep appreciation and gratitude to Patricia for her efforts an d look forw ard to the opportunity of wri ting another book with her in the future .
771£ Muses of the Arts: In 1980 I left acade mia and went "on the road" presenting a touring light show called 711£ Laser Symphony. The heart and brains of our spectacular laser production was Robert Mueller, a visionary artist an d computer graphics genius. Wise
beyond his teena ge years, Bob dr ank in the new science r was working on, first as a student and later as my "spiritual son." Years ago he offered, an d I accepted, his bid to create a cover for the book whenever it would appear.
Bob Mueller is cofounder and creative director of LightSpeed Design, Bellevu e, Washington. He and his company have produced award winning 3-D light and soun d shows for science museums an d planetariums around the world. Their edutainment show on the fragile ecology of our oceans was an honored presentation, seen by 16,000 viewers daily at the World's Expo held in Lisbon, Portu gal (1998). Bob's creative endeavors can be sampled at www.lightspeeddesign.com.
Bob' s work, inspired by science an d the Light, is beautiful an d pro
found . r am honored to hav e his contribution as the cover art, the image that will introd uce this n ew awa reness to the public.
Muses ofMusic:From the conception of this n ew science to the submission of the book, r have been contin uously encouraged an d energized by the music of Yes and especially the lyrics of their vocalist Jon Anderson. Their music and message reveal an inner knowing and understanding of the new science. The music of Yes speaks to the fact tha t we are all connec ted to the Light. Their songs emphasize how our experiences, our beliefs and our dreams shape our lives and influence those of our children. What takes me pages of text to explain, Yes can say in a few p owerful an d poignant lines. You guys are great!
Regarding the physical production of this book, r sincerely want to thank the New York publishers who turned down the book prop osal.
Without you , r was able to create my own book - just like I wan ted to

do. I am ind ebted to Mountain of Love Prod uctions, Inc. for investin g time an d resources into publishin g this book. Toward that end , especial apprecia tion goes out to Dawson Church of Author's Publishing Cooperative. Dawson enabled us to have the best of both worlds, the personal management afford ed by self-publishin g and the marketing experience of a m ajor publishin g hou se. Thanks to Gera lyn Gendreau for her support of this work and bringing it to the attention of Daw son Church. Dear friend and public relations speciallst Shelly Keller has given generously of her time in providing pro fessional edi ting skills.
Thanks to all of the stu de nts and attendees of my classes, lectures, and sem inars who over th e years persistentl y enquir ed, "Wh ere's th e book? ??" OK, OK, here it is! Your continue d encourageme nt is deep ly appreciated .
I wo uld like to honor some very im port ant teachers who have p rovided guidance in my scientific career. First and foremost, my father , Eli, who instilled in me a sense of purpose, and as importantl y, encouraged me to " think ou tside of the box." Thanks, Dad .
David Ban glesd orf, the elementary schoo l science teacher who introduced m e to the world of cells and igni ted my passion for science . The bri llian t Irwin R. Koni gsberg, P h.D., who took me under his wing an d mentored my doctoral ed ucation. I shall forever remember our eureka moments and the passion for science we share d .
I am indebted to Professo r Theod ore Hollis, Ph D . (penn State University) and Klau s Bensch, M.D., Chairman of Path ology (Stanfo rd University], the first "real" scientists who understood my heretical ideas. Each of these distinguished researchers encouraged and supported my efforts by providing me with space in their labo ratories to investigate the ideas present ed in this book.
In 1995 Gerard Clu m, D.C., Pr esident, Life College of Chiropractic West, invited me to teach Fractal Biology, my very own course on the new science. I am in gra titude for Gerry's sup port, fo r he introd uced me to the life-enhanc ing wo rlds of chiropractic and complementary med icine.

At the first public presentation of this material in 1985 I met Lee Pulos, Ph .D., Assistant Professor Emeritus, Department of Psycholo gy at the University of British Columbia. Over the years, Lee has been a great supporter of, and contributor to, the new biology presented in this book. My partner and esteemed colleague Rob Williams, M.A., developer of Psych-K, contributed to this project by helping bridge the science of cells with the mechanics of human psychology.
Discussions of science and its role in civilization with Cur t Rexroth, D.C., a dear friend and wizard of philosophy, have brou ght great aw areness and joy to my life. Collaboration with Theodore Hall, Ph.D. offered wonde rful and profound insights correlating the histories of cellular evolution and human civilization.
I sincerely want to thank Gregg Braden for his wonderful scientilic insights, his sugges tions regarding publishing, and for pro viding the intriguing subtitle of this book.
Each of the following, dear and trusted friends, read and critiqued this work. Their contributions were vital in bringing this book to you. I personally wan t to thank each of them: Terry Bugno, M.D., David Chamberlain, Ph.D., Barbara Findeisen, M.F.T., Shelly Keller, Mary Kovacs, Alan Mande, Nancy Marie, Michael Mendizza, Ted Morrison, Robert and Susan Mueller, Lee Pulo s, Ph.D., Curt Rexroth, D.C., Christine Rogers, Will Smith, Diana Sutter, Thomas Verney, M.D., Rob and Lanita Williams, and Donna Wonder.
I am gra teful for the love and support offered by my sister Marsha and broth er David. I am particularly proud of David for wha t he jokingly refers to as "breaking the circle of violence" and becoming a great dad to his son Alex.
Much appreciation goes out to Doug Parks of Spirit 2000, Inc. for his outstanding support of this project. Upon hearin g the new biology, Dou g fully dedicated his efforts to getting this message out to the world. Dou g has prod uced video -lectures and wor kshops that have broadened public aw areness of this ma terial and have opened the doors to man y seeking self-empowerment. Thank you, dear brother.

PROLOG U E
" If you could be anybody . .. who would you be?" I used to spend an inordinate amount of time pondering that question. I was obsessed with the fantasy that I could change my identity because I wanted to be anybody bu t me. I had a good career as a cell biologist and med ical school professor, but that didn't make up for the fact that my personal life was at best, a shamb les. The harder 1 tried to find happiness and satisfaction in my personal life, the more dissatisfied and unhappy I became . In my more reflective momen ts, I resolved to surrender to my unhappy life. I decided that fate had dealt me a bad hand and I should simply mak e the best of it. A victim of life. Que sera, sera.
My depressed, fatalistic attitude changed in one tran sformational moment in the fall of 1985. I had resigned my tenured position at the Univers ity of Wisconsin' s School of Medicine an d was teaching at an offshore med ical school in the Caribbean. Because the school was so far out of the academic mainstream, I started thinking outside the rigid parame ters of belief that prevail in conventio nal academia . Far from those ivory towers, isolated on an emera ld island in the deep azure Caribbean Sea, 1 experienced a scientific epiphan y that sha ttered my beliefs about the nature of life.
My life-chan gin g moment occurred while I was reviewing research on the mechani sms by which cells control their ph ysiology and behavior. Suddenly I realized that a cell's life is controlled by the physical and energetic env ironm ent and not by its genes. Genes are simp ly molecular bluep rints used in the construction of cells, tissues and organs. The env ironment serves as a "contractor" wh o reads and engages those genetic blueprint s and is ultim ately responsible for the character of a cell's life. It is a single cell's "awareness" of the environmen t, not its genes, that sets into motion the mechani sms of life.
As a cell biologist I knew that my in sights had powerful ramifications for my life and the lives of all human beings . I was acutely aware tha t every human being is mad e up of approximately fifty trillion sin
15



gle cells. 1 had de voted my professional life to better understanding single cells because I knew then, and know now, that the better we understand single cells the better we can understand the comm unity of cells that comprise each hwnan body . I kn ew that if single cells are controlled by their awareness of the environment so too are we trillion-celled human beings. Just like a single celt, the character of our lives is determined not by our genes but by our responses to the environm ental signals that propel life.
On the one hand m y new understanding of the nature of life was a jolt. For close to two decades I had been programming biology's Central Dogma - the belief that life is controlled by genes - into the minds of mecticaI stud ents. On the other hand, on an intuitive level my new understanding was not a comp lete surprise. I had always had niggling dou bts about genetic determinism. Some of those doubts stemm ed from m y eighteen years of government-funded research on cloned stem cells. Though it took a sojourn outside of trad itional academia for me to ful ly realize it, my research offers incontrovertible proof that biology's most cherished tenets regardin g genetic determinism are fundamentall y flawed.
My new understan ding of the nature of life not only corroborated my research, but also, I realized, contradicted another belief of mainstream science that I had been propouncting to my students - the belief that allopathic med icine is the only kind of med icine that merits considera tion in medical scho ol. By finally giving the energy-based environment its due, it pro vided the founda tion for the science and philosophy of complementary medicine and the spiritual wisdo m of ancient and modem faiths as we ll as for allopathi c medicine.
On a persona l level, I knew at the moment of insight that I had gotten myself stuck because I falsely believed that I was fated to have a spectacularly unsuccessful per sonal life. There is no doubt that hwnan beings have a great capacity for sticking to false beliefs with great passion and tenacity and hyper-rati onal scien tists are not immune. Our well-developed nervous systems headed by our big brains means that our aw areness is more complicated than single cells. When our
16



uniquely human minds get involved we can choose to perceive the environment in different ways, unlike single cells whose awareness is more reflexive.
I was exhilarated by new realization that I could change the character of my life by cha nging my beliefs. I was instantly ener gized because I realized that there was a science-based path that would take me from my job as a perennial "victim" to my new job as "co-creator" of my destiny.
It has been twenty years since that magical night in the Caribb ean whe n I had my life-changing mo ment of insight. In those years, biological research has continued to corro borate the knowle dge I gained on that early morning in the Caribbean . We are living in exciting times, for science 15 in the process of sh attering old myths and rewriting a fundamental beliefof human civilization. The beliefthat we are frail biochemical machines controlled by genes is giving way to an un derstanding that we are pow erful creators of.our lives and the world in which we.live.
For two decad es I ha ve been passing on this paradigm-busting scientific inform ation to hundreds of au d iences throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The response by peo ple who have, like me, mad e use of this know ledge in rewriting the scripts of their lives has brought great joy and satisfaction into my life. As we all know, knowled ge is power and conseque ntly, knowledge of self pro vides self-empowerment.
Now I offer this empowering information to you in The Biology of Belief It is my sinceres t hope that you w ill recogniz e that man y of the beliefs that propel your life are false and self-limiting and that you will be inspired to change those beliefs. You can take back control of your life and set out on the road to health and happiness.
This inform ation is powerful . 1 know it is. The life I have crea ted using this information is so much richer and satisfying, I no longer ask myself: " If I could be anybody, who would I be?" For now, the answer is a no-brainer. I wan t to be me!

I N TROD UC T ION
T he Mag ic of Cel ls
r was seven years old when r stepped up onto a small box in Mrs. Novak's second grade classroom, high enough to plop my eye right onto the lens an d eyepiec e of a microscope. Alas, I was too close to see anything but a blob of light. Finally I calmed do wn enough to Listen to instructions to back off from the eyepiece. And then it happened, an event so dramati c that it would set the course for the rest of my life. A paramecium sw am into the field. I was mesmerized. The rau cous din of the other kids faded, as did the back-to-school smells of freshly sha rpened pencils, new wa xy crayo ns and plastic Roy Rogers pen cil cases. My whole being was tran sfixed by the alien wo rld of this cell that for me was more exciting than toda y's computer-anim ated special effects movies.
In the innocence of my child mind, r saw this organism not as a cell, but as a microscopic person, a thinking, sentient being. Rather than aim lessly moving around, this microscopic, singie-celled organ
ism appeared to me to be on a mission, thou gh what kind of mission r didn't know . I quie.tly watch ed over the paramecium's "shoulder" as it busily comported itself in and around the algal mat. While I was focusing on the paramecium , a large pseudo pod of a gangly amoeba began to ooze into the field .
Just then my visit to this Lilliputian world ended abruptly wh en Glenn, the class bully, yanked me off the step and demanded his turn at the microscope. I tried to get Mrs. Novak's attention, hop ing that Glenn's persona] foul wo uld get me another minute at the microscope free-thr ow line. But it was just minu tes before lunch time and the other kids in line were clamoring for their turn. Imm ediately after school, I ran home and excited ly relayed my microscop ic ad venture to my mother. Using my best second-grade powers of persuasion, ] asked, then begged, then cajoled my mother into getting me a microscope , where] would spend hours mesmerized by this alien world that [ could access via the miracle of optics.

Later, in grad ua te schoo l, I advanced to an electron microscope. The ad van tage of an electron microscope over a conventional light microscope is that it is a thousand times more powerful. The difference between the two microscopes is analogous to the difference betw een the 25¢ observa tion telescopes used by touri sts to observe scenic vistas an d the orbiting Hubble telescope that transmits ima ges of deep space. Entering the electron microscopy suite of a labora tory is a rite of passage for aspiring biologists. You enter thr ough a black revolving door, similar to the ones separating photographic darkrooms from illuminated work areas.
Tre member the first time I stepped into the revolving door and began to tum it. Twas in darkness between two world s, my life as a student and my future life as a research scientist. When the door completed its rotation, Twas deposited into a large, dark chamber, diml y lit by several red photographic safelights. As my eyes adapted to the available light I grad ually became awed by wha t stood before me. The red lights were reflecting eerily off the mirrored surface of a massive, foot-thick chromium steel column of electrom agnetic lenses that rose to the ceiling in the cen ter of the room . Sp read ing out on either side at the base of the column was a large control console. The console resem bled the instrument panels of a Boeing 747, filled with switches, illuminated gauges and multicolored indicator lamps. Large tentacle-like arra ys of thick power cords, water hoses and vacu um lines radiated from the base of the microscope like tap roots at the base of an old oak tree. The sound of clanking vacuum pumps and the whir of refrigerated water recirculat ors filled the air. For all I knew, I had just emerged on to the comm an d deck of the U, S,S. Enterprise. Apparently, it was Captain Kirk's day off, for sitting at the console was one of my professors, who was engaged in the elabora te procedure of introducing a tissue specime n into a high-vacuum chamber in the middle of the steel column,
While the minutes passe d, I experienced a feeling reminisc ent of that day in second grad e when I first saw a cell. Finally, a green fluorescent image ap peared on the pho sphor screen. The presence of darkly stained cells could barely be discerned in the plastic sections, which
20



were enlarg ed to abou t thirty times their original size. Then the mag nification was increased , one step at a time. First lOOX, then 1000X, an d then lO,OOOX. When we finally hit warp dr ive, the cells were magnified to over 100,000 times their original size. It was ind eed Star Trek, but rather than entering outer space we were going deep into inn er space where "no man has gone before." One momen t I was observ ing a miniature cell and seconds later I was flying deep into its molecular architectu re.
My awe at being at the edge of this scientific frontier was palpable. So was my excitement when I was made honorary co-pilot. 1 put my hand s on the controls so that I could "fly" over this alien cellular landscape. My pro fessor was my tour gui de, pointing ou t notable landmarks: "Here's a mitochondrion, there's the Golgi body, over there is a nuclear pore, this is a collagen molecule, that's a ribosome."
Most of th e ru sh I expe rienced came from my vision of myself as a pioneer, traversing territory that had never been seen by human eyes . While the light microscope gave me an awareness of cells as sentient creatures, it wa s the electron microscope tha t brought me face to face with the molecules that were the very foun dation of life itself. I knew that buried within the cytoarchitectureof the cell were clues that would provid e insight into the mysteries of life.
For a brief moment, the microscope's po rtholes became a crystal ball; in the eerie green glow of its fluorescent screen I saw my future. I knew I was going to be a cellular biologist whose research wo uld focus on scru tinizing every nu ance of the cell's ultrastructure to gain insights into the secrets of cellular life. As I had learned early on in gra dua te schoo l, the structure and function of biological organisms are intimately intertwined . By correlating the cell's microscopic ana tomy with its beha vior, I was sure to gain insight into the nature of Nature. Thr ougho ut grad uate school, postd octoral research and into my career as a medical school professor, my wakin g hours were consumed by explorations into the cell's molecular an atomy. For locked within the cell' s stru cture were the secrets of its fun ctions .
My exploration of the "secrets of life" led me into a research career study ing the cha racter of cloned hu man cells grown in tissue culture.

Ten yea rs after my first close encounter with an EM, I was a tenured faculty mem ber at the prestigio us Unive rsity of Wiscon sin School of Med icine, internationally recogni zed for myresearch on cloned stem cells and honored for m y teaching skills. I had grad uated to more powerfu l electron microscop es that allowed me to take three-d imensiona l CAT scan-like rid es thr ough organisms wh ere 1 came face to face with the molecules tha t are the very foundatio n of life itself. Though my tools we re more sophisticated, my approach hadn't changed. I had never lost my seve n-year-old conviction that the lives of the cells I stu died had p urp ose.
Unfortunately, [ had no such conv iction that my own life had a purpose. I didn't believe in God, thou gh I confess that on occasion I en ter tained the notion of a God who ruled w ith an extrem ely honed sense of perverse humor. I was after all a traditi onal biologist for who m God's existence is an unnecessary qu est ion : life is the consequ ence of blind chance, the flip of a frien dly card or, to be more precise, the random sha ke of genetic d ice. The motto of our profession since the time of Charles Darwin, has been, "God ? We don 't need no steenkin g God!"
It's not that Dar w in d enied the existence of God . He simp ly implied that chance, not Divine interven tion, was respo ns ible for the characte r of life on Earth. In his 1859 book, The Origin of Species, Darw in said that ind ivid ual traits are passed from parents to their childr en. He suggested that "hereditary factors" passed from paren t to child control the characteristics of an ind ivid ual's life. That bit of insight set scientists off on a frenz ied attemp t to dissect life down to its molecular nuts a nd bolts, for w ithin the structure of the cell was to be found the heredity mechanism that controlled life.
The sea rch came to a remarkable end 50 years ago wh en James Watson and F rancis Crick de scribe d the struc ture and fun ction of the DN A d ou ble helix, the material of whim genes are made. Scien tists finally figured out the nature of the "hered itary factors" that Darw in had wri tten about in the 19th century. The tabloids heralded the brave new wo rld of genetic enginee.ring wi th its pro mise of designer babies an d magic bullet med ical treatmen ts. I vivid ly remember the la.rge
22



block prin t headlines tha t filled the front page on that memorable day in 1953: "Secret of Life Discovered".
Like the tabloids, biologists jump ed on the gene bandwagon . The mechanism by which DNA controls biological life became the Central Dogma of molecular biology, painstakingly spelled out in textbooks. In the long-running deba te over nature v. nurture, th e pend ulum sw ung decidedl y to nature. At first DNA was thought to be responsible only for our physical charac teristics, but then we started believing that our genes control our emo tions and beha viors as well. So if you are born with a defective happiness gene, you can expect to have an unhappy life.
Unfortu nately, I tho ught I was one of those people victimized by a missing or mutant happiness gene. I wa s reeling from a relentless barrage of debilitating emotional roundho use pun ches. My father had just died after a long, pain-fraught battle with cancer. I was his princi pal caretaker an d had spent the previous four months flying back and forth between my job in Wiscons in and his home in New York every tluee or four days. In between stays at his deathbed, I wa s trying to maintain a research program, teach, and write a major grant renewal for the National Insti tutes of Health .
To further compound my stress levels, I was in the midst of an emotionally draining and economically de vastating divorce. My financial resources were rapidly dep leted as I tried to feed an d clothe my new dependents, the judicial system. Economically challenged and homeless, I found myself livin g pretty much out of a suitcase in a most abysmal" gar den" apartme nt complex. Most of my neighbors Were hopin g to " upgrade" their livin g standard s by seeking accommodations in trailer parks. I was particularly scared of my next-door neighbors. My apartment was brok en into and my new stereo system was stolen in my first week of residence. A week later, six-foot tall, tlueefoot wide Bubba knocked on my door. Ho lding a qu art of beer in one hand and picking his teeth with a ten-penn y nail held in the other, Bubba wa nted to know if I had the directions for the tape deck.
The nadir was the day I threw the ph one tluough the glass door of my office, shattering the "Bruce H . Lip ton, Ph.D. Associate Professor
23



of Anatomy, V. W . School of Med icine" sign, all the while screaming "Get me out of here!" My meltdown was precipitated by a phone call from a banker, who politely but firmly told me he couldn't approve my mortgage application. It was like the scene from "Terms of Endearment" when Debra Wing er aptl y responds to her husband's hopes for tenure : "We don' t hav e enough money to pa y the bills now . All tenure means is we won 't ha ve eno ugh money forever!"
The Magic of Cells- Deja Vu
Luckily, I found an escape in the form of a shor t-term sabbatical at a medical schoo l in the Caribbean. I knew all my problems would not disappear there, but as the jet broke thro ugh the gra y cloud cover above Chicago , it felt that wa y. I bit the inside of my cheek to prevent the smile on my face from evolving into auclible laughter. I felt as joyful as my seven-year-old self, first discovering my life's passion, the magic of cells.
My mood lifted even more on the six-passenger comm uter plane that took me to Montserrat, a mere four by twelve mi le dot in the Caribbean Sea. lf there ever wa s a Garden of Eden, it probably wo uld have resembl ed my new island home, eru pting out of the sparkling aqu amarin e sea like a giant multifaceted emerald. When we land ed, the gardenia-laced balmy breezes that swept the airport's tarmac were intoxicating .
The native custom was to dedic ate the su nset period as a time of quiet contemplation, a custom I readil y adop ted. As each da y wound down, I looked forward to the heavenly light show . My house, situated on a cliff fifty feet abov e the ocean, faced due west. A winding path through a tree-covered fern grotto led me down to the water. At the bottom of the grotto, an opening through a wall of jasmin e bushes revealed a secluded beach, where I enhanced the sunse t ritual by washing away the da y with a few "laps" in the warm, gin-clear water. After my swim, I would mold the beach sand into a comfortable recline r, sit back, and wa tch the sun set slowly into the sea.
On that remote island I was out of the rat race and free to see the world without the blinders of civilization's dogmatic beliefs. At first

my mind was cons tan tly reviewing an d critiquing th e. de ba cle tha t was my life. But soon my mental Siskel and Ebert ceased th eir thumbs up / th umbs d own review of m y forty yea rs. I began to re-exp erience what it was like to live in th e momen t and for th e mo men t. To became rea cquainted with sensations last experience d as a carefree child . To again feel the p leasur e of being alive.
I beca me. more human and m ore h uman e. w hile living in tha t islan d paradise. I also became a be tter cell biologist. Almost all of my formal scientific training was in sterile, lifeless classrooms, lecture halls and lab orat ories. H ow ever, once I was immersed in the Caribbean's rich ecosystem, I began to appreciate biology as a living, breathing integrated system rath er than a collectio n of indivi dual species sharing a piece of th e earth's tu rf.
Sitting quie tly within garden-like island jungles an d snorkeling among the jeweled coral reefs gave me a win dow int o th e islan d's amazing integra tion of p lan t and animal sp ecies. All live in a de licate, dyna mic balance, not only with other life forms, but with the p hysical en vironmen t as well. It was life's har.mon y-not life's struggle - tha t sang ou t to m e as I sa t in the Caribbean Garden of Eden. I became convinced th at con te.mporary biology pays too little attention to the im portant role of cooperation, because its Darwinian roots emphasize life's competitive nature.
To the chagrin of my u.s. faculty colleagues, I re tu rne d to Wisconsin a screaming rad ical bent on cha llenging th e sacred foundational beliefs of b iology . I eve n began to openly criticize Charles Darwin and the wisdom of his theory of evolution. In the eyes of most other biologis ts, my beh avior was tantam ount to a priest burstin g int o the Vatican and claiming the Pop e wa s a fra ud.
My colleagues cou ld be forgi ven for thinking a coconut had hi t me on the head when I quit my tenured position and, fulf illing m y life's d ream to be in a rock ' n' ro ll band, took off on a music tour. I discovered Yanni, w ho eventually became a big celebrity, and produced a laser show with him . But it soon became clear that I had a lot more ap titu de for teaching and research than I did for producing rock ' n' ro ll shows. I wound down m y m id life crisis, which I'll de scribe in
25



more agoniz ing detail in a later chapter, by giving up the music bu siness and returning to the Caribbean to teach cell biology again .
My fina l stop in conventiona l aca demia was at Stanfo rd University's School of Medicine. By that time I was an unabashed proponent of a " new" biology . I had come to question not only Darwin's dog-eat-dog version of evolution, but also biology' s Central Dogm a, the premise that genes control life. That scientific pr emise has one major flaw - genes cannot tum themselves on or off. In more scientific terms, genes are not "self-emerge nt." Something in the environment has to trigger gene activity. Thou gh that fact had alread y been established by fronti er science, conve ntiona l scientists blinded by genetic dogma had simply ignored it. My outspoken challenge of the Central Dogma turned me into even more of a scientific heretic. Not only was I a can dida te for excommunication, I was now sui table for burning at the stake!
In a lecture during my interview at Stanford, I foun d myself accusing the gathered faculty, many of them internationally recognized geneticists, of being no better than religious fundamentalists for adhering to the Central Dogma de spite evide nce to the contrary . After my sacrilegious comme nts, the lecture room erupted into shouts of outrage that I thou ght meant the end of my job application . Instead, my insights concerning the mechanics of a new biology proved to be p rovocative enough to get me hired . With the suppo rt of some eminent' scie ntis ts at Stanford, especia lly fro m the Patholo gy Department's chairman, Dr. Klau s Bensch, I was encouraged to pursue my ideas and apply them to research on cloned human cells. To the sur prise of those around me, the experiments fully supported the alternative view of biology that I was postulating. I pu blish ed two pa pers based on this research and left academia, this time for good. [Lipton, et al, 1991, 1992]
l left becau se, despite the support I got at Stanford, I felt that my message was falling on deaf ears . Since my departure, new research has consistently valida ted my skepticism about the Central Dogma and the primacy of DNA in controlling life. In fa ct, epigeneiics, the stu dy of the molecular mechanisms by which environment controls
26



gene acti vity, is today one of the mo st active areas of scientific research. The n ewly emphasized role of th e env ironmen t in regu lating gene activ ity was th e focus of my cell resear ch twen ty-five years ago, lon g before the field of epigene tics was even esta blishe d . [Lipton 1977a, 1977b] Whil e that is gra tifying for m e int ellectually, I know tha t if I were teaching and researching in a m edical school, my colleagues wo uld still be wondering abou t th ose coco nu ts, becau se in the last deca de I ha ve become even m ore of a radi cal by aca de mia 's stan dards. My preoccupati on with a new biology has become more tha n an int ellectua l exerc ise. I believe that cells teach us not only abou t th e mechanisms of life, bu t also teach us how to live rich, full lives.
In ivory tower science that kin d of th.inkin g wo uld no d ou bt win me th e wacky Dr. Dolittle award for anthr opomorp hism or m ore pr ecisely cytopomorph.ism- thinkin g like a cell, bu t for me it is Biology 101. You m ay consider yourself an in dividual, but as a cell biologist [ can tell you th at you are in truth a coopera tive community of appro ximately 50 trilli.on single-celled citiz ens. Almost all of th e cells that mak e up your body are am oeba-like, in di vidual organisms that have evolved a cooperative stra tegy for their m utual surv ival. Reduced to bask terms, h u m an beings are simply the conseque nce of "collective amoeb ic consc iousness." As a nation reflects the traits of its citizens, our human -ness must reflect the basic nature of our cellu lar communities ,
Living the Lessons of Ce lls
Using th ese cell communi ties as role m odels, I cam e to the concl usion tha t we are not victims of ou r genes, bu t masters of our fates, able to crea te lives overflowing w ith peace, happiness an d love. I tested m y .hyp othes is in m y own life after a nu d ge fro m my audiences, w ho asked me w hy m y insight s hadn 't made m e an y h appier. They were righ t: I need ed to integrate my new biological awarene ss into my dail y life. I knew I had succee ded when, on a bright Sun day mornin g in the Big Easy, a coffee shop waitress asked me: "Ho ney, yo u are the ha pp iest p erson I ever d id see. Tell m e ch.iId, why ar e yo u so happy?" I was taken abac k by her question, but nevertheless I blurted out: " I'm in Heaven!" The waitress shook her he ad fro m side to side m umbling
27



"My, my" and then proceeded to take my breakfast order. Well, it wa s true. I was happy, happ ier than I had ever been in my life.
A number of yo u critical readers may righ tly be skep tical of my claim tha t Earth is Heaven. For by definition Heaven is also the abode of the Deity and the blessed de ad . Did I really think that New Orleans, or any oth er major city, could be part of Heaven? Ragged homeless women and child ren living in alleys; air so thick that one would never know if stars really existed; river and lakes so polluted that only unimaginable "scary" life forms could exist in them. This Earth is Heaven? The Deity lives here? He krunos the Deity?
The answ ers to those questio ns are : Yes, yes, and I believe I do.
Well, to be completely honest, r mu st admit that I don 't know all of the Deity personally, for I don't know all of you . For God's sake there are ove r six billion of you. And to be more fully honest, I don't really know all of the members of the plant and animal kingd om either, though I believe they also comprise God.
In the immortal words of Tool Time's Tim Taylor, "Baaaaack the truck up! Is he saying that humans are God?"
Well. ..yes I am. Of cours e I am not the first to have said that. It is written in Genesis that we are mad e in the image of God. Yes, this card -carrying rationalist is now quoting Jesus, Buddha an d Rumi. I have come full circle from a reductionist, scientific take on life to a sp iritual one. We are made in the image of God and we need to put Spirit back into the equa tion when we want to improve our physical and our men tal health.
Becau se we are not powerless biochemical mach ines, popping a pill every time we are mentally or physically out of tune is not the answer. Dru gs and sur gery are powerful tools, whe n they are not overused, but the notion of simple drug fixes is fund amentally flawed . Every time a dru g is introd uced into the body to correct function A, it inevitably throws off function B, C or D. It is not gene-directed hormones an d neurotransmitters that control our bodi es an d our minds; our beliefs control our bodies, our minds and thus our lives...Oh ye of little belief!

The Light Outside of the Box
In this book I will draw the p roverbial line in the sand. On one sid e of the line is a world defined by neo-Darwinism, which casts life as an unend ing w ar among batt ling, biochemical robo ts. On the other side of the line is the "New Biology," which casts life as a coopera tive journ ey 'amon g pow erful.individuals who can program themselves to create joy-filled lives. When we cross tha t line and trul y understand the New Biology, we will no longer fractiously debate the role of nurture and nature, beca use we will realize thaI the fully conscious mind trumps both nature and nurture. And I believe we will also experience as profound a parad igmatic change to humanity as wh en a ro undworld reality was introduced to a flat-world civilization.
Humanities' majors, who may be wo rried that this book offers an incomprehensible science lecture, have no fear. When I was an acadernic, I chafed at the three-piece, itchy sui t, the cons tricting tie, the wing tip shoes, and the interminable meetings, but I loved to teach. And in my pos t-academia life, I've gotten p lenty of teaching p ract ice; I have presen ted the principl es of the New Biology to thousands of people al1 aro und the wo rld. Through those lectures, 1 have hon ed my presentation of the science into eas y-to-understand English illu strated by colorfu l charts, many of which are replicated in this book.
In Cha pter 1, I discuss "sma rt" cel1s and why and how they can teach us so much abou t our own minds and bodi es. In Cha p ter 2, I lay out the scien tific evidence to show you genes do not con trol biology. I also introduce yo u to the exciting discoveries of epigenetics, a new field of biology that is uru aveling the mysteries of ho w the env ironmen t (nature) influences the behavior of cel1s w ithout changing the gene tic code . It is a field that is uncoverin g ne w com plexities in the na ture of disease, including cancel' and schizophrenia.
Chapter 3 is abou t the cell's memb ran e, the "skin" of the cell. You no doubt have,heard more abou t the DNA-containin g nu cleus of the cell than you have abouf its membrane. But frontier science is revealing in ever greater detail wh at I conclud ed ove r twe nty years ago, that the membrane is the true brain of the cel1ular ope ra tion. In Chapter 4,
29



I talk about the min d-bending discoveries of quantum physics. Those discoveries ha ve profound implications for understand ing and treating disease. However, the conventi onal medical establishment has not yet incorporated qua ntum ph ysics into its research or medi cal schoo l trainin g, with tragic results.
In Chapter 5, I explain why I named this book The Biology of Belief Positive thoughts have a pro found effect on behavior an d genes, but only when they are in harmony with subconscious programming. And negative thoughts have an equally pow erful effect. When we recognize how these positive and negative beliefs control our biology, we can use this knowled ge to create Jives filled with health and happiness. Chapter 6 reveals why cells and people need to grow and how fear shuts down that grow th.
Chapter 7 focuses upon conscious parenting. As parents we need to understand the role we play in programming our childre n's beliefs, an d the impact those beliefs have on our children's lives. This chapter is imp ortant whether you are a parent or not, for as a "former" child, the insight into our programming and its impact upon our lives is quite revealing. In, the Epilogue, I review how my understanding of the New Biology led m e to realize the imp ortance of in tegrating the realm s of Spirit and Science, which was a radical shift from my backgro und as an agnostic scientist.
Are you read y to use your conscious mind to create a life overflowing with health, happiness and love without the aid of genetic engin eers and without addicting yourself to dru gs? Are you read y to consider an alternate reality to that pro vided by the medical m odel of the human bod y as a biochemical machine? There is nothing to buy an d there are no policies to take out. It is just a matter of temporarily suspending the arch aic beliefs you have acquired from the scientific and media establishments so that you can consider the exciting new awa reness offered by leading-ed ge science.

LES SONS FROM THE PETRI DISH : IN PRAISE OF SMART CELLS AND SMART STUDENTS
Trouble in Paradise
O
n my second day in the Caribbean, as I stood in fron t of over a hundred visibly on-edge medical students, I sud denly realized that not everyone view ed the island as a laid-back refuge. For these nervou s stude nts, Montserrat was not a peaceful escape but a last-ditch chance to realize their dreams of becoming doc tors.
My class was geographically homogeneous, mos tly Ame rican students from the East Coast, but there were all races and ages, including a sixty-seven-year-old retiree who was anxious to do more with his life. Their backgroun ds were equally varied - forme r elementary schoo l teachers, accoun tan ts, musicians , a nun and even a drug smuggler.
Despite all the differences, the students shared tw o charac teristics. One, they had failed to succeed in the highly compe titive selection process tha t filled the limited n umber of positions in Am erican m ed ical schoo ls. Tw o, they w ere" strivers" intent on becoming d octors

they were not abou t to be denied the opportunity to prove their qualifications. Most had spent their life savings or indentured themselves to cover the tuition and extra costs of living out of the coun try. Man y found themselves comp letely alone for the first time in their lives, having left their families, friends and loved ones behind. They p ut up with the m ost intolerable living conditi ons on th at cam pus. Yet with all the drawbacks and the odds stacked against them, they were never deterred from their ques t for a medical degree.
Well, at least that was tru e up to the time of our first class together. Prior to my arrival, the students had had three different histology I cell biology professors. The first lecturer left the students in the lurch when he responded to some personal issue by bolting from the island three weeks into the semester. In short order, the school foun d a suitable rep lacement who tried to pick u p the pieces; unfortunately he bailed three weeks later becau se he got sick. For the preceding two weeks a faculty member, responsible for an other field of stu dy, had been readin g cha pters out of a textbook to the class. This obviously bored the students to death, but the school was fulfilling a directive to pro vide a specified number of lecture hours for the course. Academic prerequisites set by American medical examiners hav e to be met in order for the school's gra dua tes to practice in the States .
For the fourth time that semester, the weary students listened to a new professor. I briefed them on my background and my expectations for the course . I made it clear that even though we were in a foreign country, [ was not going to expect any less from them than wha t was expected from my Wisconsin studen ts. Nor sho uld they want me to, becau se to be certified, all doctors have to pass the sam e Medical Boards, no matter where they go to medical school. Then I pulled a sheaf of exams out of my briefcase and told the students that I was giving them a self-assessment qui z. The middle of the semester had just passed and [ expected them to be farniliar with half of the required course material. The test I handed out on that first day of the course consisted of twenty questions taken dir ectly from the Unive rsity of Wisconsin histology midterm exam.

The classroom w as de adl y silent for the first ten minutes of the testing period. Then nervous fidgeting felled the stu dents one by one, faster than the sp read of the deadly Ebola virus. By the time the twenty minutes allotted for the quiz we re over, Wide-eyed panic had grip ped the class. When I said, "Stop," the pent-up ner vou s anxiety erupted into the din of a hundred excited conversations. I qu ieted the class down an d began to read them the answers. The firs t five or six answers were me t wi th subdued sighs . After I reached the tenth question, each subsequent answer was followed by agonizing gr oans. The high est score in the class was ten correc t answers, follow ed by several stu de nts w ho answered seven correctly; wi th guesswork, most of the rest scored at least one or two correc t answers.
When I looked up at the class, I was gree ted wi th frozen, shellshocked faces . The "strivers" found themselves behind the big eight ball. With more than half a semester behind them, they ha d to -star t the course all over aga in. A dar k gloom ove rcame the studen ts, mos t of whom were already treading wa ter in the ir other, very dem an ding medical schoo l courses. Within momen ts, their gloom had turn ed jnto quiet despair. In profound silence, I looked ou t over the studen ts and they looked back at me . I experienced an internal ache- the class collectively resembled one of those Greenpeace pictures of wide-eyed baby seals just before hear tless fur traders clu b the m to death .
My heart welled. Perhaps the salt air and sweet scen ts had alrea dy made me more magnanimou s. In any case, unexpected ly, I found myself announcing that I wo uld make it my personal commitment to see that every student was fully prepared for the final exam , if they would commit to providing ma tching efforts. When they realized I was trul y committed to their success, I could see the ligh ts flash on in their previously panicked eyes .
Feeling like an embatt led coach revv ing up the team for the Big Game, I told them I thought they were every bit as intelligent as the stu dents I taugh t in the States. I told them I believed their State-side peers we re simply more proficient at rote memorization, the quality that ena bled them to score better in th e med ical college admissions

tests. I also tried very hard to convince them that histology and cell biology are not intellectu ally difficult courses. I exp lained that in all of its elegance, nature employs very simple opera ting princ iples . Rather than just memorizin g facts and figures, I promised they were going to gain an understanding of cells becau se I would present simple principles on top of simple principles. I offered to provide additional night lectures, w hich wo uld tax their stamina after their already long lecture and lab-packed d ays. The students were pumped up after my tenminute pep talk . When the period ended, they bolted from tha t classroom snorting fire , de termined they wo uld no t be beaten by the sys tem.
After the studen ts left, the enormity of the commitme n t I ha d made sank in. I started havin g doubts. I knew that a significan t number of the stude n ts were trul y u nqualified to be attending me d ical school. Many others were capa ble studen ts w hose backgrounds had not p repared them for the challenge. I was afraid that my island id yll wo uld degenera te into a fre netic, time-consurning academic scrimmage that wo uld end in failure for my stude nts and for me as their teacher . I starte d thinking abou t my job at Wisconsin, and suddenly it was beginning to loo k easy. At Wisconsin, I gave only eigh t lectures
out of the approximately fifty that made up the histology I cell biology course. There were five me mbers of the Ana tomy Dep artmen t who shared the lecturing load . Of course I was res ponsible for the material in all of the lectures because I was involved in their accompanying laboratory sessions . I was supposed to be available to answer all courserelated questions asked by the students. But knowing the material and presenting lectures on the ma teria l are not the same thin g!
1 had a thr ee-day weekend to wrestle w ith the situation I had created for myself. Had I faced a crisis such as this back hom e, my type A pe rsonality wo uld have had me sw inging from the proverbial chandeliers. Interestin gly, as I sat by the pool, watching the sun set into the Caribbean, the po ten tial angst simply morphed into an exciting adventure.

Cells As M iniatu re Humans
CHAPTER O NE Lessons From the Petri Dish
course and free from having to conform to the styIe and content restr ictions of team-taught pro grams.
As it turned out, that histology course was the most exhilarating and intellectu ally profound period of my academic career. Free to teach the course the way I wanted to teach it, I ventured into a new wa y of covering the material, an approach tha t had been roiling in my brain for several years. r had been fascina ted by the idea that considering cells as "miniature humans " wo uld make it easier to understand their physiology and behavior. As I contemplated a new structure for the course, I got excited. The idea of overlapping cell and human biology rekindled the inspira tion for science I had felt as a child . I still experienced that enthusiasm in my research laboratory, though not when I wa s mired in the adminis trative details of being a tenured faculty member, includ ing endless meetings and what for me were tortuous facul ty parties.
I was prone to thinking of cells as human- like becau se, after years behind a microscope, I had become humbled by the complexity and power of w hat at first appear to be anatomically simp le, moving blobs in a Petri dish. In school you may have learn ed the basic com ponents of a cell: the nucleus that contains gene tic material, the energy -prod ucing mitochondria, the protective membrane at the outside rim, and the cytoplasm in between. But within these ana tomically simp le-looking cells is a complex world; these smart cells employ techn ologies that scientists have yet to fully fathom .
The notion of cells as miniature humans that I was mulling over would be considered heresy by most biologists. Try ing to explain the nature of anything not human by relatin g it to human behavior is called an thropomorphism. "True" scientists consider anthropomorp hism to be something of a mortal sin and ostracize scientists who knowingly emp loy it in their work.
However, I believed thou gh that I was breaking out of orthodoxy for a good reason. Biologists try to gain scientific understanding by



Th e Bi o l o g y o f B e l i e f
observing nature and conjuring up a hypothesis of how things work. Then they design experiments to test their ideas. By necessity, deriving the hypothesis and designing the experiments require the scientist to "think" how a cell or another living organism carries out its life. Applying these "human" solutions, i.e. a human view of resolving biology's mysteries , automatically makes the se scientis ts guilty of anthropomorphizing. No matter how you cut it, biological science is based to some degree on humanizing the subject matter.
Actually, I'believe that the unwritten ban on anthropomorphism is an outmoded remnant of the Dark Ages when religious authorities denied any direct relationship existed between humans and any of God's other creations. While I can see the value of the concept when people try to anthro pomorphize a light bulb, a radio or a pocketknife, I do not see it as a valid criticism when it is applied to living organisms. Human beings are multicellular organisms - we must inh erently share basic behavioral patterns with our own cells.
However, I know that it takes a shift in perc eption to acknowledge that parallel. Historically, our Judea-Christian beliefs have led us to think that we are the inlelligent creatures who were created in a separate and distinct pro cess from all other plants and animals. This view has us looking down our noses at lesser creatures as non-intelligent life forms, especially those organisms on the lower evolutionary rungs of life.
Nothing could be farther fr om the tru th. When we observ e other humans as individual entities or see ourselves in the mirror as an individual organism, in one sense, we are correct, at least from the perspective of our level of observation. However, if I brought you down to the size of an individual cell so you could see your bod y from that perspective, it would offer a whole new view of the world. When you looked back at your self from that perspective you would not see your self as a single entity. You would see yourself as a bustling community of more than 50 trillion individual cells.
As I toyed with these ideas for my Histo logy class, the picture that kept recur ring in my mind was a chart from an encyclopedia. I had

used as a child . Under the section on humans, there was an illustration with seven transparent plastic pages, each printed with an identical, overlapping outline of the human body . On the first page the outline was filled in with an image of a naked man. Turning the first page was like peeling off his skin and revealin g his musculature, the image within the outline on the second page. When I turned the second page, the overlapping images of the remaining pages revealed a vivid dissection of the bod y. Flipping through the pages 1 could see in tum, the skeleton, the brain and nerves, blood vessels and organ systems.
For my Caribbean course, I mentally updated those transparencies with seve ral additional, overlapping pages, each illustrated with cellular structu res. Most of the cell's structures are referred to as organelles, which are its "miniature organs " suspende d within a jeUylike cytoplasm. Organelles are the functional equivalen ts of the tissues and organs of our ow n bo dies . They include the nu cleus, which is the largest organe lle, the mitochondria, the Golgi bod y an d vacuoles. The traditional way of teachin g the course is to deal first with these cellular structures, then move on to the tissues and organs of the human body . Instead, I integrated the two parts of the course to reflect the overlapping nature of humans and cells.
I taught my students that the biochemical mechanisms employed by cellular orga nelle system s are essentially the same mechanisms employed by our human organ systems. Even thou gh humans are made up of trillions of cells, I stressed that there is not one "new" fun ction in our bodies that is not already expressed in the sing le cell. Each eukaryote (nucleus-containing cell) possesses the functio nal equivalent of our nervous system, digesti ve system, respiratory system, excretory sys tem, endocrine system, muscle and skeletal systems, circulatory system, integument (skin), reprod uctive sys tem and even a primitive immune system, which utilizes a famil y of antibody-like " ubiquitin" proteins.
I also mad e it clear to my stude nts that each cell is an intelligent being that can surv ive on its own, as scientists demonstrate when they remov e ind ividual cells from the body and grow them in a culture. As

I knew intuitively when I was a child, these smart cells are imbued with intent and purpose; they actively seek environments that support their survival while simultaneously avoiding toxic or hostile ones. Like humans, single cells analyze thousands of stimuli from the microenvironment they inhabit. Thro ugh the analysis of this da ta, cells select appropriate behavioral responses to ensure their survival.
Single cells are also capable of lear ning through these environmental experiences and are able to create cellular memories, which they pass on to their offspring. For example, when a measles virus infects a child, an immature immune cell is called in to create a protective protein antibody against that virus. In the process, the cell mu st cre ate a new gene to serve as a blueprint in manufacturing the meas les antibody protein .
The first step in genera ting a specific measles antibody gene occurs in the nu clei of immature immune cells. Am ong their genes are a very large number of DNA segments that encode uniquely sha ped snippets of proteins. By randomly assembling and recombining these DNA segments, immune cells create a vast array of different genes, each one pro viding for a uniqu ely shaped antibody pro tein. When an immature imm une cell produces an antibody protein that is a "close" ph ysical complement to the invading measles virus, that cell will be activated .
Activated cells employ an amazing mechanism called affinity maturation that enables the cell to perfectly "adjus t" the final shape of its antibody protein, so that it will become a perfect complement to the invading measles virus. [U, et al, 2003; Adams, et al, 2003] Using a pr ocess called somatic hypennutation, activated immune cells makes hundred s of copies of their original antibody gene. However, each new version of the gene is slightly mutated so that it will encode a slightly different shaped antibody protein . The cell selects the variant gene that makes the best fitting antib ody. This selected version of the gene also goes through repe ated rounds of somatic hypermutation to further sculpt the shape of the antibody to become a "perfect" physical complement of the meas les virus. [Wu, et al, 2003; Blanden and Steele 1998; Diaz and Casali 2002; Gearhart 2002]

The Orig ins of Life: Smart Cells Get Smarte r
When the sculptured an tibody locks on to the virus, it inactivates the invader and marks it for destr uction, th us protecting the child from the ravages of measles. The cells retain the genetic " memory" of this an tibody, so that in the future if the indiv id ual is again exposed to measles, the cells can immediately launch a protective immune response. The new antibod y gene can also be passed on to all the cell's pro geny when it divides. In this process, not only did the cell "learn " about the measles virus, it also crea ted a "memory" that will be inherited and propagated by its dau ghter cells. This amazin g feat of genetic engineering is profound ly important because it rep resents an inh erent "intelligence" mechanism by w hich cells evolve. [Steele, et al,

CHAPTER O NE
It shoul dn' t be surprising that cells are so smart. Single-celled organisms were the first life forms on this planet. Fossil evidence reveals they were here wi thin 600 million years after the Earth was first formed. For the next 2.75 billion year s of the Earth's history, only free-living, single-celled organisms - bacteria, algae an d amoeba-like protozoans, populated the wor ld.
Around 750 million years ago, these smart cells figu red out how to get smarter when the first multicellular organisms (plan ts and animals) appeared . Multicellular life forms were initially loose communities or "colonies" of single-celled organi sms . At firs t, cellular comm uni ties cons isted of tens and hundreds of cells. But the evolutionary adv antage of living in a communi ty soon led to organizations comprised of millions, billions and even trillions of socially interactive sing le cells. Though each individ ual cell is of microscopic dimensions, the size of multicellular communi ties may range from the bare ly visible to the monolithic. Biologists have classified these organized communities based on their struc ture as observed by the human eye. While the cellular communi ties appear as single entities to the naked eye - a mouse, a dog, a human - they are, in fact, highly organized associations of millions and trillions of cells.

T h e B i o l o g y of Be l ief
The evolutionary push for ever-bigger communities is simp ly a reflection of the biological imperative to survive. The more awareness an organis m has of its environm ent, the better its chances for survival. When cells ban d together they increase their awareness exponentially. If each cell were to be arbitrarily assign ed an awareness value of X, then each colonial organism would collectively have a potential awareness value of at least X times the number of cells in the colony.
In ord er to surv ive at such high densities, the cells created struc tured environments. These sophisticated communi ties subd ivided the workload with more p recision an d effectivene ss than the ever-changing organizational charts that are a fact of life in big corporations . It p roved more efficient for the community to have individu al cells assigned to specialized tasks . In the develop ment of animals and plants, cells begin to acquire th ese specialized functions in the embryo. A process of cytological specializa tion enables the cells to form the specific tissues and organs of the body . Over time, this pattern of differentiation, i.e. the distr ibution of the workload amo ng the mem bers of the community , became em bedded in the genes of every cell in the comm unity, Significantly increasing the orga nisms efficiency and its ability to survive.
In larger organisms, for examp le, only a small percentage of cells are concerned with readin g and responding to environmental stimuli. Tha t is the role of gro ups of specialized cells that form the tissu es and organs of the nerv ous system. The function of the nerv ous system is to perceive the environment and coordinate the beha vior of aJJ the other cells in the vast cellular community.
Division of labor among the cells in the community offered an additional survival advan tage. The efficiency it offered enabled more cells to live on less. Consider the old adage, "Two can live as cheaply as one." Or consider the construction costs of building a two- bedroo m, single home versus the cost of building a two-bedroom apar tment in a hundred-apa rtm ent complex. To survive, each cell is required to expend a certain amount of energy. The amo un t of energy conserved

Evolution Without the Bloody Claws
Thou gh Darwin is by far the most famous evolutionist, the first scientist to establish evolution as a scientific fact was the distinguished French biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. [Lamarck 1809, 1914, 1963) Even Ernst Mayr, the leading architect of " neo Darwinism," a modernization of Darwin' s theory that incorporates twentieth-century mo lecular genetics, concedes that Lamarck was the pioneer. In his clas

by individuals living in a comm unity contributes to both an increased survival advan tage and a better quality of life.
In American capitalism, Henry Ford saw the tactical ad vantage in the differentiated form of comm unal effort and employed it in creating his assem bly line system of man ufacturing cars. Before Ford, a sm all team of multi-skilled w orkers would requ ire a week or two to build a single automobile. Ford organized his shop so that every worker was responsible for only one specialized job. He stationed a large number of these differentiated work ers along a sing le row, the assembly line, and passed the developing car from one specialist to the next. The efficiency of job specialization enabled Ford to prod uce a n ew auto mobile in 90minutes rather than weeks.
Unfortunately, we conve niently "forgot" about the cooperation necessary for evolution when Charles Darwin emphasized a radically different theory about the emergence of life. He concluded 150 years ago that living organi sms are perpetually embroiled in a "s tru ggle for existence." For Darwin, struggle and violence are not only a part of animal (h uman) nature, but the principal "forces" behind evolutionary advancement. In the final chapter of The Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection, Or, The Preseroation Of Favoured Races In 771e Struggle For Life, Darw in wr ote of an inevitable "struggle for life" and that evolution was dri ven by " the war of nature, from famine and death." Couple that with Darwin' s notion that evolution is random and you have a world, as poetically described by Tennyson that can be characterized as " red in tooth and claw," a series of meaningless, bloody battles for survival.



The B io log y of B e l i e f
sic 1970 book Evolution and the Diversity of Life, [Mayr 1976, page 227] Mayr wrote: "It seems to me Lamarck has a much better claim to be designated the 'founder of the theory of evolution,' as ind eed he has by several French historians .. .he wa s the first au thor to devote an entire book primarily to the presentation of a theory of organic evolution . He was the first to present the en tire system of animals as a pro duct of evolution."
No t only did Lamarck present his theory fifty years before Darwin, he offered a much less harsh theory of the mechanisms of evolution . Lamarck's theory suggested that evolution was based on an "instructive," cooperative interaction amo ng organisms and their environment that enables life f orm s to survive and evolve in a dynamic world. His noti on was that organisms acquire and pass on adaptations necessary for their survival in a changing env ironment. Interestingly, Lamarck's hypothesis about the mechanisms of evo lution conform to modem cell biologists' understanding of how immune sys tems ada pt to their environment as described above.
Lamarck's theory was an early target of the Church. The notion that humans evolved from lower life forms was denoun ced as heresy. Lamarck was also scorn ed by his fellow scientists who, as creationists, ridiculed his theories. A German develop mental biologist, Augus t Weismann, helped propel Lamarck into obscurity when he tried to test Lamarck' s theory that organis ms pass on surv ival-oriented traits acquired through their interaction with the env ironment. In one of Weismann's experiments, he cut off the tails of male and female mice an d mated them. Weismann argued that if Lamarck's theory were correct, the parents should pass on their tail-less state to futur e generations . The first generation of mice was born with tails. Weismann rep eated the experiment for 21 more genera tions, but not one tail-less mouse was born, leading Weismann to conclude tha t Lamarc k's notion of inheritance was wrong.
But Weismann' s experiment was not a true test of Lamarck's theory . Lamarck suggested that such evolutionary changes could take "immense periods of time," accordin g to biographer L. J. [ordanova.In

CHAPTER O NE Lessons From the Pet ri Dish
1984, Jordanova wrote that Lamarck's theory "rested on" a number of "propositions" including: " ... th e laws governing livin g things have produced increasingly complex forms over immense pe riods of time." [jordanova 1984, page 71] Weismann's five-year experime nt was clearly not long enough to test the theory. An even more fundam ental flaw in his experiment is tha t Lamarck nev er argue d tha t every change an organis m experienced wo uld take hold. Lamarck said organisms hang on to traits (like tails) when they need them to surv ive. Although Weismann didn't think the mice needed their tails, no one asked the mice if they thought their tails we re necessary for survival!
Despite its obvious flaws, the study of the tail-less mice helped destroy Lamarck's reputation. In fact, Lamarck has been mostly ignored or vilified. Corne ll University evolutionis t C.H. Waddington, wrote in The Evolution of An Evolutionist [Waddington 1975, page 38]: "Lamarck is the only major figure in the history of biology whose name has become to all intents an d pu rp oses, a term of abuse. Most scientis ts' contributions are fated to be outgrown, but very few authors have written works, which, two centuries later, are still rejected with indignation so intense that the skeptic may suspect something akin to an uneasy conscience. In point of fact, Lamarck has, I think, been somewha t unfairly judged ."
Wadding ton wrote those presc ient wo rds thir ty years ago . Toda y Lamarck's theories are being reevaluated under the weight of a body of new science that suggests that the oft-d enounced biologist was not entirely wrong and the oft-laude d Dar win not entirely correc t. The title of an ar ticle in the prestigious jour nal Science in 2000 wa s one sign of glasnos t: "Was Lamarck Jus t a Little Bit Right?" [Balter 2000J
One reason some scientists are taking another look at Lamarck is that evolutionists are reminding us of the invaluable role cooperation plays in sus taining life in the biosph ere. Scientists have long noted symbiotic relatio nships in nature. In Darwin's Blind Spot [Ryan 2002, page 16], British phys ician Frank Ryan chronicles a number of such relationships, including a yellow shrimp that gathers food while its partner gobi fish protects it from pred ators, and a species of hermit
43



T h e I>io log y of I>e l ie f
crab that carries a pink anemone on top of its shell. "Fish and octopuses like to feed on hermit crabs, bu t when they approach this species, the anemone shoo ts out its brilliantly colored tentacles, wi th their microscopic batteries of poisoned darts, and sting the potential predator, encouraging it to look elsewhere for its meal." The wa rrior
ane mone gets something out of the relati onship as well because it eats the crab's leftover food .
But today's understanding of cooper ation in natur e goes much dee per than the easily observable ones . "Biologists are becoming increasingly aware that animals have coevo lved, and continue to coexist, with diverse assemblages of microorganisms that are required for normal health and de velopment," according to a recent article in Science called "We Get By With A Little Help From Our (Uttle) Friends ." [Ruby, et al, 2004] The stu dy of these relationships is now a rapidl y grow ing field called "Systems Biology."
Ironically, in recent decades, we have been tau ght to wage war aga ins t microorganisms with everything from anti-bacterial soap to antibiotics. But that simplistic message ignores the fact tha t many bac-teria are essential to our health. The classic example of how humans get help from microorganisms is the bacteria in our digestive system, which are essential to our surv ival. The bacteria in our stomach and intestinal tract help digest food and also enable the absorp tion of Iifesus taining vitamins. This microbe-human cooperation is the reason that the rampan t use of antibiotics is detrimental to our survival. An tibiotics are indiscriminate killers; they kill bac teria that are required for our survival as efficiently as they kill harmful bacteria.
Recent advances in genome science have revealed an additional mechanism of cooperation am ong species. Living organisms, it turns out, actually integrate their cellular communi ties by sharing their genes. It ha d been thought that genes are passed on only to the progeny of an individ ual orga nism thr ough reproduction. Now scientists realize that genes are shared not only among the individual m embers of a species, but also amo ng members of different species. The sharing of genetic information via gene transfer speeds up evolution since

organisms can acquire "learned" experiences from other organisms. [Nitz, et al, 2004; Pennisi 2004; Boucher, et al, 2003; Dutta and Pan, 2002; Gogarten 2003] Given this sharing of genes, organisms can no longer be seen as disconnected entities; there is no wall between species. Daniel Drell, manager of the Department of Energy's microbial genome program told Science in (2001 294:1634): " .. .we can no longer comfortably say wh at is a species anymore." [Pennisi 2001]
This sharin g of information is ·not an accident. It is nature's method of enhancing the surviv al of the biosphere. As discussed earlier, genes are ph ysical memories of an organism's learned experi ences. The recently recognized exchange of genes among individuals disperses those memories, thereby influencing the survival of all organisms that make up the community of life. Now that we are aware of this inter- and intra-species gene transfer mechanism, the dangers of genetic engineering become apparent. For example, tinkering with the genes of a tomato may not stop at that tomato, but could alter the entire biosphere in ways that we cannot foresee . Already there is a study that shows that wh en humans digest genetically modified foods, the artificially created genes transfer into and alter the character of the beneficial bacteria in the intestine. [Heritage 2004; Netherwood, et al, 2004] Similarly, gene transfer among genetically engineered agricultural crop s and surroun ding nati ve species has given rise to highly resistant species deemed superweeds. [Milius 2003; Haygood, et al, 2003; Desplanque, et al, 2002; Spencer and Snow 2001] Genetic engineers have never taken the reality of gene transfer into consideration when they have introduced genetically modified organisms into the environment. We are now beginning to experience the dire consequences of this oversight as their enginee red genes are spreading among, and altering other organisms in the environme nt. [Watrud, et al, 2004]
Genetic evolutionists warn that if we fail to apply the lessons of our shared genetic destiny, which should be teaching us the importance of cooperation among all species, we threaten human existence. We need to move beyond Darwinian theory, which stresses the importance of individuals, to one that stresses the importance of the commu

nity. British scientist Timothy Lent on provides evidence that evolution is more depend en t on the interaction among species than it is on the interaction of indi viduals within a species. Evolution becomes a matter of the survival of the fittest groups rather than the survival of the fittes t individuals. In a 1998 ar ticle in Nature, Len ton wrote that rather than focusing on individuals and their role in evolution, " ... We must cons id er the totality of organisms and their material environmen t to fully unde rstand which trai ts corne to persist and d ominate." [Len ton 1998]
Lenton subscribes to James Lovelock's Gaia hyp othesis that hold s tha t the Earth and all of its species constitute one interactive, living organism . Those who endorse the hyp othesis argue that tampering with the balance of that super-organism called Gaia, wh ether it be by des troying the ra inforest, d epleting the ozo ne layer or altering organisms through genetic engineering, can threaten its survival and consequen tly ours.
Recent stud ies funded by Britain' s N atural Environment Research Counc il provide sup port for those concerns. [Thomas, et al, 2004; Stevens, et al, 2004] While there have been five mass extinctions in the history of our plan et, th ey are all presumed to have been caused by extraterr estrial even ts, such as a cornet smashin g to earth . One of the new stud ies conclud es that the "natural world is experiencing the sixth, major extinction even t in its history." [Lovell 2004] This time thou gh, the cause of the extinctions is not extraterrestrial. According to one of the stu dy's a utho rs, Jeremy Thom as: "As far as we can tell this one is caus ed by one animal organism - man."

surr ounding you, no doubt follows a Darwinian model, but it always seemed to me an ironic pursuit for those who are striving to become compassionate healers.
But my stereotypes about medical stu de nts toppled during my stay on the island. After my call to arms, my class of misfits stopped acting like conventional medic al student s; they dropped their survival of the fittest m entality and amalgamated into a single force, a team that helped them survive the semes ter. The stronger students helped the weake r and in so doing, all became stronger. Their harmony was both surp rising and beautiful to observe.
In the end , there was a bonus: a happy Hollywood ending. For their final exam, I gave my students exactly the same test the stu dents in Wisconsin had to pass . There was virtually no difference in the performance of these "rejects" and their "elitist" counterparts in the States. Many stu dents later reported that whe n they went home and met with their peers who attended American medical schools, they proudly fOW1d themselves more proficient in their understanding of the principles governing the life of cells and organisms.
I was of course thrilled that my students had pull ed off an acad emic miracle. But it was years before I underst ood how they wer e able to do it. At the time, I thought the form at of the' cour se was key, and I still believe that overlap ping human and cell biology is a better way to present the course material. But now that I've ventured into what I told yo u wou ld be considered by some as wacky Dr. Dolittle territory, I think a good part of the rea son for my students' success was that they eschewed the behavior of their counterparts in the United States. Instead of mirroring smart American medical students, they mirrored the behavior of smart cells, banding together to become even smarter. I didn't tell my stude nts to pattern their lives after the lives of the cells, becaus e I was still steeped in traditional, scientific training. But I like to think that they went in tha t dir ection intuitively, after liste.ning to my praise of cells' ability to group together coope rative ly to form more complex and highly successfu l organisms.

Will never forge t a piece of wisdo m I received in 1967, on the first day I learned to clone stem cells in graduate schoo l. It took me decades to realize how pr ofound this seemingly simple piece of wisdo m was for my wo rk and my life. My professor, mentor and consummate scientist, Irv Konigsberg was one of the first cell biologists to master the art of cloning stem cells. He told me that when the cultured cells you are studying are ailing, yo u look first to the cell' s env ironment, not to the cell itself for the cause.
My professor wasn' t as blunt as Bill Clin ton's cam paign manager James Carville, who decreed, "It's the economy, stu pid," to be the m antra for the 1992 pr esidential election. But cell biologists would have done well to pos t, " It's the environment, stup id," over our desks, jus t as the " It's the economy, stu pid" sign was posted at Clinton head quarters. Thou gh it wasn' t apparent at the time, I eventually r ealized that this advice was a key insight into understanding the nature of life. Over an d over 1 learned the wisdom of Irv's advice.

But most cell biologists knew nothin g of this wisdom of tissue culture techniq ues . And scientists moved sharply away from considering environmental influ ences after Watson and Crick's revelation of DNA's
genetic code. Even Charles Darwin conceded, near the end of his life, that his evolutionary theor y had sho rtchan ged the role of the environment. In an 1876 letter to Moritz Wagner he wro te: [Darwin, F 1888]
"In my opinion, the greatest error w hich I ha ve committed has been not allowing sufficient w eight to the direct action of the environme n ts, i.e , food , climate, etc., independently of na tural selection ...When I wrote the "Origin," and for some years afterwards, I could find little good evidence of the direct action of the environmen t; now there is a large bod y of evidence."
Scientists wh o follow Dar win contin ue to make the sam e error. The p roblem w ith this underemphasis on the environment is that it led to an overemphasis on "nature" in the form of genetic determinism the belief that genes "control" biology. This belief has not only led to a
misallocation of research do llar s, as r will argue in a later chapter, but more importan tly, it has changed the way we think abo ut our lives. When you are con vinced that genes contr ol yo ur life and you know that yo u had no say in which genes you were saddled wi th at conception, you have a good excuse to conside r yourself a victim of heredity . "Don' t blame m e for my wor k habits- it's not my faul t that I' ve been procrastin atin g on my deadline ...It's genetic!"

The confusion occurs when the media repeated ly distort the meaning of two words: correlation an d causa tion. It's one thing to be linked to a disease; it's quite another to cause a disea se, which implies a d irecting, controlling action. IT I show you my keys and say that a particular key "controls" my car, you at first migh t think that makes sense because you know you need that key to tum on the ignition. But does the key actually "control" the car? IT it did, you couldn't leave the key in the car alone because it might just borr ow your car for a joy rid e when you are not paying attention . In truth, the key is "correlated" with the control of the car; th e person who turns the key actually controls the car. Specific genes are correlated wi th an organism's behavior and characteristics . But these genes are not activated un til something trigge rs them.
What activates genes? The answer wa s elegan tly spelled out in 1990 in a paper entitled "Metaphors an d the Role of Genes and
chemical mechanic s. Are your kids unruly? Increasing ly the first choice is to medicate these children to correct their "chemica l imbalances," rather than fully grappling with wha t is going on in their bod ies, minds and spirits.
Of course there is no do ubt that some diseases, like Huntington's cho rea, beta thalassemia and cystic fibros is, can be blamed entirely on one faulty gene. But single-gene disorders affect less than two percent of the population; the vast majority of people come into this world with genes that should enable them to live a happy and healthy life. The diseases tha t are toda y's scour ges - diabetes, heart disease and cancer -short circuit a happy and healthy life. These diseases, however, are not the result of a single gene, but of complex interactions among multiple genes an d environmental factors.
What about all those headlines trumpeting the discovery of a gene for everything from depression to schizophre nia? Read those articles closely and you' ll see that behin d the breathless headlines is a more sober truth. Scientists have linked lots of genes to lots of different diseases an d traits, b ut scientists have rarely foun d that one gene causes a trait or a disease.

Development " by H. F. ijhout. [Nijhout 1990] Nijhout presents evidence that the notion that genes control biology has been so frequently repeated for such a long period of time th at scientists h ave forgotten it is a hyp oth esis, not a truth. In reality, the idea that genes control biology is a supposition, which has never been proven and in fact has been undermined by the latest scientific research . Genetic control, argues Nijho ut, has become a metaphor in our society. We want to believe tha t genetic engineers are the new medical magicians who can cure diseases and while they're at it create more Einsteins an d Mozarts as we ll. But metaphor does not equate with scientific truth. Nijhout summarizes the truth: "When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates expression of that gene." In other words, when it comes to genetic control, lilt's the environm ent, stupid ."
Prote in: The Stuff of Life
It is easy to understand how genetic contro l became a metaphor as scientists with ever-greater excitement zeroed in on the m echanis ms of DNA. Organic che mists discovered that cells are mad e up of four types of very large molecules: polysaccharides (complex sugars), lipids (fats), nucleic acids (DNA/ RNA) and pro teins. Though the cell requires each of the four molecular types, proteins are the m ost important sing le component for living organisms. Our cells are, in the main, an assembly of protein-building blocks. So one way of looking at our trillion-eelled bod ies is that they are protein machines, although, as you know, I think we are more than machinesl It soun ds simple, but it isn' t. For one thing, it takes over 100,000 different types of proteins to run our bodies.
Let's take a closer look at how our cells' 100,000 plus pr oteins are assembled . Each protein is a linear s tring of linked amino acid molecules, comparable to a child's pop bead necklace as illustrated on the followin g page.
Each bead rep resents one of the twenty amino acid molecules used by cells. Though I like the pop bead analogy because everyo ne is familiar with it, it is not an exact one because each amin o acid has a slight

ly different shape. So to be completely accura te, you should think of a pop bead necklace that got mangled a bit in the factory.
And to be even more accura te, you should know that the amino acid necklace, which form s the "backbone" of the cells' proteins, is far more malleable than a pop bead necklace, which falls apar t w hen you bend it too much. The str ucture and behav ior of the linked amino acids in protein backbones better resemble that of a snake's backbone. The spine of a sna ke, made up of a large number of linked subun its, the vertebrae, is capa ble of coiling the snake into a wide variety of shapes, ranging from a strai ght rod to a knotted "ball."
The flexible links (peptide bonds) between amino acid s in a protein backbone ena bles each protein to adopt a variety of shapes. Thr ough the rotation and flexion of their amino acid "vertebrae," protein molecules resembl e nano- snakes in their ability to w rithe and sq uirm. There are tw o prim ary factors that determine the contour of a protein's backbone, and therefore its shape. One factor is the ph ysical pattern defined by the sequence of differently shaped amin o acids comprising the pop bead -like backbone.
The second factor concerns the interaction of electromagnetic charges among the link ed amino acids. Most amin o acid s have posi

As shown above, a protein's flexible backbone spont aneously folds into a preferred sh ape when its amino acid subunits rotate and flex their bonds to balance the forces gene rated by their positive and negative charges.

CHAPTER Two
The protein backbones shown in A and B have the exact some amino acid (pipe fitting) sequence but rev eal radically different shapes (conformations). Variations in the backbone's shape result from differentiaLrotations at the junctions between adjacent fittings. Uke pipe fittings, the protein's differently shaped amino acids also rotate around their jundlons (pep tide bonds), allowing the backbone to wriggle like Q snake. Proteins shape-shift though they w lU Citenerally prefer two or three specific conformations. Which of the two conformations, A or B, would our hypothetical pro tein prefer? The answer is related to the fa d that the two terminal amino acids (pipe fittings) have reelons of negative charg es. Since like -charges repel each other, the farther aport they ar e, the more stabl e the conformation. Conformation A wo uLd be preferred because the negative charg es are farther apart than they are in B.
The backbones of some protein molecules are so long that they require the assistance of special "helper" proteins called cha perones to aid in the folding process. Imp rop erly folded proteins, like people with spinal defects, are unable to function optimally. Such aberrant pro teins are mar ked for destruction by the cell; their backbone amin o acids are disassembled and recycled in the synthesis of new proteins.

How Proteins Create Life
Living organisms are distingu ished from non-living en tities by the fact that they move; th ey are animated. The.energy driving th eir movements is harnessed to do the "work" that characterizes living systems, such as respiration, d igestion, and muscle con trac tion. To understand the nature of life one must first understand how protein "machines" are empowered to move .
The final shape, or conformation (the techni cal term used by biologists), of a pro tein molecule reflects a balanced sta te amo ng its electromagnetic charges. However, if the protein' s positive and negative charges are altere d, the protein backbone w ill dynamically twist and adjust itself to accommoda te t he new clistribution of cha rges . The dis tribution of electromagnetic charge within a protein can be selectively altered by a number of processes includ ing: the bin cling of other mo lecules or chemical gro ups such as hormones; the enz ymatic removal or adclition of charged ions; or interference from electromagnetic fields such as those emanating from cell phones.

Figure A shows the preferred conformation of our hypothetical protein backbone. The rep elling forces between the two negatively charged term inal amino acids (a rrow s) causes the backbone to extend so that the negati ve amino acids are as for apart as possible. Figure B shows a dose-up of an end amino acid. A signal, in this case a molecule with a very positive eledric charge (while sphe re), is attracted to, and binds with, the negative site on the protein's terminal amino acid . In our particu lar scenario, the signal is more positive in charge than the ami no acid is negative in charge. After the signal couples with the protein, there is now an excess positive charge at this end of the backbone . Since positive and negative charges attract one another, the backbone's amino acids will rotate around the ir bonds so that positive and negative terminals will come closer together. Figure C shows the protein changing from conformation A to conformation B. Changing conformations generates movement and the movement is harnessed to do work, providing for such functions as digestion , respiration a nd muscle contraction. Wh en the signal detaches, the protein returns to Its preferred e xtended conformation . This is how signal-generated protein move ments provide for life.

The Primacy of DNA
You'll notice that in the above section 1 didn' t discuss D A at all. That's because it is the changing of the proteins' electromagnetic charges that is responsible for their behavior-generating movement, not DN A. H ow did we get to the Widespread and often-eited notion that genes "contro l" biology? In the Origin of Species, Darwin suggested that "hereditary" factors were passed on from generation to generation, controlling the traits of the offspring . Darwin's influ ence was so great that scientists myopically focused on identifying that hered itary material w hich, they thou ght, controlled life.
In 1910, intensive microscopic analyses revea led that the hereditary information passed on generation after generati on was contained in chromosomes, thread-like struc tures that become visible in the cell just before it div ides into two "daughter" cells. Chr omosomes are incor porated into the daughter cell's largest organelle, the nucleus. When scientists isolated the nucleu s, they dissected the chromosomes and found that the hereditary element s were essentially comp rised of only two kind s of molecules, protein and DNA. Somehow the protein machinery of life was entangled in the structure and function of these chromosome molecules.
The understanding of the chro moso me's fun ctions was fur ther refined in 1944 when scientists determined that it was DNA that actually con tained heredit ary information . [Avery, et al, 1944; Lederberg 1994] The experime nts that singled out DNA were elegan t. These scientists isolated pure DNA from one species of bacteria -let's call it Species A - and adde d the pure DNA to cultures containing only Species B bacteria. Within a short time, Species B bacteria began to show hereditary traits that were formerly seen only in Species A. Once it was known that you needed nothing other than DNA to pass on traits, the DNA molecule became a scien tific supers tar .
It was now left to Watson and Crick to unravel the stru ctur e and function of that superstar molecule. DN A molecules are long and thr eadlike. They are made from four nitrogen-containin g chemicals called bases (ade nine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine or A, T, C and

CHAPTER Two It 's the Environm ent, Stupid
G). Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA's structure led to the fact that the sequence of the A, T, C and G bases in DNA spells ou t the sequence of amino acids along a protein's backbone [Watson and Crick 1953). Those long strings of DNA molecules can be subdivided into single genes, segments that provide the blueprint for specific proteins. The code for recreating the protein machin ery of the cell had been cracked !
Watson and Crick also explained why DNA is the perfec t hered itary molecule. Each DNA strand is normally intertw ined with a second strand of DNA, a loosely wrapped configuration known as the "double helix." The genius of this system is that the seq uences of DNA bases on both strands are mirror images of each other. When the two stran ds of DNA un wind, each single strand contains the information to make an exact, complementary copy of itself. So thr ough a pr ocess of separa ting the strands of a double helix, D A molecules become self-replicating. This observation led to the assumption that DNA "controlled" its own replication ... it was its own "boss."
The "s uggestion" that DNA controlled its own replication and also served as the blueprint for the body's pro teins led Francis Crick to create biology' s Central Dogma, the belief that DNA ru les. The dogma is so fun damental to modem biology it is essentially written in stone, the equivalent of science's Ten Command ments. The do gma, also referred to as "The Prim acy of DNA," is a fixture of every scien tific text.
In the dogma's scheme of how life unfolds, DNA perches loftily on top, followed by RNA. RNA is the sh ort-lived Xerox" copy of the DNA. As such, it is the physical template encoding the amino acid sequence that makes up a pro tein's backbone. The Primacy of 0 A diagram provides the logic for the Age of Gene tic Determinism . Because the character of a living orga nism is defined by the nature of its proteins, and its proteins are encoded in the DNA, then by logic, DNA would represent the "first cause" or primary determinant of an organism's traits.

The Huma n Genome Project
After DNA achieved superstar status, the remaining chalJenge was to crea te a catal ogu e of all the gene tic stars .in the human firmament. Enter the Human Genome Project, a global, scientific effort begun in the late 1980s to create a catalogue of all the genes present in humans.
From the outset, the Human Genome Project wa s a massively ambitious one. Conve ntional thou ght held that the body needed one gen e to pro vide the blueprint for each of the 100,000 plus different proteins that make up our bodies . Add to that at least 20,000 regul atory genes, which orchestrate the activity of the protein-encoding genes. Scientists concluded that the human genome would contain a minimum of 120,000 genes located within the twenty -three pairs of human c h rom osome s .
But that wasn' t the whole story . A cosmic joke was unfolding, one of those jokes that periodicaUy unsettl e scientists convinced they have discovered th e secrets of the Universe . Cons ider the impact of Ni colaus Copernicus' discovery published in 1543 that the Earth was not the center of the Universe as was thought by the scientist-theologians of the day. The fact that the Earth actually revolved around the sun, and that the sun itself was not the center of the universe, undermined the teachings of the Church. Copernicus' paradigm-busting discover ies launched the modem, scientific revoluti on by challenging the presumed "infallibility" of the Church. Science even tuaUy disp laced the Churc h as Western civilization's source of wisdo m for under stan ding the mysteries of the Universe.
Gene ticists experienced a compara ble shock whe n, contrary to their expectations of over 120,000 genes, they found that the entire human genome cons ists of approximately 25,000 genes. [Penni si 2003a and 2003b; Pearson 2003; Goodman 2003] More than eigh ty percent of the presumed an d required DNA does not exist! The missing genes are proving to be more troublesome than the miss ing eighteen minutes of the Nixon tapes . The one-gene, one-protein concep t was a fundamental tenet of gene tic determinism. Now that the Human Genome Project has top pled th e one-gene for one-pro tein concept, our cur ren t theories

of how life works have to be scrapped. No longer is it possible to believe tha t genetic engin eers can with relative ease fix all ou r biological dilemmas. The re are simply not enough genes to accoun t for the complexity of human life or of human disease.
I may sound like Chicken Little sho uting that the gene tics sky is falling. H owever, yo u d on' t have to take my word for it. Chicken Big is saying the same thing. In a commen tary on the surprising results of the Human Genome Project, David Baltimore, one of the world's preeminen t geneticists and a Nobel Prize w inne r, ad dressed the issue of human complexity: [Baltimore 2001]



T h e B i ol o g y o f Belief
" But unless the human genome contains a lot of genes tha t are opaque to our computers, it is clear that we do not gain our undoubted com plexity over worms and plants by using more genes.
" Understan ding what does give us our complexity - our enormou s behavioral repertoire, abiLity to prod uce conscious action, remarkable phys ical coordina tion, precisely tuned alterations in resp onse to extern al variations of the env ironments, learning, memory, need I go on? - remains a challenge for the fu ture."
As Baltimore states, the results of the H uman Genome Project force us to cons ider othe r ideas about how life is con trolled. " Understanding w ha t does give us our complexity .. .remains a challen ge for the future." The sky is fallin g.
In ad dition, the results of the Human Genome Project are forcin g us to reconsider our genetic relationship w ith other organisms in the biosphere. We can no longer use genes to explain why hum ans are at the top of the evolutionary ladder . It turns out there is not mu ch difference in the total number of genes found in humans and those found in primitive organis ms . Let's take a look at thr ee of the most studied anima l models in gene tic research, a microscop ic nematode roundworm known as Caenorhnbditis elegans, the fruit fly an d the laborato ry m ou s e.
The primitive Cnenorhabditis worm serves as a perfect model for stu dy ing the ro le of genes in development and behavi or. This rapidly growing and reprodu cing organism has a precisel y patterned body comprised of exactly 969 cells and a simp le brain of abo ut 302 cells. None theless it has a unique repert oire of behav iors and most imp ortan tly, it is amena ble to genetic experimentation. The Caenorhabditis genom e cons ists of ap proximately 24,000 genes. [Blaxter 2003] The human body, compr ised of over fifty trillion cells, contains only 1,500 more genes than the lowly, spineless, thousand-celled microscopic wo rm .
The frui t fly, another favored research subject, has 15,000 genes. [Blaxter 2003; Celnike r, et al, 2002] So the profoundly more complicated fruit fly has 9,000 fewer genes than the more primitive

Caenorhobditis worm. And when it comes to the qu estion of mice and men, we mi ght have to think more highl y of them, or less of ourselves; the results of parall el genome proj ects reveal that humans and rodents have roughly the same number of genes!
CHAPTER Two It 's the Environm ent, St upid
In retros pect, scien tists sho uld have known that genes couldn't pro vide the con trol of our lives. By definition, the brain is the organ responsible for controlling and coord ina ting the physiology and behavior of an organi sm . But is the nucleus trul y the cell's br ain? If our assumption that the nucleus and its DNA-containing material is the "bra in" of the cell, then removing the cell's nucleus, a procedure called en uclea tion, should res ult in the imm ed iate death of the cell.
An d now, for the big exp eriment... (Maestro, a drum roll if you p lease).
The scientist dr ags our unwilling cell into the microscop ic operating arena an d straps it do wn. Using a micromanipulator, the scien tist gu ides a needle-like micropipette into p osition above the cell. With a deft thrust of the manipulator, our investigator plunges the pipette deep into the cell's cytoplasmic interior. By ap plying a little suction, the nucleus is drawn up into the pipe tte and the pipe tte is w ithdrawn from the cell. Below the nucleus-engorged pipette lies our sacr ificial cell - its "brain" tom out.
But wait' It's still moving! My God ...the cell is still alive!
The wound has closed and like a recovering surgical patient, the cell begins to slow ly stagger abou t. Soon the cell is back on its feet (OK, its pseudop od s), fleeing the microscope's field wi th the hope that it will never see a doc tor again.
Followin g enuclea tion, many cells can survive for up to two or more months wi thou t genes. Viable enuclea ted cells do not lie abo ut like brain-d ead lumps of cytoplasm on life-support systems. These cells actively ingest an d metabolize food, maintain coordina ted operation of their ph ysiologic sys tems (respiration, d igestion, excretion, motili ty, etc.), retain an abili ty to comm unicate w ith other cells, and



T h e Biolog y o f B e l i e f
are able to enga ge in appro priate responses to grow th and protectionrequiring enviro nme ntal stimuli .
Unsurprisingly, enucleation is not without side effects. Witho ut their genes, cells are not ab le to divide, nor are they able to reproduce any protein parts they lose through the normal wear and tear of the cytoplasm. The inability to replace defective cytoplasmic pro teins contributes to mechanical dysfunctions that ultimately result in the death of the cell.
Our experim ent was designed to test the idea that the nucleus is the "brain" of the cell. If the cell had died immed iately following enucleation, the observa tions would have at least sup ported tha t belief. However, the results are unam biguous: en ucleated cells still exhibit complex, coordinated, life-sustaini ng behaviors, which imply that the cell's "brain" is still intact and functionin g.
The fact that en ucleated cells retain their biological functions in the absence of genes is by no mean s a new discovery. Over a hundred years ago, classical em bryologists routinely removed the nuclei from dividing egg cells and showed that a sing le, enuclea ted egg cell was able to develop as far as the blastul a, an embryonic stage consisting of forty or mor e cells. Tod ay, enucleated cells are used for ind ustrial purposes as living "feeder" layers in cell cultures designed for virus vaccine production .
If the.nucleu s and its genes are not the cell's brain, then w hat exactIy is DNA's contribution to cellular life? Enucleated cells die, not because they have lost their brain but because they have lost their reproductive capabilities. Without the ability to reprod uce their p arts, enucleated cells cannot replace failed protein build ing blocks, nor replicate themselves. So the nu cleus is not the brain of the cell - the nucleus is the cell's gonad ! Confusing the gonad with the brain is an und erstandable error because science has always been and still is a patriarchal endeavor. Males have often been accused of thinking with their gonads, so it's not entirely sur prising that science has inadvertently confu sed the nucleus with the cell's brain!

Epigenetics: The New Sc ience of
Self-Empowerment
Genes-as-des tiny theorists have obviously ignored hundred-yearold science about enucleated cells, but they cannot ignore new research that undermines their belief in genetic determinism. While the Human Geno me Project was making headlines, a group of scientists we re inau gurating a new, revolutionary field in biology called epigenetics. The science of epigenetics, which literally means "control above genetics," profoundly changes our understan din g of how life is controlled . [Pray 2004; Silverman 2004] In the last deca de, ep igene tic research has established that DNA blueprints passed down throu gh genes are not set in concrete at birth. Genes ar e not destiny! Environmental influences, including nutrition, stress and emotions, can mod ify those genes, without changing their basic blueprint. And those modifications, epigeneti cists have d iscovered, can be passed on to future generations as surely as DNA blueprints are passed on via the Double Helix. [Reik and Walter 2001; Surani 2001]
There is no doubt that epigenetic discoveries have lagged behind gene tic discoveries. Since the late 1940s, biologists have been isolating DNA from the cell's nucleu s in ord er to study genetic mechanisms. In the process they extract the nucleu s from the cell, break ope n its enveloping membrane and remove the chr omosomal contents, half of which is mad e up of DNA and half of which is mad e up of regulatory p roteins. In their zeal to stu d y DNA, most scientists threw away the proteins, which we now know is the equivalent of throwin g the baby out with the bathwater. Epigeneticists are bringing back the baby, by studying the chromosome's pro teins, an d those pro teins are turning out to play as crucial a role in heredi ty as DNA.
In the chr omosome, the DNA forms the core, an d the proteins cover the DNA like a sleeve. When the genes are covered, their information cann ot be "read." Imagine your bare arm as a piece of DNA representing the gene that codes for blue eyes . In the nu cleu s, this stretch of DNA is covered by bou nd regulatory proteins, which cover your blue-eye gene like a shir tsleeve, making it imp ossible to be rea d .

Primacy of Environment . The new science reveals that the information thot controis biology storts with Environmental Signals that in tum, control the binding of Regulatory Proteins to the DNA. Regulatory Proteins diredthe adivity of genes. The DNA, RNA , and Protein functions are the same as described in the Primacy of DNAchart. Note:the flow of information Isno longer unidirectional. In the 19605, Howard Temin's challenged the Central Dogma with experiments that revealed RNA could go against the predicted flow of information and rewrite the DNA. Originally ridiculed for his"heresy," Temln later won Q Nobel Prize for describing reverse tran
scriptase, the molecular mechanism by which RNA can rewrite the geneticcode. Reverse transcriptaseisnow notorious, for it Is usedby the AIDSvirus' RNAto commandeer the infected cell's DNA. It is also now known that changesin the DNAmolecule, suchas adding or removing methyl chemical groups, influencesthe bindingof regulatory proteins. Proteinsmustalso be able to buckthe predicted flow of information, sinceprotein antibodies in immune cells are involved with changingthe DNAin the cellsthat synthesize them. The size of the arrows indicatinginformation flow are not the some. There are light restrictions on the reverse flow of information, a design that would prevent radical changesto the cell'sgenome.
._ - - - -
How do you get that sleeve of£? You need an environm ental signal to spur the "sleeve" pro tein to chan ge shape, i.e. detach from the DNA's d ouble helix, allowing the gene to be read . Once the DNA is uncovered, the cell makes a copy of the exposed gene. As a result, the activity of the gene is "controlled" by the presence or absence of the ensleeving p roteins, which are in turn controlled by environmental signa ls.
68



69
The story of epigenetic control is the story of how environmental signa ls control the activity of genes. It is now clear tha t the Primacy of DNA chart described ear lier is outmoded. The revised sche me of informati on flow should now be called the "Primacy of the Environment." The new, more sophisticated flow of information in biology starts with an environmental signal, then goes to a regulatory p rotein and only then goes to DNA, RNA, and the end result, a protein.
The science of ep igenetics has also mad e it clear that there are two mechanisms by which organisms pass on hereditary information. Those two mechanisms provide a way for scientists to stud y both the contribu tion of nature (genes) and the contribution of nurture (epigenetic mechanisms) in human behavior. If yo u only focus on the blueprints, as scientists have been doing for decad es, the influence of the env ironment is im possible to fatho m. [Dennis 2003; Chakr avarti and Little 2003]
Let's present an analogy, which hopefull y will make the relationship between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms clearer. Are you old enough to remember the days when television programming stopped after midnight? After the norm al programming signed off, a " test pattern" would appear on the screen. Most test patterns looked like a dartboard with a bull's eye in the middle, similar to the one pictured on the following page.
Think of the pattern of the test screen as the pa ttern encoded by a given gene, say the one for brown eyes. The dial s and sw itches of the TV fine-tune the test screen by allowing you to tum it on and off and modulate a number of characteristics, including color, hu e, contras t, brightness, vertical and horizontal holds. By adjusting the dials, you can alter the appearance of the patte rn on the screen, while not actu ally changing the original broad cast pattern. This is precisely the role of regul atory proteins. Stu dies of protein synthesis reveal that epigenetic "dials" can create 2,000 or more variations of pro teins from the same gene blueprint. [Bray 2003; Schmuker, et al, 2000]

In this epigenetic analogy, the test patt ern on the screen represents the protein backbone patt ern e ncode d by a gene. Wh ile the TV's controls can change the appearance of the pattern (8 and e ), they do not chang e the orig inal pattern of the broadcast (i.e. , the gene) . Epigenetic control modifi es the read -out of a gene w ithout changingthe DNAcode.

We no w kno w that the environm entally influenced fine-tuning de scribed above can be passed from generation to generation.

[Waterland and Jirtle 2003] In the stu dy, scien tists looked at the effect of dietary supplemen ts on pregnant mice with the abnorma l" agouti" gene . Agouti mice have yellow coats and are extremely obese, which p redisposes them to cardiovascu lar d isease, d iabetes and cancer.

In the experiment, one group of yellow, obese, ago uti mo thers received methyl-group-rich supplements available in hea lth food stores: folic acid, vita min B12, betaine and choline. Meth yl-rich supplements were chosen because a number of stu d ies have shown that the methyl chemical gro up is involved with epigenetic modifica tions . When meth yl groups attach to a gene's DNA, it changes the binding characteristics of regu latory chro m osoma l proteins. If the protein s bind too tightly to the gene, the protein sleeve cannot be removed an d th e gene cannot be read . Methylatin g DNA can silence or mod ify gene activity .
This time the headlines "Diet Trumps Genes" were accurate.

The University's photo on the previous page is striking. Though the two mice are genetically identical. they are radically different in appearance: one mouse is lean and brown an d the other mo use is obese and yellow . What you can' t see in th e picture is that the obese mouse is diabetic while its genetica lly ide ntical counterpart is healthy.
Other stu dies have found epigenetic mechanisms to be a factor in a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In fact, only 5% of cancer and cardiovascular patients can attribute their disease to heredity. [Willett 2002] While the media made a big hoopla over the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes, they failed to emphasize tha t ninety-five percent of breas t cancers are not due to inherited genes. The malignancies in a significant number of cancer patients are derived from environmentallyind uced epigenetic alterations and not defective genes. [Kling 2003; Jones 2001; Seppa 2000; Baylin 1997]
The epigenetic evidence has become so compelling t hat some brave scientists are even invoking the "L" word for Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, the much-scorned evolutionist, who believed that traits acqu ired as a resul t of environmental influe nce could be passed on. Philosopher Eva [ablonk aand biologist Marion Lam b wrote in their 1995 book Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution - The Lamarckian Dimension: " In recent years, molecu lar biology has shown that the genome is far more fluid and responsive to the environment than previously supposed. It has also shown that informa tion can be transmitted to descendants in ways other than throu gh the base sequence of DNA." [Iablonka and Lamb 1995]
We're back to where we started in this chapter, the environment. In my own work in the laboratory, I saw over and over the im pact a changed environment had on the cells I was studying. But it was only at the end of my research career, at Stanford, that the message fully sank:in. I saw th at endothelial cells, which are the blood vessel-lining cells I was studying, changed their structure and function depending

on their environment. When, for exam ple, I added inflammatory chemica ls to the tissu e culture, the cells rapidly became the equivalent of macrophages, the scavenge rs of the immune sys tem. What was also exciting to me was that the cells transfo rmed even wh en I destroyed their DNA with gamma rays. These end othelial cells were"functionally enucleated," yet they complete ly changed their biological behav ior in response to inflammatory agents, just as they had when their nuclei were intact. These cells we re clearly showing some "intelligent" control in the absence of their genes. [Lipton 1991]
Twenty years after my mentor Irv Konigsberg's advice to first consider the environment when yo ur cells are ailing, I finally got it. DNA does not control biology and the nucleus itself is not the brain of the cell. Just like you and me, cells are shaped by w here they live. In other words, it's the env ironment, stu pid .

helix. The tru e secret of life lies in understandin g the elegantl y simple biological mechanis ms of the magical membrane - the mechanisms by which your body translates environmental signals into behavior .
When I started stu dying cell b iology in the 1960s, the idea that the membrane was the cell's brain would have been considered lau ghable. And I have to concede that the mem brane in those days w as a sorrylooking Mensa can dida te. The mem brane seemed to be just a simple, semi-pe rmea ble, thr ee-layered skin tha t held the contents of the cytoplasm together. Think Saran" wrap with holes.
One reaso n scientists misjudged the mem brane is that it is so thin. Membranes are only seven millionths of a millim eter thick. In fact, they are so thin that they can only be seen wi th an electr on microscope, w hich was developed after the Second World War. 50 it wasn't until the 1950s that b iologists could even confirm that cell mem bran es exist. Up until that time, many biologis ts thou ght the cell's cytop lasm held together because it had a [ello't-li ke consistency. With the aid of microscopes, biologists learned that all living cells have membranes an d that all cell membranes share the same, basic, three-layered str uctu re. However, the simplicity of that structure belies its functiona l complexity.
Cell biologists gained insight into the ama zing abilities of the cell membrane by stu dying the most primi tive organisms on this planet, the prokaryo tes. Prokaryotes, whi ch include bacteria an d other microbes, consist only of a cell membrane that envelops a dropl et of soupy cytoplasm. Though prokary otes represent life in its most primitive form, they have purpose. A bacterium does not bounce around in its world like a ball in a pinball machine. A bacterium carri es out th e basic physiologic processes of life like mo re complicated cells. A bacterium eats, digests, breathes, excretes was te ma tter and even exhibits "neurological" processing. They can sense where there is food and p ropel themselves to that spo t. Similar ly, they can recognize toxins and preda tors and purposely employ escape maneuvers to save their lives. In other words, prokaryo tes disp lay intelligence!

So what structu re in the prokaryoti c cell provides its "in telligence"? The prokary otes' cytoplasm has no evident organelles that are found in more ad van ced, eukaryotic cells, such as the nucleus an d mitochondria. The only organiz ed cellular structure that can be considered a candidate for the prokaryote's brain is its cell membrane.
As I came to the realization that membranes wer e characteristic of all intelligent life, J focused my attention on understanding their structure and function. J came up with a gastronomic treat Gust kidding) to illustrate the basic structure of the membrane. The treat consists of a bread and butter sandwich. To further refine the analogy, J added olives. Actually my instructive sandwich features two kinds of olives, ones stuffed with pimentos, the others pimen to-free. Gourmands, don't groa n . When I've left this sandwich out of my lectures, repeat members of the audience have asked me where it went!
Here's an easy expe riment to show you how the "sa ndwich" membrane works. Make a bread an d butter sandwich (at the moment free

As illustration below, the dye seeps thro ugh the brea d, but stops when it gets to the bu tter, becau se the oily subs tance in the middle of the sandwich provides an effective barrier.
Now let's make a brea d and bu tter san dwich wi th stuffed and un stuffed olives.
ow when we add the d ye to the bread and slice the sandwich, we see a different result. When the dye hits a pimento-stuffed olive, it stops as surely as it stopped when it hit b utter . But when the dye reaches an olive without a pim ento, the pitted olive provi des a channel thr ough which the dye can flow freely across the middle of the sandwic h, then thr ough the bread to the plate.
The plate in this analogy represents the cell's cytoplasm. By passing throu gh the p imento-free olive, the dye penetra tes the bu ttery layer to reach the other side of the " membrane" sand wich. The dye has successfully navigated the formidable, fatty, membrane barrier!
It is important for the cell to allow molecules to break throu gh the barrier becau se in my san dwich analogy, the dye is life-sustaining food. If the membrane were simp ly a bread and butter sandwich, it

would pro vid e a fortr ess-like barrier that keeps out the cacophony of innumerable molecular an d rad iant ene rgy signals that make up a cell's environment. But the cell would die if the memb rane were such a fortress, because it would get no nutrient s. When you add the pimento-free olives, whi ch allow information and food into the cell, the

mem bran e becom es a vital and ingenious mechanism enabling selected nutrients to penetrate the interior of the cell, just as the teaspoonfu l of dye mad e its way to the plat e.
In real-life cellular biology, the bread and butter portion of the sandwich represents the membrane's ph ospholipids, one of the two major chemical components of the membrane. (The other major chemical components are the "olive" pro teins, which we'll get to below.) I call phosp holipid s "schizophre nic" because they are composed of both po lar and non-polar mo lecules .
The fact that phospholipids contain both polar and non-polar m olecules may not soun d like a recipe for schizophre nia to you, but I assure you it is. All the molecules in our Universe can be divided into non-polar and po lar categories based on the type of chemical bonds that hold their atoms together. The bonds among polar molecules have positive an d /or negative charges, hence their polari ty. These molecules' positive an d negative charges cause them to behave like magnets, attracting or repellin g other charged molecules.
Polar molecules include wat er an d thin gs that d issolve in water. Non-polar molecules includ e oil an d substances that dissolve in oil; there are no positive or neg ative cha rges among their atoms. Remember the adage, wa ter and oil don't mix? Ne ither do oily n onpolar and watery polar molecules . To visualize the lack of interaction betw een polar an d non-polar molecules, think of your bottle of Italian salad dressing. You do your best to get vinega r an d oil to bond by shaking the bottle, but when you set the bottle down, they separate. That's because molecules, like peopl e, prefer environments that offer them stability. For their stability, polar (vinegar) molecules seek out watery polar environments and non-p olar (olive oil) molecules seek out no n-po lar env ironments. Phospholipid molecules, comprised of both polar and non-polar lipid regions, have a difficult time in seeking stability. The phosphate po rtion of the molecule is mo tivated to seek wa ter, while its lipid portion abhors water and seeks stability by dissolvin g in oil.

The lighter center of the membrane, the equivalent of the butter in our sandwich, re presents Ihe hydrophobic zone formed by the legs of the phospholipids. The dark layers above and below the centra l li pid zone, the equival ent of the bread slices, represents the molecule's water-loving phosphate heads .

Getting back to our san dwich, the membra ne's phospholipids are shaped like lollipops with an extra stick (see illustration above). The round part of the lollipop has polar charges amon g its atoms; it corre sponds to the bread of our sandwich. The molecule's two stick-like portions are non -polar; they correspond to the butter part of our san dwich. Because the "butter" portion of the membrane is non-polar, it does not let positively or negatively charged atoms or molecules pass thro ugh it. In effect. this lipid core is an electrical insulator, a terrific trait for a membrane designed to keep the cell from being overwhelmed by eve ry molecule in its enviro nme nt.
But the cell could not surv ive if the m emb rane were the equivalent of a simple bread an d butter san dw ich. Most of the cell's nutrients consist of charged polar molecules that wo uld not be able to get past the formidable non-polar lipid barrier. Neither could the cell excrete its polarized waste products.



T he B i o l o g y of Be l i e f
Integral Membrane Proteins
The olives in our sandwich are the truly ingeni ous part of the membrane . These proteins allow nutrients , was te materials, as well as other forms of "information" to be trans ported acro ss the me mbrane. The protein "olives" allow, not jus t any old molecul es to get into the cell, but only tho se molecules necessary for the smooth fun ctioning of the cytop lasm. In my sandwich, the olives represent Integral Membrane Proteins (IMPs). These proteins embed themselves into the "butter" layer of the membrane, just as I ha ve embedded olives in the illustration .
How do IMPs embed themselves into the butter? Remember that proteins are composed of a linear backbone assembled from linked amino acids. Of the twenty different amino acids, some are water-loving, polar molecules and some are hydrophobic, non-polar molecules. When a region of the protein's backbone is mad e up of linked, hydrophobic amino acids, this segment of the protein seeks stability by finding an oil-loving env ironme nt like the membrane's lipid core (see arrow below). That's ho w hydrophobic parts of the protein integra te themselves into the middle layer of the membrane. Because some regions of a protein's backbone are mad e up of polar amino acids and
82



83
other regions are non- polar, the pr otein strand will weave itself in and out of the bread and butter sandwich.
There are lots of IMPs with lots of different names, but they can be subdivide d into two functional classes: receptor proteins and effector proteins. Receptor IMPs are the cell's sense organs, the equivalent of our eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, etc. Recep tors function as molecular "nano-antennas" tuned to resp ond to specific env ironmental signals. Some receptors extend inward from the membrane sur face to monitor the internal milieu of the cell. Other recept or proteins extend from the cell's outer sur face, monitorin g external signals.
Like other proteins, which we discussed earlier, receptors ha ve an inactive an d an active sha pe and shift back and forth between those conforma tions as their electrical charges are altered. When a receptor protein bind s with an environmental signal, the resulting alteration in the protein's electrical charges causes the backbone to change shape and the protein ad opts an "active" conforma tion . Cells possess a uniquely " tun ed" receptor protein for every environmental signal that needs to read.
Some receptors resp ond to physical signals. One exam ple is an estrogen receptor, which is specially de signed to complement the shape and charge distribution of an estroge n molecule. When estrogen is in its recep tor's neighborhood, the estrogen receptor locks on to it, as surely as a ma gne t picks up paper clips. Once the estrogen receptor and the estroge n molecule bind in a perfect "lock and key" fit, the receptor' s electro magnetic charge changes and the protein shifts into its active conforma tion. Similarly, histamine receptors complement the shape of histamine molecules and insulin receptors complement the shape of insulin molecules, etc.
Receptor "antennas" can also read vibrationa l ene rgy fields such as light, sound and radio frequ encies. The an tennas on these "energy" receptors vibrate like tuning forks . If an energy vibration in the envi ronm ent resonates with a receptor' s antenna, it will alter the protein's charge, causing the receptor to chang e shape. [Tsong 1989] I'll cover this more com pletely in the next chapter, but I'd like to point out now
( HAPTER T HREE The M agical Me mbrane



T he B io log y of Be l ie f
that because receptors can read energy fields, the notion that only phys ical molecules can imp act cell physiology is outmode d. Biological behavio r can be controlled by invisible forces, including thou ght, as well as it can be controlled by physical molecu les like penicillin, a fact that provides the scientific underpinning for pharm aceutical-free, energy medicine.
Receptor proteins are remar kable, but on their own they do not impact the behav ior of the cell. While the receptor provides an awareness of environmental signals, the cell still has to engage in an appro priate, life-sustaining response, tha t is the venue of the effector proteins. Taken togeth er, the receptor-effector proteins are a stimulusresp onse mechanism comparable to the reflex action that doctors typically test during phys ical examinations. When a doc tor taps your knee with a mallet, a sensory nerve picks up the signal. That sensory nerve immediately passes on that informa tion to a motor nerve that causes the leg to kick. The membrane's receptors are the equivalent of sensory nerves, and the effector proteins are the equivalent of action-gene rating moto r nerves . Together, the receptor-effector complex acts as a switch, translating environmental signals into cellular beha vior.
It is only in recent years that scientists have realized the importance of the membrane's IMPs. They are in fact so imp ortant that studying the way IMPs work has become a field of its own called "signal trans duction." Signal transd uction scien tists are busily classifying hundre ds of complex information path ways that lie between the membra ne's reception of environmental signa ls and the activation of the cell's behavior proteins. The study of signal transduction is catap ulting the memb rane to center stage, just as the field of epigenetics is highlighting the ro le of the chro mosome's pro teins.
There are different kind s of behavior-controlling effector proteins becau se there are lots of jobs that need to be done for the smooth fun ctionin g of the cell. Transp ort pro teins, for example, include an extensive fami ly of channel pro teins that shuttle molecules and information from one side of the membran e barrier to the other. Which brings us back to the pimentos in our bread, butter and olive sandwich. Many
84



85
channel proteins are shaped like a tightly wound sphere, resembling the pimento-stuffed olives in our pictures. (See illustration page 79) When the electrical charge on the protein is altered, the protein chan ges shape, a change that creates an open channel running through the pro tein's core. Channel proteins are actua lly two olives in one, depending on their electrical charge . In the active mod e, their structure rese mbles a p imento-free olive, with an open ga te. In their inactive m ode the proteins' shape resembl es a pimento-stuffed olive that stays closed to the world ou tside the cell.
The activity of one specific channel type, sodi um-po tassium ATPase, merits special attention. Every cell has thousands of these channels built into the membrane. Collectively, their activity uses almost h alf of your body's energy every day. This channel opens and closes so frequently that it resembles a revolving door in a department store on the day of a big sale. Every time this channel revolves, it shu ttles three positive-charged sodium atoms out of the cytop lasm and simultan eously admits two p ositive-charged potassium atoms into the cytoplasm from the environment.
Sodium-po tassium ATPase not only uses up a lot of energy, it also creates energy as surely as store-bought batteries provide energy for Game Boys (at least until your kids wear them out). Actually, the energy-prod ucing activity of sodium-potassium ATPase is a lot better than the batteries your kids wear out because it turns the cell into a constantly recharging biological battery.
H ere's how sodium-potassium ATPase manages that trick. Every revolutio n of sodi um -potassium ATPase throw s more posi tive charges out than it lets in to the cell and there are thousands of these proteins in each cell. As these proteins go through hun dreds of cycles per second, the inside of the cell becomes negatively cha rged while the outside of the cell becomes positively charg ed. The negative charge below the membrane is referred to as the membrane potential. Of course the lipid, i.e. the bu tter portion of the memb rane, does not let ch arge d atoms cross the bar rier, so the internal charge stays negative. The positive charge outside the cell and the negative charge inside make the

The Bio log y of Be l i ef
cell essentially a self-charging battery whose energy is used to empower biological processes.
Another variety of effector pro teins, cytoskeJetal proteins, regulates the shape and motility of cells. A third variety, called enzy mes, breaks down or synthesizes molecules, which is why enzymes are sold in your local health food store as a digestive aid . When activated, all forms of effector proteins, including chan ne ls, cytoskeletal an d enzyme proteins or their byproducts, can also serve as signals that activa te genes. These IMPs or their byproducts provide signals that con trol the binding of the chro mosome's regul atory proteins tha t form a "sleeve" around the DNA. In contrast to conventional wisdo m, genes do not control their own activity. Instead it is the membrane's effector proteins, operatin g in response to environmen tal signals picked up by the membrane's receptors, which control the "read ing" of genes so that worn-o ut proteins can be replaced, or new proteins can be created.
How the Brain Works
Once I understood h ow IMPs worked, I had to conclude that the cell's operations are primarily molded by its interaction with the environment, not by its genetic code. There is no doubt that the DNA blueprints stored in the nucleus are remarkable molecules, which have been accumulated over three billion years of evolution. But as remarkable as these DNA blueprin ts are, they do not "control" the operations of the cell. Logically, genes cannot preprogram a cell or organis m's life, because cell survival depends on the ability to dynamically adjust to an eve r-changing environment.
The membrane's fun ction of interacting "intelligently" with the environment to p roduce beha vior makes it the true brain of the cell. Let's put the membrane to the same "brain" test to which we put the nucleus. When you des troy its mem brane, tlhe cell dies just as you would if your brain were removed . Even if you leave tlhe membran e intact, des troying only its receptor proteins, which can easily be done witlh digestive enzymes in tlhe lab, tlhe cell becom es "brain-dead." It is
86



87
comatose because it no longer receives the environmental signals necessary for the operation of the cell. The cell also becomes comatose when the membrane's receptor pro teins are left intact and its effector proteins are immobilized .
To exhibit "intelligent" behavior, cells need a functioning membrane wi th both receptor (awareness) and effector (action) proteins. These protein complexes are the fundamental units of cellular intelligence. Technically they may be referred to as uni ts of " perception." The definition of perception is: "awa reness of the elements of env ironment throu gh physical sensa tion." The first part of the definition describes the function of recep tor IMPs. The second part of the definition, the creation of a " physical sensation," sums up the role of th e effector proteins.
By examining these basic units of perception, we have engaged in an ultimate red uctionist exercise, taking the cell down to its fundamental nuts and bolts. In this regard it is imp ortant to no te that at an y given time there are up to h undreds of th ousands of such switches in a cell membrane. Conseq uen tly, the behavior of a cell carmot be determined by examining any individual sw itch. The behavior of a cell can only be understood. by considering the activities of all the switches at an y given time. That is a holistic - not red.uctionis t - approach, whi ch I'll elaborate on in the next chapter.
At the cellular level, the story of evolution is largely the story of maximiz ing the number of basic units of "intelligence," the membra ne's receptor/effector proteins. Cells became smarter by utilizing their outer membran e surface more efficiently and by expanding the surface area of their mem branes so that more IMPs could be packed in. In primi tive prokaryote organisms, the IMPs carry out all of its fund amental physiologic functions including digestion, respiration and excretion. Later in evolution, portions of the membrane that carry out these physio logic functions go inside, forming the membranous organelles that are characteristic of eukary otic cytoplasm. That leaves more m embrane surface area available to increase the number of perception IMPs. In addition, the eukaryote is thousands of times bigger
CHA PTER T HREE The Mag ical Membrane



T h e Bi o l o g y o f B e l i ef
than the prokaryote resul ting in a tremendous increase in membran e sur face area, i.e. a whole lot more room for IMPs. The end result i s more awareness, which translates to greater surv ivability .
Thro ugh evolu tion, the cell membrane's surface expande d, but there was a ph ysical limit to that expansion. There wa s a point at which the thin cell membrane was not strong enoug h to contain a larger mass of cytop lasm. Think w hat happens w hen you fill a balloon with wa ter. As long as the balloon is not overfilled, it is stro ng and can be passed around . However, if you exceed the balloon's wa ter capacity, the balloon ruptures easily, spilling its contents, just as a mem brane with too much cytoplasm would inevitably ru pture. When the cell membrane reached that critical size, the evolution of the individual cell reached its limit. That' s why for the first three billion years of evolution, single cells were the only organisms on this planet. That situation chan ged only when cells came up with another way to increase awareness. In order to get smarter, cells started banding together with other cells to form multicellular communi ties through which they could share their awareness, as I explained in Cha pter 1.
To review, the functions req uired for a single cell to stay alive are the sa me functi ons required by a community of cells to stay alive. But cells started to specialize when they form ed multicellular organisms . In multicellular comm uni ties, there is a division of labor. Tha t division of labor is evident in the tissues an d organs that carry out specialized functions . For examp le, in the single cell, respiration is carrie d out by the mitochondria. In a multicellular organis m, the mitochrondrial equivalent for respiration are the billions of specialized cells that form the lungs. Here's another exam ple: in the sing le cell, movement is created by the interaction of cytoplasmic pr oteins called actin an d myosin. In a multi cellular organism, communi ties of specialized mu scle cells handle the job of genera ting motility, each endowed with massive quantities of actin and myosin proteins.
I repeat this info rmation from the first chapter because I wan t to emphasize that while it is the job of the membrane in a single cell to be aware of the environment and set in motion an appropriate resp onse

to that environmen t, in our bodies those functions have been taken over by a specialized group of cells we call the nervou s sys tem.
Thou gh we've come a lon g way from unicellular organisms , I believe, as I've menti oned before, that stud ying single cells is an instructive wa y of studying complicated m ulticellular org anis ms . Even the most comple x human orga n, the brain, will reveal its secre ts more rea d ily when we know as much as we can abo u t the membrane, the cell's equivalen t of a brain .
CHAPTER T HREE The Magical Me m brane
As you 've learned in thi s chapter, scientis ts have recentl y mad e great progress towards unraveling the complexity of the simple-looking membrane. Bu t even twenty years ago, the rough outlines of the me mbrane's functions were kn own. In fact, it was twen ty years ago when I first rea lize d how u nderstan ding the workings of the membrane could be life changing. My eureka momen t resemb led the dynamics of super-satura ted solutions in chemis try . These solutions, which look like plain wa ter, are fully saturated with a dissolved substance. They are so saturated that just one more drop of the solu te causes a dramatic reaction in which all of the dissolved ma terials instantl y coalesce into a giant crys tal.
In 1985, I was living in a rented house on the spice-drenched Caribbean island of Grenada teaching at yet another "off-shore" medical schoo l. It was 2 A.M. and I was up revisiting years of notes on the biology, chemistry and physics of the cell membrane. At the time I was revi ew ing the mechanics of the membrane, trying to get a grasp of how it worked as an information processing system. That is w hen I experienced a moment of insigh t that transformed me, no t into a crystal, but into a membrane-centered biologis t w ho no longer had any excuses for messing up his life.
At that ear ly morning hour I was redefining my unders tanding of the structural organization of the membrane. Staring first with the lollipop-like phospholipid molecules and noting that they arranged in the membrane like regimented soldiers on parade in perfect align



T h e Biolog y o f B e l i e f
ment. By definition, a structure whose molecules are arranged in regular, repeated pattern is defined as a crys tal. There are two fundamental types of crystals. The crystals that most people are famili ar w ith are hard an d resilient min erals like diamo nds, rubies an d eve n salt. The second kind of crystal has a more fluid struc ture even thou gh its molecules maintain an organized pa ttern. Familiar exam ples of liquid crystals include digi tal wa tch faces and laptop computer screens.
To better und erstand the na tu re of a liquid crystal, let' s go back to those soldiers on parade. When the marching soldiers turn a corn er, they maintain their regimented structu re, even though they're moving individually. They're behaving like a flowing liq uid, yet they do no t lose their crystalline organization. The phospholipid molecules of the membrane behave in a similar fashion . Their fluid crystalline organization allows the membrane to dynamically alter its shape while maintaining its integri ty, a ne cessary property for a sup ple memb rane barrier . So in definin g this char acter of the membrane I wrote: "The membrane is a liquid crystal."
Then I star ted thinking about the fact that a membrane with just phospholipids woul d be sim ply a bread and butter sandwich withou t the olives. In the experiment described earlier, the colored d ye could not get through the lipid butter layer. That bread and butter sandw ich is a non-cond uctor. However, when you include the IMP "olives," you realize that the m embrane cond ucts some thin gs across while keeping other thin gs out. So I continued w ri ting my descrip tion of the membrane by adding : "The membrane is a semiconductor."
Lastly, I wanted to include in my description the two most common kinds of IMPs. These are the recepto rs an d a class of effectors called channels because they provid e the all-important means for the cell to let in nu trients and let out waste matter. I was abo ut to write that the mem brane contains " receptors and channels" when I realized that a synony m for receptor is the word gate. So instead I completed my description by writing: "The membrane contains gates and channels."
I sat back and reviewed my new description of the membrane: "TIre membrane is a liquid crusta! semiconductor with gates and channels."

What hit m e right away was the fact that r had recentl y heard or read the very same phrase, thou gh at the moment, [ didn't know where I had corne across it. One thing was for sure ; it was not in the context of biological science .
As I leaned back in my cha ir, my atte ntion was drawn to the cor

I had just bou ght this non-technical paperback gui de to how compu ters work from a Radio Shack ou tlet. I gra bbed the boo k and found in the introduction a definition of a computer chip tha t read: "A chip is a crystal semiconductor with gates and channels."
For the first second or two I was struck by the fact that the chip and cell membrane shared the same technical definiti on. I spen t several more intense seconds comparing and contrasting biomembranes with silicon semicond ucto rs. [ w as momen tarily stunned w hen [ realized that the identical n ature of their definitions was not a coincide nce. The cell membrane wa s ind eed a struc tural and fun ctional equivalen t (ho mo logue) of a silicon chip!
Twelve years later an Australian research consortium headed by B. A. Cornell published an article in Na ture, which confirme d my hypothesis that the cell membrane is a hom ologu e of a compu ter chip . [Cornell, et al, 1997] The researchers isolated a cell membran e and ~ttached a piece of gold foil under it. They then flood ed the space between the go ld foil and the a ttached me mbrane w ith a special electrolyte solutio n. When the membrane' s receptors we re stimula ted by a complementary signal, th e cha nnels op ened and allowed the electrolyte solution across the me mbrane. The foil served as a tra nsduce r, an electrical pickup d evice, which converted the electr ical activity of the channel into a digita l readout on a screen . Thi s device, created for the study, demonstrates that the cell membra ne no t only looks like a chip bu t also fun ctions like one. Corne ll and assoc iates successfu lly turned a biological cell m embrane into a digital-readou t comp uter chip.

So wh at's the big deal, you ask? The fact that the cell membrane and a computer chip are homologues means that it is both appropriate and instructive to better fathom the workings of the cell by compar ing it to a perso nal computer. The first big-deal insigh t that comes from such an exercise is that computers and cells are programmable. The second corollary insigh t is that the programmer lies outside the computer/ cell. Biological behavior and gene activity are dynamically linked to informa tion from the environment, which is downlo aded into the cell.
As I conjured up a biocomputer, I realiz ed that the nucleu s is simply a memory disk, a hard dri ve containin g the DNA programs that encode the production of proteins. Let's call it the Double Helix Memory Disk. In your home computer you can insert such a memory disk containin g a large number of specialized programs like word processing, graphics and spreads heets. After you download those progra ms into active memory, you can remove the disk from the computer witho ut interfering with the program that is running. When you remove the Double Helix Memory Disk by removing the nucle us, the work of the cellular protein machine goes on because the information that created the pro tein machine has already been downloaded. Enucleated cells get into troubl e only when they need the gene programs in the ejected Double Helix Memory Disk to replace old proteins or make different proteins.
I h ad been trained as a nu cleus-centered biologist as surely as Copernicus had been trained as an Earth-centered astronomer, so it was with a jolt tha t I realized that the gene-eontaining nucleus does not program the cell. Data is entered into the cell/computer via the membrane' s recept ors, which represent the cell's " key board ." Receptors trigger the membrane's effector proteins, whi ch act as the cell/ computer's "Ce ntral Pro cessing Unit" (CPU). The "CPU" effector proteins conv ert environmen tal information into the behavioral lan gu age of biology.
I realized in those ear ly morning hours that even thou gh biological thought is still preoccup ied with genetic determinism, leading edg e cell research, which continues to unfold the mystery of the Magical Membrane in ever more complex detail, tells a far different story.

At tha t moment of trans formation, I was frustrated because there. was no one with whom I could shar.e my excitement. I wa s alone out in the country. My house didn't have a telephone. Because I w as teaching at a medical school, I realized that there w ould undoubtedl y be some students study ing in the libr ary . I ha stily threw some clothes on and raced off to the school to tell someone, an yone, of this exciting new in sight.
Running into the library, out of breath, wild-eyed wi th my hair flying in all directions, I w as the epitome of the absen t-min ded professor. I spo tted one of my first-year medical stu den ts and ran up to him proclaiming, "You have to hear this! This is gr eat shit!" I remember in the back of m y mind how he pulled awa y from me, almost in fear of this raving, mad scientist who wildly broke the silence of the sleep y library . I immediately began to spew forth m y new un derstanding of the cell, usin g the complex, polysyllabic jar gon of a conven tional cell biologist. When I finish ed my exp lanation and was silent, I was waiting to hear his congratulations, or at least a "bravo," but nothing was for thcoming. He was now wide-eyed himself. All he cou ld say w as, "Are yo u OK, Dr. Lipton?"
1 wa s cru shed . The stu de n t had not understood a word I had said. In hindsight, I realized that as a first-semes ter medica l student, he did not have enough scientific background or vocabulary to make any sense out of my apparen t ran tings . How ever, the win d was knocked ou t of my sails. I held the key to the secret of life an d th ere was no one who could understand me! I confess I didn't have much better luck wi th most of m y colleagues who had been schoo led in polysyllabic jargon . So much for the Magical Membrane.
Over the years I gradually honed my presentation about the Magical Membrane and continued to refine it so tha t first-year medical stu de nts and lay people can u nd erstand it. I've also contin ued to up date it with the latest research. In so doing, I've found much m ore receptive aud iences among a wide range of medical personnel an d lay peo ple. I have also found audiences recep tive to the spiritual implications of my Eureka moment. Shifting to membrane-cen tered biology was exciting for me, but it wo uld n' t have been enough to send me

I'll get to the spiritual part of the story in the Ep ilogue . For the moment, let me reiterate the lessons of the magical me mb rane, which put the control of our lives no t in the genetic roll of the dice at conception, but in our own hands. We are the drivers of our own biology, just as I am the driver of this word processing program. We have th e ability to edit the data we en ter into our biocom puters, just as surely as I can choose the words I typ e. When we unders tand how IMPs control biology, we become ma sters of our fate, not victims of our genes.

hen I wa s an ambitious, un dergraduate biology major in the 1960s, I knew tha t to have a prayer of getting into a prestigious gradua te schoo l I needed to take a physics course. My college offered a basic intr oduc tory course, some thing like Physics 101, which covered fundamental topics like gravity, electromagnetism, acoustics, pulleys and incline planes in a way that was easily understood by non-physics majors. There was also ano ther course called Quantum Physics, but almos t all 01 my peers avoided it like the plagu e. Quantum physics was shrou ded in mystery - we biology majors were convinced that it was a very, very " weird" science. We thought only physics majors, masochists, and outright fools would risk five credits on a course whose premise was, "Now you see it. Now you don't."
In those days the only reason I would have been able to come up with for takin g a quantu m physics course was that it woul d have serv ed as a great pickup line at parties. In the days of Sonn y and Cher

it wo uld have been Ires chic to say, "Hey, babe, I'm into quantum ph ysics- wh at sign are you?" On the other hand , even that might not be tru e-I never saw quantum physicists at parties or, in fact, an ywhere else. I don' t think they got out much .
So I reviewed my transcripts, weighed the options, and took the easy way out by selecting Physics 101. I was intent on becomin g a biologist. I had no interest in having m y career aspirations dep end on some slide-ru le-slinging physicist singing the p raises of ephemeral bosons and quarks. I an d virtu ally every other biology major either gave little attention to, or completely ignored, quan tu m physics as we pursu ed our studies in the life sciences.
Uns urpri singly, given our atti tude, we biology majors didn 't know much abo ut physics, the one with all the equations an d mathematics. I knew abou t grav ity - heavy things tend to end up at the bottom an d light er thin gs on top. I knew something about light-plant pigments such as chloro phyll, and anima l visual pigments such as the rhodopsin in the retina, absorb some colors of light and are "blind" to others. I even knew a little about tem pera ture - high temp eratures inacti vate biological molecules by causing them to "melt" and low temperatu res freeze and preserve molecules. I am obviously exaggerating to stress the point that biologists traditi onally don't know mu ch physics.
My quantu m-physics-deprived backgroun d exp lains w hy, even
when I rejected nucleus-based biology and turned to the mem brane, r still didn't underst and the full implications of that shift. I knew that integral mem bran e proteins hook up with environmental signals to power the cell. But because I didn' t know an ything about the quan tum uni verse, I did not fully appreciate the nature of the env ironmental signals that start the process.
It wasn't until 1982, more than a decade after I had finished graduate school that I finally learn ed how much I had missed When I skip ped quan tum physics in college. I believe tha t had I been introd uced to the quantum world in college, I would have turned into a biology renegade much earlier. But on that day in 1982, I was sittin g

on the floor of a ware house in Berkeley, California, 1,500 miles from home, lamenting the fact that I ha d seriously compromised my scientific career on a failed attem pt to produce a rock 'n roll show. The crew and I were strande d - we had run ou t of mone y after six shows. I had no cash and whenever I offered my credit card, the merc hant's credit
ap prova l machine displayed a skull and cross -bo nes. We were living on coffee and donuts w hile we proceed ed through Elisabeth KUblerRoss's five stages of grieving, over the death of our show: d enial, anger, bargaining, d epression, and finally, acceptance, [Kubl er-Ross 1997]. But at that moment of accep tance, the silence in that d arkened concrete tomb of a warehouse was broken by the piercing, electronic screech of a telephone. Despite the. phone's incessant, obnoxious signal, the crew and I ign ored the caller. It wa sn't for us - no one knew where we we re.
Finally the manager of the warehouse retrieved the call and restored th e blessed silence . In the qu iet, still air, I heard the m anager respond, "Yes, he's here." I looked up at that mom ent, from the darkest depth of my life, and saw the phone being exten ded towar d me. It was the Caribbean-base d medical schoo l that had hired me two years earlier. The p resident of the school had spent two days tracking my erratic trail from Wisconsin to California so he could ask me if I would be interes ted in teaching Anatomy agai n.
Would I be interested ? Does a bear relieve himself in the woo ds? "How soon do you wan t me?" was my reply. He said, "Yesterd ay." I told him I wo uld love the job bu t needed an ad vance on my salary. The schoo l wired the m oney that same da y and I split the proceeds with my crew. I then flew back to Madison to prepare for an extended stay in the tropics. I bid farew ell to my daughters and has tily packed my clothes and a few ho usehold items . Within twenty-four hours I was back at O'Hare Airport waiting for Pan Am's Clipper Ship to the Garden of Eden.

physics, throu gh which I was de lighted to learn that scientists canno t un derstand the mysteries of the Universe using only linear thinking.
Listening to the Inner Voice
While I was waiting for the flight, I realized suddenly that I had nothing to read while strappe d into a seat for five hours. Moments before the gate was to close, I left the line and ran down the concourse to a bookstore. The task of selecting one book out of hundreds of choices, while simultaneously envisioning the possibility that my plane's doors would close an d leave m e behind, almost paralyzed me. In a state of confus ion, one book jumped out at me, The Cosmic Code: Quantum Physics As the Language of Nature by physicist Heinz R. Pagels. [pagels 1982] I quickly scanned the jacket and found that it was a quantum physics text wri tten for the la y audience. Stubbornly adhe ring to the quantum physics pho bia 1 had disp layed since college, I immediately put the book down and began to search for something lig h ter .
As the second hand on my mental stopwatch entered into the red zone, I picked up a self-proclaimed best seller and ran to the cashier. While the clerk was preparing to ring up the best seller, I looked up and saw an other copy of Pagels's book on the shelf behind the clerk. Midway through the checkout process, with time running out, I finally broke through my ave rsion to quantum p hysics an d asked the clerk to add a copy of The Cosmic Code.
After 1 boarded the plane, I calmed down from my adrenalized trip to the books tore, worked on a crossword p uzzle, and then finally se ttled down to read Pagels's book. I found myself burning thro ugh its pages, even though I had to continuously back up and read sections over again and again. I read through the flight, the three-hour layover in Miami, an d an addi tional five hours en route to my island paradise. Pagels was completely blowing me awa y!
Before boarding the plane in Chicago, I had no idea that quantum physics was in any way relevant to biology, the science of living organis ms. When th e plane arrived in Paradise, I was in a state of

CHA PTER F OUR The New Physics: Planting Both Feet Firmly on Thin Air
intellectual shoc k. I realized that quantum physics is relevant to biology and that biologists are committing a glaring, scientific err or by igno ring its law s. Physics, after all, is the foun da tion for all the sciences, ye t we biologists rely on th e ou tmoded, albeit tidi er, Newtonian version of how the world works. We stick to the ph ysical world of New ton and ign ore the invisible quan tum wo rld of Einstein, in which matter is actually ma de up of energy an d there are no absol utes. At the atomic level, matter does not even exist with certainty; it only exists as a tenden cy to exist. All my cer titudes about biology and physics were shattered!
In retrospect, it sho uld have been obvious to me an d to other biologists that New tonian physics, as elegant and reassuring as it is to hyper-ra tional scientists, cannot offer the who le truth about the human bod y, let alone the Universe. Medical science keeps adv ancing, but living organis ms stubbornly refuse to be quantified. Discovery after discovery about the mechanics of chemical signa ls, inclu ding hormones, cytokines (hormones that contro l the immune sys tem), growth factors and tumor suppresso rs, cann ot explain pa ranormal phenomena. Spontaneous healings, psychic phenomena, amazing feats of strength and endurance, the ability to walk across hot coals witho ut getting burned, acupuncture's ability to diminish pain by moving "chi" around the bod y, and many other paranormal phenomena defy Newtonian biology.
Of course, I considered none of that when I wa s on medical school faculties. My colleagues and I trained our studen ts to disregard the healin g claims attributed to acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, pra yer, etc. In fact, we went furth er. We de nounced these practices as the rhetoric of charlatans becau se we were tethered to a belief in old-style, Newtonian physics. The healin g mod alities I just mentioned are all based on the belief that energy fields are influe ntial in controlling our phys iology and our hea lth .

T he B iol og y o f Belie f
The Illusion of Matter
Once] fina lly grappled w ith quantum physi cs, I realized that when We so cavalierly clismissed those energy-based practices, we were acting as myopically as the chairman of the physics department at Harvard University, who, as des cribed in The Dancing Wu Li Masters
by Gary Zukav, warned students in 1893 that there was no need for new Ph.D .s in ph ysics. [Zukav 1979] He boasted that science had established that the Uni verse is a "matter machine" made up of physical, individual atom s that fully obey the law s of Newtonian mechanics. For physicists, the only w ork left was to refine its measurements.
Three short years later, the notion that the atom was the smallest particle in the universe fell by the wayside with the discovery that the atom itself is made up of even smaller, subatomic elements. Even more ear th-shattering than the discovery of those subatomic particles was the revelation that atoms emit various"strange energies" such as Xrays and radioactivity. At the tum of the twentieth cen tury, a new breed of physicist evolved whose mission was to probe the relationship between energy and the structure of matter. Within another ten year s, physicists abandoned their belief in a New tonian, materia] uni verse becau se they had come to reallze that the universe is not made of matter sus pe nde d in empty space but energy.
Quantum physicists discovered tha t physical atoms are made up of vortic es of energy that are constantly spinning and vibrating; each atom is like a w obbly spinning top that rad iates energy. Because each atom has its own specific energy signature (wobble), assemblies of atoms (m olecules) collectively radiate their own identifying energy patt erns. So every material structure in the universe, including you and me, radiates a unique energy signa tur e.
If it were theoretically possible to observe the composition of an actu al atom with a microscope, what w oul d we see? Imagine a swirling dust devil cu tting across the des ert' s floor . Now remove the sand and dirt from the funnel cloud. What you have left is an invisible, tornado-like vortex. A number of infinitesimally small, dust devil like energy vortices called quarks and photons collectively make up

the structu re of the atom . From far awa y, the atom wou ld likely appear as a blurry sphere. As its struc ture came nearer to focus, the atom would become less clear and less distinct. As the surface of the atom drew near, it would disappear. You would see nothing. In fact, as you focused through the entire structure of the atom, all you would observe is a physical void. The atom has no physical structur e - the emperor has no clothes !
Remember the atomic models you stu died in school, the ones with marbles and ball bearings going around like the solar system? Let's put that picture beside the " physical" structure of the atom discove red by quantum ph ysicists.
No, there has not been a printing mistake; atom s are made out of invis ible energy not tangible matter!
So in our world, material substance (matter) appears out of thin air . Kind of we ird, when you think about it. Here you are holding this physical book in your hands. Yet if you were to focus on the book's material substance with an atomic microscope, you would see that you are holdin g nothing. As it turns out, we undergraduate biology majors were right about one thing -the quantu m universe is mind-bend ing.
Let's look more closely at the " now you see it, now you don 't" nature of qu antum physics. Matter can simultaneously be defined as a

solid (par ticle) and as an irnmaterial force field (wav e). When scien tists study the p hys ical properties of a toms, such as mass and weigh t, they look and act like phys ical matter. H owever, when the same ato ms are described in terms of voltage potentials and wavelengths, th ey exhibit the qualities an d properties of energy (waves). [Hackermuller, et al, 2003; Chapman, et at 1995; Poo l"1995] The fact that energy and matter are one and the same is precisely what Eins tein recognized when he concl uded : E = mc2. Sim ply sta ted, this equa tion reveals: Energy (E) = Ma tter (m, ma ss) multip lied by the Spee d of Light (c) and then squared . Einstein revealed that we do not live in a universe with d iscrete, physical objects separated by dead space. The Universe is one indivisible, dynami c whole in which energy and matter are so dee ply en tangled it is impossible to consider them as ind ependen t elemen ts.
They Are Not Side-Effects . .. They're Effects!
The awareness tha t suc h profoun dly different mechani cs con trol the structu re and behavior of ma tter should have offered biome dicine new insights into understanding health and disease. Yet even after the d iscoveries of quantum phys ics, biologis ts and medical students continue to be trained to view the body only as a physical machine that operates in accordance with Newtonian pr incip les. In seeking knowledge of how the body's mec hanisms are "controlled," researchers have focused the ir attention on investiga ting a large variety of physical signals, classified int o discrete chemical families, inclu ding aforemention ed ho rmones , cytokines, growth factors, tu mor su ppressors, messengers and ions. However, beca use of their Ne w tonian, materialistic bias, conven tional researchers have completely ign ored the role that energy plays in health and disease.
In addition, conven tional biologists are reductionists who believe that mechanisms of our physical bodi es can be understood by taking the cells apar t and studying their chemical building blocks. They believe that the biochemical reaction s responsible for life are generated through Henry Ford -styled assembly lines: one chemical causes a

reaction, followed by another reaction with a different che mical, etc. The linear flow of information from A to B to C to 0 to E is illustrated on the following page.
This reductionist model sug gests that if there is a pro blem in the system, evident as a disease or dysfuncti on, the source of the problem can be attributed to a malfunction in one of the steps along the chemical asse mbly line. By providing the cell with a functional replacement part for the faulty element, by prescribing pharmaceutical drugs for exam ple, the defective single point can theoretically be repaired and heal th restored . This assumption spurs the pharmaceutical industry's search for ma gic-bullet drugs and designer genes .
However, the quantum perspective reveals that the uni verse is an integration of interdependent energy fields that are entang led in a meshwork of interactions. Biomedical scientists ha ve been particularly confounded because they do not recognize the massive complexity of the intercommunication among the physical parts an d the ener gy fields that make up the whole . The reductionist' s perception of a linear flow of information is a characteristic of the Newtonian universe.
In contras t, the flow of information in a quantum universe is holistic. Cellular constituents are woven into a complex web of crosstalk, feedback and feedforw ard comm unication loops (see illustration next page). A biological dysfunction may arise from a miscommunication along any of the routes of information flow . To adjus t the chemistry of this complicated interactive system requires a lot more understanding than just adjusting one of the information pathway's components with a drug. If you change the concentration of C for example, it doesn't just influe nce the action of D. Via holistic pathways, variations in the concentration of C profoundly influence the behaviors and functions of A, B, and E, as we ll as D.
Once I realized the nature of the complex interactions betw een matter an d energy, I knew that a red uctionist, linear (A>B>C>D>E) approach could not even come close to giving us an accurate understanding of disease. While quantum physics implied the existence of such interconnected information pathways, recen t ground breaking

Clearly, biological dysfunctions can result from miscommunication anywhere within these complex pathways. When you change the parameters of a protein at one point in such a complex pathway, you inevitabl y alter the parameters of other proteins at innumerable points within the entangled networks. In addition, take a look at the seve n circles in the next illustration that group proteins according to their physiologic functions .

The mapping of these information network pa thways underscores the dangers of prescription drugs. We can now see why pharmaceutical drugs come with informa tion sheets listing volumino us side effects that rang e from irr itatin g to dead ly. Wh en a dru g is introduced into the body to treat a malfunction in one protein, that drug inevitably interacts with at least one and possibly many other pro teins.
Comp licating the drug side-effect issue is also the fact that biological systems are red undant. The same signals or protein molecules

may be simultaneo usly used in different organs and tissues where they pro vide for compl etely different behavioral functions. For example, when a drug is prescribed to correct a dysfunction in a signaling pathway of the heart, that drug is delivered by the blood to the entire body. This "cardiac" med icine can unintentionally disturb the function of the nervous system if the brain also uses components of the targeted signaling pathway. While this redundancy complicates the effects of prescription drugs, it is another remarkably efficient result of evolution. Multicellular organisms can survive with far fewer genes than scientists once thought because the same gene pr oducts (protein) are used for a variety of functi ons. This is similar to using the twentysix letters of the alphabet to construc t every word in our language.
In my research on human blood vessel cells, I experienced firsthand the limits imposed by redundant signaling pathways. In the body, histamine is an important chemical signal that initiates the cells' stress resp onse. When histamine is present in the blood that nourishes the arms and legs, the stress signal produces large gaping pores in the walls of the blood vessels. The opening of these holes in the blood vessel's wall is the first step in laun ching a local inflammatory reaction. However, if histamine is added to blood vesse ls in the brain, the same histamine signal increases the flow of nutrition to the neurons, enhancing their growth and specialized functions. In times of stress, the increased nu trition signaled by histamine enables the brain to ramp up its activity in order to better deal with the perceived impending emergency. This is an example of how the same histamine signal can create two diametrically opp osed effects, depending on the site where the signal is released. [Lipton, et al, 19911
One of the most ingenious characteristics of the body' s sophisticated signaling system is its specificity. If you have a poison ivy rash on your ar m, the relentless itchiness results from the release of histamine, the signal molecule that activates an inflammatory response to the ivy's allergen. Since there is no need to start itching all over your body, the histamine is only released at the site of the rash . Similarly, when a person is confronted with a stressful life experience, the release of histamine wi thin the brain increases blood flow to the nervous tis

sues, enh ancing the neurological pro cessing required for survival. The release of histamine in the brain to deal with stress beha viors is restricted and does not lead to the initiation of inflammation responses in other parts of the body. Like the National Guard, histamine is deployed only where it is need ed and for as long as it is need ed .
But most of the medical industry' Sdrugs have no such specificity. When you take an antihistamine to deal with the itchiness of an allergic rash, the ingested drug is distributed systemically. It affects histamin e recep tors whereve r they are located throughout the whole body. Yes, the antihistamine will cur b the blood vessels' inflammatory response, dramatically reducing allergic symptoms. However, when the antihistamine enters the brain, it inad vertently alters neural circulation tha t then impacts nerve function. That's why peo ple who take over-the-cou nter antihistamines may experience allergy relief and also the side effect of feeling drowsy.
A recent example of tragic adverse reactions to dru g therapy is the debilitating and life-threatening side effects associated with syn thetic horm one replacement therapy (HRT). Estrogen's best-known influence is on the fun ction of the female reprod uctive sys tem. However, more recent stu dies on the distribution of estrogen receptors in the body reveal that they, and of course their complementary estrogen signal molecules, play an important ro le in the normal function of blood vessels, the heart and the brain. Doctors have routinely prescribed synthetic estrogen to alleviate menopausal sym ptoms associated with the shutting -down of a w oman's reprod uctive system . However, pharmaceu tical estrogen therap y does not focus the drug's effects on the intended target tissues. The drug also impacts an d distur bs the estrogen receptors of the heart, the blood vessels an d the nervous system. Synthetic h orm one replacement therapy has been sho wn to have disturbing side effects that result in cardi ovascular disease and neural dysfunctions such as strokes. [Shumaker, et at 2003; WassertheilSme ller, et al, 2003; Anderson, et at 2003; Cauley, et al, 2003]
Adverse drug effects, like those contributing to the HRT controversy, are a primary reason why a leading cause of death is iatrogeni c

illness, i.e. illness resulting from medical treatment. According to conserva tive estimates published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, iatrogenic illness is the third -leading cause of death in this country . More than 120,000 peop le die from adverse effects of prescribed med ications each year. [Starfield 2000] However, last year a new stu dy, based on the resul ts of a ten-year survey of government statistics, carne up with even more dismal figures. [Null , et al, 2003] That study concludes that iatrogenic illness is actual ly the leading cause of death in the Uni ted States and that ad verse reactions to prescrip tion drugs are resp onsible for more than 300,000 deaths a year .
These are dismaying statistics, especially for a healing profession that has arrogan tly dismissed three thousan d years of effective Eastern medicine as un scientific, even thou gh it is based on a deeper understanding of the Universe. For thousands of years, long before Western scientists discovered the laws of quan tum physics, Asians have honored energy as the pr incipal factor contributing to health and wellbeing . In Eastern medicine, the bod y is defined by an elaborate array of energy pathways called meridians . In Chinese ph ysiologic charts of the human bod y, these energy networks resemb le electronic wiring dia grams . Using aids like acup un cture. need les, Chinese physicians test their pati ent' s energy circui ts in exactly the same manner that electrical engineers " troubleshoot" a prin ted-circuit board , searchi ng for electrical "pa thologies."
Physicians : T he Pha rmaceutical Pats ies
But as admiring as I am of the ancient wisdom of Eastern medicine, I do n ot wan t to bash Western doctors who prescribe massive quan tities of drugs that contribute to the health profession's lethality. Med ical doctors are caug ht between an intellectual rock and a corp orate hard place; they are pawns in the hu ge medical ind ustrial complex. Their healing abilities are hobbled by an archaic med ical ed uca tion fou nded on a Newtonian, matter -only Uni verse. Unfortun ately, that philosophy wen t out of vogue seventy-five years ago, when ph ysicists officially ado pted qu antum mechanics an d recognized that the Universe is actu ally made ou t of energy.

In their postgrad uate years, those same doctors receive their continuing education about pharmaceuti cal products from drug reps, the errand boys of the corporate healthcare industry. Essentially, these non-professionals, whose primary goal is to sell pro du ct, provide doctors with "information" about the efficacy of new dru gs. Dru g com panies freely offer this "ed ucation" so they can persuad e doctors to "push" their prod ucts. It is evident tha t the massive quantities of dru gs prescribed in this country violate the Hippocratic oat h taken by all doctors to "First do no harm." We have been programmed by ph armaceutical corp orations to become a nation of prescription drug-pop pin g junkies with tragic resu lts. We need to step back and incorporate the discoveries of quantum physics into biomedicine so that we can create a ne w, safer sys tem of medicine that is attuned to the laws of Nature.
Physics and Medicine:
A Day Late and a Dollar Short
The physical sciences have already embraced quantum physics with sensational results. Humani ty's wak e-up call to the reality of a quantum uni verse occurre d on August 6, 1945. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshim a that day demonstr ated the awesome powe r of applied qu an tum theory and dramatically ushered in the Atomic Age. On a more cons tructive note, quantum physics mad e possible the electronic miracles that are the foundation of the Information Age. The application of quantum mechanics was directly responsibl e for the development of TVs, computers, CAT scans, lasers, rocket ships an d cell phones.
But what great and marvelous ad van ces in biomedical sciences can we attribute to the qu antum revolution? Let' s list them in order of their irnportance:
It is a very shor t list - there haven't been any.

Ne wton. The newer laws of quantum mechanics do not negate the results of classical physics. The planets are still moving in paths that were predicted by Newt on's mathematics. The difference between the two physics is that quantum mechanics more specifically applies to molecular and atomic realms while New tonian laws apply to higher levels of organization, such as organ systems, people or populations of people . The m anifestation of a disease, such as cancer, may sho w up at a macro level when you can see and feel a tumor . However, the pro cesses that instigated the cancer wer e initiated at the molecular level within the affected progenitor cells. In fact, most biological dy sfun ctions (except injuries due to ph ysical trauma) start at the level of a cell's molecules and ions . Hence the need for a biology that integrates both qu antum and Newtonian mechanics.
There have, thankfully, been some visionary biologists who ha ve ad vocated this integration. More than forty years ago the renowned Nobe l Prize-winning physiologist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi published a book called Introduction to a Submolecuiar Biology. [Szent-Gyorgyi 1960] His text was a noble effort to ed ucate the comm unity of life scientists about the importance of quantum physics in biological sys tems. Unfortu nately, his traditi onal peers, who considered the book to be the ravings of a once brilliant but now senile old man, merely lamented the "loss" of their former colleague.
Biologists in the main have still not recognized the importance of Szent-Cyorgyi's book, but research suggests that soo ner or later they will have to because the weigh t of scientific evidence is toppling the old materiali st paradigm. You recall the movements of protein molecules that are the stuff of life? Scientists have tried to predict those movements using the principles of Newtonian physics, to no avail. By now , I bet you can guess why: in 2000, an article by V. Pophristic and L. Good man in the journal N ature revealed that the laws of qu antum physics, not Newtonian laws, control a molecule's life-generatin g movements. [Pophristic and Goodman 2001]
Reviewin g this ground-breaking stu dy for Nature, biophysicist F. Weinhol d concluded: "When will chemistry textbooks begin to serve

as aids, rather than barriers, to this enriched qu antum-mechanic perspective on how molecular turnstiles wo rk?" He further emphasized: "What are the forces that control the tw isting and folding of molecules in to comp lex shapes? Don' t look for the answers in yo ur organic chemistry textbook." [Weinhold 2001) Yet organic chemistry prov ides the mechanistic foundation for biomed icine; and as Weinhold notes, that branch of science is so far out of date that its textbooks have yet to recognize quantum mechanics. Conve ntional medical researchers have no un derstanding of the molecular mechanisms that truly p rovide for liie.
Hundreds upon hundreds of other scientific studies over the last fifty years have consisten tly revealed tha t "invisib le forces" of the electromagnetic spectrum pro foundly impact every facet of biological regulation. These energies include microw aves, radio frequencies, the visible light spectrum, extreme ly low frequencies, acoustic frequencies and even a newly recognized form of force known as scalar energy . Specific frequ encies and patterns of electro magnetic radia tion regulate DNA, RNA an d protein syntheses, alter protein shape and function, and control gene regulation, cell div ision, cell differentiati on, morphogenes is (the pro cess by whi ch cells assemble into organs and tissue s), horm one secretion, nerve growth and function . Each one of these cellular activities is a fundamental behavior that contributes to the unfolding of life. Though these research studies have been published in some of the most respected mainstream biomedical journals, their revolutionary findings have not been incorporated into the medical scho ol curric ulum. [Liboff 2004; Goodman and Blank 2002; Sivitz 2000; [ in, et al, 2000; Blackman, et al, 1993; Rosen 1992, Blank 1992; Tsong 1989; Yen-Patton, et al, 1988)
An im portant study forty years ago by Oxford University biophysicist C. W. F. McClare calculated and compared the efficiency of information transfer between ene rgy signals an d chemical signals in biological systems.

mation than physical signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, etc. [McO are 1974]
It is not surprising that energetic signals are so much more efficient. In physical molecules, the information that can be carr ied is directly linked to a molecule's available energy. However, the chemical coupling employed to transfer their information is accompanied by a massive loss of energy due to the heat generated in making and breaking chemical bonds. Becau se thermo-chemical coupling wastes most of the molecule's energy, the small amount of energy that remains limits the amount of information that can be carried as the signal.
We know that living organisms must receive and interpret environmental signals in order to stay alive. In fact, sur vival is directl y related to the speed and efficiency of signal transfer. The speed of electrom agnetic energy signals is 186,000 miles per second , while the speed of a diffusibl e chemical is considerably less than 1 centimeter per second. Energy signals are 100 times more efficient and infini tely faster than physical chemical signaling. What kind of signaling would your trillion-celled community prefer? Do the math!
Buying the Pharm
I believe the major reason w hy energy research has been all but ignored comes down to dollars and cents. The trillion dollar pharmaceu tical industry puts its research money into the search for magic bullets in the form of chemicals because pills mean money. If energy healing could be made into tablet form, drug manufacturers would get interested quickly.
Instead, they identify deviations in physiolo gy and beh avior that vary from some hypothetical no rm as unique dis orders or dysfunctions, and then the y educ ate the public about the dan gers of these menacing disorders. Of course, the over -simplified symptomology used in defining the dysfunctions prevalent in drug company advertisements has viewe rs convinc ed they are afflicted by that particular malady.

Mean whil e, the media essentially avoids the issue of deaths by medicine by directing our attention to the dangers of illicit d rugs . They admonish us that using drugs to escape life's pr oblems is no t the way to reso lve one's issu e. Funny ...! was just going to use that exact sentence to describe my concerns abou t the overu se of legal drugs. Are they dangerous? Ask the people who died last year. Using prescription drugs to silence a body's symptoms enables us to ign ore persona l involvement we may have with the onse t of those symptoms . The overuse of prescripti on drugs pro vides a vacation from personal responsibility.
Ou r dru g mania reminds me of a job at an auto dealership I held while in grad uate schoo l. At 4:30 on a Frid ay afternoo n, an irate woman came into the shop. Her car's "service eng ine light" was flashing, even though her car had already been repaired for that same problem several times. At 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, who wants to work on a balky problem and deal with a furi ous custom er? Everyone wa s quiet, excep t for one mechanic who said : "I' Il take care of it." He dro ve the car back into the bay, got in behind the dashboard , removed the bulb from the sign al light an d threw it away. Then he opened a can of soda and lit a cigarette. After a suitable time, d uring which the customer tho ught he was actuall y fixing the car, the mechani c returned and told the woman her car wa s read y. Thrilled to see that the warning light had stopped flashing, she hap pily drove off into the sunset. Though the cause of the pro blem was still present, the symp tom was gone. Similarly, pharmaceutical dru gs sup press the body's sym ptoms, but, most never address the cause of the problem.
Wait, you say, "Times ha ve chang ed." We are now mo re ed ucated to the dangers of drugs and more open to alternati ve therapies.

embraced nonin vasive scanning techn ologies, which read such energy fields. Qu antum physicists have created ene rgy-scanni ng devices that can anal yze the frequencies emitted by specific chem icals. These scanning systems enable scientists to identify the molecular composition of materials and objects. Physicists have ada pted these devices to read the energy spectra emitted by our body's tissues and organs. Because energy fields travel easily through the physical body, these mod em devices, such as CAT scans, MRls and positron em ission tomography (PET) scans, can detect disease non -invasively. Physicians are able to diagnose internal problems by differentiating the spectral energy character of healthy and diseased tissue in the scanned images.
The energy scan illustrated on the page to the left reveals the p resence of breast cancer. The diseased tissue emits its own unique energy signature, which differs from the energy emitted by surrounding healthy cells. The energy signa tures that pass through our bodies travel through space as invisible waves that resemble ripples on a pond. If you drop a pebble into a pond , the "ene rgy" carried in the fallin g pebble (d ue to the force of grav ity pulling on its mass) is transntitted to the water. The ripples generated by the pebble are actually energy wa ves passing through the wa ter.
If more than one pebble is thrown into the water at the sam e time, the spread ing ripples (energy waves) f rom each SOUTce can interfere with each othe r, formin g com posite waves where two or more ripples conve rge. That interference can be either cons tructive (energy -amp lifying) or destructive (energy -deflating).

Constructive Interference . In 1 above, two sets of ri pples are moving across the surface of water toward each other. Asillustrated, both wove A and B are moving toward each other with the ir ripple s in pha se, in this case both waves are leading w ith the ir negative amplitude. Their cycle patterns are aligned. The waves merge together at the Interfa ce where two ripples meet. To illustrate the consequence of this merger, the waves are drown with one above the other In figure 2. Where the amptitude of A Is + 1, the amplitude of B isalso + 1. Add the two together, and the resulting amplitude of the composlte wcve at that point is +2. likewise, whereAls -I so Is B, together the total amplitude will be -2. The re sulting higher amplitude composite wave is ill ustrated in 3 .

Dropping two pebbles of the same size, from the same height, and at exactly the same time, coordinates the wave action of their ripples. The ripples from each pebble converge on each other. Where the ripples overlap, the combined power of the interacting waves is doubled, a phenomenon referred to as cons tructive interference, or harmonicresonance. When the dropping of the pebbles is not coord inated, their energy waves are out of sync. As one wave is going up, the other is going down . At the point of convergence these out of sync energy waves cance l each other. Instead of a doubling of the energy where the ripples interfere with each other, the water is calm ...there is no energy wave. This phenomenon of cance ling energy waves is called destructive interference.

In the illustration , Wave A Is leading with a negative amplitude and Wave B Is leading with a positive amplitude .

The beha vior of energy waves is imp ortant for biomedicine becau se vibrational frequencies can alter the physical and chemical properties of an atom as sure ly as physical signals like histamine an d estrogen. Becau se atoms are in constant motion, which you can measur e by their vibration, they create wa ve pa tterns similar to the expanding rip ples from the thrown pebbles we talked about above. Each atom is uni que because the distribution of its negative and positive charges, coup led wi th its spin rate, generates a specific vibration or frequency pattern. [Oschman 2000]
Scientists have devised a way to stop an atom dead in its tracks by exploiting its energy waves. They first identify the frequency of a spe

cific atom and then tune a laser to emit the same frequ ency. Though the atom and the photoelectric frequ ency emit the same wav e pa ttern, the laser's waves are designed to be au t of sync with those of the atom. When the light wave interacts with the atom's wa ve, the resulting destructive interfere nce cancels the atom's vibrations and it stops spinning. [Chu 2002; Rumbles 2001]
When you want to enhance rather than stop atoms, you find vibra tions that create harmonic resonance. Those vibra tions can be of electromagnetic or acoust ic origin. When, for example, a skilled vocalist like Ella Fitzgerald maintains a note that is harm onically resonant with the atoms of a crys tal goblet, the goblet's atoms absorb her sound waves. Through the mechanics of cons tructive interference , the ad ded energy of resonant so und wa ves causes the goblet's atom s to vibrate faster. Eventuall y the atoms absorb so much energy that they vibrate fast enough to break free from the bonds that hold them together. When tha t happens, the goblet actu ally explodes.
Doctors use constructive interference mechanics to treat kidney stones, a rare case where the laws of quantum physics have been harnessed as a therapeutic tool in mod em medicine. Kidney stones are crystals wh ose atoms vibra te at a specific frequency. Doctors non-inv asively focus a harmonic frequency on the kidney stone. Constructive interference resu lts whe n the focused energy waves interact with the atoms in the kidney stones. Like the atoms in the crystal goblet example above, the atoms of the kidney stones vibrate so quickly that the stones explode and dissolve. The small, remaining fragments can then be easily passed from the system without the excruciating pain that accompanies large, un exploded stones.
The science of physics implies that the same harmonic resonance mechanism, by which soun d wa ves destroy a goblet or a kid ney stone, can enable similar energy harmonics to influence the functions of our body's chemistry. But biologists have not explored these mechanisms with the passion wit h which they pursue new drugs. That is unf ortunate, becau se there is enoug h scientific evidence to suspect tha t we can

tailor a waveform as a therapeutic agent in much the same way as we now modulate chemical structures with drugs.
There wa s a time. in medicine when electrotherapy was used extensivel y. At the end of the nineteenth century, the development of batteries and oth er devices that produce electromagnetic fields led to hastily constr ucted machines that were supposed to cure disease. The public sought out practitioners of this new-fangled healing art called radioes thesia. Word spread that these de vices were very effective. In fact, they becam e so popular that magazines were likely to tout ads that read something like, " Be a Rad ioesthesiast! Onl y $9.99- inclu des instructions!" By 1894, over 10,000 U.S. physicians as well as an untold number of self-trained horne consumers were regularly usin g electr othe r a py .
In 1895, D.o. Palmer created the science of Chiro practic. Palmer recognized that the flow of energy throu gh the nervous system is critical to health. He focused on the mechanics of the vertebral column, the conduit throu gh which spinal nerves provide inform ation to the body. He developed skills to assess and tune the flow of information by adju sting the backbone's tensions an d pressures .
The medical profession becam e threatened by Palmer' s chiropractors, as well as homeopathic healers, radioesthesiasts and other drugless practitioners who were taking awa y much of their bus iness. The Carnegie Foundation publish ed the Flexner Report in 1910 that called for all med ical prac tices to be based on proven science. Because p hysicists had not yet discovered the quantum universe, energy medicine wa s incompre hensible to science. Den ounced by the American Med ical Association, chiropractic and other energy-based mod alities fell into disrepute. Radioesthesiasts disappeared completely.
In the last forty years, chiropractic has made great inr oads in the healing arts. In 1990, chiro practors won a lengthy cour t battl e against the medical monopoly when the American Medical Association was foun d guilty of illegal attempts to destroy the profession. Since then, chiropractic has spread its sphere of influ ence - it is even accepted in som e hospitals. And despite electrotherapy's checkered past, neuro

scientists are conducting excitin g new research in the area of vibrational energy therapies.
The brain has long been recognized to be an electrical organ, which is why electroshock therapy has historically been used to treat depression. But scientists are now working on less invasive tools to treat the
electric brain. A recent article in Science touted the beneficial effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which stimulates the brain with magnetic fields . [Helmuth 2001; Hallet 2000] TMS is an updated version of the.same 19th century radioesthesia healing techniques that w ere on ce denounced by conventional medicine. New studies suggest that TMS can be a powerful therapeutic tool. If used properly, it can ease depression and alter cogni tion.
It is clear we need interdisciplinary research in this promising and understudied area, research that encom passes quantum physics, electrical engineering, chemi stry, as well as biology. Such research will be particularly we lcomed because it is likely to result in therapies with far fewer side effects than drugs. But the research will onl y confirm what scientists and non-scientists already "know" but may notrealize they kno w: all organisms, including humans, communi cate and read their en vironment by evalua ting energy fields . Because humans are so dep endent on spoken and written language, we have neglected our ene rgy sensing commu nication system. As with an y biological fun ction, a lack of use leads to atrophy. Interestingly, aborigines stil1.utilize this hyper-sensory capacity in their daily lives. For them there has been no "sensory" atrophy . For example, Au stralian aborigines can sense wa ter buried deep beneath the sand and Amazonian shamans communicate with the energies of their medicinal plants.

That is the equivalent of heating a hou se in the dead of winter w hile leaving the d oors and wind ows op en. I started closing those doors and windows by carefully examining where I was was ting my energy. It was easy for me to close some of them . For example, it was easy to get rid of energy-draini ng activities like those deadly faculty parti es. It was harder to get rid of the energy-draining defeati st th.inking in which I habitually engaged. Thoughts cons ume energy as surely as does marathon ru nning, as we' ll see in the next chapter.

n 1952 a young British physician mad e a mistake. It was a mistake that was to bring short-lived scien tific glory to Dr. Albert Mason. Mason tried to treat a fifteen -year-old boy's w arts using hypnosis. Mason and oth er do ctors had successfully used hypnosis to get rid of warts, but this w as an especially tough case . The boy's leathery skin looked more like an elep han t's hide than a human's, except for his ches t, which had normal skin .
Mason's first hypnosis session focu sed on one arm. When the boy was in a hypnotic trance, Mason told him th at the skin on that arm would heal and turn into healthy, pink skin. When the boy came back a week later, Mas on was gratified to see that the arm looked healthy. But when Mason brought the boy to the referring surgeon, who had unsuc cessfully tried to help the boy with skin grafts, he leamed that he had made a medical err or. The surgeon's eyes were wide with astonishmen t when he saw the boy's arm. It was then that he told Mason that the boy wa s suffering, not from war ts, but from a lethal genetic
123



Th e B i ol o g y o f Bel i e f
disease called conge nital ichthyo sis. By reversing the symp toms using "only" the power of the mind, Mason and the boy had accomplished what had until that time been considered im possible. Mason continued the hyp nosis sess ions, with the stu nning result that most of the boy's skin came to look like the healthy, pink arm after the first hypnosis session. The boy, who had been mercilessly teased in school because of his grotesque-looking skin, went on to lead a normal life.
When Mason wro te about his startling treatment for ichthyosis in the British Medical Journal in 1952, his article created a sensation. [Mason 1952] Mason was touted in the media and became a magnet for patients suffering from the rare, lethal disease that no one before had ever cured . But hypnosis was in the end not a cure-all. Mason tried it on a num ber of other ichthyosis patients, bu t he was never able to replicate the resu lts he had had with the young boy. Mason attributes his failure to his own belief about the treatment. When Mason treated the new pa tients he couldn't replicate his cocky attitu de as a young physician thinking he wa s treating a bad case of war ts. After that first patient, Mason wa s fully aware that he was treatin g w hat everyone in the med ical establi shment knew to be a congenital, "incurable" disease. Mason tried to pretend that he wa s upbeat abou t the progn osis, but he told the Discovery Health Channel, "1 was acting." [Discovery Health Channel 2003]
How is it possible that the mind can override genetic programming, as it did in the case abo ve? And how could Mason's belief about that treatment affect its ou tcome? The New Biology suggests some answers to th ose questions. We saw in the last chapter that matter an d ene rgy are entang led. The logical corollary is that the mind (energy) and body (ma tter) are similar ly bound , thou gh Western medicine has tried valiantly to separate them for hundred s of years .
In the seven teenth century, Rene Descar tes dismissed the idea that the mind influences the physical character of the bod y. Descartes' notion wa s that the physical body was made out of matter and the mind was mad e out of an unidentified, but clearly imm aterial sub stance. Becau se he couldn' t identify the nalur e of the min d, Descartes
124

left behind an irresolvable philosophical conund rum: since only matter can affect matter, how can an imm aterial mind be "connected" to a material body? The non-physical mind envis ioned by Descartes was popularly defined as the "Ghost in the Machine" by Gilbert Ryle fifty years ago in his book The Concept of Mind. [Ryle 1949] Traditional biomedicine, whose science is based on a Newtonian matter-only universe, embraced Descartes' sep aration of mind and body. Medically speaking, it would be far easier to fix a mechanical body without ha ving to deal with its meddling "gho st."
The reality of a qu antum uni verse reconnects wh at Descartes took apa rt. Yes, the mind (energy) arises from the physical body, just as Descartes thought. How ever, our new unde rs tan ding of the Universe's mechanics shows us how the physical body can be affected by the immaterial mind. Tho ughts, the mind's energy, direc tly influence how the physical brain controls the bod y's phys iology. Thou ght "energy" can activate or inhibit the cell's function-prod ucing proteins via the mechanics of construc tive and destructive inter ference, described in the previous chapter. That is why, when I took the first step toward changing my life, I actively monitored wh ere I was expending my brain's energy . I had to examine the consequences of energy I invested in my thoughts as closely as I examin ed the expenditure s of energy I used to power my physical bod y.
Despite the discoveries of quantum ph ysics, the mind-body split in Western medicine still pre vails. Scientists have been trained to dismiss cases like the boy above who used his mind to heal a gene tically "mandated" disea se, as quirky anomalies. I believe, on the contrary, tha t scien tists sho uld embrace the stud y of these anomalies. Buried in exceptional cases are the roots of a more powerful un derstanding of the nature of life - "more powerful" because the principles behind these exceptions trump established " tru ths." The fact is that harnessing the power of your mind can be more effective than the drugs you have been pro grammed to believe you need. The research I discussed in the last cha pter found that energy is a more efficient means of affecting matter than chemicals.

Unfo rtunately, scientists most often deny rather than embrace exceptions. My favorite examp le of scien tific denia l of the reality of mind -bod y interactions relates to an ar ticle that ap peared in Science about nineteen th-centu ry Germa n ph ysician, Rober t Koch, who along w ith Pasteur founded the Germ Theory . The Germ Theory holds that

When Pos itive Thinking Goes Bad
( HAPTEn F IVE Bio log y and Belief
Before I go on to discuss the incredi ble power of our minds and how my research on cells pro vided insight in to how the bod y's mindbody pa thways work, I need to make it very clear that I do not believe that simply thinking positive thou gh ts always leads to physical cures. You need more than just "positive thinking" to harness control of your body and you r life. It is important for our health and well-being to shift our mind's energy towa rd positive, life-generating thou gh ts and eliminate ever-present, energy-draining and debilitating negative thoughts. But, and I mean that in the biggest sense of "BUT," the mere thinking of positive thoughts will not necessarily have any impact on our lives at all! In fact, sometimes people who " flunk" positive thinking become more debilitated because now they think their situa tion is hopeless they believe they have exhaus ted all mind and body remedies.
Wha t those positi ve-thinking drop ou ts haven't understood is that the seemingly "separate" subdivisions of the mind, the c011scious and the subco11scious are interde pendent. The conscious mind is the creative one, the on e that can conjure up "positive thou ghts." In contrast, the subconsciou s mind is a repo sitory of stimulus -response tapes derived from instincts and leamed experiences. The subconscious mind is strictly habitu al; it will play the same behavioral responses to life's signals over and over again, mu ch to our cha grin.

Mind Over Body
Let's review what we know abou t celJs. We learned in earlier chapters that the fun ctions of cells are directly derived from the movements of their pro tein "gears ." The movement genera ted by assemblies of protein s provides the physiologic functions tha t enable life. While proteins are the ph ysical b uilding blocks, compl ementary environmental signa ls are required to animate their movement. The interface between envi ro nmen tal signa ls an d behavior-produ cing cytoplasmic proteins is the cell's membrane. The membrane receives stimuli and then engages the appropriate, life-sustainin g cellular resp onses. The cell memb rane ope rates as the cell's " brain." Integral memb rane receptoreffector pro teins (IMPs) are the fundamenta l physical sub uni ts of the cellu lar brain's "intelligence" mechanism. By functional definition, these pro tein complexes are " perception swi tches" that link reception of environmen tal stimu li to response-generating pro tein pa thways.

Cells gen erally respond to a an assortment of very basic "pe rceptions" of wha t's going on in their world. Such percepti ons include whe ther thin gs like potassium, calcium, oxygen, glucose, histamine, estrogen, toxins, light or any number of other stimuli are present in their immediate environment. The sim ultaneo us interactions of tens of thou sands of reflexive perception switches in the memb rane, each directly reading an individual environmental signal, collectively create the complex behavior of a living cell.
For the first three billion years of life Or> this plan et, the biosphere consisted of free-living single cells such as bacteria, algae and protozoans. While we have traditionally considered such life forms as solitary individ uals, we are now aware that signal molecules used by individual cells to regula te their ow n physiologic functions, when released into the environm ent, also influence the behavior of other organisms . Signa ls released into the enviro nmen t allow for a coord ination of beha vior among a disp ersed population of unicellular organisms . Secreting signal molecules into the env ironmen t enh anced the surv ival of sing le cells by providing them with the opportunity to live as a primitive "comm uni ty."
The single-celled slime mold amoe bas provide an exam ple of how signaling molecules lead to community. These amoebas live a solitary existence in the soil fora ging for food. When available food in the environm ent is consumed, the cells synthesize an excess amount of a metabolic byprod uct called cyclic-AMP (cAMP), much of which is released into the env ironment. The concentra tion of the released cAMP builds in the environm ent as other amoe ba face starva tion. When secreted cAMP signa l molecules bind to cAMP-recep tors on the cell membranes of other slime mold amoeba, it signals them to activa te a swarming behavior wherein the amoe ba congregate and form a large multicellular "slug." The slug comm uni ty is the reproductive stage of slime mold . Dur ing the "famine" period, the community of aging cells shares their DNA and creates the next genera tion of offspring. The new amoeba hibern ate as inacti ve spor es. When more food is available, the food molecules act as a signal to break the hibernation, re leasing a new population of sing le cells to start the cycle ove r again.

The point is that single-celled organis ms actually live in community when they share their "awareness" and coordinate their behaviors by releasing "signal" molecules into the environm ent. Cyclic AMP was one of evo lution's earliest forms of secreted regul atory signals that control cell behavior. The fundamental human signal molecules (e.g., hormones, neuropeptides, cytokines, gro wth factors) that regulate our own cellular communi ties were once thou ght to have arisen with the appearance of complex multicellular life forms . However, recent research has n ow revealed that primitive single-celled organisms were alread y using these "human" signa l molecules in the earliest stages of evolution.
Thr ou gh evolu tion, cells maximized the number of IMP "awareness" proteins their membranes could hold. To acquire more awareness, and therefore increase their probability of surv iving, cells star ted to assemble, first into simp le colonies and later into highly organized cellular communi ties. As described earlier, the physiologic functions of multicellular organisms are parceled out to specialized communities of cells forming the body's tissues and organs. In communal organizations, the cell membrane's intelligence pro cessing is carried out by the specialized cells of the organism's nervous and immune systems.
It was only 700 million years ago, recent in regard to the lime frame of life on this planet, when single cells found it advan tageous to join together in tightl y knit multicellular comm unities, organizations we recognize as animals and plants. The same coordinating signal molecules used by free-living cells were used in these newl y evolved closed communi ties. By tightl y regu latin g the release and distribution of these function-controlling signal molecules, the comm unity of cells would be able to coordinate their functions and act as a single life form . In the more primitive multic ellular organis ms, those without specialized nerv ous systems, the flow of these signal molecules within the community pro vided an elementary "mind," represented by the coordinating information shared by every cell. In such organisms, each cell dir ectly re ad environmental cues and personally adjusted its own behavior.

I.n higher, more aware life forms, the brain developed a specialization that ena bled the whole comm unity to tune into the status of its regulatory signals. The evoluti on of the limbic system provided a uniq ue mechanism that converted the chernica l communication signals into sensatio ns that could be expe rienced by all of the cells in the comm uni ty. Our conscious mind experiences these signals as emotions . The conscious mind not only "reads" the flow of the cellular coord inating signals tha t comprise the body' s " mind ," it can also gen
However, when cells came together in communi ty, a new politic had to be established. In community, each cell cannot act as an independent agent that does whatever it wants. The term "communi ty" implies that all of its members commit to a commo n plan of action . In mul ticellu lar animals, individual cells may "see:' the local environment outside of their own "skin," but they may have no awareness of wha t is going on in more distant env ironme nts, especially those outside of the whole organis m itself. Can a liver cell buried in your viscera, resp onding to its local environmen tal signals, make an informed resp onse regarding the conseq uence of a mu gger that jumps into your enviro nment? The comp lex behav ior controls needed to ensur e a multicellular organization's surv ival are incorp orated within its centralized information processing sys tem.
As more complex animals evolved, specialized cells took over the job of monitorin g and organizing the flow of the behavior regulating signal molecules. These cells pro vided a distributed n erve network and central information proc essor, a brain. The brain's function is to coordinate the dialogue of signal molecules within the community. Consequently, in a community of cells, each cell mu st acquiesce control to the informed decisions of its awareness autho rity, the brain. The brain controls the behavior of (he bod y's cells. This is a very important point to consider as we blame the cells of our organs an d tissues for the health issues we experience in our lives.

At the same time that I was stu dy ing the mechanics of the cell's brain and gaini ng insight into the operation of the human brain, Candace Per t was study ing the h uman brain an d becoming aware of the mechanics of the cell's brai n. In Molecules of Emotion, Pert revealed how her study of informa tion -processing receptors on n erv e cell me mbranes led her to discover that the same "neural" receptors were present on mos t, if not all, of the bod y's cells. Her elegant experiments established that the "mind" was not focused in the head , but was distributed via signal molecules to the whole body. As importan tly, her work emphas ized that emotions we re no t only derived through a feedback of the body's environmental information. Thr ou gh self-conscious ness, the mind can use the brain to generate "m olecules of emotion" and ove rride the system . Whil e proper use of consciousness can bring health to an ailing body, inappropriate unconscious con trol of emotions can easily make a healthy body diseased, a topi c I will expand u po n in Chapters 6 and 7. Molecules of Emotion is a very insigh tful book describing the scientific discovery process. It also provides some revealing insights into the struggles encountere d when trying to introduce n ew "id eas" into science's d id Boy Club, a subject wi th which I am all too familiar ! [Per t 1997]
The limbic system offered a ma jor evolutionary advance throu gh its ability to sense and coord inate the flow of behavior-regulating signals w ithin the cellular community. As the internal signal system evolved, its greater efficiency ena bled the brain to increase in size. Multicellular organisms gain ed increasingly mo re cells tha t were dedicated to responding to an ever-wide r variety of external en vironmental signals. While indi vidual cells can resp on d to simple sensory perceptions such as red, round, aromatic, and sweet, the extra brainpower avai lable in multicellular animals enables them to combine those simple sensations into a higher level of complexity and perceive 1/ appl e."

CHAPTER F IVE Biology and Belief
Fun damen tal reflex behaviors acquired thro ugh evolution are passed on to offsp ring in the form of genetic-based instincts. The evoluti on of larger brains, with their increased neural cell population, offered organis ms the opportunity not only to rely on instinctual behavior, but also to learn from their life experiences. The learning of novel reflex behaviors is essentially a prod uct of conditioning. For example, consider the classic exam ple of Pavlov training his dogs to salivate at the ring of a bell. He first traine d them by ringing a bell and coupling that stimulus with a food rew ard. After awhile, he would ring the bell but not offer the food. By that time, the dogs were so programmed to expect the food that when the bell rang, they reflexively started to salivate even thou gh no food was p resent. This is clearly an II unconscious," learned reflex behavior.
Humans and a number of other higher mammals have evolved a specialized region of the brain associated wi th thinking, planning and decision-making called the prefrontal cortex. This portion of the forebrain is apparen tly the seat of the "self-conscious" mind processing. The self-conscious mind is self-reflective; it is a newly evolved "sense organ" that observes our ow n behaviors an d emo tions. The self-conscious mind also has access to most of the data stored in our long-term
Reflex behaviors may be as simple as the spontaneous kick of the leg when a mallet taps the knee, or as complex as driving a car at sixtyfive miles per hour on a crow ded inters tate highw ay while your conscious mind is fully eng aged in conversa tion wi th a passenger. Thou gh condi tioned behavioral responses may be inordinately complex, they are " no-brainers." Throu gh the condi tioned learning process, neural pa thways betw een eliciting stim uli and beha vioral resp on ses become hard wired to ensur e a rep etitive pattern. Hard wired pa thways are "habits." In lower ani mals, the entire brain is designed to eng age in purely habitual responses to stimuli. Pavlov's dogs salivate by reflex.. .not by de liberate intention. The actions of the subconscious mind are reflexive in na ture and are not gove rne d by reason or thinking. Physically, this mind is associated with the activities of all of the bra in structures tha t are present in animals that have not evolved self-consciousness.

memory bank . This is an extremely im portant feature allowing our history of life to be considered as we consciously plan ou r futures.
Endowed with the ability to be self-reflective, the self-conscious mind is extremely powerful. It can observe an y programmed behavior we are engaged in, evaluate the behavior and consciously decide to change the program. We can actively choose how to respond to most environmental signals and whether we even wan t to respond at all. The conscious mind's capacity to override the subconscious mind's preprogrammed behaviors is the foun dation of free will.
However, our special gift comes wi th a special pitfall. While alm ost all organisms have to actually expe rience the stim uli of life first-hand, the hum an brain's ability to "learn" perceptions is so adv anced that we can actually acq uire percepti ons indirectly from teachers. Once we accept the perceptions of others as " truths," their percep tions become hardwired into our own brains, becomin g aur " truths." Here's w here the problem arises: what if our teachers' pe rcep tions are inaccu rate? In such cases, our brains are then downl oad ed with misperceptions. The subconscious mind is strictly a stimulusresponse playback device; there is no "ghost" in that part of the "machine" to ponder the long-term conseque nces of the programs w e engage. The subconscious works only in the "now." Consequently, programmed misperceptions in our subconscious mind are not "monitored " an d will habitually enga ge us in inapprop riate and limiting behaviors.

My insights into how beliefs control biology are grounded in my studies of cloned end othelial cells, the cells tha t line the blood vessels.

When I pro vid ed nutrients, the cells wo uld gravitate toward those nutrients with the cellular equiva lent of open arms.

But what if a herpetologist were reading this book an d a snake popped out? No doubt herpetologi sts would not only be intrigued by the snake, the y wo uld be thrilled with the bonus included in the book .
Or at least they'd be thrilled once they figured out that the book's snake was harmless. They would the n hold it and watch its behaviors with delight. They would think that your programmed response was an irrational one, becau se not all snakes are dangerous. Fur ther they would be saddened by the fact that so many people are deprived of the pleasure of studyin g such interesting creatures. Same snake, sam e stim ulus, yet greatly different res ponses .
Our responses to environmental stimuli are indeed controlled by percep tions, bu t not all of our learned perceptions are accurate. Not all snakes are dangerous !Yes, perception"controls" biology, bu t as we've seen, these perceptions can be tru e or false. Therefore, we would be more accurate to refer to thes e controlling perceptions as beliefs.
Beliefs control biology!
Ponder the significance of this information.

agents. My research focused on the mem brane percepti on swi tches that controlled the shift from one behavior to the other.
The primary switch I wa s stu dying has a pro tein recep tor that resp onds to histamin e, a molecule that the body uses in a way that is equivalent to a local emergency alarm. I found that there are two varieties of switches, HI and H2, that respond to the same histamine signal . When activated, switches with HI histamine receptors evoke a protection response, the type of behavior revealed by cells in toxin-containing culture d ishes. Switches containing H2 histamine receptors evoke a growth response to histamine, similar to the behavior of cells cultured in the presence of nutrien ts.
I su bsequently learned that the bod y's system-wide emergency response signa l, adrenaline, also has swi tches sporting two different adrenaline-sensing recep tors, called alpha an d beta. The adrenaline receptors provoked the exact same cell behaviors as those elicited by histamine. When the adrenal alpha-receptor is part of an IMP switch, it provokes a protection response whe n adre naline is perceived . When the beta-receptor is part of the sw itch, the same adre naline signal activates a growth resp onse. [Lipton, et al, 1992]
All tha t was interesting, bu t the most exciting finding was when I simul taneously introduced both histamine and adrenaline into my tissue cultures. I foun d that adrenalin e signals, released by the central nerv ous system, override the influence of histamine signals tha t are produced locally. This is where the po litics of the community described earlier comes in to play. Sup pose you're working in a bank. The branch manager gives you an order. The CEO walks in and gives you the opposite order. Which order would you follow? If you want to keep your job you' ll sna p to the CEO's order . There is a similar priority built into our biology, which requires cells to follow instructions from the head honcho nervous system, even if those signa ls are in conflict with local stimuli.
I was excited by my experiments because I believed that they revealed on the single-cell level a tru th for mul ticellular organis rns that the mind (i.e. acting via the central nervous system's adrena line)

Placebos: The Belief Effect
( HAPTEn F IVE Biology and Belief
Every medical stu dent learn s, at least in passing, tha t the mind can affect the body . They learn that some people get better whe n they believe (falsely) they are getting medicine. When patients get better by ingesting a sugar pill, medicine defines it as the placebo effect. My frien d Rob Williams, founder of PSYCH-K, an ene rgy-based psychological treatment system, suggests that it would be more ap propriate to refer to it as the perception effect. I call it the belief effect to stress that our p erceptions, whether they are accurate or inaccurate, equally impact our behavior and our bodies.
I celebrate the belief effect, which is an amazing testament to the healing ability of the body/ mind. However, the "all in their minds" placebo effect has been linked by traditional medicine to, at worst, quacks or, at best, weak, suggestible patients . The placebo effect is quickly glossed ove r in medical schools so that students can get to the real tools of modem medicine like drugs and surgery.
This is a gian t mistake. The placebo effect sho uld be a major topic of stu dy in medical school. I believe that medical ed ucation should train doctors to recognize the power of our internal resources. Doctors should not dismiss the power of the mind as something inferior to the power of chemicals and the scalpel. They should let go of their con
ove rrides the body (acting via the local histamine signal ). I wanted to spell out the impli cations of my experiments in my research paper, but my colleagues almost died from apoplexy at the notion of injecting the body-mind connection into a paper abou t cell biology. So I put in a cryptic comment abo ut understanding the significance of the study, but I could n't say what the significance was. My colleagues did not want me to include these implications of my research because the mind is not an acceptable biological concept. Bio-scientists are conventional Newtonians - if it isn't matter ...it doesn't coun t. The "mind" is a non-localized energy and therefore is not relevant to mat erialistic biology . Unfortunately, tha t perception is a "belief" that has been proven to be pa tently incorrect in a qu antum mechanical universe!

viction that the body and its parts are essentially stupid and that we need outside intervention to maintain our health.
The placebo effect should.be the subject of major, funded research efforts. If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, they wo uld hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect-free tool to trea t disease. Energy healers say they alrea dy have such tools, but I am a scientist and I believe the more we know about the science of the placebo, the better we' ll be able to use it in clinical settin gs.
I believe the reason the mind has so summarily been dismissed in medicine is the result, not only of dogmatic thinking, but also of financial considerations . If the power of your mind can heal your sick body, w hy should you go to the doctor and more importantly, why wo uld you need to bu y drugs? In fact, I wa s recently chagrined to learn that drug companies are stu dying patients who respond to sugar pills with the goal of eliminating them from early clinical trials. It ine vitably disturbs pharmaceutical manufacturers tha t in most of their clinicallrials the placebos, the "fake" drugs, prove to be as effective as their engineered chemical cocktails. [Greenberg 2003] Though the drug companies insist they're not try ing to make it easier for ineffective drugs to get approved, it is clear that effectiveness of placebo pills are a threat to the pharmaceutical industry. The message from the drug companies is clear to me : if you can' t beat placebo pills fairly, simply remove the com p etition!
The fact that most doctors are not trained to consider the impact of the placebo effect is ironic because some historians make a strong case that the history of medicine is largely the history of the placebo effect. For mos t of medical history, doctors did not have effective methods to fight disease. Some of the more notorious treatmen ts once prescribe d by mainstream medicine include bloodletting, treating wounds with arsenic, and the proverbial cure-all, rattlesnake oil. No doubt som e patients, the conservatively estimated one third of the population who are particularl y susceptible to the healing power of the placebo effect, got better with those treatments. In today's world, when doctors wear

ing white coats deliver a treatment decisively, patients ma y belieue the treatment works - and so it does, whether it is a real drug or just a sugar pill .
Though the qu estion of how placebos wo rk has in the main been ignored by medi cine, recently some mainstream medical researchers are turning the ir attentio n to it. The results of those studies suggest that it is not only wacky, nin eteenth-century treatments that can foster a placebo effect bu t also mod ern med icine's sop histicated techn ology , including the most" concrete" of med ical tools, surgery.
A Baylor School of Medicine study, published in 2002 in the New EnglandJournal ofMedicine eval uated surgery for patien ts with severe, debilitating knee pa in. [Moseley, et al, 2002] The lead author of the study, Dr. Bruce Moseley, " kne w" that knee surgery helped his patients: "All good surgeons know there is no placebo effect in surgery ." But Moseley was tryin g to figur e out which part of the surgery was giving his patient s relief. The patients in the study were divided int o three gro ups. Moseley shaved the damaged carti lage in the knee of one gro up. For ano ther gro up, he flus hed out the knee joint, removin g material thought to be causing the inflammato ry effect. Both of these constitu te standar d treatment for arthritic knees . The third group got "fake" surgery . The patient was sedated, Moseley mad e three stan dard incisions and then talked and acted just as he wou ld have d uring a real surgery - he even splashed salt water to sim ula te the soun d of the knee-washing pr ocedure. After 40 minutes, Moseley sewed up the incisions as if he had done the surgery. All three groups were prescribed the sam e postoperative care, which included an exercise program.
The results were shocking. Yes, the gro ups wh o received surgery, as expected, improved . But the placebo gro u p im pro ved just as mu ch as the other two gro ups! Despite the fact that there are 650,000 surgeries year ly for arthritic knees, at a cost of about $5,000 each, the results were clear to Moseley: "My skill as a surgeo n had no benefit on these patients. The entire benefit of sur gery for osteoarthri tis of the knee was the placebo effect." Television news programs grap hically illustra ted

the stunning results. Footage showed members of the placebo group walking and playing basketball, in short doing things they reported they could not do before their "surgery." The placebo patients didn't find out for two years that they had gotten fake surg ery. One member of the placebo group, Tim Perez, who had to walk with a cane before the surgery, is now able to play basketball with his grandchil dren. He summed up the theme of this book when he told the Discovery Health Channel: " In this world anything is possible w hen you put your mind to it. l know tha t your mind can work miracles."
Stu dies have shown the placebo effect to be powerful in treating other diseases, including asthma and Parkinson's. In the treatment of depression, placebos are stars. So much so that psychiatrist Walter Brown of the Brown University School of Medicine. has proposed placebo pills as the first treatment for patients with mild or moderate depression . [Brown 1998] Patients would be told that they're getting a remedy with no active ingredien t, but that shouldn' t dam pen the pills' effectiveness . Studies suggest that even when peo ple know they're not getting a drug, the placebo pills still work .)
One indication of the power of the placebo carne from a report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The report found that half of severely depressed pa tients takin g drugs improve versus thir ty-two percent taking a placebo. [Hor gan 1999] Even that impressive showin g may underestimate the power of the placebo effect becau se many stu dy participants figure out they' re taking the real drug because they experience side effects that are not experienced by those taking the placebo. Once those pa tients realize they're taking the drug, i.e. once they start belieoing that they're getting the real pill, they are particularly mo re susceptible to the placebo effect.
Given the power of the placebo, it is no wonder that the $8.2 billion antidepressan t ind ustry is un der attack by critics who charg e that drug companies are hyping the effectiveness of their pills. In a 2002 article in the Am erican Psychological Association's Preuenlion & Treatment, "The Emp eror's ew Drugs," University of Connecticut psyclhology professor Irving Kirsch foun d that eighty percent of the

effect of antidepressants, as measured in clinical trials, could be attributed to the placebo effect. [Kirsch, et al, 2002] Kirsch had to invoke the Freedom of Information Act in 2001 to get information on the clinical trials of the top anti de pressants; these data were not forthcoming from the Food and Drug Administra tion. The data show that in more than half of the clinical trials for the six leading anti depressants, the drugs did not outperform placebo, sugar pills. And Kirsch noted in a Discovery Health Channel interview that: "The dif ference be tween the response of the drugs an d the response of placebo was less than two points on average on this clinical scale that goes from fifty to sixty points. That's a very sma ll difference. That difference clinically is m eaningless."
Another interesting fact about the effectiveness of an tidepressants is that they have performed better and be tter in clinical trials over the years, sugges ting that their placebo effects are in part due to savvy marketing. The more the mir acle of antide pressants was tou ted in the media and in advertisements, the more effective they became . Beliefs are contagio us! We now live in a culture where peop le believe that anti depressants work, and so they do.
A California interior designer, Janis Schonfe ld, who took part in a clinical trial to test the efficacy of Effexor in 1997, was jus t as "stunned" as Perez when she found out that she had been on a placebo. N ot only had the pills relieved her of the depression that had plagued her for thirty years, the brain scans she received throu ghou t the stu dy foun d that the activity of her prefrontal cortex was greatly enh ance d. [Leuchter, et al, 2002] Her improvements were not "all in her head." When the mind chan ges, it abso lutely affects your biology. Schonfeld also experienced nau sea, a common Effexor side effect. She is typical of patients who improve with placebo treatment an d then find out they were not on the real drug - she was convinced the doctors had made a mistake in the labeling for she "knew" she was on the dru g. She insisted that the researchers do uble-check their records to make absol utely sure she wasn' t on the drug .

Nocebos: The Powe r
of Negative Beliefs
While many in the medical profession are aware of the placebo effect, few have considered its implications for self-he aling. If positive thinking can pull you out of depression and heal a damaged knee, consider w ha t negati ve thinking can do in your life. When the mind, thr ough positive suggestion improves health, it is referre d to as the placebo effect. Conversely, when the same mind is engaged in negative suggestions that can dam age health, the negative effects are referred to as the noeebo effect.
In medi cine, the nocebo effect can be as pow erful as the placebo effect, a fact you should keep in mind every time you step into a doctor' s office. By their wo rds and their de meano r, physicians can convey hope-deflating messages to their patients, messages that are, I believe completely unwarranted. Albert Mason for exam ple, thinks his inability to project optimism to his patients ham pered his efforts with his ichthyosis patien ts. Ano ther example is the po tential power of the stateme nt: "You have six months to live." If you choose to believe your doctor's message, you are not likely to ha ve mu ch more time on this Earth.
I have cited the Discovery Health Cha nne l's 2003 pr ogram "Placebo: Mind Over Medicine" in this chapter because it is a good compendium of some of medicine's most interesting cases. One of its more po ignant segments featured a ashville physician, Clifton Meador, who has been reflecting on the potential power of the nocebo effect for 30 years. In 1974 Meado r had a patien t, Sam Londe, a retired shoe salesm an sufferin g from cancer of the esophagus, a condition that was at the time cons idered 100 per cen t fatal. Londe was treated for that cancer but everyone in the med ical community "kne w" that his esophageal cance r would recur. So it was no surprise whe n Londe died a few weeks after his diagnosis.
The surprise came after Londe 's dea th when an au topsy found very little cancer in his body, certainly not enough to kill him . Ther e were a couple of spo ts in the liver and one in the lun g, but there was

no trace of the esop hageal cancer that everyone thought had killed him. Mead or told the Discovery H ealth Channel: "He died with cancer, but not from cancer. " What did Lande die of if not esophageal cancer? Had he died because he believed he was going to die ? The case still haunts Meador thre e decades after Lond e's death: "I thought he had cancer. He thought he had cancer. Everybody around him thought he had cancer. ..did ] remove hope in some way?" Troub lesome nocebo cases suggest that physicians, parents and teachers can remove hope by programming you to believe you are powerl ess.
Our positive and negative beliefs not only impact our health, but also every as pect of our life. Henry Ford wa s right about the efficiency of assembly lines and he was right about the power of the mind: "If you believe you can or if you believe you can't. i.you're right. " Think about the impli cations of the man who blithely drank the bacteria that m edicine had decided caused cholera. Consider the people who walk across coals wi thout getting burned . [f they wo bble in the steadfastness of their belief that they can do it, they wind up with burned feet. Your beliefs act like filters on a camera, changin g how you see the world . And your biology ad apts to those beliefs. When we trul y recognize that our beliefs are that powerful, we hold the key to freed om. While we cannot readily change the codes of our gene tic blueprints, we can change our minds.
In my lectures ] pro vide two sets of plastic filters, one red and one green. ] have the audie nce pick one color and then look at a blank screen. ] then tell them to yell out whether the image I project next is one that generates love or generates fear. Those in the audience that don the red "belief" filters see an invitin g picture of a cottage labeled "House of Love," flowers, a sunny sky an d the message "I live in Love." Those wearing the green filters see a threatening dark sky, bats, snakes, a ghost hovering outside a dark, gloomy house and the words "I live in fear." I alwa ys get enjoyment out of seeing how the audience resp onds to the confusion when half yell out "I live in love," and the other half, in equal certain ty, yells out "I live in fear" in response to the same image.



T h e B io log y of Be lie f
Then I ask the audience to change to the opposite colored filters. My point is tha t you can choose what to see. You can filter your life with rose-colored beliefs that will help your bod y grow or yo u can use a dark filter that turns everything black and makes your body/ mind mor e susceptible to disease. You can live a life of fear and or live a life
of love. You ha ve the choice! But I can tell you that if yo u choose to see a wo rld full of love, your bod y w ill respond by growing in health. If you choose to believe that you live in a dark wo rld full of fear, your bod y's h ealth will be compromised as you physiologically close yourself down in a prot ection response.
Learning how to harness your mind to prom ote grow th is the secret of life, which is wh y I called this book The Biology of Belief Of course the secret of life is not a secret at all. Teachers like Buddha and Jesus have been telling us the sam e story for millennia. Now science is pointing in the same direction. It is not our genes but our beliefs that control our lives ... Oh ye of little belief!
Tha t tho ught is a good entree into the next chapter, in which I'll detail how living in love and living in fear create op posite effects in the body and the mind. Before we leave this cha pter, I'd jus t like to emphas ize again tha t not only is there nothing w rong with going through life wear ing the proverbial rose-color ed glasses. In fact, tho se rose-colored glasses are necessary for your cells to thrive. Positive thou gh ts are a biological mandate for a happy, healthy life. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi:

volution has provided us with lots of survival mechanisms. They can be roughly divided into two func tional categories: growth and protection . These growth and protection mechanisms are the fun dame ntal behaviors required for an organism to sur vive. I'm sur e you know how imp ortant it is to pro tect yourself. You may not realize thou gh that gro wth is vitally important for yo ur survival as well - even if you' re an ad ult who has reached your full height.

By now you won' t be sur prised to learn that I first became aware of how importan t growth and protection behaviors are in the laboratory where my observa tions of sing le cells ha ve so often led me to insights abo ut the multicellular human body. When I was cloning

human endothelial cells, they retreated from toxins tha t [ introduced into the culture dish, just as humans retrea t from mountain lions and muggers in dark alleys. They also gravitated to nutrients, just as humans gravitate to breakfast, lunch, dinn er and love. These oppos ing movements deline the two basic cellular resp onses to environmental stim uli. Gravitating to a life-sustaining signal, such as nutrients, characterizes a growth resp onse; moving away from threatening signals, such as toxins, characterizes a protection response. It must also be noted that some environmental stimuli are neu tral; they provoke neither a growth nor a protection response.
My research at Stanford showed that these grow th/protection behaviors are also essential for the survival of multicellular organisms such as humans. But there is a catch to these opposing survival mechanisms that have evolved over billions of years. It turns out that the mechanisms that support growth and pro tection cann ot operate optimally at the same time. In other words, cells cannot simu ltaneously move forward and backward . The human blood vessel cells I studied at Stanford exhibited one microscop ic ana tomy for pro viding nutrition an d a completely different microscopic ana tomy for providin g a protection response. What they couldn't do was exhibit both configurations at the same time. [Lipton, et al, 1991']
In a response similar to that displayed by cells, humans un avoidably restrict the ir grow th behaviors when they shift into a pro tective mode. If you're running from a mo un tain lion, it's not a good idea to expend ene rgy on growth. In ord er to surv ive - that is, escape the lion - you summon all your energy for your fight or flight response. Redistri buting ene rgy reserves to fuel th e protection resp onse inevitably results in a curtailment of growth.
In ad dition to di verting energy to support the tissu es an d organs needed for the protection response, there is an additional reason why growth is inhibited . Grow th processes require an open exchan ge between an organism and its environment. For example, food is taken in and waste pro ducts are excreted . However, pr otection requ ires a
146

closing down of the system to wall the organism off from the perceived threat.
Inhibiting growth processes is also debilitating in that growth is a process th at not only expends energy but is also requ ired to produce energy. Conseq uently, a sustained protection response inhibits the creation of life-sustaining energy. The longer you stay in protection, the m ore you compromise your growth. In fact, you can shut down growth pro cesses so completely that it becomes a truism that you can be "scared to death."
CHAPTER SIX Growth and Protection
In multicellular organis ms, growth/ pro tection behaviors are controlled by the nervous system. It is the nervous system's job to monitor env ironmental signals, interpret them, an d organize ap propriate behavioral responses. In a multicellular comm unity, the nervou s system acts like the government in organizing the activities of its cellular citizens. When the nerv ous syst em recognizes a threatening env ironmental stress, it alerts the comm unity of cells to impending danger.
The bod y is actually endowed with two separa te pro tection systems, each vital to the m aintenance of life. The first is the sys tem that m obilizes protection agains t externa7 threats. It is called the HP A axis,
Thankfully, most of us don't get to the "scared to death" point. Unlike sing le cells, the growth / protection response in mul ticellular organisms is not an eithe r/or proposition - not all of our 50 trillion cells have to be in growth or protection mode at the same time. The prop ortion of cells in a protection resp onse depends on the severi ty of the perceived threats. You can survive whil e under stress from these threats but chronic inhib ition of growth mechanisms severely compromises your vitality. It is also important to note that to fully experience your vi tality it takes more than just getting rid of life's stressors . In a growth/ protection continuum, eliminating the stressors only puts you at the neutral point in the range. To fully thriv e, we must not only eliminate the stressors but also actively seek joyful, lovin g, fulfilling lives that stim ula te growth processes.

w hich stan ds for the Hypothalam us-Pitui tary -Adrenal Axis. When there are no threa ts, the HPA axis is inactive and growth flourishes. However, when the brain's hypoth alam us perceives an environmental threat, it engages the HPA axis by sending a signal to the pituitary gland, the " Master Gland," which is responsible for organizing the fifty trillion cells of the community to deal with the impending threat.
Think back to th e cell membrane's stimulus-response mechanism, the receptor-effector proteins - the hyp othalamus and pituitary gland are behavioral equivalents.Similar to the role of a recept or p rotein, the hypothalamus receives and recognizes environmental signals; the pituitary's function resembl es that of the effector protein in that it launches the body's organs into action. In resp onse to threats from the external env ironment, the pituitary gland sends a signal to the adre nal glands, informing them of the need to coord inate the body's "fight or flight" response.
The technical de tails of how stress stimuli engage the HP A axis folIow a simple cascade: In response to perceptions of stress registered in the brain, the hyp oth alamus secretes a corticotropin-releas ing factor (CRF), which travels to the pituit ary gland. CRF activates special pituitary hormone-secretin g cells causing them to release adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH) into the blood . The ACTH then makes its way to the adrenal glands, whe re it serves as the signa l to turn on the secretion of the "fight-flight" adrenal horm ones. These stress hormones coordinate the function of the body 's organs, providing us with great physiologic power to fend off or flee danger.
Once the ad renal alarm is sounded , the stress hormones released into the blood cons trict the blood vessels of the digestive tract, forcing the energy -providing blood to prefere ntially nourish the tissues of the arms an d legs that enable us to get out of harm's way. Before the blood was sent to the extremities, it was concentrated in the visceral organs . Redistr ibu ting the viscera's blood to the limbs in the fight or flight response results in an inhibition of growth-related fun ctions; without the blood 's nourishment the visceral orga ns cann ot function properly. The visceral organs stop doing their life-sustaining work of diges tion,

absorp tion, excretion and other functions tha t provide for the growth of the cells and the production of the body' s energy reserves . Hence, the stress response inhibits growth processes and fur ther comp romi ses the bod y's surv ival by inte rfering with the generation of vital energy reserves.
The bod y's second protection system is the immune system, which protects us from thr eats originating under the skin, such as those caused by bacteria and v iruses. When the immune system is mobilized, it can cons ume much of the bod y's energy supply. To get a sense



The Bi o log y o f B e l i ef
of how much energy the immune system expends, recall how physically weak you become when you are fighting infections such as a flu or a cold . When the HPA axis mobilizes the body for fight or flight resp onse, the adrenal hormones directly repress the action of the immune system to conserve energy reserv es. In fact, stress hormo nes are so effective at curtailing immune syste m fun ction that doctors provided them to recipients of transplants so that their immune systems wo uldn' t reject the foreign tissues.
Why would the adrenal syste m shut do wn the immune system? Imagine that you are in your tent on the African savannah suffering from a bacterial infection and experiencing a bad case of diarrhea. You hear the gutty growl of a lion outside your tent. The brain must make a decision about which is the grea ter thre at. It will do your body no good to conquer the bacteria if you let a lion maul you. So your bod y halts the fight against the infection in favor of mobilizing ener gy for flight to survive your close encounter wi th a lion . Therefore, a secondary consequence of engaging the HPA axis is tha t it interferes with our ability to fight disease.
Activating the HPA axis also interferes with our ability to think clearly. The processing of inform ation in the forebra in, the center of executive reasoning and logic, is significantly slowe r than the reflex activity controlled by the hindbrain . 10 an emergency, the faster the inform atio n processing, the more likely the organism will survive. Adrenal stress hormones cons trict the blood vessels in the forebrain redu cing its ability to function. Additionally, the hormones repress activity in the brain 's prefrontal cortex, the center of conscious volitional actio n conscious activity. 10 an emergency, the vascular flow an d hormones serve to activate the hindbrain, the source of life-su staining reflexes that most effectively contro l fight or flight behavior. While it is necessary that stress signals repress the slowe r processing conscious mind to enhance survival, it comes at a cost. ..diminished conscious awareness and reduced intelligence.

Remember the shell shocke d, frozen look on my Caribbean med ical stu de nts' faces when they failed my test, the medical schoo l equivalent of a voracious lion? Had my stude nts stayed frozen in fear, I can guarantee you that they would have perform ed dismally on their finals . The sim ple truth is, when you' re frightened you're dumber. Teachers see it all the time among stu dents who "don' t test well." Exam stress paralyzes these students who, with trembling hands, m ark wro ng answers because in their panic, they can't access cerebrally stored information they have carefully acquired all semester.
The HP A system is a brillian t mecha nism for han dling acu te stresses. However, this protection system was not designed to be continu ou sly activated . In today's world, mos t of the stresses we are experiencing are not in the form of acute, concrete" threats" that we can easily identify, respond to and move on . We are constan tly besieged by m ultitudes of unresolvable worries abou t our personal lives, our jobs, and our war- tom global community. Such worries do not threaten our immediate sur vival but they nevertheless can activate the HPA axis, resulting in chronically elevated stress hormones.
To illustrate the adverse effects of sustained adrena line, let's use an examp le of a track race. An extremely well-trained and healthy group of sp rin ters step up to the starting line. When they hear the command: "On your mark!" they get on their hands and knees and adjust their feet into the starting blocks. Then the start er barks out, "Ge t set." The athl etes' muscles tighten as they prop themselves up on their fingers and toes. When they shift into "Get set" m ode, the ir bod ies release the flight-prom otin g ad renaline hormones that power their muscles for the ard uous task ahea d . While the athletes are on hold awa iting the "Go" command, their bodies are straining in anticipation of that task. In a normal race, that strain lasts only a second or two before the starter yells, "Go!" Ho wever, in our mythical race, the "Go" comman d, which would laun ch the athle tes into action, never comes. The athletes are left in the starting blocks, their blood coursing with adrenaline, their bodies fatiguing with the stra in of preparin g for the race that

never comes. N o matter how toned their phys ique, within seconds, these athletes will physically collapse from the strain .
We live in a "Get set" world and an increasing body of research su gges ts that our hyper-vigilant lifestyle is severely impacting the health of our bodies. Our dail y stressors are constantly activating the HPA axis, priming our bodies for action. Unlike competitive athletes, the stresses in our bodies are no t released from the pressures generated by our chronic fears and concerns. Almost every major illness that people acquire has been linked to chronic. stress. [Segerstrom and Miller 2004; Kop p and Rethelyi 2004; McEwen and Lasky 2002;. McEw en and Seeman 1999]
In a revealing study published in 2003 in Science, researchers considered why patients on SSRI antidepressants, such as Pro zac or Zoloft, don't feel better right aw ay. There is usually at least a twoweek lag between starting the drugs and the time the patients feel they are getting better . The stu dy found that depressed people exhibit a surprising lack of cell division in the region of the brain called the hippocampus, a part of the nervous system involved with memory. Hippocampal cells renew ed cell division at the time patients first began to expe rience the mood-shilting effect of the SSRI drugs, weeks after the onset of the drug regi men. This stu dy and others challenge the theory that depression is simply the resul t of a "ch emical imbalance " affecting the brain's prod uction of monoamine signaling chemicals, specifically sero tonin. If it were as simple as tha t, the SSRI drugs would likely restore that chemical balanc e right away.
More researchers are pointing to the inhibition of neuronal growth by stress hormones as the sourc e of d epression . In fact, in chronically dep ressed patien ts, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, the cen ter of higher reasoning, are physically shrunken. A review of this stu dy published in Science reported: "Ove rtaking the monoamine hypothesis in recent years has been the stress hypothesis, which pos its that d epression is caused when the brain's stress machinery goes into overdrive. The most prominent player in this theory is the hypothalamic-pituitary-ad renal (HPA) axis." [H olden 2003]
152



153
The HPA axis' effect on the cellular comm uni ty mirrors the effect of stress on a human population. Picture a vibrant communi ty back in the Cold War years, when the possibility of a nuclear attack by the Russians weighed heavily on American s' minds. Like cells in a multicellular organism, the members of this Cold War society actively work at jobs that contribute to the community' s growth and usu ally get along with each other. Factories are busy manufacturing, construction people are buildin g new homes, grocery stores are selling food, and kids are in school learning their ABCs. The comm uni ty is in a state of health and growth while its resid ents cons tructively interact toward a commo n goal.
Sudde nly, th e so un d of an air raid siren rocks the town. Everyo ne stops wor king to run off, seeki ng the safety of bomb she lter s. Th e harmony of the community is di srupted as individuals, acting only in suppo rt of their own surviva l, fight their wa y to a bomb she lter. After five minutes, th e all-clea r signal sounds . Resid ents return to th eir jobs and res ume th eir life in a gr owing com munity.
But wh at would happen if the sirens sound, the residents run into their air raid shelters and there is no all-clear signa l to release them? People would stay in their protective postures ind efinitely. How long can they maintain their pro tection posture? The comm unity eventually collapses in the face of dw indling food and water supp lies. One by one eve n the stronges t die because chro nic stress is debilitatin g. A comm uni ty can easily surv ive short-term stress, like an air raid drill , but w hen the stress goes on and on it results in cessation of growth and the breakdown of the conun unity.
Another illustration of the influ ence of stress on a population is the story of the 9/11 tragedy. Up to the moment those terrorists attacked, the country was in a state of growth . Then immediately after 9/ 11, as the shock of the news spread to reach not just the peop le of New York bu t the entire nation, we experienced a threa t to our surv ival. The impac t of government proclamations stress ing the continued presence of danger in the wake of the attack, wer e like the influence of the

adrenal signals. They shifted the members of the community from a state of growth to a state of protection . After a few days of this heartstopping fear, the coun try' s economi c vitality was so compromised tha t the preside nt had to intervene. To stimul ate growth, the presid ent repeatedly em phasized, "America is open for business." It took awhile for the fears to subside and for the economy to rebound. However, the residual threats of terrorism are still debilitating the vitality of our country. As a nation we should look more carefully at how our fear of future acts of terror ism is underminin g our quality of life. In some sense, the terrorists have alread y won since they have succeeded in frightening us into a chro nic, soul-sapping protective mode.
I'd also like to suggest that you examine how your fears and the ensuing protection behaviors impact your life. What fears are stunting your growth? Where did these fears come from? Are they necessary? Are they real? Are they contri buting to a full life? We'll deal more with these fears and where we got them in the next chapter on conscious parenting. If we can control our fears, we can regain control over our lives. President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew the destructive nature of fear . He chose his words carefully when he told the nation in the grip s of the Great Dep ression and looming World War: "We have nothing to fear, but fear itself." Letting go of our fears is the first ste p toward creating a fuller, more satisfying life.

CONSCIOUS PARE NTING : PARENTS AS GE NET IC ENGI NE ERS
Parents Matter
No doubt you've heard the sed uctive argument th at once parents bestow their genes on their childre n, they take a back seat in their children's lives - parents need only refrain from abusing their children, feed and clothe them, an d then wait to see where their preprograrnmed genes lead them . This notion allows parents to continue with their " pre-kids lives" -they can simply d rop their children off at daycare an d w ith babysitters. It's an appealing idea for busy and/or lazy parents.
It's also appealing for parents like me, who have biological childre n with rad ically different personalities. I used to think that my da ughters are different because they inherited different sets of gen es from the moment of conception - a rand om selection process in which their mother an d I had no part. After all, I thou ght, they grew up in the
155



T he B i o l o g y of B el ie f
sam e environment (n urture), so the reason for their differences had to be nature (genes).
The reality, I know n ow, is very different. Frontier science is confirmin g what mothers and en ligh tened fathers have know n forever, tha t parents do matter, despite best-selling books that try to convince them otherwise. To quote Dr. Thomas Verny , a pioneer in the field of prenatal and perinatal psychiatry: "Findings in the peer-reviewed literature over the course of decades establish, beyond any doubt, that parents have overw he lming influence on th e mental and ph ysical attrib utes of the children they ra ise." [Verny and Kelly 1981]
And that influence starts; says Vemy . not after children are born, bu t BEFORE children are born. When Vemy first posited the notion that the influ ence of parents extends even to the womb in his landmark, 1981 book, The Secret Life of the Unborn Child, the scientific evidence was prelimin ary and the "experts" skep tical. Because scientists used to think that the human brain did not become functional until after birth, it was assumed that fetu ses and infants had no memory and felt no pain . Afte r all, noted Freud, who coined the termed " infantile amnesia," most people do not re member any thi ng that happened to them before they were three or four years old.
However, experimental psychologists and neu roscienti sts are demolishing the myth tha t infants cannot remember-or for that matter learn - and along w ith it the notio n that parents are sim ply spec tators in the unfolding of their child ren's lives. The fetal and infan t nervous system has vast sensory and learning capabilities and a kind of memo ry that neuroscientists call impli cit memory. Another pioneer in pre- and perinatal psychology, David Chamberlain writes in his book The Mind of Your Newborn Baby : "The truth is, mu ch of wha t we have traditionalJy believed abou t ba bies is false. They are not simple beings but complex and ageless - smalJ crea tures with unexpectedly large thoughts." [Chamberlain 1998]
These com plex, small creatu res have a pre-birth life in the womb tha t profoun dly infl uences their long-term health and behavior: "The quality of life in the wo mb, our tem porary home before we were born ,

programs our susceptibility to coro nary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and a multitude of other conditions in later life," writes Dr. Peter W. Na thanielsz in Life in the W omb: The Origin of Health and Disease. [ athanielsz 1999J Recently, an even wider ran ge of adultrelated chro nic disorders, including osteoporosis, mood disorders and psyc hoses, have been intimately linked to pre- and perinatal develop mental influences. [Gluckman and Hanson 2004]
Recognizing the role the prenatal environment plays in creating disease forces a reconsideration of genetic de terminism. Nathanielsz writes: "There is mounting evidence that programming of lifetime health by the conditions in the womb is equ ally, if not more important, than our genes in determining how we perform mentall y and physically during life. Gene myopia is the term that best describes the current all-pervas ive view that our heal th and destiny throughout life are controlled by our genes alone...ln contras t to the relative fatalism of gene m yopia, understanding the mechanisms that underlie programming by the quali ty of life in the womb, we can improve the start in life for our children and their children."
The programming " mechanis ms" Nathanielsz refers to are the epigenetic mechanisms, discussed ear lier, by which environmental stimuli regulate gene activity . As Na thanielsz states, parents can improve the prenatal environment. In so doing they act as gene tic engineers for their children. The idea that parents can transmit hereditary changes from their life to their child ren is, of course, a Lamarckian concept that conflicts with Darwini sm. Na thanielsz is one of the scientists now brave enough to invoke the "L" word for Lamarck: " ...th e trans generational passage of characteristics by nongenetic means does occur. Lamarck was righ t, al tho ugh transgenerati onal transmission of acquired characteristics occur s by mechanisms that were unknown in his day."
The responsiveness of individ uals to the env ironmental conditions perceived by theirs mothers before birth allows them to op timize their genetic an d physiologic developm ent as they adapt to the environmental forecast. The same life-enhancing epi genetic plasticity of

The same epigenetic influences also continue after the child is born because parents continue to influence their child's environment. In particular, fascinating new research is emphas izing the importan ce of good parenting in the develop ment of the brain : "For the growing brain of a young chil d, the social wo rld supplies the most important experiences influencing the expression of genes, which determines how neurons connect to one an other in creatin g the neuronal pathways which give rise to mental activity," writes Dr. Daniel J. Siegel in The Developing Mind. [Siegel 1999] In other word s, infants need a nurturing environment to activate the genes that develop healthy brains. Parents, the latest science reveals, continue to act as genetic engineers even after the birth of their child .

afternoon, one of my studen ts sugges ted that it might help if I visited his roo mma te, a fellow student, who was also a chiro practor. As I explained in the last chapter, I no t only had never been to a chiropractor, I had been tau ght by my allopa thic community to shun chiropractors as quacks. But when you' re in that much pain an d you're in an unfamiliar setting, you wind up trying thin gs you would never consider in your cushier moments.
At the chiro practor's make shift dormit ory "office" I was introduced for the first time to kinesiology, popularly known as muscle testing. The chiropractor told me to hold out my arm an d resist the do wnward pr essure he ap plied to it. ] had no problem resisting the light force he put on my arm. Then he asked me to hold out my arm and resist him aga in while I said , "My name is Bruce." Again, I had no tro uble res isting him, but by now I was starting to think that the admonishments of my academic colleagues were right on the mark "This is nuts!" Then, the chiropractor told me to hold out my arm an d resist his pressure while saying earnes tly: "My name is Mary." To my amazement, my arm flop ped down, desp ite my stro ng resistance. "Now wait a minute," I said . "I must not have been resistin g enough, try that again. " So we did, and this time] concentrated even more forcefully on resisting. Nevertheles s, after rep eating, "My name is Mary," my arm sunk like a stone. This student, wh o was now my teacher, explained that when your conscious mind has a belief that is in conflict with a for merly learned "tru th" stored in the subconsc ious mind, the intellectu al conflict expresses itself as a weakening of the bod y's muscles.
To my asto nishment, I realized tha t my conscious mind , which I exercised so confidently in academic settings, was not in control when [ voiced an opinion that di ffered from a truth stored in the un conscious mind . My un conscious min d was un doing the best efforts of my conscious mind to hold up my arm whe n [ claimed my name was Mary.J was amazed to discover that there was another " mind ," ano ther force, that was co-piloting my life.

as Freud had claimed. All in all, my first visit to a chir op ractor turned out to be a life-changing experience. I learned tha t chiropractors could tap into the bod y's innate healing power using kinesiology to target sp inal misalignmen ts. I was able to saunter out of that dorm feeling like a new man after a few simple, vertebral adjustments on the "quack's" table ... all without the use of drugs. And most importan tly, I was introdu ced to the "man behind the curtain," my subconscious

As I left the campus, my conscious mind was awhirl over the implications of the su perior power of my formerly hidd en subconscious mind . I also coupled those musings with my stu dy of quantum physics, which tau ght me that thoughts could propel behavio r mo re efficiently than physical molecules. My subconscious "knew" that my name was not Mary and balked at my insistence that it was. What else d id my subconscious mind "know" and how had it learned it?
To understand better wha t had happened in that chiro practor's office, I first turned to comp arative neur oanatomy which reveals: the lower an organism is on the Tree of Evolution, the less dev eloped its nervou s system and thus the more it relies on pre programmed behavior (natu re). Moths fly towar d the light, sea lu rtles return to specific islands and lay their eggs on the beach at the appropriate time, and the sw allows return to Capistrano on a specific date, yet, as far as we know, none of these organisms have any knowledge of why they engage in those behav iors. The behaviors are inna te; they are gene tically built into the organis m and are classified as ins tincts.
Organisms higher in the Tree have more com plexly integrated nervous sys tems headed by bigger and bigger brains that allow them to acquire intricate beha vioral patterns through experiential learning (nurture) . The comp lexity of this env iro nmental learning m echan ism presumably culmina tes with humans, who are at the top, or at least near the top, of the Tree. To quote anthro po logists Em ily A. Sch ultz and Robert H. Lavend a: "H uman beings are more dependen t on learning for surv ival than other species. We have no instincts that autom at

Scientists have focused on our big brains as the reason for our ability to learn such complex behavior . However, we should temper our enthusiasm for the big brain theory by considering that cetaceans (porpoises and dolphins) have a greater cerebra l sur face are a packed into their crani ums than we do.
And the findings of British neurologist Dr. John Lorber, highlighted in a 1980 article in Science, "Is your Brain Really Necessary?" also call into qu estion the notion that the size of the brain is the most important consideration for human intellige nce. [Lewin 1980] Lorber stu died many cases of hydrocephalus ("water on the brain") an d conclud ed that even when most of the brain' s cerebral cortex (the brain 's

We do ha ve, of course, behavioral instincts that are innate - consider the infant's instinct to suckle, to quickly move his hand away from fire, and to automatically swim when placed in wa ter. Instincts are built in behaviors that are fun damental to the survival of all humans, independen t of what culture they belong to or wha t time in hu man history they were born. We are born with the ability to swim; infants can swim like graceful porpoises moments af ter they are born. But children qui ckly acquire a fear of water from their parentsobserv e the response of parents when their un attended child ventures near a pool or other open wa ter. Children learn from their parents that water is dan gerous. Parents must later struggle to teach Johnny how to swim. Their first big effort is focused on overcoming the fear of wa ter they instilled in earlier years .
But through evo lution, our learned perceptions have become mo re powerful, especially becau se they can override genetically programmed instincts. The body's physiological mechanisms (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, blood flowI bleeding pa tterns , body temperature) are by their nature, pro grammed instincts. However, yogis as well as everyday people using biofeedback can learn to consciously regulate these "innate" functions.

outer layer) is missing, pa tients can live normal lives. Science wr iter Roger Lewin quotes Lorber in his article :
"There's a young stu de nt at this university [Sheffield University] who has an lQ of 126, has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is socially completely normal. And yet the boy has vir tually no brain ...When we did a brain scan on him, w e saw that instead of the normal 4.5 centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thin layer of man tle measuring a millimeter or so. His cranium is filled mainly with cerebrosp inal fluid ."
Lorber's provocative find ings suggest that we need to reconsider our long-held beliefs about how the brain works an d the physical founda tion of human intelligence. [ submit in the epilogue of this book that human intelligence can only be fully understood when we include spiri t ("energy") or wha t qu antum physics-savvy psychologists call the "superconscious" min d. But for the moment, I' d like to stick to the conscious and subconscious minds, concepts that psychologists and psychiatrists have long grappled with. I'm grappling with it here to provide the biological foundation for conscious parenting as well as energy-based psychological healing methods .
Human Programming:
When Good Mechanisms Go Bad
Let's go back to the evolutionary challenge for human beings , who have to learn so much so quickly to survive and become a part of their social comm unity. Evolu tion has endowed our brains with the ability to rapidly downl oad an unim aginab le number of behaviors and beliefs into our memory. Ongoing research suggests that a key to un derstanding how this rapid downl oading of informa tion works is th e brain's fluctua ting electrical activity as measured by electroencephalograms. The literal definition of electroencephalograms (EEGs) is "electric head pictures." These increas ingly sophis ticated head p ictures reve al a graded ran ge of brain activity in human beings.

and children displa y EEG variations that range from low frequency Deltawaves throu gh high frequ ency Beta waves. However, researchers have noted that EEG activity in children reveals, at every dev elopmental stage, the predominance of a specific brain wave.
Dr. Rima Laibow in Quantitative EEG and Neurofeedback describes the progression of these developmental stages in brain activity. [Laibow 1999 and 2002) Between birth and two years of age, the human brain predominantly operates at the lowest EEG frequ ency, 0.5 to 4 cycles per second (Hz), known as Delta waves. Though Delta is the ir predominant wave activity, babies can exhibit periodic short bursts of higher EEG activity. A child begins to spend more time at a higher level of EEG activity characterized as Theta (4-8 Hz) betw een two and six years of age. Hypnotherapists dro p their pati ents' brain activity into Delta and Theta becau se these low frequency brain waves put them into a more suggestible, programmable state.
This gives us an important clue as to how children, whose brains are mostly opera ting at these sam e frequ encies between birth and six years of age, can download the incredible volume of inform ation they need to thrive in their environment. The ability to process this vast quantity of information is an important neurologic ada ptation to facilitat e this information-intense pro cess of encultura tion. Human environments and social mores change so rapidly that it would not be an advantage to transmit cultural beha viors via gene tically programmed instincts. Young children carefully observe their environment and download the wo rldly wisdom offered by pa rents dir ectly into their su bconscious memory . As a result, their parents ' behavio r and beliefs become their ow n.
Researchers at Kyoto University's Prim ate Research Institute have found that baby chim ps also learn by simply observ ing their mothers. In a series of experiments, a moth er was taught to identify the Japan ese characters for a variety of colors. When the Japanese character for a specific color was flashed on a com puter screen, the chimp learned to choose the right color swatch. Upon selecting the right color, the chimp received a coin that she cou ld then pu t in a vending

machine for a fru it treat. During her training process, she was holding her baby close. To the surprise of researchers, one da y, as the mother was retrieving her frui t from the vending machine, the infant chimp activated the computer. When the character appeared on the screen, the chimp selected the correct color, received a coin and then followed his mother to the vendin g machine. The astonished researchers were left to conclude that infants can pick up compl ex skills solely by observati on and don't hav e to be actively coached by their parents. [Science 2001]
In humans as well, the fundamental behaviors, beli efs and atti tud es we observe in our parents become "hard-wired" as synaptic pathways in our subconscious minds. Once programmed into the subconscious mind , they con trol our biolo gy for th e rest of our lives... unl ess we can figure out a way to reprogram them . Anyone who doubts the sophis tication of this downloading should think about the first time your child blurted ou t a curse word picked up from you. I'm sure you noted its sophistication, correct pronunciation, its nuanced style and context carrying your signature.
Given the precision of this behavior-recording system, imagine the consequences of hearing your parents say you are a "s tup id child," you "do not des erve things," will "never amount to anything," "never should ha ve been born " or are a "sickly, weak" person. When unthinking or un caring parents pass on those messages to their young children, they are no doubt oblivious to the fact that such comments are downloaded into the subconscious memory as absolute "facts" just as sur ely as bits an d bytes are downloa ded to the hard dri ve of your desktop computer. During early development, the child's consciousness has not evolved eno ugh to critically assess tha t those parental pronouncements were only verbal barbs and not necessarily tru e characterizations of "self." Once programmed into the subconscious mind, howev er, these verbal abuses become defined as "truths" that unconsciously shape the behavior and potentia l of the child through life.

(8-12 HZ). Alpha activity is equa ted with states of calm consciousness . While most of our senses, such as eyes, ears and nose, observe the outer world , consciousness resembl es a "sense organ" that behaves like a mirror reflecting back the inn er workings of the bod y's own cellular community; it is an awareness of "self."
At aro und tw elve years of ag e, the chi ld's EEG spectr um begins to show sustained periods of an eve n higher freq uenc y defined as BetlL waves (12-35 H z). Beta bra in sta tes are characterized as "active or focused cons cious ness, " th e kind of brain activity use d in reading this book. Recently, a fifth, higher state of EEG activity has been defined. Referred to as Gamma waves (>35Hz), this EEG frequency range kicks in during states of " pea k performance," such as whe n pilots are in the process of lan ding a plane or a professional tennis player is engaged in a rap id-fire volley .
By the time children reach adolescence, their subconsc ious minds are chock-full of information that range from the knowled ge of how to walk, to the "knowledge" they will never amoun t to anything, or the knowled ge, fostered by loving parents, they can do any thing they set out to do. The sum of our genetically programmed instincts an d the beliefs we learned from our parents collectively form the sub conscious mind, whi ch can undo both our ability to keep our arm raised in a chiropractor's office and our best New Year's resoluti ons to stop sabo taging ourselves wi th drugs or food .
Again I go back to cells, which can teach us so much abou t ourselves. I've said many times that single cells are intelligent. But remember, when cells band together in creating multicellular comm unities, they follow the "collective voice" of the organism, even if that voice dictates self-des tructive behavior. Our physiology and behav ior patterns conform to the " tru ths" of the central voice, be they constructive or des tructive beliefs.
I've described the power of the subconscious min d, bu t I want to emphasize that there is no need to consider the subconscious a scary, supe r-powerful, Freudian font of destructive "knowledge." In reality, the subconscious is an emotionless database of stored programs,

whose function is strictly concerned with reading env ironmen tal signals an d engagi ng in hard-wired behav ioral programs, no ques tions asked, no judgments mad e. The subconsc ious mind is a programmable "har d dri ve" into which our life experiences are downl oad ed. The programs are fundamentally hardwired stimulus-respo nse behaviors. Behavior activatin g stimuli may be signa ls the nervo us system detects from the external world and! or signals that arise from within the body such as emo tions, pleasur e and pain. When a stimulus is p erceived, it will automa tically engage the behavioral response that wa s learn ed when the signa l wa s first experi enced . In fact peop le Who realize the automated nature of this playback response frequently adm it to the fact tha t their "buttons have been p ushed ."
Before the evolution of the conscious mind, the fun ctions of animal brains consisted only of th ose th at we link with the subconscious mind. These more primi tive minds were simp le stim ulus-response devices that automati cally responded to environmental stim uli by engaging genetically programmed (instincts) or sim ple learn ed beha viors. These animals do not "consciously" evoke such behaviors, an d in fact, may even be oblivious to them. Their beha viors are programmed reflexes, like the blink of an eye in response to a puf f of air or the kick of a leg after tap ping the knee joint.

The evolution of higher mammals, including chimps, cetaceans and humans, bro ugh t forth a new level of awareness called "self-consciousness," or, sim ply, the conscious mind . The newer conscious mind is an importan t evo lutionary advance. The earlier, su bconscious min d is our "autopilot"; the conscious mind is our manual control. For example, if a ball comes near your eye, the slower conscious mind ma y not have time to be aware of the threatening projectile.

The two min ds make a dynamic d uo. Operatin g together, the conscious mind can use its resources to focus on some specific point, such as the party you are going to on Friday ni ght. Simultaneously, your subconscious mind can be safely pushin g the lawn mower around and successfully not cuttin g off your foot or running over the cat - even though you are not consciously paying attention to mowing the lawn.
The tw o minds also coope rate in acquir ing very complex beha viors that can subsequently be unconsciously managed. Remember th e first day you excitedly sat in the dri ver's seat of a car, preparing to leam how to drive? The number of things that had to be dealt with by the conscious mind was staggering. While keeping your eyes on the roa d, you had to also watch the rear and side view mirrors, pa y attention to the speedome ter and other gauges, use two feet for the thr ee pedals of a standard shift vehicle an d try to be calm, cool and collected as you drove past observing peers. It took w hat seemed to be a long time before all these beh aviors were" programmed" into your mind.
Today, you get in the car, tum the igni tion on and conscio usly review your shopping list as the subconscious mind du tifully engages all the complex skills you need to successfully navigate thr ough the city - without even once havin g to think about the mechani cs of dr iving . I know I am not the only one out there who has experienced this. You are dri vin g an d having a delightful discussion w ith the passenger sitting next to you. In fact, your conscio usness gets so caught up in the conversa tion, that somewhere down the road it dawns on you that you haven't even paid attention to your driving for five minutes. After a moment ary start, you realize that you are still on your side of the road and steadily moving along with the flow of tralfi c. A quick check of the rear view mirror reveals that you did not leave a wake of crumpled stop signs and smashed mailboxes. If you weren't consciously driving the car during that time, then who was? The subconscious mind! And how well did it do? Although you didn't observe its beha vior, the sub

conscious mind apparen tly performed just as well as it was taught during your driver education experience.
In addition to facilitating subconscious habitual programs, the conscious mind also has the po wer to be spontaneously creative in its responses to environmental stim uli. In its self-reflective capacity, the conscious mind can observe behaviors as they're being carried out. As a preprogrammed behavior is unfolding, th e observing conscious mind can step in, stop the behavior and create a new response. Thus the conscious mind offers us free will, meaning we are no t just victims of our programming. To pull that off however, you have to be fully conscious lest the programming take over, a difficult task, as anyone who's tried willpower can attest. Subconscious programming takes over the moment your conscious mind is not paying atte ntion.
The conscious mind can also think forward and backward in time, while the subconscious mind is always operating in the present moment. When the conscious mind is busy daydreaming, crea ting future plans or reviewing past life experiences, the subconscious mind is always on duty, efficiently managing the behaviors required at the moment, witho ut the need of conscious supervision.
The two minds are tru ly a phenomenal mechanism, but here is how it can go awry. The conscious mind is the "self," the voice of our ow n thoughts. It can have great visions an d plans for a future filled with love, heal th, happiness and prosp erity. While we focus our consciousness on happy thoughts , who is running the show? The subconscious . How is the subconscious going to manage our affairs? Precisely the way it was programmed . The su bconscious mind 's behaviors when we are not pa ying attention may not be of our own creation because most of our fundamental behaviors wer e download ed without qu estion from observ ing other people. Because subconscious-generated behaviors are not genera lly observed by the conscious mind, many people are stunned to hear that they are "just like their mom or their dad," the people who programmed their subconscious minds.

conscious mind . The biggest impediments to realizing the successes of w hich we dream are the limitations programmed into the subconscious. These limitations not only influ ence our behavior, they can also play a major role in determining our physiology and health . As we've seen earlier, the mind plays a powerful role in controlling the biological systems that keep us alive.
Nature did n ot intend the presence of the dual minds would be our Achilles heel. In fad, this duality offers a wond erfu l adv an tage for our lives.

The Subconscious Mind:
I Keep Cal ling and No One Answers
While the " thinking-self' nature of the conscious mind evokes images of a "ghost in the machine," there is no similar self-awareness operating in the subconscious mind . The latter mechanism is more akin to a jukebox loaded with beha vioral programs, each ready to play as soon as appropriate env ironmental signals appear and press the selection buttons. If we don't like a particular song in the jukebox, h ow much yelling at or arguing with the machine will cause it to reprogram its play list? In my college days, I saw many an inebriated stu dent, to no avail, cur se and kick jukeboxes that were not resp onsive to their requ ests. Similarly, we must realize that no amount of yelling or cajoling by the conscious mind can ever change the behavioral " tapes" pro grammed into the subconsc ious mind . Once we realize the ineffectiveness of this tactic, we can qui t engaging in a pitched battle w ith the subconscious mind an d take a mo re clinical approach to reprogramming it. Engaging the subconscious in battle is as pointless as kicking the jukebox in the hope that it will reprogram its play list.

The futility of battling with the subconscious is a hard message to get across because one of the program s most of us downl oad ed when we we re young is that "will power is ad mirable." So we try over and over again to override the subconscious program. Usually such efforts are met with vary ing degrees of resistance because the cells are obligated to ad here to the subconscious program.
Tensions betw een conscious will power and subconscious programs can result in serious neurological disorders. For me, a pow erful imag e of why we should not challenge the su bconscious comes from the movie "Shine." In the movie, based on a tru e story, Australian concert p ianist David Helfgott defies his father by going off to London to study music. Helfgott's father, a survivor of the Holocaust, programmed his son's subconsciou s mind with the belief tha t the world was unsafe, that if he "stood out" it might be life threatenin g. His father insisted he would be safe only if he stayed close to his fami ly.

A Twinkle In Your Parents' Eyes: Conscious
Conception & Conscious Pregnancy
You all know the expression, "When you were only a twinkle in your parents' eyes." A phrase that conjures up the happiness of lovin g parents who truly want to conceive a child. It turns out it is also a phrase.that sums up the latest genetic research suggesting that parents should culti vate that twinkle in th e months before they conceive a child . That growth-promoting awareness an d intention can prod uce a smarter, healthier and happier baby.
Research reveals that parents act as genetic engineers for their children in the mon ths before conception. In the final stages of egg and sperm ma turation, a process called genomic imprin ting adjusts the activity of specific gro ups of genes that will shape the character of the child yet to be conceived . [Surani 2001; Reik and Walter 2001] Research suggests that what is going on in the lives of the parents during the process of genomic imprinting has a profound influence on the mind an d bod y of their child, a scary thought given how unprepared most peopl e are to have a baby .

nant.. .p arents do better when they live in a calm and stable environment free of addictions and supported by family and friends." [Verny and We.intraub 2002] Interestin gly, aboriginal cultu res have recognized the influence of the conception env ironment for millennia. Prior to conceiving a child, couples ceremonially p urify their minds and bodies.
Once the child is conceived, an impressive body of research is documenting how imp ortant parents' attitudes are in the developm ent of the fetus. Again Verny writes: "In fact, the grea t weight of the scientific evidence that has emerged over the last decad e demands that we reevalua te the mental an d emo tional abilities of unb orn children. Awake or asleep, the studies show, they [unborn children] are constantly tuned in to their mother's every action, thought and feeling. From the moment of conceptio n, the experience in the wo mb shapes the brain and lays the groundwork for personality, emo tional temperament, and the power of high er thought. "
Now is the time to stress that the New Biology is not a return to th e old da ys of b1arning mothers for every ailment that medicine didn' t understand - from schizophrenia to autism. Mothers and fathers are in the conception and pregnancy bu siness together, even though it is the mother who carries the child in her womb. What the father does profoundly affects the mother, which in turn affects the developing child. For exam ple, if the father leaves and the mother star ts qu estioning her ow n ability to surv ive, his leavin g profound ly changes the interaction betw een the mother an d th e unb orn baby. Similar ly, societal factors, such as lack of employment, hou sing and healthcare or endless wars that pull fathers into the military, can affect the parents and thus the develop ing child.
The essence of conscious parenting is that both mothers an d fathers ha ve important resp onsibilities for fosterin g healthy, intelligent, productive and joy-filled children. We surely canno t blame our selves, nor our parents for failures in our own or our childre n's lives.

lives, and more importantly, how our behaviors and atti tudes program the Ii ves of our children.
Most obste tricians are also still uneducated about the importance of parental atti tudes in the development of the baby. According to the. notion of genetic de terminism that they were steeped in as medical students, fetal develop men t is mechanically controlled by genes with little ad ditional contribu tion from the mo ther. Conseq uently, Ob-Gyns are only concerned with a few ma ternal prenatal issues: Is she eating well? Taking vitamins? Does she exercise regularly? Those questions· focus on what they believe is the mother's principal role, the p rovision of nutrients to be used by the genetically programmed fetus .
But the developing child receives far more than nutrients from the mo ther's blood . Along with nutrients, the fetus absorbs excess glucose if the mother is diabetic, and excess cortisol and other fight or fligh t hormones if the mo ther is chronica lly stressed. Research now offers insights into how the system wo rks. If a moth er is under stress, she activates her HPA axis, whic h provides fight or flight responses in a threatening environmen t.
Stress hormones prepare the body to engage in a protection response . Once these maternal signals enter the fetal blood stream, they affect the same tar get tissues and organs in the fetus as they did in. the mother. In stressfu l environments, fetal blood preferentially flows to the muscles and hindbrain, providing nutritional requirements needed by the arms and legs, and by the region of the brain responsible for life-saving re.flex behavior. In supporting the function of the pro tection- rela ted systems, blood flow is shu n ted from the viscera organs and stress hormones suppress forebrain function. The development of fetal tissue and organs is proportional to both the amount of blood they receive and the function they provide. When passing through the placenta, the hormones of a mother experiencing chronic stress w ill profoundly alter the distribution of blood flow in her fetu s and change the character of her dev eloping child's physio logy.

At the University of Melbourne, E. Marilyn Wintour' s research on pregnant sheep, who are physiologically quite similar to humans, has foun d that prenatal exposure to cortisol eventually lead s to high blood pressur e [Dod ic, et al, 2002]. Fetal cortiso l levels playa very importan t regulatory role in the development of the kidney's filterin g uni ts, the nephro ns. A nephron's cells are intimately involved with regulating the body's salt balance and consequently are important in controlling blood pressure. Excess cortisol absorbed from a stressed mo ther modifies fetal nephron formation. An additio nal effect of excess cortisol is that it Simultan eously swi tches the mother' s and the fetus' system from a growth state to a protection posture. As a result, the growthinhibiting effect of excess cortisol in the womb causes the babies to be born smaller.
Suboptimal conditions in the wo mb that lead to low birth-weight babies have been linked to a number of ad ult ailments that Nathanielsz outlines in his book Life I/1 The Womb, [Nathanielsz 1999] including diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For exampl e, Dr. David Barker [ibid.] of England's University of Southampton has foun d that a male w ho weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth has a 50% greater chance of dying of heart disease than one with a higher birth weigh t. Harvard researchers hav e found that women who weigh less than 5.5 pounds at birth have a 23 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease than women born heavier. And David Leon [ibid.] of the London School of Hygiene and Trop ical Medicine has foun d that diabetes is three times more common in 60-year-old men who were small and thin at birth.
The new focus on the influences of the prenatal environment extends to the stu dy of IQ w hich genetic determinists and racists once link ed simply to genes . But in 1997, Bernie Devlin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, carefully analyzed 212 earlier studies that compared the IQs of twins, siblings, and parents and their children. He concluded that genes account for only forty-eight percent of the factors that determine IQ. And when the synergistic effects of mingling the mother and father' s genes are factor ed in, the true inherited component of intelligence plummets even further, to thirty-four percent. [Devlin, et al, 1997; McGue 1997]

Devlin, on the other hand, found that conditions during prenatal development significantly impact IQ. He reveals that up to fifty-one percent of a child 's potential intelli gence is controlled by environmental factors. Previous studies had alread y found that drinking or smoking during pregnancy can cause decreased IQ in children, as can exposure to lead in the womb. The lesson for people who wan t to be parents is that you can r adically shortchange the intelligence of your child simply by the way you approach pregnancy. These IQ changes are not accidents; they are directly linked to altered blood flow in a stresse d brain .
In my lectures on consciou s parenting, I cite research, but I also show a video from an Italian conscious parenting organization, Associazione Nazi onale Educazione Prenatale, which graphically illustrates the interdependent relation ship between parents and their unborn child. In this video, a mother and father engage in a loud argument while the woman is undergoing a sonogram. You can vividly see the fetus jump when the argument star ts. The startled fetus arches its body and jumps up , as if it were on a trampoline when the argument is punctuated with the shattering of glass. The powe r of modern technology, in the form of a sonogram, helps to lay to rest the myth that the unborn child is not a sophisticated enough organis m to react to anything oth er than its nutritional environment.

You may be wondering why evoluti on wo uld provide such a system for fetal development that seems so frau ght with peril and is so depend ent on the env ironment of the parents. Actua lly, it' s an ing eniou s sys tem that helps ensure the survival of your offspring. Eventua lly, the child is going to find itself in the same env ironment as its parents. Information acquired from the parents' perception of their env ironment transits the placenta and primes the prena te's physiology, preparin g it to more effectively deal with future exigencies that will be encoun tered after birth.

science,parents now ha ve a choice. They can carefully reprogram their limitin g beliefs about life before they bring a child into their world.
The importance of parental programming undermines the notion that our traits, both positive and negati ve, are fully de termined by our genes. As we ha ve seen, genes are sha ped, guided and tailored by environmental learning experiences . We have all been led to believe that arti stic, athletic an d intellectua l prowess are traits simply passed on by genes. But no matter how "good" one's genes may be, if an individual's nurture experiences are fraught with abuse, ne glect or mispercep tions, the realization of the genes ' po tentials will be sabotaged. Liza Minelli acquired her genes from her superstar moth er Judy Garland and her father filmma ker Vincent Minelli. Liza's career, the heights of her star dom and the lows of her personal life, are scripts that were played out by her parents and downl oad ed into her subconscious min d. lf Liza had the same genes, but was raised by a nur turing Pennsylvania Dutch farming famil y, that environment would have epigene tically triggered a different selection of genes. The genes that ena bled her to purs ue a successful entertainment caree r wo uld have likely been masked or inhibited by the cul tural demand s of her agrarian community.
A wonde rful exam ple of the effectiveness of conscious par enting programming is superstar golfer Tiger Woods. Althou gh his father was not an accomplished golfer, he made every effort to immerse Tiger in an env iro nment that was rich with op portuni ties to develop an d enh ance the mindset, skills, attitu des and focus of a master golfer. No do ubt, Tiger's success is also intimately connected with the Buddhist philosoph y that his mother contributed. Indeed, genes are important - but their imp ortance is only realized thro ugh the influence of conscious parenting and the richness of opportuni ties pro vid ed by the environment.

After one lecture, an older wo man in the aud ience was so d istress ed by my conclusion that she brought her h usband backs tage and in tears vehemently con tested my conclus ion . She did not want any part of some of the traged ies she had experi
enced . This wo man convince d me that my summary conclus ion had to be modified. I rea lized that I didn't want to contribute to foisting blame and gu ilt on any ind ividual. As a society, we are too apt to wallow in gui lt or scapegoat others for our pro blems. As we gain insights ove r a lifetime, we become better equippe d to take charge of our lives. After some deliberation, this woman from the aud ience happily accep ted the following resolution: You are personally resp onsible for everything in your life, once you become aware that you are personally responsible for every thing in your life. One cannot be" guilty" of being a poor parent unless one is already aware of the above-described information and disregards it. Once you becom e aw are of this informa tion , you can begin to apply it to reprogram your behavior.
And while we're on the subject of myths abo ut parenting , it is absolu tely not true that you are the same parent for all of your children. Your second child is no t a clone of the first child. The same things are no t happening in your wo rld that happened when the first child was born . As I said above,1 once thou ght that I wa s the same paren t for my first child as I was for my very d ifferen t second child. But
when I ana lyzed my parenting, r found that was not tru e. When my first child was born, I was at the beginning of my graduate school training, which was for me, a difficult transition fraught with a high workload accompanied by high insecuri ty. By the time my second da ug h ter was born, I was a more confident, more accomplished research scien tist rea dy to star t my academic career. I had more time and more psychic energy to paren t my second child and to better paren t my first d au ghter, who was now a tod dler.

Parent-Magical Child makes it clear that play not programming is the key to optimiz ing the learning and performance of infan ts and childre n. (Mendizza and Pearce 2001] Children need parents who can playfully foster the cur iosity, creativity and wonder that accom panies their children into the world.
Obv iously, what humans need is nurture in the form of love and the ability to observe older hum an s going abou t their everyday lives. When babies in orphanages, for exam ple, are kep t in cribs and only prov ided with food but not one-on-one smiles and hugs, they develop long-lasting developmen tal problems. One stu dy of Romanian orphans by Mary Car lson, a neurob iologist at Harvard Med ical Schoo l, concluded that the lack of touching and attention in Romanian orphanages and poor-quality day-care centers stunted the children's growth and adve rsely affected their behavior. Carlson, who studied sixty Romanian chi ldren hom a few months to three years of age, measur ed their cortisol levels by analyzing sam ples of saliva , The more stressed a child was, as determined by the higher than normal levels of cortisol in its blood , the po orer the outcome for the child .

sive touch are inevitably violent in nature. One of the differences between popul ations is that many of the children not receiving touch suffer from soma tosenso ry affective disorder . This disorder is characterized by an inability to physiologically suppress surging levels of stress horm ones, a precursor to violent episodes.
These findings p rovide insight into the violence tha t pervades the United States. Rather than endorsing physical closeness, our current medical and psychol ogical practi ces often disco urage it. From the unnatural intervention of med ical doctors in the natural process of birthing, for exam ple, separating the neon ate for extensive periods from the parents into distant nurseries, and the advising of p arents not to res pond to their bab ies cries for fear of spoiling them. Such practices, presumably based upon "science," un doubtedly contribute to the violence in OUI civilization. The research regardin g touch and its relationshi p to violence is described in full at the following website: w ww.violence.de .
But wha t about the Romani an child ren who come ou t of deprived backgroun ds and become what one researcher called "the resilient w ond ers." Why do some children thrive despite their backgrounds? Because they hav e "better" genes? By now you know that I don't believe that. More likely, the birth parents of these resilient wonders provided a more nurturing pre- and perinatal environm ent, as well as good nutrition at crucial points in the child's development.
The lesson for adoptive par ents is that they should not p retend their children's lives began when they came int o their new surroundings. Their child ren may have already been programmed by their birth parents with a belief that they are unwan ted or unlovable. If more fortunate, they may ha ve, at some crucial age in their development, received positive, life-affirming messages from their caretakers . If adoptive parents are not aware of pre- and perin atal programming, they may not deal realistically with post-ado ption issues. They ma y not realize that their children did not come to them as a "blank slate" anymore than newborns come into the wo rld as blank slates, unaffected by their nin e months in their mothe rs' wo mb. Better to recognize that programming and to wor k, if necessary, to change it.

For adoptive and n on-ad op tive parents alike, the message is clear: Your children's genes reflect only their potential, not their destiny. It is up to you to provide the environment that allows them to develop to their highest potential.
No tice I do not say that it is up to parents to read lots of parentin g books. I've met lots of people who are intellectuall y attracted to the ideas I present in this book. But intellectual interest is not enough. I tried that myself. I was intellectually aw are of everything in this book, but before I mad e the effort to change, it m ad e no impact on my life. If you simply read this book an d think that your life and your children's lives will change, you're doing the equi valent of accepting the latest pharmaceutical pill thinking it will " fix" every thing. 0 one is fixed until they m ake the effort to change.
Here is my challenge to you . Let go of unfounded fears and take care not to implant unnecessary fears and limiting beliefs in your children's subconscious minds. Most of all, do not accept the fatalistic message of genetic determinism. You can he lp your children reach th eir potential and you can change your personal life. You are not "stuck" wi th your genes.
Take heed of the growth and protection lessons from cells and shift your lives into grow th w henever possible. And re member that for human beings the most potent grow th-pro moter is not the fanciest school, the biggest toy or the highest-paying job.

EP ILOGUE
SPIRIT AND SC IENCE
The most beautiful and profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the power ofall true science.
- Albert Einstein
We' ve come a long way since Chapter 1, when I faced my panicked medical students and started my journey to the ew Biology. But throughout the book I have not strayed far from the theme I introduced in the first chap ter - that smart cells can teach us how to live. Now that we' re at the end of the book, I'd like to explain how my study of cells turned me int o a spiritual person. I also want to explain why I am optimistic about the fate of our planet, though I concede that optimis m is sometimes hard to main tain if you read the daily newspaper.
I'v e specifically separated my discussion of Spirit and Science from the preceding chapters of the book by entitling this section the Epilogue. An epilogue is generally a short section at the end of the work tha t details the fate of its character. ..in this case moi. When the awareness tha t prompted this book first came into my head twenty years ago, I saw something in it that was so profound it immediately transformed my life. In the first instant of my big "aha," my brain wa s reve ling in the beau ty of the newly envisioned mechanics of the cell memb rane. A few heartbeats later I was overtaken by a joy that was so deep and wide, my heart ached and tears flowed from my eyes. The mechanics of the new science revealed the existence of our spiri tual essence and our immortality . For me, the conclusions were so unambiguou s I instantly went from non-believer to believer.
I know tha t for some of you the conclusions I am going to present in this section are too speculative . Conclusions drawn in the previous chapters of the book are based upon a quarter of a century of studying cloned cells and are gro unded in the astonishing new discoveries that are rewriting our understanding of the mysteries of life. The conclusions I offer in this Epilogue are also based upon my scientific train

lng-they do not spring from a leap of religious faith. I know conventional scientists may shy away from them, becau se they inv olve Spirit, but I am confide nt in presenting them for two reasons.
One reason is a philosophical an d scientific rule called Occam's razo r. Occam's razor holds that when several hypoth eses are offered to explain a phenomenon, the sim plest hyp oth esis that accounts for most of the observations is the most likely hyp othesis and sho uld be considered first. The new science of the magical mem-Brain in conjunction with the principles of quantum ph ysics offer the simplest explana tion th at accoun ts for the science of not only allopathic medicine, but also for the philosophy and practice of complementary medicine and spiritual healing as well. Also, after so many years of persona lly applying the science I have outlined in this book, I can attest to its power to cha nge lives.
However, I concede that while science led me to my euphoric moment of insight, the expe rience resembled instantaneous conversions described by mystics. Remember the biblical story of Saul who was kn ocked off his horse with a lightning bolt? For me, there was no lightning bolt that came forth from the Caribbea n skies. But I ran wildeyed into the medical library becau se the nature of the cell's membrane that was "downl oaded" into my awareness in the wee hours of the morning convinced me that we are immo rtal, spiritual beings who exist se parately from our bodi es. I had heard an un deniable inner voice informing me that I wa s leadin g a life based not only on the false premise that genes control biology, but also on the false premise that we end when our physica l bod ies die. I had spent years stu dying molecular control mechanisms within the physical body an d at that astoundin g m oment came to realize that the protein "switches" that control life are primarily turned on and off by signals from the environment. ..the Universe.
You may be sur prised that it was science that led me to that moment of spiritual insight. In scientific circles, the word "spirit" is as warmly embraced as the word "evo lution" is in fund amentalist circles. As yo u know, sp iritua lists and scientists ap proach life in vastly differ

en t ways. When life is out of whack for spiritu alists, they beseech God or some other invisibl e force for relief. When life is out of whack for scientists, th ey run to th e m edicine cabinet for a che mical. It is only with a drug like Rolaid s" th at th ey are able to spe ll relief.
The fact th at science led me to spi ritual ins igh t is appropriate becau se th e latest discoveries in physics and cell resear ch are forging new links between the wo rlds of Science.and Spirit. These rea lms we re split apa rt in th e d ays of Descartes cen turies ago. How ever, I truly believe that only when Spirit and Science are reu nited will we be afforde d the m eans to crea te a better wo rld .
A Time of Choice
The latest science lead s us to a wo rld view not unlike th at held by th e earliest civiliza tions, in which every m aterial object in Natu re was th ou ght to p ossess a spirit. The Unive rse is still tho u gh t of as One by th e small number of aborigines w ho survive. Aboriginal cu ltures db not m ake the usu al di stin ctions a mong rocks, air and hu m an s; all are im bue d with spirit, th e invisible energy. Doesn 't this sound familiar? This is th e wo rld of quan tu m physics, in which m atter and energy are completely entangled . An d it is th e wo rld of Gaia tha t I spoke of in Chapter 1, a world in which the w ho le planet is consid ered to be one livin g, breathing organism, which needs to be protected from human greed, ign oran ce.and poor planning.
Never h ave we needed th e insigh ts of such a world view more. When Science tu rn ed away from Spirit, its m ission dram atically cha nged . Instead of trying to understand th e "na tural orde r" so th at human beings can live in harmony with th at order, Mo dern Science embarked on a goal of contro l and do mination of Na tu re. The technology th at has res ulted fro m p ur suing this philosophy has brough t human civilization to the brink of spontaneous com bustion by disrupting the web of Natu re . The evolu tion of our biosphere has been punctuated by five " mass extinctions," inclu ding th e one that killed the dinosau rs. Each w ave of extinc tion nearl y w ipe d out all life on th e plan et. Some researchers believe, as I me ntio ne d in Chapter 1, th at we

are "deep" into the sixth mass extinction. Unlike the oth ers caused by galac tic forces such as comets, the current extinction is being caused by a force mu ch closer to home - humans. As you sit on your porch and wa tch the sunset, note its spectacular color. The beau ty in the sky reflects the pollution in the air. As the world we kn ow decays, the Earth promises us an even grea ter light show.
Meanwhile we are leading lives witho ut a moral context. The modern world has shifted from spiritual asp irations to a war for material accum ulation. The one with the most toys wins. My favo rite ima ge for the scientists and techn ologists who have led us into this spiritless world comes from the Disney movie, Fantasia. Remember Mickey Mou se as the hapless apprentice to a powe rful sorcerer? The sorcerer instructs Mickey to do the cho res of the lab while he is aw ay. One of the chores is to fill a gian t cistern with water from a nearb y well. Mickey, who had been observ ing the sorcerer's magic, tries to bypass the chore by applying a spell to a broom, which turns it into a wa terbu cket-carrying lackey.
When Mickey falls asleep, the robotic broom fills and then overfllls the cistern, flooding the lab. Upon awakenin g, Mickey tries to stop the broom. But his knowledge is so limited, he fails and the situation gets even worse. The wa ter takes over, until the sorcerer, who does have the know ledge to quiet the broom, returns and restores balance. Here's how Mickey's predicament is described in the movie: "This piece is a legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice. He was a bright young lad, very anxious to learn the business. As a matter of fact, he was a little too bright because he had star ted practicing some of the boss's magic tricks before learning how to control them ." Today's very bright scientists are "Mickey Mousing around " with our genes and our environment wi thout understanding how interconnected everything on this planet is - a course of action bound to have tragic results.
How did we get to this point? There was a time whe n it was necessary for scientists to sp lit from Spirit, or at least the corruption of Spirit by the Church. This powerful institution wa s in the business of suppressing scientific cliscovery wh en it was at odds with Church

dogm a. It was Nicolaus Copernic us, a savvy politician as well as a gifted astronomer, who launched the Spiri t/Science split when h e released to the public his profound manuscript De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres). The 1543 manu script bold ly declared that the sun, not the Earth, was the center of the "Heavenly Spheres ." This is obvious today, but in Copernicus' time it was heresy, because his new cosmology was at odds wit h an "infallible" Church, which ha d declared the Earth to be the center of God's firmamen t. Copernicus believed that the Inquisition would destro y both him and his heretical beliefs, so he prudently wai ted until he was on his death bed to pu blish his work. His concern for his salety was fully justified . Fifty-seven years later Giordano Bruno, a Dominican monk who had the temerity to speak out and defend Copernicus' cosmology, was burned at the stake for this heresy. Copernicus outsmarted the Church - it is hard to torture an intellectual when he is in his grave. Unable to kill the messenger, the Church eventual ly had to deal with Copernicus's message.
A century later French mathematician an d philosopher Rene Descartes insisted on using scientific methodology to examine the validity of all previousl y accepted "tru ths." The invisible forces of the spiritua l world clearly didn't len d themselves to such analysis. In the post-Reforma tion era, scientists were encourage d to pursu e their stu dies of the natural world and sp iritu al " tru ths" were relegated to the realms of religion and metaphysics. Spirit an d other metaphysical concepts were devalued as "unscientific" because their truths could not be assessed by the analytic methods of science. The important "s tuff" about life and the Universe became the domain of rational scientists.
If the Spirit/Science split needed any more reinfo rcement, it got it in 1859 when Darwin's theory of evolution made an instan t splash. Darwin's theory sp read across the globe like toda y's Interne t rumors. It was read ily accep ted because its princip les dovetailed with peo ple's experiences in breeding pets, farm animals and plants. Darwinism attributed the origins of humanity to the happenstance of hereditary variations, which meant that there was no need to invoke Divine intervention in our lives or our science. Modem scientists were no less

awed by the Universe than the cleric/ scientists who preceded them, but w ith Darwin's theory in hand they no lon ger saw a need to invoke the Hand of God as a grand "designer" of Na ture's complex ord er. Preeminent Darwinist Erns t Mayr wrote: "When we ask how this perfection is brought abo ut, we seem to find only arb itrariness, planlessness, ran do mness, and acciden t.." [Mayr 1976]
While Darwinian theory specifies that the purpose of life's struggles is survival, it does not specify a means that shou ld be used in securing that end. Apparently, "anythin g goes" in the perceived stru ggle becau se the goal is simply survival- by any means. Rather than framing the character of our lives by the laws of morality, the neoDarwinism of Mayr sugges ts that we live our lives by the law of the jungle. Neo -Darwinism essentially concludes that tho se who have more deserve it. In the West, we hav e accepted the inevitability of a civiliza tion that is characterized by the " haves" and the "have-ne ts." We do n't want to deal with the fact that everything in this world has a pri ce. Unfortunately this includes, along with the ailing planet, the hom eless as we ll as the chi ld laborers w ho sew our designer jeans . ..thl!jl are the losers in this struggle.
We Are Made In the
Image of th e U niverse
On that early morning in the Caribbean, I realized that even the "w inn ers" in our Darwinian world are losers becau se we are one with a bigger Unive rse/God. The cell engages in behavior w hen its brain, the membrane, responds to env ironmental signals. In fact, every functional protein in our body is mad e as a complementary" image" of an environmental signa l. If a protein did not have a complementary signal to couple with, it would not function. This means, as I concluded in that "aha !" moment, that every protein in our bodies is a physical/ electromagne tic complement to something in the enviro nment. Because we are machines made out of protein, by definition we are made in the ima ge of the envir onment, that environment being the Universe, or to many, God .
188



Epilogue
Back to the winners and losers. Because humans evo lved as complements of their surroun ding environment, if we chan ge the environme nt too m uch, we will no longer be complementary to it... we won' t "fit." At the moment, humans are altering the planet so dramatically tha t we are thr eatenin g our own survival as well as the survival of
other , rapidly disappearing organisms. Tha t thr eat encompasses Hummer drivers and fast food moguls with lots of money, the "win ners, " along with poverty-stricken laborers, the "losers," in this competition for survival. There are two ways out of this dile mma: to die or mu tate. I think you should seriously ponder this as the need to sell Big Macs leads us to decimate the rain forests; as the staggering num bers of gas-guzzling vehicles foul the air; or as petrochemical industries erode the Earth and pollute the wa ter. We were designed by Nature to fit an environment, but no t the environment we are now makin g.
I learned from cells tha t we are part of a whole and that we forget this at our peril. But I also recogniz ed tha t each one of us has a unique , biological identity . Why ? Wha t makes each person's cellular community unique? On the surface of our cells is a family of iden tity receptors, which distinguish one individu al from another.
A well-studied subset of these receptors, called self-recep tors or human leukocytic an tigens (HLA), are rela ted to the fun ctions of the imm une system . lf your self-receptors were to be rem oved, your cells wo uld no longer reflect your identity. These self-receptor-less cells would still be human cells, but without an identity they would simply be generic h uman cells. Pu t your personal set of self-receptors back on the cells and they again reflect your ide ntity.
When you dona te an organ, the closer y our set of self-receptors ma tch the receptors of the person w ho is to receive the organ, the less aggressive the rejection reaction launched by the recipient ' S immune system. For example, let's say that a set of 100 different self-recep tors on the surface of each cell is used to identify you as an ind ividual. You are in need of an organ graft to sur vive. When my set of 100 self-receptors is compare d to your self-receptors, it turns out that we have only 10 recep tors that match. I would not be a gre at organ do nor for you.
18 9



T h e B iol o g y o f B e l i e f
The very d issimilar nature of our self-receptors reveals tha t our ide ntities are very different. The vast diffe rence in membrane recep tors would m obilize your immune system, shifting it into hyper-drive to elimina te the foreign, i.e., not-self, transpl anted cells. You wo uld have a grea ter chance of success if you cou ld find a don or whose self-receptor s more closely ma tch the ones on your cells.
In your search for a better d onor, how ever, you will not find a perfect 100 per cen t match. So far scienti sts have never found two indi viduals who are biologically the same. However, it is theoretically possible to create uni versal d onor tissues wh en yo u remove the cells' self receptors, thou gh scientists have yet to carry ou t such an experiment. In such an experimen t, the cells would lose their identity. These self-recep tor-less cells would not be rejected . While scien tists ha ve focused on the nature of these immune-related recep tors, it is importan t to note that it is not the protein recep tors, but what activa tes the receptors tha t give individuals their identi ty. Each cell's unique set of iden tify receptors are located on the membrane's outer surface, where they act as "an tennas," downloading complemen tary en vironm en tal sign als. These identity receptors read a signa l of "self," which d oes not exist w ithin the cell bu t comes to it from the extern al environmen tal.
Consi der the human bod y a television set. You are the ima ge on the screen. But your image d id not come from insid e the television. Your iden tity is an en vironm ental broadcas t that was received via an antenna. One day you turn on the TV and the picture tube has blown out. Your first reaction wou ld be, "Oh, #*$?!! The television is dea d." But did the image die along with the television set? To ans wer that qu estion you ge t another television set, plug it in, turn it on and tune it to the station you were watching before the picture tube blew ou t. This exercise w ill demonstrate that the broadcast image is still on the air, even though your first televis ion " died ." The death of the television as the receiver in no wa y killed the iden tity broadcast that comes fro m the en viro nmen t.
In this ana logy, the physical television is the equivalent of the cell. The TV's antenna, w hich d ownload s the bro adcast, rep resen ts ou r fu ll

set of identifying receptors an d the broadcast represent s an environmental signal. Because of our preoccupation with the material New tonian world, we might at first assume that the cell's protein receptors are the "self." That wo uld be the equivalent of believing that the TV's antenna is the source of the broadcast. The cell's recep tors are not the source of its identi ty, but the vehicle by which the "self" is download ed from the envi ronment.
When I fully understood this relationship I reali zed tha t my identity, my "self:' exists in the env ironment whether m y bod y is here or not. Just as in the TV analogy, if my body dies and in the future a new ind ividual (biological " television set") is born who has the same exact set of identity recep tors, that new individual will be downloa ding "me." I will once again be present in the wo rld . Wh en my physical body dies, the broadcast is still present. My identity is a complex signa ture contained w ithin the vast information that collectively comprises the environment.
Suppor ting evidence for my belief tha t an indivi dual 's broadcast is still present even after dea th comes from transplant patients who report that along with their new organs come behavioral and psychological changes. On e conservative, health-conscious New Englan der, Claire Sylvia, was astonished wh en she developed a taste for beer, chicken nu ggets and motorcycles after her heart-lung transplant. Sylvia talked to the donor's famil y and found she had the hear t of an eighteen-year-old motorcycle enthusiast w ho loved chicken nuggets and beer . In her book called A Change of Heart, Sylvia outlines her personal transformational experiences, as well as similar expe riences of other patients in her transplant su pport group. [Sylvia and Novak 1997] Paul P. Pearsall presents a number of other such stories in his book, The Heart's Code: Tapping the Wisdom and Palver of Our Heart Energy. [Pearsall 1998] The accuracy of memories that accompany these transplants is beyond chance or coincidence. One young girl began havin g nightmares of murder after her heart transplant. Her dream s were so vivid that they led to the cap ture of the murderer who killed her do nor.

One theory about how these new behaviors become implan ted into the transplant recipient along wi th the organ is "cellular memory," i.e. the notion that someho w memories are embedde d in cells. You kn ow I have immense resp ect for the intelligence of single cells, but [ have to draw a line here. Yes, cells can " remember" that they are muscle cells or liver cells, but there is a limi t to their intelligence. I do not believe cells are physically endowed with perception mechani sms that can distinguish an d remember a taste for chicken nu ggets!
Psychological an d behavioral memory does make sense if we realize that the transplanted organs still bear the origina l id entity recep tors of the donor and are apparent ly still dow nloading that sam e environmental information. Even though the body of the person who dona ted the organs is dead, their broad cast is still on. They are, as I realized in my flash of insight while mulling over the mechanics of the cellular membrane -immortal, as I believe we all are.
Cells and organ tran splan ts offer a mod el not only for immortality but also for reincarn ation . Consider the possibility that an embryo in the future displays the same set of identi ty receptors that I now possess. That em bryo will be tun ed into my "self." My iden tity is back but playing throu gh a different body. Sexism and racism become ridiculous as well as imm oral w hen you realize that your receptors could wind up on a white person, a black person, an Asian, or a male or female. Becau se the env ironment represents "All That Is" (God) and our self-receptor antenn as downl oad only a narr ow band of the who le spectrum, we all represent a small part of the whole...a small part of God.
Earth Landers
While the TV analogy is useful, it is not a complete one because a television is only a playback device. In the course of our lives, wha t we do alters the environme nt. W e change the environm ent simply by being here. So a more complete way of un derstan din g our relationshi p to Spir it is to compare a hu man to the Martia n rovers "Spirit" and "Opportuni ty" or the other NASA landers we h ave sent to the Moon

and Mars. Humans are not yet able to go physically to Mars, but we reaJJy want to know w hat it wo uld be like to land on Mars. So we send up the equiva len t of a human explorer. Altho ug h the Mars rovers d on't physically resem ble a h uman, they have fun ctions of humans. These vehicles have cameras, which are the "eyes" that see the planet. They have vibration detectors, which are "ears" that hear the planet. They have chemical sens ors, w hich " taste" the planet, etc. So the lander is designed w ith sens ors that can expe rience Mars somewhat as a human would experience it.
But let's look a little more closely at how the Mars rove rs work. The rovers have antennas ("receptors") that are tun ed to receive information broadcasts by a human bein g in the form of a NASA controller. The Earth-bound controller actuaJJy sends information that animates the Mariner on Mar s. But the information is not a one-wa y stree t. The ASA con troller also learns from the lan der, because the vehicle transmits information abou t its Mars experiences back to Earth. The NASA controller interprets the information about the lander's experiences and then applies that new awareness to better navigate the Martian terrain.
You and I are like "Ear th landers" who receive information from an environmen tal con troller/ Spirit. As we live our lives, the experiences of our w orld are sent back to that con troller, our Spirit. So the character of how yo u live your life influ ences the character of your "self." This interaction correspo nds to the concept of karma. When we understand it, we must take heed of the life we live on this planet, because the conseq uences of our life last longer than our bodies. What we do during our lifetime can come back to haunt us, or a futu re version of ourselves.
In the end, these cellular insights serve to empha size the wisdo m of spiritual teachers throughout the ages. Each of us is a spirit in material form. A powerfuI ima ge for this spiritu al truth is the way light interacts with a pri sm.
When a beam of white light goes through a pri sm, the prism's crys tallin e structure diffracts the exiting light so that it ap pears as a

rainbow spectrum. Each color, thou gh a component of the white light, is seen separately because of its uniqu e frequ ency. If you reverse this process by projecting a rainbow spectrum throu gh the crystal, the individual frequ encies will recombine, forming a beam of white light. Think of each human being's id enti ty as an individual color frequ ency within the rainbow spectru m . If we arbitrarily eliminate a specific frequ ency, a color, because we don 't "like it," and then try to put the remaining frequ encies back through the prism, the exiting beam will no longer be white light. By definiti on, white light is composed of all of the frequ encies.
Man y sp iritua l people anticipate the return of White Light to the planet. They imagine that it will come in the form of a unique individual like Buddha, Jesus or Muhammad. However, from my newly acquired spiri tuality, I see that White Light will only return to the planet when every human being recognizes every other hu man being as an indi vidual frequency of the White Light. As long as we keep eliminating or devaluin g other human beings we have decided we don' t like, i.e. destroying frequ encies of the spec trum, we w ill not be able to experience the White Light. Our job is to protect an d nurture each human frequ ency so that the White Light can return.

Fractal Evolution-A Theo ry
We Can Live With
I've explained why I am now a spiri tual scientist. Now I'd like to exp lain why I am an optimist. The story of evolution is, I believe, a story of repeating patterns. We are at a crisis point, but the p lanet has been here before. Evolution has been punctua ted with upheavals, which virtually wip ed out existing species, including the best-known casual ties, the din osaur s. Those upheavals were directly linked to environmental catastrophes just as today's crisis is. As the human population increases, we are competing for space with the other organisms with whom we share the plan et. But the good news is that similar pressures in the past have brought into being a new way of living, and will do so again . We are concluding one evolutionary cycle and preparing to em bark upon ano ther. As this cycle comes to an end, people are becoming understandably ap prehensive and alarmed by the failures in the structures that support civilization. I believe, however, that the "dinosaurs " that are currently raping Na ture will become extinct. The surv ivors will be those who realize that our thou ghtless ways are des tructive to the planet and to us.
Ho w can I be so sure? My certitu de comes from my study of fractal geometry. Here' s a definition of geome try, which will explain why it is important for stu dying the structure of our biosphere. Geometry is a ma thematical assessment of " the way the differen t par ts of something fit together in relation to each other." Until 1975, the only geometry ava ilable for stud y was Euclidean, which was summarized in the thirteen-volu me ancient Greek text, The Elements of Euclid, wri tten aro un d 300 B.C. For spa tially oriented students, Euclidian geometry is easy to un derstand because it deals with structures like cubes and spheres and cones that can be map ped on gra ph paper.
However, Euclidian geometry does not apply to Nature. For example, you cann ot map a tree, a cloud or a mountain using the mathematical form ulas of this geometry. In Nature, most organic and inorganic stru ctures display more irregu lar and chaotic-appearing patterns . These natu ral images can only be created by using the recently
195



The B i ol og y of B el i e f
discovered mathematics called fractal geometry. French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot launched the field of fractal mathematics and geometry in 1975. Like quantum physics, fractal (fractional) geometry forces us to consider those irregular pattern s, a quirkier world of curvy shapes and objects wi th more than three dimensions.
The mathematics of fractals is amazingly simple because you need only one equation, using only simple multiplication an d addition. The same eq ua tion is then repeated ad infinitum. For exam ple, th e "Mandelbrot set" is based on the simple formula of taking a number, multiplying it by itself and then add ing the original number. The result of that equation is then used as the input of the subsequent equ ation; the result of that equation is then used as the input for the next equa tion and so on. The challenge is that even though each equation follows the same formula, these equations mu st be repeated miIlions of times to actually visualize a fractal pattern. The manual labor an d time needed to complete millions of equa tions prevented early mathematicians from recognizing the value of fractal geometry. With the advent of powerful computers Mandelbrot was able to define this new math .
Inhe rent in the geometry of fractals is the creation of ever-repeating, "se lf-similar" patterns nested within one another. You can get a roug h idea of the re pea ting shapes by picturing the eternally popular toy, hand-painted Russian nestin g dolls. Each smaller structure is a miniatu re, but not necessarily an exact version of the larger form . F ractal geometry emphasizes the relationshi p between the patterns in a whole structu re and the patterns seen in part s of a struc ture. For example, the pattern of twigs on a branch resembles the pattern of limbs branchin g off the trunk. The pattern of a major river looks like the patterns of its smaller tribu taries. In the human lun g, the fractal pattern of branching along the bronchus repeats in the smaller bronchioles. The arterial an d venous blood vesse ls and the peripheral nervous system also display similar repea ting patterns.
196



Ep i logue
Are the repetitive images observe d in Natu re simp ly coincidence? I believe the answer is definitely "no." To explain why I believe fractal geometry defin es the structure of life, let' s revisit two points.
First, the story of evo lution is, as I've emphasized many times in this boo k, the story of ascension to higher awareness. Second, in our stu dy of the membrane, we defined the receptor-effector protein complex (IMPs) as the fundamental unit of aw are ness/ intelli gence, Conse quently, the more receptor-effector proteins (the olives in our bread an d butter sandwich model) an organism possesses, th e more awareness it can have and the higher it is on the evolutionary ladder.
However, there are physical restrictions for increa sing the number of receptor-effector proteins that can be packed into the cell's membran e. The cell membrane's thickn ess measures seven to eight nanom eters, the diameter of its phospholipi d bilayer. The average diameter of the receptor-effector "awareness" proteins is approximately the same as the phospholipid s in which they are embedded. Becau se the membrane's thickness is so tightl y defined, you can't cram in lots of IMPs by stacking them on top of one ano ther. You're stuck with a one-pro tein-thick layer . Conseq uently, the only option for increasing the number of aware ness proteins is to increase the surface area of the membrane.
Let' s go back to our membrane "sandwic h" model. More olives mean more aware ness - the more olives you can layer in the sandwich, the smarter the sandw ich. Which has m ore intelligence capacity, a slice of cocktail rye or a large slab of sour dou gh? The answer is simple: the larger the surface area of the bread, the greater the number of olives that can fit into the sandwich. Relating this anal ogy to biological awareness, the more memb rane surface area the cell has, the more protein "olives" it can manage. Evolutio n, the expans ion of aw areness, can then be physically defined by the increase of membrane surface area. Mathematical studies have foun d that fractal geometry is the best way to get the mos t surface area (membrane) within a three-dimensional space (cell). Therefore, evolution becomes a fractal affair.

T h e B i o l o g y of Be l ief
Repeating pa tterns in Na ture are a necessity, not a coincidence, of "fracta l" evo lution.
My point is not to get caught up in the mathematical details of the modeling. There are rep etitive fractal patter ns in Na ture and in evo lution as well. The strikingly bea utif ul, comp uter-generated pictu res that
illus trate fractal patterns should remind us that, des pite our mod ern angst and the seeming cha os of our world, there is orde r in Na ture and there is nothing truly new under the sun. Evolution's repetitive, fractal patt erns allow us to predict th at human s w ill figure out how to expand their consciousness in order to climb an other r ung of the evolutionary ladde r. The exciting, esoteric w orld of fractal geometry p rovides a mathematical mod el that suggests that the "arbitrariness, planl essness, rando mness, and acciden t" that Mayr wrote about is an outmoded concept. In fact, I believe it is an idea that d oes not serve humanity and should, as rapidly as possible, go the way of the preCope rnican Earth-centered Universe.
Once we realize that there are repeating, ordered pa tterns in Nature and evolu tion, the lives of cells, which inspired this book and the cha nges in my life, become even m ore instructive. For billion s of years, cellula r livin g sys tems have been carrying out an effective peace plan that enables them to enhance their survival as we ll as the survival of the other organis ms in the biosphere. Imagine a population of trillions of individuals living under one roof in a state of perpetual happiness. Such a communi ty exists -it is called the healthy human body. Clearly cellular communities w ork better than human communities there are no left-out, "ho meless" cells in our bodies. Unle ss of course, our cellular commu nities are in profound disharmony caus ing some cells to w ith draw from coopera ting with the community. Cancers essen tially represent homeless, jobless cells that are livin g off the other cells in the comm unity.
If humans were to mod el the lifesty le displayed by healthy com muniti es of cells, our societies an d our planet wo uld be more peaceful and vital. Creating such a peaceful comm unity is a challenge becau se every person perceives the wo rld d ifferently. So essentially, there are
198



Ep i lo gue
six billion human versions of reality on this planet, each perceiving its own truth. As the population grows, they are bumping up against each oth er.
Cells faced a similar challenge in early evo lution as described in Cha p ter 1, but the point bears repeating. Shortly after the ear th was formed, single-celled organisms rapidly evolved . Thousands of variations of unicellular bacteria , algae, yeast and protozoa, each with varying levels of awareness, appeared ove r the next three-an d-a-half billion years. It is probable that like us, those singl e-celled organisms began to multiply seemingly out of contro l and to over-p opulate their envi ronment. They began to bump up against each other and wonder , "Will there be enough for me?" It must have been scary for them, too . With that new, enfo rced closen ess an d the consequent chan ge in their env ironmen t, they searche d for an effective response to their pressures. Those pressures led to a new and glorious era in evolution, in whi ch single cells join ed together in altruistic multicellular communities. The end result was humans, at or near the top of the evolutionary ladde r.
Similarly, I believe that the stresses of the increasing human population will be responsible for pushin g us up another run g on the evolutionary ladder. We will, I believe, com e together in a global comm uni ty. The members of that enlightened community will recognize that we are made in the image of our environment, i.e. that we are Divine and that we have to operate, not in a survival of the fittest manner, but in a way that supports everyone and everything on this planet.
Survival of the Most Loving
You may agree that Rumi' s words on the power of love are nob le ones, but you may not believe that they fit these troubl ed times, when survival of the fittest may seem more appropriate. Isn't Darwin right that violence is at the core of life? Isn' t violence the way of the natural world? What abou t aU those documentaries th at show animals stalking animals, animals snaring animals, animals killing animals? Don't humans possess an inb orn inclination to violence? The logic goes:
199



Th e B io lo gy of Belief
Anima1s are violen t, humans are animals, and ther efore humans are violen t.
No ! Humans ar e no t "stuc k" w ith an innate, vicious ly competitiv e nature any more th an we are stuck with genes that make us sick or make us violent. Ch imps, who are th e closest to humans gene ti
cally, offer evid ence that violence is not a necessar y part of our biology. One species of chi mps, th e bon ob os, create peaceful communities with co-dominan t ma les and fema les in charge . Unli ke other chimps, the community of bon ob os ope ra tes no t with a violence-driven ethic bu t an ethic that can be d escribed as "make love, not w ar ." When the chimps in thi s society becom e agi tated, they d on 't engage in blood y fights; the y diffuse their divisive energy by having sex.
Recent rese arch by Stanford University biologists Robert M. Sap olsky and Lisa }. Share has found that even wild baboon s, among the most aggressive animals on this planet, are no t genetically mandated to be violent. [Sap olsky and Share 2004] In one well-studied baboon troop, the aggreSSive ma les died ou t from con taminated me at they foraged from a tourist gar bage pit. In the wake of their d eaths the social structure of the troop was reinvented. Research suggests that fema les he lped steer the remaining, less aggreSSive males into more coopera tive behaviors, which led to a uniquely peaceful community. In an editorial in Public Library of Science Biology where the Stanford research was p ublished, chimp researcher, Frans B. M. de Waa l of Emory University, wrote: " ... even the fierces t p rimates do not for eve r need to stay this way." [deWaal2004]
In ad dition, no ma tter how many National Geographic specials you've wa tche d, there is no do g-eat-d og imperative for humans. We are at the top of the preda tor/pre.y food chain. Our survival is d ependen t on eating organisms lower in the hierarchy, but w e are not subject to bein g eaten by organisms high er in the chain. Witho ut natural pred ators, humans are sp are d from becoming "pr ey" and from all the violence that the ter m implies.
200



Epi logue
Tha t does not mean that humans are outside the laws of Nature, of course, for eventua lly, we too shall be eaten. We are mortal and following our demise, one wo uld hope after a long and violence-free life, our corporeal remain s will be cons ume d and recycled back to the environment. Like a sna ke turning on itself, humans at the top of the food
chain will eventually be devoured by organisms that are the lowest in the chain , the bacteria.
But before that snake turns, we may not live a violence-free life. Despite our lofty position on the food chain, we are our own worst enemy . More than any other animal, we turn on ourselves. Lowerlevel animals some times tum on themselves, but most aggressive encoun ters am ong members of the sam e species are limited to thr eatening postures, sounds and scents, not dea th. And in social populations other than humans, the primary cause of intraspecies violence is either the acquis ition of air, wa ter and food require d for survival, or the selection of mates for propagation .
In contrast, the violence am ong humans that is directly linked to securing sustenance or in the process of mate selection is quite minimal . Human violence is more often associated with the acquisition of material possessions beyond w hat is necessary for sus tenance or the distribution and purchase of drugs to escape the nightmare world we have crea ted; or child and spo usal abuse passed down generation after genera tion. Perhaps the mo st widespread and insidious form of human violence is ideol ogical contro l. Throughout hist ory, religious movements and governments hav e repeatedly prodded their constituen ts into aggression and violence to dea l with diss enters and nonbelievers.
Most human violence is neither necessary nor is it an inhere nt, genetic, "animal" surviva l skill. We have the ability, and I believe an evolutionary mandate, to stop violence. The best way to stop it is to
realize, as r emphasized in the last chap ter of this book, that we are spiritua l beings who need love as m uch as we need food. But we won't get to the next evolutionary step by just thinking about it just as we can' t change our children's and our lives simply by reading books. Join

ADDENDUM
The science revealed in this book defines how beliefs control behavior and gene activity, and consequently the unfolding of our lives. The chapter on Conscious Parenting describes how most of us un avoidably acquired limiting or self-sabotagin g beliefs that were downl oad ed into our subconscious minds when we were children.
As I mentioned in that chapter, there are a variety of "energy" psychology techniques, which exp loit the latest mind -body research to quickly access and reprogram those subconscious programs. Before I leave you, I'd like to talk a little about one of these energy psychology techniqu es called PSYCH-K'" becaus e I have personal experience with it and I am confident of its integrity, simp licity, and effectiveness.
I met Rob Williams, the origina tor of PSYCH-K"', at a conference in 1990, where we were both pr esenters. As usual, at the conclusion of my presentation, I told my audi ence that if they changed their beliefs they could change their lives. It was a familiar conclusion with a familiar response from the par ticipants: "Well, Bruce, that's grea t, but how do we do that?"
In th ose days I didn 't fully realize the cru cial role the subconscious mind plays in the change process. Instead, I relied mostly on trying to power through nega tive behav ior using po sitive th inkin g an d willpower. I knew, thou gh, that I had had only limited success in making p ersonal changes in my own life. I also knew that when I offered this solution, the energy in the room dropped like a lead balloon. It seems my sophisticated aud iences h ad, like me, alread y tried willpower an d positive thinking with limited success!
As fate would have it, I retu rned to my seat, and looked up to see that the next presenter was psyc hothera pist Rob Williams. Rob's opening remarks quickly had the entire audience on the edge of our seats. In his intr oduction, Rob stated that PSYCH-K'"can change long-standing, limiting beliefs in a matter of minutes.
203



Th e B i o l o g y of B e l ie f
Rob then asked the audience if there was anyone who would like to address an issu e that had been troubling them. One woman caught both Rob's and my attention. She raised her hand tent atively, first up , then down, then up again. Her timidity was palpable. When Rob asked w hat her issu e wa s, her face turned red and her response was ina udible. Rob actually had to leave the podium and confer with her, one-on-one. It was Rob who had to inform the audience that her problem was "speaking in pub lic." Rob retu rned to the stage and the woman hesitantly followed . Rob asked her to tell the audience of nearly a hundred people a bit about her fear . Again she could hardly speak.
Rob worked with the woman for about 10 min utes, using one of the PSYCH-K~ change techniques. Then he again asked the woman to tell the audience how she felt about speaking to them. The chang e was astonishing. Not only was she visibly more relaxed, she began talking to the audience in an excited, yet confide nt voice. The eyes of the conference attendees became like saucers and their mouths dropped as this woman took over the stage for the next five min utes. The woman got so carri ed away that Rob had to ask her to stop sp eaking and take her seat so he could finish his presentation!
Because this woman was a regular attend ee at an annual conference, and I was a frequent presenter, I was able to witness her amazing transformation over the next several years. She not only had gotten over her fear of public speaking, but even went on to organize Toast Masters in her community. Eventually, she became an aw ard-winning public speaker! This woman's life was trul y transform ed in just a few minutes. In the fifteen years since I witnessed that wo man's quick transformation, I have seen other people rap idly improve their selfesteem and chan ge their relationships, their finances, and their health
using PSYCH-K~.
The PSYCH-~ process is sim ple, dir ect and verifiab le. It utilizes the mind / body interface of mu scle testing (kinesiology ) that I first discovered in a student-chiropractor's makes hift office in the Caribbean, to access the self-limiting "files" of the subco nscious mind . It also makes use of left brain /right brain integration techniques to effect

Add e nd um
sw ift and long-lasting chan ges. In addition, PSYCH-K'" integrates Spirit into the change process, jus t as I have integrated Spirit into my understanding of Science. Using mu scle testing, PSYCH-K'" accesses w ha t Rob calls the "su perconscious" mind to m ake sure that the pe rson's stated goals are safe and approp riate. These built-in safeguards
allow this system of personal change to be taught to anyone w ho is interested in taking charge of their lives by mov ing out of fear and into love .
I use PSYCH -K'" in my ow n life. PSYCH-K'" has helped me undo my self-limiting beliefs, including one abo ut not being able to finish my book. The fact that you are hol ding this book is one indication of the power of PSYCH-K'"! I also lecture regul arly with Rob. Instead of offering positive thinking and willpowe r at the end of my lectures, I ins tead happil y tum au diences over to Rob. While this boo k is about the New Biology, I believe that PSYCH-K'" represents an important step toward the New Psyc hology for the 21st century, and beyond. You can find more inform ation about PSYCH-K'" at Rob' s web site:
