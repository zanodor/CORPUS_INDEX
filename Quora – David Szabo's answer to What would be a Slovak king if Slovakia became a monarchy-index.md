What would be a Slovak king if Slovakia became a monarchy?
· 53m ago
Slovakia exist since 1993. Before the 20th century nobody know and nobody called Slovakia,
the region of today Slovakia called north Hungary. Check out the history maps or the
contemporary history maps and documents, you will not find any Slovakia, thus talking about
“Slovak king” is nonsense.
Slovakia are using exactly the Hungarian coat of arm what Hungary is already using 1000 years
long for the full area of the Hungarian kingdom not only for upper Hungary: Double cross +
trimount.
coat of arm of Slovakia:
Reverse of the first double seal of King Bela IV of Hungary (1235–1270) usage (1235-1241):
Reverse of the second double seal of King Louis of Hungary (1342–1382), usage (1366–1382):
Reverse of the firdt double seal of King Sigismund of Hungary (1387–1437), usage (1387–1405):
Coat of arms of Kingdom of Hungary (1400):
Stove tile: (14th century)
Stephen I of Hungary (1000–1038)
Stephen II of Hungary (1116–1136)
