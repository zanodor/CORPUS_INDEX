MILKY WAY SPIRAL
In every ancient culture The Great Mother Goddess in Heaven was
worshipped as showed here with the Egyptian picture 2 where you
can see how life matter is formed and radiated out from her womb.
The animated star atlas picture shows the centre in our Galaxy.
The most common explanations of animal rock carvings having some
drawings "inside" the body, are that the drawings are showing
intestines which also can be the fact in some cases, but in many
cases the interpreters are forgetting that there is mythological
stories to tell when they are looking on the old rock carvings.
Picture 1 below with a crossed square on the back of the reindeer,
marking the Galaxy centre, are from Norway. Picture 2 are a star



map marking the Galaxy centre with a red/blue swirl. Picture 3 are
from Turkey showing the centre whit concentric rings and a dot.
Looking from our Sun system, the direction towards our Galaxy
centre are placed in the star constellation of Sagittarius, here marked
in the star map picture 2 with the red/blue swirl. Now if you think
about the fact that the southern Milky Way contours was
mythological interpreted both as a Woman and a Cow, you can se
the resemblance between the pictures above and below.

Bronze Age artefact from Finland illustrating the swirling force in
Creation. Compare to my drawing to the right, the artefact are very
likely to show the Solar System position in our Galaxy, The Milky Way.

The Sculptor Galaxy, a barred spiral starburst galaxy, (2MASS).
A barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped
structure composed of stars. Bars are found in approximately half of
all spiral galaxies[1]. Bars generally affect both the motions of stars
and interstellar gas within spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms
as well[1].
Edwin Hubble classified these types of spiral galaxies as "SB"
("Spiral", "Barred") in his Hubble sequence, and arranged them into
three sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are.
SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the
other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb type galaxies lie in
between. A fourth type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe
somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Cloud
galaxies, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have
since been found to contain barred spiral structures.
In 2005, observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope backed up
previously collected evidence that suggested the Milky Way is a
barred spiral galaxy. Observations by radio telescopes had for years
suggested our galaxy to be barred, but Spitzer's vision in the infrared
region of the spectrum has provided a more definite calculation.

The bars
Barred spiral galaxies are relatively common, with surveys showing
that up to two-thirds of all spiral galaxies contain a bar.[2] The
current hypothesis is that the bar structure acts as a type of stellar
nursery, fueling star birth at their centers. The bar is thought to act
as a mechanism that channels gas inwards from the spiral arms
through orbital resonance, in effect funneling the flow to create new
stars.[3] This process is also thought to explain why many barred
spiral galaxies have active galactic nuclei, such as that seen in the
Southern Pinwheel Galaxy.
The creation of the bar is generally thought to be the result of a
density wave radiating from the center of the galaxy whose effects
reshape the orbits of the inner stars. This effect builds over time to
stars orbiting further out, which creates a self-perpetuating bar
structure.[4] Another possible cause of bar creation is gravitational
disruptions between galaxies.[citation needed]
Bars are thought to be a temporary phenomenon in the life of spiral
galaxies, the bar structure decaying over time, transforming the
galaxy from a barred spiral to a "regular" spiral pattern. Past a certain
size the accumulated mass of the bar compromises the stability of
the overall bar structure. Barred spiral galaxies with high mass
accumulated in their center tend to have short, stubby bars. [5] Since
so many spiral galaxies have a bar structure, it is likely that it is a
recurring phenomenon in spiral galaxy development. The oscillating
evolutionary cycle from spiral galaxy to barred spiral galaxy is
thought to take on the average about two billion years.[6]
Recent studies have confirmed the idea that bars are a sign of
galaxies reaching full maturity as the "formative years" end. A team
led by Kartik Sheth of the Spitzer Science Center at the California



Institute of Technology in Pasadena discovered that only 20 percent
of the spiral galaxies in the distant past possessed bars, compared
with nearly 70 percent of their modern counterparts.[7]
The bulges
Studying the core of the Milky Way, scientists found out that the
Milky Way's bulge was peanut-shaped. This led to the conclusion
that all barred spiral galaxies have a peanut shaped bulge. When
observing a distant spiral galaxy with a rotational axis perpendicular
to the line of sight, or one that appears "edge-on" to the observer,
the shape of the bulge can be easily observed, and therefore quickly
classified as either a barred spiral or a regular spiral. Galaxy NGC
4565 has been classified as an unbarred spiral galaxy using this
method.[citation needed]
