Chapter 1 - The Tree of Life: Archetypes, Metaphors, and Illusion
The Tree of Life is a common metaphorical image in the mythology of just about every country and race on Earth, in one form or another. It is an archetype. Although its meaning seems to vary from place to place, its central role in such cultural traditions as the maypole and many religious practices, seems to be ubiquitous.
How widespread most of these archetypes are, is startling, in and of itself. Renowned writer and culturist Joseph Campbell tried, in his work, to explain the existence and origins of such archetypal images. His major source of explanation for the commonality of these archetypes seemed to revolve around ‘independent invention’ rather than what he liked to term ‘diffusion.’ What Campbell referred to as archetypes are such things as sleeping dreams, death, rebirth, a child who becomes a savior, virgin birth, the idea of a sacred world mountain, the great goddess, time as a cyclical thing, the axis mundi or world axis, primeval waters, the serpent, certain kinds of sacrifice, an awakening, and even something as simple as the lotus blossom. These are things which can be found commonly in so many myths and legends, not to mention cultural and religious histories, as well as on an individual level as well.
Robert Segal boils down Campbell’s work to the all-engrossing question lying at its very heart, and one that is also very vital to our own forthcoming research into the very nature of archetypes in our history. He asks, Are these mythical images that we see all around us, the archetypes themselves, or are they simply symbols that seek to represent the original archetype themselves?
Campbell’s idea of independent invention suggests that each culture came up with an archetype such as the Tree of Life on its own. This means they were not in any way, shape or form, borrowed from another culture or influence. He argues that there could be two possible explanations for this coincidence. The first is heredity, which to Campbell is the most likely explanation. The second is experience. Heredity being that a certain image once formulated within a cultural or religious group of some kind, is then handed down from elder to younger and thus multiplies and divides its influence with that group itself.
If it were experience from which these archetypal images spread, that would mean that each race or culture that has the Tree of Life in its mythology, has actually somewhere in its dim distant past, had an actual experience of something that anyone would commonly recognize or logically symbolize as a Tree of Life. This could have been in a physically wakened state, or in a an archetypal dream shared by many in the culture. Dreams are a central storage depot for many religious visions and images.
Campbell placed a lot of importance on dreams. Devoid of an “effective general mythology in our immediate society,” each one us will resort to his own “private, unrecognized, rudimentary, yet secretly potent pantheon of dreams” to create for ourselves our own system of mythological ideas and metaphors. As we walk down the street, “the latest incarnation of Oedipus, the continued romance of Beauty and the Beast, stand this very afternoon on the corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change.”

Psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung, who founded the analytical school of psychology, was one of Campbell’s mentors. For Jung, however, only inherited causes could be archetypal. Campbell uses the term far more loosely in his interpretations by suggesting that even acquired causes can also be archetypal. By archetypes, both Campbell and Jung, mean not just recurrent mythological subjects but ones that also both stir emotion and propel behavior. Political emblems and symbols of national pride such as the Bear for Russia or the Bald Eagle for the Unites States are the most common examples of these. Each city, state and region within the United States goes out of its way to have a state flower, a city motto, something that stirs the emotions with regard to that particular geographical location or region.
Campbell went on to formulate the idea that all myths and epics are linked in that they are cultural manifestations of the universal need of the human psyche to explain social, cosmological, and spiritual realities.
He proposes that archetypes are the releasers of what directly prompt emotions and actions in animals: innate releasing mechanisms. An example of this might be ‘the golden arches of McDonald’s’ that now serve to open some innate doorway to our feeling of being hungry, whether, in truth, we are hungry or not. Archetypes then are triggers that activate innate releasing mechanisms, which in turn are triggers that activate emotions and actions. Like keys to locks that open doors, archetypes are keys that trigger responses that then unlock deep-seated needs and desires within each and every one of us. Yet archetypes themselves need to be activated, and it has to be some form of concrete symbol that is the trigger that activates them. The most famous example of this is Pavlov’s dog salivating at the ringing of a bell. With humans, a certain piece of music, a smell, a touch, or especially a certain symbol within our sight, can all be triggers that open inner doorways to our psyche, allowing our emotions and thoughts to be manipulated, once these defenses are down. The advertising and marketing industries that now seek to control all our consumer spending habits, knows how to target us with just such trigger-realizing mechanisms—a logo, a jingle, a slogan, all are triggers meant to stimulate our complex emotional needs and push us toward spending our acquired energies in the form of money, on something the advertiser and marketer want to sell.
Archetypes are central to this book, and the concrete symbols which invoke them are a key element to understanding the power religions, political parties, secret societies, and other such control groups exert over each and every one of us.
In The Mythic Image, as in others of his books, Campbell compares myths to dreams, saying that both come from the deep unconscious side of our beings: His argument is, briefly, that through dreams a door is opened to mythology. Since myths are of the nature of a dream, dreams arising from an inward world unknown to waking consciousness, so do then myths arise from that very same inward world of the unknown. Whether the unconscious is full of acquired ideas or inherited ones, Campbell does not like to say, though he contends that myths, like dreams, are a) composed less of plots than of images; b) have a logic of their own; and c) can only be experienced, never truly be analyzed.
In explaining the similarities among myths, however, Campbell downplays the importance of independent invention under which the unconscious falls, and focuses himself instead on diffusion.

The psychological and metaphysical functions of myth would then seem to prevent them from having a social function as well. If myth serves to reconnect humans with their severed selves it operates devoid of any connection to the workings of life. If this were the case, and myth serves to reconnect humans with the cosmos as a whole, it either trivializes or outright seems to dissolve any distinction between humans and anything else as well, including fellow humans.
Campbell does say in one of his works (Magic) that myth deals with society, at least to some extent. Social problems he admits, stem from psychological ones, from the failure to tend to the unconscious: “ . . . every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness. Wars and temper tantrums are the makeshifts of ignorance . . .” How the rediscovery of a severed part of either humans or the cosmos would abet one socially, Campbell does not say.
Campbell argues that the individualism espoused by creative mythology renders impossible the fulfillment of the third social function of myth as well as the second one, having a logic of their own, and never truly being able to be analyzed. He says he finds it impossible to believe that the ways of any one society are divinely sanctioned by mythology
As one of society’s proclaimed experts on mythology and archetypes, Campbell’s ideas reflect the tendency, as do most or all of our experts in the scientific, left-brained world that we live in, to espouse a philosophy that some things can never, and almost should never, be known. Often it comes to the point where it is almost a criminal act for us to try, let alone to say that we do know or perceive answers that come from unscientific personal experience or from beyond the physical plane of existence..
Where and when then could the common experience, group image or mass-vision of the Tree of Life have occurred in history that would have allowed each and every race to have it as one of their inherited images? That is a question this book seeks to answer.
Take a look at this creation story from the Wapangwa people of Tanzania who have a Creation story making use of the theme of what is called excretory creation, though still centered, as are so many, around a Tree of Life.
“Before there was a sun, a moon, or stars, there was only the wind and a tree on which there lived some ants. There was also the Word, which controlled everything, but the Word could not be seen; it was a catalyst for creation.
“Once the wind became angry at the tree for standing in its way, so it blew particularly hard, tearing off a branch on which there were white ants. When they landed, the ants were hungry, so they ate all of the leaves on the branch, sparing only one, on which they defecate a huge pile.
“They then had no choice but to eat their own excrement, and over time, as they ate and redeposited their excrement, the pile became a mountain that finally spread to the original tree. By then the ants preferred excrement to leaves, and they continued the process of adding to the pile until it had become the earth.
“The wind still blew on the world so strongly that parts of the excrement pile began to harden into stone. The world gradually formed, until the Word sent snow and then warm wind, which melted the snow and brought a huge flood. The waters killed the ants; there was water covering everything.

“Later the earth and the world tree joined, and the trees, grasses, rivers, and oceans took form. The air gave birth to beings that flew about singing. These beings came to earth and became animals, birds, and humans, each with its own song or language.
“The new beings were hungry. The animals wanted to eat the Tree of Life, but the humans defended it. This led to a huge war between humans and animals and to the tradition of humans and animals eating each other. The war was so ferocious that the earth shook, and bits and pieces of it flew off, gained heat, and became the sun, moon, and stars.
“After the war there was the creation of gods, rain, thunder, and lightning. A long-tailed sheep with a single horn was so happy at the end of the great war that she leapt into the air, caught fire, and became the source of thunder and lightning.
“The new gods who sprang up were harsh with humans. One of them told the people that the sheep that had sprung into the air had killed the Word, the ultimate creator, and that the people would be reduced in size and in the end would be consumed by fire.” (Source: Beier, 42-46.)
While almost being prophetic of the dilemma facing Humankind in its present situation, this creation story from east Africa shares many common elements with those of places as far away as ancient Sumeria and Babylonia, many thousands of miles to the north of its point of origin.
Taking a look at any good collection of these creation myths from around the world will show the reader just how many of them are filled with archetypes and share such elements in common. The most common of all, however, is the Tree of Life, sometimes as the fruit of the Tree of Life, a fruit which almost inevitably, those who are the first beings created must never be allowed to eat.
A common element in Tree of Life mythology is that this fruit of the tree has the power, either alone or in concert with other ingredients, to give eternal life.
In his book, Stairway to Heaven, Zecharia Sitchin, the Sumerian scholar famous for his archaeological ideas about transcultural gods, relates a description of The Tree of Life by the Biblical patriarch Enoch in which the tree gives forth streams of honey, milk, oil and wine. In his work with Sumerian mythology, Sitchin suggests this tree was the palm tree brought by alien ancestors who spread it out to the various corners of the Earth, to areas where it would grow. His interpretation makes sense of the description since there is the coconut palm from which we obtain milk and oil, and the date palm from which we get a honey-like date syrup as well as date wine. Indeed, what better plant to take along with you on a long trip through space in order to supply all your needs?
“And the angel who was with him confirmed that it indeed it was the very tree from which Adam and Eve had eaten before they were driven out of Eden . . . It was as high as a fir, it’s leaves were as of the carob, and its fruit like the clusters of the vine.”
“As to the tree, no mortal is to touch it until the great judgement. Its food is for the elect. Its fragrance shall be in their bones and they shall live a long life on earth.”
Barbara Clow confirms Sitchin’s explanation of the alien origin of the palm tree in her book, Heart of the Christos:
“This was a time of primeval bliss. . . They bought a Tree of Life—the date palm—and the seeds of corn, bananas, and grains. . . The Tree of Life became the central altar of Adamah (her



6
name for the original humans). Adamah noticed that the Tree lived thousands of years, just like the Nibiruans. The Tree’s solar seed year is 3600 years because its DNA is Nibiruan.”
Much of the mythology surrounding the Tree of Life on one level revolves around Man’s own quest for eternal life. And more than anything, this quest seems to be triggered by an association with ancient gods of one kind or another, most of whom lived to incredible ages, setting up a feeling of envy in Mankind “to be like the gods” and live forever.
“In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.” (Genesis 3:5)
Basically it became a case of ‘if they can do it, why can’t we?’ And in surrendering to this feeling of envy, Mankind also found himself trapped in a “race against time” in his life, measuring everything against the average span of his lifetime. This is a race that is still a key to his imprisonment today.
This desire to be like the gods will come up a lot in the course of this book, but for now we will just mention it in passing. In The Gold of the Gods, famous ‘space-gods’ researcher and author Erich Von Daniken tells of the legends in China surrounding just one such god of seemingly eternal nature. Be careful to note the number of common archetypes in this legend, they will crop up again and again throughout the length and breadth of our tale.
“According to legend, every ruler and “Son of Heaven” is supposed to have lived for 18,000 terrestrial years and if we take this estimate at its face value, P’an Ku brought order into the heavens 2,229,000 years ago! Perhaps these astronomical calculations may be a few years out here and there, but what does it matter with such a family tree?”
This god, P’an Ku, whose legend is said to have spread throughout China, was depicted differently in different regions, not surprising in view of the vast size of this country. Sometimes he is a being with two horns on his head and a hammer in his right hand, sometimes he appears as a dragon mastering the four elements, sometimes he holds the sun in one hand and the moon in the other, sometimes he is chipping away at a rock-face, watched by a snake.”.
The Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt detail the efforts of the Pharaohs to attain this elusive goal of eternal life. In these texts, the Tree of Life seems to again symbolize some form of nourishment, which along with the Water of Life, imparts eternal life to the incoming Pharaoh.
The Pharaoh was made to recite magic formulas to make the Boat of Heaven sail back, its destination the “Imperishable Star” whose symbol was the winged disc, and to approach “the Double Gates of Heaven” (from which we likely get the myth of St. Peter at the gates of heaven) . As Sitchin describes it, there was one final detail to attaining an everlasting afterlife for the Pharaoh: the king must then find and partake of the “Nourishment of Everlasting,” an elixir which keeps rejuvenating the gods in their celestial abode . . . “Give sustenance to the king from your eternal sustenance.”
The Pharaoh must then make his way to the Field of Life/the Great Lake of the Gods where he was to obtain both a beverage that is the Water of Life, and a food that is the Fruit of the Tree of Life. In the texts it is the Great Green Divine Falcon who leads the king to the Field of Life, to find the Tree of Life that grows there. There the goddess who is the Lady of Life meets the king. She in her hands four jars with whose contents she “refreshes the heart of the Great God on the day when he awakens.” She offers the divine elixir to the king, “therewith giving him Life.”

Another instance of the Tree of Life in Sitchin’s work can be found in Divine Encounters in which the Tree is depicted along with the Winged Disc, the celestial symbol of the aliens from Nibiru, and the depiction of what we are told is the whole solar system (a central deity surrounded by a family of eleven planets) flanking a Tree of Life. This would seem to symbolize the Tree of evolution of something more than the solar system, however, and in fact does relate, as many Trees do, to the origin of life on this planet from all twelve signs of the Zodiac, as we shall find out is what happened, later in the book.
If this seems difficult to accept at first, consider the Milky Way's center that is the busy core of a metropolis, crowded with huge populations of stars frantically dancing to the rhythm of gravitation. New results already show 100,000 stars never seen before. The Milky Way is in fact a large spiral galaxy 130,000 light-years across, which began to form about 10,000 or 15,000 million years ago. Structured in a thin disk with spiral arms and a great bulge in the center, our Solar System is in the edge of one of the arms, about 25 000 light-years from the center: a very quiet area compared to the inner central bulge.
100,000 red giants have been newly identified in a region of the galactic center that as seen from Earth is only about four times the angular size of the full moon. Most of these are the socalled AGB (Asymptotic Giant Branch) stars, which are very evolved stars that provide key clues to unveil the star-formation history of the Milky Way, because their masses vary according to their age; it is therefore easy to determine how long ago a certain population of AGB stars was born. AGB stars expel huge amounts of dust to the environment during a brief stage of their lives - dust in which many chemical elements, including those essential for life - are present.
These instances of the Tree of Life do not sound like the proverbial apple tree that most people would associate with Adam and Eve and the Biblical Garden of Eden. The apple was the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil which Adam and Eve were tempted to eat by the serpent. The Tree of Life was the tree from which Adam and his Eve were also barred from eating “lest they become like one of us . . . and live for ever.” Being thrown out of the Garden of Eden meant that they never got the chance to eat of this Tree of Life.
In Gilgamesh, one of the earliest surviving works of ancient Sumeria, circa 2900 BC, the hero Gilgamesh goes on a quest to join the gods in an Afterlife. On his journey, Gilgamesh sees “an enclosure of the gods” wherein there was a garden; but the “garden” was made up entirely of artificially carved precious stones: “All kinds of thorny Prickly Bushes were visible, blooming with gemstones; Carnelian bore fruit hanging in clusters, its vines too beautiful to behold. The foliage was of lapis lazuli; and grapes, too lush to look at, of . . stones were made.” The partly damaged verses go on to list other kinds of fruit-bearing trees and the variety of precious stones—white, red and green—of which they were made. Pure water also runs through the garden, and in its midst he sees “like a Tree of Life and a Tree of . . . that of An-gug stones were made.”
A Noah-like character named Utnapishtim shows up, not aged at all even though it is at least 6,000 years after the flood and says, “I will reveal to thee, Gilgamesh, a hidden matter, a secret of the gods I will tell thee . . . Everlasting life is attained not by being immortal—it is attained by staying young forever! . . . A plant there is, like a prickly berrybush is its root. Its thorns are like a brier-vine’s; thine hands the thorns will prick (spikenard). (But) if with thine own hands the plant you could obtain, rejuvenation you will find.”

Thus, once again the Tree of Life seems to pertain to something dealing with the attainment of eternal life for the mortals. In most versions of this story, the gods, jealous of what man might become if he attained such immortality, “lest he become as one of us,” are not willing to let them have eternal life, not willing to let him taste of the Fruit of the Tree of Life.
The Book of Mormon’s version of the Tree of Life is somewhat different, although again, there are elements in common--archetypal images. In the Mormon version, the fruit, once eaten, does wonderful things for the attitude and perspective of he or she who eat of it. The story is the story of Lehi and the Tree of Life, in which Lehi sees the Tree in a vision , “a Tree whose (white) fruit was desirable to make one happy” (1 Nephi 8: 10). Unlike Adam and Eve, once Lehi eats of the fruit, instead of being punished, his soul is filled “with exceedingly great joy.” He then desires that his family should do likewise “for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.” ” (1 Nephi 8: 10). He is, however, worried by two of his sons who will not partake of the fruit, and fears “lest they be cast off from the presence of the Lord” for not eating of the fruit.
In Lehi’s vision there are a number of other symbolic elements or archetypes, including a “river of water,” “a rod of iron,” and a “straight and narrow path,” among other things. One common interpretation of Lehi’s vision espoused in Mormonism is that the Tree of Life shows a vision for Jesus’ life work. The river is the River of Life; the fruit of the tree represents God’s love; the iron rod represents God’s word; and of course the straight and narrow path represents just that—the straight and narrow path on which the righteous should travel to achieve eternal life.
During an exhibition of various artistic interpretations of the Tree of Life at the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City a number of years ago, various representations of Lehi and his vision were exhibited from Mormon followers all over the world. Some, like the one from Peru, also incorporated in their imagery, the many levels of heaven. The depictions of the Tree itself varied depending on the climate and the flora in the country from which the artwork came. It is perhaps unusual then that the palm tree (the Tree of Life associated with the alien gods of Sitchin and Von Daniken) figures as such a common decoration on some Mormon buildings, for example, the Mormon Relief Agency in Salt Lake City, when Utah and the areas from which the Mormon religion originated are cooler areas where palm trees do not grow.
In the Old Testament of the Bible, the Tree of Life is sometimes called the Tree of Jesse and has a genealogical symbology which relates to the patriarch of the long royal lineage which included King David and Jesus. Abraham sees Sarah in a dream as a date-palm, a Tree of Life, meaningful for the twelve tribes which sprang from her son, Isaac.
In the Dead Sea Scrolls, one of the texts makes reference to “the trees of the water,” which in this particular case has a pejorative meaning, and to “the trees of life” which have access to the water source, water having a very salvific meaning in the Qumran Scrolls. Psalm 1:3 lauds the righteous who are like “a tree planted by streams of water.” Here the Tree of Life is again related to the idea of eternal life, at least symbolically. In Ezekial 31:14, however, there seems to be a confirmation of the idea that it is not proper for Mankind to have eternal life: “All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height; for they are all given over to death, to the nether world among mortal men, with those who go down to the Pit.”
Another type of tree often associated with the Tree of Life in Biblical images is the cedar. The use of the cedar in reference to such imagery is grounded in medicinal folklore, for indeed there is



9
a kind of tree which is known for its healing properties and it is termed ‘the tree of life’ (arborvitae in Latin).
Arborvitae (“tree of life”) is the common name for certain related evergreen trees of the cypress family, so named early in the 17th century because of the medicinal value ascribed to their balsamic resin. Extracts of this resin increase blood pressure and reduce fever. The leaves have a fragrant, balsam-like odor, and the wood is reddish-brown, light, and durable. Some of the larger species are valuable timber trees. The smaller species are cultivated in gardens and as wind screens for more tender plants. The common, or American, arborvitae, often called white cedar, is found in the northeastern regions of North America as far south as Virginia. The only other species native to North America is the giant arborvitae, found west of the Rocky Mountains from northern California to Alaska, sometimes called red cedar or canoe cedar. The Oriental arborvitae of the Old World is smaller and less hardy than the American species. It has denser foliage, more nearly vertical branches, and larger, rougher, and more nearly spherical cones.
So here we find a tree which fits the role in, not giving eternal life, but as Utnapishtim says in the Gilgamesh epic, the secret to everlasting life is attained not by being immortal—“but by staying young (healthy) forever.”
As we later begin to delve deeper into the ancient mysteries which are so much a part of the formation of history, the Tree of Life arises as the central image of the Jewish mystical tradition, the Cabala, variously spelled as Kaballah and Qua’bla as well. And again we find reference made to the palm tree.
The medieval Spanish Cabala, the most important form of Jewish mysticism, has to do with esoteric knowledge about the nature of the divine world and its hidden connections with the world of creation. The medieval Cabala is a theosophical system that draws on Neoplatonism and Gnosticism and expresses itself heavily in symbolic language.
In this symbolic language, there are “ten spheres connected together by twenty-two paths, corresponding to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and together they constitute the “tree of life,” the visual representation of the creation. Through meditation and prayer, devotees seek to scale the tree of life and explore the relationship between humankind and the universe. The Middle Pillar of this grand representation of the Tree of Life is “a single pole, or shaft, joining Heaven and earth. It is the path that permits direct communion with God. It is the Tree of Life as a single palm tree.”
Once again we find the Tree of Life involved with exploring the central theme of spiritual enlightenment, the man walking with his feet on the Earth and his head in the clouds or heaven, leaving out no stage of human experience. Attaining spiritual enlightenment through the use of the Cabala then becomes a living version of the child’s game Snakes and Ladders, or Chutes and Ladders as it is sometimes called, in which the devotee tries to raise his level of awareness up the central axis of consciousness of the Tree of Man to enlightenment.
Trees are an appropriate symbol for this conscious effort to reach into the higher dimensions of existence since they themselves are a direct connection between the 2nd and the 3rd dimensions–bringing the energy of the one into the energies of the other to help create and support life as we know it on this planet.



10
The Hermetic Tee of Life has seven main branches and ten heads symbolizing the seven planets and the ten spheres of Kabbalistic tradition, along with the various aspects man sheds as he ascends the tree. The serpent often pictured wound around its trunk is variously interpreted as the wisdom necessary for enlightenment, and the primal energy of the soul.
In the Kaballah: the abode of God the Almighty is in the tenth Sefira, a “brilliance” or heavenly place, a Tenth Heaven. The Sefirot were usually depicted as concentric circles , often superimposed, on the image of Kadmon (“The Ancient One”), the center of which is called Yesod (“Foundation”), the tenth Ketter (“Crown” or God the Most High). Beyond it stretches the Ein Soff –infinity, infinite space. These levels as we shall as see as we progress along our journey represent the various levels of consciousness or dimensions surrounding the planet Earth and the individual human being, much like the rings of a tree when it is cut open.
As Z’ev ben Shimon Halevi explains in Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree, the Tree of Life was also used in the unkabbalistic practice of magic, using yet another set of archetypes placed on the Tree in place of those of the Jewish Kabalistic tradition.
Like the symbolism of the New World Order, the Knights Templar , and so many other religious and secret societies, The Tree of Life has many various levels of interpretation itself. As a metaphor for the title of this book, it refers to the intricate interwoven pattern of the genealogical tree of life from which all human evolution stems. This a reverse tree if you will, with its roots in the stars, and its branches here on Earth.
The roots of this tree go back a long, long way, and have their beginnings in the universe, on planets as diversely different from that of Earth as Sirius and the Pleiades. Yet the fact that each one of these planets supports a high level of sophisticated and intelligent life is consciously not accepted by a vast majority of people here on Earth. Therefore, before getting to far into our journey it will also be necessary to take a look at some of the mythology of Planet Earth in order to uncover the seeds from which this particular Tree of Life sprang
This Tree of Life also relates to the spiritual purpose of this planet, in the grander scheme of the Universe. The truth of this purpose also lies in its starseeding, and in its nurturing by so many different parent races scattered throughout the Universe. This truth lies scattered throughout the convoluted reporting of history, a history written by beings with their own agenda, and throughout the various religions which have evolved on the planet over the past 50,000 years.
To state this purpose plainly and simply, planet Earth was an experiment to connect up all twelve dimensions of spiritual existence on one planet, and give the souls who came here a chance to gain a greater range of experiences and have the opportunity to make quantum leaps in their spiritual growth, blending the best of each of the various worlds and civilizations in this area of the galaxy. The other planets from which we were starseeded have more or less one kind of lesson to teach, one dimension of existence – a higher level than this one, perhaps, but without the spiritual breadth and depth and potential that we have here on Earth.
And it is because of our ancestry from the stars, the blending of many races, that we indeed have this awesome potential. If America is the melting-pot of the planet, then planet Earth is the melting-pot of—not just the Galaxy—but in fact of the entire Universe itself.
Over the past 2,000 years, in particular, this information about the real Tree of Life has been exorcised, censored, or just completely edited out of most of the holy books, as well as history



11
books, in what ultimately has become a successful attempt to cover up our true origins, and to stop this experiment from working.
David Icke likes to talk about the fear many alien races have of human beings because of this great spiritual potential we have. Where as they are fairly limited in their potential for making quantum leaps and bounds in their own existences, human beings are almost unlimited in terms of what they can accomplish in one lifetime here on Earth.
What could it be this Tree of Life which seems to be both good and evil for people if they eat or partake of it, depending on the attitude of those who offer it or withhold it ?
The Tree of Life is the knowledge of how to the attain eternal life—not just the seemingly eternal life of our alien forefathers who lived for vastly longer periods than we do here on Earth, but the eternal life of a soul reaching into the highest levels of Heaven from which we all sprang in the Beginning, This fear David speaks of is not simply fear, for many of them cannot feel emotions as we do here on Earth, but indeed a jealousy, they, these beings we sometimes worship as gods, are jealous of what man might become if he attained such knowledge of how to reach true immortality, “lest he become as one of us,” They are then not willing to let Him have eternal life, not willing to let him taste of the Fruit of the Tree of Life. And so they have focused all their energies on squashing this knowledge, hiding it away from the sight of those they deemed unworthy or from those most likely to use this knowledge for the benefit of all. Instead they have used this knowledge itself in the pursuit of power over other people, used it to create a slave race captive on a prison world –the most beautiful world in all of Creation itself, and then gone about systematically destroying all hope of Mankind ever leaving this perfectly implemented snare.
This is where the Dark side comes in. As stated in the Introduction, there is a force here in this Universe that does not exist yet in the other Universes—for there are indeed many Universes, there never being just one verse to any song, and so Creation is—a beautiful song with many verses and an infinite number of ways of singing it.
This book, more than anything else, is a history book that seeks to relate the birth, growth, and hopefully death of the Darkness in this corner of the Universe. As the quote at the beginning of the book suggests, Mankind has come to think of Darkness, evil, the Devil as being some nebulous kind of thing in religious books of which we see its influence in the world, but do not really think or believe that there is such an entity in and of itself. There is. His name, for want of a more familiar term to call him, is Lucifer. This is His story, and the story of how his influence has spread from the stars to this most beautiful of all planets, and the reasons, purposes, and methods by which he has managed to take over the planet in quest of His sworn mission to become God of His own Universe.
To achieve this sworn goal he has had many helpers along the way, and it is they who have sought to manipulate and control the forces of Creation in order to imprison those other souls here simply to learn their lessons and go on about their business in this giant school which is Creation . These are the secret societies, religions, military, political and scientific groups who think of themselves as the elite , the Illuminati or 'enlightened ones' here to meter out what they feel are just rewards to the rest of us—those who are “the trees of the water,” those who are “all given over to death, to the nether world among mortal men, with those who go down to the Pit.”
Many worlds have fallen to this Darkness before us. Many of us still have memories of lives on other planets fighting against this tyranny that seeks to suck the Light out of all Creation. And



12
one more time we are here to do it all again, though like any war, there is one crucial turning point in the struggle that turns the tide in favor of one side or another. For the seemingly eternal struggle against Darkness, Planet Earth is it.
Before the Tree of Life, however, there was the original event known as the Creation. Most of us have some vague notion of it, either from the Christian Bible, one of the other holy books of various religions, or from the realms of evolutionary science such as it may be. In the Beginning we find Adam being made out of clay or the dust of the earth, multiplying his family seemingly incestuously out of just two beings, and then the world expanding as it does from there on. The Creation as we know it, however, does not provide the necessary details needed to satisfy our rational minds as to how creation and the evolution of life truly began or how they work in this Universe. If we do not like the Bible’s simplified version of the Creation, we are then left with the scientists’ fanciful notion that after a Big Bang somehow, life sprang out of a lifeless universe. From this cosmic explosion of matter Man somehow managed to pull Himself out of the muck and mire f a swamp somewhere as a single-celled creature that then became a fish, and then a monkey, and then a proto-human, and then the ultimate creature of the Universe--civilized man.
Both these Creation stories whitewash a much more extraordinary event than has ever been portrayed before now, one which has as its origin Original Cause—the beginning of all things in the Heart of FATHER, HE who resides in the center of Creation itself. That is where the real story of the Tree of Life must begin, long before the origins of this planet even came into the sentient thoughts of its Creators.
This book has been titled, Where Were You Before the Tree of Life?, because it is necessary for us to look at where we existed before our origins on this planet. This will take us back to the origins of the universe—and to the universal cosmic families from which we all once came. Along the journey, it will also help to explain the affects that our origins have on our lives, both in the past and today, and give us some kind of insight into the lives and the choices we have to make in order to determine the kind of lives we will have in the not to distant future.
For many of the beings on this planet Creation even involves going beyond this universe to other universes and into the very heart of creation itself—the Central Universe.
This book also then becomes a way of dispelling the myths from our lives, about cauterizing the insidious effects which these many thousands of years of propaganda have had on the group consciousness of this planet. As I side benefit it also hopes to educate its reader on their own history so that none of those who wish to will ever be doomed to repeat over and over again the mistakes of the past as the old saying says: those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.
Not by any purposeful intention but rather because of the way history has been written, it will also serve to restore the female energy to Creation which has for so long been suppressed or plainly just hidden from the eyes of the masses by the patriarchy of a ‘jealous God’ over more than just the past 6,000 years.
One of the driving forces which inspired this book and its title was a dream, or a vision, if you will, had by one of the original participants in the project. In this vision, the woman saw a large tree similar to an oak, with many spreading branches and leaves, under which were dug two graves. From the one grave a man arose, floating off into an ethereal-like sky. From the other grave, however, no one arose. This was taken symbolically to mean that while the male essence has



13
been allowed to rise in order to be able to pursue his efforts of ascending the Tree of Life, the female remains buried, trapped beneath the mounds of earth shoveled upon her and her energies in order to keep her from rising to equality, and taking her rightful place alongside man in Creation. This has been a serious miscalculation on the part of the male essence, and an insidious part of the patriarchy’s plan to subjugate women in order to control and manipulate the very processes of Creation itself. It takes a combination of the male, the female, and of the neutral force or Holy Spirit, in order to truly create. The female creates space for the male to fill, while the neutral force itself is the creative spark or catalyst that unites the two into one grander whole.

Chapter Two -- The First Seeds
The Creation has been perceived of in as many ways as there are the many minds of Man. These stories of the Creation, however, can all be categorized into three different types, depending on the way they see the initial acts of Creation.
The first type of Creation story is that which stems from a primal explosion of some kind, Creation being emitted into the Void from this Big Bang. This is very much the essence of the Big Bang Theory so prevalent among many scientific minds these days. Acclaimed researcher Erich Von Daniken gives an explanation of the Big Bang theory of Creation, its origins, and how it got its name, in his book, Gold of the Gods. Here, Von Daniken credits Professor George Lemaitre, a physicist and mathematician from Brussels, with first introducing the concept into the endless discussions going on at the time about the origin of all worlds.
The theory itself says that billions of years ago, all the matter in the Universe was compressed into a single original atom, a heavy mass of matter, the cohesion of which pressed permanently against its nucleus. The incredible forces involved added and multiplied so that the lump of matter eventually exploded. Splintered into many many billions of pieces, these bits of matter then assembled themselves into finitely numerous galaxies over an endlessly long period of consolidation:
“The original prodigious force which existed before the beginning of all being was a neutrum [the neutral force]. IT existed before the big bang. IT unleashed the great destruction. IT caused all the worlds in the Universe to originate from the explosion. IT, incorporeal primordial force, the decisive primordial command, became matter and IT knew the result of the great explosion. IT wanted to reach the stage of lived experience.”
It was the Russian physicist George Gamow (1904- ), a man known in the scientific world for his knack of inventing catch phrases, who Von Daniken credits with coming up with the name Big Bang.
Phyllis Schlemmer, a deep-trance channeler who has done numerous channelings over the past 20 or so years with a group of Beings who call themselves The Council of Nine, has collected these channelings into a book entitled The Only Planet of Choice: Essential briefings from deep space. Occasionally she has done these channelings before an invited audience of participants who, at one time, included Gene Roddenberry, the original creator of the Star Trek series and other programs such as Earth: Final Conflict. It is thought that Roddenberry may have gotten many of his ideas from these channelings because of the range of subjects covered in the various sessions.
The Council of Nine say that They are “a high-level circle of great beings who exist outside the Universe of space and time,” who are in connection with “one that is higher.” It is their responsibility, They say, “to maintain the energy-balances in this Universe.” We will be referring to their ideas often in various areas of this book because among the myriad sources of channeled works available these days, theirs are definitely of a higher vibration, and originate what has been determined to be by this author, a more valid source. We will also take the liberty during this work of referring to Them as ‘the Nine.’



15
Among their channelings are numerous references to an Original Cause sometimes called “the One,” as well as to the original act of Creation itself. A number of these references to the Creator and to the Creation also fit into the archetypal beliefs shared by other spiritual paths and religions, and vary across the whole range of methods by which Creation is thought to have happened:
The first idea is that Original Cause created because it felt alone:
“ . . there was one Creator, one energy, one pure light, one pure-being Self that contained all components of all that is. . . This self came into that beingness, knowledge, and wisdom to begin to divide the components of which it consisted, not to remove them but to build a structure, the Universe. For in its aloneness it had only self for companion. . . (It) was One that understood that it needed to become the many. So all of the many are in truth the One.”
The second is that Creation occurred through implosion rather than through explosion:
“The One breathed breathless by itself, and turning inward upon itself the tension of One, and became the manyfold all of varying densities and intensities of matter and spirit, with the potential to become one union.”
Third is that the first act of Creation created not everything in one go, but instead created the Trinity itself at first:
“There is what you call the Son, the Father and the Holy Spirit.”
The last of their ideas is that the Creator created co-workers to help IT in its Creation:
“ . . there are (also) those that are called “God’, that are appendages to God, that also create. . . a collection of beings that generate outward points of this source . . . Each of these entities has individual knowledge or principle, but not of the whole. There is only one that has the whole.”
According to the Council of Nine, it is, however, from the One that ultimately everything has its source:
“There is One, of the highest order, that is the purest of light, that is a composite of all, that creates all. Each soul in the whole Universe came directly from the true Creator, so each soul is imbued with this energy . . . Love is God. And it is love that creates the energy which feeds God—and makes God . . . God is . . unified, infinite intelligence, supported with pure love . . .”
This confirms the information which I have gotten for myself, in that, although it is such a difficult subject for one mind to grasp while still here in the physical body, Creation in and of itself was an act of Love, simply and plainly put. It was the ONE which IS acting upon ITSELF with all the Love at its limitless disposal and creating something of ITSELF with which IT could express this Love. Thus Boundless Love and Boundless Joy are Mankind’s rightful and due inheritance.
The idea that we came from the One and it is to the One that we return is an archetypal image. It can be seen in the teachings of a number of religions and spiritual paths. Sounding much like a conjoining of the religious and the antithetical scientific Big Bang Theory, the Nine have also described the Creation as a releasing of energy from this Original Source:
“ It was the releasing of the energy of the Creator that created . . . So the Creator, without all cells and particles, is not complete . . . So when all cells and particles came together, that was



16
the creation of an infinite-intelligence-Creator. . . each human knows in its innermost knowing that it is part of the Creator.”(77) . . . our growth as souls is the same as God’s growth as God . . . The infinite creation in its totality is the One Infinite Being, the One Being which is aware of itself to the extent that its different aspects are aware of themselves, as a part of all that is.”
Not separate interpretations of the act of Creation, these different statement of the Nine simply express the same idea in many different forms for many different levels of consciousness to understand. They try to explain the unexplainable in words that our human minds can get a grip on. This, too, is true of the final way in which these higher intelligence Beings seek to express the wonder and the awe of the original act of Creation, Again, it is an archetypal image that all of Creation exists in the body of God, that each one of us is a piece of the mirror that is God—the Creator, and that everything stems from intent:
“In the beginning was the Word” is a translation error according to the Nine. To Them it should be translated as the fact that the Creator came forth and said, “That which is, that which I am, will be . . . First, before the manifestation of any method or any creation there was the communication of Being . . . God created us in his own image . . . That means that all that God is you are, and all that God knows you know, all that is good is contained within you, all that is pure is contained within you.”
In his commentary on the information contained in the channelings, Palden Jenkens makes the statement that the channelings imply that not only were we created to receive love, but also to generate it in order to further God’s growth. This is similar to the idea contained in the recent movie The Matrix where human beings are considered to be power cells to be used by ‘mechanical beings.’ Only, in this case, people supply energy both to God, as well as gaining power from God. If it is anything that moves and supports us in this Creation, it is Love. And just as in The Matrix, it is the energy potential for Love that the Dark side seeks to steal from us and use because it is the ultimate energy of the Universe. How many of us here on the planet feel that we have been drained of all Love, and don’t understand how to replenish it? What is the seemingly ultimate search for each of one us within our own hearts but to find Love?
For Jenkins this idea of being apart of the much larger whole of the Creator Itself gives a very real sense of participating in Divinity, not just being subject to it. We, as humans, can “create a spiral feedback-loop of love where we are not just subjects of God, but active atoms within God,(and) in no way separate (from It).”
A somewhat more succinct version of the Creation can be found in the Holy Bible, Revised Standard Edition, where the first seed is described with very little fanfare:
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” (The correct Greek term for Word was logos, which could best be understood as ‘inherent order’ or ‘design.’)
The widespread influence of the Christian Church and its version of the Creation story on other religions and other cultures which they came to control, is evidenced in the Creation story of the Efe people of the African nation of Zaire.



17
The Efe tell a Creation story much like that of Genesis, but the Genesis myth is clearly assimilated into an even older story dating back into the misty dawn of time. Note, for instance, that the moon, a female figure, helps the Supreme Being in his act of creation of humans. Note, too, the familiar element or archetype of creation of the first beings out of clay, and once again, the presence of the almost ubiquitous Tree with the forbidden fruit.
“With help from the moon, The Supreme Being made a man, Baatsi, out of clay, which he covered with skin and filled with blood. He made a woman, too, and commanded the man to make children with her. “Only be sure to obey one rule,” he said. “Do not eat of the Tahu Tree.”
So it was that Baatsi fathered many children and his children fathered many more children, and everyone obeyed the rule. When they got old and tired they simply went happily to heaven. Everything went on this way until a pregnant woman with a craving for tahu fruit convinced her husband to break some off for her. Naturally the moon saw the man picking the fruit in the dark and she told her co-creator. Because of what the man and the woman did, we now all suffer the punishment of death. (Creation Myths-- Beier, 63)
Another ‘universal’ entity by the name of Ramtha is channeled by a number of people, including a woman named J.Z. Knight. In RAMTHA (The White Book), Ramtha tells a short but succinct version of what happened in the beginning, one which echoes that also channeled from the Council of Nine:
“Everything has been created by the sons from the thought that the Father is. And whatever the sons create becomes the expanded self of the Father.”
Colonel James Churchward, who wrote a series of books on the lost continent of Lemuria, tells us that in the ancient manuscripts of this primal land, science was also a part of religion. They were considered and looked upon as twin sisters. The first teachings that a man was given in his life was that there was an almighty, all-powerful, Creative God and that man owed his existence to Him.
“Then followed the teachings that man was a special creation, possessing a something that no other form of Creation on earth possessed—a soul or spirit. He was taught that this soul had everlasting life and never died. The material body returned to earth from whence it came, then released the soul, and it continued on. Apparently, when the forgoing was thoroughly instilled into his mind and he thoroughly comprehended it, lessons in science followed. Teachings were given that showed him the laws and works of Creation, such as the infinite wisdom in the arrangement of the Universe . . .”
The Gnostic Christian view, tells of a true, ultimate and transcendent God, who is beyond all created Universes and who never created anything in the sense in which the word “create” is ordinarily understood. While this True God did not fashion or create anything, He (or, It) “emanated” or brought forth from within Himself the substance of all there is in all the worlds, visible and invisible. In a certain sense, this agrees with so many different spiritual views that all things are in God, for all things consist of the substance of God.
By the same token, it must also be recognized that many portions of this original divine essence have been projected so far from their source that they have been weakened, an subsequently have undergone serious and unwholesome attempts to change their basic nature in



18
the process. To worship the cosmos, or nature, or embodied creatures can thus be tantamount to worshipping alienated and corrupt portions of the emanated divine essence.
The basic Gnostic myth has many variations, but all of these refer to Aeons, intermediate deific beings who exist between the ultimate, True God and ourselves as human beings. Together with the True God, they comprise the realm of Fullness (Pleroma) wherein the potency of divinity operates fully. The Fullness stands in contrast to our existential state, which in comparison may be called emptiness.
One of the aeonial beings who bears the name Sophia (“Wisdom”) is of great importance to the Gnostic world view. In the course of her journeyings, Sophia came to emanate from her own being a flawed consciousness, a being who became the creator of the material and psychic cosmos, all of which he created in the image of his own flaw. This being, unaware of his origins, imagined himself to be the ultimate and absolute God. Since he took the already existing divine essence and fashioned it into various forms, he is also called the Demiurgos or “half-maker.” There is an authentic half, a true deific component within creation, but it is not recognized by the half-maker and by his cosmic minions, the Archons or “rulers”.
Although any or all of these explanations may serve to partially satisfy and perhaps stimulate the conscious mind, there is a question as to how well words can describe or help us understand what the Supreme Creator is and is not. The spiritual hierarchy say that to truly comprehend the FATHER (for that is what THEY call HIM) is a task for one who is above the worlds of physical illusion and above the Darkness of this Universe. To use THEIR own words, “To say what the FATHER is, is to limit the FATHER. To say what the FATHER is not, is also to further limit the FATHER. HE IS.”
Their story of the Creation as it proceeded from the FATHER is not so succinct. In fact it contains much more detail which finally sheds some light upon the way in which this world has progressed, and is progressing, and explains many things about why we do not indeed live in such a ‘perfect Universe.’
Before we begin with this narrative, however, we would like to ask the reader to, if necessary, before you proceed with the next section, review those paragraphs in the Introduction that talk about the expansion of consciousness and not using old frameworks to understand new ideas.
The First Two Seeds
In the beginning, it is helpful to keep in mind that the word ‘Universe’ implies ‘one verse,’ and no real song or poem has simply just one verse. Many books are even being written these days about what is called the ‘omniverse.’ This, in fact, is the way things truly out there in the Creation for there are really seven, what are called, ‘Super Universes.’ Each and every one of these Super Universes containing countless smaller Universes within Universes. As the rings of the microcosmic aura of man contain the separate dimensions of his reality, so to does the Earth have its own dimensional aura, as does the Universe in which we exist, as do all of the levels higher and higher up this spiraling circle of existence.
Each one of these worlds within worlds within worlds is a holographic image that appears to be real when we are within it. Like a little nested set of Russian dolls, each one growing smaller and smaller until the macrocosm indeed does become the microcosm—for actually they are one



19
and the same thing, it is only our perception that makes it not so. Each of these levels is connected to each one of its higher levels like the layers of an onion—nature reflecting both the microcosm and the macrocosm in so many of its individual separate gifts. Anything having its existence on one level is also working on many of these higher different levels simultaneously, even though not consciously aware of that fact.
Everything is interconnected and cannot be separated, except as we would have it in our minds. A person who has lost an arm can still feel cold or heat from the separated arm sometimes for months afterwards because of the existence of that arm energy at a still higher level of existence, one which remains connected to the physical reality. This is called morphogenetic field theory. Even our thoughts, and at times our sympathetic nervous systems are also interconnected. We make and break connections between people on a personal level as we choose to see fit, but still the energies remain between each and every one of us there at the Universal level, existing as holograms living within holographic worlds of time and space and energy—until that time we choose to step beyond the level that we’re at and say I want to move on.
Seven is the number of Time, and Time relates to these seven Super Universes because they are holographically comprised of matter, energy, space and Time. In one of the key texts of history, The Emerald Tablets of Thoth, Thoth relates how Time is both a chain that binds the freedom of Soul, and the understanding of it is a key which can help us escape the confines of our earthly bounds. This excerpt is from Emerald Tablet X called The Key of Time, and also contains a very relevant vision of the Creation as told by a mystical figure known as the Dweller:
“Once, in a past time, I spoke to the Dweller. Asked of the mystery of time and space. Asked him the question that surged in my being, saying: “O Master, what is time?” “Then to me spoke He, the Master: “Know ye, O Thoth, in the beginning there was void and nothingness: a timeless, spaceless, nothingness. And into the nothingness came a thought, purposeful, all-pervading, and It filled the Void. There existed no matter, only force, a movement, a vortex of vibration of the purposeful thought that filled the Void.” “And I questioned the Master, saying: “Was this thought eternal?” And answered me the Dweller, saying: “In the beginning, there was eternal thought, and for thought to be eternal, time must exist. So into the all-pervading thought grew the Law of Time. Aye, time which exists through all space, floating in a smooth, rhythmic movement that is eternally in a state of fixation. Time changes not, but all things change in time. For time is the force that holds events separate, each in its proper place. Time is not in motion, but ye move through time as your consciousness moves from one event to another. Aye, by time ye exist, all in all, an eternal One existence. Know ye that even though in time ye are separate, yet still are One in all times existent.” Ceased then the voice of the Dweller, and departed I to ponder on time. For knew I that in these words lay wisdom and a way to explore the mysteries of time.
“List ye, O man. Take of my wisdom. Learn of the deep hidden mysteries of space. Learn of the Thought that grew in the abyss, bringing Order and Harmony in space. Know ye, O man, that all that exists has being only because of the Law. Know ye the Law and ye shall be free, never be bound by the fetters of night . . . Seek ye and learn that Time is the secret whereby ye may be free of this space.”
Time is a key element is the controlling of Mankind on this planet, and we have not heard the last of on our journey throughout history.



20
Within these grander Super Universes, the individual smaller Universes are in turn made up of galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and solar systems such as are our own.
The first of these seven Super Universes is called the Central Universe—and it is a Universe far beyond the realms of this one known as Nebadon, as correctly explained in the Book of Urantia and the works of Gabriel of Sedona.
In this Central Universe resides the actual source of what we would term ‘God,’ though far beyond the comprehension of anything Mankind has ever thought of God before. As HE is referred to by the Spiritual Hierarchy and by the few on this planet who are able to have contact with HIM, HE is called ‘the FATHER’.
Harold Klemp, spiritual master of Eckankar, lists in one of his works the fundamental principles which can be attributed to the FATHER, or what he calls the Godhead. These are:
• Reality is an all-embracing unity;
• the Ultimate is nameless;
• within the Self the Ultimate is to be found;
• IT can be known by acquaintance;
• and reality is disclosed only to those who meet ITs conditions.
As suggested in some of the earlier theories of Creation we have so far looked at, in the first act of Creation, the FATHER had two firstborn ‘children’ created from the LIGHT that HE IS. These two Beings are called RAJ and HAROON. RAJ is what is called the “Eternal Son” or “Original Creator Son.” HE is, as you can imagine, a very, very, very powerful Spirit, by that meaning powerful energy-wise or vibration-wise. HAROON is what is called ‘the Infinite Mother Spirit,’ ‘The Holy Spirit’ or ‘The Infinite Spirit.’ THEY all have THEIR existence within the Central Universe, and are the original TRINITY – the FATHER, RAJ, and HAROON.
These are the pure, positive God worlds in the Highest Realms of existence. As we get into the ‘lower’ worlds of Creation, the pure, positive nature of the FATHER’s Light splits into the positive male aspect and the negative female aspect. The terms do not refer to their ‘good or bad’ nature, but simply relate to their electro-magnetic charge such as you have on a magnet or on the diametrically opposed poles of a car battery.
Although RAJ and HAROON are referred to by words which have a gender connotation, THEY are both positive and negative in and of themselves. This again is the original TRINITY grouping from which all the power of the Universes evolved. This is where it all began . . . In the Beginning.
Subsequent acts of Creation then took place from ‘the union of energies’ of either the FATHER and HAROON, HAROON and RAJ, or the FATHER and RAJ. What came forth as ‘offspring’ from these unions were other ‘Creator Sons’ and ‘Infinite Mother Spirits,’ powerful Light Beings or Spirits, if you want to call Them that, whose job was to further create. That was their job. Kind of like sub-contractors, a Creator Son and an Infinite Mother Spirit would be given an area of what can only be termed the Void, into which They were then to go out and create another level of the Universe.



21
Although SOUL in its entirety was created by the FATHER, the individual manifestation of the sparks or pieces of SOUL that we are, comes through ‘the union’ of these ‘lesser’ Creator Sons and Infinite Mother Spirits—what Gnostic Scriptures refer to as ‘the Demi-urge.’ There are seven Super Universes, but within these super Universes the role of these other Creator Sons and Infinite Mother Spirits is to act as a kind of “Oversoul” or set of parents or guardians for those individual expressions of the FATHER who They help manifest.
The whole purpose of the work that these Creator Sons and these Infinite Mother Spirits are sent to do in creating the individual Universes, is to do it through the LIGHT energy of the FATHER. They must, in Their work, be receptive of the FATHER’s energy, for that is the only real Life Force in Creation. They then use this energy, allowing IT to pass through them into Their subsequent creation--the individual essences of Soul.
These Creator Sons and Infinite Mother Spirits are, as said, like the creator parents of a Universe. Like parents here on this planet, Their job is also to ‘be responsible’ for the Souls they help manifest for there is always that bond between Them, much as we have here on Earth. The FATHER sends the unmanifested Soul(s) out to be manifested by a Creator Couple who then place it somewhere in Their Universe so that it can begin gaining experience. Like sending a child off to school for the first time, These Creator Beings leave the individuals sparks to the care and training of the teachers set up throughout the various levels of Heaven to assist them throughout their learning process. The Parent Creators, however, also bear the responsibility to help the “manifested Souls” to return again to the FATHER as ‘fully aware Souls’ in order to have them then assist in furthering the creative process. The best analogy here is a power station sending out its power to sub-stations, then from there that electricity passes along to junction boxes and finally to individual households and the single power outlet that powers the equipment. Without the reduction in the energy as it passes through these various steps, the equipment would be overwhelmed and would subsequently burn up as a result. So to would we, in our lowered states of consciousness, be ‘burnt up’ by the energy of the FATHER without connecting through these various ‘adapter’ units.
The FATHER, as we shall continue to call HIM from now on, experiences HIS Creation through those who are created, as expressed in many of the ideas we have already looked at about Creation. We are indeed, each a part of the Divine FATHER, and as such add to and draw from HIS Divine Energy and Light. Or that’s the way it is supposed to work and does work in six out of the seven Super Universes . . .
The Story of Nebadon
In this Universe, the Creator Son’s name is Enjliou. The Infinite Mother Spirit is named Callia.
These Beings may be loosely equated to the Gnostic Scriptural idea found on a manuscript fragment at Nag Hammadi entitled First Thought in Three Forms in which “Three forms” of the invisible spirit’s “first thought” are equated to the barbelo aeon as the second principle or male creator spirit, and life known as Zoë, the negative female energy creator spirit. The Divine Word of God or Spirit, known as the Logos, is the third and neutral force which binds these two together to form the trinity necessary for the proper act of Creation.
Gnostic scriptural scholar Bentley Layton points out the emphasis laid upon the emanation and incarnation of the pre-existent Word (Logos), which is identified in some Gnostic manuscripts



22
with not only the pre-existent anointed (Christ) but also with the Barbelo itself—thus giving people the idea that Christ and God were one and the same Being. It is his thought that some scholars have considered this myth of the Word to also be closely related to the source of the prologue of the Gospel of John, the “In the beginning . . .” version of the Creation.
Ceanne DeRohan, author of a series of books that tells of the Creation in this Universe from the point of view of these Creator Parents relates Enjliou’s experience on first becoming aware of Himself in His own words. It also possibly serves as a reminder of what it might have been like the first time we were manifested, or even possibly what it is like for us as a newborn baby first removed from the womb and beginning to become aware of our own innate Beingness:
“When consciousness became aware that it had existence, it had to realize everything. Nothing was realized yet except that I had become aware of Myself. Consciousness had to feel also or it could not know. In fact, a feeling of having consciousness is the way in which I realized I had consciousness. There were no words at first, only a feeling that I had existence. I had desire to know more.
“. . . I had the concept of a place within Myself then also. I tried to find the place that did not feel good so I could know it. I had just started my search when I realized there were many more places that did not feel good than I had realized before I began looking for them. In realizing I felt bad, I realized I had been feeling good. I wondered if it was right to try to feel Myself. I wondered if it was right to feel that some places felt good and others did not. I wondered if trying to feel them made these places not feel good. I felt confusion and fear. I wanted something that could explain it to Me so I could know. I felt lonely and somewhat timid about trying to feel Myself for fear of what I might find.
“All of this passed fleetingly through My consciousness while I was trying to ignore it in favor of My desire to know more. My desire to know more was leading Me on. I found out many things in My own way at that time. I stumbled onto most of them by having an experience and then realizing it. I felt most impatient with Myself. Already guilt had been born in me as a little voice telling Me that I should do better than I was doing.
“I had realized many more things than I could list. You must feel within yourselves to find your memory of what you experienced in a latent state of consciousness, for you were all there in a state of slumber, and you have the ability to know how existence began. These original experiences have affected you ever since. You need to go back to the origins of your consciousness to know what your earliest experiences were, just as I had to understand mine, because Lost Will has its origins there also.”
Enjliou and Callia were sent out to do what many, many other Creator Sons and Infinite Mother Spirits had done before them. They were created together as a unit, as a pair, as two halves of the same being–from which we get the idea of complimentary beings or Soulmates, to function together in whatever Their different capacities were. The primary responsibility in Creation, however, is not to ‘turn your back,” as it were, on the Will of the FATHER, to instead allow creation to flow through you, to be a vehicle for the Higher Will. Although the primary rule of all the FATHER’s Creation is that all Beings should have Free Will, those Souls who are in alignment with Creation use their Free Will to follow the Higher Will of the FATHER. This is necessary for it is only through the Will of the FATHER that all things in Creation are held together in an atmosphere of Light and Love and Endless Constant Creativity.



23
At the time of the creation of this Universe, Nebadon, all was perfectly in harmony and in balance. The Creator Son and the Infinite Mother Spirit of this Universe, ENJLIOU and CALLIA were in balance. And then something happened. It was in the briefest of moments, the smallest fraction of a moment in infinity, that a doubt arose in Enjliou and Callia in the form of Self-will, and the two of Them found themselves in an unbalanced state which would then descend into duality, distrust, and dissension.
There is a general perception that everything God does is perfect, and that therefore everything in Creation must be perfect as well. That idea dismisses the central theme of Creation that everyone has Free Will. In the other Super Universes, this is the way it works—everyone has agreed to use their Free Will to surrender to that Will to be a part of the Higher Will of the Father. This is not a mindless, irresponsible state like one might consider a member of a collective to be. Instead it is the highest state of being a conscious co-worker with the Creator, the ultimate purpose and end product of all our experiences here throughout existence.
Schlemmer’s Council of Nine try to explain it in a way that may help this idea be understood more clearly:
“. . . obedience doesn’t sacrifice free will, it in fact promotes it because you don’t give obedience that importance . . . Conscience arises as a result of having erred . . . we (in this Universe) have now developed a habit, an addiction to error. . . Perversely, further error makes previous errors more comfortable to live with. . . we might feel helplessly impelled to step into yet further error, since not doing so implies facing up to all the previous errors. . . it is we who need to forgive ourselves . . . the real importance is the exercise of free will in obedience.”
What happened with Enjliou and Callia, in this moment of imbalance, was that they turned away from the FATHER. In doing so, They also turned away from the feeling, from the intent, to do it in the FATHER’s way, and instead decided to it in Their own Self-willed way, the right thing but for the wrong reason. This single moment in eternity would have disastrous results for everyone manifested here in this Universe ever since that point in Time.
It was Enjliou that took charge and turned away from receiving the guidance that was there for Him to receive from the FATHER and from the other TRINITY ONE members. This Creator Couple had not been sent out into the Void without the continued loving support and guidance of Those who created Them. Like loving parents who do their best to raise a child, one day they must, however, allow that child to go forth on its own, and their responsibility for that child’s actions ends there—and the child’s Free Will takes over. It is the child’s choice to follow the wisdom and guidance it has had in its formative years, or not.
Although They were made in perfection when they went out, Enjliou and Callia somehow or other just didn’t grow from that moment forward. They also didn’t use that power that was given to Them in a righteous and in a loving way. This created the imbalance. As the Spiritual Hierarchy tell it, although They wanted to fulfill Their responsibility in creating and supporting Their Creation in this Universe, They had lost the intent to do it through the FATHER’s Will, and instead chose to do it for Their own selfish motives.
Again, They wanted to do the right thing, but for simply the wrong reason. Intent is everything. This is the way it is both on the microcosmic level of our own individual level of selfresponsibility, and also on the macrocosmic level of the Creator.



24
Here again, we must go back to the idea of archetypes as discussed in the first chapter. If any of the actions of Enjliou and Callia sound familiar in our own lives, it is because They were, and ARE, the archetypes of our own individual actions. They are also the original archetype for much of what has happened and is currently happening on this planet as well as the influence They still manifest in the lives of each and every one of us.
Even though these two very powerful, at first very loving, and wonderfully creative Beings had everything in Creation supporting them, exercising Their Free Will, they chose to turn away from It and go their own separate way. What then became of them was that their relationship disintegrated until what we were left with was the original archetype of a very abusive male and his submissive, docile woman partner. This is evident in so many couples around us, and even possibly in our own lives. It is a case of the mental male half of our beings denying the emotional female side, or conversely, the female emotional side denying the strength and power of its own masculine half. This is the cause of all the current problems on this planet since, like the original dream that triggered the writing of this book, the female side of Man is being suppressed and denied its rightful place in Creation. The Patriarchy has gone to great lengths over the centuries to make sure the feminine role in Creation has been denied or exorcised from all its religious beliefs expressly for the purpose of control. Abortion, the single biggest issue of a women’s right to choose and control her own destiny, is still the hottest topic on the planet in terms of politics and right of women to be free.
As in most abusive situations, it was not all one partner’s fault. Both partners must take responsibility for the imbalance in their own nature. The victim is as much to blame as the abuser for the choices they make that find them remaining in that abusive circumstance. In the case of Enjliou and Callia, it’s just that what started to happen, happened all at once.
Neither of Them understood the impact of what They were doing, nor the power which either one of Them could bring into play. Where Enjliou was coming from was an archetypal place of frustration, the result was “the abuse, the neglect, the anguish” of the situation in which They eventually found themselves. Still, Callia was as much to blame as Enjliou. She didn’t stand up for her own rights and power either so that power struggles began to arise in the relationship. Archetypally, what it came out like was nagging, not being happy with things, and other actions which still exist as the hallmark of females who allow themselves to remain in a state of victimhood within any kind of relationship or marriage.
This was all happening over vast periods of Time, keeping in mind that at the level of Creation we are talking about, Time does not exist in the same form as we currently know it. It was, to say the least, an extremely long time. There has, however, only been one Universe, one element of Creation, that went astray like this one. The consequences of that one imbalance between these two has affected all of Creation, and now threatens to do even more.
The Creation of this Universe thus took on an imbalanced state and was propelled forward by this imbalance into ever-darkening reaches of the Universe until it was no longer a Universe as such, a place of Oneness with the FATHER, but instead a Universe of duality.
Enjliou and Callia’s first act of creation together in the Void was to create their own firstborn son, if you will. His name is ARTOLA. He is a very loving being with a warm and gentle disposition, and is referred to in De Rohan’s works as HEART. Since the Creator Parents weren’t getting along, even at this time –ARTOLA filled the gap between them, the archetypal



25
circumstance of a woman having a child to bring the husband and wife “closer together.” ARTOLA, archetypally, became a pawn to be used by either parent in Their struggles against one another.
ARTOLA then acted as a fulcrum or balancing point for HIS two parents, and for quite a long time—eons of time as it were—things were quite a bit better between Them. If this sounds like a family you know, either one you are related to, or one next door or down the road from you, you will begin to understand the archetypal effect our Cosmic Parents have had on the lives we now lead on earth, much as our physical parents have had an archetypal effect on the lives we lead individually.
Heart’s own Story
“I was just feeling good and floating in the reveric aftermath of the orgasms without questioning, or letting Myself question the rightness or the wrongness of feeling good. I wanted to feel good, and that was all. I did not know that I needed to assimilate this lower part of Me more and understand it more. I was enjoying the sensations there without assimilating what it meant or anything more about it other than it was pleasure.
“. . . I now know it was not a knowing there that was the difference between a lover and an adolescent rushing ahead because he’s wild to release the pressure of sexual frenzy and can’t think of anything else until he has done this, but I did not like anyone or anything else telling Me what to do, and so I did not listen to input from any other parts of Myself.
“I did not know how to handle My own physicality there, but I also did not notice that my physicality could have had any knowingness that could have helped Me there, or that the other voices I had been listening to did either. I felt they all must not be feeling it as intensely as I was, or they could not be telling Me to hold back and go slower.
“Instead of being made to feel wrong, I wanted to make Them wrong. It was partly true that They were not feeling it just the same as I was, had Their own point of view and that We were not able to get a mingling that resulted in an alignment there, but My feelings of sexual urgency pushed past Them with a rage that seemed to come out of nowhere and accuse the voices of My former companions of holding back wrongly and of trying to hold Me back wrongly.
“. . . From the very beginning, He did not like me displeasing Him with feelings that were not in agreement with His. I do not know how I got offered up to Him or placed in His care, but it happened this way according to My Mother.
“. . . She had to move rage and terror, but She did not know it then She did not know anything then, except that she was and did not like where She was, or maybe, what She was, since She did not know the difference among things then.
“. . . Maybe They had Their reasons, but I felt disowned and disinherited from every pleasure I had learned to love with My Father. I felt pushed out as though I had no Mother there who had any feelings for Me. My Father had only a lover who viewed Me as an interference in whatever it was They had going on. I served no purpose as far as She could tell, and he did not notice me in any favorable way either. Had She cast Him under a spell where He had no longer cared about His child, His Son, as He had called Me?”
From the split between the two Creator Parents also came the Father of Manifestation as he is termed in De Rohan’s work, the being known as Lucifer. While initially I thought Lucifer was



26
another ‘son’ of Callia and Enjliou, what I have been led to understand is that Lucifer was a splitting off of that Dark energy which came from the Being of Light that Enjliou is. The archetype that will best help describe this situation which occurred in the creation of Lucifer is from Robert Louis Stevenson’s timeless novel of ‘good and evil’ – Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In Mary Reilly, one of the more recent film versions made from this classic novel, we see how Mr. Hyde is absorbed back into the body of the pained Dr. Jekyll. If we reverse this situation and extrapolate it to apply to a Creator Son of incredible vibration and energy, we have the likely situation which occurred in the birthing of the Darkness known as Lucifer.
Even the words spoken by Dr. Henry Jekyll as he becomes Mr. Hyde: "Free—free at last!” help explain the archetypal feelings of a son felt trapped by the institution of a family home where abuse and imbalance have created him as he is, and everything seems so far apart from the norm.
Lucifer was born out of the loneliness and sadness created between Enjliou and Callia – a child born with his own sense of loneliness and frustration. But he was beautiful, and seductive, and intelligent. He was everything that any creation would want to be. And in some ways, of course, he thought he was better than his Father, better than Enjliou, the Creator Son.
As we shall also soon see, this situation of imbalance between the Creator Parents and their ‘offspring’ also brought into existence other beings who were not created wholly in Light as they are in the other Universes, but also in Darkness. The worlds of duality were brought into existence at that time, and the struggles of the Universe and of its Creator Parents have gone on from that one moment into the eternity which is the nowness of time, constantly upgrading and worsening the state of unresolved duality that exists in these worlds.
Gnostic teachings have always included this idea that the Universe, and subsequently the world, were created by a pair of “damaged” Creator Parents. This , to them, was a way of explaining why Darkness seemed to have such a foothold on the planet—for Darkness is the opposite of the Light which the FATHER IS, and from which all of HIS Creation should also be made.
Although many of us consider black to be a color, black is actually defined as the absence of color, hence, Darkness is a place which is the absence of the FATHER’s Light. The black holes of Creation which scientists postulate as existing, are actually places where it is so Dark that they suck in all that is Light, not even allowing Light to escape.
Schlemmer’s Council of Nine refer to Lucifer as ‘the Opposition’ –He who is in opposition to the FATHER and to the goals of the FATHER in Creation. They say they do not even like to use his name because of the negative vibration it carries.
“. . . that which became the negative went in competition with God: he does not represent them . . .”
For the moment, however, we need to leave Lucifer after his manifestation and return to what was happening further in the Creation of this Universe. Lucifer shall be treated in a separate section in a later chapter where His role grows more central to our story.
The Disharmony Continues in the Act of Creation
Being used to a Biblical account of the Creation may tend to lead a person to believe that the Creation of a Universe is simply a matter of snapping the fingers and saying the magic word,



27
and presto—one Universe, all complete. Unfortunately this is not the case, and as we shall find out later in the book, the structure of the Universe is indeed very intricate and involved.
Gregg Braden’s experience in the earth sciences and in the aerospace industry has led him to explore the nature and structure of the Universe. His work in these areas suggests to him that ancient sciences have indeed predicted what modern science now suspects, that light does not travel in a straight line.
“Within the grid/vortex framework of creation, geometric evidence suggests that “light” moves as a series of curves following a very special form of connected curves; the logarithmic spiral . . . curving in the direction that is most in harmony with the spirals of light emanating from the radiant source at the center of our own Milky Way.”
According to Braden, this curved path of light even guides the earth in its movement, for it is, he suggests, toward this pattern of light that earth is moving “in an attempt to resonantly match the reference signals generated as we pass through the “new light” of the electromagnetic zone known as the “Photon Belt.
The creative element actually used in manifesting Light in all its intricate shades and variations throughout the Universe is Sound or “tone”. This is the Cosmic Word or Logos as described in the Gnostic teachings, that third and neutral force that binds the male and female, positive and negative energies together into the form of new creation. Each one of the various levels of Creation exist as a separate frequency, much like the notes on a musical scale. To reach another station on a radio dial we simply have to adjust the tuner, so too may we “tune in” to a different vibratory level in order to access the various levels of existence. From the Sound we also get the idea of harmony in the Universe, and things that are ‘inharmonius’ or that ‘rub us the wrong way.’
Enjliou and Callia were in a deep state of inharmony as they progressed through the act of Universal creation, not knowing quite what the next step would be. Instead of turning to the FATHER and receiving that guidance and instruction, however, again they took the power of decision upon themselves and created in their own inharmonious way.
Enjliou, the Universal Father, archetypally then goes on about His business of creating, burying Himself in his work on the creation and development of the Universe. In doing so, he tends to ignore Callia, the Universal Mother. Gradually he comes to see her as useless in the process, worthless even, an attitude that she too, archetypally takes on and incorporates into her own self-image. The Universal Victim archetype is created—an archetype from which humanity has suffered ever since. Enjliou would not allow her to be a part of the creative process as she had a right and a necessity to be. Instead of standing up for herself, however, and being assertive about it and doing what she needed to do, Callia fell into a downward spiral from which the idea of self-pity eventually sprang. As so many women on this planet have been taught to do over the millennia by female role models, Callia just hung back and felt worthless. This caused a lot of emotional pain in the Mother and She was not, and still is not, able to move it. Not until all the children on all the planets under Her creation heal themselves of the archetypal attitudes of woman as a victim, will she be able to once again center Herself in Her power.
As some religious texts suggest, the sins of the parents are visited upon their children, even unto the fifth generations. For all of us, the archetypal attitudes and actions of our Cosmic Parents, affect us every day. Even more in this case does it becomes a matter of not only are we



28
parenting to our own children the way we were parented to, but indeed we are all reliving over and over again the archetype of our own Universal Creator Parents.
The role in Creation which the Mother is supposed to perform is to open space so that the Father can fill it and manifest the Creation, using the Divine Spark of Original Cause—the Cosmic Word or Spirit known as the Logos. Noted astrological counselor, spiritual teacher, and writer Barbara Clow expresses it this way:
“Women . . . are the guardians of place. . . . they carry intuitive knowledge about the real purpose of place . . . Women know how to create in time and activate space for new life, and so they will lead the men in the new alchemy.”
Enjliou and Callia truly needed to work together in order for the act of Creation to work properly, but because of the dissension and disharmony between them, things never really quite got off the ground.
None of what was going on here in this Universe escaped the notice of the Trinity One beings in the Central Universe. Seeing that things weren’t working right, Enjliou and Callia were taken back time and time again to the Central Universe for healing and for counseling, as we might think of it. Not just once, but many times. Some of these times They were taken back together. Other times it was just one or the other, whatever it took in order for the healing process to begin and to move forward. As long as They kept up this behavior, not only would They eventually ruin themselves in the process, but They would also create children of less than adequate Light, for it is in the process of Creation that Universal and personal Love is transmitted to that which is being created. So to, today, do each and everyone of us carry with us that feeling that was inherent in our parents during the mating act that created us. Locked into the matrix or fabric of our cells is either love, or lust, or anger, or whatever emotion was carried in the auric field of those two people who were creating us. And there it remains, affecting every moment of our lives, just as every act of manifestation by our Creator Parents created children lacking in the normal complement of Light and of Sound. Perhaps all men are created equal in the sight of God, as some religions teach, but not all individual manifestations of Soul have the same potential for carrying the Light of the FATHER within them.
The earlier manifestations created the spiritual hierarchy of the Universe, the Archangels, angels, devas and so on down the line. Even these felt the lack of something in their Creation and manifested it in their actions. These earliest manifestations of Soul into the Universe did not want for much in terms of their full complement of Light. As the dissension and disagreement progressed, however, eventually individual expressions of Soul were manifested that were severely lacking in the amount of Light energy they could carry, making them more and more susceptible to outside influences. And, back at the heart of the creative process, Enjliou and Callia continued acting like unhealed parents to the ‘children’ they were creating.
For those of us who have ever felt alone or unloved in the Universe, this may indeed be the cause. In an article I wrote on Choice along with the Spiritual Hierarchy, the choice was given to us to focus on the dysfunctional energy of the local Universe creators, or the true loving and glorious Light of Original Cause—that of the FATHER. That choice still remains true today. Where should we put our attention to find the true Love in the Universe? At what level do we choose to focus our attention, and to what level of Love and of Live do we aspire? If we still seek to find love from our Creator Parents, much as we might from dysfunctional earthling parents, we will always



29
fall short of finding this love that we seek. Only if we look to the Highest will we ever find a love that does not fail.
It was while in this abusive, neglectful state that Enjliou kicked the Mother out into the Void to be alone. The best way to describe what happened to Her is to say She got lost out there somewhere in the Void. Eventually, although near drained of all her Light, She managed to make it back to the Created portion of the Universe on Her own.
Ceanne De Rohan shares with us from her work the feelings of Enjliou that led up to this most unique and momentous event in the history of Creation:
“I had to let her know that I was not angry with Her over this, and yet in realizing She was hiding, I suspected She had not experienced the pleasure I had had or She would know I was not angry. I then experienced guilt that She had not experienced the same pleasure. Lost Will has My blame as well as all the other feelings I thought I had to deny here to make our partnership work. I had to feel Her to know whether I was right or not, and She was trying not to let Me find Her. It was not easy to make Her hear Me above the roar of the fear and guilt within her, but I finally succeeded in getting her to listen.
“I had a voice of guilt telling Me that punishment was what I deserved because I had misjudged and mistreated Her. I had even called Her “It” and “The Bothersome Thing” in the beginning without bothering to feel “The Thing” enough to find out that It had all the qualities now associated with feminine.
“I had hurled Her out into space to be lost in terror. I had feared “this thing,” and without much effort at any approach, I had tried to get it away from Me so that I did not have to fear it or be bothered by it. I also realized again that I had loved it or Her, and had not allowed Myself to realize that I could not get rid of the feelings I didn’t like without getting rid of Her. She was changeable; I knew that now. I had thought unpleasantness was a thing that I could get rid of, and had not realized it also had the feelings I now loved. I saw that movement had brought it from feelings I didn’t like into feelings I did like. Now that I had realized all this, why wasn’t the Will opening to Me?
“The Will was holding still because She had so much fear of feeling what She was feeling. She had clenched to avoid the pain of it. She did not know She had My acceptance this time to move Her pain by moving Her feelings. My light and love would have flowed into Her this time but She did not know it. She was caught in fear from the past that I would not accept her. She feared that if She opened to expressing how She felt, She would receive denial of light and love again. She had many more feelings at that time also, but She could not move any of them because She had too much fear of Me pushing Her out. She had thought I enjoyed moving with Her this last time, but She was too afraid to find out for sure in case She didn’t have the right understanding.
“. . . Healing it is not possible without feeling it, but feeling terror with light pouring into it and lifting it is a very different experience for this essence than it has been having. Terror has been experiencing itself in ways that have no love or acceptance present . . . I had loved “the thing” that had moved and did not know it.”
ARTOLA too suffered from neglect. As ENJLIOU began colluding more with Lucifer than with ARTOLA, along the way, He too was abandoned in the great VOID of limitless space. In the business of their work in Creation, Enjliou and Callia had both neglected ARTOLA, and He was



30
as such left by the wayside in the forward movement of Creation. This, however, was just the start. Later on he was actually forced out and away from the other group of Three Beings due to Lucifer’s jealousy and desire to dominate the attention of his ‘Parents.’ Once again, a central archetype of history is the feud between sibling rivalries, especially two ‘brothers’ as such Lucifer and ARTOLA were perceived to be. For ARTOLA it was HIS gentleness of spirit that allowed him to be cast out into the Void by the energies of the Parents’ neglect and by Lucifer’s desire to dominate the whole of Creation.
ARTOLA found Himself alone and lost in the Void. If it is difficult to imagine being lost in space, try looking at a photograph of space, and then multiply the emptiness in between the stars thousands and thousands of times to equate what you are might imagine the Void to look like before Creation entered onto the scene. This Super Universe is really more on the outskirts of Original Creation compared with most of the other Universes as well, so He was really ‘out there’ in relation to where the other Beings were located in terms of Space and Time.
After countless aeons, ARTOLA could eventually see, off in the far, far distance a Light. And for a long, long time he was all alone, trying to reach this Light. The Light was the Light of the other Super Universes, and as He made his way toward that Light, He could see the colors around the part of the Universe that Enjliou, Callia and Lucifer had created, and the colors there were attractive but they were not the pure white Light of the other Super Universes.
Eventually, making it back to the Light of the Central Universe, ARTOLA was ‘adopted’ and raised by RAJ and HAROON—kind of like a stepchild. Taken in and nurtured by the Love of the FATHER and of the other Trinity One beings. ARTOLA grew to the stature and consciousness that HE is currently, higher even than that of Enjliou the Creator Son, HIS Father. Joseph of the coat on many colors in the Christian Bible, is just such an example of this archetypal story in history.
After the long period of His healing and subsequent growth in the Central Universe, ARTOLA was given the choice to stay and work for the FATHER and for Creation from There, or to come back here to this Universe, Nebadon, in order to help in the healing of His Parent and of Their Creation. The decision HE made was to return here to be of service to the FATHER in helping with the problems of this Universe, and He is currently the head of the Forces of Light in the coming battle against Lucifer that is about to take place in this Universe.

Chapter 3 --The Drama in The Universe Continues
I could see that as love purifies us, it bares in us those areas most in need of growth. In this struggle with love, our emptiness and fear are unearthed and pain is released. As we see and accept ourselves in this process, and understand and respect the others, we become more aware of our wholeness. Rick and Louisa Clerici: Sparks from the Fire of Time
Planet Earth was originally created to be a Garden of Eden. As many books on the subject may tell you, it is the most beautiful planet of its kind in the entire Universe. The reason for this is because it was originally planned not as a planet for habitation, but rather to be a hideaway lovenest for both Enjliou and Callia. It’s intent was to be a getaway place from the varied pressures of Creation and the ‘kids’. That is why it is so unique in the Universe, and indeed in all of Creation.
It might seem strange to us perhaps that ‘God’ takes a vacation, but remember ‘as above, so it is below’. Rest points in eternity are important on every level of expression of Soul, whether it be the higher, more advanced ones, or those who are just beginning to enter into the cycle of cosmic learning. So it was for the Creator Parents as well. And what better place to rest than on a small blue and green orb stuck far way from everything, right out in the very corner of the Universe. Its peacefulness lay not just in its beauty as a dream place to vacation, but also in its privacy.
Other Universal Beings such as Ramtha, and here again, Schlemmer’s Council of Nine, echo the same opinion of this planet’s uniqueness:
“. . . your planet Earth is the most beautiful that exists in the Universe. It has a physical variety that no other planet has. . . . It has aspects of all planets. It is like a composite of the Universe.”
In the Gnostic Scriptures we find a textual fragment entitled The Uniqueness of the World that also hints at this uniqueness. The ancient manuscript refers to an early church father named Basilides and describes his model of the universe in which there are 365 heavens, but only a single world. This model, interestingly enough, also suggests that the heavens he speaks of are concentrically arranged about the earth, much as we have described the dimensions of existence to be arranged around every living thing in Creation. The number of dimensions perceived depending on the shades of difference where one is willing to draw a line.
Scholar Bernard Layton agrees that the doctrine that the world is unique was a philosophical commonplace, accepted by Stoics as well as other early schools of Christian thought.
In truth the Earth was also designed as one enormous temple – a monument to the FATHER, built to harmonize with the universal galactic center, as are all planets, and as can and will be seen by the ruins evident on Mars and on other planets in other solar systems as we begin to branch out further into space. The temples built by the various religions, and worshipped in by so many millions of people each week, are simply smaller versions of the planetary temple. They are built along the same pattern or gridworks of that of the planet and indeed of the Universe itself. They are built, however, on a smaller scale and to a lesser degree of energy and of



32
vibration. While the planet is the microcosm (again we get the series of nested Russian dolls, stepping up and down the energies of Creation from one level to another), the solar system steps up to the higher level of the galaxy, to a level of a nebulae, to a level of a smaller Universe and so on up the ladder until eventually we come to find that this Super Universe is a smaller scale model of the Grand Central Universe of the original Creator ITSELF. Control of the temples, and of the temple aspect of the planet is a key element in controlling the people on the planet as we shall find when dealing with the history, control mechanisms, and future plans of the coming New World Order.
Ruth Norman, in her History of the Universe Volume I, describes this exact concept only in the very exact reverse order:
“And so we go down into the lower octaves of the various planetary structures within these whirling galaxies which, in a harmonious way, constantly receive and send the pulse beats of the Infinite Mind so synchronously that there is a constant relaying of great intelligence throughout the fiber that makes up these great island continents. Because of the great mechanics involved in this manner, the Spiritual brotherhood of Unarius is so organized that it works in and within this great organism, to be effective in a most helpful manner, down into the lowest of the chromatic structures of the universe.”
Michael Lawrence Morton, a planetary grid researcher cannot help but express the wonder of the exactness that he finds in the complex construction of the Earth’s energetic:
“And every Grid Point has a Grid Latitude and a Grid Longitude, and every Grid Latitude and Grid Longitude has a *precise* number of arc-degrees, arc-minutes, and 'fractional' arc-seconds ... that's FRACTIONAL numbers of arc-seconds...so that we are talking about an AMAZINGLY specific and precise SET of correlations, here. Do you understand the 'magnitude' of the significance of this?”
The intricacy involved with Creation shall be taken up at various points throughout the book to save from stretching the limits of the reader’s mind all in one go. To find out that the Creation story itself has been known since the advent of life here on this planet, may not, however, be such a stretch for the individual imagination. Hidden away in the language of myth and metaphor in numerous Creation stories from around the world have always been the thinly veiled references to these very same archetypal Creators.
One such reference is to be found at the beginning of the enuma elish, the Babylonian creation epic:
“When on high the heaven had not yet been named, Firm ground below had not been called by a name, Nought but primordial Apsu, their begetter, And Mummu, and Tiamat—she who bore them all, Their waters mingled as a single body.”
Here, Apsu (the male) represents the Creator Father, Enjliou; Mummu, also male, represents ARTOLA, the son; and Tiamat, the female, she who bore them all, represents the Creator Mother, Callia. The division into the male and female aspects necessary to create, can also be seen in the division present in the two hemispheres of the brain. Here we have both a masculine and a feminine side, but it is the combination of the two sides that will allow an



33
individual being to fulfill the old adage that it takes both a mind and a heart to ascend into Heaven.
“I can feel this process happening as thought and thought and thought. This idea created itself into a series of processes and beings who defined, limited and controlled matter. This universe of processes and experiences was not made by the universal COSMIC CREATOR: this world with a beginning and an end was created by a lesser urge, the demi-urge, which expressed itself as “the gods.” On Earth, we have experienced this creation as the Luciferian rebellion, the Orion Agenda, the communion with the cycle of the gods who came down which is now coming to a close. Before the creation of the third dimension—a universe brought into existence so that we could consciously learn how to be in a holy state, zero, the numinous—before matter, time, and form, there was only the infinity of God and the Void (the feminine principle). Once consciousness or thought occurred, the Void was threatened by the possibility that nothingness had no existence. The Void felt the desire to define nothingness! Once this process of separation began-a duality into self and other—a whole series of experiences was initiated in order to manifest existence. At this point—the Alpha—the Creator withdrew its name, for the opposite of definition is naming--unifying. Listen to me very carefully now for the scientists on Earth are trying to steal the creator’s name by calling the first laser for Star Wars, Alpha.
“Definition is the original confusion which has been reverberating down through time on this planet. The only thing that counteracts this process is naming the self by exploring one’s own creativity. Our link to the galaxy is through art, beauty and love, which frees us from materialism—the addiction to things we are conditioned to believe we need. Creativity, or moving into experience with the Creator, is more powerful than any force, even materialism. We only create if we trust the process and let go of control. There must be no judgement about results or about reasons for creating in the first place. Any judgement instantly catalyzes the numinous into form. If healers stop to ask why they heal, artists why they art, lovers why they love, then experience falls back into definition, which blocks God’s delight! Just by asking a question about existence, one is open to the negative path.”
We pick up the Creation story again with the time of Callia’s forced exile by Enjliou into the Void, for it was out here in the Void that She became lost for a long and lonely time surrounded as it were by complete and utter darkness. This was truly a terrifying time for the Creator Mother. Imagine how fearful utter Darkness can be for a Grand Being created solely of Light. If the LIGHT of the FATHER is LOVE, then Callia was not only alone and afraid while she was out there, but She was also without LOVE.
More of the Mother’s own Story of original Imprinting
“I have to tell this story using consciousness’ words, even though words can only convey an impression of what it was really like there. The advantage of this is not only that it makes it possible for there to be communication in this way, but also that it makes it possible for interpretations made from these ancient imprints to be given so that they can be noticed for what they are; interpretations of original imprints. Mind thought these interpretations were fact and did not question them in many cases.
“. . . I had only feelings moving Me without knowing they were moving me or even that I felt them. I did not know where I was, or if there were any other place to be other than this. I knew nothing, only emptiness; great emptiness, which impressed me with the feeling that the void was



34
large. My own lack of presence there and vague feeling of dislike blurred into hopelessness and a feeling of needing help. I must have gone blank again for a long time.
“Suddenly, I felt something there. It felt good. I did not know it could happen. I startled, but I was also overjoyed. Whatever this was apparently thought My startle meant I didn’t like it, because it moved away.
“It hated Me and had no sympathy for me. I knew that. I did not like it, either, and wished it would go away.
“It did leave, and I really felt abandoned then. I hadn’t liked it, but at least it had light, I now realized. I sank into an even deeper dark nothing.
“Nothing happened for a long time, until I finally saw or sensed the presence of light again. I awoke, as if startled awake from a long nightmare of grieving. I wanted to move toward the light. I was excited, expectant and hopeful. I yearned for it and tried to reach for it as much as I possibly could, hoping I would not frighten it this time. Propelled by fear and desire to try to have Him again, I somehow touched into this light. I was shocked and not received the way I had hoped I would be.
“. . . I laughed at Myself many times there when They made fun of Me. How They must have hated Me when I laughed as though I saw Myself as They saw me and did not know what They were really laughing about. As much as He pretended to love me and that all the anti-female jokes were only humor, the hatred showed when He had sex with Me. It was brutal, hard and mean, and then He left Me, pregnant. He did not care how I felt about it, and for so long I did not know I had the wrong him there. Rage was all he was, denied rage, in fact. When the split came and rage was denied, he never let me know it, and he never let me know that he was not all there was.”
Gnosticism tries to define these differences between Creation and the Void by drawing the boundary between the divine and the created orders in terms of their location in space. To a Gnostic, the darkness has not yet been dispelled, but eternally envelops the inferior realms of being, the layers of flesh and matter. The “moments” of creation do not represent points of transition from the “old” world to the “new,” but rather signify grades of spiritual perfectionislands in an ocean of darkness which is the Void. Theologically, these degrees of perfection are pictured as emanations as in varying degrees of light emanating from a source--the mysterious High God, the hierarchy of elements in the universe according to their distance from, and reflection of, that transcendent source of life. The principal emanations are what the ancient Gnostics called aeons (literally “ages” or “eternities”). These aeons are deified as entities in space, as the chief features of the great cosmic map for which events in time are only pale and illusory likenesses.
This interchanging of temporal categories into larger spatial metaphors is seen in the following passage from the hermetic literature:
“Of Aeons, Powers, Intelligences, Gods, Angels, Spirits delegate, Existing Non-existences, generated Ingenerables . . . years, Months, Days, Hours, --of [the] Boundless Point, from which the most minute begins to increase by parts.”
In her near-hopeless efforts to find Her way back to Creation, Callia was first able to find Her way to a temporary shelter here on Earth. And it was for eons of time that She was simply



35
abandoned here, ‘marooned’ if you will. She was here all alone, in great pain--so great a pain that She almost died, starved of the very essence of Her Being, the Light she needed to exist. She was in fact so weak that She could barely rise to lift Herself off the planet and make Her way home.
Can a spiritual essence die? No. But it can be so starved or drained of its natural Light as to where what should be a roaring flame of Light, is hardly more than a flicker, a spark, a pilot light, barely holding on to its existence.
To appreciate the division that caused this whole event, we must take a look at what was going on inside Enjliou right before this happened. Here, Enjliou explains His feelings leading up to the time when Callia was cast off from Himself and wandered into the Void. Again, this is from Ceanne DeRohan:
“. . . Her fear was relieved when I appeared not to notice her, but this did not satisfy Her because She had a desire to be accepted exactly as She was and loved.
“. . . I had no way of knowing, without having My Will go outside of Me, what it was like to be without light or love present. I had to push My Will outside of me and have her feel what it was like to be Lost Will in space.
“I had to push My Will outside of Me on a wave of hate; otherwise there would have been some light and love present to sustain Her, and She would not have had the experience We needed. I did not know how this would feel to Her, and when I did feel it, the feeling was so terrible, I had to disconnect from Her. She had to receive this denial in order to have the experience We needed, and in the passionate fury I had worked Myself into it order to hate Her, I thought I did not care what She had to experience.
“. . . I did not know that to Her, loving Her meant accepting her as She was and helping Her to go through Her fear first. I thought I had not had time for Her fear. I thought We would never move if Her fear were allowed to get the upper hand.
“She was already holding back out of fear anyway, so I finally got the impression from her that I needed to help Her with Her fear. How? Most of the time I felt like I didn’t have fear, only anger at Her for having fear. Whenever I allowed My anger, Her fear seemed to worsen.
“. . . I have guilt now that I had so little faith in Myself, but then I had all the feelings that humans have now about getting to have a mate and a relationship and no longer having to be alone. I had great desire not to make a mess of it anymore, and I gave this desire the place of uppermost importance with Myself. In advance of experiencing the Will in Her now emerged state, I judged everything I had thought to be a problem now. I judged all of that behaviour to be unloving and literally shoved it aside.
“When I had done this, I looked toward the Will in expectation of having Her love Me for it. I found beside Me a huge golden light that encircled Me in Her arms and I took this as a sign, although I later found it was not a sign, for the Will had no love of My denials. At that time, I had desire to overlook this and She did also because We had had such a long and difficult time achieving enough balance that the Will even could emerge. We wanted to go on now, and We feared that looking at any problems might put Us right back where we had been.”
Abusive relationships did not begin here on planet Earth, nor on any other planet for that matter. Instead, it is only an archetype handed down to us from the higher worlds, from Parents



36
who manifested us into this world, burdening us with their own Lost Will and in turn creating on this plane of existence –the most formidable, the most difficult, and also the most challenging learning experience of all.
Spirit and the Endless Void
There are two directions in Creation, one centrifugal, or out-flowing, the other centripetal or inward-flowing. Some religions call this ‘the Breath of God’, the exhaling and inhaling of Creation. The Light which the FATHER is, travels outward to the very corners of the created Universe carrying with it the manifestation of all that is, including the individual essences of Soul to be manifested in order to gain experience. This Light then returns to the FATHER bringing with it the harvest of those ‘individual atoms of God’ that have chosen, and have earned the right, to go on to a higher level of Creation.
The Council of Nine express this idea while referring to the rebuilding of the planet after a major disaster such as the Great Flood:
“It became necessary then to populate Planet Earth, so that the cells of the Creator could become individuals and free souls, in order for them to become one in unity and harmony by choice.”
Choice and Intent are everything in Creation.
This Breath of God travels in a spiral direction down through the various levels of Creation or Heaven until it reaches the very lowest rung of the ladder. It is from the very spiral nature of this energy that the word which describes it is formed—‘Spirit.’ As it manifests into the worlds of the physical plane it appears to be a vortex, and this is the name often applied to the portals of the planet through which the energy comes. These vortexes or portals create ‘windows’ into and out of the planet for the energy to continue circulating , much as a bedroom window allows the free circulation of air into a home. The chakra system of energy that supports the human body is a microcosm of this form, masculine energy flowing in a clockwise or downwardly ‘creative’ direction. Female energy travelling conversely in a counter-clockwise or upwardly ‘destructive’ direction.
Every living thing, the planet, the continents and even particular regions of the planet as well, all have their corresponding chakra system that allows for the ebb and flow of this Universal energy. The battle to control the access to these energy centers is also a key issue in the current battle raging for control of this planet, and indeed for the entire Universe.
As this neutral creative energy known as Spirit reaches the lowest levels or farthest outposts of Creation, it then reverses direction to begin its upward spiral back into the very heart of Creation Itself. This is the Light of the FATHER carried on the Sound Current also known as ‘the Audible Life Stream of God.’ It is the energy that supports all of Creation, a neutral force which can be used to create or manifest at any level of existence. Being a neutral force, it can be used for positive purposes or their antithesis. It is the key to understanding the Ancient Mysteries from which the New World Order sprang, and also the key to understanding the coming ascension of planet Earth back up the spiral of Creation into a higher dimension of Being.
Time exists as function of Space and of this movement of energy through the various spheres. All things however, have their allotted period of time, and this brings to us all the Great Cycles of Time talked about in so many religious texts. The end of the Mayan calendar is the end



37
of one such major cycle of Time. It is this Breath of God that supports all things and also brings all things to their ultimate and final conclusion through the various cycles of Creation.
The Hindu’s express this idea in the twin aspects of God known as Shiva, the procreative force which is also the destroyer as well. Shiva’s consort, coincidentally, is the mother goddess Uma, or Kali (so very similar to Her true name, Callia).
In many Eastern religions Creation is the positive or masculine aspect of God, and the Void into which things are created is the negative or feminine aspect. The creative aspect of Shiva is often represented by the lingam or male organ that fills the space of the yoni, or female sexual organ. This reflects the true nature of the feminine as that which opens or makes way for Creation to occur. It is NOT however, the feminine creative principle in and of itself.
As the Council of Nine put it:
“. . . the female power is rooted in knowingness, instinct-intuition, and in a deeply physical engagement with the life-process. The female (and the feminine side within men) does not need intellectual explanation to know what is right or proper. Feminine power is the power to work in tune with the rhythms of Nature (to work with the Creator instead of in competition with HIM). The feminine way is to utilize the available energy and channel it sensitively in the most appropriate manner and direction. The male way is to create new energy and shove it where he wants.”
Modern astrophysicists admit that to them there are a lot of things out there which they have no idea what they are made of, what fills space or the Void is one of them.
Fritjof Capra attempted to answer this enigma, and to bring together the science and religion in his book, The Tao of Physics. Hereto he grapples with explaining what both science and religion believe about the Void:
“The field theories of modern physics force us to abandon the classical distinction between material particles and the void. Einstein’s field theory of gravity and quantum field theory both show that particles cannot be separated from the space surrounding them. On the one hand, they determine the structure of that space, while on the other hand they cannot be regarded as isolated entities, but have to be seen as condensations of a continuous field which is present throughout space. . .
“The field exists always and everywhere; it can never be removed. It is the carrier of all material phenomena. It is the “void” out of which the proton creates the pi-mesons. Being and fading of particles are merely forms of motion of the field.
“The distinction between matter and empty space finally had to be abandoned when it became evident that virtual particles can come into being spontaneously out of the void, and vanish again into the void (dimensionality), without any nucleon or other strongly interacting particle being present.”
Capra then gives a diagram of such a process using the familiar coupling of male and female, positive and negative, as well as the third force which binds them together. He then continues:
“The vacuum is far from empty. On the contrary, it contains an unlimited number of particles which come into being and vanish without end.



38
“Here then, is the closest parallel to the Void of eastern mysticism in modern physics. Like the eastern Void, the “physical vacuum”—as it is called in field theory—is not a state of mere
nothingness, but contains the potentiality for all forms of the particle world. These forms, in turn, are not independent physical entities, but merely transient manifestations of the underlying Void. As the sutra says, “Form is emptiness, and emptiness is indeed form.”
“The relation between the virtual particles and the vacuum is an essentially dynamic relation; the vacuum is truly “a living Void”, pulsating in endless rhythms of creation and destruction. The discovery of the dynamic quality of the vacuum is seen by many physicists as one of the most important findings of modern physics. From its role as an empty container of the physical phenomena, the void has emerged as a dynamic quantity of utmost importance. The results of modern physics thus seems to confirm the words of the Chinese sage Chang Tsai:
“When one knows that the Great Void is full of ch’i, one realizes that there is no such thing as nothingness.”
In his series of books on the ancient continent of Mu, James Churchward relates the findings of the ancients on exactly this same topic:
“While it is not generally appreciated to be so, the fact remains that our atmosphere is very highly specialized. It is only during recent years, since the advent of radio, that the essence in which the popular atmosphere floats has been recognized as a playing a most important part in the earth’s welfare; and, further, it is not yet appreciated that the essence in which the atmosphere floats is an essence totally different to that which fills space. The essence in which the atmospheric particles float is under direct control of the central magnet, while that which fills space is in no way affected by the central magnet, as the magnet has no power over it whatever.
“. . . Our scientists assume that that which fills space, and that in which our popular atmosphere floats, is one and the same thing. It is not, as shown in the sacred inspired writings of the Motherland.
“The ancients called that in which our atmosphere floats “the essence” and that which fills space they called “the water.” In the ancient writings it is repeatedly pointed out that the light force is carried in the essence, and not in the particles of our popular atmosphere.
“In the ancient writings, the symbol for that which fills space was a series of fine horizontal lines which they wrote “water.” The earthly water symbol was a serpent in motion, like the swells of an ocean, generally written as a series of wavy horizontal lines.
“. . . I think the symbol answers the question. The translators of the sacred writings could find no name corresponding with the original, to give to the plain horizontal lines, but the horizontal wavy lines were well known to them, so they differentiated between the two by calling one the “water” and the other “the waters.” I have never found a word giving the name used by the ancients, only the symbol; but their writings distinctly tell us that it is that which fills space. Not once but dozens of times.
“In many of the vignettes of the sacred inspired writings is unquestionably shown what the fine straight horizontal lines symbolize. As an instance, when the Creator is spoken of as having existed in space, a vignette accompanying the writing shows the seven-headed serpent moving along through fine horizontal straight lines within a circle.”



39
For the Hindus, that energy or Spirit which fills all space is a vital force known as “prana.” They have five different manifestations depending on the space in which it exists and its purpose. Still, in essence, it is that same energy of the FATHER which supports all things in Creation.
As a person works through their first experience of the true Creation story, they might be inclined to wonder why this was ever allowed to continue. To understand that point one must first consider two of Creation’s primary characteristics: one is sometimes called ‘the prime directive’that each part of Creation must have its own Free Will. The second is the fact that the FATHER experiences HIS own Creation through that which has been created. Every new experience that no one has ever had before adds to the body of God’s experience, and to the body of knowledge of all that is created.
In Enjliou and Callia’s difficulties new expressions of Creation were being learned. It is the same here on Earth right now where so much new learning is taking place from experiences and ways of viewing certain experiences that have never been known before.
The Spiritual Hierarchy will not let Us destroy ourselves as some planets have been destroyed before during similar learning experiences such as this one, but we shall cover this in more detail as our journey draws to an end.
The fundamental belief about the universe in Gnosticism was that it contained the two cardinal spirits of Light and darkness. ‘Light” represented truth and righteousness, and ‘Darkness’ depicted perversion and evil. The balance of one against the other in the cosmos was settled by celestial movement, and people were individually apportioned with degrees of each spirit as defined by their planetary circumstances of birth. The cosmic battle between light and darkness was thus perpetuated within humankind and between one person and another; some contained proportionally more light, others proportionally more dark. By tradition, the Spirit of Darkness was identified with Belial, meaning ‘worthless,’ whose children worshipped other gods rather than Jehovah.
The Alexandrian Gnostics taught that the first father, Yaldaboath, equivalent to our Enjliou, was bought forth from the depths by the Holy Spirit, who was called Sophia, meaning ‘wisdom,’ the Gnostic equivalent of Callia. The Holy spirit of Sophia was said to have ‘moved on the face of the waters’.
The Continuation of Creation
Although ideally it takes the negative, female, Mother energy and the positive, male, Father energy of one of the other Creator Beings to create, it is possible for two ‘male’ or ‘female’ essences to also create or manifest beings here in the Universe as well. Lucifer and Enjliou were able to create together. ARTOLA and Callia were able to create together. Callia and Lucifer were able to create together, to bring forth manifestations of the Light. And each Being at this level was also able to create on Their own. These alternative methods of Creation, however, bring about problems with the individual spirits or Beings that have been manifested.
To correctly create or manifest a Soul in its full compliment or glory of the FATHER’S LIGHT takes a male and female energy, combined with the neutral force of the FATHER’s Holy Spirit. What Enjliou and Callia manifested together, for the most part, were full-complement Light Beings. What ARTOLA and Callia were able to manifest together, for the most part, were also full-complement LIGHT BEINGS. In both these situations, however, those who were manifested



40
were still imprinted with the negative aspects now also inherent in their Parent Creators. Again, “the sins of the father . . .”
What Lucifer created, on his own, and with Callia, were beings that had insufficient Light to be able to properly deal with the higher levels of existence. They were and still are, beings who are unable to make their way home to the FATHER on their own. They comprise many of the sick and the needy of the planet, those beings who are unable to lift themselves above the rudimentary levels of survival. Other beings created during the most intense period of chaos in the creation of this universe, are what is called ‘fragments’ or even ‘disembodied spirits.’ The are “souls” who are not able to be fully manifested in their right form or structure. Lucifer created some of these, Callia created some of these, and so too did Enjliou. It is not the fault of those who were created that they are lacking or somehow incomplete. Then again, it is not the responsibility of all the other individual expressions of soul to help them heal either. These Souls must eventually be returned to the FATHER for correcting the level of LIGHT in their being, unless the Creator Parents can once again be heal Themselves, and in turn heal Their children.
The original beings who were emitted in the first acts of Creation in the Universe came “like massive groups in space”—what the Gnostic would called ‘waves of emanation.’ In these original groups there were greater and lesser degrees of spirits, each with their own designations and tasks to perform. Some of these were of course the Great Arc Angels, the lesser Arc Angels, the rainbow spirits, and the Ronalokas. Ceanne DeRohan goes into much more depth on these further creations in her series of books, than we have time to do here.
Each one of these subsequent group of Spirits manifested, from Lucifer on down, was basically flawed by the dissension which split the creative powers of the Universal Parents sending them off on their own adventures and agendas. Here, once again, we have the archetype of divorce and the ‘traumatized’ child who is a product of such an unbalanced upbringing. If you now have the feeling that you are not just living your own life, but that also of your parents in one form or another, you will understand the effect this Creation had on all of us who were created.
And the drama continued.
During Her time of isolation out in the Void, Callia came close to extinction of Her personal Light more than once before She was finally able to lift herself off the planet and find her way back to Enjliou. From there, She was eventually retrieved by Beings from the Central Universe and taken back for a healing. And, finally, after much time a and recuperation from her near extinction, She and Enjliou were once again reunited, and the work of Creation continued.
Machiavellian theory teaches that the best way to win either a war is to ‘divide and conquer’ your opponent. In this way their forces are split, as well as the energies of their focus. That is exactly what Lucifer did with his Creator Parents. Pitting one Parent against the other, he deepened the rifts and divisions that already existed between them. Those who follow him also use exactly the same processes, as we shall see.
Lucifer’s ultimate goal, however, as mentioned in many religious texts that deal with the Luciferian rebellion, was to usurp the role of His Father. Not just to be like God, but to actually be God, God of His own Universe in Creation—this one, Nebadon.

Chapter 4 -- The Tree Grows Crookedly
Two souls, alas! Within my breast reside And each repels the other: One, in tenacious lust, the world holds in its embraces; The other sweeps the dust above into the higher ancestral places. Goethe
The mythology relating to a World Parent Creation is very common. The basis for it is called the Earth Mother-Sky Father motif.
In this type of myth, common to as diverse a group of races as the Fon, Polynesian, Zuni, Egyptian, Minyong, Yoruba, Yuma, and Greeks, among others, the universe evolves from a union of the opposite qualities of sky and earth, the heights of thought and the depths of matter. And, in this type of Creation myth, creative space between the world parents is usually madesometimes violently—by their own children.
Such mythology reflects the very Creation story we have just begun, once again suggesting that the story of Enjliou, Callia, ARTOLA and Lucifer, was at least partially well-known once upon a time. It also suggests that somewhere along the way this Creation story that should be a part of everyone’s heritage, has been buried, censored, or in some way edited out of our history books. Since it is a fixed rule of propaganda that to rob a people of their power, one needs only to take from them of their myths and their history, perhaps this could be the very reason.
Who would have the power and the influence over such a wide field of human experience that they would be able to do such a thing? Who could, and who would want to do such a thing?
The answer is simple. Lucifer.
The only problem is that so many people on the planet, and indeed on other planets as well, do not believe that an entity such as Lucifer exists. Should they be among the minority in believing in the Being of Lucifer, they rarely do acknowledge that he would have any power over them, their lives, or on any of the decisions they make on a day-to-day basis.
Many people use the word ‘Satan’ interchangeably with, or instead of, Lucifer to describe the Dark Force in the Universe. As Elaine Pagels, professor of religion and noted religious author, explains it, in Biblical sources the Hebrew term ‘Satan’ describes an adversarial role. In fact, the word ‘Satan’ actually meaning ‘the accuser.’ Along with references to other fallen angels or to demonic beings, Satan is virtually absent from the Hebrew Bible.
These two words seem to have become inextricably interwoven, however, when referring to the one being known more correctly as Lucifer, a Latin word paradoxically meaning, “lightbearer.” Other names for Him include Phosphorus (Greek ), Belial, Be’elzebub (one favored by the spiritual hierarchy), the Bringer of Light, or the Morning Star.
The most common history told of Lucifer is that as an angel of God, he got offended by developments in the heavenly realms, and one day struck out on his own. His story should not be confused, however, with the sons of God who mated with the daughters of men--those we shall come to later in our history.



42
As Pagels remarks, Satan, in the Bible, seems to be a figure who is close to God, as in the story of Job when God boasts to the Satan about one of his most loyal subjects:
“Have you considered my servant Job, that there is no one like him on earth, a blessed and upright man.
“In this story, the Lord himself even admits that the Satan had some influence over Him when it comes to the subsequent tests he lays at Job’s door.
As Satan/Lucifer became an increasingly important and personified figure in history, stories about his origin also proliferated. One of the stories related by Pagels tells how an angel, himself high in the heavenly hierarchy, proved insubordinate to his commander-in-chief and so was thrown out of heaven-- demoted, and disgraced, as it were, echoing an account in Isaiah of the fall of a great prince:
“How are you fallen from heaven, day star, son of the dawn! How are you fallen to earth, conqueror of the nations! You said in your heart, “I will ascend to heaven, above the stars of God; I will set my throne on high . . . I will ascend upon the high clouds . . . But you are brought down to darkness, to the depths of the pit.” (Isa. 14:12-15)
Pagels also mentions an apocryphal version of the life of Adam and Eve in which there is another such account of angelic rebellion.
“In the beginning, God, having created Adam, called the angels together to admire his work and ordered them to bow down to their younger human sibling. Michael obeyed, but Satan refused, saying,
“Why do you press me? I will not worship one who is younger than I am, and inferior. I am older than he is; he ought to worship me!” (Vita Adae et Evae 14:3)
In this case, the problem of evil in the Universe begins with sibling rivalry. This is partially true as we have begun to see in our Creation story, although obviously more of the blame as such belongs to the Creator Parents themselves. This sibling rivalry, however, is the basis for many archetypal stories, and is mirrored in such well-known Biblical stories as that of Cain and Abel, Joseph and his brothers, and also the prodigal son.
Pagels’ summation is that,
“. . . at first glance these stories of Satan seem to have little in common, yet they all agree on one thing: that this greatest and most dangerous of enemies did not originate, as one might expect, as an outsider, an alien, or a stranger. Satan is not the distant enemy but the intimate enemy—one’s trusted colleague, close associate, brother.
And that we already know is Lucifer.
The Council of Nine avoid using the term Lucifer at all, but do occasionally use the term ‘Satan.’ More usually they choose to use the term ‘the opposition,’ or the euphemism ‘The One Who Fell.’ Palden Jenkins reflects what we have already been finding out about Heaven in his commentary on the channelings of the Nine, that we here on Earth tend to think of Earth as complex, and the heavenly worlds as simple. Yet, the Universe is a complex place too, with all manner of different beings, of many different kinds and stature, and from vastly different persuasions and ways of seeing things in Creation.



43
“Primarily there are those who are variously aligned to the universal cause of the Creator and the overall purpose of Creation, then there are those who define their realities and purpose as best they can, according to their own experience and evolution – which might or might not, by varying degrees, be in line with universal purpose; and then there are those who have set themselves up to oppose universal evolution, to obstruct it, and to influence beings of the Universe to forget, lose, deny and go against their original purpose for being.”
This lays out fairly clearly the three types of being in the Universe: Those who are ‘with’ the FATHER; those who are working, as it were, ‘on the fence,’ doing the best they can with the understanding they have; and those who are in opposition to everything the FATHER and HIS Creation stand for. One could almost divide Mankind up into the very same three categories.
Although this may make the choices sound very simple, it is exceedingly more complex in reality. Mankind seems ever more than willing to accept the imaginary worlds and creatures in movies such as Star Wars; and television series such as Star Trek. Somehow, though, when it comes to seeing the reality of our own Universe, we get stuck with our blinders on, or jolted back into the deeply programmed patterns of thinking imposed upon us by the norms of our culture, our church, or our increasingly narrow educational system. Somewhere there is a trigger mechanism in us which makes us not want to see or admit to our own history and the origins of our kind. Perhaps this is due to a fear that there is something which will shock us out of our complacent little worlds, and that would make us have to act responsibly in the future. Perhaps it is a fear of seeing what it is we, ourselves, have actually created.
As we shall see in the following chapters, perhaps what we want to believe is that our society is indeed at the pinnacle of evolution, rather than being mere infants compared with cultures that have gone before us, and our neighbors and biological parents from planets in the not-to-distant Universe.
It is best that we get one thing straight right from the start of our journey, for much of this book will bring up the same subject again and again, as we trace the single most important
influence on human history—Lucifer. Make no mistake about it, there is a Lucifer. Also make no mistake about the fact that he is NOT playing some helpful role in God’s plan by provoking us to do what is against the FATHER’s Will. His stated purpose is to become God of his own Universe, and if not, then to destroy the Universe and as much of Creation as he can take with Him. To do this, He has actually incarnated upon this planet 7 times in the past 5,000 years—and yes, he is coming again.
If that is not clear then as the book proceeds forward with our history, we shall see the pivotal role these seven incarnations of Lucifer have had in shaping the direction of our history.
The Council of Nine take a great deal of time to explain just how ‘the opposition’ works. It will therefore be beneficial here to share some of their wisdom on the subject, keeping in mind that it is through those who have been manifested on all the various worlds in the Universe that either side of Light and Darkness must act. We, ourselves, individually and collectively, are the battleground on which this war has been fought, and will be fought in the very near future.
“There are those who propose to be like gods—those are the humans that draw in, and are influenced by, the ‘One Who Fell’, who was at one time in the realm of the gods, and is now fallen. The One Who Fell utilizes and feeds on those energies of neglect, of emotional distortion,



44
and the weaknesses of humankind, but also upon their strengths, when those strengths are not protected.
“The One Who Fell’ insinuates upon humankind information that is not correct. He has created a scheme, that humankind believes, that those of the darkness are in equality to the Creator. It is the hope of the Fallen One that if enough of humankind accept, then He Who Has Fallen will become the Great One . . . It is humankind, those that have the energy of destruction, that the Fallen One utilizes. They are not gods; they are fooled humans . . people do not understand their true self, and therefore give their power to the One Who is Fallen . . .”
Understanding the energies of all Creation, Lucifer knows how to best utilize those energies to make himself a god. He also knows all the tricks on how to keep people in bondage, to have control over others in a way that makes Him feel that he is a god. Not to confuse the issue, but remember, through all the trickery which is and has been used upon us, it is still usually we who so easily give away our power.
“Remember that your seventh dimensional body (the stellar body), representing the physical body of your inner being, is able to interface with the third dimension with clarity, power and enlightenment, depending upon the quality of the work you have done to this point. Realize also that the light of the 7D has always shone brightly from within you. Whether it is able to penetrate the dross of your lower dimensional bodies depends entirely upon the work you are doing now and the decisions you are making moment to moment in your heart. This is the way to avoid getting fooled.”
The Nine say that all parents should be able to relate a saga about a child who is unloving, even after it has been nurtured, fed, and had great love given to it . . . “a child whose parents only wished for it to “grow in beauty, straightness, flexibility, and love, giving as it has been given to, but it chooses not to do that,” until at last the realization comes upon them that they must let go of it in order for it to find itself, and for it not to wish to destroy others. This child is “not discarded, but it is also not fed and supported, for that which loves it, it attempts to destroy.”
Lucifer is on His own when it comes the supportive energy from the Universe. Since he has been cut off from the Source, to gain the Light he must have to exist, he must steal it from others such as those who serve him. This, more than any other source, is the origin of the legend of the vampire, “the blood-sucker,” the energy-stealer, the one who must destroy others so that he alone may survive. He is trapped in the lower dimensions of reality because he does not have enough ‘power’ or Light to maintain himself in the higher dimensions.
It is one way to recognize those who are under the influence of the opposition on this planet that they seem to “sap your energies” when around you. Recognize, too, that the rash of vampire movies over the past few years tells us more about the stage the Lucifer rebellion is at, than anything else in the media.
The Nine emphasize that ‘the opposition’ does not adhere to laws. This means they can lie, cheat, and even kill, to attain their final purpose. The workers for the True Light of the FATHER have, on the other hand, always followed what is known in Star Trek as ‘the Prime Directive’—the Law of Non-interference.
They are also quick to remind us that both sides have their angels:



45
“All that is not good in a physical body is used by the negative forces . . . (Therefore) the objective is to be positive-balanced, not positive-imbalanced. When you re-balance the positive and the negative, or when the physical body is tired or weakened, the negative forces may attempt to use your physical being, even if balanced, to create disharmony, to upset and unbalance. . . This is how they attempt to work through people who work with us: through illness, accident, or loss of energy. Even exposure to your electrical equipment can bring imbalance. Your world is full of desire, greed and unbalanced emotions, and it is not difficult for these beings to upset the balance and trap souls so that they reincarnate over and over. In the other worlds of the Universe, they attempt to do the same, but it is only on Planet Earth they are able to accomplish this, because of its density, and the desires of the humans.”
Everything in Creation seeks to be in balance. That is the Nature of the FATHER. It was from the imbalance set up between Enjliou and Callia that the whole of Creation took on an unbalanced state in this Universe. It was then propelled forward by this imbalance into ever darkening reaches of the Universe until it was no longer a Universe as such, a place of Oneness, but instead a universe of Duality. From the split between the Creator Parents came the Father of Manifestation—came Lucifer, came beings who were not created wholly in Light, but also in darkness. The worlds of duality as they are called, were brought into existence at that time, and the struggles of the universe and of its Creators has gone on from that moment into the eternity which is the nowness of time, in a state of duality. And it is the times of imbalance in our own beingness that Lucifer most uses against us
“You humans, within each of you, has all the ‘good’ and all the ‘evil’. Do you know what causes Satan? . . It is the temptations of the world. . .Satan is the unbalanced negative. . . The opposition is the opposite of life . . . Obstructing evolution on planet Earth affects everything else. . . Satan wishes not to bring it into balance, for if by bringing it into balance a soul becomes perfect and may live in freedom, Satan cannot live.”
Anything the Opposition can do to create imbalance in a person, in a family, in a state, in a country, in a world helps the Dark side to win. Fanaticism is one of the tools that they are using. As we have seen in the Middle East wars, in Bosnia and Serbia, as we have seen in the United States in the racially motivated killings and the school shootings, if fanaticism is not released, it becomes more violent. In each of these cases the participants were imbalanced in their beliefs, in their hatreds, in their ideas of racial purity, and ‘the opposition’ took advantage to create further imbalance, often times through the fear that the violence spawned in others.
“When those energies that you call negative upon your planet Earth attempt to destroy, attempt to control others, it is because they are in competition with God, the one Creator. For in their cells they know the divinity within them, and their personality holds forth, and they then attempt to be God . . . Then those who attempt to strangle and take over others are fed by the energies of what you call negative, as we are fed by love, and they then begin to strangle all. They go in competition with that that created it. . . . No one can compete with God, for they have not the truth within . . . They threw themselves out by going in competition and having the desire to become all that is. . . They are attempting to disrupt the work of the Universe.”
It is obviously to Enjliou and His decision to turn away from the Father that the Nine are referring to when they choose a place to lay their initial blame for this flaw in Creation:



46
“The universe was not set up to have an imbalanced opposition which fundamentally broke the norms and laws of the Universe. The imbalanced opposition arose because some being somewhere made an error -which is not so bad in itself, for errors do arise. The erring being then omitted to acknowledge what it had done: his was the major error.
Fortunately, they also offer suggestions as to how to deal with the presence of negativity in our lives, negativity that creates imbalance, to which the author has also added a couple of his own:
• Always look for the golden light. Those angels working for evolution always radiate a golden light.
• Accept the negativity within you, and permit it to be dispersed with this recognition; if you thereby come to know your fears, this can be useful negativity.
• The opposition work through the emotions—release your fears to your own higher power and let them be dissolved. If you can consciously connect your spiritual guides or angels, then you have an even greater power—coming into knowledge and truth does not make your path easier, for to be in service is also to pay dearly for that right to serve.
• Respect them if they create difficulty for you. With your mind see yourself from the ground to your head being swept with Divine love, Light, and the FATHER’s joy in you. Do not hesitate to ask for help. Because of the Law of Non-intervention, THEY cannot help you if you do not ask.
• Do not blame yourself when you have erred, but make a position to not repeat it. Always function from the center of your being, in integrity. What is important is to attain a state of being in which you cannot view yourself with dislike. Also it is important that honesty is functional.
• Do not take on anything or anyone you know you do not have the strength to pull away from.
• Forgive yourself. . . Each one of us needs to use our personal sovereignty to re-join the human race, from a background of decision and commitment. Love starts with ourselves. The way to start loving ourselves is to omit doing things which make us dislike ourselves.
• And always remember: There are those upon Planet Earth that were created by ‘the opposition’.
Ceanne De Rohan’s work also sheds some much needed Light on Lucifer’s role, the dissension He has brought to Creation, His effect on the Creator Parents during the early stages of the Creation of this Universe, and also the effects the fragmentation of the Parents had on the spirits that were created. This excerpt also gives us a glimpse into the original notion that when Lucifer ‘fell,’ he took one-third the host of heaven with him. Remember that DeRohan treats the Father of Manifestation and Lucifer as separate entities, although the spiritual hierarchy say this isn’t so. ARTOLA is here given the name of Heart. The italics are this author’s.
“The Great Arc Angels were next. They had Lucifer in their midst claiming he was one of them. The Great Arc Angels seemed to have grown in light and power since they emerged. I saw then that the Great Arc Angels belonged to Heart. They loved Him and had taken Him in and learned from Him. Light poured forth from them and love was in their hearts. Heart was proud of them.



47
“The Great Arc Angels had one great problem: They did not feel that Lucifer was one of them. Lucifer never agreed with them, and yet, he would not admit that he was different from them.
“He gives us trouble no matter what we try to do with him,” The Arc Angels said. “He has even told us that he is really God,” they added.
“. . . If they cannot understand that Heart is love and Lucifer is not, they will have to learn by seeing what happens to them if they follow Lucifer.”
“The Mother looked to the Father of Manifestation to see how He felt. The Father of Manifestation had felt Lucifer here, and now indicated that Lucifer was not a Great Arc Angel but was one of “them.” The Father of Manifestation had begun referring to the spirits that did not feel good to Him as “them.”
“The lesser Arc Angels asked Us some questions that Heart had not answered for them. They wanted to know if Form was important or not. I told them they had to see what form a thing took to know what it was. I was wrong, and this needs to move now. I did not realize that I was trying to give form more importance in the balance of things than it really has, because I was afraid Lucifer had spoken My secret feelings toward form. Giving form was only one of the powers of the Father of Manifestation, and even He did not feel that form needed to have that much importance given to it. He felt that I was patronizing Him, and yet, He wanted My acceptance and He wanted harmony between Us, so He did not contradict Me.
“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” has been fulfilled more often in form than it has in essence. . . how often when you have a desire to have something, do you give it to someone else as a gift rather than giving the other person what they would really like to have? . . Form and essence have to align for love to manifest. If you deny one, the other cannot evolve.
“The Lesser Arc Angels also need to know that it was their own Lost Will that they did not want hanging around then. . . Deep conditioning needs repeated emotional release on the same issues.”
De Rohan then goes on to channel Enjliou’s feelings about the attempt by Lucifer to usurp His role as Creator. Once again, the italics are mine:
Lucifer Tries to take My Place
“The Red Spirits received their vibration here and took it to mean that the Godhead had priority over their problems. The Red Spirits presented a response of denial that seemed to say they had had enough of Me and that they had no real problems anyway. I had wanted to avoid the problems in red, and yet, guilt had made Me hesitant to turn My attention away from the Red Spirits. They felt that I did not really want to be there and this made them uncomfortable in My presence. They covered their feelings with defensiveness and I covered mine by manifesting an excuse to make an apologetic departure.
“The Angels let Me know that Lucifer was making them feel very pressured to give Him my place. When I got home, Lucifer was suddenly and emphatically demanding My attention. He addressed Me very gruffly, stating that he had not gotten much attention from anyone for a long time. He felt defensive and said that he was the most wrongly judged against and denied spirit. He was very angry and his approach was very pushy and rude. He demanded to know what his right place was if it was not as head of the Arc Angels.



48
“. . . I had a fleeting moment of desperation in which I hoped for help from Heart or the Father of Manifestation. I felt angry at Them for not being present when I needed Them, but I also felt turning to Them for help might make Me look weak. Lucifer’s merciless stare made me feel like a fool and I began to fidget uncomfortably in front of him. Lucifer really felt superior then and I was hating My position. I tried to give Lucifer a look of knowing, but it was not real.
“. . . I wanted help now, anyone’s help. I was feeling overwhelmed, powerless and frightened, but I knew that I had to get Lucifer off of Me. I could not stand the vibration of Lucifer’s laughter, and yet, I could not move to push him away from me. I hesitated to think that I might not survive what was happening to Me, but it seemed possible that Lucifer had the power to annihilate Me with sound.”
The Gnostic Christian scriptures deal with this influence of Lucifer upon the other spirits in Creation, but in a much milder fashion, referring to Him as ‘the counterfeit spirit’ as in this Gnostic text appropriately titled ‘The counterfeit spirit’:
“But for my part I said, Sir, then where will the souls of these others, who have not known to whom they belong, reside?
“And it said to me, In the case of those others, the counterfeit spirit has increased within them while they were going astray. And it weighs down the soul and beguiles it into the works of wickedness, and casts it into forgetfulness (or deep sleep). And after it has come forth it is given into the charge of the authorities, who exist because of the ruler. And they bind it with bonds and cast it into the prison. And they go around with it until it awakens out of forgetfulness and takes acquaintance unto itself. And in this way, when it becomes perfect it attains salvation.
“But for my part I said, Sir, how is it that the soul becomes thinner and thinner, returning then to the nature of its mother or to the human being?
“Then it was happy when I asked this, and said to me, You are truly blessed, for you have understood! That soul will be made to follow the guidance of another in which the spirit of life resides, and by that other it attains salvation, and so is not cast into the flesh again.”
Here is where the microcosm and the macrocosm meet – in the concentric circles which surround each and every one of us with our own spiritual planes, and the one which surrounds the plane with its own “spirit-realms” – or levels of heaven, as referred to in the Kaballah.
Perhaps the most eye-opening account of an encounter with Lucifer is related by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, from what they call “one of the most disturbing texts in the whole of French literature,” Le Horla by the famous French author, Guy deMaupassant. Their account tells how Maupassant “in an access of terror, and madness, in blood and sweat wrote in precipitate haste” about the figure which appeared and could only have been Lucifer:
“Now I know, I can guess the truth. Man’s dominion is a thing of the past! He has come, the being who was an object of fear to primitive races, whom anxious priests tried to exorcise, whom sorcerers called up at midnight without ever yet seeing him in visible form, to whom the temporary lords of creation attributed in imagination the shape monstrous or attractive, of gnomes, spirits, fairies or goblins. After the vulgar ideas inspired by prehistoric fears, scientific research has clarified the outlines of Man’s presentiment. Mesmer guessed it, and in the last ten years doctors have discovered the exact nature of this beings’ power before its manifestation. They have experimented with this weapon of the new lord of the world, the imposition of a dominant will on



49
the human soul, which thus becomes its slave. To this power they have given the name of magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion, and what not. I have seen them playing with it like silly children playing with fire. Woe to us! Woe to mankind! He has come . . . what is his name? . . . yes, he is shouting it and I can’t hear .. . say it again! Le Horla, I’ve got it at last . . . Le Horla . . . that’s his name . . . Le Horla has come!”
To be successful in His plan to take over the Universe and gain for Himself the position of supreme God, Lucifer needed the energy of the MOTHER. The lesser hierarchy that had already been created tried to warn Enjliou, as we have seen in the earlier quote from De Rohan, that Lucifer was ‘taking him for a ride.’ That he was, in fact, trying to steal his throne, to become God, but Enjliou took no action against Lucifer. Lucifer used the MOTHER because he could steal the woman’s power of creating space for his own purposes. He did not want the Mother, he just wanted Her energy to help him usurp the role of Enjliou as God of this Universe. This set up an archetype for every son who has ever wanted to supplant His father’s role, whether it be within the family, within the heart of the mother as in the archetypal Oedipus complex, or simply in his own eyes and mind. It also set up the archetype for the powerful ruling family plotting against each other that later became so apparent in the time of the Caesars and the heyday of the English and European royal families and still intrigues us today through Shakespeare’s plays..
DeRohan addresses this subterfuge allegorically in Original Cause--Volume II:
“The Father of Manifestation awoke first and took the Mother swimming with Him. They ran laughing out of the forest onto the sandy beaches, dancing in sunlight, running in shallow shimmering waters, rejoicing in the sunrise and diving into depths of green and turquoise. Their arms stirred the waters into waves, the movement of Their legs gave it currents and Their exuberance gave the water foam and bubbles.
The Mother’s reaction to Enjliou, however, was different and the archetypal tension that existed between them is evident in this excerpt from De Rohan’s work:
“The Mother felt Me bend to lift Her up and She grabbed My feet because she did not want to face Me. This made Me feel rather foolish. I responded by ordering Her to stand up, but She refused. I took a hold of Her upper arms then and forced Her to rise. This was a slow and painful process because it seemed as though She pitted Her Will against Me. I wasn’t about to let go and let Her think the power of Her resistance was stronger than the power of My light.
Lucifer wanted to be in charge, but still had a very powerful foe in Enjliou to contend with. In a number of different versions of the story we get the idea of Lucifer’s thoughts toward Enjliou: I’m better than you are. You’re not cut out to be God, but I am. And just as is occurring on planet
Earth at the present time, Lucifer pretty much had everyone fooled. It is very appropriate then that one of his common designations is as ‘the Father of Lies.’ Or at least he had a lot of people fooled. There were many though who weren’t, especially those envoys sent out from the Central Universal and from other Super Universes to try and help with what was going on here in this branch of Creation. If humanity causes its own extinction, then billions of souls are trapped within the Earth spheres for millions upon millions of years, and all of Creation is slowed to almost a standstill while these individual expressions of Soul are allowed to heal and repair.
These envoys would come to visit but, like the counselors They were, could only tell Enjliou and Callia how bad They thought things were going because of the introduction here of what was



50
a vastly different type of Negative Energy—the duality of Light and Dark. Meanwhile, Enjliou and Callia continued on with their troubles:
“To Me, the Mother was under currently acting like a mad woman who could not bond with what had come forth from her and who might even harm these spirits, so jealous was She of how I adored them and had gathered them into My arms instead of her.
“I scoffed at her and told Her She knew very little about me if She could not tell the difference between me and the Father of Manifestation. When She said She often wasn’t sure whether I had taken on form of the Father of Manifestation had given up His form to be as My Light, I felt She couldn’t love Me if She didn’t know Me any better than that.
“And the fighting got worse, until eventually it tore the heart of Creation apart:
“This terrible ripping and shredding left everyone in pain and in pieces. No one remained whole. You all suffered pain that was too much for you, and you all struggled in an attempt to regain some way to live in the presence of the dark and gaping hole that remained when Our relationship was blown apart. Everything came apart and everyone used the pieces they found to piece together their own point of view. The rest was lost; and lost so long ago that almost none of you remembers, or believes you want to know that these terrible things really happened, or that you have to let yourselves know you still have pain about it that you need to feel to heal.”
Does any of this make Enjliou less of a grand and wonderful Creator? Did Enjliou, and even Callia for that matter, not do anything that we ourselves might not have done? How do we judge the perfection of a spirit in a role such as this one? Enjliou’s side of the story:
“This put Me out there even further. I thought She was playing games with Me, and My rage had many ideas of why She was doing this. Obviously She didn’t care about Me or how I felt and was only interested in Herself and how good and right She always had to be. No matter what I told Her about Herself, She always told Me that I was doing the same thing. When I told Her maybe I was, She still would say She was not going to admit to doing any of the things I was accusing her of doing unless I was ready to admit to all of the same things.”
And from Callia’s point of view:
“The longer this went on without God indicating He appreciated or even noticed it, the more difficult it was for Me to feel like granting Him this space for uninterrupted internalizing. I didn’t like the way he granted this to Himself without concern for My needs. I felt I was the One often making the space for this to be possible and I was experiencing a huge build-up of pressure within Myself that had no outlet. There was no other place I could go with things I needed to give God. More and More, I felt I was holding the lid on things that were impossible for Me to handle by Myself. I was feeling very confused and frightened and the things I was trying to hold were leaking out of me like festering sores and diseases.
“I had many pressures of My own from the outside, and when the pressure from within built to the point of not being able to control it, I would have to risk involving your Father, no matter what fear this put me into, because continuing to hold these things back had become unbearable torture for Me. I suffered from restlessness, agitation, turmoil, sleeplessness, exhaustion and anguish to the point of breakdown.
“The night of this particular fight was the culmination of many sleepless nights of falling into bed so exhausted from the caretaking of so many spirits who gave Me not even gratitude for My



51
efforts, that I was almost too tired to sleep. Something was roaring within Me that would give Me no peace, and when this finally quieted down and I thought I might be able to drift off into sleep, it was then that I would be haunted by the plaintive cries of the “lost ones.” I was tormented by their tortured cries, and by the feeling of terrified powerlessness I had about not being able to move toward them without God’s help. I did not know why, but I felt I must have God’s help for them. I could not stand the idea of “going out there” to them without His help. I seemed not to have the power to draw them in either, and I felt it was because God didn’t have acceptance for this.
“The longer I lay there in this exhausted turmoil, the more My fear and grief began to turn into blame and rage until finally, I was so cranked up into blame for God that I no longer cared what His response was going to be to being intruded upon, I was going to do it. I wanted to start roaring and screaming at Him and wake Him up that way, but I was way too frightened and so I took the apologetic, gentle approach of begging His forgiveness for disturbing Him in His sleep, as though he were King and there were beggars at His door in the midst of a terrible storm who could not be let in without His permission.”
Fragmentation
And at this point the Mother literally shattered when She finally found She could take no more. It was an implosion that fragmented both her and all of Her Creations. And eventually Enjliou shattered, in doing so, fragmenting Himself and all of His Creations as well.
From this shattering or splitting of the Creator Parent energies came a higher and lower energy form of Both—the worlds of duality. Enjliou split into two, the higher energy as Enjliou, and the lowered energy being Angelu. With Callia, the higher energy form remained Callia, while the lowered energy became Alizca (pronounced A-leesh-a). Both these lowered energies of the Creator parents of Nebadon still exist at the current time—separate and unhealed.
As we step back for a moment into our continuing story of the Creation and the characters of Heart/ARTOLA, the father of Manifestation/Lucifer and Enjliou/the FATHER and Callia/the Mother, we find that the Mother is still lost in the Void before having found her way home, and Enjliou is still trying to sort out the trouble He is having and watching Creation fall apart under the influence of Lucifer:
Heart tries to Warn me that he cannot Stay manifest
“The father of Manifestation did not know whether to take this as any sort of declaration of love for the Mother on My part or not, but He did allow Himself to notice that My Light looked better to Him at the thought of finding the Mother than it looked to Him for a long time. This caused Him to decide that when he felt He had the opportunity, He would go in search of the Mother. None of us knew then what a long time it would be before He found Her.
“Heart, meanwhile, tried to let Me know more about the problems he was having holding Creation together, and I had to take Him seriously here, but I also had to let Him know that there was nothing I really felt I could do. I realized then that I had not allowed Myself to give My rage to the Father of Manifestation for having manifested the Creation all wrong. I seemed to feel like giving Him these things when He was not around and then find that I had gone blank in those areas when He was around. Heart did not like the blankness He was getting from Me either, but with all the held emotion, I could do no better.
The Missing Heart presence



52
“For a long time, I did not want to look back, go back or even remember anything about these original experiences. It was much too painful and long buried under the belief that it was never possible, necessary, or even advisable to do this. The veneer of civilization was busily being polished, and it seemed advisable, and in the best interests of all concerned, to let bygones be bygones, let old memories lie sleeping and buried and to stir no cauldrons of unknown outcome.
“. . . Suddenly we had a split, and it was with Spirit too, although I did not realize it then. Our split was over sexuality. I wanted to go ahead, and They did not. I was very binary at that stage of my development. Either They were with me and wanted to do what I wanted to do, or They were not. I moved past Them without even realizing I had done it. I felt that I must pursue these feelings, and They did not want to make a shift in Our reality. I was ready to make a shift suddenly, and They were not.”
Beings on this planet who were created with an almost full complement of Light by the Creator Parents are able to ‘hook in’ to either the higher or lower forms of Their parents’ energyCallia or to Alizca, or Enjliou or Angelu. When they are attuned to a higher vibration it is the higher form of the Creator Parents to whom they are connected. When they are attuned to a lower vibration, it is to the lower energy forms of the Creator Parents that they are connected. The essential growth for these beings in the end will be to embrace both the higher and the lower energies, and to overcome the duality and fragmentation within themselves.
A man or a woman can also assist their own children, much as Randolph Winter’s describes in his book The Pleiadean Mission, how those in the Pleiadean system do before or upon the birth of a child. This can be extrapolated to any child we have had, or conversely back to our own parents in an effort to heal those rifts which have occurred between us, and by doing so, help our own Creator Parents to heal. “During the following months of pregnancy, the mother will attempt to make spiritual contact with the incoming person to become better acquainted, so she will have a better understanding of how to help out this person with their new life. The Pleiadeans are able to understand, for instance, the path of learning that the individual is on. They can look into the previous lifetime and see if there are emotional instabilities of any kind that need to be dealt with, or if there were events during that life that left trauma or mental illness that should be addressed. They can tell if the spirit-form is happy and well-balanced, or plagued with hostilities and anger and what may have caused it. During the pregnancy, the mother will be able to learn much about the person coming in so that she may have a clearer understanding of how to assist them in their new life.” The effect of this fragmentation on those who were created was enormous. The imprint is still in their basic energy makeup. In themselves, in their hearts, they still carry the feeling of this fragmentation, and of the feeling of being incomplete or of indeed, not having enough Light to do what they need to do:
“Love evolving had a problem accepting the Will at first, but there is another problem which has caused major fragmentation, and that is the Will essence that is not vibrating because the light that came to it did not bond with it, but penetrated it instead and is not loving light. This light you need to let go of and let My Light come in its place. This light has caused much fragmentation because hatred cannot accept itself, and because this light is fundamentally against Form. Therefore, no matter what you do, as far as this light is concerned, it is going to be wrong. . . These are feelings that never move in most people. There is no acceptance for these feelings,



53
and thus, even the joyful response of finding love in another is diminished because it is taking place in the shadow of the unexpressed and unaccepted feelings. Forever. The unexpressed feelings have been blamed for the diminishment of the joy without it ever being seen what role has been played by the repression of these feelings.
“Husbands here lead lives that do not include the feelings of their wives. They are both internalized and outward going and do not even notice the gap in themselves where most of their wives’ unfulfilled desire blossomed and died without ever experiencing response from another.
“In this gap, flowers blossom and fall from trees without ever being noticed. All of nature has an empty sadness in it where Heart was never formed.”
Having been created without enough Light by “dysfunctional parents” resulted in the inability of many of the souls manifested in this part of the Universe to live up to their original purpose. Darkness and negativity began to run rampant. This is not to say that all those created were incapable of growing in awareness and in Love. Certainly Lucifer knew of their weaknesses and knew how to exploit them. Many were blinded to the real purpose in Creation which was to grow in experience as an integral part of the FATHER; to learn to give and receive unconditional Love as does the FATHER, and to grow in the Light. The area of the universe which was the weakest link in the chain , the lowest in vibration, was that which contained Planet Earth. More than any other place, it had the greatest acts of Darkness, of cruelty, and of sheer inhumanity.
For this reason, an energy barrier was put up across space to cordon off this area of the
Universe. This happened as short a time back as 50,000 BC, a time when, we shall see, that the Darkness began to spread more rapidly throughout the Universe. Like a cancer, it was feared that this ultimate Darkness would spread to other corners of the Universe, and eventually into all the other areas of Creation as well.
Planet Earth has now become a focal point for all of Creation because of what is seen to be the ultimate test of the Forces of Light against the Darkness. Filled with the greatest potential for evolution, and for the enhancement of its Light, ripe with great acts of heroism, and with great acts of love and self-sacrifice, Earth is seen as a major battleground—the key to stemming the tide of the Dark Side into Creation. This was the planet most essential to the whole structure of the Universe, a pivot point or fulcrum for the balancing the physical and spiritual natures of Man. Souls everywhere clamor for the opportunity to come to Earth to get a chance at the rapid growth in awareness that it provides, to garner experiences not found on any other planet in Creation. If only they could be given a fair chance without endangering the rest of Creation, this planet would be a perfect test.
But how to allow the Earth experiment, for that is what it was—an experiment, to have a chance to continue without allowing the Dark cancer to spread out across the Universe?
Thus it was that a decision was made at the Highest levels of the Central Universe that this portion of Nebadon should be quarantined, with limited access in, and definitely with limited access out. As much of the Universe needed to be saved as possible. It is not just a simple thing to pack up Creation and start all over again. The structure of a single Universe is an intricate interrelation of all Its parts as we shall see. To use a metaphor common to many spiritual paths, to perform a single act in the Body of God is to send out a ripple effect that will eventually touch all of that same Body. It is the same with a human body. If a body develops cancer, to stop it from spreading, that cancer must be neutralized or cauterized in order to erase it. This action has



54
severe effects on the overall equilibrium of every aspect of that entire human body. And, as it is above, so it is below. As it is with one human body, so it goes with the universe.
If Earth and this portion of the Universe could be saved, if enough beings could be brought back into the Light and healed by the ongoing efforts of the Spiritual Hierarchy and their legions of Lightworkers, then the experiment could continue. If not, the experiment would have to be terminated, and the individual expressions of Soul who had been manifested here would have to be taken elsewhere to be healed and given the opportunity to continue there growth and their learning.
So the decision was made to set up a barrier, a partition, that would allow only limited access to the cancerous area of the Universe, but no exit at all to its growing negativity. Scientists have actually detected this barrier in the outer reaches of space but cannot determine what its true purpose is. This is the veil put there to save Creation from the darkness which threatens to engulf It.
In setting up the partition, however, a gauntlet was laid down, a challenge as to which was going to rule this area of the Universe, the True Light of the FATHER, or the Darkness and negativity of the counterfeit spirit known as Lucifer. The final scene was going to have to be played out here and now. Earth more than any other area would indeed be the final testing ground for the triumph or demise of the Light over the Darkness. Each individual expression of Soul would become its own battleground as well. Each decision made by a Being living here would either go to feed the Light, or go to feed the Darkness.
Looking at it in the light of this new information, all of a sudden Gene Roddenberry’s Earth: Final Conflict takes on new significance and meaning. In fact, many movies and TV series would now appear to have been ‘channeled’ to their creators for exactly the purpose of trying to awaken the people to what is actually going on around them. We shall cover a couple of these in more detail as we progress.
The greatest problem encountered was that no one had quite realized how strong the conditioning of humans has been from lifetime to lifetime, and how strong was the pull of the physical that has Soul trapped in its density.
The current status of this struggle will be saved for now until we have covered a few more issues necessary to the understanding of how the Darkness has managed to gain such a strong foothold over the planet during the course of its history. Once we have done that, perhaps the reader will be able to proceed with a greater belief in the dire implications of the changes taking place on the planet right now, and still to come.
The Universe As has been said before, Nebadon is a super Universe in which there are also untold smaller universes, galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and SO ON. It is created with both Light and Sound, based on fixed mathematical constants—a fact which will become exceedingly important as we progress on our venture through history.
All matter radiates this Light to certain degrees. This is what can be seen as an aura by psychically attuned people, or by Kirlian photography which captures this light as an energy around the body. There are also now computers in use that can detect and track the changing images of a person’s aura onto the computer screen.



55
Some scientists are already beginning to suspect that if you take Light and lower or slow its vibratory frequency, it will become, in effect, gross matter. If you slow the movement of the particles of Light down far enough, in effect condensing them, you create what is called electrum—an electromagnetic field that has positive and negative poles, electricity. If you slow and condense that still further, beyond the electromagnetic fields, the electrum will coagulate into gross matter. Gross matter then coagulates into the molecular and cellular structures called form. Those individual forms are held together by the thought that the creator originally envisioned as an ideal of for that energy, a thought form. Conversely, when we contemplate using our thought processes and then embrace that thought with our emotional energy, that thought will expand into a vibratory frequency of Light. This is the creative process.
Ramtha says that all things are created by taking that which has no speed—thought—and expanding it into that which does—light—and then slowing the light down until we can create this and that, and all that is around us.
Now this is what makes people different—the priest different from the common man, the master different from the people, the dedicated people different, or the illumined man different. They have that visionary glimpse of the universal “I,” the imaginative insight into something nobody else has. They know how to create their own worlds using this visionary principle of focussing their energies and manifesting their thought forms into their lives. Paul Twitchell writes that you can always tell this ability in them from certain signs: 1) the way they carry themselves, the poise which is not physical or mental at all but a certain something which is different from other people; 2) their eyes have a glitter or gleam which no others have; 3) they speak differently, not usually of themselves but of other things; 4) their goals are far different from anything we are accustomed to; and 5) they do not speak of Christ, the Redeemer, but of themselves as the selfredeemer.
Scientists have also discovered that there is a background Sound to the Universe, an eternal hum which, when they filter out all the known sounds of the universe coming toward the Earth, is still ever-present, and which fills the void of space. This is the sound of the Breath of God spoken of in an earlier chapter. Creation is made both of Light and of Sound.
At the entranceway to this Super Universe created of both Light and of Sound, is a sea of unmanifested individual expressions of Soul waiting to be manifested by the Creator Parents into their respective regions to begin their own individual journey into consciousness. Soul itself is a unit of awareness, and the ultimate nature of Soul is to experience in every level of Creation, and by doing so give the FATHER experience of HIS own Creation through us.
“. . . the journey we take through time and place during an incarnation in a human body is our only way to know God, because God knows his/herself in us as we journey. And so, ultimately, in the embrace of a loved one, in our feelings when we lose our mother, in our knowledge of ourselves when we experience death and birth, that is where God is.” (Clow)
This sea of souls is sometimes referred to as the cosmic sea, the Sea of Soul, or the Ocean of Love and Mercy. The collective or group consciousness of this sea of souls is referred to in one religion, Eckankar, as the Sugmad. The Nine express it this way:
“God is all-knowing and all-seeing but there are parts of God, as there are parts to every atom. . . The whole together makes one, but not all parts experience the same.”



56
In compiling this history, it is from the holy book of Eckankar entitled the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad or Way of the Eternal that we have chosen to draw an explanation of the levels or planes of existence within this Super Universe:
“The SUGMAD slept in ITS abode in the Ocean of Love and Mercy, but IT was not pleased with what IT had created. So IT dreamed more to understand what IT had formed in these planes.
“Again IT awoke and looked out over the vast firmaments, wondering what belonged in them. IT dreamed again and sent ITS voice rolling through these vast worlds upon worlds. ITS voice became the heavenly music and spoke the WORD which rolled through all the magnificent planes. The Word of the SUGMAD became the ECK, the Spirit of all existence. Out of this came the lords, rulers, Souls, and all beings which the SUGMAD had dreamed.
“And out of this also came ITS son, the Mahanta, the consciousness of all heavenly bliss. There were then the SUGMAD, the ECK, and the Mahanta, all of which were the one great Reality.
“The Lord spoke unto the Mahanta and said, “I have created the worlds of bliss and happiness. Yet there is spiritual immaturity in all my creatures. Therefore, I must create the lower order of worlds, the planes of matter, space, energy, and time. The worlds where there is shadow, light, and embodiments.
“The SUGMAD stretched ITS hands over all the firmaments an created the worlds of the Triloki, which consists of the four regions between the negative pole of creation and the Atma Lok.
“Within these regions IT placed the elements of matter, energy, space, and time. Here the SUGMAD created the law that nothing could exist except in relation to its opposite, called the law of polarity. Without time there could be no space, without mountains there could be no valleys. Without shadows there could be no light, and without evil there could be no good. Nor could there be ignorance without wisdom, or age without youth.
“But the SUGMAD was not yet pleased with what IT had created, so closing ITS eyes IT dreamed again. This time IT formed the spiritual hierarchy of all the universes.
“The Hierarchy began with the SUGMAD, followed by the ECK, and the Mahanta. After this came the Living ECK Master, the Adepts of the Order of the Vairagi, the lords of each plane within the higher worlds, the guardians of the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad, and then the lower worlds were formed for those entities named the Atma, or Soul.
“Over these worlds, which are three in number, it placed Kal Niranjan, the lord of all the negative worlds. With this, It formed the Kal force, which originated and flows out of the Niranjan as its source. Subordinate to the ECK, the Kal, however, takes precedence over all life in the lower worlds. But it is still subject to the will of the SUGMAD.
“The SUGMAD was not pleased with what had been done in ITS lower worlds so IT slept again and dreamed. Out of this dream came the lords of the lower worlds. Next the Lords of Karma were formed, the devas (angels), the planetary spirits, bruts, elementals, man, and all the creatures subordinate to him—the fish, the animals, reptiles, plants, and stones.
“All these were formed on the many planes of the lower worlds; the stars, planets and the material worlds of matter, energy, space, and time. Then the SUGMAD slept again and dreamed



57
that all ITS manifestations needed life, so the ECK was sent into all the universes and worlds to create activity.
“With this the SUGMAD gave all the worlds ITS highest creation, the Atma. The Atma, or Soul, had to be perfected so It was sent into the worlds below, only to return to Its true home when perfect.
“. . . He placed these magnificent Adepts in charge of the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad, the Holy Book of the ECK Order. They are the guardians of these works, and upon each plane an Adept of the Order of the Vairag is in charge of a section of this Book of Golden Wisdom. A section of the book is within the temples of Golden Wisdom on each plane as designated by the SUGMAD.
“The planes and guardians are:
• The Ocean of Love and Mercy – the SUGMAD.
• The Anami Lok – the Padama Samba is the guardian of this section of the Shariyat-KiSugmad. It is kept in the Temple of Golden Wisdom known as the Sata Visic Palace.
• The Agam Lok – the Adept here is the Mahaya Guru, guardian of the Holy Book at the Kazi Dawtz temple of Golden Wisdom.
• The Hukikat Lok –The Adept here is the Asanga Kaya, the guardian of the Holy Book at the Jartz Chong Temple of Wisdom.
• The Alaya Lok–the Adept here is the great Tsong Sikhsa, guardian of the Holy Book at Anakamudi Temple of Golden Wisdom.
• The Alakh Lok—the Adept here is the Sokagampo, guardian of the Holy Book at the Tamanata Kop temple of Golden Wisdom.
• The Atma Lok—the Adept here is Jagat Giri, guardian of the Holy Book at the Param Akshar temple of Golden Wisdom. This is the house of imperishable knowledge. It is the highest that soul can go, as long as It is attached to a physical body, to study at any of the Temples of Golden Wisdom.
In the worlds below the Atma plane (where the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad is kept for those who are able to study its golden pages) are • The Saguna Lok (etheric world). The Adept here is Lai Tsi, guardian of the Holy Book at the Dayaka Temple of Golden Wisdom in the city of Arhirit. • The Par Brahm Lok (Mental world)—the Adept here is the Koji Chanda, guardian of the Holy Book at the Namayatan Temple of Golden Wisdom in the city of Mer Kailash. • The Brahmanda Lok (Causal world)—the Adept here is Shamus-I-Tabriz, guardian of the Holy Book at the Sakapori Temple of Golden Wisdom in the city of Honu. • The Anda Lok (Astral world) – the Adept here is Gopal Das, guardian of the Holy Book of the Askleposis Temple of Golden Wisdom in the city of Sahasra-Dal-Kanwal. • The Pinda Lok (Physical world) –the Adept here is Rami Nuri, guardian of the Holy Book at the Moksha temple of Golden Wisdom in the city of Retz, Venus. • The Prithvi Lok (Earth World)—the Adept here is Yaubl Sacabi, guardian of the Holy Book at the Gare-Hira temple of Golden Wisdom at Agam Des, the home of the EshwarKhanewale (the God-eaters) in the Himalayan mountains.



58
• The Surati Lok (Mountain world) – the Adept here is Fubbi Quantz, guardian of the Holy Book at the Katsupari Monastery Temple of Golden Wisdom in northern Tibet. • The Asurati Lok (Desert world)—the Adept here is Banjani, guardian of the Holy Book at the Faqiti Monastery temple of Golden Wisdom in the Gobi Desert. The section here is only an introduction to the Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad. Chelas (students) are usually taken here to begin their study of the holy works in the dream state.”
These planes of existence are simply a higher or lower vibration of existence. As we are able to raise our vibration through spiritual exercises, through what many religions would call ‘rightness of thought’ and ‘the right way of living,’ we can become filled with Light, or truly manifest the Light that we are, and thereby raise our awareness to be able to see and travel upon these different levels of Being.
Another Universal Being called Kryon, channeled by Lee Carroll, uses the very good metaphor to explain these various planes of existence, that of a television set:
“If I told him (a person watching one channel), or others around him, that the channels on each side of the one he was viewing did not exist, they would scoff. For they know there are many many channels. And yet there is no evidence at all!”
Kryon describes the universe as being arranged “from the inside out. In semicircles of influence and directorship.” And to describe the levels of spiritual hierarchy, he makes the point that power and control are not words with meanings in Universal organization as we might use them.
“The Universe is centered upon love and purpose. . . As the semicircles of influence and directorship get larger and larger from the center, the outward ones curl back inside and become the center again.”
A key to opening up an understanding of the Universe will come, he says, when Man finds that the speed of light is only a perceived barrier, and that matter and time are related so strongly that they ignore this barrier as a general rule.
Bob Frissell also uses the television metaphor to explain how wavelength or vibration is one of the keys to understanding the Universe:
“We live in a reality created solely by wavelength. The wavelength of our third-dimensional world is 7.23 centimeters. The average length of all the objects in this dimension, if you were to measure them, would be 7.23 centimeters.”
Dimensions are separated from one another by wavelength much as the notes are on a musical scale. Each tone on the scale sounds different because of its wavelength. The piano has eight white keys and five black keys, which together give its player the chromatic scale. In between each key and the next are twelve harmonic points; in dimensional terms these are the overtones. It is also the same as changing channels on a TV set. When you operate the channel control, you are tuning to different wavelengths.
It is also good to keep in mind here that the distances between stars and galaxies are also actually dimensional. Thus when we fail to see lifeforms on another planet with our third dimensional eyes, it does not mean that that planet is not inhabited. The Beings who reside there may just be living on a higher dimensional plane of existence.



59
Dr. Walter Russell says that “God, the Creator is Light, the invisible White Light of the undivided and unchanging Magnetic universe.” He also likens the universe to a musical instrument, the logos or Universal sound, he says, being such an important part of its construction. His example is of a harp with nine strings, with nine tones in each string.
“In Nature the lowest string is the longest. They grow gradually shorter up to the 9th. Likewise, the tonal positions and frequencies change in each string. In every case each note on each string is one octave higher than its next lower string. You will note that each string begins with zero and ends with a zero. These are the key notes of each octave.”
White Light can however, be a trap, in and of itself , if we do not truly know what we are doing or where we are going, as explained in this excerpt:
“The realization of white light for us is the accumulation of seven separate dimensions brought into one. Although the Seventh dimension and the Primordial Second dimension are very similar in the respect that they both produce a white light state in the consciousness of the seeker, the similarity stops there. The 2D is nothing but white light without any divisions or shades of difference! Returning to the 2D is, in fact, the ultimate returning to the womb, back to the beginning before creation. This may sound like what you have always been seeking, but it seems (at least to me) to be a complete reversal of the "Universal intent", that of manifestation!
“What precautions can be taken to prevent this, and how will we know if it has occurred? In the nature of precautions, paramount is the avoidance of desiring the 7D! We learned in the 6D that cessation of desire while working in the world as though we cared intently, was necessary to maintain 6D serenity. Wanting to experience the "white light" state can set in motion a 2D white light state. This is the state most, if not all, mystics experience when so intently and systematically seeking the higher levels of Nirvana!”
Remember all the references to Light that also refer to Lucifer in one or other of his many different forms. This is one way that he traps unknowing seekers after the True Light of the FATHER.
Gothic architecture, which first emerged in abut 1130,and which plays a crucial part in our book later on, is designed using sound and light simply as a reflection of how they were used in the greater construction of the Universe. Utilizing the strong telluric currents (earth forces) of the Earth goddess sites on which these buildings were intentionally built, and under the right conditions, visitors to such buildings could actually be transported into the varying dimensions. The Great Pyramid, along with many of the other pyramids and other sacred sites, was designed to do exactly the same thing.
It is no coincidence that some of these writers and thinkers have chosen to compare the Universe to a musical instrument, for music too was an essential part of this chemistry of design. Music is essentially geometry in the form of sound, and thereby, an interior space, or a Universe, can be constructed musically in accordance with any given scale. These sounds are needed in synchronizing the geometrical light forms.
This concept was expounded long ago by Pythagoras, who stated that numerical scales which agree with the ear are also the same as those which delight the eye and mind. If the FATHER’s Creation is nothing more, it is certainly wondrous to perceive with both the eye, and with the mind.



60
Plato, too, used musical examples as a measure of the harmonious proportion inherent in all things created of Nature, and warned that music was the greatest influence on Man and could be used both to set his spirit free, or to enslave it—whether he realized this as fact or not.



61
Chapter 5—The Experiment
. . . it was more valuable to create a situation whereby there was separate element – to create a universe that would then have the structure to give the atoms or cells that would be populating the Universe different existences, in those proportions necessary for each atoms attainments of its choosing.
------ The Nine.
“In the Beginning,” explain the Nine,“ the One breathed breathless by itself, and turning inward upon itself the tension of One, and became the manyfold all varying densities and intensities of matter and spirit, with the potential to become one union.”
Certainly this is a wonderful example of the implosion explanation of Creation—but its major point is that we are the MANY who have the potential of becoming the ONE again in our return to a more perfect union. We are those individualized sparks of God who must also take responsibility for our Creation and for what it is we are creating , both now and in the nows that represent what we call the future. Ramtha is always one who has been able to cut to the very heart of the matter (a word whose roots themselves go back to the original in mater or mother, hence giving us the expression-- the female form “mater-ialized”):
“Your body is young. Man, in the uprightness of his tested mobility, is only ten and one-half million years old. But you, the light-beings, have always been. Because how does one determine the beginning of contemplative thought based on time, when there wasn’t anything called time? So, you are ancient. And for billions of years, as you term and measure time, you created electrum. Then, lowering electrum into gross matter became a new and different adventure. Thus, through billions of years of design and exploration, man became a living, breathing creature of coagulated thought and intense matter.
“ALL OF THIS PLANE YOU CREATED. That is why reality would not be here if it weren’t for the lot of you. The animals are beloved, for they have been given the breath of life through you, their creators. The flowers are beloved, for they have the patterns of your beauty in them . . . all life does. And it is all because of you.
“Who are you? You are the great gods of light, the great creators of all life. You are the grand, infinite thought, magnified and lowered into creative matter. You are God, the forever thought, experiencing the form called humanity. You are God manifested as man to continue the expansion of thought into forever.”
And it is those thoughts, filled with the energy of our emotions which will create positive energies of Creation, or the dark energies of negativity and decay. It is we too who are responsible, in part, for the creation that is Lucifer. It is we who give him a place to exist within our own hearts, and supply him with the energy to exist—or not.
Lucifer, (Latin for “light-bearer”), is a translation of the Hebrew expression for “bright one.” The Hebrew prophet Isaiah used the term in referring to the king of Babylon, describing the frustrated ambition of the morning star to rise higher than all the other stars, a perfect allusion to the aims and goals of Lucifer himself: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning” (Isaiah 14:12). In the New Testament, star imagery is also applied to the figure of Christ: In 2 Peter 1:19 he is called “day star” (Greek phosphoros), and in Revelation 22:16 he is called



62
“morning star.” The identification of Isaiah’s Lucifer with the Devil began with Saint Jerome and other Fathers of the Church, who held that Jesus implied the identification when he said, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven” (Luke 10:18). Consequently, in Patristic literature, Lucifer is used as a synonym for Satan.
The Gnostic scripture The Secret Book According to John discloses the nature of Lucifer at his creation, and already implies some similarities or some kind of relationship to Jesus:
“Its anointment
“(18) And the invisible virgin spirit rejoiced at the light that had come to exist and that had been shown forth out of the first power of the spirit’s forethought, who is the Barbelo. And the spirit anointed it (the spark) with its own kindness until it became perfect needing no further kindness since it had been anointed with the kindness of the invisible spirit. And it stood at rest in the presence of the spirit, which was . . (28) pouring upon it. And the moment that it received from the spirit it glorified the holy spirit and perfect forethought, because of which it had become disclosed.”
One early term for Lucifer is Ba’al. Ba’al is a Hebrew word that means “lord” or “master.” The only question is to which lord or master they were referring to when using this expression.
Numerous deities were addressed by that title in the Middle East throughout ancient history, but all their names have not come down to us. It would have caused great confusion if the English translators of the Old Testament had translated ba’al into the English word “lord”. So they left the word in Hebrew. To the reader in English it appears to be a name rather than the honorific title it is, a title that is still used in the Jewish faith. For example, one who can work miracles in the name of God is known as Ba’al shem, the lord or master of the Name. . . the Jews did not accuse Jehovah’s rival of being the devil, but rather denigrated him by calling him the lord over nothing, the Lord of the Flies or in Hebrew Ba’al-zbub. Over a thousand years later, impassioned Christians decided that any rival of Jehovah had to be the Devil and anglicized the Hebrew Lord of the Flies to Beelzebub, which they declared to be the name of Satan.
In the Hebrew Bible, as in mainstream Judaism to this day, Satan or Lucifer never appears as Western Christendom has come to know him, as the leader of an “evil empire,” an army of hostile spirits who make war on God and humankind alike? As he first appears in the Hebrew Bible, Satan is not necessarily evil, much less opposed to God. On the contrary, he appears in the book of Numbers and in Job as one of God’s obedient servants—a messenger, or angel, a word that translates the Hebrew term for messenger (mal’ak) into Greek (Angelos). In Hebrew, the angels were often called “sons of God” (ben e ‘elohim), and were envisioned as the hierarchical ranks of a great army, or the staff of a royal court.
Fusion, or the combining of all the parts into a Whole, is the true nature of God. Fission, the breaking apart of that which is one Whole, is of the nature of Lucifer. This can be seen in the explosive nature that has enveloped Mankind. That which is Dark such as the atom bomb, and the ‘Big Bang’ theory of Creation, and nuclear fission as a form of creating energy, are much more readily accepted than anything which is a coming together of elements, such as fusion.
In a speech given at the University of Munich, obtained from the SS secret archives, Dr. W. O. Schumann declared:



63
“In everything we recognize two principles that determine the events: light and darkness, good and evil, creation and destruction—as in electricity we know plus and minus. It is always: either—or.
“These two principles—the creative and destructive –also determine our technical means . . . . everything destructive is of Satanic origin, everything creative is divine . .Every technology based upon explosion or combustion has thus to be called Satanic. The coming new age will be an age of a new, positive, divine technology.”
In Morals and Dogma, Masonic Grand Commander Albert Pike wrote:
“Lucifer, the Light-bearer. Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness. Lucifer, the Son of the Morning. Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!”
Fear is the greatest factor in keeping us here in a state of fission rather than of fusion. The spiritual hierarchy know this. The Nine also know this, for it is part of their role here to act as “guides, as elements of direction, as elements of purpose for those that are manifested into this Universe”:
“. . .There will be times, many times in many lifetimes, when this energy will not come to them, its not something to be afraid of. When this power comes it seems like there is no free will, but it’s the greatest free will. It is the gift of being one with the universal one without the interference of free will. It is the universal center that all humans may know if they only let go of fear.
“When all conscious beings in the Universe are united in consciousness, that consciousness is what we call God. . . “God’ is an inner core of eternal power, and the outer core is the Nine.”
The twenty-four heads of the civilizations, which are called the Universal Civilizations, have their own cohorts and family, but also act to supervise the myriad other civilizations of the Universe. These twenty-four physical civilizations exist in another dimensional realm, a different level of density in the Universe. Each one is a total collective consciousness that oversees a particular area of interest. They are capable of acting in one mind, unanimously and alchemically, and of thereby elevating their awareness and ability to an immense degree. From each civilization, physical beings have variously incarnated upon Planet Earth and at times have intervened in Earth’s history, when necessary.
Civilizations in our own galaxy, according to the Nine, would be regarded as “subcivilizations,’ only some of which are involved with the overall purposes of the Universal Civilizations. Others are tied up with their own affairs, and yet others are “opposed to the overall scheme of things.”
Each of the planets was created and settled for some particular form of teaching and for some particular form of lesson for those who go there. I t is much like a school having separate classrooms for separate subject areas. Each planet also has a different awareness of time, depending on its density and location with regard to the central axis of the Universe. This means that those who exist on those certain planets also have differing life spans. The average Hoovid, of the planet Hoova, lives about 500,000 to 1,500,000 of our Earth years—an eternal being for one who is stuck in the 3rd dimension with a life-span of perhaps only 75 earth years. Our time goes in great slowness relative to other planets because of our physical density.



64
As our scientists will perhaps learn one day, each of the seven Super Universes in Creation is connected to each other one by an intricate system of what these scientists like to term “wormholes”--layers of intense energy through which other vibrations may travel much like fiber optic cables in use today. Light can travel back and forth from place to place along these energy streams (also called Cosmic Currents), as well as Light Beings, and other such positive energies.
These wormholes, therefore, create a link between all the elements of the FATHER’s Creation. This helps to further understand how a cancer, like a virus traveling along the body’s nervous electrical system, could also spread to all the others parts of Creation, if allowed to grow unchecked.
Creation Continues -- Earth
When the viability of Earth being a private getaway spot for Enjliou and Callia was destroyed due to Their obvious difficulties, Earth was then opened up for settlement. As time progressed, it also became the sight of the most ambitious experiment ever undertaken, an experiment in the blending of the various races of the Universe, and each races individual traits. The specifics of this will be taken up in the next chapter, Starseeding, but for now it is important to understand how the Earth and its dimensions are structured in order to be able to do this.
The first important element to understand is time, in and of itself, a dimension, just as we think of length, breadth or height. Time is also one of the strongest illusions that keeps soul trapped here in the lower dimensions. Soul is eternal, but it can be trapped in ‘the tunnel’ of this third dimension time for a very, very, very long time. It is a paradox that each one of us needs to recognize and deal with in its own time of growth and understanding. When viewed from within the MEST worlds (matter, energy, space, and time), time is seen to be linear, like travelling on one of those moving walkways at airports or shopping malls, only this one goes through a hollow plastic tube which does not seem to allow you to step beyond its confines. The is the walkway of history as we shall follow It throughout this book. When you are outside this linear tube, however, you see that time is circular, feeding back upon itself like a snake swallowing its own tail. In this case, you can travel back and forth along it, and enter at any point. The walls of the tube are the restrictions for those inside to keep them “in line.” Time, however, is all really now, and much of what we think of in this creation story didn’t happen that very long ago, relatively speaking. The time of having people on this planet is also really short when compared with the measurable age of the Universe.
What we are talking about in referring to higher and lower dimensions is that what we here on earth live in the 3rd dimension, the astral plane is the 4th dimension, and so on. While time does exist on the higher dimensions, it travels more slowly there because of their lighter vibration and/or density. Beings exist for what seem like eternities compared with life here on Earth. Therefore, experience itself must also be compacted into a more dense or concentrated form here because of the shorter time we exist here. That is why it such a popular destination for souls seeking to advance rapidly in their awareness. Like an honors class at school, they gain much more experience in a shorter period of time, and gain much more credit for it – but only if they succeed.
There are actually 14 dimensions lined concentrically around the Earth. Some groups talk about seven, others about nine or ten, and even a few that recognize as many as twelve, depending on how high their own spiritual leaders have been able to achieve. Different religious



65
groups have their ‘heaven’ on different levels of the dimensions depending on their focus. Like those who tempt the character Christian to lay down his burden and not seek any further in that grand metaphorical novel, A Pilgrim’s Progress, they do not realize that they are really stopping short of the many levels of heaven above them. Just as on the 3rd dimensional level, many beings who exist at these higher frequencies, are also not aware that there are other levels above and below them.
A good way to visualize the form of these dimensions is given by the Council of Nine:
“Within, in your mind, visualize your Earth. Then from your Earth visualize that there are waves spiraling outward. And one wave creates another, and as it circulates, it grows. And it creates more and more. And it is heavy in the beginning, and if it has a sound it is loud of sound. And as it radiates out it becomes refined, it becomes more expansive, and all of those irritants that exist within the physical planet earth are eliminated as it becomes a pure sound and a pure wave. And if you would have it in the color of brown or blacks, as it is radiating out it is also being purified, until it becomes in truth the color of colorless, which is in truth a golden light.”
This exercise also takes note of the different densities of vibration which each plane has, and of the differing levels of purity of the Light as one goes higher [Be aware that we call this thing we live on a ‘plane-et’]. It also recognizes the accompanying sound that becomes purified as one rises until only the single note of a flute is heard. When one is able to travel through these higher vibration planes, the type of sound one hears is a good indicator of the plane on which one finds themselves working.
Each soul as it comes to the planet acquires a number of sheaths or ‘bodies’ of increasingly denser vibration, our own set of ‘dimensional holograms’, until the last we acquire is the physical shell we know as the human body. In all there are five bodies –in ascending order of vibration they are the physical, the astral, the causal, the mental or etheric, and of course Soul. While the physical body is interacting with its own seeming reality upon this planet, these finer ‘bodies’ are also interacting with their own corresponding levels of awareness. Astral travel, or travel in the astral body, is probably the best known of these. One can, however, travel in any of the five bodies, the only restriction being that one cannot go any higher than the dimension corresponding to the body in which they are travelling. When one begins to Soul travel, or travel in their soul body, then one can go to any level of any of the various planes they choose if they have earned that right.
Astral projectionists who often drift into other dimensions and find themselves grotesquely huge, find themselves looking down at an earth and moon the size of marbles. They may (also) cross what seems to be the entire universe in an instant and find themselves looking back at a Milky Way that has become nothing more than a feeble glint of light in the cosmos. And often they get the feeling that they are an infinitesimal part of something much larger.
Barbara Clow describes in one of her writings, an experience she had returning through these dimensions as describing it as through “the layers of the ego, the layers of control of the energy.” In truth, this is what they are. She relates her perception that dimensionality is vertical, and describes the planes as experiential fields:
“. . . the systems that form out of nine dimensional columns of vertical light create disks that are experiential fields which create realities. The Galaxy itself has a horizontal plane that can be



66
divided up into twelve zones of experience, and the experiences that occur generate a vertical axis of nine dimensions at a right angle.”
She likens these various planes to levels of identity—“a structure of existence called Jacob’s Ladder,” the Biblical ladder on which angels or emissaries of God are seen to ascend and descend to earth. In truth, this is the sacred meaning of the Cross or the Rosi Crucis (the Rosy Cross which is the cross within the circle)—the x and y vertical axes of the multidimensional Universe.
Each Universal body has its own dimensional system. Many planets have only a basic tendimensional system. Earth, with fourteen, is indeed a very special planet. This explains why a planet can be inhabited by multitudes of sentient beings living at a different vibrational or dimensional level, without our Earth scientists being able to see them with through 3rd dimensional eyes and with 3rd dimensional equipment. Participants trained in the U.S. and Russian government’s remote viewing programs have stories to tell of being able to bilocate to other planets and watch the lifeforms there carrying on about their business without being seen themselves.
Author Bob Frissell says that even though a person may be able to travel in their merkaba (the body’s own interdimensional light-space vehicle) to other planes or levels of existence, if their consciousness is not developed enough to handle the higher vibrational levels, they will not be able to remain. Certain beings, he says, have managed to move through all the dimensional levels and remain conscious. Some beings have even been able to master all 144 dimensional levels and their overtones while remaining conscious and stable along the way. These “144” levels he refers to are the accessible twelve dimensions and the twelve harmonic overtones which accompany each one of them (12x12=144). The beings who have been able to come and go through all the many various levels or dimensions are what many here on Earth would call the Ascended Masters.
Even the planet Earth itself has, or is, its own dimension of consciousness, known as Gaia. It exists on and is the 2nd dimensional level as we know it. As Clow describes it, Gaia simply is an energy that holds frequencies. Trees are a direct connection between the 2nd and the 3rd dimensions–they bring the energy of the one into the energies of the other to help create and support it. The best way to in fact get ‘grounded’ is actually to go and ‘hug” a tree. In studying the theories of agriculture, one is actually studying the aspects of Creation itself on one level or another. Each living physical body is surrounded by an energy body that is the blueprint of the physical body. Before a plant starts to grow a leaf, it can be detected in the energy field surrounding the plant. Changes in the physical form can be detected in the energy field first. This energy field is a super-physical field. Western man’s isolation from the land has taken him farther and farther away from an understanding of the natural cycles of birth, death, and rebirth which is reincarnation, and the practical application of that science to his FATHER's lands, in all dimensions of existence.
The human body is an electro-magnetic energy-form with structural lines of force running around it which can be used to heal the body of illness and dis-ease using techniques such as acupuncture, energy work, or shiatsu. So does planet Earth. The system of magnetic lines of energy which intersect to form a grid or net-work surrounding the planet are called ley lines. An understanding of these will help us to understand many of the religious practices carried out on



67
the planet since its inception, and also how the planet can and has been used as a weapon in the struggle for the ultimate control over its inhabitants.
Energy organizes itself in fields and networks, with major and minor nodes of energyinterchange, connected by meridians or energy-links. From an esoteric viewpoint, no physical form can exist and take shape unless there is a subtle energy-field to give it patterning and the inner basis for existing. And these energy-fields are the outward manifestations of consciousness, which also organizes itself in patterns.
These energy fields which surround all conscious things are studied in the field called morphogenetics. Simply put, life or matter must have a boundary of electro-magnetic energy into which it can place itself; a boundary which serves to stop its atoms from floating off into space. This is the thought form into which the energy of emotion is placed to ‘materialize’ something into being.
Imagine, if you will, a large net in which there are thousands of balloons trapped into a single shape. Then imagine what would happen if that net were not there or was opened up to set the balloons free. So it is with Creation. Everything needs a structure into which its energy can be placed—for that is all we and everything else are, Sound and Light energy, slowed down into what we think of as gross matter.
As Gregg Braden says, we are bathed in electrical potential throughout our life, and it is this “trickle charge” of static electricity that is partially responsible for holding the magnetic alignment between our body and the patterns of our experience.
Braden cites recent studies which have validated the brain/earth relationship through magnetics. One international team studying the phenomenon of “magnetoreception” (the ability of the body to detect magnetic fluctuations) announced that the human brain contains “millions of tiny particles” which can, in turn, be consciously tuned to resonate with the vibrations of planetary consciousness. The magnetic particles within the brain serve as a physical link; the static potential serves as the “trickle charge” holding the information component of the particles in place.
Ancient texts have always told us that the body seeks to find a harmonic balance between itself and planet Earth. This is a prime requisite for people who wish to achieve greater spiritual harmony in their lives. Our separation from Mother Earth does not allow us to ever feel fully grounded into our bodies, nor our lives to harmoniously synchronize with the various ebbs and flows of natural cycles here.
Braden’s work also suggests that this balance between mind and earth is the goal of the life experience, echoing the spiritual-physical balance we have already talked about. It may, he says, be consciously regulated through the use of non-polarized thoughts of forgiveness and feelings of compassion.
Part of the system of our own DNA consists of invisible magnetic strands which provide the magnetically stored information to each cell to help it function. These magnetic DNA streams also help create the morphogenetic field or aura around our bodies. This magnetic information helps the cells to know what their purpose is, as well as to detail each cell’s regeneration properties. This new information also helps to explain why some spiritually aware people are convinced that we have more DNA strands coming, to complete our “ageless body” ascended forms. If some of



68
these strands are invisible, or non biological, then many of us may already have some of them in place.
The magnetics involved act like a coding sequence for the cells just like magnetic tape. Cells will actually secrete chemicals in direct response to magnetic stimulation of focused fields. Our biology doesn’t just react to any magnetic field but only to a certain kind. A magnetic focused field is any magnetic field that is designed. A simple magnet is a focused field. It has symmetrical lines of influence and a known strength which is constant. An electromagnet is even better. Common household objects such electric blankets, electric motors, a hair dryer, static magnets for stereo or CD, a neighborhood transformer box , your computer, speakers ---if it can swing a compass needle, then it can affect you!
The Akashic Records are stored magnetically in the electro-magnetic or morphogenetic fields that surround the planet. These are the memory banks of all that has gone on within the planets energy field since the very beginning of time. A person’s aura works just the same way to store everything that has ever gone on within that Soul’s individual existence.
Are you beginning to get a picture now of the task that faced Enjliou, Callia, and ARTOLA, in creating the Universe? Layers upon layers upon layers of Creation, with countless forms of being, and myriad interconnecting aspects that do not happen all by themselves simply at the drop of a hat. Even They had Their helpers to help do the smaller, more individualized tasks of Creation. Certain levels of angels and devas were responsible for plant life, for animal life, and so on.
It’s kind of like when you were a kid and knew your father was an auditor, and then one day as you grew up you found out what an auditor does and how much concentration and effort it takes to do that job, so all of a sudden you start to appreciate you dad a whole lot more for what he does for you. Creation is not just the flash of a magic wand in space.
Each one of us is also able to create in much the same way, depending on our level of awareness. All we need to do is first--create an energy field by picturing what it is we want to manifest; then—fill that field or thought form with the emotional energy of desire; and then it will manifest into our lives –sooner or later depending on the strength of our desire and our focus. This is also how we manifest negative things into our lives however. By creating a picture of what we don’t want to happen, and filling it with the emotional energy of fear. We do this unconsciously throughout the day, but then it becomes a matter of ‘guard your thoughts’ and be careful what you wish for, because someday you just might get it. This is how we, too, are able to become conscious co-workers with the FATHER in Creation. Each of us has that limited ability, but not all of us have the desire, nor the concentration.
To put this all into a greater perspective let’s take a quick look at one author’s view of the composition of the MEST worlds as related to vortexes. It corresponds to closely to what Churchward describes of the Void from ancient texts, as well as what Thoth says about his experience of Time.
“Besides matter, space and time can also be seen as aspects of the vortex. Consider a vortex of energy forming matter. A vortex is not restricted to a certain area. As the vortex extends out, the energy would get thinner, would get infinitesimal small at large distances from the center, but would never disappear. This very thin matter is the apparent void of space. Or, one could say, matter is very dense space. Matter and space are two aspects of the same vortex of energy. We only perceive matter and space as different because of our senses. All our senses are limited.



69
Our awareness is constrained within certain bands by our threshold of perception. (For instance: we can only see a limited part of the light spectrum. Our eyes can not detect light below ultraviolet or beyond infrared.)
“Matter is the dense central region of the vortex, which we can detect with our senses. Space consists of the thin peripheral region of the vortex, which is below our threshold of perception. Matter has no real boundary; its surface is subjective, corresponding to the lowest intensity of vortex energy that we can perceive. We experience everyday matter as substantial because it represents a high concentration of vortex energy. In bodies of matter, billions of vortexes are packed together in atoms and molecules. The surface of a solid, or liquid, or even a cloud of gas, marks a sudden increase in the number of vortices. This sudden high concentration of vortex energy is what our senses perceive as matter. Objects appear to have a boundary. But this is an illusion. It is simply that our senses are incapable of detecting the sparse energy spreading out in all directions.
“Human auras are undetectable to most people . . . (they)do not change with any outside influence but only when there is a change of the inner self, or spiritual difference within the individual. It is seldom that any psychic influence can reach the heart of the problem.
“Space can be pictured as a bubble of vortex energy surrounding matter. If it would be possible to remove every particle of matter in the universe, then space would completely disappear also. On the other hand, space is shaped according to the matter it engulfs. This is predicted by Relativity Theory also and is verified by experiments. Light from distant stars does not travel in straight lines through space. It is deflected by other stars that are close to its path. Once when Einstein was asked to explain his Relativity Theory in a few sentences, his reply in a nutshell was: "Remove matter from the universe, and you also remove space and time." In view of the vortex theory, time can be seen as emanating from the movement of the vortex. In general, time is established by a consecutive sequence of events. Thus the movement of the vortex creates time.
A Hierarchy of Super-physical Realms
“An object of which the speed of the vortex movement is increased above the speed of light will disappear from this physical universe and enter a super-physical universe. This superphysical universe has its own space-time realm, distinct from the physical space-time. The physical and super-physical universes are interpenetrating each other. They are not separated by space and time but by a dimension that is the speed of the vortex movement. It is well possible that this super-physical realm has its own critical speed of vortex movement; for instance twice the speed of light. Going through this barrier would transubstantiate an object into a second higher realm of super-energy and so on. Each higher realm includes all the lower ones, because greater speeds contain all lesser speeds. In each realm, all forms of energy with speeds at or below the speed of its critical speed can exist.
“The super-physical is the living sphere of nature elementals like elves, gnomes and fairies. Higher realms are occupied by angelic beings, of which is often said that they inhabit a hierarchy of worlds. In view of the vortex, each of these worlds would be characterized by a certain critical speed of the vortex energy.”
Cycles are an integral part of the vortex which is Creation. Before we tackle other subjects then, we must also first understand the cycles involved with soul as it comes to exist in this



70
universe and particularly on this densely physical planet. These cycles also help affect what is going on at any given stage of the planet’s history. Although they are very common in Eastern tradition, these cycles are not well understood in the West.. They, of course, include the cycle of reincarnation. This has been a concept taught by almost every religion, but one edited out of much of basic Christianity, although openly taught by many of the branches of mystic Christianity such as Gnosticism and the Essene teachings from which Jesus himself sprang.
Reincarnation is basically rebirth; the coming and going of SOUL into a new body each time It enters into this world. Since Soul’s basic task is to experience pretty much every experience in the FATHER’s Creation, you can imagine this can take a lot of lifetimes; and not all on one planet or in one solar system either, and not necessarily even all in one Super Universe.
The Wheel of Eighty-Four is the cycle of reincarnation. It is the twelve paths soul must experience in its comings and goings in the lower worlds of Creation; the twelve paths, or divisions, of the wheel of becoming. Soul spends eighty-four lacs in each birth sign, and each lac is equivalent to one hundred thousand years; eighty-four lacs amount to eight million four hundred thousand years. Now you understand how we get the expression that he or she is ‘an old Soul.’ This does not even account for all the time we also spend in-between various incarnations.
True spiritual freedom is obtained when we have become aware enough that we are able to rise above this cycle, and liberate ourselves from the Wheel of Eighty-Four, or wheel of life, from karma (the balance of payments of each soul), from having to reincarnate, and from all ills of the mortal world. True spiritual freedom is the ability to come and go among all the worlds of the cosmic order as desired; to achieve what is called Jivan Mukti, or spiritual liberation in the here and now. This does not mean separating one’s self from life and the goings on of the world –but rather coming to a place of involved detachment from what is going on. Service and surrender are the two fastest ways to true peace of mind and Oneness with the FATHER.
The evolutionary cycle of time on this planet is divided into four ages as determined by the needs of both Soul and planetary growth. These are commonly called Yugas from the Hindu word for ‘cycle.’ Each Yuga comprises what we might think of as a day of God.
The seven days of God or seven Yugas, that comprise one week in the Mind of God, are also the Seven Evolutionary Steps of Man written about by Randolph Winters in his book, The Pleiadean Mission. We have only included what we feel to be most relevant here, but highly suggest the reader take a look at the full seven cycles. Remember that seven is the number of Time, and a very influential number in Lucifer’s attempt to control the Universe. It will also serve to give the reader an idea of what is meant by each planet or system having its own lessons or level of evolution. Like the varying grades or years at a school, these steps give to Soul its varied lessons in its climb up the Jacob’s Ladder of increasing spiritual awareness.
“On earth we are just becoming aware of our spiritual consciousness and its ability to communicate with the eternal knowledge of Creation. The great spiritual minds of the Pleiades have analyzed the development of the human being and discovered how the evolution of the Creation dictates the development of the human spirit-form as well. Just as the Creation must earn its way seven greattimes on a path to perfection, so must man. The human life form evolves through understanding learned from experience following the same design as Creation. There are seven main levels of evolutionary development with seven sublevels.



71
“Creation goes through the development of seven levels of life forms—intelligent light, fluffy matter, gas, mineral, flora, fauna, and human—to complete the cycle of one greattime. It will then repeat that seven times in order to reach perfection and transform itself into a life form of higher consciousness. As part of Creation, man follows this same guideline and goes through seven main levels of development, each with seven sublevels of learning. Man’s existence begins as a spirit-form, which is connected to the eternal energy of the Creation, and ends up a pure spiritual form that returns to the Creational Source, becoming part of the knowledge that directs the growth of the universe.
“On the planet Earth the natural cycles of development occur as they do throughout the universe. First the planet is formed from the primordial gas, which takes billions of years. As evolution continues, eventually the mineral kingdom is formed., followed by the flora, or food, kingdom The animal kingdom is next, since now there is food available. All along this path of development, the spiritual energy of the New Creation is gaining in wisdom that gives it the intelligence to create the next step. As the energy becomes more intelligent, its force, or vibrational level as some call it, increases. It can be seen and measured as an aura around all things.”
Before beginning on the narration of these seven grand cycles, it may be helpful here to read what Mary Summer Rain says in her book, Soul Sounds, about her remembrances of the time before she entered the planet’s reincarnational cycle. So we will interrupt Winter’s work here briefly to share this very timely information with the reader, especially since it also confirms so much of what we have already mentioned, and relates very closely what is going on here on the planet at the present time and our discussion about Lucifer.
“I can clearly remember my life before entering into this earthly realm. It was so incredibly, vibrationally light and beautiful. I was among those I loved and who, in turn, loved me. We all worked together as one mind and one purpose. We were The Great White Brotherhood.
“Although all members of The Brotherhood were united in the way of being completed ones who carried out God's will, we also had major divisions within the group. Some were messengers, some were light warriors, others were spiritual advisors to those completed ones who were serving physical missions. Some were protectors (these usually were the Archangels Gabriel, Raphael, Ariel and Michael), some were direct intermediaries between The Brotherhood division heads and God—who brought God's plans for specific missions required and current direction for various projects already in place.
“It was always a great honor to serve God by volunteering for a physical mission or being asked to perform one. I had done so several times, but always loved returning to my main position as Record Keeper.
“When the head of special projects approached me, I knew what was on his mind.
"We need you again," he'd said.
"Earth?"
"Yes. The Master sees a great need there. He wishes you to rekindle the ember again."
"But the others (the Starborn) will do that. It was foreseen and so deemed within the Plan."



72
"This is so, but humankind has strayed too far too fast. They will nearly destroy their planet before the Others' time is right. Humankind has fallen into the confusion and chaos Belial has brought upon them with a silken tongue, coated with honey, and the people are believing his words."
"Surely they can tell."
"It seems not, for Belial has cloaked his minions in spiritual robes, and they do magic and speak golden words while giving out concepts contrary to the Precepts. The fervent Christians have become arrogant, religious sects are killing one another, and the self is becoming paramount in their minds."
“To descend down the Vibrational Corridor for a physical lifetime was always a daring thing to do, because there was always the chance that the physical entity could incur karma. To accept an earthly mission was the least desired job possible.”
The Seven Evolutionary Steps of Man:
I) Step One—Beginning Life
1. Beginning Development of the Intellect
These are the first material lives on earth. The human form is nothing more than a spirit-for m trying to develop its intellect. There is no accumulated knowledge from previous lives, only the intellect of the spirit which has not lived in a body before and can barely take care of itself, for it has no understanding of the material world at this time. All humans look the same at this point since our facial expressions, bodies, color etc are expressions of experiences, wisdom, emotions, and ego that we have not yet developed. Our lives are short as our spirits have very low energy to sustain the material existence. We also die young due to poor health.
2. Beginning Development of Spiritual Growth
Through numerous lifetimes we begin to think and provide wisdom to the spirit. The process of evolution has begun. Simple-minded, we can barely feed ourselves and sustain life.
3. Beginning Development of Reason
We can now think and reason a little better. We have lived many brief lives and are starting to build intelligence from the experiences of previous lives. We are 20 to 30 million years old at this point. The counting of age begins with the start of the first material lifetime and includes the sleep period on the other side that we call death.
4. Beginning Using Thinking.
We can live longer now, for we are able to feed ourselves, start a fire, and build shelter. Our accumulated wisdom is providing us with some assistance since our spirit is now beginning to understand the physical existence better, and it can provide the occasional hunch or idea learned from previous lives to help out.
5. Beginning Development of Reasonable Actions
We are still very primitive and living in caves. We don’t get along with each other, and in our material consciousness, we have absolutely no idea who e are or why we are here. We are trying to develop some more rational thinking patterns., but it’s going slow. We can’t even understand each other.



73
6. Beginning Development of Thinking and Action
Reasonable thinking and understanding are becoming useful in our day-to-day lives. We are starting to understand each other and are starting to work together. Man’s appearance is unique, for his body and face are reflecting the experiences and wisdom of his life.
7. Beginning Awareness of reason
Reasoning and rational thinking are now in control of our lives. We can communicate through language, symbols, and signs. We are starting to form communities and learning to get along.
II) Step Two –Life with Reasoning and Rational Thinking.
1. Beginning Development of Reason.
Our ability to reason and solve problems is making a difference. We are still not aware that we are also a spirit-form. We are only beginning to question and look for answers. Life is purely a material existence to us.
2. Awareness of Reasoning and Its Use
We are now aware of reasoning and understand its use. We are searching for answers to our existence. Emotions are coming into play as fear, anger, and hostility begin to govern our lives. We all look much different form each other now, for we are noticeably on different paths of discovery and experience. The problems in life are being solved through our reasoning ability, and we now regard ourselves as rational, thinking beings.
3. Development of the Awareness of Higher Influences.
We are aware that there are powers in the world more advanced than our own and are searching for them We question the power of the stars, sun, moon and nature around us. We are unsure of our existence and are looking for meaning in our lives. The moon an stars puzzle us as we search for answers to their existence.
4. Awareness of Higher Influences
We start to develop belief systems, such as worshipping idols, gods, and the sun, without actually having any knowledge of what w e are doing. We are till without knowledge of the spiritual side of life.
5. Belief in Higher Forces, Superstition, Fear of Evil, Veneration of Good.
Here we see the development of religions, superstition, and gods. Our lack of real knowledge of Creation and fear make us vulnerable to powers that we don’t understand. Most of the current mass of humanity on Earth is at this stage.
6. First Awareness of the Meaning of Our Lives and the Real Spiritual Life. Development of the First Spiritual Cognitions and Their Use, Spiritual Healing, Telepathy.
Now comes man’s first awareness of the spiritual world. He is looking for answers but has no real understanding. It is the beginning of awareness of spirit and its uses. This will be the first attempt at using the powers of spirit without real knowledge. This is the current position of the average earthman, who at this level of development can gain only 9.4 months of spiritual growth within a lifetime. At this point we are around 80 to 100 million years old as spiritual beings.



74
7. Development of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The mind is developing, and our accumulated wisdom learned from millions of years of lifetimes is creating intellect. Man is becoming aware that there is more to life than his brief material existence.
III) Step Three—Life with Intelligence.
1. Development of the Intellect, High Technology Advancements in Spiritual Forces, First Development of Living Forms
It is the age of the mind. We can be considered intelligent life forms now. We have broken through the age of ignorance and have advanced well in the sciences. Our awareness of our spirits and our connection to Creator is stronger, for we are learning more about the powers of our spirit. We have learned to create new foods, to crossbreed animals, and are searching for the understanding of how life works.
2. Awareness and exercise of Knowledge, truth, and Wisdom. Slow Dissolution of Acceptance of Belief.
We are leaving behind the thinking of the past. We no longer accept old myths, idols, and false gods. Real intellect and reasoning are providing us with enlightenment.
3. First usage of Knowledge and Wisdom.
High technology is becoming apart of our world. Genetic engineering has led to the creation of the first life forms. The secrets of the universe are beginning to unfold to us, and man is learning about his place in the scheme of things. This is the present position of the educated Earth human being, scientist, etc.”
Thus it can be seen that planet earth is still on a very primitive rung of the spiritual ladder only half way through step 3 of the seven step evolutionary cycle. Most of mankind still has an even longer way to go. The intermediary and higher levels of these seven evolutionary steps can be found in Winter’s book.
The corresponding Eastern cycles of time are the Yugas. A description of the four primary age of this cycle can be found in The ECK-Vidya Ancient Science of Prophecy: Life Cycles of Men, Nations, and Planets:
• The first four tenths of the greater cycle known as the Mahayuga, or 1,728,000 years, of that time is the first age known as the Satya Yuga. It was the Golden Age in terms of CREATION, a time of innocence and happiness on the planet, a true Garden of Eden, a time when the few beings on the planet followed the laws of Spirit without the necessity for any kind of enforcement as such.
• The second Yuga was the Tretya Yuga, the Silver Age in terms of Creation, when things were generally not as good, and man had to work for the things he wanted. (Vidya) This lasted for approximately 1,296,000 years.
• The third Yuga was the Dwarpara Yuga or the Brass Age when things became more savage upon the planet. It lasted for approximately 864,000 years.



75
• And the fourth Yuga or age is the Kali Yuga, the Iron Age, the one we are living in today in which things get seriously difficult and nasty. It began in February of 3102 BC, and lasts for 432,000 years.
“The descending numbers (of years in each Yuga or age) represent a similar physical and moral deterioration of mankind in each age. There are also smaller cycles within these larger cycles, and the cycles of nature usually follow a twelve-year pattern. Then there are smaller and smaller cycles, usually based on the numbers 3 and 12.
“The life of the individual Soul in a human body is based on a twelve-year cycle. Soul has only a certain period of time in each body that it takes on during any and each incarnation. Man’s personal longevity comes to just about six or less cycles within one body, so it means that he is not capable under the reign of the Kali Yuga to live out his full life span. Of course this is the physical and moral degeneration of the individual since the era of the Golden Age, when man lived in what was then the perfect body. He must learn that he cannot go back to that state until he has turned back and sought perfection again, through Soul unfoldment.”
All of these cycles have great influence on the souls living in the lower worlds. They also greatly affect the cycles of history which we are about to take a look at in the following chapters. Knowing that we are living in the Kali Yuga doesn’t make it any easier. Neither does it give us an excuse for any behavior which is against the Higher Will. The Council of Nine in Schlemmer’s work repeatedly stress the problems this Earth is creating in the overall system because of its inhabitants’ fixation with the pleasures involved with sexual activity.
They stress, as said before, that Earth is the planet for us to learn to balance between the physical and the spiritual worlds. All the souls that exist in the universe have had, at one time or another, the necessity to manifest on the physical planet Earth, for the lessons to be learned, our purpose being to live in true balance, in manifestation of unconditional love, and in connection with the Creator.
In order for the Universe to evolve, it is important for Planet Earth to evolve, for without this planet being evolved, the other planets in the Universe are also not able to go forward.
Our lack of growth as a planetary consciousness has, indeed, stopped the growth of the Universe. The problem lies in the dense physicality of the 3rd dimension. Earth was, as said, an experiment, and that experiment was to find out partially, what would happen to Soul when placed in a dense corporeal 3D body. No one yet knew what would happen. That is the reason for having an experiment. The Council of Nine express their feelings that this was not totally a negative thing because it gave us a greater challenge to learn to balance the physical with the spiritual:
“We were not aware of the problems that the physical would create . . . The physical body has different feeling than in all the other planets and in all the other souls that exist. In other systems, other galaxies, there are other physical beings that do not have the density of this planet . . . it has the feel of desire. It is pleasure and pain. Yet this has become very important for the evolutionary growth of the planet, because it was originally the planet of balance.”
Gabriel of Sedona, in his book The Divine New Order, talks about one of the difficulties of mixing higher potential beings and lower potential beings all on the one planet, and the fall away



76
from the original purposes of physical reproduction, Here, Earth’s name is known as Urantia, and this is in fact the name it is known by in the Higher Worlds.
“From time eternal there was in the mind of God a plan for a union of souls, male and female, on all evolutionary worlds where the birth of the children and the spiritual growth of the planet was the primal order. This perfect plan, a masterpiece, was upset by the Lucifer rebellion, the subsequent fall of Planetary prince, Caligastia, and the later default of the Material Son and daughter, Adam and Eve. Because of the spiritual decadence and genetic imbalance, Urantia became a planet where marriages and mating between the opposite sexes were not marriages of cosmic origin and spiritual attunement, but marriages of animalistic origin and materialistic expediency. That was true of twentieth-century civilization, especially America. The teachings of complementary polarities and soul mates go far beyond the scope of my sharing in this orientation. I will briefly state that it became quite evident that there were few males and females who were united in true fourth-dimensional complimentary polarity unions. Even those who wrote books on the subject of twin flames and soul mates and who were initiators in the field, were not united with their true complimentary polarities and in fact had divorced the wives with whom they co-authored their first books. Most individuals, having married the prince or princess of their dreams, soon discovered that they did not get all that they had hoped or bargained for in their mate. The reasons for this were numerous. The spiritual growth of the individual, or lack of it is the foremost reason for either obtaining a high-stage soul mate or complement, or a low stage or non soul mate. Since the various cultures of the planet and the existing realities within them were far from fourth-dimensional cosmic reality, on an international level, souls had to be educated with new concepts and new ways of looking at reality, particularly interpersonal relationships.”
The question may have arisen in he reader’s mind by now--Does the FATHER know everything? The answer is--If HE did, then what would be the purpose of sending out HIS Creation by which to experience that which was Created? Free Will creates the opportunity for countless realties to occur, much like the final television episode of Star Trek-The Next Generation in which there were hundreds of Starship Enterprises each existing in their own reality split off from the one central reality. Each decision we make gives us another division in the road we may take. And so it is that there are limitless possibilities for experience, and each soul’s experience is indeed different from each other one. You are unique.
The reader might also wonder--Does the FATHER know what decision a person is going to make in any given situation? The FATHER chooses not to see until you have made your choice, for that is the power of Free Will. Does He see the darkness when you choose to go that way? No, for the FATHER cannot even not see the darkness. He only sees the Light of His immortal Creation. Judgement Day? Karma is the law of balance in the universe, and indeed, everything we do comes back to us, both positive and negative—it is a squaring up or balancing of accounts. Sometimes it may take a few lifetimes if we have a lopsided balance of payments, but that is why we are born into such varying situations. The FATHER also does not judge us, why then should we also preoccupy our minds with judging others? Judge not . . .but do be aware.
So, besides the Lucifer anomaly, what else went wrong in this experiment in 3D physical density?
Firstly, Soul’s desire for the dense physicality of this world, the pleasure and pain and the materialism it elicits, holds It to this planet. This keeps It reincarnating here over and over again when It should be moving on to other planets, and other new experiences. This creates a



77
“bottleneck” in the reincarnation system of the Universe, thus stopping the growth of other planets and other areas of Creation.
Sex as we know it, and the desire we have created for it, does not exist on the other planets, for the most part except for the interaction of some alien species with our own. Sex has become a major means of controlling the people, so it has been used by everyone from the government on down to get people to follow. This is especially true of business where marketing and advertising have built an unnatural mystique around sex that has spawned an enormous economy around just this one single aspect of life—sex.
Since people are therefore so attached to all the material world and to the enjoyment they think they can derive from it, no one wants to leave. This causes what the Council of Nine calls ‘soul-recycling.’ For many souls, each of the soul-recyclings causes them to have greater and greater desire and more and more enjoyment for even more of the pleasures of life, especially those addicted to power. This locks those souls into the spirit-realms surrounding the planet, waiting to reincarnate, or sometimes simply as astral entities sucking enjoyment from others vicariously. Thus, not only do we have an individual balance of payment problems, we have a planetary balance of payments problem as well.
The experiment has gone haywire, and the laboratory has been taken over by those who were originally supposed to be part of the experiment. The finest example of this is the recent movie version of H.G. Well’s classic novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau. In this story, the genetically altered and electronically manipulated, half-man half animal creations decide they no longer wanted to play by their creator’s rules. The results are disastrous. So it is with planet Earth, and the consequences it has on the rest of the Universe are also disastrous as well. This is just one of the movies that has great allegorical significance to the story of Creation we are following, and they bear further study. We will mention them more as the opportunity arises.
This over-use or abuse of the procreative function has had led proportionally to a greater growth of bad feelings about ourselves. According to The Nine, it has also created great guilt in us. In due course, this guilt has made people more vulnerable to manipulation by those in power and those also seeking to control us. If people overindulge, they become lazy and apathetic. They then labor with the burden of being made to make their own decisions, maintain their own standards, or even form their own conclusions about matters affecting everyone. Over the course of time, this leads to a tendency to simply leave things to the authorities, those who we think ‘know best.’ In any given news story on television in the newspaper or on radio, we are always deluged with the opinions of experts, often people who don’t have a practical lick of sense, and don’t really know a hill of beans about practical applications of problems to real life situations. We have now come to rely heavily on the opinions of others, but never on our own intuition and reasoning faculties.
The corruption of the innocent joy of sexuality by guilt has also made it increasingly difficult for people to gain access to the true happiness and fulfillment possible in being incarnate here on Earth. This, the Nine say, has created a carcinogenic battle going on within us, between our libido and our guilt.
This strikes at the very heart of the Creation story since we are, for the most part, already living the archetype of our Creator Parents. The staggering increase in cancer rates over the past



78
few decades is not just from the pollution we live in and put in and on our bodies, but moreover from the attitudes and emotions we hold within us, never feeling comfortable enough to release.
It is also a fact that the increasingly large population here on the planet tugs at our selfimage and makes us feel small in an ever increasing world. This not only brings up a feeling of hopelessness, but makes us feel even more so that we are incapable of ever doing anything on our own. Isn’t this an archetypal memory from vague remembrances of existing in that Cosmic Sea of Soul—one among the multitude? The realization we need here to release this memory is that everything we do, and everything we think, goes to on to make up the consciousness of the whole. We are not just one small atom of life in a very large Borg-like mentality—we are also the whole, in and of Itself, for everyone else's experiences and learning are also available to us. We have all the creative power of the Universe behind us, and yet feel powerless to even change our own little worlds. If we do not change ourselves, and accept ourselves, where then will the change in consciousness begin?
The Nine say it is the extremes of pleasure and pain which most affect the Soul, and the inability of one to “remove self from self in this heavy gravitational density.
“When you remove self from self, it creates an unblocking so the emotional gravitational density can be relieved, and the true reality may be viewed . . .If we do not want to take the responsibility for freeing ourselves in thought or in emotions, then it is just too easy for us to say it is not possible.”
How well this echoes Clow’s vision of the various dimensions being layers of ego that we need to work our way through in order to get a clearer view of the true reality of who we are and our relationship to Creation at large. The spiritual hierarchy cannot do it for us, for They only work through people. And They will not do it for us, although They are always willing to help if we ask. Because of Their respect for the Free Will given to all by the FATHER, They will only help when asked.
Humankind has a responsibility not only for this planet Earth, but for the Universe, as Planet Earth is part of the Universe– and the Universe needs to survive. How then do we go about taking responsibility for ourselves? Is there a way out of the mess we have made of planet Earth and the danger that we now have become to the rest of Creation?
Some of this will be address in the Epilogue with regard to the future of life here on planet Earth. For now, taking responsibility for everything that goes on in our lives is a good place to start, that includes every decision we make every minute throughout the day. The Universe honors intent, even if sometimes we should fall short.
What has happened in all the other Super Universes and on many planets and areas outside of this partitioned area of Nebadon, is that the beings who reside there have used their Free Will to surrender their Free Will to that of the Higher Will –or Good of All. Again, this surrender does not mean we lose ourselves in some Borg-like manner. Instead it opens us up to the ultimate freedom of experiencing Creation without being attached to our own ego-needs. The secret lies in what the Nine say about going beyond self:
“The beginning of the healing lies with those that have been through self and removed themselves from blocking.”



79
How in all this process of soul, and reincarnation, and rebirthing, and such, does ‘self’ actually manifest into matter? Peter Moon gives us an interesting perspective on this from one of his books about Montauk where he traces the use of a mystical substance known as ‘Occultum’ from its earliest uses in the ancient mysteries, right up to its varied uses today.
“By tracing the spirit through physicality, we see that it emerges in the DNA and the RNA . . . DNA and RNA are the bridge between consciousness and matter. Occultum, which is Latin for ‘hidden’, acts as a superconductor between matter and the life force. It is the gateway to influencing matter by enabling one, under the right circumstances, to consciously enter the atom.
“This is easy to understand if you can imagine an example of the blueprint room for the physical universe. First, the draftsmen made the hydrogen atom with all its specific properties. Next came the helium atom, and thus all the elements in the entire periodic table were filled out. The blueprint room itself represents the creation zone at its highest level. It is also linked to zero time in that this creation zone is outside third dimensional space and time. As the various atoms began to interact in the third dimension, random activity occurred in a spontaneous fashion. Into this mix, the life force began to permeate matter and carry out designated agendas with respect to the various characteristics of life itself.”
Moon also expresses the now commonly accepted idea, expounded by L. Ron Hubbard among others, that there is a trace memory in each cell, and that even atoms themselves have a trace memory that tells their entire history. Therefore, memories of much of what is contained in this book are probably within your cellular memory. This cellular memory can be activated if only one knows how. Unfortunately, life as a whole is mired in physicality and in too many cases has lost its physical memory and any conception of the continuity of self. Aboriginal peoples have life through their ancestry, their history, and the wisdom it imparts to them. Even in the East, ancestral traditions are still kept alive, at least symbolically, even when the original reason for the traditions has long been forgotten. Very few of us in the West know the true reasons why we celebrate certain holidays, why we have certain customs, and why we follow certain norms or patterns in our lives. Ask any history teacher in any school in the West and invariably they will tell you their students always complain and ask why they have to learn history since ‘it has nothing to do with them and the lives they are living today.’ All together we have become a very uncurious bunch of people.
The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad says
“. . . the entire human race is but an aggregation of driven slaves from childhood to old age while cares and anxieties multiply. They wait only for death, and this death is the doorway into the kingdom of heaven. The human race is told by the priests and religious fanatics that death is the mystery. But for the Eckist (the follower of Eckankar) there is no mystery in the phenomena of death for he practices dying daily (through conscious soul-travel techniques)and visiting the heavenly worlds. When the time comes for this phenomena to take place in the Pinda world (physical world), it is found that he can leave the body under his own volition . . . He will be ready to enter into the Kingdom of God, the Ocean of Love and Mercy.”

Chapter 6 -- Seeding from the Stars
Sometimes it seems easier to accept a Creation story like the one we have been following than it is to believe there are aliens who might one day show up on our front doorstep for a visit. Perhaps this is because ‘God’ seems so very far away and so much less personal, while aliens on the other hand could be so very, very close.
Current statistics suggest that more than 57 percent of Americans believe in UFOs, while fifteen percent say they have seen a UFO, and as many as 5 percent say they have been abducted. These figures seem very low after speaking with people from all over the world, and working with abductees for a number of years—abductees who have a completely different figure in mind, something more like 40 to 50 percent!
The one common thread that ties so much of the ancestral mythology of all nations together is the idea that our ancestors came from the stars. This is certainly common knowledge to just about every Native American tribe, and in many other indigenous as well.
In Mali, West Africa, lives a tribe of people called the Dogon. The Dogon are believed to be of Egyptian decent and their astronomical lore goes back thousands of years to 3200 BC. According to their traditions, the star Sirius has a companion star which is invisible to the human eye. This companion star has a 50 year elliptical orbit around the visible Sirius and is extremely heavy. It also rotates on its axis.
This legend might be of little interest to anybody but the two French anthropologists, Marcel Griaule and Germain Dieterlen, who recorded it from four Dogon priests in the 1930's. Of little interest except that it is exactly true. How did a people who lacked any kind of astronomical devices know so much about an invisible star? The star, which scientists call Sirius B, wasn't even photographed until it was done by a large telescope in 1970.
The Dogon stories explain that also, according to their oral traditions, a race of people from the Sirius system called the Nommos visited Earth thousands of years ago. The Nommos were ugly, amphibious beings that resembled mermen and mermaids. They also appear in Babylonian, Accadian, and Sumerian myths. The Egyptian Goddess Isis, who is sometimes depicted as a mermaid, is also linked with the star Sirius.
The Nommos, according to the Dogon legend, lived on a planet that orbits another star in the Sirius system. They landed on Earth in an "ark" that made a spinning decent to the ground with great noise and wind. It was the Nommos that gave the Dogon the knowledge about Sirius B.
Such credible witnesses as former U.S. President Jimmy Carter have admitted on record to having seen a UFO, though he is not the only public figure to have done so. Voice recordings of NASA astronauts publicly available tell how the astronauts have seen UFOs from the space shuttle’s windows. NASA astronauts such as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, Ed White and James McDivitt, James Lovell and Frank Bormann, Walter Schirer, and Gordon Cooper, all testified before the United Nations that UFOs are repeatedly visiting this planet. Russian film footage of their cosmonauts working on the space-station Mir show obvious UFOs circling the area in the background as the cosmonauts do their work.
Ed Mitchell, Apollo astronaut, appeared on Dateline NBC in April, 1996, and indicated that NASA was covering up what really happened at Roswell.



81
There is also evidence to suggest that Cro-Magnon man was doing drawings of UFOs as long as 13,000–30,000 years ago in French and Spanish caves where there were no sources of light at the time.
Prior to 1947 and the Roswell Incident, there had been as many as 1000 books written on the incidence of Unidentified Flying Objects. Medieval paintings of religious figures show flying saucers clearly visible in the background. Since the early 1980s, the number of books on the subject has grown exponentially. Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan is famous for his public comments made in 1987 alluding to an alien threat that would force the feuding countries of the world to pull together in a common act in order to repel hostile invaders. He even concluded one statement in September, 1987 with the rhetorical question, “And yet I ask you, is not an alien threat already among us?”
Until recently, 1997 had been the busiest year yet reported for UFO sightings in South America. And still the military and governments of most countries of the world deny that aliens and UFOs even exist. What purpose does it serve to deny this fact when they are so very obviously real? The Brookings Institute did a special report in 1961 at the request of NASA on what would be the effects of disclosing information about the reality of aliens to the public. The recommendation was a resounding not to do it. The report suggested that such a release of information at that time would cause society as we know it to collapse. But would it? Or is it just that the threat of alien ‘invasion’ could be used against the people as a way of keeping them ‘in line?’
At what time of an adopted or orphaned child’s life should it be appropriate to tell them who their parents really are? Is there any easy way to do it? And what would be the repercussions on those children after being told? This is the scenario we currently face here on planet Earth.
We are not orphans. We are not abandoned or adopted children. We do in fact have parents, and grandparents, and great grandparents, and great, great grandparents as well--and somewhere back along the way, there are at least one or two of our ancestors who really were alien. It is more than probable that there is not just one or two either, but lots of them. That ‘sons of God’ stuff in the Christian Bible, that is a story about us and our beginnings. All of us have had many lifetimes on this planet, and indeed much of this history of the planet and of the universe that we are talking about is simply about us in former lives. Those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And repeat it. And repeat it.
Therefore, when we decide that we want to take a look for the origins and the causes behind our history, the best place to go is deep within ourselves to our own DNA and to our very own cellular memory. Although there are many evolutionary processes at work in the Universe, it is a fact that no human life on this planet has ever evolved from anything other than an intelligent, flesh and blood human, or proto human-like life-form.
Now that this has been said, how does it make you feel? Does it make you feel like society will suddenly collapse around your head? No? The only thing that might collapse is the power structure built on the lies and subversion that have held our history hostage for so long.
I know it will take time before the full implications of this statement to sink in, but somewhere deep inside you, you never could believe that ‘crawling out of a swamp’ stuff anyway. Perhaps the best thing to do would be to take tomorrow off from work to think about the ramifications of



82
this fact and then it will become clearer to you. The best thing to do then would be to set aside time this weekend to rearrange your priorities. But, other than that, your life will go on as usual.
Some of the illusions that you once held may have been brushed away along with the digestion of these facts, but you will only be left with a much clearer vision of who and what you truly are. You will also be a person that is much less likely to be used or controlled by those who are trying to enslave you.
Before you begin this process, however, wait until you have finished reading the rest of this chapter. This is where our history in the lower worlds begins--on this, the most beautiful planet in the Universe. It is a time when the planet is almost devoid of all life-forms other than some evolving animals and vegetation formed by angelic realm beings. Many of these beings are now incarnated on the planet and can remember this time of helping form the new divine matrices which we now can see around us.
The “gods” whom this honeymoon retreat was created for are now absentee landlords, so why let a good thing go to waste?
Oh, there were a few visitors who stopped by every now and again to rest their weary space-legs. Most of these left again after refreshing themselves—perhaps making a pit stop to repair or replenish their craft and their supplies. Some stayed awhile but ultimately perished, the planet at that time still being too hostile an environment for any kind of advanced life form.
The Anasazi were one of the first to come and explore. Knowing their own world was in danger of being destroyed by a passing comet, the Anasazi traveled from their own region which is closer in to the center of the galaxy, out to planet Earth. There purpose was to scout for another planet to colonize. They had no space vehicles as such, but since the vibration of the planet at that time was of a much higher level, or much finer vibration, what we could call a fourth dimensional level, there were other ways to come and go through the universe. Noted western author Louis L’Amour has a story called Haunted Mesa in which he tells about the Anasazi entering and leaving this world through a portal located on top of a mesa in the Four Corners region of Arizona. It is one of his most popular books exactly because it triggers in so many of us those cellular memories of when we too were amongst the Anasazi of that particular time. As any Louis L’Amour aficionado will tell you, the author did a great deal of research on any and all of his subjects and did not work strictly from his very creative imagination.
The Anasazi left, however, after that first visit, finding that the planet was too inhospitable for their needs. It was during this, and subsequent visits though that the Anasazi became a kind of guardian race for planet Earth—and many are now returning at the time of its greatest need. It was in fact, only on the last of their four visits to the planet that the Anasazi found it had settled down sufficiently to the point where it could be a favorable place to live. Their abrupt departure in the 14th century was in fact was occasioned by the opening of the portal through which they needed to leave, and by the continual threat they were under from other warlike tribes.
If they had not left at that time, it would have been more another 2,000 years before they would have again had the chance.
Their history, which is another story from the one we are telling here, is one of advanced spiritual technologies and ideas—continuously hunted by dark-skinned enemies who sought to destroy them and their peace-loving ways. Every Anasazi ruin shows the defensive nature of their



83
way of life.
There are numerous interpretations of the name ‘Anasazi’—however, the one that perhaps rings the truest is “ancient enemy.” This a name which connotes the difference between them and the Native American tribes existing in the area at the same time. Some oral Native American history actually calculates itself in time by the movements of the Anasazi –the movement of the “short peoples” (the average Anasazi being only four and a half feet tall—hence the small rooms and apertures that form the majority of their cliff dwellings).
It is important to note here that so many races of people have, at one time or another, populated the Earth and then disappeared suddenly and mysteriously seemingly into thin air, leaving behind them the remnants of their great cultures. Entire civilizations have just up and, within the span of a single night, left. The best explanations for this that most scientists, archeologists and other so-called experts seem to have are at best weak ones that often ‘do not hold water,’ never being able to explain where these cultures and civilizations moved to.
Keep it in mind, for indeed it is the history of this planet, as well as many others in our universe, that many races have come and gone for many different reasons. We will try and explain the relevant ones for this planet in the brief amount of space and time we have in this book, without losing sight of that which is our first and main intent—the true history of the Darkness and the Light.
Most of the other visitors to the planet found it as inhospitable as the Anasazi did. It was often covered by too much ice or, conversely, too much heat. The strange animal and plant life at the time made it difficult for them to survive. The Els, from whom we get the word ‘elders’, were the first beings to successfully colonize the planet some 15 million years ago. Their civilization grew large and covered many areas of the planet. They were technologically advanced, but still relied heavily on their inner knowingness and spiritual abilities to live. Many of the Els later went underground when a large planet came too close to the Earth and threatened to destroy all life upon it. This was the infamous planet known as Nibiru. Some of the Els went underground where they are still rumored to exist today. Most, however, left.
Brother Philip tells a part of their story in the book Secrets of the Andes. Their story gives us a better idea of how many planets were started through some type of colonization, just as modern days areas of Earth were also colonized when adventurers from France, England, Spain, and Portugal, roamed the world in search of new lands to bring into their country’s fold.
“After the Earth had cooled, and was ready for inhabitants, a race arrived from out of space that was not human, but was of the race of original true man. They were called Cyclopeans, and are known in the secret arcane knowledge as the ‘L’ Race or simply, the ‘Els’. Before coming to the Earth planet they traversed space following all the great cycles of Time; they were Titans who rode the starways and sought always the best pastures of space for their flock. They were the first life upon the Earth and are the Immortals of our legends, the God Race or Elder Race that preceded man. . .They were about twelve feet tall and were male and female, but not as we think of sex differentiation today. Before coming to Earth they had colonized much of what is known today as the Milky Way Galaxy; thousands of suns and worlds came under their influence.”
Brother Philip also makes the astute observation that Earth has had many civilizations and, when one has gone to ‘the bottomless pit’, another one rises, only to see that one drop to the



84
bottomless pit as well. This, he says, is an error of the Earth, for on Venus there has never been such a destruction of a civilization. And on the planet we know as Mars it has occurred only twice, although obviously quite catastrophically. But how many hundreds of times has it taken place here on Earth?
After the many comings and goings of these civilizations, their rise and their fall, a history that is too far back in the dim mists of time for us to even worry about here, it was decided by members of the local spiritual hierarchy to use the planet for an experiment. This was to be an experiment in the blending together of the many and varied universal civilization types. Although this kind of work had been done before with some kind of success, that on planet Earth was to be a blending on a far greater scale than had ever been tried before.
Initially the idea was to take a life-form from one civilization, plant some of them on the planet, and then let them acclimatize. At periodic times after that, genetic factors from other civilizations on other star systems would be added to this original group either through reproductive intervention or a mating with the species. If this sounds very much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, you will begin to understand how creative people are fed ideas from out of their deepest inner resources in order to bring truth to Light.
As the Council of Nine put it:
“The origins of humankind did not evolve from animals, or from Earth matter. There was one group which emerged by itself – all others were colonized and merged to create a new species.”
In tracing the vertical evolutionary record contained in human and other genomes, scientists ran into an enigma when they found that the human genome contains 223 genes that do not have the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. Starseeding is the true and only explanation for these genes without identifiable predecessors.
Even star systems such as the Pleiades were seeded just as was planet Earth. It is called ‘starseeding’, and it is a basic tool of the Universe to get evolution going and keep it going. It is also a process used to speed up the process. As was said before, however, nothing on the scale of what was to be tried on Earth had ever been attempted before.
“We do not interfere in the civilizations. Those twenty-four civilizations join with us to bring about the plan for Planet Earth that was conceived by all of us in the beginning. In truth the Council and the Twenty-Four developed and created what was necessary on Planet Earth in order for humanity to live on it, when it was ready. We continue to work with this, but our wish is that you humans will now take responsibility for your own planet.”
The initial attempts were to ‘test the waters’ so to speak. The metaphor the Nine use is that, like any good gardener, if you are unsure of your soil, you will plant many types of species. The kinds you initially plant are the kinds you most want to be the main structure of your garden, and to see which of those will survive. Then you arrange and cultivate, and look to see what is working and what is not. Then you do a little grafting, a little cross-hybridization, and see if you can come up with that perfect show piece that will take top honors at the next bi-annual fair. That, too, is how Planet Earth was arranged.
To give you a background with which to work, and to orient your time clock in as short amount of space as we can, we have included a brief rundown of the human population on the Earth as it is currently written about in most of the scientific textbooks in schools:



85
• First came the creature known as Ramapithecus. Living 15-20 million years ago, it was a tree dwelling simple tool-user without visible ancestors or descendants.
• About the same time was Australopithecus, a creature also living 15-20 million years ago, but one which mysteriously died out.
• In 1946, the huge bones of Gigantopithecus were discovered and dated back to nearly 10 million years ago. Gigantopithecus, sounding much like what Brother Philip describes as the Els, stood more than 8 feet tall and weighed 400 to 500 pounds. In the 1940s, Gigantopithecus was thought to be a good candidate for a missing link; but, like Ramapithecus, it is now thought to be ‘an evolutionary side branch’.
The fossils of Gigantopithecus and Ramapithecus, if not human ancestors, were supposedly contemporary with our true ancestor. These primates were indeed giants and dwarfs, and some lived earlier than 10 million years ago, the time in which Edgar Cayce says human beings first appeared on Earth. These were not anatomically modern people; our ancestors likely though did have “tails,” just as there are incidences of children still being born with tails today.
• Homo Habilis came around 3,500,000 years ago. He was an upright, tool-using, hunting, home-dwelling being who looked much like proto-humans (proto as in prototypes), although definite ancestral links to us have not yet been established.
• Homo Erectus came roughly between 750,000 and 250,000 years ago. He was a stone-axe user, a fire-kindler and a hut-builder, with a brain somewhat comparable to ours. The females no longer went ‘on heat’ (oestrus), and offspring went through a much more prolonged infancy. Cultural growth was beginning and signs of humanity were evident.
• There is no demonstrated relationship between Homo Erectus and Neanderthal Man--Homo Neanderthalis, who appeared about 300,000 years ago, wearing clothes, practicing ritual burials and warfare, but who mysteriously and quickly disappeared as well some 35,000 years ago. The Neanderthals displayed virtually no technological innovation during more than 100,000 years of their existence on the planet. They just disappeared. They didn’t interbreed, nor were they killed off by the Cro-Magnons. Modern humans are not descended from Neanderthals, but co-existed with them about 40,000 years ago, according to the latest scientific research just recently released.
In Marlo Morgan’s book Mutant Message Down Under, it is the white men who are called Mutants –because they were interbred with other races, and away from the “Ab-original.” In ancient Egypt, the ‘Ab’ referred to that part of the person known as the ‘heart’—therefore the Aboriginals can rightfully be called ‘the original hearts’ of the planet.
An analysis of DNA extracted from the ribs of a 29,000 year-old Neanderthal infant buried in a cave in southern Russia showed that it was too distinct to be related to humans. Although they evidently co-existed, no evidence of genetic material being passed from Neanderthals to modern humans can be found. The study of DNA taken from the first Neanderthal skeleton found in the Feldhofer Cave in Germany in 1856 supports the theory that modern humans in fact replaced Neanderthals. The DNA sequence from the infant was very similar to the specimen from the



86
Feldhofer Cave as well, suggesting both to be genuinely Neanderthals, and that there was little diversity among them. DNA comparisons also showed that different ethnic groups have no proven links to any of the Neanderthals known.
The Nine say that the Neanderthals were a species evolved from the planet Earth, but even they were “remnants of groups that had once come before.” Of course, the slowness and lack of progression of the Neanderthals over 100,000 years tends to put a damper on evolutionary theory considering how much progress modern man has made in as short a time as the past 3,000 years.
The Nine also say that the Cro-Magnon’s were from another race which then merged with other species who had survived, later merging again to bring humans to a more elevated state.
“The Neanderthals were not the beginning of humankind. . . their first appearance was in the Tarim basin in Aksu.”
• There is no demonstrated relationship between the Neanderthals and those who also came to share space with them for a few millennia: Homo Sapiens Sapiens (Human the Wise). These were anatomically modern folk who appeared seemingly out of nowhere, leaving remnants all the way from Europe to Australia. They were a people who had sculpture, musical instruments, lamps, trade, and innovations such as objects of symbolic significance communicated through visual images.
Palden Jenkins commentary in The Only Planet of Choice makes light of the obvious questions left by science’s haphazard explanation of human life on this planet:
“After an evolutionary struggle lasting millions of years, our species emerged as top hominid. And then, in one spectacular moment, we became human. As recently as 35,000 years ago, western Europe was still occupied by Neanderthals, primitive beings for whom art and progress scarcely existed. Then there was an abrupt change. Anatomically modern people appeared in Europe, and suddenly so did sculpture, musical instruments, lamps, trade and innovation. Within a few thousand years Neanderthals were gone. Insofar as there was any single moment when we could be said to become human, it was at the time of this great leap forward some 35,000 years ago.”
Jenkin’s conclusion is that scientific theories seem to rely heavily for their continued survival “on the implicit lack of interest” most people show in the subject, and a willingness to leave the question to “experts.” A seemingly very uncurious bunch, aren’t we?
Most of the world’s different races and major culture language groups have come into place only since about 10, 000 BC. Even Egyptian civilization suddenly seemed to appear all at once, and almost fully developed, somewhere in the fourth millennium BC. Egypt moved straight from a stage of pre-civilization to the government of large areas without the usual era of city states intervening. The ordinary logic of historical development does not seem to apply to Egypt.
The Nine say that Soul first came to the planet when reasoning began with the assembling of tools and with the forming of a method of communication, but others in the Universal spiritual hierarchy tend to suggest it is much further back than we think. They are not disagreeing, it is only that the higher you go, the bigger the picture one can see.
“. . . We learn too,” say the Nine.



87
That is why we must take a look at the starseeding done by the twenty-four Universal civilizations which took place in Aksu, as well as that which occurred in the great empires of Lemuria and Atlantis--civilizations which were colonized from other planets, in order to get a better feel for our own history. Lemuria and Atlantis we shall deal with in the forthcoming chapters. Aksu shall be dealt with now.
Before we begin, it must be mentioned first that prior to any of these more famous civilizations there were the races known as the Polarans and the Hyperboreans –both in varying stages of corporeality. When you start to go back too far into our history you begin to talk about a different level of existence from that which we now currently know and can imagine. In as much, therefore, these races are not a direct part of the Tree of Life we are tracing in this book. Just know that, after the Els, and as far back as four million years ago, there were great civilizations upon the planet which rose and then fell, leaving behind no trace of themselves due to the major physical changes which have occurred on the planet since that time. The only memory of them exists in the various myths and legends from around the world, and in the Akashic Records of the planet. Some psychically aware people are able to tap into these records, but always be aware of the level of the source from which this information comes.
The original beings that evolved on the planet then was from remnants of former colonies. These are what we would call the black race. Blacks actually evolved on all the landmasses of the Earth, and even in China the remains of Negroid ancestors have been found. At one time in Africa, the fierce black Varkas Kings had a great empire and ruled with an iron-fist all the lands south of the Mediterranean Sea. A book called The Golden Kingdom tells a wonderful excerpt from their story, and is a worthwhile companion to this history.
The Orientals, the white race or Aryans, and the Native American Indians, have all been the results of colonization from other civilizations in the universe. They are the results of the breeding of the civilizations upon planet Earth, but the Native Americans are the only ones to openly acknowledge their ancestry in the stars.
When UFO activity was at its peak in the 1950s, a holy man of the Cheyenne River reservation of South Dakota named Blue Hair was asked “what are these that travel around but do not stay in one place long enough, nor avail themselves to be seen.” Blue Hair told the listeners after a special ceremony that they are “our relatives,” and that they will come again from time to time “as they have in the past.”
When we speak of the red, the yellow, and the white races, they were all descendants from colonization occurring from other civilizations. This all took place many thousands of years ago. This is not the same colonization from the higher civilizations which began around 32,400 BC as explained in The Only Planet of Choice.
If you begin to see a pattern here in why perhaps the different races don’t get along with each other here on planet Earth, then you will start to recognize some of the negative effects of this experimentation brought to the planet by the Universal Civilizations. Interplanetary wars are not an uncommon thing in this area of the universe, and ‘racial’ hatred is a not an Earth-born
thing alone. Some planets are, indeed, very, very war-like, and also very arrogant. They take their planetary prejudices with them in their genetic codes, and this in turn comes out in many of us who are more directly related to these various star ancestors.
Racial purity is also not a new concept, and many of the wars taking place on Earth today



88
are simply reflections of the ‘tribal wars’ which have to do with this kind of racial purity and ethnic cleansing on other planets. Lines drawn on maps cannot classify a person as to their ethnic background, nor indeed can they cover up the inherited planetary and racial prejudices bred into us from our ancestral roots in the stars.
According to Clow, history on Earth has been nothing more than the projection of fear:
“. . . the experience of the original people of Earth has been continuously and extensively influenced by visitors from other realms. As you struggle to remember who you originally were, your meetings with those who have changed you will be part of the critical process of regaining your identity. Your teachers from Nibiru and other alien cosmic sources have been so interwoven with the natural evolution of Earth that it is very difficult to remember the original resonance of the Earth or of yourself.”
Part of this grand Earth experiment was to see in what manner the original race that was not seeded would evolve in comparison with those that colonized. Those that colonized, after a period of time, because they came from civilizations that had perhaps more technology or different kinds of developed intelligence, often began to feel that they were superior to the native races who they saw as inferior because they had evolved more from this planet than the others. Often, too, these colonizers contrived to dominate the blacks and their homelands as well. The remnants of this attitude can still be seen in society at-large today.
The experiment of the Twenty-Four Universal civilizations began as recently as 32,000 BC, which coincidentally corresponds very nicely with that 35,000 BC jump in the evolutionary ladder referred to earlier in this chapter. By that time the ‘seeds’ these civilizations had planted had evolved into human beings who were ready to receive new energies for the uplifting of the species. In an article entitled A Galactic Exchange Univer-city, co-authored by James Gilliland and John Novak, the authors speak about their impressions of the ‘benevolent’ aliens with which they have had contact in Oregon, sounding very much like representatives of the Twenty-Four Civilizations:
“. . . These benevolent beings have an omnipresent understanding of God that transcends the need to separate into structured truths with names, images and dogma. This is one of the main problems causing the fear, separation, division and war now plaguing Humanity and the Earth. They have found it is better to honor diversity and choose the Universal principles and understandings within each culture that are necessary for a healthy society and environment. Principles that support Universal Peace, Brother/Sisterly Love, Individual Freedom and Prosperity for all and service to the Creator within all Creation.
“These understandings, given to our forefather/mothers, were inspired by great overseers in the past and are the basic foundations for all religions today. Unfortunately, these basic truths have long since been altered by kings, governments and religious institutions that still dominate the social consciousness of Earth today. They do this by keeping people in fear, ignorance and dependent upon them for the basic life necessities of food, water, shelter, clothing, medicine and transportation.”
After the seeding, what was planned for the planet Earth did not come to pass, however. As the Nine tell it, it was discovered by the civilizations that, of all the planets in the Universe, Earth was the only planet that has such beauty, such diversity of changes, but also has such density-



89
more than any other planet in the Universe. It was discovered that those who existed upon planet Earth had a great “physicalness and sexuality” that was not present on any of the other planets. Like all the other Souls who have incarnated here for one reason or another, the colonists, having a higher vibration and coming from planets with lesser densities, found the Earth’s density too difficult to overcome. This caused them to get trapped in their desire for physicalness, so they too began to repeatedly reincarnate on planet Earth.
“It was not meant to be that way,” say the Nine. “That is where the great imbalance on this planet comes from. This is the problem in your physical world: there is too much involvement in the releasing of energy, rather than in refining energy. . . it was a form of masturbation that seeded the Earth.”
Instead of helping cure the problems of planet Earth, the colonists only served to add more fuel to the fire.
Those who were in the Southern hemisphere did not get as much of the influence of the other civilizations to assist them in their evolutionary process. Because of landmass changes which had occurred prior to this time, the continents of the Southern hemisphere were much more difficult to get too, just as they are today. The Northern hemisphere, on the other hand, had a much greater settlement area, and was much easier to get around, especially when you consider the presence of a smaller yet still substantial Atlantis stuck squarely in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Then around 32,400 BC, a small number of representatives of the civilizations came to mingle with those who had already been seeded upon the planet. They arrived in a place the Nine call Aksu, located in the Tarim Basin in Central Asia, 350km SE of Alma Ata, Khazakstan, in what is now Xinjiang or Sinkiang province under the Tien Shan mountains. The arrival of these beings changed the stakes, however, by infusing new DNA coding into humanity, a DNA which we shall see later was far different from that which we now possess today.
The others who were here on the planet at the time were in simple societies, and there was a mixing of genes with them as well. Besides the evolving black race, the starseeds, and the colonizers, there were also others on the planet at that time who were outcasts from other planets. Just as Australia had started out as a penal colony for those deemed unfit for polite society in 18th century England, so to at times was Earth a dumping ground for those considered unwanted by the civilizations on their home planets.
This first mixing of genes in 32,400 BC did not work, however, because it was too soon. The starseeds had not yet progressed far enough by this time to assimilate the genetic changes in consciousness. According to the Nine, “their minds and the souls of the spirits were too dense. It was a high civilization, not properly adapted to Planet Earth.”
The new arrivals tried to give the original starseeds language–an alphabet which had no vowels, much as the Hebrew language has today. Before these star-beings had come to Aksu, the people spoke in grunts and gungs, so the star-beings taught them a toning language, a language that imitates the sounds of nature, and is the language of the universe, much as the toning sounds were used to communicate with alien beings in the final scenes of the movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind.



90
Some of these star-beings stayed and tried to make it work, but after about 600 years things fell apart. Because there were no connections between the groups moving out from the central core area, confusion reigned, and they became involved in local developments, often merging with the peoples of those new areas. Therefore, there was a loss of memory and a reverting back to a more simple state of development. This then necessitated the re-enhancement of their genetics within a period of about 500 years (the Anasazi culture of the American Southwest suffered many such similar problems in trying to keep in touch with the outlying areas from the hub of their civilization at Chaco Canyon, NM).
Culture thus began to degenerate after initially flowering. The ability of the DNA to maintain itself lessened after being watered down in the genetic pool and through basic lifestyle choices.
About this time, the last great Ice Age was winding down and things on the planet were beginning to warm up. Three different groups dispersed in three different directions from Aksu. Some went to China. In Aksu there were people with mixed strains and people with pure strains. Some were mixed with different Civilizations of the Twenty-Four, and some were just mixed with the locals.
It was in this period between 5,000 BC and 6,000 BC that a larger group came from the Twenty-Four Civilizations to attempt to elevate the consciousness of the planet again. The problem with the beings that existed on the planet this time was that instead of welcoming the visitors as brothers, they instead worshipped them, much as they worshipped the other alien beings who had been on the planet prior to the time of the Great Flood. These alien races we shall deal with more in the coming chapters.
The Nine say that the realization that sent the representatives of the Civilizations back here at that time was that if they waited for humankind to evolve of its own accord, it would still be in its own state of six toes (a common petroglyph at many ancient sites), that which was considered to be a primitive state of development.
In the Bible, David’s nephew slays a son of Goliath (the Philistines supposedly being 8-10 ft tall) who had “on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes.” (2 Samuel 21:15-22)
What the Twenty-Four Civilizations were trying to do was to spread evolution and civilization through the ‘100th Monkey technique’, what they got instead was worship.
This time, their representatives decided to share with the people the idea of communal development. Some offshoots of the group went to China, what is now and seemingly always has been, a great communal country.
The effect had by the presence of the other alien beings on the planet at this time caused great dissension and confusion amongst the relatively primitive earthlings, especially after the incident known as the Tower of Babel. Everyone, indeed, was babbling like a non-human. It was therefore necessary for the Civilizations to re-seed again.
What needs to be understood here is that when there is a separation of people, by long distances or by long periods of time, there is also a loss of knowledge when there is not a group



91
with whom to share that knowledge. It therefore becomes lost to future generations.
The Native Americans have kept their legends and ancient knowledge precisely because of this fact. They have worked hard to maintain their ways and their traditions by repeating that knowledge over and over again at tribal ceremonies, precisely as it was handed down to them in the beginning. The old Hopi prophecy that a "Day of Purification" was soon to arrive has survived this long just because of these forms of oral and ceremonial tradition, along with the pictographic representation of the events as carved into stone:
“The Day of Purification . . . It would be a day when all wicked people and wrong-doers would be punished or destroyed . . . We believe other planets are inhabited and that our prayers are heard there. . . The arrow on which the dome-shaped object rests, stands for travel through space," Katchongva said in explaining the rock carving. "The Hopi maiden on the dome-shape (drawing) represents purity. Those Hopi who survive Purification Day will travel to other planets. We, the faithful Hopi, have seen the ships and know they are true . . . " (Kimball)
So once again there was a need for more genetic engineering to be performed on the central group of seeded inhabitants. Many of the legends and mythology of Ancient Greece and their gods, those such as told about Atlas and Zeus, came from this exact time when the people saw alien beings landing in strange craft and doing miraculous things with technology they didn’t understand. These strange things they translated into images using the only language they knew. Any kind of alien from a spaceship became “an angel or winged messenger.” And the spacecraft themselves became “chariots of fire,” just as modern-day UFO researcher Erich Von Daniken first deciphered them.
One of the major starseeding influences came from the beings sent from the Pleiades, one of our closer neighbors in the Universe, the group of stars known as the “Seven Sisters.” Many of these ancient legends refer to the Pleiadeans, in terms that the people of those days could understand especially when they involve a bull--the Pleiades being in the constellation of Taurus, the bull. These legends and their truth in origin, has had incalculable influence upon our civilization, legends such as this one:
Europa and Her Kin Jupiter was the chief figure in one romantic episode, which brought in its train a number of important events and consequences.
Europa was a princess of Asia, the daughter of the king of Phoenicia. She shone preeminent among her attendant maidens as Venus did among the Graces. The son of Cronus beheld her, and he fell in love with her. He wooed Europa in the fashion of a bull (Taurian, lovely and mighty to behold). He came into the flowering meadow where Europa disported herself with her maidens, and when the rest fled, he cast his spell on the princess so that she was not afraid. She approached him and he lowed gently, and he bowed himself before her feet and showed her his broad back. Smiling, she was tempted, and sat down upon the back of the bull; and scarcely was she seated, when he rose from the ground, moved towards the neighboring seashore, and leaped into the waves.
In vain she called to have her companions, in vain she implored the seemingly gentle bull to return to dry land and to permit her to escape. Over the sea, suddenly smooth before him, he swam with powerful strokes, and never a wavelet wet the hem of the maiden’s garments. Around



92
him gamboled the monsters of the sea, and bevies of sea nymphs rose from the waves and greeted him joyously.
Wither do you bear me?” at last the maiden cried in awe; and the bull answered her in deep, immortal tones, bidding her to be courageous.
“Behold, I am Jupiter,” he said, “and love of you has compelled me to wear this semblance. But Crete shall presently receive us and shall be our bridal chamber—Crete where I myself was born.”
So he said, and so it was; and from this princess Europa it was that the whole continent received it’s name. Three sons were born to Europa—Minos, later king of Crete, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon. The two former after their death became judges of the shades in the underworld (perhaps underworld aliens).
All of these legends involve flying and ‘immortal acts’ done by heavenly creatures with amazing technology and superhuman abilities. They were not the products of fertile minds, but rather the translations of amazing events done by simpler minds than ours. In this case, Jupiter was a god who was “wheresoever you look, wheresoever you move.”
As the Nine describe it, the Pleiadeans are our actual biological ancestors, and are very much a part of our family. A lot of people on the planet feel drawn to the Pleiades for exactly this same reason, and hold very close feelings for these beings and this star system. Most Native American tribes point to the Pleiades as the home from which their ancestors came. There are also many legends revolving around the Pleiades in numerous other cultures from around the planet. The Balinese and the people of Tana Toraja (in Indonesia), both say they came from the Pleiades. Their houses, resembling long boats, are symbolic of the ships that the ancestors from the Pleiades arrived in long ago.
As stated earlier, the Pleiades were also a seeded planet, one which had a little more success because of its finer vibration and the level of its people’s existence on a higher dimension. It is now a civilization which exists almost solely to provide seed help, as well as technical and biological intervention on other planets.
Randolph Winters, in his book The Pleiadean Mission: A Time of Awareness, shares some of the history and qualities common to Pleiadeans, and sheds some extra light on the ancestry of other planets:
“The Pleiadeans and their ancient ancestors called Lyrans, have been aware of our planet for more than 22 million years, but this was the first time that they had come to Earth, to observe and become involved with us. They could have come at any time, but it was clear to them that our civilization was beginning to develop, and that an important time was coming which would lead to great change here on Earth.
“The ability to project thoughts to another place on the planet is very common and is the socially accepted method of visiting. Telepathy, the ability to communicate by thought, is practiced by most of the population. Devices such as phones are non-existent. Try for a moment to envision what life would be like if everyone on the planet were contributing part of their thought energy to a common pool that was used to protect the health and well-being of the planet, the animal kingdom, the food, and the health of all inhabitants. There would be no greed, hate, anger, or negative thinking, but only true understanding and love among everyone.



93
“Even though most communication is mental, there is till a tube type of system to travel around the planet. You can travel to almost anywhere on the planet in a very short time. This tube system is mostly above ground and available to everyone. When you are riding in the tube, there is no sensation of movement because the problems of gravity and energy have long been overcome by Pleiadean science. The tube cars are something like our monorail systems on Earth, but are far more advanced and intelligent. As with other structures on Erra, the tubes can think and carry on a conversation with you about your destination, and answer any questions you may have about the scenery or topography of the planet (more primitive tubes such as these were also used on Earth by the Anasazi to travel on the long straight roads they built, having no wheels as such).
“. . . Because of this, everyone is able to share in the resources of their world in accordance . with their contribution, without the fear of greed and power. This has made their life more pleasurable, and creates an environment where the quality of life is considerably higher.
“. . . . Divorce is not allowed because they feel this is an offense against the Laws of Creation. If the marriage laws are broken, the partners are exiled from the planet, but this rarely happens ((how do you get exiled prisoners)) They believe in many kinds of love, especially in friendship and marriage which are very closely related, as well as the love of all creatures.”
“If you are beginning to feel a little lost, perhaps it is time for a quick lesson in genetics.”
The Old Stone-age Neanderthalers were so physically unlike modern humans that we could not possibly have evolved from them in terms of our genetics in such a short period of time. They were even mentally quite different, as determined from a skull shape affording little room for thinking and speaking parts of the brain. Thus they were no missing link. There was also no separation between Neanderthals and Cro-magnons, but they were both totally different genetically and their cultures remarkably dissimilar. Cro-magnons showed sophisticated art, clothing, habitation and general lifestyle, yet somewhere between 30,000-35,000 BC they did exist as contemporaries. It is through genetic testing done in 1997 that proof was finally achieved that modern humans (homo sapiens sapiens) had not the slightest trace of ancestry from even the Cro-magnons. Similar testing found that Homo Erectus dated back to only 40,000 years ago in Java, rather than having died out 200,000 years ago as originally thought.
None of these forerunners evolved from each other either. They all seem to possess singular characteristics unrelated to the others, meaning that their genetics evolved separately from one another. Then, too, some mysteriously died out while others survived. This logically suggests the garden concept expressed by the Council of Nine that you plant many different kinds of seed in new soil to see which one will survive and will flourish.
You see, as the Nine explain it, only about 5% of the DNA within each cell is used in constructing a physical body. The remainder concerns information including race or archetypal memory, psychological factors such as collective consciousness, and other streams of energies. It is, in a way, the hard drive storage for all the lifetimes of our ancestors who have added their genes in order to create ours. It is also the container for various elements of cosmic knowledge, and especially for the secrets regarding the cosmic connection of man to his Creator. Do not be fooled by modern day experimenters in genetics and the supposedly worthwhile goals they say



94
they are seeking. As we shall see, much of what is happening today with regard to genetic manipulation has already gone on before in Atlantis and other places, and with often disastrous repercussions that we are still trying to cope with today.
During upgradings in our genetics such as those the Civilizations have done, genes have been introduced which have physically adapted the brain and intelligence hormones. This is kind of like upgrading a computer’s memory capacity and processing ability. The information brought to the Earth seeds then was not only verbally transmitted through ideas and information, but also genetically encoded into our DNA and transmitted through procreation between the inhabitants and these off-world star beings. Genetics is one of the major factors we, in truth, are following in our quest for understanding the Tree of Life as it has been seeded on the planet, been hybridized throughout the millennia, and even today is being manipulated by power-seeking groups for the purpose of control.
The biggest problem with genetics is that this pool of genes we carry within us, which on the one hand can be upgraded by the adding fresh influences from other races, can also deteriorate if left too long without other fresh additions. Interbreeding within a group for too long can actually create great problems in the humans that it creates, mostly by concentrating certain traits to the exclusion of all others.
The Grays, the infamous group of aliens who are blamed for many of the abductions on the planet, are said to be a dying race who are trying to use genes from those they abduct to reinvigorate their own genetic pool. Unfortunately, it seems as if the human-Gray hybrids that have been created have lacked that vital quality which allows Soul to embrace the new form, and inhabit the physical structure.
There is, indeed, great difficulty involved with the workings of genetic manipulation. The FATHER’s Creation does not allow for change very easily, as the Grays and even the TwentyFour have found out over a long period of time. Those that have been successful need to understand the light coding that allows genes to fuse effectively, as talked about in The Pleiadean Agenda.
Many of the diseases known to humanity were caused by genetic factors originally brought about by the mixing of the various races. Some were from genetic factors inherent in one group from a particular star system which then did not intermarry well with the genetics of others from another planet. This is evident in the diseases particular to certain races of people.
Is it starting to make sense now why there are so many different blood types on the planet? So many different types of digestive system? So many different types of metabolism—some for vegetarians, some for meat eaters, and so on?
Not only did we inherit the benefits of the new genetic factors in this mixing, but we also inherited many of the problems, attitudes, and ‘physical’ attributes associated with beings from the various planets, as we shall see here in the story of the Aryan race of people.
The Aryan Branch
One group of starseeds that has been responsible for much of the confusion and disruption



95
on this planet are the Aryans. As Peter Moon describes their history, they come from the star Aldebaran, a star which has two planets forming the Sumeran Empire.
“The population of Sumeran was divided into two classes. First there was the Aryan or master race. Additionally there was a subservient race which had developed in a negative fashion as a result of mutation from climatic changes. As both populations began to expand, there were problems because of racial intermixing. The people became dull and the technology for space travel was lost.”
In spite of this racist undertone, we are told that there was no racism in the Sumeran Empire and that the different peoples respected each other. The Aldebarans, or Aryans, were at one time able to travel to other stars. They were, in fact, migrants to this area of the universe, first settling on Mars and Maldek, the planet whose remnants now make up the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This planet was a part of the original Luciferian wars, as they are called. A major war took place between these two planets, leaving one a large, lifeless, chunk of rock floating in space, and the other, shattered into millions of smaller chunks floating out in space.
There is a great lesson here to be learned by people on planet Earth, for many of us were on these planets at the time they were destroyed. We need therefore to remember the lessons involved in this war and not let it happen again here.
The surfaces of Mercury, Mars, and several satellites of the planets (including Earth’s moon) show the effects of the intense bombardment by fragments from this destruction. On Earth that record has eroded away, except for a few recently found impact craters.
All the Darkness which has arisen from the foundation of humankind on this planet has not all been totally Lucifer’s fault, believe it or not. Certainly over the past 50,000 years, however, his focus has been on this planet and controlling its people, thereby gaining control over it’s role as a melting-pot and spiritual balancing point for the Universe. The planet Maldek was destroyed in as much because it would not surrender totally to his control. The Martian planet was decimated and all atmospheric possibilities for life to exist upon the planet surface again, were destroyed in this very same battle. This was approximately 100,000 years ago.
There were many of these ‘Aryans’ and others who escaped to Earth at the time of the destruction of Maldek, during the earliest phases of the Galactic or Luciferian wars. Their memories are very strong with regard to what happened there, and indeed the planet Aldebran which is destroyed by the Death Star of the Dark Side in the original Star Wars film, is an archetype of this planet Maldek. So it is with Solara’s memories in her book, El:An:Ra: The Healing of Orion:
“Maybe she could liberate some of the small planets they had invaded if they were willing to join the fight against the OMNI. Too bad that AAlar-dar wouldn’t join his forces with hers, surely overthrowing the Dark Lords would be serving good. Maybe when he saw her strength and power, he would bring the Intergalactic Confederation to help. But, she knew that she couldn’t count on him. Besides, there was always the possibility that he would try to stop her.
“Kurtala’s mind was made up. She vowed to destroy the OMNI, whatever it took. Even if



96
she now had two formidable opponents, both AAla-dar and the Dark Lords, she was not frightened. Rushing from her quarters, she made haste to prepare for the horrible times to come.
“And thus the stage was set for the intergalactic wars.”
The Aldebarans or Aryans have played a significant role on in the troubles here on this planet. They were a small minority of people who escaped to the planet and unduly influenced others to accept their beliefs and the memories of their home planet and what was happening there. The translation of the stories they told were taken at face value as a lesson in race mixing, when, as it has been correctly said, there was no racism on their home planet between the two different races. At a time of desired mixing of races on this planet, their stories were something that influenced other races such as the Hebrew or Hoovid race which came from the Twenty-Four Civilizations, and convinced them not to interbreed.
This was a devastating blow to the original plans for this experiment on planet Earth. Its success rested on mixing the best of all the races to form one new and even more superior race, balanced in all or many of its aspects by a deep love of its heritage from the many races from which it had been formed. As this was the first time this experiment of mixing so many bloods together had been attempted, the interference of other alien beings on the planet at the time was unfortunate. In a Universe based on Free Will, however, it was also unavoidable. It was “a monkeywrench” thrown into the works which eventually jammed up the gears of the overall experiment.
The Aldebarans or Aryans were in particular known for their intellectual ability. Unfortunately they also brought with them this piece of their history which has now formed an archetype within people heavily influenced by their bloodline. This characteristic of the Aryans is what has created much of the anxiety centered around the separation of the races that has plagued nations such as Australia, the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and certainly South Africa, almost since their inception. Most of all it has brought itself forward in the teachings of the Teutonic race and eventually caused the slaughter of many millions when the archetype was successfully used by Hitler as an appeal to racial purity, and a reason to destroy the Jews, as well as many others.
The Jewish Branch
It must be remembered here that when the Nine speak of ‘civilizations’ they are speaking also of levels of consciousness. Any particular group of people or beings will have a certain group consciousness formed by the simple communal linkage of their thoughts. This is because we are all connected together as a small individual piece of that much greater entity known as Soul. This is the origin of the Native American saying, ‘We are all Brothers’ (not, we are all one).
Any school class will have a certain group consciousness. So will any city, or even suburb of that city. Any state will also have a certain group consciousness, any country, and certainly any planet. This is the generalized consciousness of the people themselves as the group who inhabit a certain planet such as Earth. It should not be confused with the consciousness of the planet itself, which on Earth is known as ‘Gaia’.
This consciousness will usually manifest itself in a predilection for certain abilities associated with the mind or the emotions, and will therefore give rise to certain abilities in the fields of



97
science, the creative arts, music, or even physical prowess.
As well as existing at different dimensional levels in the Universe, each of the Twenty-Four civilizations also have different levels of consciousness. All are not perfect, all are still evolving in their own way, and many have difficulties of their own to deal with, although none quite as bad as those we have here on Earth. We have, indeed, inherited the problems of the Universe along with our genetic mixing. As such, we have become a central focus for the healing of the Universe—a microcosm for the larger macrocosm. We not only have all the positive attributes of all of our interplanetary parents, but also all the negative ones. Thus we truly are the microcosm of all.
“In the beginning, all civilizations were equal. Yet each of them worked primarily with different levels and in different arenas, and the civilization in the level that was most influential became the most predominant civilization.”
Humans ‘abducted’ by aliens will often talk about seeing the various races of aliens working together onboard ships where they are taken. These various aliens don’t always seem happy about the fact of working together—but at least they are cooperating on things. It is much like a group of nations operating together here on Earth, each one wanting to participate, yet each one wanting to retain its own sovereignty ad individuality as well.
The planetary civilization known as Hoova is the one that brought forth the nation of the Hebrews. They were one of the original civilizations that seeded planet Earth in very ancient times, and therefore rightfully can be referred to as ‘the chosen people’ in one small unimportant sense. Others came too, but Hoova re-seeded the planet Earth on three separate occasions, hence the relative importance of the Hebrews to Earth’s history. The last time they came to the planet Earth for this, according to the Nine, was in the time of Sumer.
Hoova itself is a planet 16,000 times the size of planet Earth. It has a population of approximately only five million inhabitants. This means that family and group ties are very important there because of the sparseness of their populated areas. Comparatively, Altea, another one of the planets inhabited by a member of the Twenty-Four Civilizations is only 52 times larger than Earth. Because of the different speed of time in the finer vibration in which Hoova exists, a Hoovid would live approximately one million of our Earth years.
The Hoovids are a smaller race, with dark skin, and usually straight dark hair. While Hoovids have vocal ability such as we do here on Earth, Alteans on the other hand do not have vocal chords, but rely rather on telepathic abilities to communicate, much as was previously discussed about the Pleiadeans.
In terms of the sexes Hoovids have what is known as a tri-polarity gender, similar to what one might think of as the male/female/neutral blend inherent in the FATHER. Alteans are of two polarities, blended in togetherness. Hence the uniqueness of the sexual reproduction and mating customs of Earthlings, and of the great desire to reunite the two. This desire for physical union can even cause unbalance in beings from other planets and dimensions coming to the planet much like it does with the people already here.
Gregg Braden refers to this and its relationship to what is happening with the current



98
planetary changes:
“. . Even as seeds, many have become “lost” in the density of the earth experience and are just developing a new sense of identity. As the memory returns, the constructs of their lives may appear to make less sense; careers, relationships and even commitments made prior to the wake up, may not feel harmonious with the codes being activated from within; the patterns simply will no longer “fit.” For those individuals, their path will lead them through the doorway of experience that brings them to the threshold of resolving those feelings, facing the fears and coming to terms with the emotion of what has come to pass. Even now they are preparing, and being prepared for, The Rapture.”
The Nine say that the Hoovids, and thus the Jews, have been great civilization builders, and were chosen to seed Earth for their knowledge and seed-influence on civilization. Ancient Babylonia and Baghdad were Jewish outposts. They also had a great influence on Greek and Roman civilization as well as on Islam through the Diaspora, and then upon the rest of the world. Jewish people are descended from the original Aksu line of starseeds.
The Hoovid race was also chosen for the implantation of “individuality and determination,” and perhaps an ingredient of “tenacity.” The Nine say that the difficulties this race brought with them to the planet, however, were in the matters of “obedience and compassion.” The Hoovids did not obey their original directives they came with, and have not obeyed ever since. This circumstance is mitigated by the fact that they also do not have enough understanding of, or compassion for, other races.
“They set themselves up on a pinnacle and they do not comprehend that by doing this they are putting themselves up as a target for slaughter, for in the center they are the purest and gentlest. . . And thus Israel is important . . All these years the opposition (the Dark Side) has bound it . . . The other civilizations are bound and hindered by the obstinacy of the Hoovids.”
The Hoovids have a basic strength within their character, but also the planet they come from is a war-like planet. In coming here to Earth, they were asked to be at peace. They were asked to be catalysts and leaders amongst the peoples of Earth, but instead they have doubt, suspicion and deception. Part of the reason for their involvement with this planet was to overcome that very same factor
“Within them lives the knowledge that they have made an error, but because of pride, they will not acknowledge this.”
The Nine explain this error by saying that when the Hoovids agree to more freely intermingle with the other races and share their DNA, their life-force, it will create a greater opening in humanity, and with it a great release that will in turn help to release the Universe. They say that the stresses and strains of earthly life caused the Hebrews to look increasingly after their own interests and people, which ended up being counter-productive. The opposition then “got their oar in.”
“The Hoovids . . . are a small group of people that have survived at all odds, a small group who have continued to educate and forward all their peoples, but this is not to say they are



99
perfect . . . The majority of people working with spiritual elevation contain somewhere in them the genes of the Hoovids.”
The lost tribes of Israel were dispersed to far off places such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, North America, and were also mixed in with various peoples such as the Phoenicians, the Celts, and even the Orientals. Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church, was fond of saying that most North Americans are “more Jewish than the Jews.” It was one of these lost tribes that were the origins of the Bloodline of the Holy Grail as explained in Laurence Gardner’s work, as we shall see later on.
As well as the ‘benevolent civilizations out there in the Universe, there are also those who have aligned themselves with the Dark Side, and even many who have simply been taken over by the Dark Side through force of arms and other more exotic weaponry. An excerpt from Solara’s EL:AN:RA—The Healing of Orion gives us a more detailed view of this kind of interaction in narrative form:
“All of this was done under a cloak of utmost secrecy, for Kurala still distrusted most of the spider people. She knew that when the time came, that they would fight fiercely alongside them against the OMNI, but she didn’t want to risk revealing their plans before the time was ripe. In the meantime, she stills sent forth war parties of spider people to conquer small, insignificant planets, in order not to arouse anyone’s suspicion.
“Shamo was not told about any of this. Both Kurala and Shakarr agreed on this matter. He remained in extreme pain and spent most of his time moaning and writhing about in his bed. Kurala would visit Shamo several times a day, sitting solicitously at his bedside, stroking his furry black legs. She was appalled by the presence of his Orion implants. Every time that she looked at them it renewed her will to fight the dreaded OMNI. Kurala murmured to him that soon he would be healed, for indeed, she had sent messengers forth to bring back Galaxitron the finest healers who could be found.
“During the period of preparation, Kurala was given little time to think about AAla-dar. Yet his memory would emerge into her consciousness at the most unexpected times. Sometimes, it appeared as if he resided within her. His handsome face would shine with love; she would see his starry eyes cajoling her to serve the Light.
“Her response to this depended upon her mood as well as her outer activities at the moment. Sometimes she would flash an angry reply at him. “Go away, leave me alone! I have chosen the task that you and your Intergalactic Confederation should have taken on.” At other, quieter moments, she would allow herself to bask in his love, calling for him to giver her strength and support. On occasion, she would wonder if there was any way they could ever be together.
“. . . The renegade ships zoomed by the Galaxitron craft from both sides, cutting across their ship at weird diagonal angles, forcing them to slow down to almost nothing. As the ships cut closer and closer to them, Kurala shouted to her crew to bring the ship to hover position.
“So they want to play it rough with us, do they?” Kurala whispered with excitement. “This is not quite the welcome I expected.”
“She personally took over the ship’s controls. Her features tensed with concentration as she waited for the right instant to act. Nearly forgetting to breathe, she sat with her hand ready upon



100
the hyperspace throttle. Here they came again, even nearer. This time she could feel the oscillating air currents of the passing ships bombard her craft. Then she acted. With spit second precision, she activated both hyperspace and reverse simultaneously. This, she had never done before and wasn’t quite sure if it would work. But actually, Kurala had discovered an old secret used by the triple Commanders for entering Orion’s sword.
“Without a second’s hesitation, she slammed the ship forward and then after the briefest of pauses, out of hyperspace. There just ahead of them loomed the planet Maldon. If she had traveled another instant in hyperspace, their ship would have rammed right into it. Instead, the craft from Galaxitron made a graceful, swooping arc over the spaceport, then delicately landed as if it had been a normal, unhurried entry.
“. . . This was his mystery and his mark of greatness and why he has chosen to stand in the center of the OMNI. It could be said that if you truly looked at Zeon carefully, with your clearest vision, you would see a small sphere of white within his vast vortex of blackness. Only one being at a time within the entire of the Dark Lords of Orion was given this circle to embody. But it was essential to the Divine Plan in accordance with Universal Law, that always there be one embodiment.
. . . “No, we will wait for Quintron. He probably just hasn’t arrived yet and should be here anytime. I wish that he had picked a planet with better energy though. This must be his stupid idea of a bad joke, trying to scare us,” she replied.
“Well, it worked! I’m definitely scared! So let’s get out of here!” Shakarr rattled with terror.
“Kurala admitted to herself that she was also afraid and Shakarr wasn’t making things easier by his whimpering. Maybe it would be smarter if they left this place, the quicker the better.
“O.K. Shakarr, let’s get ready to take off; we’ve had enough of this grim planet.”
“Kurala moved to the bridge as they prepared to ascend. As they became airborne, a curious thing happened. Every time their ship reached a certain altitude of ascent, it was as if a ceiling had been placed above them. They could only go up so far. Each time they hit an invisible barrier which bounced them back downwards.
“With mounting frustration, Kurala tried to remove the energy shield by shooting it with lasers an photon beams. The barrier remained in position. She even considered throwing her ship into hyperspace, but that would be suicide for sure. Most star systems were cluttered with too many planetary bodies to propel your way through in hyperspace. All they had to do was hit one of these deformed moon fragments and they would be thrown into another dimension by the heightened impact created by hyperspace thrust.
“Great welcome, Quintron!” Kurala muttered angrily as she rammed into the barrier again. She attempted to slide under and around the energy shield, but met with no success. Finally, giving up, the warship from Galaxitron landed awkwardly on the runway.
“Instantly it was surrounded by a multitude of small, grey craft which rained down from the sky relentlessly. Curious looking beings began to emerge from the space station and the crafts, walking rapidly towards her ship. Several of them held photon detonators, ready to throw.
“Come out of your ship, now, alien intruders.” Announced a metallic voice.
“Come out immediately or we will vaporize you.”



101
“Well, I guess that I have no choice but to disembark,” said Kurala. Of all the possible traps that she had considered, this was something she had never thought of. She pondered briefly whether Quintron had been captured by these grey beings too, but they hadn’t seen any signs of his ship. Besides he wouldn’t be travelling alone., he’d bring along at least a squadron with him.”
“Kurala gave her crew strict orders to remain on board and to defend the ship for as long as they were able. It was her plan to try to buy Shakarr and her crew their freedom if she could. Giving the sobbing Shakarr a final embrace, Kurala stepped out of her hatch with dignity and courage, doing her best to remember that she was not only the Queen of Galaxitron, but an Angel from the Celestial realms where these sort of terrifying events must be regarded as mere illusions.
“She was instantly encircled by hordes of weird looking beings. Their bodies, of a semitransparent grayish white, were short and skinny making her tower over them. Kurala did her best to emanate detached authority while she stared at them with repressed revulsion. One of the worst things about them were their oversized, elongated heads containing large black eyes focused upon her, were mirrored reflections upon mirrored reflections of herself. It was truly bizarre! “What are you doing on our planet? “What are you doing on our planet? “What are you doing on our planet?
“Why did you come to Reticulum? “Why did you come to Reticulum? “Why did you come to Reticulum?
“How dare you enter where you have not been invited! “How dare you enter where you have not been invited! “How dare you enter where you have not been invited!
“The weird beings reproached her in a din of metallic echoings. They seemed to speak several stepped down forms of language which made them confusing to listen to.
“Can you please answer me on just one vibrational level? It’s very hard to communicate with you otherwise.” Kurala spoke in a tone of friendly arrogance, hoping it would give the desired impression of strength.” I came to this planet because I was invited here by Commander Quintron of the UNA Command who surely must be a friend of yours. Is he here yet?”
“We have never heard of anyone named Commander Quintron, never, never! Therefore, you must be lying to us, so we will take you prisoner,” they replied impassively.
“Although not thrilled with the course this conversation was taking, Kurala was somewhat relieved that, at least, they were speaking through only one step down station.”
To get a part of the bigger picture of who’s who in the Galactic Wars that have been raging for so long, and who is aligned with the Dark side and who is aligned with the Forces of the Light one almost needs a program guide. Fortunately, an Awareness from the Higher Dimensions that is in alignment with the Light helps us here understand some of that bigger picture. Along the way, it also brings into more focus, how serious the issues are on this planet right now, including the dominant influence of Lucifer, and how what happens here affects the entirety of Creation itself:



102
The Structure of Alien Government (Rape & Pillage Allowed)
“The Orion Alliance creates structures on the planets run by hierarchy and controlled by money systems and the Reptoids enforce the allegiance to these structures and control the masses, and for this they (Zeta Reticuli) are allowed what may be termed "rape and pillage" privileges. This Awareness indicates the Zetas support the Reptoids and the Reptoids support and derive authority from the Orion Empire.
(Revelations Awareness 92-14/NO.398)
“Humanity in the meantime is semi-oblivious to all this and simply goes along on their daily pursuit of pleasure/pain behavior life-styles. This Awareness indicates that there are a very few people in the human population who understand much about the overall picture in regard to the alien presence on earth or the agendas of the alien presence and its overall intent.
(Revelations Awareness 93-14/NO. 423)
Getting the Alien Federations Straight
“A clarification about Orion: This Awareness wishes to make some clarifications in this respect; that the majority of those known in Orion are of a negative nature , but that there are some planets and sectors of Orion that are positive in nature. Clarion is a planetary system, a star and planetary system that is of a positive nature. Betelgeuse and some of those stars in that general area are filled with planets that are of negative nature. This Awareness indicates that there are some hundred and thirty planets in that area.
“This Awareness indicates that there is also, besides the Orion Empire, the Draconian Federation. The Draconians have absorbed those from Zeta Reticuli and have brought these entities as mercenaries, but the Reticuli do not think of themselves so much as part of the Federation,-they refer to themselves more as a network. The word "Reticuli" means network, and that is a traditional classification in their history, which they do not easily shed. The Draconian Federation considers however the Network as part of their Federation, subordinate to their controls. The Draconian are able to control the Reticuli through treaties that have been formed some hundred thousand years back, when they helped to rescue the Reticuli from their dying planet (from excessive exposure to radiation) and infused it with new life, and then, in return, gained control over the entities of the Reticuli.
“The Reticuli hail from a binary star, that is, two stars that rotate together, and live on planets close to these stars which are highly unlivable to humans, being very heavy in heat and desert. The Reticuli, in coming to earth prefer desert areas where the climate is quite warm. This Awareness indicates that this in part is favorable because of their insect genetic qualities, which makes up part of their total being. This Awareness indicates that the Draconians also being coldblooded beings, prefer the warm climates. This Awareness indicates as to the concept of the Confederation, this is not a common term used in describing the amalgamation of these planets from the Pleiades, Vega, or the Sirius system, but has been borrowed from human tongue and from the persistent use of the term by channels to describe the amalgamation of these planets working together in this galaxy to try to hinder the spread of Draconian influence.



103
The Intergalactic Confederation is Defined
“This Awareness indicates that the so-called Intergalactic Command or Intergalactic Confederation, this may be thought of more a grouping or alliance of highly evolved spiritual beings of different star systems who have united in their common purpose of hindering the Orion Empire and Draconian Federation from capturing and enslaving other planets outside their already held Federation and Empires. This Awareness indicates that those from Vega have pledged their efforts to help prevent the Empire and the Federation from taking control of Earth. Their methods are not to intervene directly in the affairs from humans, and the humans have allowed the Draconians and Orion Empire representatives to have bases on Earth, therefore the Vegans, Lyrans and Pleiadeans must honor the human decision and treaties with the Draconians and Orion Empire and Reticuli Network to have positions on Earth, until the humans choose otherwise.
How Vegan & Pleiadean Volunteers Work on Earth
“In the meantime the Vegans, those from Lyra and those from the Pleiades have also chosen ways to influence the human movement toward throwing off these would be oppressors. The Vegans send some of their most advanced beings to be born on earth with earthly parents and to grow and develop and do their work to help prevent this take over of the planet by these Empire, Federation and Network aliens. This Awareness indicates that the Pleiadeans have also their volunteers. There have been those who came in space ships and met directly with individuals (Billy Meier) and met directly with individuals who were open and desirous of meeting with them. These entities even gave warning about the Orion Empire and sought to prevent the treaties (with the US Government), but failed to do so*. (* In Behold A Pale Horse page 202, William Cooper speaks also about a race of humanoid aliens, ed)
“Therefore, while they seek to help in whatever ways they can to hinder the Orion Empire in its conquest or the Draconians in their various invasion plans, they avoid direct interference in the affairs pertaining to these entities on Earth They are even careful not to talk about these entities as being dangerous or enemies of theirs or of mankind. Those from Lyra also incarnate into human form to help change the vibrations and instill a sense of spiritual meaning into the lives of those whom they come in contact with. That these are the ways whereby the amalgamation of star systems work together to help Earth in its struggle for survival and for spiritual enlightenment.
The Andromeda Galaxy. Any Decision by The Andromeda Council?
“This Awareness indicates that as long as earth allows the Draconians and Reticulians to remain and treaties have been signed, that this more or less creates a block to prevent interference from the Pleiades, Vegans or others. It is for this reason that any contacts will be of a very minor nature, more to educate and inform than to directly interfere or confront the Draconian, Reticulian and Orion Empire Greys. This Awareness indicates that the Andromeda Council is much like the UN on Earth; it has certain influence, but it has no power over those who refuse to abide by its recommendations. The Draconian Confederation, the Orion Empire; these do not give much credence to the Andromeda Council or its recommendations. They appeal to it when they see a change to benefit or to use it to their advantage. Therefore, at this time, anything given by the Andromeda Council in regard to Earth has been generally ignored by these entities.



104
The Battle is to Save the Souls of the Earthlings
“Essentially, the souls of people IS the issue involved that is of greatest urgency to the Galactic Command or Confederation, for this saving of the souls is that which the spiritual forces perceives to be the real purpose and value. The physical body is temporal anyway, and has only a short time on earth, but the soul being permanent, being more or less eternal, is the more important concern. The Draconian and the Orion forces think that by making it appear the soul is just an illusion and that one's body is what counts, they find themselves able to influence people by fear and by coercion, based on bodily needs and preservation. And in this manner they actually capture the souls of entities who are trying to preserve their body and will do so at the cost of their soul"
(Revelations Awareness 93-14/NO. 423)
“This Awareness indicates that it appears that the entire box of Pandora, is becoming unraveled. The door is opening and there seems to be no end in sight in regards to the unraveling of activity, not just on earth, or even the solar system, but activity throughout the galaxy, which if the strings are examined enough, they begin to lead consciousness into looking into other universes. This Awareness indicates that it has been suggested: As it is above, so it is below. Entities may now begin to realize that likewise, as it is below, so it is above. Humanity has been plagued with wars, but humanity is not alone; so has the galaxy. This Awareness indicates that it does not appear that there is yet an end to the recognition of the influence of these forces in the galaxy and beyond, and that even the resolving of humanity's wars may only be the resolving of a small battle in the galaxy.
A Great Force is Moving across this Plane
“This Awareness indicates there is a great force moving upon your plane that is little understood by entities and may be likened unto a storm in consciousness, blown in from the psychic sea of the Fourth Dimension, that transcends time and space and moves in from ancient times of Atlantis and into the present moment. It is ready to be calmed, if that is allowed by the collective consciousness of entities upon this plane, or it is ready to wreak havoc if that is what it takes to complete its action.
“This Awareness indicates that this force, this programming, is likened unto a type of linear programming that has reached through thousands of years, by which entities were polarized as programmed parts of an incredible complex and massive computer system called "Civilization", wherein the script was written thousands of years ago, and historians of today are only as reporters and reviewers of that play, that dramatic epic that has played for thousands of years upon this stage called "Earth" This Awareness indicates the action of Ra-Ta and the builders of the Pyramid and Sphinx in ancient Egypt were designed to offer a greater attraction, a greater power than those of the Atlantean priests, and once the seekers of power were caught up in the Egyptian power, they were led along the path that brought them not only to power, but that enlightenment and realization that power was not the answer to the cravings of the appetite. In this action, many followers of Baal, of Lucifer, were brought into the Law of One.
“This Awareness indicates that Edgar Cayce, the reincarnate spirit of Ra-Ta, opened the



105
doors for the flood of consciousness upon this plane, to allow that force to begin moving from that Fourth Dimension into this present time. In this action, the Lucifer, The Rhyee, the personification of that first separateness, was given an opportunity to tap into this ancient power that began in Egypt, and in so doing, was drawn unwittingly into states of Awareness that led back to the Law of One, and this Awareness.
“This Awareness indicates that force known as Lucifer is now being drawn out of consciousness and moving into Essence. The Head of the Beast, the original separateness, has already returned to Essence. Only the organs and body of this remains upon your plane, and must, in time, follow also into the return to Essence.
Why Awareness has Come at this Time
“This Awareness indicates all present attempts to pursue and maintain power and control over others are but creating structures that will inevitable be converted into systems designed to serve the people rather than to enslave them; yet, it is a matter of when this will occur, rather than whether it will occur. It is for this reason that this Awareness communicates with entities at this time, and it is for this purpose that entities need to look closely at that which is occurring on their plane, for these energies are a potential force that may be used for good or ill at this time, even as a wind may be harnessed for service, or may wreak havoc.
“This Awareness indicates any good computer programmer can understand the programming system used in Atlantis and Egypt if they are also capable of comprehending the nature of psychic forces, and can comprehend the Pyramid and Sphinx as being likened unto the pituitary and pineal of the collective consciousness upon this plane, and the mummified corpses may be understood as human transmitters, capacitors or other psycho-electro-magnetic components.
“This Awareness indicates this action created great suffering for many millions of entities upon this plane, and that action from Atlantis was initiated for the glory and the power of the followers of Ba'al, the followers of Lucifer, the followers of the mind, and its structuring system of hierarchy, polarity, manipulation and control.
Ra Ta's Power Trap for the Dark Force
“This Awareness indicates the Illuminati that began in Atlantis, may be seen as the Dark Force that sought power through deception, control and manipulation; and that Illuminati from RaTa actions of Egypt was designed to create a power trap that led to enlightenment and a return to the Law of One. We wish to express our love and gratitude to our Source of Being, our Creator who is guiding us through our eternal journey in Oneness.
“We also wish to express our love and gratitude to the people of the Cosmic Awareness Communication Organization and The Aquarian Church of Universal Service of Paul Shockley, who for almost 30 years have been dedicating themselves to help people to become aware Who We Really Are, without those human efforts this document would not have been written.”

Chapter 7 -- The Galaxy and the 24
"Sometimes I wish I could just pay the fine and go home." --the character Jack Lucas in the movie The Fisher King
If the Tree of Life is the symbolic reference to Man’s quest to return to the Higher Worlds and Creation from which he came, then the “Fall of Man” or story of Adam and Eve is the symbolic reference to that ‘fall’ from those very same Higher Dimensions that brought the planet and Man to the 3rd dimension in the first place. Now, like the character referenced from the movie The Fisher King, most of us really just want to pay the fine and go home.
In ancient times, the consciousness of those on the planet was in a higher state than before the “fall of Man”, for the planet itself existed at a fourth dimensional level or higher, having lowered itself along the Galactic spiral on the outflow of the Breath of God during the millions of years prior to that moment. In those days, matter itself was not in as dense and as ‘concrete’ a form as we know it today. All metaphysical or esoteric doctrines mention this fact, as well as attempting to explain the descent of spirit into matter--the idea that Soul only came into the inhabitants of Earth at a certain stage in its evolution. In these earlier stages of consciousness, life also had a very different biochemical relationship with matter than it does today, and planet Earth has gone through many drastic physical and metaphysical changes since the time it was first populated by the Els.
The Branches of the Twenty-Four
Other planets and races involved with the starseeding of planet Earth include races such as the Alteans, whose specialty are the various mental aspects of existence. They are about as tall as an average human, with blue eyes in the shade of a clear blue sky. Their appearance, however, is translucent or iridescent, kind of like the aliens in the movie, Cocoon. Although it was the Hoovids who first settled Earth, the actual physical human seed came from Altea. The 'human' template is fairly widespread in our galaxy, and out into the many galaxies which surround us. Altea has no sun as we have a sun, they are in the zone of cold. That is why they could tolerate the cold ice ages going on here when they came.
The Ashans and Zeneels, on the other hand, do not have a humanoid form. Aragon is a race that works towards perfecting the health of humankind. Zeneel works with interplay or interchange—the creating of order in the color energies – they are the alchemist of the civilizations.
As we can now begin to see, these root races have a direct link to the political machinations that have occurred and are occurring on the planet right now. For instance, the people of China were the result of one seeding, and the Tibetans were the direct descendants from another civilization which was the soul of the Chinese people. The problems between them existed long before coming to this planet and what is going on here now is only a reflection of something that previously existed.
If this is all beginning to sound as if Earth at one time was something like the bar scene from Star Wars, you’ve probably got a good idea of what it might have actually have been like. It is for the very same reason Man’s favorite pastime is to sit somewhere crowded and ‘people watch’ for therein lies the fascination of this planet with the great difference between races.



107
If you also begin to recognize some of these traits in you, you may be able to work out some of your own planetary roots as well. This idea was echoed in a recent television movie in which the all too human-looking alien was confronted with the fact of his striking resemblance to earthlings. His response to the line: “It’s amazing how much you look like us” was simple—“No,” he countered, turning slowly to face the woman. “YOU look like US!”
As Kryon likes to put it, “Don’t be surprised one day when the entity that gets out of a UFO to greet you looks very much like you.”
Starseeds from the planet Ashan have been responsible not only for great art upon this planet, but have also been heavily involved with genetic seeding throughout much of Asia and Polynesia as well. The Ashans are related to the legendary Muses of Greek mythology, however, according to the Nine, they are “not always capable of discipline.” The Chinese show their influence, as do the Scandinavians, and also the Phoenicians.
It is the blending of these three primary civilizations, Altea, Hoova, and Ashan, which brings together the connection and the coupling of the planet Earth with the Universe. This is a product of the Light and Sound as it is encoded in our DNA that connects us up through the cosmic Sound Current to the Soul consciousness known as the Sugmad, and hence through IT to the FATHER. In The Pleiadean Mission, this is explained as our connection to Creation:
“On our spiritual side, we also have the ability to be in connection with Creation through the gemut. When our spirit-form was created, our connection to the Creation was made through this special sensor. While our spirit is listening to our thoughts and accepting wisdom into the subconscious, it always has the ability to use the gemut to check out our ideas with Creation. It is like an open line that is always there for us, and it can only be felt through the spirit. Our spiritual self will not accept any wisdom to be added to our accumulated consciousness unless it first checks with Creation through the gemut to be sure it is in line with the truth. It is Creation that lays down the laws of evolution and creates the framework for man to live by. If man could learn to think with his conscious mind, using these laws of conduct provided by Creation, not only would his life be easier, but his evolution as a spirit-form would progress much faster. In religions and different belief structures there is always the faith factor, for it is not possible to prove that God really exists. It is something that we take on faith because our parents or the priest at our church told us to so.
“If you want to prove to yourself that Creation exists and that it is the ultimate source of love and understanding which can provide all knowledge that is necessary for life, then you have only to make your connection to the Great Eternity through the Gemut. Here you can feel and experience for yourself the ultimate feeling of the life force that guides all things, and it is available to you at any time you choose without going through any ceremonies, spiritual leaders, guides, or forms of worship. You are always connected to it, for you are part of it.”
Unfortunately, it also for the potential that lies within our DNA that Mankind has been seriously abused by members of the Opposition and by other less powerful individual races such as the Greys. This point is stressed in a piece by Anna Hayes from her Voyagers; The Sleeping Abductees, about the Zetan (Greys) agenda here on Earth:
“The plan for the selected Earthseeds involves the eventual contamination of food, water and air supply with certain elemental components that would repress the emotional facilities and thus cut off the possibility of the individuals to link with their Host Matrix families--a biological



108
block to the frequencies or the Host Matrices. Those who are not selected are intended to be removed through dramas created by holographic inserts . . .
“Here the Earthseeds are regular human beings, while 'Host Matrix families' in everyday language is our soul and our soul's connection further up the dimensional ladder.
“The members of your species that were not imbued with the gift of the Zionites, who do not carry the Silicate Matrix within their "junk DNA" and Soul Matrix codes, are known as the Earthseeds. Though all of your species originated from the 12 tribes of the Turaneusiam subprototype, not all of you were selected for the Zionite experiments and resulting accelerated genetic strain (the original selection of the first encounter was random). This does not mean that one group is superior to the other in terms of innate value, as all of you are needed for the fulfillment of the Turaneusiam imprint. But the Starseeds are "ahead of their time" so to speak, and so they carry with them the burden of the sleeping Earthseeds, and the responsibility of helping them to awaken. The Earthseeds are still connected to the Host Matrix families, they have not yet activated the Keylonta Codes that would allow them to begin assembly of their original memory patterns. Many of them have not yet passed through the original frequency fence that would allow the reassembly process to begin. These humans are the most vulnerable to manipulation through holographic insert, and it is some of these that the Zeta desire to utilize for the breeding of a "worker race."
“The Zeta have other plans in mind for the Starseeds. The Silicate Matrix within the Starseed genetic imprint is valuable to the Zeta. It is this element for which they search during unauthorized (by the Soul Matrix) abductions, for they hope to create a stronger more versatile hybrid through humans carrying this code. They view the Starseeds as the potential breeders of a three-dimensional Earth hybrid race that they hope will repopulate the planet once the clearing is completed. The unenlightened Zeta also fear the Starseeds, as they possess the potential ability of seeing through the holographic inserts.
“The Starseeds also are able to more easily partake of multidimensional communication, which enables them to "go" above the frequency fence "the Zeta are working now to "erect" within the human DNA code (remember, the frequency fence is a type of sound technology that utilizes contrived frequency modulation). Because the Starseed is already re-linked, to some degree, to its original Soul Matrix the Zeta cannot perform a forced matrix transplant upon a Starseed without first dismantling the Soul Matrix. This is very difficult to do with the technology they have available. And the Starseeds are protected multi-dimensionally by the Zionites, as well as by other groups (enlightened Zeta, Aethien, Ranthin, Sirian, Pleiadean, Breneau and many other presences). The Starseeds are the greatest threat to the old Zeta agenda, and so the Zeta try to find other ways in keeping them out of operation.
“Zeta do whatever possible to keep the Starseed from awakening to its true identity. A sleeping Starseed is not a threat (and is prime for manipulation). Much of the "brainwashing program" has been employed to keep the Starseeds sleeping through distraction and fear of their own identities as appearing "out of the norm." They have also instigated a campaign to create separation and segregation between the Starseeds and Earthseeds, and also between Starseed groups, thereby exerting social pressure upon the awakening individuals.
“The Zeta and the Interior Governments have also "pushed" in certain places and in certain times within the Medical communities. The movement to discredit holistic therapies, and to use



109
drugs for the treatment of "emotional" conditions not of a psychotic nature, the prejudice within the psychiatric professions toward "spiritual" or "paranormal" experience, the repression of "women's issues" and "minority" rights--all of these things are fueled by Zeta "agitation" in the "right places at the right times." The Zeta and Interior also infiltrate religious communities when needed, to insure that the factions will remain at odds, to ensure that humans will not band together in tolerance, for that would be the demise of the old Zeta agenda. You would not believe the issues within your public forum that have come under Zeta/Interior influence at one time or another. Why do you think issues of UFO sightings are repressed and censored from the media whenever possible? Who supports the networks? Advertisers, of course. Who might be influencing conglomerates "behind the scenes"? Perhaps a few "little grey shadows?"
Although not a direct participant in the Civilizations of the Twenty-Four, the Ashtar Command was created from a peaceful planet as an example for all non-peaceful planets to emulate. It is a planet which has seven major cities enclosed in crystal domes, or what appear to be crystal domes but are really energy fields held in place by a thought field from the general consciousness of the population there. According to the book A Pleiadean in Time, Ashtarians are very scientific, they are often researchers or inventors. They are tall and thin, and prefer to wear their hair long.
Other Branches Involved with Planet Earth In compiling this history, the author could have had a more massive job on his hands than it actually was. The amount of literature on the subject is staggering to the imagination. Just because it is written, however, does not mean it is all true. Any history book in school is simply history as seen from the point of view of the dominant race in the culture. Therefore, history books usually have an agenda to support, especially when the publishing of those books rests upon their treatment of the current power structure in place.
In terms of Universal history, there has been literally a flood of new works over the past decade from people channeling this being and that being. There are people with access to ancient documents of one sort or another, or people reliving some moment from an apparent past life, either of their own, or of someone they have been able to tap into through their psychic sensitivity to the Akashic Records.
Each one of these people, each one of these books, is not necessarily right or wrong. Many are deceptions perpetrated by the Opposition to confuse the issues and lead people astray. That is simply a given. As for the others, it is important to understand that they are written from simply one perspective upon the whole situation. If you are taking an elevator up the Space Needle in Seattle, you will have a different perspective of the city below at 100 feet above the ground than you will once you get to 200 feet above the ground, and so on. Your vision may also be further restricted due to the direction in which the elevator faces. You will not, however, gain the full 360 degree view of Seattle and its surrounding area until you reach the summit and are able to see in every direction from the pinnacle of the experience.
The Nine therefore give this following warning as to the validity of the information available on any certain subject concerning the spiritual works.
“If humans on the Planet Earth have (psychic) communication with a helper or a lesser civilization that does not understand the workings of all, then they are liable to receive misinterpretations.”



110
The Nine themselves are not privy to the even higher perspectives of the true Spiritual Hierarchy of the Universe, not just those who are involved with this planet.
In dealing with the other civilizations who have come to planet Earth for one reason or another, it is important to keep this fact in mind. While some of these are simple visitors, and others one-time residents, a number of these civilizations are very war-like, and very oppressive races. This area of the Universe has seen many wars since its creation. Some aliens civilizations have been on the planet to plunder and pillage its resources much as the marauding tribes of Earth’s history have done to other countries. Others have been here to exert certain influences on the governments of the world in line with their own current agenda. Some are simply in league with “the Opposition,” and are being used to help fulfill Lucifer’s ultimate goal. As the Nine like to point out, at times these inquisitive extraterrestrial beings can create a problem. Civilizations which do not understand the background of what is currently happening on planet Earth, who are visiting our planet for the sake of curiosity, research or experimentation, tend to get in the way of the delicate situation here, only helping to confuse issues further.
The best-known of these type of aliens are of course the notorious Grays or Greys, already mentioned. Theirs has become the face, and especially the slanted eyes, that now represents a whole Universe of alien civilizations. A small town of about 50,000 people in southeastern New Mexico called Roswell has made these little guys almost more famous than Elvis. The Greys are a race from a star system known as Reticulum, or Zeta Reticuli, 37 light years away from Earth, but still in this galaxy. As any 14-year-old child can now tell you, they are the ones, in league with a couple of other races, who are mostly responsible for the abductions taking place here on this planet.
According to the Nine, the Grays wish to know if they can exist upon planet Earth by taking tissue samples from abductees for culturing. They have been working with the cooperation of the earth governments for some time to try and save the genetic pool of their race by trying to cross it with Earth genes, as described earlier. The Nine give us a warning to be cautious of those from Reticulum and their motives. In fact they give a warning to be cautious at this time of all those visiting Earth:
“The Greys have an urgent hidden agenda of their own. The cover-up around the arrangement with the Greys is obscuring the bigger picture. . . (but)do not create the mistake of believing their higher motivation at all times in visiting your planet Earth. There are those who would wish to come here because they have begun the destruction of their own home physical planet and are looking for a place to relocate themselves. . . A portion of this motivation is indeed prepared for utilizing, if necessary, Earth species for their own environments, on their own planets. . . Therefore they are experimenting upon humankind and animalkind for testing the available possibilities.”
There are many kinds of Zeta, but they are simply without Love. Like many alien races, they are curious about our emotions, especially about Love. Some writers say that the Zetans desperately want the emotions that we here on Earth use so freely, and will actually come in another dimension to abduct your spirit, deal with you , ask you questions, and then return you to your physical body on Earth. Can they really do that? Yes they can, we are multi-dimensional beings living in a multi-dimensional Universe. Many abductees have stories of aliens without emotions who are so curious about our emotions and seemingly uncaring toward those they have abducted and experimented on. The best answer suggested by one writer is to “practice lucid



111
dreaming,” being awake even while asleep and thus better able to protect oneself. The presence of this group of aliens on the planet, however, is fairly recent in comparison with many of the other races.
William Bramley, author of The Gods of Eden, says that abduction cases tend to follow a distinct pattern: a human being is involuntarily taken aboard a UFO, is given a comprehensive physical examination, and is then released. This appears to us much like what the wildlife experts do with game, especially endangered species which they wish to monitor—capture, tag, implant transmitter, and release. And don’t get us wrong, implantation of monitoring devices is not just an X-Files fantasy.
Bramley details one of the most famous early experiences that took place with the abduction of Betty Andreasson:
“In the room, Mrs. Andreasson saw a large bird about fifteen feet in height. The bird resembled an eagle, but it had a longer neck. It was in fact, a replica of a phoenix, and it had the illusion of being alive. As Mrs. Andreasson stood and watched it, the phoenix began to undergo a transformation. Mrs. Andreasson felt an intense heat so powerful that she cried out in pain during her hypnosis session while recounting the incident. These strange alien room abruptly cooled off. Where the “Great Bird” had stood there now burned a small fire. The fire died down to a pile of gray ash with a few red embers. As the pile continued to cool, Betty saw something in the ashes: “Now, looks like a worm,” she recalled under hypnosis, “a big fat worm. It just looks like a big fat worm—a big gray worm just lying there.”
What Mrs. Andreasson had witnessed was a re-enactment of the legend of the phoenix, clearly staged for her benefit. The phoenix is a Brotherhood symbol which has often been used to promote apocalypticism and justify endless human suffering., according to Bramley. Although Mrs. Andreasson’s “vision” of the phoenix constituted only a small portion of her abduction experience, the investigators concluded that it is only too obvious that the aliens had brought Betty to the bird as the focal point of her whole experience. It seemed to be the purpose for her travel through the red and green spaces. As a result of her experience, she began to include UFOs in her own Christian apocalyptic belief system. Researcher Raymond Fowler probed these beliefs:
Raymond Fowler: Have they (UFOs) anything to do with what we call the second coming of Christ? Betty: They definitely do.
Raymond Fowler: When is this going to occur?
Betty: It is not for them to tell you.
Raymond Fowler: Do they know?
Betty: They know the Master is getting ready, and very close.
“If real, Betty Andreasson’s experience was a remarkable one. It would indicate that she was but one in a very long line of reluctant prophets forcibly implanted with an apocalyptic religious message by members of what appears to be a custodial society. (The issue of the second coming of Christ shall be further dealt with throughout this book.) Like the “Ezekiels” who preceded her in history, Betty Andreasson’s testimony suggests she suffered considerable mental tampering at the hands of her abductors. This tampering may account for some of the unusual perceptual



112
phenomena she experienced during her abduction episode. Unlike past “Ezekiels” however, Mrs. Andreasson’s vision will probably not be added to the Bible, nor will it cause her to rally an army to embark on a campaign of religious conquest. Her courageous testimony will simply offer the world additional evidence that the 20th century has not seen a change in the methods by which a Custodial race appears to maintain a hold on the human race.”
Bramley’s conclusion that these people are being forcibly implanted with apocalyptic visions is daring and provocative, but essentially correct. But for what reason, we must ask ourselves, especially since some abductees have actually claimed to have met Jesus on board the spacecraft which abducted them? And why should these aliens wish to monitor us with implants? We shall come to those answers soon enough.
Another UFO researcher believes that he has found a common denominator in many of the abductions he has studied, one which keeps on being repeated over and over again.
“I deal with lots of people who have been abducted, and the one common denominator seems to be the blood line, and its the blood line that goes back to ancient Indian or Native American blood lines.”
This, of course, would be those of a Pleiadean or Sirian origin if this is true. Many abductees such as the ones mentioned in Constance Clear’s book, Reaching for Reality, have come to understand their own part in agreeing to work with these alien ancestors—the fact that part of their life contract specifically agrees to be used for these purposes.
The Annunaki
The Annunaki of Nibiru, made famous by Sumerian scholar Zechariah Sitchin in his 12th Planet series of books, are exceedingly important to the overall picture of our history, so much so that we have allotted other chapters later in the book to exploring their interaction with Earth.
The Sirians
Likewise with the Sirians, for they, along with the Orions, are the race which has had so much influence on the beginnings of Atlantis, and subsequently Egypt and the civilizations of the Mediterranean region before the time of Christ.
The Men in Black According to Barbara Clow, the Men in Black from Orion, are responsible for many of the great tragedies that have occurred on Earth in the past 26,000 years. The excerpt from Solara’s El:An:Ra—The Healing of Orion in the previous chapter touches on their influence on many other planets besides Earth. They are returning heavily to Earth at this time because of the level of technology we have achieved, a level of technology still childish compared with the state of technology on Atlantis prior to its destruction, the time when they first began to get heavily involved with this planet.
The Men in Black are of the negative polarity spoken about in the section on ‘the opposition.’ Their particular skill, according to Clow, is in setting up situations which encourage evil choices during times of high technology. Most people on Earth subconsciously remember their influence during the Fall of Atlantis, causing in them in this lifetime, a fear of ancient cataclysm and an almost total mental paralysis upon encountering the Men in Black.



113
They are usually dressed in dark suits with white shirts and red ties as people encounter them here on the planet. Their original battle was with the Nibiruans and the Sirians, and they are to a great extent, responsible for the galactic wars which have been transpiring in this corner of the galaxy for eons.
“Orion had been monitoring technological developments upon Earth with great sophistication, and have held the dominant paradigm on Earth in position for their own purposes of control, that is the belief that Earth is the only place in the universe with conscious lifeforms. Orion has also engaged in a program of seeding walk-ins—Orion robots—on Earth to help maintain their influence and control over the governments and peoples of this planet.”
According to Clow, the Men from Orion have decided to commence another battle which is going on right now as they try to trigger humans into nuclear conflict in order to gain this position of ultimate control. The pollution of the Earth and the paralysis of well-meaning people is a behavior pattern from their previous wars in this solar system. Like the Zetans, if they make the conditions on Earth bad enough, no one but themselves will be able to survive here, for beings from Orion can tolerate high levels of radiation because the stars there are extremely dense. Orion immune systems are also very strong, since their low level of vibration enables them to tolerate the typical modern diet and exposure to pollution and toxic chemicals. Since their agenda is basically negative, the Men in Black are also not agonized over the genocide of the species, remembering Lucifer’s ultimate goal and sworn mission to become ‘God’ of his own Universe.
In their first battle here on the planet, 26,000 years ago, crystals were implanted in the
etheric bodies of powerful or rebellious people by the Orion Atlanteans. The Men from Orion, able to step outside of the linear time frame, also knew that Earth would undergo another struggle at this point in the future between the positive and negative forces in the Universe. Therefore, many of these key crystals were programmed to help their cause by affecting those of the Light who would return here one day to continue the fight against them. The end phase of this Orion plan is to bring in walk-ins from their home planet in order to use the crystals to maximum advantage. The Orion crystals are programmed to convince people here that radiation will not really hurt their children, or the planet Earth. They are the influences behind many of the ‘blind eyes’ turned toward what is really going on here on Earth at the present time. We shall deal with these crystal implants in more detail in the chapter on Atlantis.
In her book Heart of the Christos, Clow accuses the World Management Team, those on Earth working with the negative alien forces, of trying to flood the space around our planet with liquid plutonium to stop other multidimensional aliens coming here to help us. The one element Pleiadeans especially cannot tolerate, she says, is plutonium.
“The purpose of the space shuttle program is to send liquid plutonium out into space from earth, so that we (the Pleiadeans) cannot return to Earth and so earth people will not remember their stellar selves . . . We cannot incarnate into Earth form if the atmosphere contains much more plutonium, for our vibration is intensely disturbed by this element.”
Plutonium not only causes cancer, she says, but also destroys the immune system, our protection against viruses from space, a protection “which took billions of years to develop” As many sources will agree, the unbridled use of radioactivity threatens to pollute the Galaxy.



114
The Nine also express their great concern about the intervention of so many “alien” races with the planet. They say that many of the problems going on here today were set in motion many thousands of years ago:
“There are things which were not part of the planning . . . that come about by greed and vanity and desire. We speak of the governments that control the world, that create the crisis. It was not part of the plan . . .
“The planet earth has been held in bondage. And now it is in its last days in the form it has taken for millennia. When the souls of Earth have recognized their reality and understood, they can then be released, and they can provide teachings and understandings for others in other galaxies and solar systems in the Universe.”
They are sad that the governments of our world have refused to publicly believe, or convey to the people, their existence, and that of so many other races. Instead, most of the governments of the world are in complicity with the negative alien--or Opposition-backed plans for a New World Order. These governments do not really have much of a choice considering the leverage the major powers and the bankers now hold over them.
Former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, in an address to the Bilderbergers Group in France, on May 21, 1992, stated
“Today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order, tomorrow they may be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there were an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that the peoples of the world would plead with the world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government.”
Someone wise once said, ‘the biggest thing we have to fear is fear itself.’ This is true for if we give up fear, we need never give up another thing. Fear is the key weapon of the negative forces against the people and those working for the Light.
So the experiment of the Twenty-Four Civilizations got out of hand, as experiments will tend to do, especially with so much uncontrollable input from so many outside sources. Many there were who didn’t want the plan to succeed in the first place, and these did their very best to spoil it. How, though, does anything grow or improve without a little experimentation?
“When you accept, understand in totality, with complete trust and faith in self, in your connections with the Universe, then you bring about the balance and are no longer in bondage. Through the mental process of mind, if you disconnect the mind from what it is holding on to, it will be free. This disconnecting can go by stages, so that you can develop trust and faith in your ability to maintain your inner connection with the Universe. (12) There is never just one future. There are several choices of future. This is involving your will. If we(the Civilizations) know what is the future then that means that we in truth have become involved, and have manipulated your free will.”
The many different realities or futures all exist only as possibilities until they are filled with the intention and energy which makes them the chosen future. It has only become evident even to the Nine that the future is changing drastically at this time in Creation for exactly the reasons



115
this book attempts to underscore. Like the creatures running amok in The Island of Dr. Moreau, the experiment here has gotten out of hand and is becoming a cancer threatening the rest of Creation. Decisions have already been made at much higher levels than that of the Nine.
“If you only knew upon worlds without number in space—stars of great majesty and beauty that appear like beautiful gems in the black velvet of the Omniverse—the millions of Souls that are crying out, and their voices ring out in a peal of peace towards the Earth. If men were aware of such love and such affection and such direction the problems of Earth would not be problems at all” –Brother Phillip.
It may seem to some unjust, but these decisions even included at one time a plan to terminate the experiment that was getting out of control on planet Earth. As Kryon puts it
“In the last five hundred years . . . you used the technology that was given to you for negative instead of positive . . . And so it was the expectation of Spirit that earth would be terminated . . . and that the polarity would be shifted in a far different way than it has been. . . For you have changed that, even within the last fifty years of your existence here on this planet .”
Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon religion, once said this is the Darkest Star of all, and even the Nine admit that we are using our God-given creativity to export new kinds of negativity into the universe. But one thing they do guarantee, they will not permit the total destruction of planet Earth in this time.
There are countless numbers of Light Beings on the Earth right now who chose to come here for the benefit of the Universe, to assist in what is going on right now. Even Kryon says He has brought with Him thousands of his workers. But have things changed that much, and where are they headed to? These are the major questions yet to be answered.
As a way of looking back on Creation, let’s take a look at Emil Bock who, in his work Genesis--Creation and the Patriarchs, summarizes the Creation of the world in ways which often parallel the Creation stories of the Lakota, such creation stories as told in the book Sons of the Wind. He adds another layer of meaning, however, to the various Creation stories we have already looked at:
“First came the old Saturn cycle: Soul-spirit beings were go through the first stage of incarnation weaving a garment and bodily sheath and eventually reaching the level of the mineral kingdom (but nothing as hard as stone minerals of today). It was a weaving of the fire element; warm substance was the only corporeality that existed.
“Then came the old sun cycle: the air element is added to that of warmth. Light was born!“A greater wealth of possibilities of embodiment was offered to the hierarchical beings as well as the human souls still engulfed in a deep sleep.” Creation did not reach above the plant kingdom. Plant forms lit up and sparkled. The old sun cycle contains the sun, moon, earth and other planets as one cosmic body.
“During the old moon cycle: water is added to warmth and air. To the light is added tone, the cosmic Word. There is significant separation and duality appears when the sun's etheric being separates from the corporeality of the planet. The earth proceeds by degrees in condensation. The soul-bearing animal kingdom manifests without bodily forms. There is gradually diversifying animal corporeality. Still in the fluid element, man is in the next stage of incarnation. His deep



116
cosmic sleep slowly lights up to dreamlike consciousness. The earth and moon still formed a unity.
“The earth cycle: for the moon to prevent earth from becoming too hard, it separated from it. Earth, fire, water, air, all brought forth corporeal existence to the stage of man. Now dawned the wakefulness of thought.
“ . . . The 5th and last stage is the post Atlantean age which we are now in. It has been developing for over 10,000 years and is our step into the future.”
The immediate and the ultimate future are two very different things. This step into the future when looked at far into the distance is the ultimate future Randolph Winters speaks about as ‘Step Seven –Life with Creation’, the last of the seven cyclical steps in Creation from The Pleiadean Mission that we began in a previous chapter. This is the level of return to a ‘Oneness’ with the Sugmad and the Ocean of Love and Mercy—the sea that is the collectiveness of Soul, that which Is often known as ‘The Source.’ Only this time we return as an ‘Awakened One.’
“Step Seven –Life with Creation
Twilight Sleep through Eternity
“Our Spirit forms are part of Creation that will sleep for a period of seven greattimes, or an eternity (eternity doesn’t mean forever, just for one great cycle). During this time all life and the whole universe ceases to exist. There is no space or time, only the nothingness of sleep. It is not a time for creative thought, but a restful time of cogitation.
A New Greattime for Creation
“Creation awakens and starts to create a new universe, just as before. We are now part of a completely new cycle. Our awareness of self is gone, for we are one with eternity now an are contributing to the spiritual knowledge that guides all.
Creation Starts a New Universe.
“Creation will once again begin its evolutionary cycle by creating living forms which can contribute to its evolution through wisdom gained from experience. A New Universe will be formed to repeat the cycle of evolution (of soul). The energy of Creation has evolved to a higher level.
Creation of New Spirit-forms.
“Creation is constantly improving and creating new spirit-forms. Spirit-forms are small parts of creation that will evolve by becoming material life forms. Creation will continue to evolve and improve itself through the cycle of life forms. Creation is constantly starting new spirit-forms throughout the complete cycle of the Material Universe. Even here on earth new spirit-forms are coming into life. Since they have no accumulated knowledge or intelligence, we will often think of them as idiots or insane. In many cases they are just new spirits who have come into a material world far too advanced for them.
Moving into Spiritual Form
“It is part of the function of Creation to continually strive fore spiritual greatness by gaining in knowledge. Since the spirit is always awake and never sleeps during a greattime, it is observing



117
and learning at all times. The human form continues to think and provides food for the spirit. Creation is continuing to strive for perfection in itself in order to become an Ur Universe.
The Completion of Seven Cycles
“Creation can not degenerate. It is always moving forward in its evolution. The same applies to the human spirit-form, for it cannot degenerate either (except in extreme cases ed.) It is possible to be stagnant or to waste lifetimes without learning anything, but never does the spirit become ill or degenerate. Seven cycles of evolution through the creation of Material Universes will be completed as the energy level of Creation continues to increase.
The Final Improvement in the Seventh Period.
“As any Creation reaches the last cycle of its seven periods and has mastered the highest improvement possible, it will transform into an Ur Universe that is capable of creating other Creational Universes such as ours. The energy level of the Ur Universe is so great that it can provide cosmic life force energy to several Creational Universes at one time. Its existence is pure spiritual energy. The cycle of evolution of spiritual energy continues.”
As for our immediate future, that still depends very much on us. The individual’s future is certainly a very personal level decision, although there are collective processes at work as explained in this excerpt from an article by Jelaila Starr titled The 5th Dimension -What Will It be Like?:
“As I understand it, we (all of us on earth) have chosen through our actions to include a collective in our reality at this time, hence the Internet. And the true purpose of this collective is to establish a foundation upon which we can create a different reality/society—one that is created on the precepts of Unity and Separateness. I believe that many of us on earth have come here from other worlds where collectives are common and therefore when it was time, we pulled from our subconscious memories and began using the technology stored there. There is a saying, "There is nothing new in the universe." I really believe this. All that we are doing right now on this planet has been done before. I believe that we are tapping into our future selves and bringing the knowledge of how to establish a 5D society across the dimensions/states of consciousness to our world now. In other worlds we are creating what we have created before on other worlds and other timelines . . .”
Perhaps as much as any other, the following excerpt from an interview with Alex Collier, done by noted author Val Valerian, draws out some of the details of what life is like on other planets, and certainly planets that exist and interact with varying other races in the Universe: Male-Female Relationships in Zenetaen Society
Alex: Let me answer that question this way. I have that question written down to ask them, because you gave me a question like that before to ask them. But, they did tell me that there was a time when they first left the Lyrae system, after about 21 generations had gone by, where they found themselves hiding. Again, I don’t know all the details, but they were being hunted by another race. They were living in hollowed-out asteroids and moons. They were moving all the time. Val: This is the whole Zenetaen civilization. Alex: That’s correct, and I do not know how many there were. They were basically living on craft and having to move around all the time, looking for a place that was safe. Well, there were beings



118
from the Casseopian system that helped them, and apparently at that point in time the Zenetaens were under a kind of imposed dictatorship, because they were in survival mode and one person took control of their civilization. I can remember Moraney saying that it was imperative that they receive help, because they may not have evolved out of that , had it gone on any longer. What happened was that they were taken to two solar systems in the Andromedan galaxy. We know them as ‘star 42’ and ‘star 44’. Star 42 is Zenetae, which is now their star system. Star 44 is Tishtae. Star 42 has 27 planets around the binary stars. Star 44 has nine planets, but all of the planets are equal to or greater than the size of Jupiter. They at this point were all terraformed. Val: These beings from the Casseopian system interacted with them approximately how long ago in our terms? Alex: About 2.5 million years ago, but perhaps a little longer. Val: Has the Zenetaen skin color always been blue? Alex: No. It was red at one time. Their original forefathers were red-skinned, and I am told that the Lyraens and Vegans were red-skinned at that time. Val: How did the progression begin to where the skin color changed to blue? Alex: Apparently it had to do with a pigmentation change caused by the ingestion of certain minerals. . . Val: Copper-based minerals. Alex: It was in the food and everything they ate, and the double sun had an effect on this too. You have to remember something here. We are talking about fifth density beings, not third density, so you have the additional three color spectrums. I always try to take that into account when comparing them to us. They do literally live in another frequency. Val: Now, at one point in time I had asked you whether the Zenetaens were aware of another group from the Andromedan system called the Inextrians, and you indicated that this group was from a star called Mirach. Alex: Yes, Mirach is the central sun for that system. There are, if I remember this correctly, 919 other suns that revolve around Mirach, including stars we don’t even see. Val: Stars that exist on other frequency levels. Alex: That’s correct. I believe approximately 130 of those 919 suns have inhabited planetary systems. The Inextrians come from one of those 130. There are two other groups from that group of 130 that have been here to Earth before. Val: Now, at one point in time I had asked you whether the Zenetaens were aware of another group from the Andromedan system called the Inextrians, and you indicated that this group was from a star called Mirach. Alex: Yes, Mirach is the central sun for that system. There are, if I remember this correctly, 919 other suns that revolve around Mirach, including stars we don’t even see. Val: Stars that exist on other frequency levels. Alex: That’s correct. I believe approximately 130 of those 919 suns have inhabited planetary systems. The Inextrians come from one of those 130. There are two other groups from that group of 130 that have been here to Earth before.
More on the Draconian Civilization
Val: Another question that has been put to me to ask you is the following. If withholding love leads a race to regression and devolution, due to the absence of expressed emotion, then why is it that the Alpha Draconians are two billion years old and have not yet become extinct? Second, what is the average life expectancy of the Draco?



119
Alex: The average life span of the Draconians extends from 1,800 to 4,100 years of age. The ones that live as long as 4,100 years are the royal line of the Draconians. Val: The winged Ciakars. Alex: Yes, because their genetics have been kept totally intact. Now, as far as them being regressive, yes they are, but what is interesting, Val, is that they are not regressive with respect to their own people, only against other races. So, what you’ve got is that you have this race of beings that are very regressive toward other races other than their own. Val: It sounds like a super-model of imperialism. Alex: They don’t turn on their own people and have continued to evolve within their own race. Alex: Right. I would not at all be surprised by that. That kind of scenario has been foretold by many individuals, even Apolloneus of Tyana, who spoke of “wars in heaven” in 79 AD. The proverbial ‘war in heaven’. . . . Val: Here’s another question that was submitted to me: “You mentioned that the Lemurians and Atlanteans were extraterrestrials and you also mentioned Nibiru. Tell us about Nibiru and its role and relationship to us in this solar system.” Alex: This is what I have been told about who those connected with Nibiru are. A very long time ago, colonies on Sirius B and the Orion Group were having trouble with each other. In order to bring peace, there was a marriage between two members of each group. The woman came from the Orion Group, where the hierarchy includes a queen - the matriarchal paradigm. The male was from Sirius B. Both members were considered royalty of their respective line. When these two came together in marriage, their offspring had the genetics from both lines. Because of these genetics, the new race that was created was given the name “Nibiru”, which I am told by Moraney in the Orion tongue means “divided amongst two”. This is who they literally are - a cross between those from Sirius B and a race from the Orion system. They formed a new “tribe” which has continued to flourish for at least hundreds of thousands of years. So, they are a tribe that has become a race.
Attempt To Use Our Own Free Will Against Our Interests
Alex: They said that we on earth have learned the concept of prejudice from the Orion Group who were here. When they were here, we watched how they treated other races and groups. So, we have just propagated that. The bottom line is, if they do create severe racial tension on this planet.....you may hear about it on the news or read it in the newspaper, and this is just an example, but in order for you to go out and actually harm another soul, you have to consciously make that decision. I think what they are going to try to do is use our free will against us. In other words, they are going to try and convince us that this is what we need to do, and instead of people separating themselves from that idea, they are going to buy into it and try to manipulate the situation so it will appear to other benevolent groups that might want to help us that we are not worth helping. Val: But, I would think that the Andromedans and other peaceful groups would know that the regressives would try this tactic... Alex: Well, they probably will know it. I know they know that, but the fact of the matter is, if we move down that path and we don’t ask for help, they will not intervene.
Opening the “Can of Worms”: Analysis of Concept of “Request for Help”
Val: Well, the idea of “asking for help” opens up an entirely new can of worms. Alex: Well, I know.



120
Val: Personally, I don’t see it happening, because I don’t see enough of whomever getting it together to make a difference. I think the fact that our race has been betrayed by others both inside and outside our race is known by the Andromedans and other beneficent races. And, the Andromedans and other races in the Andromedan Council know that this planet has been manipulated psychologically, chemically, biologically and otherwise to the point where the common neurological functioning of the human brain in the general population is so dysfunctional that a common consensus is not possible with a large number of people at this time in a direction of spiritual intent that would allow assistance to manifest itself. Now, there is no possible way the Andromedans or anyone else out there could not know how deliberately messed up the human brain has become and how the possibility of general intent has been thwarted. My question is, in knowing that, why would they then say, “we’ll come and help you if you ask us,” when they fully know that we cannot do that as a population?
Alex: Well, I don’t know that they know we can’t ask. Val: They know our whole history holographically about all the things that have been going on here with the perversion of the human neurology and the historical interference with the capabilities of the population in terms of intent. For example, the process of water fluoridation interferes with the hippocampus, which in turn interferes with the ability to challenge tyranny. This is why the Germans and the Soviets used fluorides, and it is why the U.S. is one of the most heavily fluoridated countries on the planet. Now, the Andromedans know that this is going on, and that’s just the tip of the neurological iceberg. So, in knowing that, they would still say, “we’ll help you if you ask us?” I find this interesting, and somebody has to ask this question. There must be a missing piece here somewhere in something they are not saying.
Andromedan View of “Truth” on Earth At This Time
“Truth, on your planet, is a filtered experience understood only through your personal belief systems or concepts. We have discovered that everyone on your world has a different truth, and there have been cultures-of-truth in every society or civilization. It has kept a continuum of light here on your planet. The truth is not told to everyone because everyone, we feel, is not ready to hear it. There are some who have, and would take your truths and put them in a box, and then keep their lives detached from it. The problems is that much of your mankind is taking these truths personally instead of seeing it as an objective truth or reality. They would take this truth and make it very egotistical in order to glorify themselves and others, and as we perceive, and through our own experience, a truth is not meant for that at all. They would then create a religion or some kind of dogma again, something which they could remain detached from, yet glorify in the eyes of others. And a truth has nothing to do with your earth religions. The secret, wondrous nature of Spirit has nothing to do with your religions. You are all multi-dimensional. Think that way. In order to think that way, you Terrans should turn the way you understand and perceive yourselves and life inside-out, and make all of your belief systems abstract, not personal. Because of your personal attachments, you have cut yourselves off from universal knowledge. You have to have an objective mind to gain true knowledge. You have all cultivated the attitude of a subjective self. The Is-ness does not live inside of all of you, and if you won’t conceive of or believe in your own divinity, how are you going to make the leap into the next levels? How are you going to attract and magnetize true, unconditional respect and love, to you, without thinking in this way. If you do not participate, you will only be a spectator. You will not watch or participate in the plan for growth and evolution in our galaxy, and not truly experience it yourself.”

Chapter 8 -- The Branch of Lemuria
Although life as we know it began on the planet as much as ten and a half million years ago, it is, as Kryon says, only worth looking back at the information that is no older than 100,000 years. Before that time, one is looking at humans who were not in fact like us, and not really part of our direct lineage.
One must also remember that prior to the Great Flood of 9,000 BC, the planet was still fourth dimensional. Keeping this in mind, there are many who will speak of MU and Lemuria as being two separate cultures though in truth they were just on a different vibrational level. One aspect of the population in the early history of Mu was that they had the ability to come and go at will from their bodies, much like experienced astral travelers do—for the astral is the plane of the fourth dimension itself.
Mu, at that time, was a state of consciousness on this planet. It could exist in the West today and the South tomorrow and in the East the next day. It was a state of conscious existence. It could rise like a landmass out of the sea and it could disappear just as easily. That is not something that's easily understand now because people are in a heavier vibration where things are much more fixed and move at a much slower pace.
There was a marked difference at that time also in the DNA structure, the crucial records of our genetic history stored within each and every cell.
Edgar Cayce mentions these early times and hints at the higher dimensional nature of the Lemurians in a few of his readings, but they are kind of nebulous, and lacking in very much detail:
“In the land known as Utah or Nevada, when the first peoples were separated into groups as families. . . The entity [entity, sometimes called soul entity, refers to the soul or spirit, that part of an individual which Cayce said survives death] developed much and gave much to the people who were to succeed in that land, and in the ruins as are found in the mounds and caves in the northwestern portion of New Mexico may be seen some of the drawings the entity made. Some ten million years ago. (no. 2665-2, July 17, 1925)
“. . The number of human souls then in the earth plane being 133,000,000 . . . the period in the world’s existence from the present time being 10,500,000 years ago. When man came in the earth plane as lord of that in that sphere, man appeared in five places then at once—the five senses, the five reasons, the five spheres, the five developments, the five nations.” (no. 5748-2, May 28, 1925)
Very few of Cayce’s life readings refer specifically to incarnations in this ancient period. According to one of his biographers, in the readings which do, the remarks are strange indeed:
“ . . . the entity was in the Atlantean land and in those periods before Adam was in the earth. The entity was among those who were then thought projections, and the physical being had the union of sex in one body . . .” (no. 5056-1, May 6, 1944)
Earth has not always been a 3rd dimensional world. This occurrence, believe it or not, was a fairly recent event in terms of the actual history of the entire planet from its Creation. The process of lowering through the dimensions is a very long process. Even the lowering from the 4th dimension into the 3rd dimension happened gradually, and was caused as much by the lowering in consciousness of the inhabitants of the planet at that time. In the time which Cayce is referring to in these life readings, the planet had only five dimensions—the ‘five spheres’—surrounding it,



122
because at that time it existed on the 4th dimension, and there were in truth only nine dimensions of existence for this particular planet.
Remember, this was in the Satya Yuga, the Golden Age of Man when existence was at a much higher or finer level of vibration. The beings who existed were still very much closer to their true selves in Soul, though not as experienced in the awareness of life and the varying possible natures of man. The planet then was as many of the other planets we spoke about in the previous chapter are now, existing at a higher frequency, a higher rate of vibration, a higher dimensionality.
As the planet has evolved or devolved through the Yugas, the vibrations have become very much more dense, the inhabitants on the planet have grown further away from their true spiritual nature, and subsequently the planet has lowered in its dimension, leaving behind it more dimensions in the higher worlds. Earth has been firmly grounded in the 3rd dimension for much of the past 10,000 years, but as many people can confirm, it is in the process of ascending again back into the higher worlds, specifically into what would be called the 5th dimension.
As Lemuria became more of a fixed reality on the planet, it was the archetypal Garden of Eden and indeed did possess a Sacred Garden area. This was the Temple in which they worshipped, not Nature, but all of Life and the spirit of Creation itself. Modern man’s desire to get back to ‘nature’ is often a cellular memory reflecting this desire to be at Oneness as we were back in the early days of Lemuria.
As for Adam and Eve in the Garden, there have been all told, five instances that could be looked upon as the allegorical Creation of Adam. RAJ and HAROON were the first Creation—the first ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’ from which the other Creator Sons and Infinite Mother Spirits were derived. Enjliou and Callia as the first pair of this Universe, manifesting all those that came after them, could be called the second Adam and Eve. ARTOLA was the third ‘Adam,’ the first Creation within this Universe from Enjliou and Callia. The fourth Adam is the one described by Cayce in this next life reading. They are called thought forms because they were projections of the Creator Son of the Universe, Enjliou, in his desire to go forward with Creation and populate the world. They are simply called Enjliou Beings.
“. . . from among the many physical shapes and sizes that resulted from the mixtures, he selected the form of the present man as the most suitable vehicle for physical manifestation on this planet. He then projected himself into five centers at once as Adam, the first man, choosing the five necessary expressions because of the five physical senses to be conquered before spiritual consciousness could be reached.
“These five projections appeared simultaneously in five places on the earth. The white race appeared in the region of the Carpathian Mountains, the black race appeared in the upper African region, the brown in Lemuria, the red in Atlantis, and the yellow in the Gobi.
“. . . problems arose almost immediately, as many of these beings used their new physical bodies for self-indulgence. These thought forms hardened into true physical bodies that parodied the animal life of that era, producing grotesque results. They may even have mixed with the animal life of that period.”
Some of Cayce’s readings speak of the humanoid creatures with animal attributes such as tails, feathers, fins, fur, scales, and hooves, even dwarfs and giants:



123
“The more these souls succumbed to sensual pleasure by gratifying their own selfish desires at other’s expense, the less able they became to move freely out of their physical bodies. At last they became trapped in them from birth to death, and many forgot or ignored their relationship to the Maker.”
The Yellow race that is mentioned as being placed in the Gobi Desert, is often mentioned in the same breath as Lemuria, but in fact it is the civilization called the Uighers, who flourished in the once fertile lands in Central Asia. Hardly anything remains of this once great civilization, for its ruins now lie buried beneath the boulders and sediment left by massive glaciers as they scoured the planet clean during the past Ice Age.
The Black race are those mentioned earlier as the Varkas Kings of Africa.
Cayce clearly identified the white race as originating in the Caucasus region of Asia, in agreement with modern anthropological thought. When asked to clarify the location, he said:
“The white—rather in the Carpathians than India . . . Southern part of Europe and Russia, and Persia and that land. Caucasian mountains” (no. 364-13, November 17, 1932).
The white race are those who later moved into Europe and whose survivors became the nomadic tribes that formed the basis of today’s Caucasian peoples—the word ‘Caucasian’ clearly stemming from that region in which they originated, the Caucasus Mountains.
The Red race were the Atlanteans, whom we shall speak more about in the following chapter.
The Brown race, known as Lemurians, inhabited a continent so large that it took up much of the Pacific Ocean, as well as great parts of Eastern Asia and Russia, and some of the Western states of North America. Lemuria, often referred to as MU, was truly the beginning of modern man as we know him. It is also referred to as the Motherland, and remnants of it are coming to light everyday as explorers uncover the ruins of strange stone temples lying beneath the waters of the blue Pacific, off the islands which constituted mountain peaks of the now submerged continent, and in the remote jungles of these same islands. People from the Philippines, Polynesia, and Bali, are often remnants of those ancient tribes of Mu.
A 2,000 year old document, the original of which was once written on the skin of an animal, has been handed down to the Takeuchis of the Ibaragi Prefecture in Japan. Known as the Takeuchi Document, it consisted of several thousand documents, and wares like "Agatama" -made of the bones of early emperors. Among what are purported to be the bones of Christ, the Ten Commandment Stones of Moses, and a mystery metal known as "Hihiirokane," are also said to be maps of the ancient continent of Mu. According to the document, at one time the whole world was ruled by Sumeramikoto tribes, flown from the "country of Heaven's globe."
It was around 400,000 BC that a major magnetic pole shift on the planet turned the planet around within hours, freezing hairy mammoths where they stood, fresh green leaves still in there mouths. This pole shift totally changed the face of the planet. Of the original seeds from other planets who were here at the time, very few survived. Scientists are discovering these pole shifts are a more regular occurrence than once thought, and have the potential of wiping out all life on the planet in the course of a single day or night. There occurrence would normally set back evolution for millions of years if the basic Darwinian evolutionary theory held true.
Although seeded much earlier, and in existence at the time of that major pole shift, Lemuria truly only began to be a cohesive civilization 200,000 years ago. Words such as ‘mutant’, which



124
means ‘Earth-spawned creature,’ and ‘commune’ or ‘community’ have their origins in the word ‘Mu’, describing the nature of the relationship these people had with each other and with their surroundings.
It was truly a paradise, an existence of beauty and harmony, as we might think of the Biblical Garden of Eden. Soul was free to enter the physical and also leave at will. It was very much a peaceful type of existence. The Lemurians themselves were much like one thinks of an idyllic tribe of Native American Indians. They were intensely spiritual, and rejected technological advancements for the very simplicities of nature.
The most famous promoter of lost Lemuria was Colonel James Churchward. Churchward spent 50 years of his life researching the continent and writing a series of books exploring its various aspects, including its effects on world civilization in modern times. Churchward says he gained much of his information from the Naacal Tablets found in Mexico, tablets that are said to be more than 12,000 years old themselves.
While many of Churchward’s ideas have there basis in fact, he, like Zechariah Sitchin, failed to take into account the other mitigating factors that were taking place on the planet at the same time. This can be the problem with people having too narrow an area of specialization. The tendency is to relate everything they discover to their own one area. While Lemuria indeed did play a major role in the formation of many aspects of our early culture, because the continent broke up long before the last remnants of Atlantis did, its influences are largely forgotten. Or, if not forgotten, then purposely buried ‘in plain sight.’
Lemuria was, indeed, the Motherland, and as Cayce suggests, each race that was originally seeded at that time had a different aspect of spiritual growth to work with related to the five physical senses. The Lemurians had an emotional nature—thus it was called ‘the Motherland.’ They were less aggressive, more intuitive, more artistic and concerned with the creative side of their being, as well as being more in tune with the planet and their surroundings. The Atlanteans who co-existed with the Lemurians for a long period of time were the primal source of ‘the Fatherland’ mentality.
Later when these two cultures ‘clashed’, it was an archetypal battle of the mother versus the father, the artist mentality versus the scientific mentality; a war of the left hemisphere of the brain versus the right hemisphere. Whereas the Earth was ‘created’ to bring all the various aspects of the Civilizations into a Oneness of being, so too could these two cultures have merged rather than have clashed. This would have created a more balanced emotional/mental being who would have fulfilled more of the purpose of the planet, bringing humanity into a state of physical and spiritual balance.
In looking at these archetypes of the Mother versus the Father inherent in these two types of culture, Joseph Campbell makes the mistake of assuming that the one came out of or followed the other. He associates hunting with a primary period dominated by the males, and a secondary period of planting overseen by the females:
“And the role of women (in planting) has perhaps already been greatly enhanced, both socially and symbolically; for whereas in the hunting period the chief contributors to the sustenance of the tribes had been the men and the role of the women had been largely that of drudges, now the female’s economic contributions were of first importance. She participated



125
perhaps even predominated—in the planting and reaping of the crops, and, as the mother of life and nourisher of life, was thought to assist the earth symbolically in its productivity.”
Campbell goes on to link hunting with the patriarchal stage of society and planting with the matriarchal one, not realizing that in fact the matriarchal stage came first, and the patriarchal stage was a later development, especially in terms of religion, as we shall see in this and later chapters. Campbell also makes the mistake of following human evolution from the ‘savagery’ stage into the ‘civilized’ stage as educational propaganda teaches us, rather than the other way around as it truly was.
After cataclysms such as pole shifts, floods, and the breakup of continents have destroyed earth’s past civilizations, the survivors have had great difficulty in preserving any of their higher civilization, but rather they have had to revert back to a survival level in which the basics of life had to be met first, basics such as food, clothing, and shelter.
Churchward, on the other hand, is adamant that, contrary to scientific beliefs about the origins of mankind, “savagery came out of civilization, not civilization out of savagery.” He asserts that he is not alone in this stand, “for it is only those who know nothing of savages who maintain that civilization emerged from savagery.”
“The assertion that the more crude and primitive a stone arrow or spear head is, the more highly civilized were the people who made them, may seem illogical on its face; but think—carry your mind back to ancient times, and see how man was repeatedly robbed of everything except his bare hands, and thrown entirely on nature’s resources. Tools and everything else were gone; absolutely nothing was left except the brains and the fingers of the survivors. Without the slightest knowledge of mechanics, these remnants had to commence making tools out of nothing but the stones at their feet. Could anything but the crudest forms be fashioned by them without experience and without knowledge? I think not. To me, these crude arrow and spear heads do not show savagery or a low civilization. They show a high civilization passing down into savagery. Thus the scientist’s Paleolithic men were of a higher civilization than the Neolithic men who followed them, and as the manufacture improved these human beings went down.”
Campbell at least recognizes that in times past, such as on Lemuria, the land itself has been very lush and self-supporting, what he calls ‘the tropical gardening cultures, and that men were food gathers more than they were ‘hunters’.
“. . . A very different course of development is to be traced, however, in the sphere of the tropical gardening cultures, where a third type or stage of social organization matured that was almost completely antithetical to that of the hunting peoples. For in these areas it was the women, not the men, who enjoyed the magico-religious and social advantage, they having been the ones to effect the transition from plant-collecting to plant-cultivation. . . Thus they won both economic and social power and prestige, and the complex of the matriarchy took form.”
Campbell indicates his recognition of the two areas of growth patterns in matriarchal versus patriarchal evolution in his books: Patriarchy precedes matriarchy in Masks: Primitive; and matriarchy precedes patriarchy in Masks: Occidental, perhaps, himself, suggesting the growth of two separate ways of life on two separate sides of the globe.
It is not true that Mu and Atlantis were one and the same cultures just on separate continents. While some of the beings who were seeded on both continents came from the same



126
civilizations, they were in truth very, very different. Even as Cayce suggests, one was the red race (the Atlanteans), and the other the brown race (the Lemurians). The Nine say that many Lemurians were from Ashan (the planet of the artists), and many of the Atlanteans were from Altea (the planet of technology).
According to Churchward, there were ten distinct tribes in the Motherland itself. These tribes were easily differentiated physically, and these physical tribal differences are still evident in the various remnants of the tribes scattered throughout the Pacific. There were few variations in their language, however, and these were only minor in character. A greater change is seen in their glyphs or writings. Before the Tower of Babel incident, much of the planet spoke what is referred to as the Universal language, a very musical tonal language, aspects of which can still be heard in many southeast Asian languages. This is referred to in the Bible, Genesis 1:11, “Now the whole earth had one language and few words.”
The channeled entity Ramtha was at one time in his past earthly incarnations, a Lemurian, and speaks of being treated like an animal by the arrogant Atlantean warriors.
Relics that can be traced back as coming directly from Mu, the Motherland, are extremely rare. Churchward says that he was singularly fortunate in finding two that were at least intimately connected with Mu. Both are symbolic figures in bronze, made either in the Motherland or in one of the ancient Uighur cities “before the eastern half of that great empire was destroyed by the north running wave of the last Magnetic Cataclysm which was the ‘Biblical Flood.’”
The Flood destroyed all the countryside over which it ran, according to Churchward, the people being drowned and the cities washed away or buried under the drift. Incorrectly he relates the demise of Uighur to the Flood, rather than to the earlier incidence of the Ice Age:
“The Uighur Capital City today lies under fifty feet of boulders , gravel and sand. It is situated in the Gobi Desert, which today has large areas of rock only, the soil and everything with it having been washed away by the flood.”
Churchward’s greatest contribution to the study of Lemuria, besides making others cognizant of its existence, was in the field of its symbology. Much of this symbology can, he suggests, still be seen in use commonly today.
“I will first take the symbol, the Royal Escutcheon of Mu, the empire of the Sun—a sun with eight rays. The particular design . . . given was found on the dress of a Kootenay Indian living in British Columbia. The border of the dress of another Kootenay Indian was composed of a continuation of one of the symbols of “Mu submerged.” The garment with the sun symbol was black, the sun in pale yellow, the points of the rays in pale indigo blue and the intervening space between the sun and the points of its rays a pale reddish pink.”
Such eight pointed sun symbols appear on various religious edifices, spread around the world, and is still a major symbol in the secret societies who like to trace their origins to this early period in modern man’s history.
Besides the already mentioned archetypal differences between Atlantis and Lemuria, there was also the archetypal battle of religion versus science, or the priest versus the scientist.
In their religion, Lemuria did not worship the sun as might be assumed from the example of symbology given above, though it may be taken as the forerunner of many other ‘sunworshipping’ civilizations. In portraying the sun, the Lemurians were actually paying homage to



127
the One God who created all. In their religion, they were very ‘matriarchal,’ being very grounded in the earth and in nature. In the sun symbology they were, however, also worshiping the patriarchal side of Creation. That which was above in the highest of all worlds, the FATHER, was represented by the sun. Thus, in the union of the two, they were portraying the balancing of the two which, as we have said, is the spiritual purpose of the Earth—the balancing of the physical and the spiritual.
As with everything they do, the secret societies have now usurped this symbol and used it in the reverse of its originally intended meaning. Thus the sun represents their idea of the Highest God—Lucifer, Prince of the Morning, attempting as they are to supplant the rightful Father, Enjliou, with the pretender to the throne. The supplantation of a rightful heir is an archetype for so much of history’s great literature, much of which is also related to the New World Order as it has spread over the millennia.
The Kahunas, the high priesthood or shamans of Hawaii, are remnants of this primal religion of Lemuria--the Law of One. Curiously enough they are also a mixture of the primal religion with that of ancient Judaism, with the Jewish tribe of Cohen —‘hakkohen’ – the priesthood, ancient travelers to faraway places.
The bringing of religion to the earth has created most of its troubles. And it was in Lemuria that many of these troubles had their initial seeds. The Nine explain that, in the beginning, it was necessary to have a structured form of religion, but the error was that those who became the priesthood, began to use their position to have control over others, and to make themselves more important than the understanding of the religion.
This occurred during the last stages of the high civilization that Lemuria had once been, about 50,000 years ago, and coincides with the time when Lucifer, squarely set his sights on the control of planet Earth. It is here where the ‘underground stream’ of our story really has its source, for it is here where the ancient mystical rites began to be practiced simultaneously with those on Atlantis. This was under the auspices of the Dark Sorcerer Kings who were eventually responsible for the destruction of the last remaining island of that once great continental empire they had created. And it is also here that Freemasonry has its often admitted roots in these ancient mysteries, and indeed in the worship of the Dark Forces.
This control by the priesthood, did not start with the Annunaki in Sumeria, as Sitchin suggests, but rather on these two continents prior to the emergence of the priesthood in the Middle East. The priesthood, or intercessors with God, are also not unknown in other realms of the Universe. They have been a necessary part of focussing attention on the higher aspects of existence. As the Nine suggest, though, they often have chosen the path of Power over Love.
This has not changed throughout recorded history either, and the Nine say that even the preponderance of New Age religions are “the old attempting to take the new and mould it in its own dimension.” This, they say, is caused out of doubt and out of fear.
Although many New Agers will not want to hear it, many aspects of there movement are, indeed, the equivalent of putting a new slant on old ways, using new words for old concepts, all in the name of gaining power and control. This is an idea which has been heavily used in marketing, where, for instance, an old romance novel can be given a new title and a new decorative cover in order to make people buy it once again. Because the formulas inherent in a romance novel are pretty much standard, the buyer therefore does not realize that they have bought and read that



128
story before. The formulas in religion can be utilized over and over again just as those in old romance novels can. Give them a new name and a new look, and people will also buy into them all over again.
Kryon puts it this way: “Ceremony is the partner to repetition. It overcomes the human trait to always want something new. It helps provide for the same needed process to be repeated accurately each time. It often cloaks accurate, truthful processes in the veil of religion.
“I have spoken often of the seed fears that you all carry, such as being discounted or abandoned, being alone, and failing or falling short of what is expected. These fears are common to all.”
Mankind does not need an intermediary between himself and heaven. The FATHER is with us at every moment of the day, and while we may need a guide to set us on the right course, a true spiritual guide will always set us free once we are firmly connected to the Ever-Loving Source within us.
The advanced spiritual nature of the Lemurians could have been a positive influence upon Atlantis, but Atlantis felt they were the superior culture. Atlantis felt that they could be the ones to bring the 'good' to Lemuria.
For a time the interchange between Lemuria and Atlantis was fascinating. While the Lemurians had never had a desire to create the man-made objects of beauty the Atlanteans possessed, they were fascinated with this new type of beauty. Here was a totally new unexplored area of creativity that was previously unknown to Lemurians. Being an intelligent species of consciousness with a curiosity and a free will to explore, the Lemurians 'wanted to know'.
Although the Lemurians desired to share their spiritual culture with the Atlanteans, the Atlanteans had little interest in the Lemurian way of life. They felt far more advanced with their technological skills. The Atlantean technology became the dominant power and eventually a way of life for Lemuria. The idyllic setting of Lemuria began to disintegrate.
Lemurians could not communicate with Atlanteans in the beginning because Lemurians did not have a verbal language, and Atlanteans did not know how to communicate on a total conscious basis. The Atlanteans also did not have the purity of heart of the more spiritual Lemurians. They would have never wanted their thoughts to be known.
The Lemurians therefore began to learn the Atlantean language and how to verbally communicate. This of course took time to develop but eventually they moved from thought communication to verbal communication. They chose to not share open conscious thought communication any longer as their own thoughts were less pure. There was a great influx of new ideas, new thoughts, and new ways to do things. It now took more of a construct in the social order of government. Life was not as simple as it once was. This change in society didn't happen overnight. The degeneration of the Lemurian society took time, but it did happen.
As the integration of the two cultures took place Atlantis felt the need to bring "the culture of civilization" to Lemuria. Lemuria attempted to share their beautiful natural spirit with Atlantis but the Atlanteans couldn't begin to conceive that what the Lemurians offered could ever contribute to a better way of life.
Those of us who were incarnate during these days of Lemuria, and that includes most of the original starseeds, have a remembrance in our consciousness of struggle. Often what is found



129
with Lemurians is great internal struggle. They have great struggle between what they're really here to achieve and what they actually do with their life. There is great struggle, because there is so much of the fear that Kryon first spoke about.
Also remember that many souls lived on both of these worlds---both Atlantis and Lemuria at one time or another. Those souls that mostly experienced Lemuria find themselves more in a state of questioning. They want to know. Or they say 'show me the way.' They most likely will ask for guidance, not trusting themselves in their spiritual guidance. That is simply because they don't know how they lost their connection to their spiritual consciousness to begin with. They do not quite know what happened. So they don't really know how to find their way back.
Atlanteans may not know either but they don't know they don't know. So they just go about their business and they'll find their way because they don't know they can't do it. Of course all souls can open to their spiritual consciousness. Lemurians on the other hand question 'what happened?' and 'did I cause it?' and 'did I do something I can't remember that caused great pain?' They often have a heavy heart about the choices they've made in life. Many times they are their own worst enemy in finding that for which they seek. If you lived during the time of Lemuria you are a very old soul. You know the true essence of life. Allow your soul to connect with your spirit, you will remember the way. Always remember you are a point of consciousness expressing your own unique beauty. It is an ever evolving beauty, different from yesterday, different from Lemuria, but always beautiful.
Lemuria, like Atlantis, broke up in stages, some of it happening gradually, other stages happening cataclysmically in the space of a few short months. The archetypal memories of these kind of events are brought into modern culture through such movies as Superman. It is the breakup of Superman’s home planet Krypton that leaves him as the only survivor on a strange and hostile world.
The final small remnants of the Lemurian continent sunk when the seas were raised during the time when that side of the planet took the full force of the Great Flood washing over it, as described earlier in this chapter, and which shall be dealt with in more detail later.
Brother Philip describes a time about 30,000 years ago when a major portion of what was left of the Lemurian continent, broke up and sank beneath the waves. This sinking was both the result of and a contributor to, the highly active and very unstable Ring of Fire, a zone of volcanic and seismic activity which circles the Pacific Rim for a distance of almost 24,000 miles. In the description of these events, he also mentions the founding of his order by the Lemurians under Aramu-Muru in a monastery in a valley of the high Andes mountains:
“While the final portions of the former continent were breaking up in the Pacific Ocean, terrible catastrophe was taking place all over the Earth. The Andean Range of mountains was born at this time, and disfigured the west coast of South America. The ancient city of Tiahuanaco (Bolivia) was at the time a great seaport and a Lemurian Empire colonial city of magnificence and importance to the Motherland. During the ensuing cataclysms it was raised from sea level and a mild, tropical climate to high on a barren, wind-swept plain and a frigid arctic-like climate. Before this took place, there had been no Lake Titicaca, which is now the highest navigable lake in the world, over twelve thousand feet above sea level.
“So it was to a newly-formed lake that Lord Muru arrived from sunken Lemuria. Here, now known as Lago Titicaca, the Monastery of the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays came into being,



130
organized and perpetuated by Aramu-Muru. This Monastery, which was to be the home of the Brotherhood throughout all ages on Earth, was placed in an immense valley that had been created during the days of the birth of the Andes, and was a strange child of Nature in that its exact disposition and altitude gave it a warm semi-tropical climate where fruits and nuts could grow to phenomenal size. Here, on top of ruins that had once been at sea level, like the City of Tiahuanaco, Lord Muru had the Monastery constructed of gigantic blocks of stone cut only by the energy of primary light force. This cyclopean structure is the same today as it was then, and continues to be a repository of Lemurian science, culture, and arcane knowledge.”
In a lecture on the Realm of the Ring Lords, Laurence Gardner says that it had long been known that a continent existed, inhabited by a great king-tribe, which was noted for its lemurs. Hence, it has been dubbed 'Lemuria.'
One of the most surprising things about these Scythian Ring Lords, he says, is that their preserved remains from thousands of years ago (discovered even as far north as Siberia) show their bodies substantially tattooed with ring-tailed lemurs. Lemurs, which we are told by modern science, are native to (and pretty much restricted to) Madagascar and the Comoros Islands off Mozambique - but here they are in Northern Europe and the Black Sea regions!
It is Gardner’s idea that the mightiest Lemurian land tract was never lost, it being the great mainland continent which still exists today - stretching across eastern Europe through the onetime USSR. He is, as said, confusing some of this with the Uighur civilization. The original massive continent did cover some of this area, however. Those he describes in this following passage are the Uigher warriors themselves, and the Uigher civilization, what little is known of it, confused by the addition of the Lemurian symbol of the lemurs.
The two were ‘trading partners’, although the warlike Uighers were more often creating wars upon those they thought of as lesser than them in the peaceful island continent of Lemuria.
“This was the original realm of the great Ring Lords - tracing back to about 40,000 BC - the homeland of the Oupires (the similarity to Uighers) of the Pict-sidhé. It was the land of the mighty Warlords of the Dragon before they migrated and battled their way southwards in the ever cooling climate of the last Ice Age. Undoubtedly, the environment was once very warm there, as is proved by the fact that the lemurs traveled about as far south as they could possibly go by land before Madagascar and the Comoros broke away from the southern African mainland.
“What did these early God-kings look like? Well, they are now thoroughly identifiable from their preserved remains, which have been excavated at various sites from as far afield as Transylvania and Tibet. With their light-brown to red hair and pale eyes, the leather-clad men stood at least 6ft 6ins and upwards, while even the women were over 6ft tall. Undoubtedly, these forebears of the Gaelic and Celtic High-kings were among the most awesome warriors of all history.”
Lemuria remains more of a mystery in many ways than any of the other cultures or civilizations we have talked about. It was a golden age of Mankind upon the planet that like all of them, gradually falls into decay. It was the origin of many races which still exist in the Pacific Rim areas, and even of some of the Native American Indian tribes themselves. Its significance to us right now, here in this book, is that it was also the source of much that was Dark in terms of the symbolism and eventual purpose of the secret societies and the influence of Lucifer here on this planet today.

Chapter 9 -- The First Budding of Atlantis
To most people, Atlantis was an island once located somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean which sank overnight in some terrible cataclysmic event. Very few people realize, however, that in its original form, Atlantis was actually a large continent which spread all the way from Eastern Europe to the eastern seaboard of North America, and south into Africa. The Canary Islands and the Azores, both of which are volcanic island chains, are the tips of what were once the mighty Atlantean mountain peaks. The Bahamas and Bermuda were also once a part of this same great continent.
The Decline of Lemuria
The interaction between the two great continents of Lemuria and Atlantis grew as both their cultures grew and expanded. As generations passed there became a great intermingling between them. Neither culture lost their identity totally, nor was either as separated or as isolated, or as pure in their own particular ideology as they were once before. Their lives and culture became comingled. The Atlanteans and Lemurians even inter-married in the latter days. Both cultures began to live a different way of life.
Eventually the Lemurians no longer knew how to leave the consciousness of their body. There were only ancient stories told among the people of how the animals used to die and flowers were placed around them. They could not really remember because it was only stories handed down as ancient myths and legends. As generation after generation after generation passed, neither Lemuria nor Atlantis remembered the totality of who they were. Atlantis became the epitome of technological living. Lemuria, on the other hand, was the epitome of spiritual consciousness and naturally idyllic living. Would that they had brought the best of both worlds together as the cultures co-mingled, however, they did not.
The continent of Lemuria grew 'sad' at the loss of what once was. A kind of heaviness fell over the people. The spiritual beauty of their world no longer existed. The people no longer knew the joy in their heart that they had once shared. There were no longer days of melodious sounds flowing on the gentle breezes throughout the land. The Temples of Learning fell into disarray. The people no longer visited the once beautiful and sacred temples. They didn't enter into their crystal chambers for now they had Atlantean technology. The technology now provided their method of learning but it was not the same. They lost the wondrous identity of Lemuria. The time came that the very essence that had sustained Lemuria could not exist any longer and Lemuria virtually ceased to exist.
The Origins of Atlantis
To trace back further the origins of the Atlantean civilization, we need to go back to the time of the decimation of Mars and Maldek somewhere around 100,000 years ago, as described earlier. It was many of the survivors of this conflagration escaping the embattled planets before the one was destroyed and the other made virtually lifeless, who came to planet Earth, and were then responsible for the founding of the Atlantean civilization.
The recent release by NASA of some 20,000 new images taken over the past year or so by the Mars Global Surveyor are already being scrutinized by Mars researchers in hopes that some of the images may hold additional evidence of proving the existence of ancient intelligent life on the planet. Experts on the subject estimate that a life-supporting atmosphere probably existed on



132
Mars some 3 million years ago, at least, though they do not recognize how much more recently this planet teemed with a highly evolved civilization. Assuming that whatever life might have been there would have developed and survived under conditions similar to our own, any artificial structures they built would have undergone millennia of erosion, and would likely be at this point, severely degraded and either mostly or partially buried in the sands of Mars, though ‘the face on Mars’ and possible pyramids rivaling those of Egypt already seem to be quite evident. In an Arizona State University news release of June 23, 2000, it was suggested that Mars also once had Earth-like oceans at some period in its history:
“Thanks to NASA's unmanned planetary exploration program, evidence of the existence of past oceans on Mars has been accumulating for years, but no one had ever been able to say what the overall chemical composition of those oceans might actually have been like -- until now.
“A recent analysis of the interior of a 1.2 billion-year-old Martian meteorite known as the Nakhla Meteorite has shown the presence of water-soluble ions that are thought to have been deposited in cracks by evaporating brine, according to a study by Arizona State University Regents Professor of Chemistry and Geology Carleton Moore, Douglas Sawyer of Scottsdale Community College, ASU graduate student Michael McGehee and Julie Canepa of Los Alamos National Laboratory. The finding, announced in the July issue of the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, indicates that ancient Martian oceans had a mineral composition similar in variety and concentration to Earth oceans.
"We have concluded that we have extracted salts that were originally present in Martian water," said Moore. "The salts we found mimic the salts in Earth's ocean fairly closely."
The memories of Atlantis in the collective unconscious of those on planet Earth are very deeply engrained and very much repressed, for they are memories of great traumas, not just of the destruction of one civilization, but of three. They are also very real warnings of the potential for the destruction of a fourth civilization, indeed an entire world, simply because we refuse to recognize and deal with this potent force in our history.
It is because the story of Atlantis holds up such a mirror to us and to the culture that exists today on Earth that we keep denying its existence. Is it any wonder then that we also let ourselves be so easily duped into believing the histories of our race which make no sense, and that leave great gaping holes, and thousands of unanswered questions? In refusing to acknowledge the mistakes we have made in the past, to learn from our history, we are also intent on giving away our individual power once again, both consciously and unconsciously, to those same beings who were responsible for this earlier destruction in the first place.
Exciting new evidence of Atlantis’ existence is to be found in recent studies of the weather patterns of Northern Europe. These weather patterns rely on the Gulf Stream, the warm current of the North Atlantic Ocean flowing in a generally northeastern direction from the Straits of Florida to the Grand Banks, east and south of Newfoundland. This Stream then extends its flow from the Grand Banks to the shores of western Europe, Scandinavia, and the islands of the Arctic Ocean in the form of the North Atlantic Drift. The Gulf Stream is of great climatological importance because of its moderating effects on the climate of western Europe. In northeastern America a crop like rye, nonresistant to frost, can only be cultivated up to 50 degrees north latitude. In Norway, it can be cultivated up to a 20 degrees higher latitude. This is also true of wheat and potato crops, and the northern limits beyond which horses, mules, and sheep cannot be kept. The



133
inhospitable arctic regions which begin at 55 degrees latitude in eastern America, do not start until 70 degrees north latitude in Norway. Unaffected by the Gulf Stream, Labrador is sub-arctic though at the same latitude as England.
If the Gulf Stream’s influence were removed, by, say a large continental island in the middle of the Atlantic such as Atlantis was supposed to have been, it would mean that the climate of north-western Europe would undergo a radical change, and would then become normal for that kind of latitude.
During the Pleistocene Epoch of Earth’s history, there was about the same amount of ice cover to the east of the Atlantic as there was to the west. Both continents were buried under huge ice caps that occasionally reached as far down as 50 degrees north latitude. The limits of glaciation leave their mark in the form of piled up rock called terminal moraines. The belts of terminal moraines found in Canada and Europe, which indicate the southern limit of advance of inland ice sheets, clearly show that during the Ice Age northwestern Europe did not enjoy a better climate than northeastern America. Thus it can be concluded that the Gulf Stream did not flow or did not reach northwest Europe during that time, blocked as it would have been at the time by the remaining islands of Atlantis.
Experts differ as to exactly when the Earth moved into its fifth geological age. Experts using different criteria place the time from 20,000 to 8,000 years ago. One scientist counting the bands of Swedish varved clay, arrived at an “optimum” of 12,000 to 10,000 years BC, the time when the final remnants of Atlantis were supposed to have sunk beneath the ocean. This means that much of England and most of Northern Europe only became hospitable for human habitation after the sinking of Atlantis. As we can see from recorded history, this is exactly the time when civilization began to take root on the European continent.
It is also postulated that the Mayans, being one of the outerlying colonies of Atlantis which survived the global changes of that time, date their calendar from the destruction of Atlantis . . . June 5, 8498 BC, just as the Romans began counting their calendar from the founding of Rome and the Christians from the birth of Christ.
Edgar Cayce’s Atlantis readings are important to a concept of our history, not only because they were given to help individuals, but also because they were given to help mankind. They point out very strongly the cyclical nature of history—those things which we do not learn from and which keep cropping up again and again until we learn their hard lessons. In the case of the life readings dealing with past incarnations in Atlantis then, the problems described seem to have a special urgency, a special relevance to the events going on today.
According to Cayce, many of the people he did readings for who lived in Atlantis were active, influential, and capable individuals. His suggestion in these readings, however, is that these past Atlanteans are once again incarnating on the planet in hope that they may once again be able to greatly influence the world events currently taking place—that is, to right some wrongs, to heal some old wounds, and potentially to divert the course of world events away from further destruction.
Much has been written about Atlantis, but it is Ignatius Donnelly in particular who, much like Churchward for Lemuria, is the best-known proponent of its existence. As W. Scott-Elliot says of Donnelly’s arguments for the existence of Atlantis, they excited a good deal of interest and respect when he made them in 1882. Today, however, they would probably be dismissed by



134
almost all scientists and scholars as the result of “overgeneralization, exaggeration, and unsupported imagination.”
Donnelly’s major supposition was that similarities found in various corners of the world have to be explained by a common historical origin. To Scott-Elliot, however, many of the similarities Donnelly found were simply superficial matters, and any evidence which did not fit into his particular theory, Donnelly tended to ignore. Repeating the mistake that Churchward made with regard to Lemuria, and Sitchin made in his study of the Annunaki of ancient Sumeria, Donnelly attributes everything he sees in the various regions of the planet to the single influence of Atlantis. Thus he ignores the other influences which had also been taking place on the planet throughout history.
Donnelly calls Atlantis ‘the place of origin of modern humanity,’ and its disappearance therefore all the more poignant, involving as it does the loss of ‘our homeland.’ He correctly deduces that the destruction of Atlantis happened in stages, talking about the number of great catastrophes which have shaken the world. The first of these took place in the Miocene age, about 800,000 years ago; the second, of minor importance, occurring about 200,000 years ago; and the third, about 80,000 years ago, being a very great one which sank a fairly large piece of the massive Atlantean continent. This last date, however, is incorrect, the correct timing being approximately 100,000 years ago, coinciding with the explosion of the planet Maldek, an event whose impact, as you can imagine, was felt throughout the entire solar system. Although it did not sink the major part of the Atlantean continent, it did have great impact on the shape of the land masses on the planet at that time. And, as was previously explained, it was only prior to this catastrophe that colonizers from Mars and Maldek came to planet Earth and began what was to eventually become the great Atlantean Empire.
Donnelly is correct, however, in dating the sinking of the final stages of Atlantis. The large island, to which Plato gave the name Poseidonis, was submerged in the fourth and final great catastrophe of 9564 BC, an event that it’s inhabitants had also helped to create.
In the life readings in which Cayce mentions Atlantis, his dating of its break up is far more accurate than most of those available from other sources. Cayce recounts three major periods of earth changes involving volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tidal waves, and sinking land occurring between 50,000 and 10,000 BC. The first of these events took place in his opinion around 50,000 BC, when a portion of the continent was destroyed. The second occurred around 28,000 BC, when the remaining land was split into islands. The final destruction occurred around 10,000 BC, when the last islands were submerged, undoubtedly the destruction to which Plato later referred.
It was paradoxically around 50,000 BC that Atlantis reached the height of its civilization. This coincides with the first cataclysmic earth change that broke up the continent, and thus caused a split in the rulership of the Empire into two separate realms. It is also the time when what we shall call ‘the Lucifer Intrusion’ began in earnest on the planet. Its effects on Atlantis can be traced through the literature available as the Empire finally began to sink into worship of the occult, black magic, and sorcery. The people were controlled through the implantation of crystal transmitters, and the use of these dark forces eventually led to the final destruction of the center of Atlantean civilization.



135
The Early Civilization
The early stages of the Atlantean empire’s growth are far less well-known than the circumstances of its demise. According to Cayce, Atlantis was one of the places where human beings first appeared on Earth. He is, however, referring to modern man, to that time 100,000 years ago when ‘man’ as we know it began on the planet, the time before which there were great differences in the kinds of lifeforms on the planet, the time when the planet was still solidly fixed in a higher dimensional state.
Biochemists Allan Wilson, Mark Stoneking, and Rebecca Cann of the University of California at Berkley, studied the evolutionary relationships between racial groups by looking at the genes in the mitochondria, the components of human cells inherited only from the mother. By comparing differences among races, and estimating the rates of genetic change, they concluded that all living humans are descended from a common maternal ancestor, ‘EVE’, who lived approximately 200,000 years ago. All living humans share these same genes, and the divergence among races, according to their study, has occurred since that time. This would place ‘the origins’ of Man, back somewhere around the beginning of Lemuria and the early settlement of Atlantis.
According to the Nine, Atlantis was a colony which was developed by the Alteans, the civilization of Altea, and Ramtha also agrees. These are the race especially known for their technology--not a technology of machines so much, but a technology to do with the fundamental nature of matter. Cayce says Atlantis was the place where human beings made their most rapid advancements toward what we consider civilization, and it was “the place where the problems created for themselves came into the sharpest focus.”
Since some of this technology was brought with the survivors from Maldek and Mars, and other technology was brought from Sirius during the time of the Empire, the Atlantean colony had much to get started with, and even more to work on. Unfortunately, some of those who survived and came to this planet were also the instigators of those original troubles that had caused the eventual destruction of these two planets in the first place.
Cayce characterized Atlantis as the Motherland of Civilization where the earliest religion was a solar-oriented monotheism (Sons of the Law of One), which makes sense since the religious center of Lemurian worship was ‘The Law of One,’ and Atlantis as it turned toward the Dark Side and Lucifer, worshipped him who was considered to be the ‘the Son’ or ‘Sun’(‘sun’ being a corruption of the original word ‘son’, still spelled in many languages with an ‘o’—del sol, die sohhne, etc.). The sun as a central symbol is, paradoxically, so much a part of the Dark side’s literature and its symbolism, again with the eight separate rays much as it was originally used in Atlantis.
Much of what we know of life in Atlantis beyond its awesome technology comes to us from Homer and from Plato. The poetry of Homer may in fact be a priceless document of an early civilization transplanted to the Mediterranean region from Atlantis, for it is doubtful that Homer created such a vast civilization strictly out of fantasy. The Homeric civilization as described in his poetry, could be essentially that of an Atlantean island lying near Gibraltar. From there it spread its influence throughout the entire Mediterranean area, as we know from other literature that it once spread to all four corners of the globe.
The earliest setting of Atlantis seems to be a land much richer in nature than that of anywhere today. Dark evergreens towered over serene meadows surrounded by sculptured



136
mountains. Lions, leopards and wild boar roamed the woods along with bear, deer and fox, while perennial springs supplied fresh, clean water to both the men and also to the animals.
Cayce’s description of the climate was that, rather than being a tropical area, it was “more of the temperate . . .” (no, 5750-1, November 12, 1933). Our knowledge of the climates in that area in 10,000 BC confirms that this would have been the weather around that time. The glaciers were still melting, and all of North America was substantially colder than it is now.
In The Critias, Plato describes the actual layout of the cities and countryside, a sacred formula harmonizing with the universe, and used to maintain growth in both the people and in the land. Like the old Arthurian legend that will play such a big part of our story,” the people and the land are one.” This sacred form was brought to the planet with the starseeds. It consisted of a series of concentric circles built around the central temple complex, as described here by Plato:
“And outside, round about the temple, there stood images in gold of all the princes, both themselves and their wives, as many as were descended from the ten kings, together with many other votive offerings both of the kings and of private persons not only from the State itself but also from all the foreign peoples over whom they rule. And that altar, in respect of its size and its workmanship, harmonized with its surroundings; and the royal palace likewise was such as befitted the greatness of the kingdom, and equally befitted the splendor of the temples.
“. . . Such then was the state of things round about the abode of the kings. And after crossing the three outer harbors one found a wall which began at the sea and ran around in a circle, at a uniform distance of fifty stades from the largest circle and harbour, and its ends converged at the seaward mouth of the channel. The whole of this wall had numerous houses built onto it, set close together; while the sea-way and the largest harbour were filled with ships and merchants coming from all quarters, which by reason of their multitude caused clamor and tumult of every description and an unceasing din night and day.
“Now as regards the city and environs of the ancient dwelling we have now well-nigh completed the description as it was originally given. We must endeavor next to repeat the account of the rest of the country, what its natural character was, and in what fashion it was ordered. In the first place, then, according to the account, the whole region rose sheer out of the sea to a great height, but the part about the city was all a smooth plain, enclosing it round about, and being itself encircled by mountains which stretched as far as to the sea; and this plain had a level surface and was as a whole rectangular in shape, being 3,000 stades long on either side and 2,000 stades wide at its center, reckoning upwards from the sea. And this region, all along the island, faced towards the South and was sheltered from the Northern blasts. And the mountains which surrounded it were at that time celebrated as surpassing all that now exist in number, magnitude and beauty; for they had upon them many rich villages of country folk, and streams and lakes and meadows which furnished ample nutriment to all the animals both tame and wild, and timber of various sizes and descriptions, abundantly sufficient for the needs of all and every craft.
“Now as a result of natural forces, together with the labors of many kings which extended over many ages, the condition of the plain was this. It was originally a quadrangle, rectilinear for the most part, and elongated; and what it lacked of this shape they made right by means of a trench dug round about it. Now, as regards the depth of this trench and its breadth and length, it seems incredible that it should be so large as the account states, considering that it was made by



137
hand, and in addition to all the other operations, but none the less we must report what we heard; it was dug out to the depth of a plethrum and to a uniform breadth of a stade, and since it was dug around the whole plain its consequent length was 10,000 stades. It received the streams which came down from the mountains and after circling round the plain, and coming towards the city on this side and on that, it discharged them thereabouts into the sea. And on the inland side of the city channels were cut in straight lines, of about 100 feet in width, across the plain, and these discharged themselves into the trench on the seaward side, the distance between each being 100 stades. It was in this way that they conveyed to the city the timber from the mountains and transported also on boats the season’s products, by cutting traverse passages from one channel to the next and also to the city. And they cropped the land twice a year, making use of the rains from heaven in the winter, and the waters that issue from the earth in summer, by conducting the streams from the trenches.”
This sacred temple form has much to do with the structure of the galaxies and of the universe, the dimensions spreading out from the central ‘plan-et’, the galaxy spreading out from its center in an ever broadening spiral like a flat disk, etc. etc. Like the Russian cluster dolls, the form of the microcosm only grows larger and larger and is repeated in every aspect of our Creation. Its form was created to spread the energy of the FATHER out through all existence , much like the Atlantean form was created to spread energy throughout its lands. This ‘temple technology’ is critical to an understanding of the history we are about to explore.
Plato also gives us a description of the people’s ability to deal with the rich lushness they had built for themselves in the early days of the Empire, while still possessing a state of nonattachment to it, their motivation still coming spiritually from within. It was as this spiritual nature degenerated in favor of morality that their attitudes toward their possessions also changed for the poorer:
“ . . . Consequently they thought scorn of everything save virtue and lightly esteemed their rich possessions, bearing with ease the burden, as it were, of the vast volumes of their gold and other goods; and thus their wealth did not make them drunk with pride so that they lost control of themselves and went to ruin; rather, in their soberness of mind they clearly saw that all these good things are increased by general amity combined with virtue, whereas the eager pursuit and worship of these goods not only causes the goods themselves to diminish but makes virtue also to perish with them. As a result, then, of such reasoning and of the continuance of their divine nature all their wealth had grown to such a greatness as we previously described. But when the portion of divinity within them was now becoming faint and weak through being oftimes blended with a large measure of morality, whereas the human temper was becoming dominant, then at length they lost their comeliness, through being unable to bear the burden of their possessions, and became ugly to look upon, in the eyes of him who has the gift of sight; for they had lost their fairness of their goods from the most precious of their parts; but in the eyes of those who have no gift of perceiving what is the truly happy life, it was then above all that they appeared to be superlatively fair and blessed, filled as they were with lawless ambition and power. And Zeus, the God of gods, who reigns by Law, inasmuch as he had the gift of perceiving such things, marked how this righteous race was in evil plight, and desired to inflict punishment upon them, to the end that when chastised they might strike a truer note. Wherefore he assembled together all the gods into that abode which they honor most, standing as it does at the center of all the Universe, and beholding all things that partake of generation; and when he had assembled them, he spake thus . . . .. “

Atlantis was vast in size. While the population of the community was very small for a time, it became quite an intergalactic population. Its Healing Temple became very intergalactic. For a while it was known to be "the healing place" within the solar system. This brought quite an intergalactic population and a need to understand the different cultures and varying energies of the Universe. Earth at that time was the place where souls intermingled gaining greater understanding of one another. The early openness of Atlantis gave a greater opportunity for this that had ever been available before. Not only was Atlantis advanced as far as its culture was concerned but it also had a very peaceful environment that allowed acceptance. There was a great acceptance of all life. There was very little judgment at that time of who was better or who was right. All things were pretty much accepted just the way they were.
And so a nation tied to their spiritual natures received all the blessings of the world, and life for its inhabitants was sweet. When they began instead to treasure Man’s laws over those of the FATHER, the people grew meaner and uglier in their ways, and brought about destruction upon themselves.
The First Destruction
The first destruction happened around 50,000 BC. Cayce’s Atlantean life readings refer to this early period before the first destruction and also blame the degeneration of the people for its cause:
“In the Atlantean land when there were those disturbing forces—just previous to the first disturbing forces that brought the first destruction in the continent, through the application of spiritual things for self-indulgence of material peoples.” (no. 1406-1, July 13, 1937)
The first destruction of a portion of Atlantis appears to have been caused ‘accidentally’ by explosives that were used improperly, triggering volcanic action:
“ . . . with the continued disregard of those who were keeping the pure race and the pure peoples . . . man brought in destructive forces to be used by people that were rulers. The destructive forces combined with those natural resources of the gases, of the electrical forces made in nature, caused volcanic eruptions in the slow cooling earth, and that portion now near what would be termed the Sargasso Sea first went into the depths. With this there again came the egress of peoples” (no. 364-4; February 16, 1932).
What Cayce is referring to is the fact that Atlantis had the capability of nuclear weapons. Just as in the present day United States and other countries with nuclear capability, they felt the need to test these weapons—underground. Unfortunately what the Atlanteans and many modern governments realize but don’t take enough notice of is the fact that, in many places, the earth’s crust contains large pockets of natural gas which run for hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles, even under the ocean. It is one of these gas pockets that was affected by the underground testing, causing the break up of certain parts of the continent. The modern day practice of removing so much oil, gas, and artesian water from under the ground without backfilling the space made vacant, is already the cause of many similar earthquakes and ‘natural disasters.’
Colonization
Like Donnelly, the Cayce readings speak of migrations of Atlanteans to areas throughout the world, yet the Cayce description of the result of these migrations goes far beyond that of



139
Donnelly. In fact, the Cayce Atlantis with its high technological achievements and great moral conflicts, resembles more the world of today than the orthodox concept of the ancient world.
The Nine say that Atlantis expanded over an enormous land mass and colonized various other places on the planet—from North America across to Greece, then to many other areas as well after the destruction. This is due in part to a change in weather patterns caused by the sinking of that part of the continent. These changes allowed for some areas of the adjacent continents to also be more hospitable to habitation, as described earlier.
From Atlantis sprang various civilizations such as the Olmecs (although technically these came more directly from Altea—through Atlantis), the Mayans, the Aztecs, Greece, Troy, and also the ancient megalithic cultures of Britain. When Atlantis fell there was a great dispersion and trauma resembling the one at the time of the Jewish Diaspora. The civilizations in Crete around 8000 BC came from Atlantis. Also, according to the Nine, some in Israel, Jordan, and Iraq, as well as portions of China, India, and Tibet saw a major Atlantean influence.
The Nine agree that America was also in part colonized from regions of Israel, and that the Phoenicians merged at one time with aboriginals already existing in certain areas of the United States. New evidence of this early visitation to the North American continent, especially the South, is now coming to light, although not through any of the popular media channels.
Early excerpts and press releases from the Research Dateline of The Egyptology Society in Miami, Florida, suggests the discovery of tangible archaeological evidence pointing to the former existence of an advanced civilization that built temples near Bimini. These ruins can be geologically dated as being more than twelve thousand years old. Preliminary analysis has revealed that the original structures, although smaller in size, appear to have been more advanced than the Great Pyramid of Giza. Casing stones have been measured which are of the same unique angle as those at the Great Pyramid. There are exact orbital plots of the planets and what seem to have been intricate star shafts, metal-coated walls, and intermingled stones of various colors (including red, white, and black). Other characteristics either closely match or are identical to features at megalithic sites in Peru, Mexico, the Yucatan, Ireland, and Scandinavia.
The Mayan culture was one that was a ‘left over’ from Atlantis–a colony that lost contact with its homeland and reverted to a somewhat more primitive state, much as has happened to other ancient cultures cut off from their original source.
Egypt was perhaps the major colonizing effort of the Atlanteans, in cooperation with the Sirians, and there are many references to the gods who set up the Egyptian civilization and became its rulers in what was known as Zep Tepi—‘the First Time’.
The Edfu Building Texts preserve a reference to the ‘Seven Sages.” The context in which the Texts describe the Sages is marked by a preponderance of ‘Flood’ imagery in which the ‘primeval waters’ (out of which the Great Primeval Mound emerged) are depicted as gradually receding. As Robert Bauval suggests, it is probably no accident that in Indian tradition ‘Seven Sages’ (Rishis) are remembered to have survived the Flood, their purpose being to preserve and pass down to future generations the wisdom of the antediluvian world.
In both cases the sages appear as the enlightened survivors of a cataclysm that wiped the earth clean, setting about making a fresh start at the dawn of a new age—which, in ancient Egypt, was referred to as Zep Tepi. As other researchers confirm is written about Zep Tepi, “the



140
first era known by our principal sources was a period which started from what existed in the past. The general tone of the ancient records convey this view that an ancient world, after having been constituted, was destroyed, and as a dead world it came to be the basis of a new period of creation which at first was the re-creation and resurrection of what once had existed in the past.”
If this sounds a little familiar in its reference, it is the legend of the Phoenix—the legendary bird that consumed itself by fire (nuclear weapons), and a new, young phoenix (its colonies) sprang from its ashes. In the mythology of ancient Egypt, the phoenix represented the sun, which dies at night and is reborn in the morning. Early Christian tradition then adopted the phoenix as a symbol of both immortality and resurrection. As we shall see, the New World Order is nothing but a grander version of the resurrected phoenix that was Dark Sorcerer Kings of Atlantis.
The story of Egypt according to Edgar Cayce’s life readings pushes active Egyptian culture back almost 12,500 years to around 10,500 BC—a fact that is now becoming evident in the new research on the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx. The alignment of these ‘monuments’ with the star systems related to them could only have been achieved much earlier than what had previously been thought. Water level marks high on the Sphinx also could only have come during some kind of major flooding, not possible simply from the annual flooding of the River Nile.
Cayce describes the original society and culture of Egypt developing from nomadic influxes of people to the Nile valley (from both the Carpathian mountains of Asia, and from Arabia), who then settled with the peoples already in Egypt and took political control. Some of these readings even indicate that this culture was actively involved in archeological research of its own regarding earlier societies!
It is only since the 1950s that geologists were able to confirm Cayce’s words that the Sahara was indeed fertile well into the 2nd millennium BC, although caught in a losing battle with the encroaching desert . A people now known to the archaeologists as the Pastoralists, with many cultural elements in common with the Archaic Dynasty Egyptians of the Lower Nile, prospered in what is now unlivable wasteland.
Cayce confirms this fact as well in one of his readings:
“What is now the Sahara was (during the Atlanteans’ migration from their sunken homeland in the West to the Nile Valley in the East) an inhabited land and very fertile.” (Edgar Cayce 36413,1939)
Cayce himself spoke of having an incarnation in Egypt around 10,000 BC when many Atlanteans migrated there to escape the sinking of the last islands.
Egypt was a colony that was very ‘hard-core’ say The Nine. By this They mean that the Egyptians retained many of the hardcore attitudes of the Atlanteans. This was also evident in many of the other areas to which the Atlanteans eventually migrated. Since many of these escaping Atlanteans took some of their technology with them when they colonized, it was also a cultural shock to the natives of an area. These are some of the cultural remnants that many researchers such as Erich Von Daniken have found in their search for evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation to the planet.
The Beginning of Disharmony
The time came when the Atlanteans began to use their knowledge in ways that became selfserving to a few as mentioned by Plato. This self-serving use of energy sowed seeds of



141
disharmony that began to grow. Discord arose as to the proper use of creative energy. The culture split into The Philosophers, Healers and Communicators on one side, and the Scientists and Technology community on the other, and both struggling for control. The Master had long ago vacated the Holy Temple in the center of the Great River of Life.
This struggle for power that lasted for several millennium finally found the power falling into the hands of the technological and scientific community. They were very knowledgeable in the ways of manipulating energy for their own purposes. As the power fell to them, more and more they created things that were not for the benefit of all, but for the benefit of a few. Those in power felt as though that there were differences between various facets of society. They felt they were superior to those that followed the philosophies. The scientific and technological side felt others were inferior or of a lower class. If they were of a lower class then they could not have the understanding or the ability to govern Atlantis.
The philosophers were the first to be attacked. The philosophers were isolated into one area of Atlantis. How could this happen? The scientific and technology leaders gathered the philosophers together for the pretense of a joint meeting on Atlantean affairs. The scientific and technology leaders then placed an energy field around the philosophers. They could not go beyond the energy field that surrounded them, nor could others enter into the energy field. While all was provided for the philosopher's existence they no longer had any influence over the culture at large.
Thus the scientific and technological leaders began to divide Atlantis into sectors. They began to re-locate different cultures in isolated pockets of communities, much as the new world order has intentions of doing again. Sectors were developed. Energy fields were placed around these sectors of division to eliminate cross-culture communication.
Those leaders that evolved into the control of the government began to use their knowledge of creation in a way that they felt would create what had never been created before. They became intoxicated with the prospect of creation. Realize that when you know how to manipulate energy into a vibrational form creation is not difficult. There was no limitation or thought of the common good as they built upon the creation of technology.
Much as was portrayed in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, there was a huge crystal obelisk erected that sent out energy pulses that kept everything subdued. The population was not unhappy. Nobody wanted to rebel. It was like the energies just said, "You're happy," and that was accepted by the population. There was a total control over the population. What you must understand is that this was less then ten per cent of the population that had all the power. As the scientists and technologists began to take control of Atlantis, they became more and more intoxicated with their own power of creativity.
The Final Destruction
In the rise, fall, and final destruction of Atlantis, there are indeed many parallels with our own culture. There are also many warnings inherent in the information that comes through the Nine and through Cayce about the use of technology, as well as on the use and misuse of power. Much of this information will come to light in the next few years through the discoveries to be made in Egypt where records of Atlantis were stored for future generations to learn from. These seemingly harmless records though, may not be so harmless, and everyone waiting for their revelations may not be so interested once they find out what they contain—as we shall find out.



142
Cayce mentions these records in a couple of life readings:
“ . . . there were evidences and prophecies of Atlantis being broken up, and Egypt was chosen as one of those places where the records of that activity were to be established” (no. 27538, January 16, 1934).
“. . . for the entity was in charge of those records when the last peoples of Atlantis journeyed to the various quarters of the globe” (no. 378-13, August 14, 1933).
The most evident parallels between their culture and our own are that both cultures developed a high level of technical society, both were world powers, and both were plagued with racial or social problems. Both also developed weaponry that, if misused, could not only destroy their own country but much of the planet as well. Both were also heavily involved with experimentation on affecting the climate of the world. One might say that both, also, never learned from the mistakes they made, but kept on going despite the obvious warning signals. Other similarities will be noticed as we further detail the final destruction of the continent, and the technology which helped bring this ending about.
In Atlantis, the worst happened—not once, but on three separate occasions, the last resulting in the final destruction and sinking of the civilization entirely. It is little wonder that many of Cayce’s life readings that spoke of Atlantean incarnations were filled with warnings to individuals about the misuse of their abilities. Individuals who had misused their talents once before might easily follow the path of least resistance and misuse them once again. In judging these events, it might be helpful to remember Kryon’s warning that we are our own ancestors.
The influx of people or migration into Atlantis might be seen as another parallel. According to Cayce’s psychic data, the upper classes of the Atlantean race looked like modern people, but they used these migrants, the less developed “things,” as servants and for experimentation. If for no other reason, this fact alone might suggest the presence of the New World Order in Atlantis, or at least strong connections to its roots, for the arrogance of power and the wealthy—the Illuminati--are very similar in both.
In Egypt, the Atlantean survivors considered the majority of the local people no higher than “menial” in physiological development and their culture and technical stance extremely backward, just as they had on their own continent. This helped set up a tradition of slavery in both Egypt and many of the surrounding countries as well that still persists today in many parts of Africa, and was the root of the slave trade coming to the New World.
Clow remembers this phase in one of her past life excursions:
“There were other beings on other levels of mentality. Some of them were savages and primitives on the earth. They lived in Africa, Brazil, China, in modern-day language. We bothered them, which was really not fair. We didn’t do that to help them.”
The final portion of Atlantis, the island that Plato called Poseidonis, contrary to popular belief, was destroyed in the biblical Flood, the Great Deluge that occurred around 9,000 BC.
Two of the catastrophes that occurred to help bring Atlantis to destruction were man-made. The first was through the misuse of nuclear technology and the second through the misuse of crystal technology. The two that were ‘naturally caused’ were due to the biblical Flood and the other was due to simple volcanic activity from the natural processes of Earth’s crust cooling.



143
A being named Vajra explains how crystal technology is used in his time during a Tibetan Time Transference performed before an audience in Anaheim, California. This is a form of time travel, much like a post-life progression into the future. It is a very secret technique that is unique to the training of the Black Hat Sect of Tibetan Buddhism. The Black Hats travel the time stream and it is from this sect that the Oracles to the Dali Lama are chosen. What he describes sounds very much like that already described in Atlantis –the huge crystal obelisk erected that sent out energy pulses that kept everything subdued, but black as portrayed once again in 2001: A Space Odyssey:
“ We use holograms for a great deal. . . All this stores millions of giga-bytes at a subatomic level. The computers themselves look like black stone blocks, which can only be described as being bio-computers.
“The use of these devices has been greatly limited however, because of their great misuse and because these computers were used to mark much of the population and to kill and destroy many people in your coming time. We have opted more for the development of the human mind and the human soul and spirit. We interact with these devices, and they certainly make things easier for us on certain occasions, however, we prefer using our own talents and abilities.
“There was a great backlash against these machines and devices. This leads to . . . one of the great computers that the Immanuella uses in many forms . . This great computer acts very much as a council, or simply an advisor. It in no way dictates what it is that we do. There is no one set central government that tells any individual or any country ways it must live. There is a very standard set of laws that are obeyed that come from 'The Keepsake' of the old times”
An important concept to understand here is that it was about this period, 9000 BC, that the Earth’s density lowered fully into the 3rd dimension. This was the actual event responsible for the Flood, contrary to all other written material on the subject. Like an elevator falling down its shaft with little or no restraint, and finally hitting rock bottom, the final ‘landing’ of Earth’s 2,000 year process of lowering from the astral or 4th dimension down into the heavy vibration of the 3rd dimension, ended with a ‘crash.’ The result was the shifting of the Southern polar ice-caps as described by Sitchin and others. Sliding off its land base into the areas south of what is now Australia, the flood of water rushed northward in a wall of water hundreds of feet high, removing most of the natural features of the Australian continent so that we now call it the ‘oldest continent,’ it appearing to be the most warn down. If all continents were born at the same time as supposed by the Pangea/continental drift theory, why would one then be any ‘older’ than the others?
It was instead simply the fact that the remnant of Lemuria which we now know as Australia, took the full force of the Flood, and was wiped clean of most of its surface detail. The effects on the rest of the world were enormous, especially since the ocean’s water level rose approximately six hundred feet at that time due to the volume of ice now in the ocean.
It is here in Australia that we find the ‘original hearts’ of the planet, those who are very much like the old Lemurians, the Ab-originals.
Think about how much of Earth’s civilization resides on the coastal areas of their continents, on tidal rivers, or at least on levels not much higher than sea level. Then imagine what a rise of 600 feet in the sea level would do the planet at this time, and how much of civilization would be affected, especially after such a wall of water had washed over much of the planet first.



144
The Nine support this version of the Flood as They talk about the fact that there were colonies of Atlantis at that time that were “not of a destructive nature: those in truth were not
destroyed. . . the loss of it was due to a natural phenomenon, your oceans, your earthquakes. . . It happened overnight.”
If one is led to wonder why there are not more remnants of these civilizations we are talking about, it is simply because they have been washed clean from the face of the Earth, and subsequently from the history books. One Earth-change after another over the millions of years ‘Man’ has been on the planet has wiped clean the slate of our memories and of our history. We are going to have to dig a lot deeper if we want to find the bones of more of our true ancestors..
The Sirian/Orion Influence
Atlantis was, in part, seeded by the Sirians, a race of beings outside the influence of the Twenty-Four (the literal Federation of Star Trek fame). The Sirians, and those from Orion as well, were the predominant survivors of the Mars/Maldek wars.
The Sirians were the ‘old time Atlanteans’ who came to the planet many hundreds of thousands of years ago to implant themselves into the culture here on Earth, completely for the purpose of taking it over for their own selfish reasons. As we shall see, they are not the only ones who have treated this planet and its people in exactly this kind of way.
The time when Atlantis really became a civilized continent/culture about 100,000 years ago was in a interglacial period on the planet as recognized by modern geology:
“Within each ice age are remarkable fluctuations known as glacials and interglacials: cold and warm phases that correspond to a cycle of about 100,000 years. Recognition of this glacial cycle required complex mathematical calculations, first worked out by a Yugoslav scientist, Milutin Milankovitch (1879-1958)”.
The Sirians had left the planet periodically as it grew colder and less hospitable, even as it was still fourth dimensionally inclined. They then re-established themselves some 50,000 years ago along with the survivors from Mars and Maldek. They are the Atlanteans people know of today who sank along with the continent as it went down during four separate phases, finally disappearing in its entirety around 9,000 BC. It is with their return to the planet that the demise of Atlantis began, for with them they brought the occult technology and ancient mystical rites that turned the people of Atlantis from proponents of the original religion they had inherited from Lemuria—‘the Law of One’—into a continent ruled by black magic and Dark sorcerer kings.
As a side note, it must also be borne in mind that down to the very end when Poseidonis disappeared, an Initiate emperor or king—or at least one acknowledging the “good law” –held sway in some part of the island continent. This being helped guide and instruct the small minority of those who were still willing to lead pure and wholesome lives. In later days, this “white” king was a ruler elected by the priests—the handful, that is, who still followed the “good law.” Clow describes in the stories of her past lives how she was once a “ freedom fighter from the other side” working against this Occult Hierarchy in the last days before the sinking of Atlantis.
Within even the darkest organizations on this planet that we shall explore in later chapters, there are still good people. This is an important fact to keep in mind. Most organizations depend on the rank and file remaining unknowing of the true purposes for which the organization really stands, and this will even include the religions. It is therefore unwise to condemn all those



145
involved with the Darkness, but we must work instead to help show them the truth of their situation. We have all gone through those evil days, and now those experiences we have accumulated help us realize truth as we struggle to resurrect it again.
Remember, the key moment in Max Bollinger’s children’s book The Lonely Prince, comes when Prince William, unable to possess the first thing in his life he feels is truly important, breaks down and cries. His crying is an emotional breakthrough that thaws his emotional indifference. Once he begins to express his feelings, happiness also becomes possible. This is the way it is with the Dark side. For every one of us who refuses to bow his head, the opportunity is given for those on the Dark side to change.
This, too, is what we all must do to heal the wounds of our history, to let go of the past and move on. This needs to be done both individually, within ourselves, and as a race of people aligned on a self-destructive course much like we once did before in these last days of Atlantis.
At this time of its final destruction, and with the lowering of the planet into the 3rd dimension, the Sirians, those who had been worshipped as the ‘gods of old’, those who had once walked and talked with Man much like the Annunaki did, also appeared to leave the planet or at least to deal with it in a very much more limited and impersonal way.
Through their advanced technology, the ‘gods’ were able to still communicate with the Earthlings of the time, and to still reside occasionally in the ‘twilight zone’ areas within temples that were links between the 3rd and 4th dimension. This is the time when ‘the gods’ became the ‘unseen’ gods that many religions still worship today, unseen much like we think of ghosts, astral entities, and aliens intent on abduction.
Again Clow:
“. . .We also started communicating with beings on levels other than ours with our powers . . . There were good Atlanteans and there were Atlanteans who misused this power. And toward the end of the Atlantis phase, the beings of Atlantis found ways to make sure they still had contact on the earth plane.”
The Sirians and the Men from Orion, also known as the Men in Black, have in the past been like a horde of ravaging pirates in the Universe. As one author puts it, “they are in a cabal, an alliance or a pact . . . to share the spoils of what they conquer, of what they possess, of the beings they control as they move from planet to planet.”
It was because of these two groups of planetary beings that the war between Maldek and Mars got started, and it was also because of their technology, in this case a nuclear war, that both the planets became virtually lifeless masses floating in the great void of space. A warning of the danger we are once again facing as we have returned once again to a similar level of technology and aggression, is given by the being named Vajra:
Vajra: “That is what your age, or your generation, is about to go through has much to do with the puberty of that child. It has much to do with the violence and the rage and the misunderstandings and the temper, if you will, that you are evolving from.
“In the later part and beginning of your 20th and 21st Century, so much of what survives now is an obsession that you have with games and games and games.... so many games! Little children's games. We have games here which serve a purpose to educate and enlighten, but in our society the things that are important are dance or music or art and singing or the joyous



146
expressions of love towards one another..... and the women are simply better at that than we men are now.”
Most of those who created the war escaped to planet Earth, and with them they brought
their connection/their worship/their subservience to the being known as Lucifer – hence the name the Luciferian Wars. This was the beginning of the Tree of Life as it has been worshipped on this planet now for some 50,000 years. It is not only the tree of man’s progression up the spiritual Jacob’s Ladder of the higher dimensions, but also the tree of Luciferian influence on us all. As we shall soon discover, there is an actual genetic tree linked to the physical seed of Lucifer. The Luciferian gene now resides in as many as 90 percent of all those being inhabiting the Earth! These events in Atlantis are the beginning of Lucifer, as we know him, on Earth. And it is from this original colony in Atlantis that we must also begin tracking him and his power as it moves from one center of influence to another upon the planet, and from one power-based institution to another.
It is to these beings and this particular time that the Nine refer in the following channeling:
“In the time of Atlantis . . . they believed this was the secret of being what they called the God, and they wished to be in competition with the God and become the God. . . . There are
those who came in sheep’s clothing but were wolves. There are those who wanted our position but were never in a position to get it.”
Man’s history has indeed been a search to replace the FATHER – whether it be Lucifer and his rebellion against Enjliou or the Atlanteans searching for a way to become God. But it is only because of a lack of the knowledge of who we really are, parts of the Oneness of God, that we continually keep searching to return to something we never left—and which in return never ever left us as well.
To add strangeness upon seeming strangeness, the Nine explain that there were those in Atlantis who new the errors of their ways, and who chose to come back and be of service to planet Earth at this time when the mistakes of Atlantis might soon be repeated. As Cayce talked about the people returning to the planet who had at one time misused or abused their power in Atlantis, so too are there people returning to help in any way possible. The difference with the beings the Nine refer to is that, knowing the difficulties of existing in the flesh at this level of density, and not wanting to be tempted to repeat their same mistakes, these people chose to return in a form where they would not be tempted again—they chose to come back as dolphins.
“The dolphins have chosen to return as porpoises and dolphins though they were once humans because they knew in this form they could not make an error . . . it explains the energies of desire (190) . . .in their intellect and understanding of the nature of the past experience, we knew that they could be of service . . . They are guardians . . . and infertility is one of the more notable cures from swimming with the dolphins.”
Go to SeaWorld and watch how these creatures act, listen to the remarkable stories of people cured of physical and emotional illnesses after having been subjected to ‘dolphin therapy’ --swimming with the dolphins. Perhaps then the reality of what has just been said might truly begin to sink in.



147
Barbara Clow speaks extensively of the Men in Black from Orion and Sirius who were the cause of the Fall of Atlantis. She sheds new light on their purpose in being here on the planet at this time:
“(They) have infiltrated earth at this time because of the level of technology attained . . .The Men in Black caused a great cataclysm—the Fall of Atlantis—but the Men in Black did not succeed in their ultimate goal, which was to wrest the minds of men from the gods. The “official sources of information”—historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and psychologists—deny the history of Atlantis because, if they did, people would remember that destruction has occurred before. Then humans would have a greater hope of identifying the way evil works to trick them out of their freedom.
“. . . Their ancient battle was with the Nibiruans and the Sirians, . . . and their struggle is recorded in the many legends about fratricide (such as) Horus and Set in Egypt . . . the Men in Black are heavily incarnated on Earth during this period. . . . Their particular skill is in setting up situations which encourage evil choices during times of high technology. These covert cosmic visitors often wear dark suits with white shirts and red ties. Most people on Earth remember their influence during the Fall of Atlantis, and this fear of ancient cataclysm causes an almost total mental paralysis upon encountering the Men in Black.”

Chapter 10 Orion and the Fall of the Atlantean Branch
The Men from Orion are the agents of what Barbara Clow terms “the big lie”—that Orion has engaged in a program of seeding walk-ins—Orion robots—on Earth.
“The Men from Orion have decided to commence their third battle, which is going on right now. The Men in Black are tempted to trigger humans into nuclear conflict in order to gain ultimate control. The pollution of the earth and the paralysis of well-meaning people is a behavior pattern from the first two wars in this solar system. For these Men in Black, who are true fallen angels, this is their third and last knock . . . If they make the conditions on Earth bad enough, no one but themselves will be left on Earth, for beings from Orion can tolerate high levels of radiation because the stars there are extremely dense. Orion immune systems are very strong, since their low level of vibration enables them to tolerate the typical modern diet and exposure to pollution and toxic chemicals. And, since their agenda is negative, the Men in Black are not agonized about the genocide of the species.”
“In the last battle . . . crystals were implanted in the etheric bodies of people by the Orion Atlanteans. . .The crystals are implanted with a variety of interesting programs . . . The Men from Orion knew that Earth would undergo another struggle at this point between the positive and negative forces. Therefore, many of the key crystals were programmed to help their cause. The end phase of the plan is to bring in walk-ins from Orion in order to use the crystals to maximum advantage.”
The Men from Orion are an unusual life form, not really humanoid at all. They resemble more of a machine in their anatomical structure, and their appearance as we think of Atlanteans being the red race, is more a copperish-red color. This is the archetype of Mars—the red planet. Clow says in one of her works that the Atlanteans are “the metal people who came from the stars.” The machine-like men in the movie The Matrix are archetypal Orions, shape-shifters.
In the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest pieces of literature from Sumeria, the hero Gilgamesh is given a ‘mechanical-type’ friend named Enkidu by the gods, similar to what we might think of as a robot. This Being, however, is a biological entity—not a machine. This would be more like one of the Men from Orion. The Terminator series of movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger are a remembrance of the Mars/Maldek war and of the Men from Orion.
These Beings were greatly into experimenting on the nature of matter, using the knowledge they had acquired from the Alteans, those who were specialists in the ‘nature of matter’. Their main pursuit was for more powerful and deadly forms of weaponry. Do you see a parallel here, too? It was because of this experimentation and the weaponry they were able to build that the war between Maldek and Mars was so effective in destroying one planet and rendering the other planet lifeless.
This is a passion the men from Orion brought with them to Atlantis, with almost similar results. The Nine mention an occasion in which they abused a radioactive substance known as ‘heavy water’. They are referring to the pollution of many of their own water supplies with radioactive waste, much as the United States and other countries with nuclear capabilities also seem to have done. The effect this had on their people is similar to the one the radioactive pollution of our own water supplies and atmosphere is having on us today in causing sterility and abominable diseases such as leukemia and cancer. As Dr. Walter Russell explains:
“Radiation is the normal death principle. Every thing in Nature dies normally by slowly radiating its heat. Radioactivity is the explosively quick death principle. Radioactivity is man’s discovery of how the human race can die quickly, and not be able to propagate its kind for many long centuries.



4
“The Curies procured a few grams of radium from many tons of earth. Those few grams of dead metals would spread their quick death to every cell of your body if you put them in your pocket, but they would not harm you in the slightest if you slept upon the ground above them. The radioactive metals are giving out their quick death to the rocks in which they are embedded for the purpose of expanding the rocks into soil and water which mothers life. It should not be dug up from the ground to expand human beings into quick death. If you would have a good example of their purpose in life, which is beneficial to humanity, witness the great bare rock mountains of the west which are only a few million years old. Compare them with the soil covered, tree covered, very much older eastern mountains, such as the Blue Ridge, White Mountains and Catskills where the soil is deep above them and waterfalls and brooks are abundant.
“. . . the greatest danger from the use of radioactivity is defective births and leukemia. That danger will creep upon civilization without any way of detecting it. One cannot go about with instruments to measure genetic damage, as one can do to measure the amount of strontium and other radioactivity which is still falling on the soil from year to year. We believe that sterility will be an accompanying effect, while abnormalities of living bodies will be secondary. It could not be otherwise, for genes are not basic in potency. There is something behind and underneath genes, and that is the seed. No human has ever attempted to explain the seed; therefore it is permissible for us to say that the principle of rebirth in bodies is not yet known on earth. We know it, however, and because of that we know the danger which has no meaning to those who do not know. The mystery has to do with knowledge of the purpose of inert gases in relation to the seed of things. . .
“Another dangerous misconception is evidenced in the commonly used term ‘. . . releases an extraordinary amount of energy’. Energy is not released. What actually happens is that potential is released, not energy—and that means expansion. Atomic fission helps matter to explode instantly instead of decaying over long periods . . . the great simple basic fact is that all death is caused by expansion, and all life is caused by compression.”
This harkens back to our discussion in Volume 1 of the difference between the combining of things into a greater whole known as fusion, which is the nature of the True Father; and the act of fission or tearing things apart which is the true nature of Self-Will or Lucifer.
Dr. Albert Schweitzer once made a plea to the United Nations to stop the use of radioactive materials on this planet. In the message, Dr. Schweitzer said his aim was to awaken public opinion before it was too late. He warned that the human race was heading for a catastrophe beyond parallel if nuclear explosions were continued—a catastrophe, he said, that must be prevented at all costs. He expressed the hope that his message would reach the whole world.
An expert in many fields, Dr. Russell also confirms for us the potential of planets exploding and the fact that asteroids are not naturally occurring objects, but rather are the pieces of shattered planets. This is exactly what happened to Maldek during the Mars-Maldek wars as it shattered and turned into a band of lifeless asteroids still stuck in the original orbit as the once beautiful planet.
“Do not for a moment think that planets and suns cannot explode. They are continually exploding. There are thousands of novas in the heavens and space is filled with countless millions of fragments of exploded planets, which we call asteroids and meteorites. These are irregular shaped lumps. Nature does not create her forms in lumps. She creates only rings and spheres which she crystallizes into geometric forms, but they must first be rings and spheres.”
Along with their penchant for experimentation in nuclear fission and weapons of deadly effectiveness, the Sirians and the Men from Orion also brought with them to Atlantis their knowledge of alchemy acquired



5
from the Alteans. This they used in their practice of the occult—a term which has now come to mean the worship of black magic and the Dark Forces. This is how they went about setting up the Occult Hierarchy spoken of earlier—the Dark Sorcerer Kings ruling a doomed Atlantis.
The Nine say that to the Atlanteans this alchemy was the secret of being what they called God, “and they wished to be in competition with the God and become the God.”
One of the Sirians who brought this knowledge with him to Atlantis was the being known as Hermes from Greek mythology, Mercury in Roman mythology. Hermes was renowned as the messenger of the gods, and the protector of travelers, thieves, and merchants (all Masonic references). Hermes Trimistegus (Hermes thrice-born or thrice-risen) was the Greek Neoplatonists’ name for the Egyptian god, Thoth, revered as the founder of alchemy and geometry, in this case, sacred geometry—the structure of the Universe.
Alchemy as talked about in history books is an ancient art. Here it is referred to as being practiced openly, most especially in the Middle Ages, devoting itself chiefly to discovering a substance that would transmute the more common metals into gold or silver and to finding a means of indefinitely prolonging human life. Although its purposes and techniques were dubious and often illusory, alchemy was in many ways the predecessor of modern science, especially the science of chemistry. Its birthplace is said to be in Alexandria in ancient Egypt, where it began to flourish during the Hellenistic period. A school of alchemy was also developing at the same time in ancient China.
“The fundamental concept of alchemy stemmed from the Aristotelian doctrine that all things tend to reach perfection. Because other metals were thought to be less “perfect” than gold, it was reasonable to assume that nature formed gold out of other metals deep within the earth and that with sufficient skill and diligence an artisan could duplicate this process in the workshop. Efforts toward this goal were empirical and practical at first, but by the 4th century AD, astrology, magic, and ritual had begun to gain prominence.”
With this clearer understanding of the nature of alchemy, it is easy to see how it stemmed from the Alteans specialized knowledge of the nature of matter. Unfortunately, when placed in the wrong hands, the resulting knowledge could also be deadly to millions of people!
Alchemy also became a basis for the symbolism of the secret societies—the turning of base metals or human Beings into gold, the ‘more perfect’ illuminated master. This shall be a central theme as we charter the course of the New World Order as it sets sail from the declining and doomed civilization of Atlantis, and on into its developing colonies. Note, however, before we move on, that it is also the foundations for the science and scientists we now look to rule the world with their wisdom, and of the oil and chemical companies which form such a large central part of the structure and base power of the Order.
Hermes is also significant because it was he that was said to have the special knowledge held to represent the ‘Lost Wisdom of Lamech’ (Lamech was seventh inline of succession from Adam’s son, Cain -Genesis 4:18–22). Thoth/Hermes, the alchemist and geometer [God to the Freemasonic Brotherhood is known as the Grand Geometer], is also the one worshipped or honored throughout history by the many orders of the ancient mysteries. It is significant to our history that the Nine say that around 11,000 BC in Atlantis, another group of colonizing Atlanteans mingled with those of Hoova –thereby starting the Hebrew culture later led by Abraham (an alchemist and astrologer of vast knowledge who was also the keeper of atomic secrets as we shall see).
Almost all mystical sects and orders have their origin in the “Divine Knowledge” taught by Hermes/Thoth—the occult teachings, sacred geometry, alchemy, and the pursuit of immortality. Thus when



6
the Freemasons and other such orders boast that they had their origins in Atlantis, Lemuria, or even on other planets, they are not lying—although most of them do not fully realize the true nature of what is going on.
In her book, EL:AN:RA: The Healing of Orion, Solara helps shed some light on the Omni, the dark forces that rule Orion and still continue to pursue the dictatorship of this galaxy. This excerpt also sheds some light on the fact that within any star system, not all the planets are necessarily Dark or Light:
“It was the dreaded triad known as the OMNI, the rulers of the Dark Lords of Orion.
“The Omni stood as one vast, impenetrable presence, although their three forms were quite different in physical appearance. The first of the three was short and overweight. His hair was cropped close to his head making his squinty pale blue eyes stand out from the folds of flesh. They glinted with malice. This one was without a doubt the most impatient of the three. Even now he was fidgeting nervously, ready to lose his temper at the slightest provocation. On the far side, the third OMNI was tall and gaunt with straight hair pulled back. He had a finely chiseled bone structure and deep set hollow eyes which made his face resemble a skull. Quiet and imperious, he emanated coldness, cruelty and subtle manipulation. The OMNI in the center was the most intriguing, for he was extremely handsome and mysterious. His magnetic eyes radiated deep knowledge and although he was assuming a passive role in this visit, it was acknowledged by many that he held the supreme leadership over the three.
“. . . That was the moment when Kurala entered the throne room. She stood surveying the entire scene from the far side of the room. He was struck instantly by her great beauty and then further attracted by her aura of haughty arrogance. As their eyes met, there was the glitter of mutual recognition. Truly it could not be said that this was the first time they had met. And although it was impossible that they had met before, she having previously been an Angel in the Celestial Realms, and he having been sealed up under the planet—in that instant recognition, both of them knew it to be true.
“. . . This was to be Shamo’s greatest moment of glory, for now that the net was cast, destiny began to unravel. The clever King of the Spiders had trapped himself with his pride by overstepping the boundaries of what is allowed by Universal Law.
“ . . .Thus did Kurala develop into a wild warrioress. Her exploits are well chronicled and are probably already known to you. Increasingly, Shamo was left behind on Galaxitron to run the daily duties of the planet, while it was Kurala who commanded the fleet of warships. Although highly successful at the subjugation of minor planets, Kurala soon tired of this limited sphere of activity. Conquering peaceful and backward planets did not keep her adrenaline flowing sufficiently (The one scenario of galactic history is the same as here on earth –conquer and move on). She longed to be engaged in a real challenge. So Kurala began exploring beyond the boundaries set for them by the Dark Lords of Orion. Then is when the trouble began in earnest.
“ . . . Betelgeuse was located in the constellation known as Orion though quite distant from the star system of Rigel, home of the Dark Lords. Orion has held the key patterning for this dimensional universe since its creation. It is the pivotal anchor point for duality hence you will find within this one constellation both the darkest and lightest of energies, forever acting out the roles of good and evil with concentrated focus. Orion chose to embody this template of duality for all of us so we could fully experience matter, separation and illusion.
“The central star, Al Nilam or AN is the major doorway to myriad dimensional universes, hence has been a key point within our sphere of experience. It contains a direct trajectory into the next Great Central



7
Sun System. IT COULD BE SAID ABOUT AN THAT THERE ARE MANY DOORS IN, BUT ONLY ONE DOOR OUT. This is where you will find the All-Seeing Eye.
“. . . And thus it was that the scene was set for the beginning of the end (the war between the Council of Light and the Shamo aligned with the Dark Lords) . . . The High Command readily agreed to this plan. In the meantime, the Vega Fleet was secreting itself on nearby planets ready to help out if needed.
“Within a few days the warships of Galaxitron were sighted. Soon the skies were filled with black warships. These rained down upon Deneb a laser display more frightening to look at, than actually destructive. Then a single sleek black warship bearing the symbol of a single purple orchid landed.
“AAla-dar was there, standing ready when it arrived. He watched as the hatch opened and several large, hairy black spider people disembarked. They were truly ugly, but also somewhat comical swaggering down the gangplank weighed down by numerous prods and laser guns. The spider warriors descended in two lines, then stopped and looked back to the ship anxiously, as if waiting for approval. Within moments, a woman stepped forth confidently from the black craft—a ravishingly beautiful woman, a wildly independent woman, yet one who did indeed, emanate cruelty and arrogance.
“AAlar-dar had not expected his adversary to be a woman, especially not one this beautiful. Of course, he had done battle with female warriors before; there were many of them. But none of them had the combined power, beauty, intelligence or cunning of this one.
“ . . . Kurala was hungry, but she had never tasted fruit or wafers and didn’t know what they were. She had tried some of the food from the small planets they had conquered, but had not found it to her liking. “Do you have any insects?” she asked.
“Insects?” AAla-dar quickly covered up his surprise that this beautiful woman ate insects! “I don’t know, but I’ll ask the kitchen.” He called the kitchen which was as unprepared as was for this request. “I’m sorry, but they are all out of insects today,” he apologized. Of course, spiders are insects, he had forgotten.
“Do they have any flies?” she asked with a degree of impatience.
“He called the kitchen again and they didn’t have any flies. “No flies, but possibly you might try some of this fruit, it’s really quite tasty.” AAlar-dar grabbed a piece of angel fruit off the tray and handed it to her. . .
“. . . Kurala was becoming increasingly anxious to return home. One of the first things she was going to do was to demand that Shamo reveal her true origin. “AAlar-dar has changed me greatly, whether I like it or not,” she thought angrily.
“At last, she curled up on her sleeping mat and fell asleep dreaming about Triple Commanders and stargates, Vega wafers and tender kisses.”
Even brother Philip in his Secret of the Andes supports this idea of Orion being behind it all and of the coming ‘war in heaven”:
“A devil, a dragon, the dragon itself is symbolical and it is always used where they are speaking of the dragon which fights the war in heaven. And it makes war with her seed. What is the ‘seed’ of the Solar System? What is the ‘remnant of the seed’ of the Solar System? – It is people, is it not? In other words, we are having a System war. We of this System are being invaded by those of Orion. Therefore the inhabitants of the Sun System, as well as the inhabitants of the outer worlds—twelve in number each—are preparing for that war in heaven, which begins now and continues for the next three and a half years; which also corresponds to the three and a half of the ‘time, and times, and half.’”

A Gnostic document, found at Chenoboskion in Egypt and known as The Treatise of Hermes Trimistegus states: “It is thus by degrees that the adepts will enter into the way of immortality, and will attain to a conception of the Ogdoad, which in turn reveals the Ennead.”
The Ogdoad (eightfold) corresponds to the heavens of the stars outside the individual heavens of the planets, and the Ennead (ninefold) refers to the greater outer heaven of the universe. The separate heaven of Earth itself was called the Hebdomad (sevenfold). Here the teachings are referring to the different levels of heaven as referred to in the Bible, the various different dimensions we’ve already talked about.
Thus it is that all the mystical orders initiated their followers into their mysteries by ‘degrees’, each new degree signifying a new level of achievement of the knowledge of these ‘heavenly’ worlds, or dimensions.
Just as Noah saved various life forms from the Great Flood, so Lamech’s three sons, Jabal, Jubal and Tubal-Cain, are said to have preserved the ancient wisdoms of creative science carved upon two stone monuments –the ‘Antediluvian Pillars’—antediluvian meaning ‘prior to the flood.’ One son was a mathematician, the second a mason, and the third a metalworker. Surviving the Great Flood by returning to his home planet, Hermes later returned in the time of Egypt as Thoth, the thrice-risen Master. It was Thoth who was said to have transcribed this sacred knowledge onto emerald tablets that were later inherited by no less a figure than Pythagoras.
If all the inventors, scientists and mathematicians we have looked up to throughout history did not exactly come by their wisdom wholly on their own, you will be able to understand what a lie the history is that we have been taught since our childhoods.
Our history is all one big repetition over and over again, and varies little from one country and one culture to the next. The Maya also had the same goddess Maya, mother of the gods and man, as in India. The veil of illusion said to be pulled over our eyes and that separates the dimensions is termed the Veil of Maya –because they knew how man could be trapped by Time.
The association of the sacred knowledge of the cosmos with an emerald tablet is also reminiscent of Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, the legend of the Holy Grail, in which the Grail is identified as a stone and likened to ‘an emerald jewel’. Moreover an inscription from the emerald tablet of Hermes appears on some Temperance Tarot cards: ‘Visit the interior parts of the earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone.’
Through association with the enigmatic Stone, the Grail has been identified with alchemy—the science of concentrating vital currents and life forces. At the time of the Catholic Inquisition, alchemists were careful to veil their art behind symbols of metallurgy claiming that they were attempting only to turn base metals into gold. In philosophical and metaphysical terms, the alchemists were rather more concerned with the transformation of the worldly person (lead) into a spiritually illuminated person (gold). Just as gold was tried and tested in the fire, so the human spirit was tried in the crucible of life—and the agent for this illumination was perceived to be the Holy Spirit.
The Guild of Masons who built Chartres and other French Gothic cathedrals were called the ‘Children of Solomon’. Hiram Abiff, the architect of King Solomon’s temple, was a hermetic alchemist described as ‘an artificer in metals’. His ancient forerunner was Tubal-Cain (Genesis 4:22), the son of Lamech, and the teacher of all who followed. In Freemasonry, Hiram Abiff is identified as the ‘Son of the Widow’ – and in Grail lore, the constant epithet of Perceval is precisely the same. The original ‘widow’ of the Grail bloodline was Ruth the Moabite (heroine of the Book of Ruth) who married Boaz to become the great-grandmother of David. Her descendants were called Sons of the Widow. Boaz is the name given to one of the Two Pillars



9
of Solomon’s Temple in Freemasonry, a coincidental analogy to the Antediluvian Pillars of Lamech, or perhaps a veiled reference to the science and mathematics and the scientists and mathematicians who could rule the world as they did in Atlantis through their knowledge of alchemical Creation.
The underlying principle of Hermes Trimistegus was ‘As above, so below’, denoting that the harmony of earthly proportion is representative of its universal equivalent – in other words, that earthly proportion is the mortal image of cosmological structure—the macrocosm being one and the same as the microcosm. From the smallest cell to the widest expanse of the galaxies, a repetitive geometric law prevails, and this was understood from the very earliest times.
From here on, as we progress through our study of the history of the planet, we shall trace the roots of Hermes through the ancient mysteries of Egypt, Israel, and the West, and with it, the essential power of Lucifer and his attempt to fulfill His promise to become as God of His own Universe, that in which we live, and which is now cordoned off from the rest of the Universe to stop exactly this from happening.
Clow continues this theme from the exploration of her past lives:
“What are the realities of these four archetypes, which also remind me of the four angels of the Apocalypse?
“It is the ultimate taboo: the real truth about primordial control over the mind of man—control of the universe . . . I realize that I do not really possess courage. Then my heart shuts down and the eye can read me . . . This eye communicates to me that teachings from Atlantis have been filtered through many different locations. But the Atlantean teaching that I am supposed to encode in the temple during my life as temple priest in 700 BC is the news that Christ will incarnate from the Pleiades in AD 0 . . . Powerful insights about our origins and development actually exist in the early records of Atlantis, but they are hidden from us because the Nibiruans, the creator gods, realized we could be controlled if we could be made to fear.
“But, alas, all the gateways to Atlantis are charged with fear! For example, in your time the historical records of Atlantis continuously presented to you for the last hundred years are very male oriented and technological. Your latest space shuttle for war research, created in part to make you fear the skies, is even called ‘Atlantis’ . . . History has been nothing more than the projection of fear on Earth. You must remember that the experience of the original people of Earth has been continuously and extensively influenced by visitors from other realms. . . Your teachers from Nibiru and other alien cosmic sources have been so interwoven with the natural evolution of Earth that it is very difficult to remember the original resonance of the Earth or of yourself.”
The Technology
Spica, in the constellation of Virgo, was the source of what Clow refers to as “Atlantean male technology.” Its star trainers were sent to Earth to help establish that technology here. The Masonic
connection to the planet Spica and to its Atlantean colonies can be seen in the layout or alignment of the great Gothic cathedrals in Europe is to exactly that area of the constellation Virgo in which Spica resides.
The Atlanteans had many forms of advanced technology. They were, in truth, far more advanced in most ways than we are here in the United States today. This kind of advanced technology is evidenced by the spiral or concentric circle layout of their cities. I was designed this way to enhance the natural flow of the energies between the people and the Earth to accommodate the gradual changes in the society and its population, and to allow for the most productive use of its land.
It is on the three major types of technological advancement used by the Atlanteans that we wish to concentrate this section—the use of crystals, the manipulation of genes and genetics, and the construction



10
of the buildings, in particular the temples. All of these technologies both were, and still are, being used to manipulate or control people in every aspect of their lives on this planet.
The problem in a nutshell was the scientists. Even back in Lemuria, when the politicians and the scientists got together, the difficulties began in earnest:
“The real trouble started when the Atlantean scientists took over . . . they thought of Earth simply as a colony—they refused to respect the knowledge of the original people.” (Clow)
In discussing the crystal technology, it is helpful to keep in mind that much of our advanced technology today is based on crystals—radios, television, satellites, computers, and lasers, to name just a few. Keep in mind too that even many of the military population are now being implanted with ‘computer chips’ instead of having the old-fashioned dog-tags for identification, much like pets are now being required to do in some states in the USA.
The story of the use of crystals to control people begins more than 45,000 years ago in Lemuria where there were politicians who wanted to remain in office for life. The average life span was about 700 years at the time, so it is not surprising that those in important positions wanted to keep them. Their motivation would have been no different than what we have in today’s government, and ‘crystal implants’ became the ultimate punishment for ‘wrong’ political behavior.
Scientifically advanced Lemuria and Atlantis had ancient records recording the principles of the soul and its awesome energy. The tremendous effect of an intangible, invisible thought upon the tangible, visible physical world was taught in their grade schools. Acupuncturists of today work on the principle that an invisible flow of energy when blocked causes disease in a body. When released, the same energy will heal the body and keep it healthy. For healing purposes, the Lemurians and Atlanteans valued this knowledge and used it in conjunction with their energy soul charts. They knew that, when in the body, the soul emits a strong measurable energy at specific points. They knew each point had an effect upon their life. The Lemurian and Atlantean energy studies pointed out individuals with high energy flow as having incredible abilities. A high energy flow person could, with a little practice, have complete mastery of the physical laws. He or she could be a natural teacher, philosopher, healer, or leader. Given the opportunity, their natural charisma attracted followers. The higher energy was not necessarily an indication of good, it merely pointed to an ability. This is why Cayce says many of the people he did life readings for misused their powers. With thought alone, high-energy souls (those created with the full complement of Light) could change the planet, change any government, or change anyone’s mind. These are the qualities so readily evident in George Lucas’s Jedi Knights in the Star Wars series of movies.
Things all began after a slave revolt similar to the later one of Spartacus against Imperial Rome. Instead of crucifying the unruly slaves, however, a politician hypothesized the possible use of a new crystalline invention designed for animals. Crystals were discovered at the time to have an effect on ferocious animals. A crystal implanted within an angry bull’s skull could be ‘programmed’ to send a calming energy to its brain. It permanently tamed the animal. It was a valuable agricultural invention, saving formerly dangerous domestic animals from premature destruction.
Crystals, the politician reasoned, could be thought-programmed for almost anything. He knew the mind was comprised of pure thought. By limiting its ability to think, the person would subsequently also be limited. A limited mind, a decreased potential, would make most change extremely difficult. If a crystal could be programmed to calm animals, could it actually calm parts of a slave’s mind? Perhaps if implanted in potential trouble-making slaves they would not try to overthrow their betters. That is how it all started on this planet in humans.



11
At first, it was the implanting of slaves and test-tube babies which they called “vat-babies”. It was reasoned at the time that both were classified as animals, not humans, so it was all right to do implants. Pretty soon, however, the leaders started checking the energy flow of all new-borns, implanting all that might endanger the leadership of the time. Crystals were actually implanted by cutting into the soft tissue and placing them in strategic points within the body.
The nature of crystal programming is that a program continues until it is erased or removed. The Lemurian/Atlantean Control Devices were crystals implanted and programmed to limit and decrease potential. The programs created frustration and ineffectiveness. For as many as 40 percent of the population who still today carry in their etheric bodies the imprint of those crystals implanted in past lives, the programs were never erased and are still extraordinarily active. Mercury used during the implant surgery caused mental confusion. Combine the mercury and confusion with endorphins (a hormone secretion present in the brain in times of creative thought and in times of pain), the estrogen/testosterone levels, and a programmed crystal sliver, and you get an implant that would remain in the implanted person’s etheric body from lifetime to lifetime—even over 45,000 years. Added to all this are the problems surrounding physical cell memory and our own personalized subconscious programs from that life and every life since then.
Even though by now our Lemurian and Atlantean bodies are dust, the crystals buried within us did not lie dormant. Back in its natural environment, it resumed its natural physical growth pattern with the program merely waiting for us to incarnate into a body of the same sex as we had in the lifetime in which we were implanted.
The Lemurian and Atlantean crystals can be likened to a radio station and our body a tuned in, turned on radio. In this example the crystal’s program is the wavelength used in the radio; invisible, clear, strong. Our mind is accepting this program. Unlike the radio example, however, we also send and receive transmissions. Subconscious thought is transmitted by everyone. That transmission is invisible. Like the crystals, we, in turn, broadcast out our own programs. All minds send and receive invisible thought. What if the invisible thought is ‘everyone abuses me?’ The thought will attract people and situations to abuse the sender. If the subconscious thought is ‘I am successful’, the thought will attract success. The attraction is the thought. Crystals were programmed thoughts of limitation. Our strongest natural abilities were programmed to be our weaknesses, causing great personal frustration each lifetime. It’s extremely frustrating knowing internally that our life really could be easier if we could only remember how to do it. Imagine a lifetime without limitations, without interference. That is the way life was designed to be.
These crystals [in imprint form within our energy fields] that are still working in many of us today can be removed from our memory and our mind. The actual crystal imprint systems can be found and their programs erased. By doing so, the crystals are removed. The systems have to be removed in the opposite order in which they were implanted. Those who have crystal implants know without being told by someone else that there is something wrong. Often when hearing about the devices they will instinctively know to ask their inner-self. The crystals are also programmed with self-defense mechanisms that elicit a strong sense of fear in the carrier when anyone hints at their existence or threatens their removal. If a person tries to exceed these programmed limitations the crystals were programmed to turn cancerous, or some other form of serious bodily disintegration. This can be seen in the many successful figures who come down with strange or exotic maladies at the seeming height of their careers, i.e. Michael J. Fox.
It is also true that this technology of manipulation did not just begin in Lemuria either. Many of the ‘star seeds’ sent to colonize the planet in the beginning were implanted by the leaders of their own world so that they would still be controllable, and would follow the agenda of their leaders. The convict ‘star seeds’ sent



12
to the planet were particularly limited by these kind of programmed crystals as a part of their punishment, much like convicts today are often made to wear electronic ankle bracelets or collars.
The crystals implanted during the star seeding in the early Lemurian age were very large, about the size of a person’s thumb. There were many crystals to a system, and the technology of implanting them was very much more primitive—often matters of hit or miss as it were. The crystals from the later stages of Lemuria were small slivers held together by programmed energy, resembling a string of Christmas lights.
Many of the later Atlantean crystals were called ‘Master Crystals’. They could be compared with our computer chip today, carrying hundreds of programs or limitations in just one crystal. It therefore only took only one or two Master Crystals to do the work of many of the older ones. These Master Crystals were about the size of a credit card, only made of crystalline material, and were and are programmable from another dimension, even still today.
Some people are still being implanted today in certain kinds of ‘alien abduction’. These vary in the type of implant being used. The small metallic implants so commonly found these days by doctors and shown on television shows are simply a smokescreen for the deeper problem involved with these crystalline implants.
Barbara Clow has an example of one of her ‘memories’ from a past lifetime that directly addresses this issue, as well as many others we have been dealing with here with regard to Atlantis:
“From behind the scenes of male Atlantis I gained new insights into the great technological island with a crystal in the center that sank because of the human obsession with power and control.
“I see myself looking out from the inside of a metallic suit . . . to protect me from radiation. I wear it whenever I go inside the Atlantean photon laboratory . . . . other parts of our kingdom have various names such as Eire, Poseidea, Khemit, and Maya. This particular island called Atlantis . . . sank during a great cataclysm about twelve thousand years ago.
“. . . “mutant gene 037”. . simply explained these are DNA readouts of a mutant person located far away in Eire . . . the photon informs me that energy is being received by this being in Eire from his stellar source, Hizor—a star called Thuban in later times.
“One thing I do feel is anger. There are big areas of my body where there is no energy, but there is too much energy in my liver. I am angry about the central source and angry about my conditioning . . . They have even conditioned me to deal with my anger! Every move I make is angry; it is the only way I can do this work. And if I quit, I am conditioned to die of cancer before I cause any trouble.
“All of us have been conditioned like laboratory animals. As for me, I was first conditioned by television. I watched it for hours as a child. The sex and violence caused strong destructive feelings. Later, the educational system taught me that spiritual feelings are imaginary. Then when I studied to be a scientist, I was conditioned to fear anything nonscientific—anything on the Earth that is not controlled.
“I also learned that women are irrational, weak, and destructive. In fact, if you want to know about it, I was conditioned to hate women. . . When I was unhappy and upset in my twenties, I was given tranquilizers and stimulants and tapes were prescribed to help me feel good. But the tapes contained subliminal messages that taught me to fear my own feelings . . . Now I am bored.
“. . . part of the original conditioning was erasure of cultural memory. . . Under orders from Hatonn, the scientist king of Atlantis, we broadcast a program through the central crystal to everyone on the planet that prevented them from being able to remember their own stories . . . Hatonn believed that if all individual



13
“units” were stripped of their person; meaning—their story in time, the myths of their ancestors and memories of Earth—they could be encoded with pure stellar information. . .”
Clow’s work here agrees that the purpose of the modern New World Order is to destroy the basic root understanding of life that each person on Earth naturally possesses within them.
Most sources on Atlantis speak of the later times before its final destruction when crystal technology was used to power the continent. Here is an example of how the crystals were also used to power the transportation system, much as I remember from my own experience how the Anasazi powered their ‘roadway tubes’.
“Let's talk about the transportation systems in Atlantis. Much of how the populace was moved from one point to the other took place in crystal chambers. When they entered these crystal chambers their molecules were transferred from one crystal chamber to another crystal chamber. There were no transportation systems, as we know them today. There was intergalactic space travel. While there was physical spacecraft, often the travel was by energy transference. Remember that Atlanteans were the masters of energy. They understood energy as it has never been understood on this planet before or since.”
Cayce reported that the ‘initiates’ of Atlantis (reading #440-5; 1933) engineered and manipulated precious power crystals for the production of galvanic and spiritual energies. The crystals were so potent that they were in large part responsible for the Atlantean’s advanced technology. Later in Atlantis history, when crystals were improperly used they contributed to the final destruction of the island-empire.
These crystals were housed in an oval temple, the roof of which rolled back to admit light from the sun and stars which activated the ‘white fire stones’. During Roman times the Druid priests told Julius Caesar that the Gauls believed their ancestors came to Europe unremembered millennia before from the “Isle of Glass Towers,” long drowned in the Atlantic, “far-off Iberian shores.” These ‘glass towers’ would be the central crystal temples.
The early 2nd century Ad Lucian of Samosota, in his history Vara, described a large highly civilized island-city that sank into the Atlantic “ages before our own.” But before it disappeared forever beneath the waves, one of its outstanding features was a ‘crystal building’.
The old Irish Voyage of Maildune contains a description of Atlantis which, detail for detail, is very close to Plato’s account but contains this additional piece of information: the inner wall of the great island palace Maildune visited was profusely decorated with crystal. This inner wall, according to Plato, surrounded the Temple of Poseidon, the Atlantean Holy-of-Holies, which again is reminiscent of Cayce’s life ‘readings.’
One of the most outstanding features of the crystal technology that the Atlanteans possessed was what Kryon calls the Temple of Rejuvenation. Not only were the crystals used for control, but also for practical purposes as well, in this case for healing.
The Temple of Rejuvenation was the building where humans were repolarized! Most of the walls were made up of a composition of material which could not be magnetized. Some of this composition was a mixture of crushed crystals. The process involved the repolarization of the body using an idea common around the world of the sacredness of the four directions in combination with the power and potency of doing things in threes.
Within the sphere of the room where this took place, there was the idea of rotation within rotation, for it was the motion which was the catalyst for the magnetics which did the actual polarization. Contained in the



14
spire below the room were mechanics that match the ones contained in the spire above, and working together to facilitate the mechanism of the balancing engine.
Kryon comments that nowhere in our “modern” medical facilities do we find anyone who is measuring the polarity of our organs and our magnetic balance, let alone adjusting it (although this is rapidly beginning to change). This technology which was so commonly known in Atlantis, he says, is essential to our well being and overall health, and only recently have people become aware of the danger as well as the benefits of electro-magnetic fields influencing their bodies.
“How can your scientists miss this when they can measure the electricity of your muscles, and your brain? . . . and when they can map the wiring of your body and see the results of synapse in your biological thinking? All this is magnetics! . . . The polarity of your human body is a “handshake” to the polarity of the Earth. . . . Each organ has its own polarity, which is interactive with the organ next to it . . . there are two kinds of polarity: there is absolute, and relative. The absolute polarity is like a dipole, that is to say that the positive and negative alignment remains the same regardless of the physical inclination of the human. The relative polarity is that kind of polarity which changes with the inclination of the human. Two of the main organs have relative polarity: The human skin, and the brain. All polarized organs will respond to the polarity of the planet, and the relative ones will also respond to the physical inclination of the human . . . It (polarity) is measured through the fingertips.”
A computer program has recently been invented that when hooked to the fingertips displays the entire ever-changing electro-magnetic aura of the entire body, much as Kirlian photography takes a snapshot of it.
“The direction of motion has purpose. . . spinning to the left (counterclockwise), above the equator, or zero parallel, this is a gentle nudge for your polarity. . . It is good for health, and retains balance. Above the zero parallel, a right movement (clockwise) is for healing . . . for there is more energy developed through this right spin direction. What I am telling you now is opposite for those on the bottom . . . as you view the Earth on your maps, below the zero parallel.
“Your aura is the sum and difference of the polarity, and changes with the balance and health of the individual. . . Above and below the zero parallel, it works not necessarily because of the rotation of the planet, but because above the zero parallel there is a positive influence of the giant dipole, and below is the negative influence. . . Consider the human being to be polarized . . . use both hands on both sides of the human. Top and bottom . . . front and back.”
This is very much resembles what the Noah-like figure said to Gilgamesh in The Epic of Gilgamesh: “I will reveal to thee, Gilgamesh, a hidden matter, a secret of the gods I will tell thee. Everlasting life is attained not by being immortal—it is attained by staying young forever!” And what Gilgamesh saw at the time was “an enclosure of the gods wherein there was a garden; but the “garden” was made up entirely of artificially carved precious stones: “All kinds of thorny Prickly Bushes were visible, blooming with gemstones; Carnelian bore fruit hanging in clusters, its vines too beautiful to behold. The foliage was of lapis lazuli; and grapes, too lush to look at, of . . stones were made.” The partly damaged verses go on to list other kinds of fruit-bearing trees and the variety of precious stones—white and red and green—of which they were made. Pure water ran through the garden, and in its midst he saw “like a Tree of Life and a Tree of . . . that of An-gug stones were made.”
So the experience Gilgamesh was having was much like that of seeing some version of the Atlantean Temple of Rejuvenation. This was a way for the alien ‘gods’ to keep youthful in the very dense vibrations of this planet. Even though the planet was of a higher vibration at the time of Lemuria when the average life



15
span was 700 years, toward the end off Atlantis it was very near to becoming fully 3rd dimensional—a very dense level indeed for our off-world ‘visitors.’
“When you understand how to use energy, when you understand the vibrational form of energy, you are totally unlimited. There is nothing you cannot achieve once you understand energy and the vibrational form of energy. There is not anything you cannot create. Atlantis became the Mecca of that understanding. Atlanteans became superior in their knowledge to those beings that had established Atlantis. Those that founded Atlantis left behind enough knowledge that the great human resourcefulness of the human soul, was able to evolve very quickly. When humanity is not diversifying your energies with conflict, you have no idea of how superior your ability of creativity is nor how far reaching your possibilities. We would say to you, "You have not been willing to give up your own inner conflict let alone the conflict in your world and therefore you are not aware of your own greatness." Atlanteans did not experience conflict in their Golden Age they came to be masters at understanding and using energy. Others no longer came from distant galaxies to help the Atlanteans, but rather they came to learn from this great culture. The Atlanteans developed the technology that brought beings from all through the galaxy to Atlantis. Many had not developed the technology to travel to Earth. The Atlanteans had the technology to bring them here. Atlanteans became the superior masters of their time and gods of the universe, so to speak. They were known for open-armed embracement of all things. They became known for understanding of life. They were also known for their beautiful Healing Temple. We do not have the words to convey to you the beauty, the power and the simplicity of the Atlantean Healing Temple.”
This idea of a temple where Beings could rejuvenate themselves is also repeated in The Egyptian Book of the Dead where the Pharaoh must go in search of the Tree of Life and the Water of Life in a garden much like that described by Gilgamesh, though in less detail. All these places in truth are simply large crystalline genetics regenerators. The Great Pyramid had similar properties when once it was crowned with its capstone of crystal and insulated by its limestone facing.
Much like a hand-held version of this crystal regenerator was the item used on Inanna in another legend of the gods from about this same time, one retold by Zecharia Sitchin: After getting the lifeless body of Inanna, “upon the corpse they directed the Pulser and the Emitter,” then sprinkled her body with the Water of Life and gave her the Plant of Life, “and Inanna arose.”
Drinking water in which crystals have been ‘soaked’ is a very common way of ingesting crystal energy, much like the idea used to create homeopathic remedies.
Alexander of Macedonia, who claimed to be partly divine and claimed a right to Immortality, went to Egypt in 332 BC especially to consult the Oracle of Amon at the oasis of Siwah about his divine parentage. There he goes to seek the Well of the Water of Life, and when he finds it, it was “inlaid with sapphires and emeralds and jacinths.” These are exactly the kinds of ideas that made precious stones precious.
Just as radiation can destroy or mutate genetics, so too can crystal energy rejuvenate DNA, the genetics of the body, and the organs. As we shall see later on, another major element of human history which has had a great effect on the field of human genetics and the progress of civilization is the incidence of the planet’s periodic pole shifts. Much of the encoding on the DNA is electro-magnetic, just as are the thought processes of the brain. When the Earth’s magnetic poles shift, as they have been recorded to do, much of human memory and its DNA encoding can be lost. When this happens civilization returns to a state of veritable ‘savagery’ in terms of what it knows and can do, just as hypothesized by Churchward. This explains what the Nine have to say about needing to re-encode or re-imprint information that has been lost for one reason or another in trying to upgrade humanity.

The Atlanteans were well-versed in all these fields. They were not the only ones on the planet at that time to be manipulating the genetics of the races and holding the population in virtual slavery, however, as we shall see when we deal with the Annunaki of Ancient Sumeria. Again, Clow describes the Atlantean use of genetic manipulation:
“I, Alcior, am an Atlantean stellar being . . . I am a carrier of the blood of the stars—one of the pure stellar beings who traveled here from outer space. As for the earth-born people, some are indigenous while some are mutants spawned by “stellar implantation”. . from their central genetics laboratory in Atlantis, we stellar beings bred ourselves with Earth beings. Stellar sources mixed with Earth creatures have varying offspring. In this photon laboratory, I study how the stellar imprint affects the Earthling. We tell the people that we are doing this in order to eliminate disease, but the real reason we are doing it is to gain control of the Earth.
“. . . the only way extraterrestrials, such as myself, can understand humans is by means of decoding human DNA. . . . The Atlantean project is to assist in the process of the stellar encodement of humans . . . In other words we read the cosmic evolutionary cycles through humans on earth! . . . we need this information in order to determine the stability of Earth in the Solar System—particularly so that we can
evacuate Earth at certain times. . . That is why we first came to Earth three hundred thousand years ago. . . For example, a photon from the star Aldebaran contains information on the functioning of Aldebaran consciousness. It is very musical, very mathematical, very harmonic, and very powerful for the right hemisphere of the human brain.
“When the crystal is charged, all of the mutants will move into “stellar fusion.”. . . Mutant Earthlings will fuse with the powers of their own original stars, we will live on Earth when we want to, and the rulers of Atlantis will control it all.”
The Atlanteans had great powers to manipulate energy of all types. In their experimentation with the weather they even caused storms on the planet that they did not understand. They also had aircraft and could fly. An example of these flying machines can be found carved into the pillars of a room in the Great Pyramid in Egypt which is closed to the public. Much like modern man and his electrical appliances, however, they grew lazy because all they had to do was just take the energy and do whatever it was they wanted to do. As Kryon says, Atlantis had some of the highest channeled science ever known to mankind, existing right next to slavery. According to Clow, it is then that they became obsessed with power and “committed the great sins.”
Chapter 11 The Atlantean Branch Breaks
Many of these “sins” revolved around the crystal implants as discussed, but many others revolved around the manipulation of genetics and other types of implantations. As the dense physicality of the planet began to affect them, they also became overwhelmed by the emotional feeling involved with that physicalness. As the Nine express it, they “became very involved in the creation of larger and more prominent mating organs. They also attempted through their scientific knowledge and understanding to genetically exchange creatures with soul beings on Planet Earth–through transplanting . . . by creating these creatures they would perhaps have the strength of the creature, or the creature could be serving them, or they could develop a means for more physical pleasure (shades of Dr. Moreau).”

“The modern civilization has only attained a part of what Atlantis had attained. They had all the knowledge of using the mind to move objects and themselves (teleportation). If it had not been that below their waist they were always in trouble, then it would have been a fine civilization . . . We have no objections to enjoyment – it is when it become all-consuming.”
The Nine also add that the Atlanteans had great abilities in the field of transplantation of human organs such as the heart and even the brain, but again, used much of this kind of knowledge to improve the size of their sex organs. Life expectancy at times on Atlantis could be up to a few thousand years, and this is the kind of knowledge of ‘never growing old’ that was transplanted into ancient Egypt and subsequently into the patriarchs of ancient Hebrew culture as well.
This history of Atlantis is “all within the mind of the dolphins,” say the Nine, but much of it has also been known to the initiates of those hermetic organizations we referred to earlier.
H.G. Wells' story, The Island Of Dr. Moreau, tells the story of a great scientist in self-imposed exile who creates an island full of hybrids and half-breeds, animal/human mixes, in pursuit of his ultimate goal to create a perfect human by mixing the traits of the two.
These experiments are an archetype of the animal-man, the half-human/half animal. They represent a shadow side of man which is not just the polarity of female versus male, but a polarity which lay within the Creator Parents of this particular Universe themselves. It is a polarity almost of violence and power versus the balancing polarity of love. These are the two sides of man, the animal nature versus the spiritual nature. This is classic psychology. What it boils down to is that there are two forces in the universe, much as described in Gnostic thought, a good versus evil. In all our actions we either work from the point of view of love, or from the point of view of power. Our motivation, our intent, decides our actions and reactions, and sets the courses of our lives.
Dr. Moreau’s island, the struggles and the experimentation going on there, and the fact that it was isolated from the rest of the world, is a metaphor for the role planet Earth plays in the Universe. Again, it is the microcosm reflected in the macrocosm which is the whole Super Universe. As Hermes puts it, ‘As above, so below.’ Only, in this case, there is more to it for things also work the other way around. Whereas we are the reflections of the archetypes that out Cosmic Parents were, so too do we have the ability to create anew our own futures and even our own pasts, and to heal what has gone on before. We also have the ability to manifest this to the Universe at large. It is just as correct, therefore, to say that ‘As below, so above,’ for as we are learning, as we progress through this history, what we do on this experiment called Earth affects the universe as well.
In the newest movie version of The Island of Dr. Moreau, Marlon Brando plays the scientist who everybody calls “Father.” The unsuccessful animal/human hybrids wander the island or exist in their own colony, controlled through the use of, what-else, crystal computer-chip implants. The Father meters out justice or punishment through the use of a remote control which causes these implants to create varying degrees of pain in the hybrid. Brando’s character cannot understand what the problem is that keeps these beings still hostile. The young assistant played by Val Kilmer casually mentions that he has found the answer while looking through the microscope at a specimen of blood, something he calls “the Lucifer gene.”
Dr. Moreau must also give his animal-men daily shots of synthetic hormones to keep them from reverting to their original forms. This is analogous of the constant influx of new genetic material into our species which keeps us from reverting to a more primitive state such as occurred during the first seedings, referred to by the Nine. Without this constant mixing and changing we would quite possible face the same



18
dilemma currently faced by those aliens we have termed the Grays. Their race, as explained previously, is dying out because of their inability to find new genetic material for their gene pool. This situation is one which has been explained by the Grays to many of the abductees with whom they work in trying to create alien/human offspring, although it is not totally true—they do have their own agenda that goes far beyond just this one.
As hybrids, the half animal/half human creatures on Moreau’s island needed hormone shots to keep their mixed genetic factors stable and their immune systems repressed. The one creature, the hyena/man, which begins the rebellion on the island, pulls out this implant and refuses to line up for his shots anymore. Many others begin to follow suit, and the island is soon decimated in the rebellion and once again reverts to its primitive state.
As we shall soon see, this is exactly the kind of thing that happens to our planet after each successive earth-shattering cataclysm. Mankind is returned to a primitive state from which he must once again emerge into semi-consciousness in order to rebuild civilization once again. It is particularly the case after each major civilization is destroyed and those who survive in isolated outposts are cut off from the sources of their knowledge and support for their culture. It has happened time and time again throughout Earth’s history.
What is important here, however, is that when one finds out that H.G.Wells was associated with these Hermetic organizations in which this knowledge was commonly known by the higher initiates, one begins to take a second look at ‘this lie’ that we call history. The conspiracy grows even greater when one learns, too, as we shall later, that most of the famous people of history have been involved in some way or another with one these secret organizations. Each one of these organizations (of which there is truly only one with many different branches) has preserved this ‘secret’ information and rationed it out to those of their initiates most worthy to implement and administer the changes which the information would bring about in society. This, in fact, has been going on for more than the past 10,000 years.
Our modern culture is filled with deep reminisces of the Atlantis. Much of this can be seen in the new and expanding medium for the preservation of such deep-seated knowledge—the movies. Science, however, labels it science-fiction for fear that they will lose their power if we begin to take such myths and legends seriously. The destruction of Superman’s home planet, Krypton, in the Superman series of comic books and movies, is one such example of a cultural memory of Atlantis resurfacing after the destruction of Maldek, although it has happened to many other civilizations and on many other planets as well.
As with the fictional planet Krypton, when Atlantis was destroyed many understood that the end was coming, as is always the case at the end of a cycle. The Atlanteans were adept at experiencing many levels beyond the “physical” which was at that time more 4th dimensional. Since they had attained total control over their astral bodies during their civilization, they made sure they could get through into the future if they so desired. All they needed was to establish a place or places on the planet which they could tie into in order to be able to influence world affairs and still control the power bases on the planet—these were the portals and ancient sacred sites over which so many new temples and religious structures have been built. This is where the temple technology and crystal technology they had acquired from their home planets became so useful.
The continuation of our myth involving Jupiter and his bride Europa is the story of Daedalus and Icarus:
“An interesting story is told of Minos while he was still a ruler of Crete. He had as one of his servants a man named Daedalus, a skilled mechanic and worker in metals and an ingenious inventor—the father so to



19
speak of all inventors. It was Daedalus who devised for Minos a complicated series of tunnels and windows called the labyrinth in which was confined the Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull.
“Later Daedalus lost the favor of Minos, who imprisoned him and his son, Icarus. But Daedalus set his mind to work on finding a means to escape. Finally he devised a pair of wings for himself and a pair for Icarus. He fastened them to his own shoulders and to those of the boy, using wax as binding material. Then both triumphantly flew away. Swiftly they skimmed through the air and closer and closer they came to the mainland. But Icarus, flushed with excitement and exhilaration, soared ever higher towards the sundespite the cries and warnings of his father. At last he flew so high that the heat from the sun melted the wax. And off dropped the wings. The lad plunged downwards into the sea and was drowned. The sea into which he fell was later called the Icarian Sea. Daedalus escaped, and for a long time lived in Sicily.”
Like the analogy of Icarus, and following in the steps of their mentor, Lucifer, the dark sorcerer kings of Atlantis, those who had come from the constellations of Sirius and Orion, tried to fly too high and make themselves gods as well; gods over many dimensional levels as well as simply planets.
Their involvement with the initiatory rites such as were practiced in the ancient Egyptian mystery schools and still carried on today by the various secret societies throughout the world, is critical to their continuing domination of this planet, both its peoples and its resources.
Temple Technology
Perhaps the most efficient and diabolic form of technology for implementing this control is temple technology. It has been passed down to the secret societies and upper echelons of the various religious groups to one degree or another since that time of the sinking of Atlantis.
Temple technology involves the use of sacred geometry to create architecture which mimics the structure of the Universe in its ability to both send out energy to Creation, or in turn, receive it back. These buildings then are, in and of themselves, transmitters and receptors of energy from this planet into the higher realms of existence.
This manipulation of people’s belief in a Higher Power is another one of the central themes of this book. It is also obviously central to our following the energies of Lucifer as they interact with the planet in his attempt to make himself God of his own Universe.
We shall give some of the background of the technology as it relates to the Atlanteans here, and then continue on with it throughout the book so that the reader can follow the importance of its role to our history.
In Zecharia Sitchin’s works it states that temple technology came to the planet at the same time as kingship, somewhere around 3,000 BC. This is obviously incorrect, since temples had been in existence even in the ancient days of Lemuria. What happened after the Great Flood was the level of importance placed on temple technology in the control and utilization of the people. Whereas when the ‘gods’ had been on the planet themselves control of the people had taken many forms, after they ‘left’ and the planet became fully 3rd dimensional, then the temples became the prime method by which their energies could be manipulated. It is not unusual then to see the secret brotherhoods adopting religions through which they could build temples and attract followers in order to manipulate them.
The major form of temple we wish to discuss here is the primary temple form of Atlantis used to lay out there cities. The island described earlier in Plato’s The Critias, is an accurate description of the basic temple form. This temple form and the complete culture of Atlantis were also used in many other places on the planet. One of the most perfect Atlantean ruins is on Malta, but every powerful temple on the planet has



20
most of these characteristics, although often in a somewhat diminished form. The Temple of Solomon, the Pyramids of South America, and even the great Gothic Cathedrals of Europe, all reflect Atlantean temple technology ideals. Wherever Man has realized the significance of his houses of worship, this temple form has been used to at least some extent. The description that has come down through Plato from Solon, the Greek priest who studied in Egypt, is a map of the surface form—a ‘templ-ate’ if you will.
The temple form used by the Atlanteans is predominantly a series of spiraling concentric circles, the circle always having been representative of the True Creator or as the sacred symbol for ‘God.’ The main crystal remains in the center, representing the Central Universe or primary source of energy. The other areas moving outward represent the rest of Creation through which this energy is then spread. Notice how most temples, mosques, or cathedrals have crystal chandeliers or lead-crystal stained glass windows strategically placed to act in this capacity. Of course the center of most temples or mosques etc is the individual ‘Holy of Holies’.
The whole temple form is a labyrinth structure such as the one laid out on the floor of Chartres Cathedral in France. In this role its spiritual purpose is to harness the energies of the Soul and to bring about manifestation of peace and harmony within a person’s being, or to manifest whatever it is that are the person’s (hopefully) spiritual goals—though it may also be used incorrectly for manifesting any material goals.
The labyrinth is the microcosm of this macrocosmic form built to represent the various layers of a man and the various dimensions of his Being—a template of the design of Creation itself.
The concentric circles in the one temple form represent the dimensions spiraling up from the Earth and surrounding the planet. To use this form correctly is to lift one’s self above the immediate lower worlds and upwards along the spiraling form into the higher spiritual worlds from which all manifestation has its origins. Used in the wrong form it can be one of the darkest forms of control, sucking the energy from the oblivious congregation, magnifying and beaming their energies through its spires to the heavens to whatever planet, star, frequency or point the temple is aligned with. It is a direct connection to those alien races responsible for or guiding the building of the temple. In Atlantis, under the sorcerer kings, the energy was beamed directly to Sirius and Orion to support the Dark One Himself. In Mormonism, the alignment is to the ‘planet on which God resides”—Kolab or Kolob (kol-ab: the heart of darkness).
Techniques developed at the end of 1993 (Physical Review Letters, December 1993) can make longdistance holograms appear with the aid of only one laser beam focused on a crystal. In ‘religious’ transmitters such as the Ark of the Covenant—the holographic images appeared between the wings of the angels –the poles—where God was said to ‘appear’ to speak to those who were worthy, those who were protected by the lead shield and jewel encrusted Urim and Thummim.
The Great Pyramid, as we shall discover, also had alignments with Sirius and Orion, and its purpose was very much the same thing.
Jackson Judge, a researcher into ancient mounds and archeological sites in Ohio, believes there is absolutely no doubt that the Atlanteans built Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid. Judge also maintains that the Citadel of Atlantis was the first pyramid built on earth, and that certain other Mound Builder sites are schematics of star charts and the most complex concepts in modern physics:
“The double horse-shoes at the largest ancient city of North America are dead-ringers, and the Giza complex was built after the second largest Mound Builder city at New-Ark, OH. The city of Atlantis is also



21
the largest strand of DNA in the world, a ten mile-long double-helix: indicating a deliberate human genetic cross c.125, 000 BC."
The center of this temple form is where the central crystal was housed. Then there must be circles of land around the crystal, alternating with circular canals—water being a primary source of radiating or transmitting energies. The land beyond the last circle of water may be farmland, grazing fields, wild plains, or jungles. Beneath the great crystal are sacred caves, usually of limestone, where smaller crystals grow. Lacking these, caves are constructed to access the telluric forces of the planet
The Gothic cathedrals in Europe were all built in a large pattern or array laid out specifically around the countryside in the cities of France, and even into Scotland where Rosslyn Chapel resides. As John Michell has discovered, this grand array is aligned with the planet Spica in the constellation of Virgo, as mentioned before, the home of Atlantean technology.
Sacred springs beneath the temples were either natural or artificially created, such as the water canals under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Streams were also diverted to act in the same regard under many Mayan or Aztec temples in Mexico and on into Central and South America. Large baptismal fonts such as the one beneath the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City act for much the same purpose when the water is then allowed to run free through carefully planned water troughs.
Water is a wonderful conductor of electricity. The energies of those who are bathed in the font are collected and distributed through this intricate system of energy enhancers. This follows the principle of not immediately showering after lovemaking as described in the Taoist books on sex. The energy of companionship and love are washed away and thereby depleted if one showers immediately after sex. The energy of crocodiles rolling and mating in silica clay was used in the Crocodile Temples of ancient Egypt for exactly this same purpose of generating electricity (though in this case it also relates to the reptilian ancestry of many of our alien forebears).
The circular pillars and plaza around the central obelisk at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican are representative of this temple form, the whole construction becoming one giant circular dish antennaewhich it easily resembles. Avebury Circle in England is also supposed to be constructed in this temple form above a crystal cave in Swallows Barrow (now called West Kennet Barrow), and all are built with or on chalk layers (limestone). The layer of casing which once covered the Pyramids at Giza was made of limestone but was later stripped to make buildings in the surrounding areas.
As Clow describes it, the star and earth teachings meet at the power point in the central crystal. The communication to the center of the earth then goes from the sky through this crystal and spreads out circulating through the water to all of the land surrounding it. The concentric circles of water radiate the emotion al energes of the inhabitants inwardly to the center and then out again to the stars. Temples are places full of emotions and our religions do everything they can to build those emotions within the walls of the temples to heighten the amount of energy that can be transferred to those receiving these energies. Sin was instituted not for the purpose of giving Man a choice of whether to choose god or not, but to heighten the strongest negative emotion, that of fear, which could be then be manipulated in these temples exactly for the purpose of harnessing the very strong energy of this emotion.
These constructions can be almost any size (temple size or city size), as long as the essential form is honored. In a large complex, dwelling places or even a whole city can be contained in the land circles with great surrounding farms to feed the population. Our modern cities with their urban business district full of tall, glass(crystalline) spire-shaped office buildings surrounded by successive areas of industry and suburbia stay true to this Atlantean temple form and for exactly the same reasons. As the Central Business



22
District of a city dies, so too does the city until that downtown center can be revitalized. Ever wonder why there has been such an emphasis over the past 20 years to revitalize the downtown areas of the large American cities?
Because human desires manifest realities, the main crystal of a temple form should be kept completely free of human desires to remain pure. Since people create with intent, all creations are a direct result of the clarity and purity of the lives of those people.
Clow says that when the Spican teaching was pure, the Spican crystal being the interface between earth and sky, it circulated knowledge and harmony of all kinds. The sacred spring circulated feelings from the Earth through the waters to the land, and the people then attuned to these pulsations. As long as the proper intention was maintained, the form functioned correctly.
This living temple form is the source of all the legends about the central crystal of Atlantis. Remnants of this form still exist, as said, in places like Avebury. That is why many megalithic sites have henges and moats around them. Glastonbury was once surrounded by rings of water. Many churches were built over such sites, their sacred springs gushing under altars built over subterranean caves. Chartres Cathedral has a closed off spring in the basement directly underneath the labyrinth. In ancient Egypt, this form radiated from the central temples of the Nile, and its canals circulated the water during the annual flooding.
Most importantly, the structure circulated the vibrations of the Earth in its spin around the sun into cosmic fields known as vortexes. These help support or maintain the creation of the higher worlds or dimensions surrounding the planet, as well as channeling energy from the higher worlds down into the lower planes, and indeed to support the Earth and the entire 3rd dimensional world. Understand now why what goes on here on Earth affects the entirety of Creation? Any pebble dropped in a pond creates a very large ripple effect.
The center has the most concentrated energy, while the outside realms have more diversity. This allows individuals to activate various kinds of energy in themselves during various cycles of their personal lives. In short, the system is a maze that offers mystery, integrity, intention, centering, exploration, and challenge. It helps activate the people on Earth.
In many cases the living temple form was built over already existing caves that had been sacred sites during earlier times. The most powerful Atlantean temples were built over such caves—as Teotihuacan, Tenochitlan, Malta, Abydos, Knossos, Santa Fe, and even Atlanta, according to Clow. Denver should also be included.
The temple form also controlled population because everyone understood that it was not to be enlarged beyond the original three circles. First a sacred temple was built in the center over the sacred caves; then the first people—the ‘ancestors’—developed the first circle of land. Then their children then moved out and built the second circle. When the grandchildren of the first people became adults, they developed the third circle.
The first circle became the home of the grandfathers and grandmothers who in turn became the wisdom keepers of the temple. The second circle became the home of the parents with grown children and the adults with no children. The third circle was the home for the young families. This outer location enabled the children and young parents to roam the outlying forests, commune with animals, and do their vision quests. By the time these people matured and moved into the middle circle they had found their purpose: work for the village and personal spiritual direction. Then they played and stretched their creativity to the maximum, spending great amounts of time learning from their children.



23
As said before, this parallels the cycle of the inner cities and suburbia of today, only in our case, the form never ends until it has eaten up all the land. It also parallels the levels of experience in the circles or dimensions surrounding a galactic center or a Universal center as well.
The second circle was also used for theaters, community forums, schools for job training, and buildings for making products and doing art. Structurally, this was the densest section of the village. Fear of different weather and catastrophe was nonexistent because the inhabitants of the outer circle could always find shelter in the middle circle. This constant availability of shelter encouraged the families in the outer circle to live very simply, allowing them the greatest amount of time for creativity.
Likewise the center circle of the elders was a place of meditation for all the villagers. Here, both adults and parents could come to recharge and re-attune their spirits through the elder wisdom, children spending a great deal of time there being instructed by the elders. Inhabitants of the outer circles could always seek shelter in the temples.
The wise elders were always revered and cared for. They conducted all initiations and spiritual instruction in the temples. The population was naturally stable since no young family wished to produce a child who would crowd out a beloved elder. Often after an elder went to the spirit world a new child was a rebirth of that elder. This form creates joy, creativity, pleasure, and enjoyment of service. It was the perfect Earth form for community order and efficient use of resources, and still is.
Clow says that when the surface form exists along with its female subterranean structure, the result is perfect harmony between the male and female.
The Disney Corporation’s model community in Florida, named appropriately, Celebration, is designed in a circular form for maximum efficiency of land usage, and for the greatest potential for communal interaction.
The human body is always referred to as a temple as well, and in its basic structure, energy, and mechanism, acts in very much the same way. That is why the act of walking or tracing the labyrinth structure in one form or another has always been considered a holy act, one designed to move a person toward enlightenment. Monks were often known to walk the labyrinth on the floor of Chartres Cathedral on their knees. Some form of labyrinth was used in just about every culture on Earth. Creating or purchasing a labyrinth design for personal use is still a wonderful technique for spiritual growth and the clearing of emotional, mental, or physical problems from the body.
Body work of every kind is so important for working through the emotional miasms which burden us all these days. The body carries the story of all our lives and, indeed, all of our history. We just need to free it up to release these energies and memories in a way which is controllable, and at a pace that can be handled. The body is the scene of the crime and where that memory is located. Sometimes through body manipulation memories can be released, but they also have to be honored in a way in which they are given credibility and the person helped to move through them. This is what’s called breaking up cell memory. It can’t just be done one time and then left. It’s unfair to get someone open and then leave them hanging and unreleased as many forms of treatment do.
Time especially affects emotions because we get so caught up in emotions and what we’ve got to get done. Temples can also be time machines, allowing for inter-dimensional travel, and also therefore for travel in time. The use of sacred geometry and the alignment to certain stars and planets, as we shall explore fully later, is an essential part of creating temples that are capable of doing just such things.



24
Clow, again, explores a past life helping to build the Temple at Karnak in ancient Egypt, detailing the extraordinary degree of knowledge to which one must be exposed in order to create this technology in the correct form.
“. . . As my mind travels to the temple at Karnak, I see geomancers hard at work, determining alignments to Sirius by means of cords, crystals, and plumb lines. . .This is the only way they can build the new temple in an astronomically correct way, with all its columns, obelisks, walls, altars, and sanctuaries in the proper location for maximum creation of stellar energy. Temple geomancers at Karnak . . . are going to construct the central sanctuary of Thutmosis I, who has recently incarnated from Sirius . . . The New
Kingdom realignment is of great significance because the Hyksos invaders who have controlled Egypt in recent years broke the Pharoanic star link, and it must be repaired. While the invaders ruled, the Egyptians lived in chaos and the invaders altered the sacred temple forms and rituals that had once maintained harmony . . . The stellar template for the new harmony must be implanted from Sirius under Thutmosis. . . the energy streaming into the temple is forceful and powerful.”
The Notre Dame Cathedrals and major Gothic structures in Europe utilized this same extraordinary depth of knowledge of complex temple technology. They were mainly the work of the Children of Solomon – a guild of masons instructed by the Cistercian order using the Hermetic or Divine knowledge translated by St. Bernard himself from knowledge acquired from the building of King Solomon’s Temple. King Solomon’s masons, under their own master, Hiram Abiff, were denoted by degrees of knowledge and their proficiency in this information. When the 14th century Dominican-led Inquisition against the Knights Templars was in full swing, these guilds were equally at risk. Being practitioners of the Masonic Craft, they held privileged information concerning the workings of sacred geometry and Universal Law according to their attained degrees, and their traditions are upheld, if only sometimes in symbolic form, in the modernday Masonic movement. Thus, however, one can begin to grasp the significance of the Masonic tools as symbols of various aspects of this knowledge.
Being a remnant of the Atlantean civilization, the Mayans built their temples at Tikal in Guatemala and other Mayan places using this technology. Clow says that Tikal is a key portal for fourth-dimensional Beings to enter the 3rd dimension. The Mayan Temple at Uxmal is said to open its secrets during the annual solstices, a key alignment for many sacred sites around the world.
A friend remembers his lifetime from the time of the end of Atlantis:
“. . . In Atlantis I met an Eck master who told me Atlantis was going to be destroyed. I believed him and got on a ship headed west. I landed in Central America. That’s where the Mayan Civilization was born. Unfortunately these Mayans were mostly sorcerers who practiced the Black Arts.”
Even in ancient Egypt, the template or ground plans for Atlantean-based temples looks exactly like the templates for computer chips and computer motherboards—simply another way of harnessing and utilizing energy forms.



25
The shrine or temple in which the Takeuchi Documents were supposed to be housed was a magnificent cosmic shrine named Sumioyasumeraotamashiitamaya in Toyama Prefecture. The scale of the main shrine is 218.5m wide and 200m long. It was said to be an education center covered with mysterious metal "Hihiirokane (unrusted metal forever)." In the shrine, the "Sacred mirror of (by which) world can be seen" was installed and could be seen by the whole world instantly (sounding very much like a television set). Shakyamuni, Moses, Mencius, Confucius, Lao-tse and Muhammad were all supposed to have come to this site to get the “Hihiirokane.”
As we shall also find out, not only is it how the temple is constructed, but it is also how it is decorated, and the power of the words spoken within the temple which count, for words and symbols transmit divinity as well. So do sacred teachings because the letters are infused with power, even if the text has been altered, misinterpreted, or even mistranslated, as most of the religious texts of the world have been.
It will also become clear that as we begin the new millennium, these space Beings and their ultimate master will no longer have to persuade the people to build temples in order to link them up to their own centers of control; and no longer will they require a channel to enter the Earth. Soon they will be here in person, and they look forward to once again creating fear more directly.
Survivors of Atlantis in the Pyrenees—The Basque language
More than just survivors of Atlantis, the Basque peoples who have made their home in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France and northern Spain were once a breakaway group who sort to escape the tyranny of the Sorcerer kings. To do so they decided to establish their own colony in a remote part of the Pyrenees Mountains where they would be safe from the coming destruction, as well as to have a defensible position away from the mainstream world, ruled at that time by the Atlanteans
Linguists have, for a long time, tried to trace the origins of the Basque language. Most linguists consider it to be an isolate, or language with no known relatives. Attempts have been made to show an affinity between it and certain other languages such as Iberian (an ancient language of eastern Spain), Ligurian (an ancient language of northwestern Italy), or the Caucasian languages of the Caucasus region of Georgia and Russia. No conclusive proof for these proposals exists, however. Basque was almost certainly spoken in ancient Aquitania, the region of Gascony, France, associated with the Bloodline of the Holy Grail.
Encyclopedias are quick to point out that the outstanding characteristics of the Basques are their independent spirit, love of freedom, and respect for individual liberty; a favorite Basque motto being “Neither slave nor tyrant.” These qualities are reflected in their ancient laws (called fors in France and fueros in Spain) which traditionally governed every area of their lives and were strictly adhered to. These laws were maintained by democratically elected assemblies (juntas), and great care was taken to secure honesty at the polls. It was not uncommon for a fisherman to preside over meetings in which Spanish noblemen were seated. The reflections of their early heritage are evident in these still present characteristics and ideals.
The Basques first appeared in written history late in the 1st century BC, when they successfully withstood the Roman invaders of Spain. They maintained their independence throughout the period of Roman rule of the Iberian Peninsula. In the 6th century they fought fiercely and successfully against the Visigoths. Late in the 6th century, groups of Spanish Basques migrated northward across the Pyrenees to Aquitania, which thereafter was known as Gascony.

The heyday of Atlantis was about 32,000 BC until about 9,000 BC. Unfortunately, it was also at this time, around 9000 BC with the period of the Great Flood, that we as humans lost the incorporation of our higher selves within our Beings. Due to the heaviness, the denseness of the third dimension, and the decline of Man’s spirituality on the planet, our higher selves were retained in the 4th dimension or astral plane as some would prefer to call it, as the Earth lowered itself more fully. The ‘higher self’ is that part of us which has the direct connection with the FATHER; it is our ‘oversoul’ if you will. The fact that we are split, that there is a part of us that does not reside within us right now may be difficult to accept, but it is true. As Kryon puts it, “There is a part of you, which we call the ‘higher self’ which is stored elsewhere . . . Now they are stored in the (Earth’s) grid system itself.”
To consolidate and give a more detailed picture of the dark forces and where they reside on Orion, as well as the model for Earth that Orion itself is, we would like to include here some excerpts from Ruth Norman’s History of the Universe Part 1. Many of the lessons from it are self-evident or highlighted by the addition of our italics:
“. . . The annals of your earth history have then already provided a certain skeletal outline of the nature of the gods that have dwelled amongst the peoples of the Earth These gods have been seen to have lent their names to religious systems and to the mythology of ancient races; some which have been given a particle of validity, others which have yet been considered to be but myths or the imaginings of poetical minds. Yet the strands and facts of these imaginations, so-called, are validated in that the basis of man’s strivings can be seen to have constantly been assisted by what man has considered the mythology of the gods of Greece or Egypt and Rome. Even into your present time, the continuity of life experiences so expressed in the various credible and other not so credible beliefs in the signs of the zodiac and in other manifestations of the Intelligences, are projecting their radial fingers into the life of humanity.
“. . . His (man’s) learning thus is taking place in various teaching centers and now, as the dull dross of overcast subastral forces have been removed from the minds of man, he is seeing into the finer overcoat, so to speak, and realizing the true nature of his dream states and the recognition of his constant continuity between the awake, conscious state and his dream state.
“As an aside, we know that one may take the place of the other and it may be very true and valid that your present conscious state is but a dream and your dream is more of a conscious awareness of true reality!
“History is a containment of the experiences of man and of spirit. The events therefore, that provide a glimpse into the rise and fall of your own societies on your earth world, are also a reflection and a glimpse into the events that have taken place and are the rise and fall of earth worlds, the rise and fall of galaxies, in their necessary joining with the higher and inner nature of its own energies—the Directive Forces from the greater and the higher Celestial Dimensions. In your present Earth world, you have systems of zodiacal signs which are a manifestation of mathematics which had been given to you and introduced to the earth man by those higher Spiritual Minds who had given their initial touches from time to time, and you have now given various names to the star systems that seemingly revolve around your earth planet. One of these systems as you look into the Southern skies is the Constellation of Orion and that system has provided a great deal of interest and has added a certain luster to the philosophical inquiry into the developments of your various civilizations. . . many of your societies of your world, in China, Babylonia, India, your Egypt, and stretching back of course to civilizations that have yet not been completely validated by archeological and paleontological evidence, such as Atlantis and Lemuria, and even others of the civilizations unknown to man, such as Yu, whose evidence of existence has been completely eradicated by the climactic disturbances of your planet. But it is the Constellation of Orion that has given a great deal of



27
interest to those peoples who have left you with certain aspects of this inquiry. The inquiry has indicated that there have been many influences from the worlds, the planets that lie within this constellation of hundreds of planetary star systems.
“The validity of the reality of life that is lived similar to yours in this constellation which, in your present day, cannot be verified by physical contact, resides in the memories of man. In the memories of astrological and theological, philosophical, and astronomical ways, there has been an awareness of greater meaning that provides fro the reality that man has lived in a physical anatomy such as he now possesses, on these worlds with which he has such a rapport in his dream state, and in the manners and ways which we have indicated. This is true and this is a great part of the history of man—a greater part than man has yet been aware.”
The following excerpt relates how a Being from a higher dimension originally came to Orion with advanced knowledge, much as our ‘gods’ came to earth and were worshipped, and set up many of the problems that still exist there today. This was an incarnation of Lucifer, here called Antares, spreading himself and his seed throughout the Universe, one galaxy, one star system at a time:
“. . . the world that he had decided to enter into because of his prior indication of the need of this world, was a world in the Constellation of Orion. It was a structure of a denser frequency, so that in a matter of time, if you can call it, in an instantaneous flash of micro-seconds, this one Antares took on the form of a physical person and lost the integrated wholeness of his prior consciousness and found himself in one of the physical bodies of an earth man, but an earth man who was bursting from within with grandiose schemes for resolving the problems of man and grandiose feelings which were bursting through his consciousness. This was perforation into the life of the peoples who make up a civilization; people who have their own prerogative of learning of life through their individual life experiences as they interrelate with each other in the many ways in which an organism of people so relate in the natural ways of birth through the womb and through the development of the physical species of man. Throughout his life, man learns in the various forms of family and the structures of society to form some integration for individual development whereby the individual man learns through his feedback, mentally-wise and physically-wise, of that inner structure of the self. So the social organism of a physical planet is a developmental organism which has not yet learned of the firmament which provides its stability; has not yet learned of the mechanics in which this life force can be taken in and, in a sense, digested and thereby radiated out into the society made up of the many billions of peoples that are the surface life of the planets.
“This is of course the prerogative of all of the Father, the Creative Force which has now as its progeny become the sparks of life and is held within the framework of an atomic body. Yet, this very atomic body, being the actual Father, is contained in a structure which provides for the learning experience of man. So man, left to himself, would naturally learn through trial and error and throughout the epochs and millennia of earth time, to develop the intelligence for working in a social manner; in a manner in which and way in which life does take place for individual man. But when another force is thus entwined and invades such a preliminary or elemental, or even an advanced physical society, such a force becomes not a help, but an interference, So it was, that in the worlds that make up the Constellation of Orion, the many thousands of planets and the many hundreds of solar systems, we find a force that had learned of evolution and had,
supposedly , been one of the many directive forces to provide for the administering of younger souls and to help without weakening the forces which are necessary in being strengthened by trials, errors and life experiences of the individuals who make up the soulic-supporting self.
“Antares, with great intensity and great desire and with the powers which he felt within himself and the desire to push his force into the framework of societies, became a hindrance rather than a help, in the



28
time that we are in discussing. The natural course of events, the intelligence that is being nurtured by any one individual through the ways of a natural development, would come to the fore and it would be an intelligence that had been developed, based upon a firm and firmer foundation, laid one on of the top of the other, the internal framework thereby being stabilized by a basic foundation that had been erected upon the objective awareness being a cementing, so to speak of separate life experiences over spans of lifetimes, thereby the social organism becomes that much greater in its strength and in its ability to become a finer tuning fork for the intelligence residing on the higher octave of the Infinite; that is, another frequency band in which other peoples are living and experiencing the infinite panoply of the Father, thereby radiating in some way, directively, their understandings to the peoples in a lower echelon of worlds.”
“ . . . Thereby lies the story of the beginning of a dark star that became the seed for retrogression in the natural development of the souls who were beginning their trek and who had already reached a certain point in their evolution where they had a certain basic understanding of the concepts of the structure of energy which could be ratified and put into productive use as the means to reduce man’s need to be as the animal. But yet we must backtrack and look more deeply into the life of the Aryan people and to see how it is that, having as their jurisprudence and their responsibility in guidance, to see that lives lived in the lower worlds would not come to drift with some current of thought that was deleterious or based in an opposite direction to progressive development, that the very ones who have been so ordained to be involved in this directional and purposeful surveillance, have themselves, the need to be, at all times, impassionately objective and to not be concerned in a personal manner with the nature and course of events which they see in the larger picture. “
Norman also details some of the methods and institutions of control on Orion, sounding very much like what is going on and currently in the works for planet Earth:
“. . .The scan of this individual took into consideration the entire history of that person, the entire history of his organism; that is, a physical analysis, a complete breakdown of every thought that had been recorded on the electronic tape and all of this information and all of this information thus brought together, was reviewed by the person in question, who would be your doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist. This man would review this information and in his particular expertise and within the framework of his responsibility, would make a decision whether to return the individual to his previous position in a manufacturing department or in a department whereby he would work for the pleasures of the Orionites in their times away from their work department.
“This interior view of the electronic network of controls, so instrumented that they had a placement in the lives of the people in every way in which people live, was reformed into the teaching machines or the
educational systems of the Orion planets (school by television—the electronic classroom already becoming widely implemented here on earth). It was a part of every institution that was the organism for the society of Orion. These instruments thus were teaching machines in their own right, but the teaching was a program so consistently designed that the program maintained a complete contact with the individual arteries of the people. This can be seen, therefore, to have been a development that took place over many thousands of years to thus staff the people to design, build and install these ingenious instruments in the hundreds of millions, and many more homes strewn throughout the mean worlds. So now at this time in our discussion of our history of this galaxy we are showing the development of the constellation that has been known as Orion.
“Over countless lifetimes and through adaptation, built with a constant continuity from one generation to the next, there had been an acceleration of the science of energy as utilized in the means of record information, and in this sense we could say that Orion was again recorder of events; events that span



29
generations of civilizations but yet had a thread that kept a continuity. This thread was not in the nature of the social system per se, but was in the nature of the giant memory disc that contained the events of past civilizations. Thus this giant memory disc, the computer memory bank of the Orion civilizations was the mother and father in the memories of the people (what some of our computer companies are becoming) although they themselves had not had disclosed to them by their leaders who formed their government in the various ages of the principle of life in which they would return from one life to the next and reengage in the same life they had left after their physical death. The events that had been so accumulated, indicated this continuity from one society to the next and it was a preclusion to those who had the opportunity to examine the evidence of past histories of Orion, that there was an organization that proved this continuity, but this information was not allowed to be disclosed to the people as a whole as evidence of their educational lives.
“. . . Artemus, realizing the import of this blue flash of light, immediately switches off certain instruments so there will not be a relaying of the information that he will hear by the word structure, that those who maintained their listening devices would not be able to record nor will any of his instrumentation receive the nature of this message that is coming from the inner council, and for the ears of Artemus alone. Yet, this information is thusly recorded on a different frequency which mandates the lives of the people in the other many thousands of control rooms.
“. . .Hence, we are indicating to you that the nature of the extent to which life was so mandated for the people was an organization of incredible detail, beginning with the actual birth of an infant and where all detailed signs of the future of that embryonic soul would be projected to a future use to which it could be utilized in the life of a complicated society. . . . . there were specially developed institutions which were responsible for the maintaining and the reprocessing of these flaws that would be detected and which flaws could easily cause a rippling effect to course through and to break down the well regulated harmony of interconnected, institutional life (what the prisons here are being built to do, they just now are filled with individuals who are victims of some social disease who will soon be freed to allow their usage for the intellectual rebels. Orwell’s 1984 was just a remembrance of life on Orion transported to a world here on Earth.)
“This was the prison system, a system whereby the individuals who were the unregulated ones, were separated from the natural life of the people and placed in a certain part of the planet and/or to another planet so developed for this purpose, a colony of dissidents and a colony extending into many, many hundreds of thousands of peoples who thus could not be processed to become a viable, healthy part of the tissue of the highly technical organism of Orion society, for reasons of intelligence and for reasons of physical disruptions in the bodies of these people. They could not be rectified in the educational techniques so providing for the constant reformation of the individual. This is a colony that that forms another segment and a purpose for the lives of the people, and these people having been so separated from the mainstream of life because of their own lack of adequate concern for their future, were used for the purposes of developing newer understandings in the strains and the racial superiority of Orion. Thus, there was no loss in the entire organism of life, according to the self-satisfaction of the governmental agency, in that they did not consider it a failure that these hundreds of thousands of people were indicated as a weak facet of their department.
“ . . . Life on Orion is not necessarily similar in all respects to the life being so indicated on the central planet of Tyron. It is in this central planet that the great hub of activity activates the entire system of the Orion planets, which is a discipline of great artificial life, and this is the life that has been partially examined



30
as being the internal organism of all forms of activity within the framework of electronic instrumentation, to implement the constant deployment and development of all facets of an intricately designed society.
“In the development of events so being disclosed, of the history of people and the history of the greater understanding of the life purpose of the individual and the entire organization of people into the purposeful and well-organized wholes can be seen to be the purpose of the arrival of the Pleiadeans and to be the next step in the incision into the disease which had been running amuck and had already curtailed the inner and revitalized regeneration of the Infinite Father into the lives of the people in this degenerate form of civilization.
“. . . We have indicated to you in the highways and the byways of the civilization of Orion, to some extent, the revealing abscess which was treating man as an instrument of his own projection and that man has been shown to be less than the animal, yet so artificially developed that he was capable of manning the complicated machinery of computer modules that contained the vast network of information of life. We have taken you, to some extent, to the portion of the Planet of Tyrantus to indicate to you that there were colonies that indicated the less than perfect society that was so highly touted by Tyrantus (tyrant) and his fellow associates. And we will indicate to you in greater detail that these clefts in a society were the cracks that had already developed and had been a running sore for many, many of the epochs of time, even in the period which we are discussing.
“Your parentage then is the nature and the function of the development of the advanced technological systems that had encroached upon the base spiritual mentality of the individual and man. His present consciousness is thus the reflection of these institutional developments whereby he gives lips service to his own indwelling self and provides the greater service to the vast machinery that had been a developmental relationship from those who were the first initiators, at least in this part of your galaxy—to the extent that they had imposed the developed consciousness they had, comparatively speaking, upon those who became their charges. They had insulted, as we have indicated to you, the intelligence that could be gained by any one of the life forms of the Infinite Creative Intelligence.
“It is quite readily apparent in your present 20th century and the close of what has been stated and restated during the past several thousands of your earth years as the end of the millennium and the beginning of a new cycle for man, when the Father would become more visible in the consciousness of mankind, and the trident would become, therefore, a greater interpolation and interaction in the life of man, this trident being that integration of what has been misrepresented as the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, carrying down these misinterpretations from Orion as to the nature of life. But the true Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are those principles which are active ingredients in the life of each individual who provides with the purposeful development of these ingredients to collate them and relate the principles of the past, present and future in the vehicle of the present dimension (or frequency) in which man begins to strengthen this understanding of the energy.
“The Father, as we have so labored upon and restated, is the Great Infinite Intelligence (Here they are referring to the Sugmad) and that which is the parent source of all life. The Son is your psychic anatomy, the re-creational fabric of information that had been so developed in every life experience in the two dimensions in which life has gained its properties of understanding in the astral and in the terrestrial dimensions. The Holy Ghost is that precipitated vehicle which is the reflection of all these transposed life experiences contained in the energy of the physical anatomy and so projected that it provides the individual the opportunity to objectify in his present life through the mirror that reflects the past experiences that have been lived so arduously and lengthily for him. This is the greatest understanding and is the purpose and
mandate of all individuals to thus recreate (RE-CREATION–not recreation –not leisure, but the rebuilding of



31
Spirit inside us by communing with planet Earth), through the individualized quotient of this life force that permeates into all dimensions of the Father.
“This basic understanding, a principle that is scientific in the highest degree of understanding science, can be and would have been a means of gaining for all man, and had he learned and utilized this understanding of the consciousness that is the pervading force of all life, that now makes its presence within each microcosm of the Father -- a higher awareness into an area that would have gained that individual the strength whereby he could have projected, in his understanding, additional properties to those in levels of consciousness that had not yet been gained. So your present lifetime is then a fabrication that reveals in its separateness the misrepresentation that had been brought down to the one-million-year time in which we are presenting this great history of the universe in which you are the recipient of, and have been the living components.
“A supposed difference of opinion that has been a noticeable discord in the societies of man, has been the reactions between the institutions of physical science, which includes all departments and the institutions of the religious factions which are superimposed within the framework of their institutional form of life, certain concepts having to do with the mystique and the lack of true understanding of the continuity of the intelligence that is the consciousness and is the developmental feature of man., In so doing, they have in these religious factions, presented the nature of life as a complete antithesis of progressive evolution. They have developed the awareness of an astral world, which in its lowest divisions, provides for a medley of rewards or punishments which could be meted out to an individual if he did not agree with the tenets of these individuals who have so set themselves into levels of superior understanding that they have become the spiritual mandates for man, and misrepresent to man the spirit which is perceived by the individual in his longing to be joined with this inner awareness that he feels in times of great stress and at other times, in the peace and accord that can allow him to touch the invisible force.
“Science, on the other hand, has been greatly concerned with the knowledge and function of that agent of the Infinite Intelligence that has recreated itself into lower dimensions as the atomic form which provides for the necessities of life for man. He has mandated this understanding in his limited vision and has recreated a vast system, an institution that provides access to the understanding of the physics of the energy form of the atom. Thus is fabricated in the life of man, another distinct aspect of the Infinite but limited within the horizons of the subatomic particles which present the camouflage and the appearance of life in the physical worlds; worlds which are called physical because the possessors of these senses agree to the containment of the pictures afforded from such senses; they therefore haven’t been able to see beyond the apparentness of a solid form. In the understanding of their energy force, they have thus recreated this force in the seeming objects of the world and have not transposed this understanding within the energy that recreates the very substance of the physical anatomy and provides for the mentality that must be used, even in the most primitive of the lives of an aborigine.”
“. . . So the scientific institutions of life which are gaining for man at this present time, a repetition of history, in the advances being made in the development of scientific apparatuses to increase the horizons and the perspectives of the physical mind within the properties of the atomic world, is again appearing in the 20th century. The force that had been the result of the Orion institutional forms of life are, in every way, showing themselves and are readapting themselves again within the lives of the people on another one of the worlds of Orion and the abscess that had developed one million years ago was the overdevelopment of the understanding of atomic elements and is resulting in the strengthening of this virus. At the same time, the lack of true understanding that had been given from time to time in the epochs of the history of your civilizations and not integrated in the greater totality o institutional life forms, is finding its disproportion and



32
malignancy again within those institutions that attempt to explain the so-called nature of Spirit. Yet in both horizons of the societies of man in the physical worlds in which he lives, they are disproportionate and misunderstood.
“. . . Orion, therefore, exists not only in the mentality of the individual as he sees life through his physical sense structures but in lives as an invisible precinct of consciousness that became a reality to all people who had received the impetus of life experiences when they were living in non-physical bodies in the 4th dimension. So the strength gained in this subversive distortion of the true principle and reality of the nature or evolution was adapted and strengthened in the 4th or adjoining dimensions. Man lives as a reflection of the experiences gained when he adapted this consciousness and was able to learn, through objective experiences in another perspective, the nature of his own psychic self. There may be many of those who are now treading in the pathway of truth who have been abused in their past, having themselves been people who have lived in Orion, but who, having more strengthened awarenesses and more positively developed life experiences in previous experiences in their evolution and who can now see into and through the miasma, the camouflage that has been erected by the distorted life forms that presently make for a supposed reality of life. These individuals, having themselves played certain parts in previous civilizations in Orion and who have been travelers on the pathway of truth, will recognize within their own structures the distinguishing features of these principles that are being made apparent. These people themselves, having learned of the continuity principles of life and having known of the dimensions win which man lives, and been aware of the malignant thoughts that have been entertained in his mind, can thus see the nature of his own difficulties and can realize in this deeper fashion that he, at one time, was a helper in the progressive development of life of mankind. That individual then knows that he did not gain the necessary strength and the integration of previous knowledge of life as he found himself giving a greater degree of interest to the facsimile of life where the senses reared themselves and blocked out the fresher landscape of the sublime attunement with the higher intelligence of which he, at one time, was the possessor.
“. . . Orion was the parent, the father of material life forms, which are presently being relived by all peoples in exaggerated forms. The development within which these tyrannical methods were conceived and made a reality for those who lived in and throughout the planets of the Orion Empire, was a life that was restricted and the highly specialized nature in which the people lived, required each individual to conform to a set of conditions which knew of no failures. The conditions thereby, in which the people lived, were harshly enforced as a code of conduct, and failure to conform, by the inability to complete the quotient of work that had been allotted to any individual in whatever expertise, would require punitive action. The system of reward and punishment was rigidly enforced so that the greatest effort could be gained from the energies of the individual citizen of the Empire of Orion. These rewards provided for a development in the society of Orion that vastly accelerated the enjoyment of the physical sense structures. These rewards necessarily improved upon and gave a greater degree of reality to such individuals who had gained the approbation of their superiors whereby they could indulge themselves in certain life expressions that would enrich their feelings of security. The punishment to those who did not exert their utmost in the work allotted to them, would also in an opposite way, deprive the individual, from the sense of stimulus that would gain for that individual a certain degree of security and a feeling of being alive in a more physical way.
“. . . The reward systems were developed whereby the sense of touch and the sense of hearing and the senses of propagation of life were exaggerated. Since it was at all times an understanding that the highest and most developed stimulus in the life of a physical man was the continuity of the species through the sexual senses, this reward system gained the greatest popularity and became the most influential means by which people could be kept within the lower consciousness. The desire to reap the benefits of these rewards



33
through a continual desire for experience now was the greater, enforced means of keeping people in a languid and unintelligent mental framework! “
Chapter 12 THE ANNUNAKI BRANCH GROWS
"Allah created the sexes, the male and the female, from a drop of ejected semen....He who is the Lord of Sirius
-----Sura 53, The Koran
Zecharia Sitchin’s work in The Earth Chronicles poses a number of different problems. Firstly, for those who already now it, the information obviously has a lot to do with our subject. The difficulty is that it also suffers from the ‘blame-it-all-on-one-group-of-aliens’ syndrome that is a purposeful cover-up to the true details of life here on Earth. This is common among specialists, but here it is a matter of the opposition getting their oar in the water first so as to confuse people on what the true reality is. In this case, there is an obvious failure to be aware of, or take into account, the large number of other races also involved with the Earth’s history, both today as well as in the past.
To give an example of how some of these difficulties arise, imagine if you would that you were asked to write down your own history. You would be tempted to glorify your own origins, your own achievements, and also the extent of the impact you have had on the entire world around you. There would also be certain portions of your life you would be tempted to totally leave out, whitewashing the blank areas, or simply glossing over them. If you were a good public relations person, you would also lie to head off any adverse publicity you might receive further on down the road.
The history of those called the Annunaki in the Sumerian texts does just this same kind of thing. Their history was recorded by scribes they trained and manipulated, and is a source of potential fallibility. The various translations of those said texts are also subject to many and varied interpretations, both mistakenly as well as on purpose.
The Annunaki’s history, and what follows from it, certainly fails to take into account the influence of the One we have talked about already who is the supreme director behind many of these aliens’ actions. Neither does it take into account what has heretofore been unknown, that is the personal participation of this central character in an extremely physical way with the history of the planet. It is difficult for those not in possession of certain facts to fully explain the events as they happened. Much of what has been written, then, is simply incorrect.
The history of the Annunaki does not also take into account the fact that this race of reptilian/human hybrids are also the lackeys of the grander and darker races of both Sirius and Orion from whom they once sprang. The jealousy, the often fatal attempts to supplant their own Masters, reminds one very much of the Klingons of Star Trek fame, the pirates and convicts of the galaxy, making do with whatever they can to enhance their own sense of self



34
esteem and value. In truth, they are little more than the archetypal galactic drug pushers and pirates.
Sitchin’s work, while groundbreaking in its openness and the bringing forward of this very controversial issue, is suspect at best. His research and cross-referencing makes for wonderfully adventurous reading. It is an indication of the expansion of consciousness of the population that it has been so popularly received. Without question it has also given many people a marvelous chance to open their minds to new possibilities about the role ‘aliens’ have played in both our history and in our religions. This is important. When similar, but more narrowly focused ideas were suggested by Dr. Agrest, doctor of physical-mathematics, in an article in the Moscow Literary Gazette of February 1960, it may have stimulated interest among some scientists, but never had the startling effect on the population the way that Zecharia Sitchin’s work has.
Even though the material has been available for the past two decades, we feel it is still necessary to give a brief introduction to Sumeria and Mesopotamia, as well as some basic background information on Sitchin’s premise. We will also endeavor to put events in some context of what else was happening on the planet around that same time.
Introduction
Sumer was an ancient country of western Asia, corresponding to the ancient Mesopotamia and Babylonia of biblical times. It was situated in what is today the southern part of Iraq. The history books speak of Sumer as dating back to the 5th millennium BC when the Ubaidians established settlements in the area. Several centuries later, as the Ubaidian settlers prospered, Semites from the Syrian and Arabian deserts began to infiltrate, both as peaceful immigrants and as raiders in quest of booty. After about 3250 BC, another people migrated from its homeland, located probably northeast of Mesopotamia (from the colony we have known as Aksu at that 3200 BC mark in time), and began to intermarry with the native population. The newcomers, who became known as Sumerians, spoke an agglutinative language unrelated apparently to any other known language (from the star seeding of language through genetics to Aksu).
The name of rulers that preceded Sargon of Akkad in the region did not make sense at all in terms of having a meaning: The king at whose court Sargon was a counselor was called Urzabab; the king who reigned in Erech was named Lugalzagesi; and so on. Scholars therefore took another look at the Akkadian inscriptions. Basically, the Akkadian cuneiform script was syllabic: Each sign stood for a complete syllable (Ab, ba, bat, etc.) Yet the script made extensive use of signs that were not phonetic syllables but conveyed the meanings “god,” city,” country,” or “life,” “exalted” and the like. The only possible explanation for this phenomenon was that these signs were remains of an earlier writing method which used pictographs. Akkadian then, must have been preceded by another language that used a writing method akin to the Egyptian hieroglyphs.
The claim by Ashurbanipal that he could read intricate tablets in “Shumerian” and understand the words written on tablets from the “days before the Flood” only increased the mystery. But in January, 1869 Jules Oppert suggested to the French Society of Numismatics and Archaeology that recognition be given to the existence of a pre-Akkadian language and people. Pointing out that the early rulers of Mesopotamia proclaimed their legitimacy by taking the title “King of Sumer and Akkad,” he suggested that the people be called “Sumerians,” and their land “Sumer” (Shinar was the Biblical name for Shumer).



35
In the centuries that followed the immigration of the Sumerians, the country grew rich and powerful. Art and architecture, crafts, religious and ethical thought flourished. The Sumerian language became the prevailing speech of the land, and the people developed the cuneiform script, a system of writing on clay. This script was to become the basic means of written communication throughout the Middle East for about 2000 years.
Agga, the last ruler of the Etana Dynasty in Sumer, was defeated by Mesanepada, king of Ur in about 2670 BC. Mesanepada then founded the so-called 1st Dynasty of Ur and made Ur the capital of Sumer. Soon after his death, the city of Erech achieved a position of political prominence under the leadership of Gilgamesh (about 2700-2650 BC), some of whose deeds are chronicled in the story we have already mentioned, The Epic of Gilgamesh.
By the 23rd century BC, the power of the Sumerians had declined to such an extent that they could no longer defend themselves against foreign invasion. The Semitic ruler Sargon the Great, who reigned about 2335-2279 BC, succeeded in conquering the entire country. Sargon founded a new capital, called Agade, in the far north of Sumer and made it the richest and most powerful city in the world at that time. The people of northern Sumer and the conquering invaders, fusing gradually, became known ethnically and linguistically as Akkadians. The land of Sumer acquired the composite name Sumer and Akkad.
Sitchin describes Sumer as “the first known civilization, appearing suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere some 6,000 years ago. It is credited with virtually all the ‘firsts’ of high civilization: inventions and innovations, concepts and beliefs, which form the foundation of our own Western culture, and indeed of all other civilizations and cultures throughout the Earth. The wheel and animaldrawn vehicles, boats for rivers and ships for seas, the kiln and the brick, high-rise buildings, writings and schools and scribes, laws and judges and juries, kingship and citizens’ councils, music and dance and art, medicine and chemistry, weaving and textiles, religion and priesthoods and temples. And above all, knowledge of mathematics and astronomy began there.”
After cataloguing some of the great technological achievements of ancient Lemuria and Atlantis, and knowing that the Atlanteans were responsible for setting up many of their colonies around the world, including those close to ancient Mesopotamia in Egypt, one can begin to understand the arrogance of this statement.
Sumer (actually Shumer) was called—“land of the Guardians.” The term Nefilim (alias the Annunaki) was also rendered as “Guardians” or sometimes as ‘Watchers.” In ancient Egypt, the term for “gods, divine” was Neteru, also translated as “Guardians.” The hieroglyph for this term was an axe. E.A. Wallis Budge in a special chapter in his work The Gods of the Egyptians titled “The Axe As A Symbol of God,” concluded that the axe was made of metal, and that the symbol was probably borrowed from the Sumerians.
Background
Since the early work of Erich Von Daniken and his Chariot of the Gods in the 1960s, it has been fashionable to search through ancient myths and legends to find instances of what could openly be interpreted as aliens or space-gods visiting Earth and interacting with mankind. Some of these legends are reported to stem from before the Great Flood, about 9,000 BC, as we now already know. It is these legends that are often used by Sitchin in his work to explain the supposed spread of Annunaki influence around the world.



36
One of the cycles of legends used by Sitchin in his work is that of the Nahuatl tribes of central Mexico, of whom the Aztecs encountered by the Spaniards were the last extant. Their tales of migration encompassed four ages, or “Suns,” the first one of which ended with the deluge. One version which provides the lengths in years for those ages indicates that the first “Sun” began 17,141 years before the tale was related to the Spaniards, i.e. circa 15,600 BC, and thus indeed millennia before the Deluge. The use of the sun to measure ages suggests that these were most likely remnants of the last Lemurian people fleeing the spreading Dark forces of Atlantis almost 6,000 years prior to its final breakup.
Further south along the Pacific coast of South America, Andean ‘myths’ did not recall preDiluvian migrations. They knew of the Deluge and asserted that the gods, already present in those lands, were the ones to help the few survivors upon the high peaks to repopulate the continent. This is an important point, for verily it is the same thing as happened with Lemuria and the islands of the Pacific where the few who survived began civilization again. Similarly, the Canary Islands and the Azores are the mountain peaks of the once great Atlantis.
The Andean legends used by Sitchin do speak clearly, however, of new, post-Diluvial arrivals by sea. The most memorable of these was one headed by a leader called Naymlap who led his people across the Pacific in a fleet of boats made of balsa wood, guided by an “idol,” a green stone through which the Great God delivered navigational and other instructions. Their landfall was at the most westward point of the South American continent, nowadays called Cape Santa Helena in Ecuador. After they landed, the Great God (still speaking through the green stone) instructed the people in farming, building, and handicrafts.
An ancient relic made of pure gold, now kept in the Gold Museum of Bogota, Colombia, depicts a tall leader with his entourage atop a balsa wood raft. The artwork may well have represented the sea crossing by Naymlap or his like. These people were well acquainted with the calendar and worshiped a pantheon of twelve gods according to the Naymlap legend. Moving inland to settle where Ecuador’s capital, Quito, is now situated, they built there two temples facing each other: one dedicated to the Sun, the other to the Moon, much as was done at Teotihuacan in Mexico. The Temple of the Sun had in front of its gateway two stone columns and in its forecourt a circle of twelve stone pillars.
Because these two myths speak of people who were aware of the calendar cycles or the division of the sky into the twelve sections of the Zodiac, or because they had a pantheon of twelve gods and two pillars in front of their temple, indicates to Sitchin that they had some kind of contact with ancient Mesopotamia and therefore ancient Sumer. Unfortunately it is hard to extrapolate balsa wood boats into aliens from the heavens. From the Nine’s channelings it is more likely—even coming from the West—that these were members of one of the Lost Tribes of Israel, or remnants of some other colony of Atlantis. And from what we know of temple technology, the similarities are ubiquitous (world-wide).
Sitchin also uses the same location already mentioned by Brother Philip to support his claims of Sumerian interaction in South America. Unfortunately, we already know this area to be one settled by some of the survivors of Lemuria. Sitchin’s claim is that south of where Lima, the capital of Peru, is situated, along the coast and mountains that face Lake Titicaca, and on southward toward Chile, the dominant tribal language was that of Aymaras. They too recalled in their legends early arrivals on the Pacific Coast by sea and by land from the territory east of Lake Titicaca. The Aymara considered the former as unfriendly invaders; the latter were called Uru, meaning “olden people” similar to



37
Anasazi which can also be interpreted as ‘ancient Ones’. Those remnants still exist in the Sacred Valley as a group with its own customs and traditions. The possibility that they were Sumerians, arriving at Lake Titicaca when Ur was Sumer’s capital (the last time between 2200 and 2000 BC), must be taken seriously, according to Sitchin.
The fact that the province that connects the Sacred Valley, the eastern shores of Lake Titicaca, and western Brazil is still called Madre del Dios—“mother of the gods” indicates to Sitchin that this area was named after the Nibiruan ‘mother of the gods’, Ninsirhag. The fact that both the Lemurians and Atlanteans had a female representation in their religion of the Mother of the Gods, however, makes either one of these races just as plausible.
Sitchin’s own explanations of the Piri Re’is map suggest that there were a number of peoples who could have been traveling the world as early as the 3rd millennium BC. The Piri Re’is map dates back to AD 1513, and shows all of South America, including its Patagonian tip, parts of which were still unknown at the time, as well as Antarctica, unknown by the civilized world until around AD 1820.
If the Hebrews could get to North America, as suggested by the Book of Mormon and as supported by the Nine, then travel in those days was not as limited as some historians might tend to think. Indeed, there are a number of carvings in stone throughout South America that portray very Semitic-looking men with long flowing beards.
As a sidebar here, it is important to understand the great portent the Piri Re’is map has on the suggestion that much of history has been ‘staged.’
“. . . He (Piri Re’is) also repeated the tale of how Columbus first tried to convince the grandees of Genoa and then the king of Spain that according to a book that he (Columbus) possessed, “at the end of the Western sea (the Atlantic), that is on its western side, there were coasts and islands and all kinds of metals and also precious stones.”
The details contained in the Turkish admiral’s book confirm that Columbus knew quite well in advance where he was going. Columbus as a member of the Rosicrucians, a student of Dante Alighieri, and having been sponsored by Leonardo Da Vinci, was in the right circle of friends to be in the possession of very detailed maps and geographic data from very ancient sources.
If Columbus knew where he was going because many others had gone before, why is it that we so celebrate his achievements and think of him as the discoverer of North America? The answer lies in a later chapter.
The existence of such early maps is attested to by Piri Re’is. In a subsequent notation which explains how the map was drawn he listed as sources maps made by Arab cartographers, the Portuguese, the “map of Columbus,” as well as “about twenty charts and Mappae Mundi” (charts drawn in the days of “Alexander, Lord of the Two Horns”—an Arabic epithet for Alexander The Great). This statement alone suggests that Piri Re’is saw and used maps from as early as the fourth century BC, maps that were once kept in the Library of Alexandria and survived the destruction by fire in AD 642.
It is now believed that the suggestion to sail westward on the Atlantic to reach existing coasts was first made not by Columbus but by an astronomer, mathematician, and geographer from Florence, Italy, named Paulo del Pozzo Toscanelli in 1474. It is also recognized that maps such as the Medicean from 1351 and that of Pizingi of 1367, were available to later mariners and cartographers, the most renowned of whom being Mercator whose Atlas of 1569 and methods of



38
projection are still standard features of cartography to this day. Oddly enough, Mercator’s maps of the world also show an Antarctica with geographical and topographical features such as coasts, bays, inlets, estuaries and mountains, even rivers, where none can now be seen because of the ice cap that hides them, features that have been buried under an ice sheet for thousands of years!
It is clear to Sitchin that these early sailors had an instrument of navigation for accurately determining longitudes that was far superior to anything possessed by the peoples of ancient, medieval, or even modern times until the second half of the 18th century. Just such a mechanism was discovered in the sea off Antikythera Island by sponge divers in 1900. It was part of the cargo of a shipwreck which occurred in the first century BC. The mechanism is considered to be a calendrical Sun and Moon computing machine, dated after the latest evidence to circa 80 BC.
In it, the gears were linked one to the other on a basis of several differentials—a sophistication which we now find in automatic gearshift boxes in cars. It incorporated the cycle of the Sun and the Metonic (nineteen-year) cycle of the Moon. The gears were fitted with tiny teeth and moved on varied axles. Markings on circular and angular parts were accompanied by inscriptions in Greek that named a number of zodiacal constellations. Professor Derek de Sola Price of Yale University, author of a study on the subject, said that he could not agree that the complexity of the device and its mechanical sophistication put it so far beyond the scope of Hellenistic technology that it could only have been designed and created by “alien astronauts coming from outer space and visiting out civilization.”
The Greek civilization was a by-product of that of Atlantis, rooted in the technology of the Alteans and many other ‘alien’ races. In fact, the technology of Atlantis far outdistanced our own considerable achievements in technology, and was more advanced than even that of the Annunaki. However, this is not the point. It is a simple truth that many alien races brought their technology to the planet for one reason or another. That not much of anything remains from the time before the Flood, does not exclude the Atlanteans from being a more genuine claimant to the title of ‘originator of modern civilization’ than the Annunaki, as supported by both the Nine and Edgar Cayce, although they must get some of the credit it is true.
The Annunaki
The story of the Annunaki, the Nephilim of the Bible, is clearly told in The Book of the Watchers, a collection of visionary stories set, in turn, into a larger collection called the First Book of Enoch. The story tells how the “watcher” angel, whom God appointed to supervise (“watch over”) the universe, fell from heaven. Starting from the story of Genesis 6, in which the “sons of God” lusted for human women, the author combines two different accounts of how the watchers lost their heavenly glory. The first describes how Semihazah, leader of the watchers, coerced two hundred other angels to join him in a pact to violate divine order by mating with human women. These mismatcheds produced “a race of bastards, the giants known as nephilim (fallen ones”) from whom there were to proceed demonic spirits,” who brought violence upon the earth and devoured its people.
Interwoven with this story is an alternative version which tells how the archangel Azazel sinned by disclosing to human beings the secrets of metallurgy, a pernicious revelation that inspired men to make weapons and women to adorn themselves with gold and silver. Thus the fallen angels and their demon offspring incited in both sexes violence, greed, and lust.
George Nickelsberg points out that from the time of Alexander the Great, Greek kings have claimed to be descended from a mating of the gods with human women; the Greeks called such



39
hybrid beings ‘heroes’. Their Jewish subjects, however, with their derisive tale of Semihazah, may have turned such claims of divine descent against the foreign usurpers of their soil. The Book of Watchers says pointedly that these greedy monsters “consume the produce of all the people until the people hated feeding them”; the monsters then turned directly to “devour the people.”
In all the histories of Lemuria and Atlantis, even those discussed of Sirius and Orion and other such planets, there is never one single reference to any form of cannibalism—until we come to talk about the Nephilim and the race known as the Annunaki. Even though many other races and the root races from which the Annunaki seemed to come were ‘reptilian’, none are known to ‘eat the flesh’ of other races of Beings.
It becomes clearly obvious why then, although Enoch is used as an example of righteousness and was considered one of the main prophets of Biblical times, and the Book of Enoch is considered to be very reliable source, it has never been accepted as a part of the Christian Bible, being relegated instead to the Gnostic Scriptures.
It is to these “greedy monsters” in the Book of Enoch that Sitchin relates the various foundations of civilization throughout the world:
“The legends of the ascent heavenward of the Creator and his two sons, the Moon and the Sun, from the sacred rock on the Island of the Sun (Titicaca Island) may well be recollections of the departure of Anu, his son Sin and his grandson Shamash: having made a short trip by boat from Puma-Punku to a waiting airborne craft of the Annunaki.”
This story is reminiscent, and perhaps archetypal, of the ascent by Muhammad the Prophet from the rock of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on his white steed called “Lightning.” As with Enoch and other such ‘divine prophets,’ being lifted off by spacecraft is perhaps the ordained method of ascension.
Along with the Pharaohs of Egypt, fathered by the gods from Atlantis and not Sumer, even the legend of Quetzalcoatl, i.e. the Winged Serpent, gets related by Sitchin to the Annunaki, Quetzalcoatl being in Sitchin’s eyes the equivalent of Anu, ruler of the Annunaki planet of Nibiru.
“Why then not accept our suggestion that the arrival of Quetzalcoatl in his new realm was the occasion for starting the Long Count of the Mesoamerican calendar—especially since it was this very god who had introduced the calendar to these lands?” he asks.
One falsity builds upon another, much as any good science fiction or fantasy writer can build an entire world and people it with various races and creatures, all speaking their own language and having their own separate traditions. All one needs to do to accept these fantasies is to accept the first original premise or premises.
The Zodiac that originated almost 100,000 years ago in Lemuria with the Earth religion that was the forerunner of the Sons of the Law of One, is credited by Sitchin to Sumer. On the symbols to be found on the oval dolmen called ‘the Pedra Pintada,’ located in the Amazon Basin near the BrazilGuyana border, Sitchin says that such symbols as that of the two fishes (for Pisces), the two human images (the twins of Gemini) and the female holding a stalk of grain (Virgo, the virgin) are identical to the zodiacal symbols (and their names) that originated in Sumer and were adopted throughout the Old World. That not all the symbols of the zodiac are identical to those that originated in Sumer is not unusual, says Sitchin, since in various lands (such as China) the zodiac (which means “animal circle”) was adapted to local fauna.



40
“. . . no less astounding than the decorative symbols and the zodiacal signs around the oval dolmen’s face is the depiction in the center of the pentagonal dolmen. It shows a circle of stones
surrounding two monoliths, between which there appears a partly erased drawing of a human head whose eye is focused on one of the monoliths.”
Such a “head with sighting eye” can be found in Mayan astronomical codices in which the sign depicts astronomer-priests, according to Sitchin. As we have also already learned, however, the Mayans were a remnant of the Atlantean colonizing effort, one which became isolated after the Flood. The symbolism of the pentagonal dolmen is also very Masonic, suggesting more that its origins were Atlantean than anything from Sumer.
We do not mean to cast doubts on all of Sitchin’s work, for indeed there is some truth in what he has written and in its overall intent. We do not disagree that the ancient gods the Sumerians texts speak of, the Annunaki, did in fact exist and did indeed have a long and incestuous relationship with mankind as we shall so soon find out. It is also not disputed that almost half a million years ago they could travel in space, and were coming and going between their ‘planet’ and Earth every 3,600 years, or thereabouts. That the Annunaki assigned to the African mines mutinied and that the Annunaki therefore used genetic manipulation and in-vitro fertilization techniques to create “primitive workers,” the first Homo sapiens, to take over the backbreaking toil in the gold mines, is also essentially correct.
That the Annunaki’s reason for deciding to give to NAM.LU.GAL.LU –“civilized mankind”– the knowledge of tools, not for the sake of Mankind, but “for the sake of the Gods,” to assure their satiation is also essentially correct and needs stressing. These are basic truths which we both then agree upon.
To try and credit the Annunaki with every visit by a member of a visiting alien race to any of the continents, however, is going a little too far. Worse still, to trace the whole of human history over the past 500,000 years back to the Annunaki and their presence on the planet, as Sitchin seems want to do, is an attempt to nullify the history we have already covered in this book, and to expunge from the record all the multitude of other planets, races, and Beings, who have also interacted with Earth during that period of time. It just isn’t true.
Sitchin’s original book, The 12th Planet, relates how the Sumerian texts repeatedly and persistently state that it is from the planet Nibiru that the Annunaki came to Earth—the term Annunaki literally meaning “Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came.” These are the beings spoken of in the Bible as ‘the Anakim,’ and in Chapter 6 of Genesis are also called ‘Nefilim,’ which literally means “The Watchers.”
Sitchin’s interpretation of the material on the Sumerian texts says that this planet of Nibiru is actually a member of our Solar System. It is, according to his interpretation, a planet that has such a large and divergent orbit that it takes 3,600 years to orbit the sun and therefore sends it far out past Pluto on its long journey. Much of the arrangement of the planets, such as Uranus’s position being laid on its side and the odd inclined orbit of Pluto, he attributes to the passage of Nibiru on its journey through this area of the solar system. It also seems to be his intent to blame all of the many cataclysms that have occurred on Earth, including the Great Flood, to this strange orbit of Nibiru.
There are indeed some exciting ideas produced from the material with which Sitchin is presented, and his translation of the material may in fact be correct, however—there is no ‘planet’ Nibiru such as Sitchin and the Sumerian texts describe.



41
The story of the Annunaki and their arrival is told, in part, by the ‘Enuma elish’ –known as the Epic of Creation (seven tablets of Creation), with other subsequent Sumerian texts detailing their stay here on Earth.
The Enuma elish tells how a group of fifty Annunaki, “Those who from Heaven to Earth came,” landed in the Arabian Sea or the Persian Gulf under the leadership of E.A (He whose house is water), and established E. RI.DU (“House in the Faraway Built”). Ea not only gave his name to the planet Ea-rth, but also acquired another title EN.KI –“Lord of Earth.” The text explains that they were here to obtain the gold they needed, ostensibly to create an atmospheric shield to protect their planet. First they tried getting it from distilling the waters of the Persian Gulf. Their home planet, referred to as NIBIRU in the texts, needed more gold than they were able to achieve through this method, so these ‘prospectors’ were set the task of mining it in the AB.ZU—southeastern Africa.
More eventually arrived, in time totaling about 600, while yet another group, the IGI.GI (‘those who observe and see’) remained sky borne, presumably in a space station or mother ship, operating space shuttles back and forth. The ruler of the planet NIBIRU, ANU (the Heavenly One), sent to Earth a supposed half-brother of Enki named EN.LIL (Lord of the Command) to help try and speed up the work.
Both, according to the texts, were Anu’s sons. Enki was the firstborn, and thus the natural heir to the throne. But Enlil, though born later, was born by the official spouse of Anu—a fact that made Enlil the legal heir to the throne. Birthright clashed with succession rules, and although Enki accepted the outcome, the rivalry and anger between the two often burst into the open.
The mining of the gold in the Abzu was under the direction of Enki, while the refining of the gold was supervised by Enlil in a place called ED.IN, near to where they had landed in what then became ancient Mesopotamia.
The ‘Mission Control’ for their space shuttles was in Nippur –called DUR.AN.KI (“The Bond Heaven-Earth). Atop a raised platform, the vital instruments, celestial charts, and orbital-data panels (“the Tablets of Destiny”), were kept in the DIR.GA, a restricted innermost holy-of-holies. The texts also describe a number of what appear to be aerial battles between various flying craft.
Eventually EN.LIL took command of the Seven Cities of the Gods in the ED.IN (Home of the Righteous Ones). Each city was assigned specialized functions: a Mission Control Center, a Spaceport, a center for metallurgy, and even a medical center under the supervision of NIN.MAH (Great Lady), a half sister of both Enki and Enlil.
Have you ever seen Star Trek where on board the Starship Enterprise there are the captain, the first officer, the subordinates, Dr Crusher or the original medical officer Bones? How would one explain the technology of a massive Mothership such as those which might be seen in the movie Independence Day to the very primitive people of a backwards civilization? A planet they would understand floating ‘in the heavens’. How would you explain the hierarchy of command of such a ship to these very same people? As relatives perhaps?
The texts describe the planet, Nibiru, as having a great elliptical orbit that lasts 3600 years (one SAR). Commanders on the mission had tours of duty lasting 8, 10, or even 12 SARs (36,000 years)—supposedly just 8 to 10 of their years. The Annunaki, it was said, arrived 120 SARs before



42
the deluge –432,000 years, or about 441,000 BC. For forty SARS they toiled mining the gold144,000 years, or until about 297,000 BC, but then the miners mutinied.
One must remember here that a race of beings do not send out their most elite to do the menial work of mining. This is more likely often given to slave labor, to hardened ‘convicts’, or to the lower echelons of society. Nor does one put the elite of their planet in the position to rule over this work or these types of people. These people on Earth already had legends of the gods from previous contacts with alien races or those from Atlantis that were handed down to them or in their ‘archetypal memory’. It took little to convince them of the grandiose lies of these less-than-well-to-do aliens.
A SAR is also only the equivalent of 600 years, making the time they came to earth only 72,000 years ago, and the time they mined for gold only 24,000 years. Consider how much modern man has done to the planet in the past 200 years. If an advanced race were to mine this planet for 144,000 years they would have been able to mine every continent down to bedrock, and fill in the holes left behind.
Enlil was for punishment, but Enki was for leniency. Anu sympathized, and the decision was made to use their knowledge of genetic manipulation and in-vitro fertilization to create a human worker to do the mining, using the primitive beings that were currently on the planet in that region.
This is the basic story as told by the Sumerian texts and subsequently repeated in each of Sitchin’s books, only in far greater detail.
The truth is however, that the Annunaki are a race of beings whose home planet is in the constellation of Canis Major, their home planet being in effect the planet spoken of by the Dogon tribe of Mali, West Africa –Sirius B—the ‘poorer neighbor’ of the Sirians and Sirius A. The Dogon are believed to be of Egyptian decent and their astronomical lore goes back thousands of years to 3200 BC. According to their traditions, the star Sirius has a companion star which is invisible to the human eye. This companion star has a 50 year elliptical orbit around the visible Sirius and is extremely heavy. It also rotates on its axis.
Alex Collier, quoted earlier, explains what he knows of the Nibiruans:
“What I know of them in terms of their genetic stock is that the word itself, Nibiru, is a word of Orion origin which I am told means "the joining of two tribes". Apparently this original tribe was created as a marriage between a princess of reptilian-human ancestry from Orion and a group from Sirius of human origin. It was a marriage of alliance, millions of years ago."
And like the offspring of any good family, they moved into the neighborhood, occupying this mysterious white dwarf star known as Sirius B. It is a planet smaller than Earth but one which is extremely, extremely dense. Its inhabitants are fourth dimensional, interesting considering that the Sirians and Orions are all higher dimensional beings. But we shall leave that puzzle for another day.
As Sitchin describes it, it does have many difficulties with its own atmosphere, with the vegetation that grows there, and with the waters upon it. It is a very arid land, hence the need for the atmospheric shield, one on which the palm tree is the central means of survival, thus the references to it as the ‘Tree of Life’. Water is also scarce, and making it drinkable is a time-consuming process, one which gave the Annunaki plenty of skills in filtration of the seawater in search of gold. This also explains the sacredness which they applied to the concept of the ‘Water of Life’ in their composing of the Sumerian texts. Their choice of the Middle Eastern region to set up their colony was in part based on its similarity to their own home planet



43
Just as they had almost done at times here on planet Earth, the Annunaki, over the course of their history had almost destroyed their own environment, but it is NOT true that they came to planet Earth to mine the gold because of their environment. The true purpose shall be discussed as we delve into the Old Testament and the works of Laurence Gardner later in chapter 17.
Their means of travel through space is fairly primitive in terms of other alien races, but they do have spacecraft which they are able to maneuver through the various wormholes and portals in space to get from one side of the galaxy to the other. For this purpose, they have also established a way-station, as it were, on the planet Io, one of the moons of Jupiter. This is located at the nearest end to one of the portals they use that leads into the area of space near to their own home planet. What was written into the movie 2010 about Io was channeled material meant to awaken people to the possibility of these beings using planets or planetoids for their home bases in space.
Barbara Clow hints at this connection in her work also:
“Nibiru’s agenda is to access more feelings, and it is being drawn back into the solar system faster than usual. . . My whole system has the reddish glow of passion, look at Io as it brightens like a diamond waiting for 2010.”
The Sumerian text The Legend of Adapa describes in more detail the actual route taken in the Annunaki’s comings and goings to Earth: “. . the route to Heaven passes between the planets named in Sumerian DIL.GAN (Jupiter) and APIN (Mars). Mars is where a turning is made.”
Prior to the Flood, that Earth was basically a fourth dimensional planet, as were the Annunaki. Their frequent visits were relatively easy at that time. The effect the planet Earth moving into the 3rd dimension had on the relationship between the two, was enormous, as we shall soon see.
The Annunaki’s spacecraft varied in size depending on the needs of the circumstances. They have what would be called ‘mother-ships’ large enough to transport them through the portals and back, as well as to get them from Io to the Earth and back. They then have smaller craft which they use like shuttles to take them from the planet’s surface to their ‘space station’ circling with the Earth in a geosynchronous orbit, and then to their mother ships which did not stay in the area all the time the Annunaki were on the planet. It came and went at regular intervals, depending on the schedule of the opening and closing of the wormholes and their portals.
To a human being of today, let alone one in those days and of that primitive state of consciousness, a Nibiruan mothership of the Annunaki would seem like a planet, especially in a culture where there weren’t already words for things such as UFOs.
The alignment of their temple-terrace and its ziggurat was a part of the ‘Bond Heaven-Earth’, what Sitchin calls incorrectly “one of the earliest if not the very earliest association of a temple with the zodiac.”
This alignment was needed not only to set up communications with their space station, mothership, and the base on Io, but also to help accurately determine the openings and closings of these wormholes and portals. The movie Time Bandits is correct in the way it portrays the openings and closings of ‘time windows’ and portals, although they do however stay open for much longer periods of time than portrayed in the movie.
To facilitate the communications between bases on Io and those near and on the Earth (their temples acting as ground relay stations), the Annunaki also set up relay stations, such as those mentioned by William Bramley in Gods of Eden:



44
“On November 22, 1966, The Washington Post ran a front-page headline proclaiming “Six Mysterious Statuesque Shadows Photographed on the Moon by Orbiter.” The Post story, which was picked up later by The Los Angeles Times, described a lunar photograph snapped two days earlier by U.S. space probe Orbiter 2 as it passed twenty to thirty miles above the moon’s surface. The photograph seems to reveal six spires arranged in a purposeful geometrical pattern inside a small portion of the Sea of Tranquility. The pointedness of the lunar objects’ shadows indicates that they are all either cone-or pyramid-shaped. Although the official NAA press release mentioned nothing unusual about the photograph, other people found the picture remarkable. Dr. William Blair of the Boeing Institute of Biotechnology stated:
“If the cuspids (cone-shaped spires) really were the result of some geophysical event it would be natural to expect to see them distributed at random. As a result, the triangulation would be scalene (three unequal sides) or irregular, whereas those concerning the lunar object lead to a basilary system, with coordinates x, y, z, to the right angle, six isosceles triangles and two axes consisting of three points each.”
“In Argosy magazine, Soviet space engineer Alexander Abromov went a step further by stating:
“The distribution of these lunar objects is similar to the plan of the Egyptian pyramids constructed by Pharaohs Cheops, Chephren, and Menkaura at Gizeh, near Cairo. The Centers of the spires of this lunar “Abaka” (arrangement of pyramids) are arranged in precisely the same way as the apices (tips) of the three great pyramids. (Wilson, Don. Secrets of Our Spaceship Moon. (Dell Publishing Co., 1979), p20.- 21)”
Many of the Annunaki alignments have to do with the constellation of Taurus. Willy Hartener, in his study titled ‘The Earliest History of the constellations in the Near East” (Journal of Near Eastern Studies), analyzed the Sumerian pictorial evidence and concluded that numerous depictions of a bull nudging a lion (from the fourth millennium BC) or a lion pushing bulls (from about 3000 BC) are representation of the zodiacal time when the spring equinox was in the constellation Taurus and the summer solstice occurred in the sign of Leo, at which time the calendrical new year began.
The wormholes and portals through which the Nibiruans travel to get to and from our solar system are thus not always open as it were, and exact timing is needed to be able to travel from one area of space to the other. The necessity for the correct and exact locating and alignment of the stars and the need for an accurate calendar are therefore obvious. These allowed them to travel home on a regular basis, and also not to be stuck here on Earth at times when it was not beneficial to be here. The cycle of these portals opening and closing is along the lines of 3600 years, and they remain open for periods of two to three hundred years at a time, sufficient time for the Annunaki to come and go and still appear as the gods that everybody thought they were. It is the opening of the portals that occurs every 3600 years, not the actual physical planet coming around and traveling through the solar system. This is the reason for the alignment of most of their ‘sacred’ sites to the stars for the calculation of these times, especially to the planet Jupiter.
“Gudea was helped by a team of Divine Architects and gods and goddesses of astronomy to orient the temple and erect its observatories, how and when calendrical requirements were met, and the ceremonies which inaugurated the new temple. . .The rising of Jupiter “is the god Ningishzidda” meant to show the king the exact point in the skies to which the temple’s observatories should be oriented, indicating exactly where the Sun will rise on the day of the New Year in order to build the temple in accordance with the Holy Planet . . . various details of the temple’s architecture, including



45
the design of the special enclosures for the Divine Black Bird and the Supreme Weapon; the Gigunu for the divine couple; an oracle chamber, and a place for the assembly of the gods. Details of utensils and furnishings were also given . . .”
Even the sacred precinct itself was aligned to the zodiac as suggested by Marduk’s sacred precinct having 12 gates through which to enter.
The best picture we can get here of what it was like on board one of these motherships, and also how these Beings were treated by the Earthlings, comes from the Book of Enoch, considered a holy scripture by nearly all the writers of the New Testament.
Enoch was also called EN.ME.DUR.AN.KI (Master of the Divine Tablets of the Bond HeavenEarth) in the Sumerian texts. Enoch was the seventh in pre-diluvial patriarchs, ENMEDURANKIS was the seventh king on the Sumerian King List –he reigned for six sars –21,600 years in Sitchin’s estimation, 3,600 years in terms of ours. He was made a priest, “one who controls information,” and thus an intercessor between man and Anu or the gods –“Thus was the line of priests created, those who are allowed to approach Shamash and Adad (son and nephew of Enlil).”
It is handy to keep in mind here again a vision of the Starship Enterprise from Star Trek, or perhaps one of the large battle cruisers from one of the Star Wars series of movies. Especially keep in mind the bridge and its large screen, and imagine what might be seen from the bridge if the ship were parked far out above the Earth. Also keep in mind the map room, and the ‘core reactor’ room as a visitor might have seen them. Then try and imagine the words a primitive visitor would have used to describe these places, in particular one who was not used to artificial lighting or any form of advanced technology. Then imagine the description he would write of the journey he takes from the Earth to the mother ship, on board a small shuttle craft.
“Enoch tells his children Methuselah and Regim, “keep the faith of One Almighty God” . . . (then they) bore him up to the First Heaven where he saw a mighty sea (the Persian Gulf), then to the second heaven where he saw people being tormented for sins against the Lord (a destroyed area of land). In the third Heaven he saw Paradise with the Tree of Life (the jungles of Africa); the Fourth heaven, the longest, where he was shown the secrets of the Sun and the Moon, of stars and constellations and the calendar (the outer layers of the atmosphere). The Fifth Heaven was the end of Heaven and Earth and the banishment place of “the angels who have connected themselves with women” . . . where he could “see seven stars of heaven bound together” (A space station such as in 2001: A Space Odyssey, one where some of the Annunaki were kept in space away from temptation. A way station for the flight into deeper space). The first part of the journey ended. Passing through the seventh and eighth levels of heaven seeing all the different cherubims and angels and archangels (the hierarchy of command in their various hierarchical regalia) –there the stars that make up the constellations could already be seen (far into space) . . . the ninth heaven he could see the heavenly homes of the twelve signs of the zodiac . . . the Tenth heaven. . .where he was brought before the Lord’s face,” (just the face as on the big viewing screen) –a sight too awesome to be described (in reality, they do not look like us). . . “the Lord says . . . stand before my face and gain eternity.”
For thirty days and thirty nights, the Archangel Pravuel was dictating and Enoch was writing down the secrets of “the works of heaven, earth, sea, and all the elements, their passages and goings, and the thunderings of the thunder, and the Sun and the Moon, the goings and changes of the stars, the seasons, years, days, hours” and “all human things, the tongue of every human song .



46
. and all things fitting to learn.” It filled up 360 books. He then returned to Earth for thirty days only to give these writings to his sons to pass from generation to generation. . . Every thirty days –once a month—they made the trip to and from the outlying heaven—the mother ship.
Arriving in Heaven, Enoch described reaching a wall “which is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire. . . He braved the fire and came upon a house made of crystals whose ceiling emulated the starry sky and showed the path of stars (the map room as seen in a Star Trek movie). In his vision he then saw a second house, larger and more magnificent than the first. Braving the fires that enflamed it, he saw inside a throne of crystal resting upon streams of fire; “its appearance was crystal and the wheels thereof as a shining sun.” Seated on the throne was the Great Glory, but not even the angels could approach and behold His face because of the brilliance and magnificence of His glory. Enoch prostrated himself, hiding his face and trembling. But then “the Lord called me with His own mouth, and said, ‘Come hither, Enoch, and hear my words.” Then an angel brought him closer and he heard the Lord tell that because he was a scribe and righteous, he would become an interceder for men and would be taught heavenly secrets.”
I cannot help when reading this to remember the scene from the Wizard of Oz where Dorothy and her companions are confronted by the large face of Oz, only to find out later that he was a scared old man hiding behind a screen. It just seems to fit. So much of what we are about to deal with fits into this metaphor of the Wizard of Oz, for so many of these Beings who have interfered with this planet and with its people have been like the little old wizard standing behind the screen. They pull the strings and the fear-making thought-forms make us all dance. Until that is, the screen is finally knocked over and the wizard exposed for what he really is. ‘Smoke and mirrors’ is an expression we shall use a great deal throughout this history, for that is what most of it has been. Now it comes time to blow away the proverbial smoke and smash threw those ‘oh-so-shiny’ mirrors.
If you begin to wonder how so much information was stored by Enoch, the Sumerian texts talk about the MEs which contained the information needed by the Annunaki for their space flight information, and containing other sorts of data. We like to think of these MEs as standing for “magnetic encoders” or “memory encoders,” because the information is magnetically encoded on the disks, just like a magnetic tape or computer disk. They contained all the information that subsequently could then be given to the people on the planet to raise their level of civilization. How else could one get so much information onto small “disks” that could teach a person such as Enoch all the elements of a specific subject. Obviously, both the Annunaki and the Sirians had the ability to store great amounts of information to bring with them in their advanced technology.
And they were indeed related to the Sirians (who are fifth dimensional beings) and to the Men from Orion (who are 7th dimensional). It is a point to be made here that it is much simpler to control a race of people who are 3rd dimensional and believing that they are so, than it is to control a 5th dimensional race with 12th dimensional capabilities. The bullies of the Universe pick on the ‘younger’ kids as well, just like they do here on Earth.
This relationship between the Annunaki and their ‘masters’, was more in the form of lackeys or as a servile or subservient race, rather than as equals or competitors. Stories of the wars upon Earth between these races are correct, the wars being caused by the jealousy the Annunaki had for the level of technology of the Sirians, and also of the control the Sirians exercised upon the planet through their presence in the later stages of Lemuria’s existence, and most of the time in Atlantis.



47
In referring to Nibiru as the 12th planet, know that indeed there are twelve planets in this area of the solar system, not including the Moon, some which have yet to be classified as planets and some which have yet to be discovered. Nibiru is not one of them.
The Annunaki first came to Earth as prospectors for gold around 72,000 years ago. Neanderthal man, wearing clothes and practicing ritual burials, with a brain very much comparable to ours was on the planet. These are the ones who seemingly made no progress throughout the course of their history here on the planet.
A news article from the University Of California at Berkeley of 3-29-00, addresses the kind of time the planet and its residents need to regain from major catastrophes such as pole shifts. This is an important fact to keep in mind in explaining how ‘alien-intervention’ and star seeding could be the only possible explanation for the quick turn around of civilization after such cataclysmic events as the Great Flood:
“Berkeley - The Earth needs, on average, about 10 million years to recover from a mass extinction of the planet's species, far longer than most scientists thought, according to a new study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, and Duke University.
“Moreover, the recovery time is the same whether the global die-off involves the loss of most life on Earth or wipes out far fewer species.”
Lemuria was an established empire at this time.
The miners rebelled after 24,000 years, bringing us to that all important time of about 50,000 BC when Lucifer set his eyes more firmly on this planet. It took very little genetic sophistication for the Annunaki to produce a more modern man out of Neanderthal Man by stripping him of his genetic makeup and synthesizing that more complex one of what we know of as Homo Sapiens—the one which joined Neanderthal man on the planet somewhere about 40,000 years ago, according to the latest scientific research just recently released.
This gave the Annunaki their ‘worker race’, and for a long time this is how they remained. You do not want your workers to ‘evolve’ as such, but rather to remain just where they are.
It was approximately 200,000 years ago that the mitochondrial research says that man had his original female ancestor—“Eve,” but this is one of the lies of science meant to cover up our uncommon genetic backgrounds and keep us all enslaved. The Annunaki’s genetic manipulation took extensive time and, like Dr. Moreau, there were possibly lots of ‘failures’ along the way. Like the manipulation done by the Grays, it is not always easy to mess with the intricate workings of Creation.
As Ramtha suggests, looking further back than about 100,000 years ago, the time of the Neanderthals, is not to be dealing with modern man as we now know Him.
It was in this period of approximately 50,000 years ago when the consciousness of the Earthborn inhabitants had progressed sufficiently for the Annunaki to create the ‘Adam and Eve’ that Sitchin talks about as the first ‘conscious’ human worker, one who was genetically similar to us, yet so much less than what Mankind had originally been created to be. And the purpose for creating these new kinds of Human Being was not to act as a mine worker, but in fact to be a slave race for much more than the working in the mines.



48
Fifty thousand years ago is when Atlantis had its turning point. Lemuria was in the last stages of its high civilization, before it sank about 30,000 years ago—it was growing toward the end of the Neanderthals years, when they ‘suddenly disappeared.’
The Annunaki are a race of beings who fit into that part of history touched on by the Nine in their statement, “Many things have been set into motion many thousands of years ago . . . there are things which were not part of the planning . . . that come about by greed and vanity and desire.”
The Nephilim were sent here at this later date by the dark Sirian warlords to help destroy the federations plans for constructing a ladder to heaven through the creation of one multi-dimensional human being. They were also sent here to provide drugs for the Sirian-Orion Empire, drugs we shall deal with more later, but drugs all the same. The drug wars and addiction problems we are having on this planet right now are archetypal of the drug wars that have gone on before and were not always the doing of Mankind Himself.
Just as the Nine spoke earlier of the Alteans being eternal, and the Hoovids living approximately one million of our years relative to the density of their home planets, so too do the Annunaki live for very long periods of time in terms of earth years, enough to make it seem to the people on Earth that the Annunaki were eternal. However, to consider the great lengths of time that Sitchin talks about is also incorrect. While not the Annunaki per se, the Draconians are related to them, and their extraordinary lifespan is only 4,000 years at best. Again, Alex Collier:
“The average life span of the Draconians extends from 1,800 to 4,100 years of age. The ones that live as long as 4,100 years are the royal line of the Draconians . . . The winged Ciakars.”
In their texts, the Sumerians described their civilization as a gift from the gods, the visitors to Earth who could roam the skies and were therefore often depicted as winged beings. Here again it is good to remember the lessons of chapter one where so much of our history is clouded by metaphors and symbolism. To a primitive person, any being that could fly was portrayed with wings, no matter in what sort of craft they flew. Any kind of genetic cross between an animal and a human was portrayed with one half the body being human, and one half the other creature involved. Those ‘gods’ portrayed with animal heads were wearing masks, or creating holographic images, so as not to confuse or scare the general populace. Again—watch the two movies of ‘V’—see how the humanoid aliens disguised themselves in terms of their true frightening appearance. Stargate is also an excellent portrayal of many of these ideas. Fantasy is just a reflection of reality, both here and in the higher worlds.
As far as can be discerned, the Nibiruans are a metallic biological life-form, with a blood system based on a copper, blue –just like humans is before exposure to air. They appear more like a reptile than a human. Gilgamesh’s metallic friend would probably have been similar to an Annunaki, but more likely one of the ‘wild’ failures or cross-breeds, much like Dr. Moreau also had his cast-off failures. It is perhaps a stretch of the imagination to encompass a metallic force as being biological, but there are far more unusual life-forms in the Universe than even George Lucas may be able to predict. The Annunaki are cold-blooded creatures, related in many ways to the crocodiles and other reptilian life-forms on this planet. The legends involving dragons originated with these ‘winged’ reptiles—the reptilian aliens who could fly (in spacecraft).
This is the other side of the Annunaki which is not told in the Sumerian texts for indeed, as the Gnostic Texts suggested earlier in this chapter—truly the dragons of old that could fly were “reptilian” and very possibly “devoured people.”



49
According to Clow, when the Annunaki visit Earth, they wear various costumes over their bodies, since otherwise they would look like reptilian metal robots. She also suggests that the television mini-series of the 1970s called ‘V’ was in fact a lifelike scenario of the Annunaki’s visit to Earth, a television series made by Annunaki infiltrators left here on the planet.
The premise for the series is that aliens, looking much like regular human beings, appear on Earth in an apparent goodwill gesture of friendship. Eventually they begin to take over the planet. Soon we discover that the human appearance is simply a disguise, masking the true reptilian nature of these beings. Some of the creatures are sympathetic toward Man, and a union between an alien male and a human female produces an offspring that turns out to be the key to defeating the grandiose plans of the invaders. Truth is often stranger than the fiction.
It needs to be clarified here for it is important to the rest of our history, that neither the Akkadians nor the Sumerians ever called these visitors to Earth ‘gods’. Sitchin says it was through later paganism that the notion of Divine Beings or Gods filtered into our language and thinking. The Akkadians called them Ilu or ‘Lofty Ones’, from which the Hebrew El stems. He suggests that the Canaanites and Phoenicians called them Ba’al which translates into ‘Lord’, but this is not who these people were referring to as we shall soon see. If you were an English peasant back in the Middle Ages then you had your Lord and master. That’s exactly the way these aliens were looked upon back in ancient Mesopotamia –‘as lords and masters’, the humans at that time having been created to serve in exactly that role—as slaves to these ‘lesser gods’.
Thus we have a situation where we have these rulers here on Earth, ruling a race of beings who they created to be serfs and peasants and slaves. These people, for their part, don’t know anything different because they have no prior knowledge of anything different in their minds. They had no prior concept of religion or worship, until they were taught it, until the ‘Lofty Ones’ went, leaving their intercessors—the priests—in charge to tell the stories about ‘the gods’. The mind of a child is a very malleable thing, as the Dark force already knows. Train it to think like its parents and it will, from all likelihood, continue to behave just like its parents do. This is the archetype of our Creator Parents, just as it is with our Alien parents, just as it is with our Human parents. We are born to be a slave race and trained by our parents to be slaves (unless we are very fortunate to be taught to think for ourselves and encouraged to find that information that tells us different). Then we are put through an education system that makes us conform to being good little worker slaves. All the institutions are in place to keep us just that way as well, and should we need ‘reprogramming’, just as mentioned happens on Orion, those institutions are also here in place as well.
In all the Sumerian writings, Nibiru is called the “Supreme Planet” or ‘the Celestial Lord,’ an idea that we are saying is a hoax played upon the ignorant and accepting population of the Earth of that time. Sitchin says that this is the same planet the Egyptians call the ‘Imperishable Star’ or the ‘Planet of a Million Years’, but since the Egyptians were founded by the Atlanteans, and even their Great Pyramid was aligned with Sirius, it is more likely to Sirius A or to some other star in the constellation of Orion that they were referring.
The celestial symbol of Nibiru was The Winged Disc, often depicted with the whole solar system (a central deity surrounded by a family of eleven planets, flanking a Tree of Life—the palm tree). This in fact was a representation of the ‘mother ship’ which was often visible to the population in the night sky, seeming to be another bright star or planet of the solar system as it was perceived to them. Easier to say ‘planet’ to a primitive peoples than to explain the advanced concept of a UFO.



50
Based on what they had learned from the Nefilim, the Sumerians counted the planets not as we do, from the sun outward, but from the outside in. Thus Pluto was the first planet, Neptune the second, Uranus the third, Saturn the fourth, Jupiter the fifth. Mars accordingly was the sixth, Earth the seventh, and Venus the eighth, suggesting to Sitchin that the Annunaki and their planet passed these other planets in just that same order coming into the solar system—but why not the other way around if they also pass out of the solar system? And this same alignment would remain true no matter what the craft they came in.
Annunaki Set Up Shop
Certain words of the Nine come back at this time when dealing with the Annunaki:
“. . . when there is one who understands the energies of all Creation, and how they then may utilize those energies to make themselves a god, then they keep people in bondage, for they then seek to have control over others, in order to feel that they are a god.”
This is exactly what happened with the Annunaki and their relationship with human beings, even though it was probably unintentional in the beginning, they ‘got off’ on the power and made themselves into gods.
William Bramley says that the word “god” alone contains too much undeserved awe, especially since historical and modern-day testimony indicates that these “gods” are just as “human” in their behavior as any one of us. The term “ancient astronaut” pigeonholes them into the distant past when, in fact, Sitchin and Clow’s work make it appear that they have maintained a continuous presence all the way up until today. The label “extraterrestrial” is too broad. So what should we call them? Daddy?
It is here again that the Tree of Life symbolism becomes important, for in the various creation stories, particularly the Sumerian and Biblical versions, it is related that they (the Annunaki gods) feared lest their newly created creature, Adam or ‘the Adam’, partake of the fruit of the Tree of Life and become as they were, thereby trying to unseat them in their position of power.
“Fearing, evidently, a human race unified in culture and purpose, the Nefilim adopted the imperial policy: “Divide and rule.” For while Mankind reached cultural levels that included even airborne efforts—after which “anything they shall scheme to do shall no longer be impossible for them”—even the Nefilim themselves were a declining lot. By the third millennium BC, children and grandchildren, to say nothing of humans of divine parentage, were crowding the great olden gods.”
Even the gods got older as they began to stay for longer and longer periods upon the planet. Their long lives on their home planet made them fear death more directly as they felt their limitations in the denser atmosphere and the vibration of planet Earth.
“You are doomed unless you stop fearing death. We are the ones who caused you to fear death, because we age very fast while we sojourn on Earth. We age 3600 years during one of your Earth years”. (Clow)
They used all their technology for repolarization of the DNA such as was used in Atlantis, to keep themselves young and alive. They even used the DNA of humans to interact with their own to make them more adaptable to the situation here on Earth, especially as the planet lowered nearer and nearer to being fully 3rd dimensional. But still it was not enough. . some retained the longevities acquired on Nibiru and longer due to the plentiful supply of age-enhancing drugs they found here on



51
Earth, others—the first generation of Earth—were partly affected by Earth’s shorter cycles, and yet others—third and fourth generations—became more Earthlike than Nibiruan.
“The gods did grow old –Ninmah was young and attractive when she arrived as Chief Medical Officer, still youthful when Adam was created, later called Lady of the Mountainpeaks or Ninsirhag, but when Inanna rose to power she was referred to as Mammi, “old Mother,” and depicted as an aging goddess.”
That is why the gods had their own crystal, DNA-regenerating Tree of Life, their own version of the Atlantean Temple of Healing and Rejuvenation. Remember, just as radiation can destroy or mutate genetics, so too can crystal energy rejuvenate our DNA, our genetics and even our bodily organs as well. And along with the Water of Life and the Food of Life, images that have been handed down to us in Christian ritual as the Water of Life and the Bread of Life, the Annunaki were able to maintain their genetics without aging near as fast as they would have if left alone to adapt. The ziggurat style of the Sumerian temples also helped toward this same end—using pyramid power much like has been done in modern experiments to stop food from aging.
It bears repeating here that this was the crystal Tree of Life that Gilgamesh saw in his search for immortality as described in the Epic of Gilgamesh:
“Gilgamesh . . . saw “an enclosure of the gods” wherein there was a garden; but the “garden” was made up entirely of artificially carved precious stones: “All kinds of thorny Prickly Bushes were visible, blooming with gemstones; Carnelian bore fruit hanging in clusters, its vines too beautiful to behold. The foliage was of lapis lazuli; and grapes, too lush to look at, of . . . stones were made.” The partly damaged verses go on to list other kinds of fruit-bearing trees and the variety of precious stones—white and red and green—of which they were made. Pure water ran through the garden, and in its midst he saw “like a tree of Life and a Tree of . . . that of An-gug stones were made.”
It is also revealed to Gilgamesh that the gods use a plant to make their Food of Life:
“A plant there is, like a prickly berrybush is its root. Its thorns are like a brier-vine’s; thine hands the thorns will prick. (But) if with thine own hands the plant you could obtain, rejuvenation you will find (spikenard)”
To supplement these other miraculous rejuvenators, the Annunaki also partook of their own Tree of Life which they had brought with them—the palm tree—as described by Enoch, the tree that gives streams of honey, milk, oil and wine (the coconut palm from which we get milk and oil, the date palm from which we get honey and date wine).
“As to the tree, no mortal is to touch it until the great judgement. Its food is for the elect. Its fragrance shall be in their bones and they shall live a long live on earth.”
“And the angel who was with him confirmed that indeed it was the very tree from which Adam and Eve had eaten before they were driven out of Eden. It was as high as a fir, its leaves were as of the carob, and its fruit like the clusters of the vine.”
Reminiscent of Jacob’s ladder and Enoch’s own ascent to the Tenth Heaven is this creation myth of primitive America that echoes the idea of maintaining eternal youth through the use of a substance called the Water of Life:
“Olebus, he who sits above (perhaps in his spaceship) was about to create mankind. He sent two emissaries to earth to construct a ladder which would connect Earth and Heaven. Half way up



52
the ladder he set up a resting place with a pool of pure drinking waters. At the summit there were two springs, one for drinking and the other for . . . When a man or a woman grows old says Olebus, let him or her climb up to this summit and drink and bathe, whereupon his youth shall be restored.”
Adam and Eve
In the days when Adam and Eve were created by the Annunaki, the hominids that were on the planet were living in clans and following the great herd of animals for their livelihood. They spent the warm seasons by the sea or by the rivers and lakes living on plants, berries, and fish. When the great gods, the Annunaki, came to Earth, there was no conception of who they were. The gods began to tell stories about where they came from; but they were not understood. Somehow it was grasped that they journeyed to some faraway place, perhaps north above the ice to the source of many ancient legends. And life did not get any better with their arrival.
As Bramley puts it, the Sumerian tablets described lives of endless drudgery for the Annunaki “gods” as they carried out building, excavation, and mining operations on Earth. The ‘gods’ were not at all happy with their lot. They were prone to complaining, backstabbing, and rebellion against their leaders. A solution was needed and it was found in the idea to create a new creature capable of performing the same labors as they had been doing. With this purpose in mind, the “gods” decided to create a worker from the existing hominids on the planet.
Enki basically says, “Let’s create a primitive worker to do the work.” There were hominids in Southeastern Africa at the time and all that was needed was “to bind upon it the image of the gods.” This would “create a mixed one . . . to toil for the gods.” This is almost exactly identical to Genesis, Chapter 1 – “And Elohim (plural) said: Let us make the Adam in our image, after our likeness” – “And Elohim created the Adam in His image; in the image of Elohim created He him.”
The Bible translators appear to have had a constant problem with the word Earth - often translating it to ground, clay or dust, instead of recognizing it as relating to The Earth. Even in the case of Adam and Eve, the translators made glaring errors. The Bible says, 'Male and female created he them, and he called their name Adam'. Older writings use the more complete word Adâma, which means 'of the Earth'. However, this did not mean they were made of dirt; it means (as the Anchor Hebrew Bible explains in precise terms) that they were Earthlings.
Then came the problems with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life. Even in the Christian Bible this Adam that was created was not worthy or seen fit to have either the Knowing or the Longevity of the god(s).
In the Gnostic text titled, The Revelation of Adam, Adam describes to his son, Seth, how he and Eve were enslaved to the god that made them:
“And we served him in fear and servility. And after this we became dark in our hearts. And I, for my part, was asleep in the thinking of my heart.”
The Mesopotamian tablets tell a creation story in which one of the “gods” is put to death by the other “gods,” and then the body and blood are mixed into clay. Out of this concoction a human being is made, the new earth creature apparently very similar in appearance to its original creators.
Clow suggests that all the Annunaki did was to make the mixture out of primordial Earth elements using silica-based clay for humans so that they could read and program our minds –this would stand to reason if one considers that what the Annunaki were basically creating was indeed a slave race.



53
The Legend of Adapa speaks of Adapa as being a protégé of Enki who chose him “to become as a model of men,” who he then “gave him wisdom, but did not give him eternal life.” Enki even made him a Shem–what Sitchin translates to “a rocket”, but is in fact a name, that as the story goes, he breaks.
Many of the Biblical Old Testament stories such as the Creation story were translated or borrowed from earlier texts, particularly those of the Hebrews’ predecessors in Sumeria and Akkad. It must be remembered that Abraham himself came from Ur, where his father was a temple priest.
Sitchin exhaustively analyzes the Sumerian creation stories. He concludes that the tale of a god’s body being mixed with clay probably referred to some form of biological engineering. He supports his surprising conclusion by pointing to the Sumerian tablets which state that the first humans were bred in the wombs of female “gods,” for according to the tablets, the gods had both male and female bodies, and bred by sexual intercourse. This was not true to some extent, however, since the Annunaki had to be made ‘compatible’ with humans later on, and were in fact egg producers much like reptiles here on Earth. Sitchin believes that the “clay” was a special substance that could be inserted into a womb, perhaps something we might say was an artificial egg. That substance held the genetically-engineered cells of the new slave creature, Homo sapiens. Interestingly, modern scientists have bred related animals in a similar fashion, such as the zebra in the womb of a horse.
There is no demonstrated relationship between the Neanderthals and those who also came to share space with them for a few millennia: Homo Sapiens Sapiens (Human the Wise). The Neanderthals left the fossil records about 30,000 years ago, possibly 20,000 years after the creation of the Annunaki Adam.
One must also here go back to the dating of the cataclysms which sank parts of Atlantis to find the events that also affected the fossil record and the creation or upgrading of the species. The first of these events took place in Cayce’s opinion around 50,000 BC, when a portion of the continent was destroyed. The second occurred around 28,000 BC (that 30,000BC jump in the consciousness of mankind) when the remaining land was split into islands. The final destruction occurred around 10,000 BC (9,000 to be more exact). Remember that a catastrophe that could cause the break up of a continent such as Atlantis would have to have great influence on the rest of the world as well. Without serious intervention from our alien ancestry, mankind could have been on its knees for the 10 million years as prescribed by the University of California findings.
So Neanderthal and Homo sapiens sapiens shared the same planet for a period of at least 20,000 years but without ever co-mingling.
Adam and Eve
The story of Adam and Eve is one of the major stumbling blocks of the Old Testament, for there have indeed been three sets of Adams and Eves—three very different sets of Beings who would fit that story as it is told in the Bible. This does not take into consideration the five Adams that Cayce speaks of who were simultaneously planted on the Earth as five different races, or the original ‘Adams and Eves’ of the Spiritual Hierarchy.
The first set of Adams and Eves were the three sets of twins who were brought to the planet from the higher physical dimensions in their purpose to begin life anew on this planet once it had been deemed habitable by the local spiritual hierarchy. This was about 2 million years ago. They were aware Beings who had the abilities to support themselves and to reproduce, though they were then at a primitive level as



54
opposed to the level at which mankind finds himself today. This is along the lines as stated earlier that “the Alteans are of two polarities blended in togetherness, and the Hoovids are tri-polarities.” Even today man has within him the potential of both sexes, the male his female half, the female her male half. Hermaphrodites are still born who have the genitalia of both male and female sexes.
The second of these Adams and Eves is the set of Beings who were brought together in Aksu to form the original parents to be the hosts for the regeneration of the implanted seeds of alien culture to this planet.
The black or Negroid population of the planet arose from the blending of the original three sets of twins brought to the planet. The fossils that have been found in East Africa relate to these three couples who were the twin halves of one being –this could in some way account for the soulmate idea that has found itself so popular today.
The Nine confirm the first two sets of Adams and Eves in their channelings on Aksu and the seeding taking place there:
“The black race had evolved to their point, and the seeds had evolved to their own point . . . the arrival of the Hawk changed the stakes, however, by infusing new DNA coding into humanity . . . . the others were in simple societies at that time, and there was a mixing of genes with them. . . The civilizations had never mixed with the original race.”
This last point is VERY important to gain an understanding that there were two different streams of ‘evolution’ going on around the planet at the one time. Much like today when there are Star seeds interacting with the general population of the planet to uplift Mankind and lead Him into the ascension process, in those days there were the civilizations made from star seeding and the survivors of the Mars/Maldek wars, AND there were those that the Nine refer to as the original race living in simple societies—those whom the Annunaki toyed with during their genetic experiments.
The third set of Adams and Eves were the ones created from Neanderthals more than forty thousand years ago by the Annunaki after that 50,000 BC catastrophe that sank part of the Atlantean continent and devastated much of Mankind around the planet. Their purpose this time was to create a slave race that could reproduce and breed other slaves who would work the mines, tend the fields, and act as servants for the aliens while they were on the planet. Their ulterior and far darker motive in doing this, however, was to disrupt the plans of the Council of Nine and the 24 Civilizations in the creation of a greater and finer essence of the Universe in one grand human being. It is the same in this century where you have ‘primitive’ people living right alongside towering cities
These Homo sapiens sapiens were quite a step up from the Homo sapiens mine workers the Annunaki had helped create earlier for exactly that purpose.
Sitchin confirms in passing that the creation of Adam by the Annunaki was not a success at first, there being other Beings—mostly, but not only the creations of Enki—that seem to be neither male nor female as well as neither divine nor human, a kind of android—automatons in human form.
As Ramtha tells it, the first men came forth only after much experimentation by a group of the gods. At first only males were created, and these were created without even having loins.
“The loins were inside of them so that they could reproduce themselves through the process
called cloning. Thus all man-embodiments looked alike when they were first created. And they were rather humble creatures who would be considered very grotesque to you today. But to the gods in those times, they were very beautiful. Unfortunately, they were not very swift on their feet; thus they



55
were continuously made a meal of by the animals about. So the gods tried and tested and modified them for a long time. . . When “womb of man” or woman was created much later, as a more
perfected form of man, it permitted uniqueness and further refinement of the embodiment through the sharing of genes. The man would carry in his seed the patterns of his understanding gained to that point, and the woman would carry it in her egg. Through the act of copulation, the genetic patterns of the two would come together to create an even greater entity, based on the learning and realizations of both its parents. Yet they were creating only a better body through this process, not a better spirit.”
Clow also confirms the length of time it took to perfect the creation of the Adam:
“The previous hundreds of thousands of years of genetic manipulation by Nibiruans had created many aberrations. (The Annunaki having used the planet as an experimental base for long periods of time before finally remaining).In fact, all of the diseases known to humanity were originally triggered from conception between Nibiruans and earthlings who fused with insufficient erotic vibration . . . Conversely, the mental superiority of the Nibiruans did not mix easily with the evolving humans.”
The first experiments of the Annunaki were, indeed, trying to mix animal-like qualities in a human form in order to have worker-humans, and many primitive ‘creat-ures’ were ‘creat-ed’, but these did not in fact work because the DNA chromosomes trigger the growth of certain aspects of a human or animal. They couldn’t be blended throughout, only certain characteristics added or subtracted. Thus they had to go to blending themselves with humans, but they didn’t want them to have all the abilities they possessed.
In the Atra Hasis text and other Mesopotamian texts the creation story is more detailed. These texts also say it was a creative process not without frustrating trials and errors until the procedure was perfected. The “essence of a young Annunaki male was mixed with the egg of a female hominid” and inserted into the womb of a female Annunaki. A “model man” was created.
“And so it was that LULU. AMELU, “the mixtured worker,” was created, out of genetic manipulation and the fertilization of the Apewoman’s egg in a laboratory flask. The hybrids could not procreate; female Annunaki had to act each time as birth-goddesses. But Enki and Ninsirhag perfected them through trial and error until the perfect model was achieved. They named him Adam, “He of Earth—Earthling. . . . Some of the principal deities, members of the sacred circle of Twelve, were themselves in a way Earthlings: Nanar/Sin and Ishkur/Adad, Enlil’s younger sons, were born on Earth; so were of course Sin’s twin children, Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar.”
The Nine address the variations in the evolutionary pattern of Earth in this part of one channeling:
“All humanity looks to the heavens as the source of their beginnings—also there were some civilizations or sub-civilizations that were also able to come for the impregnation of women of humankind, and to set their stream.”
Enki was, in fact, able to create his own version of evil spirits –called Enkum—“part human, part animal” – extensions of his research involving the creation of man. These were warrior like Beings with the bodies of cave birds. The Annunaki were often said to wear bird masks, great wings, even bird claws, much like the later gods in Egypt. Lilith, “she of the night” and the howler”, said to be Adam’s first mate, had wings and was always portrayed with owls. Lilith was said to have left Adam because he tried to dominate her. In all likelihood, she too was one of Enki’s experiments in mixing.



56
The many varied legends of half animal-half human creatures such as the satyr and the griffin are examples of these ‘failed’ genetic experiments at creating a perfect worker and/or slave race for the Annunaki. They, however, are not the only ones to ever perform such experiments. The Atlanteans, too, were active in their pursuit of new and unusual creatures through the use of their knowledge of genetics and biological transplantation. Toward the end, many troublesome Atlanteans were used in such experimentation much as the Nazis did in the concentration camps during the Second World War. Today’s geneticists are repeating many of the same errors of those who have gone before them, or as it might be said, in Cayce’s eyes, repeating many of the mistakes they have already made in lifetimes before this one. Already the mixing of animal and human genes is being experimented with, supposedly to benefit mankind. The Island of Dr. Moreau is a wonderful allegory of this time and the results one might end up with if one is not careful.
Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein, wrote her book after having a dream which she described in the following way:
“My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reveries. I saw with shut eyes, but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together—I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engines, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion.”
Frankenstein, too, is a wonderful allegory of the creation of Man by the Annunaki, and perhaps Mary Shelley’s vision was exactly that—a vision rather than a dream. While there are many older stereotypes of the Frankenstein movie, the movie by Kenneth Brannagh, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, is more realistic and another well worth watching in conjunction with this reading. In the original story and in this movie, the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein is a sympathetic creature who does not understand himself or the different parts of other beings from which he has been made.
“Creature: As I strangled him, I saw your face. You gave me these emotions, but you didn’t tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead because of us. Why? Something at work in my soul that I do not understand. What of my soul? Do I have one? Or is that a part you left out? Who were these people of whom I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
“Dr. Frankenstein: Appearance, nothing more.
“Creature: You’re wrong. You know I knew how to play this (flute). In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And not so much of things learned, but things remembered (a suggestion of genetic memory).
“Dr. Frankenstein: Something left in the brain, perhaps?
“Creature: Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions? You give me life, but then you left me to die. Who am I?
“Dr. Frankenstein: I don’t know.
“Creature: And you think I am evil?
“Dr. Frankenstein: What can I do?
“Creature: There is something I want. A friend. A companion. A female. Someone like me so she won’t hate me.



57
“Dr. Frankenstein: Like you? Oh, God. You don’t know what you’re asking.
“Creature: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you could scarcely imagine, and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy one, I will indulge the other.”
Is this not a summary of the human condition, an allegory of our creation? The creature had more heart and soul than that which created him; a condition we have already learned is a part of the nature of our alien creators. As with Dr. Moreau, the Creature calls Dr. Frankenstein ‘Father’.
In the same way we have made our alien creators into gods. Once we called them father, then we called them God. They just created us for the mines or to be slaves—we still call them “Lord.”
The Gnostic Scriptures speak of Adam’s creation just as allegorically as Mary Shelley did in a fragment titled: Virgin Birth of Adam and Christ:
“ADAM came into being from two virgins: from the spirit and from the virgin earth. The anointed (Christ) was born of a virgin so that he might rectify the fall that occurred in the beginning.”
Bramley’s point of view on the Creation points out the ludicrousness of what we ourselves have been forced to swallow for many generations, and yet have never really given any thought.
“To preserve Homo sapiens as a slave race and to prevent future rebellion, spiritual knowledge was repressed, human beings were scattered geographically into different linguistic groups, and conditions were created to make physical survival on Earth an all-consuming chore from birth until death. The arrangement was to be maintained indefinitely for as long as the (Annunaki) possessed Earth. In contrast, the modern view is that human beings had evolved accidentally from “star stuff” into slime, into fishes, into monkeys, and finally into people. The modern view actually seems more fanciful than the ancient one.
“In the story of Adam and Eve we noted the appearance of a snake. The serpent was said to be “god’s” enemy, Satan, who had literally transformed himself into a reptile. The Bible suggests that snakes are feared and disliked to this day because of Satan’s alleged transformation back in the Garden of Eden. However, it should be remembered that the Biblical Adam and Eve story is entirely symbolic. The snake, too, was a symbol, not an actual reptile.”
The next problem the Annunaki had to contend with was that a Being created from the mixing of the two races would still be a very intelligent Being with certain powers and abilities that would not make it conducive to being servile—thus something else needed to be done to limit the Adam’s ability and eventual desire for freedom.
“Now that Adam has become as one of us, to know good and evil, what if he shall put forth his hand and also take of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever?”
The solution was the symbolic ‘pruning’ of the Adam’s Tree of Life.
Enki suggested to “bind upon him the image of the gods” and create Homo sapiens. The problem was how to make him like ‘us’ and yet also not like ‘us’. The ideal was to strip away those parts of the DNA which made him “equal to the Gods.” And that is what they did in their laboratories in creating subsequent Adams, for that is what they called the race, ‘the Adam’. Using there, by now, advanced genetic manipulation techniques, they stripped away some of the strands of DNA that would make Adam fully fourth-dimensional, fully cognizant of himself and his place in the grander Universe. They stripped the DNA down to a bare minimum for the functioning of a simple creature.



58
As has been already mentioned, but bears repeating here, to go back before 100,000 years is to be looking at humans who were different from us—the difference was that those humans had twelve strands of DNA, not simply the two we have today!
“The levels of consciousness are directly related to the number of chromosomes we have in our genetic makeup.”
Some of these strands are invisible, or non-biological. Part of the DNA system consists of invisible magnetic strands that provide the magnetic information to each cell, as discussed in the section on morphogenetics. This magnetic information helps the cells to know what their purpose is, as well as each cell’s “regeneration properties.” The extra strands of DNA were also originally our connection with our ‘higher self’, that part of us from which we have now been ‘disconnected’. In stripping us of our 12-stranded DNA, the Annunaki effectively made us what we are, a race of slaves waiting for our Lords and Masters to return—or more properly for ‘our Lord and Master’ to return-Lucifer. Enki, took on the figure of the double helix, the structure of the DNA he had given the Adam, as his person symbol.
We see this same image of the double-stranded DNA today on the caduceus, the Hippocratic symbol representing the medical profession of the world. Another symbol of the Tree of Life, it combines the element of the serpents wrapping themselves around the central trunk of the Treestrangling it as it were—the two ever-present branches of the New World Order keeping Mankind under control: one, the political side, and the other, the religious side of control.
Some people are convinced that we have more DNA strands coming to complete our “ageless body” ascended forms. This is true to some extent, and indeed there are some Beings on the planet now who are in possession of their full complement of 12-stranded DNA, but they are rare among the many, and now they are almost anomalies. The rest of the world is stuck with two-stranded DNA unless they make the choices that are needed to ascend. The ascension process is not automatic for everyone. This shall be taken up later.
According to Sitchin’s work, Adam was created in the AB.ZU (in Africa) for the mining purposes, and then taken back to ED.IN (to Mesopotamia) to serve in other menial ways.
The Bible does not say where Adam was created, but it does refer to him being brought to Eden. Other ancient texts say he was brought from where he was created ‘Eastward’ to where “Elohim planted a garden in Eden.”
“And Yahweh Elohim took the Adam
And placed him in the Garden of Eden
To till it and to keep it.”
And when they were finally kicked out of Eden, it was to “the land of their creation” in East Africa (the Abzu) that they returned.
The Annunaki are a blue-skinned, metallic-biology, reptilian race as explained before, blue because of their copper-based blood, the copper giving it a bluish color rather than red. Although we tend to think of our own blood as being red, it is in fact blue as well when it is in our systems—note the bluish color of varicose veins, or those visible close to the skin. The red color only appears when the blood is exposed to air, or fully oxygenated as in the arterial system—something we might think of as an oxidation process of the iron content in the blood. The iron content of the blood comes from



59
the earth or the humans, the copper content from the Annunaki. The importance of iron in the woman’s system is that it helps them resonate with the Earth, keeps them more grounded as it were. Thus when they are low in iron they are likely to be more emotionally unstable. Iron? Copper? Do we not also seem metallic in our biology sometimes?
As Mankind keeps distancing itself from the days of its creation as a Lulu, a “mixed” being who carried the genetic heritage of both the Earth and the heavens, the shortening of its average life span might be seen as a symptom of the minute loss, from generation to generation, of what some consider ‘divine’ elements and the increasing preponderance of the “animal within us.” The existence in our genetic makeup of what some call ‘nonsense’ or ‘junk’ DNA—segments of DNA that seem to have lost their purpose—is an apparent leftover from the original ‘mixing.’ The two independent, though connected, parts of the brain—one more primitive and emotional, the other newer and more rational—are another attestation to the mixed genetic origin of Mankind, the most primal brain being known even in science as ‘the reptilian’ brain.
In the Hindu creation stories or hymns known as the Rig Veda that date from at least the second millennium BCE, the body of the primordial man, Purusha, is dismembered to provide material for the world and everything in it. Vishnu, one of the Hindu Trinity is depicted as dark blue or black. The Rig Veda contains the earliest known versions of the Indian (Hindu) creation myths and is the most sacred book of Hinduism.
At first, as Ramtha explains, the “Mixed Ones” as they were first produced, could not procreate. The Homo sapiens sapiens and the Neanderthal were not genetically compatible. Originally, Annunaki females, “birthing goddesses,” were used to ‘incubate’ the new creations, but since this was a slow process, it was decided to give the Adam the power to procreate. And this brings about the story of Eve.
Eve’s creation was another feat of genetic engineering by Enki and his assistants, but when it was accomplished, the Annunaki had a slave race that could then procreate and “go forth and multiply” all on their own without all the tiresome bother and work in the birthing laboratories of the Annunaki. It was the great Sumerologist Samual N. Kramer who first pointed out that her name, Eve, which meant in Hebrew “She who has life,” and the tale of her origin from Adam’s rib, in all probability stemmed from the Sumerian play on the word TI, which meant both “life” and “rib.”
While science suggests that, through mitochondrial research, a common mother, “Eve,” existed in Africa about 250,000 years ago, and expanded that to “include” an Adam circa 270,000 years ago, Sitchin’s figures, allowing 3600 years for one Annunaki SAR, places Adam’s creation 112,360 years ago. Neither are totally correct, remembering that Man was on the planet for a long time, but it was only 50,000 years ago that the Annunaki succeeded in their creation of the less primitive worker and his mate, homo sapiens sapiens—those we refer to here as the Adam and the Eve. Although these figures might not mesh with some translations of the Sumerian texts, they are the true figures and should rightfully be known.
The Temples
Although temple technology was not invented by the Annunaki, they were at least very knowledgeable and proficient in it. Originally, the temples created by the Annunaki were, as Sitchin attests, the literal “House of God,” the place where the gods resided. Temples were built all over the place, not dedicated to each one of the particular ‘gods’ for worship, but to literally house them.



60
Earth was still fourth dimensional at the time and Man could still actually ‘walk and talk’ with the gods. Taking exact measurements from tablets and The Bible, Von Daniken and others have shown that the temples built by the Annunaki were designed to house or ‘garage’ the personal flying vehicles of each one of these alien ‘lords’.
Temples were built with certain alignments to promote optimum energy flow, just as was true of the Atlantean temples. The Ziggurat styling was used for its pyramidal power ability to promote health and longevity.
A change came, however, after the creation of Adam and, especially of Eve, for it was not long before the young Annunaki, short of female companionship of their own, took to having sex with the daughters of Man since they were all of “the same first Seed of Life.” These then became the days referred to in the scriptures as “when the sons of God looked upon the daughters off men and saw them as being fair.”
“And it came to pass, /When the Earthlings began to increase/in number upon the face of the Earth,/and daughters were born unto them, and the sons of the Elohim/saw the daughters of the Earthlings,/that they were compatible./ And they took unto themselves/ wives of whichever they chose.
“The Nefilim were upon the Earth/in those days,/and thereafter too,/when the sons of the Elohim/cohabited with the daughters of the Adam/and they bore children to them.”
There is an essential translation difference here which Sitchin corrects—the use of the word ‘compatible’ for ‘fair.’ This was important for it was at this time that the Annunaki, driven by the loneliness of being so far from home for so long, desired to share the enjoyment they saw the humans having during procreation. While all the sources, including Sitchin speak of the Annunaki having sexual intercourse with the human females, there is one important factor each of them leaves out. The Annunaki did not possess sexual organs such as we have, and therefore were not initially able to partake of that kind of intimacy.
Adam was in fact created in the image of his maker, Enki, but that Adam was the one described by Ramtha as being created “without even having loins,” one who procreated through a process of cloning. This, indeed, was in the image of the Annunaki, for as all the sources confirm, sexual intercourse as we know it is not performed on any other planet, and especially not on those of the higher dimensions. While early Earthlings as they evolved had sexual organs similar to ours, they were a strictly biological process for procreation.
It was in Atlantis, in the dark days of the Sorcerer Kings, that sexual pleasure took on a new meaning and significance, and sex became a means of controlling the lesser inhabitants of the continent. Whenever any natural biological urge is withheld, it creates a stronger desire for the release of that energy, of that built-up tension inside. As many other nationalities who treat sex with less emphasis can confirm, in the United States sex is withheld more often than it is released. Advertising and subliminal marketing then use the thought of sexual release to stimulate buying as a placebo kind of sexual release from the tension built up by the accrued stimulation of all the images we see around us.
The Annunaki desired to participate. Using the technology they had used to create the Adam in the first place, the Annunaki found a way to participate. As in Atlantis, where size became important and bred in us an archetype of ‘size counts’, the Annunaki began the grafting or transplanting of



61
animal sexual organs onto their bodies and taking human females to their temples for sexual intimacy.
“The Nibiruans had been observing the sexual habits of humans and animals for thousands of years, and wondered what the experience felt like. They agreed with Adam(ah). A beautiful priestess was rubbed with oil and blessed with frankincense and myrrh, and she lay waiting on the bed in the very top of the Temple of Eridu. A great god came to her, and he made love to her with all the force of every man’s first sexual experience . . . the god was depressed, for he felt desire for the first time . . . he desired matter. He had lost his immortality, for he wanted to know matter as well as spirit.”
Thus they became compatible with the newly created female humans, although still unable to impregnate them. Eventually the few Annunaki females who were here also became jealous and arranged for their own sexual organs to be added. If this sounds far-fetched, ponder for a moment how far we have come in performing our own sex-change operations with increasingly greater success.
Virgins were, of course, preferable, and so the archetypes of temple virgins and ‘tightness’ were created. For the Annunaki female, as in this case with Inanna, it became a matter of “let him make it long for me.” It took a “big” man to satisfy a “giant” of a woman goddess. Those, such as Ninsun, had sexual relations with both gods and men in the GIGUNU—“the Chamber of Nighttime Pleasures.”
“In the past, when we Nibiruans were involved in actual gestation and birthing on Earth, we accomplished it through various implant procedures, interference in the womb, and even through gods who mated with human females.” (Clow)
It was only after another long time, and much more biological interference with their own reptilian-human blend, that the Annunaki became able to reproduce ‘physically’ with the Earth-born humans of either sex.
Temples became bordellos, brothels for the gods, forerunners of the harems which still exist in various areas of the world today, especially the Middle East. Some temples, such as the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, preserve this notion in their upstairs rooms with chandeliers and couches and even large beds in some, creating more the atmosphere of, indeed, a whorehouse. The importance and use of these temple rooms can be read about in Sitchin’s work where it is much more thoroughly detailed.
Although this practice was frowned upon by the Annunaki rulership in the beginning, eventually they gave in and found themselves participating as well. And with this change in the stature of the gods also came a greater shift in the vibration of the planet and the effects it had on the physiology of the aliens themselves.
This was the time when “there were giants upon the Earth, in those days and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them.” The word Nephilim is variously translated as ‘giants,’ or ‘watchers’, and ‘Earth-born’. In Genesis Chapter 6 it says the sons of God “took them wives of them that they chose.” Verse 4 says, “and they bore children unto them, the same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.” These were the lesser gods, the Demi-gods or Demi-urge immortalized in the much of the Greek and Roman mythology, and in other cultures around the world. The female goddesses also gave birth to half human/half god children:



62
“I was the first Nibiruan female to give birth to the child of an earth father. In fact, at the time this was the only way to ensure that the children of Nibiru would remain on Earth. Their Earth fathers would force them to remain and build families. Unfortunately, though, this need also created the patriarchy. And the patriarchy would later destroy the very Goddess culture that had created it.” (Clow)
Just as the Nine spoke of earlier, the denser vibration and the increased physicality of this planet traps all those who come to it with its pleasure, its pain, and its desire. As the Annunaki came and went, increasingly they got caught up in the power and this desire to mate with Earth women. Eventually they wanted to stay, despite losing some of their longevity. It trapped them just like it traps the Spirit within us all the time.
The demi-god children had long lives. They also had many of the powers and abilities of their Annunaki half, as well as retaining much of their multidimensional ability, though they also had many of the physical and emotional attributes of their human parent as well.
In The Epic of Gilgamesh, circa 2900 BC, Gilgamesh is one such demigod, his mother having been a full-fledged goddess he was therefore “two-thirds divine.” In the saga he decides to join the gods in the Afterlife (heaven as many people still think of it –‘up there in the sky’), since his godlike attributes should give him the right to immortality.
“When the gods created Mankind,” Shamash responded, “death for Mankind they allotted, life they retained in their own keeping.”
In this Epic piece we also see an example of Enki’s ability to create, and the close approximation he has with Mary Shelley’s Dr. Frankenstein. In the creation of Enkidu, Gilgamesh’s friend, Ninmah uses the “essence” of several gods and guided by Enki, created in the steppe a “savage man” with “copper sinews.” He was called Enki.Du –Enki’s “creature”– and given by Enki “wisdom and broad understanding” in addition to immense strength,” a kind of biological robot.
Gilgamesh was one such Demigod, and thirty such demigods are said to have preceded the Pharaohs in Egypt. Sumerian texts suggest that Adapa or Adam was the literal son of Ea with a human female. Enoch was possibly one of these demigods, and all six previous rulers before Enmeduranki were also Annunaki.
In the Book of Noah found among The Dead Sea Scrolls, Noah is described as having been unusual at birth – he was very, very white and also very red.
“I have begotten a strange son . . . resembling the sons of the God of Heaven . .it seems he is not sprung from me but from the angels,” said his father.”
When in Genesis 6:9 it speaks of Noah being “perfect in his generations” it refers to the fact that he still had very pure Annunaki blood, and that is why he was chosen to survive in the flood. One translation says that ‘pure genealogy’ means that he had no “physical” blemishes” in the genes, and as such was a worthy person to repopulate the Earth.
Many legends parallel in some form this creation story of humans by the Annunaki, for instance the Creation story of the Yao, a Bantu tribe of Mozambique. Their creation myths resemble those of other African peoples in that they stress the negative role of humankind in destroying the harmony of the natural world, going so far as to suggest that humans chased the gods away. Some of the Yao people say they emerged—birth-like—from a hole in the earth. Others say they were taken from the waters. It is of interest to note that, as in so many Native American creation stories, the creator of



63
this African myth is aided by an animal, in this case the reptile known as a chameleon (one which, symbolically, changes its look)
“In the beginning there was only the creator, Mulungu, and the animals until Chameleon found a tiny man and a tiny woman in his otherwise empty fish net. He took the net and strange creatures to Mulungu, who instructed Chameleon to let them go so they would grow—and grow they did.
“The new people learned to make fire, and often they terrified the animals by setting the forest on fire. They learned to hunt, and they killed and ate buffalo and other animals. As for the animals, they leaned to flee in horror from humans. Chameleon, for instance, fled into the trees. Mulungu was so disgusted that he asked the spider to spin a rope so he could escape to the heavens. Mulungu and all the gods stay away now.” (Source: Leach, 143)
The concept of the dragon in Celtic mythology shows a direct relationship to the Annunaki, having emerged, as it did, from the holy crocodile of the ancient Egyptians. The anointing of the king was an Egyptian custom, inherited even more anciently from Sumer in Mesopotamia, and constituted the privileged duty of the Pharaoh’s semi-divine sister-brides. Crocodile fat was the substance used in anointing because it was associated with sexual prowess. Indeed, the word for ‘crocodile’ in Egyptian was messeh, which corresponds to the Hebrew word Messiah – ‘Anointed One’. It was preferred that the Pharaohs married their sisters because true dynastic inheritance was held through the female line. This is due to the fact that it was through the original female side of the Orion-Sirian pact that the reptilian blood was passed on. The same idea is now carried on as well in the Jewish line and certainly in many lines of royalty and of power.
In China, as on every continent of the world, the dragon chiefly represents the principle of fertility. The legend of the dragon, both in Britain and in China, illustrates the cycle of fertility. The dragon is born from an egg beneath the water. It grows rapidly, devouring everything within its reach. Finally it is killed by its appointed executioner.
Every aspect of the dragon’s life is represented in stories, songs and dances. The stages of its seasonal growth are celebrated all over the world in rites and festivals which reach their climax at the beginning of winter in the processions that mark the ceremonial dragon’s death.
Much like the crocodile or dragon, the Annunaki on their own planet also have eggs:
“On Nibiru for thousands of years, gestation was accomplished with fertile eggs that we put in receptacles—Holy Grails—after gathering them during sacred sexual ceremonies in our temples on Earth. To us each goddess is an individual receptacle for birthing, and each fertilized egg that we gather is precious to us. Your women are fertile and sex is wonderful with them. We have used you in such a powerful way without your total agreement that deep inside you believe you do not control your own fertility, your most basic right. You do not take responsibility for your birthing.” (Clow)
While male Annunaki were able to produce ‘offspring’ with female human beings, the female Annunaki, however, still produced eggs with their male human lovers. Thus again the importance placed on the female side of the bloodline, it being still the ‘true’ way of birthing on their home planet.
Indeed the archetype of this sexual abuse by the gods is one of the strongest archetypes we have. The violence against women today shows this. It stems not only from our Cosmic Parents, but also from those who have used us down through the centuries, man and woman alike for sexual experimentation, and simply as instruments of their own pleasure. As Barbara Clow says:



64
“ . . . There is much energy that needs to be cleared about sexual abuse on Earth, and no one will really be free until this is done . . . but abuse is all the same. It occurs when we cease to control ourselves and become blinded to everyone else. If we are “nice” people in this life, then that uncontrolled aspect of our past lives is the part we keep the most deeply hidden. However, this repository of guilt also keeps us separate from others. By not being able to love all that we have ever been, we can’t be who we are now, in the present.”
“And as they returned it got to the point where all the male gods wanted to mate with Earth priestesses because they had found out about the power of sexual desire . . . Hundreds of gods came to Earth in small spaceships and mated with priestesses in the temples . . . But then the gods started mating with animals. The Nibiruans did not see much of a difference between animals and women in terms of the physical effects experienced during intercourse.”
Chapter 13 THE ANNUNAKI AND THE TREE OF CREATION
From the Gnostic fragment, Cain and Abel:
“And the first ruler saw the female virgin standing with Adam, and saw that the living, luminous afterthought had been shown forth within her. And Aldabaoth became filled with lack of acquaintance. Now, the forethought of the entirety learned of this, and sent certain beings, who caught life (Zoë) out of Eve. And the first ruler defiled her, and begot on her two sons—the first and the second, Eloim and Iaue. Eloim has the face of a bear; Iaue, the face of a cat. One is just, the other is unjust: Iaue is just, Eloim is unjust. It established Iaue in charge of fire and wind, and established Eloim in charge of water and earth. And it called them by the names Cain and Abel, with trickery in mind. . .
“And to the present day sexual intercourse, which originated from the first ruler, has remained. And in the female who belonged to Adam it sowed a seed of desire; and by sexual intercourse it raised up birth in the image of the bodies. And it supplied them some of its counterfeit spirit. And it established the two rulers in charge of realms, so that they ruled over the cave.”
Gnostic Scriptures such as the one above, describe how Eve was ‘raped’ as it were by the serpent in order to bear Cain and Abel, and even supplied her with some of his ‘evil’ or “counterfeit spirit.” Many aspects of the Sumerian texts also suggest that it was Enki who was physically intimate with his creation. In the Bible version it specifies that Eve had help from “the Lord” with her first two sons, Cain and Abel; and with their third son, Seth, it was Adam who became the father of “a” son, who was at last in his father’s likeness:
Genesis: 4:1 “. . . and she bore Cain saying. “I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord. And again, she bore his brother Abel . . .
Genesis 5: 3 “When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.”
According to the Gnostic scriptures, the importance of Cain was that he was directly produced by Enki and Kâva, so his blood was three-quarters Annunaki, while his half-brothers, Hevel and Satânael (better known as Abel and Seth), were less than half Annunaki, being the offspring of



65
Atâbba and Kâva (Adam and Eve). Cain's Annunaki blood was so advanced that it was said that his brother Abel's blood was earthbound by comparison. It was related in the scriptures that Cain 'rose far above Abel', so that his brother's blood was swallowed into the ground - but this original description was thoroughly misinterpreted for the modern Bible, which now claims that Cain 'rose up against Abel' and spilled his blood upon the ground. This is not the same thing at all.
In truth, Adam and Eve as the creation of these gods were two races of people, and not specific individuals—the adama and the evee. Thus the first race of people that were sired through ‘eve’ was bred by the gods from artificial insemination and not by physical sexual means. This led to the sons Cain and Abel being genetically altered to fit the Annunaki’s needs and not randomly accessed genetically as would be typical of a human birth. Eloim/Cain “had the face of a bear” making him black; “Iaue, the face of a cat” –a Persian cat –making him white.
This occurred 230,000 years ago during the first experimentation of Enki to create a worker race. This is the time as stated when mitochondrial research has found that ‘all races’ seemed to have stemmed from the one common mother –‘Eve’.
“The earliest true human being in Africa, Homo sapiens, dates from more than 200,000 years ago. A hunter-gatherer capable of making crude stone tools, Homo sapiens banded together with others to form nomadic groups; eventually these nomadic San peoples spread throughout the African continent. Distinct races date from approximately 10,000 BC. Gradually a growing Negroid population which had mastered animal domestication and agriculture forced the San groups into the less hospitable areas.” (Encarta)
Cain killed Able because they were different, one black and one white (as was said Noah was ‘very white’ to the point of being albino). Cain indeed was the black son of Adam and Eve— the black race of offspring as suggested by the Mormon religion who have always looked upon being black as the Mark of Cain. Abel was the white son, the white offspring as it were. A war broke out between the two races and for the first time as humans of a common origin on this planet, post-Annunaki–-a war was fought between these two races.
Now look at the two italicized sections of these quotes only in reverse order: “And it supplied them some of its counterfeit spirit . . . with trickery in mind.” And the trickery caused by these alien gods was to breed jealousy and prejudice between the two races that they might always be at war with each other—‘divide and conquer”—a way to make sure that the gods could always remain in power against the warring races.
When we use the term ‘black’ here, “it is of the darkness of skin that might be found among many Middle Eastern tribes, rather then the blackness of the African negroid skin,” say the Nine.
Mormons are very strict in having their followers research their genealogy. At one time if you had the blood of Cain you could not be baptized into the Mormon Church. For the longest time, blacks were not accepted at all. Now, in places such as Brazil where the Mormon religion is spreading so quickly, it is asked of new members to prove their genealogy three lines back in order to even qualify. If they had any black blood in them they were not allowed to be baptized.
“Yahweh paid heed unto Abel and his offering; Unto Cain and his offering He paid no heed. So Cain was very resentful”



66
The race of Cain was a race of farmers; the race of Abel was a race of sheepherders. The Annunaki being as much meat-eater as anything else while here on Earth, they preferred the race of Abel’s offering of meat over the race of Cain’s offering of grain. Hence the archetype of ‘flesh’ sacrifices that persisted from then on. This created great jealousy in the race of Cain, and began the wars between the two.
“Cain came upon his brother Abel and killed him . . . So Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that whoever shall find him should not smite him.”
As much as the physical attribute of black skin, the Mark of Cain was also symbolic of an emotional attitude, an archetype of jealousy and victimization. The race of Cain then moved in its entirety to the land of Nod, and their multiplied by mixing with the other races of the area. And thus began the reign of Homo sapiens, the origins of modern man.
Although grains were not yet grown, and domesticated animals were not yet kept in that area, the Annunaki were able to create many such things, as well as some that were brought from their home planet, in what they called their “creation chamber,” an important link to some of our future studies in this book.
“Enki and Enlil go to the DU.KU, the “purification place” the “creation chamber of the gods,” and brought forth Lahar (wooly cattle) and Anshan (grains) – the two fought over the approval of the gods –Enlil and Enki found the farmers the more surpassable . . .”
In the Gnostic Scripture, The Book of Adam and Eve, Eve has a dream in which she sees “the blood of Abel being poured into the mouth of Cain his brother,” and so they make for each of them separate dwellings—a separate city for each of the tribes. But with no effect. The war takes place. Adam and Eve then have a replacement tribe, Sheth (Seth - meaning “replacement”) to carry on the work of Cain and Abel. Adam dies and relates his being taken up to a chariot of fire (spaceship) similar to the journey Enoch takes, and Adam too sees “the burning face of god.”
The mark by which Cain could be distinguished from the other children of Adam was his black skin. Noah, as a literal child of the gods, was born with very, very white skin. Cain and his descendants lived separately from the other descendants of Adam.
The struggle between Cain and Abel is obviously archetypal in many many ways, not just simply because of the problems that have existed between the two races due to the color of their skins. This story of brothers at war also stems back to the cosmic archetype of ARTOLA and Lucifer, the two ‘sons’ of Enjliou and Callia, the Cosmic Parents. Certainly within some people’s consciousnesses, as reflected in the Mormon attitude, the darkness of the skin is equated with the dark forces, the white skin with the Light of God. Archetypally this would be the Light of the FATHER and of ARTOLA against Lucifer’s Darkness. The color of a person’s skin, however, has nothing to do with the alignment of a person’s Soul.
With regard to the archetypes of Cain and Abel, Joseph and his brothers, Jacob and Esau, and the prodigal son, we are all prodigal sons. The prodigal son is the one who leaves the home, spends all his inheritance, but comes back humbly to be accepted again by the Father. The other brothers who stayed and worked hard are jealous, and get angry and complain. The Father’s response is to say that this is his son who he loves dearly—in effect, he loves him unconditionally and is glad to have him home.



67
If we could all keep this in mind every moment of our lives, life would be so much different. The FATHER does not judge us; all HE wants is to see us safely home.
Noah
One of the Mesopotamian versions of the events leading to the Deluge is the text known by its opening words, “When the gods like men” . . . .The tale relates how Anu, the ruler of Nibiru (the captain of the Mothership?), returned from a visit to Earth after arranging a division of powers and territories on Earth between his feuding sons, the half-brothers Enlil (“Lord of the Command”) and Enki (“Lord of the Earth”). In his final decision, Anu puts Enki in charge of the gold-mining operations in Africa, and Enlil in charge of the refining operations and the spaceport in what is now the Middle East. After describing the hard work of the Annunaki assigned to the mines, their mutiny, and the ensuing creation through genetic engineering by Enki and his half sister Ninsirhag of the Adamu, a “Primitive Worker,” the epic relates how Mankind began to procreate and multiply. In time, Mankind began to upset Enlil by its excessive “conjugations,” especially with the Annunaki (a situation reflected in the biblical version of the Deluge tale); and Enlil prevailed on the Great Annunaki in their Council to use the foreseen catastrophe of the coming avalanche of water to wipe Mankind off the face of the Earth.
Enki, though he joined in swearing to keep the decision a secret from Mankind, was not happy with the decision and sought ways to frustrate it. He chooses to achieve this through the intermediary of Atra-Hasis (“he who is exceedingly wise”), a son of Enki by a human mother—a confirmation that Noah was indeed a child of the gods. The text, which at times assumes a biographical style by AtraHasis himself, quotes him as saying: “I am Atra-Hasis; I lived in the temple of Enki my lord”—a statement which clearly establishes the existence of a temple in those remote pre-Diluvial times, as well as its purpose for housing the gods and their guests, not as a place of worship.
Describing the worsening climactic conditions on the one hand and Enlil’s harsh measures against Mankind on the other hand in the period preceding the Deluge, the text quotes Enki’s advice to the people through Atra-Hasis how to protest against Enlil’s decrees: the worship of the gods should stop!
“Enki opened his mouth and addressed his servant,” saying thus to him: The elders, on a sign, Summon to the House of Council. Let heralds proclaim a command Loudly throughout the land: Do not reverence your gods, Do not pray to your goddesses.”
As the situation grows worse and the catastrophe day nears, Atra-Hasis persists in his intercession with his god Enki. “In the temple of his god . . . he set foot . . . every day he wept, bringing oblations in the morning,” seeking Enki’s help to avert Mankind’s demise “he called by the name of his god”—words that employ the same terminology as in the above-quoted verse of the Bible. In the end Enki decides to subvert the decision of the Council of the Annunaki by summoning Atra-Hasis to the temple and speaking to him from behind a screen. This event is commemorated on a Sumerian cylinder seal showing Enki giving him instructions for the building of a submersible boat that would withstand the avalanche of water. Enki advises Atra-Hasis to lose no time, for he has only



68
seven days left before the catastrophe happens. To make sure that Atra-Hasis wastes no time Enki puts into motion a clock-like device:
“He opened the water clock And filled it; The coming of the flood on the seventh night He marked off for him.”
This little-noticed bit of information reveals that time was kept in the temples and that timekeeping goes back to the earliest, even pre-Diluvial, times. More than that, this story also shows that the Annunaki were able to and did keep track of the earth’s frequency—the Schumann Resonance with which various people are now forecasting the coming of the planet back into the 5th dimension.
In the same story as told in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a Babylonian named Utnapishtim was approached by Prince Ea who opposed the decision to destroy his creation, Homo Sapiens. Ea told Utnapishtim that the other Gods planned to cause a deluge to wipe out the human race. Ea, who is described in other writings as a master shipbuilder and sailor, gives Utnapishtim instructions on how to build a boat which would survive the flood. Utnapishtim following Ea’s directions and with the help of friends completes the vessel before the flooding begins. Utnapishtim then loads the boat with his gold, his family, and his livestock, along with craftsmen and wild animals, and hoists off to sea.
The feat of building an Ark in seven days is nothing when compared with some of the other accomplishments that these Beings were capable of. Consider, for instance, Gilgamesh and Enkidu’s arrival at Baalbek in Lebanon, what many think was the actual spaceport at which the Annunaki’s craft landed and took off. Firstly it was guarded by what was probably an electric force field: “. . . an unseen force (that) through him back, and for twelve days he lay paralyzed.”
The platform itself was awe-inspiring, built of immense stones laid out, some five million square feet in area resting upon massive stone blocks that weigh hundreds of tons. Three stone blocks weighing more than a thousand tons each and known as the Trilithons were quarried in a valley miles away where one of these colossal stones still sticks out of the ground today. Not even in modern times is there equipment that can lift such a weight; yet in bygone days the Annunaki moved them and placed them with great precision. Baalbek became a sacred site to the Romans, the Greeks, and to the Canaanites, and temple upon temple was built atop the original platform. In the Moscow Literary Gazette of February 1960, Professor Agrest, Doctor of physical-mathematics, gave his opinion that it is not inconceivable that it may be the remains of a landing-ground constructed by astronauts arriving from the Cosmos.
The Bible says that the total time of the Patriarchs from Adam to Noah and the flood was 1,656 years. Sitchin figures, however, that Noah was born some 49,000 years ago using 3600 year SARs, which would place the creation of Adam and Eve considerably before that time. This is not correct.
The Flood
In the Atra-Hasis, the Mesopotamian version of Noah, the deluge was preceded by a long period of worsening climate. Increasing cold, reduced precipitation, and failing crops. In the Epic of Gilgamesh also adds that it was not the living animals that were taken aboard the Ark—it was their
seed that was preserved: “Aboard the ship take thou the seed of all living things,” most of which were already in storage for the Annunaki’s use in propagation and genetic experiments.



69
The catastrophe began with a rush of “wind from the south” followed by “a watery wave from the south.” Science magazine of January, 15, 1993 recreates what this might have looked like:
“. . It was a cataclysmic flood whose waters, rushing at the rate of 650 million cubic feet per second broke through in a 1500-foot-high wave. Coming from the south . . .and could indeed have overwhelmed all the area’s mountains.”
As Sitchin correctly surmises, this is the time directly after the Flood when Antarctica was clear of its ice-pack for the first time in eons, a time when the maps showing the details of an ice-free Antarctica were made, and which later became available during the 14th and 15th centuries in Europe around the time of Columbus.
Rivalries continued between the two half-brothers, Enki and Enlil. Enlil voting to let the humans be destroyed, Enki going out of his way to save them—at least some of them, by informing Noah of the coming disaster. The fact that they were willing to let their creation die, if not will it to die, again is reminiscent of the desire of Dr. Frankenstein to destroy his own creation.
Noah and his wife, because of Noah’s descent from the gods, “shall be like gods unto us” and were saved, along with his family and others who helped build the Ark.
The story of Genesis relates to us that the people were suddenly punished in the Tower of Babel incident because of a very strange transgression. This transgression turns out to be that they all spoke the same language. ‘God’ therefore decides to confuse their language. ‘God’ also decides to let man be erased from the face of the Earth because Enki gets upset over the fact that Mankind is excessively “conjugating,” especially with the Annunaki—his own men mating with the daughters of men, for this is primarily what was going on. When we realize how few Annunaki there were on the planet at that time compared with how many worker-slaves were being born, the problem becomes obvious. This is a problem many countries have faced throughout history and currently face todaythe influx of too many migrants who reproduce faster than the original race. Rather than see themselves so heavily outnumbered and the proliferating slaves causing trouble such as Rome had with Spartacus, Enlil would have wiped the Earth clean of human Beings.
In both instances, it was not only the jealousy or whatever it was that Enlil felt toward Mankind and the Annunaki males and even females. There was also the fact that he knew what was causing the more rapid descension of the planet into the 3rd dimension. He could see his people getting caught up in the ‘dense physicality’ which traps all who come here, as spoken of by the Nine. These were the same kind of aberrations going on in Atlantis at this time that helped bring about its decline as well—a lower astral or 4th dimension that the world was passing through and has been again recently on its way back up Jacob’s ladder of the dimensions.
A planet’s vibration and cycle through the varying dimensions is not only a natural cycle of time and progress, but it also is a reflection of the consciousness of those existing upon it. As the vibrations of the behavior on the planet decreased, so too did the planet’s own vibration, eventually making the final shift into 3rd gear –the third dimension we have been in for the past 11, 000 or so years.
And thus came the Fall of Man again, symbolic of the fall of the entire planet into the 3rd dimension:



70
“. . . My heart chakra has not been fully empowered since the fall of Atlantis, nor has yours. When Atlantis fell, all beings who lived here began to experience the planet from a limited, thirddimensional point of view . . . it was necessary for your chakras to be closed down; otherwise you would have remained multidimensional and never have fully materialized here.” (Clow)
It was not an overnight process, as has been said before, but when the final time came the Flood wiped the face of the Earth clean except for Noah and the Ark, and those who survived on the mountaintops of various places scattered around the planet.
The Flood, however, was not just a lot of water. Just as scientists studying Pterodactyls say they could not have flown unless the atmospheric pressure was twice what it is today, so the atmospheric pressure changed as the dimensions lowered.
It was almost a knockout blow to the human race on Earth. The Annunaki had foreseen it coming since they had their ‘watchers’ stationed in the skies overhead, but the Nibiruan hierarchy were displeased with the effect this whole mating thing had had upon their own people, and were ‘happy’ to see the destruction of the human race.
“Enlil viewed these developments with rising apprehension. The original purpose of coming to earth, the sense of mission, the dedication to the task—were dissipated and gone. The good life seemed to be the main concern of the Annunaki—and with a race of hybrids to boot!”
Because of their role in ‘seducing’ the gods into having sex with them, women would then be blamed in Man’s subconscious for the Flood, for the destruction of much of the life on Earth, and even for ‘scaring’ away the gods. This blame would be written into the Bible as Eve being tempted by the serpent and then in turn tempting Adam to partake of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in mating with Annunaki females, thus causing the Fall. Herein sex with the gods truly was the Knowledge of Good and Evil, only the Fall was the fall in consciousness of humans, and woman had no more to do with it than did the gods themselves, or likewise Adam for that matter.
As Sitchin translates the story of the Flood from the Sumerian texts, the Flood was created by the arrival of Nibiru near planet Earth on its orbit around the sun. This is only partially true. The disaster was almost purely a natural force, although the events taking place on Earth only served to speed up the process of lowering the planet into the 3rd dimension. The Annunaki had felt the effects coming long before the flood, especially on their own bodies which had speeded up the aging process.
But after the Flood they were dealing with a whole new dimension, literally.
After the Fall
After the flood there were not that many people left inhabiting the Earth, not that many survived. Everything went back to a state of primitiveness as had not been seen on the planet for many thousands and thousands of years. It was like wiping the slate clean in order to begin again, and this is the way it was symbolically translated. The consciousness of much of civilization was lost as man struggled to stay alive in the primitive circumstances in which he found himself existing. As Churchward suggests, civilization led to savagery, not the other way around.
It took much time to get things going again. The Annunaki and other star nations helped with the reimprinting of the human race who survived, otherwise it would have taken many hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of years to rebuild the peoples of the Earth to where the race had been prior to the Flood. Still, there was not a desire among the spiritual hierarchy to rebuild Mankind to the



71
level of the Atlantean stage again, for it had grown to a place where Atlantis was about to destroy the planet and perhaps a large part of the solar system with its experiments in nuclear and merkaba crystal energies. The Annunaki had mated with the animals prior to this time, and there were able to be mixed breeds of creature upon the planet to whom soul would not stick—these were the soulless ones often written about in channeled materials. There was a necessity for these to be destroyed so that the whole of creation would not be fouled by their presence on the planet.
No there was not another flood of 6,000 years ago as some suggest– it was in the time around 9,000 BC as Edgar Cayce and others rightly confirm. All records of that time prior to the flood have been erased as it were, although many will again come to light as the Sphinx and the Pyramids are able to share their secrets.
What was left of mankind rebuilt slowly, and that is why we have the emergence of the ‘first’ civilizations in Sumeria in the 6th millennium BCE, 3,000 years after the destruction of the Flood. Man’s memory had been wiped clean in many ways, but from the earliest days Man knew that his creators had come from the heavens—Annunaki he called them, literally “Those who from Heaven to Earth Came.” Their true abode was in the heavens, Man always knew: “Our Father, who art in Heaven”.
But those of the Annunaki who had come and stayed on Earth, Man also knew, could be worshipped in the temples, the literal old ‘homes’ of the gods.
It was at this time around the rise of civilization in Sumeria that the Sumerian King Lists describe kingship as being lowered from the heaven: “. . . after the Flood had swept over the Earth, when Kingship was lowered from heaven. . .” With the gods now living on a different dimensional level, things indeed needed to be lowered from heaven from the 4th dimension where the gods resided to the 3rd dimension on which lived the humans.
As Sitchin correctly states, some of Mankind’s accomplishments seem to go in 3,600 year increments, though accurate dating is difficult. This is precisely because the alignments which allow the Annunaki to travel to and from their true home planet happened every 3,600 years. Even after the Fall, the Annunaki still needed the use of wormholes to travel the great distances across space from the constellation of Taurus to planet Earth. But as the Flood became a distant memory, so too did the gods, becoming only myths and legends because they were no longer present ‘physically’ as they had been in the olden days.
Mankind’s advancements that we call the progress from Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) to Mesolithic, and Neolithic (Middle and New Stone ages) to the sudden Sumerian civilization –each span approximately a 3,600 year interval:
• The oldest identifiable cultures are those of the Old Stone, or Paleolithic, Age (50,000 BC8000 BC)—the time before the Flood. These cultures left to posterity a rich artistic heritage of paintings on cave walls; the most famous of these cave paintings are at Lascaux in the Dordogne region of southwestern France, which include those of UFOs.
• The Middle Stone or Mesolithic Age (8000-4000 BC) people were food gatherers like their ancestors but left relatively few remains. Immediately after the Flood when Man was thrown back on simple ways just to be able to survive.
• The peasants of the New Stone (Neolithic) Age (4000 BC-2000 BC), on the other hand, left several thousand remarkable stone monuments in France, including the menhirs in



72
Bretagne, the statue-menhirs of southern France, and the dolmens, or chamber tombs, of the Loire Valley, the Parisian Basin, and Champagne.
• More sophisticated cultures emerged in the Bronze Age (2000-800 BC) and the Iron Age (8th-2nd century BC), but by then a new god had taken over—a new god for a new age.
After the Floods, as the temples were rebuilt, “the gods retreated to sacred precincts, and to the step-pyramids (ziggurats) at whose center was the ‘E’ (literally: House, abode) of the god.” In addition to the Spaceport and the guidance facilities, there was also a need after the Deluge for a new Mission Control Center to replace the one that had existed before in Nippur. Sitchin, in his book Stairway to Heaven, shows the need to equidistance this center from the other space-related facilities which then dictated its being located on Mount Moriah (“The Mount of Directing”), the future site of the city of Jerusalem, the future site of the Temple of Solomon, and also the future site of the El Aqsa Mosque holy to Islam.
The focus of the temples also became different at this time, for no longer were the gods there ‘in person’ to walk and talk with. The gods were still 4th dimensional while the Earth plane was now 3rd dimensional. Just as we now cannot see the 4th dimensional beings known as ghosts or astral entities unless we are psychically gifted, so too could ordinary man now not see the gods their ancestors had once been able to see. Instead, other forms of communication became necessary. Man and his gods met in the temples, but in a different way, and the knowledge and rituals and beliefs that resulted are now called Religion.
The gods left and the priestesses burned eternal fires at their altars, waiting for the next return (the symbolic ‘candle in the window’ and ‘the woman waiting for her man to return’ archetypes). Instead of existing in present bliss Man waited for a return and the possibility of that return became less and less real to each succeeding generation. It did set up an archetype of waiting for the gods, or God, to return which we still carry with us today.
Enoch, born of a priestess who received a god, continued the lineage of the elect, of the demigods, the blue-bloods of the Earth—half Nibiruan, half Earthling. Enoch is said to have lived a thousand years, a very Draconian age.
Temples were now built not as the literal ‘Houses of God’, but as houses of worship. Their construction was not supervised in person by the gods, but instead plans and models manifested out of thin air. In 2100 BC, in the City of Lagash, Gudea was ordered to build a temple. At first he saw it in a dream for dreams and visions are one way the 4th dimension still interacts with the 3rd dimension. Later, a model of it “fell into his lap,” much as the legends of things falling out of thin air have said. An angel also appeared holding a tablet of lapis lazuli and drew a plan for the temple on it. Even the kind of bricks to be used was ordained:
“He placed before me a holy carrying basket; upon it he placed a pure brick-making mold; the destined brick was inside it.”
As we should by now be able to see, temple technology is a very precise art form, just as is the Creation of a Universe—every piece playing a specific part within the whole, just as every individual Soul plays a specific part in the grander plan of the FATHER.
The desire of the gods for sex with the human females, however, had not diminished. The uppermost levels of the temples therefore now became ‘twilight zones’, an area where the 3rd and 4th dimensions met and mingled in order for the gods to be able to come again and have sex with the 3rd



73
dimensional women. The gods’ appointed women, the temple virgins or vestal virgins, were now kept in special houses adjoining the temple area. Virgins were chosen while young, and from the beginning their diet was watched, they were isolated from other polluting influences, they were guarded by eunuchs so there would be no temptation, and their degree of spirituality was carefully watched so their vibration could be kept high for their passage into this mixed dimensional world.
These traditions were kept, even after the gods had left, and in places such as South America, these virgins were brutally murdered after being forced to have sex with the priests, a stand-in for the gods in this horrible instance. Virgins of the temple were popular even in Jesus’ day, and his mother Mary was raised as a Temple Virgin by the Jewish Essenes sect, of whom both she and Joseph were members.
The Kumari peoples of Nepal still keep young girls from the age of four until puberty in the temples where they are worshipped and treated as goddesses.
When Kingship was transferred from Kish to Uruk at the beginning of the third millennium BC, Uruk consisted only of a sacred precinct, the Kullab. The Mormon Church teaches that god resides on a planet called Kolob, the planet named Kochab (Beta Ursa Minor) in the constellation of the Little Bear. This sacred precinct probably takes its name from exactly this planet which shall play a much larger role in our story towards its end.
There in the sacred precinct, the god was to sleep in the “harem” –the “Gipar” and they were to be given an “Entu” –“a chosen virgin” who later became a daughter of the king “a sacred maiden.”
With Inanna, the female goddess, she took over ‘the Chamber of Nighttime Pleasures’ and decided to build a city around her temple. To do this she needed the ME’s, those portable objects which held all the knowledge and other aspects of a high civilization, perhaps similar to pocket-sized computers or memory chips. To get them, she seduced Enki.
As an example of what went on between 4th dimensional aliens and 3rd dimensional humans, we have the tale of Inanna making love with two kings where it states:
He will live with Inanna Separated by a wall; (which later became a veil in temple ceremonies) I will live with Inanna In the lapis lazuli house in Aratta. (lapis lazuli was a crystal used to maintain a 4th dimensional status) He will gaze upon Inanna only in a dream; (how 4D beings would be seen in 3rd dimension) I will lie with her sweetly in an ornate bed. (the furnishings still provided in the top rooms of many temples)
Inanna gets Dumuzi, one of the kings, to “plow her.” He is a shepherd/king – his ”cream is good, his milk is bright.” She wants a farmer-god as a husband, rebelling against the old ways and creating an archetype of a ‘white’ woman wanting a black or dark-skinned lover as a rebellion against her peers: “I, the maiden, a farmer will marry, the farmer grows many plants, the farmer grows much grain.” Dumuzi gets killed by Marduk, and Inanna mourns. She turns the Gipar and its Gigunu into a place for a sexual rite known as the rite of Sacred Marriage (the hierogamous), which was still celebrated in the ancient Near East for almost 2,000 years, and still has it remnants in marriage ceremonies today.

Enoch tells that those of the senior number (the seven archangels) of Watchers were annoyed that the Chiefs of the tens had begun to teach their offspring too much too soon by imparting some of the secrets of the signs in earlier days. It was reported that they had taught about the metals of the Earth and how to use them; they taught about the roots of the Earth and their medicines; they taught about the sun, the moon and the constellations, and of clouds and weather patterns. The archangels were said to have admonished the chiefs of the Watchers for having ‘revealed the eternal secrets’ and for having thrown humankind into an internecine turmoil so that the pre-eminent sons of the Watchers were at variance with the evolutionary sons of men created through this ‘hierogamous’. (1 Enoch 8; 1-3, 8; 6). The alien knowledge conflicted with the earth genetics from the mothers of the children created through this ‘religious ceremony’.
This difference between the dimensional levels in the temples is also addressed in Barbara Clow’s work, firstly through the eyes of one of the Annunaki coming here to earth prior to the flood for that brief 200 or so year period during which the portals are open, then as a temple maiden entering a different dimension after the Fall:
1. “. . . Have you seen all the fine temples we’ve built on your planet? We must have your genetic material to continue our species when we are out in space, so we build firstclass hotels for our visits . . . We are the gods who come down to Earth, called by you people the Nephilim of the Hebrew Bible. We built your temples as places for impregnating Earth species with our seed.”
“When we actually visit your planet, we inhabit our temples for over 200 years. . . In that time we select your goddesses according to their genetic line, and they give birth to children from us. Some of the children choose to leave earth and travel with us, and some remain and seed new royal genetic strains. This is a fair exchange of genes. However, these experiences are also the source of your deepest wounds. This is why you hate to separate from one another to go on long journeys.”
2. “Like a zombie, I walk into another room in the temple, into another dimension . . . in its very center is the symbol of Atlantis as home on Earth: a pattern of three concentric rings . . . the lines in her body represent the web of life, the net of creation . . . it gives me the same sensation as travelling through the time tunnel that we use to access Earth. I am seeing how matter materializes in time.”
Astral or 4th dimensional eyes are able to see better and at greater distances than can physical eyes. Astral eyes can see through stone walls and can enable the body to see at distances that amaze the physical mind. Astral bodies can also pass through 3rd dimensional walls. This is what happened when the gods remained 4th dimensional and the humans became 3rd dimensional. They became ghost-like for a while before the density got too great.
The exact timing of the gods leaving the planet is suggested sheerly by coincidence by Jon Landseer, in a series of lectures delivered at the Royal Institute of Great Britain to the society of Antiquarians in 1822. Long before others, he asserted that the “Chaldeans” (ancient Ur) had known of the phenomenon of precession, millennia before the Greeks did. Calling those early times an era “when Astronomy was religion” and vice versa, he asserted that the calendar was related to the zodiacal “mansion” of the Bull, (home of the Annunaki’s own planet) and that the transition to Aries was associated with “a mystifying conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter in the sign of Aries, at the commencement of the great cycle of intricate [celestial] revolutions.” He believed that the Greek



75
myths and legends connecting Zeus/Jupiter with the Ram and its golden fleece reflected that transition into Aries. And he calculated that such a determining conjunction of Jupiter and the Sun in the boundary between Taurus and Aries had occurred in the year 2142 BC.
This is indeed the time of the planet when things began to change. For it is precisely at this time that the Annunaki ‘left’ the last time to catch the next wormhole home. The reason they left, however, is not as simple as ‘it was time to go home.’ Nor is it as simple as they got burned out on interdimensional sex, though this does bring up the real issue. We have already talked about how the density of this planet traps Soul here with its net of desire, and the endless pursuit of sexual fulfillment has degraded the vibration of the planet until it can really now go no lower. This is it, the bottom. But if you are a 4th dimensional Being continually lessening and depleting your own energies to be able to have sex with a 3rd dimensional partner, then you are getting yourself into serious trouble. If the two partners are not on the same frequency band or energy band, then it will lessen the higher energy.
The Annunaki were forever trying to maintain their status of ‘eternal life’, or what seems like it in the 4th dimensional status in which they lived. They were not going to let Man have eternal life, so they stripped him of his DNA that would have given him his rightful multidimensionality. It was the inter-dimensional sex that was pulling the higher dimensional beings—the fourth dimensional Annunaki—down into the third dimension. The Annunaki knew this, and that is why all the hierarchy of the Annunaki got so upset with their males for mating with the daughters of men – and even more so with the animals. It was a case of the old expression, ‘Don’t let them pull you down to their level.” So the choice became to lower with the planet into the 3rd dimension and stay on Earth, or to let humanity be destroyed in the coming Flood, because in doing so it would save them from temptation—“Lead us not into temptation.”
Instead of exercising a little self-control they were willing to let the population of the planet be wiped out for what were realistically ‘their sins’. It is an archetype which still exists from our creator parents—the gods. The Nine say that the one thing humanity needs to do right now is show a little self-control, and to begin taking responsibility for themselves and for their planet.
And the Annunaki got trapped in their decision. They helped save some of humanity and stayed around for another cycle, perhaps to help those who were left, but then as things got denser and denser on the planet, they knew they had to leave or ‘change’.
Anu set up the full-blown Annunaki temple/city complex on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers as a beautiful gift to humans. However, he did it out of competition and jealousy instead of as a giveaway, for this was the time of the rise of Egypt, ruled by the Sirian gods, and the Annunaki were jealous of the Sirian gods—their ‘betters’. Before they left, however, they arranged for three presents to remain behind them to take their place, one was kingship, the other was the priesthood, and the third shall remain a mystery for now.
The Nephilim and the sons of god are traditionally not one and the same thing; ‘sons of God’ and angels are used independently throughout the Bible, while the book of Job (1:6, 2:1) makes the point that when the sons of God presented themselves before the Lord, Satan was among them.
Joshua 24:2 Jehovah acknowledged that Abraham’s father ‘served other gods.’ The Jerusalem Bible: Jehovah at the Divine Assembly. Psalm 82:
Jehovah takes his stand at the Council of El



76
To deliver judgement among the elohim. (From verse 6) Ours too are gods, Sons of El Elyon, all of you.
In the Book of Enoch, the sons of god are the ‘watchers’, the same who mated with the earthly women. In Daniel the watchers are akin to the Nephilim.
Genesis 6:1-4 seems to be the nephilim separate from the sons of the gods who had the earth women.
Kingship was left by the gods, say the Sumerian tablets (although obviously not rulership). From the blue blood of the Annunaki’s and the offspring they sired, we got the concept of the ‘bluebloods,’ an expression still used today for those of noble birth. An interesting aspect of the word 'kingship' is that it was identical with kinship - and kin means 'blood-relative'.
“After the deluge . . . Kingship was instituted to create both a barrier and a link between the Annunaki and the mass of people,” says Sitchin, not realizing how much of a link they perhaps were.
In choosing the kingly successors, the Annunaki’s first choice were those humans who were of Annunaki descent, particularly those of the line of Abel, ‘the shepherds,’ fathered by perhaps Enki himself. And the idea of ‘the shepherds’, the bloodline of Abel and the gods, continued on through kingship in Sumer and Akkad, even unto the formation of Judaism, the New Testament, and beyond. Jesus himself is called ‘the Good Shepherd’.
“Seven gods laid its foundations. The city of Kish they traced out, And there the seven gods laid its foundation. A city they established, a dwelling place; But a Shepherd they withheld.”
The twelve rulers at Kish who had preceded Etana were not yet given the Sumerian royalpriestly title EN.SI—“Lordly Shepherd” or as some prefer “Righteous Shepherd.” The city, it appears, could attain this status only when the gods could find the right man to build a ziggurat stage-temple there through which to pass their rulership. Then, through this skill, he would become ‘a king-priest’ who would be given the title EN.SI. He would be “their builder,” the one to built the E.HURSAG.KALAMMA.
” . . . the gods asked—build the “House” (ziggurat) that shall be “Mountainhead for all the lands?”
The right of Solomon to build the temple in Jerusalem, the entire construct of the Masons and their temple-building and masonic-building symbolism, all stem from this ability to connect up to the gods on whatever level they resided, and not just to the Annunaki either, as we shall see. Those who are still chosen for leadership throughout the world in the modern era are most often drawn from the ranks of Freemasonry and other secret societies related to the New World Order conspiracy.
In this case, the ‘House’ or ‘Mountainhead’ that they refer to is a structure of control, a hierarchy or ‘pyramid’ that they could use to maintain their slave race in just the form they wanted. Thus the person selected was a ‘King-priest’, one and the same for ultimate control over every aspect of the peoples lives. For so long, the Ruler of a country was also the Head of the Church. The Queen of England today is still considered the head of the church known as the Church of England.



77
This was true until the time of the emergence of a separate leader for both the Church and the State. Even then they should be looked upon as only two branches of the same Tree, two pillars supporting the New World Order (Jachin and Boaz) of control much like the separation of society into scientists and artists back in the ancient days of Atlantis. The leaders of both branches should also be considered as the same in helping to fulfill this plan for the continued domination of the people.
The trouble caused by King Henry VIII of England in separating from Papal control and the Holy Roman (Catholic) Church was just another example of the two branches of the Tree struggling for ultimate control. Several times during the medieval period English kings had sought to limit the power of the church and the claims of its independent canon law, though with little success until the reign of Henry VIII.
A series of statutes enacted by the English Parliament between 1529 and 1536 denied the pope any power or jurisdiction over the Church of England. Henry thus reaffirmed the ancient right of the Christian prince, or monarch, to exercise supremacy over the affairs of the church within his domain. He cited precedents in the relations of church and state in the Eastern Roman Empire and until the 9th century under Charlemagne. Although his action was revolutionary, Henry VIII received the support of the overwhelming majority of Englishmen, clerical and lay alike. Support was given chiefly, however, because no drastic changes were made in the Catholic faith and practices to which England was accustomed. After Henry's death, the influences of religious reform were felt more strongly in England, and in 1549 the first Anglican Book of Common Prayer was published and its use required of the English clergy by an Act of Uniformity. The second prayer book, reflecting more strongly the influence of continental Protestantism was issued in 1552 and was followed shortly by the Forty-two Articles, a doctrinal statement similar in tone. Both were swept away upon the accession (1553) of Mary I, who returned England to a formal obedience to the papacy that lasted until her death in 1558.
It was only the special members of the bloodline of Abel (those of mixed alien-human genes sired by Enki and/or Enlil) who held the ability to be in contact with the gods to where they could derive the sacred knowledge of how to build a temple correctly. This was the full complement of DNA we now think of as 12-strand DNA. As Barbara Marciniak relates in her book Bringers of the Dawn:
“The original human was a magnificent being whose 12 strands of DNA were contributed by a variety of sentient civilizations. When the new owners [reptilians] came in, they worked in their laboratories and created versions of humans with a different DNA - the two stranded, double-helix DNA. They took the original DNA of the human species and disassembled it. The original DNA pattern was left within the human cells, yet it was not functional; it was split apart, unplugged.”
This idea is repeated in the choice of one specific tribe of Israel, the tribe of Aaron, to be the priest and to converse with god through the Ark of the Covenant. It was not until this ‘Shepherd’ was found that these sacred things could even be understood. Etana was the fist ‘King-priest’ selected.
A ‘beru’ was a unit for the measurement of length in Sumer (a ‘league”) and of time (one “double-hour,” the twelfth part of a daytime-nighttime period that we now divide into twenty-four hours). It remained a unit of measurement in astronomy where it denoted the twelfth part of the heavenly circle or arc. The tale of Etana uses this unit of measurement for distance, time, or arc, though other authors do not define which one is meant—not understanding that all three are carefully interrelated. What the text make clear is that at that remote time “when the first true Shepherd King



78
was enthroned in the first city of men, distance, time, and the heavens could also be measured”, all three having an equality of meaning if correctly calculated as they could in those days, and as trained mystery school initiates still can.
Things did not change even with the new god, Yahweh, in place. It still took a special person to be guided by god to build his temples and do his work. In Judea, circa 1000 BC, the circumstances surrounding the selection of a shepherd to be the builder of a new temple in a new royal capital emulated the events and circumstances recorded earlier in the Tale of Etana; and the same number seven, with a calendrical significance, also played a role.
The Judean city where the circumstances were repeated was Jerusalem. David, who was ‘shepherding’ the flocks of his father, Jesse the Bethlehemite, was chosen by the Lord for kingship. After the death of King Saul when David reigned in Hebron over the tribe of Judah alone, representatives of the other eleven tribes “came unto David in Hebron” and asked him to become king over them all, reminding him that Yahweh had earlier said thus to him: “You shall shepherd my people Israel and shall be a Nagid over Israel” (II Samuel 5:2). Thus David might more likely have been a leader over his father’s people rather than a true ‘shepherd’ of the sheep as such.
The term Nagid is usually translated “Captain (King James version), “Commander” (The New American Bible) or even “prince” (The New English Bible). None appear to have realized that Nagid is a Sumerian loanword, a term borrowed intact from the Sumerian language according to Sitchin, one in which the word really meant “herdsman!”
And ‘herding’ is exactly the right descriptive metaphor for what the king-priests, the kings, and the priests, have all done for their Lordly Masters since the days of the gods and after. In those days when the Annunaki stripped Man of his full DNA, they made him no better in their mind than the animals in the field. They then saw no difference between having sex with the temple virgins and the animals. Even today we still use the metaphor of ‘sheep’ for those who are easily led, and our priests and pastors use the word ‘flock’ for their congregations. The choice of the word ‘shepherd’ then as a synonym for ‘king’ was accurate and appropriate—they were people who would do the gods’ bidding and round up their sheep and keep them docile in the fields, especially since it was true that these lordly reptiles were also known occasionally to eat some of their ‘sheep’. The warning here is to beware of anyone who uses a particular reference that in any way likens you to a ‘sheep’. As the Nine suggest, “some come as wolves in sheep’s clothing.”
“Etana: O Shamash, you have enjoyed the best cuts of my sheep,” he said. “The soil has absorbed the blood of my lambs. I have honored the gods!”
Human sacrifice and animal sacrifice to the gods has become one and the same thing throughout the past millennia, one no better than the other in their reptilian eyes. Now we have genocide and human sacrifice, only on a grander scale.
Etana, the “strongman,” was selected for the position after “Ishtar was looking for a shepherd and searching high and low for a king” in the rebuilding process after the Flood. The one who was chosen ‘Shepherd’ king was awarded the tools that would allow them to keep in contact with their masters the gods in the 4th dimension—the orb, the scepter, the crown, even the throne itself— all the trappings of royalty, all made of gold (one of the best conductors of electricity), and all inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones such as diamonds and emeralds (such as the gods spoke through to lead their people), and lapis lazuli (the 4th dimensional stone)—all of which acted as



79
crystal receivers for the god’s commands from the higher dimension, as well as transmitters of the king’s thoughts and those of his surrounding subjects in return.
Similar precious stones were used by those who translated the word of god for the Hebrews. These were known as the Urim and Thummim that one put in a breastplate to be able to ‘hear’ the words of god. They are mentioned several times throughout the Bible. Joseph Smith said he used these same tools in order to translate the plates he was led to discover by the angel Moroni which then formed the basis for the Book of Mormon.
And indeed Abel’s offering was the best—meat for the reptiles, and like our creator parents we enjoy having our meat-eating genes even though our bodies are not always equipped to deal with it. The ancient Hebrew tribes then went on to sacrifice their lambs, taking the words literally most of the time.
Then Marduk, a demi-god mix of Nibiruan and Earthling genes, took over the supremacy on Earth, circa the year 2000 BCE. This is the time Clow says that the Nibiruans began “incarnating as humans (around 1600 BCE),” but it is more like the 2142 BCE era when they had to return home or stay.
“Abraham (was) sent from his birthplace in Ur carrying a small box with a glowing element inside it. . .This element came out of earth from deep, deep below Ur, where it had been deposited by the Nibiruans. That is the source of the word “Ur-anium.” It is time for you to notice how deeply encoded these words are—the place where the central control center of your creativity resides in your “cranium.” All the limitations and potential creativity in your world exist right in your languages. . . Ur was the Nibiruan capital selected by Anu for deposit of radiation. . . just follow the path of the Ark of the Covenant, built to contain the radiation in those days” (Clow).
The Book of the Wars of Yahweh records the “divine wars” that followed. Marduk expected that once the omens were clear, both gods and men would heed his call for accepting his supremacy without further resistance. “I called on the gods, all of them, to heed me,” Marduk wrote in his memoirs. “I called on the people along my march; bring your tribute to Babylon.” Instead, he encountered a scorched-earth policy: the gods in charge of cattle and grains left, “to heaven they went up,” and the god in charge of beer “made sick the heart of the land.” His advance turned violent and bloody. “Brother consumed brother, friends slew each other with the sword, corpses of people blocked the gates.” The land was laid waste and wild animals devoured people, packs of dogs bit people to death.
As Marduk’s followers continued their advance, the temples and shrines of other gods began to be desecrated. The greatest sacrilege was the defilement of Enki’s temple in Nippur, until then the venerated religious center of all the lands and all the peoples. When Enlil heard that even the Holy of Holies was not spared, that “in the holy of holies the veil was torn away” (the dimensional connection) he rushed back to Mesopotamia. He “set off a brilliance like lightening” as he came down from the skies; “riding in front of him were gods clothed with radiance.” Seeing what had happened, “Enlil evil against Babylon caused to be planned.” He ordered that Nabu be seized and brought before the Council of the Gods, and Ninurta and Nergal were given the assignment. But they found that Nabu had escaped from his temple in Borsippa, on the Euphratean border, to hide among his followers in Canaan and the Mediterranean islands.
When the air finally cleared, all of southern Mesopotamia lay prostrate. “The storm crushed the land, wiped out everything . . . No one treads the highways, no one seeks out the roads . . . On the



80
banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, only sickly plants grow . . . In the orchards and the gardens there is no new growth, quickly they waste away . . . On the steppes cattle large and small become scarce . . . The sheepfolds have been delivered to the Wind.”
Abraham’s mission to deliver the ‘Ur-anium’ was successful, and Sodom and Gomorrah were no longer the seats of learning they had once been, and the Dead Sea became truly dead—lying in the bottom of a great hole in the Earth. And once again nuclear destruction—the splitting of the Adam/Atum/Atom had caused destruction here on Earth.
The target of this nuclear blast was the temple to Sin (Shamash’s father) located in Sodom and Gomorrah. Sin simply meaning “without” as one referred to the Wilderness of Sin (Sinai) a place ‘without’ much of anything. Thus Sin became identified with what went on in Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah are portrayed in the Nag Hammadi texts, not as dens of wickedness, but as centers of great wisdom and learning.
Life only began to stir anew seven years later. But these ‘seven years of lean’ were enough to force the Israelites to move further from the destruction and on into Egypt.
Backed by Elamite and Gutian troops loyal to Ninurta, a semblance of organized society returned to Sumer under rulers seated in former provincial centers such as Isin and Larsa. It was
only after the passage of seventy years—the same interval that later applied to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem—that the temple in Nippur was restored. But the “gods who determine the destinies,” Anu and Enlil, saw no purpose in resurrecting the past. As Enlil had told Nannar/Sin who had appealed in behalf of Ur
“Ur was granted kingshipIt was not granted an eternal reign.”
Marduk had won out. Within a few decades, his vision of a king in Babylon who would grasp his hand, rebuild the city, raise high its ziggurat Esagil—had come true. After a halting start, the First Dynasty of Babylon attained the intended power and assurance that were expressed by Hammurabi:
Lofty Anu, lord of the gods Who from Heaven to Earth came, And Enlil, lord of heaven and Earth Who determines the destinies of the land, Determined for Marduk, the firstborn of Enki, The Enlil-functions over all mankind; Made him great among the gods who watch and see, Called Babylon by name to be exalted, Made it supreme in the world; And established for Marduk, in its midst, An everlasting kingship.”
In Mesopotamia, slowly but surely the ascendancy of the Age of the Ram was recognized by changes in the calendar and in the lists of the celestial stars. Such lists that used to begin with Taurus now began with Aries; and for Nissan, the month of the spring equinox and the new year, the zodiac of Aries rather than Taurus was thereafter written in. An example is the Babylonian astrolabe (“taker of stars”). It clearly inscribed the star Iku as the reigning celestial body for the first month



81
Nisannu. Iku was the “alpha” or lead star of the constellation of the Ram; it is still known by its Arabic name Hamal, meaning “male sheep.”
The ‘Taurian bulls’ were leaving and the ‘sheep’ were being left behind. The New Age had arrived in the heavens and on Earth.
As the vibrations on the planet became increasingly dense, as competition from the Egyptians and other surrounding races became too strong to combat from their fourth dimensional status, the Annunaki left or started incarnating as ‘humans’. This was about 2000 BCE, the beginning of the Bronze Age, the time Jon Landseer calculated in 1822 that a determining conjunction of Jupiter and the Sun in the boundary between Taurus and Aries had occurred (2142 BC); the time when Sumeria and its successors began to decline.
This time they left behind them a race of people, children of the lesser gods, who had been imprinted with a memory of their ‘gods’ and the fact that their creator came from somewhere up there in the sky where Heaven was. And the gods were immortal. And the gods were all-powerful. And the gods were all-knowing, and all-seeing! And those the gods had left behind to be the intercessors for them on the Earth, the priests, and the kings, took over the power and ran with it. The ‘Divine Right of Kings’ ruled in place of the absentee landlords. Between the priests and the kings and the other rulers, mankind was even worse off than he was before with the gods. They at least had begun to look on him with some degree of sympathy, and even with a small amount of love.
Religion, according to Sitchin, only started circa 2500-3500 BC. As we know, however, religion existed as far back as the beginning of Lemuria, and even long before that. But the religion now was one of worship, one of control by the kings and priesthood who wanted to fill the gods’ shoes. The Sorcerer Kings of Atlantis no longer ruled on the planet, but the Shepherd King-priests did, and so did the hierarchy of intercessors for God. And, as we shall see, even worse was yet to come.
Conclusion
The gods were no longer seen, not even in the sexual mayhem of the temple. Kingship was in place, the kings and priests took over from the gods, and civilization and power declined in Sumer and Akkad. The old guard had left and the new guard had moved in. The old gods had left and the new one called Yahweh stepped in. Even Sitchin agrees that there is very little if any similarity between the old gods and this new god, Yahweh, although he tries hard to find a comparison.
The two trees of paradise (a Gnostic scripture)
“THERE are two trees growing in paradise: one produces [animals], the other produces human beings. Adam [ate] from the tree that had produced animals; [he] became an animal and begot animals. For this reason the children of Adam worship the [animals]. The tree [ . . .] fruit [. . .] they became numerous [. . .] ate the [ . . .] [ . . .] fruit [ . . .] begot human beings [ . . .] human beings [. . .] god made human beings [ . . .] human beings made god.”
And still human Beings make their gods, whether it be the ones they cannot see to worship, or the ones they gather and horde around them and worship just as dearly—As God made man, so Man makes God. As the Nine warn:
“. . . they do not understand that these beings that they have given the term ‘god’ – not just the Hoovids (Hebrews) but gods of all the major religions and their spin-offs – were of physicalness, from the civilizations, and were made into gods by humans on Planet Earth.”



82
But whatever Man does, he must never attempt to seek certain types of knowledge. These forbidden forms of knowledge are symbolized in the story of Adam and Eve as two trees: the “tree of knowledge of good and evil” and the “tree of life.” The first “tree” symbolizes an understanding of ethics and justice. The second “tree” symbolizes the knowledge of how to regain and retain one’s spiritual identity and immortality.
Only one thing now stands in our way. This thing is hinted at in an inscription by Ashburnipal, King of Assyria, where it plainly states –“The mysterious god who lingers in a secret place where no one can see what his divine being is about.” In Etana’s dream of rebuilding after the Flood, there is still “an evil serpent trying to stop them.” The only thing standing in our way is the fact that ‘he’ is still out there—waiting.
The archetypes of history now shift. It was the Egyptians against the Sumerians in 3500 BC; it was the Israelites against the Egyptians in 1600 BC; the Christians against the Romans in 100 AD. And now at the end of the Mayan Calendar, it is the New Agers against the Christians setting up to play the Machiavellian game of “Us against Them.”
Everything we do today is connected to what happened in those days. The archetypes we carry, the way we think, the things we are, and how we relate to each other, all stem back to our creator parents. Our physical parents in this lifetime affect who we are to a certain extent. Our Creator parents and their legacy affect us to a larger extent. Our Universal Creator Parents affect us even more than the other two combined. And all the things we do in reaction to these influences are so unconscious because we don’t know our own history. But there’s a reason for everything, and once we can trace everything back to the time at which it occurred, and how we are reacting to it today, then we can begin to ease the pain, and we can begin to heal the wounds; and we can begin the return home from our prodigal ways, back home to the FATHER.
Chapter 14 THE EGYPTIAN BRANCH
Ancient Egyptian History – a brief description
The civilization of ancient Egypt is among the longest lasting and most religiously complex in the history of humanity. There is a prehistoric period about which very little is known. Then in about 3000 BCE there is the beginning of the so-called Early Dynastic period, which is commonly divided into the first and second dynasties, the first beginning with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rulership of Memphis, a city in the north near what is today Cairo.
It was during this time that both the writing and mythological systems were firmly established. The high god during the first dynasty was Horus in his form as a Falcon. In the second dynasty, beginning in about 2850 BCE, the union collapsed, and Seth became the high god of the southern region or Upper Egypt. The Old Kingdom, comprising the third through sixth dynasties, covers the period from about 2780 BCE to about 2250 BCE. It is marked by the domination of the northern religious center near Memphis called Heliopolis. This is a period of great Pharoanic power, supposedly the time of the building of the great pyramids, the greatest Egyptian art, the high god Atum or Ra, and the emergence of the cult of the resurrection godking Osiris and his wife, Isis. It is also the period of the sacred Pyramid Texts from which we get most of our information regarding the early Egyptian creation myths.



83
A time of anarchy followed during the seventh through tenth dynasties, but the period is notable for its literary activity and the so-called Coffin texts which also supply information on the cosmogonies. During this time the southern city of Thebes (now Luxor) grew in power. That power was solidified and Upper and Lower Egypt reunified in the Middle Kingdom era, covering dynasties eleven through thirteen and the period of the high god Amun or Amun RA.
Amun reigned during an intermediate period of four dynasties leading up to the New Kingdom era which began in 1580 BCE and was marked at the end of the eighteenth dynasty by the religious rebellion of the monotheist sun pharaoh, Akhenaton. During the next three dynasties, beginning in about 1320 BCE and including the rule of Tutankhamen (King Tut), the power of Amun was restored.
Egyptian Creation
Egyptian creation takes many forms, depending on the period and the religious center in question. In prehistoric times it seems clear that a great goddess, sometimes called Nun, corresponding to Callia in our Creation story, reigned supreme and was responsible for creation out of herself. It was said that she gave forth Atum, the Father figure—Enjliou, who then created the universe. There are remnants of this female creative power in such figures as Hathor, Nut (or Neith), and Isis, but by the time of the Pyramid Texts, in which we find the Old Kingdom creation myths, the male force has achieved dominance.
In spite of a constant development over the centuries, certain aspects of an Egyptian creation myth can be said to be relatively constant. These include a source of all things in the primeval waters (reminiscent of Lemurian Creation), themselves a remnant of the Great Mother. There is also the presence of an Eye, the sun that creates cosmos within the chaos of the surrounding waters. The sun, whether Atum (Enjliou), Ra, or Ptah, is also associated with a primeval mound or hill, much like the little fertile mound left by the receding Nile after the annual floods and perhaps like the early sun coming over the horizon. The mound was symbolized by the great pyramids. The people of Heliopolis said their city was the primal mound, the center of creation. The primal mound has two levels of interpretation; one, it is a vortex of energy which comes into the planet in various places creating a ‘well of energy’. These are the various sacred sites around the planet. Jerusalem is one of the largest and most significant vortexes on the planet; secondly, it is the ancient resting place of the Ark, or the mountaintops on which some survived the Flood, from which all life on earth began anew.
At Heliopolis, over the centuries Atum took many forms rather like the Indian concept of Brahman. Atum or Ptah was the original god; Khepri (spelled in various ways—for example, Khoprer) is Atum made visible (the lowered energy of Enjliou known as Angelu), and Ra is god as the sun. The Pyramid Texts tell us that Atum existed alone in the universe and that he created his brother and sister, Shu (air-life) and Tefnut (moisture-order) ex nihilo (created from nothing) by masturbating or, as some texts claimed, by expectorating (created by secretion). In some places the original god as Khepri, the morning sun, was said to have created himself by word—by calling out his own name (created by the primeval word or sound.) The number of different variations in these creation stories shows how many different influences came together in this one Empire.
Shu and Tefnut, in a sacred incestuous act (the creation between Callia and Lucifer) to be repeated for centuries by Egyptian pharaohs (god-kings or priest-kings), produced the god Geb (earth) and the goddess Nut (sky) (incestuous creation). Remember here that both the Annunaki and the Sirian/Orion survivors of Atlantis all had their common origins and common influences. All of this was watched over by the noninterfering Eye, the original god (the FATHER). Geb and Nut were the parents of Osiris and Isis, Seth and



84
Nephthys, and the older Horus. Osiris and Isis would later produce the boy Horus. From the children of Geb and Nut (the balance of earth and sky, or earthling and alien) came all the children of Egypt.
The best known and most frequently depicted event in the Egyptian creation is the separation of the world parents, Geb and Nut (world parent creation). Nut is typically seen arching as the sky over her prone brother, Geb. As the earth, he longs for the moist gifts of the sky so he may procreate, and frequently he is shown with an erect phallus. The world parents are separated by their father, Shu (air), presumably signifying the necessity of differentiation and order rather than total union or non-differentiation (chaos) for creation.
An early version of what became the Geb and Nut story says that when they perceived the old age of Ra and suspected his weakness, the people began to rebel against him. Not pleased, Ra held a meeting of his Eye, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, and Nun and told them that he had decided to destroy the people of the earth for their arrogance (reminiscent of the Annunaki). At Nun’s suggestion, Ra sent out his Eye, in this case a comet, to terrorize the people, and they fled into the desert, most to their death.
Wishing to retire, Ra and Nun asked Shu to place himself beneath Nut and raise her up. When he did so, she became the great sky cow, and the earth formed as Geb, a story symbolic of the raising of the mountains. A new creation began.
Among the many forms of the Egyptian cosmogonies is the familiar figure of the cosmic egg, a substitute for the primeval waters or the primeval mound. There were people who believed the cosmic egg to be the soul—perhaps the male soul, Atum or Shu—of the original maternal waters (a kind of ancient Animus, to borrow the Jungian term for the opposite sex projection of the energizing soul of the female).
One variant of the cosmic egg version teaches that the sun god, as primeval power, emerged from the primeval mound, which itself stood in the chaos of the primeval sea, a story symbolic of the mountains rising up out of the Flood as the savior of man, as in the story of Noah and the Ark.
According to Egyptian cosmology, the Egyptian god Ra, was born out of Nun or Nunu, the primeval abyss (the void). This equates directly with the creation of Lucifer from the darkness of the great Void, rather than from the Light of the FATHER. Ra, the only important god who was worshiped with consistency, chief of cosmic deities, the god from whom all the early Egyptian kings claimed descent, was the first incarnation of Lucifer on Earth.
In truth, Lucifer is the lowered energy of Enjliou known as Angelu from our Creation story, thus having his counterpart in Alicza, the lower energy of the Mother Callia. Lucifer’s creation in the universe is symbolically related in having come from the Darkness of the Void is true, for He came in fact from the Dark Side of His Parents, Enjliou and Callia. It was in the creation of Lucifer that the Parents split into their lower selves and into their higher selves, or lower and higher energies, and in doing so also created a division in
their offspring, both a lower and a higher form—these are the higher selves that were removed from us at the time of the creation by the Annunaki gods.
From what we know of Lucifer, the epithets in Egyptian cosmology make it obvious that He is the one being referred to as “Atum made visible,” the one which the cosmology points to as incarnating on the planet—“God made visible” or the ‘Father of Manifestation’.
‘Ra, god as the sun’ relates to one of the other names by which Lucifer is known, ‘Bringer of Light’, who resides at Heliopolis, “the City of the Sun.” ‘Ptah’, the serpent god, is self-explanatory. “Kephri, the morning sun,” is the Lucifer known in other places as the ‘Morning Star’. Where it tells us in The Pyramid Texts that “Atum existed alone in the universe and that he created his brother and sister, Shu and Tefnut ex nihilo



85
(created from nothing) by masturbating or, as some texts claimed, by expectorating (created by secretion)—it is a reflection of Lucifer’s ability to manifest from himself (the Father of Manifestation) through a single act of creation, rather than from the prescribed method of creator mother and creator father. It reflects his determination to be to be recognized as the one and only God of this Universe.
Lucifer’s arrival on Earth in a ‘physical incarnation’ coincided with the beginnings of the rebirth of civilization and of Mankind after the Flood in about 6000 BC. Having seen the destruction of most of the life upon the planet, and having seen the way Man worshipped the space-gods prior to the Flood, Lucifer knew that this would be his best opportunity to implant himself and his seed into the culture and into the genes of those on the planet Earth experiment. This need was created by the fact that his plan to work from a base on the planet Maldek had literally ‘blown up in his face’.
Working through the Sorcerer Kings of Atlantis had been fun, as we have been told that these ‘higher Beings’ can only work through their creation—through people. But Lucifer knew he needed a more direct influence, a more direct presence on the Earth to truly sow his seed. And sow his seed he did. Along with the other gods who had come from Atlantis to help set up the new kingdom in a model of the old, Ra implanted Himself in the fetus of one of the Orion females from Atlantis who was giving birth, and thus was born (c. 5000 BC) and raised as one of the gods, one of the survivors who then became the ancient Gods of Egypt.
This was only the first of seven incarnations of Lucifer on the planet from that point onwards, hence the importance of the number seven in Egyptian cosmology and in events relating to Time. The other six shall be dealt with as they arise in the course of our history. Know now, however, that they are surprising, but will confirm much of what you may already have suspected in your heart of hearts, that such destruction on the planet and such darkness could only have come from the Father of Darkness himself.
Just as God, the Creator Son, is the loving generous Father of the spirit, God is also the generous loving Mother of material existence. Therefore, it will not come as a surprise that two other of our cast of characters from the Creation story, mired in the flaws that They had created, split in their energies, were also made to incarnate at various times throughout the habitation of Soul in this Universe. This was Enjliou and Callia. This was ‘required’ of Them in order to aid in correcting the problems They had caused, and hopefully, in the same process, to find a healing both for Themselves and for Their ‘children’. This is the process of reincarnation where one Being will return in different situations with other beings, sometimes as father, sometimes as son, etc. For Enjliou and Callia and Lucifer, because of their high energies, however, they have never taken on the other sex as all of us do on both sides of the gender barrier. Remember, that in seeing their relationships to Lucifer’s incarnations in this lifetime, not only are They paying a karmic indebtedness, They are also reflecting the power and control They allowed this Being to have over them, much as all of us too sometimes allow the darker side of ourselves to get the better of us.
Each of them, both Enjliou and Callia, has had seven incarnations on the planet up until the present day, dating back from this time. As much as possible without threatening their current existence on the planet or their attempts to heal, we shall also highlight Their interaction in this story as well in those lifetimes which influenced Lucifer’s.
This beginning of Lucifer’s seven incarnations was the beginning of his plan to implant His own physical seed into the population of Earth as a form of internal control, and as a corruption of the original nature of Creation. His desire to control the Creative powers of the Mother, Callia, and thus women in general by always forming patriarchal control systems that suppress the feminine, is best exemplified in the Hebrew idea that ‘it is only when reunited with his Bride can God become complete as YHWH again,’ i.e. have the complete power of control over the Universal Creative process—BE GOD!



86
Also a survivor of Atlantis was Isis who became the consort of Ra, and from them came, Horus, worshiped or admired as the ‘Father’ of the ancient mysteries—a throwback to the Sorcerer Kings of Atlantis. Isis was the first incarnation of Callia, Horus (Thoth) was the first of Enjliou. Ancient Egyptian legends tell of the kind of interplays that were going on between these very real Beings here on the Earth.
“The goddess Hathor was a goddess of the night (lady of the night). She was a consort of all the gods. She was the wife of Horus, but also of all the gods—she could control the gods, and there was fear in the people that if they did not worship, then there would be destruction. Sekhmet, Isis and Hathor were sisters. It was only Hathor that controlled the rest, or attempted to. It was her knowledge of the physical control of others that caused trouble, for she came from a species that has the strongest desire for goodness, but also the strongest of physicality. Kali is one and the same. The people wanted to placate Hathor and so made her the wife of the gods.” (The Nine).
The Chinese also have similar tales relating to Horus (Thoth), always relating to some aspects of his magical abilities: “Monkey (Sun Houzi), in Chinese mythology, is a god-hero whose exploits are recorded in the Xiyouji (The Journey to the West), by Wu Cheng'en. Monkey was supposedly born from a stone egg, created from a rock as old as time and the essences of Heaven and Earth. He was a master of magic, and his weapons included a magical staff capable of growing or shrinking to any size.
“Monkey defied the supreme god of Chinese mythology, the Jade Emperor (Yu Di), with his own claim as high god. To appease the mischievous Monkey, the Jade Emperor proclaimed him King of Heaven, concealing the fact that he had only made him a heavenly stable keeper. Monkey discovered this deception and, enraged, returned to Earth to wreak havoc. The Jade Emperor entreated Buddha for help. Buddha dropped a mountain on Monkey, and Monkey remained beneath it for 500 years. On his journey from China to India to retrieve Buddhist scriptures, the monk Tripitaka unearthed Monkey, who became Tripitaka's escort and disciple. With two other companions, Piggy and Sandy, both ex-officials of the Heavenly Court reborn in monstrous bodies, Monkey accompanied the monk for 14 years, covering nine kingdoms and encountering numerous fantastic adventures. After presenting the scriptures Tripitaka had obtained in India to the Chinese emperor in the imperial capital of Chang-an, the four travelers were borne up to heaven. Monkey, with his irrepressible spirit and countless magic tricks, is generally regarded as a personification of the nature of genius.”
Many minor gods have been assimilated into the central pantheon of Hinduism by being identified with the great gods or with their children and friends just as in Egyptian legends. Hanuman, the monkey god, appears in the Ramayana as the cunning assistant of Rama in the siege of Lanka. Skanda, the general of the army of the gods, is the son of Shiva and Parvati, as is Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of scribes and merchants, the remover of obstacles, and the object of worship at the beginning of any important enterprise.
Ra/Lucifer, also known as Tem or Temu, was in some legends the god who created himself and the Universe, his name meaning “the complete one”—reflecting again the arrogance of the counterfeit spirit. Atum was a member of the Ennead or Great Nine, made up of Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Gebb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Set and Nephthys. These were the original nine ‘space-gods’ from various planets, in particular Sirius and Orion, the dark stars, who set up Egypt in the beginning and ruled there for thousands of years until they too were forced to leave by the greater density of the 3rd dimension. This came around the time of the first pharaohs about 3500 BC, the same time as kingship was lowered by the gods into Sumeria.
All in all, the existence of these Beings and the particular attributes of each are not in and of themselves important. Their abilities to manifest themselves on many different levels of vibrational existence were



87
complete in order to be able to control the minds of men and see that their power was absolute. If this does not always seem to make sense at our level of existence, it does make sense at a higher level for indeed we are working with multi-dimensional beings here working on many levels of existence, with great and varied abilities and powers to change the nature of reality.
Egyptian civilization suddenly seemed to appear all at once in the fourth millennium BC. Egypt moved straight from a stage of pre-civilization to the government of large areas without the usual era of city states intervening. The ordinary logic of historical development does not apply to Egypt as it does to Mesopotamia.
Zep Tepi – “The First Time”
“In the whole corpus of ancient Egyptian writings, the Edfu Building Texts preserve the only references to the founders of Egypt, the ‘Seven Sages’, that have survived to the present day. Egyptologists have therefore paid little attention to the identity of these beings beyond conceding that they appear to have played a part in ‘a much wider and more general theory concerning the origin of sacred domains and their temples’. In our opinion, however, there is something notable about the context in which the Texts describe the Sages. This context is marked by a preponderance of ‘Flood’ imagery in which the ‘primeval waters’ (out of which the Great Primeval Mound emerged) are depicted as gradually receding. We are reminded of Noah’s mountain-top on which the Ark settled after the Biblical deluge, and of the ‘Seven Sages’ (Apkallu) of ancient Babylonian tradition who were said to have ‘lived before the Flood’ and to have built the walls of the sacred city of Uruk. Likewise is it no accident that in Indian tradition ‘Seven Sages’ (Rishis) are remembered to have survived the Flood, their purpose being to preserve and pass down to future generations the wisdom of the antediluvian world.” (Breasted)
When Egypt was later divided into upper and lower halves with two crowns united, each of the
kingdoms had its own principal stone pillar—a spiritual umbilical cord between the priests and the gods. One was in Heliopolis and the other in Thebes. They were eastward facing pillars revered by the theraputeate and the prototypes for the pillars of Solomon’s Temple 200 years later. In Egypt, the pillars were symbols of unity and of a concept known as Ma’at, which defined a just and level foundation, now a part of a greeting in modern day Freemasonry.
Among the many royal insignia of the early Egyptian kings were the shepherd’s crook and the sceptre.
In all cases the sages appear as the enlightened survivors of a cataclysm that wiped the Earth clean who then set about making a fresh start at the dawn of a new age—which, in ancient Egypt, was referred to as the “First Time” (Zep Tepi). As Reymond confirms in her masterly study of the Edfu texts:
“The first era known by our principal sources was a period which started from what existed in the past. The general tone of the record seems to convey the view that an ancient world, after having been constituted, was destroyed, and as a dead world it came to be the basis of a new period of creation which at first was the re-creation and resurrection of what once had existed in the past.”
This is an obvious reference to Atlantis, the ancient world that had existed in the past, but had been “destroyed” in the great Flood. The fact that it “at first was the re-creation and resurrection of what once had existed in the past” would lead a person to believe that what the Atlantean survivors and colonizers had tried to do, at first, was to recreate the wonders that were Atlantis prior to the Flood—the imagery and legend of the Phoenix. This is exactly what had happened, but it was not to be. Too much had been lost, and the difficulties of working with the more ‘primitive’ people and working in the 3rd dimension proved to be too great an obstacle, even though their newly acquired status as 4th dimensional beings in a 3rd dimensional world meant they could actually be in a number of different places at once.



88
The Nine refer to the difficulties that occurred in one of their channelings:
“The people were still fearful from the flood and built up a great worship system – Also they worshipped those that were not of such a good nature. . . Isis was seen as the consort of Ra, who was one of the not-sogood ones” —perhaps a hidden reference here to their knowledge of the Opposition—Lucifer.
The Sirian and Orion gods were also on a different timetable than their Sumerian counterparts, and perhaps were not as mired in their brush with physicality as were the Annunaki. Their time to leave or physically incarnate came around 3500 BC, just as ‘the First Time’ came to an end and the reign of the pharaohs took over. They, too, left their gifts, and indeed left their own ways to stay in touch with the powerbase they had created here on Earth, the civilization that was Egypt.
As the Nine suggest, and we shall explore later, much of the medical knowledge from Atlantis was given to the new colony; and the Sphinx had more to do with the beginnings of Egypt than later times, as researchers are just beginning to notice.
Greece kept more of the legends from this time “because of the channeling through Plato.” They were, in fact, Socrates thoughts, but it was the interpretation of Plato which gave them importance. The mananimal figures of Greek mythology came from Atlantis, but Greece also had visits from the alien gods. Most of their mythology comes from Atlantis and from Egypt—Mercury, Apollo and Diana were ‘physical’ spacegods but they were also archetypal. The Aeons in Gnostic tradition refers to these alien gods, but much truth was destroyed in order to keep the masses in control, say the Nine.
One of these alien races that had much to do with the setting up of Egypt were the reptilian race from Alpha Draconis (in the constellation of Draco), similar Beings to the Annunaki, only those who had colonized a different planet. Draco was once the North Star or Polestar, the most conspicuous star in the northern hemisphere, located closest to the point toward which the axis of the Earth is directed, thus roughly marking the location of the north celestial pole. During the past 5000 years, however, the line of direction of the North Pole has moved from the star Alpha Draconis (also known as Thuban) in the constellation Draco, to within one degree of the bright star Polaris, also known as Alpha Ursae Minoris, in the constellation Ursa Minor (Little Dipper), which is now the North Star. The planet Alpha Draconis is one of the stars to which certain aspects of the Great Pyramid are aligned.
Osiris came to Earth from Orion at the beginning of the Age of Taurus in about 4320 BC, according to Barbara Clow who accesses the memory banks of the Hebrew prophet, Isaiah, to speak of these times when other star beings also came. She explains the competition which developed between them, giving us also another aspect of temple technology to help us fill in the details of how it works.
“In the ancient days, I was one of many channels who were bringing in Orion beings for information about how to defeat the Egyptians. . . . Why Orion? Our Hebrew priests discovered the Egyptians were working with Orion beings, and we went to Egypt to study in their temples to figure out how they did it.
“. . . The Egyptians accessed Orion by working with reptiles who lived in the bowels of their power points (vortexes). There are some power points where all the dimensions interface with the telluric realm, and Khem was one of those places. . . So we made tunnels and filled them with spring water under Mt. Moriah, and we moved in crocodiles so we also could work with the beings of Orion . . . in order to activate the telluric realm, the intention of Gaia (the Earth consciousness) needs to be sourced, and this was done in the bottom layer of the temple where the crocodiles rolled around in silica clay. With this technology, we got the news directly from their guides. We wanted to know what the Egyptians were



89
tuned into so we could outfox them by using their own guidance against them. Our channels brought Orion data into the Temple of Solomon on Mt. Moriah (Jerusalem).”
Silica is a relation of silicon, one of the foundations of the computer chip industry. All of the technology surrounding the way in which temples work as energy conductors and receivers is based in quartz, crystals, and silica/silicon, because these are the basis of the communications industry. The metal of choice was gold because it is one of the finest conductors of electricity, and looks good as a decoration over some other metals that might have been used. Water is also a very powerful conductor of electricity as well.
The image from the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which the Nazis open the Ark only to find sand, is not coincidental—sand is silica-based.
The crocodiles act a power source, what you might think of as ‘animal magnetism’, only in this case it is more electro-magnetic energy, similar to the idea that the human body is a battery of electromagnetic energy capable of producing a steady 120 volts of electricity, in and of itself. This theme is expended upon in the movie, The Matrix, where human Beings are used as a power source for an ‘alienlike’ race of artificial-intelligence machines, and bred for the power they can create—kind of like portable batteries.
In the crocodile temples this energy was transmitted through the silica clay as a semi-conductor to power the receiving and transmitting of the energies to and from space, and distant stars.
The Pyramids and the Sphinx
To understand the alignment of sacred sites with certain planets and constellations, it is first necessary that we take a quick lesson in astronomy. Especially necessary is an understanding of what is called ‘precession’.
Precession, to simplify it greatly, is a wobble in the planet’s motion which means that as the Earth rotates, constellations in the zodiac will actually appear in slightly different places from year to year. Over these centuries, where these stars appear will go up and down on this wobble, but because it is a known wobble, the place of the planets rising and setting as seen from Earth can be calculated. Still, it is a complex mathematical and astronomical feat, but one which most ancient societies took into account when aligning their temples and other sacred sites. The cycle of the precession is 25,868 years, so it is not something a normal human will deal with in the space of one lifetime. A correction for precession must be applied to celestial charts to find the true position of the stars at any given time. This acts as a sort of star-clock for our planet. Knowing the exact rate of precessional change and the co-ordinate of a star, we can determine its altitude, say, at the meridian for any given epoch or, if you prefer, its rising point on the eastern horizon.
It is also helpful to know that in ancient Egypt, the constellation that rose in the east just before the sun (that is, rose heliacally) marked the place where the sun ‘rested’. It was known as the sun’s ‘carrier’, and as the main ‘pillar’ of the sky. The sun’s position among the constellations at the spring (vernal) equinox was the pointer that indicated the ‘hours’ of the precessional cycle –very long hours indeed, the equinoctial sun occupying each zodiacal constellation for just under 2200 years.
Having been an Atlantean colony even before the Flood, Egypt originally built the Pyramids, as Cayce suggests, with the aid of Atlantean technology; and with a number of alien races participating, as Gordon Michael Scallion suggests. We shall go into this more later on. The Pyramids themselves were aligned with certain stars in the constellations of Sirius and Orion, the dark star worlds responsible for the dark energies



90
of the Atlantean sorcerer kings (though, as we know, not all the planets in either of these constellations are dark).
As we are beginning to understand from our work with temple technology, this alignment and the sacred geometry techniques used in the pyramids’ construction meant that energies could be brought in from these stars as well as transmitted to them. And not only energies, but 4th dimensional Beings (who are simply energies as such), for the planet at that time was 4th dimensional. Later, certain areas within the pyramid were retained as 4th dimensional areas similar to the 3D/4D ‘twilight zones’ at the top of the Sumerian temples used by the Annunaki as sex palaces. Some of these areas of the pyramids have been closed off to the public these days because of the effects they had on the visiting tourists.
As Ginny and Michael Katz describe them, the Pyramids were, in part, big ‘transporters’ such as are used in the Star Trek series of television shows and movies. At that time, Beings could be transported to and from their planets, as well as to a number of other different locations around the planet where other templepyramids had been constructed. When the Flood occurred, colonies were not only cut off physically, but also from visits to and from their planetary headquarters on Atlantis and in Egypt. It was then that many of these outlying colonies died or disappeared without the easy access to ‘home base’.
As described, when Egypt was first set up after the Flood, those responsible tried to mould it in the image of Atlantis, using in part the energies brought in through the pyramids. But this was unsuccessful. It was only with the correct alignments accomplished in about 3500 BC that some of those remaining here from other planets were able to leave, and others able to stay.
When legend speak of the influence of the Pyramids on the productivity of the land, it is the gathering of these star energies and other Universal energies that when mixed with those of Gaia, were able to make the land so productive. This is the same concept as talked about in the Grail Legends where Arthur is told he and the land are One.
The prominent legend of Osiris and Set(h) is an allegorical tale of the sinking of Atlantis (much like that of the Phoenix), and the severing of its connections to both the energies of Sirius and Orion.
Like a warring band of brother-led tribes here on Earth, these two constellations had been both at war and in alliances for thousands of years before settling on Mars and Maldek, the Sirians on Maldek—the Orionites on Mars. It was during one of these times of war that things got out of hand and destroyed or made lifeless these two planets. This was a war that also involved the Pleiadeans as we shall find out later. The survivors, as already said, took over the declining Atlantis and guided it into the Dark clutches of the mixed Sirian/Orion Sorcerer Kings.
One must remember here that it was an earlier incarnation of Lucifer who appeared on Orion with his awesome knowledge that swayed it towards the Dark side, making it a base for his power much as he has now steered this planet toward the very same end. Thus it was Lucifer’s influence behind the Orionites that led to the galactic wars that have been raging for so long, glimpses of which we have had in the writings of Solara and others so far. Again, as with everything he touches, there are many varied levels of meaning to each symbol or story told relating to his history. The Father of Lies has learned and taught his followers well to veil their secrets in metaphor and symbolism.
Osiris, in Egyptian mythology, was one of the principal deities. Originally the local god of Abydos and Busiris, Osiris represented the male productive force in nature—on one level, the energies from Sirius/Orion which were and are a very male dominated energy just as it was in Atlantis. On the higher level he represents Lucifer, the male productive force split from Enjliou and intent on creating (even



91
without the female energy to give his creations balance, though he would dearly love to control the Mother as well).
Osiris was regarded as the ruler of the realm of the dead—on one level representing the sunken Atlantis, the power base of the Dark side prior to the Flood. On the higher level, Lucifer, the role many people think of him in as the devil ruling over the trapped souls in hell. Where might the proof of this fact lie? Let’s hear Thoth’s own words from the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, Emerald Tablet V: The Dweller of Unal:
“. . .dwelt in his Temple, the Master of Unal, Light of the Earth in Atlantis’ day. Master, He, from a cycle beyond us, living in bodies as one among men. Not as the earth-born, He from beyond us, Sun of a cycle, advanced beyond men.
“Know ye, O man, that Horlet the Master, was never one with the children of men. Far in the past time when Atlantis first grew as a power, appeared there one with the Key of Wisdom, showing the way of Light to all.
“. . . Upon another, built He a Temple, built but not by the children of men.
“Out of the Ether called He its substance, moulded and formed by the power of Ytolan into the forms He built with His mind. Mile upon mile it covered the island, space upon space it grew in its might. Black, yet not black, but dark like the space-time, deep in its heart the Essence of Light. Swiftly the Temple grew into being, moulded and shaped by the Word of the Dweller, called from the formless into a form.
“Builded He then, within it, great chambers, filled them from forms called forth from the Ether, filled them with wisdom called forth by His mind.
“Formless was He within his Temple, yet was He formed in the image of man. Dwelling among them yet not of them, strange and far different was He from the children of men.
“Chose He then from among the people, Three who became his gateway. Chose He the Three from the Highest to become his links with Atlantis. Messengers they, who carried his council, to the kings of the children of men.
“Brought He forth others and taught them wisdom; teachers, they, to the children of men. Placed He them on the island of Undal to stand as teachers of Light to men. Each of those who were thus chosen, taught must he be for years five and ten. Only thus could he have understanding to being Light to the children of men. Thus there came into being the Temple, a dwelling place for the Master of man.
Some reminders need to be given here just to make sure things are clear since the importance of this one segment of writing is awesome in its impact in the whole scheme of this book and what is just about to be written.
• First is the similarity of this Being coming “from a cycle beyond us,” just as the incarnation of Lucifer came to Orion in an earlier chapter to first bring this knowledge that then led to the enslavement of so many in that constellation to the Dark Forces.
• Secondly, the fact that he is living in a body “as one among men.” He does incarnate here on the planet!
• Called “Horlet, the Master,” just as in deMaupassant’s Le Horla as if this writer knew what was to come: “Now I know, I can guess the truth. Man’s dominion is a thing of the past! He has come, the being who was an object of fear to primitive races, whom anxious priests tried to exorcise, whom sorcerers called up at midnight without ever yet seeing him in visible form, to whom the temporary



92
lords of creation attributed in imagination the shape monstrous or attractive, of gnomes, spirits, fairies or goblins. After the vulgar ideas inspired by prehistoric fears, scientific research has clarified the outlines of Man’s presentiment. Mesmer guessed it, and in the last ten years doctors have discovered the exact nature of this beings’ power before its manifestation. They have experimented with this weapon of the new lord of the world, the imposition of a dominant will on the human soul, which thus becomes its slave. To this power they have given the name of magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion, and what not. I have seen them playing with it like silly children playing with fire. Woe to us! Woe to mankind! He has come . . . what is his name? . . . yes, he is shouting it and I can’t hear . . . say it again! Le Horla, I’ve got it at last . . . Le Horla . . . that’s his name . . . Le Horla has come!”
• “. . . the Key of Wisdom, showing the way of Light to all,” or illumination as might be used by the Illuminati and the mystery schools and the New World Order in general. But herein also lays the sadness of the truth of what has been said about the New Age spiritualism that believes it serves the Light of the FATHER when in truth it only serves, like all the other religious paths, the lesser light of Lucifer.
• Black, yet not black, but dark like the space-time, deep in its heart the Essence of Light, and Three who became his gateway. Chose He the Three from the Highest to become his links with Atlantis. Remember from EL:AN:RA, the Healing of Orion:
“It was the dreaded triad known as the OMNI, the rulers of the Dark Lords of Orion. The Omni stood as one vast, impenetrable presence, although their three forms were quite different in physical appearance. . . .”
“. . . Betelgeuse was located in the constellation known as Orion though quite distant from the star system of Rigel, home of the Dark Lords. Orion has held the key patterning for this dimensional universe since its creation. It is the pivotal anchor point for duality hence you will find within this one constellation both the darkest and lightest of energies, forever acting out the roles of good and evil with concentrated focus. Orion chose to embody this template of duality for all of us so we could fully experience matter, separation and illusion . . .
“. . . This was his mystery and his mark of greatness and why he has chosen to stand in the center of the OMNI. It could be said that if you truly looked at Zeon carefully, with your clearest vision, you would see a small sphere of white within his vast vortex of blackness. Only one being at a time within the entire of the Dark Lords of Orion was given this circle to embody. But it was essential to the Divine Plan in accordance with Universal Law, that always there be one embodiment.”
Whoever controlled the Great Pyramid and its companions at Giza; shared in the control of the space activities, of the comings and goings of the gods, of the vital supply link to and from the twelfth Planet.
Herein too, we can begin to tie in the essential part of the New World Order also played by street gangs and organized crime, even to the connection of the Asian gangs known appropriately enough as the Triads.
• “moulded and shaped by the Word of the Dweller—the key to the Masonic order, the lost word of the Freemasons, that essential word of Creation needed for complete control of the creative process—one which the Father of Manifestation always knew and could use as in the case of manifesting this enormous temple “called from the formless into a form.”

• Thus there came into being the Temple, a dwelling place for the Master of man . . . who else
terms himself as “the Master of men” but Lucifer? What better understanding of the roles of temples in the control of Mankind than knowing who it is that resides therein?
**Note: It is suggested here that the reader take a break to digest this last piece of information before proceeding, reflect upon it using the guidelines given in the introduction about not looking at new information through an old framework. It is essential this part be digested before reading the next few pages.
Osiris was the brother and husband of Isis, goddess of the earth and moon, who represented the female productive force in nature—what we would now call Gaia, the planetary consciousness, so he was both brother and husband toward the Earth in terms of influence and the breeding of its women.
According to legend, Osiris, as king of Egypt, found his people plunged in barbarism—those original inhabitants of Egypt who were taken over by the Atlanteans—and taught them law, agriculture, religion, and other blessings of civilization. He was murdered by his evil brother, Set—on one level, the comet that was partially responsible for the flood—on the higher level, the third son of Adam known as Seth, also called from then on Melchizedek. Set tore the body to pieces and scattered the fragments, the destruction of Atlantis and the scattering of the remnants of its people as well as scattering the fragments of the Sirian/Orion influence.
Isis found and buried his scattered remains, however, and each burial place were thereafter revered as sacred ground. Why are the remnants of lost Atlantis so few and far between? Why has its very existence been so expunged from our memory and also from our history books? Surely something more would remain of this vast empire that touched all four corners of the globe?
Remember where it said that the early civilizations in Zep Tepi and later on were so involved with their own archeological pursuits? Just as with the gradual removal of everything but ‘the official story’ from the history books by religious groups such as the Catholic Church, by the Nazi Party, and by the Communist Chinese—the remnants and records of far Atlantis were systematically retrieved or destroyed. Those that remained were stored away in the vaults beneath the pyramids like a time capsule, time lock and all. The purpose? To wait for the right alignment, the right dimensional lift in the planet, the return of certain Beings who controlled key elements of the future, to bring them to light again. And it was not to be for the good of all Mankind, but instead to reinstitute the power and control of the Atlantean Empire and the Dark Sorcerer Kings that could not be re-established in the millennia after the Flood. The timing needed to be right. What is the ultimate goal of the New World Order? To reinstitute and rebuild the empire of Atlantis as it was in the dark days before its fall.
Again, stop and consider this information again in light of what has been written so far. If not yet convinced, then certainly do not dismiss it until you have read further on.

Isis now hid from Seth in the marshes of the Delta near Heliopolis and in due course gave birth to a son, Horus/Thoth, from the temporarily regenerated Osiris—Egypt began as a lesser version of Atlantis after the Flood, its power base in Heliopolis, The City of the Sun. Again, it was about 2850 BCE that the union of Upper and Lower Egypt collapsed—this the, at best, tenuous alliance that had always existed between Sirius and Orion. Seth/Melchezidek became the high god of the southern region, or Upper Egypt. This was during the time of the Old Kingdom, comprising the third through sixth dynasties from about 2780 BCE to about 2250 BCE, the period marked by the domination of the northern religious center near Memphis called Heliopolis. This is a period of great Pharoanic power, the time of the re-building of the great pyramids, the greatest Egyptian art, the high god Atum or Ra, and the emergence of the cult of the resurrection godking Osiris and his wife Isis. It is also the period of the sacred Pyramid Texts.
Horus was a ‘son’ or product of Atlantis, which in some ways had been temporarily resurrected by the survivors and the new influx of Sirians and Orions. Horus, whom we shall come to know as Thoth—was at the very heart of the ancient mysteries that are still helping to once again re-establish this kingdom, this New Jerusalem on Earth. And for a long time he reigned as supreme god before the union of Upper and Lower Egypt collapsed, Seth/Melchezidek subsequently becoming the principle power.
In the introduction to the Emerald Tablets of Thoth is this excerpt from the history of Thoth:
“The history of the tablets translated in the following pages is strange and beyond the belief of modern scientists. Their antiquity is stupendous, dating back some 36,000 years B.C. The writer is Thoth, an Atlantean Priest-King, who founded a colony in ancient Egypt after the sinking of the mother country. He was the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, erroneously attributed to Cheops. In it he incorporated his knowledge of the ancient wisdom and also securely secreted records and instruments of ancient Atlantis.”
During later ages, the ego of Thoth passed into the bodies of men in the manner described in the tablets. As such, he incarnated three times, in his last being known as Hermes, the thrice-born. In this incarnation, he left the writings known to modern occultists as the Emerald Tablets, a later and far lesser exposition of the ancient mysteries.
Horus/Thoth grew to become a powerful prince of the colonies on Earth, eventually challenging Seth/Melchezidek to a duel to see who had the right to rule Egypt in Osiris’s stead. During the fight, Horus lost an eye, and Seth lost his testicles. Though the battle was inconclusive, the sun god was eventually persuaded to judge in favor of the young Horus and he was proclaimed king and his the supreme colony, and he the first in the line of the pharaohs.
Osiris lived on in the underworld as the ruler of the dead—Atlantis remains in memory and culture, and in the dark underground stream still flowing on in the ancient mystery schools and the brotherhoods that stemmed from it. Atlantis lived on underground. But Osiris was also, through Horus, regarded as the source of renewed life—the rebuilding of the culture and of the lost genetics of the people, genetic imprints of culture and of knowledge wiped clean by the Fall into 3rd dimensional density.
This seemingly tragic story of Osiris and the heroic struggle of Horus/Thoth to regain the throne served as a model throughout Egyptian history. The pharaohs legitimized their authority and, more especially, deified their rule by proclaiming themselves reincarnations of Horus (and the Sirius/Orion connection). The epic battle with Seth/Melchezidek became a metaphor for the struggle of the pharaoh against illegitimate claims to the throne. It is an accepted fact that all kings of Egypt were regarded as the



95
reincarnation of Horus, and in this capacity they were the upholders of what the ancient Egyptians called ‘ma'at’, sometimes interpreted as ‘law and order’. From the Emerald Tablets of Thoth:
“List ye, O man. Take of my wisdom. Learn of the deep hidden mysteries of space. Learn of the Thought that grew in the abyss, bringing Order and Harmony in space.
“Know ye, O man, that all that exists has being only because of the Law. Know ye the Law and ye shall be free, never be bound by the fetters of night.”
When a Horus-king died, he was assured a rebirth with Osiris, that is to say he became at one with Osiris in the afterworld of the Duat—his astral self being transported to Sirius or Orion through the energies of the Pyramid and the elaborate ritual he was made to go through to achieve ‘eternal life’. Mummification of the physical body and burial with much of his wealth was instigated should the ‘astral self’ of the Pharaoh wish to return to Earth and resume his rightful position.
In the secret repository of the King's Chamber within the Great Pyramid the age-old tradition relates that the builders had placed ‘instruments of iron, arms which rust not, glass which might be bended but not broken, and strange spells'. But what did the first explorers find, having tunneled their way into the sealed chamber? The only furniture was a lidless, hollowed stone coffer, containing not a body but a layer of a mysterious powdery substance. This has been superficially determined to be grains of feldspar and mica, both of which are minerals of the aluminum silicate group. However, during the course of the recent white powder research, aluminum and silica were two of the constituent elements revealed by conventional analysis of a granular sample that was known to be a 100% platinum-group compound. (Gardner)
The King's Chamber was, therefore, apparently contrived as a superconductor, capable of transporting the pharaoh into another dimension of space-time -- and it was here that his Rite of Passage was administered in accordance with the Book of the Dead. The key to this Right of Passage is defined by a single conical inscription near the entrance to the Chamber. This hieroglyphic symbol (the only verifiable hieroglyph on the whole of the Gizeh plateau - and the very same as appeared many times at the Sinai mountain temple) reads quite simply, 'bread'.
A pharaoh’s death would leave the throne of Egypt vacant for the legitimate heir to assume the role of Horus; the heir was thus the living one, the son of Osiris and Isis (of both Earth and Orion/Sirius), as opposed to his dead father, now an Osiris-king (O-siris). It was this cyclical exchange from ‘Horus-toOsiris-to-Horus’ which was at the heart of the royal cult of the pharaohs; being gods, their mortality could be explained only in terms of this divine myth and it was never in doubt that they would be reborn in the afterworld realm of Osiris. The essential aim of the Pyramid texts was to assist this crucial process.
Henri Frankfort showed that the rebirth rites for a dead king ran in parallel with the coronation rituals for his heir. The death of a pharaoh thus triggered a double event, his funeral and the coronation of his heir, and one should be aware when reading the Pyramid texts that they are dealing with a double ritual: the funeral of a Horus-king waiting to become an Osiris, and the coronation of the new Horus-king as the son of Osiris. In astral terms, the new king was the son of Osiris-Orion. Just as Osiris was identified with the constellation of Orion, so his consort and sister, Isis, was identified with Sothis (Sirius). Isis-Sirius (Isis-Sothis) was thus the astral mother of the living king.
These extracts indicate clearly the performance of an evocative stellar ritual in which the dead king, as a star of Osiris-Orion, is seen as copulating with Isis-Sothis (Sirius)—Orion and Sirius combining to seed her womb and leave her pregnant with the astral Horus, the son of Sothis—Egypt. The latter is



96
represented by the legitimate heir, now to become the new pharaoh of Egypt. It seems obvious that this son of Sothis is also identified with a celestial body, and Faulkner has suggested the planet Venus (a star) because of the name ‘Morning Star’. But neither Venus nor any other planet qualifies as Morning Star so that it is also coming forth from the womb of Sothis (Sirius).
Remember the Dogon of Mali who long ago reported an invisible companion star of Sirius? According to Temple, the Dogon’s tradition supposedly came from Ancient Egypt where it originated c. 3200BC. Today this invisible star is called Sirius B. It is super-dense, a white dwarf in astronomer’s jargon which can be seen only through a very powerful telescope.
The Great Pyramid, when it was constructed and still entirely intact, in 10,500 BC, prior to the Floodnot in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC as has been taught until now, was a complete textbook of cabalistic science. It incorporated the full range of numerical formulae in which can be found the entire cosmic knowledge of its age. The measurements of the earth and the heavens were contained within its fabric, as well as a true mathematical illustration of the development of life. It was an instrument both of astrology and astronomy, the embodiment of a message to the future and a magnetic center capable of attracting the power by which those who understand its secrets could enter a world of miracles. It was constructed for a magical and sacred purpose, as a vehicle for transcending the material state (initiation), for travel in space, through time and into a further dimension.
The modern desert of North Africa in which it lies was once a rich corn producing area. The exact reasons for its decline have never been established but it is certain that the wasting process was initiated almost within the historical period, indeed from about the time when the Great Pyramid lost its legendary tip and ceased to perform its original function. From what is known of the standard weights and measures of antiquity it has been inferred by recent researchers that the apex of the Great Pyramid was five cubic inches of gold. It was in fact, however, a large crystal much like pyramidal crystals that can be bought today—only considerably larger and considerably purer. The Washington Monument, a simple obelisk that was built by a Masonic Brotherhood after plans for an elaborate monument were scrapped, looks much like the Egyptian obelisks known as Cleopatra’s Needle, but has a 100-ounce aluminum capstone on it similar to the crystal one that once graced the tip of the Great Pyramid. Its purpose in drawing energies into the power center that is Washington is very much the same purpose as the Great Pyramid and other similar monuments had; all based on the original Atlantean template.
The legend referring to the cutting off of the phallus of Osiris, his ability to reproduce, refers to the time when the energies of the Pyramid were cut off from connection to Sirius/Orion by the removal of this crystal tip—thus causing the land to become unproductive. More importantly, it also cut off Osiris’ ability to reproduce –to bring in new Beings from these two constellations, as symbolized in the removal of his phallus. This was done purposely by the Hebrews who were hoping to take the power away from Egypt, as suggested at the end of the last chapter, so they could then become the power base for that energy using Jerusalem and Solomon’s Temple as their base for receiving and transmitting the star energies.
As Clow says in her work: “It is the ultimate taboo: the real truth about primordial control over the mind of man—control of the universe . . . I realize that I do not really possess courage. Then my heart shuts down and the eye can read me . . . This eye communicates to me that teachings from Atlantis have been filtered through many different locations . . . Powerful insights about our origins and development actually exist in the early records of Atlantis, but they are hidden from us because the Nibiruans, the creator gods, realized we could be controlled if we could be made to fear.”

Measuring the Stars
The one question which above all intrigued the philosophers of the ancient world was the relationship between dimensions. In all their numerical structures, the builders set out to illustrate the process of growth, and the development of the macrocosm from the initial fusion of elements.
The relationship of the Pyramid’s height to the perimeter of its base is the same as that between the radius and circumference of a circle, and it is probable that the expanding squares of the successive pyramids were intended to represent a series of concentric rings—the Atlantean temple form. The whole scheme formed a model of this mystical city in terms of which the philosophers of the ancient world were accustomed to express their cosmology. An example of this figure can not only be found in Plato’s description of Atlantis, but also in the Biblical visions of Ezekiel and St. John the Divine. Ezekiel’s city of Jerusalem was surrounded by the Holy Oblation, a square 25,000 reeds on every side, a number obviously the same in origin as the 25, 088 miles equated in the side of the outer pyramid which measures the Earth’s circumference. . . 25, 000 miles. This figure was therefore used in cosmology as the ideal measure of the terrestrial circumference.
The side of the base and the height of the Great Pyramid are in the ratio 8:5, the harmonious proportion known as the golden mean. The perimeter of the base of the tip of the pyramid was 10 Π (pi), the circumference of a circle with radius 5.
The physical layout of the three pyramids on the Earth mimicked exactly the sky pattern of Orion’s Belt, located in the constellation of Orion, with the two larger pyramids in a line and the third smaller one slightly offset. They were built in the time between 11,000 BC and 10,500 BC, prior to the Great Flood. The alignment of the three great Pyramids of Giza mark a very significant moment in the 26,000-year precessional cycle of these stars. In 10,500 BC, they were at the lowest point in their slide up and down the meridian, when (as seen from the latitude of Giza) they culminated at an altitude of 9 degrees 20 minutes above the horizon. In 2500 BC, when they are supposed to have been built but were in fact rebuilt, the Belt stars crossed the meridian at altitude 45°, targeted by the southern shaft coming from the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid. In our epoch, 2000 AD, they are approaching the highest altitude that they will attain in their precessional cycle—58 degrees 06 minutes above the horizon at meridian transit—a very significant alignment which will mean startling events upon our planet, and not just astrologically speaking either.
Some mystery resides around work being done in that area of the pyramids right now by the Egyptian government, but it was obviously related to preparations for this 2000 AD alignment. And the Egyptian government is not the only one who knows it and is preparing for it.
Recent investigations have established that in circa 2500BC—the era recognized by Egyptologists as ‘The Pyramid Age’ –each one of the four shafts in the Great Pyramid were finely targeted at a special star as it culminated at the meridian:
“From the Queen’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 39 degrees and was aimed at the star Kochab in the constellation of the Little Bear – a star associated by the ancients with ‘cosmic regeneration’ and the immortality of the soul (Beta Ursa Minor—the Kolob of the Mormons, the planet on which ‘God’ is supposed to reside ). The southern shaft, on the other hand, which is angled at 39 degrees 30’, was aimed at the bright star Sirius (Alpha Canis Major) in the constellation of the Great Dog. This star the ancients associated with the goddess Isis, cosmic mother of the Kings of Egypt.”
Kochab’s connection with the Mormon religion is an individual response by one particular ‘god’ of this time to separate himself and his beliefs from those of the other deities worshipped at that time, Kochab being



98
his home planet. We know of this Being’s prophet of the time as Enoch, one of the original prophets, the one who didn’t die but was taken up to heaven in one of those infamous ‘chariots of fire.’”
“From the King’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 32 degrees 28’ and was aimed at the ancient Pole star, Thuban (Alpha Draconis—home of the reptilian race related to the Annunaki) in the constellation of the Dragon—associated by the Pharaohs with notions of ‘cosmic pregnancy and gestation’. The southern shaft, which is angled at 45 degrees 14’, was aimed at Al Nitak (Zeta Orionis – home of a race of aliens known of as the Zetans (about which we were warned earlier by the Nine), the brightest (and also the lowest) of the three stars of Orion’s Belt—which the ancient Egyptians identified with Osiris, their high god of resurrection and rebirth and the legendary bringer of civilization to the Nile Valley in the remote epoch referred to as Zep Tepi, ‘the First Time.’ “
** Thus we have in one central transformer, the Great Pyramid, a star connection to Kochab—Lucifer’s ‘headquarters’, to Alpha Draconis—home of the reptilian races, to the Zetans—home of the Grays, and to Sirius, home of one of the two original dark stars in the galaxy. This one creation ties together all the power bases of Lucifer and transmits energy both to and from them –when in operation!
Kate Spence, of the University of Cambridge, confirms the pyramids connections to Kochab in her research on how the Egyptians aligned the pyramids to true north. She estimates the building (rebuilding or renovation in actual fact) of the pyramids began between 2,485 BC-2,375 BC and that two stars helped the Egyptians to align them to true north, important to them for religious reasons.
The Egyptians were trying to find true north but they didn't have a star marking the pole so they used two stars, Kochab in Ursa Minor or the Little Dipper, and Mizar in Ursa Major, or the Big Dipper to find the pole.
"It (the pole) is on a line between those two stars. You measure when the two stars are basically on top of one another and if you line them up with a plumb line that will give you true north."
According to astronomical data, 2,467 BC is the year in which the line that goes between the two stars passes exactly the trajectory of the pole.
"If they had started building on that date we would have a pyramid which is absolutely aligned to north. But the fact is they seemed to have started work about 11 years before that, which means it is still a few minutes off north.”
Other scholars say that the Great Pyramid was not intended to provide a detailed record of the Earth’s dimensions, but rather that it was conceived to illustrate the geometry of the universe and the Earth’s place in the cosmic scheme. It develops according to a ratio that governs both natural growth and celestial motion. It provides a parable to illustrate the regular patterns of life and growth, the geometrical conformity of the universe. The true physical dimensions of the Earth and of the planets were of less significance than the perfect figures to which they are fundamentally related. Although all natural forms of life and growth are based on clear geometrical principles, each displays certain individual variations that defy prediction, however, just as it is with each individual human. These are laws to which the universal body conforms, the exactness of the Universe in its Creation as we have pointed out before.
The relationship between the pyramid’s height and the perimeter of its base is that the first is equal to the radius of a circle of which the second is the circumference—in temple form this relates the proportions of the Central Universe to those of the outlying Universes, going back to what was originally said, that the
Universe is a temple form in an of itself, as is each succeeding smaller part of it down to the microcosm itself –individual man—and what we call the temple of the human body.



99
The geographical location of the Great Pyramid is latitude 30 degrees north, exactly one third of the distance from the Equator to the Pole. The Great Pyramid therefore stands at the very center of Egypt at a place which can also be taken as the center of the world. A geodetic survey by William Petrie showed the meridian line which runs due north and south and bisects the pyramid’s base contains more land and less sea than any other, and the Pyramid’s line of latitude, 30 degrees north, is also the one that crosses the greatest amount of dry land.
“On carefully summing up all the dry land habitable by man all the wide world over, the center of the whole falls within the Great Pyramid’s territory of Lower Egypt.”
This reflects the desire of the Sirians and Orion Atlanteans responsible for building it to spread their influence by using this connection to the center of the Universe, and to physically place the pyramid so that the energies from it could radiate out to as much of the Earth’s inhabitable area as possible for the control of the population, much as the Atlantean temple form was also used as a means of controlling the population.
Stonehenge also came from these civilizations, and was also begun in a time before the destruction of Atlantis, prior to 11,000 years ago or 9,000 BC, to add another ground-based relay station to this worldwide interconnection of sacred temple communicators. Much as we now have our worldwide system of satellites to tie the globe together with communications, the Sirians and Orion Atlanteans had theirs right on the planet itself, but to connect up far more than just the four corners of the planet.
Other Functions of the Pyramids
Approximately 7,000 years ago (5,000 BC) additions were also made to the pyramids to reactivate them as part of the temple grid system. This was done by Thoth/Horus himself as the temporary regeneration of Osiris. It took 6,000 years to complete. As were the multi-functioned pyramids, so too was Stonehenge built partly as a facility for the regeneration of cells much like the Temple of Rejuvenation in Atlantis. The reconstruction of Stonehenge I into Stonehenge II and III took place in time for the 2500 BC alignment, as were the early stages of the Pyramids at Gizeh.
“The Great Pyramid and other pyramids spiral an energy upward. But also the civilizations bring energy into Planet Earth through the pyramids. In the chambers of the pyramids, there are those which are rejuvenation chambers: they do preservation of cells.” (The Nine)
The massive stones of the Great Pyramid, Stonehenge and other such sites including the ones already described at Baalbek, were placed with the benefit of focused crystal energy and vocal sound attuned to the crystal—“with the sound ‘OM’ – and many voices,” say the Nine--a technique which is still in use in Tibet today.
To support this fact, John Michell has demonstrated in his works how the harmony of cultures can be maintained or destroyed by chanting.
“The pyramids in Mexico –some were created for the observation of those they called Gods, to help them come to create an energy field that released sound and color waves upon Planet Earth.”
One of the other major purposes of the pyramids, as most researchers now finally agree—was not for burial, a well placed cover story to hide their true purpose—but as an initiation chamber. From the introduction to The Emerald Tablets of Thoth:
“It should be understood that the Great Pyramid of Egypt has been and still is a temple of initiation into the mysteries. Jesus, Solomon, Apollonius and others were initiated there.”
And from the Tablets themselves:



100
“Brought He forth others and taught them wisdom; teachers, they, to the children of men. Placed He them on the island of Undal to stand as teachers of Light to men. Each of those who were thus chosen, taught must he be for years five and ten. Only thus could he have understanding to being Light to the children of men. Thus there came into being the Temple, a dwelling place for the Master of man.”
This was the foundation of the ‘Mystery Schools’ and the purpose for which its initiated ones were to serve. Each initiation, just like the ‘degrees’ in the secret societies, took one deeper and deeper into the true meaning of the mysteries and who it was they served.
In the pyramid there were seven levels of initiation, corresponding to the seventh dimensional level of the Orions (5th dimension for the Sirians), seven being the number of time, and of Lucifer—the Time-maker. Initiation as defined by Paul Twitchell is something which is “earned by the member of a spiritual group through spiritual unfoldment and service to God. The initiation is a private ceremony in which the individual is linked to the Sound and Light of God.”
Initiation, as described by Barbara Clow, is “an event in which higher energies are received into the person, permanently changing the energy frequency and functioning of that personality. Initiation was used to attune and empower an individual into spiritual service and continuing growth. Initiations are energy events, the lack of which may throw personality functions out of balance, and initiations borrowed from foreign cultures, may be dissident or indigestible to those who take them.”
The “Left Eye of Horus” series of initiations performed in the Great Pyramid, as described by Frissell, was a twelve-year “emotional-body” training for aspiring Egyptian initiates. It dealt with various emotions, feelings, fears, and both positive and negative aspects of the chakras. All the temples in Egypt were built for “Left-Eye of Horus” trainings. In this course, initiates worked with many different aspects of human nature. There is a specific fear related to each of the chakras, and each of the twelve major temples in Egypt dealt with the fear related to a specific chakra. The Eye of Horus in this particular case was the aperture through which the energies were transferred —a portal to other interdimensional realties.
Clow describes how an initiate is energized through one of the aligned openings in a temple. To picture it in your mind, remember the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is in the map room of the temple holding a staff with a crystal on top waiting for the sun to shine through the aperture and pinpoint the precise location where the Ark is buried.
“. . . the light comes in through a large quartz window above me on the left. In the center of the temple is the energy source. It is a pyramid about two feet tall, and the energy source is in the top of the pyramid. . . The light begins to illuminate the crystal above me to the left. The crystal is about a foot in diameter and the sun only shines through it like a laser beam and into the top of the pyramid when the sun is in the Bull. It is time, it is happening: the light forms the beam into the top of the capstone.”
According to Frissell, much of what one of his mentors, Drunvalo Melchizedek, presents in his Flower of Life information is a modern-day version of an ancient Egyptian mystery school, the symbol for which was the Right Eye of Horus. The right eye is controlled by the left brain, so this was primarily male knowledge, the logical side of how everything in life is interconnected.
“. . . In Egypt, the prerequisite for the right eye of Horus mystery school was two-fold. One, (purely chronological, you had to be at least 42 years of age, and two, you had to have had twelve years of rightbrain emotional-body training in a school known as the left Eye of Horus.”
On one final note, it is strange indeed that no burial accoutrements of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, the Gizeh pyramid kings, have ever been found. Perhaps this is explained by the true history of the pyramids as



101
presented in the introduction to the Emerald Tablets of Thoth where it tells some of Thoth’s accomplishments:
“For some 16,000 years, he ruled the ancient race of Egypt, from approximately 50,000 B.C. to 36.000 B.C. At that time, the ancient barbarous race among which he and his followers had settled had been raised to a high degree of civilization. Thoth was an immortal, that is, he had conquered death, passing only when he willed and even then not through death. His vast wisdom made him ruler over the various Atlantean colonies, including the ones in South and Central America.
“When the time came for him to leave Egypt, he erected the Great Pyramid over the entrance to the Great Halls of Amenti, placed in it his records and appointed guards for his secrets from among the highest of his people. In later times, the descendants of these guards became the pyramid priests by whom Thoth was deified as the God of Wisdom and as The Recorder by those in the age of darkness which followed his passing. In legend, the halls of Amenti became the underworld, the Halls of the Gods where the soul passed after death for judgment.”
The Sphinx
The Sphinx itself is the time capsule of Atlantis and its darkness. It was built about 500 years later than the pyramids, but has the very same alignment. Using computer simulations, Robert Bauval calculated that the Sphinx only makes sense if it were built with an alignment which corresponded with the Age of Leo, since the Sphinx has a leonine body with the head of a man. As he explains:
“It is here that the crux of the problem lies. To state the case briefly:
“The Sphinx, as we have seen, is an equinoctial marker—or ‘pointer.’ On a site that is as profoundly astronomical as Giza one would naturally expect an equinoctial monument dating from the ‘Age of Taurus’ either to have been built in the shape of a bull, or at any rate to symbolize a bull. The Sphinx, however, is emphatically leonine in form.
“It is a simple act of precession that one must go back to the ‘Age of Leo’ beginning at around 10500 BC in order to obtain the ‘correct’ sky-ground symbolism This, as it turns out, is the only epoch in which the due-east-facing Sphinx would have manifested exactly the right symbolic alignment on exactly the right day—watching the vernal sun rising in the dawn sky against the background of his own celestial counterpart.
“To clarify this latter notion, let us return to our computer simulation of the skies over Giza in 10,500 BC, instructing the program to recreate the positions of the sun and stars just before dawn on the spring equinox in that epoch. And let us set our direction of view due east in the line with the gaze of the Sphinx. Indeed, with the aid of a little virtual reality and poetic license, let us imagine that we are standing between the paws of the Sphinx itself at that date—a date that we already know accords rather well with the geology of the monument . . . There, culminating at the meridian at altitude 9 degrees 20’, we observe the three stars of Orion’s Belt forming a pattern in the sky that is identical to the ground plan of the Giza Pyramids.”
It was Thutmose IV, king of Egypt (1419-1386BC) of the 18th Dynasty, son of Amenhotep II, and grandson of Thutmose III who had a dream in the shadows of the Sphinx that the Sphinx told him to uncover the sands that were threatening to engulf it, and this he did. It was Thothmes III who dreamed of Amon-RA the god who “opened up for me the doors of Heaven; He spread open for me the portals of its horizon” that he could travel up and see Heaven.
“This is why the indigenous Egyptians who are still keeping the ancient Sirian knowledge will not allow excavation of certain sites, especially the tunnels under the Giza plateau. Beings from other systems are



102
constantly depositing things there because the main transducer of your planet is located under the Sphinx, and the Egyptians guard it.” (Clow)
The first pyramid of Egypt was historically said to have been designed by Imhotep, Prime Minister to Egyptian king Zoser-Neterkhet. Imhotep was said to be the son of Egypt’s most important “god” during his day: Ptah.
Egyptian theological texts from Memphis held that “there came into being” eight gods from the heart, tongue, teeth, lips, and other parts of the body of Ptah. Ptah followed up the bringing forth of these gods by assigning abodes and territories to them: “After he had formed the gods, he made cities, established districts, put the gods in their scared abodes; he built their shrines and established their offerings.” All that, he did “to make rejoice the heart of the Mistress of Life.”
Ptah, in ancient Egyptian mythology, was one of the greatest of gods. Ancient inscriptions describe him as "creator of the earth, father of the gods and all the beings of this earth, father of beginnings." Ptah was regarded as the great Vulcan of Egypt, and the High Priest of Ptah was the designated ‘Great Master Artificer,’ a symbolic name used in modern Freemasonry.
The famous alchemical mystery school of the White Brotherhood of the Therapeutate, from which an
eventual branch established the Essene community at Qumran, was operated by the priests of Ptah, the god of metallurgists, architects and masons. It was, in fact, Pharaoh Tuthmosis III who had reorganized the ancient mystery schools of Thoth and founded the Royal School of the Master Craftsmen at Karnak. They were called the Great White Brotherhood because of their preoccupation with a mysterious white powder. A branch of this fraternity became especially concerned with medicines and healing, to become known as the Egyptian Therapeutate under the reign of Thuthmosis III. Then, in much later times, the activities of the Therapeutate were extended into Palestine - especially into the Judah settlement of Qumrân where they flourished as the Essenes.
Egyptian lore written after Imhotep’s time adds that Imhotep had received the pyramid design in a plan “which descended to him from heaven to the north of Memphis (a city in ancient Egypt).” The Great Pyramid at Gizeh, which was then said to have been built several generations later during the “Age of the Pyramids,” was constructed according to the methods established by Imhotep. It was during this supposed Age of the Pyramids, which began around 2760 BC, that worship of the human-like “gods” reached its height; more than 2000 gods then existed. The many pyramids built after those at Gizeh are generally inferior and are viewed as imitations.
The Old Kingdom (ca. 2685-2180 BC) was followed by a period of weakness and unrest. Even the Great Pyramid of Cheops was broken into by unhappy Egyptians. According to historian Ahmed Fakhry:
“The Egyptians so hated the builders of the pyramids that they threatened to enter these great tombs and destroy the mummies of the kings (no mummies have ever been found or even closely related to these pyramids).”
Attempts by more modern pharaohs to duplicate the shape and size of the Great Pyramids built by their ‘ancestors’ resulted in many failures, and led to subsequent attempts being built in a more modest and ‘safe’ design:
“The collapse led to a hurried change in the angle of the second pyramid at Dashur to a flatter 43 degrees, resulting in the pyramid nicknamed the Bent Pyramid. This led to the construction, also at Dashur, of the third Sneferu pyramid. Considered the ‘first classical pyramid’ of a pharaoh, its sides slope up at the safe angle of about 43 1⁄2 degrees. It was built of local pink limestone and was therefore nicknamed the Red



103
Pyramid. Protrusions on the sides were intended to hold in place a surfacing of white limestone; but that did not stay put for long, and today the pyramid is seen in its original reddish hue.”
This third attempt by Sneferu, the red Pyramid of Sneferu, is considered the first successful emulation by a pharaoh and his architects of the Great Pyramids. It was built circa 2600 BC.
Much modern research has gone into trying to calculate how the original pyramids and the Sphinx were built. Most of them have been calculated based on the use of purely human labor and simple technology. The idea of slaves hauling great stones on wooden rollers is the most common conception of how the pyramids were built. Commander F. M. Barber, an American naval attaché who was stationed in Egypt at the end of the last century wrote an informed booklet entitled Mechanical Triumphs of The Ancient Egyptians. In it, he figured that the causeway needed to build the Great Pyramid to its present height of 120 feet above the Nile, would have had an incline of 1 foot in 25, which he considered a very easy grade for a greased stoneway.
Barber estimated that it would take a force of 900 men harnessed in double rank on four draft ropes to drag a 60-ton monolith up such an incline. On the causeway the men would cover a space 225 feet long by 16 feet wide, which Barber considered a sufficiently compact and manageable force. To build such an immense and sufficient causeway would take as much stone as did the Great Pyramid itself.
One curious aspect of the Great Pyramid that modern historians and scientists have not ‘figured out’, is how an iron plate with mysterious traces of gold in it was used to cover the mouth of the southern shaft. Even for their much later estimate of the building of the pyramids in the mid 3rd century BC, its presence suggests that the Iron Age too began many centuries before Egyptologists had calculated it to have started.
Chapter 15 Egypt: The Tree Spreads Its Branches
When, after much trial and error breathtakingly described and recorded in antiquity, a “perfect model” was attained; Ninharsag held him up and shouted: “My hands have made it!”
Many people identify ancient Egyptian religion with the worship of animals. This type of veneration was unknown, however, during the early period of the Egyptian civilization, according to Professor James Henry Breasted:
“. . . the hawk, for example, was the sacred animal of the sun-god, and as such a living hawk might have a place in the temple, where he was fed and kindly treated, as any such pet might be, but he was not worshipped, nor was he the object of an elaborate ritual as later. The portrayal of the gods with the heads of certain animals related to the masks they often wore to hide their true features, and to symbolize in people’s minds the characteristics of that animal.”
One of the best known texts from ancient Egypt is The Book of the Dead, the common name by which this sacred volume is known. In Egyptian hieroglyphics the name is written: Per-m-hru. Egyptologists translate ‘per’ as ‘coming forth’, ‘hru’ as ‘day’ and ‘m’ is a preposition meaning “from” –thus it is usually subtitled “The coming forth by day” and refers to a time when the gods would come forth from their temples, prior to their ‘departure’ in 3500 BC.



104
The Book of the Dead is a large collection of funerary texts of various dates containing magical formulas, hymns, and prayers believed by the ancient Egyptians to guide and protect the soul (Ka) in its journey into the region of the dead (Amenti). Egyptians believed that the knowledge of these texts enabled the soul to ward off demons attempting to impede its progress, and to pass the tests set by the 42 judges in the hall of Osiris, god of the underworld. These texts also indicated that happiness in the afterlife was dependent on the deceased’s having led a virtuous life on Earth (the origins of the Christian belief in Heaven and the devil in Hell). The earliest religious (funerary) texts known were found cut in hieroglyphs on the walls inside the pyramids of the kings of the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom; these became known as the Pyramid Texts. A famous example is found in the pyramid of Unas (reigned about 2428-2407BC), the last king of the 5th Dynasty.
In the first Intermediate Period and in the Middle Kingdom private individuals had these texts painted on coffins, from which the alternate name Coffin Texts is derived. By the 18th Dynasty the texts were inscribed on papyri placed in the mummy case; these papyri being frequently from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) long and illustrated in color.
The title “Book of the Dead” is misleading; the texts do not form a single connected work and do not belong to one period. Given their extraordinary antiquity, however, it seems strange that they are not better known to the public. Most people have heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are from a much later epoch (c. 100BC) and much less interesting documents. According to one researcher, the fact that the Pyramid texts have been so neglected by most people is a mystery in itself. Again facts such as these make one suspect the cover up of history for some, growingly apparent, reason.
The Pyramid texts themselves are full of references to the seed of Ra-Atum:
“. . . To which the Osiris-king responds, “it is I who am the “seed” of the god which is in you [PT 1416-7] . . . the Osiris-king is an imperishable star, son of the sky-goddess [1469] . . . O Ra-Atum, this Osiris-king comes to you, an imperishable spirit. . . your son comes to you . . . [PT 152].
Here again we get a pointer to something, unbelievable to modern man who has been programmed to believe differently, though quite acceptable in the ancient of days—the literal seed of Lucifer manifesting here on Earth. It was not only his seed, but also the planter, Lucifer himself. The purpose? Remember the comment in The Island of Dr. Moreau about the cause of the trouble—the Lucifer gene? Lucifer’s idea was to plant his ‘seed’ (his self-will) in the population here on Earth, and hence his seven incarnations of which we have already had one. Seven being the number of time, and in Time, after seven different and significant incarnations, his seed would be propagated in just about all of us. The Osiris-king is not just speaking figuratively when he says he is “the son of the God that is within you,” but also literally.
Remember the childhood game of Chutes and Ladders—more appropriately known in the English version as Snakes and Ladders. For the upward path on the Tree of Life, there is always the downward pull as well. One of the earliest dreams that was had with relation to this work was one in which a book was being read, a history book with a brown paper cover, the only problem was that the book inside the cover was upside down. As we shall see, the history the ‘controllers’ had wanted us to see, especially that relating to Lucifer and his intentions for this planet and its people, consists of nothing but ‘smoke and mirrors’ and has been turned upside down. Egypt was the source of the first major steps towards changing and covering up our true history.
A very good example of this is in the Tarot, where we are learning a new language. A language is only as precise as the meanings given each word. With the language of Tarot, our words are the upright and reversed meanings we give each card. Meanings have been assigned to Tarot cards for modern day



105
phenomena such as high technology, meditation, and psychotherapy. These meanings give the unconscious the tools to speak to us in our modern, everyday language.
The work of Laurence Garner and Zecharia Sitchin and others is showing the modern world how differently history can appear if the words of the ancient texts are only interpreted correctly and applied to a modern day level of understanding.
Time and False Science
The Great Pyramid, as well as being a transporter, an initiation chamber, an obvious place of healing, and an energy transmitter and receiver, was also a time machine.
Remember the words spoken to Thoth by his omnipotent guide in The Emerald Tablets:
“Know ye, O man, that all that exists has being only because of the Law. Know ye the Law and ye shall be free, never be bound by the fetters of night. “. . . Seek ye and learn that Time is the secret whereby ye may be free of this space.”
Understanding Time has been the key to controlling the future and setting into place the Great Plan of the New World Order. Why have so many people slaved so hard to set up an agenda for a time and date so far in the future, one that they, in one lifetime, would not reap the benefits of? The answer lies in the manipulation and control of both Time and the reincarnational cycle, which, in effect, are one and the same thing.
Because of its importance to a fuller understanding of how we and our history have been manipulated, we shall take a brief respite here from our journey to take a look at how this has been done through ‘false science’ and the possession by certain groups of ancient mystical knowledge of exactly how Creation works. Remember as you read this section that it was the scientists and technologists who took over control of Atlantis and caused its eventual decline. It is these same scientists and technologists, along with others, who now control Mankind’s destiny through the manipulation of Creation and its processes.
How does one make a time machine? Kryon explains the basics of how this works and some of the associated phenomena relating to spacecraft and how they travel, both through space as well as through time:
“Gravity is an absolute product of the attributes of mass and time, one of which you may change. (Time is a co-efficient in anti-gravity spaceships). Gravity is related to time. The entire issue of gravity, mass and time is nonlinear.
“Density is the key to actual measured mass. Most of the Universe is made of elements that support simple size/density ratios. It’s when scientist find the objects that don’t behave this certain way that they are mystified. Remember this: Your observations are restricted to your own time frame.
“Magnetics and electricity play a critical part in the determination of the real attributes of mass, and the magnetic variables that determine the mass product, are often working within very small particles to create the density of an object and also its time frame! It is the small-particle mechanics which actually determine the mass attributes of an object and therefore the gravity and time frame surrounding the object. (Thus the microcosm truly does create the macrocosm, just as the individual cells of our body make up the body as a whole, and also the time-frame in which it exists). Can you imagine an object with zero density—no matter what the size? Very little in the universe exists in this condition, but it can be artificially created, simply using the density mechanics of what determines an object’s actual mass.
“While you are pondering it, also consider negative mass, negative energy, and gravity that is reversed!



106
“Experimenting with a magnetic field’s lines of influence running at right angles to another electric field will bring you gratification in your search to alter the mass of an object. These are the mechanics to actually temporarily change small particle polarity behavior, which translates to density, the lack of it, or its reverse (negative density). Be cautious, for you will also be creating a small time displacement, which can be dangerous to you physically until you understand how objects in altered time displacements correctly interact (one of the difficulties associated with the Philadelphia Experiment).
“Do not make any assumptions about the shape of the interacting magnetic and electric fields, or what the medium should be to carry the polarity properties in such a system. Remember, however, that gas and liquid metals can also be used effectively to carry a charge. Do not be surprised if water under pressure also plays an important part in this system.
“A true massless object no longer obeys the laws of your time frame physics. Wild starts and stops,
speed and turns are all well within the realm of a massless object, since it creates its own energy influence. Because of the very slight time displacement, it tends to change the number of electrons within the atoms directly in contact with it. This is a clue on how to detect a massless object, even if you can’t see it. This should also now explain the magnetic anomalies around the UFO experiences that you have documented (many UFOs on film appear ‘blurry’ or fuzzy’ because of this associated time differential between the UFO and other things around it in our time).”
“Gravitational anomalies of Earth can create havoc with a system such as this, and this is why sometimes the vehicles crash (such as in Roswell after the nuclear testing had upset the Earth’s magnetic grid system in that area).
“Much of the technical advancement in this field will be to apply very high and low density attributes to smaller and smaller amounts of matter, and it is the understanding of small particle polarity and behavior that is the key to all of this.”
One of the best sources on the cover-up of scientific knowledge is The Suppression of Vital Data in Physics by Byron Weeks. Weeks describes how the public is continually manipulated and our evolution and progress substantially restricted by the suppression, destruction, and/or alteration of significant, important information.
He refers in particular to an alteration of Maxwell’s equations which resulted from Maxwell’s extensive research into electro-magnetism. These alterations drastically affected the entire course of “mainstream” science and physics forever afterward, notably in the information made available to scientists and physicists of the time such as Einstein, as well as the subsequent conceptual framework which Einstein arrived at. To cut to the chase, the missing link which would provide the key to the unified field theory was deliberately cut out of Maxwell’s equations by a rather sinister group of scientists before Maxwell’s work was presented to the scientific community and the world. Of course his original work and all the implications thereof were and are now known to the covert world government, as are the resultant advanced sciences and applications of this knowledge to very high technology.
This technology is all being implemented in the furtherance of unquestionably Dark agendas and goals; with consequences which are most certainly destructive to nearly every significant aspect of human life here on the planet and even beyond. In Val Valerian’s view, this is, in part, due to “. . .a general state of mind which has no understanding of, respect for, and connection with nature and the earth with its multitude of life forms; a state of mind which is the product of our current dehumanized, mechanistic and massively mind controlled (through every available means) existence at the hands of the worldwide covert government and its super hi-tech arsenal of mind manipulating technologies.”



107
Valerian finds the information extremely relevant to what is known about the work of Wilhelm Reich, who shall come up again throughout our journey, especially with regard to what he called “orgone” energy; some characteristics of which are “electromagnetic” in nature but outside of the commonly understood “EM” frame of reference. Both Weeks’ work and Valerian’s observations confirm what Kryon has suggested and make it obvious that anti-gravity machines and time machines are very probable if not definitely possible. From Weeks’ book:
“For thousands of years, many discoveries have been suppressed from the populations of the planet in order to keep them in bondage. The burning of the libraries of Alexandria is one example of how information can be suppressed. Another example would be the common technique of suppression of scientific information by alteration of the information itself.
“Perhaps the most blatant and far reaching alteration of data was the alteration of Maxwell’s equations. James Clerk Maxwell was a mathematical genius who lived in the late l9th century. His original work, which is available to covert scientific departments in the government, had the potential to radically alter the entire course of our civilization.
“It is certainly clear to most of you by now that the human population can be easily manipulated by electronic means using various methods developed through the military-industrial complex. What may not be clear to you is that many of the EM effects can be initiated from outside of what is normally seen as the electromagnetic spectrum. Just as a magnetic field in a wire is at right angles to the current flow, other fields and waveforms exist that are an integral part of the electromagnetic spectrum, yet exist at a certain number of right-angle rotations (orthogonal rotations) away from the electromagnetic field components we are normally accustomed to. If these hyper-spatial components, which are not subject to the usual electromagnetic constraints of time and space, are generated and manipulated, they can in turn generate EM effects that have the capability to influence human biology and consciousness. “
Weeks then goes on to take a brief look at how and by whom the equations of Maxwell were changed, “in order to make subsequent open scientific development that would have influenced civilization in a positive way impossible.”
The following section by Valdamar Valerian, from his book Matrix III, Volume One, contains information about the massive deception and manipulation of scientific concepts which so extensively impacts our view of “reality” in this present day materialistic culture:
“In late 1864, James Clerk Maxwell published his epic material on electromagnetic waves. His material dealt not only with electrical and magnetic waves, but also the relativistic/ethereal psychoactive component of these waves (representing electromagnetics of the second order and above). The equations also included transformations that enabled the change from inertial frames of reference to non-inertial frames of reference. Maxwell’s original equations were written in Quaternion notation, a complex mathematical system available at that time before Vector Analysis was introduced by Oliver Heaviside. Today’s generalized equivalent of Quaternions is Tensors.
“In short, Maxwell’s original work gave the necessary information for gravitational propulsion and
psychoactive devices. Someone somewhere recognized this, for shortly after his death, the mathematician Oliver Heaviside, the chemist Willard Gibbs, and physicist Heinrich Hertz decided to “edit” or “interpret” Maxwell’s famous equations which were, in the original form, the foundations of electromagnetics and Unified Field Theory (UFT). This “unholy trio”, especially Heaviside, disregarded the Quaternions or Scalar components of Maxwell’s original equations, because they represented potentials and not fields. He thought



108
potentials were akin to “mysticism”, because “everybody knows” that fields contain mass, and mass cannot be created from apparently nothing, which is what potentials are, both literally and mathematically; they are an accumulation or reservoir of energy. Furthermore, not only did they throw away the gravitational component with the Quaternion/Scalar, but also postulated that gravitation and electromagnetisms were mutually exclusive, not interdependent. That was the death blow to subsequent efforts by scientists to realize a functioning unified field theory. Because of this one act, electromagnetism was reduced from its original five dimensions to only four: X, Y, Z, and time. The element of G was removed.
“Because of this deliberate act, twenty-two other errors exist today in electromagnetic theory. The very concepts of force, mass and charge are ill-defined, and the so-called “static” electrical charge has been discovered by Quantum mechanics not to be static at all, but to move rotationally by virtue of the quantum mechanical spin. Finally, adding insult to injury, the so-called “imaginary components” of Maxwell’s original equations as well as the mutilated version of the equations have also been discarded or ignored. With this last error, the door to hyper-spatial domains was forever closed, for the present mathematics and physics of electromagnetic theory do not allow for hyper-spatial domains (domains outside of three dimensions), superluminal signals (signals that exceed the speed of light or are infinite in speed), and a unified field theory.
“The edited version of Maxwell’s work, which every physicist and engineer has had to contend with, discards electro-gravitation, and avoids the unification of gravitation and electromagnetics. It also prevents the direct engineering of gravitation, space-time, time flow rates, free energy devices, and quantum changes, which is viewed by the altered equations that are vector-based as only a statistical change. The quaternion approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curvature of space-time. Heaviside wrote a subset of Maxwell’s equations where this capability is excluded.
“Dr. Henry Monteith has independently discovered that Maxwell’s original quaternion theory was a unified field theory. Einstein assumed, because he only had access to the altered equations, that curving space-time could only be achieved by the weak gravitational force due to mass, that the local frame would always be a Lorentz frame, which would mean that all operations would be constrained to “conservation laws of physics”.
“In the 1960’s the Hertz (Hz) replaced Cycles Per Second. Since, then everyone thinks that all electromagnetic waves are hertzian. Only the upper portion of the spectrum before Infrared contains Hertzian waves. ELF and ULF are not; waves in biosystems and natural phenomena are not Hertzian in nature.”
Why do we continue to tolerate this manipulation and control over every aspect of our lives? Why do the media and the school system supposed to educate and inform us, people who are supposed to debate these ideas, surrender to their suppression? Because of the loss of our history and the grooves and patterns that have been dug in our minds and those of our forebears for untold millennia.
Those of us who have chosen to live at this time are the forerunners of an almost new species. It is human, yet we are at the same time actually manifesting heaven on Earth. We are receiving extra help from masters and extraterrestrials, angelic beings, and learning to go inward. The more we are able to go in and listen to that still quiet voice within us, the more we will be in tune with the changes that are occurring around us, and free of this ultimate form of control. As one writer puts it, “These INUTTERABLE CRIMES which have been committed in the ludicrous notion that MAN HAS DOMINION OVER ANYTHING. . . So I ran the gamut of feelings from sad to mad to sobs of pure pain.”



109
The Keys of Enoch, although The Book of Enoch is obviously Nibiruan in origin, can be looked at as one of the more scientific treatises on the Earth’s transformation, the ascension process, and the role of the hierarchy and extraterrestrial masters.
The Chronology of the Known Ancient Egypt
Egyptian traditions hold that long before the modern era of Egypt, the country was ruled by gods and demigods. Manetho puts it that “in times immemorial “Gods of Heaven” came to Earth from the Celestial Disc after a great flood had inundated Egypt.”
“A very great god who had come to Earth in the earliest times” raised the land from under the waters by ingeniously damming, dyking, and land reclamation works.
From those earliest days of Zep Tepi, the chronology of ancient Egypt begins, as Sitchin points out, about circa 3200 BC, when “a dynastic race” arrived in Egypt and a man named Menes ascended the throne of Egypt. Archaeological sources also indicate this emergence, by about 3200 BC, of a dominant political force that was to become the consolidating element in the first united kingdom of ancient Egypt. It was then that the gods (just as they had in Sumer) granted Egypt civilization and what we now call Religion. The earliest known hieroglyphic writing also dates from this period.
The word ‘hieroglyph’ refers to the sacred Egyptian writings or secret ciphers—‘hiero’ meaning ‘gods‘, from which the Greeks called their gods ‘heros’. ‘Glyph’ means ‘symbols’ or ‘writing’, thus ‘the writing of the gods’ just as ‘hierogamus’ meant ‘marriage to the gods’ (what some like to refer to as ‘gods’ games’).
The runes of ancient Germany and Scandinavia were very similar, the word ‘rune’ meaning ‘secret’. Like the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt, the runes were said to have been given to mankind by a great god, Odin, the King of the Gods. Odin, however, was only able to obtain this wisdom after he traded an eye in exchange for it. The eye he would have traded for it if either the Left or the Right, would have been the Right-the female energy that was from then on subjugated to the Right or male eye. It is said that Odin sought the knowledge of the Eye of Horus, and it was this secret knowledge which gave Odin command over the other gods and symbolic rulership over the morphogenetic grid of the planet. Odin then dispensed the knowledge of the runes to Mankind so that they could themselves keep the archetypal powers in check. The runic symbols all conform to precise geometric angles and relationships.
Soon, during these early days of the ‘modern era’ of Egypt, the names of rulers began to appear on monuments. This period began with a 0 Dynasty, which had as many as 13 rulers, ending with Narmer (about 3100 BC), followed by the 1st and 2nd dynasties (about 3100-2755 BC), with at least 17 kings. Some of the earliest massive mortuary structures (so-called predecessors of the pyramids) were built at Saqqârah, Abydos, and elsewhere during the 1st and 2nd dynasties.
Like Moses, whose body was carried to a secret burial spot, the tomb of Imhotep, vizier of the pharaoh Zoser and venerated much later as a god of medicine, is one of those burial sites of famous Egyptians not yet found. Imhotep, (circa 2650 B.C.), was an ancient Egyptian priest, officer, and builder who is credited as the architect of the earliest of all Egyptian pyramids. Some scholars assert that this engineering feat would earn Imhotep, who served during the 3rd Dynasty, the honor of being the earliest known scientist. In the centuries after his death, Imhotep's memory became increasingly linked to far greater (and more dubious) achievements in medicine, the arts, and other fields. He was one of few ancient Egyptians born outside of royalty who later was raised to a godlike rank.



110
Born as a commoner near the ancient city of Memphis, located along the Nile River south of modernday Cairo, Imhotep rose to become an influential official, sculptor, and carpenter in Zoser's court.
Imhotep's greatest achievement was undoubtedly the erection of the pyramid complex at Sakkara, called the world's first large-scale stone building by modern-day ‘experts’. Before Imhotep's time, such tombs were covered by large, low rectangular buildings called mastabas. At Sakkara, however, Imhotep designed the first pyramid: a structure that featured a mastaba topped by six tiers, each of diminishing size. He surrounded this 200-foot-tall monument, which has become known as the Step Pyramid, with an elaborate building complex that included temples, a burial chamber, sculptures of Zoser, and pavilions. Much of the expansive stone complex was connected by a system of underground passages.
The Step Pyramid and some of the surrounding stone buildings—built around 2630 B.C.—still stand today; archeologists are working to restore more of the complex.
Though designing and building the Step Pyramid were certainly great feats, Imhotep's name has also been tied to other monumental—and far less certifiable—achievements. Later Egyptian kingdoms celebrated the famous architect's skills as a poet, sage, physician, and religious leader. Boosted by his impressive posthumous reputation, Imhotep was deified some 2,000 years after his death by the Egyptian dynasty. Few Egyptians born outside of royalty were ever honored with such a distinction. Later still, the Greeks idealized Imhotep, particularly touting his divine powers as a healer. During the Roman Period, his tomb in Sakkara was believed to be a shrine where many people made pilgrimages from afar to seek cures for their ails.
In the 1960s researchers uncovered a new ruin in Sakkara that is thought to be Imhotep's burial place. Whether or not scientists can verify this assertion— like some of the lofty achievements in medicine, art, and philosophy credited to Imhotep—may never be answered with certainty.
Walter Emery, working for the Egypt Exploration Society, conducted an excavation between 1965 and 1970 looking for it. He chose a site in north Sakkara, west of the 3rd Dynasty tombs, which was believed to be the center of a popular healing cult in later times. His dig revealed shaft burials and a network of underground catacombs dating to Greco-Roman times. Mummified ibises (Thoth) and hawks (Ra) were found stacked from rock-bed to ceiling. The ibis birds were encased in clay jars, some of their wrappings were beautifully decorated with the images of deities. He also found shafts containing mummified baboons and a cemetery of cows (Hathor), which were the mothers of the sacred Apis bulls; one skull was intact, in a decorated clay plaster casing.
Few visitors to Saqqârah today realize that the Apis tombs lay at the end of a processional avenue, known as the Serapeum Way, which in Greco–Roman times, extended from the cultivated land near the mortuary temple of Teti westwards to the Serapeum; the whole avenue was lined with sphinxes and chapels and as visitors made their way westwards to leave votive offerings at the Serapeum, they passed the statues of Greek philosophers.
The avenue had long been buried beneath garbage dumps and modern buildings, but in 1976/77 the Egypt Exploration Society conducted a survey, and subsequent excavation of the mortuary temple of the pyramid of Teti. The aim was to examine Late Period temple precincts and catacombs where deified animals were interred. A burial ground for cats (Bast) was discovered, and also one for the jackal (Anubis), the animal associated with Anubis, the god concerned with mummification. Cats and jackals were kept to ward off ‘unwanted’ astral entities, so called shape-shifters, whose intent may be to steal the astral spirit of the departed and prevent them from getting to the Afterlife. Since cats and jackals commonly hunt at night, their vision is supposed to include the ability to see astral entities. This is one of the reasons they were kept in



111
Egyptian temples, to keep away unwanted negative forces. (The 1999 movie The Mummy explains well the use of cats for warding off the ‘undead.’)
Each of these animals was brought to this planet by its particular space-god from their home planet, just as sheep and grain were brought by the Annunaki to ancient Mesopotamia. The genes of the god’s particular animal were used to create an image that the god wished to portray to his followers in a holographic or mass hypnosis form, much as was later done when ‘God’ appeared between the two angels on top of the Ark of the Covenant. That is the reason for the large number of mummified animals and birds, each animal having been used for a single appearance in ‘the coming forth by day’ of the gods.
Imhotep is important to our story because in later incarnations he was also Paul (Saul) who was responsible for making Christianity what it later became, as well as Brigham Young, who was responsible for also making Mormonism what it is today. One can see in his life as Imhotep the characteristics that became so important to his later incarnations—especially his vast knowledge of what we are calling ‘temple technology’. He is in fact incarnated today also as a very influential person in a ‘thriving’ young religion.
Cylinder seals, and certain artistic and architectural motifs in Egypt which have their prototype in Mesopotamia, raise the question as to what extent Egypt was inspired by Mesopotamia, and of how there arose the doubtful theory of a “Dynastic-race’, the builders of the royal tombs conquering and ruling over the native peoples, the builders of the subsidiary tombs.
Zecharia Sitchin, in his discussions of the Annunaki of ancient Mesopotamia, suggests that much of Egyptian history was tied to the participation and influence of the Annunaki. The fact is they had very little to do with each other. Each had its own area of influence, which sometimes overlapped due to their proximity. The Annunaki were a ‘subservient’, although somewhat rebellious group of followers of the Sirian and Orion races, as already explained. They are, however, the major race responsible for creation of the double-helix strand of DNA that created the slave race of humans that we have now become. There influence is still with us on many levels, just is that of the Dark forces from Sirius and Orion, especially in the form of walk-ins, Orion robots, extra-dimensional puppeteers, and also as incarnated Beings.
Unfortunately, in Egyptology when it was yet young, scholars were wont to do the same thing as Sitchin by attributing evidence of cultural contact to conquest.
For example, the discovery of pre-dynastic Lower Egyptian-type pottery in Upper Egypt was interpreted as the subduing of Upper Egypt by the tribes of Lower Egypt. Evidence of the Horus clan, traditionally settlers in the Delta, setting up settlements as far south as Edfu was likewise attributed to conquest. When, therefore, such items as an ivory knife-handle were excavated from Gebel el Arak, revealing a style of art unfamiliar to Egypt, when cylinder seals of undoubted Mesopotamian origin came to light, and when the recessed paneling of the first monumental architecture in Egypt showed similarities with that of Mesopotamia, the idea of conquest took root. Like many other imaginative but historically unsupported theories, the notion defies efforts at explosion simply because our history has been so confused that it has been a major project to decipher it.
To attribute the beginning of dynastic history to conquest gives a distorted picture of thousands of years of cultural development and diffusion during which the settlers of the Nile valley gradually moved from primitive society towards what we call civilization. There is no doubt that Egypt’s contacts with Mesopotamia provoked them to more rapid advancement towards the end of the pre-dynastic period. Had the people of the Nile valley not felt the growing need to record data, however, they would have remained unreceptive to the Mesopotamian method of writing. Borrowing from another culture is a natural process of cultural growth. Furthermore, this type of borrowing should not be interpreted differently from that of 2,000 years earlier when

Egypt was ripe for the development of agriculture but lacking suitable varieties of grain during the Neolithic period, domestic barley was imported from Asia.
This is an important concept for it explains the willingness of the Hebrew nation in their early formative years to look to Egypt for help and as a place of succor when times were difficult.
Ancient Ugarit (Ra’s Shamra) was in the center of these two nations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, located as it was in what is now western Syria. From 1929 to the present, excavations by the French at Ra’s Shamra have produced thousands of tablets belonging to the period between 1400 and 1200BC, written in Ugaritic. Many of these are literary in character, describing the exploits of the gods of the Canaanite religion, among them the storm deity Baal (title of Hadad) mentioned frequently in the Old Testament. Baal is also the abbreviated version of a longer name used specifically to describe Lucifer, Ba’al-zebub or Belezebub. Moreover, the poetry of Ugarit has strong affinities with that of the Bible. They share much in the way of vocabulary, structure, and the use of figures of speech and other literary devices.
Reflecting the influences of both Egypt and Mesopotamia, and extrapolating upon the idea of kingship on Earth being related to a direct or traceable lineage to the gods, kings of Ugarit such as Keret, at least were thought to be in some way divine. J. Gray (Sacral Kingship in Ugarit, Ugaritica VI p.293) suggests, however, that we should not overpress the significance of this exclamation, which he takes rather as an illustration of the development of popular reverence for the king. If any such identification between the king and the god as has sometimes been suggested did in fact exist, we should expect to find some textual or inscriptional evidence, he suggests. A possible hint at such a belief is, however, to be found in the list of the kings of Ugarit mentioned in a historical survey. Each of the kings’ names is preceded by the word ‘god’, Ugarit being an ancient outpost of Atlantis as well, one which survived but only barely.
In the excavations at Ugarit, a total of eleven campaigns had preceded the outbreak of the Second World War, and until 1935 excavations continued in the region of Minet el-Beida as well as on the tell. On the mound itself, excavations revealed most notably the Temple of Baal, the Temple of Dagan, and the house of the high-priest which included a library containing numerous texts.
The layout was obviously Atlantean in form with the temple in the center. And who was the temple dedicated too? Ba’al, Ba’al-zebub or Belezebub, who we know as Lucifer.
In a review of the book, Ugarit and die Bibel by Oswald Loretz, the reviewer, Marvin H. Pope, mentions the treatment by Loretz of the relationship between Ugarit and Canaan, and among other things its literature, its writing systems, misunderstood and mistranslated words in the Bible that have been elucidated by Ugaritic; the Psalms; Ugaritic and biblical gods; the Assembly of Gods at Ugarit and in the Bible; Gods,
Goddesses, and Demons; El as Creator of the World and Father of Humanity; BA ‘l as storm and rain god; Ba ‘l’s foes; YW = YHWH?; the hero Danel; Enthronement of Ba ‘l and Yahwe from the temporal to the
eternal Kingdom of Yahwe; from the Scapegoat (Lev 16) to Paul’s words, “women should be quiet in church”; sacrifice in Ugarit and Israel; alcohol and sex in Ugarit and the Bible; necromancy and the Marzih celebration; inquiry and control of the future, omenology; the art of incantation and medicine; from extispicy to the Law of Moses; the inquiry of the future through liver-inspection in Ugarit and pre-Exilic Israel; astronomy and astrology; medicine, nature and world; the origin of the world; El-Yahwe, Creator of the World?; Ba ‘l creator-god beside or after El?; the palace of the victor on the holy mountain; Ugaritic texts and history of the patriarchs; from the Habiru in Ugarit to the Hebrews in the Bible; the Reed Sea (the Red Sea)and the Song of Miriam; art in Canaan and Israel; was there a statue of Yahwe?; wisdom of life—human destiny.

The final brief chapter, entitled “Von der Ugarit-texten zur Bibel,” deals with results and perspectives and the overall impact of the discoveries at Ugarit on biblical studies and the nature of Israel’s debt to the
Canaanites. The central issue here is the nature and degree of Canaanite influence on the religion of Israel. The last two sentences of the book put the present state of the question succinctly: “The opening up of the Canaanite background of biblical writings through the Ugaritic Texts allows us to recognize that our reconstruction of the past is built only on fragments of a much richer tradition and that we therefore are still far from an historical anthropology or an anthropological history of the Canaanites and the people who produced the Bible. Yet the Ugaritic texts help us in a welcome way to measure the strangeness of the past of the Canaanites, Israelites and Jews and our cultural distance from them better than before.”
That Lucifer, as Ba’l (Baal), had a great influence in Ugarit is made evident by the importance placed on the Temple of Baal by its location on the central mound of Ugarit, the energy source or focus point where heaven and earth energies blended in the Atlantean temple form. That His worship was an aspect of early Ugarit and Canaan is also suggested by the various mentions of practices related to sorcery and black magic. And lastly, there is a strong suspicion that Ba’l and the gods known as El and Yahwe (h) are indeed one and the same god, better known as Jehovah.
Amenhotep IV/Hebrews
The ancient lands that now comprise Israel were also a land which lay between the two powerful nations of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia and drew influence from both, including its choice of gods. As we shall see it was also the area and the nation which inherited the power that had flowed through both of these two mentors in the millennia prior to its rise.
In 1936-37 Egyptian archeologist Selim Hassan excavated a mud-brick wall around the Sphinx, apparently built to hold back drifting sand. He found bricks stamped “Thutmose IV” and scores of small stele with inscriptions invoking Hor-em-akhet. Six of those show a statue of a striding king standing before the Sphinx, further evidence of a statue, supposedly of Ra, that was once thought to have been erected there.
As masterfully explained in his monumental work, Bloodline of the Holy Grail, Laurence Gardner describes the relationship to ancient Egypt of a number of the founding fathers of the Hebrew nation, an important next step in following the Atlantean power structure and the so-called ‘ancient mysteries’ into the modern world, the power of Lucifer here on Earth.
Joseph and Moses are not mentioned in any Egyptian texts under those names, although both were said by the Bible to be great in the land of Egypt. Moses is positively cited in Exodus (2:19) as ‘an Egyptian’. In Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus says that Moses was commander of the Egyptian army in the war against Ethiopia. Only after he left were the rest of the Israelites put into captivity. Tracing the events narrated in the Old Testament through Egyptian texts, however, Gardner finds that it was during the reign of Ramses II (1304-1237 BC) that Semitic people were settled in the land of Goshen, having left Canaan for want of food. So it was in the 15th century BC, not 18th as suggested by standard Biblical chronology, that Joseph was appointed Chief Minister to the pharaoh, Thothmosis IV (c. 1413-1405) under the name of Yuya. Israel/Jacob had taken his family into Egypt to avoid a famine, and there multiplied until led out by Moses. It was a period of approximately 400 years between Joseph, the son of Israel, and Joseph the vizier known as Yuya. They are not one and the same person.
Joseph the vizier also became the father of a pharaoh, however: “God hath made me a father of a Pharaoh” (Genesis 45:8). His mummy, which has been found in the Valley of Kings, is unusual. Among his



114
attributions is listed ‘Father of the Lord of Two Lands’ (Egypt-the Pharaoh and Israel-Moses). His son, Pharaoh Akhenaton, was responsible for initiating the ‘One God’ concept in Egypt, a concept brought directly from Ugarit and Canaan from whence they had come.
His older son became Chancellor of Lower Egypt, High Priest of Heliopolis and Divine father of the nation. But it was his younger son, Aye, who held the special distinction ‘Father of God’ and became Pharaoh in 1352 BC—as did other descendants of Yusuf-Yuya, including the now famous Tutankhamun.
Thothmosis IV was the pharaoh responsible for cleaning the sands away from the Sphinx as he was instructed to do in a dream. He was then followed by Amenhotep III. Amenhotep, as tradition held, married his sister but also married Joseph’s daughter Tiye. Fearing the growing power the Israelites were gaining in Egypt, however, it was decreed that no child of Tiye’s could be Pharaoh. Thus when Tiye had a child, it was decreed that it should be put to death at birth if it were a son. Tiye arranged to have the child at her summer palace at Zarw, and since it was a boy, arranged with the midwives to sail the baby down the stream in a reed basket, as the Bible describes, to the home of her father Joseph’s half-brother, Levi.
The boy, Aye or Amanda (born around 1394 BC), was one day to be known as Moses. He was educated by the Egyptian priests of Ra, and went on to live in Thebes as a teenager, taking the name of Akhenaton because of his belief in the one god, Aton, rather than believing in the pantheon of Egyptian gods. By this time, his mother had gained more power than the queen who had not been able to bear sons, only a daughter—Nefertiti.
Pharaoh Amenhotep suffered a period of ill health, and there was no direct heir to the throne. In order to rule as co-regent during this difficult time, Akhenaton (Adminadab/Moses), married his half-sister Nefertiti. Akhenaten drew his power from his wife Nefertiti, the heiress.
The anointing of the king was an Egyptian custom inherited even more anciently from Sumer in Mesopotamia, and constituted the privileged duty of the Pharaoh’s semi-divine sister-brides. Crocodile fat was the substance used in anointing because it was associated with sexual prowess. (Indeed, the word for ‘crocodile’ in Egyptian was messeh, which corresponds to the Hebrew word Messiah – ‘Anointed One’). Akhenaton was then able to succeed Amenhotep to the throne as Amenhotep IV. Akhenaton and Nefertiti had six daughters and a son, Tutankhaten.
In his new role as Pharaoh, Amenhotep IV changed his official name to the one he had chosen as a teenager, Akhenaton, and closed all the temples of the Egyptian gods, building new ones to Aten, an omnipotent God who had no image–the equivalent of Adonai (Lord). Akhenaton was the last important ruler of the 18th dynasty and notable as the first historical figure to establish a religion based on the concept of monotheism. He established the cult of Aton, or Aten, the sun god or solar disk, which he believed to be a universal, omnipresent spirit and the sole creator of the universe.
Akhenaton was intensely disliked, especially by the priest of the old gods, and there were many threats of armed insurrection. He was eventually forced to abdicate in favor of Smenkhkare, who was in turn succeeded by Akhenaten’s son, Tutankhaten, who took the throne at 11 years of age, but was obliged to change his name to Tutankhamun to reflect allegiance to the old gods of Amun rather than to Aten. His ruled for a mere nine or ten years. There is no Egyptian record of either Akhenaten or Smenkhare’s deaths.
Akhenaten himself was banished from Egypt, and fled with some of his retainers to Sinai, “taking with him his royal scepter topped with a brass serpent.” To his supporters he was still regarded as the true heirMose, Meses or Mosis, meaning ‘beloved of’, ‘heir’ or ‘born of’–as in Thuthmosis (born of Thuth) and Ramses (fashioned of Ra).



115
James Henry Breasted’s translation of an ancient Egyptian stela known as the ‘Stela of Sheshonk’ from the reign of Paynozem II relates how this matter of Moses ‘son of Sudaimon’ was brought before Ra who then acquits him:
“This great god appeared upon the pavement of silver in the house of Amon at the morning hour. The High Priest of Amon-Re, king of gods, Paynozem, triumphant, came before this great god. This great god saluted violently. He placed two tablets of writing before the great god; one writing said: “O Amon-Re, king of gods, my good lord; it is said that there are matters which should be investigated in the case of Thutmose, triumphant, son of Sudiamon (Sw-dy-Ymn), triumphant, the major-domo;” the other writing [said: “O, AmonRe, king of gods], my good lord; it is said that there are no matters which should be investigated in the case of Thutmose, triumphant, the son of Sudiamon, triumphant, the major-domo.” The [High-Priest] of Amon-Re, king of gods, Paynozem, triumphant, repeated before this great god, saying: “O my good lord, thou shalt judge - - -, thou prosperest beyond all wonders.” [The} great god saluted violently.
The Acquittal
“These two tablets of writing were placed before the [great god]. The great god took the writing which said: “O Amon-Re, my good lord; it is said that there are matters [which should] be investigated in the case of Thutmose, triumphant, son of Sudiamon, triumphant, the major-domo.” The great god [rejected the other writing which said: “O Amon-Re, king of gods], my good lord; it is said that there are no matters which should be investigated in the case of [Thutmose. Triumphant, the son of Sudiamon, triumphant, the major-domo.”]
“[Then the High Priest of Amon-Re, king of gods, went again] to this great, great god to put his two tablets of writing the second time before the great god. [The great god] took [the same writing as before] - - They bore witness, saying: “There are no matters which should be investigated [in the case of Thutmose, triumphant, son of Sudiamon, triumphant, the] major-domo.”
Evidence from Egypt indicates that Moses (Akhenaten) led his people southward through Sinai to the marshy territory of Lake Timash where it was hard for horses to follow. Among the retainers who fled with Moses were the sons and families of Jacob (Israel). Others followed him in waves of exodus out of Egypt.
And thus it was that Moses and the Israelites came to the foot of Mt. Sinai.
The Egypt that Moses/Akhenaton had fled from was a country that had worshipped the dark space gods of Sirius and Orion, and the remnants of Atlantis. Above all, they had placed Lucifer as Amun, or Ra, or Amun Ra, as the highest god.
Elaine Pagels states in her book, The Origins of Satan, that Satan is ‘virtually absent’ from the Hebrew Bible. A knowledge of Lucifer and perhaps more than a passing acquaintance with him and his history, however, makes this statement flawed. This is made obvious in the works of another of the Old Testament prophets, Isaiah (14:12-14). The Hebrew poet addresses a taunt song to the king of Babylon, whose military might and arrogance had led him to commit the crime of hubris (arrogance): “I will make myself like the Most High!” (verse 14).
In the taunting parody of the Babylonian king, the author calls him “Helel, Son of Dawn.” The Hebrew word helel means “shining one.” This is an obvious comparison to Lucifer, an affront of the gravest nature. The “shining one, Son of the Dawn” is an epithet related to Lucifer, similar to the mythological example to be found in the Greek legend of Phaeton. Phaeton, in the Greek story, was the “shining” son of Helios who attempted to drive his father’s golden chariot but was unable to control the massive power of its horses. The parallel is obvious, for like Phaeton the Babylonian king attempted to assert powers that were too great for



116
him; his inadequacy would result in his doom, much as Lucifer’s attempt for ultimate supremacy shall also end in failure.
Similarly, Baal’s major epithets reflect his prominent position among the gods, achieved as a result of conflict, and his fertility-bestowing powers, mirroring His true nature as Lucifer. Baal/Lucifer is called “victor . . prince . . king . . judge . . most high . . lord of the earth . . rider of the clouds . . . and he is also given the name of Hadad, a well-known ancient Near Eastern storm-god. In His conquest of the planet, Lucifer has made His presence felt in every major culture and every major religion. That is why Religion was ‘lowered’ to the planet as an intercessor to guide humanity away from the true god they have had inside them all the time. It is such miraculous powers as the right to intercede with God and the right to forgive sins with the assurance that God will acceded to the priest’s judgement that sets the priest apart from all other men. And, in spite of all the rifts and protests, the church dedication to this role of the church and its priests has not diminished over the centuries.
The fact is that, although the historical aspects of the Old Testament are treated and taught from a Hebrew standpoint with an originally Mesopotamian base, there was also a significant Egyptian impact on the culture which has been strategically ignored. This comes to light through the research of Laurence Gardner, specifically from the time of the Sinai incident and proves to be the very reason why the all important book of Jasher was excluded from the canon. It would show where the origin of some Christian thought comes from. Its exclusion, like that of many other works included in the Gnostic Scriptures, shows the depth to which religion was manipulated so as not to provide any true answers to historical questions of who these gods were.
It was upon the mountain at Sinai that Jehovah first announced his presence to Moses. Being an Aten supporter, Moses asked this new lord and master who he was - and the reply was 'I am that I am', which in phonetic Hebrew became Yahweh (Jehovah). However, for the longest time afterwards, the Israelites were not allowed to utter the name Jehovah, except for the High Priest who was allowed to whisper it in private once a year. The problem was that prayers were supposed to be said to this new godhead - but how would he know they were to him if his name was not mentioned?
While the deaths of other gods in Sumerian history are recorded, gods such as Timat, Mummu, Apsu and Dumu-zi, this new god Jehovah, on the other hand, is said to be ‘from everlasting to everlasting.’ (Psalm 90:2)
According to Gardner, the Israelite exiles from Egypt knew that Jehovah was not the same as Aten (their traditional Adon or Lord), and so they presumed he must be the equivalent of the great State God of Egypt - even if not one and the same. It was decided, therefore, to add the name of that State-god to all prayers thereafter, and the name of that god was Amen. To this day, the name of Amen is still recited at the end of prayers. Even the well-known Christian Lord's Prayer (as given in the Gospel of Matthew) was transposed from an Egyptian original which began: 'Amen, Amen, who art in heaven ...'
As for the famous Ten Commandments, said to have been conveyed to Moses by God upon the mountain, these too are of Egyptian origin, deriving directly from Spell Number 125 in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. They were not new codes of conduct invented for the Israelites, but were simply newly stated versions of the ritual confessions of the pharaohs. For example, the confession 'I have not killed' was transposed to the decree Thou shalt not kill; 'I have not stolen' became Thou shalt not steal; 'I have not told lies' became Thou shalt not bear false witness - and so on.
Not only were the Ten Commandments drawn from Egyptian ritual, but so too were the Psalms (which are attributed to King David) reworked from Egyptian hymns. Even the Old Testament book of Proverbs - the



117
so-called wise words of Solomon - was translated almost verbatim into Hebrew from the writings of an Egyptian sage called Amenemope. These are now held at the British Museum, and verse after verse of the book of Proverbs can be attributed to this Egyptian original. It has now been discovered that even the writings of Amenemope were extracted from a far older work called The Wisdom of Ptah-hotep, which comes from more than 2000 years before the time of Solomon.
In addition to the Book of the Dead and the ancient Wisdom of Ptah-hotep, various other Egyptian texts were used in compiling the Old Testament. These include the Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts, from which references to the Egyptian gods were simply transposed to relate to the Hebrew god Jehovah.
What is particularly interesting is that, historically, this was not fully contrived in the time of Abraham, nor even in the later time of Moses. It did not happen until the 6th century BC when tens of thousands of Israelites were held captive by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Until that time, the Hebrew and Israelite records referred to any number of gods and goddesses by individual names, and under a general plural classification of the Elohim.
Through some 500 years from the Captivity, the scriptures existed only as a series of quite separate writings and it was not until after the time of Jesus that these were collated into a single volume. Jesus would himself never have heard of the Old Testament or the Bible, but the scriptures to which he had access included many books that were not selected for the compilation that we know today. Strangely though, some of these are still mentioned in the modern Bible text as being important to the original culture, including the enigmatic book of Jasher.
Jasher was the Egyptian-born son of Caleb; he was brother-in-law to the first Israelite judge Othneil and an uncle of Bezaleel the Master Craftsman, as well as being the appointed staff-bearer to Moses. It is generally reckoned that the book of Jasher's position in the Bible should be between the books of Deuteronomy and Joshua, but it was sidestepped by the editors because it sheds a very different light on the sequence of events at Mount Horeb in Sinai.
The familiar Exodus account explains that Jehovah issued instructions to Moses concerning masters and servants, covetousness, neighborly behavior, crime, marriage, morality, and many other issues including the all-important rule of the Sabbath - along with the Ten Commandments. But, in Jasher (which pre-dates the Exodus writings), these laws and ordinances are not conveyed to Moses by Jehovah. In fact, Jehovah is not mentioned at all. The new laws, says the book of Jasher, were communicated to Moses and the Israelites by Jethro, High Priest of Midian and Lord of the Mountain. In effect, Jethro (whose daughter, Zipporah, Moses married) was the overall governor of the Sinai Temple.
In Canaan, the title Lord (or Lofty One) of the Mountain, was defined as El Shaddai, and this is particularly significant for, as previously mentioned, this was precisely the name related to Moses when he asked the Lord to reveal his identity. The Lord said 'I am that I am (YHWH); I am he that Abraham called El Shaddai'. YHWH became eventually transposed to the name Jehovah but, as related in Jasher (and as confirmed in Exodus when correctly read), this Lord was not a deiform god at all; he was Jethro the El Shaddai, the great vulcan and Master Craftsman of the Hathor Temple.
In the translation of The Book of Jasher by Alcuin Flaccus Albinus, Abbot of Canterbury (Longman, London, 1929, section Testimonies and Notes, 14:9-33) says there is no mention of Jehovah.
Another very important aspect of the book of Jasher is that it explains that it was not Moses who was the spiritual leader of the tribes who left Egypt for Sinai; their spiritual leader and chief counselor was Miriam, the half-sister of Moses who receives only passing mentions in the book of Exodus. Indeed, as detailed in



118
Jasher, Miriam's position posed such a problem for Moses in his attempt to create an environment of male dominance that he imprisoned her - as a result of which the Israelites rose up against Moses to secure her release.
There is no doubt that, for all the scribal manipulation of old texts, Miriam (Meryamon of Egypt) emerges outside the canonical Bible as a key character of the era but, just like Mary Magdalene in New Testament times, she has been ignored and forgotten by Church establishments founded as male-dominated institutions. Of Miriam, the book of Aaron (credited to Hur, the grandfather of Bezaleel) relates:
“Miriam from hence became the admired of the Hebrews; every tongue sang of her praise. She taught Israel; she tutored the children of Jacob and the people called her, by way of eminence, the Teacher. She studied the good of the nation, and Aaron and the people harkened unto her. To her the people bowed; to her the afflicted came.”
To Gardner, the true relevance of Miriam, however, is that she was a recognized Dragon Queen of the matrilineal Grail bloodline. It was primarily from her that the dynastic line ensued to culminate in the Royal House of David, which owes its kingly origin to Miriam's pharaonic descent, rather than to any patriarchal heritage from Abraham, as we are generally led to believe. It is with Abraham’s son Isaac that Jehovah establishes his covenant.
This line of succession (from Cain and the Mesopotamian dynasties, through the early pharaohs of Egypt, to King David and onward to Jesus), in his words, “was purpose-bred to be the earthly purveyors of the Light. They were the true 'sons of the gods', who were fed firstly on Anunnaki Star Fire from about 3800 BC and, subsequently, on high-spin metal supplements from abut 2000 BC.”
Chapter 16 THE JEWISH BRANCH
Builded He then, within it, great chambers, filled them from forms called forth from the Ether, filled them with wisdom called forth by His mind . . . Formless was He within his Temple, yet was He formed in the image of man. Dwelling among them yet not of them, strange and far different was He from the children of men.
The Emerald Tablets of Thoth
Abraham and Yahweh
The Jewish people have been great civilization builders. They are from one of the twelve original planets to ‘seed’ the Earth, the planet called Hoovid by the Nine. Their purpose as star seeds was for their knowledge and their seed-influence on civilization. It is obvious that they have been greatly successful in both these aspects when one thinks of the vast influence they have on so many of the civilizations throughout history. Hebrew tribes have participated in the colonization of so many distant lands including such far away places as North America, China, and even Hawaii. The Greek and Roman civilizations both had great Jewish influence in their early growth. The Jews were an influence in Babylonia, Egypt, Baghdad, and on Islam itself through the Diaspora. And then “. . . the families of the Canaanites spread abroad” (Genesis 10:18).
The lost tribes of Israel were dispersed to places such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, North America, and there blood appears in the Phoenicians, in the Celts, and in the Orientals. The majority of people working with spiritual elevation contain the genes of the Hoovids, according to the Nine.



119
The Hoovids were also chosen for implantation of individuality and determination, and perhaps an ingredient of tenacity. What they often lack, say the Nine, is compassion, and this is now a critical element in their development.
“It was a matter of obedience. The Hoovids did not obey, and have not obeyed. The Hebrews must take responsibility . . . they do not have understanding or compassion for others. They set themselves up on a pinnacle and they do not comprehend that by doing that they are putting themselves up as a target for slaughter, for in the center they are the purest and gentlest . . .The other civilizations are bound and hindered by the obstinacy of the Hoovids. . . The DNA of the Hoovids, the life-force . . . when that is released, the Universe is released. . . And thus Israel is important.”
The Jewish encounter with their god, Yahweh, began in the time of Enosh, son of Seth, who was the son of Adam—the person, not the race. The average length of a lifetime in those days was about a thousand years, remembering that the planet was still 4th dimensional, and thus time ran more slowly. Many races on their own planets live the equivalent of tens of thousands of our years. The average lifespan on Lemuria was 700 years. The Bible says of Noah that he lived 950 years, and this was the final transition between dimensions.
Zecharia Sitchin calculates that Enosh was born 98,260 years ago. In truth, it was more in the period of around 25,000 BC, about 16,000 years before the Flood. It was then that ‘men began to call on the name of the Lord” (Gen: 4:26). The Book of Jubilees has something similar: Enosh “who began to call on the name of the Lord on Earth.” This, however, was not the Lord ‘Yahweh’.
Since so little if anything is left of the pre-diluvial age, we must take up where history begins again—in the 6th and 5th millennium BC. At this time Ra/Lucifer was ‘born’ in Egypt. The earliest finds at Ugarit stretch back to this time, and Yahweh begins appearing after that. The Old Testament picks up after the Flood with the Tower of Babel where the people are scattered and their languages confused so they could not understand one another.
The sounds in our language express our real story, as we shall see in our venture into the Cabala, and so the gods scrambled these sounds to help keep us controlled.
In her book Mutant Message Down Under, Marlo Morgan describes the Ab-original naming system and language that sound very much like the toning language of the Hopi and Navajos of the southwestern United States. It also bears a great resemblance to the toning language of the Universe which then became more concrete with the Egyptians and ancient Sumerians. The Sumerian language bore no relationship to any others, it virtually ‘stands alone and unrelated to any known language living or dead’.
“Oota said in some Aboriginal nations they only used about eight names total—more like a numbering system. Everyone of the same generation and same sex were considered the same relation, so everyone had several mothers, fathers. Brothers, etc. . . .
“Communicating was not a simple task. Pronouncing the tribal words was difficult. In most instances they were very long. For instance, they spoke of a tribe called Pitjantjatjara and one called Yankuntjatjara. Many things sounded identical until I learned to listen extremely carefully. I realize that reporters around the world do not agree on how to spell Aboriginal words. Some use B, DJ, D, And G, where others for the same words use P, T, TJ and K. The point is that there is no right or wrong way to it because the people themselves do not use an alphabet. . . . My problem was that the people with whom I was walking used nasal sounds I found extremely difficult to make. To sound “ny,” I learned to force my tongue against my



120
back teeth. You will see what I mean if you do this and say the word “Indian.” There is also a sound made by elevating the tongue and flicking it forward rapidly.”
Such items as the Flood and the Tower of Babel are noted as factual by the Life Readings given by Edgar Cayce. One woman who had a Life Reading in 1944 (5367) was told that in a previous existence she had actually been born on the Ark as a daughter of Japheth, son of Noah.
The Old Testament then takes up with generations of Shem leading up to Terah and his son, Abram (Abraham).
According to Gardner, however, there was a line of succession from Cain that ruled their various kingdoms from Ur in southern Mesopotamia to Ashore in the north, and was the most prominent sovereign line of the era. Yet for all their prominence, and indeed because of it, the Bible writers elected to ignore these mighty dynasties in favor of supporting the parallel line of descent from Adam’s son Seth to disguise the true heritage of a subsequent member of the Cainite family. This was the son of Tubal-cain who was the key Sumerian link to the early pharaohs of Egypt, the son who was the biblical Ham.
In strict terms of sovereign genealogy, the line of Ham and Nimrod (in descent from Cain, Lamech and Tubal-Cain) held the true heritage of Grail kingship, while the Sethian line through Noah and Shem were of lesser standing, although rising to positions of city governorship in the generations immediately before Abraham. The heritage of Ham was so important to Messianic history that an escutcheon was devised and prominently used in documents as late as the Stemma-Jacobi of the 1630 Genethliacon, held in the Rosicrucian archive. Not surprisingly, these Hamite arms incorporate a dragon within the field, and the Genethliacon was dedicated to Charles I Stuart, who founded Britain’s scientific Royal Society in 1645.
The Targum (a collection of ancient Aramaic writings relating to the Old Testament that were collected in the first century) relates that Nimrod was the father of an Egyptian pharaoh, but does not give his name. However, a separate Ethiopic text (The Book of Adam and Eve) refers to another pharaoh who was contemporary with Nimrod, phonetically calling himself Yanuf. This pharaoh is easily identifiable. His name is correctly written as Anedjib and he was king of the first dynasty of Egypt, reigning about 3000 BC, at precisely the time of Nimrod.
Not long after the reign of Anedjib (in about 2890 BC) a new dynasty emerged in Egypt and with this family the heritage of Nimrod was cemented very firmly into place. We are left in no doubt of this because it was King Raneb, the second pharaoh of the dynasty, who first introduced the veneration of the ‘Goat of Mendes’ into Egypt. This is especially relevant because in both the Grail and Dragon traditions (which are fundamentally one and the same), the Goat of Mendes has always been associated with Nimrod’s grandfather Ham. Mendes was a city just north-east of Avaris in the Egyptian delta and the sacred goat (often called Khem, Chem or Ham) was the zodiacal goat of Capricorn. In accordance with the Dragon Court tradition, Ham was the designated Archon of the Tenth Age of Capricorn and in this regard his symbol was an inverted pentagram.
From the earliest times, the pentagram was indicative of enlightenment and was associated with the pre-Jewish Sabbath. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), the most famous artist of Reformation Germany, placed a goat center-stage with the serpent in his allegorical portrayal of Adam and Eve. In view of this age-old tradition, it is hardly surprising that the pentagram and the sabbatical goat became associated with heretical Christians from medieval times.
The Goat of Mendes was also directly associated with alchemy, and although the word alchemy derives from al-khame—the science of overcoming (?) the blackness, it had a secondary root in al-Khem (the Khem).



121
In this regard, Khem, the black ruler of Mendes, was identified with a certain Azazel of Capricorn, whom the Book of Enoch describes as a Watcher. It is said in Enoch that Azazel made known to me ‘’all the metals, and the art of working them . . . and the use of antimony.’ This is an essential ingredient of the prepatory alchemical process when producing the Philosopher’s Stone (a catalyst).
Ham then was not a son of Noah, but was of the royal succession of Cain. Books of Rosicrucian and Hermetic philosophy mention that much of the material found in the Book of Moses is derived from the initiation rituals of Egyptian mysteries, and the earliest Masonic teachings relate that Ham was the inheritor of the Wisdom of Lamech (The Emerald Tablets). Ancient Persia is now modern Iran, a name that derives from Aryan, denoting ‘a noble race’ that had traveled to Persia in remote times from a place unknown. In contrast to the Hebrews, the Aryans were venerators of the Wise Lord Ahura Mazda (Ohrmazd – God of Light—Lucifer). His earthly kingdom was defined in the Avestan language as Pairi Daize, from which comes the familiar word ‘paradise.’
It is a tenet of the very oldest mystery lore that Lamech was the father of Masonic symbolism and that his son Jabal was the master geometrician. Many early Lodge constitutions cite the founders as being the sons and daughter of Lamech, namely Jabal, Jubal, Tubal-cain and Naamah. They wrote their various sciences it is said, upon two pillars—one called Marbell, which would resist fire, and the other called Latarus, which would resist water.
This recorded information was based upon the Annunaki testament known as the Table of Destiny. Gardner says that is generally agreed that, in time, their content was translated to an emerald tablet by Tubal-cain’s grandson, Ham, who was known to the Egyptians as Khem or Thoth. In truth, however, they were not one and the same. The English Masonic system, which was extensively revised in the eighteenth century, adopted an exclusively Western doctrine wherein Thoth, the traditionally styled “great Architect”, was figuratively supplanted by the Judaeo-Christian God. By virtue of this adjustment, it is claimed that the original secrets of Freemasonry have been lost—but rather more to the point is that the old mysteries were shunned by the Hanoverian inventors of the English system (based upon a York Rite) which retains only vague allegories and obscure ritual. There is no alchemical science now taught in these Lodges, as was the case with the early Scottish Rite; the emphasis now being seemingly on worthy charitable works, coupled with meaningless ceremonies that leave Lodge members quite bewildered as to the true scientific nature of the Order.
The Gaelic Connection
With the senior Mesopotamian succession from Ham and Nimrod diverted into Egypt (offering a good reason why the Hebrews were so readily accepted there), we are left with Shem and his family to provide the Bible’s key patriarchal strain from Noah. The parallel lines from Ham and Japhet, however, progressed into Arabia, Anatolia and Greater Scythia by the Black Sea, then eventually across Europe to Ireland. Japhet was indeed Ham’s brother, just as the Bible explains. Hence, he was also a son of Tubal-cain, not a son of Noah as related in Genesis. Ham and Japhet were key ancestors of the Scots Gaels, again a good reason for why Freemasonry later became so powerful there and so readily accepted.
The cursed descendants of Noah’s son Canaan were identified as Canaanites, whose Mediterranean boundary was said to extend from Sidon to Gaza, and inland to Sodom and Gomorrah by the Dead Sea (Genesis 10:19) They were perceived as enemies of the Hebrews, offering a good reason why Abraham was instrumental in destroying them.
Very little is said about Shem’s immediate family until Abraham and his wife Sarai.



122
In the story of Isaac and Ishmael –the half brothers –one is again usurped by the other, just as with the archetypal story of ARTOLA and Lucifer, and as we shall also see, with Jesus and his brother, James.
It is with Isaac that Jehovah establishes his covenant. Genesis (15:18) also contains the promise that Isaac’s descendants will inherit the Egyptian Empire ‘from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates’.
The Koran, while relating the intended sacrifice of his son by Abraham, does not mention the name of the son (Isaac or Ishmael). Indeed many Islamic scholars conclude that the intended victim was not Isaac, but Ishmael, the son of Haga, who is described in the Book of Adam as ‘the daughter of a pharaoh’ in descent from Nimrod.
Circumcision was a custom inherited from ancient Egypt—why then bring it into Hebrew culture as a sign of the covenant between Man and God?
The only Egyptian connection that we are told about is Abraham’s wife, Sarai, entering into the household of the pharaoh who wanted her for his wife, at which point Abraham denies that Sarai was his own wife and claimed instead that she was his sister (Genesis 12:12-15) Then, a little later, we are informed that Abraham and Sarai were both offspring of Terah, and Abraham explains, ‘She is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife’ (Genesis 20:12). Thus Abraham had married his half-sister in the tradition of the Annunaki, the Pharaohs, and of the Sirian-Orion Gods.
In the Ethiopian chronicle Nazum al-jawahir (‘The String of Gems’) Terah’s wives are given as Tohwait (mother of Sarai) and Yawnu (mother of Abraham). Tohwait is also recorded in the Syraic M’arath Gaze as Naharyam, who is to be identified with Nfry-ta-Tjewnen, the former wife of Pharaoh Amenemhet I. Her son by this marriage was the succeeding Pharaoh Senusret I—the very pharaoh who claimed Sarai for his wife. This is not surprising, since Sarai was Saenusret’s maternal half-sister (as well as being Abraham’s paternal halfsister) and it was common practice for Egyptian pharaohs to marry their (half-)sisters in order to progress the kingship through the female line.
Isaac then might have been the son of the pharaoh. The Hebrew texts state that the Pharaoh and Sarai actually were married, as opposed to the traditional English version. If he was, then the covenant would make sense. Thus the change of name to Sarah (princess), and also the adoption of circumcision, and the future dynastic inheritance of Egypt. It would even explain the relevance of the mysterious “birthright” that was eventually sold by Isaac’s son Esau to his brother Jacob. (Genesis 25:30-34)
Isaac’s wife was specially chosen from the women of his own family in Mesopotamia, not the Canaanites, and when Isaac married Rebecca of Haran, she was bedecked with jewels and attended by handmaidens in the manner of a noble wedding (which fits Abraham’s role as a military commander and royal son).
Esau’s descendants were also Egyptian royalty by way of his wife Bashemath, the daughter of Ishmael, and Mahalath of Egypt. Mahalath was also known as Nefru-sobek, a daughter of Pharaoh Amenemhet II and granddaughter of Senusret I, the half-brother of Abraham’s wife, Sarah.
The daughter of Esau and Mahalath was Igrath, whose daughter by Pharaoh Amenemhet III was Sobeknefru, Dragon Queen of Egypt (c. 1785-1782 BC). Queen Sobeknefru formalized the Dragon Court of Ankhfn-khonsu establishing a firm base for the priestly pursuits associated with the scientific teachings of Thoth which had prevailed from the second dynasty of Nimrod’s grandson King Raneb.



123
When Moses is instructed by Jehovah to go back in to Egypt to free ‘his people’ his brother, Aaron, appears out of nowhere to accompany Moses back to Egypt and perform the miracles. This Aaron was Moses feeding brother, son of Moses wet nurse Tey. It was he who succeeded Akhenaten for just a few weeks after Akhenaten’s abdication. He was the grandson of Joseph the vizier, he was also the pharaoh Smenkh-ka-ra, also Smenkh-ka-ra-on, from which is derived Aaron. He was the father of the princess known as Scota from which the original Scots-Gaels were descended. Her husband was a Black Sea prince of Scythia. The Gaelic texts state that Gaedheal (Gael), the son of Zniul and Princess Scota, was born in Egypt at the time when Moses began to act as leader of the children of Israel.
Abraham
The Bible takes up Abraham’s history when he is leaving Ur of the Chaldeans with his grandson, Lot, and his daughter-in-law, Sara, to go into the land of Canaan. They settle, however, in Haran where his father, Terah, dies. We are then given the story of ‘Abram’ being told by ‘the Lord’ to go into the land that he shall be shown.
“And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves” (Genesis 12: 2-3)
This is a critical point in history, for ‘the Lord’ who scattered the peoples and confused their language in the Tower of Babel episode, is not then the same ‘Lord’ who tells Abraham to leave Ur and move to Canaan. All of the stories in Genesis up to this point are taken from the earlier works of the Sumerians, as suggested by the works of Sitchin. The writers of the Old Testament needed an opening to their story and borrowed heavily while in captivity from the Babylonians and from their neighbors to the north, as well as some older oral traditions.
To the Babylonians it was Marduk who set the stars in place, not Jehovah. And it is Marduk who creates man. But before that the story came from Sumer and the Sumerians had not known where they came from. The stories, however, appeared soon after 4000 BC.
The true story that these elders of the Jewish faith had to tell actually begins with Abraham, and Abraham is a demi-god, one of the ‘mixed’ ones produced in the ‘twilight zone’ of the temple where his father is a high-priest of Ur, by the mating of one of the gods with the temple priestess, his mother. Even his wife, Sarai, is a temple priestess.
Abraham’s family was of such prominence as to give their names to the cities of the region (Haran and others). About the time Terah moved his family from Ur to Haran, the ancient texts state ”the gods have abandoned us like migrating birds. Smoke lies on our cities like a shroud.”
Elaine Pagels suggests that the writings collected to form the Hebrew Bible encourage the identification of Yahweh with Israel itself. According to the foundation story recounted in Genesis 12, Israel first received its identity through election when the “Lord” ordered Abraham to leave his home country, his family, and his ancestral gods, and promised him, in exchange for exclusive loyalty, a new national heritage with a new identity.
While it may not be a surprise to the Jewish people that a god would choose them as ‘a special people’, it must still be taken as surprising that a large proportion of the rest of the world who ‘aren’t Jewish’ would choose to accept this Jewish god as their own, even with the intercession of this god’s ‘son.’ The Hoovids were, say the Nine, the first race chosen to seed the Earth, and thus, in one way, are ‘the chosen people’. The whole purpose of choosing these many various races, however, was specifically so that they would



124
intermingle their genetic traits, their skills and their knowledge, and yes even their shortcomings, to provide Man with a combination of all that was good and strong in the Universe. Man would also then have an understanding of the many varied levels of existence and the problems involved. Man would then have a chance to overcome the shortcomings inherent in Himself through His birth by dysfunctional Cosmic Parents.
To do this it would take the participation of all those who came here as star seeds. Where the Hoovids ‘failed to obey’ was that they would not intermingle, a trait still strongly present in Jewish people everywhere. The name Israel–‘Isra-el’–means ‘to struggle with God.’ This is what the Nine meant by saying they “set themselves on a pinnacle and they do not comprehend that by doing so they are putting themselves up as a target for slaughter.” The history of the Jewish people has proved this true. Like all outsiders on planet Earth, they have set themselves up for persecution by not ‘playing the game’. It is questionable that the experiment of the intermixing of so many races would have worked anyway, but it had to be tried to speed up the pace of Creation since there were so many continual earth changes decimating the population of the planet. After each catastrophe, so much work was required to rebuild.
If it had not been for the interference of Lucifer, it may have had a chance. By failing to fulfill their role in the experiment the Hoovids may perhaps have doomed the experiment to fail from the very first.
“The other civilizations are bound and hindered by the obstinacy of the Hoovids. . . The DNA of the Hoovids, the life-force . . . when that is released, the Universe is released.”
That is the conclusion drawn by the Nine, if they were to let go of their ‘chosen people’ status and participate, it would free up the rest of the world to go through with the experiment. But now it is too late. Wars on the planet these days have become ‘tribal wars’, wars between different members of different racial or planetary groups, and the experiment has dissolved into chaos.
We have touched on the role Lucifer had in Atlantis and Egypt, there was no need for Him to do much of anything in Sumer, for there the Annunaki were doing it all for him.
In discussing ‘the opposition’ in an earlier chapter, it was said by the Nine that they, ‘the opposition’, are only supposed to use the weaknesses of the races, not to corrupt their strengths. Even though Lucifer does not play by any rules, he took the Jewish obstinacy—their failure ‘to obey’—and used it against the whole world. Their strengths—the determination and tenacity, only compounded the problems of their weakness, just as he used the Aryan idea of superiority and many other flaws or lessons from the other races.
This is not to lay any particular blame on the Jewish people, for they have indeed suffered for it, and when we go back far enough, we are all Soul, that loving and loved spark of the FATHER. Each and every Human Being must look to his or her own heart and life to see where the causes of the failure lie, for we have all been here before.
As the Nine say, “the Bible has an essence of truth, and a great deal of human corruption for keeping people in bondage.”
So many of the peoples of the Near East at that time, c. 2500 BC, were waiting for their gods of oldthe Nibiruans—to return. As with any long waiting period, the reality of those they were waiting for lost its intensity. Lucifer saw a position vacant and decided to fill it. Since He is probably the originator of the Machiavellian theory of ‘divide and conquer’, using it so well against his Cosmic Parents, he was not past becoming the god of many different religions as a step to becoming ‘the One God’ over all.



125
So it is that about this time Yahweh made a serious appearance on the scene and the world started changing—forever.
If the Jewish count from the ‘beginning of the world’ is about 3113 BC, then this date is more appropriately the beginning of their alliance with Yahweh, and indeed the beginning of a new world for all of us.
The nuclear war that was triggered by Marduk and that involved Abraham, as told by Zecharia Sitchin in his works, made the Dead Sea into a lifeless body of water around the time of 2024 BC. Its purpose was to show the power of the gods of Ur in that area against those who were considered to be the enemies of Abraham and his quest for supremacy in the region.
While Abraham was, in truth, the beginning of the Luciferian quest for total control of the anti-diluvial world, Abraham himself was not, however, cognizant of this pact. In his heart, he truthfully felt that who he was talking to was the Lord, one mightier than all, and one who would take his people unto himself and call them his own, giving them dominance over all the other warlike tribes that surrounded them.
Think of what any man might do when confronted with this situation. In the movie, Field of Dreams, Kevin Costner’s character is asked to deal with a disincarnate voice from the heavens. Do you follow, or ignore it? Many psychotic people these days end up in mental institutions because they feel God is talking to them. Others are made rich and famous by channeling Beings who even give themselves the names of ancient Egyptian gods. These end up being called ‘holy men’, and literally being admired or worshipped for their ability to be in touch with the ‘Lord’ or some creative aspect of Him. Neil Donald Walsche’s book, Conversations with God, is a popular book simply for the reason that it attempts to show us that in some small way we can all be in contact with one level of the Creator or another.
Abraham’s people were basically homeless and in a very hostile land. Being the bargain-maker and warrior that he was, Abraham set about to do the best for his people, not realizing who he was really dealing with nor what that deal would eventually lead to. The so-called ‘Jewish conspiracy’ that some people mention, is a fact, but one perpetrated by only a few who feel it necessary to make up for all the pain and suffering the Jewish people have been through over the past 4,000 years. They are not an evil people, nor are they deliberately trying to influence the outcome of the balance of power on this planet. They are in fact non-complicitant dupes for the Negative Power that is called Lucifer. The FATHER loves all of IT’s Creation, none more so, and none the less, but ALL of Creation.
“The Hoovids had strength within their character, and also the planet they came from was a warrior-like planet—in their seeding here, they were asked to be at peace . . . they were asked to be catalysts and leaders amongst the peoples of earth . . .They have doubt, suspicion and deception. Part of the reason for their existence on this planet was to overcome that factor. . . Within them lives the knowledge that they have made an error, but because of pride, they will not acknowledge this.
Important to note here too is that the various races who came here to make up this experiment had things to learn by doing so as well. Thus it was an experiment to benefit all, not just supposedly the humans.
“The stresses and strains of earthly life caused the Hebrews increasingly to look after their own interests and people, which ended up being counter-productive. The opposition got their oar in . . . See a small group of people that have survived at all odds, a small group who have continued to educate and forward all their peoples—this does not say there is perfection . . . they do not understand that these beings that they have given the term ‘god’ – not just the Hoovids but gods of all the major religions and their spin



126
offs – were of physicalness, from the civilizations, and were made into gods by humans on Planet Earth. This is now a stage of revolution-evolution . . .”
The statement by the Nine about the Hoovids being warriors makes sense given the fact that the Israelis are still considered great warriors today, and their military record shows they have been able to win in battles against overwhelming odds.
What the Nine says about the “opposition getting their oar in,” and the gods being worshipped by all the major religions, tends to support our thesis that not only was this particular god Yahweh an alien, but he was, in fact, Lucifer.
Proof of such events as the war between Mars and Maldek, the rocket launching pad at Baalbek, the base on Io, and the nuclear war that took place in the area surrounding the Dead Sea are lent credibility by the findings of modern day scientists as mentioned in the book Morning of the Magicians:
“Dr. Ralph Stair, of the American N.B.S., when analyzing some strange haline rocks scattered in the region of Lebanon known as tektites, admitted that these might have come from a planet now extinct situated between Mars and Jupiter. These tektites have been found to contain radio-active isotopes of aluminum and beryllium.
“Several eminent scientists think that Phobos, the satellite of Mars, may be hollow, and an artificial asteroid put into orbit around Mars by intelligent Beings outside the Earth. This was the conclusion arrived at in a serious article in the review Discovery in November 1959 and the same hypothesis has been put forward by the Soviet Professor Chtlovski, an expert in radio-astronomy.
In the sensational article in the Moscow Literary Gazette of February 1960, Professor Agrest, Doctor of physical-mathematics, declared that the tektites found, which could only have been formed at an extremely high temperature and under the action of powerful nuclear radiation, are perhaps the traces left by missiles dispatched from the outer Cosmos . . . Professor Agrest believes that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by a thermo-nuclear explosion set off by space travelers either wantonly, or because they considered it necessary to destroy their depots of energy before leaving the Cosmos.”
According to Jay Weidner and Vincent Bridges, Biblical tradition says that Abraham learned the great ancient secrets from Shem, the son of Noah, also known as Melchizedek, the Righteous King of Ur and Salem, which is now thought to be Jerusalem. The most important mysteries of the work of creation concerned the significance of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet (alpha-bet, the first two) and their relationship to astrology and the mysteries of the calendar or time itself. Attributing this wisdom to Abraham and Melchizedek places its origin in the 18th century BCE, the time of the rise of the New Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Vedic scholars of India.
“Abraham was considered to be the greatest astrologer and magician of his age. The Talmud tells us “all the kings of east and West (Egypt and India) arose early (to wait) at his door.” The teachings of the work of creation are one of the primary astrological texts of the ancient world. This teaching incorporates the astrological wisdom Abraham was said to have known “in his heart,” that is, revealed to him through meditative or magickal means.”
The Dead Sea Scrolls contain the following description of the event at Sodom: “A column of smoke and dust rose into the air like a column of smoke issuing from the bowels of the earth. It rained sulphur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, and destroyed the town and the whole plain and all the inhabitants and every growing plant. And Lot’s wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. And Lot lived at Isoar, but afterwards went to the mountains because he was afraid to remain at Isoar. The people were warned that



127
they must go away from the place of the future explosion and not stay in exposed places; nor should they look at the explosion but hide beneath the ground . . . Those fugitives who looked back were blinded and died . . .”
From 1992 comes another fascinating, mysterious discovery: that of an ancient city in India that appears to have been leveled by an atomic blast 8,000 - 10,000 years ago as well.
Reported in January 1992 by the UK's World Island Review, a construction team discovered the site in Rajasthan, India while preparing to build a housing development.
The heavy layer of radioactive ash found in a three-mile-square area concealed "an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945," said the newspaper.
After its discovery, the ancient city became suspect as the cause of a high rate of birth defects and cancer in the region. "The levels of radiation there (the city site) have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region," said the newspaper.
Sitchin says that the ancient Sumerian texts inform us that it was Enlil who brought the Flood; it was Enlil who destroyed Ur and Babylon, and it was Enlil who constantly opposed the education and enlightenment of humankind. Indeed an early Syrian text relates that it was Enlil-Jehovah who obliterated the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Dead Sea - not because they were dens of wickedness as is generally taught, but because they were great centers of wisdom and learning.
A similar event to that which happened at Sodom also occurred this century in Russia as is described in this newspaper report from the time:
“. . . On this day (30th June, 1908), at seven o’clock in the morning, a pillar of fire rose up over the Siberian taiga to a height of fifty miles. The forest was burned to the ground over an area of twenty-five miles after a gigantic ball of fire had hit the Earth. For several weeks strange clouds, flecked with gold, drifted over Russia, Western Europe and North Africa, reflecting at night the light of the Sun. In London, photographs were taken of people reading their newspapers in the streets at one o’clock in the morning. To this day the vegetation has never grown again in this region of Siberia. Measurements taken in 1960 by a Russian scientific expedition revealed that the level of radio-activity on the spot was three times above normal.”
If Atlantis had nuclear capabilities, and it was these experiments with nuclear fission that helped at least once to sink areas of the continent, then what is to have stopped the surviving Atlanteans from passing along the knowledge to their colonies and survivors? It seems like these weapons have not been used just once in the post-diluvial world either.
The Hoovids were used on numerous occasions to seed the planet after the first and initial seedings. They were sent again later on to accelerate or catalyze the evolution of Planet Earth, but these efforts had little effect either.
The testing of obedience began when they left Ur, say the Nine, before that they listened. In their need for survival, they did not accept total obedience. They were always making deals. When one group would be in awe of Creation, the Hoovids would look at the Creation as something to be utilized.
The archetype of the good man ‘bargaining’ with the Devil—the Mephistophelean Pact—arises from this first arrangement between Abraham and Lucifer.



128
Three world religions—Judaism, Islam, and Christianity—all trace their origins back to the Hebrew patriarch Abraham. He is the key to the power and control here on Earth. As he could be swayed, so too would it sway a large percentage of the population and set up exactly what has happened with these three religions—worshipping the same god, at odds with each other, and Lucifer taking the reigns of control over all.
Abraham was born and lived in Ur (in ancient Sumer)on the Tigris River, listed as probably between 2000 and 1500 BC, but it was at least 500 years earlier than that (again, that critical 2500 BC shift). He married his half-sister, Sara(i). Again, this was a common practice stemming from the tradition of the Annunaki who married their half-sisters to preserve their heritage, the strength of the genetic line being carried through the female side. It was also true in Egypt, Akhenaton/Moses having married his half-sister because true dynastic inheritance was held to flow through the female line. (To be considered Jewish today, the bloodline is still measured through the mother’s side.) It is suspected that Sara was Egyptian, and hence here name, ‘child of Ra,’ whom we now know as Lucifer I, the first incarnation. It is certain that she kept handmaidens who were Egyptian. Abraham’s own name is suspicious too since in moving from Ur into Canaan, Yahweh has him change his name from Abram (heart of Ra) to Ab-‘Ra’-Ham.
What is notable in Abram/Abraham’s early life is the row he had with his father, Terah/Terach, described as an ‘oracle priest’ of the gods in Ur. Abraham, now an advocate of the One God, gained possibly from his marriage to Sara and her affiliation with Ra, smashed his father’s polytheistic idols. If this sounds familiar, it is because it is exactly what happened later with Amenhotep IV who took the name Akhenaton, and was exiled from Egypt under the name Moses, another of the Hebrew patriarchs. History is full of coincidences, which when put together create a totally different picture of the world. Abraham and his father are supposed to have forgiven one another. As with Akhenaton/Moses, however, the clues to Lucifer’s desire to narrow down the field to One God, himself, are evident in this tale.
Everything changed as Jehovah became even more rationalized as an ‘individual absolute’—a unilateral overlord of all things. The Hebrew perception of Jehovah also became totally abstract, so that all physical connection with humankind was lost. . . .To the Hebrews, Jehovah transcended even nature herself, and in consequence of this evolving thought process the true harmony of humankind and nature was forfeit. In erstwhile Mesopotamian, Canaanite and Egyptian thought, the unexplainable divine was manifest within nature, and nature enveloped both the gods and society. The Hebrews forsook harmony in favor of subservience. . . what was ultimately lost was integrity.— This also led to a separation from the Earth and the decline in caring for it—Most of all, it went hand in hand with the loss of the acknowledgement of the Mother, and of the feminine aspect of Creation. The Patriarchy that had ruled Atlantis took power again, and has never let go the reins since.
As written in the Book of Joshua, Joshua tells the history of Abraham to the elders, saying that he once worshipped other gods – “Terah and his sons Abrahan-m and Nahor . . . and they worshipped other Elohim.” After his father’s death in Haran, however, and at age 75, Abraham is said to have responded to Yahweh to move on into Canaan. Stopping near Bethel, he builds an altar and is promised by the Lord that all this land shall be given to his descendants. Then he moves on into Egypt because there is a famine in the land. In Egypt, he is welcomed, possibly due to his wife’s being born Egyptian, her mother probably a temple priestess like Abraham’s mother. To save his life, Abraham allows the Pharaoh to also wed his wife, Sara, thinking she was Abraham’s sister, the situation we have already covered before. “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai.” (Gen 12: 17.) When the truth is found out, the Pharaoh buys off Abraham, endowing him with great wealth, “Now Abram was very rich in cattle, silver, and in gold” (Gen: 13:2), and sends him and his family on their way back to Canaan.

Abraham later received the blessing of the (non-Jewish) priest-king of Salem, Melchezedek, once known as Shem, the son of Noah. Some say Melchizedek was a spiritual master, but in fact he was the second incarnation of Lucifer on Earth, head of the priesthood of Lucifer, and a Being who we shall see later is still worshipped by many of the Dark Forces upon the planet today.
At Chartres Cathedral in France, the statue of Melchizedek, priest-king of Salem, depicts him with a cup containing a stone in representation of the bread and wine which he evidently offered to Abraham (Genesis 14:18) as an initiation and bestowing of Lucifer’s power. The wine symbolized the sacred Star Fire, the bread is held within the cup—the shewbread, the white powder derived from gold.
As far back as 2180 BC, the pharaohs were using the schefa-food to enhance their pineal activity and thereby to heighten their perception, awareness and intuition—but only the metallurgical adepts of the mystery schools (the Master Craftsmen) knew the secret of its manufacture. (Despite cries of ‘the Age of Enlightenment’, it is not improbable that the connection between Lucifer as Melchezedek stretches even into the witch trials that happened at New Salem in Massachusetts in 1692). The connection between the terms ‘priest-king’, ‘King-priest’, and ‘sorcerer-king’ here are also evident, and this should be a red flag whenever these two words are uttered in the same breath. In that incarnation, as long as it was for Melchezedik/Lucifer, Enjliou and Callia were not around him.
Because Sara, his wife, was barren, Abraham had a son by her Egyptian servant, Hagar. This mating produced, Ishmael. In a dispute, Hagar and Ishmael are sent into the desert but are protected so that eventually Ishmael can become the father of a nation as well, the Arabs. There are thus 188 references to Abraham in the Qu’ran/Koran.
As the Ugaritic texts explain, Baal’s major epithets reflect not only his prominent position among the gods achieved as a result of conflict, but especially his ‘fertility-bestowing powers, a feat at which his counterpart, Yahweh, also seems to be particularly good. At age 90, Sara gives birth to Isaac as promised a year earlier by Yahweh. Yahweh then becomes known as the God of Abraham, and the judge of all nations and peoples. Yahweh was supposed to be just, wise, righteous, merciful and good—a characterization that doesn’t really fit the god we see in the Old Testament that lays to waste all the opponents of Israel, tens of thousands of people in a single battlefield so that his ‘chosen people’ can have their land. He is the god, too, who allows his servant Abraham to marry off his wife to the Pharaoh and then blames the Pharaoh by sending plagues upon him; who asks Abraham to sacrifice his child as a test; who ruins the life of his most faithful servant, Job, as a dare. None of this sounds like a god of Love and Light, but indeed more like a god of darkness and retribution, a god of power instead of love, a god of judgement instead of Love.
When Abraham promoted the Mesopotamian tradition in Canaan he was said to have gained access to a uniquely inscribed tablet of ideograms (symbols of concept without nominal expression, as in some Chinese characters). This was revered as ‘the testament of a lost civilization—a testament of all that humankind had ever known, and of all that would ever be known.’ To the Sumerians this composition was known as the Table of Destiny (Table is a compilation) and their history records that the guardians of this Table had been Kingu (a son of Tiamat) and Tiamat’s great-grandsons Enlil and Enki. In the esoteric Jewish tradition, The Table was called ‘The Book of Raziel’—a collection of secrets cut into sapphire and inherited, at length, by King Solomon.
The philosophical cipher of the Table became known as Ha Qabala and it was said that he who possessed Qabala also possessed Ram, the highest expression of cosmic knowingness. The very name Abram or Avram means ‘(he) who possesses Ram’. We shall deal with the cabala separately.

“Abraham was told to go and spread his seed through all the planet Earth. And yet this Covenant was not kept. . . the Hoovids are the least willing to obey . . . they became confused upon planet Earth, and those of the opposition are able to manipulate them. Those of the opposition knew their strength and corrupted it. . . Now the opposition knew that if they can control the Hoovids, the rest of the civilizations weren’t as important.” (The Nine)
And so Yahweh/Lucifer was able to take the Hoovids’ nature of persistence and tenacity, even of stubbornness, and not only use it against them, but against all of the experiment on Earth, and eventually against all of Creation. Once again we have that primal error of turning away from the FATHER and the Higher Will.
“You believe you are in control but you are always controlled. You believe that you have free will –and the truth is that you do, but when you understand you have free will, totally and completely, then you give up that free will (surrender it to the Higher Will).”
As we have said, Jehovah, the God of the Jews, was not the same as God, the FATHER. In a Talmud text, it is said that in ancient times the rabbis knew there was a God above Jehovah.
The name Jehovah/Yehovah is a late and somewhat Anglicized version of Yahweh, YHWH–these four consonants once represented the Heavenly Family-–Y represented El, the Father—H was Asherah the Mother, W was He the Son, H was the Daughter Anath. In the Cabala, God’s male-female image was perpetuated. The divine marital chamber was the sanctuary of the temple, but once destroyed, the female was left to wander while Jehovah ruled on by himself.
Yahweh, as addressed in Psalm 23, is depicted in the male-female imagery of the era: as both the Shepherd and the Bride. Of the bride, the words say ‘Thou preparest a table before me . . thou anointest my head with oil’—the duties of a Jewish bride being to anoint her new husband.
The religion that stemmed from the worship of Yahweh is distinctly patriarchal, and Abraham was truly the first patriarch of the faith built around this new and most powerful god, Yahweh.
Biblical historians say that the one male god was cemented only after the Jewish captivity in Babylon around 536 BC—a thousand or more years after Abraham. So the religion of the One God, just as in Egypt, was not an overnight success. It was while in captivity that the religion spread, and the Jews returned from there as Jehovah’s ‘Chosen People’. It was also in captivity in Babylon that most of Old Testament was first written down. It is hardly surprising then that Sumerian and Mesopotamian stories should be grafted onto the early Jewish tradition, and many ideas and words associated with them such as that of the Elohim. When the Israelites returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, the first five Books of Moses were collated into the Jewish Torah (the Law). The Jews were, in fact, said to be unhappy with Jehovah because all they had done was suffer, so the Books of the prophets were added to promise ‘the Coming of the Messiah’.
This is the lord who Sitchin says identifies himself by name to Abram– “I am Yahweh . . .” Genesis 15:1 – “God Supreme, Possessor of Heaven and Earth.” And it is the jealousy of Lucifer that shines through in the biblical admonitions against the worship of “the Sun, the Moon and the host of heaven,” those gods who Abraham’s ancestors had worshipped such as the Annunaki and the other space-gods, now that the ‘only true god,’ Yahweh, was here.
Moses and Yahweh
We have already begun the story of Moses, and as surprising as it may be, it fills in many of the gaps and makes more sense than the Biblical tale.



131
It is said that it was necessary that Moses learn all the deepest secrets of the Egyptian tradition in order to know who he was and what his role was. When one knows, however, who Moses truly was, then they can understand that Moses/Akhenaton had more influence putting into the mysteries than he ever received out of them. Being who he was, the third incarnation of Lucifer—the Father of Manifestation, he already knew the secrets of Creation. His biggest question was then how to implant them deeper and further into human history away from Mankind, and share them only with the few—the Illuminated Ones. And it was not the secrets of the FATHER that he was implanting, but rather the use of power, the control of people, and the secrets of manifestation which he, the Father of Manifestation, already knew so well.
On a statue of Moses done by Michelangelo and resting at the tomb of Julius II, the patriarch and incarnation of Lucifer is actually depicted wearing horns! (Michelangelo, 1475-1564)
As Akhenaten he was banished from Egypt, taking with Him some retainers as well as “his royal scepter topped with a brass serpent.” Among the retainers who fled with Moses were the sons and families of Jacob (Israel), his loyal followers. Don’t be mistaken that everything goes perfectly for a Creator Son or an Infinite Mother Spirit here in the physical. The density of this plane and this body traps even the highest of Beings. So too did Lucifer not get everything he wanted, though his plans were long term, aimed at a future date when things would then be ready for him. Remember, he is the master of Time.
When Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, he led them across the Red Sea, which was then known as the “Reed Sea,” or the “sea of reeds,” sometimes identified as a shallow body lying north of the Red Sea, perhaps Lake Timsâ or Timash. Moses then looked for a well-known landmark, a land bridge that spanned this sea, and the Israelites went across it freely and willingly. It was this land bridge that collapsed under the weight of Pharaoh’s troops, drowning and burying them in the waters. So much for miracles.
Here it is necessary to put Moses on hold in his ‘escape’ from Egypt, for that is what it truly was, an escape, in order to go back to examine the third gift of the Annunaki to the planet Earth at the time of their leaving for it plays a major role in our story from now on.
The third gift was a simple, life-sized crystal skull, the original from which the others now found on the planet are copies. To understand the crystal skull, it will be handy to take a look at the best copy of another skull made from it, or in its likeness. This skull is commonly known as the Mitchell-Hedges Skull, because it was found by F.A. Mitchell Hedges’ adopted daughter, Anna, while on an archaeological dig in British Honduras in the 1920s.
There are two other authenticated ancient human-like quartz crystal skulls in museums, besides the Mitchell Hedges skull. The first one, which is almost life-sized, is in the British Museum of Man. Another smaller skull is in the Musee de L’Homme in Paris. The location of the original one can only be guessed at, although the group who are in possession of it can be fairly well deduced. The truth of its existence can be ascertained by the reactions to the copies, and the subsequent cult which developed in so many parts of the world around the possession of a ‘magical skull’.
The local Mayan natives attending on the dig with Mitchell Hedges are said to have gone wild with joy when they saw the unearthed artifact, and began dancing excitedly around the Skull, paying homage to it by bowing before this sacred relic. It seemed as though they recognized it. They immediately erected an altar to support the Skull for their worship.
Lubaantum, where the skull was found, was one of the last great Mayan centers built around the 8th or 9th century AD. As we know, the Mayans were a small colony of Atlantis that survived but was cut off after the Flood. They eventually managed to rebuild as best they could, a variation on the themes of Atlantean



132
culture. One particular group of priests bearing a mysterious set of tablets is said to have immigrated to South America where they found a flourishing race, the Mayas who remembered much of the ancient wisdom. Among these, the priests settled and remained. In the tenth century, the Mayas had thoroughly settled the Yucatan and the tablets were placed beneath the altar of one of the great temples of the Sun God. After the conquest of the Mayas by the Spaniards, the cities were abandoned and the treasures of the temples forgotten.
The Mayan civilization reached its zenith between 300 AD and 900 AD. Then for reasons not understood, this unique civilization collapsed and its people mysteriously disappeared or migrated elsewhere. According to legend, the skull was used by the High Priest of the Maya when performing esoteric rites. It is said that when he willed death with the help of the skull, death invariably followed. It has been described as the embodiment of all evil.
Other various odd effects the crystal skull has had on people who view it these days are most probably reactions triggered by a past-life experience with the skull in the various temples or religions in which either this copy or the original were used. It is said that, from time to time, images of temples and skulls have actually appeared inside the skull.
Modern identification techniques have been able to establish that the person who modeled for the skull was a woman in her late teens, short in stature, with possibly Amerindian features. It has also been established that the Skull was not a composite of various skulls; the cranial elements were too closely related to each other not to belong to one female subject.
Although the actual handcrafting of the quartz crystal skull can be somewhat explained, the technical knowledge of the prisms and reflected light exhibited in the carving of the skull, cannot. Long ago a hole was drilled in the bottom of its base, and two other holes drilled on either side of the jaw, allowing ancient priests to manipulate the Skull into becoming a “talking oracle” using rods or wires to move the jaw up and down.
The British Museum Skull was found in 1898, and was purchased from Tiffany’s of New York after being brought from Mexico by a Spanish officer before the French Occupation.
The third authenticated crystal skull is in the Paris Musee de L’Homme, Palais de Chaillot. The caption reads ‘Aztec civilization—Probably 15th century—believed to represent Mictlantecutli, the Aztec god of death.’
Along the way, so far, we have discussed how important crystal technology was in the last epoch of Atlantis’ existence. Edgar Cayce reported that the ‘initiates’ of Atlantis (reading #440-5;1933) engineered and manipulated precious power crystals for the production of galvanic as well as spiritual energies, crystals so potent they were in large part responsible for the Atlantean’s advanced technology. We have also discussed briefly how central some type of crystal is to the almost ubiquitous Atlantean temple form to act as a catalyzer of the Earth and ‘sky’ energies.
We have also mentioned the implantation of crystals by various races for control of their people, and without giving it much thought we can also consider how important crystal technology is to our own modern technology, especially the communication, computer and media fields. Is it then any wonder that a crystal, in this case a crystal skull, should also play such a central role in the history that lies between the times of Atlantis and our own modern technology?
The Olmecs are the race credited with having first brought civilization to Mesoamerica in about 1500 BC. But for our purposes, it is an early king of the Incas, Pachacu’tec, “transformer of the Globe,” who was said to have envisioned his future greatness in a sacred crystal bequeathed to his family by Kon-Tiki



133
Viracocha, the tall red-bearded, blue-eyed, white founding father of Andean civilization from a distant sunken homeland.
The creator god, Viracocha, was the supreme god of the Incas; however, they also worshipped the sun god, Inti, the equivalent of the Egyptian god, Ra. It is from him whom the royal family was believed to be descended. The Inca state religion in itself was highly formal, with a large number of priests to conduct its many rituals and ceremonies. In many rites, live sacrifices were offered to the gods. The sacrificial offerings were usually llamas or guinea pigs, but on the most sacred occasions or in times of disaster, human children or chosen women might be sacrificed. Priests listened to confessions of sin, which was believed to cause all evils. They also prophesied the future and treated the sick, since illness was thought to result from the ill will of a person or a god. The chosen women served the gods, especially the sun god, and certain of them, called virgins of the sun, took vows of chastity for life.
The people later known as Incas began as a small group of warlike people who spoke a Quechuan language and lived near Lake Titicaca in southeastern Peru sometime before the 13th century. According to Inca myth, the first Inca emperor, Manco Capac, and his three brothers and four sisters emerged from caves in the earth. Around the year 1200, Manco Capac led ten Inca ayllus, or clans, from Lake Titicaca north to the fertile valley of Cusco. The Incas conquered the people of the area and took it over for themselves. They founded the city of Cusco as their capital. Manco Capac married one of his sisters to establish the royal Inca bloodline. He and succeeding emperors increased their power through marriage alliances and the conquest of neighboring groups.
Among the many diverse cultures and legends of Mesoamerica there is still one belief which dominates them all: that is the legend of the god Quetzalcoatl. The name is derived from quetzal, a rare brilliantly green bird found only in the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala, and coatl, or serpent. Thus he was, literally, plumed serpent. The earliest myth of Quetzalcoatl that has been translated is of a god, wise, pure and good. He appeared among the people to teach them the arts and sciences and to give them a calendar. He fell into temptation, drank and sank into carnality. In repentance he cast himself into the ritual flames. The names of Quetzalcoatl are legion: Kukulcan, Gucumatz, Plumed Serpent, Ehcatl the god of the wind. As Lord of the Dawn, the morning star, he was the personification of the planet Venus.
In the myth, Quetzalcoatl, with his twin, or double, Xolotl, visited the Land of the Dead. On the eighth day he ascended as the Lord of the Dawn, the morning star. Xolotl is often represented as a fleshless skull. In Aztec and Nahuatl legend he is called a sorcerer. Xolotl also symbolizes fire and water—the fire that falls from the sky, or lightening. Xolotl is shown in the codice Borgia, now in the library of the Vatican, as born of water, as is lightening from a cloud. (The codices are esoteric paintings on animal skins) . . . Xolotl’s title was ‘twin brother of Quetzalcoatl, creator of man.’
The Mesoamerica calendar, used by the Olmecs, Toltec, Mixtec, and the people of Oaxaca, had a count of 365.2422 days of the year, as compared to the one in use now of 365.2420 days. Aware that the calendar was short of the true year, they kept careful records of the accumulated error. . . The Mayan sacred ritualistic calendar was 260 days. The two calendars meshed and returned to a given starting point every 52 years. . . Quetzalcoatl’s birth (of the man) on the day One Reed in the year One Reed signified that he was born at the beginning of a new cycle. Just as we think of Jesus being born in the year 0 even though we know he wasn’t. These new cycles begin with the opening of a portal based on a particular alignment of stars and other celestial mechanics.
Quetzalcoatl appears as the constant benefactor of mankind, and after having created man, he sought to nourish him. He discovered corn, which he gave to man. He taught man how to polish jade and other



134
precious stones, and how to locate deposits of them. He showed him how to weave multicolored fabrics from the miraculous cotton that grew in different colors; he taught him how to do mosaic work with feathers of the quetzal bird, the bluebird, the hummingbird, the macaw and others. But above all he taught man science, thereby endowing him with the means to measure time and study the movement of the stars; he taught him how to arrange a calendar and devised ceremonies and fixed certain days for prayers and sacrifices.
As the Biblical prophecies foretold of a prophet from the line of David, so too did the Mayan calendar forecast the birth of a child: Ce Acatl Topiltzen Quetzalcoatl. He was born on the day One Reed, in the year One Reed, by their ceremonial calendar. The general course of his life was laid out in the prophecies, but that life was only one portion of a vast epic. He has been called the greatest figure in the ancient history of Mesoamerica, with a code of ethics and a love for the arts and sciences.
Laurette Sejourne states in Burning Water: “His essential role as founder of Nahuatl culture was never questioned by any of the historians of the 16th and 17th centuries, who also state that just as our era began with Christ, so that of the Aztecs and their predecessors began—approximately at the same time—with Quetzalcoatl. His image, the plumed serpent, had for pre-Colombian people the same evocative force as the crucifix did for Christianity.”
There are two interpretations of Quetzalcoatl: one is the man, and one is the legend or deity. The historical man has been attributed with all of the characteristics of the mythical god, Quetzalcoatl. (Historians place the dates of his life from 747 AD to 799 AD, but according to Jose Arguelles in Surfers of the Zuvuya, he lived from 947 AD to 999 AD. Our information is that it was more toward the 6th century AD that he actually lived.
In Aztec Thought and Culture, Miguel Leon-Portilla comments: “These ancient people were called Toltecs, which in Nahuatl means ‘master craftsmen,” an expression given to initiates in Freemasonry.
“So remarkable were these Toltecs that they knew all mechanical skills and in all of these were unique and exquisite craftsmen, for they were painters, stoneworkers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, workers in feathers and ceramics, spinners, weavers . . . The Toltecs had much experience and knowledge in the qualities and virtues of herbs, and they left docketed and named those now used for treating, because they were also physicians and the best in the arts . . . they were the first inventors of medicine. The Toltecs were good men and drawn to virtue . . . they were tall, larger in body than those who live now . . The civilization of the Toltecs spread all over Mesoamerica and the leader of this great civilization was a king called Quetzalcoatl.”
To the Nahuatl, the word “face” referred to the ego, as in ‘saving face’. Leon Portilla also comments at length on Nahuatl metaphysical and theological ideas. From a poem included in the Toltec-Chichimec History (circa 1540): ‘The mirror which illumines is identified with the god of duality, creator of men, whose light illumines all that exists.’ It should be noted that a clear contrast exists between Tezcatlanextia and Tezcatlipoca (smoking mirror); one illumines, the other obscures with his smoke.”
There are a number of different issues to be addressed here besides obviously the crystal skull. The first is the origins of the ‘Toltec Indians’. The Toltec Indians as they are known to the world, were one of those races mentioned earlier who visited the planet for one purpose or another, and then moved on. They were from a far distant planet from which they had ventured forth to explore the galaxy, thus their relatively brief stay on this planet in terms of history
The second issue is Quetzalcoatl. The leader of the Toltecs was not Quetzalcoatl, although he may have been likened to him for many reasons. As the text says, it is important to separate the myth here from



135
the man, but the words used to describe him again give it away— ‘the plumed serpent’, ‘Lord of the Dawn, the morning star’, ‘sorcerer’, ‘the mirror which illumines’, ‘the god of duality, creator of men, whose light illumines all that exists’, and ‘Tezcatlipoca (the smoking mirror)—the two-faced god who obscures with his smoke’.
Quetzalcoatl is indeed the sixth incarnation of the seven Lucifer has had upon this Earth in modern times. As with his other incarnations that we have so far dealt with, and also a clue to the ones we have not yet dealt with, Lucifer had once again set himself up as a god through his knowledge of manifestation and creation. Each time, however, there is the duality—the mirror that illumines and the mirror that obscures with smoke—“He fell into temptation, drank and sank into carnality.” The legends give us the one side, the reality gives us the other. Ra, Melchizedek, Akhenaton/Moses, and now Quetzalcoatl.
Chapter 17 Judaism—The Branches Divide
To put things into perspective, it is important to recognize that just about everything we now about the life and civilizations of the distant BC years has been learned since the late 1800s. Prior to that, the Old Testament was one of very few documents of record. The Old Testament was never intended to be an accurate reporting of history though; it was actually a book of scripture designed to underpin a growing religious movement. To some extent, just like the scriptures of other religions, the Hebrew writings were based upon mythological tradition, but since the inherent stories were never found until recently in any adition, but since the inherent stories were never found until recently in any other documented form, the Old Testament has, for countless centuries, been treated as if it were an absolute factual truth. And so, the mythology became designated as history by governing and educational establishments, and it has been taught as such in schools and churches for the longest time.
We now have a vast amount of original New Testament compiled in the 4th century A.D.
The mountain generally known as Mount Sinai sits in the south of the peninsular - quite near to the bottom point of the upturned triangle - and it was given its name in the 4th century by a mission of Greek Christian monks 1700 years after the time of Moses. It is now sometimes called Gebel Musa (or Mount of Moses) and there is still a Christian retreat there called St. Catherine’s Monastery. However, this is not the Sinai Mountain which the Bible calls Mount Horeb.
The book of Exodus goes into some detail to explain the route taken by Moses and the Israelites from the Egyptian Nile delta land of Goshen - down across the wilderness regions of Shur and Paran in northern Sinai, to the land of Midian (which is to the north of present-day Jordan).
From this route it becomes very easy to identify the location of Mount Horeb, which sits a good deal north of Gebel Musa. The word Horeb simply means ‘desert’, and the great desert mountain which soars to over 2600 feet within a high stone plateau above the Plain of Paran is today called Serâbît el-Khâdim (the Prominence of the Khâdim).
In the late 1890s, the British Egyptologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, a professor at the University College, London, applied to the Egypt Exploration Fund to take an expedition into Sinai. By January 1904, his team had departed and in March of that year they took their expedition to the heights of Mount Serâbît. In the following year Petrie published the detailed results of his findings, but added to his report the fact



136
that, to his dismay, this information would not be made available to the Egypt Exploration Fund subscribers who would receive only maps and a general outline. Petrie explained that, from the time of that Sinai expedition (even though he had taken previously funded teams into Egypt), his sponsorship by the Fund was terminated - ostensibly because he had broken the binding rule of the Articles by divulging something which was contrary to Bible teaching. He had, in fact, discovered the great secret of the sacred mountain of Moses - a secret which not only made sense of the Exodus portrayals, but which blew the lid totally from their common scriptural interpretation.
Remember in the Bible, that it says that the Hebrews encountered these mean, war-like peoples called the Amalekites out on the Sinai Peninsula as they were exiting Egypt? Moses wanted to fight them, but the Hebrew people said “no, these are fierce tribesmen, there’s hundreds of thousands of them, and we don’t want to fight them”. And so they avoided fighting them. It was Velikovsky who found out that at the very same time they were having all the plagues in Egypt they were also having plagues over in the TigrisEuphrates valley, and the ruling tribe, the Amalekites, exited the Tigris-Euphrates valley at the same time the Hebrews were exiting Egypt. They literally passed each other on the Sinai with the Amalekites coming west as the Hebrews were going east. They arrived in Egypt and there was no Pharaoh and there was no army, and literally, these Arabs, destroyed and killed everyone. All they left were the lesser people, who they kept as slaves for themselves, but they hacked and killed and slaughtered everyone else. They destroyed the temples; they wiped out a very high culture at the end of old kingdom Egypt. By the time they woke up to the fact of what they had destroyed, the knowledge that was gone, it was too late. The only people that knew how to recreate it, those who were still alive, were the Hebrews, and they were out on the Sinai.
The purpose of our story here is not solely to track the alien interaction with the planet, or the lost history that has been stolen from us, nor is it solely to share with the reader the various incarnations of Lucifer. Certainly it is all of these and more. The goal I had started out with when writing the first draft of the book was to follow the influence of Lucifer on the planet, and central to this were the organizations through which Lucifer’s power was manifested –his power bases if you will—as they changed throughout the course of history from one to another, especially between his incarnations. Always there is a ‘political’ arm of this powerbase, and always a religious arm.
Beginning with the Sorcerer-kings of Atlantis who maintained both arms of political and religious power under their control, the powerbase shifted after the Flood to Egypt to the pharaohs with the coming of Ra. They, as priest-kings, held both elements of the power. The same with Melchezidek, priest-king of Salem who took the power after Ra to the lands of Israel and set up the powerbase there which included the worship of Baal, Beelzebub, and Yahweh. The powerbase then remained in Israel throughout the Biblical times with Moses bringing that power of Lucifer back with him.
The second great foundation story is that of Moses and the Exodus where the story goes on to pit “Israel” against “them” (“the nations”) as Moses returns to urge Pharaoh to let the Hebrews leave Egypt. This is a trait very noticeable in the Luciferian powerbases as they try to exert his influence onto the rest of the world. Yet it is that the narrator in the Bible insists that it was God himself who increasingly hardened Pharaoh’s heart, lest he relent and relieve the suffering of Moses and his people. Why? God speaking
through Moses threatens Pharaoh with devastating slaughter and concludes by declaring, “but against any of the Israelites, not a dog shall growl—so that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.” (Exodus. 11:7) Why where the Israelites a chosen people? Because for that long period of time written about in the Bible from Melchezidek through the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, they were the ones to hold the power of Lucifer, and they let other people know it.



137
What the Bible does not make clear here is that the Sinai was not a foreign land to the Egyptians. It was actually regarded as a part of Egypt and came under pharaonic control. So Moses and the Israelites had not left Egypt once they were east of the Nile delta - they were still in Egypt, having the whole Sinai peninsular to cross before they entered the Palestinian land of Canaan.
During the time of Moses, Sinai came under the control of two Egyptian officials: the Royal Chancellor and the Royal Messenger. This was the era of Egypt’s 18th dynasty - the dynasty of the Tuthmosis and Amenhotep pharaohs, along with Akhenaten/Moses and Tutankhamun. The Royal Messenger of those times was an official called Neby. He was also the mayor and troop commander of Zaru in the Egyptian delta region of Goshen, where the Israelites had lived before the exodus.
The position of Royal Chancellor was hereditary in the Hyksos family of Pa-Nehas, and Panahesy of this family was the official Governor of Sinai. We know him better from the Bible as Phinehas. He became one of the first priests of the new Mosaic structure, but had previously been the Chief Priest at Pharaoh Akhenaten’s temple at Amarna.
In order to understand the root significance of Petrie’s discovery, it is worth making a necessary distinction between the Israelites and the Hebrews of the Mosaic era. At that time, they were not one and the same as Bible teaching seems to indicate. The Hebrews were the family and descendants of Abraham, whose place of residence was, in the main, Canaan (Palestine). The Israelites, on the other hand, were the family and descendants of one of Abraham’s grandsons - the man called Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel. It was his family alone who had moved into Egypt, and it was their descendants who eventually returned with Moses to be reunited, after countless generations, with their fellow Hebrews. It is also with Jacob/Israel that the Lord makes his covenant—giving them the power.
The difference between the two strains was, of course, that the Israelites had long been subjected to the laws and religions of Egypt, and they knew very little about the customs of their cousins hundreds of miles away in Canaan. Through more than 400 years they had been in an environment which supported a whole pantheon of gods and, although they had developed a One God concept within their own fraternity, that god was not the Jehovah of the Canaanite Hebrews. Their god was a faceless entity whom they called, quite simply, the Lord. In the Israelite tongue, he was called the Adon. This is one of the reasons why the names Lord and Jehovah were separately identified in early texts, even though they were brought under the wrap of the single God in later times to suit the emergent Jewish and Christian faiths. To the Egyptians, the name of this Lord (Adon) was quite similar, and they called him Aten - from which derived the name of Pharaoh Akhenaten (Servant of Aten).
So, when Moses and the Israelites made their exodus into Sinai, they arrived not as worshippers of Jehovah, but of Aten, and it was for this very reason that they were presented with new laws and ordinances to bring them into line with the Hebrew culture of their prospective new homeland.
When Moses and the Israelites left the Egyptian delta, their obvious route to Canaan would have been directly across the wilderness of northern Sinai but, instead, they pushed southward into the difficult high country to spend time at the Horeb mountain of Serâbît. This was the anomaly which had long puzzled Petrie and his team.
What then did the Petrie expedition discover high on the Bible’s holy mountain? Well, to begin with, they found nothing very much, but on a wide plateau near the summit there were distinct signs of ancient habitation. Pillars and standing-stones could be seen protruding above the ground—rubble which had been deposited by wind and landslides over some 3000 years. Subsequent to clearing this rubble, however, the truth of the Bible story emerged and Petrie wrote:



138
“There is no other such monument which makes us regret that it is not in better preservation. The whole of it was buried, and no one had any knowledge of it until we cleared the site.”
What they found was an enormous Egyptian temple complex. Set within an enclosure wall was an outer temple built over an expanse of 230 feet (c.70 meters) and this extended outwards from an inner temple cut within a great cave in the mountainside. From the various cartouches, carvings and inscriptions it emerged that the temple had been in use from as far back as the time of Pharaoh Sneferu, who reigned about 2600 BC and whose immediate successors were reckoned to have built the pyramids of Gizeh.
The above-ground part of the temple was constructed from sandstone quarried from the mountain cave, and it contained a series of adjoined halls, shrines, courts, cubicles and chambers. Of these, the key features unearthed were the main Sanctuary, the Shrine of Kings, the Portico Court, and the Hall of the goddess Hathor to whom the whole complex was dedicated. All around were pillars and stele denoting the Egyptian kings throughout the ages, with certain pharaohs such as Tuthmosis III (founder of the Rosicrucian movement in Egypt) depicted many times on standing-stones and wall reliefs.
The adjoining Cave of Hathor was carved into the natural rock, with flat inner walls that had been carefully smoothed. In the centre (from about 1820 BC) stood a large upright pillar of Pharaoh Amenemhet III, the son-in-law of Esau. Also portrayed were his senior chamberlain and his seal-bearer. Deep within the cave Petrie found a limestone stela of pharaoh Ramses I - a slab upon which Ramses (who is traditionally reckoned by Egyptologists to have been an opposer of the Aten cult) surprisingly described himself as ‘The ruler of all that Aten embraces’.
Also found was an Amarna statue-head of Akhenaten’s mother, Queen Tiye of Egypt, with her cartouche set in the crown.
In the courts and halls of the outer temple were numerous stone-carved rectangular tanks and circular basins, along with a variety of curiously shaped bench-tables with recessed fronts and split-level surfaces. There were also round tables, trays and saucers, together with alabaster vases and containers, many of which were shaped like lotus-flowers. In addition, the rooms housed a good collection of glazed plaques, cartouches, scarabs and sacred ornaments, designed with spirals, diagonal-squares and basket-work. There were magical wands of an unidentified hard material, while in the portico were two conical stones of about 6 inches and 9 inches in height, respectively. The explorers were baffled enough by these, but they were further confounded by the discovery of a metallurgist’s crucible.
Ever since this discovery, Egyptologists have argued as to why a crucible would have been necessary in a temple, while at the same time debating a mysterious substance called mfkzt, which seemed to be related to the conical stones and which has numerous mentions in wall and stele inscriptions. Some have suggested that mfkzt might have been copper; many have preferred the idea of turquoise and others have supposed it was perhaps malachite, but they are all unsubstantiated guesses and there are no traces of any of these materials at the site. Sinai is noted for its turquoise mines, but if turquoise-mining had been a primary function of the temple masters over so many centuries, then one would expect to find turquoise stones in abundance within the tombs of Egypt. However, such is not the case; hardly any have been found.
Other causes of wonderment have been the innumerable inscribed references to ‘bread’, along with the prominent hieroglyph for ‘light’, found in the Shrine of the Kings. But the discovery which caused the most bewilderment was the unearthing of something which was identified as the enigmatic mfkzt to which the ‘bread’ symbolism appeared to be related. Laying some inches deep beneath heavy flagstones in a storeroom was a considerable supply of the finest pure white, unadulterated powder.



139
At the time some suggested that the powder could be a remnant of copper smelting but, as was quickly pointed out, smelting does not produce white powder; it leaves a dense black slag. Moreover, there is no supply of copper ore within miles of the temple and the old smelting works are, in any event, apparent in the distant valleys. Others guessed that the powder was ash from the burning of plants to produce alkali, but there was no trace whatever of any plant residue.
For want of any other explanation, it was determined that the white powder and the conical stones were probably associated with some form of sacrificial rite, but again it was pointed out that this was an Egyptian temple and animal sacrifice was not an Egyptian practice. Moreover, despite sieving and winnowing, there were no remnants whatever of bones or any other foreign matter to be found within the mfkzt, which appeared for the entire world like a hoard of sacred talcum-powder.
Some of the mysterious powder was taken back to Britain for analysis and examination, but no results were ever published. The rest was left open to the elements after 3000 years to become a victim of the desert winds. What has become apparent, however, is that this powder was seemingly identical to the ancient Mesopotamian fire-stone or shem-an-na, the substance that was made into bread-cakes and used to feed the Light-bodies of the Babylonian kings and the pharaohs of Egypt. This, of course, explains the temple inscriptions denoting the importance of bread and light, while the white powder (the shem-an-na) has been identified with the sacred manna that Aaron placed in the Ark of the Covenant.
***It was this white powder which allowed the high priests and other ‘worthy’ people to read the soundencoded ancient alchemical texts known to us now as The Emerald Tablets of Thoth, those which contained the ancient Wisdom of Lamech.
It may be best here to take a quick look at the material aspect of these tablets, since they play such a large role in our story. There are twelve tablets of emerald green, formed from a substance created through alchemical transmutation. They are imperishable, resistant to all elements and substances. In effect, the atomic and cellular structure is fixed, no change ever taking place. In this respect, they violate the material law of ionization. Upon them are engraved characters in the ancient Atlantean language: characters which respond to attuned thought waves, releasing the associated mental vibration in the mind of the reader. The tablets are fastened together with hoops of golden-colored alloy suspended from a rod of the same material. So much for the material appearance. The wisdom contained therein is the foundation of the
ancient mysteries. And for the one who reads with open eyes and mind, his wisdom shall be increased a hundred-fold. What it took in those days and ever since for the initiated ones to ‘open the eyes and mind’, the third eye and spiritual mind in order to read the higher dimensional wisdom of these characters, was the white powder known as ‘the shem-an-na’. Thus the importance of alchemy to the secret societies and brotherhoods who drew their Dark wisdom from the tablets, going beyond the actual words inscribed there and into a higher dimensional state of telepathic thought transference from the sound-encoded words. This too is the wisdom of the Cabala that we shall take a look at soon.
The power is in the ‘thought attunement’ to the sound of the words—hence the importance of reading the sacred texts out loud as is done now in all three major religions from this area of the world –Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Thus also ‘the lost word’ or ‘name’ of the Freemasons—‘shem’ being the word for ‘name’ often translated as ‘word’. Hence it is not the ‘word’ that is sought in the Masonic allegorical play portraying the death of the Master builder Hiram Abiff, but the ‘name’, the drug that would allow the higher wisdom to be known and give those who take it access to its power.
What we have had happening on this planet for so many thousands of years is simply nothing more than galactic drug wars!



140
It was with this drug that Hathor ‘controlled’ the Egyptian gods in Zep Tepi. It was Shem, the son of Noah, who brought this knowledge with him from the ante-diluvial world. It was the major reason the Annunaki came here to mine gold—not to suspend in their atmosphere as Sitchin tries to cover up, but to provide the necessary drugs both to themselves and to their intra-galactic drug trade between both the Sirians and the Orionites.
It is these 12 tablets when “fastened together with hoops of golden-colored alloy suspended from a rod of the same material” and an axe inserted into the bundle—an axe which is the hieroglyphic symbol from ancient Egypt of being under the guardianship of the Gods, which forms the ancient Roman symbol of the ‘faschii’. This was the original symbol of the Fascists. This too is a New World Order symbol so commonly placed all around us as to be present in many official government institutions gripped in the talons of the Eagle, a symbol that we shall interpret later.
Man has always tried to altar his perception through the use of stimulants, narcotics and so-called mind-expansion techniques, rather than to do the slow, steady, disciplined work of conscious spiritual awakening. For the alien gods, for their offspring here on Earth, for those in the world today still trying to seek ‘a quick way out’ --the effects are varied, ranging from limited perception of secrets and levels of consciousness that one has not earned or built up the accompanying moral fiber to deal with properly (As the Nine suggest), to the outright trap of falling for the worship of the lesser Light of Lucifer. That is why in the ancient Mystery Schools it was necessary to have 12 years of the Right Eye of Horus or emotional body training before learning the secrets of the Left Eye of Horus. Without the feminine aspect of Creation, all we are left with is the One God, Lucifer, and his patriarchal Dark-sided magick.
Hence this substance, the ‘shem-an-na’ is known as the Philosopher’s Stone, because it elevates one into the mysteries of the Mind, unfortunately without also the corresponding lifting in the level of the Heart.
In the book of Exodus, it relates that it was the Master Craftsman who made the original shewbread for Moses in Sinai, a tradition still held true today in the alchemical laboratories of the secret societies of Master Craftsmen, the Freemasonic Order. For Moses, it was Bezaleel who made the shewbread, but Bezaleel was not a baker, he was a noted goldsmith. This confirms precisely the function of the priestly Master Craftsmen in Mesopotamia - the vulcans and metallurgists of Tubal-cain who manufactured the valuable ‘shem-an-na’ form of pure white powder gold. As for the crucible, the conical stones and the great array of tanks, tables and equipment which made the Sinai temple appear more like a gigantic laboratory than a church, it emerges that this is precisely what it was.
What Petrie had actually found was the alchemical workshop of Akhenaten and of the numerous dynasties of pharaohs before him - a temple laboratory where the furnace would have roared and smoked in the production of the sacred fire-stone of the high-spin ‘shem-an-na’. Quite suddenly, the words of Exodus begin to make sense as we read them again with a wholly new insight:
“And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke ... and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.”
In Exodus we read that Moses took the golden calf, which the Israelites had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ‘ground it to a powder’. This is precisely the process of a ‘shem-an-na’ furnace and it is evident



141
that the Egyptian priests of the goddess Hathor had been working their fire for countless generations before the priests of Aten became involved in the time of Moses.
Abraham
It was at the stage of Sumerian history when the empire fell that Abraham was forced to flee northward from the city of Ur. But what had happened to the Anunnaki: the Grand Assembly of gods who had established everything?
“Ur is destroyed, bitter is its lament. The country’s blood now fills its holes like hot bronze in a mould. Bodies dissolve like fat in the sun. Our temple is destroyed. Smoke lies on our cities like a shroud. The gods have abandoned us like migrating birds” (a wonderful image of the gods craft flying away in formation, leaving a temporary nesting site).
In historical terms, this total collapse of the Sumerian empire follows the founding of Babylon by King Ur-Baba in about 2000 BC. Indeed, the story of the Tower of Babel, and the resultant wrath of Jehovah precisely fits the time-frame of the Sumerians’ own abandonment by the Anunnaki around the time of that 2164 BC alignment.
The story in Genesis relates that the people, who were hitherto said by Jehovah to be ‘very good’, were punished severely because of a strange transgression which had not previously been ruled upon. The apparent transgression was that they all spoke the same language - and the unique language which they all spoke was, of course, Sumerian: the first comprehensively written language on Earth.
For a reason which is not made clear in the Bible, the Genesis text explains that Jehovah was not happy about the Tower of Babel - and so he ‘did come down, and did confound the language of all the earth’. The Sumerian historical documents tell much the same story, except that the confounding of language is far better explained by the hordes of foreign invaders who came into the region.
The gates of Sumer were opened to let in invaders from the surrounding nations. The scribes recorded that Jehovah brought the great and terrible storm which caused the annihilation of all the Sumerian culture so that their language was no longer predominant and there was a great confusion of tongues. The Atra-hasis Epic reveals that, prior to the Biblical Flood, Enki had tried to reduce the population by means of selective famines and plagues, but without success. This new god Jehovah new how to do it easily.
All the work that had been accomplished in building up a unique civilization over thousands of years was destroyed in one fell swoop by Jehovah simply because he was a jealous god. The records confirm that, at that moment in Sumerian history, the Grand Assembly of the Anunnaki simply vacated their seats and departed ‘like migrating birds’.
With their leaving, the creation of a more permanent and versatile substitute for ‘the Star Fire’ or white-powder gold they had been making, was not a problem, for this was the province of a group of previously trained metallurgists who were called the Master Craftsmen. The first of these great metallurgists to be trained had been Tubal-cain, the vulcan - a sixth-generation descendant of Cain, who is remembered today in modern Freemasonry.
In consideration of the Bible’s New Testament, it is of particular interest to note that Jesus’ father, Joseph, was himself recorded in the early Gospels as being a Master Craftsman. In modern Englishlanguage Bibles, he is described as a carpenter, but this is a blatant mistranslation. The word ‘carpenter’ was wrongly derived from the Greek ‘ho-tekton’ (a derivative of the Semitic naggar) which actually defined



142
a Master of the Craft (or Master Craftsman). Joseph was, therefore, not a wood-worker, but a learned alchemical metallurgist in the manner of his ancestral forebears.
It is in the Old Testament book of Exodus that we are introduced to this Bezaleel (the son of Uri Ben Hur) who made the original shewbread for Moses in Sinai. Bezaleel was a man said to have been filled with the spirit of the Elohim (the Anunnaki) in wisdom, understanding and knowledge. We learn that Bezaleel was also a skilled goldsmith and Master Craftsman who was placed in overall charge of building the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant.
It was in this forge going on ‘Mt. Sinai’ that Bezaleel made the white powder of gold which at 1,160 degrees can be melted to a transparent glass of gold, literally becoming a glass as clear as window glass, and yet it is pure gold, not a gold compound but pure gold. This ‘gold glass’ can then be taken and with a mortar and pestle ground right back to the white powder, or as we shall later see, turned into the finest pieces of cathedral glass Man has ever known.
“The neat thing about gold, as compared to the other elements, is that gold can be purified by distillation. At 450 degrees elemental gold will resonance disconnect from itself and will go over as a gas and be re-condensed over here and be caught as white powder again. And so you can purify it, back and forth, by repeated distillation, and get a very high purity substance. It’s called the “white dew”, the “white
condensate”, “the white dove” or it’s depicted as a white feather in the alchemical texts, because that’s the way it was purified as a volatile material . . . All of the symbols of being fed by a dove, or receiving the white dove, is always an alchemical symbol. The knowledge of this substance was kept by the Hebrews until the destruction of the first temple.
“Basically this is the basis of all religions of the world. How many times have you heard “cleanse yourself”, “purify yourself”, “prepare yourself like a bride in the bridal chamber”, “for the coming of the father”. What they don’t go on and tell you is what happens in the bridal chamber, you become inseminated in the bridal chamber. But you receive the semen of the father in Heaven. This is done over a forty day period during a forty day fast. It was called the Egyptian rite of passage. It went nine days with no food to totally cleanse the digestive system, and then they took this material, or the “semen of the Father in Heaven”, for the next thirty days. It was called “the Bread of Life” and the “Bread of Life” was mixed with the water and was called the “Living Water”. This material is what Moses commanded Bezaleel, the goldsmith, to make. It wasn’t a baker, it wasn’t a woman, it was a goldsmith who was told to prepare the “Bread of the presence of God”, and this “Bread of the presence of God” was set out on a golden table in front of the Ark of the Covenant.”
This Shem-an-na then is the foundation stone mentioned as being set in front of ‘the Holy of Holies’ to be partaken of before entering to see or hear the Lord. All of this was, of course, after going through some process such as Enki and Enlil did in the “Purification Place.” This necessary cleansing process was then turned into a ritual washing of the feet in later days in many various religions, or even entire body cleansings such as is common in many Temple ceremonies.
Right before the temple was destroyed, we find that Solomon has gotten a woman pregnant who came from Egypt. This woman was, in fact, the Pharaoh of Egypt. Her name was Hatshepsut. She then returned back to Egypt and gave birth to a son whose name was Menelik. Menelik later returned to Jerusalem when he was twenty one, seeking acknowledgment from Solomon that he was his son. Solomon, for his part, acknowledged Menelik, but the Levites, the high priests, rebelled. At a time when the racial purity of the kingly line must be preserved, here was a half breed as the eldest son of Solomon, to be the next king of Jerusalem. The Levites said, “You must send your son away, he must be sent away”. And



143
Solomon, in his infinite wisdom, said, ‘If I must send my son away, all of you Levites must send your eldest sons away as well’. So all of the eldest sons of the Levites left along with Menelik, but when they left, they took the Ark of the Covenant with them, and in it, the supply of shem-an-na—the shewbread.
In detailing how Bezaleel should manufacture various crowns, rings, bowls and a candlestick, all of pure gold, the Bible text adds to the list the ‘shewbread’ of the Covenant and, without further explanation, the deed is seen to be done.
Although the word ‘covenant’ has come to be identified with contractual agreements, it originally meant ‘to eat bread with’, and it is pertinent to note that the Christian Lord’s Prayer (which was itself transposed from an Egyptian equivalent) specifies, ‘Give us this day our daily bread’. This is often taken to relate to sustenance in general terms, but in the original tradition the reference was more specifically directed to the enigmatic shewbread - the golden bread of Bezaleel.
The book of Leviticus also refers to the shewbread, stating: ‘And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof ... And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row”. (Remember that the traditional gifts of the Magi –the magicians—to Jesus were gold, frankincense and myrrh, myrrh being the female essence as opposed to the frankincense which was the male essence) The use of the word ‘flour’ in English translations is actually incorrect and the word ‘powder’ would be more accurate. The records of the mystery schools cite rather more precisely that shewbread was made with the white powder of gold.
In this instance, the correct word ‘powder’ is used - but firing gold does not, of course, produce powder; it actually produces molten gold. So what was this magical white powder? Is there a way of using heat to transform metallic gold into a white powder which is ingestible and beneficial? Indeed there is, and it is here that the foremost alchemical principle of the Master Craftsmen was applied: ‘To make gold, you must take gold’.
Gold is the most noble of metals and was always representative of Truth. Through the regular use of Star Fire (the Gold of the Gods)—the white powder shem-an-na, they were moved into realms of heightened awareness and consciousness because of its inherent melatonin and serotonin, the great infusion of light it gave to the third eye or uraeus. The serpent of the body’s energy rising from the root chakra throughout life is known as the kundalini. When sufficiently lifted so as to reach the third eye, it too can produce a magnificent burst of Light which lifts the Soul of the Being into transcendent states of awareness. When done incorrectly or without the accompanying spiritual balance, this occurrence can be unbalancing and even deadly.
The ‘shem-an-na’, as with all artificial stimulants, may have the same desired effect, but for only short periods, and then without the accompanying balancing of energies which is required to maintain a person at that level or keep his physical body in connection with the transcendent soul. Like all drugs, because the effect is fleeting, one requires more and more of the drug to produce the same ‘high’. Meanwhile, the physical body suffers and decays, often quite rapidly as in the aging experienced by some of the older Annunaki such as Mammi.
This realm of advanced enlightenment to which the shewbread lifted these Beings was called the Plane of Sharon, and the Star Fire gold was deemed to be the ultimate route to the Light. Hence, the heavy, mundane person (lead) could be elevated to a heightened state of awareness (perceived as gold), and this was the root of all alchemical lore thereafter.



144
The shewbread (or as the Egyptians called it, scheffa-food) was a traditional entitlement of the Israelite and Egyptian Messiahs, for the early pharaohs were themselves fully consecrated priest-kings of the Grail bloodline, having descended through King Nimrod in the Cainite succession.
In ancient Egypt, the scheffa-food was always depicted as a conical cake. This metallic bread was used to feed the Light body, as against the physical body, and the Light body (the Ka) was deemed to be the consciousness. As far back as 2200 BC, the pharaohs were using this supplement to enhance their pituitary and pineal activity, thereby heightening their perception, awareness and intuition - but only the metallurgical adepts of the mystery schools (the Master Craftsmen) knew the secret of its manufacture.
When Adam and Eve were withheld from ‘immortality’, what was being withheld from them was the shewbread, the shem-an-na.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead (the oldest complete book in the world), the pharaoh in search of ultimate food of enlightenment asks, at every stage of his journey, the single overriding question, ‘What is it?’ - A question which in the Hebrew language (as explained in The Antiquities of the Jews) was asked by the single word: Manna?
When the Ark of the Covenant was completed, Aaron was said to have placed an omer of manna into the Ark. This sacred manna was commonly associated with a mystical form of bread: the shewbread or, as it was called in Tubal-cain’s Mesopotamia, the shem-an-na. At this point, we come to a particularly important definition of the shewbread for, according to the Master Craftsmen, this conical-shaped (or shemshaped) food was made of ‘highward fire-stone’.
In the New Testament book of the Revelation it is related:
“To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the hidden manna. And will give him a white stone.”
Before investigating the precise nature of the white stone of the shem-an-na (the bread made from the white powder of alchemical gold), it is worth considering the famous statue of Priest-king Melchizedek at Chartres Cathedral in France. The statue portrays Melchizedek with a cup containing a stone in representation of the bread and wine which he apparently offered to Abraham, according to the book of Genesis. The wine, as we know, was emblematic of the sacred Star Fire (just as Communion wine represents the Messianic blood today), but the true importance of the imagery is that the bread/stone is held within the cup, thereby signifying that Star Fire was replaced by a substitute nourishment at the very time of Melchizedek and Abraham. This substitute was made from shem-an-na - the white powder of gold, which the Mesopotamians called ‘highward fire-stone’.
The object of the substitute was very straightforward. Instead of feeding the recipient with a direct hormonal supplement, the powder had its effect on the endocrine system (particularly on the pineal gland), thereby causing the recipient to manufacture his own super high levels of hormones such as melatonin. In the famous Middle-Age Grail romance of Parzival, by Wolfram von Eschenbach, it is said of the Temple knights of Grail Castle:
“They live by virtue of a stone most pure. If you do not know its name, now learn: it is called lapis exilis. By the power of the stone the phoenix is burned to ashes. But the ashes speedily restore it to life.”
“The phoenix thus moults, and thereupon gives out a bright light, so that it is as beautiful as before.”
Many have wondered about the name lapis exilis because it appears to be a play on words, combining two elements. Firstly, it is lapis ex caelis - meaning ‘stone from the heavens’—a version we shall deal with



145
later. Secondly, it is lapis elixir - the Philosophers’ Stone by which base elements are transformed to higher states of being.
One of the keys to the Parzival allegory lies in the description that the phoenix is ‘burned to ashes’, but from those very ashes comes the great enlightenment. So, what exactly is a phoenix? It is a mythical bird, one might answer - but this would be quite wrong. The word ‘phoenix’ is far older than the bennu-bird mythology and it is, in fact, ancient Greco-Phoenician. Phoenix means ‘crimson’ or ‘red-gold’.
An old Alexandrian alchemical text makes particular mention of the weight of the fire-stone - which it calls the Stone of Paradise. It states that, ‘when placed in the scales, the stone can outweigh its quantity of gold, but when it is transposed to dust, even a feather will tip the scales against it’. In terms of a mathematical formula, this was written as: 0 = (+1) + (-1). This appears to be a very straightforward sum at first glance, because (+1) + (-1) does indeed equal ‘0’. But when applied to physical matter it is actually an impossibility because it relies upon using a positive and an equivalent negative to produce nothing. (The zero density Kryon talks about giving the ability to time travel).
FOR THOSE BEINGS BORN OR CREATED WITH INSUFFICIENT LIGHT, DARK BEINGS, THIS IS THE WAY THEY GET THEIR LIGHT! --like vampires sucking the life from others in the blood, so to does Lucifer and those who work for him suck that very essence of Light from another being.
With secret societies, much like in olden days with the Annunaki, with the Pharaohs and with the Priest-kings, the leaders remain young and vital throughout long lives while the followers are drained of life and their energies and that of ‘the land’ as well.
The moment one has a positive piece of something it is not possible to add an equivalent negative of that something to produce nothing. At best, one could move the positive something out of immediate sight but it would still exist and would, therefore, not be nothing. The only way to turn something into nothing as far as the material field is concerned is to translate the something into another dimension so that it physically disappears from the mundane environment. If that process is achieved then the proof of achievement would lie in the fact that its weight also disappears.
What then is it that can outweigh itself, but can also underweigh itself and become nothing? What then is it that can be gold, but can be fired and transposed to dust? It is the Phoenix: the red-gold that will fire to ashes, but will then be restored to enlightenment (once again we see how many various levels of meaning one secret symbol can have). It is the golden calf that Moses burned to a powder. It is the highward firestone of the shem-an-na, and the Sumerian records indicate that this was not made of stone at all, but of shining metal.
So, what precisely is the ‘highward’ state which converts gold into a sweet-tasting impalpable white powder? It is that which modern science now calls the ‘high-spin’ state. A normal atom has around it a screening potential - a positive screening produced by the nucleus, like a person’s aura (the term and symbol for gold being au from ‘auric’). The majority of electrons going round the nucleus are within this screening potential, except for the very outer electrons. This is all a part of that which we termed earlier, morphogenetics, only it applies to every level of existence, not just the biological entity. The nucleus goes to the high-spin state when the positive screening potential expands to bring all of the electrons under the control of the nucleus—just as the Soul within us expands to broaden our aura and lift itself into a ‘highspin’ state of existence in the various other dimensions. The mystical Sufis use dancing, a form of ‘high spin’ twirling, to literally throw their Souls out of their bodies and into a transcendent state of being.



146
The increased energy of the kundalini ‘sparked’ by this white-powdered gold, has with it an increased sexual energy as well. It is with this shem-an-na that humans are able to be lifted into a dimension in which they can copulate with the extra-dimensional ‘gods’ or aliens. A temple virgin or priestess was ‘purified’ through cleansing and through a lifetime of preparation, given the shewbread to lift her state of consciousness to be at the higher level of existence to enter into the ‘twilight zone’ of the GIGUNU—“the Chamber of Nighttime Pleasures,” there to be used by the gods for their pleasure in the ceremony known as the ‘hierogamous’ –celestial marriage to the ‘heros’ or gods.
In a number of religions and secret societies, the part of the god has been usurped by the ‘elders’ of the church or society, and has led to many occurrences of ritual child abuse throughout the world.
This hierogamous with many virgins was the origin of such institutions as polygamy in the Mormon Church. Today, the Mormon Church does not allow its members to practice polygamy, and those who do so are excommunicated. But since church leaders never really repudiated the doctrine itself, they teach
that it will be lived in heaven, and still retain the revelation on polygamy in the Doctrine and Covenants. The term ‘celestial marriage’ is still used as well.
In Genesis 4, Eve says “I have gotten a man from the Lord”, “I have got me a man with the Lord,” “And I have acquired a man from the Lord.” In defining the Lord in this instance the Midrash uses the personal name Samael (Samael is an important figure in Talmudic and post-Talmudic lore, a figure who is accuser, seducer, and destroyer. Legends mentioning Satan refer equally to him, such that Samael is often taken to be the true or angelic name of the Devil). She was in an altered state of awareness when she conceived through Enki, the child known as Cain, a product and almost the symbol of this mystical substance from then on.
In the Midrash and Phoenician traditions, the Mark of Cain is defined as being a cross within a circle, an old Atlantean temple symbol describing the pathways in and out through the various concentric circles of the land. It can also symbolize the idea of a short-cut to the center of the labyrinth which is the Creator by cutting across all these lines, in this case buy using the white-gold powder to produce an enhancement of the Light inside us.
This symbol was also, in principle, a graphic representation of kingship representing control of the temple form and its inhabitants. In the Celtic tradition, the graphic symbol was indicative of the five divisions comprising four sub-kingdoms with the main palace in the center as described in Inca/Mayan ruins of South America. The old city of Jerusalem is also laid out with four quarters of Jerusalem--inside the Holy City, and within those walls are the temples of all three major religions of the area.
Allegorically, the taking of the shewbread (the Mark of Cain in one sense) can also represent the symbolic killing of Abel by Cain—the overcoming of the true and natural Light by the Darkness, to rob it of its energy, to control the Light of Creation—by Lucifer.
Electrons normally travel around the nucleus in pairs - a forward-spin electron and a reverse-spin electron - but when these come under the influence of a high-spin nucleus all the forward-spin electrons become correlated with the reverse-spin electrons. When perfectly correlated, the electrons turn to pure white light and it is quite impossible for the individual atoms in the high-spin substance to link together. Hence, they cannot reform as metal and the whole remains simply an impalpable, monatomic white powder.

Can you now in your own heads see and explain the relationship of the microcosm to the macrocosm and what is taking place on all levels with the presence of Lucifer? The very sub-atomic level of existence shows exactly what is going on at all levels of existence.
The two directional flow of the energies of existence, the downward and the upward thrust, are all being pulled downward “under the influence of a high-spin nucleus” called the Father of Manifestation—that Lucifer gene within us. The energy of the FATHER within each of us which is our connection to all the other energies of the FATHER, and to the FATHER HIMSELF, is released, ”turned to pure white light and it is quite impossible for the individual atoms in the high-spin substance to link together” to reunite in the Ocean of Love and Mercy which is Soul—“Hence, they cannot reform as metal and the whole remains simply an impalpable, monatomic white powder (individual).” Divide and conquer!
The struggle in this world right now is people giving up there Light to feed the Darkness, and no one even knowing. Lucifer doesn’t have to steal our Light; we give it up to him freely.
A recently conducted experiment in the USA made apparent the effect of the mystical white light in open-air conditions, without the controls of vacuums and inert gasses necessary for contained results. In this test the blaze was equivalent to many tens of thousands of flash-bulbs. It was, in effect, an explosion, but there was absolutely no blast (just a flash), and an unsupported pencil, which had been stood on end within the explosion, was left standing upright and unharmed afterwards. This is wholly reminiscent of the story of Moses and the burning bush as related in Exodus: ‘And he looked, and, behold, the bush burned without fire, and the bush was not consumed’. This was what cause Sodom and Gomorrah to blow up, this center of enlightenment was also a center for the production of white powder gold, and as we hear of druglabs exploding all the time, so too did this area of the Middle East explode with the flash of Light, exploding all the nuclear potential that had been stored in that area.
The truly unusual thing about this white powder is that, through various applied procedures, its weight will rise and fall to hundreds of percent above its optimum weight, down to less than absolutely nothing. Moreover, its optimum weight is actually 56% of the metal weight from which it was transmuted. So, where does the other 44% go? It becomes nothing but pure white light and translates to another dimension beyond the physical plane (stolen).
Another feature of the shem-an-na is that even its 56% substance (that is the remaining sample excluding the 44% light content) can be made to disappear completely from sight, moving itself into another dimension of perceived matter - and when this happens, its weight similarly disappears.
By virtue of such testing, it has been discovered that not only is the powder of the highward fire-stone capable of raising human consciousness, but it is also a monatomic superconductor with no gravitational attraction (The secret of superconductivity is to reduce resistance to less than nothing). One of the great researchers into gravity from the 1960s has been the Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov, and the mathematics for Sakharov’s Theory (based on gravity as a zero-point) were published by Hal Puthoff of the Institute of Advanced Studies in 1989 (Physical Review A - volume 39, no. 5, 1 March). With regard to the monatomic white powder, Puthoff has made the point that because gravity determines space-time, then the powder is capable of bending space-time. It is ‘exotic matter’, he explained, with a gravitational attraction of less than zero.



148
Why did the world go off the gold standard? Perhaps there was something better to do with it. Why do we prize gold so much in the first place? Because the ‘gods’ prized gold. ‘The gold of the gods’ should be called ‘the drugs of the drug lords’ and Lords indeed they were.
Quite apart from gold, it is now known that the platinum-group metals, iridium and rhodium (in the monatomic high-spin state), also have anti-aging properties, while ruthenium and platinum compounds interact with DNA and the cellular body. In the Scientific American Journal of May 1995, the effect of ruthenium was discussed in relation to human DNA, and it was pointed out that when single ruthenium atoms are placed at each end of double-helix DNA, it becomes 10,000 times more conductive. Similarly,
the Platinum Metals Review features regular articles concerning the use of platinum, iridium and ruthenium in the treatment of cancers, which are caused through the abnormal and uncontrolled division of body cells (the giving away of our power and our Light). When a DNA state is altered, as in the case of a cancer, the application of a platinum compound will resonate with the deformed cell, causing the DNA to relax
thoroughly and become corrected. Such treatment involves no amputation surgery; it does not destroy surrounding tissue with radiation, nor kill the immune system as does chemotherapy. It is a straightforward cure which actually corrects altered cells (by infusing them with the Light that has been stolen or given away).
“As the navel is set in the centre of the human body, so is the land of Israel the navel of the world... situated in the centre of the world, and Jerusalem in the centre of the land of Israel, and the sanctuary in the centre of Jerusalem, and the holy place in the centre of the sanctuary, and the ark in the centre of the holy place, and the foundation stone before the holy place, because from it the world was founded.” Midrash Tanchuma, Qedoshim.
Jerusalem and its temple are in the center of the Atlantean temple form of the world. Know now why it is such an important site, and why so many seek to control it? And in front of the ark in the temple was the foundation stone, because of which the world (civilization) was founded: gold, white-powder gold – the chosen drug of the gods.
It is of particular significance that, irrespective of all today’s costly and extensive research, the secrets of the highward fire-stone were known to our ancestors many thousands of years ago, although only just being rediscovered (or uncovered).
“Then shall come forth the Sons of the Morning and give their edict to the children of men, saying: “O men, cease from thy striving against thy brother. Only thus can ye come to the Light. Cease from thy unbelief, O my brother, and follow the path and know ye are right.”
“Then shall men cease from their striving, brother against brother and father against son. Then shall the ancient home of my people rise from its place ‘neath the dark ocean waves (Atlantis reborn). Then shall the Age of Light be unfolded with all men seeking the Light of the goal. Then shall the Brothers of Light rule the people. Banished shall be the darkness of night.



149
What more fearsome warning should we have than this one from the Emerald Tablets of Thoth? Atlantis rises and along with it the control by the Dark Sorcerer Kings and the brotherhoods ‘of Light’ ruling over us.
The Crystal Skull
As Alice Bryant says in her book, The Message of the Crystal Skull:
“Mesoamerica, as no other area of the world, had been dominated by an art motif so stark as the fleshless skull.”
When we think of all the ‘headhunters’ with all their skulls hanging outside their huts, when we think of all the catacombs from one end of the world to the other lined with rows upon rows of skulls, when we think of the usage of the Skull and Crossed-Bones motif in so many different areas from piracy to secret societies, we have to wonder if these are all truly unconnected, or if there is a grander puzzle here that encompasses more than just Mesoamerica.
The crystal skull we speak of here is that which is the original from which all the others were made. This Skull was the third gift of the Annunaki left behind on planet Earth upon their ‘migrating’ back to the heavens. Unfortunately, it was not a welcome gift.
Barbara Clow gives us a little closer detail about the skull and its origins:
“Some crystal skulls were carved on Nibiru by Spica . . . the divine architect of Atlantis, the supreme master of geomancy, who later became Imhotep of Saquarra in Egypt (the so-called ‘pyramid designer’). This skull is the only object my people (the Annunaki) brought to Earth that still remains here. . . . The crystal skull holds the records of Atlantis when Atlantis was a Goddess culture and men and women lived in harmony. . . it will be the focus of a desperate journey that will occur after a great cataclysm . . .“the Search for the Golden Fleece.”
Spica is a first-magnitude star in the constellation of Virgo, the Virgin, known in ancient times as a fertility or harvest symbol. Spica is also the planet from which much of the Atlantean technology came. It is a very ‘male-oriented’ star, and it is the source of the patriarchal attitudes which took root in the final stages of Atlantis’ existence. It is NOT one of the Twenty-Four Civilizations.
The biggest problem with the crystal skull being left behind is that it is still a 4th dimensional object. Again, Clow:
“We Nibiruans brought this galactic diamond to earth in order to discover for the first time how to truly share ourselves with Earthlings . . . Something in our destiny prompted us to offer this gift, that we might learn from the Earth people and they from us, and this created polarity. . .
“This visit to Earth is AD 0. . . I have come with other Nibiruans . . . the message is passed from the computer system on Io. . . the crystal is star matter, it would shatter in the atmosphere, but its vibration can be shifted from the fourth dimension into the third.”
The Kaaba, the central shrine of Islam, is a cube-shaped, one-room stone structure in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It already attracted pilgrimages as the most important sanctuary (haram) in pre-Muslim Arabia, and the traditional belief that it was built by Abraham and Ishmael (to whom the Arabs trace their descent) was confirmed by the Koran.



150
For Muslims, the Kaaba is the "House of God," where the divine touches the mundane. It is washed annually and covered with a dark silk cloth. The Kaaba has been greatly expanded since Muhammad's times, a mosque-court having been built around it; recently a gate of solid gold was added.
The stone inside the Kaaba (the Ka in ancient Egypt was the Ego, the Ab was the Heart—Self-will in Lucifer vs. the Heart [and Soul] of ARTOLA—the archetypal duel in Mankind) is said to be ‘star-material’, but is most likely to be one of the crystal skull duplicates acting as a central crystal for the Temple of Islam.
The difficulty with transferring something as ‘solid’ as the crystal skull from the fourth dimension into the 3rd dimension is the greater density of the vibrations, hence the idea of it ‘shattering’. Secondly, their would be a time warp that would surround the object, since time is a variable which runs on different wavelengths in the 4th dimension as opposed to the 3rd dimension. Some kind of shielding system such as a morphogenetic field would normally have to be used by time-travelers to stop from upsetting the balance of the Universe, which would then have effects on everything within that Universe.
Next we must discuss Lucifer’s specialty, the manifestation of desires or thoughts upon the 3rd dimension, and the same too on the 4th. The power of thought was mentioned in an earlier chapter. What we think creates our reality. When we think of something we would like to have in our lives on the third dimension, we are creating a mold, much like that morphogenetic field which encompasses it would be, an outline of what we want. When we fill that mold with the emotion of wanting that object, experience or whatever, we are then filling that mold, and the object will sooner or later be brought into our lives depending on the strength of our emotion.
This also works in reverse that our mind can create a mold of what we fear, and then the emotion of fear fills it and brings into our lives whatever it is we fear. The rapidity with which this happens depends, of course, on our ability to focus our attention on the creation and manifestation of that object or experience. The energy of creating can and usually is in most of our undisciplined minds, siphoned off by negative thoughts we or others might put into that desire we have for this thing. That is why the Law of Silence is so important when it comes to manifesting things into our lives. The more we talk about what it is we want, the more likely we are to dilute or dissipate the energies of that creation process. Things we want will then not appear. Conversely, talking about our fears tends to release the energies for creating those molds in our lives as well, a very positive thing to do.
Barbara Clow gives this process of manifestation an extra dimension in her work, Eye of the Centaur:
“Look at it in terms of a place for more understanding. First, if you study a duality, seemingly you can see more on the physical plane than if you view the oneness of it. If you make it into a four-sided issue you can see more. If you look at it in twelve ways, you see more. And if you look at it in a 360-degree circle you can see even more. And if you ponder that the eyeball itself is a ball like a crystal ball, that the surface of the eye is convex and brings in the light; and the thought form is accessed on the convex surface within and travels into the brain stem, you can see how a thought form is manifested. so the key to actualizing what you want is to meditate on the action of the eye. And the key is also intuition. Just as the eye sees and transmits, so it is that we know what matters intuitively. And that is also why the Egyptians revere the uraeus, the third eye, and the Eyes of Horus.”
This is the process of creation and manifestation in the Universe. Positive thinkers get what they want, as long as it isn’t all mental—their must be emotion to fill the morphogenetic field. The lust for power fills the mold of those who wish to be in charge and do the work to visualize this happening. Why ARE the secret societies so powerful, because all these secrets are know and shared among the various levels of their membership to different ‘degrees’.



151
On the 4th dimension or astral plane, this manifestation of our thoughts and feelings is instantaneous! The crystal skull is not just a way of seeing the future, as has been handed down to us with the idea of a crystal ball, the Crystal Skull is also a way of manifesting the future or one’s desires instantaneously on this planet. The copies cannot do this, although they have many ‘magical’ powers. Those who have seen what the original can do, obviously tried to reproduce what they had seen, without realizing the dimensional difference between what they had produced and the original. It is only the original that can do the true instantaneous manifestation here on Earth, although those produced by Melchezidek, in all his awesome power, and handed down to Abraham, have very similar abilities.
Psychic, Lorraine Darr, was asked to do a reading about the history of the Mitchell Hedges skull. What she received seems to have come more from the original than the copies, as well as confirming the multidimensional status of the original Crystal Skull:
“At times the Skull was a projected form that appeared and felt physical and was not physical at all. And sometimes the Skull was in its physical form (time warp). The difference lay in what the intentions of the priests and the teachers were. For the Skull could literally resonate tones as it was focused in the minds of the Masters as they functioned with Masters upon the Earth.
“The skull was used as a form of teacher, and as a form of God. Magic, yes, because the forcefield literally filled the area for hundreds of miles when it was in its physical state that it abides in now, and when it was triggered and the receiver of the thoughts sent on laser beams for the rapid growth of the humans at that time to bring into the human consciousness the culture, the understandings, the capabilities, and the wisdoms of many times (much like the emerald tablets can do).
“. . . It was control, yet it was control over the humans for a massive regrowth and reimplanting of wisdoms within the physical stature of what you know to be humans. . . In this way, thousands of years could be accomplished in a short while. . . “
Again, the white-powder of gold, just like the Crystal Skull, works on intent:
“And that is the Judgment. That is the Oneness. Now what does it do in the body? It literally corrects the DNA, by a process the equivalent of a denaturing solution, the DNA relaxes and recombines corrected. So all diseases that originate with a problem with the DNA can be corrected, but your reason for taking it cannot be to correct a disease. Your reason for taking it has to be a philosophical reason. It has to be to enlighten and to raise the nature of mankind. If in doing that, it happens to cure the diseases, so be it.”
The original and many of the duplicates are MADE FROM white-powder gold.
This bringing of the Crystal Skull would coincide with the attempts to help the survivors of the Flood by the Civilizations and by the Annunaki as mentioned in a previous chapter, and to help reimprint them with some knowledge of civilization, otherwise the process would have taken tens of thousands of years of reevolution. Again intent is mentioned strongly as a deciding factor in the effectiveness of the Skull.
The story of King Midas and the golden touch is an archetype of this kind of wish fulfillment and having the wrong kind of motives—and of course it involves, what else? gold. Clow addresses the issue of manifestation and intent in talking about the central crystals on Atlantis and how they were used. She also confirms for us the causes and the reality of the lowering in the dimensional status of Earth from Atlantis until the present time:
“. . . because human desires manifest realities, the main crystal must be kept completely free of human desires. Instead, the people create with intent. . . All creations are a direct result of the clarity and purity of the lives of the people: they do not attempt to create realities with crystals. The central confusion



152
about Atlantis comes from the Nibiruan visitors, who did not understand the inherent clarity of these people. They arrived and assumed that the harmonic creativity of the Atlanteans came from the crystal. Then the Nibiruans placed their own thought-forms in the crystal by means of laser beams, creating an interference pattern (Much as they did with the pyramids). Thus, the cycle turned from creation to chaos, and Atlantis became third dimensional and dense.
“When the Spican teaching was pure, the Spican crystal was the interface between earth and sky, and it circulated knowledge and harmony of all cosmic cycles. The sacred spring circulated feelings from the Earth through the waters to the land, and the people attuned to these pulsations as they soaked in the golden rays of the Sun. As long as the proper intention was maintained, the form functioned correctly, and the people were fourth dimensional, not caught in time.”
This also confirms what Plato had to say about the changes in attitude on Atlantis being a cause of the fall of the civilization into darkness, the difference between desire and intent.
As Alice Bryant explains it, quartz crystal acts not only as a receiver but also as an amplifier. Thought waves are generated energy and they are very similar to radio waves. The brain may decode invisible frequencies to make an image the way a hologram decodes light rays to make a picture.
“Upon them are engraved characters in the ancient Atlantean language: characters which respond to attuned thought waves, releasing the associated mental vibration in the mind of the reader.”
The reason you can tune a radio or a television to a certain place on the dial is because the television or radio station is broadcasting on an exact wavelength. It has a control mechanism, a quartz crystal oscillator, which oscillates at only so many thousand cycles per second and remains that way constantly. Therefore, you can tune in at, say, 1040 on the dial because of a little chip of quartz crystal oscillating at an exact frequency that does not vary.
The ancient Sumerian texts talk about the Annunaki from Nibiru using this ability, and in particular this skull, in words the people could understand:
Enki and Enlil go to the DU.KU, the “purification place” “the creation chamber of the gods,” and brought forth Lahar (wooly cattle) and Anshan (grains). Enki and Enlil could only use ‘the creation chamber of the gods’ after first being ‘purified’ of their desires so that their intent was pure. It’s not all as simple as it sounds, otherwise they could have just ‘wished’ for an Adam and one would have appeared, but that is not exactly the way it works.
Upon ‘leaving’ the 3rd dimensional field of the planet, the Annunaki left the Crystal Skull behind as an oracle in the Temple at Ur. The Mitchell Hedges crystal skull was used in much the same way, hence the holes drilled in the sides of its jaw so that it could be made to look like it spoke to whoever was petitioning it for a reading, This is the same concept in a much lowered form that would work for control by the priesthood—a carbon copy, only the original being a true 4th dimensional golden crystal diamond. Although the original Crystal Skull does not speak as such, the copies translated this ability to foresee the future as ‘speaking’ and hence were made to speak so that they could manipulate the outcome of what was said.
It was in Ur that Abraham’s father Terach, the ‘oracle priest’, knew of and controlled the Skull. He knew of its influence on keeping the land productive by its ability to forecast and draw in 4th dimensional star energies. When the crystal tip was taken from the Great Pyramid, the land suffered and the civilization declined. When Terach and his family were told to leave Ur, by the predictions of the Crystal Skull, it went with them. Upon his father’s death, Abraham took control of the Skull, and allowed it to lead him and his



153
family to where it was most beneficial, much as the story of those peoples being led to South America by “a green stone.”
It is on the ‘advice’ of the Skull then that Abraham took his family into Egypt, and returned as a wealthy person. Still he knew the proper use of the skull, the difference between manifesting desires with intent, and he passed this knowledge along with the Crystal Skull.
The next major transfer came when Joseph inherited the Crystal Skull from Jacob, the idea of Joseph being sold into slavery by his brothers being untrue. What is true, however, is that Joseph became Vizier to Thuthmosis IV, pharaoh of Egypt, and he was able to translate the pharaoh’s dreams and forecast the times of feast and famine, using the powers of the Skull. It was Thuthmosis IV who was directed to remove the sands from around the Sphinx ‘by a dream’.
It was the inscription by Ashburnipal, King of Assyria that summed up what Lucifer is all about so well, knowing where the power of the Skull came from just the way Joseph knew how to use it too –“ . . . the mysterious god who lingers in a secret place where no one can see what his divine being is about.” In this case it truly is the secret places of the Lion as we shall find out before our journey ends.
And Ashurburnipal was not the only one to know more about the sources of all this power and darkness: “That which Elohim will be doing did He reveal to Pharaoh.” (Gen: 41)
And from Joseph, vizier to the Pharaoh Thuthmosis IV, it went to Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhenaton, who we now know as Moses.
When Moses left Egypt, the Crystal Skull went with Him. Lucifer, the III (incarnation), was in possession of the Crystal Skull. The knowledge of Lucifer and the power of the Skull were now combined for the first time in history.
“. . . That the pillared cloud descended . . . And Yahweh spoke unto Moses face to face, As a man would speak unto his friend. Talking face to face but from within a cloud “Show me thy face!” he begged of the Lord. “Thou canst not see my face,
for no Man can see Me and live.”
As Moses was coming down from the Mounthe knew not that the skin of his face radiated when He was speaking to him.”
Yahweh would adopt the Israelites as his people, and “be an Elohim unto them,” if they would make him their god and worship him as the one and only god. The offer is accepted, and the bargain with ‘the devil’ is cemented:
“—If you will listen to me and keep my covenant, thenout of all the nationsa treasured possession to me you shall be, for the whole Earth is mine; You shall be my kingdom of priests And a holy nation.”



154
The commandments and laws and restrictions are brought down from the Mountain by Moses as described—almost exact duplicates of the previous laws of the Egyptian pharaohs of which Moses had been one. With them, however, also came two other tablets—the Tablets of Testimony, which shall become very important as we proceed.
Directions for how to build the Ark of the Covenant are given, very specifically, as well as the portable Mishkan—the “residence” built for Yahweh in the Sinai wilderness. Its most important component was the Ohel Moed (“Tent of Appointment”), in whose holiest part the Ark of the Covenant that contained the Tablets of the Law was kept.
“The Ark is . . . an electrical condenser – built of resinous wood and double-plated inside and out with gold . . . the individual plates when negatively and positively charged can produce several hundred volts sufficient to kill a man . . . the self-protecting Ark. Moreover, the Ark also emerges as an effective transmitter of sound, with its two magnetic cherubim and the Mercy Seat between, where Moses communicated with God. . . “
On the mountain, Moses is ‘given’ a list of the precise materials and the instruments to use when building the portable residence, as well as a Tavnit, a model of the building itself. (Exodus 25:8-9). Moses was able to manifest the model of the Mishkan using the Crystal Skull.
David, a later inheritor of the Crystal Skull, is also able to give a model (Tavnit) of the Temple to his son Solomon, “with all its parts and chambers” . . . “the Tavnit of all that he had by the Spirit”
Zecharia Sitchin describes in some of his works how these models of temples and brick molds fall from the apparent sky into the waiting arms and laps of those who were told by the gods to build their houses and their temples. This is manifestation as it is on the 4th dimension, brought down into 3rd dimensional reality. As we have just learned material objects can disappear into a higher dimension, so to can material objects be ‘lowered’ from a higher dimension as well, though not without some difficulty when it comes to such things as the Skull.
The number fifty (50) was the principal numerical feature in the construction and equipping of the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle, and an important element in the future of the Temple envisioned by Ezekiel in what sounds like a hologram or astral encounter. He calls what he sees an “apparition” (ever wonder why there were so many visions in the Bible and other religious books with so many highly effective drugs being used?). He is then shown the rebuilt temple and its plans.
David is later described as sitting before the Ark like a person would sit before their television set, and he is able to ask his questions and gets answers. But with Moses, everything is different:
“. . . Not so is it with my servant Moses, faithful in all mine house. With him I speak mouth to mouth, In appearances and not in puzzles; The similitude of Yahweh does he behold. . .”
The gods have departed from those who were once walked and talked with them, leaving in their stead this new god who to all but a select few is the Unknown and Unseen God.
And who does Yahweh say he is? He is “omnipotent” and “omnipresent.” He “was not just a great king over all of the Elohim” (Psalms 95:3) because “Before the Elohim upon Olam He sat,” Psalm (61:8). Olam is equivalent to the mental plane, the 10th dimension of existence in a 12 dimensional system, the plane



155
where most earthly religions have their ‘Heaven’ and their ‘God’. And before even that dimension was created –there was Lucifer.
To Jacob, he announces himself as—“I am Yahweh, the Elohim of Abraham thy ancestor, and the Elohim of Isaac.”
As Elaine Pagels identifies him, he is the instigator of a big program of ‘us’ against ‘them,’ or as we have begun to see it, ‘him’ against the rest of the gods. He is arrogant, and fickle to the point of nastiness. He is the god ‘of duality’ and the original Machiavellian who seems to like turning brother against brother, as is evident throughout history, a clue to another of his seven physical incarnations.
It is also here that we see another one of Enjliou’s incarnations in a relationship to Lucifer’s. In this case with Lucifer as Moses, his brother Aaron fulfilled the role of arbiter of Lucifer’s wishes, and as we shall see from other of Enjliou’s lives—he too was being manipulated and used, not totally blindly or against his will, but rather from that inner weakness that caused the flaw in Creation in the first place. Thus, too, it is Enjliou as Aaron, founder of the Aaronic priesthood, who is also able to access the innermost sanctuary of the Ark.
This innermost area of the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, was separated from the forepart by a veil that could not be parted except by Moses and then by his brother Aaron, who was appointed by Yahweh to serve as High Priest, and the three sons of Aaron, who were anointed as priests. It is symbolic of the veil between the worlds that had to be lifted by use of the shemana-an-na to access the presence of the Lord.
Like the cleanest white chemist’s outfit, they were then to enter the sacred place only after performing certain rites and wearing special clothing, ritualized now in Mormon temple ceremonies as white jump suits. Furthermore, when these consecrated priests entered the Holy of Holies they had to burn incense (whose composition was also strictly prescribed by the Lord) so that a cloud would engulf the Ark; for Yahweh told Moses, “it is in the cloud that I shall appear, above the Ark’s cover.” Like a rainbow on water droplets, a hologram appears best on particles. Witches have a similar kind of smoke they make from burning certain formulas in their fires, and it is there in the smoke that the Lord, ‘the Devil’, or Lucifer, appears.
As described later in the Bible, at a gathering of all the elders and tribal chiefs from all over Jerusalem, “the priest brought the Ark of the Covenant with Yahweh into its place, into the Dvir of the temple which is the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the Cherubim . . . (which is where the speaking takes place) And there was nothing in the Ark except two stone tablets which Moses had placed therein in the Wilderness after Yahweh had made a covenant with the Children of Israel after they had left Egypt. And when the priests had stepped out of the Holy of Holies, “a cloud filled the House of Yahweh.
” And Solomon prayed unto Yahweh, “He who dwells in the fog-like cloud,” beseeching the Lord “who dwells in the heavens” to come and listen to his people’s prayers in the new temple.”
Again, to Samuel:
“Yahweh came and stood upright, and called ‘Samuel, Samuel’ from time to time; and each time Samuel answered ‘speak, for thy servant listens.”
The call upon Samuel also occurred as “he was lying in the sanctuary of Yahweh where the Ark of Elohim was.” The ark made of acacia wood and inlaid with gold inside and out, was intended to safe keep the two Tablets of the Law, but its main purpose, as stated in the Book of Exodus, was to serve as the Dvir—literally “a speaker.” The Ark was to be topped by the two Cherubim made of solid gold, with their wings touching. “It is there that I shall keep appointments with you,” Yahweh told Moses, “and I will speak to you from above the cover, from between the two Cherubim which shall be upon the Ark” (Exodus 25:22)



156
Even the Highest spiritual beings in Creation can only use the laws of physical and spiritual creation to either manifest or perform what most of us would consider miracles. Thus Lucifer creates his own show of ‘smoke and mirrors’ to impress and to communicate with his chosen followers.
Electronic oscillators are simply gold-plated quartz crystal wafers that vibrate at a precise frequency. The Ark was gold-lined inside and out. The tablets which Moses originally brought down from Mount Sinai were supposed to have been of crystal; however, these were destroyed when He got mad at the people for worshiping another god. The duplicates were of quartz rock which then activated the Ark when placed inside.
Yahweh was simply the perfect diversion, the perfect cover-up for Lucifer, and then he became the eternal smokescreen— the Wizard of OZ hiding behind the screen—the terms used to describe false magic—‘the world of smoke and mirrors,’ a world the ancient Mayans as described above would easily relate to in this very dark being.
To answer the question, can Lucifer die in the physical, as Ra, as Melchizedek, as Moses and Quetzalcoatl did? The answer is yes, though there burial sites may be difficult if not impossible to find, and few if any ever see them die. It is perhaps best to use an allegory here which comes again from the movie The Matrix. While the participants in the game of life (the Matrix) are working within the illusion of the Matrix (the 3rd dimension), what happens to them in the Matrix is also happening to them in their ‘real’ lives as well in the higher dimensions. The Annunaki found this out too in their rapid aging and the lowering of their energies after the planet fell into the 3rd dimension. Lucifer, too, aged, and then he as Moses and Ra and Melchizedek left the physical in one form or another without truly dying. Quetzalcoatl is the only incarnation that actually died in the physical, as we shall find out later. In one of his later incarnations, Lucifer did not actually die, but instead, ‘transported’ himself into the future as it was, a feat we shall also discuss when we come to it. After his physical self dies, he returns to his Universal self, and the position he has created for himself there.
The ‘smoke and mirrors’ were an important part of Lucifer’s show, having learned well from mankind’s willingness to sink to his knees and worship the earlier space-gods on the planet. Therefore, the Ark was not the only communications device with the Lord that took special clothing. The most famous piece of clothing for communicating with the divine was the Urim and Thummim.
When it came to the priesthood and the clothing they were to wear, there vestments were elaborately prescribed to the smallest detail, including ‘the Breastplate of Judgement’ containing twelve precious stones inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The Breastplate was also to hold in place-precisely against the priest’s heart—the Urim and Thummim. Once again, these are crystals used for communication, or sometimes more appropriately, the original form of lie detector test.
In Exodus: 28, Moses on the Mount of Sinai receives the instructions for the Tabernacle and is told that Aaron and his sons are to minister in the priest’s office. Their garments and accoutrements as required are listed:
” . . . though shalt put in the breastplate of judgement one Urim and Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart when he goeth in before the Lord and Aaron shall bear the judgement of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually.”
In Lev. 8:9, Moses consecrates Aaron and his son, saying: “This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done.” They are then washed and robed, and “He put the breastplate upon him; also he put in the breastplate the Urim and Thummim.”



157
The vestments of the clergy and the raiment of monarchs are also closely related to these prescribed garments for speaking with the Lord.
In Deut. 33:8, Moses, blessing Israel before his death: “And of Levi he said let thy Urim and Thummim be with the holy one.”
In 1 Sam. 5 and 6, “And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid and he greatly trembled. And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor buy Urim nor by prophets.”
In Ezra 2:63, a cultic problem is postponed until a priest can consult the Urim and Thummim. “And Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with the Urim and Thummim.” Neh. 7:65 is identical to this also.
In Num.27, Moses asks God to appoint his successor, and the Lord elects Joshua. Verse 21 then states: “He shall stand before Eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgement of Urim and Thummim before the Lord.”
In the testimony of the prophet Joseph Smith that opens the Book of Mormon, Joseph describes his being led to discover the plates and the breastplate that is with them which he will need to translate the plates:
“On the evening of the . . . twenty-first of September (1823) . . . I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God . . .
“. . . Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim—deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted Seers in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book . . .
“Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.”
And the communication goes both ways. The most sacred part of the church, the altar, was usually inlaid with seven precious stones (the mystical number) as an alternate listening device. This is repeated in church altars in many parts of the world.
And thus it was that the Crystal Skull was not only a speaking device but also a listening device as well. From Moses the Skull was passed down the line of succession eventually to David, and thence to Solomon, who put it in the temple once it had been completed. This then became the central crystal for the temple. Clow:
“. . . I flash into the center of the Temple of Solomon to stand in front of the central throne of the judge. There, I see a great being who holds a gigantic crystal ball (skull) . . . I realize that this crystal—the key to the psychic realms—was made by ourselves, the Nibiruans. It is a highly polished asteroid that we picked out of the Sirius star system long ago . . .
“I am Isaiah, and I am in the Temple of Solomon. I see an eye . . . It is always staring at me. It is a watching device that has been set up to observe me. It hangs in an astrolabe in the center of the main



158
altar. It sees what I am manifesting and feeling, and it transmits that information . . . The brotherhood to which I belong—the Order of Melchizedek—was established . . . to create religious and political hierarchies. These hierarchies then created controversies that were intended to evoke constant fear in people, thus making them visible to the all-seeing eye . . .
“. . . That skull was activated and the portal reopened.”
The crystal skull is an all-seeing eye as such, just as here described was used in the Temple of Solomon. A symbolic image of this same all-seeing eye is pictured on the United States one dollar bill.
Being fourth dimensional, the Skull allows those who use it to see everywhere on the 3rd dimension, as is described earlier in discussing astral eyes. The skull is also a portal between the dimensions because of the time warp which it creates here on the 3rd dimension around it as Kryon suggests in an early chapter when discussing small particle physics. Many UFOs bring this kind of time warp with them when they enter our dimension to save from upsetting the balance of this dimension. Large explosion in the sky are heard called ‘sky-quakes’ if the UFOs disappear back into another dimension within the confines of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Clow describes the effects of time warps in one of her incarnations as an Atlantean:
“. . . the wrist devices are constructed of lapis lazuli and coral. . . The Egyptians are later in time because this is 6700 BC over the Gobi Desert. But I can go backward and forward in time. . . The shields are time protectors also. . . It is a great time of quickening in the awareness of earth. . . Now, most of what is happening down around the pyramid is astral, and I can relate to it. I don’t know what is inside the pyramid at this time, but there is a piazza all around it made of polished white stone. The step-pyramid is four-sided. I am with my people at the top, and we are astral, so that the priests below can make contact
with us. If we manifested on the physical plane, we would destroy all beings below, so they know us in their hearts and through their third eyes. And they have been thoroughly trained in occult verification. We taught them in their dreams to trust their hearts and uraeus as much as their eyes and ears. We would destroy them on the physical plane if we manifested because we would be tampering with the earth laws of time.”
The skull remained in the Solomon’s Temple until the exile into Babylonia, where it was kept safe and passed from ‘hand to hand’ down through the line of prophets who used it to give them their heightened abilities. As the temple was rebuilt under the aegis of Cyris, the Skull came back to the temple. It was transferred into the new temple built by Herod upon the exact site of the original.
There we shall leave it for now. Its further history discussed as we come across its influence throughout history, and return to fill out the history of the Hebrew line--
It was under Joshua that the Hebrews conquered Palestine, but during the reign of King David (circa 1000-961 BC) they truly became a regional power. David defeated the people known as the Philistines, took Jerusalem, and established his capital on the Temple Mount.
His son, Solomon, whose name coincidentally translates in the tradition of Akhenaton and others into ‘One God’ –‘solo-mon’, ruled from about 961 to 922 BC. He was famed for his wisdom, a product derived, in part, from the possession of the Skull.
Solomon was actually given ‘the wisdom’, not simply ‘wisdom’, meaning he was given the keys to the ancient Mysteries—the ancient Wisdom of Lamech, and much of it was used in how to build the first



159
Temple. Some of it was in the words that called forth the power of God (Lucifer), as do many magic spells and incantations based on secret words and chants.
The materials for the Temple’s construction were detailed to Solomon by another one of those interdimensional occurrences.
Solomon relied heavily on the artisans of the Phoenician King of Tyre for the required experts to build the temple, the Phoenicians being from the mixed stock of Atlantean colonies. Obviously, however, they still possessed enough of the Atlantean temple technology to perform the required mystical construction. As Sitchin says it, “there was a need for the artisans to be divinely inspired (with shem-an-na) or trained so as to understand these instructions. . . And the Temple in Jerusalem was literally called a “house” for the Lord. It is evident that it was more of a “sacred place for divine communication, a place where Man and God could hear each other, as are all temples built in the correct Atlantean form.
“. . . It was then that Yahweh appeared unto Solomon for a second time . . . I . . . have sanctified this House that thou hast built, to place my Shem (name, memory) in it forever, so that my eyes and my heart shall be there in perpetuity.”
Once again we have the legend versus the reality when it comes to Solomon. Whereas the legend speaks of Solomon the Wise, Solomon was also an inheritor of many of the other aspects of Moses and Abraham and those who had gone before him. It was commonly believed by ancient Jews and Christians alike that King Solomon’s proverbial wisdom extended to the control of demons. In this capacity he was invoked by orthodox writers, Gnostics (such as the example we are about to give), and by early magicians as well. Solomon and his temple are foundation symbols of Freemasonry, and as we shall see, the Freemasons carry on this tradition well.
In the Gnostic text known as ‘The Revelation of Adam’, Adam is relating his prophecies of the future to his son, Seth. In his prophecy of Jesus’ birth to a virgin, he describes Solomon thus:
[The fourth] kingdom [says of him], “He came into existence [from a] virgin [. . . search] for her himself, along with Phersalo and Sauel and his armies that they had sent. Solomon, too, sent his army of demons to search for the female virgin. And they found not the female for whom they sought, but Rather the female virgin who had been given to them: It was she whom they brought. Solomon took her, and the female virgin became pregnant And bore the child in that place. She nourished him within a boundary of the desert. When he had been nourished, he received glory and power
From the seed from which he had been engendered. And it was thus that he arrived at the water.”
The Holy of Holies in Solomon’s Temple was deemed to represent the womb of Ashtoreth (Ishtar). She was openly worshipped by the Israelites until the 6th century BC as the celestial wife of El. Their daughter was Anath, Queen of the Heavens, and their son, the King of Heavens, He. As time progressed,



160
the separate characters of El and He were merged to become Jehovah. Asherath and Anath were conjoined to become Jehovah’s female consort, Shekinah or Matronit.
The Hebrews are described as “a tenacious sect who fought against all odds to contrive the dominant religion of Israel,” a thought reminiscent of the Nine’s description of the Hoovids and their ‘tenacity’. While other religions contrived to have both a male and female aspect to god since proper creation could only come from the two, Jehovah was, however, made into one male being, a composite of all the elements, a definite sign of Lucifer’s arrogance and his failure to entirely control the Mother.
Ley Lines and the Control of the Planet
Why the importance of Jerusalem as a site for the temple? How does any sacred site differ from any other spot around it? As mentioned earlier, the planet has an electro-magnetic grid system of Ley lines around it just as does the human body. The Earth has various points or energy centers that correspond very much to the chakra system of the body –the microcosm to the macrocosm and vice versa. To affect the human body, simply close down one of these chakras or impair its operations. To help it heal, simply cleanse it or open it, and let the energies flow. To control the planet and its relationship to the entire galaxy and indeed to the entirety of Creation, simply control these earth chakras in much the same way. If not control, then at least pollute them so the system does not work so well.
Temples and government offices are the central control points built on top of these sacred sites and vortexes of energy to control that flow of energy to and from the planet, and to control all those on the planet at whatever level they may exist upon.
These Ley lines are a giant system of fibre-optic energy interconnected all around the actual planet surface. As they have been used by the Dark forces, they carry the electromagnetic energy of people and places along their length and eventually to some hub or center where it can be accumulated and beamed off to support that higher Being that does not have Light or energy of his own. Along each line are the ancient sites of worship, many of which have now been replaced by churches of one religion or another, of one denomination or another—all worshipping the same god.
According to John Michell in his View Over Atlantis, it is a very common story to hear in England of how ‘the Devil’ did not allow a certain church to be built in a certain location, but actually guided the builders to where instead it should be built. This was usually on some hilltop or mound located directly on one of these Ley lines, lining up with others from one town to the next! Thus we have the devil placing his churches where he wants them built to best control this field of energy. Most of these Ley lines and sacred sites have particular days at which their energy is greatest—again, the midsummer solstice seems to be the most particular day.
Most of the sacred sites and standing stones known as dolmens, any church that manifested some degree of power, and all the Masonic lodges, seem to be aligned with one star system or another, or with the appearance of a special star system at certain places along the horizon on a certain day of the year. It is a matter of he who controls the grid controls the energies of the planet, for the grid goes to make up the Matrix, the energy field which is morphogenetically holding things in place.
Just as we have been working on the structure of the churches being a way of multiplying and relaying this energy, so to do they act as collection points for all the energies from the lesser points with which they are connected. This too is probably how the ancient gods are able to tap into us anywhere and at anytime since we all funnel our energies and those of the planet into these common grid lines to have it sent off somewhere further on down the road to these relay stations.



161
More than likely then, the monoliths found in space are relayers of this energy as we have always correctly suspected. Even the words involved with this whole control of the Ley system reflect these simple ideas. In his work, John Michell relates how many of these site names in England are still connected to Thoth and to Baal, e.g., the Toot or Tot hills, Ball Hill and even Baalbeg. The idea of ‘laying’ comes from ‘Ley’ also meaning ‘law’, and the expression is ‘to lay down the law.’ Most of the town names in England also reflect their part in this whole greater system as well.
“. . . certain planetary alignment systems create energy fields on this planet. Then if these energy fields are accessed at a sacred site (Ley line intersection), or portal, the sacred information of that site will become available.”
“. . . in August, 1987, after thirty-six hundred years of dormancy, the Earth’s power points were reactivated. . .” (according to Kryon, it was only some of the earth’s power points)
A dolmen usually comprised two upright stones with a horizontal capstone across the top, as at Stonehenge. From prehistoric times dolmens were used as gigantic resonators (much like sound boxes used to amplify acoustic musical instruments) to boost the properties of the Earth’s telluric (terrestrial or planetary) current. That’s what churches and temples and even government offices built on these sites do as well, they harness the emotional and electro-magnetic life energy of their congregation or constituents to feed it into the central system.
The portal or Earth chakra in Jerusalem is indeed the one that Lucifer will make his triumphant return through. It is his Machiavellian energy and the power temples located in that city which cause not only the disruption and violence in the area, but also bring everyone associated with it one step closer to serving him. The forces of Light, however, will be coming through the power portal in Roswell, New Mexico, if it can be kept free of pollution and absolute control by the Dark side.
But energies change and they shift. What is right for one age is not necessarily right for another. Thus Lucifer has a desire and a plan built into the agenda of the New World Order to create ‘a New Jerusalem’, just as it was a part of his plan to make the old city of Jerusalem his power point for the old world that once existed. This New Jerusalem shall be under the control of one god, himself, and it shall be a “Light unto all nations.”
It was after the death of Solomon, in about 880 BC, that the kingdom he built split apart and a new city, Shomron, was made capital in the north. Shalmaneser V overran the Israelite kingdom and dispersed its people throughout the Assyrian Empire in 772 BC; the whereabouts of those Ten Lost Tribes of Israel still remains a lingering enigma in some circles today.
It was at this time that prophets such as Isaiah and Ezekiel lived, and foresaw much of what was to happen with the aid of the Crystal Skull as it worked its way from one set of hands and into another in succession down through the ages.
There was a period of about 300 years from circa 750 BC—430 BC in which the lands in that region were in constant turmoil, and that the Hebrews were in captivity in Babylonia, now under the control of the Assyrians. It is here, indeed, that the Old Testament was first written down and that Jehovah became the national god of the Jews, cementing Yahweh/Lucifer’s dream of being the One God for all, beginning with the Hebrews.
Yahweh even sent Nebuchadnezzar against Israel when he felt they had done wrong, and this resulted in the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BC. They were difficult lessons for Israel, but as the ‘chosen people’



162
they would learn to obey and follow the commands of their god, Yahweh, or they would suffer. That didn’t leave them much option, although that spoken-of element of ‘bargaining with the Lord’ was still always there.
539 BC saw the effective end of Mesopotamian civilization as Babylon fell, conquered by Cyrus of Persia, who allowed Jewish exiles to return to Judea and to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. This was completed in 516 BC. Cyrus, the Bible states, did these things because he was “charged to do so” by “Yahweh, the God of Heaven,” who called Cyrus “my chosen shepherd.”
The temple followed the original layout and orientation of Solomon’s original, and it is said that
Esarhaddon “carried the foundation stone on his head and laid it in the precise olden spot,” which would have been the shewbread placed before the Ark. “With a mold made of ivory he fashioned the first brick.”
That it was in the same spot became clearer five centuries later when King Herod decided to replace the poor replica with a new, splendid edifice that would not just match, but even surpass in grandeur, the First Temple. Built on an enlarged great platform (still known as the Temple Mount) with massive walls (of which the Western Wall, still largely intact, is revered by Jews as the extant remnant of the Holy Temple), it was surrounded by courtyards and various auxiliary buildings. But the House of the Lord proper still retained the tripartite layout and orientation of the First Temple. The Holy of Holies, moreover, remained identical in size to that of the First Temple—and was located precisely over its same spot; except that the enclosure was no longer called Dvir, for the Ark of the Covenant disappeared when the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple and carried off all the artifacts within.
So the Jews gradually returned to the rebuilt city and temple, and with them the power of Lucifer also shifted back to Jerusalem. The Old Testament ends in the 4th century BC, but it ends with ‘an oracle of the word of the Lord,’ and again there are only words of vengeance, hints at Armageddon, and that emotion most loved by the opposition, ‘fear.’
“But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings . . . . lest I come and smite the land with a curse.” (Malachi 4:2-6)
And what a curse he is. It is Ramtha who, in describing Lucifer, says, “. . . I did a wonderful thing for your plane when I delivered this message of the great God of Wrath.”
Armageddon
Though it is not expounded upon until the end of the New Testament, we feel it good to take a preliminary look at the concept of Armageddon here since it ties in with the land of Israel and its history.
The Nine say that Megiddo, the location of the supposed Armageddon, was founded prior to the Flood, and as a portal to other dimensions, has been an important place in Earth’s past history:
“It is an energy core that serves at times as a pipeline for different civilizations to come through on a beam of energy, an opening between the dimensions. But Megiddo is the area where this process of setting up these energy cores started, and all the civilizations used it at one time or another. On Planet Earth it was the place for what you call summit meetings.”
The Nine say it is a place that has already seen a battle between a colony of star seeds which “was of the essence of truth, and those in the spheres (on an astral level) that opposed truth.” This, they say, left the vibration of battle in the area.



163
There will be an Armageddon of sorts, but it has nothing to do with Megiddo. We shall cover that section in our own revelations in the Epilogue to our journey, but it is not something to fear. There will be only one conclusion to this battle, and there shall be only one eventual winner, the True Light of the FATHER.
With all the things we have said and uncovered in these chapters about the Jewish people and their gods, we felt it necessary to reiterate that there are no chosen people in the FATHER’s eyes, for we are all chosen people in that regard. But with respect to the Hoovids, the Hebrews and what they have been through, we think that what the Nine have to say sums up the situation as to why they are so very important to the bigger scheme of things, as well as what they need to do about it:
“. . . the Holocaust was an attempt to make the world aware of those “that would attempt to rule and control humanity . . . to make planet Earth aware that there are negative forces that could attempt to destroy all and to feed on the power of others . . . Do you realize that within the nation of Israel is a representative of each of the nations and races upon the planet Earth? If you reach the nation of Israel, the energy would generate then to all the planet Earth . . . It is not that they are specially chosen, for what they have chosen is similar to service. They are paying for service. Being a chosen people is not necessarily like being an elite, for being chosen brings great difficulties.”
“The East is not in true balance, the West is not in true balance. Israel is a blend of both (and realistically sits right in the middle of the two) . . . Hoovids must learn to cultivate detachment from their emotions so that those of the opposition cannot use them. For the opposition are parasites of mind that would like to control, disrupt, destroy. They have done that to the nation of Israel. The people of Israel are controlled by their emotions. Their emotions are controlled by those that oppose for they live on that energy. This nation of intellectual genius has given that genius away.”
Chapter 18 THE CHRISTIAN BRANCH: JESUS
To understand Jesus and the religion which came from his existence upon the planet, it is first necessary to understand the times into which he was born, both in Israel and in the Rome that came to rule the entire region, as well as to become the center for the religion that bears his name.
Although Greece also played a formative role in the civilizations of the region, it is not central to our story other than what is mentioned here, that Greek became the language of choice for many of the earliest Christian texts.
In Israel
By the middle of the 4th century, Judea had become a country organized in accordance with formalized doctrines of belief and dominated by a powerful priesthood. The Torah, the books of the Law, governed every aspect of Jewish life, and the scribes and teachers of the Law gave the Scriptures final form. Judea prospered. Thus, adjusting to adverse circumstances, the Jews had, in about 150 years, transformed themselves from a political entity to a people almost entirely motivated by religion.
In the late 4th century BC, the dominant power in the ancient world became Macedonia, under Alexander the Great. After the Macedonian subjugation of Persia in 331BC, Judea became a province of



164
Alexander’s empire. According to tradition, Alexander showed a special consideration to the Jewsthousands of Jews migrated to Egypt after the founding of Alexandria. With the growth of commercial opportunities under the united empire, Jews migrated to colonies throughout the known world: to the shores of the Black Sea, to the Greek Islands, and to the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. These migrations assumed such large proportions that they became known collectively as the Diaspora (Greek for “dispersion”). Far removed from the center of Jewish life in Judea, the emigrants had to learn and use the Greek language, rather than Hebrew, and adopt Greek customs and ideas. The Pentateuch was translated into Greek during the 3rd century BC, and the Greek version, the Septuagint, which later included the other parts of the Hebrew Bible, became standard among the Jews of the Diaspora. The Greek way of life and Greek culture, known as Hellenism, became influential among Jews of the Diaspora.
After the death of Alexander in 323BC, the Greeks became a political as well as a cultural danger to the Jews. Alexander’s empire was divided among his generals, and Judea was first invaded by Ptolemy I, king of Egypt. Jewish territory, as the trade route to Arabia, was strategically important, and it became the subject of intense conflict between the Ptolemies of Egypt and the Seleucidae of Syria. In 198BC, in the Battle of Panion, King Antiochus III of Syria overwhelmed Egypt and added Judea to his domains. The Seleucid rulers began a campaign to replace Judaism with Hellenism. The campaign reached its height under King Antiochus IV, who in 168BC proclaimed the Jewish religion illegal and replaced the altar to Yahweh in the temple with an altar to Zeus.
An inevitable Jewish rebellion began the same year under the Jewish priest Mattathias and his sons, called the Maccabees. After a bitter military struggle, the Jewish forces defeated Syria. The Hasmonaean dynasty, or Maccabees, became the leaders and, finally, the kings of an independent Jewish state.
Under the Hasmonaeans, the Jews concentrated their efforts to keep their religion pure and free of foreign influence. The two major political parties that came into being, the Sadducees and Pharisees, differed as much in religious doctrine as they did in political theory. Other religious factions of the period included the Essenes, Jewish religious brotherhoods that maintained a monastic way of life in communal settlements. The Hasmonaeans established the Sanhedrin, a council of state composed of 71 Jewish leaders and sages that was the supreme authority for civil and religious legal decisions. The kingdom was expanded and, under John Hyrcanus, came to include Samaria and Edom, known as Idumaea, where the inhabitants were compelled to accept Judaism.
Like its predecessors, the Hasmonaean Jewish kingdom faced widespread factional conflict. During the last century BC, a civil conflict erupted between the brothers Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, rival heirs to the throne of Judea. Antipater, an Idumaean who was seemingly a supporter of Hyrcanus, intrigued with the Roman General Pompey the Great to resolve the conflict in his own favor, in return for making Judea a client state of the Roman Empire. The Roman Army entered Jerusalem in 62BC, and in 47BC the kingdom of Judea became directly subject to Rome, with Antipater as procurator. His son Herod the Great became king in 37BC.
The last century of the ancient Jewish state was marked by religious and political upheaval. At the beginning of the Christian era the Jewish population in the ancient world numbered some 8 million, living, outside Judea, mainly in Alexandria, Cyrenaica (northern Africa), Babylon, Antioch, Ephesus, and Rome. This dispersion created, in addition to the force of Hellenism, several movements that struck at Judaism. One was directed against all Jews and was based on business competition, religious difference, and the political privileges granted to many Jews who rose to high office. A second movement came from within Judaism
itself, as Christianity. The hellenized Jews who came to believe in Jesus (Hebrew Yeshua, or Joshua) as the promised Messiah far outnumbered the Judeans who accepted Jesus.



165
In Rome
The accounts of the regal period have come down overlaid with such a mass of myth and legend that few can be verified; Roman historians of later times, lacking authentic records, often relied on fabrications of a patriotic nature. Following this period, when a republic was established, Rome became a world power and emerged as an empire with extensive boundaries.
Rome was said to have been founded by Latin colonists from Alba Longa, a nearby city in ancient Latium. The legendary date of the founding was 753 BC; it was ascribed to Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of Rhea Silvia, a vestal virgin and the daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa. The three tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, that appear in the legend of Romulus as the parts of the new commonwealth suggest that Rome arose from the amalgamation of three stocks, thought to be Latin, Sabine, and Etruscan.
There were seven kings of the regal period, ranging from Romulus in 753 to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, from 534 to 510 BC, the seventh and last king, whose tyrannical rule was overthrown when his son ravished Lucretia, the wife of a kinsman. Tarquinius was banished, and attempts by Etruscan or Latin cities to reinstate him on the throne at Rome were to no avail.
The existence of certain social and political conditions may be accepted, such as the division of the inhabitants, exclusive of slaves, from the beginning into two orders: the patricians, who alone possessed political rights and constituted the populus, or people; and their dependents, known as clients or the plebes, who had originally no political existence. The rex, or king, chosen by the Senate, or Council of Elders, from the ranks of the patricians, held office for life, called out the populus for war, and led the army in person; he was preceded by officers, known as lictors, who bore the fasces, the symbols of power and punishment, and was the supreme judge in all civil and criminal suits. The Senate gave its advice only when the king chose to consult it, but the elders possessed great moral authority, inasmuch as their tenure was for life. Originally only patricians could bear arms in defense of the state. At some stage in the regal period an important military reform occurred, usually designated as the Servian reform of the constitution, because it was ascribed to Servius Tullius. As the plebes could by this time acquire property and wealth, it was decided that all property holders, both patrician and plebeian, must serve in the army, and each took a rank in accordance with his wealth. This arrangement, although initially military, paved the way for the great political struggle between the patricians and the plebes in the early centuries of the Republic. On the overthrow of Tarquinius Superbus a republic was established.
In place of the king, two chief executives were chosen annually by the whole body of citizens. These were known as praetors, or leaders, but later received the title of consuls. The participation of a colleague in the exercise of supreme power and the limitation of the tenure to one year prevented the chief magistrate from becoming autocratic. The character of the Senate was altered by the enrollment of plebeian members, known as conscripti, and hence the official designation of the senators thereafter was conscript fathers. As yet, only patricians were eligible for the magistracies, and the discontent of the plebes led to a violent struggle between the two orders and the gradual removal of the social and political disabilities under which the plebes had labored.
In 494 BC a secession of plebeian soldiers led to the institution of the tribuni plebis, who were elected annually as protectors of the plebes; they had the power to veto the acts of patrician magistrates, and thus served as the leaders of the plebes in the struggles with the patricians. The appointment of the decemvirate, a commission of ten men, in 451 BC resulted in the drawing up of a famous code of laws. In 445 BC, under the Canuleian law, marriages between patricians and members of the plebes were declared legally valid. By the Licinian-Sextian laws, passed in 367 BC, it was provided that one of the two consuls should thenceforth



166
be plebeian. The other magistracies were gradually opened to the plebes: in 356 BC the dictatorship, an extraordinary magistracy, the incumbent of which was appointed in times of great danger; in 350 BC, the censorship; in 337 BC, the praetorship; and in 300 BC, the pontifical and augural colleges.
The external history of Rome during this period was chiefly military. Rome had acquired the leadership of Latium before the close of the regal period. Assisted by their allies, the Romans fought wars against the Etruscans, the Volscians, and the Aequians. The military policy of Rome became more aggressive in the 60 years between 449 and 390 BC. The defeat of the Romans at Allia and the capture and burning of Rome by the Gauls under the leadership of the chieftain Brennus in 390 BC were great disasters, but their effect was temporary.
Victories over the Volscians, the Latins, and the Hernicans gave the Romans control of central Italy and brought them into conflict with the Samnites of southern Italy, who were defeated in a series of three wars, extending from 343 to 290 BC. During the next ten years the Romans completed their subjugation of southern Italy and thus gained control of the entire peninsula as far north as the Arno and Rubicon rivers.
In 264 BC, 11 years after the victory over Pyrrhus, Rome engaged with Carthage in a struggle for the control of the Mediterranean Sea. Carthage at this time was the foremost maritime power in the world, ruling as absolutely in the central and western Mediterranean as did Rome on the Italian Peninsula.
The First Punic War was waged mainly for the possession of Sicily and was marked by the emergence of Rome as a great naval power. After several naval disasters, the Romans won a great naval victory in 242 BC off the Aegates Islands, west of Sicily. The war ended in the following year with the cession to the Romans of the Carthaginian part of Sicily, which was made into a Roman province; this was Rome’s first foreign possession. Sardinia and Corsica were taken from Carthage and annexed as provinces soon after.
Finding Rome an equal match at sea, Carthage prepared for a resumption of hostilities by acquiring a foothold in Spain. Under the leadership of the great general Hamilcar, who conceived the project of making Spain a military base, Carthage occupied the peninsula as far as the Tajo (Tagus) River; Hamilcar’s son-inlaw Hasdrubal continued the work of subjugation until his death in 221 BC; and finally Hamilcar’s son Hannibal extended the conquests of Carthage up to the Iberus (now Ebro) River. The Second Punic War began in 218 BC. Hannibal crossed the Alps with an enormous force, descending on Italy from the north, and defeated the Romans in a series of battles; he then continued to ravage most of southern Italy for years. He was recalled to Africa to face Scipio Africanus, who had invaded Carthage. Scipio decisively defeated Hannibal at Zama in 202 BC, and Carthage was compelled to give up its navy, cede Spain and its Mediterranean islands, and pay a huge indemnity. Rome was thus left in complete control of the western Mediterranean.
During 201-196 BC the Celts of the Po Valley were subjugated, and their territory was Latinized, but they themselves were declared incapable of acquiring Roman citizenship. The interior of Corsica and Sardinia was subdued, and Spain, where the wars were troublesome, was held by military occupation, a practice that gave rise to the first Roman standing armies.
Fifty years after becoming the foremost power of the west by defeating the Carthaginians at Zama, Rome had also become the mightiest state in the east, first by conquering Hannibal’s ally Philip V, king of Macedonia; Philip’s ambition to dominate the Aegean Sea drew Rome into the Second Macedonian War (200-197 BC), which ended with his defeat. Next came the liberation of Greece, which, with the alliance that followed, enabled Rome to proceed against Antiochus III, king of Syria, who was defeated by the Romans at Magnesia in 190 BC and obliged to surrender his possessions in Europe and Asia Minor. Macedonia was made a Roman province in 146 BC.



167
Also in 146 BC came the end of the Third Punic War, which had begun three years earlier. Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor captured and destroyed Carthage, thus bringing to an end the Carthaginian Empire, whose territory became the Roman province of Africa. A series of Spanish campaigns ended with the capture of Numantia in 133 BC. In the same year Attalus III of Pergamum died and bequeathed his client kingdom to its protector, Rome; shortly after, this territory was formed into the province of Asia.
Thus in 131 years Rome had developed from a land power controlling only the Italian peninsula to a world empire. From Syria to Spain the Mediterranean was now dominated by Rome, but Roman authority was better established in the west than in the east. During this period the Romans made great cultural advances. Brought into contact with the Greeks, first in southern Italy and Sicily, and later through Roman expansion to the east, they adopted much from the older civilization in art, literature, philosophy, and religion. The various Greek schools of philosophy were formally introduced into Rome in 155 BC.
With the establishment of external supremacy, Rome’s internal troubles began. Several extremely wealthy plebeian families combined with the old patrician families to exclude all but themselves from the higher magistracies and the Senate; they were called Optimates. This aristocratic ruling class had become selfish, arrogant, and addicted to luxury, losing the high standards of morality and integrity of their forebears. The gradual extinction of the peasant farmers, caused by the growth of large estates, a system of slave labor, and the devastation of the country by war, led to the development of a city rabble incapable of elevated political sentiment. Conflicts between the aristocratic party and the popular party were inevitable.
The Italian communities, the allies of Rome, had felt their burdens increase as their privileges waned, and they demanded their share of the conquests they had helped to achieve. The tribune Marcus Livius Drusus attempted to conciliate the poor citizens by agrarian and Corn Laws and to satisfy the Italian armies by promise of Roman citizenship. He was assassinated in 91 BC. The following year the Italian armies rose in revolt, their purpose being to erect a new Italian state governed on the lines of the Roman constitution. This war, which lasted from 90 to 88 BC, is known as the Social War, or the Marsian War, from the important part played in it by the Marsians. The Italians were finally defeated but were granted full citizenship by the Romans.
Following a brutally vindictive massacre of senators and patricians, the consul, Marius, himself died; Cinna remained in power until Sulla, returning from Asia with 40,000 troops in 83 BC, defeated the popular party. As a result of the example set by Sulla, the Republican constitution was thenceforth at the mercy of the strongest leader supported by the strongest troops. After suppressing his enemies by proscription, drawing up and posting in the Forum a list of important men declared to be public enemies and outlaws, Sulla ruled as dictator until his retirement to private life in 79 BC. Rome’s former rich agricultural economy began to decline, and thenceforth more and more of the city’s food was imported, Africa becoming the major source of Rome’s grain supply.
The Rise of Caesar In 67 BC the statesman and general Pompey the Great, who had fought the Marian party in Africa, Sicily, and Spain, cleared the Mediterranean of pirates and was then put in charge of the war against Mithridates. Meanwhile his rival Gaius Julius Caesar rose to prominence, and his political ability had full scope during the absence of Pompey. As leader of the popular party Caesar strengthened his hold on the people.
In Marcus Licinius Crassus, a man of great wealth, Caesar found a tractable ally. Catiline’s conspiracy in 63 BC exposed and defeated by the famous orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero during his consulship, involved Caesar in the ill will in which the middle classes held popular adventurers. Pompey



168
returned from the east and asked the Senate for the ratification of his measures in Asia and the bestowal of land on his legionaries. His demands met with determined opposition, until Caesar, posing as his friend, formed with him and Crassus the coalition known as the first triumvirate.
The triumvirate in 59 BC fulfilled its compact. Caesar obtained the consulship and the satisfaction of Pompey’s demands, conciliated the equestrians, many of whom were wealthy members of the mercantile class, at the expense of the Senate, and had enacted an agrarian law enabling him to reward the troops. His crowning success, however, was his obtaining for five years the military command of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyricum, and late of Transalpine Gaul, where he could gain glory by military conquests, and from which he could watch every political move in Italy.
The triumvirs renewed their alliance, and Caesar procured his command in Gaul for five years more. Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls for the year 55 BC, and in the following year Pompey received as his province the two Spains, with Africa, while Crassus received Syria. The death of Crassus in 53 BC brought Pompey into direct conflict with Caesar. Rome, in the absence of efficient government, was in turmoil until the Senate induced Pompey to remain in Italy, entrusting his provinces to legates; it elected him sole consul for the year 52 BC and made him its champion against Caesar.
The Senate, wishing to terminate Caesar’s military command and defeat his second stand for the consulship in 49 BC, demanded either Caesar’s disbanding of his legions, and his presence in Rome at the time of the election, or his continued command and his renunciation of claims to the consulship. Negotiations failed to solve the deadlock, and in 49 BC Caesar with his legions boldly crossed the Rubicon River, the southern boundary of his province, and advanced on the city, thereby beginning the civil war that continued for five years. Pompey and the leading members of the aristocracy withdrew to Greece, allowing Caesar to enter Rome in triumph. Caesar’s victory, unlike those of the other generals who had marched on Rome, was not followed by a reign of terror; neither proscriptions nor confiscations took place. A policy of economic and administrative reforms was put into effect, in an attempt to overcome corruption and restore prosperity to Rome. Continuing the war against Pompey, Caesar hurried to Spain, where he was victorious over the powerful armies of Pompey’s legates. Returning to Rome, having meanwhile been appointed dictator in his absence, he almost immediately renounced that post and was elected consul. Early in 48 BC he crossed into Greece and dealt Pompey a crushing blow at Pharsalus. Pompey was killed soon after in Egypt, but the Pompeian cause struggled on until 45 BC, when it collapsed at Munda in Spain, and Caesar was made dictator for life.
Caesar’s assassination by Republican nobles on March 15, 44 BC, was followed by Cicero’s attempt to restore the old Republican constitution, but Mark Antony, who had been appointed consul with Caesar, now, at the head of 17 legions, combined forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Caesar’s grandnephew, the youthful Octavian, later Emperor Augustus, to form the second triumvirate. The triumvirs began operations by proscribing and assassinating their opponents, including Cicero. A stand made at Philippi by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius, two of Caesar’s assassins, was crushed by Octavian and Antony, and subsequently the triumvirs divided the control of the empire, Octavian taking Italy and the west, Antony the east, and Lepidus Africa. Antony, going to the east, was captivated by the charms of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt and formerly mistress of Caesar and with her planned an eastern empire. Lepidus, summoned to Sicily by Octavian to assist in the war against Sextus Pompeius, son of Pompey the Great, attempted to seize Sicily for himself and was deprived of his province and his position in the triumvirate. The death of Sextus Pompeius, after the destruction of his fleet in the Mediterranean, left Octavian, who had been sagaciously strengthening his position in the west, with only Antony as rival. After the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the



169
subsequent suicide of both Antony and Cleopatra, the victorious Octavian became, in 29 BC, master of the east also and the undisputed ruler of the entire Roman Empire.
The Empire
Octavian received the title of Augustus in 27 BC and began the new regime by an apparent restoration of the Republic, with himself as princeps, or chief citizen.
The Republican constitution was retained, although until 23 BC as princeps Augustus held the real authority, which thereafter was vested in the tribunician power and the military imperium, or final authority of command. The Senate retained control of Rome, Italy, and the older, more peaceful provinces; the frontier provinces, where legions were necessarily quartered, were governed by legates appointed and controlled by Augustus alone. The corruption and extortion that had existed in Roman provincial administration during the last century of the Republic was no longer tolerated, and the provinces benefited greatly.
Augustus introduced numerous social reforms, especially those calculated to restore the ancient morality of the Roman people and the integrity of marriage; he attempted to combat the licentiousness of the times and sought to restore the ancient religious festivals. He adorned the city with temples, basilicas, and porticoes, transforming it from a city of brick to a city of marble. To the Romans an era of peace and prosperity seemed to have dawned, and the Augustan period represents the culmination of the Golden Age of Latin literature, distinguished in poetry by the achievements of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, and in prose by Livy’s monumental History of Rome.
With the establishment of the imperial system the history of Rome became largely identified with the reigns of individual emperors.
Our Story Continues
That is the history of the events as they happened; the reasons why they happened fill another book. What is important to understand here is that both the Romans and the Jews were waiting for the return of the space-gods of legend, much as some are waiting for the return of Christ around the beginning of this new millennium. Both groups were preparing societies, land, and temples to be the site of the arrival. The Romans rebuilt the Temple of Zeus at Baalbek as a landing place and called it the Temple of Jupiter. They removed obelisks from Egypt in 30 BC, and set them up all over Rome to draw in the energies of the gods, and then dominated all of the Middle East around Israel by conquering the whole system that Alexander the Great had once set up. And, though it might seem that this was an end-of-the-millennium thing, neither the Roman nor the Jewish calendar of the time reflected the end of a millennium.
As a priest of Jupiter, Julius Caesar claimed lineage from the gods, and he declared that the Hebrew Calendar, which began in 3760 BC had come to an end. Once he had attained control of Rome, Caesar abolished the lunar-based Etruscan calendar, and he set up the solar-based Julian calendar in 45 BC, announcing that the new ‘chosen’ people were the Romans. Both were surprised by the birth of ‘a savior’ in the year 7 BC.
The Palestine of the time had three provinces—Galilee and Judea, with Samaria in between. Herod was appointed King of Judea. There were heavy taxes, crucifixion, torture, and a high rate of Jewish suicide. The Jews were desperate for their Messiah–but there was no thought of this messiah being divine.
Plans for the ultimate battle against Rome with the Messiah in command have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. And, as such, Palestine was an occupied country, ruled by a puppet monarchy backed by a highly organized and ruthless military occupational force. An underground guerrilla movement was heavily involved in fighting the oppressors. The messiah many of them expected would be a military leader to lead



170
this ultimate battle plan. Armageddon was to take place at Megiddo as a war between the “Children of Light and the Sons of Darkness”—the Jewish righteous underground led by the messiah, against the legions of Rome. What the people wanted was a forceful liberator to secure their freedom from the Roman overlords.
For Jesus contemporaries no Messiah would ever have been regarded as divine—Christ is Greek for ‘the anointed one’ as in the anointing of a king. David was the Messiah and the Christ, and every subsequent Jewish king of the House of David was known by the same appellation.
The Essene Branch
Much as many would like to deny or suppress it, Jesus was born and raised an Essene. Therefore, it will be necessary for us now to take a look at the Essenes in order to better understand Jesus’ background and his upbringing.
The Essenes were a Jewish religious brotherhood, one of three main philosophical Jewish sects of the time, the other two being the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Sadducees were the small group of wealthy land-owners who collaborated with the Romans. The Pharisees were a progressive group who introduced
much reform and were passively opposed to Rome. The Essenes are striking in the absence of their mention from the Bible for they were as influential and as important as the Sadducees and the Pharisees. They
repudiated conventional Judaism in favor of a form of Gnostic dualism, and were the most esteemed healers in the Holy Land at the time. The biblical character, Samson, who would not cut his hair, was a Nazarite Essene. The word Essene comes from the Greek ‘essenoi’ meaning something secret or mystic—in the healing arts as well.
They were organized on a communal basis and practiced strict asceticism. The order existed in Palestine and Syria from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD. Its chief settlements were on the shores of the Dead Sea. The Essenes are not mentioned in the Bible and neither are they mentioned in rabbinical literature. For a great period of time, the information had regarding them came largely confined to the writings of Philo Judaeus, a Hellenistic Jewish scholar and philosopher of Alexandria; the Roman historian Pliny the Elder; and the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, whose first hand account spoke of the Essenes’ art of healing and knowledge of medicine, said to have come from the ancients.
Their fundamental teachings were love of God, love of virtue, and love of one’s fellow humans. Their fundamental belief was that the universe contained the two cardinal spirits of Light and Darkness. ‘Light’ represented truth and righteousness, and ‘Darkness’ depicted perversion and evil. The balance of one against the other in the cosmos was settled by celestial movement, and people were individually apportioned with degrees of each spirit as defined by their planetary circumstances of birth. Significantly, this cosmic battle between light and darkness was thus perpetuated within humankind and between one person and another; some containing, as we have learned from the story of Enjliou and Callia’s dysfunctional Creation, proportionally more Light, others proportionally less Light. By tradition, the Spirit of Darkness was identified with Belial (worthless); whose children worshipped other gods than Jehovah.
The Spirit of Light was symbolized by the seven-branched candlestick, the Menorah. In the time of the Davidic kings, the Zadokite priest was considered the foremost proponent of the Light.
Gnosticism itself is often thought to have stemmed from the Essene tradition because of the similarity. The basic Gnostic belief was that there are two principles: that of good and that of evil. A balance must be struck between these forces; and the balance is in the hands of the Gnostic—the Knower—partly because nobody else can tell whether an action is for the eventual good of the individual or the community. This secret knowledge comes through the mystical insight which the Gnostics attained.



171
Important features of the Essene community were the communal sharing of property, distributed according to need; strict observance of the Sabbath; and scrupulous cleanliness, which involved washing in cold water and wearing white garments. Prohibited were swearing, taking oaths (other than oaths of membership in the Essenian order), animal sacrifice, the making of weapons, and participation in trade or commerce. The order drew its recruits either from children it had adopted or from the ranks of those who had renounced material things. A probation of three years was required before the novice could take the oath of full membership, which demanded complete obedience and secrecy. Breaking the oath was punishable by expulsion. Because of the continuance of the binding requirement that no food should be eaten that was ceremonially unclean, this penalty was often equivalent to death by starvation. As a society, the Essenes were the first to condemn slavery as a violation of human fellowship. It is reported that they bought and freed slaves owned by others. The Essenes lived in small communities of their own. Their industries were farming and handicrafts.
After 1947 new light was thrown upon the Essenes by the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Khirbat Qumrân, the site of an Essene community until the 1st century AD. Among the scrolls is a Manual of Discipline which can be associated with the Essene pattern of life as known from Greek and Latin sources. Among the ancient books found at Qumran are some of the oldest writings ever found—pre-dating anything from which the traditional Bible was translated.
Of particular interest are certain Biblical commentaries compiled by the Scribes in such a way as to relate the Old Testament texts to the historical events of their own time. The technique applied to link the Old Testament writings with the New Testament era was based on the use of ‘eschatological knowledge’, a form of coded representation that used traditional words and passages to which were attributed special meanings relevant to contemporary understanding. These meanings were only meant to be understood by those who knew the code.
The use of coded radio broadcasts to send messages to the French Resistance in Occupied France during World War II is a similar idea. In this case, the Essene Scribes used messages with “dual layers of meaning”—an evangelical meaning on the surface, and the political information beneath—so that their Roman oppressors would not understand. Much of the translation of this coded system was initially conducted by Barbara Thiering at Sydney University from about 1967 on. It is described in her book, Jesus, the Man, as well as in Laurence Gardner’s Bloodline of the Holy Grail.
The Essenes were trained in the use of this allegorical code which occurs in the Gospel texts in particular relation to those parables heralded by the words ‘for those who have the ears to hear,’ signifying a message for those initiates who needed to know and who understood the code. On a higher level though, it also refers to those who could ascend dimensionally in order to be able to receive the wisdom of the soundencoded words and messages in such texts as the Emerald Tablets of Thoth.
The codeword for Rome was “Babylon,” while the phrase ‘the Word of God’ is said to have signified Jesus. This symbolism remained fairly constant –as in the case of Jesus himself, and established from the very outset in the Gospel of John:
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God . . . And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. (John 1:1, 14)
Whenever the phrase ‘the Word of God’ is used (with or without a capital “W”), it meant that Jesus was either present or was the subject of the narrative—as in Luke 5:1 when ‘the Word of God’ stood by the lake. Other such code words and their meanings necessary for us to understand here are:



172
‘the lion’ which stands for the Roman Emperor,
‘The Way’ was the doctrinal theme of the Essene community,
‘Children of Light’ were those who followed the Way,
‘The many’ was the head of the community,
‘The poor’ were those initiated into higher echelons of the community,
‘the crowd’ was the regional governor,
‘the multitude’ was the governing council.
‘the Children’ were the novices in the Essene sect,
‘lepers’ were those who were uninitiated,
‘the blind’ were people not party to the Way,
‘healing the blind or a leper ‘ meant converting them,
‘raised from the dead’ meant released from excommunication,
‘the unclean’ were uncircumcised gentiles,
‘the sick’ were those in public or clerical disgrace,
Clouds, sheep, fishes, loaves, ravens, doves, and camels all had similar coded meanings. A fisher of men then becomes a leader, much as were the Fisher Kings of Grail lore later on.
Today we have the same type of situation using slang meanings for countless words such as screws, fences, sharks, angels, bulls, bears, and stars, and none of them would be taken literally in the context of its slang usage. Some of these coded words were actually titles: The doctrine of the Essene community was “the Light,” represented by a triarchy. The Priest, the King, and the Prophet became then ‘the Power’, ‘the Kingdom’, and ‘the Glory’. In the clerical patriarchy, ‘the Father’ was supreme; his two immediate deputies were designated as his ‘Son’ and his ‘Spirit’.
Within the Essene community in Qumran, there was strict observance of ritual and tradition. The symbolic representative of the Spirit of Darkness in the community was the Chief of Scribes whose role was to provide a formal opposition within the hierarchical structure, and to test the initiates. He held the Hebrew title ‘Satan’ (Accuser), the equivalent of which in Greek is ‘diabolos’ (Aggressor), commonly called ‘devil.’ This led to the idea of the Devil’s Advocate who probed the background of potential candidates for canonization in the Roman Catholic Church. Satan the opposer is, of course, based on Lucifer.
It was within this strict observance of traditional Essene roles and the secrecy surrounding their community that Jesus was born in 7 BC, not in the year 0 as is commonly believed. It is also with the violent and rebellious times of political and religious oppression that he was born also—a ready solution to an old problem.
Jesus
Much like Quetzalcoatl, Moses, and many of the other historical figures we have studied so far, there is Jesus the man, and there is also Jesus the legend. It is a historical fact that in the two thousand years since his birth, the truth surrounding his birth, his life, and his death, has been edited, enhanced, censored and fabricated by its promoters. At various councils in succeeding centuries, the Bible was edited and knocked into shape according to the views of bishops and monarchs –especially the Roman Emperor Constantine,



173
one of the institution-builders of the Roman Catholic Church. That process of creative interpretation and manipulation still goes on today. The Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican are heavily invested in keeping certain information from the public, and so have been at the forefront of archeological digs that may turn up information embarrassing to their position and their role. This has been especially true of the Dead Sea Scrolls, where it has taken almost 50 years for realistic interpretations of some of the scrolls to be released. That Vatican-controlled researchers were in charge of the process says enough. Jesus’ very connection with the Essenes and to Qumran has been totally eradicated from the Bible—the absence of such a major influence being suspicious in and of itself.
In one of the few passages written by Pliny the Younger (62-113 CE) that mentions the word Christians, it is believed that the word had been changed from ‘Essenes’ who Pliny wrote about often.
St. Augustine (354-430), admitted, “I should not believe in the truth of the Gospels unless the authority of the Catholic Church forced me to do so.”
Also not mentioned in the Gospels is any word about the Zealots (the Jewish resistance movement of the time), one researcher suggesting that this fact must surely be indicative of a relationship between Jesus and these patriots which the Evangelists preferred not to disclose. The two men who were crucified with Jesus are explicitly described as lestai—the appellation by which the Zealots were known to the Romans.
According to Elaine Pagels, attributing a specific writing to a specific apostle may also bear a symbolic meaning.
“The title of the Gospel of Mary suggests that its revelation came from a direct, intimate communication with the Savior. The hint of an erotic relationship between him and Mary Magdalene may indicate claims to mystical communion; throughout history, mystics of many traditions have chosen sexual metaphors to describe their experiences. The titles of the Gospel of Thomas and the book of Thomas the Contender (attributed to Jesus’ “twin brother”) may suggest that “you, the reader, are Jesus’ twin brother.” Whoever comes to understand these books discovers, like Thomas, that Jesus is his “twin,” his spiritual “other self” (The idea of Jesus and Lucifer as the two different gods of duality).
Birth and Early Years
One thing that is historically evident from the information available is that the Church has gone to great lengths to acquire and conceal or to destroy all other records of Jesus’ life that do not confirm their own version of the story from the very earliest of times right up till recent decades. What has been left is often the product of confusing translations, many words from the ancient texts having had several different meanings or denotations. It is a common practice today in public relations that when a situation cannot be covered up, the best solution is to flood the information available with many different and varying opinions to ‘murky the water’ so to speak—to confuse the issue so that no one knows what is right, or what is wrong.
For instance, only two of the gospels speak of Jesus’ origins and birth at all, Matthew and Luke. According to Matthew, Jesus was of aristocratic stock, descended from David via Solomon. According to Luke, what we get in Jesus is the poor carpenter’s son. Luke says he was visited by shepherds on his birth; Matthew, by kings. Luke says Jesus lived in Nazareth and his parents had traveled to Bethlehem for him to be born in a census which history says never happened.
In addition, not a few people have noticed the irreconcilability of the December birthdate with the circumstances of the birth which could not have taken place in the winter, with “shepherds tending their flock,” etc. ben Yehoshua relates the origins of the January 6th date: “Originally the eastern Christians



174
believed that [Jesus] was born on 6 January . . . Osiris-Aion was said to be born of the virgin Isis on the 6th January and this explains the earlier date for Christmas.”
Matthew says the family lived in Bethlehem in a house and was fairly well-to-do, and that they had to flee to Egypt to escape Herod’s persecution, moving to Nazareth upon their return. Unfortunately, the term ‘Nazarene’ was sectarian, coming from the word ‘Nozrim’ –Keepers of the Covenant—referring to the Essene community. John the Baptist and Jesus’ brother James were also Nazarites. Paul was brought up as a leader of the sect of Nazarenes. The town of Nazareth does not appear on any of the contemporary maps, books, or texts from that era, either Roman or Judean. St Paul does not mention Nazareth, nor is it mentioned in the Talmud.
A version of Flavius Josephus’s work in Old Russian differs from others in that it portrays Jesus as “human,” as an apolitical revolutionary, and as a “king who did not reign.” He is also said to have had a “line in the middle of his head in the manner of the Nazireans.”
Nobody remembered what Jesus looked like. Citing Isaiah, one wing of Christian opinion argued that he had chosen ‘a mean and ugly human form’.
The word ‘Christ’ comes from the Greek, Christos meaning ‘King’, and shall not be used in this text except where quoted.
Similarly the word for carpenter, ‘naggar’ could also be translated as ‘scholar’ or ‘teacher’ —the Greek ‘ho tekton’ defined them as men with skills, masters of what they did. One translation that shall prove interesting later relates to ‘a master of the craft’, as would be applied to modern Freemasonry. There is also no basis for the birth in a stable, however, mangers were often used as substitute sleeping arrangements inside a building.
The Gnostic scripture, The Secret Book According to John, tells the story of Jesus birth in the higher dimensions from ‘the great invisible virgin spirit’ and how this related to the entirety (Soul):
“They stood at rest and glorified the invisible spirit and the Barbelo, for because of the Barbelo they had come to exist. And the holy spirit perfected the divine self-originate, the offspring of itself and the Barbelo, so as to make the offspring stand at rest before the great invisible virgin spirit. The divine self-originate, the anointed (Christ), who glorified the spirit with a great voice, was shown forth by forethought. And the invisible virgin spirit established the self-originate as true god over the entirety, and subordinated to it (the self
originate) all authority and the truth that was in it (the spirit), so that it might know about the entirety: which is called by a name that is superior to every name, for that name will be uttered to those who are worthy of it.”
At Psalms 72:17, we read, “May his name endure for ever, his fame continue as long as the sun,” and at Malachi 1:11 states, “For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations.”
The risen Christ explains to Peter that those who “name themselves bishop, and also deacon, as if they had received their authority from God, “are, in reality, “waterless canals.” (Apocalypse of Peter 79.24-30, in NHL 343) Although they “do not understand mystery,” they “boast that the mystery of truth belongs to them alone.” (ibid. 76.27-34, in NHL342.) The author accuses them of having misinterpreted the apostle’s teaching, and thus having set up “an imitation church” in place of the true Christian “brotherhood.” (ibid. 78.31-79.10, in NHL 343)
The Nine say that Mary and Joseph had seven other male and three female children besides Jesus, and that Mary was implanted by the Hoova through artificial insemination. But this is not true. They admit that Jesus was birthed from a very high dimension, and unfortunately this means that the records of his origins are not even available to them at their level of understanding and existence.



175
One thing is clear from the Qumran Scrolls is that the Community (the Essenes at Qumran) lived in expectation of two important Messiahs. One would be of the priestly caste, whom they called the “teacher of Righteousness;” the other would be a prince of the line of David—a warrior who would restore the kingdom to his people.
Jesus says: “If spirit came into being because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders. Indeed, I am amazed at how this great wealth (the spirit) has made its home in this poverty (body).” (Gospel of Thomas, 38.33-39.2, In NHL 121)
Peter Moon describes a meeting in one of his books with a woman named Anna who was able to astral travel and see her past lives, as many of us can. She remembers being a rebel astrologer in the days of the Essenes when the group was looking for a woman to bear ‘Christ’, and she was one of the candidates.
Joseph and Mary were both members of this Essene community—Joseph, a ‘scholar’ of the temple. This Community observed some highly regulated disciplines in relation to dynastic betrothal and matrimony. Therefore, once Mary became ‘espoused’ in contractual wedlock to Joseph, she afterwards was referred to as his ‘wife.’ The original Hebrew word, ‘almah,’ that has incorrectly been translated as ‘virgin,’ actually means ‘young maiden.’ The Hebrew word for virgin is “bethulah.” The Greek ‘virgo’ means unmarried not virgin, unless accompanied by intacta (virgo intacta).
Mary was already Joseph’s wife, so how could she be a virgin? But she still could be a ‘young maiden’ going through a probationary period of spousal during which sexual relations were forbidden by the community’s matrimonial discipline. An old monastic complex that stood on the outskirts of the Qumran Community had among its buildings a house where Essene children were born out of wedlock. The Community referred to this house as ‘Bethlehem of Judea’ (See Barbara Thiering Jesus the Man Ch. 9, pp 50-2). If anything, Jesus was born before his mother had served the statutory probationary period as a married woman of the dynastic hierarchy applicable to the Messianic lines of King David and Zadok the Priest.
The Essenes preserved the names of the angels within their hierarchy of the members of the priesthood within the community. Thus the Zadok priest was termed ‘archangel Michael,’ and others the ‘archangel Gabriel’, and so on. It was through the mediation of the priest whose title was ‘Gabriel’ that the early pregnancy of Mary was accepted. The bride was still considered an ‘almah’ until the ritual Second Marriage which took place at three months time into the first pregnancy.
Mary gave birth at the wrong time. Sunday March 1, 7 BC. The expression “conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost’ means the birth was approved by the priest who bore the title Gabriel.
The Gospel of Philip, a text found amongst those at Nag Hammadi states, “Some say Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit. They are wrong. They do not know what they are saying.” The Gospel of James among the same findings says that Mary was a sacred Temple nun, therefore considered a ‘holy virgin’ (preparing herself for the ultimate ‘hierogamous’).
His parents did not call him Immanu-El (‘with us is god’), but Yehoshua (Jehovah saves). Jesus actually had three brothers and four sisters, but he was the firstborn. The second birth, in what would have been equivalent to 0 AD, was that of Jesus’ brother James, known as James the Just.
The Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus Christ, which dates from no later than the second century and possibly before—portrays Jesus as a brilliant but eminently human child. All too human perhaps—for he is portrayed as violent and unruly, prone to shocking displays of temper and a rather irresponsible exercise of



176
his powers. Indeed, on one occasion he strikes dead another child who offends him. A similar fate is visited upon an autocratic mentor.
One strange incident that is related in this gospel is that when Jesus was circumcised, his foreskin is said to have been appropriated by an unidentified old woman who preserved it in an alabaster box used for oil of spikenard. “This is the alabaster box (from) which Mary the sinner procured and poured forth the ointment on the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ.” If this is true, it seems evident here that the anointing had been foreseen and prepared for long in advance of its actual occurrence. And the whole incident implies a connection—albeit an obscure and convoluted one—between the Magdalen and Jesus’ family long before Jesus embarked on his mission at the age of thirty.
The act of circumcision is all the more strange when its origins are not made clear. Among other reasons, including purportedly serving to make men more docile and socially acceptable, circumcision was said to be done in imitation of the female’s menstrual blood, “being performed on boys at the age when girl’s first ‘bled’, and even being described among some peoples as ‘man’s menstruation.’
For such the essence (essene-ce) of the God that Jesus was supposed to have been, there are so many very human things about him. Circumcision, you see, was also meant to keep the penis clean exactly for the express purpose of not carrying infection during intercourse.
At the age of 14, and within a year of his manhood, Jesus is supposed to have begun a long journey in which he went to the Himalayas, and spent a long time in Egypt, learning the ancient mysteries. It is said that he and John the Baptist spent time together in Egypt. Some say he even went to Japan. All we need to know and confirm here is that Jesus DID study the ancient mystery in Egypt.
Prof. Fida Hassnain, a Kashmiri historian, in A Search for Historical Jesus from Buddhist, Islamic and Sanskrit Sources, reports that according to the chronicles he found from Persia, India and Tibet, and stemming from these early days when he is supposed to have been out of Palestine learning, that Jesus was ‘a world teacher’. It is said he became monopolized by the Christian Church, to the exclusion of all the other faiths which had adopted “St. Issa” as a saint and a prophet. However, none of this is true.
The Marriage
As we have said, Jesus personal life remains hidden from the normal texts available, and is therefore a constant source of debate.
Nowhere in the Bible does it state that he was unmarried. At that time, not only was the heir to the Davidic line obliged by law to marry, but he was also required to sire at least two sons. The Gospel does state that many of the disciples were married—Peter, for example. And at no point does Jesus advocate celibacy. As he did not preach it, there is no reason to suppose he practiced it. Celibacy was condemned and marriage was almost mandatory. It was obligatory for a Jewish father to find his son a wife. If celibate, it would have characterized him greatly in the times. One of the Gospels would have mentioned it, for it would have been so unusual as to have attracted comment and much attention. There is no reference to any such celibacy. Jesus’ role as a rabbi would have made marriage virtually certain for Jewish Mishnaic Law says: “An unmarried man may not be a teacher.”
So if he was married, who would have been the most likely candidate? Most advocates of Jesus having been married point to Mary Magdalen(e). In fact, the relationship is openly discussed in The Gospel of Philip:
“And the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene. But Christ loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on the mouth. The rest of the disciples were offended by it and expressed disapproval. They said unto him, Why do you love her more than all of us? The Saviour answered and said



177
to them, Why do I not love you like her? . . . Great is the mystery of marriage—for without it the world would not have existed. Now the existence of the world depends on man, and the existence of man on marriage.”
Another concept which comes out of Edgar Cayce’s Readings is that we, as individuals, are Israel and that the twelve tribes and what they represent are all aspects of our spiritual selves. This interpretation is one which has a dual existence alongside the factual role of the physical or geographical Israel. Indeed,
according to the Readings much of the Bible can be interpreted either physically, mentally, or spiritually, and often on all levels at simultaneously. This three-dimensional theme recurs again and again throughout the Readings as a symbolic trinity representative of the earth plane.
Magdalen is called his “companion,” but this could also be translated as ‘spouse’.
The particular events as described in the Bible which help support the fact that Jesus was married are first, the marriage feast at Cana. The feast was not the ceremony of the marriage itself, but the sacred meal that precedes the betrothal. The custom was for there to be a formal host; he would be in full charge as the ruler of the feast. Secondary authority rested only in the bridegroom and his mother –and this is entirely relevant for, when the matter of the Communion wine arose, Jesus’ mother said to the servants (John 2:5), ‘Whatsoever he saith to you, do it’. No invited guests would have had any such right of command. It is plain therefore that Jesus and the bridegroom were one and the same.
It is, in fact, curious that his mother was at the wedding in Cana, and that he was specifically “called” to it though he had not started his ministry. The wedding is a lavish affair, very costly, but who the bride and groom were seems to remain anonymous. Mary acts like she is in charge. Why should two guests at the wedding take on the catering? The statement, “The governor of the feast called the bridegroom . . . but thou hast kept the good wine until now,” seems to be directly talking to Jesus described as the bridegroom (John 2:9-10).
Mary Magdalen was from Migdal or Migdala in Galilee. Her roles in the events of the Bible seem deliberately obscured for some reason. She is hardly mentioned in Mark and Matthew, except as a follower. In Luke she appears quite early while Jesus is preaching in Galilee, and it would seem thus that she accompanies him from Galilee to Judea. In those times, it would have been unthinkable for an unmarried woman to travel unaccompanied –even more so to travel unaccompanied with a religious teacher and his entourage. Magdalen is not, at any point in the Gospels, said to be a prostitute. She is, however, said to have supported Jesus and his disciples with their financial resources, indicating that she must have been fairly wealthy.
The second incident that suggests Jesus being married is the anointing of his head at Simon’s house by Mary of Bethany (Matthew 26:6-7 and Mark 14:3)—the oil containing his foreskin appropriated by the unidentified old woman. Not only did she anoint his head, but she also anointed his feet, and wiped them afterwards with her hair. Two and a half years earlier, she had performed this same ritual of foot anointing three months after the Cana wedding feast.
This is an allusion to the ancient rite by which a royal bride prepared her bridegroom’s table. To perform the rite with spikenard was the express privilege of a Messianic bride, and was performed solely at the First Marriage and Second Marriage ceremonies. Only as a full wife of Jesus, and as a priestess in her own right, could Mary have anointed both his head and his feet with the sacred ointment.
Spikenard is the name of the fragrant, sweet-smelling ointment compounded from the nard plant, which in those days grew only in the Himalayan Mountains at heights of around 15,000 ft. and was extremely expensive in those days. It is the plant that Gilgamesh finds and then loses.



178
Does this mean that Mary of Bethany was his spouse?
Just as Hebrew men who were appointed to various patriarchal positions took on names that represented their ancestors—such as Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph—so too were the women styled according to their genealogy and rank. Their nominal styles included Rachel, Rebecca, and Sarah. Wives of the Zadok and David male lines held the ranks of Elisheba (Elizabeth) and Miriam (Mary) respectively. It is also why, in compliance with this same practice, Jesus’ own wife would also have been Mary. These women had the ceremony of their Second Marriage only once they were three months pregnant, at which time the bride ceased to be an almah and became a designated mother.
Sexual relations were permitted only in December: husbands and wives lived apart for the rest of the year. At the outset of a period of separation, the wife was classified as a widow (one rank in status below an almah) and was required to weep for her husband. This is described in Luke 7:38, when Mary of Bethany, on the first occasion, is said to have ‘stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears’. Once the period of symbolic widowhood had been established, and during these lengthy periods of separation, the wife was given the conventional designation sister, just as the modern nun might be termed. Many of these titles are indeed carried on symbolically in the Catholic Church where the women are termed nuns, sisters, or ‘brides of Christ’.
Who was ‘Mary of Bethany’? In the Bible she and Martha are only ever referred to as ‘sisters’ at the house of Lazarus of Bethany. Mary’s full title was Sister Miriam Magdala – or, as she is better known, Mary Magdalene.
Gregory I, Bishop of Rome (590-604), and St. Bernard, the Cistercian Abbot of Clairvaux (1090-1153), both confirmed that Mary of Bethany was synchronous with Mary Magdalene.
Jesus supported the act: (Mark 14:9) ‘Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.”
The betrothal communion took place three months before Mary first anointed Jesus’ feet at Simon’s house. The rules were strictly defined. Only as Jesus’ bride would Mary have been permitted to perform this act as laid down by Messianic tradition. With her First Marriage duly completed in the September, she would also have wept for her husband (as in Luke 7:38) before they were parted for their statutory separation. Prior to this, as a betrothed almah, she would have been classified as a sinner and ranked as a crippled woman. The couple would not have come together for any physical union until the following December.
The last event that seems to prove that Jesus was married is the coming from the house: By the tenets of the Judaic law at the time, a woman “sitting shivah” would have been strictly forbidden to emerge from the house except at the express bidding of her husband.
Marrying the Magdalen would also have given Jesus greater rights to the title of heir to the messianic throne of David. Saul (the Benjamite line) was the first king of Israel, but was deposed by David of the Tribe of Judah. David not only deprived the Benjamites of their claim to the throne but by establishing his capital as Jerusalem, he deprived them of their rightful inheritance as well.
Jesus might have been looked upon as a usurper, unless, however, he was married to a Benjamite woman. Tradition states that the Magdalen was of the Tribe of Benjamin.
The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and John also all cite the Magdalen as being present at the crucifixion. None of them cites Mary of Bethany. It is to Mary Magdalen that he first appears at the empty tomb, and it was to her that Jesus chose to reveal his resurrection.



179
The significance of Jesus having been married is the question of whether or not he had any children, thus implanting his genes into the gene pool of the world. This we shall take up a little later. Why it has been covered up is because so much of Jesus’ divinity rests in his ‘being born of the Virgin Mary’ and ascending into heaven after ‘being crucified, dead and buried’. The power of the priesthood comes only from having a divine being that people are willing to worship and thereby use the services of a priest as an intermediary. We shall take up this trail also in a later chapter.
“He did have loving physicalness with a woman, but that does not mean he offspringed children,” say the Nine.
The Ministry
One modern expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls believes that the scrolls “give added ground for believing that many incidents (in the New Testament) are merely projections into Jesus’ own history of what was expected of the Messiah.” In fact, some scholars suggest that Jesus, familiar as he was with the prophecies of the Patriarchs, actually scripted his life around these prophecies.
At the time of his father’s death in AD 23, the prevailing Zadok priest was Jesus’ own kinsman, John the Baptist. At age 30, Jesus, following the role we have seen Akhenaton and others set, decided to create his own organized party of supporters: a party that would not follow any conventional social policy. In doing this, Jesus became a threat not only to Herod and his faction (the Herodians), and to the Romans in general, but also to the sectarian nationalists (the Pharisees and the Sadducees) who sought Jewish supremacy over the Gentiles.
In fact, for all his apparent humility, there is very little to portray anything faint-hearted or pacifist about Jesus, leaving it to us to suggest that Jesus was in fact the latter of the two messiahs the Essenes had been waiting for, ‘a prince of the line of David—a warrior who would restore the kingdom to his people.’
“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword’. (Matthew 10:34) And the Gospels appear to indicate that his envoys followed blindly in this cause, many of them carrying swords. Peter had one when Jesus was arrested, and used it to cut off one of the guard’s ears. It is no secret to Bible readers that the Apostles were armed. At the start of his campaign, Jesus says, “He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.” (Luke 22:36)
Jesus is often said to have spoken in the form of ‘parables’. These were frequently political, and were based on actual people and real situations. Indeed the majority of Jesus’ activities were cleverly disguised, as was the Essene way, so that “those who had the ears to hear’ would understand, whereas others would not.
So it is with the story of the temptation in the desert. Although it is a story for ‘those who have the ears to hear’ and can be translated on that level, as we shall do, it is also an allegory for Lucifer, Jesus, and all of us about the power of choice—never forgetting that in all things, the FATHER has given us Free Will.
Adam was given authority over planet Earth, including its creatures and its elements. “And God blessed them and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’” (Genesis 1:28) Adam had complete power of attorney when he chose to reject God and follow Satan. Legal ownership of mankind, animals, and the Earth, was then transferred to Satan.
“Jesus certainly knew Satan had won legal right to the world. When Satan personally tempted Jesus, displaying at that time his ability to deceive. The Scriptures say, “And the devil said to Him, “I will give you all



180
this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give It to whomever I wish.” (Luke 4:6). (Satan is Alive)
In terms of the Essene coded language, it was as Chief of the Scribes for the Community at the time, that Judas Sicariote (Judas Iscariote) also held the post of ‘the tempter’. It was thus with Judas that Jesus debated when he was ‘led up of the Spirit into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil’. Judas was at that time seeking to become the ‘Father’ level priest in the place of John the Baptist. The gist of the negotiation with Jesus was that if Jesus would support Judas’ claim to priestly eminence, he would assist Jesus to become king. ‘All this power I will give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.’
In the case of the ‘miracle’ of turning water into wine, the great significance of Jesus’ action was that he took it upon himself to break with tradition: he abandoned the water entirely and allowed the ‘unclean’ guests to take the sacred wine, translated in the Bible as turning ‘water into wine’.
The events of Palm Sunday related in the Bible were meant to remind people of Simon Maccabaeus who delivered Palestine from Syria in the 142 BC Maccabean Revolt. Jesus was not well known at the time, and did not receive the acclaim he had expected, or hoped for: Matthew 21:10: “And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?” Thus he decided to play up his entrance in a form that had been tradition from the time of Solomon, that Davidic kings all rode to their coronations on mules, for it had been prophesied in the Old Testament book of Zecharia (9:9). . ‘and riding on an ass’.
Communion with consecrated bread and wine was an age-old Essene tradition, not a product of later Christianity symbolizing the body and blood of Jesus. As we have now found out, it was easier to have communion with or ‘commun-icate’ with the Lord after partaking of the particular Bread of Life known as shem-an-na.
The Crucifixion
In a recently channeled message from Sananda (Jesus) on a very popular website, this being explained a part of hat went on with the crucifixion of Jesus:
“The crucifixion was not something that happened by accident. The plan for this event was formulated thousands of years ago during a period of history known as Atlantis. Over thousands of years the way for this event was prepared through the focus of the Mystery Schools of Egypt. These Mystery Schools were
founded by wise men that left Atlantis before the destruction of that continent. The understanding of how and why to set up this event was given to these wise men by Melchizedek, a name mentioned in the Christian bible.
“I lived a lifetime as an Atlantean king and was also martyred during it. I was captured and killed. The person that betrayed my hiding place was the same being known as Judas during the lifetime as Jesus. In Atlantis the kings were also priests and holders of great knowledge including the ability to use energy. Writings left behind tell of the focus of the Mystery Schools to place and hold the crucifixion event in the scenario of the earth milestones toward advancement of the current human race. If these records are found, decoded and given to humanity rather than kept hidden through the influence of the Catholic Church, the misinterpretations and outright lies that have been used to control the masses of Christians believers will be clearly revealed.”
The crucifixion shall begin Chapter 1 of Volume 3 of Where Were You Before the Tree of Life? -- The True History of the Darkness and of the Light.
