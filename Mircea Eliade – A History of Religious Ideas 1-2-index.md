Preface
For the historian of religions, every manifestation of the sacred is important: every rite, every myth, every belief or divine figure reflects the experience of the sacred and hence implies the notions of being, of meaning, and of truth. As I observed on another occasion, "it is difficult to imagine how the human mind could function without the conviction that there is something irreducibly real in the world; and it is impossible to imagine how consciousness could appear without conferring a meaning on man's impulses and experiences. Consciousness of a real and meaningful world is intimately connected with the discovery of the sacred. Through experience of the sacred, the human mind has perceived the difference between what reveals itself as being real, powerful, rich, and meaningful and what lacks these qualities, that is, the chaotic and dangerous flux of things, their fortuitous and senseless appearances and disappearances" (preface to The Quest: History and Meaning in Religion [1969]). In short, the " sacred" is an element in the structure of consciousness and not a stage in the history of consciousness. On the most archaic levels of culture, living, considered as being human, is in itself a religious act, for food-getting, sexual life, and work have a sacramental value. In other words, to be-or, rather, to become-a man signifies being" religious" (ibid.). I have discussed the dialectic of the sacred and its morphology in earlier publications, from my Patterns in Comparative Religion (1958) to my little book devoted to Australian religions (Australian Religions: An Introduction [1973]). The present work was conceived and executed from a different point of view. On the one hand, I have analyzed the manifestations of the sacred in chronological order (but it is important not to confuse the "age" of a religious conception



xiv PREFACE
with the date of the earliest document that attests to it !); on the other hand-and insofar as the documentation makes it possible-I have emphasized the crises in depth and, above all, the creative moments of the different traditions. In short, I have attempted to elucidate the major contributions to the history of religious ideas and beliefs. Every manifestation of the sacred is important to the historian of religions; but it is no less obvious that the structure of the god Anu, for example, or the theogony and cosmogony handed down in the Enuma elish, or the saga of Gilgamesh, reveal the religious creativity and originality of the Mesopotamians more effectively than, let us say, the apotropaic rites against Lamashtu or the mythology of the god Nusku. Sometimes the importance of a religious creation is revealed by its later valorizations. Very little is known about the Eleusinian Mysteries and the earliest manifestations of Orphism; yet the fascination that they have exercised over the best minds of Europe for more than twenty centuries constitutes a religious fact that is highly significant and whose consequences have not yet been properly understood. Certainly, the Eleusinian initiation and the secret Orphic rites, extolled by certain late authors, reflect mythologizing Gnosticism and Greco-Oriental syncretism. But it is precisely this conception of the Mysteries and of Orphism that influenced medieval Hermeticism, the Italian Renaissance, the "occultist" traditions of the eighteenth century, and Romanticism; and the Mysteries and the Orpheus that inspired modern European poetry, from Rilke to T. S. Eliot and Pierre Emmanuel, are still the Mysteries and the Orpheus of the scholars and mystics and theologians of Alexandria. The validity of the criterion chosen to define the great contributions to the history of religious ideas is, of course, open to discussion. Yet the development of many religions confirms it; for it is because of crises in depth and the creations that result from them that religious traditions are able to renew themselves. It is enough to cite the case of India, where the tension and despair brought on by the religious devalorization of the Brahmanic sacrifice produced a series of outstanding creations (the Upanishads, the codification of Yogic techniques, the message of Gautama Buddha, mystical devotion, etc.), each one of them constituting a different and daring resolution of the same crisis (see chapters 9, 17, 18, and 19). For years I have had in mind a short, concise work, which could



Preface xv
be read in a few days. For continuous reading reveals above all the fundamental unity of religious phenomena and at the same time the inexhaustible newness of their expressions. The reader of such a book would be given access to the Vedic hymns, the Briihma1)as, and the Upanishads a few hours after he had reviewed the ideas and beliefs of the Paleolithics, of Mesopotamia, and of Egypt; he would discover Sankara, Tantrism and Milarepa, Islam, Gioacchino da Fiore or Paracelsus, the day after he had meditated on Zarathustra, Gautama Buddha, and Taoism, on the Hellenistic Mysteries, the rise of Christianity, Gnosticism, alchemy, or the mythology of the Grail; he would encounter the German illuminists and Romantics, Hegel, Max Muller, Freud, Jung, and Bonhoeffer, soon after discovering Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha, the twelve Alva.rs and Gregory Palamas, the earliest Cabalists, Avicenna or Eisai. Alas, that short, concise book has not yet been written. For the moment, I have resigned myself to presenting a work in three volumes, in the hope of eventually reducing it to one volume of some 400 pages. I have chosen this compromise formula for two reasons in particular: on the one hand, I considered it advisable to quote a certain number of texts that are both important and insufficiently known; on the other hand, I wanted to provide the student with comparatively full critical bibliographies. So I have reduced footnotes to the text to the absolute minimum and have brought together, in a separate section, the bibliographies and the discussion of certain matters either not referred to at all or treated too summarily in the text. Hence the work can be read continuously, without the interruptions necessitated by discussions of sources and summaries of the present position of studies on particular points. Books presenting a general view of a subject and intended for an audience of other than specialists usually provide a list of titles at the end of each chapter. The structure of this History of Religious Ideas demanded a more complex critical apparatus. So I have divided the chapters into numbered sections, each with its own title. The student can thus easily consult the bibliographies and the summaries of the present position of studies in the second part of the book as he pursues his reading of the text. For each section I have tried to provide the essential recent critical bibliography, not omitting works whose methodological orientation I do not share. With very few exceptions, I have not mentioned contributions published in the Scandinavian, Slavic, or



XVI PREFACE
Balkan languages. To facilitate reading, I have simplified the transliteration of Oriental terms and proper names.
Except for a few chapters, this book reproduces the substance of the courses in the History of Religions that I have given at the University of Bucharest from 1933 to 1938, at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes in 1946 and 1948, and, since 1956, at the University of Chicago. I belong to the category of historians of religions who, whatever their "specialty" may be, make every effort to keep up with the progress achieved in neighboring domains and do not hesitate to keep their students informed concerning the various problems raised by their discipline. I hold, in short, that any historical study implies a certain familiarity with universal history; hence the strictest specialization does not absolve the scholar from situ!lting his researches in the perspective of universal history. I also share the conviction of those who think that the study of Dante or Shakespeare, and even of Dostoevski or Proust, is illuminated by a knowledge of Kalidasa, the Noh plays, or the Pilgrim Monkey. This is not a matter of a vain and, in the end, sterile pseudo-encyclopedism. It is simply a matter of not losing sight of the profound and indivisible unity of the history of the human mind. Consciousness of this unity of the spiritual history of humanity is a recent discovery, which has not yet been sufficiently assimilated. Its importance for the future of our discipline will become manifest in the last chapter of the third volume. It is also in this final chapter, in the course of a discussion of the crises brought on by the masters of reductionism-from Marx and Nietzsche to Freud-and of the contributions made by anthropology, the history of religions, phenomenology, and the new hermeneutics, that the reader will be able to judge the sole, but important, religious creation of the modern Western world. I refer to the ultimate stage of desacralization. The process is of considerable interest to the historian of religions, for it illustrates the complete camouflage of the "sacred "-more precisely, its identification with the "profane."
In the course of fifty years of work, I have learned a great deal from my masters, my colleagues, and my students. To all of them, whether dead or living, I continue to feel the most sincere gratitude. Like everything else that I have written since 1950, this book could not



Preface xvii
have been brought to completion without the presence, the affection, and the devotion of my wife. It is with joy and gratitude that I inscribe her name on the first page of what will probably be my last contribution to a discipline that is dear to us.

A HISTORY
OF RELIGIOUS
IDEAS






1 In the Beginning...:
Magico-Religious Behavior of the Paleanthropians
1. Orientatio. Tools to make tools. The" domestication" of fire
Despite its importance for an understanding of the religious phenomenon, we shall not here discuss the problem of "hominization." It is sufficient to recall that the vertical posture already marks a transcending of the condition typical of the primates. Uprightness cannot be maintained except in a state of wakefulness. It is· because of man's vertical posture that space is organized in a structure inaccessible to the prehominians: in four horizontal directions radiating from an "up"-" down" central axis. In other words, space can be organized around the human body as extending forward, backward, to right, to left, upward, and downward. It is from this original and originating experience-feeling oneself "thrown" into the middle of an apparently limitless, unknown, and threatening extension-that the different methods of orientatio are developed; for it is impossible to survive for any length of time in the vertigo brought on by disorientation. This experience of space oriented around a "center" explains the importance of the paradigmatic divisions and distributions of territories, agglomerations, and habitations and their cosmological symbolism (cf. § 12).1 An equally decisive difference from the mode of existence of the primates is clearly shown by the use of tools. The Paleanthropians not only use tools, they are also able to manufacture them. It is true that certain monkeys use objects as if they were tools, and are even known to make them in certain cases. But the Paleanthropians also produce tools to make tools. In addition, their use of tools is much
1. Though he is no longer conscious of its" existential" value, the experience of oriented space is still familiar to the man of modern societies.



4 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
more complex; they keep them accessible, ready for use in the future. In short, their use of tools is not confined to a particular situation or a specific moment, as is the case with monkeys. It is also important to note that tools do not serve as extensions of the human body, for the earliest-known worked stones were shaped to perform a function not prefigured in the body's structure, namely, the function of cutting (an action completely different from tearing with the teeth or scratching with the nails).2 The very slow progress made in technology does not imply a similar development of intelligence. We know that the extraordinary upsurge in technology during the past two centuries has not found expression in a comparable development of Western man's intelligence. Besides, as has been said, "every innovation brought with it the danger of collective death" (Andre Varagnac). Their technical immobility insured the survival of the Paleanthropians. The domestication of fire-that is, the possibility of producing, preserving, and transporting it-marks, we might say, the definitive separation of the Paleanthropians from their zoological predecessors. The most ancient" document" for the use of fire dates from Choukoutien (about 600,000 B.C.), but its domestication probably took place much earlier and in several places. These few well-known facts needed to be repeated so that the reader of the following analyses will bear in mind that prehistoric man already behaved in the manner of a being endowed with intelligence and imagination. As for the activity of the unconsciousdreams, fantasies, visions, fabulization, and so on-it is presumed not to have differed in intensity and scope from what is found among our contemporaries. But the terms "intensity" and "scope" must be understood in their strongest and most dramatic sense. For man is the final product of a decision made "at the beginnings of Time" : the decision to kill in order to live. In short, the hominians succeeded in outstripping their ancestors by becoming flesh-eaters. For some two million years, the Paleanthropians lived by hunting; fruits, roots, mollusks, and so on, gathered by the women and children, did not suffice to insure the survival of the species. Hunting determined the division of labor in accordance with sex, thus reinforcing" hominization"; for among the carnivora, and in the entire animal world, no such difference exists.
2. See Karl Narr, "Approaches to the Social Life of Earliest Man," pp. 605 ff.



The" opaqueness" ofprehistoric documents 5
But the ceaseless pursuit and killing of game ended by creating a unique system of relationships between the hunter and the slain animals. We shall return to this problem. For the moment, we merely state that the "mystical solidarity" between the hunter and his victims is revealed by the mere act of killing: the shed blood is similar in every respect to human blood. In the last analysis, this "mystical solidarity" with the game reveals the kinship between human societies and the animal world. To kill the hunted beast or, later, the domestic animal is equivalent to a "sacrifice" in which the victims are interchangeable.3 We must add that all these concepts came into existence during the last phases of the process ofhominization. They are still active-altered, revalorized, camouflagedmillennia after the disappearance of the Paleolithic civilizations.
2. The" opaqueness" of prehistoric documents
If the Paleanthropians are regarded as complete men, it follows that they also possessed a certain number of beliefs and practiced certain rites. For, as we stated before, the experience of the sacred constitutes an element in the structure of consciousness. In other words, if the question of the religiosity or nonreligiosity of prehistoric men is raised, it falls to the defenders of nonreligiosity to adduce proofs in support of their hypothesis. Probably the theory of the nonreligiosity of the Paleanthropians was conceived and generally accepted during the heyday of evolutionism, when similarities to the primates had just been discovered. But a misconception is involved here, for what matters is not the anatomico-osteological structure of the Paleanthropians (which is similar, to be sure, to that of the primates) but their works; and these demonstrate the activity of an intelligence that cannot be defined otherwise than as "human." But if today there is agreement on the fact that the Paleanthropians had a religion, in practice it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine what its content was. The investigators, however, have not cried defeat; for there remain a certain number oftestimonial "documents" for the life of the Paleanthropians, and it is hoped that their religious
3. This extremely archaic idea still survived into Mediterranean antiquity; not only were animals substituted for human victims (a custom universally disseminated), but men were sacrificed in the place of animals. See WaIter Burkert, Homo Necans, p. 29, n. 34.



6 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
meaning will one day be deciphered. In other words, it is hoped that these "documents" can constitute a "language," just as, thanks to the genius of Freud, the creations of the unconscious, which until his time were regarded as absurd or meaningless-dreams, waking dreams, phantasms, and so on-have revealed the existence of a language that is extremely precious for a knowledge of man. These documents are, in fact, comparatively numerous, but they are" opaque" and not very various: human bones, especially skulls, stone tools, pigments (most abundantly red ocher, hematite), various objects found in burials. It is only from the late Paleolithic that we have rock paintings and engravings, painted pebbles, and bone and stone statuettes. In certain cases (burials, works of art) and within the limits that we shall examine, there is at least the certainty of a religious intention, but the majority of the documents from before the Aurignacian (30,000 B.c.)-that is, tools-reveal nothing beyond their utilitarian value. Yet it is inconceivable that tools were not charged with a certain sacrality and did not inspire numerous mythological episodes. The first technological discoveries-the transformation of stone into instruments for attack and defense, the mastery over fire-not only insured the survival and development of the human species; they also produced a universe of mythico-religious values and inspired and fed the creative imagination. It is enough to examine the role of tools in the religious life and mythology of the primitives who still remain at the hunting and fishing stage. The magico-religious value of a weapon-be it made of wood or stone or metal-still survives among the rural populations of Europe, and not only in their folklore. We shall not here consider the kratophanies and hierophanies of stone, of rocks, of pebbles; the reader will find examples of these in a chapter of our Patterns in Comparative Religion.
It is, above all, mastery over distance, gained by the projectile weapon, which gave rise to countless beliefs, myths, and legends. We need only think of the mythologies built up around lances that pierce the vault of the sky and thus make an ascent to heaven possible, of arrows that fly through clouds, transfix demons, or form a chain reaching to heaven, and so on. It is necessary to cite at least some of the beliefs and mythologies that surround tools and implementsand especially weapons-in order better to estimate all that the worked stones ofthe Paleanthropians can no longer communicate to us.



The" opaqueness" ofprehistoric documents 7
The semantic opaqueness of these prehistoric documents is not peculiar to them. Every document, even of our own time, is spiritually opaque as long as it has not been successfully deciphered by being integrated into a system of meanings. A tool, be it prehistoric or contemporary, can reveal only its technological intention; all that its producer or its owners thought, felt, dreamed, hoped in relation to it escapes us. But we must at least try to imagine the nonmaterial values of prehistoric tools. Otherwise, this semantic opaqueness may well force us to entertain a completely erroneous conception of the history of culture. We are in danger, for example, of confusing the appearance of a belief with the date at which it is clearly documented for the first time. 4 When, in the age of metals, certain traditions refer to craft secrets in respect to mining, metallurgy, and the making of weapons, it would be rash to believe that we are in the presence of an unprecedented invention, for these traditions continue, at least in part, an inheritance from the Stone Age. For some two million years, the Paleanthropians lived chiefly by hunting, fishing, and gathering. But the first archeological indications in respect to the religious universe of the Paleolithic hunter go back only to Franco-Cantabrian rock art (30,000 B.C.). What is more, if we examine the religious beliefs and behavior of contemporary hunting peoples, we realize the almost complete impossibility of proving the existence or the absence of similar beliefs among the Paleanthropians. Primitive hunters 5 regard animals as similar to men but endowed with supernatural powers; they believe that a man can change into an animal and vice versa; that the souls of the dead can enter animals; finally, that mysterious relations exist between a certain person and a certain animal (this used to be termed" nagualism "). As for the supernatural beings documented in the religions of hunting peoples, we find that they are of various kinds: theriomorphic companions or guardian spirits-divinities of the type Supreme Being-Lord of Wild Beasts-which protect both the game and the hunters; spirits of the bush; and spirits of the different species of animals. In addition, certain patterns of religious behavior are peculiar to
4. Strictly applied, this method would have led to dating the German folktales at 1812-22, the date of their publication by the brothers Grimm. 5. For the sake of simplicity, we use the synthetic account by J. Haeckel, "Jager und Jagdriten," Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3d ed. (1959), vol. 3,cols. 511-13.



8 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
hunting civilizations. For example, killing the animal constitutes a ritual, which implies the belief that the Lord of Wild Beasts takes care that the hunter kills only what he needs as food and that food is not wasted. Then, too, the bones, especially the skull, have a marked ritual value (probably because of the belief that they contain the " soul" or the" life" ofthe animal and that it is from the skeleton that the Lord of Wild Beasts will cause a new flesh to grow); this is why the skull and the long bones are exposed on branches or on high places. Finally, among certain peoples the soul of the slain animal is sent to its spiritual home (cf. the "bear festival" among the Ainus and the Giliaks); the custom of offering the Supreme Beings a piece of each slain animal (Pygmies, Philippine Negritos, and others) or the skull and the long bones (Samoyeds and others) also exists; and among certain Sudanese peoples the young man, after bringing down his first game animal, smears the walls of a cave with its blood. How many of these beliefs and ceremonies can be identified in the archeological documents in our possession? At most, the offerings of skulls and long bones. The richness and complexity of the religious ideology of hunting peoples must never be underestimated-and likewise the almost complete impossibility of proving or denying its existence among the Paleanthropians. As has often been said: beliefs and ideas cannot be fossilized. Hence certain scholars have preferred to say nothing about the ideas and beliefs of the Paleanthropians, instead of reconstructing them by the help of comparisons with the hunting civilizations. This radical methodological position is not without its dangers. To leave an immense part of the history of the human mind a blank runs the risk of encouraging the idea that during all those millennia the activity of the mind was confined to the preservation and transmission of technology. Such an opinion is not only erroneous, it is fatal to a knowledge of man. Homo faber was at the same time Homo /udens, sapiens, and religiosus. Since we cannot reconstruct his religious beliefs and practices, we must at least point out certain analogies that can illuminate them, if only indirectly.
3. Symbolic meanings of burials
The earliest and most numerous" documents" are, obviously, bones. From the Mousterian (70,000-50,000 B.C.), we can speak with



Symbolic meanings of burials 9
certainty of burials. But skulls and lower mandibles have been found at much earlier sites, for example at Choukoutien (at a level datable at 400,000-300,000 B.C.), and their presence has raised problems. Since there is no question of burials here, the preservation of these skulls could be explained as due to religious reasons. The Abbe Breuil and Wilhelm Schmidt have referred to the custom, documented among the Australians and other primitive peoples,6 of preserving the skulls of dead relatives and carrying them along when the tribe travels. Though credible, the hypothesis has not been accepted by most scholars. The same facts have also been interpreted as proof of cannibalism, whether ritual or profane. It is in this way that A. C. Blane has explained the mutilation of a Neanderthal skull found in a cave at Monte Circeo: the man would have been killed by a blow that broke his right eye-socket and the hole would later have been enlarged so that the brain could be extracted through it and eaten ritually. But this explanation has not been unanimously accepted either. 7 Belief in a survival after death seems to be demonstrated, from the earliest times, by the use of red ocher as a ritual substitute for blood, hence as a symbol of life. The custom of dusting corpses with ocher is universally disseminated in both time and space, from Choukoutien to the western shores of Europe, in Africa as far as the Cape of Good Hope, in Australia, in Tasmania, in America as far as Tierra del Fuego. As to the religious meaning of burials, it has been the subject of vigorous controversy. There can be no doubt that the burial of the dead should have a justification-but which one? To begin with, it must not be forgotten that "pure and simple abandonment of the corpse in some thicket, dismemberment, leaving it to be devoured by birds, instant flight from the habitation, leaving the corpse inside it, did not signify the absence of ideas of survival." 8 A fortiori, belief in survival is confirmed by burials; otherwise there would be no understanding the effort expended in interring the body. This survival

could be purely spiritual, that is, conceived as a postexistence of the soul, a belief corroborated by the appearance of the dead in dreams. But certain burials can equally well be interpreted as a precaution against the possible return of the deceased; in these cases the corpses were bent and perhaps tied. On the other hand, nothing makes it impossible that the bent position ofthe dead body, far from expressing fear of "living corpses" (a fear documented among certain peoples), on the contrary signifies the hope of a rebirth; for we know of a number of cases of intentional burial in the fetal position. Among the best examples of burials with a magico-religious signification we will mention the one at Teshik Tash, in Uzbekistan (a child surrounded by an arrangement of ibex horns); the one at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, in Correze (several flint tools and some pieces of red ocher 9 were found in the excavation in which the body lay); and the one at Farrassie, in Dordogne (several grave mounds, with deposits of flint tools). The cemetery in a cave on Mount Carmel, with ten burials, should be added. The authenticity and the meaning of food offerings or objects placed in graves are still the subject of discussion; the most familiar example is that of the woman's skull at Mas-d'Azil, fitted with artificial eyes and placed on the lower jaw and antler of a reindeer.10 During the Upper Paleolithic, the practice of inhumation appears to have become general. Corpses sprinkled with red ocher are buried in graves in which a certain number of objects intended for personal adornment (shells, pendants, necklaces) have been found. It is probable that the animal skulls and bones discovered near graves are the remains of ritual feasts, if not of offerings. Leroi-Gourhan holds that "funerary chattels," that is, the personal objects of the deceased, are "very questionable" (Les religions de fa prehistoire, p. 62). The problem is important, for the presence of such objects implies not only belief in a personal survival but also the certainty that the
9. Recent archeological discoveries have shown that hematite was extracted from a mine in Swaziland 29,000 years ago and, in Rhodesia, 43,000 years ago. The extraction of hematite from these African mines continued for millennia. The discovery of a similar operation near Lake Balaton, in Hungary, occurring about 24,000 B.C., illustrates the technical capabilities of the Paleolithics and the extent of their communications. See R. A. Dart, "The Multimillennial
Prehistory of Ochre Mining" and "The Birth of Symbology," pp. 21 ff. 10. According to Leroi-Gourhan, this find represents a "heap of culinary detritus on which a probably secularized and certainly displaced human relic lay" (p. 57).



Symbolic meanings of burials 11
deceased will continue his particular activity in the other world. Similar ideas are abundantly documented, and on various levels of culture. In any case, Leroi-Gourhan (p. 63) recognizes the auchenticity of an Aurignacian grave in Liguria, where the skeleton is accompanied by four of those mysterious objects called batons de commandement. Hence at least certain graves undoubtedly indicate belief in a postmortem continuation of a particular activity.u To sum up, we may conclude that the burials confirm the belief in survival (already indicated by the use of red ocher) and furnish some additional details: burials oriented toward the East, showing an intention to connect the fate of the soul with the course of the sun, hence the hope of a rebirth, that is, of a postexistence in another world; belief in the continuation of a specific activity; certain funeral rites, indicated by offerings of objects of personal adornment and by the remains ofmeals. But an examination of burial as practiced by an archaic people of our own time is enough to demonstrate the richness and depth of the religious symbolism implied in a ceremony that appears to be so simple. Reichel-Dolmatoff has given a detailed description of a contemporary (1966) burial of a girl among the Kogi Indians, a tribe speaking the Chibcha language and inhabiting the Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria in Colombia.12 After choosing the site for the grave, the shaman (mama) performs a series of ritual gestures and declares: "Here is the village of Death; here is the ceremonial house of Death; here is the womb. I will open the house. The house is shut, and I will open it." After this he announces, "The house is open," shows the men the place where they are to dig the grave, and withdraws. The dead girl is wrapped in white cloth, and her father sews the shroud. During all this time her mother and grandmother chant a slow, almost wordless song. Small green stones, shells of shellfish, and the shell of a gastropod are placed in the bottom of the grave. Then the shaman tries to lift the body, giving the impression that it is too heavy; he does not succeed until the ninth attempt. The body is laid with its head toward the East, and "the house is closed," that is, the excavation is filled up. Other ritual movements around the grave
11. It should be noted that other scholars hold that the number of authentic "documents" found in graves is much larger. 12. C. Reichel-Dolmatoff, "Notas sobre el simbolismo religioso de los Indios de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria," Razon y Fabula, Revista de la Universidad de los Andes, no. 1 (1967), pp. 55-72.



12 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
follow, and finally all withdraw. The ceremony has continued for two hours. As Reichel-Dolmatoff observes, a future archeologist, excavating the grave, will find only a skeleton with its head toward the East and some stones and shells. The rites, and especially the implied religious ideology, are no longer recoverable on the basis of these remains.13 In addition, the symbolism will remain inaccessible even to a contemporary observer who does not know the religion of the Kogi. For, as Reichel-Dolmatoff writes, what is involved is verbalization of the cemetery as "village of Death" and "ceremonial house of Death," and verbalization of the grave as "house" and "womb" (which explains the fetal position of the corpse, laid on its left side), followed by verbalization of the offerings as "food for Death," and by the ritual of the" opening" and" closing" of the" house-womb." A final purification by a ritual circumvallation completes the ceremony. On the other hand, the Kogi identify the world-womb of the Universal Mother-with each village, each cult house, each habitation, and each grave. When the shaman lifts the corpse nine times, he indicates the return of the body to the fetal state by going through the nine months of gestation in reverse order. And since the grave is assimilated to the world, the funerary offerings acquire a cosmic meaning. In addition, the offerings, "food for Death," also have a sexual meaning (in the myths, dreams, and marriage regulations of the Kogi the act of eating symbolizes the sexual act) and consequently constitute a "semen" that fertilizes the Mother. The shellfish shells carry a quite complex symbolism, which is not only sexual: they represent the living members of the family. On the other hand, the gastropod shell symbolizes the dead girl's "husband," for if it is not present in the grave, the girl, as soon as she reaches the other world, "will demand a husband," and this will cause the death of a young man of the tribe.14 Here we end our analysis of the religious symbolism contained in a Kogi burial. But it is important to emphasize that, approached solely on the archeological level, this symbolism is as inaccessible to us as that of a Paleolithic interment. It is the particular modality of

The controversy concerning deposits of bones 13
archeological documents that limits and impoverishes the" messages" that they can transmit. This fact must always be kept in mind when we are confronted by the poverty and opaqueness of our sources.
4. The controversy concerning deposits of bones
Deposits of bones of cave bears, discovered in the Alps and the surrounding regions, constitute the most numerous, but also the most hotly debated, "documents" concerning the religious ideas of the last interglacial period. In the Drachenloch cave (Switzerland) Emil Bachler found deposits of bones, principally of skulls and long bones; they were grouped together and placed along the cave wall, or in natural niches in the rock, or in a sort of stone coffer. From 1923 to 1925, Bachler explored another cave, the Wildenmannlisloch; here he found several bear skulls without mandibles, with long bones placed among them. Similar discoveries were made by other prehistorians in various caves in the Alps; the most important were in the Drachenhoetli, in Styria, and in the Petershoehle, in Franconia, where K. Hoermann discovered bear skulls in niches 1.20 meters above the cave floor. Similarly, in 1950, K. Ehrenberg found in the Salzofenhoehle (Austrian Alps) three bear skulls in natural niches in the cave wall and associated with long bones oriented from East to West. Since these deposits appeared to be intentional, scholars set themselves to decipher their meaning. A. Gahs compared them to the offering of first fruits (Primitialopfer) made by certain Arctic peoples to a supreme being. This consisted in exposing the skull and long bones of the slain animal on platforms; the divinity was offered the animal's brain and marrow, that is, the parts most relished by the hunter. This interpretation was accepted by Wilhelm Schmidt and W. Koppers, among others; for these ethnologists, here was proof that the cave-bear hunters of the last interglacial period believed in a Supreme Being or a Lord of Wild Beasts. Other authors compared the deposits of skulls with the bear cult as it is-or was, until the nineteenth century-practiced in the Northern Hemisphere. This cult involves preserving the skull and long bones of the slain bear so that the Lord of Wild Beasts can resuscitate it the following year. Karl Meuli saw in it only a particular form of the "interment of animals," which he regarded as the earliest of hunting rites. For the



14 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
Swiss scholar, the rite showed a direct relation between hunter and game; the former interred the remains of the latter in order to permit its reincarnation. No divine being was implied. All these interpretations were questioned by a scholar from Basel, F. E. Koby, according to whom many" deposits" of skulls result from chance and from the bears themselves moving and scratching among the bones. Leroi-Gourhan has declared that he is in complete agreement with this radical critique: the skulls contained in stone "coffers," grouped along the walls, or suspended in niches and surrounded by long bones are explained by geological facts and by the behavior of the bears themselves (Les religions de fa prehistoire, pp. 31 ff.). This critique of the intentionality of the deposits appears to be convincing, all the more so since the earliest excavations of the caves left much to be desired; nevertheless, it is surprising that the same type of deposit should be found in a number of caves, especially in niches more than a meter above the cave floor. In addition, LeroiGourhan recognizes that "rehandling by man is probable in some instances" (p. 31). In any case, the interpretation of deposits as offerings to supreme beings has been discarded, even by the supporters of Wilhelm Schmidt and W. Koppers. In a recent study of sacrifices among the Paleanthropians, Johannes Maringer came to the following conclusions: (1) on the level of the Lower Paleolithic (Torralba, Choukoutien, Lehringen), sacrifices are not documented; (2) the documents from the Middle Paleolithic (Drachenloch, Petershoehle, etc.) can be interpreted in various ways, but their religious character (i.e., as sacrifices to supernatural beings) is not evident; (3) it is not until the Upper Paleolithic (Willendorf, Meiendorf, Stellmoor, Montespan, etc.) that it is possible to speak, "with more or less certainty," of sacrifices. 15 As might be expected, the investigator is confronted either by the absence of irrefutable documents or by the semantic opaqueness of those documents whose authenticity appears to be certain. The spiritual activity of the Paleanthropians-like that, be it added, of the "primitives" of our day-left fragile traces. To give only one example, the arguments adduced by Koby and Leroi-Gourhan can equaUy well be used to invalidate their own conclusions: the geological facts and the behavior of cave bears suffice to explain the absence of
15. J. Maringer, "Die Opfer der paliiolithischen Menschen," p. 271.



The controversy concerning deposits of bones 15
ritual deposits. As to the semantic opacity of the bone deposits whose authenticity is certain, parallels are found among contemporary Arctic hunters. In itself, the deposit is simply the expression of a magico-religious intentionality; the particular meanings of the act become accessible to us only through the information communicated by members of the respective societies. We then learn whether the skulls and long bones represent offerings to a Supreme Being or a Lord of Wild Beasts, or whether, on the contrary, they are preserved in the hope that they will be covered with flesh again. Even this last belief can be interpreted in various ways: the animal is reborn by virtue either of the Lord of Wild Beasts or of the soul that resides in its bones or, finally, by virtue of the fact that the hunter has provided it with a burial (to keep its bones from being devoured by dogs). We must always take into consideration the multiplicity of possible interpretations of a document whose magico-religious intentionality is probable. On the other hand, we must not forget that, whatever the difference between the Arctic hunters and the Paleolithics may be, they all share the same economy and very probably the same religious ideology, both of which are specific characteristics of hunting civilizations. Hence, comparison of prehistoric documents with ethnological facts is justified. It has been proposed to interpret from this point of view the discovery in Silesia of the fossil skull of a young brown bear belonging to a level of the early Aurignacian; while the incisors and canines had been sawed or filed, the molars were still in excellent condition. W. Koppers has referred this find to the bear festival among the Giliaks of the island of Sakhalin and the Ainus of the island of Yezo; here, before it is slaughtered, the canines and incisors of the young bear are cut with a sort of saw, so that it can no longer wound the participants in the ceremony.16 And since, during the same ceremony, the children shoot showers of arrows into the bound animal, the same interpretation has been proposed for certain parietal engravings in the Trois Freres cave, which show bears struck by arrows and stones and apparently vomiting a stream of blood.17 But such scenes can be interpreted in various ways.
16. This is an extremely important ritual: the bear's soul is sent as a messenger from men to the guardian divinity, so that the latter will insure the success of future hunts.

16 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
The importance of an archaic religious idea is likewise confirmed by its ability to survive into later periods. Thus the belief that an animal can be reborn from its bones is found in a considerable number of cultures.IS That is why it is forbidden to break the bones of animals whose flesh has been eaten. This is an idea which is proper to the civilizations of hunters and herders but which has survived in more complex religions and mythologies. A well-known example is that of Thor's goats, which had their throats cut and were eaten in the evening but which the god resuscitated from their bones the next day (Gylfaginning, chap. 26). Equally well known is a vision seen by Ezekiel (37:1-8 fr.): the prophet was transported into a "valley full of bones" and, obeying the Lord's command, he spoke to them: "Dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this to these bones: I am now going to make the breath enter you, and you will live.... There was a noise, a sound of clattering; and the bones joined together. I looked, and saw that they were covered with sinews; flesh was growing on them."19
5. Rock paintings: Images or symbols?
The most important and most numerous figurative documents have been provided by the exploration of decorated caves. These treasures of Paleolithic art are disseminated over a comparatively restricted territory, between the Urals and the Atlantic. Objects of mobiliary art have been found in much of western and central Europe and in Russia as far as the Don. But parietal art is confined to Spain, France, and southern Italy (with the exception of a painted cave in the Urals, discovered in 1961). What strikes us first of all, as LeroiGourhan remarks, is the" extraordinary unity of the artistic content: the apparent import of the images seems not to have varied from 30,000 B.C. to 9000 B.C. and remains the same in Asturias and on the Don." 20 According to Leroi-Gourhan (p. 84), we here have a

Rock paintings: Images or symbols? 17
dissemination by contact of a single ideological system-notably, the system that marks the" religion of the caves." 21 Since the paintings are found at a considerable distance from the entrance, investigators agree in regarding the caves as a sort of sanctuary. Besides, many of these caves were uninhabitable, and difficulties of access reinforced their numinous character. To reach the decorated walls it is necessary to proceed for hundreds of meters, as in the case of the Niaux and Trois Freres caves. The Cabarets cave is a real labyrinth, a journey through which takes several hours. At Lascaux, access to the lower gallery, which contains one of the masterpieces of Paleolithic art, is obtained by descending a rope ladder through a shaft 6.30 meters deep. The intentionality of these painted or engraved works seems to be beyond doubt. To interpret them, the majority of investigators appealed to ethnological parallels. Certain comparisons were not convincing, especially when an insistent attempt was made to "complete" the Paleolithic document in order to increase its likeness to some ethnological analogue. But such risky explanations impugn only their authors, not the method which they claimed to use. The bears, lions, and other wild animals riddled with arrows, or the clay figures found in the Montespan cave and representing a bear and several lions pierced by deep round holes, have been interpreted as proofs of "hunting magic." 22 The hypothesis is plausible, but some of these works could as well be interpreted as the reactualization of a primordial hunt. It is also probable that rites were performed in the deepest parts of the "sanctuaries," perhaps before a hunting expedition or on the occasion of what could be termed the" initiation" of adolescents.23 A scene in the Trois Freres cave has been
21. Leroi-Gourhan has established the chronology and morphology of Paleolithic works of art, which he divides into five epochs, beginning with the Prefigurative period (50,000 B.C.), followed by the Primitive period (30,000 B.C.), in which strongly stylized figures appear; the Archaic period (ca. 20,00015,000 B.C.), characterized by great technical mastery; the Classic period (during the Magdalenian, ca. 15,000-11,000 B.C.), with a realism of forms that is carried very far, only to decline and end in the Late period (ca. 10,000 B.C.). 22. Begouen and Casteret have reconstructed a whole ritual on the basis of the Montespan figure of a bear modeled in clay; see the critique of this reconstruction by P. Graziosi, Palaeolithic Art, p. 152, and cf. Peter J. Ucko and Andre Rosenfeld, Paleolithic Cave Art, pp. 188-89, for a discussion of Begouen and Casteret's publications. 23. Charet has interpreted the prints of human feet in the Tuc d'Aubert cave as a proof of the initiation of boys; the hypothesis has been accepted by



18 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
explained as representing a dancer masked as a bison and playing an instrument that might be a flute. The interpretation seems convincing, since we know, in Paleolithic art, some fifty-five representations of men dressed in skins, often in a dancing posture.24 In addition, this is a characteristic ritual behavior of contemporary hunting peoples. The Abbe Breuil has given celebrity to the" Great Magician" of the Trois Freres cave, an engraving 75 centimeters high cut into the wall. Breuil's drawing of it shows a figure with the head of a stag bearing large antlers, but with the face of an owl, the ears of a wolf, and the beard of a chamois. Its arms end in bear paws, and it has a long horse's tail. Only the lower limbs, the sex, and the dancing posture indicate that the figure is that of a human being. But recent photographs taken in the cave do not show all the elements carefully described by Breuil.25 It is possible that certain details have been damaged since the discovery of the engraving (for example, the second antler), but it is not impossible that the Abbe Breuil made his sketch incorrectly. As it appears in recent photographs, the "Great Magician" is less impressive. However, the figure can be interpreted as a Lord of Wild Beasts or as a sorcerer personifying him. In addition, a slate slab recently discovered at Lourdes shows a man wrapped in a deerskin, with a horse's tail and with his head surmounted by antlers. No less celebrated, and no less the subject of controversy, is the famous composition recently discovered at Lascaux, in a lower gallery to which access is extremely difficult. It shows a wounded bison thrusting its horns toward a man who is apparently dead and who lies on the ground; his weapon, a sort of pike with a hook, is pressed against the animal's belly; near the man (whose head ends in a beak) is a bird on a perch. The scene has generally been interpreted as representing a hunting accident. In 1950 Horst Kirchner proposed seeing in it a shamanic seance; in this case, the man would not be dead but in a trance before the sacrificed bison, while his soul would be traveling in the beyond. The perched bird, a motif typical of Siberian shamanism, would be his guardian spirit. According to Kirchner, the seance was undertaken to enable the shaman to travel,
some scholars but is rejected by Ucko and Rosenfeld, Paleolithic Cave Art, pp. 177-78.

in ecstasy, into the presence of the gods to ask for their blessing, that is, for success in the hunt. The same author considers that the mysterious batons de commandement are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, it would mean that the Paleolithic sorcerers used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.26 Kirchner's explanation has been disputed, and we do not consider ourselves competent to pronounce on it. However, the existence of a certain type of shamanism during the Paleolithic period seems to be certain. On the one hand, shamanism still dominates the religious ideology of hunters and pastoralists in our day. On the other hand, the ecstatic experience as such, as an original phenomenon, is a constitutive element of the human condition; it is impossible to imagine a period in which man did not have dreams and waking reveries and did not enter into "trance"-a loss of consciousness that was interpreted as the soul's traveling into the beyond. What was modified and changed with the different forms of culture and religion was the interpretation and evaluation of the ecstatic experience. Since the spiritual universe of the Paleolithics was dominated by the mystical relations between man and animal, it is not difficult to divine the functions of a specialist in ecstasy. The so-called X-ray drawings, that is, drawings showing the skeleton and internal organs of the animal, have also been referred to shamanism. These drawings, documented in France during the Magdalenian (13,000-6000 B.C.) and in Norway between 6000 and 2000 B.C., are also found in eastern Siberia, among the Eskimos, in America (among the Ojibways, the Pueblos, and others), but also in India, Malaysia, New Guinea, and northwestern Australia.27 It is an art specifically characteristic of hunting cultures, but the religious ideology with which it is saturated is shamanic. For it is only the shaman who, by virtue of his supernatural vision, is able to "see his own skeleton." 28 In other words, he is able to penetrate even into the source of animal life, the bony element. That we here have an experience fundamental for a certain type of mystic is proved, among other things, by the fact that it is still cultivated in Tibetan Buddhism.

20 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
6. The presence of woman
The discovery of feminine representations in the last Ice Age has raised problems that are still being discussed. Their distribution is quite extensive, from southwestern France to Lake Baikal in Siberia, and from northern Italy to the Rhine. The statuettes, which range from 5 to 25 centimeters in height, are carved in stone, bone, and ivory. They have been called, quite unjustifiably, "Venuses," the most celebrated being the Venuses of Lespuges, Willendorf (Austria), and Laussel (Dordogne).29 However, especially because of the scrupulousness of the excavations, the most instructive examples are the ones discovered at Gagarino and Mezine in the Ukraine. They come from levels of habitation and hence seem to be related to domestic religion. Gagarino has yielded, close to the walls of the habitation, six figurines carved from bones of the mammoth. They are carved summarily, with an abdomen of exaggerated size and a head without features. The examples discovered at Mezine are strongly stylized; some of them can be interpreted as female forms reduced to geometric elements (this type is documented elsewhere in central Europe); others very probably represent birds. The figurines are decorated with various geometric designs, among others the swastika. To explain their possible religious function, Hancar has cited the fact that certain hunting tribes of northern Asia make small anthropomorphic sculptures called dzuli. In the tribes in which the dzuli are female, these "idols" represent the mythical ancestress from whom all members of the tribe are presumed to descend; they protect the tribal families and habitations, and upon the return from great hunts they are given offerings of wheat flour and fat. Still more significant is Gerasimov's discovery, at Mal'ta, in Siberia, of a "village" whose rectangular houses were divided into two halves, the right half reserved for men (only objects of masculine use were found), and the left half belonging to the women; the female statuettes come only from this section. Their homologues in the male quarters represent birds, but some of them have been interpreted as phalluses.30

The presence of woman 21
It is impossible to determine the religious function of these figurines. Presumably they in some sort represent feminine sacrality and hence the magico-religious powers of the goddesses. The "mystery" constituted by woman's particular mode of existence has played an important part in numerous religions, both primitive and historical. We owe it to Leroi-Gourhan to have illuminated the central function of the polarity masculine/feminine in the ensemble of Paleolithic art, i.e., rock paintings and reliefs, stone statuettes or slabs. He has further been able to show the unity of this symbolic language, from the Franco-Cantabrian region to Siberia. By making use of topographical and statistical. analysis, Leroi-Gourhan has concluded that the figures (forms, faces, etc.) and the signs are interchangeable; for example, the image of a bison has the same (" female") value as "wounds" or other geometrical signs. He then observed that there is a pairing of male-female values, for example, bison (female) and horse (male). Deciphered in the light of this symbolism, the cave proves to be a world both organized and laden with meanings. For Leroi-Gourhan, there is no doubt that the cave is a sanctuary and that the stone slabs and the figurines constitute portable sanctuaries possessing the same symbolic structure as the decorated caves. However, the same author admits that the synthesis he believes he has reconstructed does not teach us the language of Paleolithic religion. His method forbids him to recognize the" events" suggested in certain rock paintings. In the celebrated "scene" at Lascaux, interpreted by other investigators as a hunting accident or a shamanic seance, Leroi-Gourhan sees only a bird belonging to a certain "topographical group" and "symbolically equivalent to the man or the rhinoceros which are in fact its neighbors on the wall" (Les religions de la prehistoire, p. 148). Except for the pairing of symbols of different sexual values (which perhaps expresses the religious importance attributed to this complementarity), all that LeroiGourhan can put forward is that "the representations cover an extremely complex and rich system, a system far richer and more complex than had been previously imagined" (p. 151). Leroi-Gourhan's theory has been criticized from various points of view. He has been especially reproached with a certain inconsistency in his "readings" of figures and signs and with the fact that he did not connect the rites performed in the caves with his newly established



22 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
symbolic system.31 However this may be, Leroi-Gourhan's contribution is important: he has demonstrated the stylistic and ideological unity of Paleolithic art and has illuminated the complementarity of the religious values camouflaged under the signs "male" and "female." An analogous symbolism characterized the village of Mal'ta, with its two completely separate halves destined for the two sexes. Systems implying the complementarity of the two sexual and cosmological principles still abound in primitive societies, and we shall also find them in the archaic religions. It is probable that this principle of complementarity was called upon both to organize the world and to explain the mystery of its periodical creation and regeneration.
7. Rites, thought, and imagination among the Paleolithic hunters
The recent discoveries of paleontology have it in common that they continually push the beginnings of man and of culture backward in time. Man proves to be more ancient and his psychomental activity more complex than they were thought to be a few decades ago. Alexander Marshak has recently been able to demonstrate the existence, in the Upper Paleolithic, of a symbolic system of temporal notations, based on observation of the moon's phases. These notations, which the author terms "time-factored," that is, accumulated continuously over a long period, permit the supposition that certain seasonal or periodic ceremonies were fixed long in advance, as is the case in our day among Siberians and North American Indians. This system of notations remained in force for more than 25,000 years, from the early Aurignacian to the late Magdalenian. According to Marshak, writing, arithmetic, and the calendar properly speaking, which make their appearance in the first civilizations, are probably connected with the symbolism with which the system of notations used during the Paleolithic is impregnated.32

of plant life (see Marshak, Roots, pp. 172 ff., and his" Le baton de commande
ment de Montgaudier (Charente)," pp. 329 ff.



Rites, thought, and imagination 23
Whatever may be thought of Marshak's general theory concerning the development of civilization, the fact remains that the lunar cycle was analyzed, memorized, and used for practical purposes some 15,000 years before the discovery of agriculture. This makes more comprehensible the considerable role of the moon in archaic mythologies, and especially the fact that lunar symbolism was integrated into a single system comprising such different realities as woman, the waters, vegetation, the serpent, fertility, death, "rebirth," etc. 33 From analyzing the meanders engraved on objects or painted on the walls of caves, Marshak concludes that these designs constitute a system because they present a succession and express an intentionality. This structure is already documented in the designs engraved on a bone excavated at Pech de rAze (Dordogne) and belonging to the Acheulian level (ca. 135,000 B.C.), that is, at least 100,000 years before the meanders of the Upper Paleolithic. What is more, the meanders are represented around and upon designs of animals, indicating a certain ritual ("individual act of participation," as Marshak terms it). It is difficult to determine their meaning, but from a certain moment on (for example, the design at Petersfeld, Baden), the meanders are presented in "running angles" and are accompanied by fish. In this case, the aquatic symbolism is obvious. But, according to the author, we are not presented with a simple image of water; the countless traces left by fingers and various tools denote an "individual act of participation" in which aquatic symbolism or mythology played a part.34 Such analyses confirm the ritual function of Paleolithic signs and figures. It now seems evident that these images and symbols refer to certain" stories," that is, to events related to the seasons, the habits of game, sexuality, death, the mysterious powers of certain supernatural beings and certain persons (" specialists in the sacred"). We may regard the Paleolithic representations as a code that signifies the symbolic (hence magico-religious) value of the images and at the same time their function in the ceremonies connected with various "stories." But the "systems" in which the different symbols take

24 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
their place permit us at least to divine their importance in the magicoreligious practices of the Paleolithics-and the more so because a number of these" systems" are shared by the hunting societies. As we observed above (§ 4), it is permissible to reconstruct certain aspects of the religions of prehistory by considering the rites and beliefs typical of primitive hunters. It is not simply a matter of ethnographic parallels, a method which has been used, more or less successfully, by all investigators except Leroi-Gourhan and LamingEmperair.35 But, taking into consideration all the differences that separate a prehistoric from a primitive culture, it is still possible to circumscribe certain fundamental configurations. For a number of archaic civilizations based on hunting, fishing, and gathering have survived until recent times on the margin of the ecumene (in Tierra del Fuego, in Africa among the Hottentots and the Bushmen, in the Arctic, in Australia, etc.) or in the great tropical forests (the Bambuti Pygmies, etc.). Despite influences from the neighboring agricultural civilizations (at least in certain cases), the original structures were still intact at the end of the nineteenth century. These civilizations, arrested at a stage similar to the Upper Paleolithic, thus constitute a sort of living fossils. 36 Of course, there is no attempt to transpose the religious practices and mythologies of the "primitives" to the men of the Old Stone Age. However, as we have already observed, ecstasy of the shamanic type appears to be documented in the Paleolithic. This implies, on the one hand, belief in a "soul," able to leave the body and travel freely through the world, and, on the other hand, the conviction that, during such a journey, the soul can meet certain superhuman beings and ask them for help or a blessing. The shamanic ecstasy also implies the possibility of possessing, that is, entering, the bodies of
35. Their failure to use this method has provoked criticism from Ucko (Paleolithic Cave Art, pp. 140 ff.), who, after citing some examples in which ethnographic comparison has illuminated certain aspects of prehistoric societies (pp. 151 ff.), offers an analysis of Paleolithic rock art in the light of Australian and African facts (pp. 191 ff.). 36. The concept of "living fossils" has been successfully employed in several branches of biology, especially in speleology. The troglobionts that today inhabit caves belong to a fauna that has long since been transcended. "They are veritable living fossils and often represent very ancient stages in the history of life-Tertiary or even Secondary" (Dr. Racovitza). Thus caves preserve an archaic fauna, of great importance for an understanding of the primitive zoomorphic groups that are not/ossilizable.



Rites, thought, and imagination 25
human beings, and also of being possessed by the soul of a dead person or by a spirit or a god. To recall another example, the separation of the sexes (§6) permits us to suppose the existence of secret rites in which only men may take part and that are performed before hunting expeditions. Similar rites are the prerogative of groups of adults similar to the "men's societies" (Miinnerbunde); the" secrets" are revealed to adolescents by means of initiation rites. Some authors consider that they have found proof of such an initiation in the Montespan cave, but this interpretation has been contested. However, the archaism of initiation rites is beyond doubt. The analogies between a number of ceremonies documented at the farthest regions of the ecumene (Australia, South and North America)37 bear witness to a common tradition already developed during the Paleolithic. As for the" circular dance" at Montespan (whatever interpretation is given to the marks left by the feet of young men on the clay floor of the cave), Curt Sachs has no doubt that this ritual choreography was well known to the Paleolithics.38 But the circular dance is extremely widespread (throughout Eurasia, in eastern Europe, in Melanesia, among the Indians of California, etc.). It is practiced everywhere by hunters, whether to pacify the soul of the slain
animal or to insure the multiplication of game.39 In either case, the continuity with the religious ideology of the Paleolithic hunters is obvious. In addition, the mystical solidarity between the group of hunters and the game supports the presumption of various trade secrets known only to men; now, such "secrets" are imparted to adolescents by means of initiations. The circular dance admirably illustrates the persistence of prehistoric rites and beliefs in the contemporary archaic cultures. We shall come upon other examples. For the moment, we will repeat that what made it possible to "decipher" certain rock paintings of the Hoggar and the Tassili was an initiatory myth of the Peul shepherds, a myth communicated by an educated Malian to the Africanist Germaine Dieterlen, who published it.40 For his part,

26 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
H. von Sicard, in a monograph on Luwe and his onomastic analogues, came to the conclusion that this African god represents the earliest religious belief of the Euro-African hunters, at a period which the Swedish scholar dates before 8000 B.C.41 In short, it seems plausible to state that a certain number of myths were familiar to the Paleolithic populations, first of all the cosmogonic myths and the myths of origin (origin ofman, of game, of death, etc.). To give only one example, a cosmogonic myth brings on the stage the primordial Waters and the Creator, the latter either as anthropomorphic or in the form of an aquatic animal, descending to the bottom of the ocean to bring back the material necessary for the creation of the world. The immense dissemination of this cosmogony and its archaic structure point to a tradition inherited from earliest prehistory.42 Similarly, myths, legends, and rites related to ascent to the sky and "magical flight" (wings, feathers of birds of preyeagle, falcon) are universally documented, on all the continents, from
Australia and South America to the Arctic.43 Now these myths are bound up with certain oneiric and ecstatic experiences specifically characteristic of shamanism, and their archaism is indubitable. Equally widespread are the myths and symbols of the rainbow and its terrestrial counterpart the bridge, the preeminent means of connection with the otherworld. It is also permissible to suppose the existence of a cosmological "system" built up on the basis of the fundamental experience of a Center of the World, around which space is organized. As early as 1914, W. Gaerte had collected a large number of prehistoric signs and images that could be interpreted as cosmic mountains, navels of the earth, and paradigmatic rivers
dividing the "world" in four directions. 44 As for myths of the origin of animals and the religious relations among the hunter, the game, and the Lord of Wild Beasts, it is probable that they are very often mentioned, in cryptographic codes, in the iconographic repertory of the Paleolithics. It is equally

Rites, thought, and imagination 27
difficult for us to imagine a society of hunters without myths of the origin of fire, and the more so since the majority of these myths give a leading role to sexual activity. Finally, we must always take into consideration the primary experience of the sacrality of the sky and of celestial and atmospheric phenomena. This is one of the few experiences that spontaneously reveal transcendence and majesty. In addition, the ecstatic ascents of shamans, the symbolism of flight, the imaginary experience of altitude as a deliverance from weight, contribute to consecrating the celestial space as supremely the source and dwelling place of superhuman beings: gods, spirits, civilizing heroes. But equally important and significant are the "revelations" of night and darkness, of the killing of game and the death of a member of the family, of cosmic catastrophes, of the occasional crises of enthusiasm, madness, or homicidal ferocity among members of the tribe. A decisive part is played by the magico-religious valorizations of language. Certain gestures could already indicate the epiphany of a sacred power or of a cosmic "mystery." It is probable that the gestures of the anthropomorphic figures of prehistoric art were laden not only with meaning but also with power. The religious meaning of " gestures-epiphanies" were still known to certain primitive societies toward the end of the nineteenth century.45 A fortiori, phonetic inventiveness must have constituted an inexhaustible source of magico-religious powers. Even before articulate language, the human voice was able not only to transmit information, orders, or desires but also to bring into being a whole imaginary universe by its sonorous explosions, its phonic innovations. It is enough to think of the fictional creations, not only paramythological and parapoetic but also iconographic, brought into existence by the preliminary exercises of shamans preparing for their ecstatic journeys or by the repetition of mantras during certain yogic meditations, which involve both the rhythm of respiration (pranayama) and at the same time the visualization of the "mystical syllables."
45. Among certain tribes of northern Australia the principal rite in the initiation of a girl consists in solemnly presenting her before the community. She is shown to be an adult-in other words, ready to assume the behavior proper to women. Now to show something ritually, be it a sign, an object, or an animal, is to declare a sacred presence, to acclaim the miracle of a hierophany; see Eliade, Australian Religions, pp. 116-17; for other examples see Birth and Rebirth, pp. 43 fr.



28 THE PALEANTHROPIANS
In proportion as it was perfected, language increased its magicoreligious abilities. The uttered word loosed a force difficult, if not impossible, to annul. Similar beliefs still survive in a number of primitive and folk cultures. They are also found in the ritual function of the magical formulas of panegyric, satire, execration, and anathema in the most complex societies. The exalting experience of the word as magico-religious force has sometimes led to the certainty that language is able to insure the results obtained by ritual action. To conclude, it is also necessary to take into consideration the difference between the various types of personality. One hunter was distinguished by his prowess or his craftiness, another by the intensity of his ecstatic trances. These characterological differences imply a certain variety in the valorization and interpretation of religious experiences. In the last analysis, despite the few fundamental ideas common to it, the religious heritage of the Paleolithic already displayed a complex configuration.



2 The Longest Revolution:
The Discovery of
Agriculture- Mesolithic and Neolithic
8. A lost paradise
The end of the Ice Age, about 8000 B.C., radically changed the climate and landscape, and hence the flora and fauna, of Europe north of the Alps. The retreat of the glaciers brought on a migration of the fauna toward the northern regions. Gradually, forest replaced the arctic steppes. The hunters followed the game, especially the herds of reindeer, but the diminishing stock of game animals obliged them to settle on the banks of lakes and at the seashore and to live by fishing. The new cultures that developed during the following millennia have been termed Mesolithic. In western Europe they are distinctly poorer than the grandiose creations of the Upper Paleolithic. By contrast, in Southwest Asia, and especially in Palestine, the Mesolithic constitutes an axial period: it is the time of the domestication of the first animals and the beginnings of agriculture. Little is known concerning the religious practices of the hunters who had followed the reindeer herds into northern Europe. In the deposit of silt in a pool at Stellmoor, near Hamburg, A. Rust found the remains of twelve entire reindeer, submerged with stones in their thoracic cages or abdomens. Rust and other authors have interpreted this as a first-fruits offering presented to a divinity, probably the Lord of Wild Beasts. But H. Pohlhausen has cited the fact that the Eskimos preserve supplies of meat in the icy water of lakes and rivers.1 However, as Pohlhausen himself admits, this empirical explanation does not exclude the religious intention of certain

deposits. For sacrifice by immersion is amply documented, and at different periods, from northern Europe to India.2 The lake of Stellmoor was probably considered a sacred place by the Mesolithic hunters. Rust collected various objects from the deposit: wooden arrows, bone tools, axes made from reindeer antlers. In all likelihood they represent offerings, as is the case with objects from the Bronze Age and the Iron Age found in certain ponds and lakes in western Europe. To be sure, more than five millennia separate the two groups of objects, but the continuity of this type of religious practice is beyond doubt. Discoveries at the Saint-Sauveur spring (Forest of Compiegne) have included flints from the Neolithic period (intentionally broken to signify that they were ex votos), objects from the time of the Gauls and the Gallo-Romans, and from the Middle Ages to our own day.3 It must also be taken into consideration that, in this last instance, the practice remained in force despite the cultural influence of imperial Rome and, above all, in spite of repeated prohibitions by the Church. In addition to its intrinsic interest, this example has a paradigmatic value: it admirably illustrates the continuity of "sacred places" and of certain religious practices. Still in the Mesolithic stratum at Stellmoor, Rust discovered a pinewood post with a reindeer skull set at its summit. According to Maringer, this cult post probably indicates ritual meals: the flesh of reindeer was eaten and their heads were offered to a divine being. Not far from Ahrensburg-Hopfenbach, in a Mesolithic station dated at 10,000 B.C., Rust brought up from the bottom of a pond the trunk of a willow 3.50 meters in length, crudely sculptured; it is possible to make out a head, a long neck, and deeply incised lines that, according to the maker of the discovery, represent arms. This "idol" had been set up in the pond, but neither bones nor any other objects were found around it. In all probability it represents the image of a supernatural being, though it is impossible to determine the structure of the latter.4

A lost paradise 31
In comparison with the poverty of these few documents of the reindeer-hunters, the rock art of eastern Spain offers the historian of religions a large quantity of data. The naturalistic rock painting of the Upper Paleolithic was transformed, in the "Spanish Levant," into a rigid and formalistic geometrical art. The rock walls of the Sierra Morena are covered with anthropomorphic and theriomorphic figures (principally of stags and ibexes), reduced to a few lines, and with various signs (undulating ribbons, circles, points, suns). Hugo Obermeier has shown that these anthropomorphic figures bear a resemblance to the painted pebbles of the Azilian.5 Since that civilization derives from Spain, the anthropomorphic representations inscribed on the rock walls and on pebbles must have similar meanings. They have been explained as phallic symbols, as elements of a system of writing, or as magical signs. The comparison with the Australian tjurungas seems more convincing. These ritual objects, most often of stone and decorated with various geometrical designs, are known to represent the mystical body of the ancestors. The tjurungas are hidden in caves or buried in certain sacred places and are communicated to the young men only at the end oftheir initiation. Among the Aranda, the father addresses his son as follows: "Here is your own body, from which you came forth by a new birth," or "This is your own body. It is the ancestor whom you were when, during your former existence, you traveled. Then you went down into the sacred cave to rest." 6 Even if the painted pebbles from Mas d'Azil had, as is probable, a function similar to that of the tjurungas, it is impossible to know if their makers held ideas similar to those of the Australians. Yet there can be no doubt of the religious significance of the Azilian pebbles. In the Birsek cave, in Switzerland, 133 painted pebbles were found, almost all of them broken. It seems plausible that they were broken by enemies or by later occupants of the cave. In either case, what was sought was annihilation of the magico-religious force present in these objects. In all probability the caves and other sites decorated with

6. Eliade, Australian Religions, pp. 95 if., esp. p. 98 (quote). It is clear that, according to the beliefs of the Australians, the ancestor exists simultaneously in his mystical body, the tjurunga, and in the man in whom he has become
reincarnated. It should be added that he also exists underground and in the form of "spirit children" (ibid., p. 49).



32 MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC
rock paintings in the Spanish Levant constituted holy places. As for the suns and other geometrical signs that accompany the anthropomorphic representations, their meaning remains mysterious.7 We have no means of determining the origin and development ofthe belief in ancestors during prehistory. To judge by the ethnographic parallels, this religious complex is able to coexist with belief in supernatural beings or Lords of Wild Beasts. There seems to be no reason why the idea of mythical ancestors should not form part of the religious system of the Paleolithics: it is bound up with the mythology of origins-origin of the world, of game, of man, of death-that is typical of hunting civilizations. In addition, it is a religious idea that is universally disseminated and mythologically fertile, for it has survived in all religions, even the most complex (with the exception of Hinayana Buddhism). It can happen that an archaic religious idea will develop in an unexpected way in certain periods and following upon particular circumstances. Ifit is true that the idea of the mythical ancestor and the cult of ancestors dominate the European Mesolithic, it is probable, as Maringer believes (The Gods of Prehistoric Man, p. 183), that the importance of this religious complex is explained by the memory of the Ice Age, when the distant ancestors lived in a sort of hunters' paradise. And in fact the Australians consider that their mythical ancestors lived during a golden age, in an earthly paradise in which game abounded and the notions of good and evil were practically unknown.s It is this paradisal world that the Australians attempt to reactualize during certain festivals, when laws and prohibitions are suspended.
9. Work, technology, and imaginary worlds
As we said: in the Near East, and especially in Palestine, the Mesolithic represents a creative period, though at the same time it retains the character of transition between two types of civilizations, the one based on hunting and gathering, the other on cultivation of cereals. In Palestine the hunters of the Upper Paleolithic seem to

Work, technology, and imaginary worlds 33
have lived in caves for long periods. But it was especially the bearers of the Natufian culture 9 who chose a definitely sedentary existence. They inhabited caves as well as open-air sites (as at Einan, where excavation has revealed a village made up of circular huts with fireplaces). The Natufians had discovered the importance of wild cereals as foodstuffs, and they harvested them with stone sickles and ground the seeds in a mortar with the help of a pestle.10 It was a great step forward toward agriculture. The domestication of animals also began during the Mesolithic (though it did not become general until the beginning of the Neolithic): the sheep at Zawi ChemiShanidar, about 8000 B.C.; the goat at Jericho, in Israel, about 7000 B.C.; and the pig about 6500 B.C.; and the dog at Stan Carr, in England, about 7500 B.C.n The immediate results of the domestication of Graminaceae appear in the expansion of the population and the development of commerce, phenomena already characteristic ofthe Natufians. Unlike the geometrical schematism typical of the designs and paintings of the European Mesolithic, the art of the Natufians is naturalistic; excavations have yielded small sculptures of animals and human figurines, sometimes in erotic postures.12 The sexual symbolism of pestles sculptured in the shape of a phallus is so obvious that their magico-religious meaning cannot be doubted. The two types of Natufian burial-{a) inhumation of the entire body in a bent position and (b) burial of skulls-were known in the Paleolithic and will continue into the Neolithic. In regard to the skeletons excavated at Einan,13 it has been supposed that a human

victim was sacrificed in connection with the burial, but the meaning of the ritual remains unknown. As for the deposits of skulls, the Natufian documents have been compared with the deposits discovered at Offnet, in Bavaria, and in the Hohlenstein cave in Wiirttemberg; all these skulls belonged to individuals who had been massacred, perhaps by headhunters or cannibals.14 In both cases we may presume a magico-religious act, since the head (i.e., the brain) was considered to be the seat of the" soul." As the result of dreams and ecstatic and paraecstatic experiences, there had long been a recognition ofthe existence of an element independent of the body, which modern languages designate by the terms "soul," "spirit," "breath," "life," "double," etc. This spiritual element (as it must be called, since it was apprehended as image, vision, apparition, etc.) was present in the entire body; it constituted in some sort its "double." But localizing the "soul" or "spirit" in the brain had marked consequences ;15 on the one hand, it was believed that the victim's spiritual element could be assimilated by eating his brain; on the other hand, the brain, the source of power, became the object ofa cult. In addition to agriculture, other inventions took place during the Mesolithic, the most important being the bow and the manufacture of cords, nets, hooks, and boats able to make fairly long voyages. Like the other earlier inventions (stone tools, various objects made from bone and antlers, clothes and tents made from skins, etc.), and like those that will be achieved during the Neolithic (first and foremost, pottery), all these discoveries gave rise to mythologies and paramythological fictions and sometimes became the basis for various ritual behaviors. The empirical value of these inventions is evident. What is less so is the importance of the imaginative activity inspired by familiarity with the different modalities of matter. In working with a piece of flint or a primitive needle, in joining together animal hides or wooden planks, in preparing a fishhook or an arrowhead, in shaping a clay statuette, the imagination discovers unsuspected analogies among the different levels of the real; tools and

The heritage of the Paleolithic hunters 35
objects are laden with countless symbolisms, the world of work-the microuniverse that absorbs the artisan's attention for long hoursbecomes a mysterious and sacred center, rich in meanings. The imaginary world created and continually enriched by intimacy with matter can be only inadequately grasped in the figurative or geometric creations of the various prehistoric cultures, but it is still accessible to us in the experiences of our own imagination. It is above all this continuity on the plane of imaginative activity that permits us to comprehend the existence of men living in those distant periods. But, unlike the man of modern societies, the imaginative activity of prehistoric man also possessed a mythological dimension. A considerable number of supernatural figures and mythological episodes, which we shall encounter again in later religious traditions, very probably represent discoveries of the Stone Age.
10. The heritage of the Paleolithic hunters
The various kinds of progress effected during the Mesolithic put an end to the cultural unity of the Paleolithic populations and launch the variety and divergences that will thereafter become the chief characteristic of civilizations. The remnants of the Paleolithic hunting societies begin to make their way into the marginal regions or those to which access is difficult: the desert, the great forests, the mountains. But this increasing remoteness and isolation of the Paleolithic societies does not imply the disappearance of the behavior and spirituality typical of the hunter. Hunting as means of subsistence continues in the societies of agriculturalists. Probably a certain number of hunters who refused to take an active part in the economy of the cultivators were employed as guardians of the villages-first against the wild beasts that harassed the sedentary populations and damaged the cultivated fields, later against bands of marauders. Probably, too, the first military organizations took shape from these groups of hunters acting as guardians. As we shall soon see, warriors, conquerors, and military aristocracies carryon the symbolism and ideology of the paradigmatic hunter. On the other hand, blood sacrifices, which were practiced by both cultivators and pastoralists, in the last analysis repeat the killing of



36 MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC
game by the hunter. A type of behavior that, for one or two million years, had been inseparable from the human (or at least the masculine) mode is not easily abolished. Several millennia after the triumph of the agricultural economy, the Weltanschauung of the primitive hunter will again have repercussions on history. For the invasions and conquests of the IndoEuropeans and the Turko-Mongols will be undertaken under the sign of the supreme hunter, the carnivore. The members of the IndoEuropean military confraternities (Miinnerbunde) and the nomadic horsemen of Central Asia behaved toward the sedentary populations that they attacked like carnivores hunting, strangling, and devouring the herbivores of the steppe or the farmers' cattle. Numerous IndoEuropean and Turko-Mongol tribes had eponyms of beasts of prey (primarily the wolf) and regarded themselves as descended from a theriomorphic mythical ancestor. The military initiations of the IndoEuropeans involved a ritual transformation into a wolf: the paradigmatic warrior appropriated the behavior of a carnivore. On the other hand, the pursuit and killing of a wild animal becomes the mythical model for the conquest of a territory (Landndma) and the founding of a state.16 Among the Assyrians, the Iranians, and the Turko-Mongols the techniques of hunting and war are so much alike as to be hardly separable. Everywhere in the Eurasian world, from the appearance of the Assyrians to the beginnings of the modern period, hunting constitutes at once the typical school and training ground, and the favorite sport, of sovereigns and military aristocracies. In addition, the fabled prestige of the hunter's existence, in comparison with that of the sedentary cultivators, is still maintained among numerous primitive peoples.17 The hundreds of thousands of years spent in a sort of mystical symbiosis with the animal world have left indelible traces. What is more, orgiastic ecstasy is able to reactualize the religious behavior of the earliest Paleohominians, when the game was eaten raw; this happened in Greece, among the worshipers of Dionysus (§ 124), or, still at the beginning of the twentieth century, among the Aissawa of Morocco.
16. In Africa and elsewhere the ritual hunt is performed on the occasion of initiations and at the installation of a new chief. 17. A characteristic example: the Desana of Colombia call themselves hunters, even though 75 percent of their food comes from fishing and horticulture. In their view, only the hunter's life is worth living.



The domestication offood plants,' Origin myths 37
11. The domestication of food plants: Origin myths
Since 1960 it has been known that villages preceded the discovery of agriculture. What Gordon Childe called the" Neolithic Revolution" took place gradually between 9000 and 7000 B.C. It is also known that, contrary to what was thought until quite recently, the cultivation of Graminaceae and the domestication of animals preceded the making of pottery. Agriculture properly speaking-that is, the cultivation of cereals-developed in Southwest Asia and Central America. "Vegeculture," which depends upon the vegetative reproduction of tubers, roots, or rhizomes, seems to have originated in the humid tropical plains of America and Southeast Asia. The antiquity ofvegeculture and its relations with "cerealiculture" have not yet been adequately worked out. Some ethnologists are inclined to consider vegeculture earlier than the cultivation of grains; others, on the contrary, hold that it represents an impoverished imitation of agriculture. One ofthe few clear indications was furnished by excavations made in South America. In the plains of Rancho Peludo, in Venezuela, and Momil, in Colombia, vestiges of a cultivation of cassava were found below the level of the cultivation of maize, which signifies the priority of vegeculture.18 A new proof of the antiquity of vegeculture was recently brought to light in Thailand, where excavation in a cave (the "Cave of Phantoms") yielded cultivated peas, beans, and roots of tropical plants; radiocarbon analysis indicates dates of about 9000 B.C.19 It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of the discovery of agriculture for the history of civilization. By becoming the producer of his food, man was obliged to alter his ancestral behavior. Above all, he had to perfect his technique for calculating time, the first discovery of which had already been made in the Paleolithic. It was no longer enough for him to ascertain certain future dates correctly by means of a rudimentary lunar calendar. From now on, the cultivator had to make his plans several months before they were to be implemented, had to perform, in an exact order, a series of complex activities in view of a distant and, especially in the beginning,

always uncertain result: the harvest. In addition, the cultivation of plants imposed a differently oriented division oflabor from that which had earlier been in force, for thenceforth the chief responsibility for assuring the means of subsistence fell upon women. The consequences of the discovery of agriculture were no less important for the religious history of mankind. The domestication of plants gave rise to an existential situation that had previously been inaccessible; hence it inspired creations of values and reversals of them that radically altered the spiritual universe of pre-Neolithic man. We shall soon analyze this religious revolution whose beginnings followed on the triumph of the cultivation of cereals. For the moment, we will cite some of the myths that explain the origin of the two types of agriculture. In learning how the cultivators explained the appearance of food plants, we at the same time learn the religious justification for various aspects of their behavior. The majority of origin myths have been collected among primitive populations practicing either vegeculture or cereal culture. (Such myths are scarcer, and sometimes radically reinterpreted, in developed cultures.) A rather widely disseminated theme explains that edible tubers and fruit trees (coconut, banana, etc.) were born from an immolated divinity. The most famous example comes from Ceram, one of the islands off New Guinea: from the dismembered and buried body of a semidivine maiden, Hainuwele, spring plants until then unknown, especially tubers. This primordial murder radically changed the human condition, for it introduced sexuality and death and first established the religious and social institutions that are still in force. Hainuwele's violent death is not only a "creative" death, it permits the goddess to be continually present in the life of human beings and even in their death. Obtaining nourishment from plants that have sprung from her own body is, in reality, to obtain it from the actual substance of the goddess. We shall not expand upon the importance of this origin myth for the religious life and culture of the paleocultivators. It is enough to say that all responsible activities (puberty ceremonies, animal or human sacrifices, cannibalism, funerary ceremonies, etc.) properly speaking constitute a recalling, a "remembrance," of the primordial murder.20 It is significant that the cultivator associates with a murder the essentially peaceful labor that insures his existence, whereas in 20. Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 105 if.



The domestication offood plants: Origin myths 39
societies of hunters the responsibility for slaughter is attributed to another, to a "stranger." It is easy to understand the hunter: he fears the vengeance of the slain animal (more precisely, of its" soul") or he justifies himself before the Lord of Wild Beasts. As for the paleocultivators, the myth of the primordial murder certainly justifies such sanguinary rites as human sacrifice and cannibalism, but it is difficult to determine its initial religious context. A similar mythical theme explains the origin of food plants-both tubers and cereals-as arising from the excreta or the sweat of a divinity or mythical ancestor. When the beneficiaries discover the repulsive source oftheir foodstuffs, they kill the author; but, following his advice, they dismember his body and bury the pieces. Food plants and other elements of culture (agricultural implements, silk
worms, etc.) spring from his corpse.21 The meaning of these myths is obvious: food plants are sacred, since they are derived from the body of a divinity (for the excreta and the sweat are also part of the divine substance). By feeding himself, man, in the last analysis, eats a divine being. The food plant is not " given" in the world, as the animal is. It is the result of a primitive dramatic event; in this case it is the product of a murder. We shall later see the consequences of these alimentary theologies. The German ethnologist A. E. Jensen held that the myth of Hainuwele is peculiar to the paleocultivators of tubers. As for the myths concerning the origin of cereal culture, they feature a primordial theft: cereals exist, but in the sky, jealously guarded by the gods; a civilizing hero ascends into the sky, makes off with a few seeds, and bestows them on mankind. Jensen called these two types of mythologies "Hainuwele" and "Prometheus" and connected them respectively with the civilization of the paleocultivators (vegeculture) and that of the agriculturalists properly speaking (cereal culture).22 The distinction is certainly real. However, in respect to the two types of origin myths, it is less rigid than Jensen thought, for a number of myths explain the appearance of cereals from an immolated primitive being. We should add that in the religions of agriculturalists the origin of cereals is also divine; the bestowal of cereals on human

beings is sometimes connected with a hierogamy between the god of the sky (or of the atmosphere) and Mother Earth or with a mythical drama involving sexual union, death, and resurrection.
12. Woman and vegetation. Sacred space and periodical renewal of the world
The first, and perhaps the most important, consequence of the discovery of agriculture precipitates a crisis in the values of the Paleolithic hunters: religious relations with the animal world are supplanted by what may be called the mystical solidarity between man and vegetation. If the bone and the blood until then represented the essence and the sacrality of life, from then on it is the sperm and the blood that incarnate them. In addition, woman and feminine sacrality are raised to the first rank. Since women played a decisive part in the domestication of plants, they become the owners of the cultivated fields, which raises their social position and creates characteristic institutions, such as, for example, matrilocation, the husband being obliged to live in his wife's house. The fertility of the earth is bound up with feminine fecundity; hence women become responsible for the abundance of harvests, for they know the "mystery" of creation. It is a religious mystery, for it governs the origin of life, the food supply, and death. The soil is assimilated to woman. Later, after the discovery of the plow, agricultural work is assimilated to the sexual act.23 But for millennia Mother Earth gave birth by herself, through parthenogenesis. The memory of this "mystery" still survived in the Olympian mythology (Hera conceives alone and gives birth to Hephaestus and Ares) and can be read in numerous myths and popular beliefs concerning the birth of men from the Earth, giving birth on the ground, depositing the newborn infant on the ground, etc.24 Born of the Earth, man, when he dies, returns to his mother. "Crawl toward the earth, thy mother," the Vedic poet exclaims (Rig Veda 10. 18. 10). To be sure, feminine and maternal sacrality was not unknown in the Paleolithic (§ 6), but the discovery of agriculture markedly increases its power. The sacrality of sexual life, and first of all of

Sacred space and periodical renewal of the world 41
feminine sexuality, becomes inseparable from the miraculous enigma of creation. Parthenogenesis, the hieros gamos, and the ritual orgy express, on different planes, the religious character of sexuality. A complex symbolism, anthropocosmic in structure, associates woman and sexuality with the lunar rhythms, with the earth (assimilated to the womb), and with what must be called the "mystery" of vegetation. It is a mystery that demands the" death" of the seed in order to insure it a new birth, a birth all the more marvelous because accompanied by an astonishing multiplication. The assimilation of human existence to vegetable life finds expression in images and metaphors drawn from the drama of vegetation (life is like the flower of the field, etc.). This imagery nourished poetry and philosophical reflection for millennia, and it still remains "true" for contemporary man. All these religious values that followed upon the invention of agriculture were progressively articulated in the course of time. We have, however, cited them now to bring out the specific character of the Mesolithic and Neolithic creations. We shall constantly encounter religious ideas, mythologies, and ritual scenarios that are bound up with the "mystery" of vegetable life. For religious creativity was stimulated, not by the empirical phenomenon ofagriculture, but by the mystery of birth, death, and rebirth identified in the rhythm of vegetation. In order to be understood, accepted, and mastered, the crises that threaten the harvest (floods, droughts, etc.) will be translated into mythological dramas. These mythologies and the ritual scenarios that depend on them will dominate the religions of the Near East for millennia. The mythical theme of gods who die and return to life is among the most important. In certain cases, these archaic scenarios will give birth to new religious creations (for example, Eleusis, the Greco-Oriental mysteries; see § 96). The agrarian cultures develop what may be called a cosmic religion, since religious activity is concentrated around the central mystery: the periodical renewal of the world. Like human existence, the cosmic rhythms are expressed in terms drawn from vegetable life. The mystery of cosmic sacrality is symbolized in the World Tree. The universe is conceived as an organism that must be renewed periodically-in other words, each year. "Absolute reality," rejuvenation, immortality, are accessible to certain privileged persons through the power residing in a certain fruit or in a spring near a



42 MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC
tree.25 The Cosmic Tree is held to be at the center of the world, and it unites the three cosmic regions, for it sends its roots down into the underworld, and its top touches the sky.26 Since the world must be renewed periodically, the cosmogony will be ritually reiterated at each New Year. This mythico-ritual scenario is documented in the Near East and among the Indo-Iranians. But it is also found in the societies of the primitive cultivators, who in some sense prolong the religious conceptions of the Neolithic. The fundamental idea-renewal of the world by repetition of the cosmogonyis certainly earlier, preagricultural. It is found, with the inevitable variations, among the Australians and a number of North American
tribes.27 Among both the paleocultivators and the agriculturalists the mythico-ritual scenario of the New Year includes the return of the dead, and similar ceremonies survive in classical Greece, among the ancient Germans, in Japan, etc. The experience of cosmic time, especially in the framework of agricultural labors, ends by imposing the idea of circular time and the cosmic cycle. Since the world and human existence are valorized in terms ofvegetable life, the cosmic cycle is conceived as the indefinite repetition of the same rhythm: birth, death, rebirth. In post-Vedic India this conception will be elaborated in two intertwined doctrines: that of cycles (yugas), repeated to infinity, and that of the transmigration of souls. In addition, the archaic ideas articulated around the periodic renewal of the world will be taken up again, reinterpreted, and made part of several religious systems of the Near East. The cosmologies, eschatologies, and messianisms that will dominate the East and the Mediterranean world for two millennia have their deepest roots in the conceptions of the Neolithics.
The religious valorizations of space-primarily of the habitation and the village-were equally important. A sedentary existence organizes the "world" differently from a nomadic life. For the agriculturalist, the "true world" is the space in which he lives:
25. See Patterns, §§ 99 if. 26. The Cosmic Tree is the most widespread expression of the axis mundi; but the symbolism of the cosmic axis probably precedes-or is independent of -the agricultural civilizations, since it is found in certain arctic cultures.

Sacred space and periodical renewal of the world 43
house, village, cultivated fields. The "center of the world" is the place consecrated by rituals and prayers, for it is there that communication with the superhuman beings is effected. We do not know what religious meanings the Neolithics of the Near East attributed to their houses and villages; we know only that, from a certain moment, they built altars and sanctuaries. But in China it is possible to reconstruct the symbolism of the Neolithic house, since there is continuity or analogy with certain types of habitations found in North Asia and Tibet. In the Neolithic culture of Yang-chao there were small circular constructions (ca. 5 meters in diameter) with pillars supporting the roof and spaced around a central hole that served as hearth. Possibly the roof was pierced by a smoke hole above the hearth. This house would have had, in lasting materials, the same structure as the Mongol yurt of our day.28 Now the cosmological symbolism that pervades the yurt and the tents of the North Asian populations is well known; the sky is conceived as an immense tent held up by a central pillar: the tent pole, or the aperture above for the escape of smoke, are assimilated to the World Pillar or to the "Hole in the Sky," the North Star.29 This opening is also called the "Sky Window." The Tibetans call the opening in the roof of their houses "Fortune of the Sky" or "Gate of the Sky." The cosmological symbolism of the habitation is documented in numerous primitive societies. In ways more or less manifest, the habitation is considered an imago mundi. Since examples of this are found at all levels of culture, there seems to be no reason why the Neolithics of the Near East should have been an exception, the more so since it is in this region that the cosmological symbolism of architecture will attain its richest development. The division of the habitation between the two sexes (a custom already documented in the Paleolithic; see § 6) probably had a cosmological meaning. The divisions exhibited by the villages of cultivators correspond in general to a dichotomy that is at once classificatory and ritual (sky and earth, masculine and feminine, etc.) but also to two ritually antagonistic groups. Now, as we shall see on many occasions, ritual combats

between two opposing groups play an important part, especially in the New Year scenarios. Whether it is the repetition of a mythical combat, as in Mesopotamia (§ 22) or simply the confrontation between two cosmogonic principles (winter/summer; day/night; life/death), the deep meaning is always the same: confrontation, jousts, combats awaken, stimulate, or increase the creative forces of life.30 This biocosmological conception, probably elaborated by the Neolithic agriculturalists, will undergo many reinterpretations, and even deformations, in the course of time. It is recognizable only with difficulty, for example in certain types of religious dualism. We do not claim to have enumerated all the religious creations inspired by the discovery of agriculture. We have considered it enough to show the common source, in the Neolithic, of certain ideas that will sometimes reach their full flowering only millennia later. We will add that the dissemination of the religiosity whose structure is agrarian resulted, despite countless variations and innovations, in the constitution of a certain fundamental unity that, even in our day, still underlies certain common traits in peasant societies as far apart as those of the Mediterranean, India, and China.
13. Neolithic religions of the Near East
It could be said that, from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, the history of religious ideas and beliefs is one with the history of civilization. Each technological discovery, each economic and social innovation, is, it would seem, "doubled" by a religious meaning and value. When, in the following pages, we shall mention certain innovations of the Neolithic, their religious echo must be taken into consideration too. However, in order not to break the unity of our exposition, we shall not always emphasize these echoes. Thus, for example, all the aspects of the culture of Jericho would deserve a religious commentary. It is perhaps the most ancient city on earth (ca. 6850, 6770 B.C.),31 though it is ignorant of ceramics.

Neolithic religions of the Near East 45
However, the fortifications, the massive tower, the large public edifices-at least one of which seems to have been built for ritual ceremonies-denote a social integration and an economic organization that are the prelude to the future city-states of Mesopotamia. The Garstangs and Kathleen Kenyon have brought to light several buildings of unusual structure, which they have called "temples" and a "family chapel." Among the clearly religious documents, two feminine statuettes and a few others representing animals indicate a fertility cult. Some authors have attributed especial significance to the remains of three plaster images discovered by the Garstangs in the 1930s: they are thought to represent a bearded male, a woman, and a child. The eyes are marked by shells. The Garstangs thought it possible to identify in these remains the earliest-known divine triad, probably bound up with a mythology similar to those that will later
dominate the Near East. But this interpretation is still disputed.32 The dead were buried under the floors of the houses. Some skulls exhumed by Kathleen Kenyon 33 show a strange preparation: the lower parts are molded in plaster, and the eyes are represented by shells, to the point that they have been compared to actual portraits.
All this undoubtedly indicates a cult of skulls.34 But it almost seems that an attempt was made to preserve the memory of the living individual. The cult of skulls is also found at Tell Ramad (in Syria, near Damascus), where excavations have brought to light craniums with the forehead painted red and the face filled out with modeled clay.35 Still from Syria (Tell Ramad and Byblos), more precisely from levels dated to the fifth millennium, come some anthropomorphic figurines in clay. The one found at Byblos is bisexual.36 Other feminine statuettes, found in Palestine and dated about 4500 B.C., show the Mother Goddess in a terrifying and demonic aspect.37

46 MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC
The fertility cult and the cult of the dead seem, then, to be bound together. Indeed, the cultures of Hacilar and of <;atal Hiiyiik (7000 B.C.) in Anatolia, which preceded-and probably influenced-the preceramic culture of Jericho, indicate the existence of similar beliefs. The cult of skulls is well documented at Hacilar. At <;atal Hiiyiik the skeletons were buried under the floors of houses, accompanied by funeral gifts: jewels, semiprecious stones, weapons, textiles, wooden vessels, etc.3S In the forty sanctuaries excavated up to 1965, numerous stone and clay statuettes were found. The principal divinity is the goddess, presented under three aspects: young woman, mother giving birth to a child (or to a bull), and old crone (sometimes accompanied by a bird of prey). The masculine divinity appears in the form of a boy or youth-the goddess's child or lover-and of a bearded adult, occasionally mounted on his sacred animal, the bull. The variety of paintings on the walls is astonishing; no two sanctuaries are alike. Reliefs ofthe goddess, sometimes 2 meters high, modeled in plaster, wood, or clay, and heads of bulls (the epiphany of the god) were fastened to the walls. Sexual imagery is absent, but a woman's bust and a bull's horn-symbols of life-are sometimes combined. A sanctuary (ca. 6200 B.C.) contained four men's skulls deposited under the bulls' heads fastened to the walls. One wall is decorated with paintings depicting vultures with anthropomorphic legs attacking a decapitated man. This must certainly represent an important mythico-ritual complex, the meaning of which unfortunately escapes us. At Hacilar, at a level dated 5700 B.C., the goddess is shown seated on a leopard, or standing and holding a leopard cub, but also alone, standing, seated, kneeling, resting, or accompanied by a child. Sometimes she is naked or has a tiny cache-sexe. Here, too, she is represented sometimes as young, sometimes as older. On a more recent level (between 5435 and 5200 B.C.) the figurines of the goddess, accompanied by a child or an animal, disappear, as do the masculine statues. However, the last phases of the Hacilar culture are characterized by admirable ceramics, richly ornamented with geometrical designs. 39

Neolithic religions of the Near East 47
The Tell Halaf culture, as it is called,40 appears at the time when the Anatolian cultures disappear. It knows copper and seems to be the creation of a population coming down from the North, perhaps as refugees from Hacilar and C;atal Hiiyiik. The Tell Halafreligious complex is not very different from the cultures we have so far considered. The dead were buried with gifts, among them clay figurines. The wild bull was venerated as an epiphany of male fertility. Images of bulls, bucrania, ram's heads, and the double ax certainly had a cult role, related to the storm god, so important in all the religions of the ancient Near East. However, no masculine figurines have been found, whereas images of the goddess are abundant; often in a crouching position, accompanied by doves and with exaggerated breasts, it is difficult not to recognize in them the paradigm.atic image of the Mother Goddess.41 The Halafian culture was destroyed or disappeared about 44004300 B.C., while the culture of Obeid, which originated in southern Iraq, was being disseminated throughout Mesopotamia. It is already documented at Warka (Sumerian Uruk, Semitic Erech) about 4325 B.C. No other prehistoric culture exercised a comparable influence. Progress in metalworking is considerable (copper axes, various objects of gold). Wealth accumulates through the progress of agriculture and through commerce. An almost life-size head of a man and animal heads in marble certainly have a religious meaning. Some seals of the Gawra type represent various cult scenes (persons around an altar decorated with bucrania; ritual dances; emblematic animals, etc.). The human figures are strongly schematized. In fact, a nonfigurative tendency characterizes the entire Obeid culture. The sanctuaries depicted on amulets are not copies of particular edifices but represent a sort of paradigmatic image of the temple. Some human statuettes in chalk probably represent priests. For in fact the most significant novelty of the Obeid period is precisely the appearance of monumental temples.42 One of the most remarkable

is the White Temple (3100 B.C.), 22.3 x 17.5 meters, raised on a platform 70 meters long, 66 meters wide, and 13 meters high. This platform incorporates the remains of ancient sanctuaries and constitutes a ziggurat, a sacred "mountain," whose symbolism we shall investigate later (§ 54).
14. The spiritual edifice of the Neolithic
For our purpose it would be useless to follow the dissemination of agriculture and, later, of metallurgy through the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean-to Greece and the Balkans-and thence through the Danubian regions and the rest of Europe; it would be equally unnecessary to follow its spread into India, China, and Southeast Asia. We will merely mention that, in the beginning, agriculture made its way only slowly into some regions of Europe. On the one hand, the postglacial climate permitted the Mesolithic societies of central and western Europe to subsist on the products of hunting and fishing. On the other hand, the cultivation of cereals had to be adapted to a temperate and forest-covered zone. The earliest agricultural communities develop along watercourses and on the edges of the great forests. Nevertheless, the propagation of Neolithic agriculture, begun in the Near East about 8000 B.C., proves to be an inescapable process. Despite the resistance of certain populations, especially after the crystallization of pastoralism, the dissemination of the cultivation of food plants was approaching Australia and Patagonia when the effects of European colonization and the Industrial Revolution were beginning to be felt. The propagation of cereal culture carries with it rites, myths, and religious ideas peculiar to that mode of life. But this is by no means a mechanical process. Even reduced, as we are, to archeological documents-in other words. ignorant of their religious meanings and, above all, of the concomitant myths and rituals-we still observe differences, sometimes of great importance, between the Neolithic cultures of Europe and their Eastern sources. It is certain, for example, that the cult of the bull, documented by numerous images in the Danubian regions, comes from the Near East. Yet there is no proof of the sacrifice of bulls, such as was practiced in Crete or in the Neolithic cultures of the Indus. So, too, idols of the gods, or the



The spiritual edifice of the Neolithic 49
iconographic ensemble of Mother Goddess and Child, idols so common in the East, are comparatively scarce in the Danubian regions. What is more, such statuettes have never been found in burials. Some recent discoveries have brilliantly confirmed the originality of the archaic cultures of southeastern Europe, that is, of the complex that Marija Gimbutas calls "Old European civilization." For in fact a civilization that includes the cultivation of wheat and barley and the domestication of sheep, cattle, and the pig is manifested simultaneously, about 7000 B.C. or earlier, on the coasts of Greece and Italy, in Crete, in southern Anatolia, in Syria and Palestine, and in the Fertile Crescent. Now on the basis of radiocarbon dates it is impossible to say that this cultural complex made its appearance in Greece later than in the Fertile Crescent, Syria, Cilicia, or Palestine. We still do not know what the "initial impulse" for this culture was.43 But there is no archeological proof indicating an influx of immigrants arriving in Greece from Asia Minor and possessing cultivated plants and domesticated animals. 44 Whatever its origin may have been, the "Old European civilization" developed in an original way, one that distinguishes it both from the cultures of the Near East and from those of central and northern Europe. Between 6500 and 5300 B.C. there was a powerful upsurge of culture in the Balkan Peninsula and in central Anatolia. A large number of objects (seals with ideograms, human and animal figures, theriomorphic vessels, images of divine masks) indicate ritual activities. Toward the· middle of the sixth millennium there is a mUltiplication of villages defended by ditches or walls and able to contain up to a thousand inhabitants.45 A large number of altars and sanctuaries, as well as various cult objects, bear witness to a wellorganized religion. In the Aeneolithic station of Cascioarele, 60 kilometers south of Bucharest, excavation has revealed a temple whose walls were painted with magnificent spirals in red and green on a yellowish-white ground. No statuettes were found, but a column 2 meters high and also a smaller one indicate a cult of the sacred

pillar, symbol of the axis mundi.46 Above this temple another, of later date, was found, which yielded a terra-cotta model of a sanctuary. The model represents a decidedly impressive architectonic complex: four temples set on a high pedestal.47 Several models oftemples have been found in the Balkan Peninsula. Added to countless other documents (figurines, masks, various nonfigurative symbols, etc.), they indicate the richness and complexity of a religion whose content still remains inaccessible.48 It is unnecessary to enumerate all the Neolithic documents that can support a religious interpretation. We will sometimes refer to them when we discuss the religious prehistory of certain nuclear zones (the Mediterranean, India, China, Southeast Asia, Central America). At this point we will say that, reduced solely to the archeological documents, and without the light thrown by the texts or traditions of certain agricultural societies (traditions that were still alive at the beginning of this century), the Neolithic religions run the risk of appearing simplistic and monotonous. But the archeological documents present us with a fragmentary, and indeed mutilated, vision of religious life and thought. We have just seen what the religious documents of the earliest Neolithic cultures reveal: cults of the dead and of fertility, indicated by statuettes of goddesses and of the storm god (with his epiphanies: the bull, the bucranium); beliefs and rituals connected with the "mystery" of vegetation; the assimilation woman/cultivated soil/plant, implying the homology birth/ rebirth (initiation); very probably the hope of a postexistence; a cosmology including the symbolism of a "center of the world" and inhabited space as an imago mundi. It is enough to consider a

The disintegration of this civilization begins after 3500 B.C., subsequent to the invasion by the populations of the Pontic steppe (p. 13).



The spiritual edifice of the Neolithic 51
contemporary society ofprimitive cultivators to realize the complexity and richness of a religion articulated around ideas of chthonian fertility and the cycle life-death-postexistence.49 In addition, as soon as the earliest texts come to supplement the archeological documents of the Near East, we see how greatly they reveal a universe of meanings that are not only complex and profound but that have long been meditated on and reinterpreted and, indeed, are sometimes on the way to becoming obscure and almost unintelligible. In some cases the earliest texts available to us represent an approximate recollection of immemorial religious creations that have become outdated or half-forgotten. We must not lose sight of the fact that the grandiose Neolithic spirituality is not "transparent" through the documentation at our disposal. The semantic possibilities of archeological documents are limited, and the earliest texts express a vision of the world that is strongly influenced by the religious ideas bound up with metallurgy, urban civilization, royalty, and an organized priesthood. But if the spiritual edifice of the Neolithic 50 is no longer accessible to us in its entirety, scattered fragments have been preserved in the traditions of peasant societies. The continuity of "sacred places" (cf. § 8) and of certain agricultural and funerary rituals is no longer in need of proof. In twentieth-century Egypt, the ritual sheaf is still tied exactly as we see it on the ancient monuments-where, be it added, a custom inherited from prehistory is reproduced. In Arabia Petraea, the last sheaf is buried under the name of "the Old Man," which is the same name that it bore in the Egypt of the pharaohs. The grain gruel that is offered at funerals and festivals of the dead in Romania and the Balkans is called coliva. The name (kollyba) and the offering are documented in ancient Greece, but the custom is certainly more archaic (it is believed to have been represented in the Dipylon burials). Leopold Schmidt has shown that certain mythicoritual scenarios, still in use among the peasants of central and southeastern Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century, preserve mythological fragments and rituals that had disappeared, in ancient

A comparative analysis of the iconography and symbolism of the ornamental motifs found on vessels and bronze objects can sometimes markedly increase our knowledge of a prehistoric religion; but this is possible only from the time of painted ceramics and, above all, from the Age of Metals. 50. We refer, of course, to the archeological Neolithic of the Near East and Europe.

Greece, before Homer. There is no use extending the list. We would only emphasize that such rites maintained themselves for a period of 4,000 to 5,000 years, of which the last 1,000 to 1,500 were under the vigilant scrutiny of two monotheisms famous for their vigor, Christianity and Islam.
15. Religious context of metallurgy: Mythology of the Iron Age
The "mythology of polished stone" was succeeded by a "mythology of metals" ; the richest and most characteristic was developed around iron. It is known that the archaic preliterate peoples, as well as the prehistoric populations, worked meteoric iron long before they learned to use the ferrous ores occurring on the earth's surface. They treated certain ores like stones, that is, they regarded them as raw material for the manufacture of lithic tools.51 When Cortez asked the Aztec chieftains where they got their knives, they pointed to the sky. And in fact excavations have revealed no trace of terrestrial iron in the prehistoric deposits of the New World:52 The paleo-Oriental peoples presumably held similar ideas. The Sumerian word AN.BAR, the earliest vocable designating iron, is written with the signs "sky" and "fire." It is generally translated as "celestial metal" or "starmetal." For a long period the Egyptians knew only meteoric iron. The same is true of the Hittites: a text of the fourteenth century states that the Hittite kings used "the black iron of the sky." 53 Iron, therefore, was scarce (it was as precious as gold), and its use was principally ritual. It required the discovery of the smelting of ores to inaugurate a new stage in the history of mankind. Unlike copper and bronze, the metallurgy of iron very soon became industrial. Once the secret of smelting magnetite or hematite was discovered, there was no more difficulty in obtaining large quantities of iron, for the deposits were very rich and easy to work. But the treatment of terrestrial ore was not like that of meteoric iron, and it also differed from the smelting of copper and bronze. It was only after the discovery of furnaces, and especially after the perfecting of

Metallurgy and the mythology of the Iron Age S3
the technique of "hardening" metal brought to the white-hot point, that iron achieved its predominant position. It was the metallurgy of terrestrial iron that made this metal fit for everyday use. This fact had important religious consequences. Beside the celestial sacredness of the sky, immanent in meteorites, there is now the telluric sacredness of the earth, in which mines and ores share. Metals "grow" in the bosom of the earth.54 Caves and mines are assimilated to the womb of Mother Earth. The ores extracted from mines are in some sort "embryos." They grow slowly, as if they obey a different temporal rhythm from the life of vegetable and animal organisms; nevertheless, they grow, they "ripen" in the telluric darkness. Hence their extraction from the bosom of Mother Earth is an operation performed prematurely. If they had been given the time to develop (that is, in the geological rhythm of time), ores would have become ripe, "perfect" metals. All over the world miners practice rites involving a state of purity, fasting, meditation, prayers, and cult acts. The rites are governed by the nature of the intended operation, for the performer of them is to introduce himself into a sacred zone, supposedly inviolable; he enters into contact with a sacrality that does not participate in the familiar religious universe, for it is a deeper and also more dangerous sacrality. He has the feeling that he risks entering a domain that does not rightfully belong to man: the underground world with its mysteries of the slow mineralogical gestation that takes place in the womb of Mother Earth. All the mythologies of mines and mountains, the countless fairies, genii, elves, phantoms, and spirits, are the multiple epiphanies of the sacred presence that the individual confronts when he penetrates into the geological levels of Life. Laden with this dark sacraIity, the ores are taken to the furnaces. Then begins the most difficult and the riskiest operation. The artisan takes the place of Mother Earth in order to hasten and perfect the "growth" of the ores. The furnaces are in some sort a new, artificial womb, in which the ore completes its gestation. Hence the countless precautions, taboos, and rituals that accompany smelting.55

55. Ibid., pp. 57 fT. Certain African populations divide ores into "male" and "female"; in ancient China, Yu the Great, the primordial Smelter, distinguished male metals and female metals (ibid., p. 37). In Africa the work of smelting is assimilated to the sexual act (ibid., p. 57).



54 MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC
The metallurgist, like the blacksmith and, before him, the potter, is a "master of fire." It is by means of fire that he brings about the passage of the material from one state to another. As for the metallurgist, he accelerates the "growth" of ores, he makes them "ripe" in a miraculously short time. Smelting proves to be the means of " acting faster" but also of acting to make a different thing from what already existed in nature. This is why, in archaic societies, smelters and smiths are held to be masters of fire, along with shamans, medicine men, and magicians. But the ambivalent character of metal -laden with powers at once sacred and demonic-is transferred to metallurgists and smiths: they are highly esteemed but are also feared, segregated, or even scorned.56 In many mythologies the divine smiths forge the weapons of the gods, thus insuring them victory over dragons or other monstrous beings. In the Canaanite myth, Koshar-wa-Hasis (literally, "Adroitand-Clever") forges for Baal the two clubs with which he will kill Yam, lord of the seas and underground waters (see § 49). In the Egyptian version of the myth, Ptah (the potter god) forges the weapons that enable Horus to conquer Seth. Similarly, the divine smith Tva~tr makes Indra's weapons for his battle with Vrtra; Hephaestus forges the thunderbolt that will enable Zeus to triumph over Typhon (see § 84). But the cooperation between the divine smith and the gods is not confined to his help in the final combat for sovereignty over the world. The smith is also the architect and artisan of the gods, supervises the construction of Baal's palace, and equips the sanctuaries of the other divinities. In addition, this godsmith has connections with music and song, just as in a number of societies the smiths and braziers are also musicians, poets, healers, and magicians.57 It seems, then, that on different levels of culture (an indication of great antiquity) there is an intimate connection between the art of the smith, occult techniques (shamanism, magic, heaJing, etc.), and the arts of song, of the dance, and of poetry. All these ideas and beliefs articulated around the trades of miners, metallurgists, and smiths have markedly enriched the mythology of Homo faber inherited from the Stone Age. But the wish to collaborate in the perfecting of matter had important coasequences. In assuming the responsibility for changing nature, man took the place of time;

what would have required eons to ripen in the subterranean depths, the artisan believes he can obtain in a few weeks; for the furnace replaces the telluric womb. Millennia later, the alchemist will not think differently. A character in Ben Jonson's play The Alchemist declares: "lead and other
metals ... would be gold if they had had time" to become so. And another alchemist adds: "And that our art doth further." 58 The struggle for mastery over time-which will enjoy its greatest success with synthetic products obtained by organic chemistry, a decisive stage in the synthetic preparation of life itself (the homunculus, the old dream of the alchemists)-the struggle to take the place of time that characterizes the man of the modern technological societies, had already begun in the Iron Age. We shall later estimate its religious meanings.

3 The Mesopotamian
Religions
16. "History begins at Sumer"
This is the well-known title of a book by S. N. Kramer. In it, the eminent American Orientalist showed that our earliest information concerning a number of religious institutions, techniques, and conceptions is preserved in Sumerian texts. That is, they represent the earliest written documents, whose originals go back to the third millennium. But these documents certainly reflect more archaic religious beliefs. The origin and early history of Sumerian civilizations are still imperfectly known. It is supposed that a population speaking Sumerian, a language that is not Semitic and cannot be explained by any other known linguistic family, came down from the northern regions and settled in Lower Mesopotamia. Very probably the Sumerians conquered the autochthonous inhabitants, whose ethnic component is still unknown (culturally, they shared in the Obeid civilization; see § 13). Not long afterward, groups of nomads coming from the Syrian desert and speaking a Semitic language, Akkadian, began entering the territories north of Sumer, at the same time infiltrating the Sumerian cities in successive waves. Toward the middle of the third millennium, under a leader who became legendary, Sargon, the Akkadians imposed their supremacy on the Sumerian cities. Yet, even before the conquest, a Sumero-Akkadian symbiosis developed, which was greatly increased by the unification of the two countries. Thirty or forty years ago scholars referred to a single culture, the Babylonian, the result of the fusion of these two ethnic stocks. It is now generally agreed that the Sumerian and Akkadian contributions should be studied separately, for, despite the fact that the invaders



" History begins at Sumer" 57
had assimilated the culture of the defeated people, the creative genius ofthe two was different. It is especially in the religious domain that these differences are perceptible. From the most remote antiquity, the characteristic emblem of divine beings was a horned tiara. At Sumer, then, as everywhere in the Near East, the religious symbolism of the bull, documented from the Neolithic, had been handed down uninterruptedly. In other words, the divine modality was defined by the power and the "transcendence" of space, i.e., the stormy sky in which thunder sounds (for thunder was assimilated to the bellowing of bulls). The "transcendent," celestial structure of divine beings is confirmed by the determinative sign that precedes their ideograms and that originally represented a star. According to the vocabularies, the proper meaning of this determinative is "sky." Hence every divinity was imagined as a celestial being; this is why the gods and goddesses radiated a very bright light. The earliest Sumerian texts reflect the work of classification and systematization accomplished by the priests. First of all is the triad of the great gods, followed by the triad of the planetary gods. We have also been left lengthy lists of divinities of all kinds, concerning whom we very often know nothing but their names. At the dawn of its history, the Sumerian religion already proves to be ancient. To be sure, the texts so far discovered are fragmentary and peculiarly difficult to interpret. However, even on the basis of this sparse information, we can understand that certain religious traditions were in the course of losing their original meanings. The process is perceptible even in the triad of the great gods, made up of An, En-lil, and En-ki. As his name shows (an = sky), the first is a uranian god. He must have been the supreme sovereign god, the most important in the pantheon; but An already presents the syndrome of a deus otiosus. More active and more "actual" are En-lil, god of the atmosphere (also called the "Great Mount"), and En-ki, "Lord of the Earth," god of the "foundations," who has wrongly been taken by modern scholars to be the god of the primordial waters because, in the Sumerian view, the earth was supposed to rest on the ocean. So far, no cosmogonic text properly speaking has been discovered, but some allusions permit us to reconstruct the decisive moments of creation, as the Sumerians conceived it. The goddess Nammu (whose name is written with the pictograph representing the primordial sea)



58 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
is presented as "the mother who gave birth to the Sky and the Earth" and the "ancestress who brought forth all the gods." The theme of the primordial waters, imagined as a totality at once cosmic and divine, is quite frequent in archaic cosmogonies. In this case too, the watery mass is identified with the original Mother, who, by parthenogenesis, gave birth to the first couple, the Sky (An) and the Earth (Ki), incarnating the male and female principles. This first couple was united, to the point of merging, in the hieros gamos. From their union was born En-lil, the god of the atmosphere. Another fragment informs us that the latter separated his parents: the god An carried the sky upward, and En-lil took his mother, the Earth, with him.1 The cosmogonic theme of the separation of sky and earth is also widely disseminated. It is found, indeed, at different levels of culture. But probably the version recorded in the Near East and the Mediterranean derive, in the last analysis, from the Sumerian tradition. Certain texts describe the perfection and bliss of the" beginnings" : "the ancient days when each thing was created perfect," etc.2 However, the true Paradise seems to be Dilmun, a country in which neither illness nor death exists. There "no lion kills, no wolf carries off a lamb.... No man with eye disease repeats: 'My eyes are sick.' ... No night watchman walks about his post." 3 Yet, all in all, this perfection was a stagnation. For the god En-ki, the Lord of Dilmun, lay asleep beside his wife, who was still a virgin, as the earth itself was virgin. When he woke, En-ki united with the goddess Nin-gursag, then with the daughter whom the latter bore, and finally with the daughter's daughter-for this is a theogony that must be completed in this paradisalland. But an apparently insignificant incident occasions the first divine drama. The god eats certain plants that had just been created; but he was supposed to "determine their destiny," that is, to settle their mode of being and their function. Outraged by this senseless act, Nin-gur-sag declares that she will no longer look on En-ki with the "look of life," and thus he will die. And in fact

Man before his gods 59
unknown ills afflict the god, and his increasing weakness presages his speedy death. Finally, it is his wife who cures him.4 As it has been possible to reconstruct it, this myth shows instances of rehandling, the purpose of which cannot be determined. The paradisal theme, completed by a theogony, ends in a drama that reveals the crime and punishment of a creator god, followed by an increasing weakness that portends his death. Certainly, a fatal fault is involved, for En-ki did not behave in accordance with the principle that he incarnated. This fault came near to compromising the structure of his own creation. Other texts have preserved the lamentations of the gods when they fall victims to fate. And we shall later see the risks run by Inanna in going beyond the frontiers of her sovereignty. What is surprising in the drama of En-ki is not the mortal nature of the gods but the mythological context in which it is proclaimed.
17. Man before his gods
There are at least four Sumerian narratives that explain the origin of man. They are so different that we must assume a plurality of traditions. One myth relates that the first human beings sprouted from the ground like the plants. According to another version, man was fashioned from clay by certain divine artisans; then the goddess Nammu modeled a heart for him, and En-ki gave him life. Other texts name the goddess Aruru as the creator of human beings. Finally, according to the fourth version, man was formed from the blood of two Uigma gods immolated for the purpose. This last theme will be reviv~d and reinterpreted in the famous Babylonian cosmogonic poem, Enuma elish (§ 21). All these motifs, with numerous variants, are documented more or less throughout the world. According to two of the Sumerian versions, the primitive man shared in a way in the divine substance: in En-ki's vital breath or in the blood of the Lagma gods. This means that there was no impassable distance between the divine mode of being and the human condition. It is true that man was created in order to serve the gods, who, first of all, needed to be fed and clothed.5

Ancient Mesopotamia, pp. 183 ff.



60 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
The cult was conceived of as service to the gods. However, if men are the gods' servants, they are not their slaves. The sacrifice consisted primarily in offerings and homage. As for the great collective festivals of the city-celebrated at the New Year or at the building of a temple -they have a cosmological structure. Raymond Jestin emphasizes the fact that the notion of sin, the expiatory element, and the idea of the scapegoat are not documented in the texts.6 This implies that men are not only servants of the gods but are also their imitators and hence th,ir collaborators. Since the gods are responsible for the cosmic order, men must obey their commands, for these are based on the norms-the "decrees," mewhich insure the functioning both of the world and of human society.7 These decrees establish, that is, determine, the destiny of every being, of every form of life, of every divine or human enterprise. The determination of the decrees is accomplished by the act of nam-tar, which constitutes, and proclaims, the decision taken. At each New Year the gods fix the destiny of the following twelve months. This, to be sure, is an old idea, found elsewhere in the Near East; but the first strictly articulated expression of it is Sumerian and shows the deep work of investigation and systematization performed by the theologians. The cosmic order is continually troubled, first of all by the Great Serpent, which threatens to reduce the world to chaos, and then by men's crimes, faults, and errors, which must be expiated and purged by the help of various rites. But the world is periodically regenerated, i.e., re-created, by the festival of the New Year. "The Sumerian name of this festival, a-ki-til, means 'power making the world live again' (til means 'live' and 'live again'; thus a sick man 'lives [again],' that is, is cured); the whole cycle of the law of eternal return is evoked." 8 More or less similar mythico-ritual scenarios of the New Year are

On the me of the different trades, vocations, and institutions, see Kramer, From the Tablets, pp. 89 ff.; The Sumerians, pp. 117 ff. The term me has been translated by "being" (Jacobsen) or "divine power" (Landsberger and Falkenstein) and has been interpreted as a "divine immanence in dead and living matter, unchangeable, subsistent, but impersonal, to which only the gods have access" (J. van Dijk). 8. Jestin," La religion sumerienne," p. 181.



Man before his gods 61
documented in countless cultures. We shall have occasion to gauge their importance when we analyze the Babylonian festival akitu (§ 22). The scenario involves the hieros gamos between two patron divinities of the city, represented by their statues or by the sovereign (who received the title of husband of the goddess Inanna and incarnated Dumuzi)9 and a hierodule. This hieros gamos actualized the communion between the gods and men-a momentary communion, to be sure, but with considerable consequences. For the divine energy flowed directly upon the city (that is, upon the Earth), sanctified it, and insured its prosperity and happiness for the beginning year. Still more important than the New Year festival was the one associated with the building of a temple. It was no less a reiteration of the cosmogony, for the temple-the "palace" of the godrepresented the most perfect imago mundi. The idea is archaic and widely disseminated. (We shall find it in the myth of Baal, § 50.) According to the Sumerian tradition, after the creation of man, one of the gods founded the five cities; he built them "in pure places, called their names, apportioned them as cult centers."lO Since that time the gods have contented themselves with imparting the plans of cities and sanctuaries directly to the sovereigns. In a dream King Gudea sees both the goddess Nidaba showing him a placard on which the beneficent stars are named and a god revealing the plan of the temple to him.ll The models of the temple and the city are, we might say, "transcendental," for they preexist in the sky. The Babylonian cities had their archetypes in the constellations: Sippar in Cancer, Niniveh in the Great Bear, Assur in Arcturus, etc.12 This concept is general in the ancient East. The institution of kingship was similarly "lowered from the sky," together with its emblems, the tiara and the throne.13 After the flood, it was brought down to earth for the second time. The belief in the preexistence of words and institutions will have considerable importance for archaic ontology and will find its most famous

expression in the Platonic doctrine of Ideas. It is attested for the first time in Sumerian documents, but its roots presumably reach down into prehistory. Indeed, the theory of celestial models continues and develops the universally disseminated archaic conception that man's acts are only the repetition (imitation) of acts revealed by divine beings.
18. The first myth of the flood
Royalty had to be brought down from the sky again after the flood, for the diluvial catastrophe was equivalent to the end of the world. In fact, only a single human being, named Zisudra in the Sumerian version and Utnapishtim in the Akkadian, was saved. But, unlike Noah, he was not allowed to live on in the new earth that emerged from the waters. More or less divinized, but in any case enjoying immortality, the survivor is transported to the land of Dilmun (Zisudra) or to the" mouth of the rivers" (Utnapishtim). From the few fragments of the Sumerian version that have come down to us we learn that, despite the reluctance or the opposition of some members of the pantheon, the great gods decide to destroy humanity by the flood. Someone mentions the merits of King Zisudra, "humble, obedient, pious." Informed by his protector, Zisudra learns of the decision reached by An and En-lil. The text is here interrupted by a long lacuna. Probably Zisudra received exact instructions for building the ark. After seven days and seven nights the sun comes out again, and Zisudra prostrates himself before the sun god, Utu. In the last fragment that has been preserved, An and En-lil confer on him "the life of a god" and the "eternal breath" of the gods and send him to live in the fabulous land of Dilmun.14 The same theme of the Deluge is found in the Epic of Gilgamesh. This famous work, which has been fairly well preserved, casts still greater light on the similarities to the biblical narrative. In all probability, we may assume the existence of a common, and quite archaic, source. As has been well known since the compilations made by R. Andree, H. Usener, and J. G. Frazer, the deluge myth is almost universally disseminated; it is documented in all the continents

(though very rarely in Africa) and on various cultural levels. A certain number of variants seem to be the result of dissemination, first from Mesopotamia and then from India. It is equally possible that one or several diluvial catastrophes gave rise to fabulous narratives. But it would be risky to explain so widespread a myth by phenomena of which no geological traces have been found. The majority of the flood myths seem in some sense to form part of the cosmic rhythm: the old world, peopled by a fallen humanity, is submerged under the waters, and some time later a new world emerges from the aquatic "chaos."15 In a large number of variants, the flood is the result of the sins (or ritual faults) of human beings: sometimes it results simply from the wish of a divine being to put an end to mankind. It is difficult to determine the cause of the flood in the Mesopotamian tradition. Some allusions suggest that the gods reached the decision because of "sinners." According to another, En-liI's anger was aroused by the intolerable "uproar" made by human beings.16 However, if we examine the myths that, in other cultures, announce the coming flood, we find that the chief causes lie at once in the sins of men and the decrepitude of the world. By the mere fact that it exists-that is, that it lives and produces-the cosmos gradually deteriorates and ends by falling into decay. This is the reason why it has to be recreated. In other words, the flood realizes, on the macrocosmic scale, what is symbolically effected during the New Year festival: the "end of the world" and the end of a sinful humanity in order to make a new creation possible.17

and oflove. The gods of the Moon and the Sun will have their apogee during the Babylonian period. As for Inanna, homologized with the Akkadian Ishtar and later with Ashtarte, she will enjoy an "actuality" in both cult and mythology never approached by any other goddess of the Near East. At her apogee, Inanna-Ishtar was the goddess at once of love and of war, that is, she governed life and death; to indicate the fullness of her powers, she was called hermaphroditic (Ishtar barbata). Her personality was already fully outlined in the Sumerian period, and her central myth constitutes one of the most significant creations of the ancient world. The myth begins with a love story: Inanna, the tutelary goddess of Erech, marries the shepherd Dumuzi,18 who thus becomes sovereign of the city. Inanna proclaims her passion and her happiness aloud: "I, in joy I walk! ... My Lord is seemly for the sacred lap." Yet she has a presentiment of the tragic fate that awaits her husband: "My beloved, my man of the heart ... thee, I have brought about an evil for you ... you have touched your mouth to mine, you have pressed my lips to your head, that is why you have been decreed an evil fate" (Kramer, "Le rite de mariage sacre," p. 141). This "evil fate" was decided on the day when the ambitious Inanna determined to go down into the underworld to supplant her "elder sister," Ereshkigal. Sovereign of the Great Above, Inanna aspires also to reign over the World Below. She manages to enter Ereshkigal's palace, but, as she successively passes through the Seven Gates, the gatekeepers strip her of her clothes and ornaments. Inanna arrives stark naked-that is, stripped of all "power"-in her sister's presence. Ereshkigal fixes the" look of death" on her, and" her body became inert." After three days, her devoted friend Ninshubur, obeying the instructions that Inanna had given her before setting out, informs the gods En-lil and Nanna-Sin. But they decline to intervene, because Inanna, they say, by entering a domain-the Land of the Dead-which is governed by inviolable decrees, "sought to meddle with forbidden things." However, En-lil finds a solution: he creates two messengers and sends them to the underworld carrying "the

food of life" and "the water of life." By a trick, they succeed in reviving "the corpse, which was hanging from a nail." Inanna was preparing to ascend, when the Seven Judges of the Underworld (the Anunaki) held her back, saying: "Who, having descended into the underworld, has ever ascended from the underworld again unharmed? If Inanna wishes to ascend out of the underworld, let her furnish a replacement!"19 Inanna returns to earth escorted by a troop of demons, the gal/as; they are to bring her back if she does not furnish them with another divine being. The demons first try to seize Ninshubur, but Inanna stops them. Next they all go to the cities of Umma and Bad-Tibira; terrified, their tutelary divinities crawl in the dust at Inanna's feet, and the goddess pities them and decides to search elsewhere. Finally they arrive at Erech. In surprise and indignation, Inanna discovers that, instead of lamenting, Dumuzi was sitting on his throne, richly clad-satisfied, it almost seemed, to be sole sovereign of the city. "She fixed an eye on him: the eye of death! She spoke a word against him: the word of despair! She cried out against him: the cry of damnation! 'This one (she said to the demons), carry him away.'"20 Dumuzi implores his brother-in-law, the sun god Utu, to change him into a snake, and flees to the house of his sister, Geshtinanna, then to his sheepfold. There the demons seize him, torture him, and lead him to the underworld. A lacuna in the text prevents us from reading the epilogue. "In all probability, it is Ereshkigal who, softened by Dumuzi's tears, lightens his sad fate by deciding that he should spend only half the year in the netherworld and that his sister, Geshtinanna, should replace him during the other half" (Kramer, "Le rite de mariage sacre," p. 144). The same myth, but with some significant differences, is narrated in the Akkadian version of the Descent of Ishtar to the Underworld. Before the publication and translation of the Sumerian texts, it was possible to believe that the goddess journeyed to the "Land without return" after the" death" of Tammuz and precisely in order to bring him back. Certain elements that are absent in the Sumerian version

In another version, it is fear that seems to explain lnanna's action. When the demons seized her and were threatening to take her back, "Terrified, she abandons Dumuzi to them! 'This young man' (she says to them), 'chain his feet' "(ibid.).



66 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
seemed to support this interpretation-in the first place, the disastrous consequences of Ishtar's captivity, which are emphasized in the Akkadian version: human and animal reproduction ended entirely after the goddess's disappearance. This calamity was understandable as following upon the interruption of the hieros gamos between the goddess of love and fertility and Tammuz, her beloved husband. The catastrophe was of cosmic proportions, and, in the Akkadian version, it is the great gods who, terrified by the imminent disappearance of life, had to intervene to free Ishtar. What is surprising in the Sumerian version is the "psychological," that is, human, justification for the condemnation of Dumuzi: everything seems to be explained by Inanna's anger at finding her husband proudly seated on his throne. This romantic explanation appears to overlie a more archaic idea: " death "-ritual and therefore reversible-inevitably follows every act of creation or procreation. The kings of Sumer, like the Akkadian kings later, incarnate Dumuzi in the hieros gamos with Inanna.21 This, to a greater or lesser degree, implies acceptance of the ritual "death" of the king. In this case, we must suppose, behind the story transmitted by the Sumerian text, a "mystery" established by Inanna to insure the cycle of universal fertility. It is possible to perceive an allusion to this "mystery" in Gilgamesh's scornful answer when Ishtar invites him to become her husband: he reminds her that it is she who decreed the yearly lamentations for Tammuz.22 But these lamentations were ritual: the young god's descent to the underworld was bewailed on the eighteenth of the month of Tammuz (June-July), though everyone knew that he would rise again six months later. The cult of Tammuz is disseminated more or less everywhere in the Middle East. In the sixth century, Ezekiel (8 :14) cried out against the women who wept for him even at the gates of the Temple. Tammuz ends by taking on the dramatic and elegiac figure of the young gods who die and are resurrected annually. But his Sumerian prototype probably had a more complex structure: the kings who incarnated him, and who therefore shared his fate, annually celebrated the re-creation of the world. But in order to be re-created

The Sumero-Akkadian synthesis 67
anew, the world had to be annihilated; the precosmogonic chaos also implied the ritual death of the king, his descent to the underworld. In short, the two cosmic modalities-life/death, chaos/cosmos, sterility/fertility-constituted the two moments of a single process. This" mystery," perceived after the discovery of agriculture, becomes the principle of a unified explanation of the world, of life, and of human existence; it transcends the vegetable drama, since it also governs the cosmic rhythms, human destiny, and relations with the gods. The myth relates the defeat of the goddess of love and fertility in her attempt to conquer the kingdom of Ereshkigal, that is, to abolish death. In consequence, men, as well as certain gods, have to accept the alternation life/death. Dumuzi-Tammuz disappears, to reappear six months later. This alternation-periodical presence and absence of the god-was able to institute "mysteries" concerning the salvation of men, their destiny after death. The role of DumuziTammuz, ritually incarnated by the Sumero-Akkadian kings, was considerable, for it effected a connection between the divine and human modalities. Eventually, every human being could hope to enjoy this privilege, previously reserved for kings.
20. The Sumero-Akkadian synthesis
The majority of the Sumerian city-temples were united by Lugalzaggisi, the sovereign of Umma, about 2375 B.C. This is the first manifestation of the imperial idea of which we have any knowledge. A generation later the attempt was repeated, with greater success, by Sargon, king of Akkad. But Sumerian civilization preserved all its structures. The change concerned only the kings of the city-temples: they acknowledged themselves to be tributaries to the Akkadian conqueror. Sargon's empire collapsed after a century, as the result of attacks by the Gutians, barbarians who led a nomadic existence in the region of the Upper Tigris. Thereafter, the history of Mesopotamia seems to repeat itself: the political unity of Sumer and Akkad is destroyed by barbarians from without; in their turn,.these are overthrown by internal revolts.
Thus, the domination of the Gutians lasted only a century, and was replaced, for another century (ca. 2050-1950 B.C.), by the kings of the



68 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
third dynasty of Ur. It is during this period that Sumerian civilization attained its culminating point. But it was also the last manifestation of Sumerian political power. Harassed by the Elamites on the east and, on the west, by the Amorites, who came from the Syro-Arabian desert, the empire fell. For more than two centuries Mesopotamia remained divided into several states. It was not until about 1700 B.C. that Hammurabi, the Amorite sovereign of Babylon, succeeded in imposing unity. He fixed the center of the empire farther north, in the city of which he was the sovereign. The dynasty founded by Hammurabi, which appeared to be all-powerful, reigned for less than a century. Other barbarians, the Kassites, come down from the north and begin to harass the Amorites. Finally, about 1525 B.C., they triumph. They will remain the masters of Mesopotamia for four centuries.
The transformation of the city-temples to city-states and then to the empire represents a phenomenon of considerable importance in the history of the Near East.23 For our purpose, it is important to cite the fact that the Sumerian language, though it ceased to be spoken about 2000 B.C., retained its function as the liturgical language and, indeed, as the language of knowledge for fifteen more centuries. Other liturgical languages will have a similar destiny: Sanskrit, Hebrew, Latin, Old Slavic. Sumerian religious conservatism is carried on in the Akkadian structures. The supreme triad remained the same: An, En-lil, Ea (= En-ki). The astral triad partly takes over the Semitic names of the respective divinities: the Moon, Sin (which derives from the Sumerian Suen); the Sun, Shamash; the planet Venus, Ishtar (= Inanna). The underworld continued to be governed by Ereshkigal and her husband, Nergal. The few changes, imposed by the needs of the empire-for example, the transfer of religious primacy to Babylon and the replacement of En-lil by Marduk"took centuries to come about." 24 As for the temple, "nothing essential changed in its general plan ... from the Sumerian phase on, except perhaps the size and number of buildings." 25 Nevertheless, the contributions of the Semitic religious genius are added to the earlier structures. A first example is that of the two "national" gods-Marduk of Babylon and, later, the Assyrian

are first documented; in the course of time they will be adopted by other states. 24. Jean Nougayrol, "La religion babylonienne," p. 217.

The Sumero-Akkadian synthesis 69
Assur-who are raised to the rank of universal divinities. Equally significant is the importance assumed in the cult by personal prayers and penitential psalms. One of the most beautiful Babylonian prayers is addressed to all the gods, even to those whom the speaker of the prayer admits that he does not know: "0 Lord, ... great are my sins. 0 god whom I do not know, great are my sins.... 0 goddess whom I do not know, great are my sins.... Man knows nothing; whether he is committing sin or doing good, he does not even know.... 0 my Lord, do not cast thy servant down. My transgressions are seven times seven; remove my transgressions." 26 In the penitential psalms the speaker acknowledges his guilt and confesses his sins aloud. The confession is accompanied by precise liturgical gestures: kneeling, prostration, and "flattening the nose." The great gods-An, En-lil, and Ea-gradually lose their supremacy in the cult. The worshipers address themselves rather to Marduk or to the astral divinities, Ishtar and especially Shamash. In the course of time the latter will become the unrivaled universal divinity. A hymn proclaims that the sun god is revered everywhere, even among foreigners; Shamash defends justice, he punishes the wrongdoer and rewards the just.27 The numinous character of the gods increases: they inspire a holy fear, especially by their terrifying brightness. Light is considered to be the particular attribute of divinity, and, insofar as the king shares in the divine condition, he himself emanates rays of light.26 Another creation of Akkadian religious thought is divination. We also note a multiplication of magical practices and the development of the occult disciplines (especially astrology), which will later become popular throughout the Asiatic and Mediterranean world. In short, the Semitic contribution is characterized by the importance accorded to the personal element in religious experience and by the exaltation of certain divinities to a supreme rank. Yet this new and grandiose Mesopotamian synthesis presents a tragic view of human existence.

70 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
21. Creation of the world
The cosmogonic poem known as the Enuma elish (after its incipit: "When on high") constitutes, with the Epic of Gilgamesh, the most important creation of the Akkadian religion. Nothing comparable in greatness, in dramatic tension, in its effort to connect the theogony, the cosmogony, and the creation of man, is to be found in Sumerian literature. The Enuma elish narrates the origin of the world in order to exalt Marduk. Despite their being reinterpreted, the themes are ancient: first of all, the primordial image of an undifferentiated aquatic totality, in which the first couple, Apsu and Tiamat, can be discerned. (Other sources specify that Tiamat represents the sea, and Apsu the mass of fresh water on which the earth floats.) Like so many other original divinities, Tiamat is conceived of as at once woman and bisexual. From the mixture of fresh and salt waters other divine couples are born. Almost nothing is known about the second couple, Lakhmu and Lakhamu (according to one tradition they were sacrificed in order to create man). As for the third couple, Anshar and Kishar, their names in Sumerian mean "totality of the upper elements" and "totality of the lower elements." Time passes (" the days stretched out, the years multiplied").29 From the hieros gamos of these two complementary "totalities" is born the god of the sky, Anu, who in his turn engenders Nudimmud (= Ea).30 By their play and their cries these young gods trouble Apsu's repose. He complains to Tiamat: "Unbearable to me is their behavior. By day, I cannot rest; by night, I cannot sleep. I want to annihilate them, in order to put an end to their doings. And let silence reign for us, at last we can sleep!" (tablet 1, lines 37-39). We can read in these lines the nostalgia of matter (that is, of a mode of being corresponding to the inertia and unconsciousness of substance) for the primordial immobility, the resistance to all movement-the preliminary condition for the cosmogony. Tiamat "began to cry out against her husband. She gave a cry of pain ... : 'What! We shall ourselves destroy what we have created! Painful, to be sure, is their

Creation of the world 71
behavior, but let us be patient and mild'" (1. 41-46). But Apsu would not be persuaded. When the young gods learned of their ancestor's decision, "they were left speechless" (58). But the "all-knowing Ea" set to work. With his magical incantations, he makes Apsu sink into a deep sleep, he takes away "his brightness and clothes himself in it," and, after binding him, kills him. Ea thus became the god of the Waters, which he thenceforth named apsu. It is in the depths of the apsu, "in the chamber of destinies, the sanctuary of archetypes" (79), that his wife, Damkina, gave birth to Marduk. The text exalts the gigantic majesty, the wisdom, and the omnipotence of this last-born of the gods. It is then that Anu resumes the attack on his ancestors. He caused the four winds to rise and "created the waves to trouble Tiamat" (l08). The gods, deprived of rest, turn to their mother: "When they killed Apsu, thy spouse, far from walking at his side, thou didst remain apart without a word" (113-14). This time, Tiamat decided to react. She formed monsters, snakes, the "great lion," "raging demons," and yet others, "pitiless bearers of arms, unafraid of battle" (144). And "among the gods, her firstborn, ... she exalted Kingu" (147 f.). Tiamat fastened to Kingu's chest the tablet of Destinies and bestowed the supreme power on him (144 if.). Faced with these preparations, the young gods lose courage. Neither Anu nor Ea dares to confront Kingu. It is only Marduk who accepts the battle, but on condition that he should first be proclaimed supreme god, which the gods hasten to grant. The battle between the two troops is decided by a single combat between Tiamat and Marduk. "When Tiamat opened her maw to swallow him" (4. 97), Marduk hurled the raging winds, which "dilated her body. She was left with her belly swollen and her mouth gaping. He then loosed an arrow, which perforated her belly, tore her entrails, and pierced her heart. Having thus overcome her, he took her life, threw the corpse on the ground, and stood on it" (100-104). Tiamat's partisans tried to escape, but Marduk "bound them and broke their weapons" (111); he then chained Kingu, snatched the tablet of Destinies from him, and fastened it to his own chest (120 if.). Finally, he returned to Tiamat, split her skull, and cut the corpse in two, "like a dried fish" (137); one half became the vault of the sky, the other half the earth. Marduk set up in the sky a replica of the palace of the apsu and fixed the courses of the stars. The fifth tablet reports the organization of



72 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
the planetary universe, the determination of time, and the configuration of the earth from Tiamat's organs (from her eyes flow the Euphrates and the Tigris, "from a loop of her tail he created the link between sky and earth" [5. 59]; etc.). Finally, Marduk decides to create man, so that" on him shall rest the service of the gods, for their relief" (6. 8). The conquered and chained gods were still awaiting their punishment. Ea suggests that only one of them shall be sacrificed. Asked who "fomented war, incited Tiamat to revolt, and began the battle" (23-24), all give but one name: Kingu. His veins are cut, and from his blood Ea creates mankind (30).31 The poem then relates the building of a sanctuary (i.e., his palace) in honor of Marduk. While using traditional mythological themes, the Enuma elish presents a rather somber cosmogony and a pessimistic anthropology. To exalt the young champion, Marduk, the gods of the primordial epoch, and most of all Tiamat, are charged with demonic values. Tiamat is no longer merely the primitive chaotic totality that precedes any cosmogony; she ends by proving to be the producer of countless monsters. Her "creativity" is thus wholly negative. As it is described in the Enuma elish, the creative process is very soon endangered by Apsu's wish to annihilate the young gods, that is, in the last analysis, to stop the creation of the universe in the bud. (A certain "world" already existed, since the gods were multiplying and had" dwellings" ; but it was a purely formal mode of being.) The killing of Apsu opens the series of "creative murders," for Ea not only takes his place but also begins a first organization in the aquatic mass (" in this place he established his dwelling place ... he determined the sanctuaries "). The cosmogony is the result of a conflict between two groups of gods, but Tiamat's troop also includes her monstrous and demonic creatures. In other words, "primordiality" as such is presented as the source of "negative creations." It is from Tiamat's remains that Marduk forms the sky and the earth. This theme, which is also documented in other traditions, can be variously interpreted. The universe, made from the body of an original divinity, shares in its substance. But, after the "demonization" of Tiamat, can one still speak of a substance that is divine? Hence the cosmos has a double nature; it consists of an ambivalent,
31. We will add that other parallel traditions concerning the cosmology and the creation of man also exist.



Sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign 73
if not frankly demonic, matter and a divine form, for it is the work of Marduk. The celestial vault is formed from one half of Tiamat's body, but the stars and constellations become" dwellings" or images of the gods. The earth itself comprises the other half of Tiamat and her various organs, but it is sanctified by the cities and temples. In the last analysis, the world proves to be the result of a mingling of chaotic and demonic primordiality on the one hand with divine creativity, presence, and wisdom on the other. This is perhaps the most complex cosmogonic formula arrived at by Mesopotamian speculation, for it combines in a daring synthesis all the structures of a divine society, some of which had become incomprehensible or unusable. As for the creation of man, it continues the Sumerian tradition (man is created to serve the gods), particularly the version that explains his origin from the two sacrificed Lagma gods. But it adds this aggravating element: Kingu, despite his having been one of the first gods, became the archdemon, the leader of the troop of monsters and demons created by Tiamat. Hence man is made from a demonic substance: the blood of Kingu. The difference from the Sumerian versions is significant. We can speak of a tragic pessimism, for man seems to be already condemned by his own origin. His only hope lies in the fact that it is Ea who fashioned him; hence he possesses a form created by a great god. From this point of view, there is a symmetry between the creation of man and the origin of the world. In both cases, the raw material is constituted by the substance of a fallen primordial divinity, demonized and put to death by the victorious young gods.
22. Sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign
At Babylon the Enuma elish was recited in the temple on the fourth day of the New Year festival. This festival, named zagmuk (" beginning of the year") in Sumerian and akitu in Akkadian, took place during the first twelve days of the month of Nisan. It comprised several sequences, of which we will mention the most important: (1) a day of expiation for the king, corresponding to Marduk's "captivity"; (2) the freeing of Marduk; (3) ritual combats and a triumphal procession, led by the king, to the Bit Akitu (the house of the New Year festival), where a banquet was held; (4) the hieros



74 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
gamos of the king with a hierodule personifying the goddess; and (5) the determination of destinies by the gods. The first sequence of this mythico-ritual scenario-the king's humiliation and Marduk's captivity-indicates the regression of the world to the precosmogonic chaos. In the sanctuary of Marduk the high priest stripped the king of his emblems (scepter, ring, scimitar, and crown) and struck him in the face. Then, on his knees, the king uttered a declaration of innocence: "I have not sinned, 0 lord of the lands, I have not been negligent regarding thy divinity." The high priest, speaking in Marduk's name, replied: "Do not fear.... Marduk will hear thy prayer. He will increase thy dominion." 32 During this time the people sought for Marduk, supposed to be "shut up in the mountain" (a formula indicating the "death" of a divinity). As we saw in the case of Inanna-Ishtar, this "death" was not final; yet she had to be redeemed from the lower world. Similarly, Marduk was made to descend "far from the sun and light."33 Finally, he was delivered, and the gods assembled (that is, their statues were brought together) to determine the destinies. (This episode corresponds, in the Enuma elish, to Marduk's advancement to the rank of supreme god.) The king led the procession to the Bit Akitu, a building situated outside of the city. The procession represented the army of the gods advancing against Tiamat. According to an inscription of Sennacherib, we may suppose that the primordial battle was mimed, the king personifying Assur (the god who had replaced Marduk).34 The hieros gamos took place after the return from the banquet at the Bit Akitu. The last act consisted in the determination of the destinies 35 for each month of the year. By " determining" it, the year was ritually created, that is, the good fortune, fertility, and richness of the new world that had just been born were insured. The akitu represents the Mesopotamian version of a quite wide

Sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign 75
spread mythico-ritual scenario, specifically of the New Year festival considered as a repetition of the cosmogony.3S Since the periodic regeneration of the cosmos constitutes the great hope of traditional societies, we shall often refer to New Year festivals. We will mention at this point that various episodes of the akitu are found (to confine ourselves to the Near East) in Egypt, among the Hittites, at Ugarit, in Iran, and among the Mandaeans. Thus, for example, "chaos," ritually actualized during the last days of the year, was signified by orgiastic excesses of the Saturnalia type, by the reversal of all social order, by the extinguishing of fires, and by the return of the dead (represented by maskers). Combats between two groups of actors are documented in Egypt, among the Hittites, and at Ugarit. The custom of "fixing the fates" of the twelve months during the twelve intercalary days still persists in the Near East and in eastern Europe.37 The role of the king in the akitu is inadequately known. His "humiliation" corresponds to the regression of the world to chaos and to Marduk's captivity in the mountain. The king personifies the god in the battle against Tiamat and in the hieros gamos with a hierodule. But identification with the god is not always indicated; as we have seen, during his "humiliation" the king addresses Marduk. Nevertheless, the sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign is amply documented. We have mentioned the sacred marriage of the Sumerian king, representing Dumuzi, to the goddess Inanna; this hieros gamos took place during the New Year festival (§ 19). For the Sumerians, royalty was held to have descended from the sky; its origin was divine, and this conception remained in force until the disappearance of the Assyro-Babylonian civilization. The sovereign's sacrality was proclaimed in many ways. He was called "king of the land" (that is, of the world) or "of the four regions of the universe," titles originally appertaining to the gods alone.3s Just as in the case of the gods, a supernatural light shone from his head.39 Even before his birth, the gods had predestined him to sovereignty. Though the king recognized his earthly begetting, he was considered a "son of god" (Hammurabi declares that he was

76 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
begotten by Sin, and Lipitishtar by En-lil). This twofold descent made him supremely the intermediary between gods and men. The sovereign represented the people before the gods, and it was he who expiated the sins of his subjects. Sometimes he had to suffer death for his people's crimes; this is why the Assyrians had a "substitute for the king." 40 The texts proclaim that the king had lived in fellowship with the gods in the fabulous garden that contains the Tree of Life and the Water of Life.41 (Actually, it is he and his courtiers who eat the food offered daily to the statues of the gods.) The king is the "envoy" of the gods, the "shepherd of the people," named by god to establish justice and peace on earth.42 "When Anu and En-lil called Lipit-Ishtar to the government of the land in order to establish justice in the land ... , then I, Lipit-Ishtar, the humble shepherd of Nippur ... , established justice in Sumer and Akkad, in accordance with the word of En-liI." 43 It could be said that the king shared in the divine modality, but without becoming a god. He represented the god, and this, on the archaic levels of culture, also implied that he was in a way he whom he personified. In any case, as mediator between the world of men and the world of the gods, the Mesopotamian king effected, in his own person, a ritual union between the two modalities of existence, the divine and the human. It was by virtue of this twofold nature that the king was considered, at least metaphorically, to be the creator of life and fertility. But he was not a god, a new member of the pantheon (as the Egyptian pharaoh was; cf. § 27). Prayers were not addressed to him; on the contrary, the gods were implored to protect him. For the sovereigns, despite their intimacy with the divine world, despite the hieros gamos with certain goddesses, did not reach the point of transmuting the human condition. In the last analysis, they remained mortals. It was never forgotten that even the fabled king of Uruk, Gilgamesh, failed in his attempt to gain immortality.

Gilgamesh in quest of immortality 77
23. Gilgamesh in quest of immortality
The Epic of Gilgamesh is certainly the best known and most popular of Babylonian creations. Its hero, Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, was already famous in the archaic period, and the Sumerian version of several episodes from his legendary life has been found. Despite these antecedents, however, the Epic of Gilgamesh is a product of the Semitic genius. It is in the Akkadian version in which it was composed on the basis of various isolated episodes that we may read one of the most moving tales of the quest for immortality or, more precisely, of the final failure of an undertaking that seemed to have every possibility of succeeding. This saga, which begins with the erotic excesses of a hero who is at the same time a tyrant, reveals, in the last analysis, the inability of purely "heroic" virtues radically to transcend the human condition. And yet Gilgamesh was two-thirds a divine being, son of the goddess Ninsun and a mortal.44 At the outset the text praises his omniscience and the grandiose works of construction that he had undertaken. But immediately afterward we are presented with a tyrant who violates women and girls and wears men out in forced labor. The inhabitants pray to the gods, and the gods decide to create a being of gigantic size who can confront Gilgamesh. This half-savage creature, who receives the name of Enkidu, lives in peace with the wild beasts; they all drink together at the same springs. Gilgamesh obtains knowledge of his existence first in a dream and then from a hunter who had come upon him. He sends a courtesan to bewitch him by her charms and lead him to Uruk. As the gods had foreseen, the two champions compete as soon as they meet each other. Gilgamesh emerges victorious, but he conceives an affection for Enkidu and makes him his companion. In the last analysis, the gods' plan was not foiled; henceforth Gilgamesh will expend his strength on heroic adventures. Accompanied by Enkidu, he sets out for the distant and fabulous forest of cedars, which is guarded by a monstrous and all-powerful being, Huwawa. After cutting down his sacred cedar, the two heroes kill him. On his way back to Uruk, Ishtar sees Gilgamesh. The goddess invites him to marry her, but he returns an insolent refusal.

78 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
Humiliated, Ishtar begs her father, Anu, to create the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh and his city. Anu at first refuses, but he gives in when Ishtar threatens to bring the dead back from the underworld. The Bull of Heaven charges at Uruk, and its bellowings make the king's men drop dead by hundreds. However, Enkidu succeeds in catching it by the tail, and Gilgamesh thrusts his sword into its neck. Furious, Ishtar mounts the city walls and curses the king. Intoxicated by their victory, Enkidu tears a thigh from the Bull of Heaven and throws it at the goddess's feet, at the same time assailing her with insults. This is the culminating moment in the career of the two heroes, but it is also the prologue to a tragedy. That same night Enkidu dreams that he has been condemned by the gods. The next day he falls ill, and, twelve days later, he dies. An unexpected change makes Gilgamesh unrecognizable. For seven days and seven nights he mourns for his friend and refuses to let him be buried. He hopes that his laments will finally bring him back to life. It is not until the body shows the first signs of decomposition that Gilgamesh yields, and Enkidu is given a magnificent funeral. The king leaves the city and wanders through the desert, complaining: "Shall not I, too, die like Enkidu?" (tablet 9, column 1, line 4).45 He is terrified by the thought of death. Heroic exploits do not console him. Henceforth his only purpose is to escape from the human condition, to gain immortality. He knows that the famous Utnapishtim, survivor of the flood, is still alive, and he decides to search for him. His journey is full of ordeals of the initiatory type. He comes to the mountains of Mashu and finds the gate through which the Sun passes daily. The gate is guarded by a scorpion-man and his wife, "whose glance is death" (9. 2. 7). The invincible hero is paralyzed by fear and prostrates himself humbly. But the scorpion-man and his wife recognize the divine part of Gilgamesh and allow him to enter the tunnel. After walking for twelve hours in darkness, Gilgamesh comes to a marvelous garden on the other side of the mountains. Some distance away, by the seaside, he meets the nymph Siduri and asks her where he can find Utnapishtim. Siduri tries to make him change his mind: "When the gods made men, they saw death for men; they kept life for themselves. Thou, Gilgamesh, fill thy belly and make merry
45. Except as otherwise indicated, we follow the translation by Contenau, L'epopee de Gilgamesh.



Gilgamesh in quest of immortality 79
by day and night. On each day make a feast, and dance and play, day and night."46 But Gilgamesh holds to his decision, and then Siduri sends him to Urshanabi, Utnapishtim's boatman, who happened to be nearby. They cross the Waters of Death and reach the shore on which Utnapishtim lived. Gilgamesh asks him how he had gained immortality. He thus learns the story of the flood and the gods' decision to make Utnapishtim and his wife their "kin," establishing them "at the mouths of the rivers." "But," Utnapishtim asks Gilgamesh, "as for thee, which of the gods will unite thee to their assembly, that thou mayest obtain the life that thou seekest?" (11. 198). However, what he goes on to say is unexpected: "Up, try not to sleep for six days and seven nights!" (199). What we have here is, undoubtedly, the most difficult of initiatory ordeals: conquering sleep, remaining "awake," is equivalent to a transmutation of the human condition.47 Are we to take it that Utnapishtim, knowing that the gods will not grant Gilgamesh immortality, suggests that he conquer it by means of an initiation? The hero has already successfully gone through several ordeals: the journey through the tunnel, the" temptation" by Siduri, crossing the Waters of Death. These were in some sense ordeals of the heroic type. This time, however, the ordeal is "spiritual," for only an unusual power of concentration can enable a human being to remain awake for six days and seven nights. But Gilgamesh at once falls asleep, and Utnapishtim exclaims sarcastically: "Look at the strong man who desires immortality: sleep has come over him like a violent wind!" (203-4). He sleeps without a break for six days and seven nights; and, when Utnapishtim wakes him, Gilgamesh reproaches him for waking him when he had only just fallen asleep. However, he has to accept the evidence, and he falls to lamenting again: "What shall I do, Utnapishtim, where shall I go? a demon has taken possession of my body; in the room in which I sleep, death lives, and wherever I go, death is there!" (23034). Gilgamesh now makes ready to leave, but at the last moment Utnapishtim, at his wife's suggestion, reveals a "secret of the gods" to him: the place where he can find the plant that brings back youth.

80 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
Gilgamesh goes down to the bottom of the sea, gathers it,48 and starts back rejoicing. After traveling for a few days, he sees a spring of fresh water and hurries to bathe. Attracted by the odor of the plant, a snake comes out of the spring, carries off the plant, and sheds its skin.49 Sobbing, Gilgamesh complains to Urshanabi of his bad fortune. This episode may be read as a failure in another initiatory ordeal: the hero failed to profit from an unexpected gift; in short, he was lacking in wisdom. The text ends abruptly: arrived at Uruk, Gilgamesh invites Urshanabi to go up on the city walls and admire its foundations. 50 The Epic of Gilgamesh has been seen as a dramatized illustration of the human condition, defined by the inevitability of death. Yet this first masterpiece of universal literature can also be understood as illustrating the belief that certain beings are capable, even without help from the gods, of obtaining immortality, on the condition that they successfully pass through a series of initiatory ordeals. Seen from this point of view, the story of Gilgamesh would prove to be the dramatized account of a failed initiation.
24. Destiny and the gods
Unfortunately, we do not know the ritual context of Mesopotamian initiation, always supposing that such a thing existed. The initiatory meaning of the quest for immortality can be deciphered in the particular structure ofthe ordeals undergone by Gilgamesh. The Arthurian romances present a similar situation; they, too, are filled with initiatory symbols and motifs, but it is impossible to decide whether these belong to a ritual scenario, represent recollections of Celtic mythology or Hermetic gnosticism, or are merely products of the imagination. In the case of the Arthurian romances, we at least know the initiatory traditions that preceded their composition, whereas we
48. We may wonder why Gilgamesh did not eat it as soon as he had gathered it, but he was saving it for later; see Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic, p. 62, n.211. 49. This is a well-known folklore theme: by shedding its old skin, the snake renews its life. 50. Tablet XII, composed in Sumerian, was added later; the incidents narrated in it have no direct relation to the narrative we have summarized.



Destiny and the gods 81
know nothing of the protohistory of the initiatory scenario possibly implied in Gilgamesh's adventures. It has been emphasized, and rightly, that Akkadian religious thought puts the accent on man. In the last analysis, the story of Gilgamesh becomes paradigmatic: it proclaims the precariousness of the human condition, the impossibility-even for a hero-of gaining immortality. Man was created mortal, and he was created solely to serve the gods. This pessimistic anthropology was already formulated in the Enuma elish. It is also found in other important religious texts. The "Dialogue between Master and Servant" seems to be the product of nihilism exacerbated by a neurosis: the master does not even know what he wants. He is obsessed by the vanity of all human effort: "Climb the mounds of ancient ruins and walk about: look at these skulls oflate and early men; who among them is an evildoer, who a public benefactor?" 51 Another celebrated text, the "Dialogue about Human Misery," which has been called the "Babylonian Ecclesiastes," is even more despairing. "Does the fierce lion, who eats the best of meat, / Present his dough-and-incense offering to appease his goddess' displeasure? / ... [As for me,] have I withheld the m€(al-oblation? [No], I have prayed to the gods, / I have presented the prescribed sacrifices to the goddess" (lines 50 ff.). From his childhood, this just man has striven to understand the god's thought, he has sought the goddess humbly and piously. Yet "the god brought me scarcity instead of wealth" (lines 71 ff.). On the contrary, it is the scoundrel, the godless, who has acquired wealth (line 236). People" extol the word of a prominent man, expert in murder, / But they abase the humble, who has committed no violence." The evildoer is justified, the righteous man is driven away. It is the bandit who receives gold, while the weak are left to hunger. The wicked man is strengthened, the feeble are cast down (lines 267 ff.).52 This despair arises, not from a meditation on the vanity of human existence, but from the experience of general injustice: the wicked triumph, prayers are not answered; the gods seem indifferent to human affairs. From the second millennium, similar spiritual crises will make themselves felt elsewhere (Egypt, Israel, Iran, India,

82 THE MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGIONS
Greece), with various consequences; for the responses to this type of nihilistic experience were made in accordance with the religious genius characteristic ofeach culture. But in the Mesopotamian wisdom literature the gods do not always prove to be indifferent. One text presents the physical and mental sufferings of an innocent man who has been compared to Job. He is the very pattern of the just man suffering, for no divinity seems to help him. Countless sicknesses have reduced him to being" soaked in his own excrement," and he is already bewailed as dead by his relatives when a series of dreams reveals to him that Marduk will save him. As in an ecstatic trance, he sees the god destroying the demons of sickness and then extracting his pains from his body as one uproots a plant. Finally, his health restored, the just man gives thanks to Marduk by ritually passing through the twelve gates of his temple at Babylon.53 In the last analysis, by putting the accent on man, Akkadian religious thought brings out the limits of human possibilities. The distance between men and the gods proves to be impossible to cross. Yet man is not isolated in his own solitude. First of all, he shares in a spiritual element that can be regarded as divine: it is his" spirit," ilu (literally, "god").54 Secondly, through rites and prayers he hopes to obtain the blessing of the gods. Above all, he knows that he forms part of a universe that is unified by homologies: he lives in a city that constitutes an imago mundi and whose temples and ziggurats represent "centers of the world" and, in consequence, insure communication with heaven and the gods. Babylon was a Bab-il-ani, a "Gate of the Gods," for it is there that the gods came down to earth. A number of cities and sanctuaries were named" Link between Heaven and Earth." 55 In other words, man does not live in a closed world, separated from the gods, completely isolated from the cosmic rhythms. In addition, a complex system of correspondences between heaven and earth made it possible for terrestrial realities to be understood and at the same time to be "influenced" by their respective celestial prototypes. An example: Since each planet had its corresponding metal and color, everything colored was under the

influence of a planet. But each planet belonged to a god, who, by that fact, was represented by the respective metal.56 In consequence, one who ritually manipulated a certain metallic object or a semiprecious stone of a particular color felt that he was under the protection of a god. Finally, numerous techniques of divination, most ofthem developed during the Akkadian period, made it possible to know the future. So it was believed that certain misadventures could be avoided. The variety of techniques and the large number of written documents that have come down to us prove the high esteem in which the mantic art was held on all levels of society. The most elaborate method was extispicy, that is, examining the entrails of a victim; the least costly, lecanomancy, consisted in pouring a little oil on water, or vice versa, and interpreting the signs that could be read in the shapes produced by the two liquids. Astrology, developed later than the other techniques, was principally practiced by the royal entourage. As for the interpretation of dreams, it was complemented, from the beginning of the second millennium, by methods of offsetting unfavorable omens.57 All the techniques of divination pursued the discovery of" signs," whose hidden meanings were interpreted in accordance with certain traditional rules. The world, then, revealed itself to be structured and governed by laws. If the signs were deciphered, the future could be known; in other words, time was" mastered," for events that were to occur only after a certain interval of time were foreseen. The attention paid to signs led to discoveries of genuine scientific value. Some of these discoveries were later taken over and perfected by the Greeks. But Babylonian science remained a "traditional" science, in the sense that scientific knowledge preserved a totalitarian structure, that is, a structure that involved cosmological, ethical, and existential presuppositions.58 Toward 1500 B.C. the creative period of Mesopotamian thought seems definitely to have ended. During the ten following centuries, intellectual activity appears to spend itself in erudition and compilation. But the influence of Mesopotamian culture, documented from

the most ancient times, continues and increases. Ideas, beliefs, and techniques of Mesopotamian origin circulate from the western Mediterranean to the Hindu Kush. It is significant that the Babylonian discoveries that were destined to become popular imply, whether more or less directly, correspondences between heaven and earth, or macrocosm-microcosm.

and Political Crises in Ancient Egypt
25. The unforgettable miracle: The "First Time"
The birth of Egyptian civilization has never failed to inspire wonder and admiration in one historian after another. During the two millennia that preceded the formation of the United Kingdom, the Neolithic cultures continued to develop, but without any profound changes. However, from the fourth millennium, contacts with the civilization of Sumeria bring about nothing short of a mutation. Egypt borrows the cylinder seal, the art of construction in brick, the technique of boat-building, a number of artistic motifs, and, above all, writing, which appears suddenly, with no antecedents, at the beginning of the First Dynasty (ca. 3000 B.C.).! But Egyptian civilization very quickly elaborated a characteristic style, manifest in all its creations. To be sure, the geography of the country itself imposed a development different from that of the Sumero-Akkadian cultures. For, unlike Mesopotamia, vulnerable to invasions from every direction, Egypt-more precisely, the Nile Valley-was not only isolated but also defended by the desert, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean. Until the invasion by the Hyksos (1674 B.C.), Egypt experienced no danger coming from without. On the other hand, the navigability of the Nile enabled the sovereign to govern the country by an increasingly centralized administration. In addition, Egypt had no great cities of the Mesopotamian type. It could be said that the country was constituted by a rural mass ruled by representatives of an incarnate god, the pharaoh. But it is religion, and especially the dogma of the pharaoh's
1. H. Frankfort, The Birth o/Civilization in the Near East, pp. 100--11; E. J.
Baumgartel, The Culture 0/Prehistoric Egypt, pp. 48 fr.



86 ANCIENT EGYPT
divinity, which, from the beginning, contributed to shaping the structure of Egyptian civilization. According to tradition, the unification of the country and the founding of the state were the work of the first sovereign, known by the name of Menes. A native of the South, Menes built the new capital for this united Egypt at Memphis, near the present city of Cairo. It was there that, for the first time, he celebrated the ceremony of coronation. Later, and for more than three thousand years, the pharaohs were crowned at Memphis; in all probability, the culminating ceremony represented the one inaugurated by Menes. It was not a commemoration of Menes' exploits but the renewal o/the creative source present in the original event.2
The founding of the united state was the equivalent of a cosmogony. The pharaoh, incarnate god, established a new world, a civilization infinitely more complex, and far higher, than that of the Neolithic villages. It was supremely important to insure the permanence of this work, accomplished in accordance with a divine model-in other words, to avoid crises that could shake the foundations of the new world. The divinity of the pharaoh constituted the most potent guarantee. Since he was immortal, his death meant no more than his translation to heaven. The continuity from one incarnate god to another incarnate god, and hence the continuity of the cosmic order, was insured. It is remarkable that the most important sociopolitical and cultural creations took place during the earliest dynasties. It is these creations that established the models for the following fifteen centuries. After the Fifth Dynasty (2500-2300 B.C.) almost nothing of importance was added to the cultural patrimony. This "immobilism," which is characteristic of Egyptian civilization but which is also found in the myths and nostalgias of other traditional societies, is religious in origin. The stability of hieratic forms, the repetition of gestures and exploits performed at the dawn of time, are the logical consequence of a theology that considered the cosmic order to be supremely the divine work and saw in all change the danger of a regression to chaos and hence the triumph of demonic forces. The tendency that European scholars have termed "immobilism" made the utmost effort to maintain the original creation intact, for it was perfect from every point of view-cosmological, religious, social, ethical. The successive phases of the cosmogony are vividly

Theogonies and cosmogonies 87
recalled in the various mythological traditions. Indeed, the myths refer exclusively to the events that took place in the fabled time of the beginnings. This period, called Tep zepi, the "First Time," lasted from the appearance of the creating god above the primordial waters down to the enthronement of Horus. All existing things, from natural phenomena to religious and cultural realities (plans of temples, the calendar, writing, rituals, royal emblems, etc.), owe their validity and their justification to the fact that they were created during the initial period. Clearly, the First Time constitutes the Golden Age of absolute perfection, "before anger, or noise, or conflict, or disorder made their appearance." Neither death nor disease were known during this marvelous period, called "the time ofRe" (or Osiris or Horus}.3 At a certain moment, as a result of the intrusion of evil, disorder appeared, putting an end to the Golden Age. But the fabled period of the First Time was not relegated to the relics of a past that had finitely run its course. Since it constitutes the sum of the models that are to be imitated, this period is continually reactualized. In short, it could be said that the rites, pursuing the defeat of the demonic forces, have as their purpose restoring the initial perfection.
26. Tbeogonies and cosmogonies
As in all the traditional religions, the cosmogony and the ongm myths (origin of man, of royalty, of social institutions, of rituals, etc.) constituted the essence of the science of sacred things. Naturally, there were several cosmogonic myths, featuring different gods and localizing the beginning of Creation in a multitude of religious centers. Their themes belong among the most archaic: the emergence of a mound, a lotus, or an egg above the primordial waters. As for the creator-gods, each important city gave the leading role to its own. Dynastic changes were often followed by a change of capital. Such events obliged the theologians of the new capital to combine several cosmogonic traditions, identifying their chief local god with the demiurge. When creator-gods were involved, assimilation was made easy by their structural similarity. But the theologians also elaborated
3. See Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, pp. 263-64. "The perfection of the beginnings" is a widespread mythical motif.



88 ANCIENT EGYPT
daring syntheses by assimilating heterogeneous religious systems and associating definitely antagonistic divine figures. 4 Like so many other traditions, the Egyptian cosmogony begins with the emergence of a mound in the primordial waters. The appearance of this "First Place" above the aquatic immensity signifies the emergence of the earth, but also the beginning of light, life, and consciousness.5 At Heliopolis, the place named the "Hill of Sand," which formed part of the temple of the sun, was identified with the primordial hill. Hermopolis was famous for its lake, from which the cosmogonic lotus emerged. But other localities took advantage of the same privilege.6 Indeed, each city, each sanctuary, was considered to be a "center of the world," the place where the Creation had begun. The initial mound sometimes became the cosmic mountain up which the pharaoh climbed to meet the sun god. Other versions tell of the primordial egg, which contained the "Bird of Light" (Coffin Texts, vol. 4, 181e fr.), or of the original lotus that bore the Child Sun,7 or, finally, of the primitive serpent, first and last image of the god Atum. (And in fact chapter 175 of the Book of the Dead prophesies that when the world returns to the state of chaos, Atum will become the new serpent. In Atum we may recognize the supreme and hidden God, whereas Re, the Sun, is above all the manifest God; see § 32.) The stages of creationcosmogony, theogony, creation of living beings, etc.-are variously presented. According to the solar theology of Heliopolis, a city situated at the apex of the Delta, the god Re-Atum-Khepri 8 created a first divine couple, Shu (the Atmosphere) and Tefnut, who became parents of the god Geb (the Earth) and of the goddess Nut (the Sky). The demiurge performed the act of creation by masturbating himself or by spitting. The expressions are naively coarse, but their meaning
4. The myths were not related in a continuous and consistent way in order to constitute, as it were, "canonical versions." Consequently we have to reconstruct them from episodes and allusions found in the earliest collections, especially in the Pyramid Texts (ca. 2500-2300 B.C.), the Coffin Texts (ca. 2300-2000 B.C.), and the Book of the Dead (after 1500 B.C.).

Theogonies and cosmogonies 89
is clear: the divinities are born from the very substance ofthe supreme god. Just as in the Sumerian tradition (§ 16), Sky and Earth were united in an uninterrupted hieros gamos until the moment when they were separated by Shu, the god of the atmosphere.9 From their union were born Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys, protagonists of a touching drama that will engage our attention further on. At Hermopolis, in Middle Egypt, the theologians elaborated a complex doctrine around the Ogdoad, the group of eight gods, later joined by Ptah. In the primordial lake of Hermopolis there emerged a lotus, from which came the "sa~rosanct child, the perfect heir engendered by the Ogdoad, divine seed of the very first Anterior Gods," "he who knotted the seeds of gods and men."lO But it is in Memphis, capital of the pharaohs of the First Dynasty, that the most systematic theology was articulated, around the god Ptah. The principal text of what has been called the "Memphite theology" was engraved on stone in the time of the Pharaoh Shakaba (ca. 700 B.C.), but the original was composed some two thousand years earlier. It is surprising that the earliest Egyptian cosmogony yet known is also the most philosophical. For Ptah creates by his mind (his "heart") and his word (his "tongue"). "He who manifested himself as the heart (= mind), he who manifested himself as the tongue (= word), under the appearance of Atum, he is Ptah the most ancient." Ptah is proclaimed the greatest god, Atum

being considered only the author of the first divine couple. It is Ptah "who made the gods exist." Afterward, the gods assumed theit: visible bodies, entering into" every kind of plant, every kind of stone, every kind of clay, into everything that sprouts on its surface (i.e., of the earth) and by which they can manifest themselves."ll In short, the theogony and the cosmogony are effected by the

creative power of the thought and word of a single god. We here certainly have the highest expression of Egyptian metaphysical speculation. As John Wilson observes (ANET, p. 4), it is at the beginning of Egyptian history that we find a doctrine that can be compared with the Christian theology of the Logos. In comparison with the theogony and the cosmogony, the myths concerning the origin of man prove to be rather summary. Men (erme) are born from the tears (erme) of the solar god, Re. In a text composed later (ca. 2000 B.C.), during a period of crisis, it is written: "Men, the cattle of God, have been well provided for. He (i.e., the sun god) made the sky and the earth for their benefit.... He made the air to vivify their nostrils, for they are his images, issued from his flesh. He shines in the sky, he makes plants and animals for them, birds and fish to feed them."12 However, when Re discovers that men have plotted against him, he decides to destroy them. It is Hathor who undertakes to carry out the slaughter. But when she threatens to destroy the human race completely, Re has recourse to a subterfuge and manages to get her drunk.13 The revolt of men and its consequences took place during
the mythical ag~. Obviously, "men" were the earliest inhabitants of Egypt, since Egypt was the first country formed, hence the center of the world.14 The Egyptians were its only rightful inhabitants; this explains the prohibition against foreigners entering sanctuaries, which were microcosmic images of the country.15 Certain late texts reflect the tendency toward universalism. The gods (Horus, Sekhmet) protect not only the Egyptians but also the Palestinians, the Nubians, and the Libyans.16 However, the mythical history of the first men does not play an important role. During the prodigious period of the First Time, the two decisive moments were the cosmogony and the advent ofthe pharaoh.

The responsibilities of an incarnate god 91
27. The responsibilities of an incarnate god
As Henri Frankfort observes,17 the cosmogony is the most important of events because it represents the only real change: the emergence of the world. Thenceforth only the changes involved in the rhythms of cosmic life have any meaning. But, in this case, we are dealing with successive moments expressed in different cycles and insuring their periodicity: the motions of the heavenly bodies, the circle of the seasons, the phases of the moon, the rhythm of vegetation, the flux and reflux of the Nile, etc. Now it is precisely this periodicity of the cosmic rhythms that constitytes the perfection established in the age of the" First Time." Disorder implies a useless, and therefore harmful, change in the paradigmatic cycle of perfectly ordered changes. Since the social order represents an aspect of the cosmic order, royalty is held to have existed from the beginning of the world. The Creator was the first king;18 he transmits this function to his son and successor, the first pharaoh. This delegation consecrated royalty as a divine institution. And indeed the pharaoh's gestures and deeds are described in the same terms as those used to describe the acts of the god Re or of the solar epiphanies. To give only two examples: Re's creation is sometimes summarized in a precise formula: "He put order (macat) in the place of Chaos." And it is these same terms that are used of Tut-ankh-Amon when he restored order after the "heresy" of Akh-en-Aton (cf. § 32), or of Pepi II: "He put maCat in the place of falsehood (of disorder)." Similarly, the verb khay, "to shine," is used indifferently to depict the emergence of the sun at the moment of creation or at each dawn and the appearance of the pharaoh at the coronation ceremony, at festivals, or at the privy councip9 The pharaoh is the incarnation of maCat, a term translated by "truth" but whose general meaning is "good order" and hence "right," "justice." MaCat belongs to the original creation; hence it reflects the perfection of the Golden Age. Since it constitutes the

18. In the Book of the Dead (chap. 17) the God proclaims: "I am Atum, when I was alone in Num (the primeval ocean). I am Re in his first appearance, when he began to rule that which he had made." A gloss adds the following explanation: "This means that Re began to appear as a king, as one who existed before Shu had even lifted heaven from earth" (Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion, pp. 54-55).

92 ANCIENT EGYPT
very foundation of the cosmos and life, maCat can be known by each individual separately. In texts of different origins and periods, there are such declarations as these: "Incite your heart to know maCat"; "I make thee to know the thing of maCat in thy heart; mayest thou do what is right for thee!" Or: "I was a man who loved maCat and hated sin. For I knew that (sin) is an abomination to God." And in fact it is God who bestows the necessary knowledge. A prince is defined as "one who knows truth (maCat) and whom God teaches." The author of a prayer to Re cries: "Mayest Thou give me maCat in my heart!" 20 As incarnating maCat, the pharaoh constitutes the paradigmatic example for all his subjects. As the vizier Rekh-mi-Re expresses it: "He is a god who makes us live by his acts."21 The work of the pharaoh insures the stability of the cosmos and the state and hence the continuity of life. And indeed the cosmogony is repeated every morning, when the solar god" repels" the serpent Apophis, though without being able to destroy him; for chaos (= the original darkness) represents virtuality; hence it is indestructible. The pharaoh's political activity repeats Re's exploit: he" too "repels" Apophis, in other words he sees to it that the world does not return to chaos. When enemies appear at the frontiers, they will be assimilated to Apophis, and the pharaoh's victory will reproduce Re's triumph. (This tendency to interpret life and history in terms of categories and paradigmatic models is characteristic of the traditional cultures.)22 Certainly, the pharaoh was the only protagonist of particular, nonrepeatable historical events: military campaigns in various countries, victories over various peoples, etc. Yet when Ramses III builds his tomb, he repeats the names of the conquered cities inscribed on the funerary temple of Ramses II. Even in the period ofthe Old Kingdom, the Libyans who" appear as the victims of Pepi II's conquests bear the same personal names as those who appear in the temple reliefs of Sahure, two centuries earlier." 23

The responsibilities of an incarnate god 93
It is impossible to recognize the individual features of the pharaohs as they are depicted on the monuments and in the texts. In many characteristic details-for example, the initiative and courage of Thut-mose III during the battle of Megiddo-A. de Buck has recognized the conventional elements of the portrait of an ideal sovereign. The same tendency toward impersonality is observable in the representation of the gods. Except for Osiris and Isis, all the gods, despite their distinct forms and functions, are evoked in the hymns and prayers in almost the same terms.24 In principle, the cult was to be celebrated by the pharaoh, but he delegated his functions to the priests of the different temples. Directly or indirectly, the purpose of the rituals was the defense, hence the stability, of the "original creation." At each New Year the cosmogony was reiterated,25 and even more paradigmatically than Re's daily victory, for a vaster temporal cycle was involved. The enthronement of the pharaoh reproduced the episodes of the gesta of Menes: the unification of the two lands. In short, the founding of the state was ritually repeated (cf. § 25). The coronation ceremony was reenacted on the occasion of the sed festival, performed thirty years after the enthronement and intended to renew the sovereign's divine energy.26 As for the periodical festivals of certain gods (Horus, Min, Anubis, etc.), we have only scanty information. The priests, walking in procession, carried on their shoulders the statue of the god or the sacred boat; the procession included songs, music, and dances and took place amid the plaudits of the worshiping crowd. The great festival of Min, one of the most popular in all Egypt, is better known to us by virtue of the fact that it was later associated with the royal cult. Originally it was the harvest festival; the king, the queen, and a white bull took part in the procession. The king cut
24. See the comparison between Min and Sobek in Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion, pp. 25-26. Recognizing the importance of the static vision of the universe, interpreted as a rhythmical movement within an immutable totality, Frankfort has proposed an ingenious explanation for the manifestations of the gods in animal forms: whereas among human beings individual characteristics outbalance morphological structure, animals are unchanging; they always reproduce their species. Thus, in the eyes of the Egyptians, animal life appeared superhuman, since it shared in the static life of the universe (ibid., pp. 13-14).

a sheaf of grain and offered it to the bull; the remainder of the rites is obscure.27 The ceremonies of the foundation and inauguration of temples were presided over by the pharaoh. Unfortunately, we know only certain symbolic gestures: in the trench opened on the site of a future temple the king placed the "foundation deposits" (a brick molded by the sovereign, gold ingots, etc.); at the inauguration, he consecrated the building by raising his right arm, etc. The daily divine cult was addressed to the statue of the god kept in the naos. Once the ritual purification was accomplished, the officiant approached the naos, broke the clay seal, and opened the door. He prostrated himself before the statue, declaring that he had entered heaven (the naos) to contemplate the god. The statue was then purified with natron to "open the mouth" of the god. Finally, the officiant shut the door again, sealed the bolt, and withdrew, walking backward.28 Our information concerning the funerary cult is very much fuller. Death and the beyond preoccupied the Egyptians more than they did the other Near Eastern peoples. For the pharaoh, death constituted the point of departure for his celestial journey and his" immortalization." In addition, death directly involved one of the most popular Egyptian gods: Osiris.
28. The pharaoh's ascent to heaven
So far as they can be reconstructed, the earliest Egyptian beliefs concerning existence after death resembled the two traditions that are amply documented throughout the world: the dwelling place of the dead was either underground or else in the sky-more precisely, among the stars. After death, souls made their way to the stars and shared in their eternity. The sky was imagined as a Mother Goddess, and death was equivalent to a new birth, in other words to a rebirth in the sidereal world. The maternity of the sky implied the idea that the dead person had to be engendered a second time; after his

celestial rebirth he was fed on the milk of the Mother Goddess (represented in the form of a COW).29 The subterranean localization ofthe otherworld was a predominant belief in the Neolithic cultures. Already as early as the predynastic period (i.e., at the beginning of the fourth millennium), certain religious traditions bound up with agriculture found expression in the mythico-ritual Osirian complex. Now, Osiris, the only Egyptian god who suffered a violent death, also figured in the royal cult. We shall later examine the consequences of this encounter between a god who dies and the solar theology that defined and validated the immortalization ofthe pharaoh. The Pyramid Texts express almost exclusively conceptions concerning the postmortem destiny of the king. Despite the efforts of the theologians, the doctrine was not perfectly systematized. We find a certain opposition between parallel and sometimes antagonistic conceptions. The majority of the formulas forcefully repeat that the pharaoh, son of Atum (= Re), engendered by the Great God before the creation of the world, cannot die; but other texts assure the king that his body will not suffer decomposition. Here, certainly, there are two different religious ideologies that are not yet adequately integrated.30 However, the majority of the formulas refer to the pharaoh's celestial journey. He flies away in the form of a bird-a falcon, heron, wild goose (Pyr. 461-63, 890-91, 913, 1048), a scarabaeus (366), or a grasshopper (890-91), etc. The winds, the clouds, the gods are bound to help him. Sometimes the king ascends to the sky by a ladder (365, 390, 971 ff., 2083). During his ascent the king is already a god, totally different in essence from the race of human beings (650, 809).31 Nevertheless, before arriving at the celestial abode in the East, named the Field of Offerings, the pharaoh had to undergo certain ordeals. The entrance was defended by a lake" with winding shores"
29. This idea justifies the incestuous union of the dead pharaoh, called the
"Bull Who Makes His Mother Fertile." See Frankfort, Kingship, pp. 177 if. 30. Certain texts (Pyr. 2007-9) give instructions that the king's bones shall be reassembled and his limbs freed from their wrappings to insure his ascension; Vandier has shown that this belongs to an Osirian mythico-ritual complex (Relig. egyptienne, p. 81).

(Pyr. 2061), and the ferryman had the power of a judge. To be admitted into the boat, the pharaoh must have accomplished all the ritual purifications (Pyr. "519, 1116) and, above all, must answer an interrogation of the initiatory type, that is to say, must answer by stereotyped formulas that served as passwords. Sometimes the king has recourse to pleading (1188-89), or to magic (492 ff.), or even to threats. He implores the gods (especially Re, Thoth, and Horus), or begs the two sycamore trees between which the sun rises every day, to let him pass on into the" Field of Reeds." 32 Arrived in heaven, the pharaoh is received in triumph by the Sun God, and messengers are sent to the four quarters of the world to announce his victory over death. In heaven, the king continues his earthly existence: seated on the throne, he receives the homage of his subjects and still judges and gives orders.33 For though he alone enjoys solar immortality, the pharaoh is surrounded by a number of his subjects, principally the members of his family and high officials.34 These are identified with the stars and are called "the glorified." According to Vandier (Religion egyptienne, p. 80): "The stellar passages of the Pyramid Texts are suffused with a poetry of exceptional quality: in them we find the simple and spontaneous imagination of a primitive people that moves easily in the realm of mystery." As we observed, the soteriological doctrine of the Pyramid Texts is not always consistent. By identifying him with Re, the solar theology stressed the privileged role of the pharaoh: he did not fall under the jurisdiction of Osiris, the ruler of the dead. "Thou openest thy place in Heaven among the stars of Heaven, for thou art a star.... Thou

found in Breasted, Development, pp. 103 ff., and in R. Weill, Le champ des
roseaux et Ie champ des offrandes, pp. 16 ff. Such ordeals are known in many archaic traditions. They presuppose a preparatory initiation, including certain rituals and teachings (funerary mythology and geography, secret formulas, etc.). The few allusions found in the Pyramid Texts constitute the earliest written documents having to do with obtaining a privileged destiny by virtue of certain secret kinds of knowledge. We here undoubtedly have an immemorial heritage, also shared by the predynastic Neolithic cultures. In the royal Egyptian ideology, these initiatory allusions more nearly represent a useless relic; as son of god and god incarnate, the pharaoh did not need initiatory ordeals in order to gain the right to enter the celestial paradise. 33. pyr. 1301, 1721; 134-35, 712-13, 1774-76, cited by Vandier, Relig. egyptienne, p. 79.

lookest over Osiris, thou commandest the dead, thou keepest thyself apart from them, thou art not of them" (Pyr. 251). "Re-Atum does not deliver thee to Osiris, who judges not thy heart and has not power over thy heart.... Osiris, thou shalt not lay hold on him, thy son (Horus) shall not lay hold on him" (Pyr. 145-46; after the translation by R. Weill, p. 116). Other texts are even aggressive; they affirm that Osiris is a dead god, for he was murdered and thrown into the water. Certain passages, however, allude to the pharaoh's identification with Osiris. We find such formulas as this: "Even as Osiris lives, this king Unis lives; even as Osiris does not die, so this king Unis does not die" (Pyr. 167 f.).
29. Osiris, the murdered god
To grasp the meaning of such formulas, we must briefly present the myths and the religious function of Osiris. To begin, we mention that the most complete version of the Osiris myth is the one transmitted by Plutarch (second century A.D.) in his treatise De [side et Osiride. For as we observed in regard to the cosmogony (§ 26), the Egyptian texts refer only to isolated episodes. Despite certain inconsistencies and contradictions, which can be explained by the tensions and syncretisms that preceded the final victory of Osiris, his central myth can easily be reconstructed. According to all the traditions, he was a legendary king, famous for the energy and justice with which he governed Egypt. Seth, his brother, set a snare for him and succeeded in murdering him. His wife, Isis, a "great magician," manages to become pregnant by the dead Osiris. After burying his body, she takes refuge in the Delta; there, hidden in the papyrus thickets, she gives birth to a son, Horus. Grown up, Horus first makes the gods of the Ennead recognize his rights, then he attacks his uncle. At first, Seth is able to tear out one of his eyes (Pyr. 1463), but the combat continues, and Horus finally triumphs. He recovers his eye and offers it to Osiris. (It was thus that Osiris returned to life; see Pyr. 609 ff., etc.) The gods condemn Seth to carry his victim (for example, Seth is transformed into the boat that carries Osiris on the Nile).35 But, like Apophis, Seth cannot be finally destroyed, for he

too incarnates an irreducible force. After his victory, Horus goes down to the land of the dead and announces the good news: recognized as his father's legitimate successor, he is crowned king. It is thus that he "awakens" Osiris; according to the texts, "he sets his soul in motion." It is especially this last act of the drama that throws light on the mode of being characteristic of Osiris. Horus finds him in a state of unconscious torpor and is able to reanimate him. "Osiris! look! Osiris! listen! Arise! Live again!" (Pyr. 258 if.). Osiris is never represented as in motion; he is always shown as powerless and passive.36 After his coronation-that is, after he has put an end to the period of crisis (" chaos ")-Horus reanimates him: "Osiris! thou wert gone, but thou hast returned; thou didst sleep, but thou hast been awakened; thou didst die, but thou livest again!" (Pyr. 1004 if.). However, Osiris is resuscitated as "spiritual person" (= soul) and vital energy. It is he who will henceforth insure vegetable fertility and all the powers of reproduction. He is described as being the entire Earth or is compared to the Ocean that encircles the world. Already by about 2750 Osiris symbolizes the sources of fecundity and growth.37 In other words, Osiris, the murdered king (= the deceased pharaoh), insures the prosperity of the kingdom ruled by his son, Horus (represented by the newly installed pharaoh). We can perceive the general outline of the relations among Re, the pharaoh, and the pair Osiris-Horus. The sun and the royal tombs constituted the two principal sources of sacrality. According to the solar theology, the pharaoh was the son ofRe; but since he succeeded to the deceased sovereign (= Osiris), the reigning pharaoh was also Horus. The tension between these two orientations of the Egyptian religious spirit, "solarization" and "Osirianization," 38 appears in
scattered them. But Isis found them all (except the sexual organ, which had been swallowed by a fish) and buried them where they had been scattered; this explains the fact that numerous sanctuaries were supposed to possess a tomb of Osiris. See A. Brunner, "Zum Raumbegriff der Aegypter," p. 615.

the function of royalty. As we have seen, Egyptian civilization is the result of the union of Upper and Lower Egypt in a single kingdom. In the beginning Re was regarded as sovereign of the Golden Age; but from the time of the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2040-1730 B.C.), this role was transferred to Osiris. In the royal ideology, the Osirian formula ended by imposing itself, for the filiation Osiris-Horus guaranteed the continuity of the dynasty and, in addition, insured the prosperity of the country. As source of universal fertility, Osiris made the reign of his son and successor flourish. A text from the Middle Kingdom admirably expresses the exaltation of Osiris as source and foundation of all creation: "Whether I live or die, I am Osiris; I enter in and reappear through you, I decay in you, I grow in you.... The gods are living in me, for I live and grow in the corn that sustains the Honoured Ones. I cover the earth; whether I live or die I am Barley. I am not destroyed. I have entered the Order.... I become Master of Order, I emerge in the Order."39 We here have a daring valorization of death, henceforth accepted as a sort of exalting transmutation of incarnate existence. Death accomplishes passage from the sphere of the meaningless to the sphere of the meaningful. The tomb is the place where man's transfiguration (sakh) is accomplished, for the dead person becomes an Akh, a "transfigured spirit." 40 What is important for our purpose is the fact that Osiris increasingly becomes the paradigmatic model, not only for the sovereigns but for every individual. To be sure, his cult was already popular under the Old Kingdom; this explains his presence in the Pyramid Texts despite the resistance of the Heliopolitan theologians. But a first serious crisis, which we shall soon recount, had suddenly put an end to the classic period of Egyptian civilization. Once order was reestablished, Osiris is found to be at the center of ethical preoccupations and religious hopes. It is the begin

It should be borne in mind that laying the deceased in his coffin meant placing him in the arms of his mother, the sky goddess Nut: "Thou art given to thy mother Nut under her name of Coffin" (PJ!.r. 616). Another text compares Nut to a bed in which the deceased sleeps, waiting to wake to a new life (pyr. 741). The four sides of the coffin are personified as Isis, Nephthys, Horus, and Thoth; its floor is identified with Geb, the earth god, and its cover with the sky goddess. Thus the deceased in his coffin was surrounded by personifications of the entire cosmos; cf. A. Piankoff, The Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amon, pp. 21-22.



100 ANCIENT EGYPT
ning of a process that has been described as the "democratization" of Osiris. And indeed, besides the pharaohs, many others profess their ritual participation in the drama and apotheosis of Osiris. The texts formerly inscribed on the walls of the hidden chambers in the pyramids erected for the pharaohs are now reproduced inside the coffins ofthe nobility and even oftotally unprivileged people. Osiris becomes the model for all those who hope to conquer death. A Coffin Text (4.276 ff.) proclaims: "Thou art now the son of a king, a prince, as long as thy heart (i.e., spirit) shall be with thee." Following Osiris' example, and with his help, the dead are able to transform themselves into "souls," that is, into perfectly integrated and hence indestructible spiritual beings. Murdered and dismembered, Osiris was" reconstituted" by Isis and reanimated by Horus. In this way he inaugurated a new mode of existence: from a powerless shade, he became a "person" who "knows," a duly initiated spiritual being. 41 It is probable that the Hellenistic mysteries ofIsis and Osiris developed similar ideas. Osiris takes over from Re the function of judge of the dead; he becomes the Master of Justice, installed in a palace or on the Primordial Mound, that is, at the" center of the world." Meanwhile, as we shall see (§ 33), the tension Re-Osiris will find a solution during the Middle Kingdom and the Empire.
30. Syncope: Anarchy, despair, and "democratization" of the afterlife
Pepi II was the last pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty. Soon after his death, about 2200 B.C., Egypt was seriously shaken by civil war, and the state collapsed. The weakness ofthe central power had encouraged the ambition of dynasts. For some time, anarchy ravaged the country. At a certain moment Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, that of the North, with its capital at Heracleopolis, and that of the South, whose capital was Thebes. The civil war ended with the victory of the Thebans, and the last kings of the Eleventh Dynasty were able to reunite the country. The period of anarchy, known to historians as

Anarchy, despair, .. democratization" of the afterlife 101
the First Intermediate Period (or First Interregnum), ended in 2050 B.C. with the accession ofthe Twelfth Dynasty. The restoration of the central power marked the beginning of a veritable renaissance. It was during the Intermediate Period that the "democratization" of life after death took place: the nobles copied on their coffins the Pyramid Texts that had been composed exclusively for the pharaohs. This is also the only period in Egyptian history when the pharaoh was accused of weakness and even of immorality. By the aid of several extremely interesting literary compositions we can follow the profound transformations that took place during the crisis. The most important texts are known by the titles The Instruction for King Meri-ka-Re; The Admonitions ofIpu-wer; A Song of the Harper; and The Dispute of a Man Weary of Life with His Soul. Their authors describe the disasters brought on by the collapse of traditional authority, and especially the injustices and crimes that encourage skepticism and despair, even suicide. But these documents at the same time indicate a change of an inward kind. At least certain dignitaries question themselves as to their responsibility in the catastrophe and do not hesitate to pronounce themselves guilty. A certain Ipu-wer comes before the pharaoh to report the extent of the disaster to him. "Behold now, it has come to a point where the land is despoiled of the kingship by a few irresponsible men! ... Behold now, it has come to a point where men rebel against the royal uraeus, ... which makes the Two Lands peacefuL ... The royal residence may be razed within an hour!" Provinces and temples no longer pay taxes because of the civil war. The tombs of the pyramids have been savagely pillaged. "The king has been taken away by poor men. Behold, he who was buried as a (divine) falcon (now lies) on a (mere) bier; what the pyramid hid has become empty." Yet, as he went on speaking, the "prophet" Ipu-wer became bolder and ended by blaming the pharaoh for the general anarchy. For the king should be the shepherd of his people, yet his reign enthroned death. " Authority and justice are with thee, (but) it is confusion which thou wouldst set throughout the land, together with the voice of contention. Behold, one thrusts against another. Men conform to that which thou hast commanded. This really means that thou hast acted to bring such (a situation) into being, and thou hast spoken lies." 42

102 ANCIENT EGYPT
One of the kings of the same period composed a treatise for his son Meri-ka-Re. He humbly admits his sins: "Egypt fights even in the necropolis ... I did the same!" The misfortunes of the country "happened through what I had done, and I knew of it only after I had done it! " He recommends to his son" to do justice (macat) whilst thou endurest upon earth." "Do not trust in length of years, for the judges (who will judge thee after death) regard a lifetime as (but) an hour." Only a man's acts remain with him. Hence, "do not evil." Instead of erecting a monument of stone, "make thy memorial to last through the love ofthee." "Love all men!" For the gods esteem justice more than offerings. "Quiet the weeper; do not oppress the widow; supplant no man in the property of his father.... Be on thy guard against punishing unjustly. Do not slaughter!"43 One kind of vandalism had particularly horrified the Egyptians: men destroyed the ancestral tombs, threw out the bodies, and carried off the stones for their own tombs. As Ipu-wer said: "Many dead are buried in the river. The stream is a tomb." And the king advised his son Meri-ka-Re: "Harm not the tomb of another.... Build not thy tomb from ruins!" The Song of the Harper describes the pillage and destruction of tombs, but for entirely different reasons. "The gods who lived formerly (i.e., the kings) rest in their pyramids, the beatified dead (i.e., the nobles) also, buried in their pyramids-their places are not. See what has been made of them! ... Their walls are broken apart, and their places are not-as though they had never been!" For the author of the poem, however, these iniquities only confirm once more the impenetrable mystery of death. "There is none who comes back from (over) there, that he may tell their state, that he may tell their needs, that he may still our hearts until we too (may) travel to the place where they have gone." And so the Harper concludes: "Make holiday, and weary not therein!" 44 The downfall of all the traditional institutions finds expression at once in agnosticism and pessimism and in an exaltation of joy that cannot hide a profound despair. The syncope of the divine royalty inevitably brings on the religious devalorization of death. If the pharaoh no longer behaves like an incarnate god, everything becomes doubtful again, first of all the meaning of life and hence the reality

of a postexistence beyond the grave. The Song of the Harper is reminiscent of other crises of despair-in Israel, in Greece, in ancient India-crises brought on by the collapse of traditional values. The most moving text is certainly the Dispute of a Man Weary of Life. It is a dialogue between a man overwhelmed by despair and his soul (ba). The man tries to convince his soul of the expedience of suicide. "To whom can I speak today? One's fellows are evil; the friends of today do not love.... Hearts are rapacious: every man seizes his fellow's goods.... There are no righteous; the land is left to those who do wrong.... The sin which treads the earth, it has no end." Called to mind amid these evils, death seems to him more than desirable: it fills him with forgotten or seldom-known blessings. "Death is in my sight today (like) the recovery of a sick man ... like the odor of myrrh ... like the odor of lotus blossoms ... like the scent (of fields) after rain ... like the longing of a man to see his house again after he has spent many years held in captivity." His soul (ba) reminds him that suicide will forbid him burial and funeral services; it then tries to persuade him to forget his troubles by seeking for sensual pleasures. Finally the soul assures him that it will remain with him even if he decides to kill himself.45 The literary compositions of the Intermediate Period continued to be read and copied long after the restoration of political unity under the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom (2040--1730 B.C.). These texts represented not only incomparable testimonies to the great crisis; they also illustrated a tendency of the Egyptian religious spirit that did not cease to increase from that time on. It is a current of thought that it is difficult to describe briefly, but whose chief characteristic is the importance accorded to the human person as a virtual replica of the paradigmatic model, the person of the pharaoh.
31. Theology and politics of "solarization"
The Middle Kingdom was ruled by a series of excellent sovereigns, almost all of them belonging to the Twelfth Dynasty. Under their reign Egypt experienced a period of economic expansion and great

international prestige.46 The names chosen by the pharaohs at their coronation express their will to conduct themselves justly (maCat) toward men and gods.47 It is during the Twelfth Dynasty that Amon, one of the eight gods worshiped at Hermopolis, rose to the supreme rank under the title Amon-Re. (The founder of the dynasty was named Amen-em-het, "Amon is at the head.") The "hidden" god (cf. § 26) was identified with the sun, the supremely "manifested" god. It was due to "solarization" that Amon became the universal god of the Empire, which succeeded to the defunct Old and Middle kingdoms. Paradoxically, this empire was the consequence, delayed but inevitable, of a second crisis that arose after the extinction of the Twelfth Dynasty. A large number of sovereigns followed one another in rapid succession until the invasion by the Hyksos in 1674 B.C. The causes of the disintegration of the state, which began as early as two generations before the Hyksos attacked, are not known, but in any case the Egyptians could not long have resisted the assault of these redoubtable warriors, who used the horse, the chariot, armor, and the composite bow. The history of the Hyksos is inadequately known; 48 however, their thrust toward Egypt was certainly the result of the migrations that had shaken the Near East during the seventeenth century. After their victory, the conquerors settled in the Delta. From their capital, Avaris, and through the agency of vassals, they governed the greater part of Lower Egypt; but they made the mistake of tolerating, in exchange for a tribute, the succession of the pharaohs in Upper Egypt. The Hyksos imported certain Syrian gods, most importantly

It is true that the Egyptians still regarded themselves as the only really human beings; foreigners were assimilated to animals, and in certain cases they could be sacrificed (see Wilson, ibid., p. 140). 48. The etymological source of the term Hyksos is Egyptian: hikau khasut, "governor of foreign lands." The majority of the known names are of Semitic origin, but Hurrian words have also been identified. The Hyksos are not mentioned in any contemporary Egyptian document. A reference to their fortified town, Tanis, occurs in a text of the Nineteenth Dynasty and in a popular tale composed at about the same period. As was to be expected, the conquerors ("barbarians" in Egyptian eyes) were assimilated to the serpent Apophis, symbol of primordial chaos.

Baal and Teshub, whom they identified with Seth. The advancement of the murderer of Osiris to the supreme rank certainly constituted a cruel humiliation. It must, however, be borne in mind that the cult of Seth was already practiced in the Delta in the days of the Fourth Dynasty. For the Egyptians, the Hyksos invasion represented a catastrophe difficult to comprehend. Confidence in their privileged position, predetermined by the gods, was severely shaken. In addition, while the Delta was colonized by Asiatics, the conquerors, withdrawn into their fortified fields, scornfully ignored Egyptian civilization. But the Egyptians understood the lesson. They learned more and more to handle the arms of their conquerors. A century after the collapse (i.e., ca. 1600 B.C.), Thebes, where a pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty was ruling, began the war of liberation. The final victory coincides with the accession of the Eighteenth Dynasty (1562-1308 B.C.) and the founding of the Empire.49 The liberation found expression in the rise of nationalism and xenophobia. It took at least a century to quench the thirst for revenge against the Hyksos. At first the sovereigns launched punitive raids. But in 1470 B.C. Thut-mose III opened the series of military campaigns in Asia by an expedition against the former fortified places of the Hyksos. The feeling of insecurity produced by the foreign occupation was long in disappearing. It was in order to make Egypt invulnerable to external aggression that Thut-mose III proceeded to a series of conquests that ended in the Empire. Very probably, the frustrations undergone during the first twenty-two years of his reign increased his military ambitions. For during all that time the actual sovereign was his aunt and mother-in-law, Hatshepsut. This singularly gifted queen preferred cultural and commercial expansion to wars of conquest. But two weeks after her fall from power, Thut-mose was on his way to Palestine and Syria-to reduce the "rebels." Not long afterward he triumphed at Megiddo. Fortunately for the future of the Empire, Thut-mose proved to be generous to the vanquished. It was the end of Egyptian isolationism, but it also marked the

decline of the traditional Egyptian culture. Despite the comparatively short life of the Empire, its repercussions were irreversible. As the result of its international policy, Egypt increasingly opened itself to a cosmopolitan culture. A century after the victory at Megiddo the massive presence of "Asiatics" is documented everywhere, even in the administration and the royal residences.50 A number of foreign divinities were not only tolerated but were assimilated to national divinities. What is more, the Egyptian gods began to be worshiped in foreign lands, and Amon-Re became a universal god. The solarization of Amon had facilitated both religious syncretism and the restoration of the solar god to the first rank. For the sun was the only universally accessible god.51 The most beautiful hymns to Amon-Re, exalting him as the universal creator and cosmocrator, were composed at the beginning of the imperial period. Then too, the worship of the solar god as the supreme god prepared a certain religious unity: the supremacy of one and the same divine principle imposed itself progressively, from the Nile Valley to Syria and Anatolia. In Egypt this solar theology, with its universalist tendency, was fatefully involved in the existence of political tensions. During the Eighteenth Dynasty the temples of Amon-Re were considerably enlarged, and their revenues were increased tenfold. As the result of the Hyksos occupation, and above all of the liberation of Egypt by a Theban pharaoh, the gods were led to govern the business of the state more directly. This meant that the gods-and first of all AmonRe-communicated their advice through the priests. The high priest of Amon acquired considerable authority; his place was directly below the pharaoh. Egypt was in the course of becoming a theocracy; yet this did not diminish the struggle for power between the high priest and the pharaohs. It was this excessive politicization of the priestly hierarchy that stiffened the tension between different theological orientations into sometimes irreducible antagonisms.
32. Akh-en-Aton, or the unsuccessful reform
What has been called the" Amarna Revolution" (1375-1350), that is, the advancement of Aton, the solar disk, as sole supreme divinity,
50. See Wilson, Culture, pp. 189 tI. 51. For reasons that we have examined elsewhere (§ 20; see also Patterns in Comparative Religion, §§ 14, 30), the celestial gods had become dii oriosi.



Akh-en-Aton, or the unsuccessful reform 107
is partly explained by the determination of the Pharaoh Amen-hotep IV to free himself from the domination of the high priest. In fact, soon after his enthronement the young sovereign deprived the high priest of Amon of the administration of the god's properties, thus taking away the source of his power. Next, the pharaoh changed his name (" Amon-is-satisfied") to Akh-en-Aton (" He-who-servesAton "), abandoned the old capital, Thebes, the" city of Amon," and built another, 500 kilometers farther north, which he called AkhetAton (now Tell el-Amarna) and where he built palaces and temples of Aton. Unlike Amon's sanctuaries, Aton's were not roofed; the Sun could be worshiped in all his glory. This was not Akh-en-Aton's only innovation. In the figurative arts he encouraged the style later called Amarnan "naturalism," and, for the first time, the popular language was introduced into royal inscriptions and official decrees; in addition, the pharaoh renounced the strict conventionality imposed by etiquette and allowed spontaneity to govern relations with the members of his family and his intimates. All these innovations were justified by the religious value that Akh-en-Aton accorded to "truth" (maCat), hence to all that was "natural," in conformity with the rhythms oflife. For this sickly and almost deformed pharaoh, who was to die very young, had discovered the religious significance of the "joy of life," the bliss of enjoying Aton's inexhaustible creation, first of all, divine light. To impose his "reform," Akh-en-Aton ousted Amon and all the other gods 52 in favor of Aton, the Supreme God, identified with the solar disk, universal source of life: he was represented with his rays ending in hands, bringing his worshipers the symbol of life (the ankh). The essence of Akh-en-Aton's theology is found in two hymns addressed to Aton, the only ones that have been preserved. Beyond any doubt they represent one of the noblest Egyptian religious expressions. The Sun "is the beginning oflife," his rays "embrace all lands." "Though thou art very far away, thy rays are on the earth; even though thou art on the faces of men, thy traces are invisible."53 Aton is "the creator of the seed,in woman," and it is he who gives life to the

53. "When thou settest ... the Earth is in darkness, like unto death." It is during the night that wild beasts and snakes move about, and then "the world sinks into silence." Akh-en-Aton describes, with details that are surprisingly fresh, the miracle of dawn, the bliss shared by trees, flowers, birds, fish.

embryo and guards the birth and growth of the child-even as he also gives breath to the chick in the egg and later protects it. "How diverse are thy works! They are hidden before men, O! only God, beyond whom there is no another." 54 It is Aton who created all the lands, and men and women, and put each created thing in its proper place, supplying its needs. "The world subsists by thee!" "Each has his food." This hymn has rightly been compared to Psalm 104. There has even been discussion of the "monotheistic" character of Akh-enAton's reform. The originality and importance ofthis "first individual in history," as Breasted called him, are still disputed, but there can be no doubt of his religious fervor. The prayer found in his coffin contained these lines: "I go to breathe the sweet breath of thy mouth. Every day, I shall behold thy beauty.... Give me thy hands, laden with thy spirit, so thal I may receive thee and live by it. Call my name for all eternity: it will never fail to answer thy summons!" After thirty-three centuries, this prayer still keeps its power to move. During Akh-en-Aton's reign, and precisely because of his political and military passivity, Egypt had lost her Asiatic empire. His successor, Tut-ankh-Amon (1357-1349 B.C.), resumed relations with the high priest of Amon and returned to Thebes. The traces of the "Atonist reform" were largely obliterated. Soon afterward the last pharaoh of the long and glorious Eighteenth Dynasty died. According to the view generally accepted among scholars, the extinction of the Eighteenth Dynasty also marks the end of the creativity of the Egyptian genius. As for religious creations, we may wonder if their unpretentiousness until the foundation of the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris is not explained by the greatness and effectiveness of the syntheses worked out during the New Empire.55 For, from a certain point of view, these syntheses represent the high point of Egyptian religious thought: they constitute a perfectly articulated system that encourages only stylistic innovations. The better to grasp the importance of these theological syntheses, let us return for a moment to "Atonist monotheism." To begin, it
54. "Thou didst create the Earth ... when thou wert alone." "Thou madest the sky distant, so that thou mightest rise thither and look upon all that thou hast made!" 55. We are thinking, of course, of the religious elites to whom the deep meanings of these syntheses were accessible.



Final synthesis: The association Re-Osiris 109
must be made clear that the expression used by Akh-en-Aton in his hymn-the "only God, beyond whom there is no another"-had already been applied, a thousand years before the Amarna reform, to Amon, to Re, to Atum, and to other gods. In other words, as John Wilson observes, there were at least two gods, for Akh-en-Aton was himself worshiped as a divinity.56 The prayers of the faithful (that is, of the small group of court functionaries and dignitaries) were addressed not to Aton but directly to Akh-en-Aton. In his admirable hymn, the pharaoh declares that Aton is his personal god: "Thou art in my heart, and no one else knows thee except thy son (i.e., Akh-en-Aton) whom thou hast initiated into thy plans and thy power!" This explains the almost instantaneous disappearance of " Atonism" after Akh-en-Aton's death. In the last analysis, it was a devotion confined to the royal family and the courtiers. We must add that Aton was known and worshiped long before the Amarna reform.57 In The Book of What Is in the Beyond, Re is called "Lord ofthe Disk (Aton)." In other texts of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Amon (the "hidden god") is overlooked, while Re is described as the god whose "face is covered" and who "hides in the other world." In other words, Re's mysterious character and invisibility are declared to be complementary aspects of Aton, the god fully manifested in the solar disk. 58
33. Final synthesis: The association Re-Osiris
The theologians of the New Empire stress the complementarity of opposed, or even antagonistic, gods. In the Litany of Re, the solar god is called "The One-joined-together"; he is represented in the form of an Osiris mummy, wearing the crown of Upper Egypt. In other words, Osiris is imbued with the soul of Re.59 The identification of the two gods takes place in the person of the dead pharaoh: after the process of Osirification, the king revives as the young Re. For the sun's course represents the paradigmatic model of man's destiny: passage from one mode of being to another, from life to death and,

after that, to a new birth. Re's descent into the underworld signifies at once his death and his resurrection. A certain text speaks of "Re who goes to rest in Osiris, and Osiris who goes to rest in Re." 60 Numerous mythological allusions emphasize the twofold aspect of Re: solar and Osirian. By descending into the otherworld, the king becomes the equivalent of the binomial Osiris-Reo According to one of the texts cited above, Re "hides himself in the other world." Several invocations in the Litany (lines 20-23) emphasize the watery nature of Re and identify the solar god with the primordial ocean. But the union of contraries is principally expressed by the occult solidarity between Re and Osiris or between Horus and Seth.61 To use a brilliant formula of Rundle Clark (Myth and Symbol, p. 158), Re as transcendent and Osiris as emergent are the complementary forms of deity. In the last analysis, both represent the same "mystery," and especially the multiplicity of forms emanated by the one God.62 According to the theogony and cosmogony accomplished by Atum (§ 26), the divinity is at the same time one and multiple; the creation consists in the multiplication of his names and forms. The association and coalescence of the gods were operations familiar to Egyptian religious thought from the most remote antiquity. What makes the originality of the theology of the Empire is, on the one hand, the postulate of the twofold process of the Osirification of Re and the solarization of Osiris and, on the other hand, the conviction that this twofold process reveals the secret meaning of human existence: the complementarity between life and death. 63 From a certain point of view, this theological synthesis confirms the victory of Osiris at the same time that it gives him a new meaning. The triumph of the murdered god was already complete at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. From the Eighteenth Dynasty, Osiris becomes the judge of the dead. The two acts of the after-death drama -the "trial" and the "weighing of the heart"-take place in the
60. Piankoff, Ramesses VI, p. 35. 61. See the examples cited by Piankoff, Litany, p. 49, n. 3. 62. Already in the Pyramid Texts, Atum causes the gods to emanate from his own being. In his primordial-serpent form (see § 26) Atum has also been identified with Osiris (which implies that he, too, can "die") and, consequently, with Horus; see the texts cited and commented on by Piankoff, Litany, p. 11, n.2. 63. A similar effort, though in pursuit of different ends, was made in India from the period of the Briihmal:ws; see chapter 9.

presence of Osiris. Separate in the Coffin Texts, the" trial" and the "weighing of the soul" tend to become amalgamated in the Book of the Dead.64 These funerary texts, published during the Empire but containing earlier material, will enjoy an unequaled popularity until the end of Egyptian civilization. The Book of the Dead is the supreme guide of the soul in the beyond. The prayers and magical formulas that it contains are intended to facilitate the soul's journey and, above all, to insure its success in the ordeals of the "trial" and the "weighing of the heart." Among the archaic elements in the Book of the Dead, mention must be made of the danger of a "second death " (chaps. 44, 130, 135-36, 175-76) and the importance of preserving one's memory (chap. 90) and remembering one's name (chap. 25)-beliefs that are amply documented among the "primitives" but also in Greece and in ancient India. The work, however, reflects the theological syntheses of the Empire. A hymn to Re (chap. 15) describes the sun's daily journey; when he enters the world underground, he spreads joy. The dead "rejoice when thou shinest there for the great god Osiris, the master of eternity." No less significant is the dead person's desire to identify himself with a divinity: Re, Horus, Osiris, Anubis, Ptah, etc. This does not exclude the use of magical formulas. And indeed, to know the name of a god is equivalent to obtaining a certain power over him. The magical value of names, and of words in general, was certainly known from prehistory. For the Egyptians, magic was a weapon created by the gods for the defense of men. In the period of the Empire, magic is personified by a god who accompanies Re in his boat as an attribute of the solar god.65 In the last analysis, Re's nightly journey through the subterranean world, a dangerous descent, strewn with obstacles, constitutes the paradigmatic model of the journey of each dead person to the place of judgment.66 One of the most important chapters in the Book of the Dead,
64. Yoyotte, "Le jugement des morts dans I'Egypte ancienne," p. 45. It should be made clear that the judgment of the dead and the notion of a celestial justice "occurring after the death of all, men and kings," are clearly documented from the Ninth Dynasty (ibid., p. 64). 65. But the role of magical formulas finally becomes supreme, especially among the common people.

chapter 125, is devoted to the judgment of the soul in the great hall
called "Of the Two MaCats."67 The deceased's heart is suspended on one pan of the scales; on the other is a feather or an eye, symbols of maCat. During the operation, the deceased recites a prayer, imploring his heart not to bear witness against him. Then he must utter a declaration of innocence, erroneously termed the "negative confession" :
I have not committed evil against men.... I have not blasphemed a god. I have not done violence to a poor man.... I have not killed.... I have not caused anyone suffering. I have not cut down on the food{-income) in the temples, ... I am pure. I am pure. I am pure. I am pure.
The deceased addresses the forty-two gods who make up the tribunal: "Hail to you, ye gods who are here! I know you, I know your names. I shall not fall under your blows. You will not report that I am wicked to the god whose suite you form.... You will say that maCat is my due, in the presence of the Universal Master; for I have practiced maCat in Egypt." He utters his own eulogy: "I have satisfied God by that which he loves (to see done). I have given bread to him who was hungry, water to him who was thirsty, clothing to him who was naked, a boat to him who had none.... Save me then, protect me then! Make no report against me in the presence of the great god!" Finally he turns to Osiris: "0 god who art high on thy support ... mayest thou protect me from these messengers who sow evil and raise up troubles ... for I have practiced maCat for the sake of the Master of maCat. I am pure." 68 The deceased must also undergo an interrogation of the initiatory type. He must prove that he knows the secret names of the different parts of the door and the threshold, or the gatekeeper of the hall, and of the gods.69 It is by meditating on the mystery of death that the Egyptian genius realized the last religious synthesis, the only one that maintained its supremacy until the end of Egyptian civilization. It is, of

course, a creation susceptible of many interpretations and applications. The deep meaning of the binomial Re-Osiris or of the continuity life-death-transfiguration was not necessarily accessible to those believers who were convinced of the infallibility of magical formulas; nevertheless, these reflected the same eschatological gnosis. By developing the old conception of death as spiritual transmutation, the theologians of the Empire identified the models of this "mystery" at once in Re's daily exploits and in the primordial drama of Osiris. In this way they articulated in a single system what seemed the supreme example of the eternal and invulnerable (the course of the sun), what was only a tragic episode but, in the last analysis, a fortuitous one (the murder of Osiris), and what would seem by definition to be ephemeral and meaningless (human existence). In the articulation of this soteriology, the role of Osiris was essential. By virtue of him, every mortal could henceforth hope for a "royal destiny" in the other world. In the last analysis, the pharaoh constituted the universal model. The tension among "privilege," "initiatory wisdom," and "good works" is resolved in a way that can sometimes be deceptive. For if "justice" was always assured, "initiatory wisdom" could be reduced to the possession of magical formulas. Everything depended on the point of view assumed in respect to the eschatological summa, awkwardly connected in the Book of the Dead and other similar works. These texts were open to various "readings," performed on different levels. The magical reading was, of course, the easiest: it implied only faith in the omnipotence of the word. In proportion as, by virtue of the new eschatology, the "royal destiny" becomes universally accessible, the prestige of magic will not fail to increase. The twilight of Egyptian civilization will be dominated by magical beliefs and practices.70 But it is only right to remember that, in the "Memphite Theology" (cf. § 26), Ptah had created the gods and the world by the power of the Word.

5 Megaliths, Temples,
Ceremonial Centers: Occident, Mediterranean, Indus Valley
34. Stone and banana
The megalithic constructions of western and northern Europe have fascinated investigators for over a century. Indeed, it is impossible to look at a good photograph of the alignments at Carnac or the gigantic trilithons of Stonehenge without wondering what their purpose and meaning could have been. The technological ability of these farmers of the Age of Polished Stone arouses astonishment. How did thay manage to set 300-ton blocks in an upright position and lift lOO-ton slabs? Then, too, such monuments are not isolated. They form part of a whole megalithic complex, which extends from the Mediterranean coast of Spain, covers Portugal, half of France, the western seaboard of England, and continues into Ireland, Denmark, and the southern coast of Sweden. To be sure, there are significant morphological variations. But two generations of prehistorians have made every effort to demonstrate the continuity of all the European megalithic cultures-a continuity that could be explained only by dissemination of the megalithic complex from a center situated at Los Millares, in the province of Almeria. The megalithic complex comprises three categories of structures: (1) the menhir (from Breton men = "stone" and hir = "long") is a large stone, sometimes of considerable height,l set vertically into the ground; (2) the cromlech (from crom = "circle, curve," and lech = "place "), which designates a group of menhirs, set in a circle or half-circle (the most monumental is the cromlech of Stonehenge, near Salisbury); sometimes the menhirs are aligned in several parallel
1. The menhir located near Locmariaquer measured more than 20 meters in height. In Brittany certain isolated menhirs are associated with burials.



Stone and banana 115
rows, as at Carnac in Brittany; 2 (3) the dolmen (dol = "table" and men = "stone") is made up of an immense capstone supported by several upright stones arranged to form a sort of enclosure or chamber. Originally the dolmen was covered by a mound. Strictly speaking, dolmens are burial places. Later and in certain regions-western Europe, Sweden-the dolmen was transformed into a covered passage by the addition of a sort of vestibule in the form of a long corridor covered with capstones. Some dolmens are gigantic; the one at Soto (near Seville), for example, is 21 meters long and has as pediment a granite block 3.40 meters high, 3.10 meters wide, and 0.72 meters thick and weighing 21 tons. At Los Millares a necropolis of about a hundred covered passages has been excavated. Most of the graves are under enormous mounds. Certain burials contain as many as a hundred dead, representing several generations of the same gens. Sometimes the burial chambers have a central pillar, and remains of painting can still be discerned on the walls. Dolmens are found along the Atlantic, especially in Brittany, and as far as the Netherlands. In Ireland the funerary chambers, which are comparatively high, have walls decorated with sculptures. All this undoubtedly testifies to a very important cult of the dead. Whereas the houses of the Neolithic peasants who raised these monuments were modest and ephemeral (and in fact have left almost no traces), the dwellings for the dead were built of stone. It is obvious that there was an intention to construct imposing and solid works, capable of resisting time. The complexity of lithic symbolism and the religious valences of stones and rocks are well known.3 The rock, the slab, the granite block reveal duration without end, permanence, incorruptibility-in the last analysis a modality of existing independently of temporal becoming. When we contemplate the grandiose megalithic monuments of the earliest agriculturalists of western Europe, we cannot but call to mind a certain Indonesian myth. In the beginning, when the sky was very near to the earth, God hung his gifts on a cord in order to bestow them on the primordial couple. One day he sent them a stone, but the ancestors, surprised and indignant, refused it. Some days later God let the cord down again, this time with a banana, which
2. The alignments at Carnac comprise 2,935 menhirs on a terrain 3,900 meters long.

116 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
was immediately accepted. Then the ancestors heard the creator's voice: "Since you have chosen the banana, your life shall be like the life of that fruit. If you had chosen the stone, your life would have been like the existence of stone, unchangeable and immortal." 4 As we have seen (§ 12), the discovery of agriculture radically changed the conception of human existence: it proved to be as frail and ephemeral as the life of plants. Yet, on the other hand, man shared in the cyclical destiny of vegetation: birth, life, death, rebirth. The megalithic monuments could be interpreted as a response to our Indonesian myth: since man's life is like the life of cereals, strength and perenniality become accessible through death. The dead return to the bosom of Mother Earth, with the hope of sharing the destiny of sown seed; but they are also mystically associated with the stone blocks of the burial chambers and consequently become as strong and indestructible as rocks. For the megalithic cult of the dead appears to include not only a certainty of the soul's survival but, above all, confidence in the power of the ancestors and the hope that they will protect and help the living. Such a confidence differs radically from the concepts documented among other peoples of antiquity (Mesopotamians, Hittites, Hebrews, Greeks, etc.), for whom the dead were pitiable shades, unhappy and powerless. What is more: whereas for the megalithbuilders, from Ireland to Malta and the Aegean islands, ritual communion with the ancestors constituted the keystone of their religious activity, in the protohistorical cultures of central Europe, as n the ancient Near East, separation between the dead and the living was strictly prescribed. In addition to various ceremonies (processions, dances, etc.), the megalithic cult of the dead involved offerings (food, beverages, etc.), sacrifices performed in the vicinity of the monuments, and ritual meals on the burial places. A certain number of menhirs were erected independently of burials. In all probability, these stones constituted a sort of "substitute body," in which the souls of the dead were incorporated.5 In the last analysis, a stone "substitute" was a body
4. A. C. Kruijt, cited by J. G. Frazer, The Beliefin Immortality (1913), vol. 1, pp. 74-75. We have commented on this myth in "Mythologies of Death" (chap. 3 of Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions).

built for eternity. Menhirs are sometimes found decorated with human figures; in other words, they are the "dwelling," the "body" of the dead. Similarly, the stylized figures depicted on the walls of dolmens, together with the small idols excavated from the megalithic burial places of Spain, probably represented the ancestors. In certain cases a parallel belief can be discerned: the ancestor's soul is able to leave the tomb from time to time.6 The perforated stones that close certain megalithic tombs, and which, furthermore, are called "soul holes," allowed communication with the living. The sexual meaning of menhirs must also be taken into consideration, for it is universally documented, and on various levels of culture. Jeremiah (2: 27) refers to those "who say to a piece of wood, ' You are my father,' to a stone, ' You have begotten me.'" 7 Belief in the fertilizing virtues of menhirs was still common among European peasants at the beginning ofthis century. In France, in order to have children, young women performed the glissade (letting themselves slide along a stone) and the friction (sitting on monoliths or rubbing their abdomens against certain rocks).8 This generative function must not be explained by the phallic symbolism of the menhir, though such a symbolism is documented in certain cultures. The original, and fundamental, idea was the "transmutation" of the ancestors into stone, either by the device of a menhir as "substitute body" or by incorporating an essential element of the dead person-skeleton, ashes, " soul "-into the actual structure of the monument. In either case the dead person
6. Certain Breton menhirs, set up in front of the galleries of dolmens, have been explained by the Egyptian belief that the souls of the dead, transformed into birds, left their tombs to perch on a pillar in full sunlight. "This notion appears to have been entertained throughout the Mediterranean area and also in western Europe" (Maringer, The Gods of Prehistoric Man, p. 235). Carl Schuchhardt put forward the same interpretation for the obelisks painted on the sarcophagus of Hagia Triada (see § 41), on which birds are perched. But see the critique by Kirchner, "Die Menhire," p. 706 (offprint, p. 98). In the megalithic cultures of Southeast Asia, the menhir serves as "seat" for souls (cf. § 36). 7. Nevertheless, even such a vigorously Yahwistic treatise as Deuteronomy still uses the ontological metaphor of stone when it proclaims the absolute reality of God as sole source of creativity: "You forget the Rock who begot you, unmindful now of the God who fathered you" (Deut. 32:18). 8. See some examples and the bibliography in Patterns in Comparative Religion, § 77, to which Kirchner, "Die Menhire," pp. 650 ff. (offprint, p. 42) should be added.



118 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
"animated" the stone; he inhabited a new body that, being mineral, was imperishable. Hence the menhir or the megalithic tomb constituted an inexhaustible reservoir of vitality and power. By virtue of their projection into the structures of the funerary stones, the dead became masters of fertility and prosperity. In the language of the Indonesian myth, they had succeeded in taking possession of both the stone and the banana.
35. Ceremonial centers and megalithic constructions
Certain megalithic complexes, such as the one at Carnac or the one at Ashdown, in Berkshire (containing 800 megaliths in a parallelogram 250 by 500 meters), undoubtedly constituted important ceremonial centers. The festivals included sacrifices and, it may be presumed, dances and processions. Indeed, thousands of men could move in procession along the great avenue at Carnac. Probably most of the festivals were connected with the cult of the dead. Like other similar English monuments,9 the Stonehenge cromlech was situated in the middle of a field of funeral barrows. This famous ceremonial center constituted, at least in its primitive form,IO a sanctuary built to insure relations with the ancestors. In terms of structure, Stonehenge can be compared with certain megalithic complexes developed, in other cultures, from a sacred area: temples or cities. We have the same valorization of the sacred space as "center of the world," the privileged place that affords communication with heaven and the underworld, that is, with the gods, the chthonian goddesses, and the spirits ofthe dead. In certain parts of France, in the Iberian Peninsula, and elsewhere, traces have been found of a cult of the Goddess, the guardian divinity of the dead. Yet nowhere else did megalithic architecture, the cult of the dead, and worship of a Great Goddess find such spectacular expression as on Malta. Excavations have brought to light very few houses; but up to now seventeen temples have been

discovered, and their number is thought to be still greater, which justifies the opinion of certain scholars that during the Neolithic period Malta was an isola sacra.ll The vast elliptical terraces that stretched before the sanctuaries or between them certainly served for processional and ritual choreography. The temple walls are decorated with admirable spirals in low relief, and a number of stone sculptures representing women lying on one side have been excavated. But the most sensational discovery is the enormous statue of a womancertainly a goddess-in a seated position. The excavations have revealed an elaborate cult, with animal sacrifices, food offerings and libations, and rites of incubation and divination, indicating the existence of an important and wellorganized sacerdotal body. The cult of the dead probably played the central role. In the remarkable necropolis at Hal Saflieni, now called the Hypogeum and comprising several chambers cut into the rock, the bones of some 7,000 persons have been exhumed. It is the Hypogeum that has yielded the statues of recumbent women, suggesting an incubation rite. Just as in other megalithic monuments, the inner rooms have their walls sculptured and painted. These large chambers served for certain religious ceremonies reserved for priests and initiates, for they were isolated by carved screens.12 Whereas the Hypogeum was at once necropolis and chapel, no burials have been found in the temples. The curvilinear structure of the Maltese sanctuaries seems to be unique; the archeologists describe it as" kidney-shaped," but according to Zuntz their structure more nearly suggests that of the womb. Since the temples were covered by a roof and the rooms were without windows and rather dark, entering a sanctuary was equivalent to entering the" bowels of the earth," i.e., the womb of the chthonian Goddess. But the rockcut tombs are also womb-shaped. One would say that the dead person is placed in the bosom of the earth for a new life. "The temples reproduce the same model on a large scale. The living who enter them enter the body of the goddess." Indeed, Zuntz concludes, these monuments constitute the stage for "a mystery-cult in the exact sense of the word."13

120 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
We will add that the surfaces of the dolmens and menhirs of Iberia and western Europe also display other magico-religious signs and symbols-for example, the image of a sun with rays, the sign of the ax (peculiar to storm gods), the snake, symbol of life, associated with figures of the ancestors, the stag, etc. To be sure, these figures have been discovered in different regions and belong to cultures of different ages, but they have in common the fact that they are bound up with the same megalithic complex. This may be explained either by the variety of religious ideas held by the different "megalithic" peoples or by the fact that the cult of ancestors, despite its importance, was associated with different religious complexes.
36. The" enigma of the megaliths"
A decade ago archeologists explained the megalithic cultures by influences from colonizers arrived from the eastern Mediterranean, where, in fact, collective burials are already documented in the third millennium.14 In the course of its dissemination into the West, the construction of dolmens (" chamber tombs") was transformed into cyclopean architecture. According to Glyn Daniel, this transformation took place on Malta, in the Iberian Peninsula, and in southern France. The same writer compares the dissemination of megalithic architecture with the Greek and Phoenician colonization in the Mediterranean or the expansion of Islam into Spain. "It was a powerful, compelling, Aegean-inspired religion that made them build their tombs (or their tomb temples?) with such labor and preserve ... the image of their tutelary and funerary goddess. The goddess figure, the axe, the horns, and other symbols take us back from the Paris Basin, from Gavrinnis, from Anghelu Raju to Crete, the Aegean, even Troy. It cannot be disputed that a powerful religion of east Mediterranean origin informed and inspired the builders of the megalithic tombs as they spread through western Europe."15 But religion was not the primary cause oftheir migrations; religion was only "the solace of their exile in the far west and the

enclosures, usually called tholoi; see Glyn Daniel, The Megalithic Builders 0/ Western Europe, 2d ed. (1962), p. 129. 15. Ibid., p. 136.



The "enigma of the megaliths" 121
north of Europe." The emigrants were seeking new countries to live in and ores for their trade. IS In his last book, Gordon Childe discussed a "megalithic religion," disseminated by Mediterranean prospectors and colonizers. Once accepted, the idea of building megalithic tombs was adapted by the various societies, without, however, affecting their specific structures. Each tomb probably belonged to a nobleman or to the head of a family; the labor was supplied by his companions. "A megalithic tomb should be compared to a church rather than a castle, and its occupants to Celtic saints rather than to Norman barons."17 The "missionaries" of the megalithic faith, a religion above all of the Mother Goddess, attracted a large number of agriculturalists to their communities. And in fact the dolmens and cromlechs are located in the regions most suitable for Neolithic agriculture.IS Similar explanations of the megalithic complex have been proposed by other eminent prehistorians.19 However, these explanations were invalidated by the discovery of dating by the radioactivity of carbon and by dendrochronology.20 It has been possible to show that the megalithic sepulchers (" chamber tombs") of Brittany were built before 4000 B.C. and that in England and Denmark stone tombs
were being built before 3000 B.C.21 As for the gigantic complex of Stonehenge, it was thought to be contemporary with the Wessex culture, which was linked with the Mycenaean civilization. But

Stuart Piggott derives the megalithic monuments from the eastern Mediterranean and compares them with Christian churches or mosques; see his Ancient Europe, p. 60.

For this "tree-ring calibration of radiocarbon," see a clear exposition in Colin Renfrew, Before Civilization, pp. 48-83. As is well known, the two "revolutions"-dating by carbon 14 and by dendrochronology-radically altered the chronology of European prehistory.
21. It should be born in mind that in Egypt the earliest stone pyramids
were erected about 2700 B.C. It is true that these pyramids had predecessors of brick, but the fact remains that, before 3000 B.C., we know of no Egyptian stone monument comparable to the megaliths of western Europe; see Renfrew, Before Civilization, p. 123.



122 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
analyses based on the recent methods prove that Stonehenge was finished before Mycenae; its last rebuilding (Stonehenge III) dates from 2100--1900 B.C.22 SO too on Malta, the period represented by the Tarxien temples and the necropolis of Hal Saflieni had ended before 2000 B.C.; hence certain of its characteristic features cannot be explained by an influence from the Minoan Bronze Age.23 So the conclusion is inescapable that the European megalithic complex precedes the Aegean contribution. We are dealing with a series of original autochthonous creations. However, the chronological "upset" and the demonstration of the originality of the western populations have not advanced the interpretation of the megalithic monuments. There has been much discussion concerning Stonehenge, but, despite some noteworthy contributions,24 the religious function and the symbolism of the monument are still disputed. Furthermore, in reaction against certain risky hypotheses (for example, that of Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, who derived all the megalithic constructions from the one source of pharaonic Egypt), investigators no longer dare to attack the problem as a whole. But this timidity is regrettable, for "megalithism" is an exemplary, and probably unique, subject of study. Indeed, comparative research should be able to show to what extent the analysis of the numerous megalithic cultures that were still flourishing in the nineteenth century can contribute to an understanding of the religious concepts held by the originators of the prehistoric monuments.
37. Ethnography and prehistory
It is well known that, outside of the Mediterranean and western and northern Europe, megaliths of prehistoric and protohistoric origin are spread over a vast area: Algeria, Palestine, Abyssinia, the Deccan,

Zuntz, however, thinks of an Egyptian or Sumerian influence (Persephone, pp. 10 fT.). 24. Since the tectonic structure of Stonehenge seems also to imply the function of an astronomical observatory, it is probable that the chief festivals were related to the changes of the seasons, as among the Hopis and the Cherokees; see Renfrew, Be/ore Civilization, pp. 239 fT.



Ethnography and prehistory 123
Assam, Ceylon, Tibet, and Korea. As for the megalithic cultures that were still alive at the beginning of the twentieth century, the most notable are documented in Indonesia and Melanesia. Robert HeineGeldern, who devoted part of his life to studying this problem, held that the two groups of megalithic cultures-those of prehistory and those of cultures at the ethnographic stage-are historically connected, for in his view the megalithic complex was disseminated from a single center, very probably the eastern Mediterranean. We shall later return to Heine-Geldern's hypothesis. For the moment, we may appropriately summarize his conclusions regarding the beliefs typical of the living megalithic societies. Megaliths have a relation to certain ideas concerning existence after death. The majority of them are built in the course of ceremonies intended to defend the soul during its journey into the beyond; but they also insure an eternal postexistence, both to those who raise them during their own lifetime and to those for whom they are built after death. In addition, megaliths constitute the unrivaled connection between the living and the dead; they are believed to perpetuate the magical virtues of those who constructed them or for whom they were constructed, thus insuring the fertility of men, cattle, and harvests. In all the megalithic cultures that still flourish, the cult of ancestors plays an important part.25 The monuments serve as the seat of the souls of the dead when they come back to visit the village, but they are also used by the living. The place where the megaliths stand is at once the outstanding cult site (ceremonial choreography, sacrifices, etc.) and the center of social activity. In the megalithic-type cult of the dead, genealogies play an important part. According to Heine-Geldern, it is probable that the genealogies of the ancestors-that is, of the founders of villages and of certain families-were ritually recited. It is important to emphasize this fact: man hopes that his name will be remembered through the agency of stone,' in other words, connection with the ancestors is insured by memory of their names and exploits, a memory" fixed" in the megaliths. As we have just observed, Heine-Geldern claims for the megalithic civilizations a continuity extending from the fifth millennium down to the contemporary "primitive" societies. However, he rejects G.

Elliot Smith's and J. W. Perry's pan-Egyptian hypothesis. In addition, he denies the existence of a "megalithic religion," for the simple reason that certain" megalithic" beliefs and concepts are documented in connection with many religious forms, both elementary and higher. The Austrian scholar compares the megalithic complex with certain "mystical" movements-for example, Tantrism, which can be indifferently either Hindu or Buddhist. He also denies the existence of a "megalithic cultural circle," made up, according to certain authors, of particular myths and characteristic social or economic institutions; and in fact megalithic ideas and practices are documented among populations that possess a great variety of social forms, economic structures, and cultural institutions.26 The analysis of the megalithic complex accomplished by HeineGeldern still has value. But his hypotheses concerning the unity of ancient and contemporary megalithic cultures are today disputed, or simply ignored, by many investigators. The problem of the "continuity" of the megalithic complex is substantial and must remain open. For, as a certain author put it recently, it represents "the greatest enigma of prehistory." In any case-and whatever hypothesis is adopted, whether continuity or convergence-it is impossible to speak of one megalithic culture. For our purpose, it should be noted that, in the megalithic religions, the sacrality of stone is chiefly valorized in relation to postexistence. The attempt is made to "found" a particular mode of existence after death by means of the ontophany peculiar to stones. In the megalithic cultures of western Europe, the fascination exercised by stone in masses is obvious; but it is a fascination aroused by the desire to transform collective burials into spectacular and indestructible monuments. By virtue of the megalithic constructions the dead enjoy an exceptional power; however, since communication with the ancestors is ritually assured, this power can be shared by the living. To be sure, other forms of the cult of ancestors exist. What characterizes the megalithic religions is the fact that the ideas ofperenniality and of continuity between life and death are apprehended through the exaltation of the ancestors as identified, or associated, with the stones. We will add, however, that these religious ideas were not fully realized and perfectly expressed except in a few privileged creations.

The first cities of India 125
38. The first cities of India
Recent researches into the prehistory of Indian civilization have opened perspectives that were unforeseeable a few decades ago. They also raised problems that have not yet received satisfactory solutions. The excavation of the two cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, brought to light a quite advanced urban civilization, at once mercantile and theocratic. The chronology is still in dispute, but it appears certain that the Indus civilization was fully developed about 2500 B.C. What most struck the directors of the earliest excavations was the uniformity and stagnation of the Harappan civilization. No change, no innovation, could be discerned in the thousand years of its history. The two towns were probably the capitals of the "empire." This uniformity and continuity can be explained only by supposing a regime based on some kind of religious authority.27 Today this culture is known to have extended far beyond the Indus Valley, and it everywhere presented the same uniformity. Gordon Childe considered Harappan technology to be equal to those of Egypt and Mesopotamia. However, the majority of its products lack imagination, "suggesting that the people of Harappa had their eyes on things not ofthis world." 28 As for the origin of this earliest urban civilization to develop in India, scholars are agreed in looking for it in Baluchistan. According to Fairservis, the ancestors of the Harappans were descended from the pre-Aryan agriculturalists of Iran. Certain phases of the preHarappan culture are beginning to be better known as a result of the excavations made in southern Baluchistan. It is noteworthy that the earliest important agglomerations were built near structures that had a ceremonial function. In the important archeological complex excavated in the region of the Porali River and known as the" Edith Shahr Complex," a mound 7 to 12 meters high has been brought to light, together with a number of structures surrounded by walls. At its summit the mound rose in the form of a ziggurat; several stairways led to the platform. The structures in stone seem to have been seldom and sporadically inhabited, which indicates that the function of the entire edifice was ceremonial. The second phase of the same complex (phase B) is characterized by the presence of great stone circles, by

126 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
more than a hundred buildings, 3 to 8 meters wide, and by "avenues" of white stones. These structures, too, appear to have served only religious objectives.29 Fairservis compares these sacred sites, and in general the structures excavated in the Quetta Valley (representing the pre-Harappan phases of Sind and Baluchistan), with Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, cities that he considers were originally built for cult ceremonies. This hypothesis is still disputed, though there is no doubt concerning the religious function of the" citadel," a platform comprising characteristic structures, which are the same in the two cities. For our purpose the controversy is of little interest. For, on the one hand, the cult origin of the pre-Harappan agglomerations (hence, of the earliest cities!) is certain, and, on the other hand, scholars today agree in seeing ceremonial complexes in the most ancient urban centers. Paul Wheatley has brilliantly demonstrated the religious intention and function of the earliest cities in China, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Central America, and elsewhere.30 The most ancient cities were built around sanctuaries, that is, close to a sacred space, a "center of the world," where communication between earth, heaven, and the subterranean regions was deemed possible.31 If it could be shown that the two capital cities ofthe Indus are clearly different from their pre-Harappan prototypes (and from other ancient cities), Harappa and Mohenjodaro would have to be considered the first examples of the secularization of an urban structure, which is an essentially modern phenomenon. What needs to be emphasized for the moment is the morphological diversity of the sacred space and the cult center. In the megalithic cultures of the Mediterranean and western Europe, the ceremonial center, bound up with the cult of the dead, was consecrated by menhirs and dolmens, seldom by sanctuaries, and the agglomerations did not exceed the dimensions of villages.32 As we have seen, the real

Protohistorical religious concepts and Hinduism 127
megalithic "cities" in the West were built for the dead: they were necropolises.
39. Protohistorical religious concepts and their parallels in Hinduism
The Harappan religion-that is, the religion of the first urban civilization of India-is also important for another reason: its relationship with Hinduism. Despite the skepticism of some authors, the religious life of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa is accessible to us, at least in its general outlines. Thus, for example, a great number of figurines and certain designs inscribed on seals indicate cults of a Mother Goddess. In addition, as Sir John Marshall had already recognized, an ithyphallic figure seated in a "yogic" position and surrounded by wild animals represents a Great God, probably a prototype of Siva.33 Fairservis has called attention to the large number of scenes of worship or sacrifice depicted on the seals. The most famous one shows a figure seated (or dancing) on a platform between two kneeling suppliants, each accompanied by a cobra. Other seals feature a personage immobilizing two tigers, in the manner of Gilgamesh, or a horned god with the legs and tail of a bull, suggesting the Mesopotamian Enkidu; there are also various tree spirits, to which sacrifices are being brought, processions of people carrying "standards," etc.34 In the scenes painted on certain urns excavated at Harappa, Vats believed that he could identify the souls of the dead preparing to cross a stream.35 Since Sir John Marshall, scholars have emphasized the" Hinduistic" character of the Harappan religion. Aside from the examples already cited-the Great Goddess, a proto-Siva in "yogic" position, the ritual value of trees and snakes and the lingam-we may mention the "Grand Bath" at Mohenjo-daro, which resembles the bathing pools of modern Hindu temples, the pipa/ tree, the use of the turban (unknown in the Vedic texts, documented only after the period of the

BriihmaIJas), nasal ornaments, the ivory comb, etc.36 The historical process that insured the transmission of a part of the Harappan heritage and its absorption into Hinduism is inadequately known. Scholars are still discussing the causes for the decadence and ultimate ruin of the two capital cities. The catastrophic floods of the Indus have been suggested, as have the consequences of desiccation, seismic movements,37 and the attacks of the Aryan invaders. It would seem probable that the decline had multiple causes. In any case, about 1750 B.C. the Indus civilization was on its deathbed, and the Indo-Aryans only gave it its mortal blow (cf. § 64). But it must be made clear, on the one hand, that the invasion by the Aryan tribes took place progressively, during several centuries, and, on the other hand, that in the South, in the region formerly known as Saurashtra, a culture derived from the nuclear Harappan complex continued its
development after the Aryan thrust.38 Twenty years ago we wrote concerning the destruction of the Indus culture:
The collapse of an urban civilization is not equivalent to the simple extinction of its culture, but merely to that culture's regression to rural, larval, "popular" forms. (This phenomenon was amply demonstrated in Europe during and after the great barbarian invasions.) But before very long the Aryanization of the Punjab launched the great movement of synthesis that was one day to become Hinduism. The considerable number of "Harappan" elements found in Hinduism can be explained only by a contact, begun quite early, between the Indo-European conquerors and the representatives of the Indus culture. These representatives were not necessarily the authors of the Indus culture or their direct descendants; they might be tributaries, by dissemination, of certain Harappan cultural forms, which they had preserved in eccentric regions, spared by the first waves of Aryanization. This would explain the following apparently strange fact: the cult of the Great Goddess and of Siva, phallism and tree worship, asceticism and Yoga, etc., appear for the first time in India as the religious

expression of a high urban civilization, that of the Indus-whereas, in medieval and modern India, these religious elements are characteristic of "popular" cultures. To be sure, from the Harappan period on, there was certainly a synthesis between the spirituality of the Australoid aborigines and that ofthe "masters," the authors of the urban civilization. But we must presume that it was not only this synthesis that was preserved, but also the specific and almost exclusive contribution of the "masters " (a contribution related especially to their theocratic conceptions). Otherwise it would be impossible to explain the considerable importance assumed by the Brahmans after the Vedic period. Very probably all these Harappan religious conceptions (which strongly contrast with those of the Indo-Europeans) were preserved, with inevitable regressions, among the "popular" strata, in the margin of the society and civilization of the new Aryan-speaking masters. Very probably it is from there that they welled up, in successive waves, during the later synthesis that ended in the formation of Hinduism.39
Since that was published (1954), other proofs of continuity have been adduced.40 What is more, similar processes are documented elsewhere, notably in Crete, in continental Greece, and in the Aegean region as a whole, where the Hellenic culture and religion are the result of a symbiosis between the Mediterranean substratum and the Indo-European conquerors from the north. Here, just as in India, the religious ideas and beliefs of the autochthonous inhabitants are accessible chiefly through the archeological data, whereas the earliest texts-Homer and Hesiod first of all-largely reflect the traditions of the Aryan-speaking invaders. It must be made clear, however, that Homer and Hesiod already represent the first phases of the Hellenic synthesis.

newcomers were masters of the metallurgical techniques of copper and bronze. Sir Arthur Evans called their culture" Minoan," after the legendary King Minos, and divided it into three periods: Early Minoan (about the end of the third millennium); Middle Minoan (from the building of the palaces of Cnossus and Mallia, 2000 B.C.1580 B.C.); and Late Minoan (1580-1150 B.C.)Y During the Middle Minoan the Cretans used a hieroglyphic script, followed, about 1700 B.C., by a linear script (Linear A); neither has yet been deciphered. It is during this period (between 2000 and 1900 B.C.) that the first Greeks, the Minyans, entered continental Greece. They represent the advance guard of the Indo-European groups that, in successive waves, will come to settle in Hellas, in the islands, and on the littoral of Asia Minor. The first phase of Late Minoan (1580-1450 B.C.) constitutes the apogee of the Minoan civilization. This is the period during which, in the Peloponnesus, the Aryan-speaking invaders build Mycenae and maintain relations with Crete. Not long afterward (1450-1400 B.C.) the Mycenaeans (or Achaeans) settle at Cnossus and introduce the type of script known as Linear B. The last phase of Late Minoan, called the Mycenaean Period (1400-1150 B.C.), ends with the invasion by the Dorians and the final destruction ofthe Cretan civilization. Until Ventris deciphered Linear B in 1952, the only documents for Minoan culture and religion came from archeological excavations. They are still the most important. The first indications of acts having a religious intention were discovered in caves. In Crete, as everywhere else in the Mediterranean, caves long served as dwelling places, but also, especially since the Neolithic, as cemeteries (a custom that has survived down to modern times). However, a considerable number of caves were consecrated to various autochthonous divinities. Certain rites, myths, and legends associated with these powerhaunted caves were later incorporated into the religious traditions of the Greeks. Thus, one of the most celebrated, the cave at Amnisos, near Cnossus, was consecrated to Eileithyia, a pre-Hellenic goddess of childbirth. Another, on Mount Dicte,42 was famous for having

sheltered the infant Zeus; it was there that the future master of Olympus came into the world, and the nursling's cries were smothered under the clashing of the Curetes' shields. The armed dance of the Curetes probably constituted an initiation ceremony, performed by the young men's brotherhoods (cf. § 83). For certain caves were used by the brotherhoods for their secret rites-for example, the cave on Mount Ida, which was the scene of the assemblies of the Dactyls, the mythological personification ofa brotherhood ofmaster metallurgists. As is well known, caves played a religious role from the Paleolithic. The labyrinth takes over and enlarges this role; entering a cave or a labyrinth was equivalent to a descent into Hades, in other words, to a ritual death of the initiatory type. The mythology of the famous labyrinth of Minos is obscure and fragmentary, but its most dramatic episodes are connected with an initiation. The original meaning of this mythico-ritual scenario was probably forgotten long before the first written documents that attest to it. The saga of Theseus, and especially his entrance into the labyrinth and his victorious fight with the Minotaur, will engage our attention later (§ 94). But it is appropriate at this point to mention the ritual function of the labyrinth as initiatory ordeal. The excavations at Cnossus have revealed no trace of Daedalus' fabulous handiwork. Nevertheless, the labyrinth appears on Cretan coins of the classic period, and labyrinths are mentioned in connection with other cities. As for its etymology, the word had been explained as meaning "house of the double ax" (labrys), in other words, designating the royal palace of Cnossus. But the Achaean word for "ax" was pelekys (cf. Mesopotamian pilakku). More probably the term derives from the Asiatic labra/laura, "stone," "cave." Hence "labyrinth" designated an underground quarry, hewn out by human hands. And in fact the cave of Ampelusia, near Gortyna, is still called a "labyrinth" in our day.43 For the moment, we will point out the archaism of the ritual role of caves. We shall return to the persistence of this role, for it admirably illustrates the continuity of certain religious ideas and initiatory scenarios, from prehistory down into modern times (§ 92). Feminine figurines increase in number during the Neolithic; they are characterized by their bell-shaped skirt, which leaves the breasts

bare, and their arms, raised in a gesture of worship. Whether they represent ex votos or "idols," these figurines indicate the religious preeminence of woman and, above all, the primacy of the Goddess. Later documents confirm and define this primacy. If we judge by the representations of processions, palace festivals, and scenes of sacrifice, women played a large part in all these activities.44 The goddesses are represented veiled or partly naked, pressing their breasts or raising their arms in token of benediction.45 Other images represent them as Mistress of Wild Beasts (potnia theron). A seal from Cnossus shows the Lady of the Mountains pointing her scepter down toward a male worshiper, who covers his eyes.46 On the intaglios, the goddess is seen preceded by a lion, or grasping a doe or a ram, or standing between two animals, etc. As we shall see, the Mistress of Wild Beasts survives in Greek mythology and religion (cf. § 92). The cult was celebrated on the summits of mountains as well as in palace chapels or private houses. And everywhere the goddesses are found at the center of religious activity. The beginning of the Middle Minoan (2100-1900 B.C.) furnishes our earliest evidence for sanctuaries on high places. At first these are only modest enclosures; later they are small edifices. In the sanctuaries at Petsofa, as on Mount Juktas, the thick layer of ashes has yielded a number of human and animal figures in terra cotta. Nilsson holds that a goddess of nature was worshiped there, with casting of votive figurines into fires that were periodically ignited.47 More complex, and still enigmatic, are the so-called agrarian or vegetation cults. Of rural origin, they were incorporated, at least symbolically, into the palace services. But they were chiefly celebrated in the sacred enclosures. To judge from intaglios and the paintings and reliefs on vases, these cults comprised dances, processions of sacred objects, and lustrations. Trees played a central role. The iconographic documents show various personages in the act of touching leaves, worshiping the goddess of vegetation, or performing ritual dances. Certain scenes

stress the extravagant, not to say ecstatic, nature of the rite: a naked woman passionately clasps the trunk of a tree; an officiant pulls the tree away with averted face, while his companion appears to be weeping on a tomb.48 Such scenes have been rightly viewed as depicting not only the yearly drama of vegetation but also the religious experience inspired by discovering the mystical solidarity between man and plant (cf. §§12, 14).49
41. Characteristic features of Minoan religion
According to Picard, "as yet, we have no proof of the existence of an adult male god." 50 The goddess is sometimes escorted by an armed acolyte, but his role is obscure. Nevertheless, certain vegetation gods were undoubtedly known, for the Greek myths refer to hierogamies that took place in Crete, hierogamies characteristic of the agrarian religions. Persson has attempted, on the basis of iconographic representations, to reconstruct the ritual scenario of the periodical death and resurrection of vegetation. The Swedish scholar believed that he could place the different scenes of the cult in the seasons of the agrarian cycle: spring (epiphany of the goddess of nature and her worship by officiants, etc.); summer (epiphany of the god of vegetation, etc.); winter (ritual laments; scenes representing the departure of the divinities, etc.).51 Some of these interpretations are persuasive, but the reconstruction of the whole scenario is disputed. What seems to be certain is that the majority of the iconographic documents had a religious meaning and that the cult was centered on the" mysteries" of life, death, and rebirth; hence it included initiation rites, funerary laments, orgiastic and ecstatic ceremonies. As Francis Vian rightly emphasizes:
It would be a mistake to conclude, from the smallness of the places devoted to it, that religion played little part in the princely dwellings. The fact is that it is the palace in its entirety that is sacred, for

it is the residence of the divine patroness and of the priest-king who serves as intercessor between her and men. The dance floors surrounded by tiers of steps, the inner courts in which altars stand, the storerooms themselves, are religious installations. The throne was an object of veneration, as is proved by the symbolic griffons that flank it at Cnossus and Pylos; possibly it was even reserved for the epiphany of the goddess rather than for the sovereign.52
It is important to emphasize the function of the palace as ceremonial center. The sacred bullfights, in which the bull was not killed, were performed in the spaces surrounded by tiers of steps, the socalled theatrical areas of the palaces. Paintings at Cnossus show us acrobats of both sexes vaulting over bulls. Despite Nilsson's skepticism, the religious meaning of" acrobats" is indubitable: passing across the running bull constitutes a perfect initiatory ordeal.53 Very probably the legend of Theseus' companions, seven youths and seven maidens" offered" to the Minotaur, reflects the memory of such an initiatory ordeal. Unfortunately, we know nothing of the mythology of the divine bull and his role in the cult. Probably the specifically Cretan cult object known as "horns of consecration" represents the stylization of the frontal aspect of a bull. Its omnipresence confirms the importance of its religious function: the horns served to consecrate objects placed between them. The religious meaning and the symbolism of a certain number of cult objects are still in dispute. The double ax was certainly used in sacrifices. It is found in an area of considerable extent outside of Crete. In Asia Minor, as symbol of the thunderbolt, it is the emblem of the storm god. But as early as the Paleolithic, it is also found beside a naked goddess in Iraq, at Tell Arpachiyah. In Crete, too, the double ax is seen in the hands of women-priestesses or goddessesor on their heads. Taking into consideration its double cutting edge, Evans explained it as an emblem symbolizing the union of the complementary masculine and feminine principles. Columns and pillars probably shared in the cosmological symbolism of the axis mundi, already documented from prehistory on

(cf. §12). The colonnettes surmounted by birds can be variously interpreted, since the bird can represent the soul as well as the epiphany of a goddess. In any case, columns and pillars replace the goddess, "for they are sometimes seen, like her, flanked by lions or griffons heraldically attached." 54 The cult of the dead played a considerable part. Corpses were introduced from above into the deep chambers of the ossuaries. As elsewhere in Asia Minor and the Mediterranean, underground libations were bestowed on the dead. The living could go down into certain chambers, furnished with benches for the cult. Probably the funeral service was performed under the auspices of the Goddess (cf. § 35). In fact, the rock-cut tomb of a priest-king of Cnossus comprised a pillared crypt, whose blue-painted ceiling represented the celestial vault; above, a chapel resembling the palace sanctuaries of the Mother Goddess had been built.55 The most precious, but also the most enigmatic, document concerning Cretan religion is constituted by the two decorated panels of a sarcophagus excavated at Hagia Triada. To be sure, this document reflects the religious ideas of its period (thirteenth to twelfth centuries), when the Mycenaeans were already established in Crete. Nevertheless, insofar as the scenes depicted on the panels are susceptible of a coherent interpretation, they evoke Minoan and Oriental beliefs and customs. One of the panels depicts the sacrifice of a bull: three priestesses advance toward it in procession; on the other side of the victim, whose throat has been cut, a blood sacrifice before a sacred tree is shown. On the second panel we see the completion of the funeral libation : a priestess pours the red liquid into a large urn. The last scene is the most mysterious: in front of his tomb, the dead man, in a long robe, lends his presence to the funerary offering; three male sacrificers bring him a small boat and two calves.56

55. Evans, Palace of Minos, vol. 4, pt. 2, pp. 962 ff. Picard cites the tradition transmitted by Diodorus (4. 76-80; 16. 9), according to which Minos was buried in a crypt-tomb over which a temple dedicated to Aphrodite, who inherited the role of the Aegean Goddess, was built (Religions prehistoriques, p. 173). 56.

A number of scholars, judging from his appearance (according to Picard, "one would say a mummy"), hold that the dead man is deified. The hypothesis is plausible. The representation would then be of a privileged person, such as the priest-king of Cnossus or one of the Greek heroes (Heracles, Achilles, Menelaus). However, it seems more likely that the scenes suggest, not the dead man's divinization, but the accomplishment of his initiation, a ceremony of the mystery-religion type, able to insure him a happy postexistence. And in fact Diodorus (first century B.C.) had already noted the similarity between the Cretan religion and the mystery religions. Now this type of religion will later be suppressed in so-called Dorian Greece and will live on only within certain closed societies, the thiasoi (perhaps a pre-Hellenic word).57 The tradition transmitted by Diodorus is of the highest interest, for it indicates the limits of the process of assimilation of Oriental and Mediterranean religious ideas by the Aryan-speaking conquerors.
42. Continuity of the pre-Hellenic religious structures
The deciphering of Linear B has proved that, about 1400 B.C., Greek was spoken and written at Cnossus. It follows, therefore, that the Mycenaean invaders played a decisive part not only in the destruction of the Minoan civilization but also in its final period; in other words, during its last phase Cretan civilization also included continental Greece. If we consider the fact that, before the invasion by the Mycenaeans, influences from Egypt and Asia Minor 58 had resulted in an Asianic-Mediterranean synthesis, we can gauge the antiquity and complexity of the Greek cultural phenomenon. Hellenism sends its roots into Egypt and Asia; but it is the contribution of the Mycenaean conquerors that will produce the "Greek miracle." The tablets unearthed at Cnossus, Pylos, and Mycenae mention the Homeric gods under their classical names: Zeus, Hera, Athena, Poseidon, and Dionysus. Unfortunately, the information they afford regarding mythology and cult is rather meager; mention is

58. It should be noted that the influences were also exercised in the opposite direction.



Continuity ofpre-Hellenic religious structures 137
made of Zeus Dictaeus and of Daedalus, of "slaves of the god," of the "slave of Athena," of names of priestesses, etc. Decidedly more significant is the fame of Crete in the mythology and religion of classical Greece. It is in Crete that Zeus was held to have had his birth and death; Dionysus, Apollo, Heracles performed their childhood exploits in Crete; it is there that Demeter loved Iasion and that Minos received the laws and, with Rhadamanthys, became judge in Hades. And it was still from Crete that, at the height of the classical period, accredited purifiers were summoned.59 The island was endowed with the fabulous virtues of the period of the primordium: for classical Greece, Minoan Crete shared in the prodigies of "origins" and of " autochthony." There can be no doubt that the religious traditions of the Greeks were modified by symbiosis with the autochthonous inhabitants, in Crete as well as elsewhere in the Aegean zone. Nilsson had pointed out that, of the four religious centers of classical Greece-Delphi, Delos, Eleusis, and Olympia-the first three were inherited from the Mycenaeans. The persistence of certain Minoan religious structures has been aptly brought out. It has been possible to show the prolongation of the Minoan-Mycenaean chapel in the Greek sanctuary and the continuity between the Cretan cult of the hearth and that of the Mycenaean palaces. The image of the psyche-butterfly was familiar to the Minoans. The origins of the cult of Demeter are documented in Crete, and the oldest sanctuary at Eleusis dates from Mycenaean times. "Certain architectural and other dispositions of the mystery temples of classical times appear to derive, more or less, from installations recorded in pre-Hellenic Crete." 60 As in pre-Aryan India, it is above all the cults of the Goddesses, and the rites and beliefs related to fertility, death, and the soul's survival, which persisted. In certain cases the continuity is found from prehistory down to modern times. To cite only one example, the cave of Skoteino, "one of the most grandiose and picturesque in all Crete," is 60 meters deep and has four levels; at the end of the second level are two" cult idols, set up above, and in front of, a stone altar" -a woman and "a beardless bust with a sardonic smile." In front of these two statues "the fragments of vessels reach a height of several meters; others litter the floor of the third underground level.
59. Picard, p. 73. 60. Ibid., p. 142.



138 MEGALITHS, TEMPLES, CEREMONIAL CENTERS
... Chronologically, they follow one another without a break from the beginning of the second millennium B.C. to the end of the Roman period."61 The sanctity of the cave has persisted down to our day. Very near by is a small white chapel dedicated to the Parasceve (Good Friday). On July 26 there is an assemblage at the entrance to the cave. It consists of "the entire population of the valley of the Aposelemi and of the Chersonese region; there is dancing in two areas under the vault and heavy drinking, and love songs are sung as ritually as mass was heard in the near-by chapel." 62 Continuity is also demonstrated in respect to other specific expressions of archaic Cretan religiosity. Sir Arthur Evans emphasized the solidarity between the tree cult and the veneration of sacred stones. A similar solidarity is found in the cult of Athena Parthenos at Athens: a pillar associated with the sacred tree (the olive) and with the owl, the goddess's emblematic bird. Evans also showed the survival of the pillar cult down to modern times; for example, the sacred pillar at Tekekioi, near Skoplje, a replica of the Minoan column, venerated by both Christians and Muslims. The belief that sacred springs are associated with goddesses is found again in classical Greece, where springs were worshiped as Nereids; it persists in our day: fairies are still called Neraides. There is no need to multiply examples. It should be remembered that a similar process of continuity of archaic religious structures is characteristic of all folk cultures, from western Europe and the Mediterranean to the plain of the Ganges and China (cf. §14). For our purpose, it is important to emphasize the fact that this religious complex, linking goddesses of fertility and death with rites and beliefs concerning initiation and the survival of the soul, was not incorporated into the Homeric religion. Despite symbiosis with the countless pre-Hellenic traditions, the Aryan-speaking conquerors succeeded in imposing their pantheon and in maintaining their specific religious style (see chapters 10-11).

6 The Religions
of The Hittites and The Canaanites
43. Anatolian symbiosis and Hittite syncretism
The surprising religious continuity that existed in Anatolia, from the seventh millennium to the introduction of Christianity, has been remarked upon. "Indeed, there is no solution of continuity between the shapeless statuettes of a masculine divinity standing on a bull, like the ones found at <;atal Hiiyiik on level VI (ca. 6000 B.C.), the representations of the storm god from the Hittite period, and the statues of Jupiter Dolichenus, worshiped by the soldiers of the Roman legions; nor between the goddess with leopards from <;atal Hiiyiik, the Hittite goddess Hebat, and the Cybele of the classical period."! At least in part, this continuity is the consequence of an astonishing vocation for religious syncretism. The Indo-European ethnic group that modern historiography designates by the name Hittites dominated Anatolia during the second millennium (the Old Kingdom, ca. 1740-1460 B.C., and the Empire, ca. 1460-1200 B.C.). By subjugating the Hattians-the earliest Anatolian population whose language is known-the Aryan-speaking invaders began a process of cultural symbiosis that continued long after the collapse of their political creations. Soon after entering Anatolia, the Hittites underwent Babylonian influences. Later, and especially during the Empire, they assimilated the essentials of the culture of the Hurrians, a nonIndo-European population inhabiting the northern regions of Mesopotamia and Syria. Hence, in the Hittite pantheon, divinities of Sumero-Akkadian stock stood side by side with Anatolian and
1. Maurice Vieyra, "La religion de I'AnatoIie antique," in Histoire des religions, vol. 1, p. 258.



140 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
Hurrian divinities. The greater part of the Hittite myths and rituals so far known have parallels, and even models, in the Hattian or Hurrian religious traditions. The Indo-European heritage proves to be the least significant. Nevertheless, despite the heterogeneity of their sources, the creations of the Hittite genius-first of all, its religious art-do not lack originality. The divinities were distinguished by the terrifying and luminous force that emanated from them (cf. "the divine splendor," melammu, § 20). The pantheon was very large, but of certain gods nothing is known except their names. Each important town was the principal residence of a deity, who was, however, surrounded by other divine personages. As everywhere in the ancient Near East, the divinities "lived in" the temples; the priests and their acolytes had the duty of bathing, dressing, and feeding them and entertaining them with dances and music. From time to time the gods left their temples and went traveling; sometimes these absences could be used to explain failures in the answering of requests. The pantheon was conceived as a large family, having as its head the first couple, the patrons of the Hittite country: the storm god and a Great Goddess. The storm god was known principally by his Hurrian name, Teshub, the name that we shall adopt. His wife was named, in the Hurrian language, Hebat. Their sacred animals-the bull and, for Hebat, the lion (or the panther)-confirm the continuity from prehistory (cf. §13). The most famous Great Goddess was known by the name "sun" goddess of Arinna (in the Hattian language,· Wurusema). In fact, she was an epiphany of the same Mother Goddess,2 since she is praised as "queen of the land, queen of Earth and Heaven, protectress of the kings and queens of the Hatti land," etc. Probably the "solarization" represents an act of homage, performed when the goddess of Arinna became the patroness ofthe Hittite kingdom. The Babylonian ideogram "Ishtar" was us~d to designate the numerous local goddesses, whose Anatolian names are unknown. The Hurrian name was Shanshka. But it must be borne in mind that
2. In a beautiful prayer, Queen Pudu-hepas identifies the goddess of Arinna
with Hebat (see the translation by A. Goetze, ANET, p. 393). However, this is the only document that points in this direction. In the rituals and lists of offerings the names of the two goddesses are given one after the other. This fact may be explained by the importance obtained, under the Hittite sovereigns, by the two famous epiphanies of the Mother Goddess.



Anatolian symbiosis and Hittite syncretism 141
the Babylonian Ishtar, goddess of love and war, was known in Anatolia; hence in certain cases we have an Anatolian-Babylonian syncretism. The sun god, son of Teshub, was considered, like Shamash, the defender of right and justice. No less popular was Telepinus, also a son of Teshub, whose myth we shall soon consider. As for religious life, the sources inform us only about the official cult. The prayers whose texts have been preserved belong to the royal milieu. In other words, we know nothing of the beliefs and rituals of the people. However, there can be no doubt of the roles attributed to the goddesses of fecundity and the god of storms. The seasonal festivals, especially the New Year festival (purulli), were celebrated by the king, representative of the Aryan-speaking conquerors; but similar ceremonies had been performed in the country from Neolithic times. Black magic was forbidden by the law code; those guilty of it were executed. This indirectly confirms the extraordinary repute that certain archaic practices enjoyed in popular circles. On the other hand, the considerable number of texts so far discovered proves that white magic was openly and frequently practiced; it chiefly involved rituals of purification and the banishment of evil. The prestige and the religious role of the king are considerable. Sovereignty is a gift of the gods. "To me, the King, have the godsSun God and Storm God-entrusted the land and my house.... (The gods) have taken care of the kings. They have renewed his strength and set no limit to his years." 3 The king is "loved" by a great god. (However, fictitious divine descent, of the Mesopotamian type, is not documented.) His prosperity is identified with that of the whole people. The sovereign is the vicar of the gods on earth, but he also represents the people before the pantheon. No text describing the ceremonial of the king's consecration has been found, but it is known that the sovereign was anointed with oil, clothed in a special dress, and crowned; finally, he received a royal name. The sovereign was also a high priest, and, alone or with the queen, he celebrated the most important festivals of the year. After their death the kings were deified. In speaking of the death of a king, the phrase "he has become a god" was used. His statue was placed in the temple, and the reigning sovereigns brought him offerings.

According to certain texts, the king, during his lifetime, was considered to be the incarnation of his deified ancestors. 4
44. The" god who disappears"
The originality of "Hittite" 5 religious thought is seen especially in the reinterpretation of some important myths. One of the most notable themes is that of the "god who disappears." In the bestknown version, the protagonist is Telepinus. Other texts give the role to his father, the storm god, to the sun god, or to certain goddesses. The background, like the name Telepinus, is Hattian. The Hittite versions were composed in connection with various rituals; in other words, the recitation of the myth played a fundamental part inthe cult. Since the beginning of the narrative 6 is lost, we do not know why Telepinus decides to "disappear." Perhaps it is because men have angered him. But the consequences of his disappearance immediately make themselves felt. Fires go out on hearths, gods and men feel "stifled"; the ewe neglects her lamb, the cow her calf; "grain and spelt thrive no longer"; animals and men do not copulate; the pastures dry up, the springs fail. (This is, perhaps, the earliest literary version of the well-known mythological motif of the "waste land," made famous by the Grail romances.) Then the sun god sends messengers-first the eagle, then the storm god himself-to look for Telepinus, but without success. Finally, the Mother Goddess sends the bee; it finds the god asleep in a grove, and, by stinging him, wakes him. Furious, Te1epinus brings down such calamities on the land that the gods take fright and, to calm him, have recourse to magic. By magical ceremonies and formulas, Telepinus is purged of his anger and of "evil." 7 Pacified, he finally returns to his place among the gods-and life resumes its rhythms.
4. O. R. Gurney, "Hittite Kingship," p. 115. 5. We have added the quotation marks to indicate that, in many cases, the myths are originally Hattian or Hurrian, translated or adapted into the Hittite language. 6. We use the translations by A. Goetze, ANET, pp. 126-28, by Giiterbock, Mythologies of the Ancient World, pp. 144 fr., and by Vieyra in R. Labat, ed., Les religions du Proche-Orient, pp. 532 fr. See also Theodor Gaster, Thespis,
pp.302-9. 7. Similar pacification rites are performed by the priest; see the text translated by Gaster, Thespis, pp. 311-12.



Conquering the Dragon 143
Telepinus is a god who, angered, hides-that is to say, disappears from the world around him. He does not belong to the category of vegetation gods, who die and return to life periodically. Nevertheless, his disappearance has the same disastrous consequences on all levels of cosmic life. Furthermore, "disappearance" and "epiphany" signify both descent to the underworld and return to earth (cf. Dionysus, §122). But what distinguishes Telepinus from the vegetation gods is the fact that his discovery and reanimation by the bee make the situation worse; it is purgation rituals that succeed in pacifying him. The specific characteristic of Telepinus is his demonic rage, which threatened to ruin the entire country. What we have here is the capricious and irrational fury of a fertility god against his own creation, life in all its forms. Similar conceptions of divine ambivalence are found elsewhere; they will be elaborated especially in Hinduism (cf. Siva, Kali). The fact that the role of Telepinus was also given to the gods of the storm and the sun and to certain goddessesthat is, in general, to divinities governing various sectors of cosmic life-proves that the myth refers to a more complex drama than that of vegetation; in fact, it illustrates the incomprehensible mystery of the destruction of the Creation by its own creators.
45. Conquering the Dragon
On the occasion of the New Year festival, purulli, the myth of the battle between the storm god and the dragon (illuyankas)8 was ritually recited. In a first encounter, the storm god is vanquished and begs for the help of the other divinities. The goddess Inaras makes ready a banquet and invites the Dragon. Before this, she had asked the help of a mortal, Hupasiyas. He accepted, on condition that she would sleep with him; the goddess consented. The Dragon eats and drinks so voraciously that he cannot descend to his lair again, and Hupasiyas binds him with a rope. Enter the storm god, who kills the Dragon without a fight. This version of the myth ends with an incident well known in fairy tales: Hupasiyas comes to live in Inaras' house but does not heed the goddess's warning not to look out the window
8. IIluyankas, literally "dragon," "serpent," is also a proper name.



144 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
during her absence. He sees his wife and children and begs Inaras to let him go home. The rest of the text is lost, but Hupasiyas is presumably killed. The second version gives this detail: the Dragon conquers the storm god and takes his heart and eyes. Then the storm god marries the daughter of a poor man and has a son by her. When he grows up, the son decides to marry the Dragon's daughter. Instructed by his father, the young man has no sooner entered his wife's house than he asks for the storm god's heart and eyes; he obtains them and gives them to his father. In possession of his "forces," the storm god again meets the Dragon, "near the sea," and succeeds in vanquishing him. But, by marrying his daughter, the son has obliged himself to be loyal to the Dragon, and he asks his father not to spare him. "So the storm god killed the Dragon and his own son toO."9 The fight between a god and a dragon is a well-known mythicoritual theme. A first defeat of the god and his mutilation have their parallels in the fight between Zeus and the giant Typhon. The latter succeeded in cutting the tendons out of Zeus's hands and feet, took him on his shoulders, and carried him to a cave in Cilicia. Typhon hid the tendons in the pelt of a bear, but Hermes and Aegipan finally managed to steal them. Zeus recovered his power and overthrew the giant.10 The motif of the theft of a vital organ is well known. But in the Hittite version the Dragon is no longer the terrifying monster that appears in a number of cosmogonic myths or myths of combats for the sovereignty of the world (cf. Tiamat, Leviathan, Typhon, etc.). Illuyankas already represents certain characteristics of the dragons of folktales, for he lacks intelligence and is a glutton.11 The storm god, vanquished a first time (theme documented elsewhere), ends by triumphing not by virtue of his own heroism but with the help of a human being (Hupasiyas or the storm god's son by a mortal woman). It is true that, in both versions, this human personage has previously been equipped with a force of divine origin: he is the lover of the goddess Inaras or the son of the storm god. In both cases, though for different reasons, the helper is done away with by the very author of his quasi-divinization. After sleeping

Kumarbi and sovereignty 145
with Inaras, Hupasiyas no longer has the right to rejoin his familythat is, human society-for, having shared in the divine condition, he could transmit it to other human beings. Despite this partial folklorization, the myth of Illuyankas played a central role: it was ritually recited in the setting of the New Year festival. Certain texts show the existence of a ritual combat between two opposing groups,12 comparable to the Babylonian akitu ceremony. The cosmogonic meaning of the myth, evident in the struggle between Marduk and Tiamat, is replaced by the competition for the sovereignty of the world (cf. Zeus-Typhon). The god's victory insures the stability and prosperity of the country. We may presume that, before its folklorization, the myth presented the reign of the Dragon as a "chaotic" period, endangering the very sources of life (the Dragon symbolizes not only "virtuality" (potentiality) and darkness, but also drought, the suspension of norms, and death).
46. Kumarbi and sovereignty
Exceptional interest attaches to what has been called the HurritoHittite "theogony,"13 that is, the sequence of mythical events whose protagonist is Kumarbi, the father of the gods. The initial episode, "Kingship in Heaven," explains the succession of the first gods. In the beginning, Alalu was king, and Anu, the most important of the gods, bowed before him and served him. But after nine years Anu attacked and vanquished him. Then Alalu took refuge in the subterranean world, and Kumarbi became the new sovereign's servant. Nine years passed, and Kumarbi in his turn attacked Anu. The latter fled, flying into the sky, but Kumarbi pursued him, caught him by the feet, and threw him to the ground, after biting his "loins."14 Since he was laughing and rejoicing over his exploit, Anu told him that he had been impregnated. Kumarbi spat out what was still in his mouth,

267 if. See also O. R. Gurney, The Hittites, p. 155. Another text refers to the "fixing of the destinies" by the assembly of the gods (see Gurney, The Hittites,

and North Syrian traditions. 14. The first translators proposed "knees." The two terms are euphemisms
for the male genital organ.



146 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
but a part of Anu's virility entered his body, and he became big with three gods. The rest of the text is badly mutilated, but it is presumed that Anu's "children," with Teshub, the storm god leading them, make war on Kumarbi and dethrone him. The following episode, the "Song of Ullikummi," relates the effort made by Kumarbi to recover the royalty that Teshub had taken from him. In order to create a rival able to conquer Teshub, he impregnated a rock with his semen. The product of this union was Ullikummi, an anthropomorphic being made of stone. Placed on the shoulder of the giant Ubelluri, who, with half his body emerging from the sea, supports heaven and earth (this is the Hurrian analogue of Atlas), Ullikummi grew so fast that he reached the sky. Teshub went to the seaside and attacked the diorite giant but was vanquished. The text presents considerable lacunae, but the sequence of events can be reconstructed. Ullikummi threatens to destroy all mankind, and the gods, in alarm, assemble and decide to appeal to Ea. The latter at once goes to Ellil and then to Ubelluri and asks them if they have learned that a stone giant has resolved to overthrow Teshub. Ellil's answer is lost. As for Ubelluri, he reports a detail of great importance. "When they built heaven and earth upon me, I did not know anything. When they came and separated the heaven from the earth with a cleaver, I did not know that either. Now my right shoulder is a little sore. But I do not know who that god is." Ea then asks the" olden gods" to "open the ancient storehouses of the fathers and forefathers" and to bring the old knife with which they had separated heaven from earth. Ullikummi's feet are sawed, thus crippling him, but the diorite man still boasts that the celestial kingship was assigned to him by his father, Kumarbi. Finally, he is overthrown by Teshub.. This myth is remarkable in several respects. First, it contains certain archaic elements: Kumarbi's self-fecundation by swallowing the sexual organ of the god whom he has dethroned; the sexual union of a divine being with a mass of rock, resulting in the birth of an anthropomorphic mineral monster; the relations between this diorite giant and the Hurrian Atlas, Ubelluri. The first episode can be interpreted as an allusion to the bisexuality of Kumarbi, a characteristic of primordial divinities (cf., for example, Tiamat, Zurvan). In this case, Teshub, who irrevocably obtains the sovereignty, is the son of a celestial god (Anu) by an androgynous

divinity.15 As for the fecundation of a rock by a superhuman being, a similar myth is found in Phrygia: Papas (= Zeus) fertilizes a stone named Agdos, and it engenders a hermaphroditic monster, Agditis; but the gods castrate Agditis, thus transforming him into the goddess Cybele (Pausanias 7. 17. 10--12). Much more widespread are the myths that recount the birth of men from stones; these are found in Asia Minor, in the Far East, and in Polynesia. Probably what is involved is the mythical theme of the autochthony of the first men; they are engendered by a chthonian Great Goddess. Certain gods (Mithra, for example) are also imagined as emerging from a rock, like the sun, whose light shines out every morning above the mountains. But this mythical theme cannot be reduced to a solar epiphany.16 It could be said that the petra genetrix reinforces the sacrality of Mother Earth with the prodigious virtues with which stones were held to be imbued. As we have seen (§ 34), the sacredness of massive rock was nowhere more exalted than in the megalithic religions. It is not by chance that Ullikummi is set on the shoulder of the giant who holds up the heavens; the "diorite man" is himself also preparing to become a columna universalis. However, this motif, specifically characteristic of the megalithic religions, is integrated into a larger context: the struggle for succession to the divine sovereignty.
47. Conflicts between divine generations
From the first translation of the Hurrian/Hittite text, analogies were noted between it and the Phoenician theogony, as presented by Philo of Byblos, and, on the other hand, between it and the tradition transmitted by Hesiod. According to Philo,17 the first sovereign god
15. According to certain mythological fragments, it seems that the gods who were "inside" Kumarbi discussed with him through what apertures of his body they were to emerge (GUterbock, Mythologies of the Ancient World, pp. 157-58). 16. In fact, Mithra's first combat, when he had only just emerged from the rock, is with the Sun. Victorious, he takes away the Sun's radiant crown. But soon afterward the two gods pledge friendship by shaking hands. 17. Some fragments of his Phoenician History have been preserved by Eusebius and Porphyry. Philo states that he summarizes the writings of Sanchoniaton, a Phoenician scholar who was supposed to have lived "before the Trojan War." See Clemen, Die phOnikische Religion, p. 28.



148 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
was Elioun (in Greek, Hypsistos, "The Most High "), corresponding in the Hurrian/Hittite mythology to Alalu. From his union with Bruth there came into the world Uranus (corresponding to Anu) and Ge (Gaea). In their turn, these two engendered four sons, the first of whom, EI (or Kronos), corresponds to Kumarbi. As the result of a quarrel with his wife, Uranus tries to destroy his progeny, but EI forges a saw (or lance?) for himself, drives out his father, and becomes the sovereign.is Finally, Baal (representing the fourth generation and corresponding to Teshub and Zeus) obtains the sovereignty; exceptionally, he obtains it without a combat. Until the discovery of Ugaritic literature there was doubt concerning the genuineness of this tradition transmitted by Philo. But the succession of divine generations is documented in Canaanite mythology (see § 49). The fact that Hesiod (§ 83) mentions only three generations-represented by Uranus, Kronos, and Zeus-reconfirms the genuineness of the Philo (" Sanchoniaton") version, for the latter mentions, before Uranus (= Anu), the reign of Elioun (= Alalu). It is probable that the Phoenician version of the myth of divine sovereignty derives from, or was strongly influenced by, the Hurrian myth. We may presume that Hesiod made use of the same tradition, known in Greece either through the Phoenicians or directly from the Hittites. It is important to emphasize at once the "specialized" and at the same time syncretistic character of this myth, and not only in its Hurrian/Hittite version (in which, besides, there are a number of Sumero-Akkadian elements).19 The Enuma elish likewise presents (1) a series of divine generations, (2) the battle of the young gods against the old gods, and (3) the victory of Marduk, who thus assumes the sovereignty. But in the Mesopotamian myth the victorious combat ends with a cosmogony, more precisely with the creation of the universe as men will know it. This myth takes its place in the series of cosmogonies that involve a combat between a god and the Dragon, followed by the dismemberment of the con
18. It is not until thirty-two years later that EI succeeds in castrating Uranus. The two acts, castration of the father and conquest of the sovereignty, which go together in the Hurrian/Hittite and Greek myths, are here separated. 19. Cf. the names of the divinities Anu, Ishtar, and perhaps Alalu; a god Alala appears in a Babylonian list as one of the ancestors of Anu (Giiterbock, Mythologies o/the Ancient World, p. 160).

quered foe. In Hesiod's Theogony the cosmogonic act-i.e., the separation of Heaven (Uranus) from Earth (Gaea) by the castration of Uranus-takes place at the beginning of the drama and in fact precipitates the struggle for sovereignty. The same situation obtains in the HurrianjHittite myth: the cosmogony-that is, the separation of Heaven and Earth-took place long before, during the period of the" olden gods." To sum up, all the myths that recount the conflicts between successive generations of gods for the conquest of universal sovereignty justify, on the one hand, the exalted position of the last conquering god and, on the other hand, explain the present structure of the world and the actual condition of humanity.
48. A Canaanite pantheon: Ugarit
Shortly before 3000 B.C. a new civilization, that of the Early Bronze Age, appears in Palestine: it marks the first establishment of the Semites. Following the usage ofthe Bible, we may call them" Canaanites," but the name is merely conventional.20 The invaders become sedentary, practice agriculture, and develop an urban civilization. During the next several centuries, other immigrants filter into the region, and exchanges with the neighboring countries, especially with Egypt, increase. About 2200 B.C. the Early Bronze civilization is ruined by the irruption of a new Semitic population, the Amorites, seminomadic warriors, occasional agriculturalists, but principally herders. The end of this civilization, however, constitutes the beginning of a new era. The invasion of Syria and Palestine by the Amorites (MAR.TU in Sumerian, Amurru in Akkadian) is only an episode in a much larger movement, documented, at about the same period, in Mesopotamia and Egypt. There is a constant series of attacks by impetuous and "savage" nomads,21 hurrying on, wave after wave, from the Syrian desert, at once fascinated and exasperated
20. Canaan is not mentioned in the texts before the middle of the second millennium; see R. de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, vol. 1, p. 58. 21. In the Mesopotamian literary texts of the end of the third millennium, the MAR.TV are designated as "mountain rustics," "who do not know wheat," "who know neither house not city" (texts cited by de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, p. 64).



150 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
by the opulence of the cities and the cultivated fields. But, in the course of conquering them, they adopt the life style of the aborigines and become civilized. After a certain length of time their descendants will be obliged to defend themselves against the armed incursions of other barbarians leading a nomadic life on the outskirts of the cultivated areas. The process will be repeated during the last centuries of the second millennium, when the Israelites will begin to enter Canaan. The tension and the symbiosis between the cults of agrarian fertility that flourished on the Syro-Palestinian coast and the religious ideology of the nomadic pastoralists, which was dominated by celestial and astral divinities, will reach a new intensity with the settling of the Hebrews in Canaan. It could be said that this tension, which often finally led to symbiosis, will be raised to the rank of a paradigmatic model, for it is here, in Palestine, that a new type of religious experience came into conflict with the old and venerable traditions of cosmic religiosity. Until 1929 the available data concerning the Syro-Canaanite religion came from the Old Testament, Phoenician inscriptions, and certain Greek authors-especially Philo of Byblos (first/second centuries A.D.) but also Lucian of Samosata (second century A.D.) and Nonnus of Panopolis (fifth century). However, the Old Testament reflects the polemic against paganism, and the other sources are either late or too fragmentary. Since 1929 a large number of mythological texts have been brought to light by the excavations at Ras Shamra, the ancient Ugarit, a port city on the northern coast of Syria. They are texts composed in the fourteenth to twelfth centuries but containing mythico-religious conceptions that are earlier. The documents so far deciphered and translated still do not suffice to give us a comprehensive view of Ugaritic religion and mythology. Unfortunately lacunae interrupt the narratives; the beginnings and ends of columns having been broken, there is not even general agreement concerning the order of the mythological episodes. Despite this fragmentary condition, the Ugaritic literature is of inestimable value. But the fact must be borne in mind that the religion of Ugarit was never that ofall Canaan.
The interest of the Ugaritic documents lies above all in the fact that they illustrate the phases of the passage from one religious ideology to another. EI is the head of the pantheon. His name means



A Canaanite pantheon: Ugarit 151
"god" in Semitic, but among the West Semites he is a personal god. He is called "Powerful," "Bull," "Father of Gods and Men,"22 "King," "Father of the Years." He is "holy," "merciful," "very wise." On a stela ofthe fourteenth century he is represented enthroned, majestic, bearded, clad in a long robe, and wearing a tiara crowned by horns.23 Up to the present, no cosmogonic text has been found. 24 However, the creation of the stars by hierogamy can be interpreted as reflecting Canaanite cosmogonic conceptions. And indeed text number 52 (" The birth of the gracious and beautiful gods") describes EI impregnating his two wives, Asherah and Anath, with the Morning Star and the Evening Star.25 Asherah, herself" engendered by EI," is named "Mother of the Gods" (text number 51); she bore seventy divine sons. Except for Baal, all the gods descend from the first couple, EI-Asherah. Yet, despite the epithets that present him as a powerful god, true "Lord of the Earth," despite the fact that in the sacrificial lists his name is always mentioned first, EI appears in the myths as physically weak, indecisive, senile, resigned. Certain gods treat him with scorn. Finally, his two wives, Asherah and Anath, are taken from him by Baal. We must conclude that the laudatory epithets reflect an earlier situation, when EI was in fact the head of the pantheon. The replacement of an old creator and cosmocrator god by a more dynamic young god, "specialized" in cosmic fertility, is a rather frequent phenomenon. Often the creator becomes a deus otiosus and withdraws farther and farther from his creation. Sometimes his replacement is the result of a conflict between divine generations or between their representatives. Insofar as it is possible to reconstruct the essential themes of Ugaritic mythology, we may say that the texts show us the advancement of Baal to the supreme rank. But it is an
22. The title ab, "father," is one of the most frequent epithets; cf. also ab adm, "father of humanity" (see M. H. Pope, el in the Ugaritic Texts, pp. 47 if.). 23. F. A. Schaeifer, The Cuneiform Texts of Ras Shamra-Ugarit, pI. XXXI, pp. 60, 62. 24. In the West Semitic inscriptions, however, EI is called "Creator of the Earth"; see Pope, WdM, vol. 1, p. 280. 25. This myth is the model for a ritual performed at the beginning of a new cycle of seven years, which proves that at an early date EI was still regarded as the author of the fertility of the earth, an eminence that will later fall to Baal. See Cyrus H. Gordon, "Canaanite Mythology," pp. 185 if.; U1f Oldenburg, The Conflict between El and Baal in Canaanite Religion, pp. 19 if.; and Cross, Canaanite Myth, pp. 21 if.



152 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
advancement obtained by force and cleverness, and it does not lack a certain ambiguity. Baal is the only god who, while reckoned among the sons of E1 (since the latter was the father of all the gods), is called "Son of Dagan." This god, whose name signifies" grain," was venerated in the third millennium in the Upper and Middle Euphrates regions. 26 However, Dagan plays no part in the mythological texts from Ugarit, where Baal is the chief protagonist. The common noun baal (" master ") became his personal name. He also has a proper name, Haddu, that is, Hadad. He is called "Rider of the Clouds," "Prince, Master of the Earth." One of his epithets is Aliyan, the "Powerful," the "Sovereign." He is the source and principle of fertility but is also a warrior, as his sister and wife Anath is at once the goddess of love and war. Beside them, the most important mythological personages are Yam, "Prince Sea, River Regent," and Mot, "Death," who challenge the young god for the supreme power. In fact, a great part of Ugaritic mythology is devoted to the conflict between E1 and Baal and to Baal's combats with Yam and Mot to impose and maintain his sovereignty.
49. Baal captures the sovereignty and triumphs over the Dragon
According to a badly mutilated text,27 Baal and his confederates attack E1 by surprise in his palace on Mount Sapan and succeed in tying him up and wounding him. Apparently "something" falls to the ground, which can be interpreted as the castration of the father of the gods. The hypothesis is plausible, not only because, in similar conflicts for the sovereignty, Uranus and the Hurrian/Hittite god
26. The name Anath is also documented in the same regions. It is possible that Baal son of Dagan was introduced by the Amorites; see, most recently,
Oldenburg, The Conflict between EI and Baal, pp. 151 if. In this case he must have been agglutinated with a local "Baal" = Hadad, for it is impossible to conceive of the old Canaanite religion without that famous Semitic god of the storm and hence of fertility. See also Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic,
pp. 112 if. 27. The reference is to tablet VI AB, first published by C. Virolleaud; see the translation by Oldenburg, The Conflict between EI and Baal, pp. 185-86. The text has been interpreted by Cassuto, Pope, and Oldenburg (p. 123) as referring to Baal's attack and El's fall from his throne.



Baal conquers the sovereignty 153
Anu are castrated, but also because, despite the hostility he shows to Baal, EI will never attempt to recover his supreme position, not even when he learns that Baal has been killed by Mot.28 For in the ancient East, such a mutilation excludes the victim of it from sovereignty. Besides, except for text number 56, in which EI proves his virility by engendering the planetary gods, the Ugaritic documents seem to make him impotent. This explains his submissive and hesitant attitude and also the fact that Baal carries off his wife. By usurping his throne on Mount Sapan, Baal forces EI to take refuge at the end of the world, "at the source of the Rivers, in the hollow of the Abysses," which will henceforth be his dwelling place.29 Ellaments and implores the help of his family. Yam is the first to hear him, and offers him a strong drink. EI blesses him, gives him a new name, and proclaims him his successor. He further promises to build a palace for him; but he also urges him to drive Baal from the throne. The text that describes the combat between Yam and Baal is interrupted by lacunae. Though Yam now appears to be the sovereign, EI is seen, with the majority of the gods, on a mountain that is obviously no longer Mount Sapan. Since Baal has insulted Yam, by declaring that he has presumptuously raised himself to his position and that he will be destroyed, Yam sends messengers and demands that Baal surrender. The gods are frightened, and Baal reprimands them: "Raise your heads, gods, from your knees, and I myself will frighten Yam's messengers!" 30 But EI receives the messengers and declares that Baal is their slave and will pay a tribute to Yam. And since it appears that Baal will prove to be threatening, EI adds that the messengers can easily subdue him. However, helped by Anath, Baal prepares to confront Yam. (According to another tablet, Yam drove Baal from his throne, and it was Anath who vanquished him.)31
28. He addresses Asherah: "Give one of thy sons, that I may make him king" (Cyrus Gordon, Ugaritic Manual, 49:1:16-18; Oldenburg, p. 112). 29. Since the mountain is a celestial symbol, for a sovereign god its loss is equivalent to his fall. 30. G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, p. 79.

154 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
The divine blacksmith, Koshar-wa-Hasis (" Adroit and Skillful "), brings him two magical cudgels, which have the ability to hurl themselves like arrows from the hands of the user. The first cudgel strikes Yam on the shoulder, but he does not fall. The second strikes his
"
forehead, and" Prince Sea" crashes to the ground. Baal finishes him off, and the goddess Athtart asks him to dismember and scatter his corpse.32 Yam is portrayed as at once god and demon. He is the son "loved by El," and, as a god, he receives sacrifices like the other members of the pantheon. On the other hand, he is an aquatic monster, a seven-headed dragon, "Prince Sea," principle and epiphany of the subterranean waters. The mythological meaning of the combat is manifold. On the one hand, on the plane of seasonal and agricultural imagery, Baal's victory signifies the triumph of rain over the sea and the subterranean waters; the rhythm of rain, representing the cosmic norm, replaces the chaotic and sterile immensity of the sea and catastrophic floods. Baal's victory marks the triumph of confidence in order and in the stability of the seasons. On the other hand, the battle with the aquatic Dragon illustrates the emergence of a young god as champion, and hence as new sovereign, of the pantheon. Finally, we can read in this episode the vengeance of the firstborn (Yam) against the usurper who has castrated and dethroned his father (El).33 Such combats are paradigmatic, that is, can be repeated indefinitely. It is for this reason that Yam, though "killed" by Baal, will reappear in the texts. Nor is he alone in enjoying a "circular existence." As we shall see, Baal and Mot have a similar mode of being.
50. The palace of Baal
In order to celebrate the victory over the Dragon, Anath gives a banquet in Baal's honor. Soon after, the goddess shuts the doors of the palace and, succumbing to homicidal fury, falls to killing the
victory of Yam over Baal, followed by his defeat (in this case, by Anath), which corresponds to a well-known mythological theme: the god's defeat by, and triumphant revenge over, an ophidian monster. 32. Gordon, Ugaritic Manual, § 68:28-31, trans. Caquot and Sznycer, in Labat, ed., Les religions du Proche-Orient, p. 389.

guards, the soldiers, the old; in the blood that rises to her knees she girdles herself with the heads and hands of her victims. The episode is significant.34 Parallels to it have been found in Egypt and especially in the mythology and iconography of the Indian goddess Durga.35 Carnage and cannibalism are characteristic features of archaic fertility goddesses. From this point of view, the myth of Anath can be classed among the elements common to the ancienf agricultural civilization that extended from the eastern Mediterranean to the plain of the Ganges. In another episode,- Anath threatens her own father, El: she will cover his hair and his beard with blood (text Cnt:V: Oldenburg, p. 26). When she found Baal's lifeless body, Anath began to lament, "eating his flesh without a knife and drinking his blood without a cup." 36 It is because Mher brutal and sanguinary behavior that Anath, like other goddesses of love and war, was given male attributes and hence was regarded as bisexual. After another lacuna the text shows Baal sending messengers bearing gifts to Anath. He informs her that war is hateful to him; so let her lay down her arms and make offerings for peace and the fecundity of the fields. He tells her that he is about to create thunder and lightning so that gods and men may know that rain is coming. Anath assures him that she will follow his advice. However, although he is sovereign, Baal has neither a palace nor a chapel, whereas the other gods have them. In other words, Baal does not own a temple sufficiently grandiose to proclaim his sovereignty. A series of episodes relates the building of the palace. Contradictions are not lacking. Indeed, though he has dethroned El, Baal needs his authorization; he sends Asherah to plead his cause, and the mother of the gods lauds the fact that henceforth Baal "will give abundance of rain" and will "send forth his voice in the clouds." El consents, and Baal instructs Koshar-wa-Hasis to build him the
34. Blood being regarded as the essence of life, it has been proposed to see in this slaughter a rite whose purpose was passage from the sterility of the
Syrian late summer to the fertility of the new season; see Gray, The Legacy 0/ Canaan, p. 36. The text is translated by Caquot and Sznycer in Les religions du Proche-Orient, pp. 393-94.
35. As it has been transmitted to us, the Egyptian myth no longer presents the primitive stage; see above, § 26. The comparison with Durgii, which Marvin Pope has emphasized (see, most recently, WdM, vol. 1, p. 239), had
already been made by Walter Dostal, "Ein Beitrag," pp. 74 if. 36. Text published by Virolleaud, "Un nouvel episode du mythe ugaritique

palace. At first Baal refuses to have his dwelling fitted with windows, for fear that Yam may enter it. But he finally agrees.37 The building of a temple-palace after the god's victory over the Dragon proclaims his advancement to the supreme rank. The gods build the temple-palace in honor of Marduk after the defeat of Tiamat and the creation of the world (cf. § 21). But the cosmogonic symbolism is also present in the myth of Baal. The temple-palace being an imago mundi, its building corresponds in a certain way to a cosmogony. In fact, by triumphing over the aquatic "chaos," by regulating the rhythm of the rains, Baal "forms" the world as it is today.3s
51. Baal confronts Mot: Death and return to life
When the palace is finished, Baal prepares to confront Mot, "Death." The latter is a highly interesting god. He is, of course, a son of EI and reigns over the subterranean world; but he represents the only known Near Eastern example ofa personification (which is also a deification) of Death. Baal sends him messengers to inform him that henceforth Baal alone is king of gods and men, "so that the gods may grow fat, and human beings, the multitudes on earth, may be filled with food" (Gordon, Ugaritic Manual, VII:50 2; Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, p. 101). Baal orders his messengers to travel to the two mountains that mark the limits of the world, to lift them up, and to descend under the earth. They will find Mot seated on his throne in the mud, in a region covered with ordure. But they must not approach him too closely, otherwise Mot will swallow them down his enormous throat. Nor must they forget, Baal adds, that Mot is responsible for the deaths caused by torrid heat. Mot sends back the messengers, bidding Baal come to him. For, he explains, Baal killed Yam; it is now his turn to descend to the
37. The windows might symbolize the opening in the clouds through which Baal sends rain. His temple at Ugarit was built with an opening in the roof, so that the rain fell on the god's face represented on a stela; see Schaeffer, Cuneiform Texts, p. 6, pI. XXXII, fig. 2. But the symbolism and function of roof apertures are more complex; see, among others, A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Symbolism ofthe Dome." 38. Loren R. Fisher uses the term "creation of the Baal type" and distinguishes it from "creation of the EI type"; see his "Creation at Ugarit," pp. 320 ff.



Baal confronts Mot: Death and return to life 157
underworld.39 This is enough to confound Baal. "Hail, Mot, son of El," he tells his messengers to say, "I am thy slave, thine forever." Exultant, Mot declares that, once he is in the underworld, Baal will lose his strength and be destroyed. He orders him to bring his sons and his suite of winds, clouds, and rain with him-and Baal consents. But before going down into the underworld, he couples with a heifer and conceives a son. Baal clothes the child in his own garment and entrusts him to E1. It would seem that, at the moment of extreme danger, Baal recovers his first form, that of the cosmic bull; at the same time, he makes sure that he will have a successor in case he does not return to earth. We do not know how Baal dies, whether he was vanquished in combat or simply succumbed to the terrifying presence of Mot. The interest of the Ugaritic myth lies in the fact that Baal, young god of the storm and fecundity and recently head of the pantheon, goes down to the underworld and perishes like Tammuz and the other vegetation gods. No other "Baal-Hadad" undergoes a like fate, neither the Adad revered in Mesopotamia nor the Hurrian Teshub. (However, at a late date, Marduk "disappeared" too, annually, "shut up in the mountain.") We divine in this descensus ad inferos the will to bestow manifold and complementary qualities on Baal; he is the champion, who triumphs over the aquatic "chaos" and hence is a cosmocratic, even cosmogonic, god; he is god of the storm and agrarian fertility (we must remember that he is the son of Dagan, " Grain "); but he is also the sovereign god, determined to extend his sovereignty over the entire world (hence also over the underworld). In any case, after this last undertaking the relations between El and Baal change. In addition, the structure and rhythms of the universe receive their present form. When the text resumes after another lacuna, two messengers are reporting to El that they have found Baal's corpse. El sits down on the ground, tears his garments, beats his breast, and gashes his face; in short, he proclaims the ritual mourning that was practiced at Ugarit. "Baal is dead!" he cries. "What will become of the multitudes of men ?"40 Suddenly, El seems to be freed from his resentment and his desire for revenge.

158 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
He behaves like a true cosmocrator god; he realizes that universal life is endangered by Baal's death. EI asks his wife to name one of his sons king in Baal's stead. Asherah chooses Athar, "the Terrible," but when he seats himself on the throne he discovers that he is not big enough to occupy it and admits that he cannot be king. In the meanwhile, Anath goes to search for the corpse. When she finds it, she lifts it on her shoulder and sets out northward. Having buried it, she sacrifices a large number of cattle for the funerary banquet. After a certain time Anath meets with Mot. She seizes him, and "with a blade she cuts him; with the winnowing basket she winnows him; with fire she roasts him; with the mill she crushes him; in the fields she sows him, and the birds eat him." 41 Anath performs a sort of ritual murder, treating Mot like an ear of grain. In general, this kind of death is specifically characteristic of vegetation gods and spirits.42 We may wonder if it is not precisely because of this type of agrarian death that Mot will later return to·life. However this may be, the killing of Mot is not without connections with the destiny of Baal. El dreams that Baal is alive and that "fat rained down from heaven, and honey ran in the wadies" (which recalls biblical images; cf. Ezekiel 32:14; Job 20:17). He bursts out laughing and declares that he will sit down and rest, for "the victorious Baal is alive, the Prince of the Earth exists" (Driver, p. 113). But, just as Yam returns to life, Mot reappears after seven years and complains of the treatment he has received from Anath. He also complains of Baal's having robbed him of the sovereignty, and the two adversaries begin the combat again. They confront each other, striking with their heads and feet like wild oxen, bite each other like snakes, until they both crash to the ground, Baal on top of Mot. But Shapash, the goddess of the sun, gives Mot a warning from El that it is useless to continue the battle, and Mot surrenders, recognizing Baal's sovereignty.

52. Canaanite religious vision
Certain authors claim to have seen in this myth a reflection of the annual death and reappearance of vegetation. But in Syria and Palestine summer does not bring the" death" of vegetable life: on the contrary, it is the season of fruits. It is not torrid heat that frightens the farmer but a prolonged drought. So it seems plausible that Mot's victory refers to the cycle of seven dry years, of which there are echoes in the Old Testament (Genesis 41; 2 Samuel 24:12 ff.).44 But the interest of the myth goes beyond its possible connections with the rhythm of vegetation. In fact, these touching and sometimes spectacular events reveal to us a specific mode of divine existence, particularly a mode of being that includes defeat and "death," "disappearance" by burial (Baal) or by dismemberment (Mot), followed by more or less periodical "reappearances." This type of existence, at once intermittent and circular, recalls the modality of the gods who govern the cycle of vegetation. However, this is a new religious creation, which aims at integrating certain negative aspects of life into a unified system of antagonistic rhythms. In the last analysis, Baal's combats, with his defeats and his victories, insure him the sovereignty of heaven and earth; but Yam continues to reign over the sea and Mot remains lord over the subterranean world of the dead. The myths bring out the primacy of Baal and hence the perenniality of life and the norms that rule the cosmos and human society. By this very fact the negative aspects represented by Yam and Mot find their justification. The fact that Mot is a son of EI, and, above all, that Baal is unable to destroy him, proclaims the normality of death. In the last analysis, death proves to be the condition sine qua non of life.45 It is probable that the myth that relates the combat between Baal and Yam was recited during the New Year festival and the myth of the Baal-Mot conflict at the harvest season; but no text so far known mentions these facts. So, too, we may suppose that the king-of

But obviously, from the post-Upanishadic Indian point of view, the cycle life-sexuality-death-return-to-life is the greatest obstacle on the path to deliverance (see the second volume of the present work).



160 THE HITTITES AND THE CANAANITES
whom we know that he played an important part in the cultrepresented Baal in these mythico-ritual scenarios; but this is still the subject of controversy. The sacrifices were regarded as food offered to the gods. The sacrificial system appears to resemble that of the Old Testament: it included the holocaust, the sacrifice or offering of "peace" and "communion," and the expiatory sacrifice. The priests (khnm) had the same name as in Hebrew (kohen). With the priests, there is also mention of priestesses (khnt) and qadesim, "consecrated" persons. (In the Bible this term designates sacred prostitution, but the Ugaritic texts indicate nothing of the kind.) Finally, there is mention of the oracular priests or prophets. The temples were furnished with altars and decorated with images of the gods and divine symbols. Aside from the blood sacrifices, the cult included dances and many orgiastic acts and gestures, which later aroused the wrath of the prophets. But it must be remembered that the documentary lacunae allow us only an approximate supposition as to Canaanite religious life. We do not have a single prayer. We know that life is a divine gift, but we do not know the myth of the creation of man. Such a religious vision was not exclusively Canaanite. But its importance and significance were increased by the fact that the Israelites, when they entered Canaan, were confronted with this type of cosmic sacrality, which inspired a complex cult activity and which, despite its orgiastic excesses, was not without a certain grandeur. Since belief in the sacredness of life was also shared by the Israelites, a problem immediately arose: how would it be possible to preserve such a belief without accepting other elements of the Canaanite religious ideology, of which it was an integral part? This ideology implied, as we have just seen, a particular theology centered on the intermittent and circular modality of the chief god, Baal, symbol of the totality of life. Now Yahweh did not share in this mode of being. (Nor, indeed, did EI, but EI had undergone other humiliating changes.) In addition, though his cult involved a certain number of sacrifices, Yahweh did not allow himself to be constrained by cult acts: he demanded the inner transformation of his worshipers through obedience and trust (§ 114).



Canaanite religious vision 161
As we shall see (§ 60), many Canaanite religious elements were assimilated by the Israelites.
But these borrowings were themselves an aspect of the conflict:
Baal was combated with his own arms. If we consider that all the foreign groups, even such non-Semites as the Hurrians and later the Philistines, completely forgot their own religion very soon after they arrived in Canaan, we must consider it humanly extraordinary that this struggle between Yahweh and Baal continued for so long and that, despite certain compromises and many lapses into infidelity, it concluded with the victory of Yahwism.46

7 "When Israel
Was a Child..:'
53. The first two chapters of Genesis
The religion of Israel is supremely the religion of the Book. This scriptural corpus is made up of texts of different ages and orientations, representing, to be sure, oral traditions of considerable antiquity but reinterpreted, corrected, and redacted in the course of several centuries and in different milieus.1 Modern authors begin the history of the religion of Israel with Abraham. And in fact, according to the tradition, it is he who was chosen by God to become the ancestor of the people of Israel and to take possession of Canaan. But the first eleven chapters of Genesis recount the fabulous events that preceded Abraham's election, from the creation to the flood and the Tower of Babel. The redaction of these chapters is well known to be more recent than that of many other texts of the Pentateuch. Then, too, certain authors, and by no means the least respected, have maintained that cosmogony and origin myths (creation of man, origin of death, etc.) played a secondary part in the religious consciousness of Israel. In short, the Hebrews were more interested in "sacred history," that is, in their relations with God, than in the history of origins narrating the fabulous and mythical events of the primordium.
1. The problems raised by the sources and redaction of the Pentateuch, that is, the first five books of the law (torah) are considerable. For our purpose it is enough to say that the sources have been designated by the following terms: Yahwistic (because this source, which is the earliest-tenth or ninth centurycalls God Yahweh); Elohistic (a little later; it uses the name Elohim, "God"); Priestly (the latest; the work of the priests, it stresses the cult and the Law); and Deuteronomic (this source occurs almost exclusively in the Book of Deuteronomy). We add, however, that for contemporary Old Testament criticism, textual analysis is more complex and more subtle. Except where otherwise indicated, we quote from the Jerusalem Bible.



The first two chapters of Genesis 163
This may be true from a certain period on and, above all, for a certain religious elite. But there are no reasons for concluding that the ancestors of the Israelites were indifferent to the questions in which all archaic societies were intensely interested, notably the cosmogony, the creation of man, the origin of death, and certain other grandiose episodes. Even in our day, after 2,500 years of "reforms," the events reported in the first chapters of Genesis continue to feed the imagination and the religious thought of the heirs of Abraham. Hence, following the premodern tradition, we begin our exposition with the first chapters of Genesis. The late date of their redaction does not constitute a difficulty, for their content is archaic; in fact, it reflects conceptions much older than the saga of Abraham. Genesis opens with a famous passage: "In the beginning God (Elohim) created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered over the water" (1 : 1-2). The image of the primordial ocean, over which there hovers a creator god, is extremely archaic.2 However, the theme of the god flying over the watery abyss is not documented in the Mesopotamian cosmogony, though the myth narrated in the Enuma elish was probably familiar to the author of the biblical text. (And in fact the primordial ocean is called in Hebrew tehOm, a word etymologically closely connected with the Babylonian tiiimat). The creation properly speaking, that is, the organization of" chaos" (tohU WQ hOhU), is effected by the power of the word of God. He said: "Let there be light," and there was light (1 :3). The successive stages of the creation are all accomplished by the divine word. The aquatic chaos is not personified (cf. Tiamat) and hence is not "conquered" in a cosmogonic combat. This biblical account presents a specific structure: (1) creation by the Word; 3 (2) of a world that is "good"; and (3) of life (animal and vegetable) that is "good" and that God blesses (1: 10, 21, 31); (4) finally, the cosmogonic work is crowned by the creation of man. On
2. In a number of traditions the Creator is imagined in the form of a bird. But this is a "hardening" of the original symbol: the divine spirit transcends the aquatic mass, it is free to move; hence it "flies" like a bird. The bird is, of course, one of the archetypal images of the spirit. 3. We add that the creative word of the god is documented in other traditions, not only in Egyptian theology but also among the Polynesians. See
Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 31 if.



164 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
the sixth and last day, God says: "Let us make man in our own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle," etc. (1 :26). There is no spectacular exploit (combat of the Tiamat-Marduk type),4 no "pessimistic" element in the cosmogony or the anthropogony (the world formed from a "demonic" primordial being, Tiamat; man modeled from the blood of an archdemon, Kingu). The world is " good" and man is an imago dei; he lives, like his creator and model, in paradise. However, as Genesis is not slow to emphasize, life is painful, even though it was blessed by God, and men no longer inhabit paradise. But all that is the result of a series of errors and sins on the part of the ancestors. It is they who changed the human condition. God has no responsibility in this deterioration of his masterpiece. As he is for post-Upani~adic Indian thought, manmore precisely, the human species-is the result of his own acts. The other, Yahwistic, account (2: 5 ff.) is older and differs markedly from the sacerdotal text we have just summarized. There is no longer any question of the creation of heaven and earth but rather of a desert that God (Yahweh) made fertile by a flood that rose from the ground. Yahweh modeled man (adam) from loam and animated him by breathing "into his nostrils a breath of life." Then Yahweh "planted a garden in Eden," made every kind of "good tree" grow (2:8 ff.), and set man in the garden to "cultivate and take care of it " (2: 15). Then Yahweh fashioned the animals and birds, still from the soil, and brought them to Adam, and Adam gave them names.5 Finally, after putting him to sleep, God took one of Adam's ribs and formed a woman, who received the name of Eve (Heb. hawwah, a word etymologically closely connected with the term meaning" life"). The exegetes have observed that the Yahwistic account, which is simpler, does not oppose the aquatic "chaos" to the world of "forms" but rather the desert and dryness to life and vegetation. So it seeins plausible that this origin myth came into existence in a
4. But there are other texts that refer to a victory over an ophidian monster, called dragon (tannin) or Rahab or Leviathan, and that are reminiscent of the
Mesopotamian and Canaanite traditions (cf., for example, Psalm 74:13 if.;
Job 26:12 if.). 5. This is a feature peculiar to the archaic ontologies: animals and plants begin really to exist from the moment when they are given names (cf. the example of an Australian tribe in Eliade, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, p. 194).

desert region. As for the creation of the first man from loam, the theme was known, as we have seen (§ 17), at Sumer. Similar myths are documented more or less throughout the world, from ancient Egypt and Greece to the "primitive" peoples. The basic idea seems to be the same: man was formed from a primal substance (earth, wood, bone) and was animated by the creator's breath. In a number of cases his form is that of his originator. In other words, as we have already observed in regard to a Sumerian myth, by his "form" and his "life" man in some way shares in the condition of the creator. It is only his body that belongs to "matter." 6 The creation of woman from a rib taken from Adam can be interpreted as indicating the androgyny of the primordial man. Similar conceptions are documented in other traditions, including those transmitted by certain midrashim. The myth of the androgyne illustrates a comparatively widespread belief: human perfection, identified in the mythical ancestor, comprises a unity that is at the same time a totality. We shall gauge the importance of androgyny when we come to discuss certain Gnostic and Hermetic speculations. We should note that human androgyny has as its model divine bisexuality, a conception shared by a number of cultures.7
54. Paradise lost. Cain and Abel
The Garden of Eden, with its river that divided into four branches, and its trees that Adam was to guard and cultivate, is reminiscent of Mesopotamian imagery. Probably, in this case too, the biblical narrative makes use of a particular Babylonian tradition. But the myth of an original paradise, inhabited by the primordial man, and
6. We add that, according to many traditions, at death the "spirit" returns to the presence of its celestial creator and the body is restored to the earth. But this anthropological" dualism" was rejected by the biblical authors, as it was,
furthermore, by the majority of their Near Eastern contemporaries. It is only comparatively late that new anthropological conceptions proposed a more daring solution. 7. Divine bisexuality is one of the many formulas for the totality/unity signified by the union of opposed pairs: feminine-masculine, visible-invisible, heaven-earth, light-darkness, but also goodness-wickedness, creationdestruction, etc. Meditation on these pairs of opposites led, in various regions, to daring conclusions concerning both the paradoxical condition of the divinity and the revalorization of the human condition.



166 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
the myth of a paradisal place whose access is difficult for human beings, were known beyond the Euphrates and the Mediterranean. Like all "paradises," Eden 8 is situated at the "center of the world," where the four-branched river emerges. In the middle of the garden stood the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (2: 9). Yahweh gave man this commandment: " You may eat indeed of all the trees in the garden. Nevertheless the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you are not to eat, for on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die" (2: 16-17). An idea that is unknown elsewhere emerges from this prohibition: the existential value of knowledge. In other words, knowing can radically alter the structure of human existence.
However, the serpent succeeds in tempting Eve. "No! You will not die," it says to her. "God knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil" (3: 4-5). This rather mysterious episode has given rise to countless interpretations. The background suggests a well-known mythological emblem: the naked goddess, the miraculous tree, and its guardian, the serpent. But instead of a hero who triumphs and wins a share in the symbol of life (miraculous fruit, fountain of youth, treasure, etc.), the biblical narrative gives us Adam, ingenuous victim of the serpent's perfidy. In short, we are dealing with a failed "immortalization," like that of Gilgamesh (§ 23). For, once omniscient, equal to the "gods," Adam could discover the Tree of Life (of which Yahweh had not spoken to him) and become immortal. The text is clear and categorical: "Yahweh God said, See, the man has become like one of us, with his knowledge of good and evil. He must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and pick from the tree of life also and eat some and live forever" (3: 22). And God banished the couple from paradise and condemned them to work for a living. If we return to the scenario mentioned a moment ago, of the naked goddess and the miraculous tree, guarded by a dragon, we can see that the serpent of Genesis succeeded, all things considered, in its role as guardian of a symbol of life or of youth. But this archaic myth was
S. The Hebrews connected the world with ceden, "delights." The term "paradise," of Iranian origin (pairi-daeza), is later. Parallel images, chiefly familiar in the Near East and the Aegean world, present a Great Goddess beside a Tree of Life and a vivifying spring, or a Tree of Life guarded by monsters and griffins; see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, §§104-S.



Paradise lost. Cain and Abel 167
radically altered by the author of the biblical accounts. Adam's "initiatory failure" was reinterpreted as a well-justified punishment: his disobedience betrayed his Luciferian pride, the desire to be like God. It was the greatest sin that the creature could commit against his creator. It was the" original sin," a notion pregnant with consequences for the Hebrew and Christian theologies. Such a vision of the "fall" could command recognition only in a religion centered on the omnipotence and jealousy of God. As it has been handed down to us, the biblical narrative indicates the increasing authority of Yahwistic monotheism.9 According to the redactors of chapters 4-7 of Genesis, this first sin not only brought about the loss ofparadise and the transformation of the human condition; it became in some sense the source of all the evils that burdened humanity. Eve gave birth to Cain, who "tilled the soil," and Abel, a "shepherd." When the brothers made their thank offering-Cain of the products of the soil, and Abel of the firstborn of his flock-Yahweh accepted the latter's offering, but not Cain's. Angry, Cain "set on his brother Abel and killed him" (4:8). "Now," spake Yahweh, "be accursed and driven from the ground.... When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield you any of its produce. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer over the earth" (4:11-12). It is possible to find in this episode an opposition between cultivators and herders and, implicitly, an apologia for the latter. Yet, if the name Abel means "shepherd," Cain means "smith." Their conflict reflects the ambivalent position of the smith in certain societies of pastoralists, where he is either scorned or respected but is always feared. 10 As we saw (§ 15), the smith is regarded as the "master of fire" and possesses redoubtable magical powers. In any case, the tradition preserved in the biblical narrative reflects the idealization of the "simple and pure" existence of the nomadic herders and the resistance against the sedentary life of agriculturalists and dwellers in towns. Cain became "builder of a town" (4: 17),
9. It must be added, however, that the myth of the "fall" has not always been understood in accordance with its biblical interpretation. Especially from the Hellenistic period and down to the time of illuminism, countless speculations have sought to elaborate a more daring, and often more original, Adamic mythology.

and one of his descendants is Tubal-cain, "the ancestor of all metalworkers in bronze or iron" (4:22). So the first murder is performed by him who in some sort incarnates the symbol of technology and urban civilization. Implicitly, all techniques are suspected of magic.
55. Before and after the flood
It would serve no purpose to enumerate the descendants of Cain and of Seth, Adam's third son. In conformity with the tradition documented in Mesopotamia, according to which the earliest ancestors attain a fabulous age, Adam engendered Seth at the age of 130 and died 800 years later (5:3 fr.). All the descendants of Seth and Cain enjoyed lives 800 to 900 years in length. A curious episode marks this prediluvial period: the union of certain celestial beings, "sons of God," with the daughters of men, who gave them children, "the heroes of days gone by, the famous men" (6:1-4). These "sons of God" are probably "fallen angels." Their story will be told in full in a late book (Enoch 6-11), which does not necessarily imply that the myth was previously unknown. And in fact similar beliefs are found in ancient Greece and in India: it is the period of the heroes, semidivine figures whose activity took place just before the beginning of the present age (" at the dawn of history"), that is, at the time when the institutions peculiar to each culture were being established. To return to the biblical narrative, it was after these unions between the fallen angels and the daughters of mortals that God resolved to limit man's lifetime to 120 years. Whatever the origin of these mythical themes may be (Cain and Abel, the patriarchs of the time before the flood, the descent of the "sons of God," the birth of the heroes), it is significant that the redactors maintained them in the final text of Genesis, and this despite certain anthropomorphic characteristics with which they burden Yahweh. The greatest event of this period was the flood. "Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that the thoughts of his heart fashioned nothing but wickedness all day long" (6: 5). God repented of having created man and decided to destroy him. Only Noah, his wife, and his sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), with their wives, were saved. For "Noah was a good man ... and he walked with God" (6:10). Following Yahweh's detailed instructions,



Before and after the flood 169
Noah built the ark and filled it with representatives of all the animal species. "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, and on the seventeenth day of that month, that very day all the springs of the great deep broke through, and the sluices of heaven opened. It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights" (7:11-12). When the waters withdrew, the ark stopped on Mount Ararat. Noah went out of the ark and offered a sacrifice. "Yahweh smelt the appeasing fragrance" and, pacified, promised himself that he would not "curse the earth again because of man" (8: 21). And he made a covenant with Noah and his descendants, and the sign of the covenant was the rainbow (9: 13). The biblical account has a certain number of elements in common with the account of the flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh. It is possible that the redactor knew the Mesopotamian version or, what seems still more probable, used an archaic source, preserved from time immemorial in the Near East. Flood myths, as we observed before (§ 18), are extremely widespread, and they all share in essentially the same symbolism: the need to radically destroy a degenerate world and humanity so that they can be recreated, that is, restored to their initial integrity. But this cyclical cosmology proves to be already modified in the Sumerian and Akkadian versions. The redactor of the biblical narrative returns to and carries on the reinterpretation of the catastrophe of the flood: he raises it to the rank of an episode in sacred history. Yahweh punishes man's depravity and does not regret the victims of the cataclysm (as the gods do in the Babylonian version; cf. the Epic of Gilgamesh, tablet 11, lines 116-25, 136-37). The importance that he accords to moral purity and to obedience anticipates the Law that will be revealed to Moses. Like so many other fabulous events, the flood was later continually reinterpreted and revalorized from different points of view. The sons of Noah became the ancestors ofa new humanity. In that period everyone spoke the same language. But one day men decided to build" a tower with its top reaching heaven" (11: 14). This was the last Luciferian exploit. Yahweh "came down to see the town and the tower" and realized that, henceforth, "there will be nothing too hard for them to do" (11 :5-6). Then he confused their language, and men no longer understood one another. After that, Yahweh scattered them "over the whole face of the earth, and they stopped building the town" (11 :7-8), which later was known by the name of Babel.



170 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
In this case, too, we are dealing with an old mythical theme reinterpreted from the viewpoint of Yahwism. We have, first of all, the archaic tradition according to which certain privileged beings (ancestors, heroes, legendary kings, shamans) mounted to the sky by the help of a tree, a lance, a rope, or a chain of arrows. But ascent to the sky in concreto was interrupted at the end of the primordial mythical period.ll Other myths report the failure of later attempts to climb to heaven by means of various scaffoldings. It is impossible to know if the redactor of the biblical narrative knew of these immemorial beliefs. In any case, he was familiar with the Babylonian ziggurats, which had a similar symbolism. Indeed, the ziggurat was considered to have its base at the navel of the earth and its summit in the sky. By climbing the ziggurat, the king or the priest arrived ritually (that is, symbolically) in heaven. Now, for the redactor of the biblical narrative, this belief, which he took literally, was at once simplistic and sacrilegious, so it was radically reinterpreted; more precisely, it was desacralized and demythicized. It is important to emphasize the following fact: despite a long and complex labor of selection, elimination, and devalorization of the archaic materials, whether inherited or borrowed, the last redactors of Genesis preserved a whole mythology of the traditional type. It begins with the cosmogony and the creation of man, paints the "paradisal" existence of the ancestors, relates the drama of the "fall," with its fatal consequences (mortality, need to work in order to live, etc.), describes the progressive degeneration of the first humanity, which justifies the flood, and concludes with a last fabulous episode: the loss of linguistic unity and the dispersal of the second, postdiluvial humanity, the consequence of a new Luciferian project. As in the archaic and traditional cultures, this mythology, all things considered, constitutes a "sacred history": it explains the origin of the world and at the same time the actual human condition. To be sure, for the Hebrews this "sacred history" became paradigmatic after Abraham and, above all, with Moses; but this does not invalidate the mythological structure and function of the first eleven chapters of Genesis. A number of authors have dwelt on the fact that the religion of Israel did not invent even one myth. Yet if the term "invent" is
11. In our day shamans undertake this celestial journey" in spirit," that is, in an ecstatic trance.



The religion of the patriarchs 171
understood to mean a spiritual creation, the work of selection and criticism of the immemorial mythological traditions is equivalent to the emergence of a new myth, in other words, of a new religious vision of the world which can become paradigmatic. Now the religious genius of Israel transformed the relations of God with the chosen people into a sacred history of a type previously unknown. After a certain moment, this "sacred history," seemingly exclusively national, proves to be a paradigmatic model for all humanity.
56. The religion of the patriarchs
The twelfth chapter of Genesis introduces us into a new religious world. Yahweh12 says to Abraham: "Leave your country, your family, and your father's house for a land I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name so famous that it will be used as a blessing. I will bless those who bless you: I will curse those who slight you. All the tribes of the earth shall bless themselves in you" (12: 1-3). In its present form this text was certainly redacted centuries after the event that it relates. But the religious conception implicit in the "election" of Abraham continues beliefs and customs well known in the Near East of the second millennium. What distinguishes the biblical narrative is God's personal message and its consequences. Without being first invoked, God reveals himself to a human being and, after laying a series of injunctions on him, makes him a series of prodigious promises. According to the tradition, Abraham obeys him, as he will obey him later, when God will demand that he sacrifice Isaac. We are here in the presence of a new type of religious experience-" Abrahamic faith," as it was understood after Moseswhich, in the course of time, will become the religious experience peculiar to Judaism and to Christianity. So Abraham left Ur of the Chaldaeans and arrived at Haran, in the northwest part of Mesopotamia. Later he traveled south and settled for a time at Shechem; after that he led his caravans between Palestine and Egypt (Gen. 13:1-3). The history of Abraham and the

172 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
adventures of his son Isaac, of his grandson Jacob, and of Joseph, constitute the period known as the Age of the Patriarchs. For a long time, criticism held the patriarchs to be legendary figures. But for the past half-century, especially in the light of archeological discoveries, some authors have been inclined to accept, at least in part, the historicity of the patriarchal traditions. To be sure, this does not mean that chapters 11-50 of Genesis represent "historical documents." For our purpose it is of little significance to know if the ancestors of the Hebrews, the Apiru, were donkey-breeders and merchant caravaners13 or if they were herders of lesser cattle on the way to becoming sedentary.14 It is enough to remember that there are a certain number of analogies between the customs of the patriarchs and the social and juridical institutions of the Near East. It is also admitted that many mythological traditions were known to, and adapted by, the patriarchs during their stay in Mesopotamia. As for the religion of the patriarchs, it is characterized by the cult of the "god of the father."15 He is invoked, or manifests himself, as "the god of myIthyIhis father" (Gen. 31 :5; etc.). Other formulas include a proper name, sometimes preceded by the word "father": "the god of Abraham" (Gen. 31 :53), "the god of thy father Abraham" (26:24; etc.), "tlie god of Isaac" (28:13), "the god ofmylhis father Isaac" (32:10; etc.), or "god of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob" (32:24, etc.). These formulas have parallels in the ancient East.16 The "god of the father" is primitively the god of the immediate ancestor, whom his sons recognize. By revealing himself to the ancestor, he certified a sort of kinship. He is a god of nomads, not tied to a sanctuary but to a group of men, whom he accompanies and protects. He "binds himself to those who believe in him by

promises."17 Other names, perhaps even more ancient, are pabad yi$l)iik, which has been translated "fear of Isaac" but which rather means "kinsman of Isaac," and 'abhir ya'aqobh, which means "fortress (or defender) of Jacob" (Gen. 31 :42, 53). On entering Canaan the patriarchs were confronted by the cult of the god El, and the "god of the father" ended by being identified with him.18 This assimilation allows us to suppose that there was a certain structural resemblance between the two types of divinity. In any case, once he was identified with El, the "god of the father" obtained the cosmic dimension that he could not have as the divinity of families and clans. This is the first historically documented example of a synthesis that enriches the patriarchal heritage. It will not be the only one. A number of passages describe, though rather summarily, the religious practices of the patriarchs. Some of these passages, however, reflect a later situation. Hence it is advisable to compare the biblical data with the practices typical of archaic pastoral cultures and, first of all, those of the pre-Islamic Arabs. According to Genesis, the patriarchs offered sacrifices, built altars, and set up stones, which they anointed with oil. But it is probable that only the blood sacrifice (zebal)) of the pastoral type, without priests and, according to some, without altars, was practiced: "Each sacrificer immolated his own victim, chosen from the flock; it was not burned, it was eaten in common by the sacrificer and his family."19 It is difficult to determine the original meaning of standing stones (massebah) , for their religious context differs. A stone can bear witness to a compact (Gen. 31 :45,51-52), serve as a tomb (35:20),
17. De Vaux, p. 261: "The theme of the promise recurs often in Genesis. It appears there in different forms: promise of a posterity, or of land, or of both together." 18. The patriarchal narratives mention names made up of the element eel followed by a substantive: EI Roi, "EI ofthe vision" (Gen. 16:13); EI Shaddai, "He of the Mountain" (18: 1; etc.); EI eOlam, "EI of Eternity" (21: 33); EI Bethel (31:13; etc.). See de Vaux, pp. 262 ff.; Ringgren, pp. 33 ff. (Eng. trans., pp. 20 ff.); Cross, pp. 44 ff. 19. De Vaux, p. 271: "In Central Arabia, the victim was immolated before a standing stone, symbol of the divine presence; the blood was poured over the stone or into a trench dug at the foot of it. Such sacrifices were offered especially at the festivals that the nomadic Arabs celebrated in the first spring month
to insure the fertility and prosperity of the herd. It is probable that the ancestors of Israel, seminomadic herders, already celebrated a similar festival."

or indicate a theophany, as in the episode of Jacob. Jacob fell asleep with his head on a stone and saw a ladder whose top reached heaven, and "Yahweh was there, standing over him," and promised him that country. When he woke, Jacob set up the stone on which he had slept, and he called the place beth-el, the "house of God" (Gen. 28:10-22). Standing stones played a role in the Canaanite cult; this is why they were later condemned by Yahwism. But the custom existed among the pre-Islamic Arabs (cf. note 19), so it is probable that it was also practiced by the ancestors of the Israelites.20
57. Abraham, "Father of the Faith"
However, the two rituals that played a considerable part in the religious history of Israel are the sacrifice marking the covenant and the sacrifice ofIsaac. The first (Gen. 15: 9 ff.) was directly prescribed to Abraham by God. It included dividing a heifer, a goat, and a ram in two, a rite that has analogies elsewhere (for example, among the Hittites; cf. § 43). But the decisive element is a nocturnal theophany: "When the sun had set ... there appeared a smoking furnace and a firebrand that went between the halves (of the sacrificed animals)" (15:17). "That day (God) made a covenant with Abraham" (15:18). This covenant is not a contract. God laid no obligation on Abraham: it is only he who engages himself. The ritual, of which no other example is found in the Old Testament, was practiced until the time of Jeremiah. A number of authors deny that it was known in the days of the patriarchs. To be sure, the sacrifice is presented in a Yahwistic context, but its theological interpretation could not destroy its primitive character. In Genesis only one sacrifice is described in detail: the sacrifice of Isaac (22: 1-19). God had demanded of Abraham that he sacrifice his son to him as a burnt offering «olah), and Abraham was preparing to sacrifice Isaac when a ram was substituted for him. This episode has given rise to countless controversies. For one thing, it has been
20. The patriarchal narratives mention certain sacred trees, for example the Oak of Moreh (Gen. 12:6) and the Oak of Mamre (13:18; etc.). These trees of the patriarchs, the veneration of which became embarrassing, were later forbidden, when condemnations were issued against the Canaanite cult sites (" on hills, under any spreading tree "-Deut. 12: 2).



Abraham, "Father of the Faith" 175
observed that the term "burnt offering" is repeated six times. Now this type of sacrifice appears to have been borrowed from the Canaanites after the definitive settlement of the tribes. 21 The term "idealization of the past" has also been used. However, it must not be forgotten that Genesis contains a number of sordid stories, "which shows that the writers were more concerned with the faithful transmission of tradition than with idealization." 22 (The italics are ours.) Whatever its origin may be, the episode illustrates, more forcefully than any other in the Old Testament, the deep meaning of " Abrahamic" faith. Abraham did not prepare to sacrifice his son in pursuit of a definite purpose, as Mesha, king of the Moabites, did when he sacrificed his eldest in order to wrest victory from Israel (2 Kings 3: 27), or as Jephthah did, who vowed to Yahweh that he would sacrifice the first person he met after the victory as a burnt offering to him, never imagining that it would be his own daughter, his only child (Judges 11 :30 ff.). This is not a sacrifice of the firstborn, a ritual that, in any case, was not known until later and that never became common among the Israelites. Abraham felt that he was bound to his God by "faith." He did not" understand" the meaning of the act that God had demanded of him, whereas those who offered their firstborn to a divinity were perfectly well aware of the meaning and the magico-religious power of the ritual. On the other hand, Abraham never doubted the sanctity, perfection, and omnipotence of his God. Consequently, if the prescribed act had every appearance of being an infanticide, it was because of the powerlessness of human understanding. God alone knew the meaning and the value of a gesture that, for all others, was indistinguishable from a CrIme. Here we are confronted by a special case of the dialectic of the sacred: not only is the" profane" transmuted into the" sacred," at the same time retaining its original structure (a sacred stone does not cease to be a stone), but its" sacralization" is not even comprehensible
21. De Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israe'/, p. 270: "The first mentions in the unquestionably ancient texts date from the period of the Judges." 22. H. H. Rowley, Worship in Ancient Israel, p. 27. And indeed the text teaches us very little about the cult practiced by some of Jacob's sons, but we are told many stories that are dishonorable to him, for example the story of Simeon and Levi at Shechem (Gen. 34) or of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38).



176 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
by the mind: infanticide is not transformed into a ritual intended to produce a particular effect (as was the case with those who sacrificed their firstborn). Abraham did not perform a ritual (since he pursued no objective and did not understand the meaning of his act); on the other hand, his "faith" assured him that he was not committing a crime. One would say that Abraham did not doubt the" sacrality" of his gesture, but it was" irrecognizable" and hence unknowable. Meditation on this impossibility of recognizing the sacred (since the sacred is completely identified with the profane) will have marked consequences. As we shall see, Abrahamic faith will enable the Jewish people, after the destruction of the Temple and the disappearance of the state, to bear all the ordeals of their tragic history. And it is equally by meditating on the example of Abraham that, even at such a late date as the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, certain Christian thinkers have grasped the paradoxical and, in the last analysis, "irrecognizable" nature of their faith. Kierkegaard renounced his fiancee in the hope that, in some way impossible to imagine, she would be restored to him. And when Leon Chestov affirmed that true faith implies only one certainty-that "for God all is possible"-he was only restating, in simpler terms, the experience of Abraham.
58. Moses and the departure from Egypt
The beginnings of the religion ofIsrael are related in Genesis, chapters 46-50, in Exodus, and in the Book of Numbers. Their content is a series of events, most of which were directly caused by God. We list the most important: the settling of Jacob and his sons in Egypt; the persecution launched some centuries later by a pharaoh who ordered the extermination of the firstborn of the Israelites; the vicissitudes of Moses (miraculously saved from the massacre and brought up at the pharaoh's court) after killing an Egyptian soldier who was beating a Hebrew, especially his flight into the desert of Midian, the appearance of the" burning bush" (his first encounter with Yahweh), the mission laid upon him by God, to bring his people out of Egypt, and the revelation of the divine name; the ten plagues sent by God to force the pharaoh to consent; the departure of the Israelites and their crossing the Sea of Reeds, whose waters overwhelmed the Egyptian



Moses and the departure/rom Egypt 177
chariots and soldiers that were pursuing them; the theophany on Mount Sinai and Yahweh's covenant with his people, followed by instructions concerning the content of the revelation and the cult; finally, the forty years ofjourneying in the desert, the death of Moses, and the conquest of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua. For more than a century criticism has made every effort to separate the "probable," and hence "historical," elements of these biblical narratives from the mass of" mythological" and" folkloric" excrescences and sedimentations.23 Use has also been made of the philological and archeological documents relating to the political, cultural, and religious history of the Egyptians, the Canaanites, and other peoples of the Near ·East. With the help of such documents, there was hope of illuminating and clarifying, perhaps even of reconstructing, the history of the different groups of Hebrews, from Jacob's settling in Egypt (eighteenth to seventeenth centuries) down to the events that are echoed in the traditions of the Exodus and the entry into Canaan, events that a number of authors place in the twelfth century.24 The extrabiblical documents have certainly contributed to fitting the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan at least partially into a historical context. Quite definite dates have, for example, been proposed for the departure from Egypt, on the basis of data concerning the military and political situation of certain pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty; the stages of the conquest of Canaan have been identified by taking into consideration the results of excavations, first of all the dates of the successive destructions of certain Canaanite cities. But a number of these chronological correlations and concordances are still in dispute. It is not for us to take a position in a controversy in which few specialists are in agreement. It is enough to cite the fact that it has not been possible, as it had been hoped, to recover the historicity of
23. The work of "demythicization" was comparatively easy (for such "miracles" as the ten plagues or the crossing of the Sea of Reeds could not be regarded as "historical" events). On the other hand, the interpretation of the possible historicity of the biblical texts proved to be extremely delicate. Analysis had distinguished several redactions, made at different periods and from different theological viewpoints. In addition, the influence of several literary genres had been detected. The seeming historicity of an episode became subject to doubt when it was found that the redactor used the cliches of a particular literary genre (saga, novella, proverb, etc.). 24. According to Exodus 12:40, the Israelites remained in Egypt for 430 years.



178 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
certain events of the utmost importance for the religion of Israel. This, of course, in no way proves their nonhistoricity. But the historical events and personages have been so much modeled on paradigmatic categories that in most cases it is no longer possible to detect their original "reality." There are no reasons for doubting the reality of the personage known by the name of Moses, but his biography and the specific traits of his personality escape us. By the mere fact that he has become a charismatic and fabulous figure, his life, beginning with his miraculous preservation in a papyrus basket left among the reeds of the Nile, follows the_ model of many other heroes (Theseus, Perseus, Sargon of Agade, Romulus, Cyrus, etc.). The name of Moses, like that of other members of his family, is Egyptian. It contains the element msy, "born, son," comparable to Ahmosis or Rameses (Ra-messes, "son of Ra"). The name of one of Levi's sons, Merari, is the Egyptian Mrry, "Well-loved"; Pinhas, Aaron's grandson, is PC-nbsy, "the Negro." It is not impossible that the young Moses knew the "reform" of Akh-en-Aton (ca. 13751350), who had replaced the cult of Amon by the solar "monotheism" of Aton. Some scholars have noted 25 the analogy between the two religions: Aton, too, is proclaimed "the only god"; like Yahweh, he is the god" who creates everything that exists"; finally, the importance that Akh-en-Aton's "reform" accords to "instruction" is comparable to the role of the Torah in Yahwism. On the other hand, the Ramesside society, in which Moses was brought up two generations after Akh-en-Aton's "reform" had been suppressed, could not attract him. Its cosmopolitanism, religious syncretism (especially between Egyptian and Canaanite cults), certain orgiastic practices (prostitution of both sexes), the "cult" of animals, were so many abominations for anyone brought up in the "religion of the Fathers." As for the departure from Egypt, it seems certainly to reflect a historical event. However, it does not involve the exodus of the whole people, but only of a group, and precisely of the group led by Moses. Other groups had already begun their more or less peaceful entrance into Canaan. Later, the Exodus was claimed by all the

ff., 269 ff., and his The Biblical Period/rom Abraham to Ezra, pp. 15 ff. But for other authors the analogies do not seem convincing; see Ringgren, La religion
d'Israel, p. 51 (Eng. trans., p. 39); Fohrer, History 0/ Israelite Religion, p. 79.



"I Am Who I Am" 179
Israelite tribes as an episode of their sacred history. What is important for our purpose is that the departure from Egypt was put into relation with the celebration of the Passover. In other words, an archaic sacrifice peculiar to nomad herders and practiced for millennia by the ancestors of the Israelites was revalorized and incorporated into the sacred history of Yahwism. A ritual belonging to cosmic religiosity (the pastoral festival of spring) was interpreted as the commemoration of a historical event. The transformation of religious structures of the cosmic type into events ofsacred history is characteristic of Yahwistic monotheism and will be taken up again and continued by Christianity.
59. "I Am Who 1 Am"
While he is keeping sheep for his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses crosses the desert and comes to the "mountain of God," Horeb. There he sees a "flame of fire coming from the middle of a bush" and hears himself called by name. A few moments later the voice of God comes to him, saying, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3: 6). Nevertheless, Moses senses that he is in the presence of an unknown aspect of the divinity, or even of a new god. He accepts the order to go to the children of Israel and say to them, "The God of your fathers has sent me to you"; but, if they ask what God's name is, "what am I to tell them?" (3: 13). "And God said to Moses, I Am Who I am Ceyeh 'aser 'ehyeh)." And he teaches him to address the children of Israel in these terms: "I Am has sent me to you" (3:14). This name has given rise to an immense amount of discussion.26 God's answer is mysterious enough: he refers to his mode of being but does not reveal his person. All that can be said is that the divine name suggests, to use a modern expression, the totality of being and of the existent. Yet Yahweh declares that he is the god of Abraham and the other patriarchs, and this identity is still accepted today by all those who lay claim to the Abrahamic inheritance. And in fact

180 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
it is possible to discover a certain continuity between the god of the father and the god who reveals himself to Moses. As has been said, "to begin with, there is the fact that Yahwism is born in a milieu of herders and develops in the desert. The return to pure Yahwism will be presented as a return to the desert situation: it will be the' nomadic ideal' of the prophets." 27 Exactly like the god of the father, Yahweh is not attached to a particular place; in addition, he has a special relation to Moses as leader of a group. But the differences are significant. While the god of the father was anonymous, Yahweh is a proper name that indicates his mystery and his transcendence. The relations between the divinity and his worshipers have changed: instead of the former" god of the father," we now hear of the "people of Yahweh." The idea of divine election, present in the promises made to Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3), becomes more definite: Yahweh calls the descendants of the patriarchs "my people"; they are-to use R. de Vaux's expression-his "personal property." As the assimilation of the god of the father with El proceeded, Yahweh was also identified with him. He took El's cosmic structure as well as his title of king. "From the religion of EI, Yahwism also took the idea of the divine court formed by the ben~ 'elohim."28 On the other hand, Yahweh's warlike character carries on the role of the god of the father, supremely the protector of his worshipers. The essence of the revelation is concentrated in the Decalogue (Exod. 20:3-17; cf. Exod. 34:10-27). In its present form the text cannot date from the time of Moses, but the most important commandments certainly reflect the spirit of primitive Yahwism. The first article of the Decalogue, " You shall have no gods except me," shows that what is involved is not monotheism in the strict sense. The existence of other gods is not denied. In the song of victory chanted after the passage of the Sea of Reeds, Moses exclaims: "Who among the gods is your like, Yahweh?" (Exod. 15:11). But absolute fidelity is demanded, for Yahweh is a "jealous God" (Exod. 20: 5). The struggle against the false gods begins immediately after the

"But it seems more correct to say that El gave his mildness and his compassion to Yahweh, who would primitively have been a fierce and violent god. In the probably ancient text of Exodus 34:6, Yahweh defines himself as •tender and compassionate'" (ibid., p. 429).



"I Am Who I Am" 181
escape from the desert, at Baal-peor. It is there that the daughters of the Moabites invite the Israelites to the sacrifices to their gods. " And the people ate and bowed down before their gods" (Numbers 25: 2 ff.), thus arousing Yahweh's wrath. For Israel, this struggle, begun at Baal-peor, still continues. The meaning of the Second Commandment, " You shall not make yourself a carved image ... " is difficult to perceive. It is not a prohibition against the cult of idols. Images, familiar to the pagan cults, were well known to be only receptacles of the divinity. Probably the underlying idea of this commandment implied a prohibition against representing Yahweh by a cult object. Just as he had no name, Yahweh should have no image. God permitted himself to be seen, by certain privileged persons, face to face; for the rest of mankind he was manifest only through his acts. Unlike the other Near Eastern divinities, who manifested themselves indifferently in human, animal, or cosmic form, Yahweh is conceived as exclusively anthropomorphic. But he also has recourse to cosmic epiphanies, for the whole world is his creation. Yahweh's anthropomorphism has a twofold aspect. On the one hand, Yahweh displays qualities and faults that are specifically human: compassion and hate, joy and grief, forgiveness and vengeance. (However, he does not show the weaknesses and faults of the Homeric gods, and he will not tolerate being ridiculed, as certain Olympians do.) 29 On the other hand, unlike the majority of divinities, Yahweh does not reflect the human situation; he does not have a family, but only a celestial court: Yahweh is alone. Are we to see another anthropomorphic characteristic in the fact that he demands absolute obedience from his worshipers, like an Oriental despot? This seems rather to be an inhuman desire for absolute perfection and purity. The intolerance and fanaticism that are characteristic of the prophets and missionaries of the three monotheisms have their model and their justification in Yahweh's example. So, too, Yahweh's violence exceeds the bounds of anthropomorphism. His "wrath" sometimes proves to be so irrational that it has been possible to refer to his "demonism." To be sure, some of these negative characteristics will become indurated later, after the occupation of Canaan. But the" negative characteristics" belong to
29. See Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion, pp. 78 ff.



182 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
Yahweh's original structure. What is in fact involved is a new, and the most impressive, expression of the deity as absolutely different from his creation, the "utterly other" (the ganz andere of Rudoph Otto). The coexistence of these contradictory attributes, the irrationality of some of his acts, distinguish Yahweh from an ideal of perfection on the human scale. From this point of view, Yahweh resembles certain divinities of Hinduism, Siva, for example, or KaJi-Durga. But there is a difference, and a substantial one: these Indian divinities take their place beyond morality, and since their mode of being constitutes a paradigmatic model, their worshipers do not hesitate to imitate them. Yahweh, on the contrary, accords the greatest importance to ethical principles and practical morality: at least five commandments of the Decalogue refer to them. According to the biblical narrative, it was three months after the departure from Egypt, and in the Sinai Desert, that the theophany took place. "The mountain of Sinai was entirely wrapped in smoke, because Yahweh had descended on it in the form of fire. Like smoke from a furnace the smoke went up, and the whole mountain shook violently. Louder and louder grew the sound of the trumpet, Moses spoke, and God answered him in peals of thunder " (Exod. 19 :18-19). Then Yahweh appeared to the Israelites, who had remained at the foot of the mountain, and made a covenant with them, dictating the Laws of the Covenant, which begins with the Decalogue and includes a number of prescriptions for the cult (Exod. 20: 22-26 and chaps. 24-26).30 Later, Moses had another conversation with God and received the "two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God" (31 :18; cf. another version, 34: 1-28). Mendenhall has observed that the stylistic form of the Laws of the Covenant is reminiscent of the treaties of the Hittite sovereigns of the second millennium with their vassals in Asia Minor.31 But the similarities between the two formulas, though real, do not appear to be decisive. Nothing definite is known concerning the cult practiced by the Israelites during the forty years they spent in the desert. Exodus 26

and 38: 8-38 give a detailed description of the desert sanctuary; it consists of the Tent of Meeting, which shelters the ark of the Testimony or ark of the Covenant, a wooden coffer containing-according to a late tradition-the tables of the Laws (Deut. 10:1-5; etc.). Very probably this tradition reflects a real situation. Cult tents or palanquins, in which stone idols were carried, are documented among the Arabs before Islam. The texts do not mention the ark and the tent together, but it is probable that, as among the Arabs, the tent covered the ark. As the god of the father had done earlier, Yahweh led his people. The ark symbolized that invisible presence, but it is impossible to know what it contained. According to tradition, Moses died in the Plain of Moab, opposite Jericho. Yahweh showed him the land of Canaan: "I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you shall not cross into it" (Deut. 34:4; cf. Num. 27:12-14). This death, too, corresponds to the legendary and paradigmatic personage of Moses. All that can be said concerning the person known by that name is that he was distinguished by his repeated and dramatic encounters with Yahweh. The revelation of which Moses was the intermediary made him at once an ecstatic and oracular prophet and a "magician "-the model ofthe Levite priests and the supremely charismatic leader who succeeded in transforming a group of clans into the nucleus of a nation, the people of Israel.
60. Religion under the judges: The first phase of syncretism
The period between 1200 B.C., when the group that had been led by Moses entered Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, and 1020 B.C., when Saul was proclaimed king, is, by common consent, known as the Age of the Judges. The judges were military leaders, councillors, and magistrates. It is during this period that other tribes accept Yahwism, especially after certain brilliant victories. For Yahweh directly intervenes in battle. He assures Joshua: "Do not be afraid of these men; I have delivered them into your power" (Josh. 10:8). And in fact Yahweh caused "huge hailstones" to fall from heaven, killing the enemy by thousands (Josh. 10:11). After the victory over Jabin, king of Canaan, Deborah and Barak hymn the divine fury: "Yahweh, when you set out from Seir ... earth shook. the heavens



184 "WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD"
quaked, the clouds dissolved into water" (Judg. 5:4). In short, Yahweh proves to be stronger than the gods of the Canaanites. War waged in his name is a holy war: 32 the men are consecrated (qiddes, "to sanctify") and must preserve ritual purity. As for booty, it is "forbidden," that is, it is entirely destroyed, offered as a holocaust to Yahweh. But in adapting itself to a new style of existence, Yahwism evolves and changes. We first notice a reaction against the values most esteemed by every society of herders. The law of hospitality, the sacrosanct law among nomads, is traitorously broken by Jael: she invites the Canaanite chief, Sisera, who was fleeing after the defeat, into her tent and kills him in his sleep (Judg. 4: 17 ff.). The portable sanctuary of Moses' day falls into disuse. The cult is now practiced in sanctuaries and sacred sites. But, as was to be expected, it is above all the confrontation with the Canaanite religion that will have marked consequences. Indeed, this confrontation continues until the seventh century B.C. In consequence of the association Yahweh-EI, the pre-Yahwistic sanctuaries belonging to the cult of EI, together with a number of Canaanite sanctuaries, are consecrated to Yahweh.33 More surprising is the confusion that existed, during the Age of the Judges, between Yahweh and Baal. Names with baal as an element are found even in families known for their Yahwistic faith. The famous Gideon is also named Jerubbaal, "Baal fights" (Judg. 6: 32). This presupposes that the word baal, "Lord," was understood as an epithet of Yahweh or that Baal was venerated side by side with Yahweh.34 In the beginning Baal must have been accepted as "god of the land," the supreme specialist in fecundity. It is only later that his cult was execrated and became the paradigmatic proof of apostasy.
32. G. von Rad, Der heilige Krieg im alten Israel (1951), summarized by Ringgren, La religion d'Israe'l, pp. 66-67 (Eng. trans., pp. 53-54). The term "forbidden," herem, derives from a root meaning "sacred." Ringgren considers the phenomenon typically Israelite; but A. Lods and Albright cite other examples, and not only among the Semites; cf. Rowley, Wor~hip in Ancient Israel, p. 56 and note 7.
33. See the list of these sanctuaries in Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion, pp. 111-13. On the syncretism of the cults, see G. W. Ahlstrom, Aspects of

Religion under the judges 185
A large part of the Canaanite sacrificial system was adopted. The simplest form of sacrifice consisted in the offering, on a consecrated site, of different gifts or in libations of oil or water. The offerings were regarded as food for the divinity (Judg. 6:19). It is at this time that the Israelites begin to practice the burnt offering (Colah), which they interpret as an oblation offered to Yahweh. In addition, they take over a number of Canaanite practices, related to agriculture, and even certain orgiastic rituals.35 The process of assimilation is intensified later, under the monarchy, when there is mention of sacred prostitution of both sexes. Sanctuaries are built after Canaanite models. They include an altar, massebahs (standing stones), asherahs (wooden posts symbolizing the Canaanite goddess Asherah), and vessels for libations. Among the ritual objects, we mention the most important: teraphim (images or masks) and ephods (originally garments put on the image). The personnel of the cult is organized around the sanctuaries of which it is the guardian. Of chief importance are the priests and Levites: they offer sacrifices and seek to determine Yahweh's will by lots and the ephod. Next to the priests and Levites we find diviners or seers (r6'€h), but we have little information about their functions. The seers were not attached to sanctuaries, as the prophets (niibfim) were. The most famous example is Balaam (Num. 22-24): he sees Yahweh in a dream or waking; he has to see the Israelites in order to be able to curse them. This type of ecstatic is documented in other nomadic societies (for example, the kahin among the Arabs).36 Far more important was the function of the "prophet" (niibf); we shall return to him later (§116). For the moment, we add that Israelite ecstatic prophecy has its deep roots in the Canaanite religion.37 And in fact the cult of Baal included niibiim (see I Kings 18:19 ff.; 2 Kings 10:19). But this is a type of ecstatic experience that is comparatively common in the ancient Near East, with the exception of Egypt. The Sumerians knew the "man who enters heaven," a designation that indicates an ecstatic journey comparable to that of the shamans. At Mari, texts of the eighteenth century speak of the

Like the prophets of Israel, they use oracular phrases that tend to be short and send their messages to kings, even when they contain bad news or criticize certain acts of the sovereign.38 Even in the first centuries of the conquest and colonization, we note a Canaanite influence that is profound and takes many forms. Indeed, the ritual system, the sacred sites and sanctuaries are taken over from the Canaanites; the priestly class is organized after Canaanite models; finally, even the prophets, who will soon react against the supremacy of the priests and against syncretism with the fertility cults, are also the product of a Canaanite influence. Yet the prophets lay claim to the purest Yahwism. From a certain point of view, they are right; but the Yahwism that they proclaim has already assimilated the most creative elements of Canaanite religion and culture, so savagely execrated by the prophets.

8 The Religion of
the Indo-Europeans: The Vedic Gods
61. Protohistory of the Indo-Europeans
The irruption of the Indo-Europeans into history is marked by terrible destruction. Between 2300 and 1900 B.C. in Greece and Asia Minor many cities are sacked and burned; for example, Troy (about 2300 B.C.), Beycesultan, Tarsus, and some three hundred cities and villages in Anatolia. The documents mention ethnic groups named Hittites, Luwians, and Mitanni. But Aryan-speaking elements are also attested in other bodies of invaders. The dispersal of the IndoEuropean peoples had begun some centuries earlier, and it continued for two millennia. By about 1200 B.C. the Aryans had made their way into the Indo-Gangetic plain, the Iranians were firmly established in Persia, and Greece and the islands were Indo-Europeanized. Some centuries later, the Indo-Europeanization of India, the Italian Peninsula, the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpatho-Danubian regions, and central, northern, and western Europe-from the Vistula to the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic-was either completed or well advanced. This characteristic process-migration, conquest of new territories, submission of the inhabitants, followed by their assimilation-did not end until the nineteenth century of our era. Such an example of linguistic and cultural expansion is otherwise unknown. For more than a century, scholars have made every effort to identify the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans, to decipher their protohistory, and to clarify the phases of their migrations. Their land of origin has been sought in northern and central Europe, in the Russian steppes, in central Asia, in Anatolia, etc. It is generally agreed today to localize the home of the Indo-Europeans in the regions north of the Black Sea, between the Carpathians and the



188 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
Caucasus.1 Between the fifth and third millennia these regions saw the development of the so-called Tumuli (kurgan) Culture. About 4000-3500 B.C. it expanded westward, as far as Tisza. During the following millennium the representatives ofthe Kurgan Culture made their way into central Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, Transcaucasia, Anatolia, and northern Iran (ca. 3500-3000 B.C.); in the third millennium they reached northern Europe, the Aegean zone (Greece and the coasts of Anatolia), and the eastern Mediterranean. According to Marija Gimbutas, the peoples who developed and disseminated the Kurgan Culture can only have been the Proto-Indo-Europeans and, in the last phases of their dispersal, the Indo-Europeans. However this may be, it is certain that the origins of the IndoEuropean culture are rooted in the Neolithic, perhaps even in the Mesolithic. On the other hand, it is equally certain that during its formative period this culture was influenced by the more developed civilizations of the Near East. The use of the chariot and of metal 2 was transmitted by an Anatolian culture (the so-called Kuro-Araxas Culture). In the fourth millennium there appear, borrowed from the peoples of the Balkano-Mediterranean zone, clay,_ marble, or alabaster statues representing a seated goddess. The common vocabulary shows that the Indo-Europeans practiced agriculture, raised cattle (but also the pig and probably the sheep), and knew the horse, either as wild or domesticated. Though they were never able to renounce agricultural products, the Indo-European peoples preferred to develop a pastoral economy. Pastoral nomadism, the patriarchal structure of the family, a proclivity for raids, and a military organization designed for conquest are characteristic features of the Indo-European societies. A more or less radical social differentiation is indicated by the contrast between the tumuli (tombs built in the form of a house and richly furnished) and the far poorer burials. Very probably the tumuli (kurgan) were reserved for the corpses of chiefs. For our purpose it is important to determine to what an extent this mode of existence-pastoral nomadism, vigorously reorganized for
1. The common vocabulary for certain animals (wolf, bear, goose, freshwater salmon, wasp, bee) and trees (birch, beech, oak, and willow) indicates a temperate zone. 2. The terms for "copper" and "ax" are Sumerian; they were borrowed before the separation of the European linguistic groups (Germanic, Italic and Celtic, Illyrian and Thracian, Greek and Slavic).

war and conquest-encouraged and facilitated the emergence of specific religious values. Obviously, the creations of agricultural societies do not completely correspond to the religious aspirations of a pastoral society. On the other hand, no pastoral society can exist in complete independence from the economy and religion of the cultivators. What is more, in their migrations and conquests the IndoEuropeans continually brought into subjection and assimilated sedentary agricultural populations. In other words, quite early in their history the Indo-Europeans must have known the spiritual tensions produced by the symbiosis of heterogeneous-and even antithetical-religious orientations.
62. The first pantheon and the common religious vocabulary
It is possible to reconstitute certain structures of the common IndoEuropean religion. To begin with, there are the brief but valuable indications furnished by the religious vocabulary. The earliest studies already recognized the Indo-European root deiwos, "sky," in the terms designating the" god" (Lat. deus, Skr. deva, Iran. div, Lith. diewas, Old Ger. tivar) and in the names of the principal gods: Dyaus, Zeus, Jupiter. The idea of god proves to be bound up with celestial sacrality, that is, with light and "transcendence " (height) and, by extension, with the idea of sovereignty and with creativity in its immediate meaning: cosmogony and paternity. The (god of the) sky is supremely the father: cr. Indian Dyauspitar, Greek Zeus Pater, Illyrian Daipatiires, Latin Jupiter, Scythian Zeus-Papaios, ThracoPhrygian Zeus-Pappos.3 Since celestial and atmospheric hierophanies playa cardinal role, it is not surprising that a certain number of gods are designated by the name of thunder: German Donar, Thorr; Celtic Taranis (Tanaros); Baltic Perkunas; Proto-Slavic Perun; etc. It is probable that in the Indo-European period the sky god (the supreme god as creator of the world and cosmocrator) was already yielding place to
3. The Greek vocable theos does not belong to the same series. It derives from a root designating the "soul," the "spirit of the deceased"; cf. Lith. dwesiu, "to breathe," Old Slavic duch, "breathing," dusa, "soul." Hence it may be supposed that theos, "god," develops from the idea of the deified dead.



190 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
the storm gods-a phenomenon comparatively frequent in the history of religions. Similarly, fire, kindled by lightning, is regarded as of celestial origin. The cult of fire is a characteristic element of the IndoEuropean religions; the name of the important Vedic god Agni occurs in Latin ignis, Lithuanian ugnis, Old Slavic ogni.4 It may also be supposed that the solar god held a preponderant place even from protohistory (cf. Vedic Siirya, Greek Relios, Old German sauil, Old Slavic so/nee, all designating the sun). But the solar gods had a checkered history among the different Indo-European peoples, especially after their contact with the Near Eastern religions.5 As for the earth (*GHcEM), it was regarded as a vital energy opposed to the sky; but the religious idea of Mother Earth is more recent among the Indo-Europeans and occurs in a limited area.6 We find another cosmic element, the wind, deified in Lithuanian Wejopatis, "Master of the Wind," and in Iranian Vayu and Indian Vayu. But in the case of these last two we have more than cosmic epiphanies, for they show, especially Iranian Vayu, the characteristic features of sovereign gods. The Indo-Europeans had elaborated a specific mythology and theology. They practiced sacrifices and knew the magico-religious value of the word and of chanting (*KAN). They possessed concepts and rituals that enabled them to consecrate space and to "cosmicize" the territories in which they settled (this mythico-ritual scenario is documented in ancient India, at Rome, and among the Celts), and this also enabled them periodically to renew the world (by ritual combat between two groups of celebrants, a rite of which vestiges still remain in India and Iran). The gods were regarded as being present at the festivals, side by side with men, and offerings to them were burned. The Indo-Europeans built no sanctuaries; very probably the cult was celebrated in a consecrated enclosure, under the open sky. Another characteristic feature is oral transmission of the

S. In addition, in the period of Greco-Oriental syncretism, the sacrality represented by the sun gave scope for a daring theological and philosophical ree1aboration, so that the solar god could be said to have been the last cosmic theophany to disappear before the expansion of Judeo-Christian monotheism. 6. We add that man, as a terrestrial being (OH" MON), is later opposed in the West to celestial beings, whereas in the East we find the concept man, rational creature (Me NU), opposed to the animals; see Devoto, Origini indo-europee, pp. 264 fT.

tradition and, after their encounter with the Near Eastern civilizations, the prohibition against using writing. But, as could be expected in view of the many centuries that separate the earliest Indo-European migrations (Hittites, IndoIranians, Greeks, Italics) from the latest (Germans, Balto-Slavs), the common heritage is not always recognizable in the vocabulary or the theologies and mythologies of the historical period. On the one hand, the different cultural contacts that occurred during the migrations must be taken into consideration; on the other hand, it must not be forgotten that no religious tradition continues to exist indefinitely without changes produced either by new spiritual creations or by borrowings, symbiosis, or elimination. The vocabulary reflects this process of differentiation and innovation, which probably began even in protohistory. The most significant example is the absence in common Indo-European of a specific term designating the "sacred." On the other hand, in Iranian, Latin, and Greek two terms are available: Avestan spentaJ yaoidiita (cf. also Gothic hailsJweih); Latin sacerJsanctus; Greek hierosJhagios. "Study of each of these attested pairs ... leads to supposing, in prehistory, a biaspectual notion: positive, 'what is charged with divine presence,' and negative, 'what it is forbidden to men to touch.'" 7 Similarly, according to Benveniste, there was no common term to designate "sacrifice." But this absence "has as its counterpart, in the various languages and often within each of them, a great diversity of designations corresponding to the various forms of the sacrificial act: libation (Skr. juhoti, Gk. spend6), solemn verbal engagement (Lat. voveo, Gk. euchomai), ritual feast (Lat. daps), fumigation (Gk. thu6), rite of light (Lat. lustro)." B As for "prayer," the terminology was built up from two different roots.9 In short,
7. E. Benveniste, Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-europeennes, vol. 2, p. 179. As for religion, "not conceiving this omnipresent reality as a separate institution, the Indo-Europeans had no term to designate it" (ibid., p. 265). Georges Dumezil has several times analyzed the Indo-European vocabulary of the sacred; see, most recently, his La religion romaine archaique, 2d ed. (1974), pp. 131-46 (Eng. trans. by Philip Krapp, Archaic Roman Religion, 2 vols. [Chicago, 1970], 1: 129-38). 8. Benveniste, Le vocabulaire, p. 223. However, Erich Hamp has recently reconstructed the common term for "sacrifice"; see JIES 1 (1973): 320-22. 9. The original Hittite-Slavic-Baltic-Armenian (-Germanic?) dialectal grouping attests forms related to Hittite maltdi-, "to pray," whereas Iranian, Celtic, and Greek present terms derived from the root *ghwedh-"to pray, to desire" (Benveniste, Le vocabulaire, p. 245).



192 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
from their common protohistory the different Indo-European peoples showed a marked tendency continually to reinterpret their religious traditions. This process was intensified in the course of the migrations.
63. The Indo-European tripartite ideology
The fragments of the various Indo-European mythologies constitute an important source. To be sure, these fragments are of different ages and have come down to us in heterogeneous documents of unequal value: hymns, ritual texts, epic poetry, theological commentaries, popular legends, historiographies, and late traditions recorded by Christian authors after the conversion of the peoples of central and northern Europe. Nevertheless, all these documents arevaluable, for they preserve or reflect (even in distorted form) a number of original religious conceptions. The exaggerations and errors of "comparative mythology," as it was understood by Max Muller and his followers, must not be allowed to deny us the use of these materials. It is enough not to mistake their documentary value. A myth documented in the Rig Veda cannot be later than the second millennium B.C., whereas the traditions preserved by Livy, by the Irish epic, or by Snorri Sturluson are, from the chronological point of view, considerably more recent. But if such traditions agree in every point with the Vedic myth, it is difficult to doubt their common Indo-European character, especially if the coincidence is not isolated but falls into place in a system. This is what Georges Dumezil has demonstrated in a series of works that have radically renewed the comparative study of IndoEuropean mythologies and religions. There is no need to summarize them here. Suffice it to say that the French scholar's researches have disclosed the fundamental structure of Indo-European society and ideology. To the division of society into three classes-priests, warriors, stock-breeders and farmers-corresponded a trifunctional religious ideology: the function of magical and juridical sovereignty, the function of the gods of martial force, and, finally, the function of the divinities of fecundity and economic prosperity. It is among the Indo-Iranians that we best perceive this tripartite division of the gods and society. And indeed, in ancient India, to the social classes of the brahmanas (priests, sacrificers), k~atriya (soldiers, protectors of the



The Indo-European tripartite ideology 193
community), and vaisya (producers), there correspond the gods Varul)a and Mitra, Indra, and the twin Nasatyas (or the Asvins). The same gods appear, named in the same order, in the treaty concluded, about 1380, between a Hittite king and the chief of the para-Indians (Mitanni) in Asia Minor: Mitra-(V)arul)a (variant Uruvana), Indara, the two Nasatyas. Similarly, the Avesta distinguishes priests (iithra.van), warriors (fighting in chariots, rathae-star), stock-breeders and farmers (viistryo.fsuyant)-with the difference that, in Iran, this social division did not harden into a caste system. According to Herodotus (4. 5-6), the Iranian Scythians also knew the division into three classes, and the tradition persisted into the nineteenth century among the Ossets of the Caucasus, direct descendants ofthe Scythians. The Celts distributed society into druids (priests, jurists), military aristocracy (flaith, literally "power," the equivalent of Sanskrit k$atrii), and b6 airig, free men (airig) owning cows (b6). According to Dumezil, a similar social division can be discerned in the mythical, but strongly historicized, traditions of the founding of Rome: King Romulus, protected by Jupiter; the Etruscan Lucumon, technician of war; Tatius and the Sabines, who bring women and wealth. The Capitoline triad-Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus-in a way constitutes the divine, celestial model of Roman society. Finally, a similar triad dominates Scandinavian religion and mythology: Odin, the sovereign god, Thor, the champion, and Frey, patron of fecundity. The division of the first function into two complementary parts or tendencies-magical sovereignty and juridical sovereignty-is clearly illustrated by the pair Varul)a and Mitra. For the ancient Indians, Mitra is the sovereign god "in his reasoning, clear, ordered, calm, benevolent, sacerdotal aspect, and Varul)a the sovereign in his attacking, somber, inspired, violent, terrible, warlike aspect."lO Now the same diptych is found again, especially at Rome, with the same oppositions and the same alternations; on the one hand, there is the opposition between the Luperci-young men running naked through the city, striking women with a goatskin thong to make them fertileand the priests proper, the Flamens; in another area, there are the different behaviors of the two first kings of Rome: Romulus, who founds the two cults of the terrible Jupiter, and Numa, who founds a

194 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
sanctuary of Fides Publica and professes a particular devotion to that goddess, who guarantees good faith and registers vows. In principle, the opposition Romulus-Numa coincides with the opposition Luperci-Flamens; it also corresponds exactly with the polarity VaruQa-Mitra. In his analysis of the two aspects of divine sovereignty among the Indians and the Romans, Dumezil has aptly emphasized the differences. In Vedic India as in Rome, the same Indo-European structure is recognizable, but the two "ideological fields" are not homogeneous. "The Romans think historically, whereas the Indians think in fable. The Romans think nationally, and the Indians cosmically." Over against the empirical, relativistic, political, juridical thought of the Romans stands the philosophical, absolute, dogmatic, moral, and mystical thought of the IndiansY Similar differences are discernible in the "ideological fields" of other Indo-European peoples. As we have already observed, the documents at our disposal constitute specific expressions of the different Aryan-speaking peoples in the course of history. In short, it is only the general structure of the Indo-European ideology that we can grasp, not the thought and religious practices of the original community. But this structure informs us concerning the type of religious experience and speculation peculiar to the Indo-Europeans. It allows us, furthermore, to appreciate the particular creativity of each of the Aryanspeaking peoples. As was to be foreseen, the greatest morphological diversity is documented on the plane of the third function, for religious expressions related to abundance, peace, or fecundity are necessarily connected with the geography, economy, and historical situation of each group. As for the second function, physical force, and especially the use of force in combat, Dumezil has brought out a certain number of correspondences between India (already among the Indo-Europeans), Rome, and the Germanic world. Thus the supreme initiatory ordeal very probably consisted in the young warrior's fighting against three adversaries or against a three-headed monster (represented by a puppet 1). And in fact such a scenario can be deciphered in the story of the victorious fight of the Irish hero Cuchulainn against three brothers, in the fight of Horatius against the three
11. Dumezil, Servius et La Fortune, pp. 190-92.



The Aryans in India 195
Curiatii, as well as in the myths of Indra and the Iranian hero Thraetaona, each of whom kills a monster with three heads. Victory produces in Cuchulainn and Horatius a "fury" (juror, Celtic ferg) that is dangerous to society and must be ritually exorcised. In addition, the mythical theme of the "three sins" of Indra finds homologues, in Scandinavia, in the tale of the hero Starcatherus, and, in Greece, in the mythology of Heracles.12 Very probably these mythico-ritual themes did not exhaust the mythology and techniques of the warrior in the common Indo-European period. But it is important to note that they were preserved at the two extremes of the dispersal, India and Ireland. So far as we can judge, the tripartite ideology constituted a consistent but flexible system, variously completed by a multitude of divine forms and religious ideas and practices. We shall have occasion to gauge their number and importance in studying the different Indo-European religions separately. There are reasons for believing that the tripartite ideology, though elaborated during the common period, had driven out or radically reinterpreted equally venerable conceptions, for example, that of the sky god as creator, sovereign, and father. The eviction of Dyauspitar for the benefit of VaruI}.a, traces of which are found in the Rig Veda, seems to reflect, or to carryon, a process begun much earlier.
64. The Aryans in India
In their common period the Indo-Iranian tribes called themselves by a significant name, "noble (man)" (airya in Avestan, iirya in Sanskrit). The Aryans had begun their advance into northwestern India at the beginning of the second millennium; four or five centuries later they occupied the region of the "Seven Rivers," sapta sindhavah,13 that is, the basin of the Upper Indus, the Punjab. As we remarked (§ 39), it is possible that the invaders attacked and ruined
12. These three sins are committed in respect to the three functions, taking place respectively in the domains of religious order, the warrior ideal, and fertility-which confirms the trifunctional hypothesis. We add that the identification of a common Indo-European motif in the mythology of Heracles is significant, for in Greece the tripartite ideology was early broken down as the result of symbiosis with Aegean culture. 13. The name is also known in the Avesta: Haptahindu.



196 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
certain Harappan cities. The Vedic texts recount the battles against the diisa or dasyu, in whom we may recognize the continuers or survivors of the Indus civilization. They are described as having black skins, being "noseless," speaking a barbarian language, and professing the cult of the phallus (sisna deva). They are rich in herds and live in fortified settlements (pur). It is these "forts" that Indrasurnamed purandara, "destroyer of fortifications"-attacked and ruined by the hundreds. The battles occurred before the composition of the hymns, for the memory of them is strongly mythologized. The Rig Veda also mentions another hostile population, the Pani, who steal cows and reject the Vedic cult. It is probable that Hariyfipiya, on the banks of the river Ravi, is identical with Harappa. In addition, the Vedic texts refer to the ruins (arma, armaka) inhabited by "witches"; this shows that the Aryans associated the ruined cities with the former inhabitants of the region.14 Nevertheless, symbiosis with the aborigines begins comparatively soon. If in the late books of the Rig Veda the word diisa means "slave," indicating the fate of the conquered Dasa, other members of the subjected population seem to be duly integrated into the Aryan society; for example, the chief Dasa, praised because he protects the Brahmans (Rig Veda 8. 46.32). Marriage with the autochthons leaves traces in the language. Vedic Sanskrit possesses a series of phonemes, especially the cerebral consonants, which are found in no other IndoEuropean idiom, not even in Iranian. Very probably these consonants reflect the pronunciation of the aborigines trying to learn the language of their masters. Similarly, the Vedic vocabulary preserves a large number of non-Aryan words. What is more, certain myths are of autochthonous origin.15 This process of racial, cultural, and religious symbiosis, documented from the earliest period, will increase as the Aryans advance toward the plain of the Ganges. The Vedic Indians practiced agriculture, but their economy was chiefly pastoral. Cattle performed the function of money. Milk and its products were eaten, but also the flesh of bovines. The horse was highly esteemed, but it was reserved exclusively for war, for raids,

and for the royal ritual (see § 73). The Aryans had no cities and knew nothing of writing. Despite the simplicity of their material culture, carpenters and bronzesmiths enjoyed great prestige.16 Iron began to be used only about 1050 B.C. The tribes were governed by military chiefs, riijiis. The power of these kinglets was balanced by popular councils (sabhii and samiti). Toward the end of the Vedic period the organization of society into four classes had been completed. The term varna, designating the social classes, means "color," an indication of the ethnic multiplicity that was at the base of Indian society. The hymns reveal only certain aspects of life during the Vedic period. Their representation is on the summary side: the Aryans love music and dancing: they play the flute, the lute, and the harp. They are fond of intoxicating drinks, soma and surii, the latter having no religious meaning. The game of dice was popular; an entire hymn of the Rig Veda (RV 10. 34) is devoted to it. A number of hymns refer to conflicts between different Aryan tribes. The most famous, the tribe of the Bharatas, had triumphed, under its king, Sudas, over a confederation of ten princes. But the historical data supplied by the Rig Veda are scanty enough. Certain names of Vedic tribes-for example, that of the Bharatas-reappear in later literature. The Mahiibhiirata, composed at least five or six centuries after the Vedic period, recounts the great war between the Kurus and their cousins, the pandavas. According to the tradition preserved by the PuraQas, this war took place about 1400 B.C. in the Madhyadesa, in the center of the peninsula, which indicates that the Aryans had advanced beyond the Ganges. At the time when the great theological treatise Satapatha Briihma1)a was composed, between 1000 and 800 B.C., the provinces of Kosala and Videha were Aryanized. For its part, the Riimiiyiina shows that Aryan influence extended into the south. Just as the adversaries of the Aryans were mythologized, metamorphosed into demons and sorcerers, the battles fought during the conquest of the territory were transfigured or, more precisely, assimilated to Indra's combats against Vrtra and other demonic beings. We shall later discuss the cosmological implications of such paradigmatic combats (§ 68). For the moment, we will point out that
16. Naturally, this description of the material culture must be supplemented by the parallel world of the magico-religious values of tools and their respective mythologies (§ 9).



198 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
the occupation of a new territory became legitimate by the building of an altar (giirhapatya) dedicated to AgniP "One says that one is settled (avasyati) when one has built a giirhapatya, and all those who build the fire altar are established" (Satapatha Br. 7. 1. 1. 1-4). But the building of an altar dedicated to Agni is simply a ritual imitation of the creation. In other words, the occupied territory is first of all transformed from chaos to cosmos; by the effect of the rite, it receives a form and becomes real. As we shall see in a moment, the Vedic pantheon is dominated by the gods. The few goddesses whose names we know play a more or less shadowy role: the enigmatic Aditi, the mother of the gods; Usas, the goddess of dawn; Ratri, Night, to whom a beautiful hymn is devoted (Rig Veda 10. 127). All the more significant, then, is the dominant position of the Great Goddess in Hinduism; to be sure, she illustrates the triumph of extra-Brahmanic religiosity, but she also illustrates the creative power of the Indian spirit. Obviously, we must take it into account that the Vedic texts represent the religious system of a priestly elite which served a military aristocracy; the rest of the society-that is, the majority, the vaisyas and the sudrasprobably held ideas and beliefs similar to those that we find, two thousand years later, in Hinduism.1s The hymns do not reflect the whole of the Vedic religion; they were composed for an audience primarily occupied with earthly goods: health, long life, many sons, abundant cattle, wealth. 19 So it is plausible to think that certain religious conceptions that will become popular later were already formulated in the Vedic period. The creative power of the Indian spirit that we have just suggested appears especially in the process of symbiosis, assimilation, and revalorization that leads to the Aryanization of India and, later, to its Hinduization. For this process, which occupied several millennia, takes place in dialogue with the religious system elaborated by the Brahmans on the basis of the Vedic "revelation" (sruti). In the last

19. This is reminiscent of the situation of Greek religion in the time of Homer, whose poems were addressed to a military elite, little or not at all concerned with the mysteries of cosmic fertility and the postexistence of the soul-mysteries that, however, governed the religious activity of their wives and subjects.

analysis, the religious and cultural unity of India was the result of a long series of syntheses, effected under the sign of the poet-philosophers and ritualists of the Vedic period.
65. VarUJ}a, primordial divinity: Devas and Asuras
The hymns do not present the oldest form of the Vedic religion. Dyaus, the Indo-European sky god, has already disappeared from the cult. His name now designates the "sky" or the "day." The vocable indicating the personification of uranian sacrality ends by designating a natural phenomenon. This is a comparatively frequent process in the history of celestial gods: they fade before other divinities and become dii otiosi. It is only insofar as he is venerated as sovereign god that a celestial god succeeds in preserving his original prestige.20 Yet the Vedic poets still remember the "Sky that Knows All" (Atharva Veda 1. 32. 4), and they invoke the "Sky Father," Dyauspitar (ibid. 6.4. 3); above all, Dyaus is present in the primordial pair, Dyavaprithivi, "Sky and Earth" (Rig Veda 1. 160). The place of Dyaus is very soon taken by VaruQ.a, supremely the sovereign god. The stages that led to his advancement to the rank of universal king, samraj (RV 7.82.2) are little known. Varuna is designated especially by the title asura, a title also possessed by other gods, for example Agni (e.g., Atharva Veda 1. 10. 1, etc.). Now the Asuras constituted the most ancient divine family (AV 6. 100.3). The Vedic texts refer to the conflict that opposed the gods (devas) to the Asuras. This conflict will be related and commented upon at length during the post-Vedic period, in the Briihma1)as, treatises devoted to the mystery of sacrifice. Indeed, the victory of the gods was decided when Agni, at Indra's invitation, abandoned the Asuras, who did not possess sacrifice (RV 10. 124; 5.5); soon afterward the Devas took the sacrificial Word (Vac) from the Asuras. It was then that Indra invited VaruQ.a into his kingdom (RV 5.5). The victory of the Devas over the Asuras was assimilated to Indra's triumph over the Dasyus, who were also hurled down into deepest darkness (AV 10.2.17; cf. RV 7.99.4; etc.). This mythical conflict reflects the battle of the young gods, directed by Indra, against a group of primordial divinities. The fact
20. See Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, pp. 66 fT.



200 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
that the Asuras are reputed to be unrivaled magicians (AV 3. 9. 4; 6. 72. 1) and were assimilated to the sudras does not necessarily mean that they represent the gods of the pre-Aryan autochthonous populations. In the Vedas the title asura is used as an epithet for any god, even for Dyaus and Indra (the latter is named "Sovereign of the Asuras" in AV 6. 83. 3). In other words, the term asura refers to the specific sacred powers belonging to a primordial situation, especially that which existed before the organization of the world. The young gods, the Devas, did not fail to take over these sacred powers; this is why they enjoy the epithet asura. It is important to emphasize that the "time of the Asuras" precedes the present epoch, ruled by the Devas. In India as in a number of archaic and traditional religions, the passage from a primordial epoch to the present epoch is explained in cosmogonic terms: passage from a state of chaos to an organized world, a cosmos. We shall find this cosmogonic background again in Indra's mythical combat against the primordial dragon, Vrtra (§ 68). Now VaruJ}.a, as a primordial divinity, the outstanding asura, was identified with Vrtra. This identification made possible a whole series of esoteric speculations on the mystery of the divine biunity.
66. Val1l\la, universal king and magician: rta and miiyii
The Vedic texts present VaruJ}.a as sovereign god: he reigns over the world, the gods (devas), and men. He "stretched out the Earth as a butcher stretches a hide, so that it should be the carpet of the Sun." He put "milk in cows, intelligence in hearts, fire in the waters, in the sky the sun, soma on the mountain" (RV 5. 85. 1-2). Cosmocrator, he possesses certain attributes ofthe celestial gods: he is viSvadarsata, "visible everywhere" (RV 8. 41. 3), omniscient (AV 4. 16. 2-7), and infallible (RV 4. 16.2-7). He is "thousand-eyed" (RV 7.34. 10), the mythical formula for the stars. Since he "sees" everything, and no sin, however hidden, escapes him, men feel "like slaves" in his presence (RV 1. 25. 1). "Terrible sovereign," "master of bonds," he has the magical power of binding his victims at a distance, but also of setting them free. Numerous hymns and rituals have as their object protecting or liberating man from the" bonds of VaruJ}.a." 21
21. Eliade, Images and Symbols, pp. 95 if. H. Petersson has explained Varu:Qa's name from the Indo-European root uer, "to bind."



Varu~a, universal king and magician: rta and maya 201
He is represented with a rope in his hand, and, in the ceremonies, whatever he binds or ties, beginning with knots, is called "Varunian." Despite these spectacular accomplishments, VaruI}.a is already in decline in the Vedic period. He is far from enjoying the popularity of Indra, for example. But he is intimately connected with two religious
notions that will have an exceptional future: rta and maya. The word rta, past participle of the verb "to fit," designates the order of the world-an order that is at once cosmic, liturgical, and moral.22 There is no hymn addressed to rta, but the term is frequently used (more than 300 times in the Rig Veda). The creation is proclaimed to have been effected in conformity with rta, it is repeatedly said that the gods act according to rta, that rta rules both the cosmic rhythms and moral conduct. The same principle also governs the cult. "The seat of rta" is in the highest sky or in the fire altar. Now VaruI}.a was brought up in the "house" of rta, and he is declared to love rta and bear witness to rta. He is called the" King of rta," and this universal norm, identified with truth, is said to be "founded" in him. He who breaks the law is responsible before VaruI}.a, and it is always VaruI}.a, and only VaruI}.a, who reestablishes the order damaged by sin, error, or ignorance. The sinner hopes for absolution through sacrifices (which, furthermore, are prescribed by VaruI}.a himself). All this brings out his structure as cosmocratorgod. In the course of time VaruI}.a will become a deus otiosus, surviving principally in the erudition of the ritualists and in religious folklore. Yet his relations to the idea of universal order suffice to insure him an important place in the history of Indian spirituality.23 At first sight it seems paradoxical that the guardian of rta should
at the same time be intimately connected with maya. Yet the association is comprehensible if we take into account the fact that VaruI}.a's cosmic creativity also has a "magical" aspect. It has been agreed to
derive the term maya from the root may, "to change." In the Rig
Veda, maya designates "destructive change or change that negates
22. "Seeing the prominent place held by this notion, almost under the same vocable, both among the para-Indians of Mesopotamia and Syria and among Iranians of every obedience, assures us that it already furnished the basis for the reflections and explanations of the Indian Indo-Iranians" (G. Dumezil, "Ordre, fantaisie, changement," Revue des Etudes Latines 32 [1957]: 140). 23. In the classic language the term rta will be replaced by the vocable dharma, whose grandiose destiny we shall see later. In the Rig Veda, dhaman and dhiirman are used, respectively, 96 and 54 times.



202 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
good mechanisms, demonic and deceitful change, and also alteration of alteration." 24 In other words, there are good and evil ';'ayas. In the first case, we have "ruses" and "magics," chiefly transformation magics of the demonic type, like those of the serpent Vrtra, who is the mayin, that is, the magician, the" trickster" without a rival. Such a maya impairs the cosmic order; for example, it halts the course of the sun or holds the waters captive, etc. As for the good mayas, they are of two kinds: (1) the mayas of combat, the" counter-mayas" used by Indra when he challenges demonic beings,25 and (2) the maya that creates forms and beings-the privilege of the sovereign gods, first of all of VaruJ)a. This cosmological maya can be regarded as equivalent to rta. And in fact numerous passages present the alternation of day and night, the course of the sun, the falling of rain, and other phenomena implying rta, as resulting from the creative maya. So it is in the Rig Veda, some 1500 years before classic Vedan(a, that we perceive the first meaning of maya: "intentional change," that is, alteration-creation or destruction-and " alteration of alteration." It is to be noted now that the origin of the philosophical concept of maya-cosmic illusion, unreality, nonbeing-is found at once in the idea of "change," of alteration of the cosmic norm, hence of magical or demonic transformation, and in the idea of the creative power of VaruJ)a, who, by virtue of his maya, reestablishes the order of the universe. From this we understand why maya came to mean cosmic illusion; it is because, from the beginning, the notion involved is ambiguous, not to say ambivalent, for it implies not only demonic alteration of the cosmic order but also divine creativity. Later the cosmos itself will become, for Vedanta, an illusory "transformation," in other words, a system of changes devoid of reality. To return to VaruJ)a, it is to be noted that his mode of beingterrible sovereign, magician, and master of bonds-admits of a surprising closeness to the dragon Vrtra. Whatever may be thought of the etymological kinship of their names,26 it is proper to point

out that both of them are related to the primordial waters, and first of all to the" waters withheld" (" the great VaruQa has hidden the sea," RV 9. 73. 3). Night (the nonmanifested),27 the waters (the virtual; germs), transcendence and nonaction (characteristics of the sovereign gods) have a solidarity, at once mythical and metaphysical, not only with bonds of every kind, but also with the dragon Vrtra, who, as we shall see, "withheld," "stopped," or "chained" the waters. What is more, VaruQa is assimilated to the serpent Ahi and to Vrtra.28 In the Atharva Veda (12. 3. 57) he is termed a "viper." But it is especially in the M ahabharata that VaruQa is identified with serpents. There he is called" Lord of the Sea" and" King of niigas," and the ocean is the "dwelling place of the niigas." 29
67. Serpents and gods. Mitra, Aryaman, Aditi
This ambiguity and ambivalence of VaruQa is important in several respects. But it is especially the paradigmatic character of the union of opposites that must claim our attention. For it constitutes one of the characteristics of Indian religious thought long before it becomes the object of systematic philosophy. Ambivalence and the union of contraries are not peculiar to VaruQa alone. The Rig Veda (1. 79. 1) already termed Agni a "furious serpent." The Aitareya Briihma1).a (3. 36) states that the serpent Ahi Budhnya is invisibly (parok$ena) what Agni is visibly (pratyak$a). In other words, the serpent is a virtuality of fire, whereas darkness is nonmanifested light. In the Viijasaneyi Samhitii (5. 33), Ahi Budhnya and the Sun (Aja Ekapad) are identified. When the Sun rises at dawn, he "frees himself from Night ... just as Ahi frees himself from his skin" (Sat. Br. 2. 3; 1. 3 and 6). Similarly, the god Soma, "just like Ahi, crawls out of his old skin" (RV 9.86.44). The Satapatha Briihma1).a identifies him

with Vrtra (3. 4. 3. 13; etc.). The Adityas are said to have been originally serpents. Having cast off their old skins-which means that they acquired immortality ("they have conquered Death")-they became gods, Devas (Pancavimsa Br. 25. 15.4). Finally, the Satapatha Briihma1)a (13. 4. 3. 9) declares that "the knowledge of the Serpents (sarpa-vidyii) is the Veda." 30 In other words, the divine doctrine is paradoxically identified with a "knowledge" that, at least in the beginning, had a "demonic" character. To be sure, the assimilation of the gods to the serpents in some sort prolongs the idea, documented in the Brhadiiranyaka Upani~ad (1. 3. 1), that the Devas and the Asuras are the children ofPrajapati and that the Asuras are the elder. The common descent of antagonistic figures constitutes one of the favorite themes to illustrate the primordial unity-totality. We shall find a spectacular example of this when we study the theological interpretations of the famous mythical combat between Indra and Vrtra. As for Mitra, his role is secondary when he is isolated from Varul)a. In the Veda, only one hymn (RV 3.59) is devoted to him. But he shares with Varul)a the attributes of sovereignty, incarnating its pacific, benevolent, juridical, and sacerdotal aspects. As his name indicates, he is "Contract" personified, just like the Avestan Mithra. He facilitates agreements between men and makes them honor their engagements. The sun is his eye (Taitt. Briih. 3. 1. 5. 1); all-seeing, nothing escapes him. His importance in religious activity and thought is especially manifested when he is invoked together with Varul)a, of whom he is at once the antithesis and the complement. The binomial Mitra-Varut).a, which even in the earliest period played a considerable role as supreme expression of divine sovereignty, was later used as a paradigmatic formula for all kinds of antagonistic pairs and complementary oppositions. With Mitra are associated Aryaman and Bhaga. The former protects the society of the Aryans; he especially governs the obligations that establish hospitality and is concerned with marriages. Bhaga, whose name means "share," insures the distribution of wealth. Together with Mitra and Varul)a (and sometimes with other gods), Aryaman and Bhaga make up the group of the Adityas, or sons of the goddess Aditi, the "Nonbound," that is, the Free. Since
30. On this theme, see Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 88 if.



Indra, champion and demiurge 205
the time of Max Muller the structure of this goddess has been widely discussed. The texts identify her with the earth or even with the universe; she represents extension, breadth, freedom. 31 Very probably, Aditi was a Great Mother who, without being completely forgotten, had transmitted her qualities and her functions to her sons, the Adityas.
68. Indra, champion and demiurge
In the Rig Veda, Indra is the most popular god. Some 250 hymns are addressed to him, in comparison with 10 addressed to Varul)a, and 35 to Mitra, Varul)a, and the Adityas together. He is the hero without rival, paradigmatic model of warriors, redoubtable foe of the Dasyus or Dasas. His acolytes, the Maruts, reflect, on the mythological plane, the Indo-Iranian societies of young warriors (marya). But Indra is also demiurge and fecundator, personification of the exuberance of life, of cosmic and biological energy. Tireless consumer of soma, archetype of generative forces, he looses hurricanes, pours down rain, and commands all forms of wetness.32 The central myth of Indra, which is, furthermore, the most important myth in the Rig Veda, narrates his victorious battle against Vp:ra, the gigantic dragon who held back the waters in the "hollow of the mountains." Strengthened by soma, Indra lays the serpent low with his vajra ("thunderbolt"), the weapon forged by Tva~tr, splits open his head, and frees the waters, which pour into the sea "like bellowing cows" (RV 1. 32). The battle of a god against an ophidian or marine monster is well known to constitute a widespread mythological theme. We need only remember the struggle between Re and Apophis, between the Sumerian god Ninurta and Asag, Marduk and Tiamat, the Hittite storm god and the serpent Illuyankas, Zeus and Typhon, the Iranian hero Thraetaona and the three-headed dragon Azhi-dahaka. In certain cases (Marduk-Tiamat, for example) the god's victory

32. Indra is called sahasramu$ka, "with a thousand testicles" (RV 6. 46. 3); he is "the master of the fields" (RV 8. 21. 3) and "master of the earth" (Atharva Veda 12.1. 6), the fecundator of fields, animals, and women; see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 85.



206 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
constitutes the preliminary condition for the cosmogony. In other cases the stake is the inauguration of a new era or the establishment of a new sovereignty (cf. Zeus-Typhon, Baal-Yam). In short, it is by the slaying of an ophidian monster-symbol of the virtual, of "chaos," but also of the "autochthonous"-that a new cosmic or institutional "situation" comes into existence. A characteristic feature, and one common to all these myths, is the fright, or a first defeat, of the champion (Marduk and Re hesitate before fighting; at the outset, the serpent Illuyankas succeeds in mutilating the god; Typhon succeeds in cutting and carrying off Zeus's tendons). According to the Satapatha Briihmm;ta (1. 6. 3-17), Indra, on first seeing Vrtra, runs away as far as possible, and the Miirka1J.t/.eya Purii1J.a describes him as "sick with fear" and hoping for peace.33 It would serve no purpose to dwell on the naturalistic interpretations of this myth; the victory over Vrtra has been seen either as rain brought on by a thunderstorm or as the freeing of the mountain waters (Oldenberg) or as the triumphs of the sun over the cold that had "imprisoned" the waters by freezing them (Hillebrandt). Certainly, naturalistic elements are present, since the myth is multivalent; Indra's victory is equivalent, among other things, to the triumph of life over the sterility and death resulting from the immobilization of the waters by Vrtra. But the structure of the myth is cosmogonic. In Rig Veda 1. 33. 4 it is said that, by his victory, the god created the sun, the sky, and dawn. According to another hymn (RV 10.113.4-6), Indra, as soon as he was born, separated the Sky from the Earth, fixed the celestial vault, and, hurling the vajra, tore apart Vrtra, who was holding the waters captive in the darkness. Now, Sky and Earth are the parents of the gods (1. 185.6); Indra is the youngest (3.38. 1) and also the last god to be born, because he put an end to the hierogamy of Sky and Earth: "By his strength, he spread out these two worlds, Sky and Earth, and caused the sun to shine" (8.3.6). After this demiurgic feat, Indra appointed VaruI}.a
33. In fact he sent him messengers, who established "friendship" and "a pact" between them. Indra, however, broke the agreement by killing Vrtra by trickery, and this was his great sin; see DumeziI, Heur et malheur du
guerrier, pp. 71 if. (Eng. trans., The Destiny o/the Warrior, pp. 74 if.). Another feature peculiar to the Indian myth is that, after the murder, Indra is stricken with fear, flees to the ends of the earth, and, "assuming a minute form," hides
in a lotus (Mahiibhiirata 5. 9. 2 if.; this theme had already appeared in RV 1. 32.14).



Indra, champion and demiurge 207
cosmocrator and guardian of rta (which had remained concealed in the world below; 1. 62. 1). As we shall see (§ 75), there are other types of Indian cosmogonies that explain the creation of the world from a materia prima. This is not the case with the myth we have just summarized, for here a certain type of "world" already existed. For Sky and Earth were formed and had engendered the gods. Indra only separated the cosmic parents, and, by hurling the vajra at Vrtra, he put an end to the immobility, or even the "virtuality," symbolized by the dragon's mode of being.34 According to certain traditions, the" fashioner" of the gods, Tva~tr, whose role is not clear in the Rig Veda, had built himself a house and created Vrtra as a sort of roof, but also as walls, for his habitation. Inside this dwelling, encircled by Vrtra, Sky, Earth, and the Waters existed.35 Indra bursts asunder this primordial monad by breaking the "resistance" and inertia of Vrtra. In other words, the world and life could not come to birth except by the slaying of an amorphous Being. In countless variants, this myth is quite widespread, and in India itself we shall find it again in the dismemberment of Puru~a by the gods and in the self-sacrifice of Prajapati. However, Indra does not perform a sacrifice but, as a warrior, kills the paradigmatic adversary, the primordial dragon, incarnation of resistance and inertia. The myth is multivalent; side by side with its cosmogonic meaning there are naturalistic and historical valences. Indra's combat served as model for the battles that the Aryans had to sustain against the Dasyus (also termed vrtiiIJi): "He who triumphs in a battle, he truly kills Vrtra" (Maitriiyani-Sa1J1hitii 2. 1. 3). It is probable that in the early period the fight between Indra and Vrtra constituted the mythico-ritual scenario of the New Year festival, which insured the regeneration of the world. 36 If that god is at once tireless champion, demiurge, and epiphany of orgiastic forces and universal fertility, it

35. It has been Norman W. Brown in particular who has attempted to reconstruct this cosmological conception. 36. Kuiper, "The Ancient Aryan Verbal Contest," p. 269. The oratorical contests in Vedic India also reiterated the primordial struggle against the forces of resistance (Vrtol;li). The poet compares himself to Indra: "I am the murderer of my rivals, without wounds, safe and sound like Indra" (RV 10. 166. 2; cf.
Kuiper, pp. 251 ff.).



208 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
is because violence makes life spring up, increases it and regenerates it; but Indian speculation will very soon use this myth as an illustration of the divine biunity and, consequently, as an example of a hermeneutics seeking to unveil the ultimate reality.
69. Agni, chaplain of the gods: Sacrificial fire, light, and intelligence
The cult role of the domestic fire was already important in the IndoEuropean period. It certainly goes back to a prehistoric custom, which is also amply documented in a number of primitive societies. In the Veda, the god Agni supremely represents the sacrality of fire, but he does not submit to be limited by these cosmic and ritual hierophanies. He is the son of Dyaus (RV 1. 26. 10), just as his Iranian homologue, Atar, is the son of Ahura Mazda (Yasna 2. 12; etc.). He "is born" in the sky, from which he descends in the form of lightning, but he is also in water, in wood, in plants. He is further identified with the sun. Agni is described at once by his fiery epiphanies and by divine attributes that are peculiar to him. There is mention of his "flaming hair," his "golden jaw," the noise and terror that he produces (" When thou descendest on the trees like an eager bull, thy trail is black," RV 1. 58.4). He is the "messenger" between sky and earth, and it is through him that offerings reach the gods. But Agni is above all the archetype of the priest; he is called the sacrificer or the "chaplain" (purohita). This is why the hymns devoted to him are put at the beginning of the Rig Veda. The first hymn opens with this strophe: "I sing Agni, the chaplain, the god of sacrifice, the priest, the oblator who showers us with gifts" (after the translation by Jean Varenne). He is eternally young ("the god who does not grow old," RV 1. 52.2), for he is reborn with every new fire. As "master ofthe house" (grihaspati), Agni dispels darkness, drives away demons, and defends against sickness and sorcery. This is why men's relations with Agni are more intimate than with the other gods. It is he who "justly dispenses desirable goods" (1. 58. 3). He is invoked confidently: "Lead us, Agni, to riches by the right road ... spare us the fault that leads astray ... spare us sicknesses. Protect us always, Agni, with thy tireless guards.... Do not abandon us to the wicked



Agni, chaplain of the gods 209
man, the destroyer, the liar, or to misfortune" (1. 187. 1-5; after the translation by Jean Varenne).37 Although omnipresent in religious life-for the sacrificial fire plays a large part-Agni has no considerable mythology. Among the few myths that directly concern him, the most famous is that of Matarisvan, who had brought fire from the sky.38 On the cosmological plane, his role is apparently confused but important. On the one hand, he is called the "embryo of the Waters" (iipam garbhah, RV 3. 1. 12-13), and he is invoked as springing from the womb of the Waters, the Mothers (10.91. 6). On the other hand, he is held to have penetrated the primordial waters and to have fecundated them. This certainly involves an archaic cosmological conception: creation by the union of an igneous element (fire itself, heat, light, semen virile) with the aquatic principle (waters, virtualities, soma). Certain attributes of Agni (heat, golden color-for he is said to have a body of gold [RV 4.3. I]-spermatic and creative powers [10.20.9]) will be found again in the cosmogonic speCUlations elaborated around HiraI).ygarbha (the Golden Embryo) and Prajapati (§ 75). The hymns emphasize Agni's Jspiritual faculties: he is a r~i, endowed with great intelligence and clairvoyance. To estimate such speculations at their true value, we must take into account the innumerable images and symbols revealed by the "creative imagination" and meditations on the subject of fire, flames, heat. All this, in any case, constituted an inheritance that came down from prehistory. The Indian genius only elaborated, articulated, and systematized these immemorial discoveries. In later philosophical speculations we shall again find some of these primordial images connected with fire, for example in the concept of divine creative play (lilii) explained on the basis of the" play" of flames. As for the assimilation fire-(1ight)-intelligence, it is universally disseminated.39 It is here that we best gauge the importance of Agni in Indian religion and spirituality: he gave rise to countless cosmobiological meditations and speculations, he facilitated syntheses seeking the
37. Because of his role in the cremation of corpses, Agni is called" devourer of flesh" and is sometimes compared to the dog and the jackal. This is his only sinister aspect. 38. In other texts Agni is himself the messenger of Matarisvan; see J. Gonda, Les religions de I'Inde, vol. 1, p. 89.
39. Religious meditation on the sacrificial fire plays an important part in Zoroastrianism (see § 104).



210 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
reduction of multiple and different planes to a single fundamental principle. To be sure, Agni has not been the only Indian god to feed such reveries and reflections, but his place is in the first rank. As early as the Vedic period, he was already identified with tejas, "fiery energy, splendor, efficacy, majesty, supernatural power." In the hymns he is implored to bestow this power (AV 7. 89. 4).40 But the series of identifications, assimilations, and solidarizations-a process characteristic of Indian thought-is much greater. Agni, or one of his homologues, the Sun, is involved in the philosophoumena that seek to identify light with the iitman and the semen virile. By virtue of the rites and asceticisms that pursue the increase of "inner heat," Agni is equally bound up, though sometimes indirectly, with the religious valorization of "ascetic heat" (tapas) and some of the practices of Yoga.
70. The god Soma and the drink of "nondeath "
With the 120 hymns devoted to him, Soma appears as third in the Vedic pantheon. The entire ninth book of the Rig Veda is dedicated to Soma pavamiina-soma "in the process of clarification." Even more than in the case of Agni, it is not easy to separate the ritual reality-the plant and the drink-from the god who bears the same name. The myths are negligible. The most important of them relates the celestial origin of soma. An eagle, "flying up to the sky," hurled itself "with the swiftness of thought and forced the bronze fortress" (RV 8. 100.8). The bird seized the plant and brought it back to earth. But soma is held to grow in the mountains; 41 only a seeming contradiction is involved, however, for mountaintops belong to the transcendental world; they are already assimilated to the sky. Besides, other texts state that soma springs up "at the navel of the earth, on the mountains" (RV 10. 82. 3), that is, at the" center of the world," where passage between earth and sky becomes possible.42
40. See Gonda, "Gods" and" Powers," pp. 58 ff.
41. The epithet" Maujavata" indicates Mount Miijavat as the domain of soma (RV 10. 34. 1). Iranian tradition similarly localizes the plant haoma in the mountains (Yasna 10. 4; Yas! 9.17; etc.). 42. In the texts of the Yajur-Veda the sacrifice of Soma by the gods is frequently mentioned; only Mitra refused to take part in it, but he, too, was finally persuaded. Traces of an origin myth could be deciphered in this



The god Soma and the drink of" nondeath" 211
Soma has no attributes except the usual ones that are conferred on gods: he is clairvoyant, intelligent, wise, victorious, generous, etc. He is proclaimed the friend and protector of the other gods; first and foremost, he is the friend of Indra. He is also called King Soma, doubtless because of his ritual importance. His identification with the moon, which is unknown in the Avesta, is clearly documented only in the post-Vedic period. A number of details connected with the squeezing of the plant are described in terms that are at once cosmic and biological; the dull sound produced by the lower millstone is assimilated to thunder, the wool of the filter represents the clouds, the juice is the rain that makes vegetation come up, etc. The squeezing is also identified with sexual union. But all these symbols of biocosmic fertility finally depend on the" mystical" value of Soma. The texts emphasize the ceremonies that precede and accompany the purchase of the plant and, above all, the preparation of the drink. From the time of the Rig Veda the soma sacrifice was the most popular, "the soul and center of sacrifice" (Gonda). Whatever plant was used by the Indo-Aryans in the early centuries, it is certain that it was later replaced by other botanical species. Somalhaoma is the Indo-Iranian formula for the drink of "nondeath" (amrta); presumably it replaced the Indo-European drink madhu, "hydromel." All the virtues of soma are bound up with the ecstatic experience brought on by its ingestion. "We have drunk soma," says a famous hymn (RV 8. 48), "we have become immortal; arrived at light, we have found the Gods. What can the impiety or the malice of mortals do to us now, 0 immortal?" (strophe 3). Soma is implored to lengthen" our time to live"; for it is "the guardian of our body," and "weaknesses, sicknesses, have taken flight" (after the translation by L. Renou). Soma stimulates thought, revives the warrior's courage, increases sexual vigor, cures diseases. Drunk in common by priests and gods, it brings Earth close to the Sky, reinforces and lengthens life, insures fecundity. And in fact the ecstatic experience reveals at once the fullness of life, the sense of a limitless freedom, the possession of almost unsuspected physical and spiritual powers. From this comes the feeling of community with the gods, even of
episode: the creation of the "immortalizing" drink by the sacrifice of a primordial being. This first murder, performed by the gods, is indefinitely repeated in the ritual squeezing of the plant soma.



212 THE INDO-EUROPEANS. THE VEDIC GODS
belonging to the divine world, the certainty of "nondeath," that is, in the first place, of a plenitude of life that is indefinitely prolonged. Who is speaking in the famous hymn 10. 119, the god or the ecstatic who had just imbibed the sacred drink? "The five (human) tribes did not seem to me worth even a look-have I not drunk soma?" The personage enumerates his exploits: "I have dominated the sky with my stature, dominated the vast earth.... I shall strike this earth great blows.... I traced one of my wings in the sky, I traced the other here below.... I am great, great, I have propelled myself even up to the clouds-have I not drunk soma?" (after the translation by Renou).43 We will not stop to consider the surrogates and substitutes for the original plant in the cult. It is the role that these somic experiences play in Indian thought that is important. Very probably such experiences were confined to priests and a certain number of sacrificers. But they had considerable repercussions by virtue of the hymns that praised them and especially by virtue of the interpretations the hymns called forth. The revelation of a full and beatific existence, in communion with the gods, continued to haunt Indian spirituality long after the disappearance of the original drink. Hence the attempt was made to attain such an existence by the help of other means: asceticism or orgiastic excesses, meditation, the techniques of Yoga, mystical devotion. As we shall see (§ 79), archaic India knew several types of ecstatics. In addition, the quest for absolute freedom gave rise to a whole series of methods and philosophoumena that, in the last analysis, opened out into new perspectives and vistas, unsuspected in the Vedic period. In all these later developments, the god Soma played a not very prominent role; it is the cosmological and sacrificial principle that he signified which ended by preempting the attention of theologians and metaphysicians.
71. Two Great Gods in the Vedic period: Rudra-Siva and Vi~l}u
The Vedic texts also mention a certain number of other divinities. Most of them will gradually lose their importance and end by being forgotten, while others will finally attain an unequaled position.
43. "It seems that the hymn should be put in the mouth ofthe god Agni, who, in the course of a sacrifice, would have been asked by the poet to express the effects he experiences after drinking the divine liquid" (L. Renou, Hymnes specu/atifs du Veda, p. 252).



Two Vedic Great Gods: Rudra-Siva and Vi~Qu 213
Among the former we may mention the goddess of dawn, U~as, daughter of the Sky (Dyaus); Vayu, god of the wind and of its homologues, "breath" and the "cosmic soul"; Parjanya, god of storms and of the rainy season; Siirya and Savitr, solar divinities; Pii~an, ancient pastoral god but on the way to disappearing (he has almost no cult), guardian of roads and guide of the dead, who has been compared to Hermes; the twin Asvins (or Nasatyas), sons of Dyaus, heroes of many myths and legends that have given them a preponderant place in later literature; the Maruts, sons of Rudra, a troop of young men (marya), whom Stig Wikander has interpreted as the mythical model for a "men's society" ofthe Indo-European type. The second category is represented by Rudra-Siva and Vi~IJu. They occupy a small place in the Vedic texts, but in the classic period they will become Great Gods. In the Rig Veda, Vi~IJu appears as a divinity kindly disposed toward men (1. 186. 10), friend and ally of Indra, whom he helps in his battle against Vrtra, afterward stretching out the space between sky and earth (6.69.5). He crossed space in three strides, reaching, with the third, the abode of the gods (1. 155. 6). This myth inspires and justifies a rite in the BriihmaQas: Vi~IJu is identified with sacrifice (Satapatha Br. 14. 1. 1. 6); and the sacrificer, by ritually imitating his three strides, is assimilated to the god and attains the sky (1. 9. 3.9 ff.). Vi~IJu appears to symbolize at once limitless spatial extent (which makes the organization of the cosmos possible), the beneficient and omnipotent energy that exalts life, and the cosmic axis that steadies the world. The Rig Veda (7.99.2) states specifically that he supports the upper part of the universe.44 The BriihmaQas emphasize his relations with Prajapati, which are documented from the Vedic period. But it is not until later, in the Upanishads of the second category (contemporary with the Bhagavad Gitii, hence of about the fourth century B.C.), that Vi~IJu is exalted as a supreme god of monotheistic structure. We shall later dwell on this process, which is, furthermore, characteristic of Indian religious creativity. Morphologically, Rudra represents a divinity of the opposite type. He has no friends among the gods, and he does not love men, whom he terrorizes by his demonic fury and decimates by sicknesses and
44. See J. Gonda, Vi$l,luism and Sivaism, pp. 10 if. The sacrificial post, yiipa, belongs to him (the yupa is a replica of the axis mundi). See also Gonda,

disasters. Rudra wears his hair braided (RV 1. 114. 1. 5), and his color is dark brown (2. 33. 5); his belly is black and his back red. He is armed with bow and arrows, dressed in animal skins, and haunts the mountains, his favorite resort. He is associated with numerous demonic beings. Post-Vedic literature accentuates the god's maleficent nature. Rudra lives in forests and jungles, is called "Lord of Wild Beasts" (Sat. Br. 12. 7. 3.20), and protects those who shun the Aryan society. While the gods live in the East, Rudra lives in the North (Le., the Himalayas). He is excluded from the soma sacrifice and receives only offerings of food thrown on the ground (bali) or the remains of oblations or spoiled sacrificial offerings (Sat. Br. 1. 7. 4. 9). Epithets multiply: he is called Siva, "the gracious," Hara, "the destroyer," Shatp.kara, "the salutary," and Mahiideva, "the great god." According to the Vedic texts and the Briihma1)as, Rudra-Siva appears to be an epiphany of the demonic (or at least ambivalent) powers inhabiting wild, unpeopled places; he symbolizes all that is chaotic, dangerous, unforeseeable; he inspires fear, but his mysterious magic can also be directed toward beneficial ends (he is "physician of physicians "). There has been much discussion concerning the origin and original structure of Rudra-Siva, considered by some to be the god of death but also of fertility (Arbman), laden with nonAryan elements (Lommel), divinity of that mysterious class of ascetics, the vriityas (Hauer). The stages of the transformation of the Vedic Rudra-Siva into the Supreme God that he first proves to be in the Svetiisvatara-Upani~ad escape us. It seems certain that in the course of time Rudra-Siva assimilated-like most of the other godsa number of elements of "popular" religiosity, whether Aryan or non-Aryan. On the other hand, it would be risky to believe that the Vedic texts have brought us the "original structure" of Rudra-Siva. We must always remember that the Vedic hymns and the Brahmanic treatises were composed for an elite, the aristocracy and the priests, and that a considerable part of the religious life of the Aryan society was strictly ignored. However, the advancement of Siva to the rank of supreme god of Hinduism cannot be explained by his "origin," even if it was non-Aryan or popular. In him we have a creation whose originality we shall gauge when we analyze the Indian religious dialectic, as it appears in the continual reinterpretation and revalorization of myths, rites, and divine forms.

Gautama Buddha: From the Cosmic Sacrifice to the Supreme Identity Atman-Brahman
72. Morphology of the Vedic rituals
The Vedic cult had no sanctuary; the rites were performed either in the sacrificer's house or on a nearby piece of grassy ground, on which the three fires were placed. The nonflesh offerings were milk, butter, cereals, and cakes. Also sacrificed were the goat, the cow, the bull, the ram, and the horse. But from the period of the Rig Veda the soma sacrifice was considered the most important one. The rites fall into two classes: domestic (grhya) and solemn (sraula). The former, performed by the master of the house (grhapati), are justified by tradition (smrti, "memory"). In contrast, the solemn rites are usually performed by officiants.1 Their authority is based on direct revelation ("auditory," sruti) of eternal truth. Among the private rituals, aside from keeping up the domestic fire and the agricultural festivals, the most important are the sacraments or consecrations (samskiira) in connection with the conception and birth of children; the introduction (upanayana) of the boy to his Brahmanic preceptor; marriage; and funerals. These are all comparatively simple ceremonies, involving nonflesh oblations and offerings 2 and,
1. The number of officiants varies. The most important is the hotr or "pourer of the oblation" (cf. Avestan zaotar, "priest"); he later becomes the principal reciter. The adhvaryu bears the responsibility for the sacrifice: he moves about, keeps up the fires, manipulates the utensils, etc. The brahman, representative of the sacred power that his name designates (brahman, neuter), is the silent overseer of the cult; seated in the center of the area, true" physician of the sacrifice," he intervenes only if an error is made, when he performs the necessary expiation. The brahman receives half of the honorarium, which confirms his importance. 2. A part of the offerings, thrown into the fire, was transmitted to the gods by Agni. The rest was eaten by the officiants, who thus partook of a divine food.



216 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
for the sacraments, ritual gestures accompanied by formulas murmured by the master ofthe house. Of all the sacraments, the upanayana is certainly the most important. This rite constitutes the homologue of the puberty initiations typical of archaic societies. Atharva Veda 11. 5. 3, where the upanayana is first documented, states that the preceptor transforms the boy into an embryo and keeps him for three nights in his belly. The Satapatha Briihmal;za (11. 5. 4. 12-13) supplies the following details: the preceptor conceives at the moment when he puts his hand on the child's shoulder, and, on the third day, the child is reborn in the state of brahmanhood. The Atharva Veda (19. 17) calls him who has gone through the upanayana "twice-born" (dvi-ja), and this is the first appearance of the term, which is to enjoy an exceptional destiny. The second birth is evidently of a spiritual order, and the later texts emphasize this essential point. According to the Laws of Manu (2. 144), he who communicates the word of the Veda-that is, the brahman-to the novice must be regarded as mother and father; indeed, as between a boy's biological father and his Brahmanic preceptor, it is the latter who is the true father (2. 146); the true birth 3 -in other words, birth to immortality-is given by the siivitri formula (2. 148). During his whole period of study with his preceptor, the pupil (the brahmaciirin) is obliged to follow certain rules: to beg food for his master and himself, observe chastity, etc. The solemn rites make up liturgical systems that are of great, yet monotonous, complexity. The detailed description of a single system would take several hundred pages. It would be useless to attempt to summarize all the srauta sacrifices. The simplest, the agnihotra (" the oblation to fire "), takes place at dawn and twilight and consists in an offering of milk to Agni. There are also rites connected with the cosmic rhythms: the sacrifices called "of rain and of the new moon," seasonal ceremonies (ciiturmiisya), and first-fruits rites (iigrayana). But the essential sacrifices, specifically characteristic of the Vedic cult, are those of soma. The agnistoma ("praise of Agni") is performed once a year, in spring, and consists, aside from the preliminary operations, in three days of" homage" (upasad). Among the prelimi

Morphology of the Vedic rituals 217
nary operations, the most important is the dik$ii, which sanctifies the sacrificer by causing him to be reborn. The significance of this initiatory ritual will become clear further on. The soma is squeezed in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. At the midday squeezing there is a distribution of honorariums (diik$i1:zii): 7, 21, 60, or 1,000 cows, or, on occasion, the whole of the sacrificer's possessions. All the gods are invited, and they take part in the festival, first separately, then together.4 Other soma sacrifices are also known. Some are completed in a single day; others last for at least twelve days or, often, a year, and theoretically they can last for twelve years. In addition, there are ritual systems that were associated with the soma services, for example the mahiivrata (" great observance "), which includes music, dances, dramatic gestures, dialogues, and obscene scenes (one of the priests swings in a swing, a sexual union takes place, etc.). The vajapeya (" drink of victory") lasts from seventeen days to a year and constitutes an entire mythico-ritual scenario: a race between horses harnessed to seventeen chariots, the" ascent to the sun," performed by the sacrificer and his wife, who ceremonially climb the sacred post, etc. The royal consecration (riijasuya) was also incorporated into the somic sacrificial system. In this case, too, we find lively episodes (a simulated raid by the king on a herd of cows; the king plays dice with a priest and wins, etc.), but in essence the ritual is directed to the mystical rebirth of the sovereign (§ 74). Another ceremonial system was associated, though optionally, with the soma sacrifice: this is the agnicayana, the "piling up (of bricks for the altar) of fire." The texts state that "in former days" five victims were immolated, one of them a man. Their heads were then walled up in the first course of bricks. The preliminaries lasted for ,a year. The altar, built with 10,800 bricks piled up in five courses, sometimes took the form of a bird, symbol of the sacrificer's mystical ascent to heaven. The agnicayana gave rise to cosmogonic speculations that were decisive for Indian thought. The immolation of a man repeated the self-sacrifice of Prajiipati, and the building of the altar symbolized the creation ofthe universe (§ 75).
4. Another rite, pravargya, was early incorporated into the agnistoma, but
it probably constituted an autonomous ceremony, the purpose of which was to strengthen the sun after the rainy season. The interest of the pravargya lies especially in its having the characteristics of a "mystery" and also in the fact

73. The supreme sacrifices: aivamedha and puru~amedluz
The most important and most celebrated Vedic ritual was the "horse sacrifice," the asvamedha. It could be performed only by a victorious king, who thus gained the dignity of "Universal Sovereign." But the results of the sacrifice radiated over the entire kingdom; in fact, the asvamedha was held to cleanse pollutions and insure fecundity and prosperity throughout the country. The preliminary ceremonies were spaced out over a year, during which the stallion was left at liberty with a hundred other horses. Four hundred young 'men were on guard to keep it from approaching the mares. The ritual proper lasted for three days. On the second day, after some specific ceremonies (mares were shown to the stallion, it was harnessed to a chariot, the prince drove it to a pond, etc.), numerous domestic animals were immolated. Finally, the stallion, which thenceforth incarnated the god Prajapati ready to sacrifice himself, was suffocated. The four queens, each accompanied by a hundred female attendants, walked around the body, and the principal wife lay down beside it; covered with a cloak, she simulated sexual union. During this time the priests and the w<;>men exchanged obscene pleasantries. As soon as the queen rose, the horse and the other victims were cut up. The third day included other rituals, and finally the honorariums (diik~i1:lii) were distributed to the priests; they also received the four queens or their attendants. The horse satrifice is certainly of Indo-European origin. Traces of it are found among the Germans, the Iranians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Armenians, the Massagetae, the Dalmatians. But it is only in India that this mythico-ritual scenario has obtained so considerable a place in religious life and theological speculation. Probably the asvamedha was, in the beginning, a spring festival, more precisely a rite celebrated at the time of the New Year. Its structure includes cosmogonic elements. On the one hand, the horse is identified with the cosmos (= Prajapati) and its sacrifice symbolizes (that is, reproduces) the act of creation. On the other hand, the Rigvedic and Brahmanic texts emphasize the relations between the horse and the primordial waters. Now in India the waters represent the cosmo
that it offers the earliest illustration of piijii, i.e., the worship of a divinity symbolized in an icon. See J. A. van Buitenen, The Pravargya, pp. 25 ff., 38, and passim.



The supreme sacrifices: asvamedha and puru~amedha 219
gonic substance par excellence. But this complex rite also constitutes a "mystery" of the esoteric type. "Indeed, the asvamedha is all, and he who, being a Brahman, knows nothing of t~e asvamedha, knows nothing at all, he is not a Brahman, he deserves to be plundered" (Sat. Br. 13.4. 2. 17). The sacrifice is intended to regenerate the entire cosmos and, at the same time, to reestablish all the social classes and-all the vocations in their paradigmatic excellence.5 The horse, representative of the royal power (k$atrii), and further identified with Yama, Aditya (the sun), and Soma (that is, with the sovereign gods), is in a way a substitute for the king. Such processes of assimilation and substitution must be taken into account when we analyze a parallel scellario, the puru$amedha; and in fact the "sacrifice of a man" closely follows the asvamedha. In addition to the animal victims, a Brahman or a k$atrya, bought for the price of 1,000 cows and 100 horses, was sacrificed. He, too, was left free for a year, and, as soon as he was killed, the queen lay down beside his corpse. The puru$amedha was believed to obtain all that could be achieved by the asvamedha.
It has been asked if such a sacrifice was ever practiced. The puru$amedha is described in several srautasutras, but only the Siinkhiiyana and the Vaitiina prescribe the killing of the victim. In the other liturgical treatises, the man is released at the last moment, and an animal is immolated in his stead. It is significant that during the puru$amedha there is a recitation of the famous cosmogonic hymn Puru$asukta (Rig Veda 10. 90). The identification of the victim with Puru~a-Prajapati leads to the identification of the sacrificer with Prajapati. It has been shown that the mythico-ritual scenario of the puru$amedha has an astonishing parallel in Germanic tradition: wounded by a lance and hung on the World Tree for nine nights, Odin sacrifices "himself to himself" in order to obtain wisdom and to master magic (Hdvamdl 138).6 According to Adam of Bremen,
5. During the sacrifice a priest recites: "May the Brahman be born in holiness! ... May the prince be born in royal majesty, hero, archer, warrior with a strong bow, with invincible chariots. May the cow be born milk-giving, strong the draught bull, swift the horse, fecund the woman, victorious the soldier, eloquent the young man! May this sacrificer have a hero for his son! May Parjanya ever give us rain enough! May the wheat ripen abundantly for us!" (Viijasaneyi Sal'flhitii 22. 22).
6. See James L. Sauve, "The Divine Victim"; the author cites all the relevant passages from the Germanic and Sanskrit sources pertaining to human sacrifice.

who wrote in the eleventh century, this sacrifice was reactualized every nine years at Uppsala by hanging nine men and other animal victims. This Indo-European parallel gives plausibility to the hypothesis that the puru$amedha was literally carried out. But in India, where the practice and theory of sacrifice have been continually reinterpreted, the immolation of human victims ended by illustrating a metaphysics of the soteriological type.
74. Initiatory structure of rituals: Initiation (dik#i), royal consecration (riijasiiya)
For a better understanding of this process, it is important to clarify the initiatory presuppositions of the srauta rituals. An initiation implies the" death" and" rebirth" of the novice, that is, his birth to a higher mode of being. Ritual "death" is obtained by immolation or by a regressus ad uterum, both symbolic. The equivalence of these two methods implies the assimilation of "sacrificial death" to a "procreation." As the Satapatha Briihma1)a (11. 2. 1. 1) proclaims, "Man is born thrice: the first time of his parents, the second time when he sacrifices, ... the third time when he dies and is put on the fire, and thereupon he comes into existence once again." In reality, what is involved is a great number of "deaths," for every "twiceborn" performs a certain number of srauta sacrifices in his lifetime. Initiation, dik$ii, constitutes the indispensable preliminary to every somic sacrifice, but it is also practiced on other occasions.7 We repeat that the sacrificer who is receiving dik$ii is already twice-born by virtue of his upanayana, when he underwent the initiatory regressus ad uterum. Now the same return to the embryonic condition takes place during the dik$ii. In fact, "the priests transform into an embryo him to whom they give the dik$ii. They sprinkle him with water; water is the male seed.... They make him enter a special shed: the special shed is the womb of him who performs the dik$ii. They cover
7. Cf. Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 54 if.; Gonda, Change and Continuity,
pp. 315 if. The Rig Veda appears to know nothing of the dik~a, but we must not forget that these liturgical texts do not represent the Vedic religion in its entirety (see Gonda, p. 349). The ceremony is documented in the Atharva Veda 11. 5. 6, where the brahmacarin is called dik#ta, "he who performs the djk~a."



Initiation (dik§a), royal consecration (rajasuya) 221
him with a garment: the garment is the amnion.... He has his fists closed; and indeed the embryo has its fists closed as long as it is in the womb" (Aitareya BriihmalJa 1. 3). The parallel texts emphasize the embryological and obstetric character of the rite: "The dik$ita (i.e., he who performs the dik$ii) is semen" (Maitriiyani-Sarrzhitii 3. 6. 1); "The dik$ita is an embryo, his garment is the chorion" (TaittiryaSa1?'l. 1. 3. 2). The reason for this regressus ad uterum is continually recalled: "Man is in truth not born. It is through the sacrifice that he comes to birth" (Mait.-Sarrz. 3. 6. 7).8 This new, mystical birth, which is repeated at each sacrifice, makes possible the assimilation of the sacrificer to the gods. "The sacrificer is destined really to be born in the celestial world" (Sat. Br. 7.3. 1. 12). "He who is initiated approaches the gods and becomes one of them" (ibid. 3. 1. 1. 8). The same treatise affirms that the sacrificer in the process of being born anew must stand facing the four directions of space, i.e., he must master the universe (7. 7. 2. 11 ff.). But the dik~ii is also identified with death. "When he initiates himself, he (the sacrificer) dies for the second time" (Jaim. Upani~ad Briih. 3. 11. 3).9 According to other sources, the "dik$ita is the oblation" (Taitt. Sa1?'lhitii 6. 1. 45), for "the victim is really the sacrificer himself" (Ait. Briih.2. 11). In short, "the initiate is the oblation offered to the gods" (Sat. Br. 3. 6. 3. 19).10 The example was given by the gods: "0 Agni, sacrifice thine own body!" (Rig Veda 6. 11. 2); "Sacrifice thyself, increasing thy body!" (10. 81. 5). For it is "by sacrifice that the gods offered the Sacrifice" (10. 90. 16). A ritual death, then, is the preliminary condition for attaining to the presence of the gods and, at the same time, for obtaining a full life in this world. In the Vedic period, "divinization," which was obtained, though in any case only momentarily, through sacrifice, implied no devalorization of life and human existence. On the contrary, it was by such ritual ascents to heaven, and into the
8. All these initiation rites naturally have a mythical model: it is Indra who, to prevent the birth of a terrifying monster as the result of the union of the Word (Vae) with Sacrifice (Yajiia), changed himself into an embryo and entered Viic's womb (Sat. Br. 3. 2. 1. 18 fr.). 9. Cf. also the texts cited by Gonda, Change and Continuity, p. 385. to. The sacrificer "throws himself in the form of seed" (represented by grains of sand) into the domestic fire, in order to insure his rebirth here below on earth, and into the sacrificial altar in view of a rebirth in heaven; see the texts cited by A. Coomaraswamy, "Atmayajfia: Self-Sacrifice," p. 360.



222 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
presence of the gods, that the sacrificer, together with both the whole society and nature, was blessed and regenerated. We have seen what results were obtained as the effect of an asvamedha sacrifice (see above, note 5). Probably cosmic regeneration and reinforcement of the royal power were also the purpose of the human sacrifices practiced in pagan Uppsala. But all this was obtained by rites that, intending a repetition of the creation, included at once the "death," the "embryonic gestation," and the "rebirth" of the sacrificer. The consecration of the Indian king-the rajasuya---comprised a similar scenario. The central ceremonies took place around the New Year. The anointing was preceded by a year of dik$a and was usually followed by another year of closing ceremonies. The rajasuya is in all likelihood a shortened version of a series of annual ceremonies intended to restore the universe. The king had a central role because, like the srauta sacrificer, he in some sense incorporated the cosmos. The different phases of the rite successively brought about the future sovereign's regressi_on to the embryonic state, his gestation for a year, and his mystical rebirth as cosmocrator, identified both with Prajapati and with the cosmos. The "embryonic period" of the future sovereign corresponded to the process of maturation of the universe and, very probably, was originally related to the maturing of crops. The second phase of the ritual completed the formation of the sovereign's new body: a symbolic body, which was obtained either as the result of the king's mystical marriage with the Brahman caste or with the people (a marriage that allowed him to be born from their womb) or as the result of the union of the male waters with the female waters or of the union of gold-signifying fire-with water. The third phase was made up of a series of rites by virtue of which the king gained sovereignty over the three worlds; in other words, he incarnated the cosmos and, at the same time, established himself as cosmocrator. When the sovereign raises his arm, the gesture has a cosmogonic meaning: it symbolizes the erection of the axis mundi. When the king is anointed, he stands on the throne with his arms raised: he incarnates the cosmic axis fixed in the navel of the earththat is, the throne, the" center of the world"-and touches heaven. The aspersion is connected with the primordial waters that descend from heaven along the axis mundi-represented by the king-to fertilize the earth. Then the king takes a step toward each of the four cardinal points and symbolically ascends to the zenith. In consequence



Cosmogonies and metaphysics 223
of these rites the king acquires sovereignty over the four directions of space and over the seasons; in other words, he masters the whole of the spatiotemporal universe.11 The intimate connection between ritual death and ritual rebirth on the one hand, and between cosmogony and regeneration of the world on the other, has been noted. All these ideas are bound up with cosmogonic myths that we shall discuss III a moment. They will be elaborated and articulated by the authors of the Briihmaf)as from their particular point of view, especially their inordinate exaltation of sacrifice.
75. Cosmogonies and metaphysics
Directly or by way of allusion, the Vedic hymns present serveral cosmogonies. These myths are more or less widespread and documented on various levels of culture. It would be useless to seek the origin of each of these cosmogonies. Even those that we may assume to have been brought by the Aryans have parallels in earlier or more primitive cultures. The cosmologies, like so many other religious ideas and beliefs, represent a heritage transmitted from prehistory everywhere in the ancient world. What is of importance for our purpose is the Indian interpretations and revalorizations of certain cosmogonic myths. It should be remembered that the antiquity of a cosmogony must not be judged from the earliest documents that present it. One of the most archaic and most widespread myths, the "cosmic dive," becomes popular in India comparatively late, especially in the Epic and the Pura1).as. Essentially, four types of cosmogonies seem to have fascinated the Vedic poets and theologians. They may be designated as follows: (l) creation by fecundation of the original waters; (2) creation by the dismembering of a primordial giant, Puru~a; (3) creation out of a unity-totality, at once being and nonbeing; (4) creation by the separation of heaven and earth. In the celebrated hymn of the Rig Veda 10.121, the god imagined as Hira1).yagarbha (the Golden Embryo) hovers over the Waters; by entering them, he fecundates the Waters, which give birth to the god
11. See J. C. Heesterman, The Ancient Indian Royal Consecration, pp. 17 if.,
52 if., 101 if.



224 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
of fire, Agni (strophe 7). The Atharva Veda (10. 7. 28) identifies the Golden Embryo with the Cosmic Pillar, skambha. Rig Veda 10. 82. 5 relates the first germ that the Waters received to the Universal Artisan, Visvakarman, but the image of the embryo is not congruous with this divine personage, the supreme jack-of-all-trades. In these examples we have to do with variants of an original myth, which presented the Golden Embryo as the seed of the creator god fiying above the primitive Waters.12 The second cosmogonic theme, radically reinterpreted from a ritualistic point of view, is found in an equally famous hymn, the Puru~asUkta (RV 10.90). The primordial giant Puru~a (the "Man") is represented at once as cosmic totality (strophes 1-4) and as an androgynous being. And indeed (strophe 5) Puru~a engenders the creative female energy, Viraj, and then is borne by her.13 Creation proper is the result of a cosmic sacrifice. The gods sacrifice the "Man": from his dismembered body proceed the animals, the liturgical elements, the social classes, the earth, the sky, the gods: "His mouth became the Brahman, the Warrior was the product of his arms, his thighs were the Artisan, from his feet was born the Servant" (strophe 12, after the translation by Renou). The sky came from his head, the earth from his feet, the moon from his consciousness, the sun from his gaze, Indra and Agni from his mouth, the wind from his breath, etc. (strophes 13-14). The paradigmatic function of this sacrifice is emphasized in the last strophe (16): "The gods sacrificed the sacrifice by the sacrifice"; in other words, Puru~a was at once sacrificial victim and divinity of the sacrifice. The hymn clearly states that Puru~a precedes and surpasses the creation, though the cosmos, life, and men proceed from his own body. In other words, Purusa is at once transcendent and immanent, a paradoxical mode of being but one that is typical of the Indian cosmogonic gods (cf. Prajapati). The myth, parallels to which are found in China (P'an-ku), among the ancient Germans (Ymir), and in Mesopotamia (Tiamat), illustrates a cosmogony of an archaic type: creation by the sacrifice of an anthropomorphic divine being.
12. The image of the Golden Embryo will become, in classical India, the cosmic egg engendered by the waters (already in the Upanishads: Kiitha Up. 4.6; Svetiisvatara 3. 4. 12).
13. Viraj is a kind of Sakti. In the Brhadiira"yaka Up. 4. 2. 3 she marries Puru~a.



Cosmogonies and metaphysics 225
The Puru~asukta has given rise to countless speculations. But just as, in archaic societies, the myth serves as the paradigmatic model for all kinds of creation, so this hymn is recited in one of the rites that follow the birth of a son, in the ceremonies for the foundation of a temple (built, furthermore, in the likeness of Puru~a), and in the purificatory rites of renewalY In the most famous hymn ofthe Rig Veda (10. 129) the cosmogony is presented as a metaphysics. The poet asks himself how Being could have come out of non-Being, since, in the beginning, neither "non-Being existed, nor Being" (strophe 1. 1). "In that time there existed neither death nor nondeath" (that is, neither men nor gods). There was only the undifferentiated principle called" One" (neuter). "The One breathed from its own impulse, without there being any breath." Aside from that, "nothing else existed" (str. 2). "In the beginning, darkness was hidden by darkness," but heat (generated by asceticism, tapas) gave birth to the "One," "potential" (abhu)i.e., "embryo"-" covered with emptiness" (we may understand: surrounded by the primitive waters). From this germ ("potential") develops Desire (kama), and it is this same Desire that "was the first seed (retas) of Consciousness (manas)," an astonishing assertion, which anticipates one of the chief theses of Indian philosophical thought. The poets, by their reflection, "were able to discover the place of Being in non-Being" (str. 4). The "first seed" then divided itself into "high" and "low," into a male principle and a female principle (cf. RV 10. 72. 4). But the enigma of the "secondary creation," that is, of the phenomenal creation, remains. The gods are born afterward (str. 6), hence they are not the authors of the creation of the world. The poet concludes with a question mark: "He who oversees this (world) in the highest firmament alone knows it (i.e., knows the origin of the 'secondary creation ')-unless he does not know it?" The hymn represents the highest point attained by Vedic speculation. The axiom of an unknowable supreme being-the "One,"15 the "That"-transcending both the gods and creation, will be developed in the Upanishads and in certain philosophical systems.
14. See the references to the texts in Gonda, Vi~1)uism and Sivaism, p. 27. 15. In the Rig Veda a tendency is already observable to reduce the plurality of the gods to a single divine principle: "what is only One, the inspired poets call many" (1. 164.46).



226 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
Like the Puru~a of Rig Veda 10. 90, the One precedes the universe and creates the world by emanation from its own being, without thereby losing its transcendence. This idea should be kept firmly in mind, since it is fundamental for later Indian speculation: both consciousness and the universe are the product of procreative desire (ktima). One of the germs of the SaI!1khya-Yoga philosophy and of Buddhism is to be seen here. As for the fourth cosmogonic theme (the separation of heaven and earth, or the dissection of Vrtra by Indra), this myth is related to the Puru$asitkta; in both there is the violent division of a totality for the purpose of creating (or renewing) the world. The theme is archaic and capable of surprising reinterpretations and applications. As we have seen (§ 68), Indra's demiurgic act of striking down and dismembering the primordial dragon serves as the model for acts as different as building a house or an oratorical competition. Finally, we will cite creation by a divine being, the Universal Artisan, Visvakarman (RV 10.81), who fashions the world like a sculptor, a smith, or a carpenter. But this mythical motif, famous in other religions, is connected by the Vedic poets with the theme, made famous by the Puru$asitkta, of the creation-sacrifice. The multiplicity of cosmogonies is paralleled by the manifold traditions concerning the theogony and the origin of man. According to the Rig Veda, the gods were engendered by the primordial couple Heaven and Earth, or they emerged from the original mass of the waters or from non-Being. In any case, they came into existence after the creation of the world. A late hymn (RV 10. 63. 2) relates that the gods were born of the goddess Aditi, the Waters, and the Earth. But they were not all immortal. The Rig Veda adds that they received this gift from Savitri (4.54.2) or from Agni (6. 7. 4) or from drinking soma (9. 106. 8). Indra obtained immortality by asceticism, tapas (10. 167. I), and the Atharva Veda declares that all the other gods gained it in the same way (11. 5. 19; 4. II. 6). According to the Briihma1;las, it was by performing certain sacrifices that the gods became immortal. Men, too, descend from the primordial couple Heaven-Earth. Their mythical ancestor is Manu, son of the god Vivasvat, the first sacrificer and the first man (RV 10.63. 7). Another version makes man's mythical parents the children of Vivasvat, Yama and his sister Yami (10. 10). Finally, as we have just seen, the Puru$asitkta (10. 90.



The doctrine of sacrifice in the BrahmaI}.as 227
12) explains the origin of men (that is, the four social classes) as being from the organs of the sacrificial primordial giant. In the beginning, men, too, could become immortal through sacrifice; but the gods decided that this immortality should be purely spiritual, that is, accessible to human beings only after death (Satapatha Br. 10.4.3. 9). There are other mythological explanations for the origin of death. In the Mahabhiirata, death is introduced by Brahma in order to relieve the earth, burdened by a human mass that threatened to make it fall into the ocean (6. 52-54; 12.256-58). Some of these myths concerning the birth of the gods and men, the loss or conquest of immortality, are found among other IndoEuropean peoples. In any case, similar myths are documented in many traditional cultures. However, it is only in India that these myths have given rise to sacrificial techniques, contemplative methods, and speculations so decisive for the awakening of a new religious consciousness.
76. The doctrine of sacrifice in the Briihmaflas
The Puru$asukta is the point of departure and the doctrinal justification for the theory of sacrifice elaborated in the Brahmal)as (ca. 1000-800 B.C.). Just as Puru~a gave himself to the gods and let himself be immolated so that the universe could be created, Prajapati will suffer lethal "exhaustion" after his cosmogonic labor. As the Brahmal)as present him, Prajapati appears to be a creation of learned speculation, but his structure is archaic. This Lord of Creatures is close to the cosmic Great Gods. He in a way resembles both the "One" of Rig Veda 10. 129 and Visvakarman, but, especially, he continues Puru~a. Besides, the identity Puru~a-Prajapati is documented by the texts: "Puru~a is Prajapati; Puru~a is the Year" (Jaim. Br. 2. 56; cf. Satapatha Br. 6. 1. 1. 5). In the beginning, Prajapati was the nonmanifested Unity-Totality, a purely spiritual presence. But desire (kama) incited him to multiply and reproduce himself (Sat. Br. 6. 1. 1). He "heated" himself to an extreme degree by asceticism (tapas, literally, "heat, ardor") and created by emanation ;16 we may understand this to mean by sweating, as in
16. The term used is visrj, from the root srj, "to protect"; vi- indicates dispersal in all directions.



228 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
certain primitive cosmogonies, or by seminal emission. He first created the brahman, that is, the Threefold Knowledge (the three Vedas); then he created the Waters from the Word. Desiring to reproduce himself by the Waters, he penetrated them; an egg developed, whose shell became the earth. Then the gods were created to people the heavens and the Asuras to people the earth, etc. (ibid. 11. 1. 6. 1 ff.)Y
Prajapati thought: "Truly, I have created a pendant to myself, that is, the Year." This is why it is said: "Prajapati is the Year" (ibid. 11. 1. 6. 13). By giving his own self (iitman) to the gods, he created another pendant to himself, that is, sacrifice, and that is why people say: "Sacrifice is Prajapati." It is further stated that the joints (parvam) of Prajapati's cosmic body are the five seasons of the year and the five courses of the fire altar (ibid. 6. 1. 2). This triple identification of Prajapati with the universe, with cyclic time (the year), and with the fire altar constitutes the great novelty of the Brahmanic theory of sacrifice. It marks the decline of the conception that was the informing spirit of the Vedic ritual and prepares the discoveries achieved by the authors of the Upanishads. The fundamental idea is that, in creating by "heating" and by repeated "emissions," Prajapati consumes himself and ends by becoming exhausted. The two key terms-tapas (ascetic ardor) and visrj (dispersed emission)-can have indirect or implied sexual connotations, for asceticism and sexuality are intimately connected in Indian religious thought. The myth and its images translate the cosmogony into biological terms; their own mode of being brings it about that the world and life exhaust themselves by their very duration.18 Prajapati's exhaustion is expressed in striking images: "After Prajapati had emitted the living beings, his joints were disjointed. Now Prajapati is certainly the Year, and his joints are the two joinings of day and night (that is, dawn and twilight), the full moon and the new moon, and the beginnings of the seasons. He was unable to rise with his joints loosened; and the gods cured him by (the ritual of) the agnihotra, strengthening his joints" (Sat. Br. 1. 6. 3.
17. Other texts state that heaven proceeded from his head, the atmosphere from his chest, and the earth from his feet (see Gonda, Les religions de I'Inde, vol. 1, p. 226). There is certainly influence here from the sacrifice of Puru~a-but it confirms the structural analogy of these two gods. 18. Similar conceptions are known to be characteristic of the archaic cultures, especially those of the paleocultivators.



Eschatology 229
35-36). In other terms, the reconstitution and rearticulation of Prajapati's cosmic body are effected by sacrifice, that is, by building a sacrificial altar in order to celebrate the agnicayana (§ 72). The same work (10. 4. 2. 2) adds that "This Prajapati, the Year, is made up of 720 days and nights; that is why the altar comprises 360 enclosing stones and 360 bricks." "This Prajapati who became disjointed is (now) the same fire altar built formerly." The priests restore Prajapati, "reassemble" (sarrzskri) him, by laying the courses of bricks that make up the altar. In short, every sacrifice repeats the primordial act of creation and guarantees the continuity of the world for the following year.
This is the original sense of sacrifice in the BriihmafJ,as: to recreate the cosmos that has been" disjointed," "exhausted" by cyclic time (the year). Through sacrifice-that is, by the continued activity of the priests-the world is kept alive, well integrated, and fertile. It is a new application of the archaic idea that demands the annual (or periodical) repetition of the cosmogony. It is also the justification for the pride of the Brahmans, convinced of the decisive importance of rites. For "the sun would not rise if the priest, at dawn, did not offer the oblation of fire" (Sat. Br. 2. 3. 1. 5). In the BriihmafJ,as the Vedic gods are ignored or are subordinated to the magical and creative powers of sacrifice. It is proclaimed that, in the beginning, the gods were mortal (Taitt. Sarrz. 8. 4. 2. I; etc.); they became divine and immortal through sacrifice (ibid. 6.3.4.7; 6. 3. 10. 2; etc.). From then on, everything is concentrated in the mysterious power of rite: the origin and essence of the gods, sacred power, knowledge, well-being in this world, and "nondeath" in the other. But sacrifice must be performed correctly and with faith; the least doubt of its efficacy can have disastrous consequences. In order to illustrate this ritual doctrine, which is at once a cosmogony, a theogony, and a soteriology, the authors of the BriihmafJ,as multiply myths or fragments of myths, reinterpreting them in accordance with the new point of view or inventing new ones on the basis of some fanciful etymology, a learned allusion, or an enigma.
77. Eschatology: Identification with Prajapati through sacrifice
Yet a new idea very soon appears: sacrifice not only restores Prajapati and insures the perpetuation of the world but is capable of



230 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
creating a spiritual and indestructible being, the "person," the atman. Sacrifice has not only a cosmogonic intent and an eschatological function but makes it possible to obtain a new mode of being. In building the fire altar (agnicayana) the sacrificer identifies himself with Prajapati; more precisely, Prajapati and the sacrificer are identified in the ritual act itself: the altar is Prajapati, and, at the same time, the sacrificer becomes the altar. By the magical power of the rite, the sacrificer builds a new body for himself, ascends to heaven, where he is born a second time (Sat. Br. 7.3. 1. 12), and obtains "immortality" (10.2.6.8). This means that after death he will return to life, to "nondeath," a modality of existence that goes beyond time. What is of the first importance-and this is the purpose of the rite-is to be "complete" (sarva), "integral," and to preserve this condition after death.19 By "reassembling" (samdha, salllskri) Prajapati, the sacrificer performs the same operation of integration and unification on his own person; in other words, he becomes "complete." Just as, through the sacrifice, the god recovers his person (atman), the sacrificer builds his own self, his iitman, for himself (Kau$itaki Brahma1)a 3. 8). The "fabrication" of the atman resembles in some sense the reunification of Prajapati, scattered and exhausted by his cosmogonic labor. The totality of ritual acts (karma), when it is achieved and well integrated, constitutes the "person," the atman. This means that, through ritual activity, the psychophysiological functions of the sacrificer are brought together and unified; their sum constitutes the iitman (Aitareya Br. 2.40. 1-7); it is by virtue of his iitman that the sacrificer becomes "immortal." The gods, too, attained to immortality by sacrifice, obtaining brahman (Sat. Br. 11. 2. 3. 6). Consequently, brahman and atman are implicitly identified, even as early as the period of the Brahma1)as.2o This is confirmed by another series of identifications: both Prajapati and the fire altar are assimilated to the Rig Veda, and the syllables of the Rig are identified with the bricks of the altar. But since brahman is, itself, also assimilated to the 432,000 syllables of the Rig, it follows that it is also identified with Prajapati and, in the last analysis, with the sacrificer, that is, with his atman.21

Eschatology 231
If Prajapati (Brahman) and atman are identical, it is because they are the result of one and the same activity (" reconstruction," unification), though the materials are different: the bricks of the altar for Prajapati-Brahman, the organic and psychomental functions for the iitman. 22 But it is important to emphasize that it is a cosmogonic myth that, in the last analysis, constitutes the paradigmatic model for the "construction" of the iitman. The various Yogic techniques apply the same principle: "concentration" and "unification" of the bodily positions, of the breaths, of psychomental activity. The discovery of the identity of the self (iitman) and brahman will be tirelessly exploited and variously valorized in the Upanishads (§ 80). For the moment we will add that, in the Briihmaf),as, brahman designates the process of the cosmic sacrifice and, by extension, the mysterious power that maintains the universe. But already in the Vedas brahman was thought to be, and was expressly called, the imperishable, the immutable, the foundation, the principle of all existence. It is significant that in several hymns of the Atharva Veda (e.g., 10. 7. 8) brahman is identified with the skambha (literally, "stay, support, pillar "); in other words, brahman sustains the world, for it is at once cosmic axis and ontological foundation. "In the skambha is all that is possessed by. the spirit (atmanvat), all that breathes" (Atharva Veda 7. 8.2). "He who knows the brahman in man knows the supreme being (parame#hin, the Lord), and he who knows the supreme being knows the skambha" (ibid. 10.8.43). We perceive the effort to isolate the ultimate reality: brahman is recognized as the "pillar of the universe," the support, the base; and the termprati$fhii, which expresses all these notions, is already frequently used in the Vedic texts. The Brahman is identified with brahman because he knows the structure and origin of the universe, because he knows the Word that expresses all that; for Vac, the Logos, can transform any person into a Brahman (already Rig Veda 10. 124.5). "The birth of
"golden Puru~a" in the heart of man as a grain of rice or millet-adding, however, that it is greater than heaven, greater than the ether, than the earth, and than all things: "this self of the Spirit is my self; when I die, I shall obtain this self." The text is important, since, on the one hand, Puru~a is identified with brahman (neuter), and, on the other, the equation atman-brahman is already assured.
22. See Silburn, Instant et cause, pp. 104 if.



232 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
the Brahman is an eternal incarnation of the dharma" (Manu 1.98).23 A particular category of works, the AralJyakas (literally, "of the forest "), allows us to follow the transition of the sacrificial system (karma-kalJ(la) of the BriihmalJas to the primacy of metaphysical knowledge (jfiiina-kalJ(la) proclaimed by the Upanishads. The AralJyakas were taught in secret, far from villages, in the forest. Their doctrines emphasize the self, subject of the sacrifice, instead of the concrete reality of the rites. According to the AralJyakas, the gods are hidden in man; in other words, the correlation macrocosmmicrocosm, the basis of Vedic speculation, now reveals the homology between the cosmic divinities and those present in the human body (see Aitareya AralJyaka 1. 3. 8; 2. 1. 2; 3. 1. 1; etc. SiilJkhiiyana AralJyaka 7.2 ff.; etc.). Consequently, the "interiorization of sacrifice" (cf. § 78) makes it possible to direct the offerings at once to the "interior" and the "exterior" gods. The ultimate aim is union (sal'flhitii) between the different theocosmic planes and the organs and psychophysiological functions of man. After a number of homologizations and identifications, the conclusion is reached that "consciousness of self (prajfiiitman) is one and the same thing as the Sun" (A it. Ar. 3. 2. 3; SiilJkh. Ar. 8. 3-7). This daring equation will be elaborated and articulated by the authors ofthe Upanishads.
78. Tapas: Technique and dialectic of austerities
We have several times referred to asceticism, tapas, for it is impossible to discuss the most important Indian gods, myths, and rites without mentioning this ritual "heating," this "warmth" or "ardor" obtained through austerities. The term tapas, from the root tap, "to heat," "to be boiling," is clearly documented in the Rig Veda (see, for example, 8.59.6; 10. 136.2; 154.2.4; 167. 1; 109.4; etc.). The concept belongs to an Indo-European tradition, for, in a parallel context, "extreme heat" or "rage" (menos, juror, jerg, wut) plays a part in rituals of the heroic type.24 We add that "heating" by

Tapas: Technique and dialectic of austerities 233
various psychophysiological techniques, and even by a highly spiced diet, is documented among the medicine men and magicians of primitive cultures.25 Obtaining magico-religious "power" is accompanied by a strong inner heat; this power itself is expressed by terms that mean "heat," "burning," "very hot," etc. We have cited these facts in order to bring out the archaism and the considerable dissemination of austerities of the tapas type. This in no way implies a non-Aryan origin of Indian asceticism. The IndoEuropeans, and especially the Vedic Indians, had inherited prehistoric techniques, which they had valorized in different ways. But it must be made clear at this point that ritual "heating" nowhere else obtained the scope that tapas was to acquire in India, from the most ancient times down to our own day. Ascetic" heating" has its model, or its homologue, in the images, symbols, and myths connected with the heat that" cooks" crops and broods eggs to insure their hatching, with sexual excitement, especially the ardor of orgasm, and with fire lighted by rubbing two sticks together. Tapas is "creative" on several planes: cosmogonic, religious, metaphysical. Prajapati, as we saw, creates the world by "heating" himself through tapas, and the exhaustion that follows is assimilable to sexual fatigue (§ 76). On the plane of ritual, tapas makes" rebirth" possible-that is, passage from this world into the world of the gods, from the sphere of the "profane" to that of the "sacred." In addition, asceticism helps the contemplative to "brood" the mysteries of esoteric knowledge and gives him a revelation of profound truths. (Agni gives the tapasvin "heat of the head," thus making him clairvoyant.) Asceticism radically modifies the mode of being of the practitioner, for it bestows on him a superhuman "power" that can become terrible and in certain cases" demonic." 26 The preliminaries for the most important sacrifices, the initiation ceremony, the brahmaciirin's apprenticeship all involved tapas. Essentially, tapas is produced by fasting, by keeping watch before a fire, by standing in the sun, or, more rarely, by absorbing intoxicating substances. But "heating" is

26. The term santi, which in Sanskrit designates tranquillity, peace of soul, absence of passion, relief from sufferings, derives from the root sam, which originally included the meaning of "extinguishing" fire, anger, fever-in the last analysis the heat provoked by demonic powers; see D. J. Hoens, Stinti, esp. pp. 177 ff.



234 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
also obtained by holding the breath, which opens the way for a daring homologization of the Vedic ritual with the practices of Yoga. This homologization was made possible principally by the speculations on sacrifice in the Briihmm;zas. Sacrifice was early assimilated to tapas. It is proclaimed that the gods obtained immortality not only through sacrifice (§ 76) but also through asceticism. If in the Vedic cult the gods are offered soma, melted butter, and the sacred fire, in ascetic practice they are offered an "inner sacrifice," in which the physiological functions take the place of libations and ritual objects. Respiration is often identified with an "uninterrupted libation." 27 There is mention of the priilJiigniholra, that is, of "the oblation to fire accomplished by respiration" (Vaikhiinasasmiirtasutra 2. 18). The conception of this inner sacrifice is an innovation fraught with consequences; it will permit even the most eccentric ascetics and mystics to remain in the fold of Brahmanism and, later, of Hinduism. But then, too, the same inner sacrifice will be practiced by the Brahmans who are" dwellers in the forest," that is, by those who live as ascetics (sannyiisi) without thereby losing their social identity of "householders." 28 In short, tapas is integrated into a series of homologizations effected on different planes. On the one hand-and in conformity with the distinctive tendency of the Indian spirit-the cosmic structures and phenomena are assimilated to the organs and functions of the human body and, in addition, to the elements of sacrifice (altar, fire, oblations, ritual instruments, liturgical formulas, etc.). On the other hand, asceticism-which implied (already in prehistoric times) a whole system of micro-macrocosmic correspondences (the breaths assimilated to the winds, etc.)-is homologized to the sacrifice. Certain forms of asceticism, for example holding the
27. In fact, "as long as he speaks, man cannot breathe, and then he offers his breathing to speech; as long as he breathes, he cannot speak, and then he offers his speech to breathing. These are the two continual and immortal oblations; in waking and in sleep, man offers them uninterruptedly. All other oblations have an end and share in the nature of the act (karman). The men of old, knowing this true sacrifice, did not offer the agnihotra" (Kau$itiikiBriihma1:w Upani~ad 2. 5). According to the Chiindogya Up. 5. 19-24, the true sacrifice consists in the oblations to the breaths: "he who offers the agnihotra without knowing this is like him who ... should make the offering in the ashes" (5. 24. 1). 28. Their religious position is reflected (though rather obscurely) in the Ara1Jyaka treatises.



Ascetics and ecstatics: Muni, vnltya 235
breath, are even considered superior to sacrifice; their results are declared to be more precious than the "fruits" of sacrifice. But all these homologizations and assimilations are valid, that is, become real and religiously efficacious, only if the dialectic that has revealed them is understood. In the last analysis, we have to do with a number of systems that are, on the one hand, homologized and, on the other hand, classified in a variable hierarchical series. Sacrifice is assimilated to asceticism, but, after a certain moment, what counts most is understanding the principle that justifies such assimilations. Very soon, with the Upanishads, comprehension, knowledge Ufiiina), will be raised to a preeminent rank, and the sacrificial system, with the mythological theology that it implied, will lose its primacy in religion. But this system too, based on the superiority of" comprehension," will fail to maintain its supremacy, at least for certain segments of society. The yogins, for example, will accord decisive importance to asceticism and experimentation with mystical states; certain ecstatics or partisans of devotion of the theistic type (bhakti) will reject, wholly or in part, not only Brahmanic ritualism and the metaphysical speculation of the Upanishads but also asceticism (tapas) and the technique of Yoga. This dialectic, with its capability of discovering countless homologies, assimilations, and correspondences on the different planes of human experience (physiology, psychology, ritual activity, symbolization, mystical experimentation, etc.), was at work from the Vedic period, if not from Indo-European protohistory, and it will be called upon to playa considerable role in later periods. As we shall see, the dialectic of homologization reveals its creative possibilities especially at moments of religious and metaphysical crisis, that is, when a traditional system ends by losing its validity, and its world of values collapses.
79. Ascetics and ecstatics: Muni, vriitya
If ritual austerities form an integral part of the Vedic cult, we must not lose sight of the presence of other kinds of ascetics and ecstatics, scarcely mentioned in the ancient texts. Some of these ascetics and ecstatics lived on the margin of the Aryan society without therefore being considered "heretics"; but there were others who can be



236 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
regarded as "foreigners," though it is practically impossible to decide if they belonged to the aboriginal strata or simply reflect the religious conceptions of certain Aryan tribes that evolved on the margin of the Vedic tradition. Thus a hymn of the Rig Veda (10. 136) tells of an ascetic (muni) with long hair (kdin), clad in "brown filth," "girdled with wind" (that is, naked), and into whom "the gods enter." He exclaims: "In the intoxication of ecstasy, we are mounted on the winds. You, mortals, can perceive only our body" (strophe 3). The muni flies through the air: he is the horse of the wind element (Viita) and the friend of Vayu (the god of wind). He dwells by the two oceans, that of the rising and that of the setting sun (str. 5; cf. Ath. Veda 11. 5. 6; etc.). "He follows the tracks of the Apsarases, the Gandharvas, and wild beasts, and understands their thoughts" (str. 6). He "drinks with Rudra from the cup of poison " (str. 7). This is a typical example of ecstasy: the muni's spirit forsakes his body, he divines the thought of semidivine beings and wild animals, he inhabits the "two oceans." The allusions to the horse of the wind and to the gods whom he incorporates indicate a shamanizing technique. The Vedas also describe other supranormal experiences in connection with mythical personages (Ekavratya, Brahmacarin, Vena, etc.), who probably represent the divinized models of certain ascetics and magicians. For the "man-god" remains a dominant motif in the spiritual history of India. Ekavratya is probably the archetype of that mysterious group, the vriityas, in whom various scholars have sought to see Sivaite ascetics, "mystics," forerunners of the yogins, or representatives of a non-Aryan population. A whole book of the Atharva Veda (15) is devoted to them, but the text is obscure. It shows, nevertheless, that the vriityas practice asceticism (they remain standing for a year, etc.), are acquainted with a discipline of the breaths (assimilated to the various cosmic regions: AV 15. 14. 15 fr.), homologize their body to the macrocosm (18. 1 fr.). Yet this confraternity was important, for a special sacrifice, the vriityastoma, had been established to reincorporate its members into Brahmanic society.29 During the vriityastoma, other personages were present,
29. The Vratyas wore a turban, dressed in black, and carried over their shoulders two ram skins, one black and the other white; as emblems they had a pointed stick, an ornament around the neck, and an unstrung bow. A cart drawn by a horse and a mule served them as their place of sacrifice.



Ascetics and ecstatics: Muni, vratya 237
the chief of these being a miigadha, who filled the role of chanter, and a prostitute (AV 15. 2). On the occasion of a solstitial rite (mahiivrata) she copulated ritually with the miigadha or with a brahmaciirin.30 The Brahmacarin, too, is conceived as a personage on the cosmic scale. Initiated, clad in black antelope skins, with a long beard, he journeys from the eastern ocean to the northern ocean and "creates the worlds"; he is extolled as "an embryo in the bosom of immortality" ; dressed in red, he practices tapas (AVII. 5. 6-7). But, as often happens in India, his earthly "representative," the brahmaciirin (whose first vow is chastity), had ritual intercourse with the prostitute. Sexual union played a part in certain Vedic rituals (cf. the asvamedha). It is important to distinguish between conjugal union regarded as a hierogamy31 and sexual union of the orgiastic type, whose purpose is either universal fecundity or the creation of a "magical defense." 32 In both cases, however, it is a matter of rites, one could say of" sacraments," performed in view of a resacralization of the human person or oflife. Later, Tantrism will elaborate a whole technique aiming at a sacramental transmutation of sexuality. As for the different classes of ascetics, magicians, and ecstatics who lived on the margin of the Aryan society, but the majority of whom ended by being integrated into Hinduism, we have but little information. The richest sources are late; this, however, does not lessen their interest, for they certainly reflect an earlier situation. Thus, the Vaikhiinasasmiirtasutra gives a long list of ascetics and hermits; some of them are distinguished by their hair and their garments, either torn or made from tree bark; others live naked, feed on urine and cow dung, inhabit graveyards, etc.; still others practice Yoga or a form ofproto-Tantrism.33 To summarize: from the earliest times there are documents for different forms of asceticism, ecstatic experiences, and magicoreligious techniques. It is possible to recognize austerities of the "classic" type and certain shamanizing motifs side by side with

ecstatic experiences typical of numerous other cultures and with some rudimentary Yogic practices. The heterogeneity and complexity of the behavior patterns, the techniques, and the soteriologies defended by those who had forsaken the world will continue to increase in later periods. Briefly, we can say that the ecstatic methods depend upon and continue the exalting experience of absorbing soma or other intoxicating substances and at the same time anticipate certain forms of mystical devotion, whereas the ascetic austerities and disciplines prepare the elaboration of the techniques of Yoga. It must be added that, from the period of the Upanishads, there is an increase in the custom of forsaking social life and settling in the "forest" in order to be able to devote oneself entirely to meditation. This habit long since became paradigmatic, and it is still practiced in modern India. But retreat to the "forest" on the part of people who were neither ecstatics nor ascetics nor yogins by vocation was probably a rather surprising novelty in the beginning. At bottom, abandoning social life revealed a profound crisis in the traditional religion. Very probably this crisis had come on as the result of Brahmanic speculations on the subject of sacrifice.
80. The Upanishads and the quest of the r#s: How can deliverance from the "fruits" of one's own acts be obtained?
In the BriihmalJ,as the Vedic gods were radically devalorized, to the advantage of Prajapati. The authors of the Upanishads continue and complete this process. But they go further: they do not hesitate to devalorize the all-powerful sacrifice itself. Certain Upanishadic texts affirm that, without a meditation on the iitman, sacrifice is not complete (Maitri. Up. 1. 1). The Chiindogya Upani$ad (8. 1. 6) affirms that even as the "world gained by acts (karman)" perishes, so will the world obtained by sacrifice. According to the Mailri Upani$ad (1. 2. 9-10), those who deceive themselves concerning the importance of sacrifice are to be pitied; for, after having enjoyed, in the heavens, the high place gained by their good works, they will return to earth or descend to a lower world. Neither the gods nor the rites are of any more account for a true r$i. His ideal is admirably expressed in the prayer transmitted by the earliest of the Upanishads, the BrhadiiralJ,yaka (1. 3. 28): "From nonbeing (asat) lead me to



The Upanishads and the quest of the nis 239
being (sat), from darkness lead me to light, from death lead me to immortality! " The spiritual crisis that finds vent in the Upanishads seems to have been brought on by meditation on the "powers" of sacrifice. We have seen that, just as Prajapati was reconstituted and recovered his "person" (atman) by the virtue of sacrifice, so the sacrificer, by means of ritual acts (karman), "unified" his psychophysiological functions and built up his "self" (§ 77). In the Brahma1)as the term karman denotes ritual activity and its beneficial consequences (since, after his death, the sacrificer attained to the world of the gods). But reflection on the ritual process of "cause and effect" inevitably led to the discovery that every act, by the mere fact that it obtained a result, became an integral part of an endless series of causes and effects. Once the law of universal causality was recognized in karman, the certainty founded on the salutary effects of sacrifice was destroyed. For the postexistence of the soul in heaven was the outcome of the sacrificer's ritual activity; but where was it that the products of all his other acts, performed during his whole lifetime, were" realized" ? So the blissful postexistence that was the reward for a correct ritual activity must have an end. But then what happened to the disincarnated soul (atman)? In no case could it disappear definitively. There remained of it a countless number of acts performed during life, and these constituted so many causes that must have effects-that must, in other words, be "realized" in a new existence, whether here on earth or in another world. The conclusion was inescapable: after experiencing a blissful or an unhappy postexistence in an extraterrestrial world, the soul was bound to be reincarnated. This is the law of transmigration, salflsara, which, once discovered, dominated Indian religious and philosophical thought, both "orthodox" and heterodox (Buddhism and Jainism). The term safllsara appears only in the Upanishads. As for the doctrine, its "origin" is not known. The attempt has been madebut without success-to explain the belief in the transmigration of souls by the influence of non-Aryan elements. However that may be, this discovery imposed a pessimistic view of existence. The ideal of the Vedic man-to live for a century, etc.-proves to be outworn. In itself, life does not necessarily represent "evil," on condition that it is used as a means of deliverance from the bonds of karman. The only goal worthy of a wise man is obtaining deliverance, mok$a



240 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
another term that, with its equivalents (mukti, etc.), takes its place among the key words of Indian thought. Since every act (karman) , religious or profane, strengthens and perpetuates transmigration (sa1!lsiira), deliverance can be gained neither by sacrifice nor by close relations with the gods nor even by asceticism or charity. In their hermitages the r#s sought other means of freeing themselves. An important discovery was made by meditating on the soteriological value of knowledge, already praised in the Vedas and the Briihma1;zas. Obviously, the authors of the BriihmaIJas were referring to (esoteric) knowledge of the homologies implicit in the ritual operation. It was ignorance of the sacrificial mysteries that, according to the BriihmaIJas, condemned men to a "second death." But the r#s went further: they dissociated esoteric knowledge from its ritual and theological context; gnosis is now held to be capable of grasping absolute truth, by revealing the deep structures of the real. Such a "science" ends by literally destroying" ignorance" (avidya), which seems to be the lot of human beings (the" uninitiated" of the BriihmaIJas). Certainly, this is an ignorance of a metaphysical kind, for it refers to the ultimate reality and not to the empirical realities of everyday experience. It is in this sense of "metaphysical ignorance" that the term avidya took its place in the Indian philosophical vocabulary. Avidya concealed the ultimate reality; "wisdom" (gnosis) revealed truth, hence the real. From a certain point of view this "nescience" was "creative": it created the structures and the dynamism of human existence. Perforce of avidya, on the other hand, men lived an irresponsible existence, not knowing the consequences of their acts (karman). After impassioned searchings and long hesitations, sometimes dispelled by sudden illuminations, the r~is identified in avidya the "first cause" of karman and hence the origin and dynamism of transmigration. The circle was now complete: ignorance (avidya) created or reinforced the law of cause and effect (karman) that, in its turn, inflicted the unbroken series of reincarnations (sa1!lsiira). Fortunately, liberation (mok~a) from this infernal circle was possible, above all by virtue of gnosis Uniina, vidya). As we shall see, other groups or schools also proclaimed the liberating virtues of Yoga techniques or mystical devotion. Indian thought early set itself to homologizing the different "ways" (marga) leading to deliverance. The effort culminated some centuries later in the famous synthesis



Atman-Brahman and the experience of" inner light" 241
proclaimed in the Bhagavad-Gitii (fourth century B.C.). But it is important to point out now that the discovery of the fatal sequence avidya-karman-saf!lsiira, and of its remedy, deliverance (mok$a) by means of gnosis, of metaphysical knowledge (jfiiina, vidya)-a discovery made, though imperfectly systematized, in the time of the Upanishads-constitutes the essence of later Indian philosophy. The most important developments concern the means of deliverance and, paradoxically, the person (or the" agent") who is held to enjoy this deliverance.
81. The identity atman-Brahman and the experience of "inner light"
We have purposely simplified, in order to grasp the aim and the originality of the r$is at once. In the earliest Upanishads,34 several approaches are distinguished. Yet we must not overemphasize these differences, for the system of assimilations and homologies that is predominant in the BriihmalJas remains valid in the Upanishads too. The central problem is present, explicitly or implicitly, in every text. It is a matter of grasping and comprehending the first Being, the One/ All, which alone is capable of explaining the world, life, and the destiny of man. From the time ofthe Rig Veda it had been identified in the tad ekam-"the One" (neuter)-of the celebrated hymn 10. 129. The BriihmalJas call it Prajapati or Brahman, but in these scholastic treatises the first Being was related to cosmic sacrifice and ritual sacrality. The r$is bent their every effort to apprehending it by means of a meditation guided by gnosis.35 The first Being is, obviously, unthinkable, limitless, eternal; it is at once the One and the All, "creator" and "lord" of the world. Some even identified it with the universe; others sought it in the" person" (puru$a) present in the sun, the moon, the word, etc., still others in the "limitless" that sustains the world, life, and consciousness.
34. That is, the Upanishads in prose, the Brhadiira1)yaka, the Chiindogya, the Aitareya, the Kau$itiiki, the Taittiriya. They were probably composed between 800 and 500 B.C. 35. However, it must not be forgotten that the r$is of the Upanishads are the successors of the" seers" and the poet-philosophers of the Vedic period. From a certain point of view it can be said that the central intuitions of the Upanishads are already found, in a nonsystematized form, in the Vedas. Thus,
for example, the equation "spirit" = "god" = "real" = "light." Cf. Gonda, The Vision of the Vedic Poets, pp. 40 ff., 272 ff.



242 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
Among the names of the first Being, the one that took precedence from the beginning was Brahman. In a famous passage of the Chiindogya Upani~ad (3. 14.2-4), Brahman is described as being "the whole world" and yet spiritual in nature; "life is his body, his form is light, his soul is space," and he encloses in himself all acts, desires, odors, tastes, etc. But he is at the same time "my atman in the heart, smaller than a grain of barley, than a mustard seed," and yet" greater than the earth, greater than the atmosphere, greater than these worlds." "Containing all acts, all desires ... , containing this whole world ... , this is my atman in the heart; this is Brahman. When I depart this life, I shall enter into him." 36 Yajiiavalkya, too, speaks of him "who dwells in the earth, yet the earth knows him not, whose body is the earth and controls the earth from within," and identifies him with the" atman, the inner controller, the immortal" (Brhadara1Jyaka Up. 3. 7. 3).
Like the Puru~a of Rig Veda 10. 90, Brahman reveals himself to be at once immanent (" this world") and transcendent, distinct from the cosmos and yet omnipresent in the cosmic realities. In addition, as atman, he inhabits the heart of man, which implies identity between the true "self" and the universal Being. And indeed, at death the atman of "him who knows" is united with the Brahman; the souls of the others, the unilluminated, will obey the law of transmigration (sarrzsara). There are several theories concerning postexistence without return to earth. According to some, those who have understood the esoteric symbolism of the "five fires" 37 travel through the different cosmic regions until they reach the "world of lightning." It is there that they meet with a "spiritual person," (puru~a manasah, that is, "born of the spirit "), who conducts them to the worlds of Brahman, where they will live for a long time and not return again. Modified, this theory will be taken up again by various devotional schools. According to other interpretations, how
36. In another passage of the same Upanishad (Chandogya Up. 6. 1-15), a master explains to his son, Svetaketu, the creation of the universe and man by the primordial Being: after the creation, the Being impregnates the cosmic regions and the human body, where it is present like a grain of salt dissolved in water. The atman represents the divine essence in man. And the teaching ends with the famous formula: "Thou art that (tat tvam asi), Svetaketu!" 37. The sacrificial fires are homologized with the structures of the other
world, of Parjanya, of this world, of man, and of woman (see Brh. Up. 6. 2. 9-15; Chand. Up. 5.4.1-10.2).



The two modalities of the Brahman 243
ever, union after death between the atman and the universal Being (Brahman) constitutes a kind of "impersonal immortality"; the Self is merged into its original source, Brahman. It is important to point out that meditations on the identity atman-Brahman constitute a spiritual exercise, not a chain of reasoning. Grasping one's own Self is accompanied by an experience of "inner light" (antaJ:z-jyoti), and light is supremely the image of both the atman and the Brahman. We here have, of course, an ancient tradition, since from Vedic times the sun or light are regarded as epiphanies of Being, of Spirit, of immortality and procreation. According to the Rig Veda 1. 115. 1, the sun is the life or the atmanthe Self-of all things.38 Those who have drunk soma become immortal, attain to light, and find the gods (RV 8.48.3). Now, the Chiindogya Upani$ad 3. 13.7 says: "The light that shines beyond this Heaven, beyond all, in the highest worlds beyond which there are none higher, is truly the same light that shines within man (antaJ:zpuru$a)."39 The BrhadaralJyaka Upani$ad(4. 3.7) also identifies the atman with the person that is in the heart of man, in the form of a "light in the heart." "That serene being, rising from its body and attaining the highest light, appears in its proper form. That being is the atman. That is the immortal, the fearless. That is Brahman" (Chiindogya Up. 8. 3. 4).40

Two and the One, p. 26, and "Spirit, Light, and Seed," pp. 3 if. 39. The Chtindogya Up. 3.17.7 quotes two verses from the Rig Veda that speak of contemplating" the Light that shines higher than Heaven," and adds: "By contemplating (this) most High Light, beyond Darkness, we attain to the Sun, god among the gods." Becoming conscious of the identity between the inner light and the transcosmic light is accompanied by two well-known phenomena of "subtle physiology"; heating of the body and hearing mystical sounds (ibid. 3. 13. 8).
40. So, too, in the Mu{uJaka Up. 2. 2. to, the Brahman is "pure, light of
lights." See other examples in our study "Spirit, Light, and Seed," pp. 4 if.,

244 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
same time of his own mode of being. Because he knows that man is a captive of karman and yet possesses an immortal Self, he perceives in Brahman a comparable situation. In other words, he recognizes in Brahman two seemingly incompatible modes of being: "absolute" and "relative," "spiritual" and "material," "personal" and "impersonal," etc. In the Brhadiirat:zyaka Upani~ad (2. 3. 3), Brahman is apprehended in two forms: corporeal (and mortal) and immortal. The Upanishads of the middle period 41 give a more systematic development to this tendency-already documented in the Rig Veda -to reduce the cosmic totality and consciousness to a single principle. The Kii!ha Upani~ad (especially 3. 11 f.) presents a cosmological ontology of considerable originality: the universal Spirit (puru~a) is at the summit; below it is the "nonmanifested" (avyakta), which seems to share in both the spiritual and the material; still lower is the Great Self (mahiin iilmii), the Spirit manifested in matter, followed, on progressively descending planes, by other forms of consciousness -by the sense organs, etc. According to the Svetiisvatara Upani~ad 5. 1, hidden in the imperishable and infinite Brahman are knowledge (which insures immortality) and ignorance, assimilated to mortality. This new system of homologies implies a reinterpretation of the old analogy between macrocosm and microcosm. This time it is the r#'s part to understand his existential situation by meditating on the paradoxical structure of the Brahman. Reflection proceeds on two parallel planes. On the one hand, the discovery is made that not only sensations and perceptions but also psychomental activity form part of the category of natural phenomena. (This discovery, outlined in the Maitri Upani~ad, will be chiefly elaborated by the Saq1khya and Yoga philosophies.) On the other hand, there is an increasing emphasis on the tendency (already documented in Rig Veda 10.90.3) to see in spirit and nature (prakrti) two modalities of the primordial Being, the All/One.42 Consequently, the cosmos and life represent the joint activity of these two modalities of the primordial Being. Essentially, deliverance consists in comprehending this "mystery": once the paradoxical manifestation of the All/One is disclosed, it
41. The most important are Kdlha, Prasna, Mailri, M(1)r/.akya, Svetdsvatara, and MU1)r/.aka. The period when they were composed is difficult to determine; it was probably between 500 and 200 B.C. 42. This has been well brought out by H. von Glasenapp, La philosophie indienne, p. 131.



The two modalities of the Brahman 245
becomes possible to free oneself from the wheels of the cosmic process. From different points of view, this cosmic process can be regarded as divine "play" (lila), an "illusion" (maya), due to nonknowing, or a "trial" forcing man to seek absolute freedom (mok~a).43 What is of the first importance is that the paradoxical coexistence of two contradictory modalities in the primordial Being makes it possible to give a meaning to human existence (itself no less paradoxical, because ruled by the law of karman though "containing" an atman) and, in addition, makes deliverance possible. Indeed, by understanding the analogy between Brahman and his manifestation, the material creation, and the atman caught in the net of transmigration, one discovers the fortuitous and impermanent character of the terrible sequence avidya-karman-sal]1sara.
Certainly, the Upanishads of the middle period exploit these new discoveries differently. The two modalities of the Brahman are sometimes interpreted as representing a personal god, superior to matter (his impersonal mode of being); it is in this sense that we may understand the Kiitha Upani~ad 1. 3. 11, which sets the personal principle (puru~a) above its "impersonal" (avyakta, literally "nonmanifested ") modalities.44 The Svetasvatara is even more significant, since it associates speCUlation on the absolute Being (Brahman) with devotion to a personal god, Rudra-Siva. The "Threefold Brahman" (1. 12), God immanent in all nature and in all the forms of life (2. 1617), is identified with Rudra, creator but also destroyer of the worlds (3.2). As for nature (prakrti), it is the maya of the Lord (Rudra-Siva), the creative "magic" that chains all individual beings (4. 9-10). Consequently, the cosmic creation can be understood either as a divine emanation or as "play" (lilii), in which, blinded by ignorance, human beings let themselves be caught. Deliverance is obtained by Satp.khya and Yoga, that is, by philosophical comprehension and the psychophysiological techniques of meditation (6. 13).45 It is important to emphasize the advancement of Yoga practices to the rank of a way of deliverance, side by side with gnosis, the preponderant method in the early Upanishads. The Katha Upani~ad
43. All these interpretations will become popular later. 44. Similarly in MU1JrJaka 2. 1. 2, the place of the purU$a is above that of the ak$ara, the "immutable," that is, of prakrti; see Glasenapp, p. 123. 45. The distinctive characteristic of the Svetiisvatara Up. is, however, devotion to Siva; see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 121-22.



246 INDIA BEFORE GAUTAMA BUDDHA
also presents Yoga practice side by side with meditation of the gnostic type (3. 13). Certain Yogic techniques are set forth in greater detail in the Svetasvatara, the Ma1J.r!iikya, and expecially the Mailri Upanishads. Thus we see how the researches and discoveries recorded in the earliest Upanishads developed. On the one hand, there was an effort to separate the spiritual principle (atman) from organic and psychomental life, dynamisms that were progressively devalorized by being included in the drives of nature (prakrti). It is only the Self purified from psychomental experiences that was identified with Brahman and hence could be considered immortal. On the other hand, there was an effort to decipher and analyze the relations between the total Being (Brahman) and nature. Ascetic techniques and methods of meditation, both aiming at the dissociation of the Self from psychomental experience, will be elaborated and articulated in the earliest Yoga treatises. Rigorous analysis of the mode of being of the Self (atman, puru~a) and of the structures and dynamisms of nature (prakrti) constitute the objective of the Siirpkhya philosophy.



10 Zeus and the
Greek Religion
83. Tbeogony and struggles between divine generations
The very name of Zeus proclaims his nature: he is, preeminently, an Indo-European celestial god (cf. § 62). Theocritus (4.43) could still write that Zeus sometimes shines and sometimes comes down in rain. According to Homer, the portion received by Zeus "is the broad heaven amid the air and the clouds" (Iliad 15.192). A number of his titles emphasize his structure as a god of the atmosphere: Ombrios and Hyetios (Rainy), Ourios (He who sends favorable winds), Astrapios (He who hurls the lightning), Bronton (He who thunders), etc. But Zeus is far more than a personification of the sky as a cosmic phenomenon. His uranian character is confirmed by his sovereignty and by his countless hierogamies with various chthonian goddesses. However, except for his name and his sovereignty (which he won only after hard fighting), Zeus does not resemble the ancient IndoEuropean sky gods, such, for example, as the Vedic Dyaus. Not only is he not the creator of the universe, he does not even belong to the group of Greek primordial divinities. Indeed, according to Hesiod, in the beginning there existed only Chaos (Abyss), whence arose "broad-flanked" Gaea (Gaia, Earth), and Eros. Then Gaea "bore a being equal to herself, able to cover her entirely, starry Uranus (Heaven)" (Theogony 118 if., after the translation by Mazon). Hesiod describes Uranus, "all avid for love and bringing with him night, approaching and enveloping the Earth" (Theog. 176 if.). From this cosmic hierogamyl there came into the world a second divine generation, that of the Uranides: the
1. But, before the hierogamy, Gaea had, all by herself, borne the Mountains, the Nymphs, and the barren Sea (Pontus) (Hesiod, Theogony 129 fr.).



248 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
six Titans (the first, Oceanus, the last, Kronos) and the six Titanides (among them Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne), the three one-eyed Cyclopes, and the three Hundred-armed Giants. This inordinate and sometimes monstrous fecundity is typical of primordial periods. But Uranus hated his children "from the first day," and he hid them in Gaea's body. Furious, the goddess produced a great sickle and addressed her children: "Sons sprung from me and a raging father, ... we will punish the criminal outrage of a father, your father though he be, since he was the first to think of shameful things." But, terrorized, "not one of them spoke a word" except Kronos, who undertook the task. And when Uranus approached, "drunken to penetrate the body of Earth" (Aeschylus, frag. 44 Nauck), Kronos castrated him with his sickle. From the blood that flowed upon Gaea there came into the world the three Erinyes, goddesses of vengeance, the giants, and the nymphs of ash trees. From the sexual organs of Uranus, thrown into the sea, Aphrodite was born. This episode represents an especially violent version of the archaic myth of the separation of heaven and earth. As we have already observed (§ 47), it is a widely disseminated myth, documented on various levels of culture. The castration of Uranus puts an end to an uninterrupted procreation,2 which was also, in the last analysis, useless, for the father "hid" the newborn infants in the earth. The mutilation of a cosmocrator god by his son, who thus becomes his successor, is the dominant theme of the Hurrian, Hittite, and Canaanite cosmogonies (§§ 46 if.). In all likelihood, Hesiod knew these Oriental traditions,3 for his Theogony is centered around the conflict between the divine generations and the struggle for universal sovereignty. And in fact, after reducing his father to impotence, Kronos took his place. He married his sister Rhea and had five children: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon. But since he had learned from Gaea and Uranus that he was destined to "succumb one day under the blows of his own son" (Theog. 463 if.), Kronos swallowed his children as soon as they came into the world. Frustrated, Rhea then followed Gaea's advice: on the day when she was
2. The otiositas of Uranus after his castration illustrates, though brutally, the tendency of creator gods to retire to the sky and become dii otiosi after achieving their cosmogonic work; see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, §§ 14 if.

to give birth to Zeus, she went to Crete and hid the infant in an inaccessible cave. Then she wrapped a great stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to Kronos, who swallowed it (Theog. 478 ff.). When he grew up, Zeus forced Kronos to disgorge his brothers and sisters. He then freed his father's brothers, whom Uranus had chained. In token of gratitude, they offered him thunder and lightning. Furnished with such weapons, Zeus can thenceforth command "both mortals and immortals" (Theog. 493-506). But Kronos and the Titans must first be conquered. The war had continued indecisively for ten years when Zeus and the young gods, advised by Gaea, went to fetch the three Hundred-armed Giants, imprisoned by Uranus in the subterranean depths. Soon afterward the Titans were utterly defeated and imprisoned underground in Tartarus, under the guard of the Hundred-armed Giants (Theog. 617-720). The description of the Titanomachy (especially 700 ff.) gives the impression of a regression to the precosmogonic stage. The triumph of Zeus over the Titans-incarnation of inordinate strength and violence-is consequently equivalent to a new organization of the universe. In a certain sense, Zeus creates the world anew (cf. Indra, § 68). However, this creation was dangerously threatened on two or more occasions. In a passage that was long considered to be an interpolation (lines 820-80), but whose genuineness has been demonstrated by the most recent editor of the Theogony,4 a monstrous being, Typhon, son of Gaea and Tartarus, rises against Zeus. "From his shoulders came a hundred snake heads, frightful dragons, thrusting out blackish tongues; and from his eyes ... flared a light like fire," etc. (Theog. 824 ff.). Zeus struck him with his thunderbolts and cast him down into Tartarus.5 Finally, according to the Gigantomachy, an episode unknown to Homer and Hesiod and mentioned for the first time by Pindar (First Nemean 1. 67), the giants born of Gaea fecundated by the blood of Uranus rose against Zeus and his brothers. Apollodorus adds that it was to avenge the Titans that Gaea bore the giants and that it was after the overthrow of the giants that she procreated Typhon (Bibl. 1. 6. 1-3).
4. West, Hesiod's Theogony, pp. 379 if.
5. Apollodorus, Bibl. 1. 6. 3, relates that, before being overthrown, Typhon succeeded in stealing Zeus's tendons, a motif that is reminiscent of an episode in the Hittite myth of the combat between the storm god and the dragon Illuyankas; cf. § 45. However, see West, Hesiod's Theogony, p. 392.



250 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
Gaea's machinations against the supremacy of Zeus are an expression of the obstructive eiforts of a primordial divinity in regard to the work of cosmogony or the installation of a new order (cf. the Mesopotamian theomachy, § 21).6 And yet it is due to Gaea and Uranus that Zeus is able to keep his sovereignty, thus putting a final end to the violent succession of divine dynasties.
84. Triumph and sovereignty of Zeus
And in fact, after overwhelming Typhon, Zeus parcels out dominion over the three cosmic zones by drawing lots. The ocean falls to Poseidon, the subterranean world to Hades, and the sky to Zeus, while the earth and Olympus belong to them in common (Iliad 15. 197 if.). Zeus then undertakes a series of marriages. His first wife was Metis (Prudence). However, when she was pregnant with Athena, Zeus swallowed her; for he had listened to the advice of Gaea and Uranus when they had predicted to him the eventual birth of a "violent-hearted son, who should be king of men and gods" (Theog. 886 if.). So it is due to the warning from the primordial couple that the sovereignty of Zeus was definitely insured. In addition, he incorporated Prudence into himself forever. 7 As for Athena, a blow from an ax brought her forth from her father's forehead (Theog. 924). Zeus then marries the Titaness Themis (Order), Eurynome, Mnemosyne (who bore him the nine Muses), and finally Hera (Theog. 901 if.). But before marrying Hera, he had loved Demeter, who bore Persephone, and Leto, mother of the divine twins Apollo and Artemis (910 if.). He also had numerous liaisons with other goddesses, most of them chthonian in structure (Dia, Europa, Semele, etc.). These unions reflect the hierogamies of the storm god with the divinities of the earth_The meaning of these many marriages and erotic adventures is at once religious and political. By thus appropriating the pre-Hellenic local goddesses, venerated from time immemorial, Zeus replaces them and, in so doing, begins the process of symbiosis and unification that will give Greek religion its most specific characteristic.
6. But Gaea's anger can also be interpreted as a reaction against the violence and cruelty of Zeus. 7. On the mythological plane, this episode explains the later transformation of Zeus, the source of his "wisdom."



Triumph and sovereignty of Zeus 251
The triumph of Zeus and the Olympians did not find expression in the disappearance of the archaic divinities and cults, some of them pre-Hellenic in origin. On the contrary, a part of the immemorial heritage ended by being incorporated into the Olympian religious system. We have just noted the role of the primordial couple in the destiny of Zeus. We shall cite other examples. For the moment, we will refer to the episode of Zeus's birth and infancy in Crete.8 We here undoubtedly have an Aegean mythico-ritual scenario, centered on the divine Infant, son and lover of a Great Goddess. According to the Greek tradition, the infant's cries were concealed by the noise made by the Curetes' clashing their shields together (mythological projection of the initiatory groups of young men performing their armed dance). The Palaikastro hymn (fourth to third centuries B.C.) praises the leaps of Zeus, "the greatest of the Curetes." 9 (The reference is probably to an archaic fertility ritual.) What is more, the cult of Zeus Idaeus, celebrated in a cave on Mount Ida, had the structure of an initiation into the Mysteries.10 Now Zeus was in no way a god of the Mysteries. And it is also in Crete that the tomb of Zeus was later shown; so the great Olympian god was assimilated to one of the gods of the Mysteries, who die and return to life. Aegean influences persist even in the classical period; they are to be found, for example, in the statues that show Zeus as young and beardless. But these are survivals that were tolerated, if not encouraged, by the immense and inexhaustible process of syncretism.11 For already in Homer Zeus recovers the splendors and powers of a true Indo-European sovereign god. He is more than a god of the "vast sky," he is "the father of gods and men" (Iliad 1. 544). And in a fragment of his Heliades (frag. 70 Nauck), Aeschylus proclaims: "Zeus is the ether, Zeus is the earth, Zeus is the sky. Yes, Zeus is all that is above all." Master of atmospheric phenomena, he governs the fertility of the soil, and he is invoked as Zeus Chthonios when agricultural work is begun (Hesiod, Works and Days 465). By the

name of Ctesius he is protector of the house and symbol of plenty. He also watches over the duties and rights of the family, insures respect for the laws, and, as Polieus, defends the city. At an earlier period he was the god of purification, Zeus Katharsios, and also god of prophecy, especially at Dodona, in Epirus, where divination was performed by "the divine foliage of the great oak of Zeus" (Odyssey 14. 327 if.; 19. 296 if.). Thus, despite the fact that he is the creator of neither the world nor life nor man, Zeus proves to be the uncontested chief of the gods and absolute master of the universe. The multitude of sanctuaries dedicated to Zeus prove his Panhellenic character.12 Consciousness of his omnipotence is admirably illustrated in the famous scene in the Iliad (8. 17 if.) in which Zeus makes this challenge to the Olympians: "Then [you] will see how far I am strongest of all the immortals. Come, you gods, make this endeavor, that you all may learn this. Let down out of the sky a cord of gold; lay hold of it all you who are gods and all who are goddesses, yet not even so can you drag down Zeus from the sky to the ground, not Zeus the high lord of counsel, though you try until you grow weary. Yet whenever I might strongly be minded to pull you, I could drag you up, earth and all and sea and all with you, then fetch the golden rope about the horn of Olympos and make it fast, so that all once more should dangle in mid air. So much stronger am I than the gods, and stronger than mortals" (trans. Richmond Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer [Chicago, 1951]). The mythical theme of the golden cord (or chain) has given rise to countless interpretations, from Plato, through Pseudo-Dionysius, down to the eighteenth century.13 But what concerns our purpose is that, according to an Orphic poem, the Rhapsodic Theogony, Zeus asks the primordial goddess Nyx (Night) how to establish his "proud empire over the immortals" and, especially, how to organize the cosmos so that "the whole shall be one and the parts distinct." Night teaches him the fundamentals of cosmology and then tells him of the golden cord that he must fasten to the ether.14 To be sure, this
12. Zeus was worshiped everywhere in Greece, especially on the highest mountains; important sites of his cult were at Olympia and Athens in mainland Greece, and in Crete, Asia Minor, and the West. 13. On this theme, see our study, "Ropes and Puppets," in The Two and the
One, pp. 160-88, esp. pp. 179 if. 14. See the translation and commentary in P. Leveque, Aurea Catena Homeri, pp. 14 If.

is a late text, but the tradition that it reports is old. Iliad 14. 258 if. presents Night as a comparatively powerful goddess: Zeus himself avoids angering her. It is significant that the most celebrated proclamation of the omnipotence of Zeus should have connections with the interview that the supreme master asked a primordial goddess to grant him. Night's cosmological directives in a sense repeat the revelation of Gaea and Uranus that puts an end to the struggles for sovereignty. As we have already observed, certain primordial divinities have survived the triumph of the Olympians. First of them all was Night, whose power and prestige we have just recalled. Then came Pontus (the Barren Sea); Styx, who took part in the battle against the Titans; Hecate, honored by Zeus and the other Olympians; Oceanus, the firstborn of the children of Gaea and Uranus. Each of them still played a part-modest, obscure, marginal-in the economy of the universe. When Zeus felt that his authority was definitely assured, he freed Kronos, his father, from his underground prison and made him the king of a fabulous land-the Isles of the Blessed in the farthest West.
85. The myth of the first races: Prometheus, Pandora
We shall never know the "history" of Kronos. He is certainly an archaic god, almost without a cult. His only important myth makes up an episode in the theomachy. However, Kronos is mentioned in connection with the first human race, the "race of gold." This indication is important: it shows us the beginnings and the first phase of the relations between men and the gods. According to Hesiod, "Gods and mortals have the same origin" (Works and Days 108). For men are born from the earth (gegeneis), just as the earliest gods were born by Gaea. In short, the world and the gods came into being by an initial scission, followed by a process of procreation. And just as there were several divine generations, so there were five races of men: the races of gold, silver, and bronze, the race of heroes, and the race of iron (Works 109 if.). Now the first race lived under the reign of Kronos (Works 111), that is, before Zeus. This humanity of the age of gold, exclusively masculine, dwelt with the gods, "their powerful brothers." Men "lived like gods, their hearts free from cares, safe from pains and



254 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
miseries" (Works 112 ff.). They did not work, for the soil offered them everything that they needed. Their life was spent in dancing, festivals, and all kinds of delights. They knew neither illness nor old age, and when they died it was as if they were overcome by sleep (Works 113 ff.). But this paradisal period-parallels to which are found in many traditions-was ended by the fall of Kronos.15 Hesiod then relates that the men of the race of gold "were covered by the earth," and the gods produced a less noble race, the men of the age of silver. Because of their sins, and also because they would not sacrifice to the gods, Zeus decided to destroy them. He then made the third race, that of bronze: a violent and warlike people who ended by killing one another, down to the last man. Zeus created a new generation, that of the heroes; they became famous through the grandiose battles before Thebes and Troy. Many of them suffered death, but the others were placed by Zeus at the ends ofthe earth, in the Isles of the Blessed, and Kronos reigned over them (Works 14069). Hesiod says nothing of the fifth race, that of iron. But he laments that it was given him to be born into that period (Works 176 ff.). The traditions reported by Hesiod raise many problems, but not all of them are directly concerned with our purpose. The myth of the "perfection of the beginnings" and of primordial bliss, both lost as the result of an accident or a "sin," is comparatively widespread. The variant Hesiod presents states that the decadence takes place progressively, in four stages, which is reminiscent of the Indian doctrine of the four yugas. But though their colors are given-white, red, yellow, and black-the yugas are not associated with metals. On the other hand, metals as specific signs of historical epochs are found in the dream of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2: 32-33) and in some late
15. It may appear paradoxical that the "savage" god who, according to the Theogony, swallowed his children as soon as they were born, reigned, still according to Hesiod (Works 111), during the Edenic period of humanity. But it must not be forgotten that the Kronos of the Theogony reflects strong
Oriental influences. It is also surprising that the gods are presented as the .. powerful brothers" of men. Such an assertion contradicts the general opinion that emphasizes the radical ontological difference between gods and men. Yet it should be pointed out that the fundamental distinction already existed at the period of the golden race: men enjoyed the bliss and the friendship of the gods, but not immortality. Besides, the gods belonged to the second divine generation, that of the Titans; in other words, the structures of the world and the modalities of existence were not yet strictly defined.



The myth of the first races: Prometheus, Pandora 255
Iranian texts. But in the first case the reference is to dynasties, and in the second the succession of empires is projected into the future. Hesiod had to insert the age of the heroes between the races of bronze and iron because the mythicized memory of the fabulous heroic period was too strong for him to ignore it. The age of the heroes interrupts-and quite inexplicably-the process of progressive degradation begun by the appearance of the silver race. However, the privileged destiny of the heroes poorly conceals an eschatology: they do not die, but enjoy a blissful existence in the Isles of the Blessed, the Elysium where Kronos now rules. In other words, the heroes to a certain extent recover the existence of the men of the golden age under the reign of Kronos. This eschatology will be greatly elaborated later, especially under the influence of Orphism. Elysium will no longer be the exclusive privilege of heroes but will become accessible to the souls of the pious and to the "initiated." This is a process of considerable frequency in the history of religions (cf. Egypt, § 30; India; etc.). It must be added that the myth of successive ages does not represent the unanimous opinion concerning the origin of mankind. Indeed, the problem of the anthropogony seems not to have occupied the Greeks. They were more interested in the origin of some particular ethnic group, of a city, of a dynasty. Many families considered themselves descended from a hero who, in turn, had sprung from the union of a divinity with a mortal. One people, the Myrmidons, were descended from ants, another from ash trees. After the flood, Deucalion repeopled the earth with "his mother's bones," that is, with stones. Finally, according to a late tradition (fourth century), it was Prometheus who fashioned men from clay. For reasons that we do not know, gods and men decided to part amicably at Mekone (Theog. 535). Men offered the first sacrifice in order definitively to settle their relations with the gods. It is on this occasion that Prometheus first plays a role. IS He sacrificed an ox and divided it into two portions. But, wanting to protect men and, at the same time, to dupe Zeus, Prometheus covered the bones with a layer of fat and covered the flesh and entrails with the paunch. Attracted by the fat, Zeus chose the poorer portion for the gods, leaving the flesh and entrails for men. This, adds Hesiod, is why since then men burn the bones as an offering to the immortal gods (Theog. 556).
16. Prometheus' name does not appear in Homer.



256 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
This cunning division of the sacrifice had great consequences for humanity. On the one hand, it raised the carnivorous diet, as a paradigmatic religious act, to the position of highest homage offered to the gods; but, in the last analysis, this implied abandoning the vegetarian regime followed during the age of gold. On the other hand, Prometheus' trick angered Zeus against humankind, and he deprived them of the use of fire. 17 But the wily Prometheus brought fire down from heaven, hiding it in a hollow fennel-stalk (Theog. 567; Works 52). Furious, Zeus decided to punish men and their protector together. Prometheus was chained, and an eagle daily ate his" immortal liver," which was renewed again overnight (Theog. 521 ff.; Works 56). One day he will be set free by Heracles, son of Zeus, to the increase of the hero's glory. As for human beings, Zeus sent them woman, that "beautiful evil" (Theog. 585), in the form of Pandora (the "present from all the gods," Works 81 ff.). "Snare from which there is no escaping, destined for mankind," Hesiod denounces her; "for it is from her that there came the race, the accursed tribe of woman, that terrible plague set among mortal men" (Theog. 592 ff.).18
86. The consequences of the primordial sacrifice
All in all, far from being a benefactor of humanity, Prometheus is responsible for its present fallen state. At Mekone he instigated the separation between men and gods. Then, by stealing fire, he exasperated Zeus and thus caused the invention of Pandora, that is, the appearance of woman and, in consequence, the propagation of all
17. Deprivation of the use of fire annulled the benefits of the division; for, obliged to eat raw flesh, and unable to sacrifice to the gods, men reentered the condition of wild animals. 18. Prometheus had vainly instructed his brother to accept nothing from Zeus. The naIve Epimetheus receives Pandora and marries her. Not long afterward, she opens the mysterious jar, from which all the evils escape and spread over the world. When Pandora replaces the cover, only Hope still remains at the bottom of the jar. As Sechan and Leveque observe, "This is precisely what the angry Zeus wanted, to constrain man eternally to 'hard toil' (Hes., Works 91), and that is why he made Hope, 'who feeds the vain efforts of man' (Simonides 1. 6), enter the vessel" (Les grandes divinites de fa Grece, p.54).



The consequences of the primordial sacrifice 257
kinds of cares, tribulations, and misfortunes. For Hesiod, the myth of Prometheus explains the sudden coming of evil into the world; in the last analysis, "evil" represents the vengeance of ZeuS.19 But this pessimistic view of human history, doomed by the doubledealing of a Titan, did not definitively impose itself. For Aeschylus, who substitutes the theme of progress for the myth of the primordial golden age, Prometheus is the greatest civilizing hero. The first men, Prometheus affirms, lived "underground, deep in caverns closed to the sun"; they did not even know the succession of the seasons or the domestication of animals or agriculture; it was he, Prometheus, who taught them all arts and all sciences (Prometheus Bound 442 fr.). It is he who gave them fire 20 and freed them from the fear of death (line 248). Jealous because he was not the author of this humanity, Zeus wanted to destroy it and create another (233). Prometheus alone dared to oppose this plan of the master of the world. To explain the anger of Zeus and Prometheus' intransigence, Aeschylus took from Pindar (or from his source) a dramatic detail: Prometheus possesses a terrible weapon, in the form of the secret told him by his mother, Themis. This secret concerned the ineluctable fall of Zeus 21 in a more or less distant future (522, 764 fr.). The Titan emphatically declared that Zeus has but one way to avoid this catastrophe: to free him (Prometheus) from his chains (769-70). Since the two other parts of the Prometheus trilogy have not been preserved, we do not know how the antagonism between the two divine figures was ended by their reconciliation. But in fifth-century Athens, Prometheus already had his annual festival; he was, in addition, associated with Hephaestus and Athena. In any case, perhaps under the influence of certain spiritual movements that were eagerly followed both by the intellectual elite and by the man in the street (see vol. 2 of this work), there had for some time been a marked emphasis on the wisdom and benignity of Zeus. Not only had the supreme master repented, by
19. Hesiod is categorical: from the day when Zeus sees himself "duped by Prometheus of knavish thoughts, from that day he prepares sad cares" (Works 47 fr.). 20. He does not give it back to them, as in Hesiod, by bringing it from heaven. "Aeschylus omitted the episode of Mekone, which was not in harmony with the tone of tragedy and might have diminished the prestige of his hero" (L. Sechan, Le mythe de Promethee, p. 102, n. 62).
21. On the origin and development of this motif, see Sechan, ibid., pp. 23 fr., 42 fr., and J. P. Vernant, "Metis et les mythes de souverainete.~'



258 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
setting Kronos up as king in Elysium; he had also forgiven the Titans. Pindar proclaims that "Zeus, the Immortal, had freed the Titans" (Fourth Pythian 291) and, in the Prometheus Unbound, the chorus is made up of the Titans freed from their chains.22 The division of the first sacrificial victim at Mekone shows its effects, on the one hand, in the break between gods and men and, on the other, in the condemnation of Prometheus. Yet Zeus's indignation seems excessive; for as Karl Meuli has shown,23 this ritual division corresponds to the sacrifices offered to the celestial gods by the primitive hunters of Siberia and the herders of Central Asia-in fact, the latter present the uranian supreme beings with the animal's bones and head. In other words, what, at an archaic stage of culture, was considered the most fitting homage to a celestial god had become, in the act of Prometheus, a crime of lese-majeste against Zeus, the supreme god. We do not know at what moment this warping of the original ritual meaning occurred. It seems, however, that Zeus's rage was provoked, not by the division in itself, but by the fact that it was arranged by Prometheus, in other words by a Titan, a member of the divine "old generation," who, to make matters worse, had sided with men against the Olympians. The example set by Prometheus could have unfortunate consequences; encouraged by this first success, men might go even further than the Titan had done. But Zeus would not tolerate a powerful and proud humanity. Men must never forget that their existential status was precarious and ephemeral. Hence they must keep their distance. Indeed, later on, Deucalion, son of Prometheus, and the only survivor of the flood brought on by Zeus, offers him a sacrifice like the one at Mekone, and it is accepted. "Zeus receives Deucalion's demand favorably, but the myth indicates that he consents precisely insofar as distance is maintained." 24 From then on the most common sacrifice, the thysia, repeats this mythical model: part of the victim, the fat, is burned on the altar, and the other part is eaten by the sacrificers and their companions.25 But the gods are also present:

24. J. Rudhardt, .. Les mythes grecques relatifs aI'instauration du sacrifice," p. 14. Besides, Zeus does not answer Deucalion directly; he sends Hermes to learn what he wants (Apollodorus, Bibl. 1. 7. 2). 25. The closest analogue is the zeba/:t of the Hebrews (see § 57).

they feed on the sacrifices (Iliad 1. 423-24; 8. 548-52, etc.) or on the smoke that rises from the burning fat (II. 1.66-67; etc.). The break brought on at Mekone is in some sense mended, and precisely by Deucalion. The son of Prometheus reestablishes the gods in the conditions that were agreeable to Zeus. (Besides, the humanity contemporary with the fatal division had perished in the flood.) It is significant that, after Aeschylus, Prometheus plays a comparatively small and unobtrusive part. Possibly the very success of the Prometheus trilogy contributed to this situation. For if Aeschylus had praised the unique greatness of this civilizing hero, protector of men, he had also illustrated the benignity of Zeus and the spiritual value of the final reconciliation, raised to the rank of paradigmatic model for human wisdom. Prometheus will not recover his sublime stature as eternal victim of tyranny until the age of European Romanticism. In India, speculations on sacrifice find expression in a particular cosmogony and open the way to the metaphysics and techniques of Yoga (§§ 76-78). Among the Hebrews, blood sacrifices will be continually reinterpreted and revalorized, even after the criticisms of the prophets. As for Christianity, it was founded on the voluntary immolation of Christ. Orphism and Pythagoreanism, by emphasizing the virtues of a vegetarian diet, implicitly recognized the "sin" committed by men in accepting the division made at Mekone (see vol. 2). However, the punishment of Prometheus played only a secondary role in reflections on the "justice" of Zeus. Now the problem of divine "justice," with its corollary, human "destiny," exercised Greek thought from Homer on.
87. Man and destiny: The meaning of the "joy of life"
Judged from the Judeo-Christian point of view, Greek religion seems to take form under the sign of pessimism: human existence is by definition ephemeral and burdened with cares. Homer compares man to the "leaves that the wind scatters on the ground" (II. 6. 146 if.). The comparison is taken up again by the poet Mimnermus of Colophon (seventh century) in his long enumeration of evils: poverty, disease, mourning, old age, etc. "He is not a man to whom Zeus does not send a thousand ills." For his contemporary, Simonides, men are "creatures of a day," living like cattle, "not knowing by



260 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
what road god will lead each of us to our destiny."26 A mother prayed to Apollo to reward her piety by bestowing on her two children the greatest gift in his power; the god consented, and the children immediately died without pain (Herodotus 1. 31. 1 ff.). Theognis, Pindar, Sophocles proclaim that the best fate for human beings would be not to be born or, once born, to die as soon as possible.27 Yet death resolves nothing, since it does not bring total and final extinction. For Homer's contemporaries death was a diminished and humiliating postexistence in the underground darkness of Hades, peopled by pallid shadows, without strength and without memory. (Achilles, whose ghost Ulysses succeeds in calling up, declares that he would choose to be on earth, the slave of a poor man, '~rather than to reign over all the dead.")28 Besides, good done on earth was not rewarded, and evil was not punished. Of all the dead, only lxion, Tantalus, and Sisyphus were condemned to eternal torment, for they had offended Zeus in person. And if Menelaus did not go down to Hades but was transported to Elysium, it was because, by marrying Helen, he had become Zeus's son-in-law. According to the tradition transmitted by Hesiod (cf. § 85), other heroes enjoy the same destiny. But they were privileged beings. This pessimistic conception imposed itself when the Greeks became aware of the precariousness of the human condition. On the one hand, man is not, stricto sensu, the "creature" of a divinity (an idea held by many archaic traditions and by the three monotheisms); hence he does not dare to hope that his prayers can establish a certain intimacy with the gods. On the other hand, he knows that his life is already decided by destiny, moira or aisa, the "lot" or "portion" granted to him-in short, the time allowed him until his death. 29 Consequently, death was decided at the moment of
26. The Ionian poets seem to be terrorized by misery, sicknesses, and old age. The only possible consolations are war and glory, or the enjoyments procured by wealth. 27.

The meaning of the terms moira and aisa varied after Homer. These almost demonic powers, which drove men to madness, were later personified



Man and destiny: The meaning of the "joy of life" 261
birth; the duration of life was symbolized by the thread spun by the divinity.30 However, certain expressions such as "moira of the gods" (Od. 3. 261) or "aisa of Zeus" (II. 17. 322; Od. 9. 52) give us to understand that it is Zeus himself who determines fates. In principle, he can alter destiny, as he was preparing to do on behalf of his son Sarpedon (11.16.433 ff.) at the moment when the latter's life had just reached its term. But Hera points out to him that such an act will result in annulling the laws of the universe-that is, of justice (dike)and Zeus admits that she is right. This example shows that Zeus himself recognizes the supremacy ofjustice; besides, dike is only the concrete manifestation, in human society, of the universal order, in other words, of the divine Law (themis). Hesiod declares that Zeus bestowed justice on men so that they would not behave like wild beasts. The first duty of man is to be just and to show honor (time) to the gods, especially by offering them sacrifices. Certainly, the term dike evolved in the course of the centuries that separate Homer from Euripides. The latter does not hesitate to write: "If the gods do anything that is ugly (or: base), they are not the gods!" (frag. 292, from Bellerophon). Before Euripides, Aeschylus had declared that Zeus does not punish the innocent (Agamemnon 750 ff.). But already in the Iliad Zeus can be recognized as the protector of dike, since it is he who guarantees oaths and protects strangers, guests, and suppliants.31 In short, the gods do not strike men without reason, as long as mortals do not go beyond the limits prescribed by their own mode of existence. But it is difficult not to go beyond the imposed limits, for man's ideal is "excellence" (arete). Now, excessive excellence runs the risk of arousing inordinate pride and insolence (hybris). This
and became three goddesses. The three Moirai appear for the first time in Hesiod, Theog. 900 fr.; they are the daughters of Zeus and Themis. 30. At first the "spinning" was done either by "the gods" (Od. 20.196; etc.)
or "the daimon" (Od. 16. 64), or by moira (II. 24. 209) or aisa (11.20. 128). But finally, as in other Indo-European (but also Oriental) traditions, the" spinning" of destinies became the attribute of the Spinners (Klothes) or the Moirai. Cf. Volospii, str. 20; Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, § 58. To "spin" someone's destiny is equivalent to "binding" him, in other words to immobilizing him in a "situation" that cannot be changed. 31. H. Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus, p. 6 (against the interpretation advanced by Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational, p. 52, n. 18). Zeus is also the model for a king: as responsible for the well-being of his subjects, the



262 ZEUS AND THE GREEK RELIGION
happened, for example, to Ajax, when he boasted that he had escaped death despite the gods and so was destroyed by Poseidon (Od. 4. 499-511). Hybris brings on a temporary madness (ate), which blinds the victim and leads him to disaster.32 This is as much as to say that hybris and its result, ate, are the means that in certain cases (heroes, kings, adventurers, etc.) bring about the realization of moira, the portion of life allotted at birth to such mortals, whether they are overambitious or are simply misled by the ideal of excellence. In the last analysis, man has nothing to work with except his own limitations, those which are assigned to him by his human condition and, particularly, by his moira. Wisdom begins with consciousness of the finiteness and precariousness of every human life. So the thing to do is to take advantage of everything that can be offered by the present: youth, health, physical pleasures, or occasions for displaying the virtues. This is Homer's lesson: to live wholly, but nobly, in the present. Certainly, this "ideal" born of despair will undergo changes: we shall examine the most important of them further on (see vol. 2). But consciousness of the predestined limits and the fragility of existence was never obliterated. Far from inhibiting the creative forces of the Greek religious genius, this tragic vision led to a paradoxical revalorization of the human condition. Since the gods had forced him not to go beyond his limits, man ended by realizing the perfection and, consequently, the sacrality of the human condition. In other words, he rediscovered and brought to the full the religious sense of the "joy of life," the sacramental value of erotic experience and of the beauty of the human body, the religious function of every organized collective occasion for rejoicing-processions, games, dances, singing, sports competitions, spectacles, banquets, etc. The religious sense of the perfection of the human body-physical beauty, harmonious movements, calm, serenity-inspired the artistic canon. The anthropomorphism of the Greek gods, as it is perceptible in the myths and, later, will be savagely criticized by the philosophers, finds its religious meaning again in the divine statuary. Paradoxically, a
basileus is necessarily the protector of traditional rights and customs, the themistes; in other words, he is bound to respect a certain dike. 32. When Herodotus (1. 32) makes Solon say, "I know that the divinity is subject to envy and instability," he is chiefly criticizing the unintelligence of those who forget their human condition and let themselves be led astray by hybris.



Man and destiny: The meaning of the "joy of life" 263
religion that proclaims the irreducible distance between the divine world and the world of mortals makes the perfection of the human body the most adequate representation of the gods. But it is above all the religious valorization of the present that requires emphasizing. The simple fact of existing, of living in time, can comprise a religious dimension. This dimension is not always obvious, since sacrality is in a sense camouflaged in the immediate, in the "natural" and the everyday. The joy of life discovered by the Greeks is not a profane type of enjoyment: it reveals the bliss of existing, of sharing-even fugitively-in the spontaneity of life and the majesty of the world. Like so many others before and after them, the Greeks learned that the surest way to escape from time is to exploit the wealth, at first sight impossible to suspect, of the lived instant. The sacralization of human finitude and of the banality of an ordinary existence is a comparatively frequent phenomenon in the history of religions. But it is especially in China and Japan of the first millennium of our era that the sacralization of "limits" and "circumstances"-of whatever nature-achieved excellence and profoundly influenced the respective cultures. Just as in ancient Greece, this transmutation of the "natural datum" also found expression in the emergence of a particular esthetic.33

11 The Olympians and
the Heroes
88. The fallen great god and the smith-magician: Poseidon and Hephaestus
Poseidon is an ancient great god who for many reasons lost his original universal sovereignty.l Traces of his former majesty are found everywhere, beginning with his name, which Wilamowitz correctly explained as meaning" husband of Earth" (Posis Das). In the Iliad (15. 204) Zeus is his elder, but Hesiod certainly reflects an earlier tradition by presenting Zeus as the younger (Theogony 456). In any case, only Poseidon dares to protest against Zeus's abuse of power, reminding him that his proper domain is limited to heaven.2 We can detect in this detail the memory of a former sovereign god's resistance to the rise of a younger and more fortunate deity. By receiving, at the division of the universe, sovereignty over the seas, Poseidon became a true Homeric god; in view of the importance of the sea for the Hellenes, he was certain never to lose his religious actuality. However, his original structure was radically altered, and the northern mythico-religious heritage that he had brought to Greece was almost entirely dispersed or reinterpreted. Indeed, the Indo-European people who worshiped Poseidon did not know the sea until they arrived in southern Greece. A number of Poseidon's characteristics have nothing to do with the sea. As Poseidon Hippios he is the god of horses, and in several places, especially Arcadia, he was worshiped in the form of a horse. It is in Arcadia that Poseidon met with Demeter wandering in search of
1. At Pylos, in the Achaean period, Poseidon enjoyed a religious position definitely superior to that of Zeus.

Persephone. To escape him, the goddess changed herself into a mare, but Poseidon, in the form of a stallion, succeeded in possessing her. From their union were born a daughter and the steed Arion (Antimachus, in Pausanias 8. 25. 9). In the large number of his amorous adventures Poseidon is close to Zeus; at the same time, they bring out his original structure as "husband of Earth" and as "earthshaker." According to Hesiod, he married Medusa, she too an ancient earth goddess. Another tradition recounts that Antaeus issued from his union with Ge. His relations with the horse indicate that animal's importance for the Indo-European invaders. Poseidon is presented as the creator, the father, or the bestower of horses. Now the horse is connected with the infernal world, and this again brings out the god's character as "master of the Earth." His primordial power is also indicated by the gigantic or monstrous forms of his children: Orion, Polyphemus, Triton, Antaeus, the Harpies, etc. As Posis Das, the male spirit of the fertility inhabiting the earth, as Wilamowitz conceived him, the god whom the Indo-Europeans brought with them could be compared to the sovereign and fecundating gods, "masters of the Earth," of the Mediterranean and Oriental religions.3 By becoming exclusively a marine god, Poseidon could retain only such of his original attributes as depended on the sea: capricious power and mastery over the fates of navigators. Hephaestus enjoys a unique situation in Greek religion and mythology. His birth was peculiar: according to Hesiod, Hera engendered him "without a love union, in anger and spite against her husband." 4 In addition, Hephaestus differs from all the other Olympians by his ugliness and infirmity. He is lame in both feet, crooked or bandylegged, and needs a support to walk. This infirmity was the result of his fall onto the island of Lemnos; Zeus had thrown him down from the top of Olympus because he had sided with his mother, Hera (Iliad 1. 500 ff.). According to another version, it was Hera who threw him into the sea at the moment of his birth, ashamed of his deformity (Iliad 18. 394 ff.). Two Nereids, Thetis and Eurynome, received him in a deep cave in the middle of the ocean. It is there that, for nine years, Hephaestus served his apprenticeship as smith and artisan.

266 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
The analogies with the themes of the "persecuted child" and the "maleficent infant" have been pointed out; in both cases the child emerges from the ordeal victorious. This undoubtedly represents an initiatory ordeal,5 comparable to Dionysus' or Theseus' leaps into the waves.6 But it is initiation of the magical and shamanic type that explains Hephaestus' mutilation. Marie Delcourt has compared Hephaestus' cut tendons or backward-turned feet to the initiatory tortures of the future shaman.7 Like other magiCian-gods, Hephaestus paid for his knowledge of the smith's and the artisan's trades by his physical mutilation. His works are at once masterpieces of art and magical wonders. Along with brooches, bracelets, rosettes (Iliad 18.400-401), he makes the famous shield of Achilles (18.369 fr.), the gold and silver dogs that flank the door of Alcinous' palace (Odyssey 7. 92), the shining houses of the gods, and automata, the most famous of which are the golden tripods that move by themselves and the two "handmaidens of gold" (II. 18.417 fr.) that resemble young girls and support him when he walks. At Zeus's bidding he fashions Pandora from clay and animates her. But Hephaestus is, above all, a master "binder." With his works-thrones, chains, nets-he binds gods and goddesses, as well as the Titan Prometheus. He gives Hera a golden throne, whose invisible bonds hold the goddess captive once she is seated in it. Since no god could free her from it, Dionysus was sent; he succeeded in intoxicating Hephaestus and brought him back to Olympus, where he finally set his mother free (Pausanias 1. 20. 2). His most celebrated exploit is also the most comic: Hephaestus imprisons Ares and his mistress, Aphrodite, in an invisible net and invites the Olympians to look at their guilty union (Od. 8.266 fr.). The gods burst out laughing, but they are at the same time intimidated by this piece of handiwork, whose author proves, rather than a great artisan, to be a dangerous magician. As a god-magician, Hephaestus is at once binder and looser and hence god-midwife (it is he who delivers Zeus of Athena). Nowhere

else is the equivalence of magic and technological perfection better brought out than in the mythology of Hephaestus. Certain sovereign gods (VaruI,la, Zeus) are masters of bonds. But the power to bind and loose is shared by other divine or demonic figures (for example, in India, Vrtra, Yama, Nirrti). Knots, nets, laces, cords, strings are among the vivid images that express the magico-religious power necessary to command, govern, punish, paralyze, strike dead; in short, "subtle" expressions, paradoxically delicate, of a terrible, inordinate, supernatural power.s The mythology of Hephaestus associates the source of such a magical power with the trade secrets of metallurgists, smiths, and artisans-in short, to technological and craftsmanly perfection. But all techniques have their origin and their point of support in the mastery of fire, the apanage of shamans and magicians before it becomes the secret of potters, metallurgists, and smiths. The "origins" of Hephaestus are unknown. Attempts to explain him by the pre-Hellenic heritage or by Indo-European traditions have failed. His archaic structure is obvious. More than a god of fire, he must have been a patron god of the various kinds of work that imply mastery of fire, in other words, a particular, and rather rare, form of magic.
89. Apollo: Contradictions reconciled
It may seem paradoxical that the name of the god considered to be the most perfect incarnation of the Hellenic genius does not have a Greek etymology. No less paradoxical is the fact that his most famous mythical exploits do not bear witness to the virtues that have come to be called" Apollonian": serenity, respect for law and order, divine harmony. The god often lets himself be carried away by vengeance, jealousy, and even spite. But these weaknesses will soon lose their anthropomorphic character and will end by revealing one of the many dimensions of divinity as it was understood by the Greeks. He who, after Zeus, most radically illustrates the distance that separates man from the gods suffered the fate ofthe lowest of mortals : he was even refused the right to be born. Pregnant by Zeus, the

268 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
Titaness Leto sought in vain for a place to bear her child. No country dared to receive her for fear of Hera, who, in addition, had incited Python, the dragon of Delphi, to pursue her. Finally, the island of Delos accepted the Titaness, and she gave birth to twins, Artemis and Apollo. One of the infant's first acts was to punish Python. According to another, and earlier, version, Apollo traveled to Delphi, his future home. The road being blocked by a female dragon, Python, Apollo killed it with his arrows. 9 This is an exploit that can be justified, as it is possible to justify the execution of the giant Tityos, who had tried to violate his mother. But Apollo, again with his arrows, slaughtered the seven sons of Niobe (while Artemis killed the seven daughters) because the proud mother had humiliated Leto by boasting of her numerous progeny. He killed his sweetheart Coronis, who had deceived him with a morta1.10 He also killed, but by mistake, his favorite, the beautiful youth Hyacinthus. This aggressive mythology, which for many centuries inspired literature and the plastic arts, has its parallel in the history of Apollo's penetration into Greece. Briefly, it is the history of his replacing, more or less brutally, many pre-Hellenic local divinities, a process that is characteristic of Greek religion as a whole. In Boeotia the god was associated with Ptoos, as Apollo Ptoos, but in about the fourth century Ptoos became his son or his grandson. At Thebes he took the place of Ismenius. But the most famous example is his installation at Delphi, after he had killed the former master of the holy site, the Python. This mythical exploit was of considerable importance, and not only for Apollo. The victory of a god-champion over the Dragon, symbol at once of "autochthony" and of the primordial sovereignty of the telluric powers, is one of the most widespread myths (cf. § 45). What is peculiar to Apollo is, on the one hand, that he had to expiate this murder, thus becoming the unrivaled god of purifications, and, on the other hand, his installation

10. But Apollo saved the child that she was about to bear, Asclepius. The latter became a famous physician; indeed, his power to heal was so great that once, in response to Artemis' pleas, he even restored Hippolytus to life. This miracle contravened the laws established by Zeus, and the king of the gods smote Asclepius with a thunderbolt. Apollo avenged himself by slaughtering the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolt. Guilty of a crime against his own clan (the Cyclopes were Titans, like Leto), Apollo was banished among mortals for a year; he worked as a slave in the household of Admetus.



Apollo: Contradictions reconciled 269
at Delphi. Now it is as the Pythian Apollo that he obtained his position of Panhellenic eminence. The process was already accomplished in the eighth century.11 As for his" origin," it has been sought in the northern regions of Eurasia or in Asia Minor. The first hypothesis depends chiefly on his relations with the Hyperboreans, whom the Greeks considered to be the inhabitants of a country "beyond Boreas," that is, beyond the North Wind. According to the Delphic myth,12 Zeus had decided that Apollo should reside at Delphi and bring laws to the Hellenes. But the young god flew away, on a chariot drawn by swans, to the country of the Hyperboreans, where he spent a whole year. However, since the Delphians never ceased to invoke him with songs and dances, the god returned. After that, he spent the three months of winter among the Hyperboreans and returned at the beginning of summer. During his absence, Dionysus reigned at Delphi as master of the oracle. According to Pindar, "no one could discover, either by land or by sea, the wonderful road that leads to the games of the Hyperboreans" (Tenth Pythian 29 ff.). In other words, the country and its inhabitants belong to mythical geography. It is a holy race, free from sickness and old age. It is Pindar again (frag. 272 Bowra) who declares that the Hyperboreans can live for a thousand years; they know neither work nor warfare and spend their time dancing and playing the lyre and the flute. Bacchylides (3. 58) recounts that, to reward "their piety," Apollo carried Cressus and his daughters to the land of the Hyperboreans. So we have to do with a paradisal place, comparable to the Isles of the Blessed, to which the souls of heroes go. Herodotus (4.32-35) reports the information given by the Delians concerning the offerings that Apollo received from the Hyperboreans: certain objects wrapped in wheat straw were handed over to the people of the neighboring country, who in their turn conveyed them to the country nearest by, and so on as far as Delos. It would be useless to look for a possible historical recollection in this tradition, which, among other things, placed the olive, especially the tree of the Mediterranean, in the country of the Hyperboreans.

270 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
Yet the northern regions-from Thrace to the country of the Scythians and the Issedones-had an important place in the fabulous traditions linked with Apollo. Some of his legendary disciples (Abaris, Aristeas) were "Hyperboreans," and Orpheus was always connected with Thrace. But this is a North which, though being gradually discovered and explored, retained a mythological aura. It is especially this imaginary North that inspired and fed mythological creativity. In favor of Apollo's Asiatic origin, the fact is cited that his greatest places of worship were in Asia: Patara in Lycia, Didymas in Caria, Claros in Ionia, etc. Like so many other Olympian gods, he seems a newcomer in his holy places in continental Greece. In addition, in a Hittite inscription found near an Anatolian village, it has been possible to decipher the name Apulunas, "god of gates," which, as Nilsson reminds us, Apollo was in classical Greece.13 But the "genesis" of a god is interesting only insofar as it helps us to grasp the religious genius of his worshipers. Like the Greek people itself, its gods are the result of a grandiose synthesis. It is by virtue of this long process of confrontation, symbiosis, coalescence, and synthesis that the Greek divine forms were able to reveal all their virtualities.
90. Oracles and purification
Scarcely born, Apollo cries out: "Give me my lyre and my curved bow; I will declare to men the inflexible will of Zeus" (Homeric Hymn to Apollo 132). In the Eumenides of Aeschylus, he tells the Furies that he has "never delivered an oracle on man, woman, or city that was not an order from Zeus" (lines 616-19). This veneration for the father of the Olympians explains Apollo's connections with the ideas of order and law. In the classical period he represents especially the legal aspects of religion. Plato calls him the "national exegete" (patrios exegetes; Rep. 4.427b). He imparts his counsel by the oracles at Delphi and, at Athens and Sparta, by his exegetai, who transmit and explain the measures decided on by the god concerning the temple liturgies and, above all, the purifications made necessary

Oracles and purification 271
by homicides. For if Apollo became the god who keeps away evil (apotropaios) and the unrivaled purifier (katharsios), it is because he himself had to be purified after murdering the Python. Every crime of homicide produced a maleficent pollution, a power almost physical in nature, the miasma, a fearful scourge that threatened entire communities. Apollo contributed considerably to making the archaic customs concerning homicides more humane.Hit is he who succeeded in getting Orestes acquitted of the crime of matricide (see Aeschylus' Eumenides).
Delphi had a prehistory as an oracular site long before Apollo. Whatever its etymology may have been, the Greeks connected the name with delphys, "womb."15 The mysterious cavity was a mouth, a stomion, a term that also designates the vagina. The omphalos of Delphi was also documented from the pre-Hellenic period. Symbol of the navel, it was laden with genital meaning,16 but it was above all a "center of the world." According to the legend, two eagles loosed by Zeus at the opposite ends of the world met on the omphalos. This venerable oracular site, where from ancient times the sacrality and the powers of Mother Earth were manifested, received a new religious orientation under the reign of Apollo. Oracles were obtained by the Pythia (the priestess) and by the prophet who took part in the consultation. In the beginning, consultations took place once a year (on the god's anniversary), then once a month, and, finally, several times a month, except during the winter, when Apollo was away. The operation included the preliminary sacrifice of a goat. Usually the consultants put their questions in an alternative form: that is, was it better to do one thing or another. The Pythia gave the answer by drawing lots in the form of white or black beans.17
14. Custom demanded that the perpetrator of even involuntary murder should be killed by the victim's family; this was the only possible way to appease the soul of the victim and get rid of the pollution (miasma) produced by the crime. Draco's code introduces the authority of the state in place of the vendetta; the city tribunal now judged the crime and handed the culprit over to the victim's family. 15. The female snake Delphyne, born of the Earth, gives place to the male snake Python.

272 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
In the most serious cases the Pythia, inspired by Apollo, prophesied in the crypt of the temple. The term "Pythic delirium" has been used, but nothing indicates either hysterical trances or "possessions" of the Dionysiac type. Plato compared the delirium (mania) of the Pythia to poetic inspiration bestowed by the Muses and to the amorous transports of Aphrodite. According to Plutarch: "The god contents himself with putting in the Pythia visions and the light that illuminates the future; it is in this that enthusiasm consists."18 On the figured monuments the Pythia is calm, serene, concentratedlike the god who inspires her. By what means she attained this second state remains a mystery. The Pythia, chosen among the peasant women of Delphi, prophesied on set dates. The laurel leaves that she chewed, fumigations with laurel, the water from the spring Cassotis that she drank have no intoxicating properties and do not explain the trance. According to tradition, her oracular tripod was placed over a cleft (chasma) in the ground from which vapors with supernatural virtues rose. Excavations, however, have brought to light neither a fissure in the ground nor the cavern into which the Pythia descended (but it may be admitted that they might have disappeared as the result of earthquakes). The conclusion has been reached, a little too quickly, that the whole apparatus-chasma with vapors, descent of the Pythia into the corridor (the adyton)-is a comparatively recent mythical image.19 Yet the adyton existed, and, as Marie Delcourt shows (L'oracle de Delphes, pp. 227 ff.), the antiquity and telluric structure of Delphi implied a ritual "descent" into the underground regions. Since no natural cause that could bring on the trance has been found, autosuggestion by the Pythia or suggestions at a distance by the prophet have been supposed. But the fact is that we know nothing about it.
91. From" vision" to knowledge
The Apollonian "ecstasy," though sometimes brought on by inspiration (that is, possession) by the god, did not, however, imply the communion effected by Dionysian enthousiasmos (cf. §124). The

From "vision" to knowledge 273
ecstatics inspired or possessed by Apollo were known especially for their cathartic and oracular powers. (On the contrary, initiates into the mysteries of Dionysus, the bakchoi, never show any prophetic powers.) The shamanic character of certain semimythical personages, reputed to be, above all, worshipers of Apollo, has been observed. The Hyperborean Abaris, priest of Apollo, was endowed with oracular and magical powers (for example, bilocation). Herodotus (4. 36) writes that he "carried his famous arrow over the whole earth, fasting," but from the time of Heraclides (frag. 5Ic) it was held that Abaris flew on an arrow. Now the arrow, which plays a certain role in the mythology and religion of the Scythians, is present in Siberian shamanic ceremonies; 20 it is also preeminently the weapon of Apollo. Similar legends-involving ecstatic trances that can be confused with death, bilocation, metamorphoses, descents to the underworld, etc.-circulated in connection with other fabulous personages: Aristeas of Proconnesus, Hermotimus of Clazomenae, Epimenides of Crete, Pythagoras. As f017 Orpheus, the famous "prophet" of Apollo, his mythology abounded in shamanic exploits (see volume 2). As the Greeks knew him from the time of Homer, Apollo was, to be sure, much more than a patron god of ecstatics. Yet it is possible to discern a significant continuity between the two vocations-the shamanic and the Apollonian. Shamans are held to discover what is hidden and to know the future; visions, preeminently gifts of Apollo, bestow the same high powers on the god's worshipers. Just as in certain Siberian shamanic traditions, the visions given by Apollo stimulate the intelligence and incline to meditation; in the last analysis they lead to "wisdom." Walter Otto observed that obtaining any of the forms of occult knowledge "is always associated with a spiritual exaltation," 21 and this is true especially for shamanic ecstasy. This explains the capital importance of music and poetry in the two traditions. Shamans prepare for their trance by singing and drumming; the earliest Central Asian and Polynesian epic poetry had as its model the adventures of shamans on their ecstatic journeys. Apollo's principal attribute is the lyre; when he plays, he charms the gods, wild beasts, and even stones (Euripides, Alcestis 579 ff.; Apollonius of Rhodes 1. 740).
20. See the references in our Zalmoxis, p. 36, nn. 42-43. 21. W. Otto, The Homeric Gods, p. 72.



274 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
The bow, Apollo's second attribute, also forms part ofthe shamanic paraphernalia, but its ritual use goes beyond the sphere of shamanism; the symbolism of the bow is universally disseminated. Apollo is "he who darts from afar"; yet the same epithet is applied to Rama, the Buddha, and other heroes and fabulous personages. But the Greek genius brilliantly revalorized this archaic theme, just as it transfigured both the techniques of shamanism and its world of symbols. Thanks to Apollo, the symbolism of the bow and of archery reveals other spiritual situations: mastery over distance (and hence detachment from the "immediate," from the viscosity of the concrete), the calm and serenity implied by every effort ofintellectual concentration. In short, Apollo represents a new theophany, the expression of a religious knowledge of the world and human existence that is specifically Greek and unrepeatable. Heraclitus declared that "harmony is the result of a tension between contraries, like that of the bow and the lyre" (frag. 51). In Apollo the contraries are assumed and integrated into a new configuration, brol;lder and more complex. His reconciliation with Dionysus forms part of the same process of integration that made him the patron of purifications as the consequence of his murder of Python. Apollo reveals to humankind the way that leads from divinatory "vision" to thought. The demonic element, implicit in all knowledge of the occult, is exorcised. The supreme Apollonian lesson is expressed in the famous Delphic formula" Know thyself!" Intelligence, knowledge, wisdom are regarded as divine models, bestowed by the gods, first of all by Apollo. Apollonian serenity becomes, for the Greek, the emblem of spiritual perfection and hence of the spirit. But it is significant that the discovery of the spirit completes a long series of conflicts followed by reconciliations and the mastery of the ecstatic and oracular techniques.
92. Hermes," the companion of man"
Son of Zeus and the nymph Maia, Hermes is the least Olympian of the gods. He still retains certain attributes characteristic of the preHomeric divinities: he is still represented in ithyphallic form; he possesses a "magical rod," the caduceus, and the hat that confers invisibility; to immunize Odysseus against Circe's spells, he gives him



Hermes, "the companion of man" 275
the magical herb moly (Odyssey 1O. 302-6). What is more, Hermes loves to mingle with men. As Zeus puts it, "his dearest occupation is to be the companion of man" (Iliad 24. 334 ff.). But in his relations with human beings he behaves at once as a god, a "trickster," and a master artisan. He is the unrivaled giver of good things (Od. 8. 335): every lucky chance is said to be a gift of Hermes. On the other hand, he is the incarnation of everything implied by ruse and doubledealing. He is scarcely born before he steals the cattle of his brother, Apollo; that is why he became the companion and protector of thieves. Euripides calls him "Lord of those who go about their business by night" (Rhesus 216 ff.). But if he patronizes thefts and nocturnal amorous adventures, he is nonetheless the protectorofftocks and herds and of travelers belated on the roads. "There is not another god who shows such solicitude for herds and their growth," writes Pausanias (2. 3. 4). He is the god of roads, and it is from one of the heaps of stones (hermaion) found on the edges of traveled ways, that he received his name; every passerby threw a stone on the pile.22 In the beginning Hermes was probably a god who protected the nomadic herders, perhaps even a Master of Animals. But the Greeks interpreted the archaic attributes and powers of Hermes in a deeper sense. He rules the roads because he walks quickly (he has "golden sandals "), and he does not go astray at night because he knows the way. This is why he is at once guide and protector of herds and patron of thieves. It is also the reason for his becoming the messenger of the gods. It is probably the same attributes that made Hermes a psychopompos: he guides the dead in the beyond because he knows the way and can orient himself in the dark. But he is not a god of the dead, though the dying say that they are seized by Hermes. He does not hesitate to move about freely through the three cosmic levels, and he comes to no harm from it. If he accompanies souls to Hades, it is he, too, who brings them back to earth, as he did Persephone, Eurydice, or, in the Persians of Aeschylus (629), the soul of the Great King. Hermes' relations with the souls of the dead are also explained by his "spiritual" faculties. For his astuteness and his practical intelligence, his inventiveness (it is he who discovers fire), his ability to make

276 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
himself invisible and to travel everywhere in the twinkling of an eye already announce the marvelous accomplishments bestowed by wisdom, especially mastery of the occult branches of knowledge, which later, during the Hellenistic period, will become the particular characteristics of Hermes. He who finds his way in the dark, guides the souls of the dead, and moves about with the speed of lightning, both visibly and invisibly, reflects, in the last analysis, a modality of spirit: not only intelligence and guile but also gnosis and magic. After brilliantly analyzing Hermes' marvelous powers, W. Otto recognizes that "his world is not a heroic world" and concludes that "if his world is not noble ... , it is far from being vulgar and repugnant."23 This is true but inadequate. For what characterizes the figure of Hermes, already in the classical period, are his relations with the world of men, a world that is by definition open, constantly in process of being formed, that is, of being improved and exceeded. His first attributes-artfulness and inventiveness, mastery over darkness, interest in the activity of men, soul-guiding-will be continually reinterpreted and will end by making Hermes an ever more complex figure, at once civilizing hero, patron of knowledge, and paradigmatic image ofthe occult gnoses. Hermes is one of the few Olympian gods who will not lose his religious quality after the crisis of the "classical" religion and will not disappear with the triumph of Christianity. Assimilated to Thoth and Mercurius, he will enjoy a new popularity during the Hellenistic period and, as Hermes Trismegistus, will survive, through alchemy and hermeticism, into the seventeenth century. The Greek philosophers will already see in Hermes the logios, the personification of thought. He will be regarded as possessing all forms of knowledge, especially the secret gnosis; this will make him "the chief of all magicians," victorious over the powers of darkness, for "he knows all things and can do all things." 24 The episode in the Odyssey involving the marvelous herb moly will be continually allegorized, both by the Greeks and by Christian authors. In this plant, which saves Odysseus from the fate of his companions, changed into swine by Circe, there will be seen spirit in opposition to instinct, or the education that purifies the soul. And Hermes, identified by the

philosophers with the Logos, will be compared to Christ by the Church Fathers, in anticipation of the countless homologies and identifications made by the alchemists of the Renaissance (see volume 3).
93. The goddesses. I: Hera, Artemis
The privileged position accorded to Hera owes much to Homer, who emphasized the fact that she was consort to Zeus. Originally, Hera was the goddess of Argos; it is from there that her cult spread through the whole of Greece. Wilamowitz explains her name as the femine form of heros and as having the meaning despoina, "Our Lady." 25 It is difficult to decide whether the Achaeans brought the goddess with them or only her name. They were very probably impressed by the power and majesty of the Lady of Argos and so raised her to the rank of wife to their chief god,26 and perhaps it is for this reason that Hera became the symbol and patroness of the institution of marriage. Zeus's countless infidelities aroused her jealousy and brought on quarrels that are related at length by the poets and mythographers. Zeus behaved toward Hera as no Achaean chief would ever have dared to behave to his wife: he beat her and once even hung her up with a great weight tied to her feet, a torture later practiced on slaves.27 According to Hesiod (Theogony 923-24), Hera gave Zeus three children, Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia, and engendered Hephaestus all by herself (ibid. 926). Parthenogenesis, the power of self-fecundation, emphasizes the fact that even the most Olympian of the goddesses still retained her specifically Mediterranean and Asian character. It is difficult to determine the original meaning of the tradition according to which Hera renewed her virginity every year

What is significant is the fact that Homer and his audience could be amused by such brawls.

by bathing in the spring Canthus.28 Is it a symbol bound up with the patriarchal conception of marriage (for we know that virginity was highly esteemed in societies of the patriarchal type)? However this may be, the Greeks radically transformed the goddess of Argos. Yet it is still possible to make out some of her original characteristics. Like the majority of Aegean and Asian goddesses, Hera was a divinity not merely of marriage but of universal fecundity. Though the hypothesis of a Hera-Mother Goddess has been rejected by some scholars, it is difficult otherwise to explain the fact that there was mention of a hieros gamos with Zeus (mythical or reactualized in rituals) at a number of places (plataea, Euboea, Athens, Samos, etc.). This is the typical image of the union between a fecundating storm god and Mother Earth. In addition, Hera was worshiped at Argos as the "goddess of the yoke" and "rich in oxen." (In the Iliad Homer describes her as "ox-eyed.") Finally, she was considered to be the mother of terrifying monsters, such as the Hydra of Lerna. Now, giving birth to monsters is characteristic of telluric goddesses. Indeed, we have seen that, according to Hesiod, the mother of Typhon was Ge (Earth). But all these chthonian attributes and powers were gradually forgotten, and, from the time of Homer, Hera revealed herself as what she remained to the end: preeminently the goddess of marriage. The name of Artemis, documented in the form Artimis in an inscription found in Lydia, indicates her Oriental origin. The goddess's archaic character is obvious: she is above all, and uniquely, the Mistress of Wild Beasts (potnia theron, as she is called in Iliad 21. 470 if.); that is, she is at once an impassioned devotee of the hunt and the protector of wild animals. Homer also calls her Agrotera, "She of the Wild Beasts," and Aeschylus (frag. 342) "the Lady of Wild Mountains." She especially loves to hunt at night. The lion and the bear are her favorite and heraldic animals; this recalls the Asian prototypes. Homer (Iliad 5. 49) tells how Artemis taught Scamandrius the art of hunting every kind of game. But she becomes indignant when two eagles tear up and devour a hare still carrying her young (Aeschylus, Agamemnon 133 if.). Artemis is preeminently the virgin goddess. Originally this could

be understood as meaning that she was free from the yoke of matrimony. But the Greeks saw in her perpetual virginity indifference to love. The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (1. 17) recognizes the latter goddess's powerlessness. In Euripides' tragedy Hippolytus (line 1301) Artemis herself openly declares her hatred for Aphrodite. Yet she presents several elements of a mother goddess. In Arcadia, in her oldest cult site, she was associated with Demeter and Persephone. Herodotus (2. 156) states that Aeschylus regarded Artemis as the daughter of Demeter, that is, identified her with Persephone. Some Greek authors declare that in Crete she was called Britomartis,29 which indicates her connections with the Minoan goddess. It is probable that among her names in other languages mention must be made of Cybele in Thrace and Ma in Cappadocia. It is not known when and in what region she began to be known as Artemis. At Ephesus the maternal function was represented plastically-so grotesquely that we hesitate to recognize a Greek divinity in it. Artemis was venerated by women as Locheia, goddess of childbirth. She was also kourotrophos, "nurse" and teacher of boys. In some of her rituals, documented in the historical period, it is possible to decipher the heritage of the female initiation ceremonies of the Aegean societies of the second millennium. The dance in honor of Artemis of the Alpheus, like the dances in honor of the goddess throughout the Peloponnesus, were orgiastic in character. A proverb said: "Where has not Artemis danced?" In other words: where are there not dances for Artemis ?30 Under her many and sometimes contradictory aspects we divine the plurality of the archaic divine forms revalorized and integrated into a vast structure by the Greek religious genius. The ancient Lady of Mountains and Mistress of Wild Beasts of Mediterranean prehistory very soon assimilated the attributes and the revered powers of the mother goddesses, but without thereby losing her more archaic and more specific characteristics: patroness at once of hunters, wild animals, and girls. From the time of Homer her profile begins to define itself: Artemis governs the sacrality of wild life, which knows fertility and maternity but not love and marriage. She has always retained a paradoxical character, illustrated, above all, by the coexistence of contradictory themes (e.g., virginity-maternity).

The creative imagination of the Greek poets, mythographers, and theologians divined that such a coexistence of contraries can suggest one ofthe mysteries of divinity.
94. The goddesses. II: Athena, Aphrodite
Athena is certainly the most important Greek goddess after Hera. It has not been possible to explain her name by Greek. As for her origin, Nilsson's hypothesis, accepted by the majority of scholars, appears to be reasonably convincing: Athena was a Lady of the Palace, protectress of the fortified palaces of the Mycenaean princes; though a domestic goddess, connected with the occupations of men and women, her presence in the citadel during a period of wars and pillage gave her the attributes and powers of a martial goddess. She springs from the head of Zeus clad in her armor, brandishing her lance, and giving her war cry. Many of her titles proclaim this martial character: Promachos (the Championess), Stheneia (the Powerful), Areia (the Warlike), etc. However, as so many episodes of the Iliad show, Athena is the implacable enemy of Ares, whom she crushes in the famous battle of the gods in book 21 (390 ff.).31 On the contrary, she admires Heracles, the true model of the hero. She helps him in his superhuman ordeals and finally guides him to heaven (Pausanias 3. 18. 11, etc.). Athena likewise admired Tydeus and even wanted to make him immortal; but when she saw the hero, gravely wounded, split the skull of his enemy and swallow his brains, the goddess departed in disgust. 32 It is she again who, by her presence, restrains Achilles, ready, with his hand on his sword, to reply with it to Agamemnon's insults (Iliad 1. 194 ff.). Even in an epic composed for an audience that admired feats of arms, Athena reveals herself as other than a martial goddess. It is because war is preeminently a male activity that she takes part in it. For, as she says herself: "In all things my heart leans toward the

that" no Olympian is so hated," for" he thinks only of wars and battles" (II. 5. 890). 32. Bacchylides, frag. 41; Apollodorus, Bibl. 3. 6. 8. 3.

male, except for marriage" (Aeschylus, Eumenides 736). The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (1. 7-11) recognizes that the goddess oflove has no power over Athena. Homer and Hesiod call her Pallas, "the Maiden," and at Athens she is "the Virgin" (Parthenos). But she is a different type of virgin goddess from Artemis: she does not avoid men, does not keep them at a distance. Athena becomes the friend and protector of Odysseus, whom she admires for his strong personality and his wisdom: he is the man" of many counsels" (polymetis), who alone can be compared with Zeus (Iliad 2. 169, 407, 636). In the Theogony (896) Hesiod considers her" equal to her father in strength and' prudent wisdom." Athena is the only Olympian who has no mother. The Homeric Hymn to Athena (lines 4-5) briefly recalls that Zeus bore her from his own head, but it is Hesiod who recounts the whole myth: Zeus swallowed Metis, the goddess of intelligence, when she was already pregnant, and Athena came into the world by emerging through her father's skull (Theogony 886 ff.; cf. § 84). This episode has been considered a late addition; the original myth would simply have described the appearance of Athena on the summit of Mount Olympus. But Otto rightly emphasizes the archaic and "savage" nature of the swallowing theme.33 Whatever her origin may be, the myth of Athena's miraculous birth illustrates and confirms her very intimate relations with Zeus. "I am entirely on the father's side," she admits in the Eumenides (736). In the Odyssey (13. 297), she confides to Odysseus: "Among all the gods, I boast of my intelligence (metis) and my skill." And indeed metis, practical intelligence, is her most characteristic attribute. Athena is not only the patroness of the typically feminine arts of spinning and weaving. She is above all a "polytechnician," the inspirer and teacher of all kinds of specialized workers. It is from her that the smith learns to make the plowshare, and the potters i~voke her: "Come to us, Athena, hold thy hand above our kiln!" 34 It is she, the tamer of horses, who invents the bit and teache~ the use of chariots. When it comes to navigation, a domain properly ruled by Poseidon, Athena reveals the complexity, and at the same time the unity, of her metis. First she intervenes in the many technical

282 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
operations involved in building a ship. But she also helps the pilot "rightly to steer" his vessel.35 It is unusual to find an example of what we might call the sacrality of technical invention and the mythology of intelligence. Other divinities illustrate the countless forms of the sacrality of life, fertility, death, social institutions, etc. Athena reveals the sacred character or divine origin of certain crafts and vocations that involve not only intelligence, technical skill, practical invention but also self-mastery, serenity under trials, confidence in the consistency, and hence the intelligibility, ofthe world. It is not hard to understand how the patroness of metis will, in the period of the philosophers, become the symbol of divine knowledge and human wisdom. Aphrodite represents a no less remarkable creation of the Greek genius, even though it is on an entirely different level. The goddess is certainly of Oriental origin, as the tradition persistently indicates (Herodotus, 1. 105; Pausanias, 1. 14.7). In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the Trojans. In addition, she shows analogies with divinities of the type of Ishtar. However, it is at Cyprus, millennial center of Aegeo-Asian syncretism, that her characteristic figure begins to define itself (Odyssey 8. 362 ff.). The process of Hellenization is quite advanced in the Iliad (5. 365), where Homer announces that she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione and the wife of Hephaestus.36 But Hesiod preserved a more archaic version of her birth: the goddess issued from the foamy (aphros) semen that came from Uranus' sexual organs when they were thrown into the sea. Now, as we have seen (§ 46), the theme of the castration of a great god is of Oriental origin. In her cult, certain Asiatic elements (for example, hierodules) can be distinguished, side by side w;ith Mediterranean elements (the dove). On the other hand, the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite presents her as a true Mistress of Wild Beasts: "after her came gray wolves, fawning on her, and grim-eyed lions, and bears, and fleet leopards, ravenous for deer." But a new feature, peculiar to Aphrodite, is added: the goddess" put desire in their breasts, so that they all mated, two together, about the shadowy coombes" (trans. H. G. Evelyn

White, Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica, Loeb Library ed. [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1936]). Aphrodite "puts desire" into animals as well as into men and gods. She leads astray" even the reason of Zeus"; it is she who "easily makes him mate with mortal women, unknown to Hera" (ibid., lines 36, 40). Thus the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite identifies in the sexual urge the element of unity common to the three modes of existence: animal, human, and divine. On the other hand, by emphasizing the irreducible and irrational character of concupiscence, the Hymn justifies the amorous adventures of Zeus (which will, furthermore, be indefinitely repeated by gods, heroes, and men). In short, there is here a religious justification of sexuality; for, incited by Aphrodite, even sexual excesses and outrages must be recognized as of divine origin. Since she reigns on the three cosmic levels, Aphrodite is at once celestial (Asteria, Urania), maritime (Anadyomene, "risen from the sea"),37 and terrestrial (under her feet the roads are covered with flowers, andit is she who is the "first cause" of vegetable fertility [Aeschylus, Danaides frag. 44]). But Aphrodite will never become the preeminent goddess of fertility. It is physical love, fleshly union, that she inspires, praises, and defends. In this sense it may be said that, thanks to Aphrodite, the Greeks rediscovered the sacred nature of the original sexual urge. The vast spiritual resources of love will be ruled by other divine figures, first of all by Eros. Now it is precisely this irrational and irreducible sexuality that will be exploited by writers and plastic artists, and to such an extent that, in the Hellenistic period, the" Charms of Aphrodite" will become literary cliches. We are almost tempted to see, in this artistic flowering under the sign of Aphrodite, the radical desacralization of physical love. But in fact it is a camouflage, inimitable and rich in meanings, such as is found in so many other creations of the Greek genius. Under the appearance of a frivolous divinity is hidden one of the most profound sources of religious experience: the revelation of sexuality as transcendence and mystery. We shall meet with other forms of this type of camouflage when we analyze the process of desacralization of the modern world (see volume 3).

284 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
95. The heroes
Pindar distinguished three categories of beings: gods, heroes, and men (Second Olympian 1). For the historian of religions, the category of heroes raises certain important problems: what is the origin and ontological structure of the Greek heroes, and to what extent are they comparable to other types of beings intermediate between gods and men? In accordance with the belief of the ancients, Rohde held that the heroes" are closely related, on the one hand, to the chthonian gods, and, on the other, to dead men. In fact, they are nothing but the spirits of dead men, who live inside the earth, who live there eternally like the gods, and who came close to the latter in their power." 38 Like the gods, the heroes were honored by sacrifices, but the names and the procedures of these two categories of rites were different (see p. 287, below). On the other hand, in his work Gotternamen (1896), published three years after Rohde's Psyche, Usener maintained the divine origin of the heroes: like the demons, the heroes proceed from "momentary" or "particular" divinities (Sondergotter), that is, from divine beings specialized in specific functions. In 1921 Farnell proposed a compromise theory, which still has a certain reputation. According to this author, the heroes do not all have the same origin; he distinguishes seven categories of them: heroes of divine or ritual origin, personages who really lived (warriors or priests), heroes invented by poets or scholars, etc. Finally, in a rich and penetrating book, Gli eroi greci (1958), Brelich describes the "morphological structure" of the heroes as follows: they are personages whose death has something striking about it and who are closely connected with combats, athletic contests, prophecy and medicine, puberty initiations, and the Mysteries; they found cities, and their cult has a civic character; they are ancestors of consanguineous groups and are the "prototypical representatives" of certain fundamental human activities. The heroes are further characterized by singular, even monstrous, features and by an eccentric behavior that betrays their superhuman nature.39 In a summary formulation, it could be said that the Greek heroes

The heroes 285
share in an existential modality that is sui generis (superhuman, but not divine) and act in a primordial period-precisely, the period that follows the cosmogony and the triumph of Zeus (cf. §§ 83-84). Their activity takes place after the appearance of men but in a period of "beginnings," when structures were not always fixed and norms not yet duly established. Their own mode of being is an expression of the incomplete and contradictory character of the time of "origins." The birth and childhood of the heroes are different from the ordinary. They descend from the gods but are sometimes held to have a twofold paternity (thus Herac1es is the son of both Zeus and Amphitryon; Theseus, of Poseidon and Aegeus), or their birth is irregular (Aegisthus is the fruit of the incest between Thyestes and his own daughter). They are abandoned soon after birth (Oedipus, Perseus, Rhesus, etc.) and are nursed by animals,40 spend their youth traveling in distant countries, make themselves conspicuous by countless adventures (especially athletic and martial exploits), and contract divine marriages (among the most famous, those of Peleus and Thetis, Niobe and Amphion, Jason and Medea). The heroes are characterized by a specific form of creativity, comparable to that of the civilizing heroes of the archaic societies. Just like the Australian mythical ancestors, they alter the landscape, are believed to be autochthons (i.e., the first inhabitants of certain regions) and the ancestors of races, peoples, or families (the Argives descend from Argos, the Arcadians from Arcas, etc.). They inventthat is, "found," "reveal"-many human institutions: the laws of the city and the rules of urban life, monogamy, metallurgy, song, writing, tactics, etc., and are the first to practice certain crafts. They are preeminently founders of cities, and the historical personages who found colonies become heroes after death.41 In addition, the heroes establish athletic games, and one of the characteristic forms of their cult is the athletic contest. According to one tradition, the four great Panhellenic games were consecrated to the heroes before they belonged to Zeus. (The agonistic cult at Olympia, for example, was celebrated in honor of Pelops.) This explains the heroization of victorious and famous athletes.42
40. Paris is nursed by a bear, Aegisthus by a goat, Hippothous by a mare, etc. This initiatory motif is, of course, extremely widespread; cf. §105. 41. Brelich, Gli eroi greci, pp. 129-85. 42. As was Cleomedes in the Olympic Games of 496 (Pausanias 6. 9. 6).



286 THE OLYMPIANS AND THE HEROES
Certain heroes (Achilles, Theseus, etc.) are associated with initiation rites for adolescents, and the heroic cult is often performed by youths. Several episodes in the saga of Theseus are, in fact, initiatory ordeals; for example, his ritual dive into the sea (an ordeal equivalent to a journey into the beyond) and precisely into the submarine palace of the Nereids, fairies who are preeminently kourotrophoi; such, too, is Theseus' penetration of the labyrinth and his combat with the monster (the Minotaur)-a paradigmatic theme of heroic initiations; such, finally, was his abduction of Ariadne (one of the many epiphanies of Aphrodite), in which Theseus completes his initiation by a hierogamy. According to Jeanmaire, the ceremonies that made up the Theseia came out of archaic rituals that at an earlier period had marked the return of the adolescents to the city after their initiatory stay in the bush.43 Similarly, certain moments in the legend of Achilles can be interpreted as initiatory ordeals: he was brought up by the Centaurs, that is, he was initiated in the bush by Masters who were masked or who showed themselves in animal forms; he underwent passing through fire and water, classic initiatory ordeals; and he even lived for a time among girls, dressed as a girl, in accordance with a custom typical of certain archaic puberty initiations. 44 The heroes are also associated with the Mysteries: Triptolemus has a sanctuary, and Eumolpus his tomb, at Eleusis (Pausanias, 1. 38. and 1. 38. 2). In addition, the cult of heroes is bound up with oracles, especially with rites of incubation to effect a cure (Calchas, Amphiaraus, Mopsus, etc.); hence certain heroes (first of all, Asclepius) have relations with medicine.45 A characteristic feature of heroes is the manner of their death. Exceptionally, certain heroes are transported to the Isles of the Blessed (Menelaus), to the mythical island of Leuce (Achilles), to Olympus (Ganymede), or disappear underground (Trophonius, Amphiaraus). But the immense majority suffer a violent death in war (like the heroes of whom Hesiod tells, fallen before Thebes or Troy), in single combat, or by treachery (Agamemnon murdered by Clytemnestra, Laius by Oedipus, etc.). Often their death is singularly

dramatic: Orpheus and Pentheus are torn to pieces, Actaeon is killed by dogs, Glaucus, Diomedes, Hippolytus by horses; or they are devoured, or struck dead by Zeus, or bitten by a snake (Orestes, Mopsus, etc.).46 Yet it is their death that confirms and proclaims their superhuman condition. If they are not immortal like the gods, the heroes differ from men by the fact that they continue to act after their death. The remains of heroes are laden with redoubtable magico-religious powers. Their tombs, their relics, even their cenotaphs operated on the living for long centuries. In a sense it could be said that heroes approach the divine condition by virtue of their death: they enjoy an unlimited postexistence, which is neither larval nor purely spiritual but consists in a survival sui generis, since it depends on the remains, the traces, or the symbols of their bodies. Indeed, contrary to the general custom, the remains of heroes were buried inside the city; they were even admitted into the sanctuaries (Pelops in the temple of Zeus at Olympia, Neoptolemus in that of Apollo at Delphi). Their tombs and cenotaphs formed the center of the heroic cult, involving sacrifices accompanied by ritual laments, mourning rites, tragic choruses. (The sacrifices offered to heroes were like those performed for the chthonian gods, and differed from the sacrifices offered to the Olympians. Victims were slaughtered with their throats toward the sky for the Olympians, with their throats bent toward the earth for the chthonian gods and the heroes. For the Olympians the victim had to be white, but it was black for the heroes and the chthonians, and the sacrificed victim was burned entirely-no living man must eat of it. The type of the altars to the Olympians was the classic temple, above ground and sometimes on an elevation; for the heroes and the chthonians it was a low hearth, an underground cave, or an adyton, which perhaps represented a tomb. The sacrifices for the Olympians were performed during the sunny morning, those for the heroes and the chthonians in the evening or the middle ofthe night.)47 All these facts bring out the religious value of the heroic death and the remains of the hero. By dying, the hero becomes a tutelary genius who protects the city from invasions, epidemics, and all kinds of

calamities. At Marathon, Theseus was seen fighting at the head of the Athenians (plutarch, Theseus 35. 5; see other examples in Brelich, Gli eroi greci, pp. 91 ff.). But the hero also enjoys an immortality of a spiritual order, the immortality conferred by glory, the perpetuity of his name. He thus becomes a paradigmatic model for all those who strive to exceed the ephemeral condition of the mortal, to save their names from final oblivion, to survive in the memory of men. The heroization of real persons-the kings of Sparta, the fallen at Marathon or Plataea, the Tyrannicides-is explained by their unusual exploits, which separate them from the rest of mortals and project them into the category of heroes.48 Classical Greece, and especially the Hellenistic period, left us a "sublime" vision of the heroes. In reality their nature is exceptional and ambivalent, even aberrant. The heroes prove to be at once good and bad and accumulate contradictory attributes. They are invulnerable (Achilles) and yet end by being slain; they are distinguished by their strength and beauty but also by monstrous characteristics (gigantic stature-Herac1es, Achilles, Orestes, Pelops-but also stature much shorter than the average) ;49 or they are theriomorphic (Lycaon, the "wolf") or able to change themselves into animals. They are androgynous (Cecrops), or change their sex (Teiresias), or dress like women (Herac1es). In addition, the heroes are characterized by numerous anomalies (acephaly or polycephaly; Herac1es has three rows of teeth); they are apt to be lame, one-eyed, or blind. Heroes often fall victim to insanity (Orestes, Bellerophon, even the exceptional Herac1es, when he slaughtered his sons by Megara). As for their sexual behavior, it is excessive or aberrant: Herac1es impregnates the fifty daughters of Thespius in one night; Theseus is famous for his numerous rapes (Helen, Ariadne, etc.); Achilles ravishes Stratonice. The heroes commit incest with their daughters or their mothers and indulge in massacres from envy or anger or often for no reason at all: they even slaughter their fathers and mothers or their relatives. All these ambivalent and monstrous characteristics, these aberrant forms of behavior, suggest the fluidity of the time of "origins," when the "world of men" was not yet created. In this primordial period, irregularities and abuses of all kinds (that is, everything that will later be denounced as monstrosity, sin, or crime) directly or in

The heroes 289
directly spur on the work of creation. However, it is after the heroes' creations-institutions, laws, techniques, arts-are effected that there arises the "world of men," where infractions and excesses will be forbidden. After the age of the heroes, in the new" world of men," the creative age, the illud tempus of the myths, is definitely ended. The excesses of the heroes have no limits. They dare to violate even goddesses (Orion and Actaeon assail Artemis, Ixion attacks Hera, etc.) and do not stop short of sacrilege (Ajax assaults Cassandra near the altar of Athena, Achilles kills Troilus in the temple of Apollo). These offenses and sacrileges denote an inordinate hybris, a specific characteristic of the heroic nature (see § 87). The heroes confront the gods as ifthey were their equals, but their hybris is always, and cruelly, punished by the Olympians. Only Heracles manifests his hybris with impunity (when he threatens the gods Helios and Oceanus with his weapons). But Heracles is the perfect hero, the "hero-god," as Pindar calls him (Third Nemean 22). Indeed, he is the only hero whose tomb and relics are unknown; he conquers immortality by his suicide-apotheosis on the pyre, he is adopted by Hera and becomes a god, sitting among the other divinities on Olympus. It could be said that Heracles obtained his divine condition in consequence of a series of initiatory ordeals from which he emerged victorious, unlike Gilgamesh (cf. § 32) and certain Greek heroes, who, despite their limitless hybris, failed in their efforts at immortalization. Figures comparable to the Greek heroes are also found in other religions. But it is only in Greece that the religious structure of the hero received so perfect an expression; it is only in Greece that the heroes enjoyed a considerable religious prestige, nourished imagination and reflection, and inspired literary and artistic creativity.50

12 The Eleusinian
Mysteries
96. The myth: Persephone in Hades
" Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries !" exclaims the author of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. "But he who is uninitiate and who has no part in them, never has lot of like good things once he is dead, down in the darkness and gloom" (lines 480-82; trans. H. G. Evelyn-White, Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1936]). The Hymn to Demeter relates both the central myth of the two goddesses and the founding of the Eleusinian Mysteries. While she was gathering flowers on the plain of Nysa, Kore (Persephone), Demeter's daughter, was carried off by Pluto (Hades), god of the underworld. Nine days Demeter searched for her, and during all that time she did not touch ambrosia. Finally, Helios told her the truth: it was Zeus who had decided to marry Kore to his brother Pluto. Overcome with grief, and infuriated with the king of the gods, Demeter did not go back to Olympus. In the guise of an old woman she traveled to Eleusis and sat down by the Well of the Maidens. Questioned by the king's daughters, she said that her name was Doso and that she had just escaped from pirates, who had carried her off from Crete by force. She accepted their invitation to bring up the infant son of the queen, Metaneira, and demanded kyke6n, a mixture made from meal, water, and pennyroyal. Demeter did not nurse Demophoon but rubbed him with ambrosia and at night hid him "like a brand" in the fire. The child became more and more like a god, for in fact Demeter wanted to make him immortal and eternally young. But one night Metaneira found her son in the fire and began to lament. "Witless are you mortals, and



The myth: Persephone in Hades 291
dull to foresee your lot, whether of good or of evil!" Demeter exclaims (line 256). Henceforth, Demophoon can no longer escape death. Then the goddess reveals herself in all her splendor, a brilliant light shining from her body. She demands that" a great temple and an altar below it" be built for her, where she will teach her rites to human beings (304 ff.). Then she leaves the palace. As soon as the sanctuary was built, Demeter retired inside it, wasting away with yearning for her daughter. It was then that she brought on a terrible drought, which ravaged the earth (304 ff.). Zeus vainly sent messengers begging her to return among the gods. Demeter answered that she would not set foot on Olympus, and would not let vegetation grow, until she had seen her daughter again. Zeus had to ask Pluto to bring Persephone back, and the lord of Hades submitted. However, he succeeded in putting a pomegranate seed into her mouth and making her swallow it: this ensured Persephone's annual return to her husband for four months.1 After recovering her daughter, Demeter consented to rejoin the gods, and the earth was miraculously covered with verdure. But before she returned to Olympus, the goddess revealed her rites and taught all her mysteries to Triptolemus, Diocles, Eumolpus, and Celeus"awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice" (478 ff.). The Hymn to Demeter reports two types of initiations; more precisely, the text explains the foundation of the Eleusinian Mysteries both by the reunion of the two goddesses and as a result of the failure of the attempt to immortalize Demophoon. The history of Demophoon can be compared with the ancient myths relating the tragic error that, at a certain moment of primordial history, annulled the possibility of man's immortalization. But in this case there is neither error nor "sin" on the part of a mythical ancestor, who thereby loses his original immortal condition for himself and his descendants. Demophoon was not a primordial personage; he was the last-born son of a king. And Demeter's decision to immortalize him can be interpreted as her desire to adopt a child (who will console her for the loss of Persephone) and, at the same time, as her revenge against Zeus and the Olympians. Demeter was in the process of transforming a man into a god. Goddesses had this power of granting immortality

to human beings. and fire. the "cooking" of the neophyte, was reckoned among the most effective means. Surprised by Metaneira, Demeter did not hide her disappointment at the stupidity of men. But the hymn makes no reference to the possible later generalizing of this technique of immortalization, that is, the establishment of an initiation capable of transforming men into gods by means of fire. It was after the failure of her attempt to immortalize Demophoon that Demeter revealed her identity and demanded that a sanctuary be built for her. And it was not until after she had found her daughter again that she taught her secret rites. Initiation of the "mystery" type differs radically from the initiation interrupted by Metaneira. The initiate into the Eleusinian Mysteries did not obtain immortality. At a certain moment a great fire lit up the sanctuary of Eleusis. But though some examples of cremation are known, it is not probable that fire played a direct part in the initiations. The little that we know about the secret ceremonies indicates that the central mystery involved the presence of the two goddesses. Through the initiation, the human condition was modified, but in a different way from the unsuccessful transmutation of Demophoon. The few ancient texts that refer directly to the Mysteries emphasize the postmortem bliss of the initiated. The expression "Happy is he among men ... " of the Hymn to Demeter returns like a leitmotiv. "Happy he who has seen this before descending underground!" exclaims Pindar. "He knows the end of life! He also knows its beginning!" (Threnoi, frag. 10). "Thrice happy those among mortals who, having seen those Mysteries, will go down to Hades; only they can have true life there; for the rest, all there is evil" (Sophocles, frag. 719 Dindorf, 348 Didot). In other words, as the result of the things seen at Eleusis, the soul of the initiate will enjoy a blissful existence after death; it will not become the mournful fallen shade, without memory and strength, so feared by the Homeric heroes. The only reference to agriculture in the Hymn to Demeter is the statement that Triptolemus was the first initiate into the Mysteries. Now according to the tradition, Demeter sent Triptolemus to teach agriculture to the Greeks. Some authors have explained the terrible drought as a consequence of the descent to Hades of Persephone, goddess of vegetation. But the hymn states that the drought was brought on by Demeter much later, precisely when she retired into the sanctuary which had been built for her at Eleusis. We may



The initiations: Public ceremonies and secret rituals 293
suppose, with Walter Otto, that the original myth told of the disappearance of vegetation but not of wheat; for before Persephone was carried off, wheat was not known. Numerous texts and figurative monuments bear witness to the fact that wheat was procured by Demeter after the drama of Persephone. So we can here decipher the archaic myth that explains the creation of cereals by the "death" of a divinity (§ 11). But, sharing the condition of the Olympian immortals, Persephone could no longer "die," like the divinities of the dema or Hainuwele type (cf. §12) or the gods of vegetation. The old mythico-ritual scenario, continued and developed by the Eleusinian Mysteries, proclaimed the mystical solidarity between the hieros gamos, violent death, agriculture, and the hope of a happy existence beyond the grave.2 In the last analysis, the rape-that is, the symbolic death-of Persephone had great consequences for humanity. As the result of it, an Olympian and benevolent goddess temporarily inhabited the kingdom of the dead. She had annulled the unbridgeable distance between Hades and Olympus. Mediatrix between the two divine worlds, she could thereafter intervene in the destiny of mortals. Using a favorite expression of Christian theology, we could say: felix culpa! Just so, the failed immortalization of Demophoon brought on the shining epiphany of Demeter and the foundation of the Mysteries.
97. The initiations: Public ceremonies and secret rituals
According to tradition, the first inhabitants of Eleusis were Thracians. The most recent archeological excavations have made it possible to reconstruct a great part of the history of the sanctuary. Eleusis appears to have been colonized about 1580-1500, but the first sanctuary (a chamber with two interior pillars supporting the roof) was built in the fifteenth century; and it is in the fifteenth century, too, that the Mysteries were inaugurated (Mylonas, Eleusis, p. 41).
2. When, in the fourth century B.C., Isocrates wanted to praise the merits of the Athenians, he reminded his hearers that it was in their country that Demeter had granted her most important gifts: agriculture, by which "man rises above the beasts," and initiation, which brings hope in regard to "the end of life and all eternity" (Panegyricus 28).



294 THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES
The Mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis for nearly two thousand years; probably certain ceremonies were altered in the course of time. The constructions and reconstructions made from the time of Pisistratus indicate the vigor and growing prestige of the cult. The nearness and protection of Athens certainly contributed to placing Eleusis at the very center of Panhellenic religious life. The literary and figurative document~tion refers more particularly to the first stages of the initiation, which did not demand secrecy. Thus artists could represent Eleusinian scenes on vases and bas-reliefs, and Aristophanes (Frogs 324 if.) allowed himself to allude to some aspects of the initiation.3 This comprised several degrees. There were the Lesser Mysteries, the rites of the Greater Mysteries (the teletai), and the final experience, the epopteia. The true secrets of the teletai and the epopteia have never been divulged. The Lesser Mysteries were usually celebrated once a year, in spring, during the month of Anthesterion. The ceremonies took place at Agrae, a suburb of Athens, and included a series of rites (fasts, purifications, sacrifices) performed under the direction of a mystagogue. Probably certain episodes of the myth of the two goddesses were reactualized by the aspirants to initiation. The Great Mysteries were also celebrated once a year, in the month of Boedromion (September-October). The ceremonies continued for eight days, and "all those who had pure hands" and spoke Greek, including women and slaves, had the right to take part, provided they had gone through the preliminary rites at Agrae in the spring. On the first day, the festival took place in the precinct of the Eleusinium of Athens, to which, the evening before, the sacred objects (hiera) had been solemnly brought from Eleusis. On the second day, the procession went to the sea. Each aspirant, accompanied by his teacher, carried with him a young pig, which he washed in the sea and sacrificed on his return to Athens. On the next day, in the presence of the people of Athens and other cities, the king-archon (archon basileus) and his wife performed the great sacrifice. The fifth day marked the culminating point of the public ceremonies. An enormous procession set out from Athens at dawn. The neophytes, their teachers,

Can the Mysteries be known? 295
and many Athenians accompanied the priestesses who carried back the hiera. Toward the end of the afternoon the procession crossed a bridge over the Cephissus, where masked men hurled insults at the most important citizens.4 At nightfall, with lighted torches, the pilgrims entered the outer court of the sanctuary. Part of the night was devoted to dances and songs in honor of the goddesses. On the following day the aspirants fasted and offered sacrifices, but as for the secret rites (the teletai) we are reduced to hypotheses. The ceremonies that took place in front of and inside the telesterion were probably connected with the myth of the two goddesses (Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 262 ff.). We know that the mystai, torch in hand, imitated the wanderings of Demeter in search of Kore by torchlight. 5 We shall presently discuss the efforts made to penetrate the secret of the teletai. We will add that certain ceremonies included the legomena, brief liturgical formulas and invocations whose content we do not know but which were of considerable importance; this is why initiation was forbidden to those who did not speak Greek. We know almost nothing about the rites performed during the second day spent at Eleusis. Probably that night brought the culminating act of the initiation, the supreme vision, the epopteia, accessible only to those who had been initiates for a year. The next day was devoted especially to rites and libations for the dead, and on the day after that-the ninth and last day-the mystai returned to Athens.
98. Can the Mysteries be known?
In their efforts to pierce the secrecy of the teletai and the epopteia, scholars have made use not only of the references found in the authors of antiquity but also of some information transmitted by Christian apologists. The data supplied by the latter must be examined with caution; however, they cannot be ignored. Since Foucart, much has often been made of a passage of Themistius, cited by Plutarch and preserved by Stobaeus, in which the experiences

296 THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES
of the soul immediately after death are compared to the ordeals of the initiate in the Greater Mysteries: at first, he wanders in darkness and undergoes all sorts of terrors; then, suddenly, he is struck by a marvelous light and discovers pure regions and meadows, hears voices, and sees dances. The mystes, a crown on his head, joins the "pure and holy men"; he beholds the uninitiated, huddled together in mud and fog, sunk in their wretchedness through fear of death and mistrust of bliss in the beyond (Stobaeus 4, p. 107 Meineke). Foucart considered that the rituals (dromena, "things done") similarly involved a peregrination in darkness, various terrifying apparitions, and the sudden entrance of the mystes into a lighted meadow. But the testimony of Themistius is late and reflects Orphic conceptions.6 Excavations of the sanctuary of Demeter and of the telesterion have shown that there were no underground chambers in which the mystai could ritually descend to Hades.7 There have also been attempts to reconstruct the initiation ritual on the basis of the secret formula, the synthema or password of the mystai, transmitted by Clement of Alexandria (Protrepticus 2. 21. 2): "I fasted, I drank the kykeon; I took from the chest [kiste]; after manipulating, I placed in the basket, then, removing from the basket, I replaced in the chest." Some authors hold that only the first two propositions belong to the Eleusinian formula. And indeed, they refer to well-known episodes: Demeter's fast and her drinking the kykeon. The rest of the synthema is enigmatic. Several scholars have believed that they have identified as the contents of the chest and basket a replica of the womb, or a phallus, or a snake, or cakes in the shape of genital organs. No hypothesis is convincing. It is possible that the receptacles contained objects that were relics from archaic times, bound up with a sexual symbolism characteristic of agricultural societies. But at Eleusis Demeter revealed a different religious dimension from those manifested in her public cult. Moreover, it is difficult to admit that such a ritual was also performed by the children who were being initiated. Then too, if the ritual to
6. Foucart, Mysteres, pp. 392 if. In Phaedo 69c Plato maintains that the punishments of sinners in Hades and the image of the meadow of the righteous were introduced by Orpheus, who had been inspired by Egyptian funerary customs. 7. This does not exclude the presence of infernal symbolism, for there was a cave-a temple of Pluto-which designated the entrance to the otherworld, and there was probably an omphalos there; see Kerenyi, Eieusis, p. 80.



Can the Mysteries be known? 297
which the synthema refers is interpreted by the symbolism of a mystical birth or rebirth, the initiation ought to have been completed at that moment. In that case, it is hard to understand the meaning, and the necessity, of the final experience, the epopteia. In any event, the testimonies concerning the hiera hidden in the receptacles indicate their solemn presentation, not their manipulation. So it is probable, as G. H. Pringsheim, Nilsson, and Mylonas maintain, that the synthema refers to ceremonies documented very much later, during the Hellenistic period, in honor of Demeter (see Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 300 ff. and note 39). It has been supposed that the mystai partook of a sacramental meal, which is plausible. In that case, the meal took place at the beginning, after the drinking of the kyke6n, that is, before the telete proper. Another ritual has been deduced from an indication by Proclus (Ad Timaeum 293c): the mystai looked skyward and cried "Rain!", they looked toward the earth and exclaimed" Conceive!" Hippolytus (Philosophumena 5. 7. 34) states that these two words constituted the great secret of the Mysteries. We certainly have here a ritual formula connected with the hieros gamos typical of the vegetation cults; but if it was uttered at Eleusis, it was not secret, for the same words appear in the inscription for a well near the Dipylon gate of Athens. A quite surprising piece of information has been transmitted to us by Bishop Asterius. He lived about 440, when Christianity had become the official religion of the empire, which is to say that the author no longer feared denials on the part of pagan writers. Asterius speaks of an underground passage, wrapped in darkness, where the solemn meeting between the hierophant and the priestess took place, of torches extinguished, and of the "vast crowd who believe that their salvation depends on what those two do in the darkness."8 But no underground chamber (katabasion) has been found in the telesterion, though the excavations have everywhere reached the rock. It is more likely that Asterius was referring to the Mysteries performed in the Hellenistic period in the Eleusinium at Alexandria. In any case, if the hieros gamos really existed, it is difficult to understand why Clement-after speaking of Eleusiscalled Christ "the true hierophant."

298 THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES
In the third century Hippolytus added two other pieces of information to the dossier (Philosophumena 5.38-41). He states that the epoptai were shown, "in solemn silence," an ear of wheat. Hippolytus adds that "during the night, in the midst of a brilliant fire celebrating the great and inexpressible Mysteries, the hierophant cries out: 'Holy Brimo has borne a sacred child, Brimos!' that is: the Powerful One [feminine] has given birth to the Powerful One [masculine]." The solemn presentation of an ear of wheat seems doubtful, since the mystai were supposed to bring ears of wheat with them and especially since ears of wheat are engraved on numerous monuments at Eleusis itself. Certainly, Demeter was the goddess of wheat, and Triptolemus was present in the mythico-ritual scenario of Eleusis. But it is difficult to believe that the revelation of a fresh ear constituted one of the great secrets of the epopteia, unless we accept the interpretation of Walter Otto, who speaks of a "miracle" peculiar to the Eleusinian Mysteries: "The ear of wheat growing and maturing with a supernatural suddenness is just as much a part of the mysteries of Demeter as the vine growing in a few hours is part of the revels of Dionysus" (The Homeric Gods, p. 25). Yet Hippolytus states that the cut ear was regarded by the Phrygians as a mystery that was later borrowed by the Athenians. So it is possible that the Christian author transposed to Eleusis what he knew about the Mysteries of Attis (a god whom, according to Hippolytus, the Phrygians called "the fresh ear of wheat "). As for the vocables" Brimo" and" Brimos," they are probably of Thracian origin. Brimo especially designates the queen of the dead; hence her name can be applied to Kore and Hecate as well as to Demeter. According to Kerenyi, the hierophant proclaimed that the goddess of death had borne a son in the fire. 9 In any case, it is known that the final vision, the epopteia, took place in a dazzling light. Several ancient authors speak of the fire that burned in the small building, the Anactoron, the flames and smoke from which, escaping through an opening in the roof, were visible from a distance. In a papyrus from the time of Hadrian, Heracles addresses an initiate: "I was initiated long ago [or: elsewhere] ... [I have beheld] the fire ... [and] I have seen Kore" (see Kerenyi, pp. 83-84). According

to Apollodorus of Athens, when the hierophant invoked Kore he struck a bronze gong, and the context implies that the kingdom of the dead burst open (Otto, The Homeric Gods, p. 27).
99. "Secrets" and "Mysteries"
It may be accepted that the epiphany of Persephone and her reunion with her mother constituted the central episode of the epopteia and that the decisive religious experience was inspired precisely by the presence of the goddesses. We do not know how this reunion was realized or what took place afterward. Nor do we know why such a vision was believed to make a radical change in the postmortem situation of the initiates. But there can be no doubt that the epoptes perceived a divine secret, which made him "familiar" to the goddesses; he was in some way" adopted" by the Eleusinian divinities.1o The initiation revealed both closeness to the divine world and continuity between life and death. These are certainly ideas shared by all archaic religions of the agricultural type but suppressed by the Olympian religion. The "revelation" of the mysterious continuity between life and death reconciled the epoptes to the ineluctability of his own death. The initiates into the Eleusinian Mysteries do not form a "church" or a secret association comparable to the Mysteries of the Hellenistic period. When they returned home, the mystai and the epoptai continued to take part in the public cults. In fact, it is not until after death that the initiates come together again, separated from the crowd ofthe uninitiated. From this point of view, the Eleusinian Mysteries, after Pisistratus, can be regarded as a religious system that complemented the Olympian religion and the public cults without, however, opposing the traditional religious institutions of the city. The chief contribution of Eleusis was soteriological in nature, and that is why the Mysteries were accepted and very soon patronized by Athens.
10. Guthrie (The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 292-93) refers to an episode in the Axiochus, a dialogue wrongly attributed to Plato, in which Socrates assures Axiochus that he must not fear death; on the contrary, since he has been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, he has become a relative (gennetes) of the gods. Guthrie regards this text as proof of divine adoption. But the term gennetes rather indicates fidelity, i.e., "thou who art one of the goddesses' faithful followers." But this, of course, does not exclude the idea of spiritual kinship.



300 THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES
Demeter was the most popular among the goddesses worshiped in all the regions of Greece and the Greek colonies. She was also the oldest; morphologically, she continued the Great Goddesses of the Neolithic. Antiquity also knew other Mysteries of Demeter, the most famous being those of Andania and Lycosura. We will add that Samothrace (initiation center for the northern countries-Thrace, Macedonia, Epirus) was famed for the' Mysteries of the Cabiri and that, from the fifth century, Athens saw the celebration of the Mysteries of the Thraco-Phrygian god Sabazius, the first of the Oriental cults to make its way ,into the West. In other words, the Eleusinian Mysteries, despite their incomparable prestige, were not a unique creation of the Greek religious genius; they found their place in a larger system, concerning which we are, unfortunately, poorly informed. For these Mysteries, like those of the Hellenistic period too, presupposed initiations that had to remain secret. The religious and, in general, the cultural value of "secrecy" has as yet been inadequately studied. All the great discoveries and inventions-agriculture, metallurgy, various techniques, arts, etc.implied, in the beginning, secrecy, for it was only those" initiated" into the secrets of the craft who were believed able to guarantee the success of the operation. With time, initiation into the arcana of certain archaic techniques became accessible to the whole community. However, the various techniques did not entirely lose their sacred character. The example of agriculture is especially instructive; some millennia after its dissemination in Europe, agriculture still preserved a ritual structure, but the "craft secrets," that is, the ceremonies intended to insure an abundant harvest, were now universally accessible by means of an elementary "initiation." It may be admitted that the Eleusinian Mysteries were bound up with an agricultural mystique, and it is probable that the sacrality of sexual activity, vegetable fertility, and food at least partly shaped the initiatory scenario. In this case we must suppose the implicit presence of half-forgotten sacraments, which had lost their original meaning. If the Eleusinian initiation made possible such primordial experiences, which revealed the mystery and the sacrality of food, sex, procreation, ritual death, Eleusis rightly deserved its fame as a holy place and a source of miracles. However, it is difficult to believe that the supreme initiation was confined to an anamnesis of archaic sacraments. Eleusis had certainly discovered a new religious dimen



"Secrets" and" Mysteries" 301
sion. The Mysteries were famous above all for certain "revelations" concerning the two goddesses. Now such revelations demanded secrecy as a condition sine qua non. The procedure was the same in the various initiations documented in archaic societies. What is unique about the Eleusinian secrecy is the fact that it became a paradigmatic model for Mystery cults. The religious value of secrecy will be extolled in the Hellenistic period. The mythologization of initiatory secrets and their hermeneutics will later encourage countless speculations, which will end by shaping the style of a whole period. "Secrecy even increases the value of what is learned," writes Plutarch (On the Life and Poetry of Homer 92). Medicine and philosophy are both held to possess initiatory secrets, which different authors compare to aspects of Eleusis.ll In the days of the Neo-Pythagoreans and Neo-Platonists, one of the cliches most employed was precisely the enigmatic style of the great philosophers, the idea that the masters revealed their true doctrine only to initiates. This current of ideas finds its best support in the secrecy of Eleusis. The majority of modern critics allow little importance to the allegorical or hermeneutic interpretations proposed by many authors of late antiquity. Yet despite their anachronism, such interpretations are not without philosophical and religious interest; in fact, they continue the efforts of earlier authors to interpret the Eleusinian Mysteries without, at the same time, betraying their secret. In the last analysis, besides the central role that the Eleusinian Mysteries played in the history of Greek religiosity, they indirectly made a significant contribution to the history of European culture, and notably to interpretations of initiatory secrecy. Its unique prestige ended by making Eleusis a symbol of pagan religiosity. The burning of the sanctuary and the suppression of the Mysteries mark the official end of paganism (see volume 2). This, of course, does not imply the disappearance of paganism but merely its occultation. As for the" secret" of Eleusis, it continues to haunt the imagination of seekers.

13 Zarathustra and the
Iranian Religion
100. The enigmas
The study of Iranian religion is full of surprises, even of disappointments. We approach the subject with the most lively interest, for we have learned beforehand of the Iranian contribution to the religious formation of the West. If the conception of linear time, replacing the notion of cyclical time, was already familiar to the Hebrews, a number of other religious ideas were discovered, revalorized, or systematized in Iran. To mention only the most important: the articulation of several dualistic systems (cosmological, ethical, religious dualisms); the myth of the savior; the elaboration of an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good and universal salvation; the doctrine of the resurrection of bodies; very probably, certain Gnostic myths; finally, the mythology of the Magus, reelaborated during the Renaissance, both by the Italian Neo-Platonists and by Paracelsus or John Dee. However, as soon as the nonspecialist reader approaches the sources, he is disappointed and thwarted. Three-fourths of the old Avesta is lost. Among the texts that have been preserved, only the giithas, presumably composed by Zarathustra, have the power to fascinate the nonspecialist. But an understanding of these enigmatic poems has not yet been attained with certainty. The rest of the present Avesta, and especially the Pahlavi books redacted between the fourth and ninth centuries, are characterized by their dryness, their disheartening monotony, and their platitude. Readers of the Vedas and the Upanishads, even readers of the Briihma1)as, cannot fail to be disappointed. Yet the ideas that can occasionally be deciphered in the giithiis, or



The enigmas 303
that are found, elaborated and systematized, in the later scriptures, are absorbing. But they are buried in a hodgepodge of ritual texts and commentaries. Except for the giithiis-the reading of which, despite their obscurities, is always rewarding-one is seldom seized by the power of the language, the originality of the images, the revelation of a profound and unexpected meaning. As for the personal contribution of Zarathustra to the invention or revalorization of these religious conceptions, the opinions of Iranianists differ and tend to be mutually exclusive. Essentially, it is a matter of two historiographic points of view. According to the one, Zarathustra is a historical personage, a reformer of the traditional ethnic religion, that is, the religion that was shared by the IndoIranians in the second millennium B.C. According to the other, the religion of Zarathustra represents only one aspect of the Iranian religion, i.e., Mazdaism, whose center is the worship of Ahura Mazda, and the authors who take this methodological position not only hold that there was no "reform" by the "prophet" Zarathustra; they deny even his historicity. As we shall see in a moment, the problem of the historicity of Zarathustra ought not to constitute a difficulty. It was normal for the historical personage Zarathustra to be transformed into a paradigmatic model for the believers who made up the "Mazdean religion." After a few generations the collective memory can no longer preserve the authentic biography of an eminent personage; he ends by becoming an archetype, that is, he expresses only the virtues of his vocation, illustrated by paradigmatic events typical of the model he incarnates. This is true not only of Gautama Buddha or Jesus Christ but also of far less influential personages, such as Marko Kraljevic or Dieudonne de Gozon. But there are times when the giithiis, regarded by most scholars as the work of Zarathustra, contain some autobiographical details that confirm their author's historicity. They are, furthermore, the only such details; they survived the process of mythicization, active throughout the Mazdean tradition, because they were an integral part of the hymns composed by Zarathustra. It is proper to use these few biographical details for a preliminary sketch of Zarathustra's life and religious activity. We will later give the corrections and supplements that seem to be required by the results of recent research. It has been proposed that Zarathustra's activity should be placed



304 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
between 1000 and 600 B.C. If the Mazdean tradition, which speaks of "258 years before Alexander," is accepted, Zarathustra's life can be placed between 628 and 551 B.C.1 The earlier dates have been proposed in view of the archaic character of the language of the giithas, especially of its analogies with the Vedas. Linguistic analysis allows the conclusion that the prophet lived in the eastern part of Iran, probably in Chorasmia or Bactria.2 According to tradition, he was a zaotar (Yast 33. 16), that is, a sacrificing priest and chanter (cf. Sanskrit hot,), and his giithiis take their place in an old Indo-European tradition of sacred poetry. He belonged to the clan named Spitama (" of the brilliant attack "), breeders of horses; his father's name was Pourusaspa (" of the spotted horse "). Zarathustra was married, and the names of his two children are known, the younger being his daughter Pourucista (Yasna 53. 3). He was poor. When, in a famous giithii, he begs for the help and protection of Ahura Mazda, he exclaims: "I know, 0 Wise One, why I am powerless: it is for my few flocks and because I have few men" ( Yasna 46. 2). The community to which he addressed his message was made up of sedentary herders with chiefs, called kavi, and priests called karapan, "murmurer," and usig, "sacrificer." It is these priests, guardians of the traditional Aryan religion, whom Zarathustra did not hesitate to attack in the name of Ahura Mazda. The reaction soon made itself felt, and the prophet had to flee. "To what land shall I flee?" he exclaims. "Where flee, where go? I am separated from my tribe and my family; neither the village nor the wicked chiefs of the land are favorable to me" (Yasna 46. 1). He took refuge with Vishtaspa, chief of the Fryana tribe, whom he succeeded in
1. Very probably the formula "258 years before Alexander" refers to the conquest of Persepolis (330 B.C.), which put an end to the empire of the Achaemenids. Zarathustra's first success, the conversion of King Vishtaspa, took place when the prophet was forty years of age. The traditional chronology (" 258 years before Alexander"), accepted by the majority of investigators (see

converting, and who became his friend and protector (46. 14; 15. 16). Yet the resistance did not weaken, and in the giithiis Zarathustra publicly denounces some of his personal enemies: Bandva, who "is always the chief obstacle" (49. 1-2), and "the little prince Vaepya," who "at the Bridge of Winter offended Zarathustra Spitama by refusing him a halting place, him and his draught animals shivering with cold when they came to his house" (51. 12). It is possible to decipher in the giithiis a few indications of Zarathustra's missionary activity. The prophet is surrounded by a group of friends and disciples, variously called the "poor" (drigu) , the "friends" (frya), the "knowing" (vidva), the "confederates" (urvatha).3 He urges his companions to "take arms to drive away" the enemies, the "wicked one" (Yasna 31. 18). This Zarathustrian cohort is opposed by the" men's societies," with their device aesma, "fury." It has been possible to show the equivalence of these Iranian secret societies with the groups of young Indian warriors, the Maruts, whose leader, Indra, is called adhrigu, that is "not-dhrigu" (" he who is not poor ").4 Zarathustra violently attacks those who sacrifice bovines (32. 12, 14; 44.20; 48. 10); such blood rituals were characteristic of the cult of the men's societies.
101. The life of Zarathustra: History and myth
These indications, few and allusive as they are, fall far short of constituting the elements of a biography. Marjan Mole has attempted to show that even these scattered references to apparently real persons and events do not necessarily reflect historical realities; Vishtaspa, for example, represents the model of the initiate. Yet the historicity of Zarathustra appears not only from the allusions to concrete persons and events (the little prince Vaepya, who, "at the Bridge of Winter," refused him shelter, etc.), but also from the authentic and passionate nature of the giithiis. We are struck, furthermore, by the urgency and existential tension with which Zarathustra questions his Lord: he asks him to teach him the secrets of the

cosmogony, to reveal his future to him, but also the fate of certain persecutors and of all the wicked. Each strophe of the celebrated Yasna 44 is introduced by the same formula: "This is what I ask you, Lord-answer me well!" Zarathustra wants to know "who assigned their road to the sun and the stars" (3), "who fixed the earth below, and the sky of clouds, so that it does not fall" (4); and his questions concerning the Creation follow one another in an ever faster rhythm. But he wants to know, too, how his soul, "arrived at the Good, will be ravished?" (8), and" how shall we get rid of evil" (13), "how shall I deliver evil into the hands of justice?" (14). He demands that "visible marks" shall be given him (16) and, above all, that he shall be united with Ahura Mazda and that his "word shall be efficacious" (17). But he adds: "Shall I obtain in payment, through Justice (Arta), ten mares, with a stallion, and a camel that have been promised me, 0 Wise One?" (1-8). Be does not forget to question the Lord about an immediate punishment of "him who does not give his wage to him who has deserved it," for he already knows the punishment "that awaits him in the end" (19). The punishment of the wicked, the rewarding of the virtuous, obsess Zarathustra. In another hymn he asks, "What penalty is provided for him who procures empire (khshathra, 'power, potency') for the wicked evildoer?" (Yasna 31. 15). Elsewhere he exclaims: "When shall I learn if you have power, 0 Wise One (Mazda) with Justice (Arta), over each ofthose who threaten me with destruction?" (48. 9). He is impatient at seeing the members of the men's societies continuing to sacrifice bovines and consume haoma with impunity: "When wilt thou strike this filthy liquid?" (48. 10). He hopes that he can renew "this life" (30. 9) and asks Ahura Mazda if the just will conquer the wicked now (48.2; see further on). Sometimes we feel that he is hesitant, troubled, humble, wanting to know the Lord's will more concretely: "What dost thou command? What wouldst thou have as praise, as worship?" (34. 12). It would be difficult to justify the presence, in the most venerable part of the Avesta, of so many concrete details if they did not represent recollections of a historical personage. It is true that mythological elements abound in the later legendary biographies of the Prophet, but, as we have just recalled, this is a well-known process: the transformation of an important historical personage into a paradigmatic model. One hymn (Yast 13) extols the birth of the



The life of Zarathustra: History and myth 307
Prophet in messianic terms: "At his birth and during his growth water and plants rejoiced, at his birth and during his growth water and plants grew" (13.93 if.). And it announces: "Henceforth the good Mazdean religion will spread over the seven continents" (13. 95).5 The late texts dwell at length on Zarathustra's celestial preexistence. He was born at the "midpoint of history" and at the "center of the world." When his mother received the xvarenah of Zarathustra, she was enveloped in a great light. "For three nights the sides of the house appeared as if made of fire." 6 As for the substance of his body, created in heaven, it fell with the rain and brought forth the plants eaten by the two heifers belonging to the Prophet's parents; the substance passed into their milk, which, mixed with haoma, was drunk by his parents: they united for the first time, and Zarathustra was conceived.7 Before his birth Ahriman and the devs (=daevas) tried in vain to cause his death. Three days before he came into the world, the village shone so brightly that the SpiHimides, thinking it was on fire, abandoned it. On their return, they found a child radiating light. According to tradition, Zarathustra came into the world laughing. He was scarcely born before he was attacked by the devs, but he routed them by uttering the sacred formula of Mazdaism. He emerged victorious from the four ordeals, whose initiatory character is obvious (he was thrown on a pyre, into a den of wolves, etc.).8 It would serve no purpose to continue. Zarathustra's ordeals, victories, and miracles follow the paradigmatic scenario of the savior in the process of being divinized. To be stressed is the insistent repetition of the two motifs characteristic of Mazdaism: supernatural light and combats against demons. The experience of mystical light and ecstatic "vision" are also documented in ancient India, where they will have a great future. As for the combats with demons, that is to say, against the forces of evil, it constitutes, as we shall see, the essential duty of every Mazdean.

308 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
102. Shamanic ecstasy?
To return to Zarathustra's original message, a question at once arises: is it to be sought only in the giithas, or is it permissible to use the later Avestan scriptures? There is no way to prove that the giithiis have brought us Zarathustra's whole doctrine. In addition, a number of later texts, even quite late ones, refer directly, though developing them, to concepts expressed in the giithiis. And it is well known that the elaboration of a religious idea first documented in late texts does not necessarily imply that the concept is a new one. What is essential is to elucidate the type of religious experience characteristic of Zarathustra. Nyberg believed that he could compare it to the typical ecstasy of the Central Asian shamans. His hypothesis was rejected by the majority of scholars, but Widengren has recently presented it in more moderate and more convincing terms.9 He cites the traditions according to which Vishtaspa used hemp (bhang) to obtain ecstasy: while his body lay asleep, his soul traveled to paradise. In addition, in the Avestan tradition, Zarathustra himself was believed to "give himself over to ecstasy." It is in trance that he would have had his visions and heard the word of Ahura Mazda.10 On the other hand, it is probable that song played an important part in the cult, if we take the name of paradise, garo demana, to mean "house of song." It is known that some shamans reach ecstasy by singing for a long time, yet not every cult system employing song is to be considered shamanic. It is also possible to see parashamanistic elements in the scenario elaborated around the Cinvat Bridge (see below, §111) and also the shamanic structure of Artay Virar's journey to heaven and hellY However, the few allusions to a specifically shamanic initiation-involving dismemberment of the body and renewing the viscera-are found only in late texts that may reflect foreign influences (Central Asian, or deriving from Hellenistic syncretism, especially the Mystery religions).12

The revelation of Ahura Mazda 309
It may be admitted that Zarathustra was familiar with the IndoIranian shamanic techniques (also known to the Scythians and the Indians of the Vedic period), and there seems to be no reason to suspect the tradition that explains Vishtaspa's ecstasy by hemp. But the ecstasies and visions documented in the giithiis and elsewhere in the Avesta do not show a shamanic structure. Zarathustra's visionary emotionality brings him close to other religious types. In addition, the Prophet's relations with his Lord, and the message that he never ceases to proclaim, have nothing of the" shamanic" style. In whatever religious milieu Zarathustra grew up, whatever the role of ecstasy in his conversion and that of his first disciples may have been, shamanic ecstasy does not playa central part in Mazdaism. As we shall very soon see, the Mazdean "mystical experience" is the result of a ritual practice illuminated by eschatological hope.
103. The revelation of AhOla Mazda: Man is free to choose good or evil
Zarathustra receives the revelation of the new religion directly from Ahura Mazda. By accepting it, he imitates the primordial act of the Lord-the choice of Good (see Yasna 32.2), and he asks nothing else of his disciples. The essence of the Zoroastrian reform consists in an imitatio dei. Man is called to follow the example of Ahura Mazda, but he is free in his choice. He does not feel that he is the slave or the servant of God (as the worshipers of VaruQ.a, Yahweh, Allah admit themselves to be). In the giithiis Ahura Mazda holds the first place. He is good and holy (spenta). He created the world by thought (Yasna 31. 7.11), which is equivalent to a creatio ex nihilo. Zarathustra declares that he "recognized" Ahura Mazda "by thought," "as the first and the last" (31. 8), that is, as the beginning and the end. The Lord is accompanied by an escort of divine beings (the Amesha Spentas): Asha (Justice), Vohu Manah (Good Thought), Armaiti (Devotion),
ordeals, "molten metal was poured on his chest and grew cold there," and "his body was cut with knives, the interior of his belly appeared, blood flowed; but
then he passed his hand over it and was healed" (Ztitspram, 22. 12-13, trans. Mole, p. 334). These are specifically shamanic feats.



310 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
Xshathra (Kingdom, Power), Haurvatat and Ameretat (Integrity [health] and Immortality).13 Zarathustra invokes and praises these Entities together with Ahura Mazda, as in this gatha: "Wise Lord most powerful, Devotion, Justice making the living prosper, Good Thought, Kingdom, hear me: Have pity on me when retribution comes to each" (33. 11; see also the following strophes). Ahura Mazda is the father of several Entities (Asha, Vohu Manah, Armaiti) and of one ofthe twin Spirits, Spenta Mainyu (the Beneficent Spirit). But this implies that he also engendered the other twin, Angra Mainyu (the Destroying Spirit). In the beginning, it is stated in a famous gathii (Yasna 30), these two spirits chose, one of them good and life, the other evil and death. Spenta Mainyu declares, at the "beginning of existence," to the Destroying Spirit: "Neither our thoughts nor our doctrines, nor our mental powers; neither our choices, nor our words, nor our acts; neither our consciences, nor our souls are in agreement" (45. 2). This shows that the two spiritsthe one holy, the other wicked-differ rather by choice than by nature.
Zarathustra's theology is not dualistic in the strict sense of the term, since Ahura Mazda is not confronted by an anti-god; in the beginning, the opposition breaks out between the two Spirits. On the other hand, the unity between Ahura Mazda and the Holy Spirit is several times implied (see Yasna 43.3, etc.). In short, Good and Evil, the holy one and the destroying demon, proceed from Ahura Mazda; but since Angra Mainyu freely chose his mode of being and his maleficent vocation, the Wise Lord cannot be considered responsible for the appearance of Evil. On the other hand, Ahura Mazda, in his omniscience, knew from the beginning what choice the Destroying Spirit would make and nevertheless did not prevent it; this may mean either that God transcends all kinds of contradictions or that the existence of evil constitutes the preliminary condition for human freedom. Where we are to look for the prehistory of such a theology is clear; it is in the different mythico-ritual systems of bipartitions and polarities, alternations and dualities, antithetical dyads and coincidentia oppositorum-systems that accounted at once for the cosmic rhythms and the negative aspects of reality and, first and foremost,

The revelation of Ahura Mazda 311
for the existence of evil. But Zarathustra confers a new religious and moral meaning on this immemorial problem. It is in the few verses of the giithiis that there lie the seeds of the countless later elaborations that have given Iranian spirituality its specific characteristics. The primordial separation between good and evil is the consequence of a choice, inaugurated by Ahura Mazda and repeated by the Twin Spirits, who respectively chose Asha (Justice) and Drug (Deceit). Since the daevas, the gods of the traditional Iranian religion, chose Deceit, Zarathustra demands that his disciples no longer worship them and, first of all, give up sacrificing bovines to them. Respect for the bovine plays a considerable part in the Mazdean religion. A reflection of the conflict between sedentary cultivators and nomads has been seen in this fact. But the antinomy proclaimed by Zarathustra goes beyond, at the same time that it includes, the social plane. It is a part of the Aryan national religious tradition that is rejected. Zarathustra places among the sinners Yima, son of Vivahvant, "who to flatter our people caused them to eat pieces of beef" (Yasna 32. 8). In addition, as we have just seen, the Prophet asked Ahura Mazda when he would destroy those who practiced the haoma sacrifice (48. 10). However, recent research has shown that the haoma ritual, together with the cult of Mithra, was not entirely condemned by Mazdaism, not even in the giithiis.14 In addition, animal sacrifices were practiced without interruption, at least for the benefit of laymen.15 It seems, therefore, that Zarathustra primarily opposed the excesses of the orgiastic rites, which involved countless blood sacrifices and the immoderate absorption of haoma. As for the epithet" herdsman" applied to Zarathustra, it does not refer, as has been maintained, to the duty of every Mazdean to protect and take good care of cattle. The metaphorical expressions "shepherds" and "flocks," documented throughout the ancient Near East and in ancient India, refer to chieftains and their SUbjects. The" cattle" of which Zarathustra is the" herdsman" means those men who practice the Good Religion.1s

312 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
These corrections and revisions make possible a better understanding of the contribution made by Mazdaism to the religious history of Iran. Indeed, it is known that, despite his "reform," Zarathustra accepted many traditional religious beliefs and ideas, at the same time giving them new values. Thus, he takes up again the Indo-Iranian tradition of the journey of the dead but stresses the importance of the judgment: each will be judged by the choice that he has made on earth. The just will be admitted into paradise, into the" House of Song" ; as for the sinners, they will remain" forever the guests of the House of Evil" (Yasna 46. 11). The road to the beyond passes over the Cinvat Bridge, and it is there that the sorting of the just from the wicked takes place. Zarathustra himself announces the fateful crossing, when he will lead those who have worshiped Ahura Mazda: "With them all I shall cross the Bridge of the Sorter! " (46. 10).
104. "Transfiguration" of the world
The Prophet does not doubt that the daevas will be annihilated and that the just will triumph over the wicked. But when will it take place, this victory of Good that will radically renew the world? He implores Ahura Mazda: "Teach me that which thou knowest, Lord: Even before the coming of the punishments that thou hast conceived,
o Wise One, will the just conquer the wicked? For it is in that, as we know, that the reform of existence consists" (Yasna 48. 2). It is the transfiguration of existence that Zarathustra awaits: "Give me this sign: the total transformation of this existence. So that, worshiping you and praising you, I attain to the greatest joy" (34. 6). "Make known the pattern that will cure existence!" he cries (44. 16). He insists: "What retribution thou dost destine for the two sides,
o Wise One, by thy bright fire and by molten metal, give a sign of it to souls, to bring harm to the wicked, advantage to the just" (51. 9). It is probable that Zarathustra had hoped for the imminent "transfiguration" (fraso-kereti) of the world. "May we be those who will renew this existence!" he exclaims (Yasna 30. 9).17 Several times
17. Mole and Gnoli have cogently brought out the immediate renovation of the world as the result of sacrifices (yasna) performed by the priests.



" Transfiguration" of the world 313
he calls himself saosyant, the "savior" (48.8; 46.3; 53.2; etc.), a notion that will later give rise to a fabulous mythology. The eschatological ordeal by fire and molten metal that he announces (see also 30. 7; 32. 7) had as its objective both the punishment of the wicked and the regeneration of existence. As has happened more than once in history, the expectation of judgment and renewal of the world is progressively projected into an eschatological future that can be variously calculated. But it is important to emphasize the new interpretation given by Zarathustra to the idea of renewal. As we have seen (§ 21) and shall see again (§106), various mythico-ritual scenarios for the renovation of the world were known in the Near East, both by the Indo-Iranians and by other peoples. The ritual, which reiterated the cosmogony, was celebrated on the occasion of the New Year. But Zarathustra impugns this archaic sceI,lario, whose purpose was the annual regeneration of the world, and announces a radical and definitive "transfiguration," effected once and for all. Furthermore, the renovation will no longer be obtained by performing
~ cosmogonic ritual but by the will of Ahura Mazda. This renovation includes the judgment of each being and implies the punishment of the wicked and the rewarding of the just (§ 112). If the giithiis are the work of Zarathustra-and this is the nearly unanimous opinion of scholars-it is allowable to conclude that the Prophet did his utmost to abolish the archaic ideology of the cosmic cycle periodically regenerated, and proclaimed the imminent and irrevocable eschaton, decided and brought about by Ahura Mazda. In short, the point of departure for Zarathustra's preaching is the revelation of the omnipotence, holiness, and goodness of Ahura Mazda. The Prophet receives the revelation directly from the Lord, but it does not found a monotheism. What Zarathustra proclaims, and gives as a model to his disciples, is the choice of God and the other divine Entities. By choosing Ahura Mazda, the Mazdean chooses good over evil, the true religion over that of the daevas. Hence every Mazdean must fight against evil. No toleration is allowed in respect to the demonic forces incarnated in the daevas. This tension will very soon harden into dualism. The world will be divided into the good and the evil and will end by resembling a projection, on all cosmic and anthropological levels, of the opposition between the virtues and their contraries. Another opposition is barely indicated but will have a great future in Iranian speculation:



314 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
that between the spiritual and the material, between thought and the "bony world" (see Yasna 28. 2). The spiritual, and in a sense "philosophical," nature of the religion of Zarathustra is striking.18 The transmutation of the most important Aryan divinities into Amesha Spentas (the Blessed Holy Ones), who make up Ahura Mazda's escort, and the fact that each of these Entities comprises an abstract value (Order, Power, Devotion, etc.) at the same time that it governs a cosmic element (fire, metal, earth, etc.), denote at once creative imagination and a capacity for rigorous reflection. By associating the Amesha Spentas with him, Zarathustra succeeds in defining the way in which Ahura Mazda intervenes in the world and also makes it clear how the Lord, through his "archangels," can help and support his worshipers. The fact that the Prophet calls his God "wise," that he magnifies the importance of "truth," that he continually extols "good thought," only accentuates the newness of his message: he emphasizes the function and religious value of wisdom, that is, of science, of accurate and useful knowledge. To be sure, it is not a matter of abstract science in the modern sense of the term but of a creative thought that discovers and at the same time creates the structures of the world and the universe of values that is their correlative. From this point of view, Zarathustra's speculative effort may be compared with the meditations and discoveries of the sages depicted in the Upanishads, who radically transformed the Vedic conception of the world and human existence (§ 80). But the comparison with the r~is of the Upanishads becomes still more convincing when we observe the initiatory and eschatological character of Mazdean "wisdom." Certainly, being a private religion (like Vedism and Brahmanism), Mazdaism allowed the development of an esoteric dimension, which, though not forbidden, was nevertheless not accessible to all believers. Yasna 48. 3 mentions "secret doctrines." The initiatory and eschatological character is evident in the cult that Zarathustra proposes in place of the traditional sanguinary and frantic rites. The cult is so spiritual that even the term "sacrifice" (yasna) is equivalent, in the gatMs, to the term
18. This aspect of the religion of Zarathustra also corresponds to the image that Greek antiquity conceived of him: philosopher (according to Aristoxenes, Pythagoras was his disciple), Magus, master of initiation, author of Hermetic and alchemical treatises.



" Transfiguration" of the world 315
"thought."19 When Ahura Mazda approached him "as Good Thought" and asked him, "To whom would you address your worship?" Zarathustra replied, "To thy fire!"; and he added, "By making it the offering of veneration, I desire to think as much as I can of Justice!" (Yasna 43. 9). Sacrifice is the occasion, or more precisely the" support," of a theological meditation. And whatever interpretations were given later by the priests, it is significant that the fire altar became, and remained, the religious center of Mazdaism. As for the eschatological fire as Zarathustra conceived it, despite its retributive function, it purifies and spiritualizes the world. But the function of the cult is still greater. According to a recent interpretation,20 by means of the rite (yasna) the officiant acquires the condition of maga; that is, he enjoys an ecstatic experience that brings illumination (Cisti). During this illumination the priest-sacrificer succeeds in separating his spiritual essence (menok) from his corporal nature (getik); in other words, he recovers the condition of purity and innocence that preceded the "mixing" of the two essences. Now, this mixing took place as the result of Ahriman's attack. Hence the sacrificer contributes to the restoration ofthe primordial situation, to the transfiguration (fraso-kereti) of the world, the work ofredemption inaugurated by the paradigmatic priest Zarathustra. It could even be said that the sacrificer already shares in the transfigured world.21 The state of maga is obtained primarily by the haoma sacrifice, the sacrifice of the "drink of immortality," which the priest imbibes during the ceremony.22 Now haoma is rich in xvarenah, the sacred fluid, at once igneous, luminous, vivifying, and spermatic. Ahura Mazda is preeminently the possessor of xvarenah, but this divine "flame" also springs from the forehead of Mithra (Yast 10. 127) and, like a solar light, emanates from the heads ofsovereigns.23 However,

316 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
every human being possesses his xvarenah, and on the day of transfiguration, i.e., of the final Renovation, "the great light seeming to come from the body will burn continually on this earth." 24 By ritually absorbing haoma the sacrificer surpasses his human condition, comes close to Ahura Mazda, and anticipates in concreto the universal Renovation. It is difficult to determine if this eschatological conception of the cult was already completely formulated in Zarathustra's time. But it was certainly implicit in the function of sacrifice among the IndoIranians. From their particular point of view, the authors of the Briihmar.zas shared a similar conception: the world was periodically restored, i.e., "re-created," by the unlimited power of sacrifice. But the eschatological function of the cult in Mazdaism unites, so to speak, the supreme exaltation of sacrifice, realized by the Briihmar.zas, with the initiatory gnosis and visionary "illumination" of the Upanishads. In Iran, as in Brahmanic India, sacrificial technique and eschatological gnosis were cultivated by a religious elite and constituted an esoteric tradition. Insofar as the few episodes concerning the use of hemp by Zarathustra's disciples corresponded to a real situation,25 they can be compared to the situation in ancient India, for there, too, we find a number of ecstatics using certain stupefacients, side by side with ascetics, visionaries, yogins, and contemplatives (see §§ 78 ff.). But the trances and ecstasies brought on by stupefacients played a small part in the Indian religions. Similarly, the earliest Zoroastrianism, so imperfectly reflected by the giithiis, seems to give first place to" wisdom," to inner "illumination" in the presence of the sacrificial fire. According to tradition, Zarathustra was killed at the age of seventy-seven by the Turanian Bratvarxsh in a fire temple. A late source adds that the murderers were disguised as wolves.26 The legend admirably expresses the meaning of Zarathustra's destiny, for the "wolves" were the members of the Aryan men's societies, so courageously stigmatized by the Prophet. But the process of mythicization continued for at least fifteen

centuries. We mentioned above some examples of the apotheosis of Zarathustra in the Mazdean tradition (§ 101). In the Hellenistic world Zoroaster is exalted as the paradigmatic Magus, and it is always as "Magus" that he is evoked by the philosophers of the Italian Renaissance. Finally, reflections of his most beautiful myth are found in Goethe's Faust.
105. The religion of the Achaemenids
The opposition between Ahura Mazda and the daevas was already taking shape in the Indo-Iranian period, since Vedic India opposed the devas to the asuras. But there is a difference; in India the religious values of the two groups evolved in a direction contrary to that in Iran: the devas became the "true gods," triumphing over the class of more archaic divinities, the asuras, who in the Vedic texts are regarded as "demonic" figures (§ 65). A similar process, though inversely oriented, took place in Iran; there the ancient gods, the daevas, were demonized (§ 65). We can define the direction in which this transmutation took place: it was above all the gods of the warrior's function-Indra, Saurva, Vayu-who became daevas. None of the asura gods was demonized. What corresponded in Iran to the great proto-Indian asura, VaruI).a, became Ahura Mazda. Zarathustra probably played a part in this process. But the advancement of Ahura Mazda to an exalted position is not Zarathustra's doing. Considered Supreme God, or simply a Great God among other great gods, Ahura Mazda was venerated in the Iranian countries before Zarathustra. He is found under that name in inscriptions ofthe Achaemenid kings. For years an intense controversy has divided scholars on the subject of the Zoroastrianism of Darius and his successors. Against the Zoroastrianism of the Great Kings, the following arguments, among others, are brought forward: Zarathustra is not named in any inscription; terms and names as important as spenta, Angra Mainyu, and the Amesha Spentas (except Arta) are absent; then too, the religion of the Persians at the time of the Achaemenids, as described by Herodotus, has nothing Zoroastrian about it. In favor of the Zoroastrianism of the Achaemenids, the name of the great god Ahuramazda, glorified in the inscriptions, is cited, together with the



318 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
fact that when, under Artaxerxes I (465--425), the new calendar was introduced, featuring the names of the Zoroastrian Entities, the
reform aroused no opposition.27 However this may be, if the Achaemenids were not Zoroastrians, their theology was on the same plane as that of the giithiis: it abounds in abstract expressions, comparable to those of the giithiis, and it is "laden with moral considerations."28 In addition, as Marjan Mole points out, we must not expect of a king the actions and formulas of priests; he does not perform a liturgy but accomplishes concrete acts; now this accomplishment is jrasa, a term that expresses "what is good, what constitutes man's happiness, what allows the king to exercise his faculties." 29 In the first inscription that Darius causes to be engraved at Naqs-i-Rustam, near Persepolis, Ahuramazda is extolled as "a great god, who created this earth, who created yonder sky, who created man, who created happiness for man, who made Darius king, one king of many, one lord of many." 30 The inscription dwells on the creativity of Ahuramazda and-it might almost be said in consequence-on the religious responsibility of the sovereign. It is to maintain the creation of Ahuramazda and to insure "happiness for man" that Darius was made king. This privileged religious situation is justified by the myth of the founding of the Achaemenid dynasty. According to Herodotus 1. 107-17, after two dreams, which the Magi interpreted as bad omens for his throne, Astyages, king of the Medes, married his daughter to a Persian (hence a man of inferior race) named Cambyses, and when she bore a son, Cyrus, Astyages ordered that he be killed. But the child was saved and brought up by the wife of a herdsman,

The Iranian king and the New Year festival 319
Mithradates.31 Cyrus grew up to adolescence among the young herdsmen, but his princely bearing betrayed him and his identity was discovered. Finally, after many adventures, he triumphed over the Medes, dethroned his grandfather, and founded the Achaemenid empire. The mythical theme of the exposed and persecuted hero is found among many peoples. For our purpose, the following motifs are important: (a) the ordeals undergone by Cyrus, beginning with his exposure, are equivalent to an initiation of the military type ; (b) symbolically, the future king is-or becomes-the son of the god Mithra (Mithradates, his adoptive father's name, means "gift of Mithra"); (c) after his victory over the king of the Medes, Cyrus founds an empire and a new dynasty; (d) this is as much as to say that he created a new world and inaugurated a new era-in other words, he accomplished a microcosmogony; (e) since the cosmogony was ritually repeated on the occasion of the New Year, it is legitimate to suppose that the mythico-ritual scenario of the foundation of the dynasty was made part of the Nawroz ceremonies.
106. The Iranian king and the New Year festival
Darius conceived and built Persepolis as a sacred capital, reserved for the celebration of the New Year festival, the Nawroz.32 In fact, Persepolis was not a political capital, had no strategic importance, and, unlike Pasargadae, Ecbatana, Susa, and Babylon, is not mentioned in any Western or Eastern source.33 The Nawroz, like every ritual scenario ofthe New Year, renewed the world by symbolic repetition of the cosmogony. The conception was familiar to the Indo-Iranians; however, it is probable that, under the Achaemenids,
31. According to Justin 1. 4, the herdsman found the exposed infant being suckled by a bitch (a characteristic feature of myths of sovereign heroes). Now Herodotus reports that Mithradates' wife was named Spako, that is, in the Median language, "bitch"; cf. Widengren, "La legende royale," p. 226. 32. R. Girshman, "A propos de Persepolis," pp. 265, 277; see also A. U. Pope, "Persepolis, a Ritual City." 33. Not even Ctesias, who had spent thirty years at the court of the Great King, mentions Persepolis, which indicates the esoteric value of that sacred city; cf. K. Erdmann, "Persepolis," pp. 46-47. In fact, the Western world did not learn of the existence of Persepolis until the city was destroyed by Alexander the Great.



320 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
the scenario had also undergone Mesopotamian influences.34 In any case, the New Year festival took place under the aegis of Ahuramazda, hieratically represented on several gates at Persepolis. In a wide geographical zone, and from a certain historical moment, the cosmogony (and, indeed, all other forms of "creation" and "foundation") involved the victorious combat of a god or a mythical hero with a marine monster or a dragon (cr., for example, Indra-Vrtra, Baal-Yam, Zeus-Typhon, etc.). It has been possible to show that a similar scenario existed among the Vedic Indians and in ancient Iran,35 though in this last case the sources are late and present the myth in strongly historicized form. And in fact the fight of the hero Thraetona against the dragon Azi Dahaka, to which the Avesta refers (Yast 9.145; 5. 34; 19.92 fr.), is recounted by Firdausi as the struggle of King Faridun ( < Freton < Thraetona) against a foreign usurper, the dragon AZdahiik, who had captured and
married the two sisters of the legitimate sovereign, Jamsed « Yima Xsaeta). Faridun-like Thraetona-emerges victorious, kills the dragon, and delivers (and in turn marries) the two captive princesses. Now late traditions add that it was on New Year's Day that the king conquered Azdahiik.36 The Iranian heroes and kings are credited with having killed dragons (cr., for example, the legend of Ardashir), a motif that is, in any case, very widespread and to which we shall return. We add that, in Iran as elsewhere, the process of historicization of mythical themes and personages is counterbalanced by a contrary process: the real adversaries of the nation or the empire are imagined as monsters, and especially as dragons.37 What it is important to bear in mind for the moment is the fact that the Iranian king was responsible for the preservation and regeneration of the world, in other words, that on the plane proper to him he fought against the forces of evil and death and contributed to the triumph of life, fecundity, and Good. Zarathustra looked for universal regeneration by means of the Good Religion. In the last analysis, every Zoroastrian priest believed that by his sacrifices he anticipated the eschatological transfiguration. What the kings

accomplished, in the beginning and annually, the priest hoped to realize annually-and the Saoshyant will effect it definitively at the time of the final Renovation. We do not know if, in the period of the Achaemenids, there was a conflict or a secret tension between the two religious ideologies, royal and sacerdotal. King Vishtaspa's friendship for the Prophet could constitute a paradigmatic model. But the confrontation will become explicit later, under the Sassanids. The phenomenon is also known elsewhere: Prince Siddharta became the Buddha, and his soteriology replaced that of the Brahmans.
107. The problem of the Magi. The Scytbians
As it spread westward, Zoroastrianism encountered other types of religion and underwent their influences. Similarly, the Mazdaism of the Achaemenids did not remain unchanged. Xerxes, son of Darius, forbade the cult of the daevas throughout his kingdom-which brings him still closer to the religion of Zarathustra. But later, and precisely from the time of the inscriptions of Artaxerxes II (405-359), Mithra and AnahiHi. appear beside Ahuramazda. Now, as we shall see, a similar syncretism manifests itself in the late Avesta, where the same gods' names are cited beside Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas.38 No less the subject of controversy is the problem of the Magi and their relations with Zoroastrianism. They have been regarded, for example, as an aboriginal tribe of sorcerers and necromancers, responsible for the degradation of Zoroastrianism or, on the contrary, as the true disciples of Zarathustra and his missionaries in western Iran. During the period of the Median Empire (seventh century) they seem to have been a hereditary caste of Median priests, comparable to the Levites and the Brahmans.39 Under the Achaemenids they are the preeminent representatives of the sacerdotal class. According to the information transmitted by Herodotus, they interpreted dreams (1. 107 ff.), prophesied in connection with sacrifices of white horses (7. 13), and during the sacrifices chanted a "genealogy of the gods" (1. 132), which indicates that they were the guardians of a tradition
38. Widengren considers, however, that Mithra enjoyed a cult of no small
proportions in Persia, even as early as the reign of Darius I (Rei. de ['Iran, p. 148). 39. Cf. Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight, p.163.



322 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
of religious poetry.40 In any case, the Magi had adopted a number of Zoroastrian rites and customs and ended by being regarded as disciples of Zarathustra; indeed, certain Greek writers considered him a Magus. It is still Herodotus to whom we owe the most valuable pieces of information concerning the Iranians of the north, especially the Scythians. Among their deities we find the sky god (Papaios), Mithra (Helios-Apollo), "Ares," god of war, the Earth Goddess, and Aphrodite Urania (4. 59). Herodotus also reports a national legend concerning the origin of the Scythian tribes and the royal power (4.5 ff.). The myth is explained by the tripartite ideology of the IndoEuropeans, and it survives in the popular epic of the Ossets of the Caucasus, descendants of the Scythians and the Alans. The Greek historian declares (4. 59) that the Scythians had no temples, altars, or statues. However, they annually sacrificed horses and sheep, as well as 1 percent of their prisoners of war, to "Ares"; the god was represented by an iron sword raised on an artificial mound. Sacrifices of human beings (a concubine, a number of servants) and of horses accompanied the burial of kings (4. 71 ff.). Finally, it is important to note the shamanic character of one rite: the Scythians threw hemp seeds on red-hot stones and, adds Herodotus, who had not understood that a religious act was involved, the smoke made them "so happy that they howled in joy" (4. 75). In all probability, we here have an ecstatic experience, parallels to which can be found in the Zoroastrian tradition (§ 102).
108. New aspects of Mazdaism: The cult of Haoma
The Yasna with Seven Chapters, written in prose and making up giithiis 35-42, reflects the beginning of a comparatively complex process of adaptation and integration. To begin with, certain significant innovations are observable in vocabulary; the Amesha Spentas are mentioned for the first time as a group, and we find the term yazata (" gods "), which will become important in later Mazdaism. We distinguish a certain tendency toward resacralization of the cosmic realities. Fire is identified with the Holy Spirit, Spenta Maiyu
40. Widengren, ReI. de /'Iran, p. 139; see also pp. 135 ff.



New aspects of Mazdaism: The cult of Haoma 323
(Yasna 36.3); together with the sun, fire is associated with Ahura MazdaY The sun is the visible form of the Lord, "the highest of the highest" (36. 6). Asha, Truth, is likewise associated with light. Then too, the preeminence of Asha in the Yasna with Seven Chapters has been noted: Asha is invoked with Ahura Mazda, and the union of the Lord with Truth "forever" is proclaimed (40.2; 41. 6). Asha now signifies more than Truth, Justice, Order; it is a personification whose structure is both cosmic and spiritual; 42 it is called "the most propitious, beneficient, immortal, made of light" (37.4). Vohu Manah, which inspired Zarathustra in the gathiis, is reduced to a subordinate position. Still more surprisingly, there is mention of the" good wives" of Ahura (the Ahuranis), who are the Waters: "We venerate the Ahuranis, the Waters" (Yasna 38.3).43 And Haoma acquires an important place in the cult: "We worship the glorious Haoma of gold, we worship the shining Haoma that makes life prosper, we venerate the Haoma from which death flees" (42. 5). A number of authors have interpreted this exaltation of Haoma as a proof of syncretism, after the death of Zarathustra, between the Prophet's message and the traditional religion. However, if it is true that Zarathustra in fact accepted the cult of Haoma, though at the same time stigmatizing its excesses, there is no question of syncretism but rather of a solemn elevation of the values of the old Indo-Iranian cosmic religion.
Zarathustra's gathiis and the Gatha with Seven Chapters form part of the sacramental liturgy, the yasna, a great deal of which consists of monotonous invocations of the divine beings. The Yasts, on the other hand, are hymns addressed, separately, to various divinities. These are a number of gods whom Zarathustra had ignored-for example, Mithra-but also divine personages or personifications of religious realities, such as Haoma. The Hom-yast (Yast 20) justifies the cult of haoma by a daring origin myth: while Zarathustra was
4l. In the later Yasnas-l. 11; 3. 13; 7. 13-the sun will be called the eye of Ahura Mazda, which indicates the reactualization of an archaic Indo-Iranian idea, for the sun is already the eye of VaruQ.a in Rig Veda l. 50. 6. 42. Zaehner, Dawn, p. 64. 43. As Zaehner observes (Dawn, p. 65), in the later texts the Waters are forgotten; Ahura Mazda's wife will be Armaiti, the Good Thought of the giithtis, later identified with the Earth. This is certainly a relic of the traditional Iranian religion.



324 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
blessing the fire and reciting the giithiis, haoma approached him and invited him to gather and squeeze it. Questioning it, the Prophet learned that Vivahvant was the first to squeeze haoma and had obtained as reward the birth of a son, King Yima, "the most religious of human beings" (Yast 20. 45). We shall return to the meaning and prehistory of this mythicoritual scenario: offspring obtained after, and by the power of, a sacrifice (see volume 2). It is to be noted that Yima and the haoma rite are extolled in Mazdaism jointly with blood sacrifices (Yast 11. 4-7). Such an elevation of the Indo-Iranian heritage obviously occasioned strong resistance; indeed, blood sacrifices were later definitively suppressed, and haoma disappeared as an intoxicating drink, being replaced by a mixture of plant juices, water, and milk.44
109. Exaltation of the god Mithra
Still more surprising, and more important for the history of Mazdaism, is the M ihr Yast (Yast 10), the long hymn in honor of Mithra. "When I created Mithra of the broad pastures," Ahura Mazda declares, "I made him as worthy of veneration and reverence as myself" (Yasl 10. 1). In other words, all the greatness, power, and creativity of Mithra are the work of the Wise Lord. In this prologue we recognize the effort of Mazdean theology to reconfirm the omnipotence of one supreme god. In fact, the Mihr Yast relates and justifies the elevation of Mithra to the eminence that was his before Zarathustra's reform. When, at the end of the hymn, the two gods are united, the author uses the formula Mithra-Ahurii (Yt. 10. 145), a replica of the well-known Vedic binomial Mitra-VarulJa. 45 However, the god exalted in the Mihr Yast was not reintegrated into Mazdaism without some changes. We can decipher in the hymn itself the different moments of a discrete theogony: a series of acts and gestures by Ahura Mazda is directed precisely to the glorification and advancement of Mithra. The first thing to be emphasized is his multivalence. He is, to be sure, the god of contracts, and by promising to worship him (Yast 10. 4-6) the believer undertakes no longer to

Exaltation of the god Mithra 325
break contracts. But he is also the god of war and shows himself to be violent and cruel (he furiously massacres the daevas and the impious with his mace, vazra, a characteristic that brings him close to Indra). He is also a solar god, associated with Light (10. 142). He has a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes (10. 141), that is, he is all-seeing and omniscient, like any sovereign god; but he is also the universal provider, who insures the fertility of fields and flocks (10.61 ff.). The phenomenon is current in the history of religions: a divinity is given a multiplicity of powers and attributes that are sometimes contradictory in order to obtain a "totality" necessary to his elevation, whether momentary or permanent, to the rank of the great gods. Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas built a house for him above Mount Hara, that is, in the spiritual world that lies beyond the celestial vault (Yast 10. 49-52).46 Nevertheless, Mithra complains to the Lord that, though he is the protector of all creatures, he is not worshiped with prayers, as the other gods are (10.54). Presumably he receives the cult that he demands, for later in the hymn we see Mithra on a chariot drawn by white horses (62 ff.) or, accompanied by Sraosha and Rashnu, traveling through the earth by night and exterminating the daevas (95-101) or pursuing those who do not respect contracts (104-11). Still more significant are the stages of Mithra's elevation to the rank of supreme god. First Ahura Mazda consecrates Haoma as priest of Mithra, and Haoma worships him (88), that is, offers him sacrifices. Then Ahura Mazda prescribes the proper rite for the cult of Mithra (119-22) and performs it himself in paradise, in the House of Song (124). After this apotheosis, Mithra returns to earth to fight the daevas, while Ahura Mazda remains in the House of Song. The reunion of Ahura Mazda and Mithra seals the fate of the daevas. Mithra is worshiped as the light that lights the whole world (142-44). And the hymn ends with these words: "by the plant barsom we worship Mithra and Ahura, the glorious Lords of Truth, free forever from corruption: we worship the stars, the moon, and the sun. We worship Mithra, the Lord of all lands" (145).
46. The meaning of this mythical motif is well known: the building of a temple, in heaven, by the members of the pantheon salutes the victory (often of the cosmogonic type; cf. Marduk) of a god and consecrates his elevation to supreme rank (cf. Baal). Obviously, this mythological episode finds expression, on earth, in the building of a sanctuary in honor of the god (cf. § 50).



326 ZARA THUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
Mithra was advanced in Mazdaism especially as the god-champion in the struggle against the daevas and the impious. The fact that Ahura Mazda abandons this function entirely to him indicates a certain tendency to otiositas in the latter; but because the fight against the forces of evil is the principal obligation of Mazdaism, the hymn can be interpreted as a "conversion" of Mithra, hence as a victory of the Lord.
110. Ahura Mazda and the eschatological sacrifice
The process of syncretism between the old ethnic religion and the message of Zarathustra can be deciphered in other hymns. Thus, for example, in Yast 8, dedicated to the yazata Tistrya (personification of the star Sirius), Tistrya laments that he has not succeeded in vanquishing the demon Apaosa-who held back the Waters and threatened to ruin all Creation-because men ignored him in their rites. Then Ahura Mazda venerates Tistrya, offering him a sacrifice (yasna); in consequence, Tistrya emerges victorious from his fight with the daeva and insures the fertility of the earth. Ahura Mazda likewise sacrifices to Anahita and asks her" to grant him this favor: 'May I induce the pious Zarathustra to think, speak, and act according to the Good Religion ?'" (Yast 5. 17-19). In addition, the Wise Lord sacrifices to Vayu and begs him "to grant him this favor," that he may kill the creatures of Angra Mainyu (15.3). No less unexpected is Ahura Mazda's declaration that, without the help he received from the Fravashis-which are the preexisting souls of men -humanity and the animals would have disappeared and the material world have fallen under the empire of Falsehood (13. 12). Zaehner 47 understands these texts as a contradiction to the doctrine of Zarathustra, that is, the self-humiliation of Ahura Mazda, who not only venerates subordinate beings but asks for their help. And indeed the decisive importance attributed to the help of the Fravashis is reminiscent of a certain type of deus otiosus, when the Creator appears to suffer from a "mental fatigue" that obliges him to appeal to certain animals and even to his adversary.48 But the fact that Ahura Mazda venerates (yaz-) one or another god by

umented in Zervanism; see Eliade, "The Devil and God," Zalmoxis, pp. 79 if.



Ahura Mazda and the eschatological sacrifice 327
consecrating sacrifices (yasna) to him does not necessarily imply that he places himself in a subordinate situation. The Yasts emphasize the creative power of the rites and the liturgy and present Ahura Mazda in his sacerdotal function. 49 By offering him a sacrifice, Ahura Mazda increases by tenfold the magico-religious power of the recipient of it. What is apparent from the hymns is especially the exceptional importance of sacrifice-a conception that is certainly Indo-Iranian but that is developed particularly in the BriihmQ1;zas and will become increasingly central in Mazdaism. As among the other Indo-Europeans, the ritual fire plays the capital role. Yasna "is essentially a sacrifice of haoma performed before the fire" (Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien, p. 71). The maintenance, purification, and foundation of the sacred fires took on, in Mazdaism, proportions unknown elsewhere. For every Mazdean king, the supreme religious act consisted in founding a fire, that is, building a temple, endowing it with revenues, and appointing priests to it.50 Though Zarathustra condemned certain blood sacrifices, it is not certain that he rejected them all. In any case, animal sacrifices are known in the Avesta (Yasna 11. 4; Yast 8.58). In addition, they are abundantly documented under the Achaemenids in the Parthian period, and under the Sassanids.51 We have seen (§ 104) in what sense Zarathustra-who himself designates himself Saoshyant and exclaims: "May we be those who will renew this existence" (Yasna 30. 9)-revalorized the old mythicoritual scenario that insured the renewal of the world by ritual repetition of the cosmogony. In Zoroastrianism the eschatological intention of the sacrifice is continually reinforced, though its cosmic value is not thereby obliterated. We can discern a process analogous to the "historicization" of the cosmic rhythms and phenomena in Yahwism (§ 57). The combat against monsters and other traditional heroic themes are interpreted as moments in the Mazdean eschatological drama, that is, the struggle against the daevas, the waiting and preparation for universal Renewal (Jraso-kereti). Since the world was symbolically re-created and time itself was renewed by the New Year rite, the eschatological Renovation was finally given a place in the

328 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
same scenario. The sacrifice performed by the Zoroastrian priest anticipates the final sacrifice by which Saoshyant will effect the Renovation. Consequently the officiant identifies himself with Saoshyant and, implicitly, with Zarathustra.52 Later the two intentions of the sacrifice-eschatological and cosmogonic-are again brought together. The traditions preserved in the Pahlavi texts emphasize a series of sacrifices by which Ahura Mazda created the cosmos, the primordial man, and Zarathustra.53 The eschatological Renovation will take place during the New Year festival, and then the dead will return to life, be judged, and, finally, "immortalized." It should be noted that the universal renewal, just like the original creation, will be the result of a sacrifice. The Pahlavi texts describe in great detail the final sacrifice, to be performed by Saoshyant and his assistants, in which Ohrmazd and the Amesha Spentas will take part, and after which men will return to life and become immortal and the whole universe will be radically regenerated.54 We see in what sense Zoroastrianism made use of the archaic values of sacrifice. Zarathustra had proclaimed a "holy war" against the forces of evil, and each of the faithful, by choosing the Good Religion, was summoned to combat the daevas, to "purge" the world of demons; in other words, he took part in the universal work of cleansing performed by Ahura Mazda and his archangels. The redeeming function of the Good Religion was progressively strengthened by glorification of the creative power of rite. Since the ultimate goal was universal regeneration, the fundamental, cosmogonic value of sacrifice was valorized; indeed, the eschatological Renovation not only "saves" humanity but creates it anew, by effecting the resurrection of the body. This implies a new Creation, indestructible, incorruptible. As Yast 19.90 announces: "The material world will no longer die away.... Falsehood will perish."
111. The soul's journey after death
Funerary rites, mythologies of death, conceptions concerning the postexistence of the soul change slowly, in spite of reforms and conversions. This is as much as to say that much of the data supplied

The soul's journey after death 329
by the Avestan and Pahlavi texts are also valid for the pre-Zarathustran period. The rite documented in western Iran, specifically the burning of the body and burying the ashes in an urn, spread to other regions with Zoroastrianism. Still more archaic was a custom typical ofthe steppes of Central Asia: exposing the body in a place designated for the purpose, where it was eaten by vultures and dogs.55 The Iranians of the East performed ritual lamentations and inflicted blows on themselves, even going as far as suicide. But Zoroastrianism drastically forbids "tears and lamentations," declaring them to be the invention of Angra Mainyu.56 As for the soul's experiences after death, we find certain familiar motifs-crossing a bridge, ascent to heaven, judgment-but also the theme of meeting with one's own Self. A poem that formed part of the Hadoxt Nask (Yast 21-22) relates that the soul (urvan) of the just man remains close to his body for three days. Toward the end of the third night a perfumed wind rises from the South, and the daenii of the deceased appears" in the form of a beautiful young girl, shining, white-armed, vigorous, of beautiful appearance, straight-bodied, tall, with upward-pointing breasts ... fifteen years old" (Hiidoxt Nask 9). Revealing her identity, the diienii adds: "Lovable as I was, thou didst make me more lovable by thy good thoughts, thy good words, thy good deeds, thy good religion; beautiful, thou madest me still more beautiful; desirable, still more desirable" (ibid., 14). Then, in four strides, the soul traverses the three celestial spheres,57 and reaches "the Lights without beginning" (15) that is, paradise. One of the dead asks how he passed "from corporeal existence to spiritual existence, from existence full of dangers to existence without danger" (16), but Ahura Mazda intervenes: "Do not question him, for you remind him of the horrible, dangerous road, linked to separation, by which he passed, and which consists in a separation from the body and consciousness" (17)-a reference to the dramatic ordeals of the journey.56 Ahura Mazda orders that he be offered

"spring butter," 59 which is, for the just man, his" nourishment after death" (18). On the contrary, the soul of the wicked man meets in the North Wind a frightful termagant and arrives at the zone of Darknesswithout-a-Beginning, where Angra Mainyu demands that he be given poison (20-35). Let us single out the characteristic features: (1) the soul meets its diienii, that is, its own Self,60 which preexists it (" lovable though I was ") but which is at the same time the result of its religious activity on earth (" thou didst make me more lovable "); (2) the diienii presents itself under an archetypized female form, at the same time preserving a concrete appearance; (3) we certainly have here an Indo-Iranian conception, since it is found in the Kau~itaki-Upani~ad 1. 3-6: the soul of him who sets out on the "road of the gods" (devayiina) is welcomed, among other divinities, by Manasi (the "Intelligent" [fern.]) and Cakshushi (the "Clairvoyant" [fern.]); it then crosses a lake and a stream, enters a city, and arrives before Brahman, who asks it: "Who art thou?" 61 There is no reference to the Cinvat Bridge in the Hiidoxt Nask. However, Zarathustra speaks of it at length (§ 103). It represents an Indo-Iranian conception, known to other Indo-European peoples and documented elsewhere in the history of religions. The classic description 62 tells how the diienii arrives with its dogs and guides the soul of the just man on the Cinvat Bridge, over the Hara Berezaiti, the cosmic mountain (in fact, the bridge-which is at the" center of the world"---connects earth with heaven). Received by Vohu Manah, the souls pass before Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas. The separation of the good from the wicked takes place either before the bridge or at its entrance. As for the judgment of the soul, of which the Pahlavi texts speak and where the judge is Mithra, assisted by Sraosha and Rashnu (with a pair of scales), it is unknown in the

giithiis. In any case, it is superfluous in the scenario: crossing the bridge, comparable to an initiatory ordeal, in itself constitutes the judgment; for according to a widespread conception, the bridge widens under the feet of the just and becomes like a razor's edge when the impious approach it.
112. The resurrection of the body
Still more superficially Zoroastrianized are the eschatological myths and beliefs crystallized around Yima. Whereas in India Yama chiefly inspired the mythology of the First of the Dead, in Iran Yima became the First King and the model for the perfect sovereign. For the purpose of this chapter it will suffice to recall that the Iranian tradition associates the original paradise with the reign of Yima: for a thousand years death and suffering did not exist, and men remained ever young.63 But when Yima began to tell lies, his xvarenah forsook him, and finally he, too, lost immort'ality.64 Another eschatological myth, originally independent, was integrated by Zoroastrian theology into the mythology of Yima. Ahura Mazda warns Yima that a winter three years long will destroy all life on earth; he then asks Yima to build an enclosure (vara) in which he will save the best of men and the germs of all the animal species. The vara was imagined as an underground dwelling, for neither sun, moon, nor stars shine there.65 This is an archaic eschatology, perhaps Indo-European (cf. the winter Fimbul in the Germanic tradition), but which in no way corresponds with the Zoroastrian vision. Yet it is understandable why Yima was introduced into this mythological scenario of the end of the world: he was the king of the fabled Golden Age, and in the vara were preserved, or, more precisely, "saved," the germs of a future humanity, ready to experience, after the eschatological catastrophe, the paradisal existence of the "beginnings."

332 ZARATHUSTRA AND THE IRANIAN RELIGION
Another eschatological idea is added, that of the resurrection of the body. The belief appears to be comparatively old, but it is expressly proclaimed in Yast 19. 11 and 89 (see also 13. 129), which speaks of the "resurrection of the dead," in connection with the arrival of the "Living One," that is, of the Saoshyant announced by Zarathustra. So the Resurrection forms part of the final Renovation, which also implies the universal judgment. Several ideas, some of them comparatively old, now find expression in a grandiose eschatological vision: the radically and completely renewed world in fact represents a new Creation that will no longer be vitiated by the attacks of the demons; the resurrection of the dead-actually the re-creation of bodies-is equivalent to a cosmogony by virtue of the microcosmos-macrocosmos parallel, an archaic conception common to several Indo-European peoples, but which had a considerable development in India and Iran. As we saw (§ 104), the final Renovation, already prefigured in the liturgy performed by Zarathustra, is anticipated in the rituals of the New Year (Nawroz). The tradition ends by placing close to the New Year the three decisive events of the cosmic and human drama: the Creation, the revelation of the "Religion," and the eschatological Renovation.66 But since the year is, figuratively, the totality of cosmic time, the last ten days of each year in a way anticipate the eschatological drama. It is the fabulous interval during which souls return to earth: one Yast (13.49-52) invokes the Fravashis,67 who move about freely during the last ten days of the year. This belief is universally disseminated, but the Zoroastrians, like other theologians before and after them, place it in a much larger system: according to the Pahlavi tradition, Ohrmazd completed the creation of man during these last ten days of the year; consequently, the Fravashis arrive on earth at the moment of the creation of man and return at the end of time, that is, at the resurrection of bodies.68 The late texts develop the parallelism between the New Year festival and the eschatological Renovation, when the resurrection

67. The fravashis are the souls of the just and at the same time their celestial archetypes. As guardian angels of the faithful, the fravashis combat the incarnations or evil; but late sources describe them as armed horsemen protecting heaven; see Widengren, Rei. de l'Iran, p. 39. The complex figure of the fravashis appears to be the result of a long process of religious syncretism. 68. See the texts cited by Mole, Culte, mythe et cosmologie, p. 109.



The resurrection of the body 333
will occur. On the occasion of each New Year, gifts of new clothing are received, and, at the end of time, Ohrmazd will give glorious garments to the resuscitated.69 As we saw (§ 104), it is after the sacrifice accomplished by Saoshyant, whether or not assisted by Ahura Mazda, that the universal Renovation and the resurrection of bodies will occur. This eschatological sacrifice in a way repeats the cosmogonic sacrifice; this is why it is similarly "creative." The resurrection, with its corollary, the indestructibility of bodies, represents a daring development of Zarathustra's eschatological thought; indeed, it represents a new conception of immortality.70

14 The Religion of Israel
in the Period of the Kings and the Prophets
113. Kingship and the monarchy: The apogee of syncretism
"When Samuel grew old, he appointed his two sons as judges over Israel." But his sons did not follow his example, and then the leaders came to him and said: "Give us a king to rule over us, like the other nations" (1 Sam. 8:1-5). Kingship, then, was a foreign institution. Some opponents of the idea did not spare their criticism, for in their eyes Yahweh was sole king of Israel. However, from the beginning the monarchy was regarded as pleasing to Yahweh. After being anointed by Samuel, Saul received the "spirit of Yahweh" (1 Sam. 10: 6). For the king was the" anointed" (masiab) of God (1 Sam. 24: 7, 11; 26:9, 11, 16,23, etc.); he was adopted by Yahweh, became in a sense his son: "I will be a father to him and he a son to me" (2 Sam. 7:14). But the king is not engendered by Yahweh; he is only recognized, "legitimated," by a special declaration.1 Yahweh grants him universal domination (Psalm 72: 8), and the king sits on his throne beside God (Ps. 110:1 and 5; 1 ehron. 28:5; 29:23; etc.). The king is Yahweh's representative; hence he belongs to the divine sphere. But the unique position of Yahweh makes the "divinization" of the king impossible; 2 the latter is preeminently the" servant" of Yahweh (the word is applied to David sixty times). The coronation ceremony includes, together with other rites, anointing, proclamation of kingship, and enthronement.3 As repre

was also a "son" of Yahweh (Fohrer, pp. 185 ff.). 2. Even in texts so closely connected with the monarchy as the Psalms, it is Yahweh, not the king, who is given the central role (Fohrer, p. 150).

Kingship and the monarchy: The apogee of syncretism 335
sentative of Yahweh, the king of Israel, exactly like the sovereigns of the ancient East, must maintain cosmic order (Ps. 2:10-12), impose justice, defend the weak (Ps. 72: 1 if.), insure the fertility ofthe land: "He will come down like rain on the aftercrop.... Grain everywhere in the country, even on the mountaintops" (Ps. 72:16, 6). We recognize the traditional images of a paradisal reign, images that the Messianic prophets will brilliantly refurbish. (Besides, the expectation of the ideal king, the Messiah, is bound up with the ideology of kingship.) The monarchy was interpreted as a new covenant between Yahweh and the dynasty of David, a continuation of the covenant of Sinai. It is in this valorization ofa foreign institution as a new act of sacred history that we can appreciate the originality of the Israelite ideology ofkingship.4 Solomon builds the Temple at Jerusalem, close to the royal palace; he thus associates the cult of the sanctuary with the hereditary monarchy. The Temple becomes Yahweh's residence among the Israelites. The Ark of the Covenant, which until then accompanied the Israelite armies, is set up in the darkness of the Holy of Holies (debir). But from this sanctuary the holiness of Yahweh radiates on the city and out over the whole earth (Ps. 15:1; 24: 3; 46: 5; Isaiah 31 :4; 48:2; etc.). Mount Zion, on which the Temple was built, is a "center of the world."5 The Temple of Jerusalem becomes the national sanctuary, and the royal cult is identified with the state religion. The office consists of propitiatory and expiatory rituals for the whole community, but it also includes public prayers for the king, for his glory, and for the exercise of his justice, which insures "the peace of the people" and universal prosperity (Pss. 20 and 72). In the last analysis, the liturgical practice renews the structures of the world.
Just as the Temple was built after a foreign model, the cult borrowed Canaanite forms. Syncretism attained proportions thitherto unknown, for the monarchy encouraged the fusion of the religious ideas and practices shared by the two strata of the population, the Israelites and the Canaanites. In addition, Solomon accepted the cults of his foreign wives and allowed the building of sanctuaries in honor of their gods (1 Kings 11: 6-7). The kings regarded themselves

336 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
as heads of the state religion, but we are poorly informed concerning their priestly function. When the Ark was transported to Jerusalem, David acted like a priest: he danced before the Ark, offered "holocausts before Yahweh ... and blessed the people in the name of Yahweh Sabaoth" (2 Sam. 6: 16-18). So, too, Solomon blessed the assemblage at the consecration of the Temple (1 Kings 8: 14). And Psalm 110: 4 proclaims the king" a priest of the order of Melchizedek for ever." But on other occasions the kings were criticized because they had performed rites reserved for the priests. Very probably the king played a part in the expiatory ceremonies at the New Year. On the other hand, certain Psalms seem to refer to a ritual of the symbolic death and resurrection of the king. So we may suppose a relation between the New Year festival-including a symbolic reactualization of the Creation-and the ritual of the king's "death and resurrection." 6 At Solomon's death the kingdom split into two: that of the North, or Israel, and the kingdom of the South, or Judah. Since the Ark had remained at Jerusalem and the northern tribes no longer had access to the common sanctuary, Jeroboam, the first king of Israel, established two sanctuaries, at Bethel and at Dan, where Yahweh was worshiped in the form of two golden calves (1 Kings 12:28-29). It is possible that these tauromorphic statues served as the seat of the invisible God. However, there is here a Canaanite influence that violated the prohibition against images, and this innovation, bordering on apostasy, aggravated the misunderstanding between the two kingdoms. 7
114. Yahweh and the creature
A whole group of Psalms, the "Psalms of Enthronement," exalt Yahweh as king. He is "a greater King than all other gods" (95:3); "Yahweh is king, the nations tremble .... You are a king who loves justice, insisting on honesty, justice, virtue" (99: 1, 5). But the idea of
6. See G. Ahlstrom, Psalm 89: Eine Liturgie aus dem Ritual des leidenden Konigs, pp. 143 fr.; Widengren, Sakrales Konigtum, pp. 15 fr.; Ringgren, pp. 249 fr.; Fohrer, pp. 142 fr.
7. It is important to remember that, whereas in the south the hereditary monarchy of the Davidic dynasty continued, kingship in the north was more or less charismatic; see Ringgren, pp. 76 fr.



Yahweh and the creature 337
divine kingship does not depend on the institution of the monarchy. The conception is archaic: God is master of the world because it is he who created it. Yahweh conquered the primordial monster (Rahab, Leviathan, Tannin the Dragon), symbol of chaos. As cosmocrator, God resides in heaven and manifests his presence or his will in meteorological phenomena-lightning, thunder, rain. We have already mentioned his contradictory attributes (§ 59), a well-known formula for "totality." Yahweh dispenses good and evil, he gives death and life, he humbles and exalts (1 Sam. 2:6 if.). His wrath is terrible, but he is also merciful. Yahweh is, above all, holy (qado§), which means that he is both inaccessible and dangerous and also brings salvation.8 Creator and king of the world, Yahweh is also the judge of his creation. "At the moment I decide, I will dispense strict justice" (Ps. 75:3). He judges justly (Ps. 96:10). His "justice," at once moral, cosmic, and social, constitutes the fundamental norm ofthe universe.9 Yahweh is the "Living God," in o~her words, he differs both from idols, which "do not speak" and "must be carried, for they do not walk" (Jer. 10: 5), and from men, who are" like the grass that springs up" (Ps. 10:5). Man, too, is a living being (neje§), for God breathed "breath" or "spirit" (rual;z) into him; but his existence is short. In addition, whereas God is spirit, man is flesh (basar). This opposition does not imply a religious disapproval of the body; it emphasizes the precariousness and ephemerality of human existence in contrast to the omnipotence and eternity of God. The incommensurable distance between these two modes of being is explained by the fact that man is a creature of God. Yet he differs from the other creations, for he was formed in God's image, and he reigns over nature.
Man's mortality is the consequence of original sin, particularly of Adam's desire to make himself like God (§ 59). The biblical texts dwell on the futility of the human condition. Man was made from dust and will return to dust (Gen. 3:19). A long life is his greatest good. As in so many other traditional cultures, death is degrading: it reduces man to a larval postexistence in the grave or in sheof, a dark and terrifying region in the depths of the earth. Since death is essentially the negation of his work, Yahweh does not reign over

338 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
sheol. Hence, the deceased is deprived of relations with God, which, for the believer, is the most terrible of trials. Yet Yahweh is stronger than death: if he wanted to, he could raise man from the grave. Certain Psalms refer to this prodigy: "You have brought my soul up from Sheol, of all those who go down to the Pit you have revived me" (30:4); "No, I shall not die, I shall live ... ; though Yahweh has punished me often, he has not abandoned me to Death" (118: 17). These are the only references to the resurrection of the dead before the Babylonian Captivity (587-538 B.C.), when part of the population will be exposed to the influence of the Iranian eschatology (see volume 2).10 " Slave" or "servant" of Yahweh, man must live in the fear of his God. Obedience is the perfect religious act. On the contrary, sin is disobedience, breaking the Commandments. However, consciousness of precariousness does not exclude confidence in Yahweh or the joy engendered by the divine blessing. But the relations between God and man do not go beyond this stage; the unio mystica of the soul with its creator is unthinkable for the theology of the Old Testament. By recognizing him as the creator and absolute sovereign, man arrives at knowing at least certain predicates of God. Since the Law (torah) proclaims in detail the divine will, the essential thing is to obey the Commandments, that is, to behave in accordance with right or justice (.~edeq). Man's religious ideal is to be "just," to know and respect the Law, the divine order. As the Prophet Micah reminds his hearers (6: 8): "What is good has been explained to you, man; this is what Yahweh asks of you: only this, to act justly, to love tenderly, to walk humbly with your God." Sin brings loss of the blessing (berakhdh). But since sin is part of the human condition, and because Yahweh, despite his strictness, is merciful, punishment is never final.

One exegete has held that "the meeting of power and goodness summarizes the way in which the Old Testament conceives God."ll
1O. But the idea of resurrection was already prepared by theology (Yahweh's omnipotence) and by certain Canaanite beliefs and rites; see H. Riesenfeld,

Job, the just man tried 339
It may be doubted if all readers of the Book of Job subscribe to this opinion. The story is tragically simple :12 its subject is the affliction of a just man, of whom Yahweh was very proud. "Did you notice my servant Job?" God asks Satan, the celestial "accuser." "There is no one like him on earth: a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil" (Job 1: 8). But Satan replies that Job's devotion is explained by his prosperity, that is, by the divine blessing. And Yahweh then allows the "accuser" to put his most faithful servant to the test. Job loses his children and his wealth, and, prostrated by "malignant ulcers from the sole of his foot to the top of his head," he sits down among the ashes. He laments, cursing the day he was born, but he does not revolt against God. Three friends come to him and in long speeches try to convince him that the simple fact that he suffers-hence, is being punished-proves his guilt. So he must recognize and confess his "sins." But Job rejects the explanation of his misfortune by the doctrine of retribution. Me knows that man "cannot be in the right against God" (9: 2), that Yahweh "destroys innocent and guilty alike" (9: 22); yet, addressing God, he dares to say: "You know very well that I am innocent and that no one can rescue me from your hand" (10: 7). He does not understand why God pursues his own creature so relentlessly (to: 8-22), for Job has no doubt of the paltriness of every human existence: "Will you
intimidate a wind-blown le~f, will you chase the dried-up chaff? " (13 :25). But he is unable to identify the nature of his crime: "How many faults and crimes have I committed? What law have I transgressed, or in what have I offended?" (13: 23).13 One of his friends blames him for using such language, for the creature is guilty by definition: "How can any man be clean? Born of woman, can he ever be good? In his own Holy Ones God puts no trust, and the heavens themselves are not, in his eyes, clean" (15:1415). But Job repeats that, in his case, there has been a personal
12. The date of the redaction of the Book of Job is uncertain. Though the text as we know it seems to be postexilic, the content is old. 13. His inability to understand his guilt is the central theme of Job's laments. "Yet have I ever laid a hand on the poor when they cried out for justice in calamity? Have I not wept for all whose life is hard, felt pity for the penniless?" (30:24-25). "Have I been a fellow traveler with falsehood, or hastened my steps towards deceit?" (31 :5). "Have I been insensible to poor men's needs, or let a widow's eyes grow dim? Or taken my share of bread alone, not giving a share to the orphan?" (31:16-17; cf. 31:19-34).



340 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
decision on the part of Yahweh, whose purpose escapes him (l9 :6-7). When another friend speaks to him of the punishment of sinners, Job reminds him that the wicked, who do not serve God, "live on" and prosper (21 :7-16). If he knew how to reach him, he would argue the case before Yahweh, tell him of evil deeds left unpunished; but the Lord is far away, absent, invisible (23, 24). It is precisely because he does not abandon his faith and his confidence in God that Job declares: "I will maintain my innocence to my dying day. I take my stand on my integrity, I will not stir: my conscience gives me no cause to blush for my life" (27: 5-6). Yet Job cries out to a God who does not answer: "I stand before you, but you take no notice. You have grown cruel in your dealings with me" (30:20-21). A fourth friend, Elihu, "still young," breaks in violently. He is indignant that Job could have said: "I am clean, and sinless, I am pure, free of all fault" (33: 9). For, Elihu declares, "God never does wrong, does not deflect the course of right" (34:12); he does not spurn the blameless man (36:5). After Elihu's long speech,14 Yahweh's answer is disappointing in its impersonality. God speaks "from the heart of the tempest" (38:1), in a veritable theophany, but he ignores Job's questions. Yahweh contents himself with reminding Job of his omnipotence, his cosmic work, the complexity of the universe, the infinite variety of the manifestations of life. After calling to witness the great cosmic structures and the laws that govern the heavens and the earth, God speaks to him of the lions and wild goats and other creatures whose life and proliferation he insures, after having fashioned them, each with its particular form and characteristic behavior. And he concludes by apostrophizing him: "Has God's critic thought up an answer?" (40:2). Job vainly tries to take refuge in silence: "My words have been frivolous: what can I reply? I had better lay my finger on my lips" (40:4). In a second speech, Yahweh describes to him at length the beast Behemoth and the monster Leviathan. In answer Job shows that he has understood the secret meaning of Yahweh's lesson: the very existence of the universe is a miracle, the Creator's mode of being defies comprehension, the purpose of his acts remains impenetrable. "I know that you are all powerful. ... I am the man who obscured your designs with my empty-headed words. I have been holding
14. This speech appears to be an interpolation.



The time of the prophets 341
forth on matters I cannot understand, on marvels beyond me and my knowledge.... I knew you only by hearsay, but now, having seen you with my own eyes, I retract all I have said, and in dust and ashes I repent" (42:1-6). In the last analysis Job recognized that he was guilty toward God. Yahweh immediately restored him to his former situation and, indeed, doubled all his possessions, and Job lived on until he was a hundred and forty years old (42: 7-17). After three millennia this febrile, enigmatic, and disquieting book continues to fascinate. The fact that God allowed himself to be tempted by Satan still troubles many naively religious souls. However, Job understood the lesson well: if everything depends upon God, and if God is impenetrable, it is impossible to judge his acts, hence impossible to judge his attitude toward Satan. Yahweh's secret lesson goes beyond "the case of Job." It is addressed to all those who are unable to understand the presence-and the triumph--of evil in the world. In short, for the believer, the Book of Job is an explanation of evil and injustice, of imperfection and terror. Since everything is willed and governed by God, whatever befalls the believer is charged with religious meaning. But it would be vain-and at the same time impious-to believe that, without God's help, man is capable of grasping the "mystery of iniquity."
116. The time of the prophets
"A man who is now called a 'prophet' (nabf) was formerly called a 'seer'" (1 Sam. 9: 9). And in fact the institution of the "seer" (r6'eh) of the nomadic period was modified, after the conquest, under the influence of the nebPfm, whom the Israelites had found in Palestine. About 1000 B.C., Yahwistic "seers" (such as Nathan) and the nebf'fm still coexisted (1 Sam. 10: 5). Gradually the two institutions fused, and the result was classic Old Testament prophecy. Like the nebf'fm, the prophets were associated with sanctuaries and the cult and had ecstatic experiences. Elijah and Elisha illustrate the period of transition, but their religious vocations and activities already announce classic prophecy. Elijah makes his appearance in the Northern Kingdom, under kings Ahab and Ahazias (874-850 B.C.). He revolts against Ahab's policy. Ahab wanted to integrate the Israelites and the Canaanites by giving



342 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
them equal rights and encouraging religious syncretism with the cult of Baal or Malkart, a cult protected by Queen Jezebel, a native of Tyre. Elijah proclaims Yahweh sole sovereign in Israel. It is Yahweh, not Baal, who dispenses rain and insures the fertility of the country. In the famous episode on Mount Carmel, when he competes with the prophets of Baal to end a three-year drought, Elijah shows that the Canaanite god is powerless to light the sacrificial altar and hence to bring rain.15 In addition, Elijah fulminates against King Ahab, who killed one of his subjects in order to get possession of his vineyard, and he predicts that he will die by violence (1 Kings 21). Elijah's posthumous fame brings him close to Moses. Legend has Yahweh snatch him up to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:2 if.). The biography of Elisha, disciple and successor of Elijah, is full of marvelous episodes (see 2 Kings 2:19 if., etc.). Unlike Elijah, Elisha assembled a group of prophets around him. But like Elijah, he took an active part in political life, communicated oracles to the king, and even went with him to war (2 Kings 3:11). Aside from wandering diviners and visionaries, two categories of prophets are distinguished. The first group comprises the cult prophets. They live near the temples, take part in the rites with the priests,16 and are court prophets, connected with the royal sanctuaries. Very often they predict a desired victory to the king (see, for example, 1 Kings 22). This category of professional prophets, whose numbers are large, also includes those who are considered false prophets in the Old Testament. More important in the religious history of Israel is the second group, made up of the great prophets of Scripture, from Amos to the "Second Isaiah." These do not proclaim their message as members of a profession but as having a special vocation. They do not represent certain clans or certain sanctuaries or the king but declare themselves to be messengers of God.17 Their vocation is decided by a direct call from Yahweh. As Jeremiah tells it: "the word of Yahweh was
15. The contest forms part of a religious war: just as Jezebel had ordered the massacre of the prophets of Yahweh, Elijah, after his victory, demands that the people seize the 450 prophets of Baal. He "took them down to the wadi Kishon, and he slaughtered them there" (1 Kings 18:40). 16. Examples of their discourses are found in Psalms 2, 21, 81, 110, and
132 and in the books of the prophets Nahum and Habakkuk.

The time of the prophets 343
addressed to me, saying, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you came to birth I consecrated you; I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations'" (Jer. 1:4 ff.). Isaiah, for his part, one day saw in the Temple "the Lord Yahweh seated on a high throne," surrounded by seraphim, and he heard his voice, saying: "Whom shall I send? Who will be our messenger?" Isaiah answered: "Here I am, send me." And God dictated to him what he was to say to the people (Isa. 6:1-10). The summons is obeyed, despite the opposition of audiences (Hos. 9: 7; Ezek. 12: 21 ff.), but sometimes the preaching is interrupted by force (Amos 7:10 ff.) or by the prophet himself, when he feels that he has failed in his mission (Isa. 8:16-18). All the great prophets are sincerely and passionately convinced of the genuineness of their vocation and the urgency of their message. They do not doubt that they are proclaiming the very word of God, for they have felt Yahweh's hand, or his spirit (rual:z), upon them.18 Their divine possession is sometimes manifested by ecstasy, though exaltation or an ecstatic trance do not seem to be indispensable.19 Certain prophets were even accused of "madness" (like Hosea: "the prophet is mad, this inspired fellow is raving" [Hos. 9: 7]), but we cannot speak of a true psychopathological disease. Rather, there are emotional shocks, brought on by the terrifying presence of God and the gravity of the mission the prophet has just assumed. The phenomenon is well known, from the "initiatory maladies" of shamans to the "madnesses" of the great mystics of all religions. In addition, like the "specialists in the sacred" of archaic and traditional societies, the prophets are endowed with faculties of divination 20 and display marvelous powers that are magical in nature: they restore the dead to life, feed multitudes with very small quantities of foodstuffs, make certain persons fall ill, etc.21 A number of the acts performed by the prophets have a symbolic value: Elijah throws his

Ecstasy was more frequent among the nabiim (Fohrer, p. 234). 20. Elijah foresees the imminent death of King Ahaziah (2 Kings 3:16-17) and knows that the king has ordered him killed (2 Kings 6: 32); he knows the words spoken by the king of Damascus in his bedchamber (ibid.). 21. See the examples cited by Fohrer, p. 233.



344 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
cloak over Elisha (1 Kings 19:19-21); obeying Yahweh's order, Jeremiah breaks an earthenware jug to illustrate the coming ruin of Israel (Jer. 19:10 ff.); he wears a yoke to persuade the people to submit to the king of Babylon (Jer. 27).22 But whatever the source of their inspiration was (dream, vision, audition, miraculous knowledge, etc.), it was always the word of Yahweh that the prophets received. These direct, personal revelations were obviously interpreted in the light of their profound faith and transmitted in accordance with certain traditional models. The preexilic prophets have it in common that they announce above all God's judgment against Israel: Yahweh will send ruthless conquerors to destroy it; the Lord will use the great military empires as instruments of punishment against his own people, which had betrayed him. Is it possible also to decipher a promise of hope in this terrible judgment? Old Testament prophecy has been thought to represent a variant of the alternation, well known in the Near East, between times of misfortune and times of good fortune, but this schema does not seem to apply to all the cases alleged.23 As we shall see (§ 118), the only hope lies in the "remnant" of the chosen people that will survive the catastrophe. It is with this remnant that Yahweh will make a new covenant.
117. Amos the shepherd. Hosea the ill-loved
Amos was active as a preacher under the reign of Jeroboam II (782/780-753/46 B.C.). He was not a professional nabi: "I was a shepherd, and looked after sycamores: but it was Yahweh who took me from herding the flock, and Yahweh who said, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel'" (Amos 7:14-15). He announces that God will judge the neighboring peoples-Damascus, Gaza, and Philistia, Tyre and Phoenicia-who have sinned against morality. This implies that all nations are under the jurisdiction of Yahweh. However, Amos fulminates especially against Israel, the Kingdom of the North, against its social injustices and its religious infidelity. The rich "have sold the virtuous man for silver ... and trample on the heads of

Amos the shepherd. Hosea the ill-loved 345
ordinary people" (2:6-7). But their wealth will be destroyed (4:711). Vainly do these surfeited sinners multiply sacrifices. Amos hears and repeats Yahweh's words: "I hate and despise your feasts. I take no pleasure in your solemn festivals. When you offer me holocausts, I reject your oblations" (5:21 ff.). It is integrity and justice that God expects of his worshipers (5: 24-25). Then, too, the cult had been corrupted by the introduction of Canaanite orgiastic elements (5: 26; 8: 14). A mere outward show of veneration for the holy places is useless: "Go to Bethel, and sin, to Gilgal, and sin your hardest!" (4: 4). Only a return to the faith can save: "Seek good and not evil so that you may live, and that Yahweh, God of Sabaoth, may really be with you. It may be that Yahweh will take pity on the remnant of Joseph" (5:14-15).24 Like Amos, Hosea, his younger contemporary, preaches in the Kingdom of the North. His vocation and the meaning of his prophetic message seem to be linked with the vicissitudes of his marriage. But the interpretation of some allusions in the text of his discourses is very much in dispute. According to his first account (Hosea 1:2-9), Yahweh ordered him to marry a "woman given to prostitution," who bore children to whom he gave symbolic names-"Unloved" and "No-People-of-Mine"-in order publicly to proclaim that Yahweh no longer loved Israel and that Israel was no longer his people. According to the second account (3: 1-5), Yahweh told him to contract another marriage, this time with a "woman loved by her husband but an adulteress in spite of it, Just as Yahweh gives his love to the children of Israel though they turn to other gods." Probably the first wife was a woman who had taken part in Canaanite fertility rites. As for the second, chosen despite her unsavory past, she would indicate the benevolent attitude of Yahweh, ready to forgive Israel. In any case, Hosea's proclamation is dominated by God's bitterness over his betrayal by his people. Israel was the spouse of Yahweh, but she was unfaithful to him; she has become "prostituted," in other words, has abandoned herself to the Canaanite fertility gods.
24. The oracles of restoration and paradisal fecundity that end the work (Amos 9: 11-15) contrast so strongly with the oft-repeated condemnation that their genuineness may be doubted; see Ringgren, La religion d']srael, p. 280: however, von Rad considers them authentic (Old Testament Theology, vol. 2, p.138).



346 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
Israel does not know that fertility is a gift from Yahweh. "She said: 'I am going to court my lovers who give me my bread and water, my wool, my flax, my oil and my drink.' She would not acknowledge, not she, that I was the one who was giving her the corn, the wine, the oil, and who freely gave her that silver and gold of which they have made Baals" (2:7-10). We find again, now exacerbated, the irreducible conflict between Baal and Yahweh, between a religion that is cosmic in structure and fidelity to one God, creator of the world and master of history. Tirelessly, Hosea attacks the syncretism Baal-Yahweh. "They renounce their God to play the whore. They offer sacrifice on the mountain tops, burn their offerings on the hills, under oak and pine and terebinth" (4:12-13). Israel has forgotten its history: "When Israel was a child I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. But the more I called to them, the further they went from me" (11: 1-2). The anger provoked by this incorrigible ingratitude bursts out. The punishment will be terrible: "Very well, I will be a lion to-them, a leopard lurking by the way; like a bear robbed of her cubs I will pounce on them, and tear the flesh round their hearts; the dogs shall eat their flesh, and wild beasts tear them to pieces" (13:7-9). The purely external cult is useless, "since what I want is love, not sacrifice; knowledge of God, not holocausts" (6: 6). The high places, where the syncretistic ceremonies are celebrated, will be destroyed (10: 8). The only salvation is a sincere return to Yahweh. "Israel, come back to Yahweh your God; your iniquity was the cause of your downfall. Say to him, 'Take all iniquity away so that we may have happiness again'" (14: 2-3). Hosea is conscious of the fact that their fall does not allow sinners to "return to their God" (5: 4). However, Yahweh's love is stronger than his anger. "I will not give rein to my fierce anger ... for I am God, not man: I am the Holy One in your midst and have no wish to destroy" (11 :9). He wants to lead Israel "into the wilderness and speak to her heart.... There she will respond to me as she did when she was young, as she did when she came out of the land of Egypt. When that day comes ... , she will call me 'My husband' ... I will betroth you to myself for ever, betroth you with integrity and justice, with tenderness and love" (2:16-21). It will be a return to the beginnings of the mystical marriage of Yahweh and Israel. This conjugal love already announces



Isaiah: "A remnant of Israel" will return 347
belief in redemption: the grace of God does not wait for man's conversion but precedes it.25 We add that this conjugal symbolism will be used by all the great prophets after Hosea.
118. Isaiah:" A remnant of Israel" will return
Despite the similarity of their vocations, each of the great prophets of Scripture is distinguished by his style of existence, by the way in which he assumes his destiny. Isaiah saw and heard God in the Temple of Jerusalem in 746 or 740. His wife was also a prophetess,
and, like the professional nahUm, he had disciples. 26 He gave his last discourse in 701. At first, Isaiah chiefly criticizes the moral and social situation of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. He does not hesitate to attack even the king and the high officials (Isaiah 3: 12-15). He announces that the judgment of God. will spare no one (2:12-17). Like his predecessors, he declares that the cult does not suffice: "What are your endless sacrifices to me? says Yahweh. I am sick of holocausts of rams and the fat of calves. The blood of bulls and of goats revolts me" (1 : 11). Prayer is vain, for" your hands are covered with blood" (1: 15). The only true devotion consists in practicing justice and doing good: "Learn to do good, search for justice, be just to the orphan, plead for the widow" (1: 17). The Assyrian attack on Syria and Palestine introduces a new element into Isaiah's preaching. The prophet sees in these grave military and political events the intervention of Yahweh in history:
25. Cf. Fohrer, History of the Israelite Religion, p. 250 and note 17 (bibliography). Paradoxically, the conjugal imagery used by Hosea draws upon the Canaanite fertility cult that he opposes; see Ringgren, p.' 283 (Eng. trans., p.
269). But see Andre Neher, L'essence du prophetisme, pp. 247 if., on the "existential" meaning of conjugal symbolism in Hebraic religious thought. Translation of mystical experience into terms of conjugal union will be taken up again in the Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Song of Songs and, especially, in the mystical theology of the Counter Reformation. In contrast, in Vai~lJ.ava mysticism the mystical union between the soul and God is illustrated by the adulterous love between Riidha and Kr~lJ.a.
26. It is important to point out that only the first thirty-nine chapters of the book that bears his name belong to him. The rest is made up of various oracles that are not earlier than the sixth century; the most important of them are the "Deutero-Isaiah" (chaps. 40-55) and the "Trito-Isaiah" (chaps. 56-66). A certain number of fragments were introduced into the Book of Isaiah still later (for example, the apocalypse of chaps. 24-27).



348 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
Assyria is only his instrument. For Isaiah, it is a case of divine vengeance; Yahweh is punishing the religious infidelity that has flowed like a torrent from social injustice and the collapse of moral values. This is why he opposes the king's foreign policy. Coalitions and political maneuvers are chimerical. There is but one hope: faith and confidence in Yahweh. "If you do not stand by me, you will not stand at all" (7: 9b). It is faith in Yahweh, and not Egypt, that can help (31: 1-3). To encourage the king, Isaiah announces a "sign from the Lord" : "The maiden is with child and soon will give birth to a son whom she will call Immanuel" (7:14). Before the child "knows how to refuse evil and choose good," Yahweh will perform many prodigies (7: 16 ff.). This oracle has inspired countless interpretations.27 Christian theological speculation has seen in the child's name, Immanuel (" God with us "), the announcement of the birth of Christ. In any case, the messianic meaning is obvious: Yahweh will raise up in the line of David a just king who will be victorious and whose descendants will reign forever. When the king of Assur invades Palestine, Isaiah declares that he is no longer Yahweh's instrument but simply a tyrant with an insatiable lust for power (10:5-15). Consequently, he too will be destroyed (14: 24-25). The prophet returns tirelessly to the power and sovereignty of God, and he announces the "day of Yahweh," when the Lord will judge the world (2:12-17). This is why he condemns not only the arrogance of the king of Assur but also the social and political sins of Judah-oppression of the poor (3:12-15), luxury (3:16-24), and debauchery (5:11-13), injustice (5:1-7, 23), the stealing of fields (5:8-1O)-sins which he regards as so many acts of rebellion against Yahweh (1 :2-3). He also condemns bad rulers (28: 14-22) and the priests and cult prophets who mock him (28: 7-13). Isaiah believes in the invulnerability of Zion: the holy mountain has been and will be protected by Yahweh against the assaults of all enemies (14:24-32; 17:2-14; 29:1-8; etc.). He also keeps the hope of "a remnant of Israel" that "will return to the mighty God" (10:20-21).28 But the essence of his message was not obeyed, and the

The promise made to Jeremiah 349
prophet does not hide his disillusion. His last discourse predicts the ruin of "the pleasant fields, the fruitful vine"; on "all the happy houses, on the gay city," thorns and briars will grow, "for the palace has been abandoned and the noisy city deserted" (32:9-14).
119. The promise made to Jeremiah
Descended from a priestly family, Jeremiah assumed his vocation in 626 and pursued it, with interruptions, for four decades. In a famous passage he relates the circumstances of his election (Jer. 1: 1 if.). Hesitating before the task laid upon him, he pleaded his youth: "I do not know how to speak: I am a child" (1: 6). But the Lord touched his mouth and strengthened him (1:9 if.). Jeremiah's first discourses are dominated by a particularly dramatic theme: the imminent catastrophe caused by "a people coming from the land of the North": "They are armed with bow and spear, they are cruel and pitiless" (6: 22-23). It would be useless to seek for the historical model for these savage horsemen. The "people coming from the land of the North" takes its place among the mythological images of total destruction. For the invasion will bring the final ruin of the country: "I looked to the earth, to see a formless waste; to the heavens, and their light had gone" (4:23). Reduction to chaos will be the divine punishment for religious infidelity; yet it prepares a new creation, the New Covenant that Jeremiah will later proclaim. For Yahweh is merciful, and the prophet transmits his summons: "Come back, disloyal sons, I want to heal your disloyalty" (3: 22; cf. 4:1 if.). On the death of King Josiah in 609, his son Jehoiakim succeeded him on the throne. He proved to be an odious despot, and Jeremiah did not hesitate to attack him. Standing at the gate of the Temple, he fulminates against all those-priests, prophets, people-who let themselves be deceived by the illusory security of their religious activity (7:1-15; 26:1 if.). "Put no trust in delusive words like these: This is the sanctuary of Yahweh" (7: 5). It is in vain that those who have stolen, killed, committed adultery, perjured themselves, burned incense to Baal run to the Temple, saying: "Now we are safe!", since they are ready to "go on committing these abominations." For Yahweh is not blind (7:9-11). The Lord reminds them ofthe fate of



350 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
the sanctuary of Shiloh, destroyed by the Philistines: there "at first I gave my name a home; see what I have done to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel!" (7:12-13). Jeremiah was arrested, and, but for the protection of certain high officials, he would probably have been condemned to death (26:10 if.). For a long time the prophet could not speak in public.29 The last stage of Jeremiah's preaching began in 595, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem and deported part of the Judean elite. While the new king, Zedekiah, was preparing a revolt with the help of Egypt, Jeremiah attempted to calm the people. Arrested and imprisoned as a traitor, he was later freed by the Babylonians. Soon afterward he left for Egypt with a group of fellow countrymen who were expatriating themselves (chaps. 37-39). He addressed his last discourse to "all the Jews living in the land of Egypt" (44:1). Through his prophet, the Lord rehearsed all the recent catastrophes: " You have seen all the misery I have brought down on Jerusalem and the towns of Judah; today they lie in ruins and uninhabited" (44: 2). Vainly did God send his "servants the prophets"; the people persevered in their wickedness (44:4 if.). To conclude, Yahweh announces yet another destruction: the "remnant of Judah," who had settled in Egypt, will likewise be annihilated (44:12 if.). One of the characteristics of Jeremiah's message is the large number of confessions and references to his personal feelings. 30 He dares to say to God: "Do you mean to be for me a deceptive stream with inconstant waters?" (15: 18). Like Job, he asks: "Why is it that the wicked live so prosperously? Why do scoundrels enjoy peace?" (12:1). He wants to understand the ways of the Lord.31 Yet despite the catastrophes that he predicts, and which in fact occur, Jeremiah does not lose confidence in redemption, even in a new Creation. Like a potter, Yahweh can destroy his work, but he is able to make a new one and a better (18: 6 if.). And indeed, through his prophet,
29. At Yahweh's bidding, Jeremiah consigned his prophecies of misfortune to a book. One day his servant, Baruch, wanted to read some parts of it in the Temple, but he was arrested and taken before the king, who burned the scroll. However, Jeremiah dictated a new book (Jer. 36). 30. See, especially, Jer. 11: 18-23, 12:1-6, 15 :10-12, 17 :12-18, 18 :18-23, and 20:7-18. See also Ringgren, La religion d'Israifl, p. 295 and the bibliographies in notes 2 and 3 (Eng. trans., p. 281 and nn. 97-98).

The fall ofJerusalem. The mission of Ezekiel 351
God announces a New Covenant: "See, the days are coming when I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel (and the House of Judah).... Deep within them I will plant my Law, writing it on their hearts. Then I will be their God and they shall be my people" (31 :31,33). Amos expected the redemption from a new act of love on the part of God which would make it possible for Israel to return "to the days of its youth." Jeremiah dares to hope for a radical regeneration of man. For, "Well you know, Yahweh, the course of man is not in his control" (10: 23). That is why the Lord promises the coming regeneration of his people. "I will give them a different heart and a different behavior so that they will always fear me, for the good of themselves, and their children after them. I will make an everlasting covenant with them; I will not cease in my efforts for their good" (32: 39-40). This is equivalent to a new creation of man, an idea which will have considerable consequences (among others, the Christian conception of a New Covenant revealed in the New Testament).32
120. The fall of Jerusalem. The mission of Ezekiel
"The kings of the earth never believed, nor did all the inhabitants of the world, that oppressor and enemy would ever penetrate the gates of Jerusalem" (Lamentations 4: 12). So exclaims the anonymous author of Lamentations, who witnessed the fall of Jerusalem in 587. "Look, Yahweh, and consider: whom have you ever treated like this? Why, women have eaten their little ones, the children they have nursed in their arms! Why, priest and prophet have been slaughtered in the sanctuary of Yahweh!" (2: 20). The catastrophe had decisive consequences for the history of Israel and for the development of Yahwism. The fall of the political and religious capital meant the disappearance of the state and the end of the Davidic monarchy. The Temple was burned and ruined, which entailed the cessation of sacrifices. A large part of the population was deported. But Babylon was an impure country, where the cult could

352 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
not be practiced. The place of the Temple was taken by the religious school, which, in the course of time, will become the synagogue; here the community gathered periodically for prayers, hymns, and homilies. But the destruction of the Temple was a constant reminder of the disappearance of the nation. That is why prayer for the restoration of national independence was inseparable from prayer for the rebuilding of the Temple.33 Many were those who, at Jerusalem or in exile, doubted the power of Yahweh and adopted the gods of the conquerors. Some even doubted Yahweh's existence. But for others the catastrophe was the supreme proof ofthe Lord's wrath, tirelessly foretold by the prophets. There was an indignant reaction against "optimistic prophets." On the other hand, the great Scriptural prophets gained the esteem and admiration of which they had been deprived in their lifetimes. However, the elite that had been deported to Babylon will look elsewhere in the religious tradition for. the support capable of safeguarding Israel (see volume 2). It was in Babylon, where he arrived with a first group of deportees in 597, that the last great prophet, Ezekiel, carried out his ministry until 571. He was a priest, which explains the importance he attached to ritual purity. For Ezekiel, sins-and first of all idolatry-had made Israel unclean. Yahweh would bring about the redemption of his people by cleansing them with "clean water" (Ezek. 36: 25).34 In the beginning Ezekiel considered his task an ungrateful but indispensable work of demystification: it was necessary to destroy the hopes that the first Judean deportees held for the invulnerability of Jerusalem and, later, to comfort them after the destruction of the holy city.35 In this first period of his preaching, Ezekiel announced the coming end of Jerusalem, the ineluctable consequence of Israel's infidelity. An allegorical story (chap. 23) compares Israel and Samaria (Judah) to two sisters who, though they were loved by Yahweh, "became prostitutes in Egypt when they were but girls" and continued their infidelities with the Assyrians and the Babylonians.
33. The author of Psalm 51 implores God to cleanse and free him and, at the same time, to "rebuild the walls of Jerusalem." "Then there will be proper sacrifice to please you" (Ps. 51: 20-21).

The fall ofJerusalem. The mission of Ezekiel 353
Ezekiel constantly returns to the theme of the unfaithful woman whom Yahweh nevertheless was slow to abandon out of respect for his name (see, e.g., Ezek. 20). Israel's privileged situation is in no way due to merit; it is Yahweh's choice that has singled Israel out among other peoples. But more significant than the interpretation of the historical catastrophe as a crisis in the conjugal union of God and Israel is the idea of Yahweh's omnipresence. The presence of God is not confined to a certain privileged space. Hence it matters little if the believer worships Yahweh in his native country or in a strange land. What matters is his inner life and his conduct to his fellow men. More than any other prophet, Ezekiel addresses the individual.36 The fall of Jerusalem sees the beginning of a new period in Ezekiel's preaching, characterized by hope for the redemption of Israel. For God, nothing is impossible. In ecstasy, Ezekiel sees a "valley full of bones" ; touched by the spirit, the skeletons" returned to life and stood up on their feet." So will the Lord do with the House ofIsrael (37:1-14). In other words, though Israel was dead, it could be resuscitated by a divine prodigy. In another oracle (chap. 36) Yahweh promises the return of the deportees, the reconstruction and proliferation of the people. But above all he announces the redemption of Israel: "I shall pour clean water over you and you will be cleansed.... I shall give you a new heart, and put a new spirit in you.... I shall make you keep my laws and sincerely respect my observances. You will live in the land which I gave your ancestors. You shall be my people and I will be your God" (36: 25-28). As Jeremiah, too, held, there will be a New Covenant, and in fact a new creation. But since the dispersal of Israel raised a question of the Lord's omnipotence and honor, Ezekiel explains this new creation by Yahweh's desire to sanctify his "holy name, which the House of Israel has profaned among the nations" (36: 21). David, prince and shepherd, exemplary "servant" of God, will reign over the new Israel (37:25 ff.; 34:23 ff.). And in the last chapters (40-48), Ezekiel gives a detailed description of the future Temple (whose image he sees in ecstasy) and of the cult as it is to be celebrated in the new Israel. 37
36. Cf. Fohrer, History, p. 319, and the bibliography given in his note 4. 37. Ezekiel's ecstatic vision constitutes the starting point for the "theology of the Temple," which will have a magnificent development in both Judaism and Christianity.



354 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
121. Religious valorization of the "terror of history "
The prophets do not disappear in the last years of the Exile and the postexilic period (see volume 2). But their message develops what could be called the "theology of salvation" outlined by Jeremiah. So it is legitimate at this point to estimate the role of prophecy in the religious history oflsrae1. What strikes us first about the prophets is their criticism of the cult and the ferocity with which they attack syncretism, that is, Canaanite influences, what they call "prostitution." But this "prostitution," against which they never cease to fulminate, represents one of the most widespread forms of cosmic religiosity. Specifically characteristic of agriculturalists, cosmic religiosity continued the most elementary dialectic of the sacred, especially the belief that the divine is incarnated, or manifests itself, in cosmic objects and rhythms. Now such a belief was denounced by the adherents of Yahweh as the worst possible idolatry, and this ever since the Israelites' entrance into Palestine. But never was cosmic religiosity so savagely attacked. The prophets finally succeeded in emptying nature of any divine presence. Whole sectors of the natural world-the "high places," stones, springs, trees, certain crops, certain flowers-will be denounced as unclean because they were polluted by the cult of the Canaanite divinities of fertility.3s The preeminently clean and holy region is the desert alone, for it is there that Israel remained faithful to its God. The sacred dimension of vegetation and, in general, of the exuberant epiphanies of nature will be rediscovered only late, in medieval Judaism. The cult, and first of all blood sacrifices, was also criticized; not only was it corrupted by Canaanite elements, but priests and people alike considered ritual activity to be the perfect form of worship. But, the prophets proclaimed, it is in vain to seek Yahweh in sanctuaries; God sCOrnS sacrifices, festivals, and ceremonies (see, inter alia, Amos 5:4-6, 14-15, 21-23); he demands uprightness and justice (5:24). The preexilic prophets never defined what the cult activity of the believer should be. The problem did not even arise so long as the people did not return to Yahweh. The prophets did not pursue
38. For the same reason, the Christian missionaries in India admitted into their churches only flowers that were not used in Hindu ceremonies, that is, the least beautiful flowers.



Religious valorization of the" terror of history" 355
the reform of the cult but the transformation ofmen.39 It is not until after the fall of Jerusalem that Ezekiel proposes a revised divine office. Desacralization of nature, devalorization of cult activity, in short, the violent and total rejection of cosmic religiosity, and, above all, the decisive importance attributed to spiritual regeneration of the individual by a definitive return to Yahweh were the response of the prophets to the historical crises that threatened the very existence of the two Jewish kingdoms. The danger was great and immediate. The "joy in life" that is bound up with every cosmic religion was not only an apostasy, it was illusory, bound to disappear in the imminent national catastrophe. The traditional forms of cosmic religion, i.e., the mystery of fertility, the dialectic solidarity between life and death, henceforth offered only a false security. Indeed, cosmic religion encouraged the illusion that life does not cease to go on and hence that the nation and the state can survive, despite the gravity of historical crises. In other words, not only the people and the high officials but also the priests and the optimistic prophets tended to assimilate adversities on the historical plane with natural catastrophes (droughts, floods, epidemics, earthquakes, etc.). Now such catastrophes are never total or final. But the preexilic prophets announced not only the ruin of the country and the disappearance of the state; they also proclaimed the danger of total annihilation of the nation. The prophets reacted against the official political optimism and attacked the Davidic monarchy for having encouraged syncretism instead of setting up Yahwism as the state religion. The "future" that they announced was in fact imminent. The prophets never ceased to predict it, in order to change the present by bringing about an inner transformation of the faithful. Their passionate interest in contemporary politics was religious in nature. In fact, the march of events was capable offorcing the sincere conversion of the nation and hence its" salvation," the only possibility for the survival of Israel in history. Fulfillment of the predictions uttered by the prophets confirmed their message and, particularly, the conception that historical events were the -work of Yahweh. In other words, historical events acquired a religious meaning, were transformed into" negative theophanies," into the "wrath" of Yahweh. In this way they

356 ISRAEL: THE TIME OF THE KINGS AND THE PROPHETS
unveiled an inner consistency by proving to be the concrete expression of a single divine will. Thus, for the first time, the prophets valorized history. Historical events will thenceforth have a value in themselves, since they are determined by the will of God. Historical facts thus become "situations" of man face to face with God and, as such, acquire a religious value that nothing thitherto could bestow on them. Hence it is true to say that the Hebrews were the first to discover the meaning of history as an epiphany of God, and this conception, as was to be expected, was taken up again and amplified by Christianity.40 But we must add that the discovery of history as theophany was not immediately and wholly accepted by the Jewish people; the ancient conceptions will survive for a very long time.

15 Dionysus, or
Bliss Recovered
122. Epiphanies and occultations of a "twice-born" god
After more than a century of research, Dionysus still remains an enigma. By his origin, by his particular mode of being, by the type of religious experience that he inaugurates, he stands apart from the other great Greek gods. According to the myth, he is the son of Zeus and a princess, Semele, daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes. Jealous, Hera sets a trap for her-and Semele demands of Zeus that he let her see him in his true form of a celestial god. The presumptuous princess is struck by Zeus's thunderbolt and gives birth prematurely. But Zeus sews the infant into his thigh, and, after some months, Dionysus comes into the world. So he is, indeed, the" twiceborn." Numerous origin myths make the founders of royal families spring from the union of gods with mortal women. But Dionysus is born for the second time from Zeus. It is for this reason that, among the offspring of such unions, he alone is a god. 1 Kretschmer attempted to explain the name Semele by the ThracoPhrygian word designating the earth goddess, and this etymology has been accepted by such eminent scholars as Nilsson and Wilamowitz. Correct or not, the etymology does not help toward understanding the myth. In the first place, it is hard to conceive a hieros gamos between the celestial god and Mother Earth that ends in the destruction of the latter by fire. On the other hand, and this is essential, the earliest mythological traditions emphasize this fact: a mortal woman,2 Semele, gave birth to a god. It was this paradoxical

if., a "mortal woman."



358 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
duality of Dionysus that interested the Greeks, for it alone could explain the paradox of his particular mode of being. Born of a mortal woman, Dionysus did not by right belong to the pantheon of the Olympians; yet he succeeded in getting himself accepted and, in the end, also introduced his mother, Semele. As many references show, Homer knew him, but neither he nor his audience was interested in the "foreign" god, so different from the Olympians. Yet it is to Homer that we owe the earliest testimony concerning Dionysus. The Iliad (6. 128-40) refers to a celebrated episode: the Thracian hero Lycurgus pursues the nursing mothers of Dionysus, "and, all together, they threw the instruments of their cult to the ground," while the god, "filled with terror, leaped into the waves of the sea, and Thetis received him in her bosom trembling: for terrible dread had seized him when the warriors shouted." But Lycurgus "drew down on himself the wrath of the gods," and Zeus blinded him, and he did not live long, for he "was hated of all the immortal gods." In this episode, which includes a pursuit by a "man-wolf" and a dive into the sea, we can decipher the memory of an ancient initiatory scenario.3 However, at the time when Homer evokes it, the meaning and intention of the myth are different. It shows us one of the specific characteristics of Dionysus' destiny: his "persecution" by antagonistic personages. But the myth further testifies to the fact that Dionysus is recognized to be a member of the divine family, for not only Zeus, his father, but all the other gods feel offended by Lycurgus' action. This "persecution" dramatically expresses the resistance against the god's mode of being and his religious message. Perseus advanced with his army against Dionysus and the" sea-women" who accompanied him; according to one tradition, he threw the god into the bottom of the Lernaean lake (Plutarch, De Iside 35). We shall encounter the theme of persecution again when we analyze the Bacchae of Euripides. There have been attempts to interpret such episodes as mythicized recollections of the opposition encountered by the Dionysiac cult. The underlying theory presupposes that Dionysus arrived in Greece comparatively late-that he is, by implication, a "foreign" god. Mter Erwin Rohde, the majority

of scholars regarded Dionysus as a Thracian god, introduced into Greece either directly from Thrace or from Phrygia. But Walter Otto emphasized the archaic and Panhellenic character of Dionysus, and the fact that his name-di-wo-nu-so-jo-is found in a Mycenaean inscription 4 seems to confirm his hypothesis. It is nevertheless true that Herodotus considered that Dionysus was "introduced late"; and in Euripides' Bacchae (line 219) Pentheus speaks of "this latecome god, whoever he may be." Whatever the history of the penetration of the Dionysiac cult into Greece may have been, the myths and mythological fragments that refer to the opposition it encountered have a more profound meaning: they inform us concerning both the Dionysiac religious experience and the particular structure of the god. Dionysus was bound to incite resistance and persecution, for the religious experience that he inspired threatened an entire life-style and a universe of values. There was certainly a threat to the supremacy of the Olympian religion and its institutions. But the opposition was also the expression of a more intimate drama, and one that is abundantly documented in the history of religions: resistance to every absolute religious experience, because such experience can be realized only by denying everything else (by whatever term this may be designated: equilibrium, personality, consciousness, reason, etc.). Walter Otto has well perceived the solidarity between the theme of the "persecution" of Dionysus and the typology of his many and various epiphanies. Dionysus is a god who shows himself suddenly and then disappears mysteriously. At the Agriona festivals of Chaeronea, the women sought him in vain and came back with the news that the god had gone to the home of the Muses, who had hidden him (Otto, Dionysos, p. 79). He disappears by diving to the bottom of Lerna or into the sea, and he reappears-as in the Anthesteria festival-in a ship on the waves. Allusions to his "awakening" in his cradle (Otto, pp. 82 fr.) point to the same mythical theme. These periodical epiphanies and occultations place Dionysus among the gods of vegetation.5 And in fact he shows a

Attempts have been made to see in Dionysus a tree god or a god of grain or the vine, and the myth of his dismemberment has been interpreted as illustrating the "passion" of cereals or the preparation of wine (already in the mythographers cited by Diodorus Siculus 3. 62).



360 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
certain solidarity with the life of plants: ivy and the pine became almost his attributes, and his most popular festivals coincide with the agricultural calendar. But Dionysus is related to the totality of life, as is shown by his relations with water and germination, blood or sperm, and by the excess of vitality manifested in his animal epiphanies (bull, lion, goat).6 His unexpected manifestations and disappearances in a way reflect the appearance and occultation of life-that is, the alternation of life and death and, in the last analysis, their unity. But this is no "objective" observation of that cosmic phenomenon, whose banality could inspire no religious idea and produce no myth. By his epiphanies and his occultations, Dionysus reveals the mystery, and the sacrality, of the conjunction of life and death. This revelation is religious in nature, since it is effected by the actual presence of the god. For these appearances and disappearances are not always connected with the seasons. Dionysus shows himself in winter, and he disappears at the same spring festival at which he has his most triumphant epiphany. Disappearance, occultation are mythological expressions of the descent to Hades, hence of death. And indeed, the tomb of Dionysus was shown at Delphi; he was also said to have died at Argos. Then too, when, in the Argive ritual, Dionysus is called up from the depths of the sea (Plutarch, De Iside 35), it is from the land of the dead that he rises. According to an Orphic hymn (no. 53), when Dionysus is absent, he is considered to be with Persephone. Finally, the myth of Zagreus-Dionysus, which we shall discuss further on, relates the violent death of the god, killed, dismembered, and devoured by the Titans. These various but complementary aspects of Dionysus are still perceptible in his public rituals, despite their inevitable "purifications" and reinterpretations.
123. The archaism of some public festivals
From the time of Pisistratus, four festivals in honor of Dionysus were celebrated at Athens.7 The Rural Dionysia, which took place
6. See the texts and references discussed by W. Otto, Dionysos, pp. 162-64. 7. The fact that two of these festivals bear the names of the months that correspond to them-Lenaeon and Anthesterion-proves their archaism and their panhellenic character.



The archaism of some public festivals 361
in December, were village festivals. A large phallus was carried in procession, a numerous crowd accompanying it with songs. Essentially an archaic ceremony, and widely disseminated throughout the world, the phallophoria certainly preceded the cult of Dionysus. Other ritual diversions included competitions and contests and, above all, parades of maskers or persons disguised as animals. Here too the rites preceded Dionysus, but it is understandable how the god of wine came to lead the procession of maskers. We are much less well informed concerning the Lenaea, celebrated in midwinter. A quotation from Heraclitus states that the word Lenai and the verb" to perform the Lenai" were used as equivalents to "Bacchants" and "to play the Bacchant." The god was invoked with the assistance of the daidouchos. According to a gloss on a verse of Aristophanes, the Eleusinian priest, "torch in hand, utters: 'Call the god I' and the hearers cry: 'Son of Semele, Iacchus,8 giver of riches I' " The Anthesteria were celebrated in approximately February/ March, and the Greater Dionysia, instituted later, in March/April. Thucydides (2. 15. 4) regarded the Anthesteria as the earliest festival of Dionysus. It was also the most important. The first day was called Pithoegia, the opening of the earthenware jars (pithoi) in which the wine had been kept since the autumn harvest. The casks were conveyed to the sanctuary of Dionysus in the Marsh to make libations to the god, and then the new wine was tasted. The second day (called Choes, the "jugs") saw a contest of drinkers: they were supplied with a jug full of wine and at a given signal swallowed the contents as fast as possible. Like certain competitions at the Rural Dionysia (for example, the askoliasmos, in which young men tried to keep their balance as long as possible on an oiled wineskin), this competition also fits into the well-known scenario of competitions and jousts of every kind (in sports, oratory, etc.) that promote the renovation of life.9 But euphoria and intoxication in a way anticipate life in a beyond that does not resemble the gloomy Homeric otherworld.
S. The genius of the processions of the Eleusinian Mysteries, Iacchus, was assimilated to Dionysus; the sources are discussed by W. Otto, Dionysos, p. SO; cf. Jeanmaire, Dionysos, p. 47. 9. This is, of course, an extremely archaic scenario that is universally disseminated; one of the most important inheritances from prehistory, it still holds a privileged place in all types of societies.



362 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
The day of the Choes was also the occasion for a procession representing the god's entrance into the city. Since he was believed to arrive from the sea, the procession included a boat borne on four chariot wheels and carrying Dionysus holding a vine and, with him, two satyrs playing flutes. The procession, made up pf numerous participants, probably disguised, and a sacrificial bull, preceded by a flute-player and garland-bearers, made its way to the Lenaeum, an ancient sanctuary open only on that day. There various ceremonies took place, in which the basilinna, "the queen," that is, the wife of the king-archon, and four ladies-in-waiting took part. From this moment, the basilinna, heiress of the city's ancient queens, was regarded as the spouse of Dionysus. She rode beside him in the cart, and a new procession, of the nuptial type, made its way to the Boucoleum, the old royal residence. Aristotle states that it is in the boucoleum (literally, "ox stable") that the hierogamy between the god and the queen was consummated (Ath. Pol. 3. 5). The choice of the Boucoleum indicates that the taurine epiphany of Dionysus was still familiar. Attempts have been made to interpret this union in a symbolic sense, and the god has been supposed to have been impersonated by the archon. But Walter Otto rightly emphasizes the importance of Aristotle's testimony.1o The basilinna receives the god in the house of her husband, heir to the kings-and Dionysus reveals himself as a king. Probably this union symbolizes the marriage of the god to the entire city, with the auspicious consequences that can be imagined. But it is an act characteristic of Dionysus, a divinity whose epiphanies are brutal and who demands that his supremacy be publicly proclaimed. We know of no other Greek cult in which a god is believed to unite himself with the queen. But the three days of the Anthesteria, especially the second day, that of Dionysus' triumph, are days of ill omen, for the souls of the dead return and, with them, the keres, bearers of maleficent influences from the infernal world. In addition, the last day of the Anthesteria was dedicated to them. Prayers were offered for the dead, a pan
10. The union is completely different from the one, for example, of Bel at Babylon (the company of a hierodule when the god came to stay in the temple), or that of the priestess who had to sleep in the temple of Apollo, at Patara, in order to receive directly from the god the wisdom that she was to reveal through the oracle; see Otto, p. 84.



Euripides and Dionysiac orgiasm 363
spermia, a gruel made from various grains, was prepared and had to be consumed before dark. And at nightfall there was a general cry: "To the gate, keres! The Anthesteria are over!" This ritual scenario is well known and is documented almost everywhere in agricultural civilizations. The dead and the powers of the otherworld govern fertility and riches and are their bestowers. "It is from the dead," the author of a Hippocratic treatise writes, "that food, growth, and seeds come to us." In all the ceremonies consecrated to him, Dionysus reveals himself as at once the god of fertility and of death. Heraclitus (frag. 15) already said that "Hades and Dionysus [are] one and the same." We referred above to Dionysus' connections with water, humidity, vegetable sap. The "miracles" that accompany or foretell his epiphanies must also be mentioned: water springing from rock, rivers filled with milk and honey. At Teos a spring of wine gushes out on the day of his festival (Diodorus Siculus, 3. 66. 2). At Elis, three empty bowls, left overnight in a sealed room, are found to be full of wine the next morning (Pausanias, 6. 2. 6. 1-2). Similar" miracles" are documented elsewhere. The most famous was the "vines of a day," which flowered and produced grapes in a few hours; this occurred in various places, for a number of authors mention it.ll
124. Euripides and Dionysiac orgiasm
Such "miracles" are distinctive of the frantic and ecstatic cult of Dionysus, which reflects the most original and in all probability the most archaic element of the god. In Euripides' Bacchae we have inestimable testimony to what the encounter between the Greek genius and Dionysiac orgiasm may have been. Dionysus himself is the protagonist of the Bacchae, which is something unprecedented in ancient Greek drama. Outraged that his cult is still unrecognized in Greece, Dionysus arrives from Asia with a troop of maenads and stops at Thebes, his mother's birthplace. The three daughters of King Cadmus deny that their sister Semele had been loved by Zeus and had given birth to a god. Dionysus smites them with "madness," and his aunts, together with the other Theban women, rush away to
11. Sophocles, Thyestes (frag. 234), and the other sources cited by Otto, pp.98-99.



364 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
the mountains, where they celebrate orgiastic rites. Pentheus, who had succeeded to the throne ofhis grandfather Cadmus, had forbidden the cult, and, despite the advice he had received, he persisted in his intransigence. Disguised as an officiant of his own cult, Dionysus is captured and imprisoned by Pentheus. But he escapes miraculously and even succeeds in persuading Pentheus to go and spy on the women during their orgiastic ceremonies. Discovered by the maenads, Pentheus is torn to pieces; his own mother, Agave, brings back his head in triumph, believing it to be the head of a lion.12 Whatever Euripides' intention may have been when, at the end of his life, he wrote the Bacchae, this masterpiece of Greek tragedy is also the most important document concerning the Dionysiac cult. The theme "resistance, persecution, and triumph" here finds its most brilliant illustration.13 Pentheus opposes Dionysus because he is a "foreigner, a preacher, a sorcerer ... with beautiful perfumed blond curls, rosy cheeks, and in his eyes the grace of Aphrodite. Under the pretext of teaching the sweet and charming practices of the evoe, he corrupts girls" (Bacch. 233 fr.). Women are inspired to forsake their houses and run about the mountains by night, dancing to the music of tabors and flutes. And Pentheus principally fears the power of wine, for "with women, as soon as the juice of the grape figures in the feast, everything is unwholesome in these devotions" (260-62). However, it is not wine that brings on the ecstasy of the bacchantes. One of Pentheus' servants, who had come upon them on Cithaeron at dawn, describes them as dressed in fawnskins, crowned with ivy, girdled with snakes, carrying in their arms and giving suck to fawns or wild wolf-cubs (695 fr.). Specifically Dionysiac miracles abound: the bacchantes strike the rocks with their thyrsi, and water or wine flows out; they scratch the ground, and milk bubbles up from it; and the ivy-wreathed thyrsi drip honey. "Certainly," the servant goes on,
12. There are other examples of "madness" brought on by Dionysus when he was not recognized as a god, e.g., the women of Argos (Apollodorus 2. 2. 2; 3. 5. 2) and the daughters of Minyas at Orchomenos, who tore to pieces and devoured the son of one of them (Plutarch, Quaest. gr. 38. 29ge). 13. In the fifth century, Thebes had become the center of the cult, for it was there that Dionysus had been conceived, and there, too, was Semele's tomb. Nevertheless, the resistance of the earlier times had not been forgotten, and one of the lessons of the Bacchae was certainly this: that a god must not be rejected because he is considered "new."



Euripides and Dionysiac orgiasm 365
"if you had been there, you would have been converted to this god whom you scorn, and addressed your prayers to him after such a sight" (712-14). Discovered by Agave, the servant and his companions come near to being torn to pieces. The bacchantes then fling themselves on the animals grazing in the field and, "with no sword in hand," tear them to shreds. "Under the effect of a thousand girls' hands," threatening bulls are torn to pieces in the twinkling of an eye. The maenads then sweep down on the plains. "They caught up infants from their houses. Whatever they put on their shoulders stays there unbound, without falling into the mud, even bronze, even iron. On their hair fire darts, but without burning. Furious at being pillaged by the bacchae, the people rush to arms. And this is the miracle that was to be seen, lord: the javelins thrown at them drew no blood, and they, darting their thyrsi, wound the folk" (754-63). It would serve no purpose to emphasize the difference between these frantic and savage nocturnal rites and the public Dionysiac festivals that we discussed above (§ 123). Euripides presents us with a secret cult, specifically characteristic of the Mysteries. "These mysteries, according to thee, what are they?" Pentheus asks. And Dionysus replies: "Their secrecy forbids communicating them to those who are not bacchants." "What use are they to those who celebrate them?" "It is not permitted thee to learn that, but they are things worthy to be known" (470-74). The mystery consisted in the participation of the bacchantes in the total epiphany of Dionysus. The rites are celebrated at night, far from cities, in the mountains and forests. Through the sacrifice of the victim by tearing it to pieces (sparagmos) and the consumption of the raw flesh (omophagia), communion with the god is realized. For the animals that are torn apart and devoured are epiphanies, or incarnations, of Dionysus. All the other experiences-exceptional physical strength, invulnerability to fire and weapons, the prodigies (water, wine, milk, springing from the ground), "familiarity" with snakes and the young of wild beasts-are made possible by enthusiasm, by identification with the god. The Dionysiac ecstasy means, above all, surpassing the human condition, the discovery of total deliverance, obtaining a freedom and spontaneity inaccessible to human beings. That among these freedoms there also figured deliverance from prohibitions, rules, and conventions of an ethical and social order



366 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
appears to be certain-which explains, in part, the mass adherence of women.14 But the Dionysiac experience touched the deepest levels. The bacchantes who devoured raw flesh reintegrated a behavior that had been suppressed for tens of thousands of years; such frenzies revealed a communion with vital and cosmic forces that could be interpreted only as a divine possession. That the possession was confused with "madness," mania, was to be expected. Dionysus himself had experienced "madness," and the bacchante only shared in the ordeals and passion of the god; in the last analysis, it was one of the surest methods of communicating with him. The Greeks knew other cases of mania brought on by gods. In Euripides' tragedy Heracles, the hero's madness is the work of Hera; in Sophocles' Ajax, it is Athena who produces the insanity. Corybantism, which the ancients compared with Dionysiac orgiasm, was a mania brought on by possession by the Corybantes, and the treatment of it ended in nothing short of an initiation. But what distinguishes Dionysus and his cult is not these psychopathic crises but the fact that they were valorized as religious experience, whether as a punishment or as a favor from the god.1s In the last analysis, the interest of comparisons with apparently similar rites or collective movements-for example, certain convulsive dances of the Middle Ages or the ritual omophagy of the Aissawa, a mystical brotherhood of North Africa16-lies precisely in the fact that they reveal the originality of the Dionysian religion. It is very seldom that there suddenly appears in the historic period a god so laden with an archaic heritage: rites involving theriomorphic masks, phallophoria, sparagmos, omophagy, anthropophagy, mania,
14. Teiresias, however, defends the god: "Dionysus does not oblige women to be chaste. Chastity depends on character, and the woman who is naturally
chaste will take part in his orgies without being corrupted" (Bacch. 314 if.). 15. What separates a shaman from a psychopath is that he succeeds in curing himself and ends by possessing a stronger and more creative personality than the rest of the community. 16. Rohde compared the spread of the ecstatic religion of Dionysus with the epidemics of convulsive dances in the Middle Ages. R. Eisler drew attention to the Aissawa (Clsawiyya), who practice ritual omophagy (called/rissa, from the verb /arassa, "to tear"). Mystically identified with carnivores, whose names they bear (jackalls, panthers, lions, cats, dogs), the adepts tear up, disembowel, and eat bovines, wolves, rams, sheep, and goats. The chewing of the raw flesh is followed by a frantic dance of jubilation, "in order savagely to enjoy ecstasy and communicate with the divinity" (R. BruneI).



Euripides and Dionysiac orgiasm 367
enthousiasmos. Most remarkable of all is the fact that, while still preserving this heritage, a residue from prehistory, the cult of Dionysus, once it was integrated into the spiritual universe of the Greeks, never ceased to create new religious values. Indeed, the frenzy brought on by divine possession-" madness"-interested many authors and often provoked irony and derision. Herodotus (4. 78-80) relates the adventure of a Scythian king, Skyles, who at Olbia, on the Borysthenes (Dnieper), had himself" initiated into the rites of Dionysus Baccheus." During the ceremony (telete), possessed by the god, he played "the bacchant and the madman." In all probability this refers to a procession in which the initiates, "under the empire ofthe god," let themselves be carried away by a frenzy which the onlookers, as well as those who were possessed, considered to be "madness" (mania). Herodotus was satisfied to recount a story that had been told to him at Olbia. Demosthenes, in a famous passage (De corona 259), while attempting to ridicule his adversary, Aeschines, in fact reveals to us certain rites celebrated by thiasoi (private religious organizations) at Athens in the fourth century in honor of Sabazius, a Thracian god homologous with Dionysus. (The ancients regarded him as the Thracian Dionysus under his indigenous name.)17 Demosthenes refers to rites followed by readings from "books" (probably a written text, containing hieroi logoi); he speaks of "nebrizing" (reference to the fawnskin, nebris; possibly what was involved was a sacrifice including the eating of the raw animal), of" craterizing" (the krater was the vessel in which wine and water, the "mystical beverage," were mixed), of "purification" (katharmos), consisting principally of rubbing the initiate with clay and flour. Finally, the acolyte raised the initiate, prostrated or lying on the ground, and the initiate repeated the formula: "I have escaped from evil and found better." And the whole assemblage burst out in loud cries (ololyge). The next morning saw the procession of the initiates, crowned with fennel and branches of white poplar. Aeschines marched at the head of it, brandishing snakes and shouting: "Evoe, mysteries of Sabazius!" and dancing to cries of" Hyes, Attes, Attes, Hyes." Demosthenes also mentions a basket in the shape of a fan,
17. According to the ancient glosses, the term saboi (or sabaioi) was the equivalent, in the Phrygian language, of the Greek bacchos; see Jeanmaire, Dionysos. pp. 95-97.



368 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
the liknon, the "mystical winnowing fan," the original cradle of the infant Dionysus. At the center of the Dionysiac ritual, we always find, in one form or another, an ecstatic experience of a more or less violent frenzy: mania. This" madness" was in a way the proof that the initiate was entheos, "filled with the god." The experience was certainly unforgettable, for there was a sharing in the creative spontaneity and intoxicating freedom, in the superhuman force and invulnerability of Dionysus. Communion with the god shattered the human condition for a time, but it did not succeed in transmuting it. There is no reference to immortality in the Bacchae or in so late a work as the Dionysiaca of Nonnus. This suffices to distinguish Dionysus from Zalmoxis, with whom he has been compared, and sometimes confused, since Rohde; for that god of the Getae "immortalized" the initiates into his mysteries. But the Greeks did not yet dare to bridge the infinite distance that, in their eyes, separated divinity from the human condition.
125. When the Greeks rediscover the presence of the God
The initiatory and secret character of the private thiasoi seems to be certain (see Bacchae 470-74),18 even though at least a part of the ceremonies (for example, the processions) were public. It is hard to determine when, and under what circumstances, the secret and initiatory Dionysiac rites assumed the particular function of the Mystery religions. Highly esteemed scholars (Nilsson, Festugiere) deny the existence of a Dionysiac Mystery on the ground of the complete lack of definite references to any eschatological hope. But, especially in the ancient period, we are very poorly informed concerning secret rites, to say nothing of their esoteric meaning (which must have existed, since esoteric meanings of secret and initiatory rites are documented all over the world and on all levels of culture). In addition, the morphology of the eschatological hope must not be limited to the expressions made familiar by Orphism or the Mysteries of the Hellenistic period. The occultation and epiphany
18. It should be remembered in this connection that during the festival of the Anthesteria certain rites were performed only by women, and in the strictest secrecy.



When the Greeks rediscover the presence of the God 369
of Dionysus, his descents to Hades (comparable to a death followed by a resurrection), and, above all, the cult of the Infant Dionysus,19 with rites celebrating his "awakening"-even leaving aside the mythico-ritual theme of Dionysus-Zagreus, which we shall emphasize in a moment-indicate the will, and the hope, for a spiritual renewal. Everywhere in the world the divine infant is charged with an initiatory symbolism revealing the mystery of a "rebirth" of a mystical nature. (For religious experience, it matters very little whether such symbolism is understood intellectually or not.) It must be recalled that the cult of Sabazius, identified with Dionysus, already presented the structure of a mystery (" I have escaped from evil! "). To be sure, the Bacchae does not mention immortality; however, communion, even provisional, with the god was not without consequences for the postmortem condition of the bacchos. The presence of Dionysus in the Eleusinian Mysteries permits us to suspect the eschatological meaning of at least certain orgiastic experiences. But it is especially from the time of Dionysus-Zagreus that the Mystery character of the cult becomes definite. The myth of the dismemberment of the infant Dionysus-Zagreus is known to us chiefly through Christian authors.20 As was to be expected, they present it euhemerized, incomplete, and with malevolence. But precisely because they were free from the prohibition against speaking openly of sacred and secret things, the Christian writers have transmitted a number of precious details. Hera sends the Titans, who first attract the infant Dionysus-Zagreus with certain playthings (rattles, crepundia, a mirror, knucklebones, a ball, a top, a bull-roarer) and then slaughter him and cut him to pieces. They boil the pieces in a kettle and, according to some authorities, eat them. A goddess-Athena, Rhea, or Demeter-receives, or saves, the heart and puts it in a coffer. Informed of the crime, Zeus destroys the Titans with his thunderbolt. The Christian authors do not mention the resurrection of Dionysus, but this episode was known to the ancients. The Epicurean Philodemus, a contemporary of Cicero, speaks of the three births of Dionysus, "the first from his mother,
19. The cult of the Infant Dionysus was known in Boeotia and in Crete, but
it ended by also spreading into all of Greece. 20. Firmicus Maternus, De errore prof. relig. 6; Clement of Alexandria, Protrept. 2.17.2; 18.2; Arnobius, Adv. Nat. 5.19; the texts are reproduced in Kern, Orphica!ragmenta, pp. 110-11.

the second from the thigh, and the third when, after his dismemberment by the Titans, Rhea gathered together his limbs and he came to life again." 21 Firmicus Maternus ends by adding that in Crete (where he localizes his euhemerized story) the murder was commemorated by yearly rites, which repeated what "the child had done and suffered at the moment of his death": "in the depths of the forests, by the strange cries they utter, they feign the madness of a raging soul," giving it out that the crime was committed through madness, and "they tear a living bull with their teeth." The mythico-ritual theme of the passion and resurrection of the infant Dionysus-Zagreus has given rise to endless controversies, especially because of its" Orphic" interpretations. For our purpose, it will suffice to point out that the information transmitted by the Christian authors is corroborated by earlier documents. The name of Zagreus is mentioned for the first time in an epic poem of the Theban cycle, Alcmaeonis (sixth century B.C.): 22 it means "great hunter," which corresponds with the savage, orgiastic character of Dionysus. As for the crime of the Titans, Pausanias (8.37.5) has provided us with a piece of information that, despite the skepticism of Wilamowitz and other scholars, remains precious. He reports that Onomacritus, who lived in Athens in the sixth century B.C., in the period of the Pisistratids, wrote a poem on this subject: "Having taken the name of the Titans from Homer, he founded orgia of Dionysus, making the Titans the authors of the god's sufferings." According to this myth, the Titans, when they approached the divine infant, were powdered with plaster, so as not to be recognized. Now in the mysteries of Sabazius, celebrated at Athens, one of the initiation rites consisted in dusting the candidates with a powder or with plaster.23 The two facts have been connected since antiquity (cf. Nonnus, Dionys. 27. 228 ff.). But what we have here is a form of archaic initiation ritual, well known in primitive societies: the
21. Philodemus, De piet. 44; Jeanmaire, Dionysos, p. 382. 22. Frag. 3 Kinkel, vol. 1, p. 77; see also Euripides, frag. 472; for Callimachus (frag. 171) Zagreus is a special name of Dionysus; see other examples, in Otto, Dionysos, pp. 191 fr. 23. Demosthenes, De corona 259. When they took part in the Dionysiac festivals, the Argives covered their faces with chalk or plaster. The relations between chalk (titanos) and the Titans (Titanes) have been emphasized. But this mythico-ritual complex was occasioned by confusion between the two terms (see Farnell, Cults, vol. 5, p. 172).



When the Greeks rediscover the presence of the God 371
novices rub their faces with powder or ashes in order to resemble ghosts; in other words, they undergo a ritual death. As for" mystical playthings," they have long been known; a papyrus of the third century B.C., found at Faiyum and unfortunately mutilated, mentions the top, the bull-roarer, knucklebones, and the mirror (Orph. Frag. 31). The most dramatic episode of the myth-especially the fact that, after dismembering the infant, the Titans threw his limbs into a caldron, where they boiled them and then roasted them-was known, with all its details, in the fourth century B.C.; what is more, all these details were rehearsed in connection with "the celebration of the mysteries."24 Jeanmaire has cogently pointed out that boiling in a caldron or passing through fire are initiation rites that confer immortality (cf. the episode of Demeter and Demophoon) or rejuvenation (the daughters of Pelias cut up their father and boiled him in a caldron).25 Add that the two rites-dismemberment and boiling or passing through fire-are characteristic of shamanic initiations. So we can recognize in the "crime 9f the Titans" an ancient initiatory scenario whose original meaIiing had been forgotten. For the Titans behave like Masters ofInitiation, that is to say, they" kill" the novice in order to cause him to be "reborn" to a higher mode of existence (in our example, we could say that they confer divinity and immortality on the infant Dionysus). But in a religion that proclaimed the absolute supremacy of Zeus, the Titans could play only a demonic role, and they were incinerated by Zeus's thunderbolt. According to some variants, men were created from their ashes, and this myth played a considerable role in Orphism. The initiatory character of the Dionysiac rites can also be perceived at Delphi, when the women celebrated the god's rebirth; for the Delphic winnowing fan "contained a dismembered Dionysus ready to be reborn, a Zagreus," as Plutarch testifies (De [side 35), and this Dionysus, "who was reborn as Zagreus, was at the same time the Theban Dionysus, son of Zeus and Semele." 26
24. Cf. the "problem" attributed to Aristotle (Didot, Aristote 4. 331. 15), discussed, after Salomon Reinach, by Moulinier, Orphee et l'orphisme, p. 51. In the third century, Euphorion knew a similar tradition (ibid., p. 53). 25. Jeanmaire, Dionysos, p. 387. See other examples in Marie Delcourt,

372 DIONYSUS, OR BLISS RECOVERED
Diodorus Siculus seems to refer to the Dionysiac mysteries when he writes that "Orpheus transmitted in the ceremonies of the mysteries the tearing-to-pieces of Dionysus" (5. 75. 4). And in another passage Diodorus presents Orpheus as a reformer of the Dionysiac mysteries: "This is why the initiations due to Dionysus are called Orphic" (3. 65. 6). The tradition transmitted by Diodorus is valuable insofar as it confirms the existence of Dionysiac mysteries. But it is probable that, as early as the fifth century B.C., these mysteries had already borrowed certain "Orphic" elements. And in fact Orpheus was then proclaimed "prophet of Dionysus" and "founder of all initiations" (see chap. 19 of vol. 2).
More than the other Greek gods, Dionysus astonishes by the multiplicity and novelty of his epiphanies, by the variety of his transformations. He is always in motion; he makes his way everywhere, into all countries, among all peoples, into every religious milieu, ready to associate himself with various divinities (even with such antagonistic deities as Demeter and Apollo). He is certainly the only Greek god who, revealing himself under different aspects, dazzles and attracts both peasants and the intellectual elite, politicians and contemplatives, orgiastics and ascetics. Intoxication, eroticism, universal fertility, but also the unforgettable experiences inspired by the periodic arrival of the dead, or by mania, by immersion in animal unconsciousness, or by the ecstasy of enthousiasmos-all these terrors and revelations spring from a single source: the presence ofthe god. His mode of being expresses the paradoxical unity of life and death. This is why Dionysus constitutes a type of divinity radically different from the Olympians. Was he nearer to human beings than the other gods? In any case, one could approach him, could even incorporate him; and the ecstasy of mania proved that the human condition could be surpassed. These rituals were capable of unexpected developments. The dithyramb, tragedy, the satyr play are, more or less directly, Dionysiac creations. It is absorbing to follow the transformation of a collective rite, the dithyrambos, involving ecstatic frenzy, into a

spectacle and finally into a literary form.27 If, on the one hand, certain public liturgies became spectacles and made Dionysus the god of the theater, other rituals, secret and initiatory, developed into Mysteries. At least indirectly, Orphism is indebted to the Dionysiac traditions. More than any other Olympian, this young god will not cease to gratify his worshipers with new epiphanies, unexpected messages, and eschatological hopes.
27. The dithyramb, "a round dance intended, at the sacrifice of a victim, to bring on collective ecstasy with the help of rhythmical movements and ritual acclamations and vociferations was able-and precisely during the period (seventh-sixth centuries) in which the great genre of the choral lyric was developing in the Greek world-to evolve into a literary form by the increasing importance of the parts sung by the exarchon, by the insertion of lyric passages on themes more or less adapted to the circumstance and to the person of Dionysus" (Jeanmaire, Dionysos, pp. 248-49).

For a rapid initiation into universal prehistory, see Grahame Clark, World Prehistory (Cambridge, 1962); Grahame Clark and Stuart Piggott, Prehistoric Societies (London, 1965) (this work contains a rich bibliography); H. Breuil and R. Lantier, Les hommes de la pierre ancienne; pa/eolithique et mesolithique, rev. ed. (Payot, 1959) (Eng. trans., The Men of the Old Stone Age [Palaeolithic and Mesolithic], trans. B. B. Rafter [London, 1965]). A more complete documentation will be found in H. Mi.iller-Karpe, Handbuch der Vorgeschichte, vol. 1: Altsteinzeit (Munich, 1966), and in the first volume published under the editorship of Karl J. Narr, Handbuch der Urgeschichte (Bern and Munich, 1967). Karl Narr has provided an excellent summary, completed by an extensive bibliography, in Abriss der Vorgeschichte (Munich, 1957), pp. 8-41. See also his Urgeschichte der Kultur (Stuttgart, 1961); F. Bordes, Old Stone Age (New York, 1968), and La prehistoire: Prob!emes et tendances, Editions du CNRS (Paris, 1968).
An analysis of recent hypotheses on the origins of language and society can be found in Frank B. Livingstone, "Genetics, Ecology and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy," CA 10 (February 1969): 45-61 (bibliography, pp. 60-61). On the origin of language we follow Morris Swadesh, The Origin and Diversification of Language (Chicago, 1971).
In several of his studies Karl Narr has examined the hypotheses put forward concerning the" hominization" of the primates and has attempted to present a probable picture of the Paleanthropians; see, inter alia, "Approaches to the Social Life of Earliest Man," Anthropos 57 (1962): 604-20; "Das Individuum in der Urgeschichte: Moglichkeiten seiner Erfassung," Saeculum 23 (1972): 252-65.

See also Frederick D. McCarthy, "Recent Development and Problems in the Prehistory of Australia," Paideuma 14 (1968): 1-17; Peter Bellwood, "The Prehistory of Oceania," CA 16 (1975): 9-28. During tens of millennia the sequence of the Paleolithic culture is the same in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The same sequence is found in Australia and in North and South America, though the temporal horizon is much shorter. For the period 20,000-10,000 B.C. it cannot be said that anyone region obtained a decisive technological advance over the others. To be sure, there are variations in the structure of tools, but these variations presumably reflect local adaptations and not a technological progress; see Marvin Harris, Culture, Man, and Nature (New York, 1971), p. 169. This cultural unity of the Paleolithics constitutes the common source of the traditions inherited by later cultures; in addition, it permits comparison with contemporary hunting societies. For an admirable analysis of Paleolithic "survivals" in certain Greek myths and rites, see Walter Burkert, Homo Necans (Berlin, 1972). On the hunting cultures, see the symposium Man the Hunter, edited by Richard B. Lee and Irven Devore (Chicago, 1968).
2. In order to understand why scholars have hesitated to admit the possibility of a consistent and complex religiosity among the Paleanthropians, it is necessary to remember that, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the term "religion" had a decidedly limited application, the rest being designated by various pejorative terms: "magic," "superstition," "savagery," etc. Some writers referred to "men without religion," because they had found nothing in certain tribes that could be compared to the familiar polytheisms and "fetishistic systems." The supporters of "religiosity" were accused of idealizing the Paleanthropians, because" religion" was taken to mean an ideological complex comparable to Judeo-Christianity, Hinduism, or the pantheons of the ancient Near East. Nothing would be gained by citing all the works devoted to prehistoric religions; most of them retain only a bibliographical interest. The following may be consulted for their documentations or their advanced hypotheses: T. Mainage, Les religions de la prehistoire (Paris, 1921); G. H. Luquet, L'art et la religion des hommes fossiles (Paris, 1926); C. Clemen, Urgeschichtliche Religion, 2 vols. (Bonn, 1932-33); E. O. James, Prehistoric Religion (London and New York, 1957).

Leroi-Gourhan distinguishes, stylistically and chronologically, five periods in Paleolithic art: (1) developed Mousterian (about 50,000 B.C.), in which bones and "small stone slabs bearing regularly spaced incisions" are documented but no figurative works yet appear; (2) the Primitive period (Aurignacian, about 30,000 B.C.), which has yielded engraved or painted figures, on calcareous slabs, "of very abstract and very crude figures, representing heads or foreparts of usually unidentifiable animals mingled with genital representations," and, later (about 25,000-20,000 B.C.), human figures complying with a very similar stylization: "the central part of the body is enormous in comparison with the head and the extremities, which has given rise to the idea of particularly steatopygous Paleolithic women"; (3) the Archaic period (late Solutrean, about 30,000-25,000 B.C.), including several sites of the greatest importance (Lascaux, La Pasiega) ("Technical mastery is now complete, and the paintings, sculptures, or engravings display an extraordinary quality of execution"); (4) the Classic period (Magdalenian, about 15,000-11,000 B.C.), when the decorated caves attain their maximum in geographic extension: realism of forms is carried very far; (5) and the Late period (late Magdalenian, about 10,000 B.C.), in which caves are no longer decorated and the art is essentially mobiliary: "The figures have lost the last traces of the antique styles, the animals are integrated into a realism in which precision of form and movement is striking. This mobiliary art now extends northward to Great Britain, Belgium, and Switzerland. About 9000 B.C. a rather sudden decline marks the end of the Upper Paleolithic; the few examples from the closing Magdalenian dissolve into crudity and schematism" (Les religions de la prehistoire, pp. 87-88).

Suggestive observations on the symbolism of prehistoric art and its stylistic expressions will be found in the studies by Herbert KUhn, "Das Symbol in der Vorzeit Europas," Symbolon 2 (1961): 160-84, and by Walther Matthes, "Die Darstellung von Tier und Mensch in der Plastik des alteren Paliiolithikum," ibid. 4 (1964): 244-76. The publications by H. Begouen, N. Casteret, and J. Charet on the Montespan and Tuc d'Aubert caves are discussed by Ucko and Rosenfeld, Palaeolithic Cave Art, pp. 188-98, 177-78. The engraved slate slab from Lourdes is reproduced by Maringer, The Gods of Prehistoric Man, fig. 27. It has been suggested that the scene engraved on a bone excavated in the La Vache cave (Ariege) should be interpreted as indicating an initiation ceremony; see Louis-Rene Nougier
and Romain Robert, "Scene d'initiation de la grotte de la Vache a Alliat (Ariege)," Bull. de la Soc. de I'Ariege 23 (1968): 13-98. A clear reproduction of the design will be found in Alexander Marshak, The Roots of Civilization (New York, 1972), p. 275, fig. 154. Horst Kirchner has proposed a shamanic interpretation of the famous cave painting from Lascaux in his study" Ein archiiologischer Beitrag zur Urgeschichte des Schamanismus," Anthropos 47 (1952): 244-86. This interpretation has been accepted by Karl Narr, "Biirenzeremoniell und Schamanismus in der alteren Steinzeit Europas," Saeculum 10 (1959): 233-72, esp. p. 271. See also Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 502 ff.; A. Marshak, The Roots of Civilization, pp. 277 ff.
J. Makkay has given the same interpretation to the "Great Magician" in the Trois Freres cave in "An Important Proof to the Prehistory of Shamanism," Alba Regia 2/3 (Szekesfehervar, 1963): 5-10. See also E. Burgstaller, "Schamanistische Motive unter den Felsbildern in den osterreichischen Alpenliindern," Forschungen und Fortschritte 41 (1967): 105-10, 144-58; H. Miyakawa and A.

Maringer, The Gods of Prehistoric Man, pp. 153 fr.; A. Leroi-Gourhan, Les religions de la prehistoire, pp. 87 fr. This art of figurines (" Kleinplastik," as Narr terms it) is believed to be the result of influences from the eastern Mediterranean; a comparatively naturalistic style is dominant in the Franco-Cantabrian region, while geometric schematization became the rule in the East and Northeast. But it is now accepted that the Late Paleolithic of Siberia was influenced by the cultures of Mongolia and Southeast Asia; see Jettmar, Les religions arctiques et finnoises, p. 292.
Leroi-Gourhan's interpretation has been criticized by Ucko and Rosenfeld, Palaeolithic Cave Art, pp. 195 fr., and by Henri Lhote, "La Plaquette dite de 'La Femme au Renne,'" in Simposio de arte rupestre, pp. 80-97 (cf. ibid., pp. 98-108, a critique by Maning). On the so-called X-ray style and its relations with shamanism, see Andreas Lommel, Shamanism: The Beginnings of Art (New York and Toronto, n.d.), pp. 129 fr.

According to the German ethnologist Kunz Dittmer, the cultivation of roots and bulbs would already have begun, in Southeast Asia, during the Upper Paleolithic. Women had the responsibility for planting and harvesting; they wove baskets and, later, made pottery. In consequence, the cultivated fields became the women's property. The husband came to live in his wife's house, and descent was matrilinear. The men, in addition to hunting and fishing, undertook the task of clearing land. This type of civilization, which Dittmer defines as a combination of hunting and planting (" Jiiger-Pflanzer") spread into tropical Africa, Melanesia, and the two Americas. Still in Southeast Asia, there later appeared the cultivation of tubers and horticulture; it is during this period that the domestication of the pig and of poultry occurred. This civilization is characterized by an organization of the matriarchal type, by male secret societies (to terrorize the women), age groups, the economic and religious importance of woman, lunar mythologies, orgiastic fertility cults, head-hunting, and the cult of skulls. The regeneration of life was accomplished by human sacrifices. The cult of ancestors was justified by their role in fertility. Further characteristic elements: shamanism and the development of art (music, cult drama, masks of the secret societies, plastic representations of ancestors). This type of civilization (or cultural cycle) had already spread, during the Mesolithic period, into Southeast Asia (it is still found today among certain primitive peoples of Outer India and Indochina), Equatorial Africa, and the Pacific, with the exception of Polynesia. Dittmer explains the cultivation of cereals as a substitute (Ersatz) for vegeculture, made neCessary by the spread of the practice into the steppe zones. The passage from vegeculture to the cultivation of cereals took place in India; it is there that the most ancient cereal-millet-was cultivated. From India the new technique spread into western Asia, where the wild species of several graminaceae were domesticated. Dittmer distinguishes two specific cultural circles in the cultivation of cereals: (a) cultivation of the "extensive" type, in the regions enjoying a sufficient quantity of rain, and (b) "intensive" cultivation, that is, employing terraces, irrigation, and gardening. Each of these cultural cycles has its own corresponding sociological, economic, and religious structures (see Kunz Dittmer, Allgemeine Volkerkunde [Braunschweig, 1954], pp. 163-90). H. Baumann, on the contrary, considers that the cultivation of tubers was invented by imitating and readapting the technique of cereal cultivation; see his Das doppelte Geschlecht (Berlin, 1955), pp. 289 if.

As for C;atal HUyUk, it represents the largest Neolithic city in the Near East. Though incompletely excavated (one quarter of the surface in 1965), C;atal HUyUk has revealed a surprising degree of civilization: a developed agricultural (several species of grains and vegetables), stock-rearing, commerce, and numerous richly decorated temples.

Another sanctuary deserves mention at this point: the "Eye Temple," excavated by Mallowan at Brak, in the valley of Habur (1,000 kilometers north of Uruk), and dated by him at about 3000 B.C. Among the finds were several thousand "idols" in black and white alabaster, characterized by one pair, or several pairs, of eyes. According to Mallowan, they represent ex-votos oifered to an all-seeing divinity, protectress of the city; see his Early Mesopotamia, pp. 48 if. and figs. 38-40. The temple was consecrated to the goddess Inanna. In his book The Eye Goddess (1957), O. G. S. Crawford studies the dissemination of this iconographic type as far as to England and Ireland, but a number of the examples that he cites are not convincing. The religious symbolism of the figurines and other objects of Mesopotamian prehistory has been studied by B. L.

As early as 1944 B. Landsberger had shown that the Sumerian cultural terminology (i.e., words related to agriculture, metallurgy, trades), as well as the names of rivers and cities, are of pre-Sumerian origin. Cf. Kramcr, The Sumerians, pp. 41 if.
Before settling in lower Mesopotamia, the Sumerians worshiped the same divinities in common; among the most important were An, En-lil, En-ki, Inanna. But later each city had its divine patron; for example, En-lil was the god of Nippur, En-ki reigned at Eridu, Nanna at Ur, etc. The myth of Dilmun has been translated by Kramer in ANET, pp. 34-41, and in From the Tablets of Sumer, pp. 169-75; by Maurice Lambert in "La naissance du monde a Sumer," Naissance du Monde: Sources orientales (Paris, 1959), vol. 1, pp. 103 if.; and recently by Castellino in Mitologia sumero-accadica, pp. 50 if.

The Mesopotamian texts are translated by Alexander Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis (Chicago, 1942), pp. 62-72. According to a tradition transmitted by Berossus (third century B.C.), it is Bel (= Marduk) who ordered the gods to cut oif his head and fashion man from earth mixed with his blood (Heidel, Babylonian Genesis, pp. 77-78). If this tradition is genuine, man's body would be made up of a divine and a "demonic" substance (for the earth derives from Tiamat). In the myth known as the "Creation of the Spade," En-lil separates Heaven from Earth in order that men can "arise from the soil"; trans. Castellino, Mitologia sumero-accadica, pp. 55 if.

of Atrahasis" explains En-IiI's anger by the uproar made by men, who had "become prosperous" ; cf. Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic, pp. 107 and 225 ff. According to recently published texts, the flood was regarded as a divine punishment: men had rebelled against their "destiny," which was to serve the gods by labor and worship; cf. G.

Caskel (1968), pp. 96 ff., and by Jean Bottero, in Annuaire de I'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, 1971-72, sec. IV, pp. 81-97. The most significant differences are these: the Sumerian version has no detailed description ofthe underworld (it knows the "Great Below" as antipodal to heaven, the" Great Above"; Bottero, p. 86); in the Akkadian version Ishtar threatens, if she is not admitted to the underworld immediately, to demolish its gates and free the dead, who "will devour the living" (Bottero, p. 86); in the Sumerian version the" water of life" is found in the underworld itself (in the "wineskin" that contained the drink of the infernal gods; Bottero, p. 89); in the Akkadian version, it appears to be Ereshkigal who orders her messenger to wash Tammuz, anoint him with perfume, and clothe him in a" splendid dress" ; so it is she who is responsible for Ishtar's indignation and, in the last analysis, for the ruin of Tammuz (Bottero, pp. 91 ff.).

Nougayrol, "La religion babylonienne," pp. 231-34. We quote a few lines from Nougayrol's conclusion (p. 234): "The Babylonian imagination, which had turned a little aside from the Sumerian 'stories of gods,' seems to delight in 'stories of devils.' In these very numerous and very long compositions by magicians, there may well be an element of literature intended to dazzle the profane.... But there is also undeniably present a substratum of anxiety, of which that concerning 'atomic war' can give us an idea.... More than any other people, it seems, the people of Mesopotamia, surrounded by 'barbarians' who constantly threatened it and periodically invaded its soil, had the feeling that civilization and the , good life' are fragile and constantly called into question."
21. The Enuma elish has been frequently translated. The most recent versions are those by R.

396 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
In a number of studies Jacobsen has brought out the "democratic" character ofthe Sumerian government and, by extension, ofthe Babylonian pantheon (for example, as the Enuma elish shows, Marduk is raised to the rank of supreme god by the assembly of all the divinities); see Jacobsen, "Early Political Development in Mesopotamia," Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie 52 (1957): 91-140, and his article in JNES 2, pp. 159 ff. See also "The Battle between Marduk and Tiamat," JAOS 88 (1968): 104-8. The sacred character of royalty in the ancient Near East has occasioned a long controversy. Some scholars have seen in the king, representative of the god, the center of a mythico-ritual system typical of all the religions of the ancient Near East. This methodological orientation, known as the "myth-and-ritual school" or "patternism," has inspired a large number of works, among which it will suffice to cite the two volumes published by S. H. Hooke, Myth and Ritual (1933) and The Labyrinth (1935), and the works of I. Engnell and G. Widengren. "Patternism" has been criticized, especially by H. Frankfort in The Problem of Similarity in Ancient Near Eastern Religions, Frazer Lecture (Oxford, 1951). This eminent scholar maintained that the differences between the relevant forms were more important than the similarities. For example, he drew attention to the fact that the pharaoh was considered to be a god or became a god, whereas in Mesopotamia the king was only the god's representative. In any case, it is obvious that the differences and similarities are equally important when we are dealing with historically related cultures. See also S. H. Hooke, "Myth and Ritual: Past and Present," in Hooke, ed., Myth, Ritual, and Kingship (Oxford, 1958), pp. 1-21; S. G. F.

At present, six episodes of the legend of Gilgamesh are known in Sumerian versions: (1) the expedition to the cedar forest and the victory over Huwawa (trans. Kramer, From the Tablets, pp. 204-7; Kramer, The Sumerians, pp. 192-97); (2) Gilgamesh and the Heavenly Bull; (3) the flood and the immortalization of Zisudra; (4) the death of Gilgamesh (A NET, pp. 50-52), an episode lacking in the Babylonian version; (5) Gilgamesh and Agga (translated in Tablets, pp. 29-30; The Sumerians, pp. 197-200), one of the shortest Sumerian epic texts (115 lines), no trace of which has been found in the Babylonian Epic (but some authors hold that this episode has a historical foundation and hence ought not to be included among the mythological texts); (6) Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the otherworld (translated in Tablets, pp. 224-25; The Sumerians, 197-205). This last episode makes up the contents of tablet XII of the Epic of Gilgamesh (see above, chap. 3, p. 92, n. 50). Gilgamesh cuts down a gigantic tree and gives the trunk to Inanna-Ishtar to make into a throne and a couch. From its roots and its crown he makes two magic objects for himself, the pukku and the mekku, whose interpretation is still disputed; probably they are musical instruments (drum and drumsticks ?). As the result of a ritual error these objects fall into the world below. Touched by his master's despair, Enkidu oifers to go and look for them. But, since he fails to follow the instructions that Gilgamesh has given him to avoid irritating the spirits, Enkidu cannot come up again. In his sorrow Gilgamesh prays to the gods, and Nergal, the sovereign of the underworld, allows Enkidu's spirit to return to earth for a few moments. Gilgamesh questions him concerning the fate of the dead. His companion hesitates: "If I told thee the law of the netherworld which I know, I should see thee

sit down and weep! " (col. IV, lines 1-5). But Gilgamesh insists, and Enkidu gives him a short and depressing description: "All that is deep in dust.... " See the following publications by S. N. Kramer: Gilgamesh and the Huluppu-Tree (Assyriological Study no. 8, Oriental Institute of Chicago); "Gilgamesh: Some New Sumerian Data," in P. Garelli, ed., Gilgamesh et sa legende (Paris, 1960), pp. 59-68; "The Epic of Gilgamesh and Its Sumerian Sources," JAOS 64 (1944): 7-22; and "Sumerian Epic Literature," in La Poesia epica e la sua formazione (Accad. Naz. dei Lincei, 1970), pp. 825-37. See also A. Schaffer, Sumerian Sources of Tablet XII of the Epic of Gilgamesh, Dissertation, Department of Oriental Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 1962. According to A. Falkenstein, the name of the hero was read in Sumerian as Bilgames; cf. Reallexicon der Assyriologie (Berlin and Leipzig, 1932--), vol. 3 (1968), pp. 357 ff. There is an immense bibliography on the Epic of Gilgamesh (in which P. Jensen saw the chief source of universal literature ; see his Das GilgameshEpos in der Weltliteratur, vol. I [Strasbourg, 1906]). The most important contributions are listed in the translations by Contenau, Heidel, Kramer, and A. Schott and W. v. Soden. See also the studies collected by P. Garelli, Gilgamesh et sa legende (pp. 7-30, bibliography) and the articles by A. Falkenstein et al. in Reallexikon der Assyriologie, vol. 3 (1968), pp. 357-75, by W. v. Soden in Zeitschrift der Assyr., vol. 53, pp. 209 ff., and by J. Nougayrol, "L'Epopee Babylonienne," in La poesia epica e la sua formazione, pp. 839-58. Recently Kurt Jaritz has interpreted a certain number of episodes (the drum, the dreams, the cedar forest, etc.) as illustrating shamanic ideas and practices; see his "Schamanistisches im Gilgames-Epos," Beitriige zu Geschichte, Kultur und Religion des alten Orients (Baden-Baden, 1971), pp. 75-87. A similar interpretation has been proposed by E. A. S. Butterworth, The Tree at the Navel of the Earth (Berlin, 1970), pp. 138 ff. The myth of Adapa represents another unsuccessful attempt at immortalization, but in this case the responsibility does not fall on the hero. Adapa was created by Ea as intelligent but mortal. Once, because the South Wind had overturned his boat, Adapa broke its wings. This was a violation of the cosmic order, and Anu summoned him to judgment. Before his departure, Ea gave him precise instructions as to his behavior in heaven, and especially warned him not to accept the "bread of death" and the" waters of death" that would be offered him. Adapa did not hide the fact that he had broken the Wind's wings in revenge. Impressed by his sincerity, Anu offered him the "bread of life" and the "waters of life." But Adapa refused them, thus losing the opportunity to become immortal.

Indirectly, this mythical episode seems to reflect a tension between Anu and Ea, the reasons for which we do not know.

It is probable that it spread from Palestine, for traces of a Neolithic culture (ca. 4500 B.C.) have been excavated at Merimdeh, near the Delta. The dead were buried in the houses, but without offerings of funeral objects. The Upper Egyptian culture called "Badarian" (from the name of the site, Badari), knows, in addition to agriculture and stock-raising, a black-andred pottery. The dead were buried in a bent posture; domestic animals were also buried, wrapped in textiles. In comparison with Tell Halaf and Warka, the Neolithic Egyptian cultures appear poor and marginal. With the appearance of the Amratian culture (Early Predynastic) we witness the first attempts toward exploiting the natural irrigation of the Nile Valley. Stone and copper are worked, but the pottery is coarser than that of the Badarian period (probably because stone vessels were beginning to be made; see Clark, World Prehistory, p. 104). Food offerings and clay figurines have been found in the burials. It was only during the Late Predynastic (Nakada II) that metallurgy was introduced, a thousand years after its rise in the Near East. A number of other cultural elements were borrowed from Asia, but only after a considerable lapse of time. Wheeled vehicles, long known in Mesopotamia, were introduced into Egypt only under the Empire (ca. 1570 B.C.). The greatness of Egyptian civilization begins with the uniting of the two lands, Upper and Lower Egypt. As for

the beginnings of urban civilization, which are of considerable interest for any comparative study, their archeological traces are buried under the mud of the Nile. On the Badarian and Amratian cultures, see MilllerKarpe, Handbuch der Vorgeschichte, vol. 2, pp. 28-55, 339-45, 353-61. The bibliography down to 1948 is listed by Jacques Vandier, La religion egyptienne, 2d ed. (Paris, 1949), pp. 3-10; see also (ibid., pp. 24-29) Vandier's critical exposition of the opinions of K. Sethe (Urgeschichte u. iilteste Religion der ,A"gypter [Leipzig, 1930]) and of H. Kees (Der Gotterglaube im alten Agypten [Leipzig, 1941; 2d ed., Berlin, 1956]) on the primitive religions of Egypt. Cf. R. Weill, "Notes sur l'histoire primitive des grandes religions egyptiennes," Bulletin de l'Institut Franfais d'Archeologie Orientale 47 (1948): 59-150.
Among general studies on the religions of Egypt we mention: Adolf Erman, Die Religion der Agypter (Berlin and Leipzig, 1934); Herman Junker, Pyramidenzeit: Das Werden der altiigyptische Religion (Einsiedeln, 1949); J. Garnot Sainte-Fare, Religions de I'Egypte (Paris, 1951); S. Donadoni, La religione dell 'Egitto antico (Milan, 1955); H. Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion (New York, 1948); Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods: A Study of Ancient Near Eastern Religion as the Integration of Society and Nature (Chicago, 1948); R. T. Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt (London, 1959). The book by S. Morenz, Egyptian Religion, trans. Ann Keep (Ithaca, N.Y., 1973), is at once an updating and an admirable synthesis undertaken from the viewpoint of the general history of religions. See also C. J. Bleeker, "The Religion of Ancient Egypt," Historia Religionum (Leiden, 1969), vol. 1, pp. 40-114; Bleeker, Hathor and Thoth: Two Key Figures of the Ancient Egyptian Religion (Leiden, 1973), pp. 10 if., 159 if.; P. Derchain, "La religion egyptienne," Histoire des religions, ed. H. C. Puech (1970), vol. 1, pp. 63-140. Indispensable for its rich documentation and bibliographical references is Hans Bonnet, Reallexicon der iigyptischen Religionsgeschichte (Berlin, 1952). Gunther Roeder has recently published a rich collection of texts, with admirable illustrations, in Die iigyptische Religion in Text und Bild: vol. 1, Die iigyptische Gotterwelt; vol. 2, Mythen und Legenden um iigyptischen Gottheiten und Pharaonen; vol. 3, Kulte, Orakel und Naturverehrung im alten Aegypten; vol. 4, Der Ausklang der iigyptische Religion, mit Reformation, Zauberei und Jenseitsglaube (Zurich, 1959-61).
The historical documents are accessible in the translation by J. H. Breasted, Ancient Records ofEgypt, 5 vols. (Chicago, 1906-7). The Pyramid Texts have been translated into German by Sethe, into French by Speleers, and into English by Mercer; we follow the translation by R. O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts (Oxford, 1969), but we have also used the fragments translated by Breasted, Weill, Clark, Sauneron, and Yoyotte.



402 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
On the religious vocabulary, see C. J. Bleeker, "Einige Bemerkungen zur religiosen Terminologie der alten Aegypten," in Travels in the World ofthe Old Testament: Studies Presented to Professor M. A. Beek (Assen, 1974), pp. 12-26.
26. A systematic exposition of the Egyptian cosmogonies, supplemented by annotated translations of the texts, has been furnished by S. Sauneron and J. Yoyotte, "La naissance du monde selon l'Egypte ancienne," in La naissance du monde (Paris, 1959), pp. 19-91. See also the translations by J. Wilson, ANET, pp. 3-10. The various cosmogonic doctrines are discussed by Vandier, La religion egyptienne, pp. 57 ff. Cf. the analysis by Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol, pp. 35 ff., and especially Morenz, Egyptian Religion, pp. 159 ff. On the Hermopolis cosmogony, see S. Morenz and J. Schubert, Der Gott auf der Blume: Eine iigyptische Kosmogonie und ihre weltweite Bildwirkung (Ascona, 1954). On the creative value of the word, see J. Zandee, "Das SchOpferwort im alten Aegypten," Verbum, Studia Theologica RhenoTraiectina 6 (1964): 33 ff. See also R. B. Finnestad, "Ptah, Creator of the Gods," Numen 23 (1976): 81-113. The importance of Thebes from the end of the third millennium brought its god Amon (who was opportunely associated with Re) to the forefront. But the cosmogony accomplished by Amon is borrowed from the systems of Heliopolis, Hermopolis, and Memphis; see the texts translated, with annotations by Wilson, ANET, pp. 8-10; Sauneron and Yoyotte, pp. 67 ff. On the symbolism of the primordial hill and sacred space, see Hellmut Brunner, "Zum Raumbegriff der Aegypter," Studium Generale 10 (1957): 610ff.; A. Saleh, "The So-Called 'Primeval Hill' and Other Related Elevations in Ancient Egyptian Mythology," Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archiiologischen Instituts (Abt. Cairo) 25 (1969): 110-20; I. E. S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt (Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, 1961); J. Leclant, "Espace et temps, ordre et chaos dans l'Egypte pharaonique," Revue de Synthese 90 (1969); Othmar Keel, Die Welt der altorientalischen Bildsymbolik und das Alte Testament (Zurich and Neukirchen, 1972), pp. 100 ff. (comparative study, admirably illustrated). There were several myths concerning the origin of man; according to one version, Ptah had shaped his body from clay, on the potter's wheel (see Bonnet, Reallexicon, p. 617); in Upper Egypt the demiurge was Khnum (ibid., p. 137). No myth on the origin of death is known; a brief allusion (Pyr. 1466) refers to the mythical time "before death existed." The myth concerning the destruction of men is comp,aratively old; see the bibliography in Vandier, Rei. egypt., p. 53. See The Book of the Divine Cow, translated by Alexandre Piankoff in The Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amon

(New York, 1955), p. 27. When Re realized that Hathor was ready to destroy the human race, he caused beer the color of blood to be poured during the night; when Hathor, the next morning, prepared to continue the slaughter, she drank so much of it that she succumbed to intoxication. Men had decided to revolt because Re had grown too old. And in fact, after the episode just related, Re decided to renounce the sovereignty of the world. Admitting in the presence of the gods that his body was as weak as it has been during the primordial period, he asked his daughter, Nut, to carry him up to heaven (Book of the Divine Cow, trans. Piankoff, in Shrines, p. 29). His successor was Shu or Geb. Re's "old age" and impotence, and above all his retirement to the distant sky, are mythical elements that are abundantly documented: the transformation of a celestial god, creator and cosmocrator, into a deus otiosus. The fact that, in the Egyptian version, it is a solar god who becomes a deus otiosus shows reinterpretation by theologians.
27. On the divinity of the Egyptian kings, see: A. Moret, Du caractere religieux de fa royaute pharaonique (Paris, 1902) (largely outdated); H. Jacobsohn, Die dogmatische Stellung des Konigs in der Theologie der alten ;t"gypter (Gluckstadt, 1939); H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, pp. 15-215; G. Posener, De fa divinite du pharaon (Paris, 1960); H. Goedicke, Die Stellung des Konigs im Alten Reich (Wiesbaden, 1960); H. Brunner, Die Geburt des Gottkonigs (Wiesbaden, 1964).
On "Menes" as creator of a united Egypt, see Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, pp. 17 ff. Royalty already appears at the end of the predynastic period. Frankfort emphasizes the ideological origin ofthe "dual monarchy" (i.e., the shared sovereignty of Upper and Lower Egypt). This political formula expressed the tendency of the Egyptian mind "to understand the world in dualistic terms as a series of pairs of contrasts balanced in unchanging equilibrium" (Kingship, p. 19). "The dualistic forms of Egyptian kingship did not result from historical incidents. They embody the peculiarly Egyptian thought that a totality comprises opposites" (ibid.). Frankfort cites some African parallels that may explain the origin of this dualistic ideology (p. 16). We shall meet with other examples of dyads and polarities; see, for the moment, Eliade, The Quest, pp. 127 ff. (" Prolegomenon to Religious Dualism "). On the meanings of maCat, see Bonnet, Reallexicon, pp. 430-34; Frankfort, Ancient Egypt. Rei., pp. 53 ff., 62 ff.; Posener, Litterature et politique dans I'Egypte de la XII" Dynastie (Paris, 1956); Morenz, Egyptian Religion, pp. 113-30 (with bibliography).

Egypt," in The Idea of History in the Ancient Near East, ed. Robert C. Dentan (New Haven, 1955), pp. 1-34. On cults and festivals, see Vandier, La rei. egypt., pp. 165-203, and Morenz, Egyptian Religion, pp. 81-109 (excellent comparative discussion, with recent bibliography). The work by Moret, Le rituel du culte divin journalier en Egypte (Paris, 1902) can still be used. See also H. Kees, Das Priestertum im iigyptischen Staat vom NR bis zur Spiitzeit (Leiden, 1953); J. Garnot Sainte-Fare, L'hommage aux dieux dans I'ancien Empire egyptien d'apres les textes des Pyramides (Paris, 1954); S. Sauneron, Les pretres de l'ancienne Egypte (Paris, 1967) (Eng. trans. by Ann Morrisett, The Priests of Ancient Egypt [New York, 1960)).
On the sed festival, the essential can be found in Vandier, pp. 200-202; there is an excellent analysis, with references to the literary and iconographic sources, in Frankfort, Kingship, pp. 79 if. On the festival of Min, see H. Gauthier, Les fetes du dieu Min (Cairo, 1931); Vandier, pp. 202-3; Frankfort, Kingship, 186 if.
28. The pharaoh's ascent to heaven as recounted in the Pyramid Texts has been described by J. H. Breasted, Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt (New York, 1912), pp. 70--141, and by R. Weill, Le champ des roseaux et Ie champ des offrandes dans la religion funeraire et la religion generale (Paris, 1936).
It is not certain that the epithet maa-kheru ("just of voice "), "which is placed after the name of every deceased person from the time of the Middle Kingdom," should be translated by "blessed, beatified." Rather, it expresses "the idea that the deceased has had the benefit of the Osirian rites" (J. Yoyotte, "Le jugement des morts dans l'Egypte ancienne," p. 37) (see the bibliographical references for § 33).
29. There is an extensive literature on Osiris. We mention only the essential studies: Bonnet, Reallexicon, pp. 568-76; Vandier, La reI. egypt., pp. 58 if., 81 if., 134 if.; Frankfort, Kingship, pp. 181 if.; Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol, pp. 97 if.; E. Otto and M. Hirner, Osiris und Amun (Munich, 1960). See also A. Scharff, Die Ausbreitung des Osiriskulte in der Fruhzeit und wiihrend des Alten Reiches (Munich, 1948); J. G. Griffiths, The Origins of Osiris, Miinchener Aegyptologische Studien no. 9 (Berlin, 1966). The work by E. A. Wallis Budge, Osiris: The Egyptian Religion ofResurrection, 2 vols. (London, 1911; rev. ed., New York, 1961) is still useful for its documents, iconography, and African parallels. During the fashion launched by Frazer, Osiris was seen as exclusively an agrarian god; this interpretation, defended in France by A. Moret, has been criticized and

rejected by, among others, Emile Chassinat, in his posthumous work Le Mystere d'Osiris au mois de Khoiac (Cairo, 1966), vol. 1, pp. 30 ff. What seems certain is the complex character of Osiris; he is at once a cosmic and a funerary god, representative of both universal fertility and kingship, master ofthe judgment ofthe dead, and, later, a divinity ofthe "Mysteries." The myths of Osiris in the Middle Kingdom and the Empire are summarized by Vandier, La rei. egypt., pp. 48-51. The Coffin Texts have been edited by A. de Buck, The Egyptian Coffin Texts, 6 vols. (Chicago, 1935-50). They are in the course of being translated by R. O. Faulkner; volume 1, The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts, has been published (Warminster, 1974). On the cult of Osiris, see the two volumes by Chassinat, Le Mystere d'Osiris au mois de Khoiac; Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol, pp. 132 ff. (the erection of the djed pillar, symbol of the god's spine), pp. 157 ff.; Frankfort, Kingship, pp. 181 ff. On Horus and Seth, see Bonnet, Reallexicon, pp. 307-18, 702-15, with the essential bibliography. Also see H. de Velde, Seth, God of Confusion (1967).
30. On the First Intermediate Period, see H. Stock, Die erste Zwischenzeit Aegyptens (Rome, 1949); Wilson, The Culture ofAncient Egypt, p. 104-24; Drioton and Vandier, L'Egypte, pp. 213 ff. The literary compositions discussed in the text have been translated by Adolf Erman, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, trans. A. M. Blackman (London, 1927; republished as a Harper Torchbook [New York, 1966] under the title The Ancient Egyptians, with an important introduction by W. K. Simpson); pp. 75 ff.: "The Instruction for King Meri-ka-Re"; pp. 92 ff: "Ipuwer"; pp. 132 ff.: "Song of the Harper"; pp. 86 ff.: "Dispute of a Man Weary of Life." We have chiefly followed the translations by Wilson, ANET, pp. 405 ff., 441 ff., 467. R. O. Faulkner has provided a new translation of "The Dispute of a Man Weary of Life" in the Journal ofEgyptian Archeology 42 (1956): 21-40 ("The Man Who Was Tired of Life"). R. J. Williams has examined the recent literature on the same text, ibid., 48 (1962): 49-56. Several studies have been published on the Admonitions of Ipu-wer; see the bibliography in W. K. Simpson's introduction to the Harper Torchbooks edition of Erman's book, pp. xxix-xxx; also see ibid., p. xxviii, for an analysis of recent studies on the Instruction for King Meri-ka-Re (this last text is long and not always intelligible). On the literature of the Intermediate Period of the Twelfth Dynasty, see G. Posener, Litterature et politique dans I'Egypte de la XIIe dynastie (Paris, 1956).



406 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
31. On the Middle Kingdom, see H. E. Winlock, The Rise and Fall of the Middle Kingdom in Thebes (New York, 1947); Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt, pp. 124-53; Drioton and Vandier, L'Egypte, pp. 234 if. The pharaohs undertook works of considerable magnitude (they added 27,000 acres of arable land near Faiyum, etc.). Though not following a policy of conquest, Egypt was respected and feared in the Mediterranean, the Aegean, and the Near East. On the Hyksos, see Robert M. Engberg, The Hyksos Reconsidered (Chicago, 1939); Winlock, the last two chapters; Wilson, pp. 154-65; T. Save-S6derbergh, "The Hyksos Rule in Egypt," Journal of Egyptian Archeology 37 (1951): 53-72; Theodore Burton-Brown, Early Mediterranean Migrations (Manchester, 1959), pp. 63 if. As for the xenophobia of the Egyptians, it must be borne in mind that for a long time they did not recognize the" humanity" of foreigners; it is for this reason that they were sacrificed (Wilson, pp. 139 if.). On this problem see also F. Jesi, "Rapport sur les recherches relatives Ii quelques figurations du sacrifice humain dans l'Egypte pharaonique," JNES 17 (1958): 194-203. As early as the First Intermediate Period the "Asiatics" were accused of having fomented anarchy, although their number was insignificant at the time (Wilson, pp. 110 if.). It was not until after the Hyksos conquest that" Asiatics" settled in great numbers in the Delta region. On the role of the high priest of Amon, see G. Lefebvre, Histoire des Grands Pretres d'Amon de Karnak jusqu'ilia XXle Dynastie (Paris, 1929); Vandier, La relig. egypt., pp. 170 if.; Wilson, Culture, pp. 169 if. The great hymn to Amon-Re has been translated several times: see Wilson, ANET, pp. 365-67; Erman, The Ancient Egyptians, pp. 283-87. The hymn is inspired by the Memphite theology (Erman, Die Religion der Agypter, p. 119), which illustrates the tendency of Egyptian religiosity to return to and reinterpret traditional doctrines. Equally important is what has been called a "Universalist Hymn to the Sun," published and translated by A. Varille, in Bulletin de l'Institut franrais d'archeologie orientale no. 41 (Cairo, 1942), pp. 25-30; see also the translation by Wilson, ANET, pp.367-69.
32. On the "Amarna revolution," see J. D. S. Pendlebury, Tell-elAmarna (London, 1935); Drioton and Vandier, L'Egypte, pp. 86 if., 334 if.; Wilson, The Culture ofAncient Egypt, pp. 212 if. ; Rudolph Anthes, Die M aat des Echnaton von Amarna, JAOS, suppl. no. 14 (1952); Cyril Aldred, New Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt during the Eighteenth Dynasty (London, 1951), esp. pp. 22 if. The great hymn to Aton has been translated in Erman, The Ancient

Egyptians, pp. 288-91; Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1953), pp. 281-86; and Wilson, ANET, pp. 369-71. On the continuity Amon(-Re)-Aton, see Alexandre Piankoff, The Shrines ofTut-Ankh-Amon (New York, 1955), pp. 4 ff.
33. What Edouard Naville called the "Litany of the Sun" constitutes one of the most important texts of the Empire. We follow the translation by Piankoff, The Litany of Re (New York, 1964), pp. 22-43. See also the texts translated by the same author in his work The Tomb of Ramesses VI (New York, 1954). There are several translations of the Book of the Dead; we follow the most recent one, by T. C. Allen, The Book of the Dead, or Going Forth by Day (Chicago, 1974). On the other funerary books (The Book of What Is in the Beyond; The Book of Gates; The Book of Night), see Vandier, La relig. egypt., pp. 107 ff., 128-29. For the Book ofthe Two Roads we have used the translation by Piankoff, The Wandering of the Soul (Princeton, 1974), pp. 12-37. See also S. Morenz, Altiigyptischer Jenseitsfiihrer: Papyrus Berlin 3127 (Frankfurt a. M., 1966). The subterranean world of the dead, duat, is already documented in the Pyramid Texts; see the examples cited by Breasted, Development ofReligion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, p. 144, n. 2. On the representations of the Hells, see Erik Hornung, Altiigyptische Hollenvorstellungen (Berlin, 1968). For a description and translation of the texts, see the work by E. A. Wallis Budge, The Egyptian Heaven and Hell, 3 vols. (reprinted in one volume, London, 1925). The "negative" elements of death, considered as man's supreme enemy, are minutely analyzed by J. Zandee, Death as an Enemy according to Ancient Egyptian Conceptions (Leiden, 1960), pp. 5-31 (general presentation) and pp. 45-111 (the vocabulary expressing the various aspects of death: total destruction, decomposition, prison, etc.). The book by H. Kees, Totenglauben und Jenseitsvorstellungen der alten Aegypter (1926; 2d ed., Berlin, 1956), remains the best comprehensive study, despite certain too-personal interpretations. For the essential data on the cult of the dead (mummification, funerals, tombs, the mastaba, the pyramid, the hypogeum) see Vandier, La relig. egypt., pp. 111-30 (with an extensive bibliography). For the Egyptians, as for other peoples of antiquity (India, China, Greece, etc.), death not only effected the separation of the soul from the body; it also revealed the distinction among the three spiritual principles: the akh, the ba, and the ka. The first "essentially designates divine force, supernatural force" (Vandier, p. 131). The meaning of the word"shining, glorious"-indicates the celestial nature of the dead. (In fact,



408 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
when the dead are called akhu, they are regarded as supernatural beings, inhabitants of heaven; cf. Frankfort, Kingship, p. 64.) The ba, represented, like the akh, in the form of a bird, constitutes the "soul" properly speaking. "The Ba required the corpse, or at least a statue, in order to retain its identity. It was thought to return to the body in the grave after roaming through the fields and groves" (Frankfort, Kingship, p. 64; cf. Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion, pp. 96 if.). The ba is the deceased himself under a certain aspect. The ka, on the other hand, is not individualized and, except in the case of the pharaoh, is never depicted; the term can be translated as "vital force." The ka belongs to the individual during his lifetime but also follows him into the beyond (Frankfort, Kingship, p. 63). Only the king's ka figures on the monuments. "Born with the king as his twin, it accompanies him through life as a protective genius; it acts as his twin and as his protector in death" (ibid., p. 69). It is important to note that the Old Kingdom texts speak only of the ba of the pharaohs. "In other words, in the early period Egyptians apparently did not possess a ba" (Morenz, Egyptian Religion, p. 206). It is only from the First Intermediate Period that possessing a ba becomes general. Obviously, this is merely a literary situation; we do not know what the historical reality was. But it is significant that, in this case too, the "example" of the pharaoh constitutes the model increasingly imitated by the less privileged. See also L. Greven, Der Ka in Theologie und Konigskult der Jlgypter des Alten Reiches (Gllickstadt, 1952), and Louis Zabkar, A Study of the Ba Concept in Ancient Egyptian Texts (Chicago, 1968). On the Judgment, see E. Drioton, Lejugement des ames dans l'ancienne Egypte (Cairo, 1949); Vandier, La relig. egypt., pp. 134 if.; J. Spiegel, Die Idee vom Totengericht in der aegyptischen Religion (Gllickstadt, 1935); J. Yoyotte, "Le jugement des morts dans l'Egypte ancienne," in Le jugement des morts, Sources Orientales no. 4 (Paris, 1961), pp. 16-80 (translations of texts, commentaries, and bibliography). See also M. Guilmot, "L'espoir en l'immortalite dans l'Egypte ancienne du Moyen

On the declaration of innocence, see E. Drioton, "Contribution a l'etude du chapitre CXXV du Livre des Morts: Les confessions negatives,"
Recueil d'etudes egyptiennes dediees a la memoire de J. F. Champollion (Paris, 1922), pp. 545-64. Certain ideas and beliefs expressed in chapter 125 are very ancient: they" go back at least to the pyramid period. Of the negative and positive 'code of ethics' included in chapter 125, we have traces from as early as the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties" (Yoyotte, "Le jugement," p. 63). R. Pettazzoni has pointed out some ethnographic parallels to the negative confession; see his La confessione dei peccati (Bologna, 1935), vol. 2, pp. 21, 56-57.



Critical Bibliographies 409
The funerary work The Book of the Divine Cow emphasizes the magical value of its contents. He who shall know this text, it is written, "will not have to bend in the tribunal ... and all the robberies he may have committed on earth will not be counted" (trans. Yoyotte, p. 66; see the complete translation of The Book of the Divine Cow in Piankoff, Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amon, pp. 27-34). The exaltation of "knowledge" above morality is a leitmotiv of Indian thought from the Brahma~as and the Upanishads to Tantrism.
34. There is an extensive bibliography on the megalithic cultures. We have analyzed the most important contributions in a study soon to be published, "Megaliths and History of Religions." An excellent introduction has been provided by Glyn Daniel, The Megalith Builders of Western Europe (London, 1958); the second edition (Pelican Books, 1962) contains an addendum (pp. 143-46) which presents the new chronology established on the basis of carbon 14 analyses; indeed, the new chronology largely vitiates the author's thesis; see, further on, § 36. See also Fernand Niel, La civilisation des megalithes (Paris, 1970) and the bibliographies given by Glyn Daniel and J. D. Evans in the Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 2: The Western Mediterranean (1967), chap. 37, pp.63-72. The megaliths of Spain and Portugal have been exhaustively studied by Georg and Vera Leisner, Die Megalithgriiber der Iberischen Halbinsel: Der Suden (Berlin, 1943), and Der Westen, 3 vols. (Berlin, 1956, 1959, 1960). See also L. Pericot, ed., Corpus de sepulcros megalfticos, fascs. 1 and 2 (Barcelona, 1961); fasc. 3 (Gerona, 1964); L.

On the menhirs, Horst Kircher has published a very learned work, "Die Menhire in Mitteleuropa und der Menhirgedanke," Abhandlungen der Akademie in Mainz, Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftliche Klasse (1935), pp. 609-816.
35. From the vast literature on Stonehenge, we will mention a few recent studies: R. J. C. Atkinson, Stonehenge (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1960); A. Thorn, Megalithic Sites in Britain (Oxford, 1967); G. S. Hawkins, Stonehenge Decoded (London, 1966) (but see the critique by R. I. C. Atkinson, Nature 210 [1966]: 1320 ff.); Colin Renfrew, Before Civilization (London and New York, 1973), pp. 120 ff., 214 ff. It is worth mentioning that an enormous number of megalithic tombs (three thousand!) have been identified in southern France-more than six hundred in the Departement de rAveyron alone. This is more than twice as many as have been found in England and Wales. See Daniel and Evans, The Western Mediterrahean, p. 38. The dolmens in the Departement de I'Herault have been exhaustively studied by J. Arnal, Prehistoire 15 (1963). It is also in southern France that the only menhir statues so far known are found. On the prehistory ofMalta, see J. D. Evans, Malta (London, 1959); Evans, Prehistoric Antiquities ofthe Maltese Islands (London, 1971); Gunther Zuntz, Persephone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia (Oxford, 1971), pp. 3-58; Colin Renfrew, Before Civilization, pp. 147 ff. Zuntz (pp. 25 ff.) has demonstrated th€importance of the sym1>olism of the spiral in the decoration of the Maltese temples and has identified Danubian influences (the Cirna figurines).
36. Gordon Childe has summarized his views on the diffusion of the "megalithic religion" in his latest book, The Prehistory of European Society (Pelican Books, 1958), pp. 124-34: "Missionaries of the Megalithic Religion." According to Glyn Daniel, the beginning of construction of the megalithic type is directly connected with the arrival of the Minoans or the Aegeans in the central and western Mediterranean (The Megalith Builders of Western Europe, p. 135). The phenomenon is one of a commercial and colonial thrust, but the colonization was the work of a people possessing a strong religious belief and quite complicated funerary practices. Daniel

asks why the megalithic monuments contain so few objects made of metal, despite the fact that their builders exploited mines and were chiefly engaged in trade in metals. He holds that the immigrants purposely refrained from burying metal tools and buried stone replicas instead (p.137). The subtitle of Colin Renfrew's book Before Civilization is significant: The Radiocarbon Revolution and Prehistoric Europe. See also, by the same author, "Wessex without Mycenae," Annual of the British School of Archaeology at Athens 63 (1968): 277-85; "Malta and the Calibrated Radiocarbon Chronology," Antiquity 46 (1972): 141-45; and "New Configurations in Old World Chronology," World Archaeology 2 (1970): 199-211.
37. Several authors, reacting against the inhibition provoked by the extravagances of G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry, have examined the ensemble of the megalithic cultures of protohistory; see, for example, A. Serner, On" Dyss" Burial and Beliefs about the Dead during the Stone Age, with Special Regard to South Scandinavia (Lund, 1938); H. G. Bandi, "La repartition des tombes megalithiques," Archives Suisses d'Anthropologie Generale 12 (1946): 39-51; V. Gordon Childe, "Megaliths," Ancient India, no. 4 (1947/48), pp. 4-13. Aside from R. Heine-Geldern, only one scholar has made a joint study of the two groups of megalithic cultures, i.e., those of prehistory and those at the ethnographic stage, though he confined his study to the menhirs; we refer to Joseph Roder, Pfahl und Menhir: Eine vergleichend vorgeschichtliche volks- und volkerkundliche Studie (= Studien zur westeuropiiischen Altertumskunde, vol. 1 [Neuwied am Rhein, 1949]). As for the contributions by R. Heine-Geldern, the most important are: "Die Megalithen Siidostasiens und ihre Bedeutung fUr die Kliirung der Megalithenfrage in Europa und Polynesien," Anthropos 13 (1928): 276-315; "Prehistoric Research in the Netherlands Indies," in Science and Scientists in the Netherlands Indies, ed. P. Honig and F. Verdoorn (Cambridge, Mass., 1945), pp. 129-67; "Zwei aIte Weltanschauungen und ihre kulturgeschichtliche Bedeutung," Anzeiger der phil.-hist. Klasse der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 94 (1957): 251-62; "Das Megalithproblem," in Beitriige Oesterreichs zur Erforschung der Vergangenheit und Kulturgeschichte der Menschheit-Symposion 1958 (1959), pp. 162-82. The bibliography of Heine-Geldern is listed and analyzed by H. H. E. Loofs, Elements of the Megalithic Complex in Southeast Asia: An Annotated Bibliography (Canberra, 1967), pp. 3-4, 14-15,41-42,48,94. Heine-Geldern's hypothesis and the objections raised by his critics are discussed in our study" Megaliths and History of Religions."

In his important book The Pivot of the Four Quarters: A Preliminary Inquiry into the Origins and Character ofthe Ancient Chinese City (Chicago, 1971), Paul Wheatley has also studied the Harappan ceremonial centers (pp. 230 if.). On the symbolism of the" center of the world," see Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 12 if., and "Centre du Monde, Temple, Maison," in Le symbolisme cosmique des monuments religieux (Rome, 1957), pp. 57-82.

significant, for these archeologists have directed excavations in India; in other words, their scientific competence is happily supplemented by firsthand knowledge of the country. "Continuity" has also been confirmed by the researches of Mario Cappieri, "1st die Induskultur und ihre Bevolkerung wirklich verschwunden 7" Anthropos 60 (l965): 719-62. W. Koppers has noted some exact analogies between certain fertility rites practiced in Central India and the Harappan iconography; see his" Zentralindische Fruchtbarkeitsriten und ihre Beziehungen zur Induskultur," Geographica Helvetica 1 (l946): 165-77. For his part, Josef Haekel has studied the ceremonies connected with Gardens of Adonis in certain villages of Gujarat. The Austrian scholar explains the presence of this specifically Mediterranean ritual by the fact that the authors of the Indus civilization were pre-Aryan cultivators arrived from Iran; hence they shared in the protohistorical civilization of the Near East and the Mediterranean; see his '" Adonisgartchen' im Zeremonialwesen der Rathwa in Gujarat (Zentralindien): Vergleich und Problematik," Ethnologische Zeitschrift Zurich I (l972): 167-75. Continuity is disputed by (among others) H. P. Sullivan, "A Reexamination of the Religion of the Indus Civilization," HR 4 (l964): 11525, and J. Gonda, Change and Continuity in Indian Religion (The Hague, 1965), pp. 19-37. R. L. Raikes has emphasized the decisive role of seismic movements and floods in the ruin of Mohenjo-daro; see his "The Mohenjo-daro Floods," Antiquity 39 (1965): 196-203; "The End ofthe Ancient Cities of the Indus Civilization," American Anthropologist 65 (1963): 655-59, and 66 (l964): 284--99; and, especially, Water, Weather and Archaeology (London, 1967). The incontestable lowering of the economic and cultural level in the final phases of Mohenjo-daro was certainly aggravated by the demoralization consequent upon repeated floods. But the death blow seems to have been struck by the invaders from the East, probably Aryan-speaking immigrants. Excavations have revealed traces of a final massacre, after which Mohenjo-daro ceased to exist; see Wheeler, Indus Civilization, pp. 129 if., and the bibliography given below, § 64.

It is important to note the complete absence of buildings resembling what will later be the classic temple. The single example of a public sanctuary is the one at Gournia, but it too, according to Nilsson, derives from the domestic cult. Even rituals of the agrarian type were performed in palace courtyards.

"In general, we witness a more or less conservative prolongation ... of the Minoan pantheon, and of the world of supernatural beings anterior to the Mycenaean period" (Picard, p. 252). The eminent archeologist remarks that the arrangement of "mystery" temples was derived from the installations documented in pre-Hellenic Crete: "there are barriers, portions to which access is reserved, abata, adyta; the cists (still sunk into the ground) of the •temple-repositories' of Cnossus were the prelude to the Eleusinian kistai: sacred coffers that have become portable but on which the two goddesses sometimes appear together. At Malia a large circular kernos, with cupules for oiferings, is already set into the flagging of a room in the palace, in direct contact with the earth. The analogy of such arrangements with those of the princely metropolis of Malia itself has been particularly noted; there we have the essential instruments of a cult that is at once agrarian and funerary, the sacred furniture of ceremonies that appear to be mystical, in honor of a Mother Earth who is the guardian at once of the living and the dead" (p. 142). Cf. §§ 97-99. P. Faure considers Britomartis to be the patron goddess of Skoteino; thus it is possible to "account for the facts of the cult that is documented there, including the modern facts, such as the celebration of the Parasceve" (" Speleologie cretoise et humanisme," p. 40). On Britomartis, see also Willetts, Cretan Cult and Festivals, pp. 179 if.
On Egyptian influences (psychistasis, partial mummification of bodies, adoption of gold masks, etc.), see Picard, pp. 228 if., 279 if. The gold masks were intended to transform the dead person into a supernatural being with incorruptible features, like the statues of the immortals (Picard, p.262).

On the New Year festival (purulli), see Volkert Haas, Der Kult von Nerik: Ein Beitrag zur hethitischen Religionsgeschichte (Rome, 1970), pp. 43 if. A purification ritual for an army after a defeat is remarkable for its archaism; it involves the sacrifice of a man, a goat, a puppy, and a little pig. These victims are cut in two, and the army passes between the separated halves. See O. Masson, "A propos d'un rituel hittite pour la lustration d'une armee," RHR 137 (1950): 5-25; Gurney, The Hittites, p. 151. The analogy with the sacrifice ordered by Yahweh when he concluded his covenant with Abraham (Gen. 15:9-18) has been noted. Ritual passing between the two halves of victims is known to numerous peoples; see Frazer, Folk-lore in the Old Testament (London, 1919), vol. 1, pp. 393-425, and see T. Gaster, Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament (New York, 1969), pp. 363 if., for bibliographical supplements. See also J.

44. The various versions of the myth are analyzed by H. Otten, Die Ueberlieferungen des Telepinu-Mythus, Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatischaegyptischen Gesellschaft 46 (Leipzig, 1943). There is a comparative commentary in T. Gaster, Thespis, 2d rev. ed. (New York, 1961), pp. 295 if. See also the analysis by Giiterbock, "Gedanken iiber das Werden des Gottes Telepinu," Festschrift Johannes Friedrich (Heidelberg, 1959), pp. 207-11, and Giiterbock, "Hittite Mythology," pp. 144-48 in Samuel N. Kramer, ed., Mythologies ofthe Ancient World (Garden City, N.Y., 1961). According to the version in which the protagonist is the storm god, the great solar god invites the "thousand divinities" to the banquet; but, though they eat and drink, they can satisfy neither their hunger nor their thirst. After the failure of the first messengers, the father of the storm god goes to find his own father and asks him, "Who sinned so that the seed perished and everything dried up?" The great father answers him: "No one sinned, but you alone sinned!" (Giiterbock, "Hittite Mythology," pp. 145-46). Gaster has brought out several common elements in the mythico-ritual scenarios of Telepinus and the gods of fertility; see his Thespis, pp. 304 if.

On the myth of men born from the earth, see the bibliography in Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 237. This theme is abundantly documented, especially in the Caucasus; see A. von L5wis of Menar, "Nordkaukasische Steingeburtsagen," ARW 13 (1901): 509-24. On the myths narrating the birth of divine beings from a petra genetrix (= Great Goddess = matrix mundi), see R.

The fragments of Philo of Byblos' Phoenician History which deal with religion have been translated, with commentaries, by Carl Clemen, Die phOnikische Religion nach Philo von Byblos (Leipzig, 1939). A cuneiform text published and translated by W. G. Lambert describes the bloodstained succession of five generations of gods; the sons kill their fathers and mothers, marry their mothers and sisters, and successively usurp the sovereignty. Some similarities with Hesiod's Theogony have been noted; cf. W. G. Lambert and P. Walcot, "A New Babylonian Theogony and

Hesiod," Kadmos 4 (1965): 64-72; see also C. Scott Littleton, "The 'Kingship in Heaven' Theme," in Puhvel, Myth and Law, pp. 112-14. Stig Wikander has brought out an Iranian parallel to the Hittite and Greek myths of the divine generations. The source is recent (it is the Shahnameh, the epic by Firdausi written about A.D. 976), but the heroesJamshid, Zohak, and Feridun-in some sense represent historicized versions of the mythological personages Yima, Mi, Dahiika, Thraetaona. Hence the myth of divine sovereignty can be considered an integral part of the Indo-European tradition (Wikander, "Histoire des Ouranides," Cahiers du Sud 36 [1952]: 8-17). But this myth is not documented among other Indo-European peoples. Scott Littleton tends to see in the Babylonian traditions (Enuma-elish and the fragment translated by Lambert) the ultimate source of all the myths of divine generations (Littleton, "The 'Kingship in Heaven' Theme," pp. 109 fT.).

The excavations at Tell Hariri, the ancient Mari, have brought to light thousands of tablets written in the" Old Babylonian" dialect of Akkadian. They supply the names of a certain number of gods, principally "Anat, Dagan, Addu. But because mythological texts are lacking we do not know the fundamental religious beliefs and conceptions. Amurru, the eponymous god of the Amorites, "is a man who does not know how to bend his knees (to cultivate the ground), who eats raw meat, who owns no house during his lifetime and is not buried after his death" (text cited by de Vaux, p. 64). Similar sterotypes will be used, throughout the three following millennia, in regard to the "barbarians" (Germans, Avars, Huns, Mongols, Tatars) who endanger the great urban civilizations, from the Roman Empire to China. It must be understood that these Amorites have nothing to do with the Amorites mentioned in the Bible. "The Bible applied to a part of the preIsraelite population of Palestine the name of Amurru" (de Vaux, p. 68). On the Canaanite religion and civilization, see J. Gray, The Canaanites

that the Old Akkadian name gives of II is a portrait of a high but gracious god, who is interested in man's welfare, and who is particularly active in the giving of children.

Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, pp. 112 fr. (Baal and Anath), pp. 147 fr. (theophanies of Baal and Yahweh). The separation of the first divine couple, as the result of Baal's carrying Asherah away, seems to be indicated by the following scene: When Baal sends Asherah to El to demand a palace from him, El "opens his mouth and laughs" and asks: "Why has the Procreatress of the Gods come? ... Does the love of El the King stir you?" But Asherah answers, scornfully: "Our King is 'AI'iyan Baeal, our Judge, and there is none above him" (Ugaritic Manual, no. 51; trans. Oldenburg, p. 118). It is not until later, when Baal kills Asherah's 77 sons (Ugaritic Manual, no. 75; Oldenburg, p. 117) that the goddess approaches El and urges him to take vengeance. Yam is identical with the ophidian dragon (tannin) Lotan, the Leviathan of the Old Testament. Cf. Psalm 74: 14: "You crushed Leviathan's heads." The Apocalypse (12:3 fr.) describes "a huge red dragon, which had seven heads." On Yam, see, among others, Gray, The Legacy of Canaan, pp. 26 fr., 86 fr.; Oldenburg, Conflict, pp. 32-34, 134-37, and the comparative study in T. Gaster, Thespis, pp. 114 fr.

Roberts, The Earliest Semitic Pantheon, pp. 37 if.; Wolfgang HeIck, Betrachtungen, pp. 155 if. The goddess Ashtarte seems to be a double of Anath and plays almost no role. "A new mythological text has restored her importance and emphasizes her warlike character and her role as protector of justice and right" (R. de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, p. 145, referring to a text published by Charles Virolleaud, Le Palais Royal d' Ugarit, vol. 5, and to the commentary by W.

Archaic elements typical of fertility cults abound: stone phalli, images of the naked goddess, tauromorphic images of Baal, animal masks and horns worn by certain priests (see Schaeffer, Cuneiform Texts, p. 64, pI. X, fig. 2). On the public sacrifice offered by men and women (and by the king and queen) to expiate confessed sins, see A. Caquot, "Un sacrifice expiatoire ii. Ras Shamra," RHPR 42 (1962): 201-11. As R. de Vaux observes (Histoire, p. 146), the Canaanite sacrifices and the Israelite sacrifices "had a common ritual; for example, the holocaust of the prophets of Baal and that of Elijah on Mount Carmel are prepared in the same way (I Kings 18)." On the Canaanite cult, see now Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion, pp. 57 ff., with recent bibliographical references.

Gordon, The Common Background of Greek and Hebrew Civilizations (New York, 1965), pp. 128 ff. This author sees in the poem of Keret "the earliest known example of the Helen of Troy motif," a motif of Indo-European origin, documented in India and Greece but unknown in Mesopotamia and Egypt (Gordon, pp. 132 ff.). On this problem, see also Michael C. Astour, Hellenosemitica, 2d ed. (1967), who explains the reciprocal borrowings and analogies between the SyroPalestinian and Greek worlds by their geographical situations and their political idiosyncrasies: "Both were broken, geographically dismembered territories without a central axis. This brought about similar state formations and internal orders.... The Greek and the West-Semitic worlds formed a common circle of small states, incapable of unification and centralization, unless if conquered by some outside empire" (pp. 358-59).

On the date of the patriarchs, see R. de Vaux, Histoire, pp. 245-53. On the "god of the father," see Albrecht Alt, Der Gott der Viiter (1929; = Kleine Schriften zur Geschichte des Volkes Israel [1953], vol. 1, pp. 1-78); also available in an English translation: Essays on Old Testament History and Religion, trans. R. A. Wilson (New York, 1968) (see pp. 1-100). Alt's theses are discussed in Fohrer, pp. 36 if.; de Vaux, pp. 256 if.; Ringgren, La religion d'Israel, pp. 29 if. The relations between the "god of the father" and EI, and between EI and Yahweh, have recently been analyzed from a new viewpoint by R. M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), pp. 1-76. The interpretation of the name El Shaddai is still in dispute. It has been proposed to derive it from a word related to the Akkadian sadil, "mountain": it would be "(EI) of the Mountains"; cf. Ringgren, pp. 34-35. But since it would be preferable to find an etymology for it in the Semitic of the Northwest, the Hebrew saday/sadeh has recently been proposed: this would be "EI of the Plain, or of the Fields, or of the Steppe " (de Vaux, p. 264, with bibliography). It is noteworthy that the patriarchal narratives that know El do not mention Baal. This indicates that the ancestors of the Israelites, entering Canaan before the period of the Hyksos, did not find the cult of Baal; that god acquired his importance toward the middle of the second millennium, or perhaps a little earlier, at Ugarit: see de Vaux, p. 266. However, as we have already observed (p. 152, n. 26), there was probably a local god of storms and agricultural fertility whose name was forgotten after Baal was introduced. There is no sign of the cult of "idols" among the patriarchs. But when Rachel is ready to leave the house of her father, Laban, she steals from him the teraphim, the domestic idols (Gen. 31: 19) that Laban calls "my gods" (31 :30). On the meaning of the teraphim, see A. R. Johnson, The Cu/tic Prophet in Ancient Israel, 2d ed. (1962), pp. 32 if., and Rowley, Worship in Ancient Israel, pp. 19 if. In any case, Rachel's act cannot be an indication of the religion of Jacob. See also Ringgren, pp. 38-39. As for circumcision, it was probably practiced in the time of the patriarchs. Its origin is unknown; see R. de Vaux, Les Institutions de I'Ancien Testament, 2d ed. (Paris, 1961), pp. 78-82; Eng. trans., pp. 46--48; E. Isaac, "Circumcision as a Covenant Rite," Anthropos 59 (1964): 444--56. It has been maintained that circumcision was borrowed from the Egyptians, but it was not universally practiced in Egypt. On the other hand, the custom is documented in northern Syria from the beginning of the third millennium. Hence the ancestors of the Israelites could have known it before they arrived in Canaan. "At that time it had its primitive meaning as an initiation into marriage and the common life of the clan, as it still

has in Gen. 34: 14-16; it is only later that it became the sign of the covenant between God and his people, which the priestly author of Gen. 17 refers to the time of Abraham" (de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, vol. 1, p. 273; the recent bibliography is given in notes 94 and 96). On circumcision as an initiation rite in archaic societies, see Eliade, Birth and Rebirth: The Religious Meanings of Initiation in Human Culture, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York, 1958), pp. 21 if.

On blood sacrifices, see R. de Vaux, Les sacrifices de l'Ancien Testament (Paris, 1964), pp. 7-27 (Eng. trans., Studies in Old Testament Sacrifice [Cardiff, 1964], chap. 1); de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, pp. 270 ff. On the Central Arabian customs, see J. Henninger, "La religion bedouine preislamique," inL'antica societa beduina, ed. F.

See also Henninger's recent book, Lesfetes de printemps chez les Semites et la Paque israelite (Paris, 1975) (copious bibliographies).
58. The figure of Moses has recently given rise to some rather original interpretations; see E. Auerbach, Moses (Amsterdam, 1953); H. Cazelles, Moise, l'homme de l'Alliance (1955); H. H. Rowley, From Joseph to Joshua (Oxford, 1950); Rowley, "Moses and the Decalogue," BJRL 34 (1951): 81-118. See also R. Smend, Das Mosebild von Heinrich Ewald bis Martin Noth (1959). On Moses' mission, see de Vaux, Histoire ancienne, pp. 305 ff. On the various traditions concerning the departure from Egypt and the Passover, see Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion, pp. 68 ff.; R. de Vaux, Institutions, vol. 2, pp. 383-94 (bibliography, pp. 467-68) (Eng. trans., pp. 484-93, 550-51); de Vaux, Les sacrifices de l'Ancien Testament, pp. 7 ff. (Eng. trans. chap. 1). The influence of Passover on the tradition recorded in Exodus 1-15 has been especially emphasized by J. Pedersen, Israel: Its Life and Culture (1940), vol. 3, pp. 384-415; vol. 4, pp. 728-37; his theory has been criticized and modified by G. von Rad and S. Mowinckel; see Fohrer, History, pp. 68 ff. As we have already observed (p. 179), the celebration of Passover, originally a pastoral spring festival, was explained as the ritual commemoration of the departure from Egypt; in other words, a periodical ceremony expressing cosmic religiosity ends by being historicized. On the other hand, the fabulous events of the Exodus, i.e., the passage of the Sea of Reeds and the destruction of the Egyptian army, received, as time passed, two different interpretations. In the oldest documentation (Exodus 15:1

10), pharaoh's troops are buried under waves raised by the breath of Yahweh. It is only later, in the Psalms, that the parting of the sea is mentioned: "Dividing the sea, bringing them through, making the waters stand up like dikes" (Ps. 78: 13; cf. Ps. 77:17-20). In this case the miracle of the Sea of Reeds is put into relation with the Creation, that is, with Yahweh's victory over the marine monster Rahab and Leviathan: "Did you not split Rahab in two and pierce the dragon through? Did you not dry up the sea, the waters of the great Abyss, to make the seabed a road for the redeemed to cross?" (Isaiah 51 :9-10). The Exodus, as well as the conquest of Canaan (and, later, the return of the exiles, announced by the text of Deutero-Isaiah that we have just quoted), in some sort constitutes a repetition of the cosmogonic work (see Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, pp. 100 ff.). But in the last analysis the two viewpoints-historic and cosmological-are complementary; the conquest of Canaan, most certainly a historical event, is equally a divine work, for it is Yahweh who insures the victory of the Israelites.
59. In his book Law and Covenant in Israel and the Ancient Near East (Pittsburgh, 1955), B. E. Mendenhall has compared the Code of the Covenant with the treaties that the Hittite kings concluded with their vassals in Asia Minor. Such a treaty contains, after a preamble (stating the king's name and titles and summarizing the existent relations between the two parties), the stipulations imposed on the vassal, instructions for the preservation of the document in a temple and its solemn periodical reading, the list of the witnessing gods, and, finally, formulas of malediction and benediction. Albright, who accepts the thesis, stresses the necessity of treaties and contracts for the primitive Hebrews, the majority of whom were caravaners; see his Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan, pp. 107 ff., with bibliographies. Mendenhall's thesis is criticized in R. de Vaux, Histoire, p. 410, n. 141. De Vaux asks how the seminomadic group led by Moses could have known the contracts of the Hittite kings. Then, too, there are differences in the structures of the two texts; for example, in the Code of the Covenant the closing maledictions and benedictions are lacking. In addition, whereas the "stipulations" are usually expressed in the form of conditions-"If it happens that ... "-but the Covenant employs apodeictic formulas. De Vaux observes that the Hittite kings' treaties with semibarbarous peoples do not follow the classic formula. Hence there are several types of "covenant formula" (De Vaux, p. 413). On the role of the oasis of Kadesh Barnea in the constitution of the Yahwistic traditions, see T. J. Meek, Hebrew Origins (New York, 1936; reprint, 1960), pp. 119 ff.; R. de Vaux, Les Institutions de I'Ancien Testament, vol. 2, pp. 228 ff. (Eng. trans., pp. 369 ff.); Ringgren, pp. 49 ff. (Eng.

61. The history of studies-in particular the history of the hypotheses concerning the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and their migrations-is summarized by P. Bosch-Gimpera, Les Indo-Europeens, trans. R. Lantier (Paris, 1961), pp. 21-96, and by G. Devoto, Origini indeuropee (Florence, 1962), pp. 8-194. These two works contain important
bibliographies. The work by o. Schrader, Reallexicon der indogermanische Altertumskunde, 2d ed. (Berlin and Leipzig, 1917-32), has not been replaced. See also A. Nehring, "Studien zur indogermanischen Kultur und Urheimat," in W. Koppers et aI., Die Indogermanen- und Germanenfrage (Salzburg and Leipzig, 1936), pp. 7-229. Accounts of the most recent archeological excavations will be found in some works by Marija Gimbutas: The Prehistory ofEastern Europe (1956); Bronze Age Cultures in Central and Eastern Europe (The Hague, 1965); "Proto-Indo-European Culture: The Kurgan Culture during the Fifth, Fourth and Third Millennia B.C.," in George Cordona, ed., Indo-European and Indo-Europeans (Philadelphia, 1970), pp. 155-97; "The Beginning of the Bronze Age in Europe and the Indo-Europeans: 3500-2500 B.C.," JIES 1 (1973): 163-214; and "The Destruction of Aegean and East Mediterranean Urban Civilization around 2500 B.C.," in R.

Thomas, in "New Evidence for Dating the Indo-European Dispersal in Europe" (Indo-European and Indo-Europeans, pp. 199-251), proposes to carry back the dates of the expansion of the Indo-Europeans (radiocarbon analysis shows their presence in Holland ca. 2470 or 2600 B.C.). Ward H. Goodenough, in "The Evolution of Pastoralism and IndoEuropean Origins" (ibid., pp. 253-65) places the homeland of the IndoEuropeans in the eastern regions of Poland and in the western Ukraine. See also Paul Friedrich, "Proto-Indo-European Trees," ibid., pp. 11-34; T. Burrow, "The Proto-Indoaryans," JRAS (1973): 123-40; M. M.

Mayrhofer in IIJ 7 (1964): 208 fr., and in Die Arien im Vorderen Orient-Ein Mythos? (Vienna, 1974). The religious function of the tumuli (kurgan) indicates a strong ancestor cult, comparable to that of the megalithic civilizations (cf. § 35). See also R.

(Philadelphia, 1955), pp. 15-38. The work by Leopold von Schroder, Arische Religion, 2 vols. (Leipzig, 1914, 1916), can still be used. In the first volume the author presents the Indo-European supreme beings, in the second the cosmic divinities (Earth, Sun, Fire, etc.). A third volume would have studied the notion of the soul and the ancestor cult. Of the vast literature directly or indirectly inspired by National Socialist ideology, we may cite, as an example, Friedrich Cornelius, Indogermanische Religionsgeschichte (Munich, 1942). The first volume (the only one published) of Glaubensgeschichte der Indogermanen (Stuttgart, 1937) by J. W. Hauer is really made up of a series of independent studies. A critique of the racist interpretation of Indo-European spirituality will be found in the various contributions brought together under the title Die Indogermanen- und Germanenfrage, published by W. Koppers in the series Wiener Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte und Linguistik (Salzburg and Leipzig, 1936), and in the third volume of Rassen und Viilker im Vorgeschichte und Geschichte des Abendlandes (Lucerne, 1946), by Wilhelm Schmidt (esp. pp. 275-318). On the Indo-European religious vocabulary, see G. Devoto, Origini indeuropee, pp. 295 if., and the second volume of E. Benveniste, Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-europeennes (Paris, 1969). For a penetrating analysis of the term theos, see G. Gallavotti, "Morfologia di theos," SMSR 33 (1962): 25-43. On the Iranian divinity of fire, see Stig Wikander, Der arische Miinnerbund (Lund, 1938), pp. 76 if., and § 104 above. Eric Hamp (against Benveniste, vol. 2, pp. 223 if.) has recently demonstrated the existence of a common Indo-European term for "sacrifice"; see his "Religion and Law from Iguvium," JIES 1 (1973): 322. A late development associates divine energy with the souls of the dead, especially among the Germans, where the original root GHAV, GHUTO, which designated the "evoked," ends by expressing the idea of god. Equally late in appearing, it seems, is the term WELO, "soul," which signifies "he who frees himself into the air," that is to say, is set free by cremation; see Devoto, Origini, pp. 295-316. It is important to point out a characteristic diiference between the IndoEuropeans and the Semites: the value attributed to writing. Herodotus 1. 136 reports that the Persians teach their sons only three things: to ride, to shoot with the bow, and to tell the truth. According to a passage in the annals of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal V, the Semitic sovereign learns to ride (and to drive the chariot), to shoot with the bow, and "the wisdom of Nabu and the art of writing in accordance with the traditions of the masters"; see G. Widengren, Numen 1 (1954): 63, n. 311; Widengren, Religionsphiinomenologie (Berlin, 1969), pp. 570 if. See also G. Dumezil, "La tradition druidique et l'ecriture: Le Vivant et Ie Mort," RHR 122

This radical difference between the Indo-European religions, based on oral tradition, and the" religions of the Book," where the scribes enjoyed great prestige, created difficulties when the Zoroastrian clergy decided to publish its sacred book, the Avesta, for even in the Sassanian period (third-seventh centuries), writing was considered a work of the demons; see A. Bausani, Persia religiosa (Milan, 1959), pp. 20 ff. See also G. Widengren, "Holy Book and Holy Tradition in Iran: The Problem of the Sassanid Avesta," in F. F. Bruce and E. G. Rupp, eds., Holy Book and Holy Tradition (Manchester, 1968), pp. 36--53.
63. The most convenient introduction to the work of Georges Dumezil is L'Ideologie tripartie des Indo-Europeens (Brussels, 1958). The bibliog
raphy of his work down to 1960 is given in Hommages aGeorges Dumezil (Brussels, 1960), pp. xi-xxiii. For a chronological presentation of Dumezil's studies and an analysis of the criticisms that have been directed against him, see C. Scott Littleton, The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumezil (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966). A certain number of studies of Dumezil's concepts have been published in the volumes Myth and Law among the Indo-Europeans, ed. Jaan Puhvel (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1970), and Myth in IndoEuropean Antiquity, ed. G. I. Larson (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1974). See also the articles by J. F. Richards, Alf Hiltebeitel, J. Gonda, C. Scott Littleton, and David M. Knipe in Journal of Asian Studies 34 (1974): 127-68. Richard Bodeus, "Societe ath6nienne, sagesse grecque et ideal indo-europeen," L'Antiquite Classique 41 (1972): 453-86, has brilliantly examined Dumezil's concept of tripartition in the light of the Greek data. While waiting for the new edition of the three volumes of Dumezil's Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus (Paris, 1941-45) and of Mitra-Varur;za: Essai sur deux representations indo-europeennes de la souverainte (1940; 2d ed., 1948), one may read Heur et malheur du guerrier (Paris, 1969), a recasting of Aspects de la fonction guerriere chez les Indo-Europeens (1956) (Eng. trans. by Alf Hiltebeitel, The Destiny of the Warrior [Chicago, 1970]);

In the first volume of Mythe et Epopee (pp. 31-257), Dumezil develops Stig Wikander's demonstration regarding the existence of the tripartite schema in the Mahiibhiirata. Wikander's article, "La legende des Pandava et Ie fond mythique du Mahabharata" (in Swedish, in Religion och Bibel, vol. 6, pp. 27-39) was translated by Dumezil in Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus (1948), supplementary vol. 4, pp. 37-53.

Mitani," Academie royale de Belgique, Bulletin de fa Cfasse des Lettres, 5th ser. 47 (1961): 265-98. According to V. M. Apte, from the time of the redaction of the first nine books of the Rig Veda, "the society was thought of as composed of priests, warriors, and stock-breeders; and if these groups were not yet called by their names of brahmana, k~atriya, and vaisya, the abstract substantives-names of notions-of which these names of persons are only derivatives, were already formed into a hierarchical system that distributively defined the principles of the three activities: brahman (neuter), 'knowledge and use of the mystical correlations among the parts of the real, visible or invisible'; k~atra, 'power'; and vis, at once 'peasantry' and 'organized habitat' and, in the plural, visab, 'ensemble of the people in its local and social groupings '" (Dumezil, L'ideofogie tripartie, p. 8, summarizing V. M. Apte, "Were Castes Formulated in the Age of the Rig Veda?" Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, no. 2, pp. 34--46). Dumezil finds the tripartite schema recurring in the succession of the first Roman kings: (1) Romulus, redoubtable sovereign (type VaruQa); (2) Numa the Wise, founder of cults and laws (type Mitra); (3) Tullus Hostilius, exclusively a warrior (lndra; Mars); and (4) Ancus Marcius, a pacific king, under whom the Roman masses and wealth developed (Quirinus) (Dumezil, Heur et malheur du guerrier, pp. 15 if.) (The Destiny of the Warrior, pp. 7 if.).

According to von Bradke, the word asura appears 71 times in the Rig Veda (57 times in the singular, 4 in the dual, and 10 in the plural); of the 10 times that the word appears in the plural, it has a meaning hostile to the devas 8 times; in contrast, in the singular the word has this hostile meaning only 4 times (von Bradke, p. 22).

Dumezil finds the same scenario among the Romans, in Greece, and in Scandinavia; see his Heur et malheur du guerrier, pp. 33 if., 63 if. (Destiny of the Warrior, pp. 29 if., 65 if.). The paradigmatic combat between Indra and Vrtra later gave rise to a daring interpretation, though one that had been prepared for by the Vedic conception of divine ambivalence and bipolarity. The god-champion becomes the "brother" of the dragon, since the latter was created by Tvam, Indra's father. According to the myth, Tvastr had failed to invite his son to a soma sacrifice. But Indra, succeeding in approaching the sacrifice, seized the soma by force. Furious, his father threw what was left of the divine liquid into the fire, exclaiming: "Grow, and become Indra's enemy!" From this remaining portion of soma, poured into the fire, Vrtra was born (Taitt. Sarrz. 2. 4. 12 and 5. 1 if.; Kausitaki Br. 15.2-3). But the latter quickly swallowed the gods Agni and Soma, and the other divinities took fright. Alarmed, TvaHr gave lightning to Indra, thus insuring his final victory. Satapatha BrahmOlJa 1. 6. 3 gives a highly significant detail: conquered, Vrtra addresses Indra in these terms: "Strike me not, for thou art now what I was." Such myths, and their theological exegesis,
reveal a less well known, because less obvious, aspect of divine history. One might almost say that this is a .. secret history" of the divinity, which is
intelligible only to initiates, that is to say, to those who know the tradition and understand the doctrine. The "secret" Vedic history reveals, on the one hand, the blood brotherhood of the Devas and Asuras, the fact that these two
classes of superhuman beings sprang from one and the same principle; and on the other, it makes clear the coincidentia oppositorum in the deep nature of the
divinities, who are by turns, or simultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar and ophidian (that is, manifest and virtual), etc. One recognizes the effort of the Indian spirit to discover a single principle which will explain the world, to reach a standpoint from which contraries are resolved and contradictions abolished (Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 93-94).

By examining a certain number of analogies between the agnicayana ritual and the indigenous culture characterized by black-and-red ceramics (construction of an altar with 10,800 bricks, although the Aryans of the Vedic period did not use bricks; cooking technique; references to "Orientals" assimilated to the Asuras; etc.), H. S. Converse concludes that this species of sacrifice was non-Aryan in origin; see his "The agnicayana Rite: Indigenous Origin?" HR 14 (1974): 81-95.

Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View, pp. 79 if.; and, especially, J. C. Heesterman, the Ancient Indian Royal Consecration (The Hague, 1957). In protohistoric times the riijasuya was probably annual and was celebrated to regenerate the cosmos. Its structure resembles that of the Indian seasonal festivities, utsava. It is also probable that, in ancient times, the people played a more important part in it. The study by Ananda Coomaraswamy, "Atmayajiia: Self-Sacrifice," HlAS 6 (1942): 358-98, deserves to be consulted for the author's courageous and profound exegesis.
75. In India the myth of the cosmogonic dive was preserved in a comparatively archaic form, since it is a Great God who descends to the bottom of the primordial waters and brin~s up the earth. In the Briihmat;las, it is Prajapati who dives, transformed into a boar. In the Riimayana, the role is transferred to Brahma; in the Vi~t;lu-Puriit;la, the boar is Brahma-Vi~I).u, and in the Bhiigavata Puriit;la it is an avatiira ofVi~I).u (see the references in Eliade, Zalmoxis, pp. 115-17). But it is only from the period of the epic and the PuraI).as that this cosmogonic myth becomes popular. It is probable, furthermore, that it contains pre-Aryan elements, either Munda or proto-Munda; see Zalmoxis, pp. 117 if. From the abundant literature on the Indian cosmogonies, we mention some recent publications: Norman W. Brown, "The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda," lAOS 62 (1942): 85-98; Stella Kramrisch, "The Triple Structure of Creation in the Rig Veda," HR 2 (1962-63): 140-75, 256-91 ; F. B. J.

In India, the loss of immortality in corpore, for the benefit of a spiritual "nondeath," also had consequences in the relations between gods and men; according to certain traditions, in the beginning the gods descended and met with men in their corporeal forms (see Taittiriya Saf11hitii 3. 5. 2; Kiithaka Saf11. 37. 17; Paiicavimsa Br. 15. 5. 24). This represents a rather widespread archaic conception.
76. According to another tradition, Prajapati was himself the product of tapas: in the beginning, non-Being (asat) became "thought" (manas); growing hot (atiipyata), thought gave birth to smoke, light, fire, and finally to Prajapati (Taitt. Br. 2. 2. 9. 1-10). In the Satapatha Br. 11. 1. 6. 1 non-Being is represented by the primordial waters. In Rig Veda 10.61. 7, mention is made of the incest between the Sky Father and his daughter, the Dawn. In the BriihmaIJas, it is Prajapati who desires his daughter (Sat. Br. 1. 7. 4). He approached her in the form of a stag (A itt. Br. 3.33.34); he even attempted to possess her, but the gods prevented him, and Prajapati's semen, spilled on the ground, produced a lake (A it. Br. 13. 1-10). On the importance of this mythical theme, see

We mention, in particular, the translations by Emile Senart (Brhadiirat:zyaka, 1930; Chiindogya, 1934), by Louis Renou (Kii{ha, Kena, /sa, Kau~itaki), by J. Maury (Mut:zt}aka), E.

Varenne (Ganapati, Mahiiniiriiyana, Priiniignihotra). There is a good selection in J. Varenne, Le Veda, vol. 2, pp. 614-704. The same author has published Les Upanishads du Yoga, translated from the Sanskrit with annotations (Paris, 1971). The critical bibliography is given in Eliade, Yoga, pp. 388-89, and J. Gonda, Les religions de I'Inde, vol. 1, pp. 232, 239. Particularly useful are R. D. Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy (Poona, 1926); H. Oldenberg, Die Lehre der Upanishaden und die Anflinge des Buddhismus (Gottingen, 1915); S. N.

The Upanishads are considered to be annexes to the four Vedas; hence they form part of the "revelation" (sruti). To be sure, in the Rig Veda "knowledge" already possessed a magico-religious value. In the Briihmat:zas the "science" of sacrifice insured immortality: the world of the gods "belongs only to those who know" (Sat. Br. 10. 5. 4. 16). But in the Upanishads, the "science" of sacrifice is replaced by the knowledge of



Critical Bibliographies 445
Brahman. For "sacrifices are like boats floating in the open sea, which can sink at any moment" (MufJtjaka Up. 1. 2. 7).
81. The Vedic and Brahmanic conceptions concerning postexistence in the beyond are complex and confused. A famous hymn to Soma (RV 9. 113) reveals the desire of the soul to be placed "there where perpetual light shines, in the same world where the sun had its place.... There where Yama is ... , where is the enclosure of the sky ... , where the eternally young waters are, make me an immortal in that place, 0 Soma" (after the translation by Jean Varenne). The journey to the sky, the bridge that connects earth and sky, the two dogs that guard the bridge, the questioning of the soul are all motifs that are found in both ancient India and Iran; they probably go back to the period of Indo-Iranian unity (see § 111). Existence underground, where-according to another tradition that ended by becoming predominant-Yama reigns, is reserved for sinners of all kinds. "These worlds, whose name is 'The Sunless,' covered as they are with all kinds of blind darkness; to them, after their death, go those who have killed their soul" (lsa Up. 1. 3). From the Satapatha BriihmafJa on, the texts describe a certain number of tortures. In the course of time the descriptions of the twenty-one hells become increasingly dramatic. Sinners are eaten by wild beasts and snakes, they are elaborately roasted, cut to pieces with saws, tormented by thirst and hunger, boiled in oil or pounded in mortars, ground in stone or iron pots, etc. But after undergoing such sufferings, the victims are not at the end of their torments: they are still to experience the agonies that accompany their migration into various animal bodies. The hells have their counterpart in the celestial paradises that correspond to them. The epics-the Mahiibhiirata and the Riimayana-and the PurafJas describe especially the five heavens of the five great gods. In ascending order, these are the Heaven of Indra, peopled by women dancers and musicians; the Heaven of Siva, where the god and his family reign; the Heaven of Vi~Qu, made entirely of gold and dotted with pools covered with lotus flowers; the Heaven of Kr:~Qa, with his dancing girls and his devotees; and finally the Heaven of Brahma, where the souls enjoy the celestial nymphs. The palaces of gold and precious stones, the paradisal gardens, the musical instruments that accompany the songs and dances of ravishingly beautiful girls are tirelessly described. Some of these Hindu paradisal themes will be taken up again by Buddhist authors. In the BriihmafJas the idea of a "new death" (punarmrtyu) takes shape, that is, the "second death," which is final and awaits the souls of those who have not performed certain sacrifices. However, the notion of karman ends by assimilating this second death to the return to earth in the form of

a new incarnation. According to the Upanishads, the souls of the dead depart by the" road of the Manes" (pitryiina), or the lunar road. Arrived on the moon, the souls undergo an interrogation of the initiatory type; those that are unable to answer fall back to earth, to be reborn there. "Those who know" make their way to the gods by the" road of the gods" (devayiina), also called the solar road. The Kau~itaki Up. (1. 2-7) gives the following details: from the world of the gods the souls proceed to the world of the Brahman, where they are confronted with various initiatory ordeals. Brahman questions the newcomer: "Who art thou?" and the newcomer must answer: "What thou art, I am." Brahman says to him: "Then who am I?" "Truth," the soul must answer (1. 6). In the end Brahman says: "What has been my domain is henceforth thine" (1. 7). In short, the first road leads to a new reincarnation, while the second gives access to the world of the gods. But to reach the transcendental world of Brahman, the soul must undergo still more initiatory ordeals. In other words, after death, there are three possibilities: (1) the soul's return to earth, in a new incarnation; (2) a paradisal sojourn among the gods; (3) identification of the soul with Brahman. According to the authors of the Upanishads, the celestial paradise is provisional and, after a certain time, souls are obliged to return to earth and be reincarnated. Hence the only real possibility of deliverance is postmortem identification with Brahman, made possible by gnosis and contemplation. On the" inner light," see Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 26 ff. ; Eliade, "Spirit, Light and Seed," HR 11 (1971): I-30, esp. pp. 3-16 (now in Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions [Chicago, 1976]); J. Gonda, The Vision ofthe Vedic Poets (1963), pp. 268 ff.
82. On the two modalities of Brahman, cf. H. de Glasenapp, La philosophie indienne, French trans. (Paris, 1951), pp. 131 ff. The paradox of the "corporeal" (" mortal") and "incorporeal" (" immortal ") Brahman carries on the speculations concerning the ambivalence of certain Vedic gods and the coincidence of contraries that, for Indian thought, defines divinity; see, above, the supplementary notes to § 68. On cosmic "play," see Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "Lila," lAOS (1941): 98-101.
83. The historical study and hermeneutic analysis of Greek religion make up one of the most fascinating chapters in the history of European culture. Since it is impossible to summarize the different interpretations in a few lines-from those of K. O. Muller or F. G. Welcker, in the mid

nineteenth century, to the most recent contributions by Brelich, Burkert, or Vernant and Detienne-we will give only the essentials of the bibliography. First to be mentioned are some synthetic works: Gilbert Murray, The Five Stages of Greek Religion (1925); M. P. Nilsson, A History of Greek Religion (1925; 2d ed., 1949); L. Gernet and A. Boulanger, Le genie grec dans la religion (1932); O. Kern, Die religion der Griechen, 3 vols. (1926-38); W. K. C. Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods (1950); R. Pettazzoni, La religion dans la Grece antique, French trans. (Paris, 1953). Still to be read with profit are J. E. Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (Cambridge, 1903; 2d ed., 1922); H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (London, 1928; 4th ed., 1950). Walter Otto has published an admirable, and very personal, interpretation of Greek religion and mythology under the title Die Gotter Griechenlands (Frankfurt, 1928). The book by U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, Der Glaube der Hellenen, 2 vols. (Berlin, 1931-32), represents the testament of the great German historian and philologist. Finally, the enormous work by M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion, 2 vols. (Munich, 1940; 3d ed., 1947, 1950), is a veritable summa, indispensable for the wealth of its documentation. The five volumes of L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States (Oxford, 1896-1909), are still useful for the materials collected and analyzed. The book by E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley, 1951), enjoys an astonishing popularity; its success reflects certain tendencies of the contemporary Zeitgeist. See now the recent synthesis by Walter Burkert, Griechische Religion der archaischen und klassischen Epochen (Stuttgart, 1977).
On Zeus, A. B. Cook has published an extensive work, Zeus, 3 vols. (Cambridge, 1914-40); actually, it is rather a series of monographs on various aspects of the god and, in general, of Greek religion. There is no need to indicate the chapters devoted to Zeus in various general works. The essentials have been presented by Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 49-81. See also M. P. Nilsson, "Vater Zeus," ARW 35 (1938): 156-71 (republished in Opuscula Selecta 2 [Lund, 1952]: 710--31), and especially Hugh Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus (Berkeley, 1971). For the Theogony, we use the edition by M. L. West, Hesiod's Theogony, edited with Prolegomena and Commentary (Oxford, 1966). The parallels with the ancient Near East have been frequently discussed since 1940; see Peter Walcott, Hesiod and the Near East (Cardiff, 1966). It was Gaea who advised Rhea to give birth in Crete. The two goddesses are the hypostases of Mother Earth; indeed, the etymology of Rhea is "the broad," i.e., the Earth. When he was forced by Zeus to disgorge his brothers and sisters, Kronos first vomited up the stone; it was set up by Zeus at Delphi, at the

foot of Parnassus (Pausanias 10. 24. 6); cf. West, Hesiod's Theogony, p. 303 (commentary on lines 498-500).
84. On Metis, his first wife, and the consequences of her being swallowed by Zeus, see J. P. Vernant, "Metis et les mythes de souverainete," RHR 3 (1971): 29-76. On Zeus Cretagenes, his infancy in Crete, and the relations with the Cretan male god, see Charles Picard, Les religions prehelMniques (Paris, 1948), pp. 115 if.; H. Jeanmaire, Couroi' et Couretes (Lille, 1939), pp. 427 if.; Martin P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek Religion, 2d ed. (Lund, 1950), pp. 55 if. West, Hesiod's Theogony, pp. 297 if., has shown the antiquity of the tradition of the infancy in Crete (Theog. 477).
On the" golden cord" with which Zeus could draw all things to him, see Pierre Leveque, Aurea Catena Homeri (Paris, 1959), and Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 179 if.
We add some particulars in regard to the primordial divinities who survived the triumph of the Olympians. Night gave birth, by herself, to a number of semidivine beings, rather indistinct and more nearly resembling personified abstractions: Death, Sleep, Sarcasm, Woe, Old Age, etc. (Hesiod, Theog. 211 if.). But the Orphic texts present her as Mother and universal queen (see Kern, Orph.fragm., nos. 24, 28, 28a, 65, etc.). On the mythico-religious structure of Nyx and the meaning of her progeny, see Dario Sabbatucci, Saggio sui misticismo greco (Rome, 1965), pp. 95 if. Pontus (the Barren Sea) had, from his union with Gaea, his mother, a considerable progeny; see L. Sechan and P. Leveque, Les grandes divinities de la Grece (Paris, 1966), p. 49 (and the bibliographical notes, p. 64). Because she had joined in the war against the Titans, Zeus proclaimed Styx "the great oath of the gods" (Theog. 399 if.). See also Sechan and Leveque, Les grandes divinites de la Grece, p. 64, n. 68.
As for Hecate, she is preeminently a primordial goddess. Zeus did not touch the rights and privileges that she possessed as a Titaness (Theog. 423 if.). Hecate will later become a goddess specializing in sorcery; see Diodorus, Bibl. 4. 45. Oceanus, the first Titan, "whose course, never sleeping, rolls around the immense earth" (Aeschylus, Prometheus 138 if.), married his sister Tethys. But there are certain traces of an archaic cosmogony, unknown to Hesiod and Homer, according to which Oceanus and Tethys incarnated the male and female principles in the primordial waters; in short, they represent the original couple, from which the gods and all reality descend; see Sechan and Leveque, pp. 50,51,65, Sabbatucci, pp. llQ..-16, and especially

the important study by J. P. Vernant, "Thetis et Ie poeme cosmogonique
d'Alcman," Hommage a Marie Delcourt, Latomus 114 (1970): 38-69, with a rich bibliography (see, e.g., p. 38, n. 2, 39, n. 8).
85. The literary sources for Kronos are brought together by Farnell, Cults, vol. 5, chap. 3. Certain scholars (Kern, Pohlenz) have seen in Kronos and the Titans divinities of the autochthonous population, conquered by the Aryan-speaking invaders. In other words, the conflict between the Olympians and the Titans would reflect certain historical events. But the Oriental parallels seem to invalidate this hypothesis. On the Hesiodic myth of the five ages, see the sources edited, with commentaries, by Arthur O. Lovejoy and George Boas, Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity (Baltimore, 1935), pp. 25 if. The parallel Iranian versions (especially the Bundahisn) are translated and discussed by N. S6derblom, ERE, vol. 1, pp. 205-19. Ugo Bianchi compares the golden race in Elysium with the Iranian tradition concerning the first king, Yima, who became sovereign of Vara, a country underground but miraculously illuminated; see his" Razza aurea, mito delle cinque razze ed Elisio," SMSR 34 (1963): 143-210, esp. 187-89. Rejecting the general opinion of scholars (for example, that advanced by H. C. Baldry, "Who Invented the Golden Age?" Classical Quarterly n.s. 2 [1952]: 83-92), J. Gwyn Griffiths, in" Archaeology and Hesiod's Five Ages," Journal of the History ofIdeas 17 (1956): 109-19, holds that the myth refers to the discovery and progressive use of metals; cf. Baldry's reply, Journal of the History ofIdeas 17 (1956): 553-54. Among the best discussions of this problem are J. Kerschensteiner, Platon und der Orient (Stuttgart, 1945), pp. 161 if. ("Der Metalmythos"); J. P. Vernant, "Le mythe hesiodique des races: Essai d'analyse structurale," RHR (1960): 21-54 (reprinted in the volume Mythe et pensee chez les Grecs [Paris, 1965], pp. 13-41); Vernant, "Le mythe hesiodique des races: Sur un essai de mise au point," Revue de Philologie (1966): 247-76 (republished in Mythe et pensee, pp. 42-79). On Prometheus, see E. Vandvick, The Prometheus of Hesiod and Aeschylus (Oslo, 1943); Louis Sechan, Le mythe de Promethee (Paris, 1951); Karl Kerenyi, Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence (New York, 1963) (the German edition was published in 1946).
86. On Greek sacrifices see R. K. Yerkes, Sacrifice in Greek and Roman Religions and Early Judaism (New York, 1952), esp. pp. 88 if., and, above all, Karl Meuli, "Griechische Opferbriiuche," Phyllobolia: Festschrift Peter von der Miihll (Basel, 1946), pp. 185-288, and Walter Burkert, Homo Necans (Berlin, 1972), pp. 8-97 and passim (p. 9, n. 2, for bibliography). As Meuli writes, "The Olympian sacrifice is simply a ritual slaughter"

(p. 223). A receptacle filled with water and a basket containing barley are brought. The participants wash their hands and also sprinkle the victim. Then they take out the barley, as if they were preparing a vegetarian meal -but at the bottom of the basket the knife is found. Certain ritual acts follow: a moment of silence, a prayer, the sacrificing priest cutting a few hairs from the victim's forehead and throwing them on the fire; when he strikes, all the women cry out together. The blood is collected in a vessel and poured on the altar. Then the femurs are burned with fat and small pieces of meat. The entrails are broiled on the altar and eaten on the spot (Meuli, pp. 265 ff.; cf. Burkert, Homo Necans, pp. 10 ff.). The festival of the Bouphonia (literally, the "murder of the ox "), celebrated at Athens, enables us to recover an interpretation of the blood sacrifice which contains archaic elements. "Taking advantage of his master's inattention, a plow ox approaches the altar of Zeus Polieus and begins eating the offerings laid on the altar, the cereals and cakes reserved for the god of the city. Seeing this sacrilege, the infuriated priest of Zeus seizes an ax, strikes the beast, and kills it. Terrified by the act he has committed, the 'murderer ofthe ox' flees posthaste, leaving the weapon of the crime on the spot. The second section of the ritual is played out in two parts. In the first, the case is judged at the Prytaneum before the proper tribunal for crimes of blood: the guilt of the ax is established, and it is expelled from Attic territory. In the second, the whole city ritually consumes the flesh of the victim, while the hide of the ox, stuffed with straw, is set up and harnessed to a plow in a simulacrum of work" (Marcel Detienne, Les lardins d'Adonis [paris, 1972], p. 106 [Eng. trans., The Gardens of Adonis (New York, 1976)]; for bibliography, see p. 105, n. 2; to this add Burkert, Homo Necans, pp. 154-61, and the article by U. Pestaiozza, "Le origini delle Buphonia ateniensi" [1956], now reprinted in Nuovi saggi di religione mediterranea [Florence, 1964], pp. 203-23).
The "comedy of innocence" (Unschuldskomodie; Meuli, pp. 224 ff.) is found again in the hunting rites of Siberian peoples (see inter alia, Eveline Lot-Falck, Les rites de chasse [Paris, 1953], pp. 170 ff.). M. Detienne cogently interprets the sacrilegious character of the blood sacrifice, as it was considered by the Greeks: "To offer the gods an animal victim is to shed blood, is to commit an actual murder. Animal sacrifice appears to the city to be a pollution; but it is an inevitable and necessary pollution, for killing the ox is an essential act in establishing the city's relations with the divine powers" (Les lardins d'Adonis, pp. 106-7). Like so many other peoples of protohistory, the Greeks also practiced human sacrifice, though for various reasons. The replacement of the man by the animal (e.g., Iphigenia; Isaac) has its parallel in sacrifices of human beings ritually identified with animal victims. Athamas kills his son

Learchus "like a stag" (Apollodorus, Bibl. 3.4.3); according to Lucian (De dea Syr. 58), at Bambyke, when children were sacrificed, those present cried, "They are calves!" The possible relations between the sacrifice of goats and the origin of tragedy have been reexamined by W. Burkert, "Greek Tragedy and Sacrificial Ritual," Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 7 (1966): 87-121. There are some differences between sacrifices for the Olympians and sacrifices offered to the chthonian divinities and the heroes; see § 95. On Prometheus and Deucalion, see J. Rudhardt, "Les mythes grecs

Dietrich, Death, Fate, and the Gods (London, 1967). On the symbolism of spinning., see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, § 58; on the equivalence between "spinning" someone's destiny and "binding" him, see Eliade, Images and Symbols, chap. 3, "The God Who Binds and the Symbolism of Knots." The history of the idea of justice, dike, has recently been brilliantly presented by Hugh Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus (Berkeley, 1971). Ever since Nilsson, parallels have been drawn between the structure of the Homeric pantheon and that of the feudal Mycenaean royalty. "Justice" (dike) can be compared to the will of the gods. Like the Mycenaean kings, the gods can be capricious and cruel, though they cannot descend to baseness. The only unforgiveable crime is disloyalty to the king or treachery. In Homer, dike seems to mean both the "characteristic behavior" of a social class and the" right" that devolves upon the individuals belonging to that class. The structure, the history, and the crisis of the Mycenaean sovereignty are well discussed by J. P. Vernant, Les origines de la pensee grecque (Paris, 1962), pp. 13-39.
On themis and themistes, see Lloyd-Jones, The Justice ofZeus, pp. 6 ff., 167-68 (bibliography). For the history of the idea of hybris, from antiquity to modern times, see the very personal work by Robert-Payne, Hubris: A Study of Pride (London, 1951; rev. ed.• New York, 1960).

88. On the etymology of Poseidon (Posis Dos) see Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen, vol. 1, pp. 212 ff. (discussed earlier by P. Kretschmer in Glotta 1 [1909]: 27 ff.; cf. also Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 583 ff.). See also Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 94-99; Louis Sechan and Pierre Leveque, Les grandes divinites de la Grece, pp. 99-116. F. Schachermeyr makes every effort to reconstruct the history of Poseidon: when, about 1900 B.C., the Indo-Europeans arrived in Greece, bringing with them the horse, they found a Mother Earth, a sovereign goddess accompanied by a male paredros; the conquerors identified this paredros with their horse god, master of the waters, of fertility, and of the infernal world. Poseidon-"husband of Da," Mother Earth-would be the result of this coalescence; see Schachermeyr, Poseidon und die Entstehung des griechischen Gotterglaubens (Berne, 1950). See also Leonard Palmer, Mycenaeans and Minoans (London, 1961), pp. 127 ff.; C. Scott Littleton, "Poseidon as a Reflex of the Indo-European 'Source and Waters' God," JIES 1 (1973): 423-40. Ileana Chirassi has brought out the differences between the Mycenaean Poseidon and the Olympian god (for example, the presence at Pylos of a goddess, Posideia, who probably reflects the archaic conception of primordial androgynous divinities, of the type of En-ki and Nin-ki, El and Elat, etc.); see Chirassi, "Poseidaon-Enesidaon nel pantheon miceno," Atti e Memorie del I Congresso Internazionale di Micenologia (Rome, 1968), pp. 945-91, esp. pp. 956 ff. On the chthonian meanings of the horse, see J. M. Blasquez, "El caballo en las creencias griegas y en las de otros pueblos circum-mediterraneos," Revue Beige de philologie et d'histoire 45 (1967): 48-80.
On Hephaestus see Farnell, Cults, vol. 5, pp. 374 ff. ; Nilsson, Geschichte, vol. 1, pp. 526 ff.; L. Malten, "Hephaistos," Jahrbiicher des deutschen archaeologischen Instituts 27 (1912): 232 ff.; F. Brommer, "Die Riickfiihrung des Hephaistos," ibid. 52 (1937): 198 ff.; and Marie De1court, Hephaistos u la Legende du magicien (Paris. 1957). A late tradition attempts to reconcile the two myths of the birth of Hephaestus: "Hera becomes pregnant by Zeus, but before their marriage. When Hephaestus is born, she declares, in order to save appearances, that she conceived him without a father" (De1court, p. 33). The episode with the golden throne that Hephaestus sent to Hera is not in Homer, but it soon became popular. Plato mentions it, disapprovingly, among the irresponsible legends current about the gods (Republic 2.378). See Delcourt, pp. 78-79, 86-96, where she reports and analyzes the versions transmitted by Libanius and Hyginus. On ritual mutilations of magicians, see Delcourt, pp. 110 ff. On "masters of fire" and divine smiths, see Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible, pp. 79 ff.

Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 453-59 (for criticism of theories and controversies); Nilsson, Geschichte, vol. 1, 529 if.; Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 73 if., 183 if. Cf. also K. Kerenyi, Apol/on (Vienna, 1937; 2d ed., 1953). On the substitution of Apollo for pre-Hellenic divinities, see Farnell, Cults, vol. 4, pp. 125 if., 263 if. The legend of Hyacinthus-whose etymology itself proves that he was an ancient Mediterranean god- is mentioned for the first time by Euripides (Helen 1470 if.; cf. Apollodorus, Bibl. 3. 10. 3; Rose, Handbook, pp. 142, 160-61). The mythico-religious meanings of the metamorphosis of Hyacinthus into a flower are analyzed by Ileana Chirassi, Elementi di culture precereali nei miti e riti greci (Rome, 1968), pp. 159 if. The festival of the Hyacinthia in Laconia was consecrated at once to Apollo and to his involuntary victim. At Ismenium, as at Delphi, Apollo is associated with Athena; at Tegyra, in northern Boeotia, he appears with Latona and Artemis; see Delcourt, L'oracle de De/phes (1955), pp. 216 if. In other words, as god of Delphi, Apollo is a creation of Greek religiosity. The two hypotheses concerning the origin of Apollo-northern or Anatolian-are discussed by Guthrie, pp. 75 if. On the legend of the Hyperboreans, see Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 459-501 (he identifies the itinerary with the Milky Way). Herodotus also speaks of two "Hyperborean virgins," who, long ago, came in person to Delos, bringing oiferings, and did not return. The historian had described their tombs so accurately that they were discovered by the French excavations at the place indicated. But there is nothing" Hyperborean" about them: they are Cycladic burials of the Bronze Age. What is involved, then, is an archaic cult whose meaning had been forgotten, and the sacred nature of the tombs was associated with imaginary heroes. Cf. C. T. Seltman, cited by Guthrie, p. 77. See also Charles Picard, Les religions prehelleniques, p. 271, for other examples of cults of heroes attached to Mycenaean tombs of historical Greece. Marie Delcourt (L'oracle de Delphes, p. 163) supposes that the hiera that the virgins brought to Delos, hidden in a sheaf of wheat, were images of the phallus, represented as a perforating weapon.

by Apollo and acquitted by Athena; what is more, the Erinyes (who, as symbols of the telluric and maternal forces, could not leave the most horrible of crimes, matricide, unavenged) are "converted" by Athena: they become the Eumenides-Kindly Goddesses-and are charged with nourishing and sustaining life. As for the pollution of the crime, it is washed away by the sacrifice of a pig (Eumenides 281 if.). Though prescribed by Apollo, this is a sacrifice peculiar to the chthonian and infernal powers. This goes to show that, despite his Olympian structure, the god of Delphi takes into account complementary, and even antagonistic, religious realities. On Delphi and the Delphic oracular traditions, see P. Amandry, La
mantique apollonienne a Delphes (Paris, 1950); J. Defradas, Les themes de la propagande delphique (1954); and Marie Delcourt, L'oracle de Delphes (1955). The oracular texts have been edited by H.

91. On Greek "shamanism," see my books: Shamanism, pp. 387 if.; Zalmoxis, pp. 34 if. (with bibliography). E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley, 1951), pp. 141 if., explains the dissemination of shamanic techniques and mythologies by contact between the Greek colonies of the Hellespont and the Black Sea and the Iranian populations (i.e., the Scythians). But Karl Meuli, who first brought out the shamanic structure of certain Scythian customs and showed their reflections in Greek traditions, has, in addition, identified shamanic elements in Greek epic poetry; see his "Scythica," Hermes 70 (1935): 121-76, esp. 164 if. Walter Burkert considers the goes the authentic Greek shaman, since he is connected with the cult of the dead ("Goes: Zum griechischen 'Schamanismus,'" Rheinisches Museum filr Philologie n.s. 105 [1962]: 35-55).

On moly, Hermes' herb, see Hugo Rahner, Greek Myths and Christian Mystery (New York and London, 1963), pp. 181 fr. See also the bibliographies on hermeticism in the second volume. From a certain point ofview, Ares, the god of war, constitutes an enigma. Homer does not hide the fact that he was detested by the gods: "Thou art the most hateful to me of all the immortals who inhabit Olympus! If thou wert born of some other god, destructive as thou art, thou wouldst long since have been in a place still lower than that of the sons of Uranus!" exclaims Hera, his mother (Iliad 5. 889 fr.). The Greeks celebrated him neither in cult nor in the plastic arts or literature, despite the fact that they "practiced war as much as, perhaps more than, any other people of antiquity" (Sechan and Leveque, Les grandes divinites de la Grece, p. 248). Compared to his Italic homologue, Mars, or to other Indo-European gods of war, Ares seems a minor divinity. According to Homer, Ares came from Thrace (II. 13. 301). And when he is freed from the net in which Hephaestus has shut him up with Aphrodite, Ares goes to Thrace (Od. 8. 361). Then too, Herodotus (5. 7) states that the Thracians worshiped only three gods: Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis. Was it because of his Thracian origin that this savage god"mad one who knows no law" (II. 5. 757)-never succeeded in becoming integrated into Greek religiosity?
93. According to W. H. Roscher, Hera must originally have been a moon goddess (Lexikon, I, II [1886-90], pp. 2087 fr.; cf. the criticism of this hypothesis in Farnell, Cults, vol. 1, pp. 180 fr.). For Rose, Hera was especially the goddess of women and their fecundity (but not of vegetable fertility); see his Handbook, p. 103. The idea maintained by Welcker (Die griechische Gotterlehre, 3 vols. [1857-63]), that she was a Terra Mater, rejected by Farnell and Rose, has been revived in a more convincing form by Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 68 fr.

A few words on the goddess Hestia will suffice. She has almost no myths, but she presents a certain ritual importance, since she protects

hearths, domestic or public. Homer does not know her name, but Hesiod proclaims her the eldest daughter of Kronos and Rhea (Theog. 454). Hestia is preeminently a virgin and "sedentary" goddess: she never leaves "the high dwellings of the immortal gods.". Etymologically connected with the Latin goddess Vesta, she incarnates the sacrality of fire; this probably explains her abstract character (cf. § 104). Her name has been derived from an Indo-European root meaning "to burn." But it is equally possible that the cult of Hestia continues a pre-Hellenic cult of the hearth; see C. Picard, Les religions prehelleniques, pp. 242 if. On Artemis, reference should be made to Farnell, Cults, vol. 2, pp. 425 if.; Nilsson, Geschichte, vol. 1, pp. 481-500; K. Hoenn, Artemis, Gestaltwandel einer Gottin (Zurich, 1946); and the clear exposition by Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 99-106. See also Ileana Chirassi, Miti e culti arcaici di Artemis nel Peloponese e Grecia centrale (Trieste, 1964).
An Illyrian origin of the name has been proposed by M. S. Ruiperez, Emerita 15 (1947): 1-60. On the type of Artemis at Ephesus, see Charles Picard, Ephese et Claros (Paris, 1922), pp. 474 if. On the Brauronia festival, involving the ritual transformation of young girls, followers of Artemis, into bear cubs (probably what took place was a bear dance), see H. Jeanmaire, Couroi et Couretes (Lille, 1939), pp. 237 if. From the seventh century on, Artemis was identified with Hecate, a lunar goddess, with the Thracian goddess Bendis, and with Cybele.
94. The interpretation of Athena as a pre-Greek goddess, protectress of Minoan or Mycenaean princes, proposed by Nilsson (Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, 2d ed., pp. 487 if.), has been generally accepted. For A. B. Cook, Athena was a pre-Greek goddess, specifically the Mountain Mother localized in the rock of the Acropolis (Zeus, vol. 3, p. 749; cf. ibid., pp. 224 if.).
For detailed expositions on the subject of Athena and her cults, see Farnell, Cults, vol. 1, pp. 184 if.; Nilsson, Geschichte d. Griech. ReI., vol. 1, pp. 433 if.

The Indo-European elements of Aphrodite have been brought out, but exaggeratedly, by K. Tumpel, in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopiidie, s.v.; see also M. Stubbs, "Who Was Aphrodite?" Orpheus (1954), pp. 170 if.
95. Erwin Rohde made the heroes the subject of the fourth chapter of his Psyche (Tiibingen and Leipzig, 1893; 2d ed., 1897); cf. the English translation, Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks (New York, 1925), pp. 115-55. Three years later, in his work Gotternamen: Versuch einer Theorie der religiosen Begriffsbildung (Bonn, 1896), Herman Usener developed the notion of the Sondergotter, especially criticizing H. Spencer's theory of the priority of the ancestor cult (pp. 253 if.) and devoting a single polemic reference to Rohde (p. 248). Paul Foucart followed the general lines of Rohde's interpretation in Le culte des heros chez les Grecs (1918) (Memoires de l'Institut Fran9ais, 1921); so, too, did S. Eitrem, in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopiidie, vol. 8, pt. 1 (1912), s.v. "Heroes," and F. Pfister, Der Reliquienkult im Altertum (Giessen, 1910-12). The "compromise theory" presented by L. R. Farnell, in his Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality (Oxford, 1921), was widely accepted; cf., inter alia, M. P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, 2d ed. (Lund, 1950), pp. 585 if., and Geschichte der Griechische Religion, vol. 1, 2d ed. (Munich, 1955), p. 188. Clear expositions and useful analyses will be found in the works of C. Robert, Die Griechische Heldensage, 2 vols. (Berlin, 1921-26); L. Rademacher, Mythos und Sage bei den Griechen (Munich, 1938); Marie Delcourt, Legendes et eultes des heros en Greee (Paris, 1942); H. J. Rose, Gods and Heroes of the Greeks (London, 1957); and K. Kerenyi, Greek Heroes (London, 1959). An important contribution, undertaken from the point of view of the general history of religions, was made by Angelo Brelich, Gli eroi greei: Un problema storieo-religioso (Rome, 1958). After alluding to the earlier interpretations, from Rohde to Nilsson, the author presents the role of the heroes in myth and cult (the hero and death, the hero and athletic contests,

prophecy, initiations, etc.) and examines their relations with other mythical beings in order finally to isolate the specific structure of the Greek hero. To the three categories of beings distinguished by Pindar (gods, heroes, men), Plato added a fourth, that of demons (Cratylus 397c ff.). On puberty initiations in archaic Greece, see H. Jeanmaire, Courof et Couretes (Lille, 1939); Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 108 ff.; Brelich, Gli eroi greci, pp. 124 ff.; Brelich, Paides e Parthenoi (Rome, 1969), vol. 1. The difference between sacrifices performed for the Olympians, on the one hand, and for the chthonic gods and the heroes, on the other-a difference which Rohde emphasized (Psyche, Eng. trans., p. 116 ff.)-was also noted by Jane Harrison, Meuli, C. Picard, and Guthrie. Picard also referred to the difference in the ritual gestures: the hand was raised, palm toward the sky, for the Olympians; it was lowered, palm toward the ground, to invoke the powers of the soil (Picard, "Le geste de la priere funeraire en Gn!ce et en Etrurie," RHR [1936]: 137 ff.). However, A. D. Nock (Harvard Theological Review 37 [1944]: 141 ff.) and W. Burkert (Homo Necans [Berlin, 1972], pp. 16 ff. and note 41) have pointed out that this difference is not always documented; see also Brelich, Gli eroi greci, pp. 16-18.
96. The Greek term, used chiefly in the plural, ta mysteria, probably derives from an Indo-European root MU, the original meaning of which, "to shut the mouth," refers to "ritual silence." Cf. Gk. myo and myeo, "initiate into the Mystery," and myesis, "initiation" (a term used only of initiations into Mysteries). For the literary sources, see L. R.

Delatte, Charles Picard, et aI., cited below. Following the opinion of Herodotus (2.49 fT., 146), Paul Foucart affirmed the Egyptian origin of the E1eusinian Mysteries. But Charles Picard observes that "nowhere as yet has any Egyptian object datable from the second half of the second millennium appeared, even isolatedly, in the hieron" (" Sur la patrie et les peregrinations de Demeter," REG 40 [1927]: 321-30, esp. 325). Axel Persson ("Der Ursprung der eleusinischen Mysterien," ARW 21 [1922]: 287-309), and Charles Picard (Les religions prehel/eniques [Paris, 1948], pp. 89, Ill, 114 fT.) have suggested a Cretan origin for the Mysteries. However, recent excavations have invalidated the hypothesis of Cretan or Minoan influence on the buildings at Eleusis (see Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 16 fT.; cf. ibid., pp. 49, 68, etc.). M. P. Nilsson has attempted to establish the Mycenaean origins of the mythico-ritual complex of Eleusis (Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 558 fT.; see also Opuscula Selecta, vol. 2, pp. 585 fT.). Mylonas points out that the traditions indicate, rather, a northern origin for the cult (Eleusis, pp. 19 fT.)-Thessaly or

Thrace. According to Pausanias 1. 38. 2-3, Eumolpus, the first hierophant and founder of the family of the Eumolpids, was supposed to be a native of Thrace.However, the name Eumolpus is pre-Hellenic (Nilsson, MinoanMycen. Rei., pp. 520 if.). In any case, whatever their origin, it is certain that the Mysteries are pre-Hellenic and that they continue a cult whose structure is archaic. From a second family, the Kerykes, the other officiants descended: the dadouchos, "bearer of the torch," the hierokeryx, "herald of the ceremonies," and the priest who officiated at the altar. Until the destruction of Eleusis by Alaric in 396, the hierophants and other officiants were all descended from these two families. As for the "genesis" of the Mysteries, the majority of scholars have sought it in a mythico-ritual scenario bound up with agriculture. For Nilsson, Demeter is the Corn Mother, and Kore the Corn Maiden: they symbolize the old and new crops. Hence the reunion of the two goddesses would finally represent the meeting of the two crops (Greek Popular Religion, pp. 51 if.). Nilsson states that, at Eleusis, "there were no doctrines, but only some simple, fundamental ideas about life and death as symbolized in the springing up of the new crop from the old" (ibid., p. 63). A similar explanation had already been put forward by R. M. Cornford in "The aparchai and the Eleusinian Mysteries," in Essays and Studies presented to William Ridgeway (Cambridge, 1913), pp. 153-66. We have criticized elsewhere, and precisely in discussing Nilsson's Greek Popular Religion, the inadequacy of such "genetic" pseudo-explanations of religious phenomena: see Eliade, "Mythologie et Histoire des religions," Diogene (January 1955): 108 if. The relations of the Eleusinian Mysteries to agriculture are also analyzed by R. Pettazzoni in I Misteri (Bologna, 1924), pp. 45 if., and La religion dans la Grece antique (Paris, 1953), pp. 73 if. On the myths and rites of the pomegranate in the Mediterranean world, see Uberto Pestalozza "Iside e la Melagrana," in his Religione Mediterranea (Milan, 1951), pp. 1-70, and Ileana Chirassi, Elementi di cultura precereali nei miti e riti greci (Rome, 1968), pp. 73-90.

According to what has been called the Orphic version of the myth of Demeter (see Malten, "Altorphische Demetersagen," ARW 5 [1909]: 417 if.), there lived at Eleusis a poor peasant, Dysaules, and his wife Baubo; they had only a wretched hovel, for wheat had not yet been revealed by Demeter. According to the Attic tradition, Triptolemus was the son of Dysaules (Pausanias, 1. 14.3). Another son, Eubuleus, was a swineherd, and his swine were swallowed up at the same time as Persephone. One Orphic hymn (41. 6) recounts that, when she ended her fast at Eleusis, Demeter went down to Hades following the instructions given her by Eubuleus (see also K. Ken!nyi, Eleusis, pp. 43, 171). The ancients had connected Eleusis with Elysium, the realm of the Blessed (see A. B. Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, pp. 36 if.).
97. Sterling Dow and Robert F. Healey, A Sacred Calendar of Eleusis (Cambridge, 1965), have reconstructed the calendar of ceremonies on the basis of an inscription of about 330 B.C. On the Lesser Mysteries, see P. Roussel, "L'initiation prealable et Ie symbole Eleusinien," Bulletin de correspondance helMnique 54 (1930): 5174; Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 239-43. The sacrifice of pigs was characteristic of the cult of Demeter everywhere in Greece; see, most recently, W. Burkert, Homo Necans, pp. 284 if. On the other hand, such sacrifices on the occasion of initiation ceremonies are fully documented among the cultivators of the Polynesian islands. Burkert (p. 286) points out that the Greek for "piglet" (choiros) meant, in vulgar parlance, the female sexual organ. Symbolically, the sacrifice of a young pig represented killing a girl. On the gephyrismoi, see E. de Martino, "Gephyrismi," SMSR 10 (1934): 64-79. On kykeon, see A. Delatte, "Le cyceon, breuvage rituel des mysteres d'Eleusis," Bull. Classe des Lettres, Acad. Royale de Belgique, 5th ser. 40 (1954): 690-752. A large number of texts, of unequal value, referring to the initiations, are cited and translated by V. Magnien, Les Mysteres d'Eleusis, pp. 198 if. (to be consulted with caution). On the rituals, see Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 243-85; Dario Sabbatucci, Saggio sui misticismo greco (Rome, 1965), pp. 127 ff.

Eleusis unique among Greek cults. The Olympian sacrifice was not performed in the temples but on altars, and these could be erected anywhere, as well in houses as in streets and fields. On the cosmic and ritual meaning of the two vessels (plemochoai), filled with water and overturned by the initiate while he repeated a formula (perhaps the famous formula of which Proclus speaks in Ad Timaeum 293c), see Edward L. Ochsenschlager, "The Cosmic Significance of the plemochoe," HR 9 (1970): 316-37. As for the revealing of secrets (see § 97, note 3), antiquity knew a few other examples. A rhetorical exercise that has come down to us under the name of Sopater presents the case of a young man who dreamed that he was initiated; he contemplated the dr6mena, or "things done," but, since he did not hear the words spoken by the hierophant, he could not be considered an initiate. Andocides, on the other hand, was accused because he showed the hiera to noninitiates and repeated the words that must not be uttered (references in Mylonas, Eleusis, p. 272, nn. 194, 195). Alcibiades parodied the secret ceremonies and had to go into exile; some of his accomplices who were caught suffered the death penalty (Xenophon, Hellenica 1. 4. 14; etc.).
98. Synesius has preserved a short fragment from a youthful work by Aristotle concerning initiation into the Mysteries: "Aristotle is of the opinion that those who are initiated are not expected to learn something but to experience emotions and be put in certain dispositions, obviously after becoming open to receive them" (Dio, ed. Krabinger, vol. 1, pp. 271-72 = Aristotle, frag. 15 Rose; after the translation by Jeanne Croissant, Aristote et les Mysteres [Paris, 1932], p. 137). A parallel text, transmitted by Psellus and published by J. Bidez, Catalogue des manuscrits alchimiques grecs (1928), vol. 6, p. 171, has been fully analyzed by Croissant, pp. 145 ff. On the passage from Themistius, see, most recently, Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 264 ff. There is an excellent analysis of the late sources by Farnell in his Cults, vol. 3, pp. 176 ff. On the synthema, or password, transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, see U. Pestalozza, Religione Mediterranea: Vecchi e nuovi studi (Milan, 1951), pp. 216-34 (" Ortaggi, frutti e paste nei Misteri Eleusini "); Mylonas, Eleusis, pp. 294-303; W. Burkert, Homo Necans, pp. 298 ff. The identification of the objects hidden in the chest and the basket has given rise to a long controversy, which still continues. A. Korte held that the basket contained the replica of a womb (kteis); touching it, the mystes believed that he was reborn as a child of Demeter (ARW [1915]: 116 ff.). O. Kern went still further: the mystes united himself with the goddess by



Critical Bibliographies 463
touching the kteis with his sexual organ (Die griechische Mysterien der classischen Zeit [1927], p. 10). For A. Dieterich, on the contrary, it was a phallus that the mystes found in the basket: by placing it on his chest, he was united with the goddess and became her child (Eine Mythrasliturgie [1903], p. 123; Mutter Erde, 3d ed. [1925], pp. 1l0ff.). According to Charles Picard, the basket contained a phallus and the chest a womb: by manipulating them, the mystes achieved union with the goddesses ("L' episode de BaubO," RHR 95 [1927]: pp. 237 ff.). S. Eitrem proposes a snake, a pomegranate, and cakes in the shape of a phallus and a womb (" Eleusinia," pp. 140 ff.). Such explanations have been rejected by many scholars: Maas, Farnell, Roussel, Deubner, Otto, Kerenyi, and others (see also Mylonas, Eleusis, p. 296, n. 22). But it was worthwhile to mention these exercises in historico-religious exegesis: they contribute to an understanding of the Western Zeitgeist during the first third of the twentieth century. As to the various data on initiation into the Mysteries reported by the Church Fathers, it is certain that they show a definite purpose: to attack and discredit paganism. However, the Fathers did not dare to invent, for they risked being triumphantly contradicted by pagan authors. But it must also be borne in mind that they were writing during the full tide of religious syncretism and that they referred primarily to the Hellenistic Mysteries. Indeed, just as numerous Neo-Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean authors proclaimed the unity of all the Mysteries, Christian authors, adopting their point of view, regarded as Eleusinian rituals that belonged to more recent Mysteries. In addition, these apologetes likewise shared the Hellenistic fashion for explanation by analogy, which makes their testimony still more dubious. Fire and cremation at Eleusis. It is probable that certain mystai were incinerated on the terrace on which the temple stood, between 1110 and 700 B.C. (Kerenyi, Eleusis, p. 93). On the other hand, we know the history of a Brahman, Zarmaros or Zarmanochegos, who, in 20 B.C., when Augustus was at Eleusis again, demanded to be initiated, and, after being present at the epopteia, entered the fire and was consumed (Dio Cassius, 54.9.10; Strabo, 15.1. 73; cf. Kerenyi, p. 100). May we read in these ritual cremations a memory of the" divinization" of Demophoon by fire? See also Marie DeIcourt, Pyrrhos et Pyrrha (Paris, 1965), pp. 68 ff.

464 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
In the first century B.C., Diodorus Siculus (5. 73. 3) reported the following tradition: the inhabitants of Crete affirm that the Mysteries were disseminated from their island, giving as proof the fact that the secrets imparted in the Eleusinian initiations, in the Mysteries of Samothrace, and in the cult founded by Orpheus were, in Crete, freely shared by all who wanted to know them. Insofar as Diodorus' information is correct, it probably refers to the rites, and especially to the mythologem, illustrative of the relations between the cycle of agriculture (disappearance of the seed underground, followed by appearance of the new harvest) and the rape of Persephone and her reunion with Demeter. The role of Dionysus in the Mysteries is the subject of controversy. In the fourth century, Dionysus was identified with Iacchus, personification of the shout given (Herodotus, 8. 65) or of the hymn sung (scholiast on Aristophanes, Frogs 309) during the procession to Eleusis. According to Farnell, Sophocles (Antigone 1119-21, 1146--52) teaches that Iacchus is Dionysus in his Eleusinian hypostasis (Cults, vol. 3, p. 149). But Dionysus does not appear to have figured among the deities venerated in the Mysteries (Mylonas, Eleusis, p. 238). His presence at Eleusis is a consequence of syncretism, a movement that will become more accentuated in the Hellenistic period.
100. The history of studies in the field of the Iranian religions has been admirably presented by J. Duchesne-Guillemin, The Western Response to Zoroaster (Oxford, 1958). See also G. Widengren, "Stand und Aufgaben der iranischen Religionsgeschichte," Numen I (1954): 16-83; 2 (1955): 47-134, and Gherardo Gnoli, who, in "Problems and Prospects of the Studies on Persian Religion" (in Problems and Methods of the History of Religions, edited by U. Bianchi, C. J. Bleeker, and A. Bausani [Leiden, 1972], pp. 67-101), refers especially to works published after 1940. Still useful for their rich documentation are J. H. Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism (London, 1913), A. V. William Jackson, Zoroastrian Studies (New York, 1928), especially "The Iranian Religion" (pp. 3-215), and, above all, L. H. Gray, The Foundations of Iranian Religions (Bombay, 1929) (repertory of facts). New orientations in the interpretation of the Iranian religions begin to appear with the following: the little book by E.

Ahriman: L'aventure dualiste dans l'antiquite (Paris, 1953). Four works of synthesis have recently appeared: R. C. Zaehner, The Dawn and Twilight ojZoroastrianism (London, 1961) (see the critique by Duchesne-Guillemin, IIJ 7 [1964]: 196-207); J. Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien (Paris, 1962) (Eng. trans., Religion oj Ancient Iran [Bombay]); Marjan Mole, Cuite, mythe et cosmologie dans l'Iran ancien (Paris, 1963); and G. Widengren, Die Religionen Irans (Stuttgart, 1965); French trans., Les religions de L'Iran (Paris, 1968). Duchesne-Guillemin's and Widengren's volumes contain excellent bibliographies. Mole's daring interpretation has given rise to controversies, but the book is valuable for the great number of texts translated. Supplementary bibliographical references will be found further on, in connection with particular subjects. Also see, now, Mary Boyce, A History ojZoroastrianism, vol. 1: The Early Period (Leiden and Cologne, 1975). As for the texts: three-fourths of the Avesta is believed to be lost. See the summary of the extant sections in Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien, pp. 32-40 (Eng. trans., pp. 22-29) (see ibid., pp. 40-50 [Eng. trans., pp. 29-36], for a very elaborate exposition of the constitution of the Avesta). The only complete translation of the Avestan text is that by J. Darmsteter, Le Zend-Avesta, 3 vols. (Paris, 1892-93; reprinted 1960). But "it is unusable for the giithiis" (Duchesne-Guillemin). Among the more recent translations of the giithiis (after that by C. Bartholomae, Die Giithiis des Awesta [Strasbourg, 1905], which remains indispensable), we mention Duchesne-Guillemin, Zoroastre, pp. 166-296 (it is this translation that is followed in the text) (this portion of the book has been translated into English by M. Henning in The Hymns ojZarathustra [London, 1952]); and H. Humbach, Die Giithiis des Zarathustra, 2 vols. (Heidelberg, 1959), with paraphrase and notes. See also Bernfried Schlerath, "Die Glithiis des Zarathustra," Orientalistische Literatur-Zeitung 57 (1962), cols. 565-89; a critical review of recent exegeses, partially reproduced in B. Schlerath, ed., Zarathustra (Darmstadt, 1970), pp. 336-59; and Wolfgang Lentz, Yasna 28: Kommentierte Uebersetzung und Komposition-Anaiyse (Mainz, 1955). On the Yasts and Pahlavi literature, see further on.
W. B. Henning, Zoroaster, Politician or Witch-Doctor? (Oxford, 1951), vigorously criticized the work by the archeologist E. Herzfeld, Zoroaster and His World (Princeton, 1947), and the book by H. S. Nyberg. (In the preface to the new edition of Rei. d. alten Iran, Nyberg replies to Henning's criticisms and defines his position.) The traditional chronology of Zarathustra has been rejected by Mole, Culte, mythe, et cosmologie, pp. 530 if., and by Gherardo Gnoli, most recently in "Politica religiosa e concezione della regalita sotto i Sassanidi," in La Persia nel Medioevo (Rome, 1971), pp. 1-27, esp. pp. 9 if.

bibliography of the problem will be found in the article by O. Klima, "The Date of Zoroaster," Ar. Or. 27 (1959): 556-644. On the Aryan" men's societies," see Stig Wikander, Der arische. Mannerbund (Lund, 1938), and G. Widengren, Rei. de ['Iran, pp. 39 if. (with recent bibliography). Widengren's book contains a synthetic exposition of pre-Zoroastrian ideas and beliefs (pp. 23-78).
101. On the transformation of a historical personage into an archetype, see the examples cited and commented upon in Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 37 if. The elaboration of the legend of Zarathustra has been presented by Duchesne-Guillemin in La religion, pp. 337 if. (Eng. trans., pp. 226 if.). In his work Culfe, mythe et cosmologie, Marjan Mole attempts to reconstruct the image of Zarathustra in the nongathic Avesta. "He is praised above all for having oifered correct sacrifices, for having uttered certain efficacious formulas, for having transmitted them to men, who from then on know how to protect cattle, water, and plants: not for having taught a new doctrine. This image suggests that of an Orpheus or a
Zalmoxis rather than that of a Semitic prophet" (Mole, "Reponse a M. Duchesne-Guillemin," Numen [1961]: 53). Mole recognizes that he can say nothing concerning the historicity of Zarathustra (ibid., pp. 53 if.; cf. Culte, mythe et cosmologie, pp. 530 if.). In the entire Mazdean tradition, Zarathustra is the prototype of the priest, while Vishtaspa is the prototype of the initiate. However, none of this excludes the historicity of the personage known by the name of Zarathustra. Gherardo Gnoli holds a similar position: the doctrine transmitted in the giithiis under the name of Zarathustra comprises only one aspect of Mazdaism, particularly its esoteric aspect, that is, the sacerdotal and initiatory tradition reserved for religious elites. In contrast, the Mazdaism practiced by the Achaemenids represents the public cult, celebrated for the state and the sovereign. See Gnoli, "Politica religiosa," pp. 17 if., and his "La Religione persiana," in Storia delle Religioni,15th ed. (Turin, 1971), pp. 235-92, esp. 247 if. A suggestive analysis of Zarathustra's religious vocation has been given by K. Rudolph, "Zarathustra-Priester und Prophet," Numen 8 (1961): 81-116.
102. H. S. Nyberg was the first to insist on the" shamanic" ecstasy of Zarathustra; see his Die Religionen des alten Irans, pp. 177 if. G. Widengren returned to the analysis of shamanic elements in Zoroastrianism in Stand und Aufgaben, pp. 90 if., and Les religions de l'Iran, pp. 88 if. See also Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 397-401. An excellent analysis and a con

sidered interpretation of ecstatic elements in Zarathustra has been provided by Alessandro Bausani, Persia religiosa (Milan, 1959), pp. 38 ff.
103. Georges Dumezil has identified in the Amesha Spentas sublimated substitutes for the Indo-Iranian functional gods; see his Naissance d'archanges (Paris, 1945), chaps. 2-4; Tarpeia (1947), pp. 33-113; and Ideologie tripartie des Indo-Europeens (Brussels, 1958), pp. 40 ff. See also Duchesne-Guillemin, La rei. de l'Iran ancien, pp. 171 ff., 193 ff. (Eng. trans., pp. 135 ff., 148 ff.); G. Widengren, Les religions de /'Iran, pp. 28 ff. Zaehner and Gnoli are among the Iranianists who reject Dumezil's hypothesis. On Ahura Mazda, see the relevant chapters in the works by DuchesneGuillemin, Widengren, Zaehner, Mole, et al. F. B. J. Kuiper, "Avestan Mazda," IIJ 1 (1957): 86-95, has shown that the meaning of the name is "intelligent, informed Lord" (" he who knows "). See also I. Gershevitch, "Zoroaster's Own Contribution," JNES 23 (1964): 12-38. On the creation, see G. Gnoli, "Osservazioni sulla dottrina mazdaica della creazione," Annali dell'Istituto Orientale di Napoli n.s. 13 (1963): 163-93. Antoine Meillet has emphasized the social character of the Zoroastrian reform (contrast between the agriculturalist and the nomad, opposition of the warrior aristocrats to the cultivators); see Trois conferences sur les Gathas de l'Avesta (Paris, 1925).
On the celebrated "Complaint of the Soul of the Ox" (Yasna 29), see G. DumeziI's article in Bulletin de l'Academie royale de Belgique, Classe des Lettres, 1 (1965): 23-51. The author (pp. 33 ff.) rejects the interpretations proposed by some scholars (H. Lommel, M. Mole) according to which this" Complaint" would be bound up with a cosmogonic myth involving the immolation of a primordial ox. In fact, the subject is "the condition of bovines and the dangers perennially threatening them in societies still not fully settled, where, with their herder-and-farmer masters, they are exposed to the cruelties of other groups of men" (p. 36). On the "crime of Yima" (flesh food), see Dumezil, Mythe et Epopee (1971), vol. 2, pp. 312 ff. (Eng. trans., The Destiny of a King, pp. 67 ff.).
As to the cult of haoma, it is probable that Zarathustra's attack (Yasna 33. 44) is aimed rather at orgiastic excesses than at the sacrifice in itself. On haoma in the gathic and postgathic Avesta, see Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism, pp. 85 ff.; Mole, Culte, mythe, et cosmologie, pp. 229 ff.; G. Gnoli, "Licht-Symbolik in Alt-Iran: Haoma Ritus und ErI6ser-Mythos," Antaios 8 (1967): 528-49; Gnoli, "Problems and Prospects," pp. 74 ff., with a recent bibliography; M. Boyce, "Haoma,

On the "philosophical" character of Zarathustra's message, see A. Pagliaro, "L'idealismo zarathustriano," SMSR 33 (1962): 3-23. On the texts that describe the fire ritual, see Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion, pp. 79 if. (Eng. trans., pp. 61 if.); see also Stig Wikander, Feuerpriester in Kleinasien und Iran (Lund, 1967). There are classifications into two, three, or five sacred fires; the last distinguishes the fire that shines before the Lord, the fires that are found in the bodies of men and animals, in plants and clouds, and finally the fire that is used for work. The Chiindogya Upani~ad also distinguishes three sacrificial fires and five natural fires; see Duchesne-Guillemin, "Heraclitus and Iran," HR 3 (1963): 34-49, esp. 38-39. Gherardo Gnoli has presented his interpretation of the sacrifice (yasna) in several works: "Lo stato di 'maga,'" Annali dell'Istituto Orientale di Napoli n.s. 15 (1965): 105-17; "La gnosi iranica: Per una impostazione nuova del problema," in Le Origine dello Gnosticismo, ed.

recently, Gnoli, "Problems and Prospects of the Studies on Persian Religion," pp. 75 if. On Iranian religious dualism, see Ugo Bianchi, Zaman i Ohrmazd (Turin, 1958). According to this author, "total dualism" must not be regarded as posterior to Zarathustra (p. 25). On the relations between the religion of the Achaemenids and Zoroastrianism, see the history of the controversy in Duchesne-Guillemin, The Western Response to Zoroaster, pp. 52 if., and La Religion de l'Iran antique, pp. 165 if. (Eng. trans., pp. 119 if.). The Zoroastrianism of the Achaemenids is admitted by, among others, Kaj Barr, G. Cameron, Ilya Gershevitch. See the critique of this position in Widengren, Les religions de "Iran, pp. 166-74. Marjan Mole eliminates the problem of the Zoroastrianism of the Achaemenids; for him all the forms of Iranian religion coexisted in time (see his Culte, mythe et cosmologie, esp. pp. 26-36). Cf. G. Gnoli, "Considerazioni sulla re1igione degli Achemenidi ana luce di una recente teoria," SMSR 35 (1964): 239 if. For criticism of the" Zoroastrian calendar," see E. Bickerman, "The' Zoroastrian' Calendar," Ar Or 35 (1967): 197-207. The best edition of the Achaemenian inscriptions, accompanied by a translation, is that by R. G. Kent, Old Persian: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon, 2d ed. (New Haven, 1953). A new inscription of Xerxes I, discovered in 1967 near Persepolis, has been translated, with a commentary, by Manfred Mayrhofer, "Xerxes Konig der Konige," Almanach der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 119 (1969): 158-70.

Mesopotamian influences on the Iranian concept of royalty, pointed out by Widengren and other scholars, are also brought up by Gnoli in Ex Orbe Religionum, Studia Geo Widengren oblata (Leiden, 1972), vol. 2, pp. 94 if.

According to the opinion accepted by a number of scholars, the Magi were originally a sacerdotal caste of the Medes. After their" conversion" to Mazdaism, they emigrated to the western part of the Empire. According to Widengren (p. 136), the treatise Videvdiit (= Vendidad) reflects the ideas, beliefs, and ritual views of the Magi. The same author (pp. 175 if.) holds that Zurvan (see volume 2) was a divinity worshiped by the Magi. For a new presentation of the protohistory of the Scythians, see S. P. Tolstov, "Les Scythes de l'Aral et Ie Khorezm," Iranica Antiqua 1 (1961): 42-92.

Kuiper, "Remarks on the Avestan Hymn to Mithra," III 5 (1961): 36-60, and Ugo Bianchi, "La stella Sirio e l'influenza dell'astrologia caldea nell' Iran antico," SMSR 34 (1963): 237 if.

111. The sources used in §§ III and 112 are for the most part composed in Pahlavi. It would serve no purpose to dwell on the still unsolved problems of the chronology. The reader will find a clear exposition in the book by Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de ['Iran ancien, pp. 40 if. (Eng. trans., pp. 21 if.). A nearly complete translation of the Pahlavi books was published by E. W. West, Pahlavi Texts, vols. 5, 18, 24, 37, and 47 of Sacred Books of the East (Oxford, 1888-97). The translation is outdated, but there are more recent translations of the Bundahisn, of some parts of the Denkart, and of other Pahlavi books; see Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight, p. 342, and especially Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion, pp. 52-63 (Eng. trans., pp. 40--49), which gives a summary of each work and notes the editions and the fragments translated. See also the bibliography drawn up by Colpe, "Altiran: Einleitung," in WdM 12 (1974): 197 if. Beliefs concerning postexistence have been analyzed by Nathan Soderblom, La vie future d'apres Ie mazdeisme (Paris, 1901), and J. D. C. Pavry, The Zoroastrian Doctrine of a Future Life (New York, 1926); see a recent restatement in Widengren, Les religions de ['Iran, pp. 52 if., 124 if., 192 if. The study by W. Bousset, "Die Himmelsreise der Seele," ARW 4 (191O): 136-69, 229-73 (reprinted, 1960), remains indispensable. The Hiidoxt Nask has been several times translated and commented upon since Soderblom (see his La vie future, pp. 82-88). See, inter alia, Karl F.

ancient text, whose language is close to that of the giithiis; see also his" Les origines du gnosticisme et l'histoire des religions," in Le Origini dello gnosticismo, ed. Ugo Bianchi (Leiden, 1964), pp. 28-60, esp. 49 ff., and Les religions de l'Iran, pp. 124 if.; also L. H. Gray, "A Suggested Restoration of the Hadoxt Nask," JAOS 67 (1947): 14-23. The interpretation of the diienii has occasioned controversies; see Gnoli, "Questioni sull'interpretazione," pp. 361 ff. The term, which ended by designating "religion," probably derives from the root diiy-, "to see," and is to be compared to the Vedic dhih, "vision"; see Humbach, Die Giithiis des Zarathustra, vol. 1, pp. 56-58; J. Gonda, The Vision of the Vedic Poets (The Hague, 1963), pp. 259-65. The original meaning is bound up with Indo-Iranian concepts of inner vision; see Gnoli, "Questioni," p. 363. In its individual sense, the diienii is regarded as a faculty at once human and divine (personified in the paredros of Ahura Mazda); the collective meaning indicates the sum of all the individual diieniis, that is, those of the faithful who share the same doctrines and practice the same rites, a spiritual" collective being," the" Mazdean religion" or "church," in the sense of a community of the faithful; see Gnoli, p. 365. On the initiatory symbolism of the Cinvat Bridge and the meaning of the diienii, see H. Corbin, Terre celeste et Corps de Resurrection (Paris, 1960), pp. 68 if.; M. Mole, "Diienii, Ie pont Cinvat et l'initiation dans Ie Mazdeisme," RHR 158 (1960): 155-85. On parallels to the Cinvat, see Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 482 ff.

Religions, p. 38. The belief is archaic and universally disseminated; see Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 62 if.
As for the warlike aspect of the fravashis, Dumezil has brought out
certain analogies with the Maruts; see his "Vi~I}.u et les Marut atravers la
reforme zoroastrienne," JA 242 (1953): 1-25, esp. 21 if. But the fravashis are also the celestial "double" of the men of the past, the present, and the future (Yasna 24. 5); according to some sources (cf. Yast 13. 82-84), the Amesha Spentas also have theirfravashis. In a passage of the Videvdiit (l9. 46-48), Zarathustra learns to evoke the fravashi of Ahura Mazda. This is a daring and enigmatic conception; but, as Bausani observes (La Persia religiosa, p. 68), the idea has not been explored.

Blank, Prophetic Faith in Isaiah (1958). Micah of Moresheth, a younger contemporary of Isaiah, probably preached between 725 and 711. His eight discourses occur in the first three chapters of his book. Certain passages (1 :16; 2:4-5,10,12-14), as well as other sections, are postexilic additions. Micah is not concerned with international policy but attacks the social iniquities and moral depravity of Judah. Punishment will not be long in coming. The country will be devastated (5:10; 6: 16), and "Zion will become ploughland, Jerusalem a heap of rubble, and the mountain of the Temple a wooded height" (3:12). In the postexilic additions there is a Messianic pericope. Out of Bethlehem

will be born "the one who is to rule over Israel"; then Assyria will be conquered, and the king" will extend his power to the ends of the land. He himself will be peace" (5 :1-5). See Fohrer, History, p. 257, n. 20, for bibliography on Micah. In the last third of the seventh century three "minor prophets" carryon their ministry: Zephaniah, Habakkuk, and Nahum. The first deserves attention for the vigor with which he announces the imminence of the "day of Yahweh": "The great day of Yahweh is near....

The history of the interpretations of Dionysus is the subject of a still unpublished doctoral dissertation by Park McGinty, "Approaches to Dionysos: A Study of the Methodological Presuppositions in the Various Theories of Greek Religion as Illustrated in the Study of Dionysos" (University of Chicago, December 1972). McGinty discusses the interpretations of Friedrich Nietzsche (Die Geburt der Tragodie, 1871; Eng. trans. by Walter Kaufman, The Birth of Tragedy [New York, 1967]); Erwin Rohde (Psyche, 1894; Eng. trans., New York, 1925); Jane Harrison (Prolegomena, 1901 ; Themis, 1912); Martin P.

Critical Bibliographies 477
French there is the admirable work by H. Jeanmaire, Dionysos: Histoire du culte de Bacchus (Paris, 1951), with a rich bibliography (pp. 483-504). On the etymology of Semele, see P. Kretschmer, Aus der Anomia (1890), pp. 17 ff. Kretschmer connected the Thraco-Phrygian vocable Semelo, documented in Phrygian funerary inscriptions from the imperial period and designating the Earth Goddess, with Slavic zemljia, "earth," and Zemnya, the Lithuanian name of the chthonian goddess. This etymology has been accepted by Nilsson (Min.-Mycenaean ReI., p. 567) and Wilamowitz (Der Glaube der Hellenen, vol. 2, p. 60) but is rejected, among others, by Otto (Dionysos, pp. 69 ff.). For a century scholars attempted to explain the "persecution" of Dionysus by the history of the penetration of his cult into Greece; implicitly, the god was considered a "foreigner," come from Thrace (e.g., Rohde) or from Phrygia (e.g., Nilsson). Since the discovery of his name in the Mycenaean inscriptions, a number of authors have defended the Cretan origin of Dionysus; see Karl Ken!nyi, "Die Herkunft der Dionysosreligion nach dem heutigen Stand der Forschung," in Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Forschung des Landes Nordrhein Westfalen (Cologne, 1956), pp. 5 ff.; Kerenyi, Der Fruhe Dionysos (1960). Cf. the remarks by Pestalozza, "Motivi matriarcali in Etolia ed Epiro," Rendiconti 1st. Lomb. di Scienze e Lettere 87 (Milan, 1957): 583-622; republished in Nuovi saggi di religione mediterranea [Florence, 1964], pp. 257-95, esp. 272-73, n. 3. See also T. B. L.

Deubner, Attische Feste (Berlin, 1932), pp. 125 ff. On the Anthesteria, see Jeanmaire, pp. 48-56 and 486 (bibliography).

showing that these are rites and customs documented everywhere in Greece, before and after Euripides; see his "Maenadism in the Bacchae," Harvard Theological Review 33 (1940): 155-76. Jeanmaire has pursued the inquiry beyond Greece in his Dionysos, pp. 119 ff. (the zar and the buri in North Africa, Arabia, and Abyssinia). In Greece, examples of mania brought on by other gods are known; see Jeanmaire, pp. 109 ff. Farnell (Cults, vol. 5, pp. 167-71) has brought together the references to human sacrifices and ritual cannibalism. On Corybantism, see Jeanmaire, pp. 123 ff., and the comparative study by Ernesto de Martino, La Terra del rimorso (Milan, 1961), pp. 220 ff. For a ritual interpretation of the episode of Pentheus, see Clara Gallini, "II travestismo rituale di Penteo," SMSR 34 (1967): 211 ff. The rites of tearing in pieces (sparagmos) and consuming raw flesh (omophagia) characterize the Muslim sect of the Aissawa ('Isawiyya); see R. Eissler, "Nachleben dionysischen Mysterienritus," ARW (1928): 17283, who was the first to use the book by Rene BruneI, Essai sur la confrerie religieuse des Aissiioua au Maroc (Paris, 1926); cf. also Eisler, Man into Wolf (London, 1951), pp. 112 ff.; Jeanmaire, Dionysos, pp. 259 ff. On the survival of the bull sacrifice in Thrace, see C. A. Romaios, Cultes populaires de la Thrace (Athens, 1949), pp. 50 ff. .
125. We shall return in volume 2 to the Dionysiac Mystery, in the chapter devoted to the religions of the Hellenistic period, and certain meanings of the myth of the dismemberment of the infant Dionysus-Zagreus will be discussed in the chapter on Orphism. On the playthings with which the Titans attracted the infant DionysusZagreus, see Jane Harrison, Themis, pp. 61 ff.; R. Pettazzoni, I Misteri (Bologna, 1924), pp. 19 ff.; Jeanmaire, Dionysos, p. 383 (on the papyrus from Faiyum). It is important to point out that certain details of this episode reflect archaic ideas and beliefs. One of the playthings in particular, the bull-roarer, is used in the puberty rites of primitives (see Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 22 ff.; O. Zerries, Das Schwirrholz [Stuttgart, 1942], pp. 84 ff., 188 ff.), and the practice of covering the face with chalk or gypsum (Harrison, Prolegomena, pp. 491 ff.; Pettazzoni, La religion dans fa Grece antique, pp. 120 ff.) is documented in many primitive secret societies. Walter Otto (Dionysos, pp. 191 ff.) has shown that some of the data contained in comparatively late works derive from older sources. On the" problem" attributed to Aristotle, see L. Moulinier, Orphee et
l'orphisme al'epoque classique (Paris, 1955), pp. 51 ff.
The Mysteries of Dionysus have given rise to a lengthy controversy. We shall return to this problem in the second volume of the present work. See,

Preface
This English rendering was prepared by Willard R. Trask, an outstanding translator and close friend. Over the years, his exceptional skills have provided clear and careful versions of my works for an English readership. Unfortunately, Mr. Trask died before the manuscript could be sent to press. For corrections and improvements in this English edition I am indebted to my former student, now colleague, Professor Lawrence E. Sullivan of the University of Chicago. Throughout the entire process he labored long to take care of queries and solve problems in the text. For guiding the work to its completion, I offer him sincere thanks.






A HISTORY
OF RELIGIOUS
IDEAS






16 The Religions of
Ancient China
126. Religious beliefs in the Neolithic period
For the historian of culture as well as for the historian ofreligions, China represents an unusually advantageous field of research. The earliest Chinese archeological documents, for example, go back to the sixth and fifth millenniums, and in at least some cases it is possible to follow the continuity of the different prehistoric cultures and even to define their contribution to the forming of classical Chinese civilization. For, just as the Chinese people arises from many and various ethnic combinations, its culture constitutes a complex and original synthesis in which the contributions of several sources can nevertheless be discovered. The earliest Neolithic culture is that of Yang Shao, so termed from the name of the village in which vessels of painted clay were discovered in 1921. A second Neolithic culture, characterized by a black pottery, was discovered near Lung Shan in 1928. But it was not until after 1950 that, as a result of the numerous excavations made during the preceding thirty years, it became possible to classify all the phases and the general outlines of the Chinese Neolithic cultures. By the help of radiocarbon dating, the chronology was substantially modified. At Pan Po (in Shensi Province) the earliest site belonging to the Yang Shao culture was brought to light; radiocarbon dating indicates ca. 4115 or ca. 4365. In the fifth millennium the site was occupied for 600 years. But Pan Po does not represent the earliest stage ofthe Yang Shao culture. 1 According to Ping-ti Ho, the author of the latest synthetic study of Chinese prehistory, the agriculture practiced in

the sixth millennium was a local discovery, as were the domestication of certain animals, ceramics, and the metallurgy of bronze. 2 Yet, only recently, the development of the Chinese Neolithic cultures and Bronze Age was explained by a dissemination of agriCUlture and metallurgy from several centers in the ancient Near East. It is not our part to take sides in this controversy. It seems indubitable that certain techniques were invented or radically modified in China. It is no less probable that protohistorical China received numerous cultural elements of Western origin, disseminated across Siberia and the Central Asian steppes. The archeological documents can give us information about certain religious beliefs, but it would be wrong to conclude that those beliefs represent all the religious beliefs of the prehistorical populations. Their mythology and theology, the structure and morphology of their rituals, can scarcely be made out solely on the basis of the archeological finds. Thus, for example, the religious documents revealed by the discovery of the Neolithic Yang Shao culture refer almost entirely to ideas and beliefs connected with sacred space, fertility, and death. In the villages the communal building is placed at the center of the site, surrounded by small houses half underground. Not only the orientation of the village but the structure of the house, with its central mud pit and its smokehole, indicates a cosmology shared by many Neolithic and traditional societies (cf. §12). Belief in the survival of the soul is illustrated by the utensils and foodstuffs placed in the graves. Children were buried, close to the houses, in large urns having an opening at the top to permit the soul to go out and return.3 In other words, the funerary urn was the dead person's "house," an idea that found ample expression in the cult of ancestors in the Bronze Age (the Shang period). Certain clay vessels, painted red and decorated with the socalled death pattern, are especially interesting.4 Three icono

Religious beliefs in the Neolithic period 5
graphic motifs-triangle, chessboard, and cowrie-are found only on funerary vessels. But these motifs are bound up with a rather complex symbolism that associates the ideas of sexual union, birth, regeneration, and rebirth. It may be supposed that this decoration indicates the hope of survival and of a rebirth in the other world. A design figuring two fishes and two anthropomorphic figures probably represents a supernatural being or a "specialist in the sacred," a sorcerer or priest.S But its interpretation is still doubtful. The fishes certainly have a symbolism that is at once sexual and connected with the calendar (the fishing season corresponds to a particular period of the yearly cycle). The distribution of the four figures may suggest a cosmological image. According to Ping-ti Ho (pp. 275 ff.), the societies of the Yang Shao period obeyed the laws of matrilineal descent. In contrast, the following period, that of Lung Shan, indicates passage to a patrilineal society, characterized by the predominance of the ancestor cult. Following other scholars, Ho interprets certain stone objects and their reproductions on painted vases as phallic symbols. Like Karlgren, who saw the derivation ofthe pictogram Isu, designating the ancestor, from the drawing of a phallus, Ho sees in the multiplication of phallic emblems the importance attained by the ancestor cult.6 The "death pattern," as we have seen, certainly involves a sexual symbolism. But Carl Hentze explains the various "phallic" objects and designs as representing a "house of the soul"; certain ceramics from Yang Shao represent models of little huts-which are at the same time funerary urns-comparable to the similar documents from European prehistory and to the Mongol hut. These "little houses of the soul," abundantly attested to in the prehistory of China, are the forerunners of the "ancestor tablets" of historical times.7

These two works supply a large number of parallels chosen from cultures historically or morphologically related to the archaic civilization of China.



6 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
In short, the Yang Shao and Lung Shan cultures reveal the beliefs that are typical of other Neolithic civilizations: solidarity among life, fertility, death, and the afterlife and hence the conception of the cosmic cycle, illustrated by the calendar and actualized in the rites; the importance of the ancestors, a source of magico-religious power; and the "mystery" ofthe conjunction of contraries (also proven by the "death pattern"), a belief that in a way anticipated the idea of the unity/totality of cosmic life, which will be the dominating idea in later periods. It is important to add that a great part of the Neolithic heritage was until recent times preserved, with the inevitable changes, in the religious traditions and practices of the Chinese villages.
127. Religion in the Bronze Age: The God of Heaven and the ancestors
We are decidedly better informed about Chinese history from the time ofthe Shang dynasty (ca. 1751-1028). The Shang period corresponds in general to the protohistory and the beginning of the ancient history of China. It is characterized by the metallurgy of bronze, the appearance of urban centers and capital cities, the presence of a military aristocracy, the institution of royalty, and the beginnings of writing. As for the religious life of the period, the documentation is comparatively full. First of all we have a rich iconography, best exemplified by the magnificent bronze ritual vessels. In addition, the royal tombs provide information concerning certain religious practices. But it is especially the countless oracular inscriptions, incised on animal bones or tortoise shells, that are a precious source. 8 Finally, some later works (for example, The Book of Odes), which Karlgren calls "free Chou texts,"9 contain much ancient material. We should add, however, that these sources give us information concerning the
8. These exemplify a method of divination that was quite widely practiced in northern Asia: the question was asked, the bones or shells were heated, and the diviners interpreted the shapes of the resulting cracks. Then the question and answer were inscribed beside the cracks. 9. Bernhard Karlgren, "Legends and Cults in Ancient China," p. 344.



Religion in the Bronze Age 7
beliefs and rituals of the royal clan; as in the Neolithic period, the mythology and theology remain for the most part unknown. The interpretation of these iconographic documents is not always certain. Scholars agree in recognizing a certain analogy with the motifs documented on the painted pottery of Yang ShaolO and, in addition, with the religious symbolism of the following periods. Hentze (Bronzegeriit, pp. 215 ff.) interprets the conjunction of polar symbols as illustrating religious ideas related to the renewal of Time and to spiritual regeneration. No less important is the symbolism of the cicada and of the t' ao-t'ieh mask, which suggests the cycle of births and rebirths, of light and life emerging from darkness and death. No less remarkable is the union of antagonistic images (feathered snake, snake and eagle, etc.), in other words the dialectic of contraries and the coincidentia oppositorum, a central theme for the Taoist philosophers and mystics. The bronze vessels represent urn-houses. II Their form is derived either from ceramics or from prototypes in wood. 12 The admirable animal art revealed by the bronze vessels probably originated in wood engravings.B The oracular inscriptions inform us of a religious conception that was absent (or imperceptible?) in the Neolithic documents, namely, the preeminence of a supreme celestial god, Ti (Lord) or Shang Ti (The Lord on High). Ti commands the cosmic rhythms and natural phenomena (rain, wind, drought, etc.); he grants the king victory and insures the abundance of crops or, on the contrary, brings on disasters and sends sicknesses and death. He is offered two kinds of sacrifices: in the sanctuary of the ancestors and in the open fields. But, as is the case with other archaic celestial gods (see our A History ofReligious Ideas, vol. 1, §§ 14 ff.), his cult shows a certain diminution of religious primacy. Ti is found to be distant and less active than the ancestors of the royal lineage, and he is offered fewer sacrifices. But
10. The salamander, the tiger, the dragon, etc., still in use in the iconography of Chinese popular art, are cosmological symbols that are already documented at the end of the Neolithic. See Hentze, Bronzegeriit ... der Shangzeit, pp. 40 ff., 55 ff., 132 ff., 165 ff. 11. Hentze, Das Haus als We/tort der Seele, pp. 14 ff. and passim. 12.

8 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
he alone is invoked in matters of fecundity (rain) and of war, the sovereign's two chief preoccupations. In any case, Ti's position remains supreme. All the other gods, as well as the royal ancestors, are subordinate to him. Only the king's ancestors are able to intercede with Ti; on the other hand, only the king can communicate with his ancestors, for the king is the "one man."14 The sovereign strengthens his authority with the help of his ancestors; belief in their magico-religious power legitimized the domination of the Shang dynasty. In their tum the ancestors depend on the offerings of cereals, blood, and flesh
that are brought to them. 15 It is futile to suppose, as certain scholars do,16 that, since the ancestor cult was so important for the reigning aristocracy, it was gradually adopted by the other social strata. The cult was already thoroughly implanted, and very popular, in the Neolithic period. As we have just seen (pp. 5ff.), it formed an essential part ofthe religious system (structured around the anthropocosmic cycle) of the earliest cultivators. It is the preeminence of the king, whose first ancestor was supposed to descend from Ti, that gave this immemorial cult a political function. The king offers two series of sacrifices: to the ancestors and to Ti and the other gods. Sometimes the ritual service is extended over 300 or 600 days. The word "sacrifice" designates the "year," since the annual cycle is conceived as a complete service. This confirms the importance of the calendar, which guarantees the normal return of the seasons. In the great royal tombs near Anyang, exploration has revealed, in addition to animal skeletons, numerous human victims, presumably immolated in order to accompany the sovereign into the other world. The choice of victims (companions and servants, dogs, horses) emphasizes the considerable importance of the hunt (rit
14. The expression "J, the one man" (or perhaps, "J, the first man") is documented in the oracular inscriptions; see David N. Keightley, "Shang Theology and the Genesis of Chinese Political Culture," p. 213, n. 6. 15. As Keightley remarks (ibid., pp. 214 ff.), the cult of ancestors emphasized the royal lineage's aspect as the source of religious and political authority. The doctrine of the "Mandate of Heaven," usually considered to be an invention of the Chou dynasty, has deep roots in the theology of the Shang. 16. For example, Ho, Cradle of the East, p. 320.

ual hunt?) for the military aristocracy and royal clan. 17 A number ofquestions preserved by the oracular inscriptions are concerned with the advisability and the chances for success of the king's expeditions. The tombs had the same cosmological symbolism and performed the same function as the urn-houses: they were the houses of the dead. A similar belief could explain human sacrifice offered at the time when buildings were newly begun, especially temples and palaces. The victims' souls insured the durability of the construction; it could be said that the building that was raised served as a "new body" for the victim's soul. 18 But human sacrifice was also practiced for other purposes, about which our information is scanty; it can be supposed that the end sought was the renewal of time or the regeneration of the dynasty. Despite the gaps, we can make out the principal lines of religion in the Shang period. The importance of the celestial god and the ancestor cult is beyond doubt. The complexity of the sacrificial system (bound up with a religious calendar) and of techniques of divination presupposes the existence of a class of "specialists in the sacred"-diviners, priests, or shamans. Finally, the iconography shows us the articulations of a symbolism, at once cosmological and soteriological, that is still inadequately understood but that seems to anticipate the chief religious conceptions of classical China.
128. The exemplary dynasty: The Chou
In ca. 1028 the last Shang king was conquered by the duke of Chou. In a famous proclamation,19 the latter justified his revolt against the king by the order he had received from the Celestial Lord to put an end to a corrupted and odious domination. This

is the first statement of the famous doctrine of the "Heavenly Mandate." The victorious duke became king of the Chou; he inaugurated the longest dynasty in the history of China (ca. 1028-256). For our purpose it would be useless to summarize its
moments of greatness, its crises, and its decadence.2o We need only point to the fact that, despite wars and general insecurity, it is from the eighth to the third centuries before Christ that traditional Chinese civilization flowered and philosophic thought attained its highest point.21 At the beginning of the dynasty the celestial god T'ien (Heaven), or Shang Ti (The Lord on High), shows the characteristics of an anthropomorphic and personal god. He resides in the Great Bear at the center of the heavens. The texts bring out his celestial structure: he sees, observes, and hears everything; he is clairvoyant and omniscient; his decree is infallible. T'ien and Shang Ti are invoked in agreements and contracts. Later the omniscience and all-seeingness of Heaven are celebrated by Confucius and by many other philosophers, moralists, and theologians of all schools. But for these the God of Heaven increasingly loses his religious nature; he becomes the principle of cosmic order, the warrant for moral law. This process of abstraction and rationalization of a supreme god is frequent in the history of religions (cf. Brahman, Zeus, the God of the philosophers during the Hellenistic period, and the God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). But Heaven (T'ien) remains the protector of the dynasty. The king is the "son of T'ien" and the "regent of Shang Ti."22 This
20. The following are some important dates: the period of the Western Chou, which lasted until about 771, was followed by the period of the Eastern Chou (ca. 771-256). From ca. 400 to ca. 200 there were continuous wars; this is the period known as the Warring Kingdoms, which was ended by the unification of China under the Emperor Huang-ti. 21. It was during this period that the "Classic Books" were composed or edited. As Hentze observes (Funde in Alt-China, p. 222), under the Chou we witness a progressive desacralization of writing. The original function of writing-regulating the relations between Heaven and earth, God and mankindis replaced by genealogical and historiographic preoccupations. In the last analysis, writing becomes a means of political propaganda. 22. See Shu Ching, trans. Legge, p. 426. The Chou were believed to be descended from a mythical ancestor, Hou Chi (Prince Millet) celebrated in the

is why, in principle, only the king is fit to offer him sacrifices. He is responsible for the normal progression of the cosmic rhythms; in case of disaster-drought, prodigies, calamities, floods-the king subjects himself to expiatory rites. Since every celestial god rules the seasons, T'ien also has a role in agrarian cults. Thus, the king must represent him during the essential moments of the agrarian cycle (cf. §130). In general, the ancestor cult carries on the structures established during the Shang period (but our information extends only to the rituals practiced by the aristocracy). The urn-house is replaced by a tablet, which the son deposited in the temple of the ancestors. Ceremonies ofconsiderable complexity took place four times a year; cooked foods, cereals, and various drinks were offered, and the ancestor's soul was invoked. The soul was personified by a member ofthe family, usually one of the dead man's grandsons, who shared out the offerings. Similar ceremonies are not uncommon in Asia and elsewhere; a ritual that involved a person representing the dead man was very probably practiced in the Shang period, if not as early as prehistory.23 The chthonic divinities and their cults have a long history, concerning which we are scantily informed. It is known that, before being represented as a mother, the earth was experienced as an asexual being or bisexual cosmic power.24 According to Marcel Granet, the image of Mother Earth first appears "under the neutral aspect of the Sacred Place." A little later "the domestic Earth was conceived under the features of a maternal and
Shih Ching (poem 153) for having given them "wheat and barley at God's command." We may add that human sacrifices, documented in the royal tombs of the Shang period, disappeared completely under the Chou. 23. Portraits of men with their arms raised, depicted on clay reliefs, most probably represent ancestors or priests of an ancestral cult (see Hentze, Funde in Alt-China, p. 224 and pl. XL). This iconographic motif is documented in the Neolithic and in the Shang period (ibid., figs. 29, 30). An excellent example of the "folklorization" of the ancestor theme is illustrated by a bronze box from the middle of the Chou period, the cover of which bears a representation, in a naively naturalistic style, of a man and a woman seated face to face (see ibid., p. 228 and pI. XLIII). 24. See Eliade, "Mother Earth and the Cosmic Hierogamies," in Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, p. 155.

nourishing principle."25 In ancient times the dead were buried in the domestic enclosure, where the seed was kept. For a long time, the guardian of seeds continued to be a woman. "In Chou times, the seeds destined to sow the royal field were not kept in the Son of Heaven's room but in the apartments of the queen" (Granet, p. 200). It is only later, with the appearance of the agnate family and seigneurial power, that the sun became a god. In the Chou period there were many gods of the soil, organized hierarchically: gods of the familial soil, god of the village, gods of the royal soil and the seigneurial soil. The altar was in the open air, but it comprised a stone tablet and a tree-relics of the original cult consecrated to Earth as cosmic power. The peasant cults, structured around the seasonal crises, probably represent the earliest forms of this cosmic religion. For, as we shall see (§ 130), the earth was not conceived only as source of agrarian fertility. As complementary power to the sky, it revealed itself to be an integral part of the cosmic totality. It is important to add that the religious structures that we have just sketched do not exhaust the rich documentation on the Chou period (archeological materials and, especially, a large number of texts). We shall complete our exposition by representing some cosmogonic myths and the fundamental metaphysical ideas. For the moment we will point out that scholars have recently agreed to emphasize the cultural and religious complexity of archaic China. As is the case with so many other nations, the Chinese ethnic stock was not homogeneous. In addition, in the beginning neither its language nor its culture nor its religion represented unitary systems. Wolfram Eberhard has brought out the contribution of peripheral ethnic elements-Thai, Tungus, Thrco
Mongol, Tibetan, etc.-to the Chinese synthesis.26 For the historian of religions, these contributions are precious: they help us to understand, among other things, the impact of northern

shamanism on Chinese religiosity and the "origin" of certain Taoist practices. The Chinese historiographers were conscious of the distance that separated their classical civilization from the beliefs and practices of the "barbarians." But among these "barbarians" we frequently find ethnic stocks that were partly or wholly assimilated and whose culture ended by becoming an integral part of Chinese civilization. We will give only one example: that of the Ch'u. Their kingdom was already established about 1100. Yet the Ch'u, who had assimilated the Chang culture, were of Mongol origin, and their religion was characterized by shamanism and techniques of ecstasy.27 The unification of China under the Han, though it brought the destruction of Ch'u culture, facilitated the dissemination of their religious beliefs and practices throughout China. It is probable that a number of their cosmological myths and religious practices were adopted by Chinese culture; as for their ecstatic techniques, they reappear in certain Taoist circles.
129. The origin and organizing of the world
No Chinese cosmogonic myth in the strict sense has come down to us, but it is possible to discern creator gods, euhemerized and secularized, in the Chinese historiographic tradition and in a number of legends. Thus it is narrated that P'an-ku, a primordial anthropomorphic being, was born "in the time when Heaven and Earth were a chaos resembling an egg." When P'an-ku died, his head became "a sacred peak, his eyes became the sun and moon, his fat the rivers and seas, the hair of his head and his body became trees and other plants."28 We can here see the essential features of a myth that explains Creation by the sacrifice ofaprimordial being: Tiamat(cf. §21), Puru~a(§ 75), Ymir(§ 173). A reference in the Shu Ching proves that the ancient Chinese

14 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
also knew another cosmogonic theme, documented among numerous peoples and at different levels of culture: "The August Lord (Huang-ti) ordered Tch'ong-li to break communication between Earth and Heaven, so that the descents [of the gods] should cease."29 This particular interpretation-that the gods and spirits descended to earth to oppress mankind-is secondary, for the other Chinese variants of this myth (and those produced by other cultures as well) praise the paradisal nature of the primordial age, when the extreme closeness of Earth to Heaven allowed the gods to descend and mingle with men, and men to ascend to the sky by climbing a mountain, a tree, or a ladder or even by letting themselves be carried by birds. After a certain mythical event (a "ritual fault' '), Heaven was violently separated from Earth, the tree or the vine was cut, or the mountain that touched Heaven was flattened. However, certain privileged beings-shamans, mystics, heroes, sovereigns-can ascend to heaven in ecstasy, thus reestablishing the communication broken off in illo tempore.30 Throughout Chinese history we find what could be called the nostalgia for paradise, that is, the desire to reenact, through ecstasy, a "primordial situation": the situation represented by the original unity/totality (hun-tun), or the time when human beings could meet the gods directly. Finally, a third myth tells of a brother-sister pair, Fu-hi and Nii-kua, two beings with the bodies ofdragons, often represented in iconography with their tails intertwined. On the occasion of a flood, "Nii-kua repaired the blue Heaven with stones of five colors, cut off the paws of a great tortoise to raise four pillars at the four poles, killed the black dragon (Kong-kong) to save the world, piled up ashes of reeds to halt the overflowing waters."3) Another text recounts that, after the creation of

The origin and organizing of the world 15
Heaven and Earth, Nii-kua formed men from yellow earth (noblemen) and from mud (the poor and wretched).32 The cosmogonic theme can also be discerned in the historicized tradition of Yii the Great. Under the (mythical) Emperor Yao, "the world was not yet in order, the vast waters flowed in a disorderly way, they flooded the world." Unlike his father, who, to conquer the waters, had built dikes, Yii "dug into the ground and made [the waters] flow toward the seas; he hunted snakes and dragons and drove them into the swamps."33 All these motifs-the earth covered with water, the multiplication of snakes and dragons-have a cosmogonic structure. Yii plays the parts of demiurge and civilizing hero. For Chinese scholars, the organizing of the world and the founding of human institutions are equivalent to the cosmogony. The world is "created" when, by banishing the forces of evil to the four quarters, the sovereign sets himself up in a Center and completes the organization of society. But the problem of the origin and formation of the world interested Lao Tzu and the Taoists, which implies the antiquity of cosmogonic speculations. Indeed, Lao Tzu and his disciples draw on the archaic mythological traditions, and the fact that the key terms of the Taoist vocabulary are shared by the other schools proves the antiquity and pan-Chinese character of Taoism. As we shall see (p. 20), the origin of the world according to Lao Tzu repeats, in metaphysical language, the ancient cosmogonic theme of chaos (hun-tun) as a totality resembling anegg. 34 As for the structure and rhythms of the universe, there is perfect unity and continuity among the various fundamental conceptions from the time of the Shang to the revolution of 1911. The traditional image of the universe is that of the Center traversed by a vertical axis connecting zenith and nadir and framed by the four quarters. Heaven is round (it has the shape of an egg)

and the Earth is square. The sphere of Heaven encloses the Earth. When the earth is represented as the square body of a chariot, a central pillar supports the dais, which is round like Heaven. Each of the five cosmological numbers-four quarters and one Center-has a color, a taste, a sound, and a particular symbol. China is situated at the center of the world, the capital is in the middle of the kingdom, and the royal palace is at the center of the capital. The representation of the capital and, in general, of any city as "center of the world" is in no way different from the traditional conceptions documented in the ancient Near East, in an
cient India, in Iran, etc.35 Just as in the other urban civilizations,
so too in China cities spread out from a ceremonial center.36 In other words, the city is especially a "center of the world" because it is there that communication with both Heaven and the underground regions is possible. The perfect capital ought to be placed at the center of the universe, which is the site of a miraculous tree called "Upright Wood" (Chien-mu); it unites the lower regions with the highest heaven, and "at noon anything close to it that stands perfectly upright cannot cast a shadow."37 According to Chinese tradition, every capital must possess a Ming t'ang, a ritual palace that is at once imago mundi and calendar. The Ming t'ang is built on a square base (= the Earth) and is covered by a round thatched roof (= Heaven). During the course of a year the sovereign moves from one part of the palace to another; by placing himself at the quarter demanded by the calendar, he successively inaugurates the seasons and the months. The colors of his garments, the foods he eats, the gestures he makes, are in perfect correspondence with the various moments of the annual cycle. At the end of the third month of summer, the sovereign takes a position at the center of the Ming t'ang, as if he were the pivot of the year.38 Like the other symbols

Granet, ibid., pp. 102 fT.; see also Granet's Danses et legendes de la Chine ancienne, pp. 116 fT. It seems that this ritual taking-of-position at the center of the Ming t'ang corresponds "to a period of retreat during which the ancient chieftains were obliged to remain deep in their dwellings." The six or

of the "center of the world" (the Tree, the Sacred Mountain, the nine-story tower, etc.), the sovereign in a certain sense incarnates the axis mundi and forms the connection between Earth and Heaven. The spatiotemporal symbolism of the "centers of the world" is widespread; it is documented in many archaic cultures as well as in every urban civilization.39 We should add that, just like the royal palace, the humblest primitive dwellings of China have the same cosmic symbolism: they constitute, that is, an imago mundi.40
130. Polarities, alternation, and reintegration
As stated above (p. 16), the five cosmological numbers-Le., the four horizons and the Center-constitute the exemplary model of a classification and at the same time of a homologation that is universal. Everything that exists belongs to a well-defined class or group and hence shares in the attributes and virtues typical of the realities subsumed under that class. So we find ourselves dealing with a daring elaboration of the system of correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm, that is, of the general theory of analogies that has played a considerable part in all traditional religions. The originality of Chinese thought lies in the fact that it integrated this macrocosm-microcosm schema into a still larger system of classification, that of the cycle of antagonistic but complementary principles known by the names of Yang and Yin. Paradigmatic systems, developed on the basis of different types of bipartition and polarity, of duality and alternation, of antithetical dyads and coincidentia oppositorum, are found throughout the world and at every level
twelve days "were spent in rites and observations that made it possible to foretell or determine the prosperity of stock-rearing and the success of the harvest" (La pensee chinoise, p. 107). The twelve days represented a prefiguration of the twelve months of the coming year-an archaic conception documented in the Near East and elsewhere (see Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return, pp. 51 ff.).

of culture.41 The importance of the Yang-Yin pair of contraries is due to the fact that it not only served as the universal model of classification but, in addition, was developed into a cosmology that, on the one hand, systematized and validated numerous corporal techniques and spiritual disciplines and, on the other hand, inspired increasingly strict and systematic philosophical speculation. As we have seen (§ 127), the symbolism of polarity and alternation is abundantly illustrated in the iconography of the Shangperiod bronzes. The polar symbols are so placed as to bring out their conjunction; for example, the owl, or some other figure symbolizing darkness, is given "solar eyes," whereas emblems of light are marked by a "nocturnal" signY According to Carl Hentze, the Yang-Yin symbolism is documented by the earliest ritual objects, which date from long before the earliest written texts. 43 Marcel Granet calls attention to the fact that in the Shih Ching the word yin suggests the idea of cold and cloudy weather and is applied to what is within, whereas the term yang suggests the idea of sunny weather and heat. In other words, yang and yin indicate concrete and antithetical ideas of time. 44 A manual of divination speaks of a "time of light" and a "time of darkness," anticipating Chuang Tzu's expressions: "a [time of] plenitude, a [time of] decrepitude ... a [time of] improvement, a [time of] abatement, a [time of] life, a [time of] death" (Granet, La pensee chinoise, p. 132). Hence the world represents "a cyclical totality [tao pien t'ung] constituted by the conjunction of two alternating and complementary manifestations" (ibid., p. 127). The idea of alternation appears to have won out over the idea of opposition. This is shown by the structure of the calendar. According to the philosophers, during the winter, "at the bottom of the underground springs beneath the frozen earth, the yang, circumvented by the y(n, undergoes a kind of annual ordeal, from which it emerges revivified. At the beginning of spring, it emerges from its prison, striking the ground with its heel: it is

then that the ice melts of itself and the streams awaken" (ibid., p. 135). Hence the universe reveals itself to be constituted by a series of antithetical forms that alternate cyclically. There is perfect symmetry between the cosmic rhythms, governed by the interaction of the yang and the yin, and the complementary alternation of the activities of the two sexes. And since a feminine nature has been attributed to everything that is yin and a masculine nature to everything that is yang, the theme of the hierogamy reveals a cosmic as well as a religious dimension. Indeed, the ritual opposition between the two sexes expresses both the complementary antagonism of the two life formulas and the alternation of the two cosmic principles, the yang and the yin. In the collective spring and autumn festivals, which are the keystone of the archaic peasant cults, the two antagonistic choruses, lined up face to face, challenge each other in verse. "The yang calls, the yin replies"; "the boys call, the girls reply." These two formulas are interchangeable; they indicate the rhythm that is at once cosmic and social.45 The antagonistic choruses confront each other like darkness and light. The field in which the encounter occurs represents the whole ofspace,just as the participants symbolize the whole ofthe human group and ofnatural things (Granet, p. 143). And a collective hierogamy crowned the festivities, a ritual that is exemplified elsewhere in the world. Polarity, accepted as governing life during the rest of the year, is abolished, or transcended, in the union of contraries. "Ayin (aspect), a yang (aspect)-that is the Tao," says a brief treatise.46 The unceasing transformation of the universe by the alternation of the yang and the yin manifests, so to speak, the exterior aspect of the Tao. But as soon as we attempt to grasp the ontological structure of the Tao, we encounter innumerable difficulties. Let us recall that the strict meaning of the word is "road, way," but also "to speak," whence the sense "doctrine." Tao' 'first of all suggests the image of a way to be followed" and "the idea of controlling conduct, of moral rule"; but it also means' 'the art of putting Heaven and Earth, the sacred powers and men, in communication," the magico-religious power of the

diviner, the sorcerer, and the king.47 For common philosophical and religious thought, the Tao is the principle of order, immanent in all the realms ofthe real; there is also mention of the Heavenly Tao and the Earthly Tao (which are opposed somewhat in the manner of the yang and the yin) and of the Tao of Man (that is, of the principles of conduct that, observed by the king, make possible his function as intermediary between Heaven and Earth).48 Some of these meanings derive from the archaic notion of the original unity/totality, in other words, from a cosmogonic conception. Lao Tzu's speCUlations concerning the origin of the world are bound up with a cosmogonic myth that tells of Creation from a totality comparable to an egg. In chapter 42 of the Tao
Te Ching we read: "The Tao gave birth to One. One gave birth to Two. Two gave birth to Three. Three gave birth to the ten thousand beings. The ten thousand beings carry the Yin on their back and encircle the Yang."49 We see in what way Lao Tzu made use of a traditional cosmogonic myth, at the same time giving it a new metaphysical dimension. The "One" is equivalent to the "whole"; it refers to the primordial totality, a theme familiar to many mythologies. The commentary explains that the union of Heaven and Earth (i.e., the' 'Two' ') gave birth to everything that exists, in accordance with an equally well-known mythological scenario. But for Lao Tzu, "One," the primitive unity/totality, already represents a stage of Creation, for it was engendered by a mysterious and incomprehensible principle, the Tao. In another cosmogonic fragment (chap. 25), the Tao is denominated "an undifferentiated and perfect being, born before Heaven and Earth.... We can consider it the Mother of this

world, but I do not know its name; I will call it Tao; and, if it must be named, its name will be: the Immense (ta)."50 The "undifferentiated and perfect" being is interpreted by a commentator of the second century B.C. thus: "the mysterious unity [Hung-t'ung] of Heaven and Earth chaotically [hun-tun] constitutes [the condition] of the uncarved block."51 Hence the Tao is a primordial totality, living and creative but formless and nameless. "That which is nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. That which has a name is the Mother of the ten thousand beings," says another cosmogonic fragment (chap. 1, lines 3-7). However, the "Mother," which in this passage represents the beginning of the cosmogony, elsewhere designates the Tao itself. "The divinity of the Valley does not die: it is the Obscure Female. The gate of the Obscure Female-that is the origin of Heaven and Earth."52 The ineffableness of the Tao is also expressed by other epithets, which continue, though at the same time color, the original cosmogonic image, which is Chaos (hun-tun). We list the most important of them: Emptiness (hsu), nothingness (wu), the Great (ta), the One (i),53 We shall return to some of these terms when we analyze Lao Tzu's doctrine, but it is important to mention at this point that the Taoist philosophers, as well as the hermits and adepts in search of long life and immortality, sought to reestablish this paradisal condition, especially the original perfection and spontaneity. It is possible to discern in this nostalgia for the primordial situation a new expression of the ancient agrarian scenario that ritually summoned up "totalization" by the collective ("chaotic") union of youths and girls, representatives of the Yang and the Yin. The essential element, common to all the Taoist schools, was exaltation of the primitive human

condition that existed before the triumph of civilization. But it was precisely this "return to nature" that was objected to by all those who wanted to inaugurate a just and duly policed society, governed by the norms, and inspired by the examples, of the fabulous kings and civilizing heroes.
131. Confucius: The power of the rites
It could be said that in ancient China all the trends of religious thought shared a certain number of fundamental ideas. We will mention first of all the notion of the tao as principle and source of the real, the idea of alternations governed by the yin-yang rhythm, and the theory of the analogy between macrocosm and microcosm. This theory was applied on all the planes of human existence and organization: the anatomy, physiology, and psychology of the individual; social institutions; and the dwellings and consecrated spaces (city, palace, altar, temple, house). But while some thinkers (notably the Taoists) held that an existence conducted under the sign of the tao and in perfect harmony with the cosmic rhythms was possible only in the beginning (that is, in the stage preceding social organization and the rise of culture), others considered this type of existence especially realizable in a just and civilized society. The most famous, and the most influential, of those who took the latter position was certainly Confucius (ca. 551-479).54 Living in a period of anarchy and injustice, saddened by the general suffering and misery, Confucius understood that the only solution was a radical reform of the government, carried out by enlightened leaders and applied by responsible civil servants. Since he did not himself succeed in obtaining an important post in the administration, he devoted his life to teaching and was indeed the first to follow the profession of private pedagogue. Despite his success among his numerous disciples, Confucius was convinced, shortly before his death, that his mission had been a total failure. But his disciples managed, from generation to generation,

Confucius: The power of the rites 23
to pass on the essence of his teaching, and 250 years after his death the sovereign ofthe Han dynasty (ca. A.D. 206-20) decided to entrust the administration of the empire to the Confucianists. From then on the Master's doctrines guided the civil service and the making of governmental policy for more than two thousand years. Properly speaking, Confucius is not a religious leader.55 His ideas, and especially those of the Neo-Confucianists, are usually studied in histories of philosophy. But, directly or indirectly, Confucius profoundly influenced Chinese religion. In fact, the actual source of his moral and political reform is religious. Then, too, he rejects none of the important traditional ideas, such as the tao, the celestial god, the ancestor cult. Furthermore, he extols, and revalorizes, the religious function of the rites and of customary behavior. For Confucius, tao 'was established by a decree of Heaven; "If the tao is practiced, that is because ofthe decree of Heaven" (Lun Yu = Analects 14. 38). To behave according to the tao is to conform to the will of Heaven. Confucius recognizes the preeminence of Heaven (T'ien). For him, this is no deus otiosus; T'ien is concerned for every individual separately and helps him to become better. "It is Heaven that produced virtue (te) in me," he declares (5. 22). "At the age of fifty years I understood the will of Heaven" (2. 4). In fact, the Master believed that Heaven had given him a mission to perform. Like many others among his contemporaries, he held that the way of Heaven is illustrated by the example of the civilizing heroes Yao and Shun and by the kings of the Chou, Wen, and Wu dynasties (8.20). Confucius declared that a man must perform the sacrifices and the other traditional rituals because they form part of the life of a "superior man" (chun tzu), of a "gentleman." Heaven likes to receive sacrifices; but it also likes moral behavior and, above all, good government. Metaphysical and theological speculations concerning Heaven and life after death are useless (5. 12; 7. 20; 11. 11). The "superior man" must first of all be concerned with concrete human existence, as it is lived here and now. As for
55. But Confucius was very soon invested with the virtues and attributes typical of civilizing heroes; see some examples in Granet, La pensee chinoise,

spirits, Confucius does not deny their existence, but he questions their importance. Though respecting them, he advises, "Keep them at a distance. That is wisdom" (6. 18). As for devoting oneself to their service, "If you cannot serve men, how could you serve the spirits?" (11. 11). The moral and political reform planned by Confucius constitutes a "total education," that is, a method able to transform the ordinary individual into a "superior man" (chun tzu). Anyone at all can become a "true man" on condition that he learn ceremonial behavior in conformity with the tao-in other words, correct practice of the rites and customs (Ii). However, this practice is not easy to master. It is neither a matter of wholly external ritualism nor one of an emotional exaltation deliberately induced during the accomplishment of a rite. Every piece of correct ceremonial behavior releases a formidable magico-religious power.56 Confucius calls up the image of the famous philosopher-king Shun: "He simply stood there, gravely and reverently, with his face turned toward the South [the ritual posture of sovereigns]and that was all" (in other words, the affairs of the kingdom proceeded in conformity with the norm; 15.4). For the cosmos and society are governed by the same magico-religious powers that are active in man. "With a correct behavior, it is not nec
essary to give orders" (13. 6). "To govern by virtue [tel is as if one were the Pole Star: one remains in place while all the other stars circle around in homage" (2. 2). A gesture made in accordance with the rule constitutes a new epiphany of the cosmic harmony. Obviously, he who is capable of such conduct is no longer the ordinary individual that he was before he was taught; his mode of existence is radically transformed; he is a "perfect man." A discipline whose object is the "transmutation" of gestures and behavior into rituals, at the same time preserving their spontaneity, undoubtedly has a religious intention and structure.57 From this point of view, Confucius' method can be compared with the doctrines and techniques by which Lao Tzu and the Taoists held that they could recover
56. This aspect has been well brought out by Herbert Fingarette in his Confucius: The Secular as Sacred.
57. A similar effort is visible in Tantrism, in the Cabala, and in certain Zen practices.



Lao Tzu and Taoism 25
the original spontaneity. Confucius' originality consists in his having pursued the "transmutation" of the gestures and conduct indispensable to a complex and highly hierarchized society into spontaneous rituals. For Confucius, nobility and distinction are not innate; they are obtained through education. One becomes a gentleman through discipline and through certain natural aptitudes (4. 5; 6. 5; etc.). Goodness, wisdom, and courage are the virtues peculiar to the nobility. Supreme satisfaction lies in developing one's own virtues: "He who is really good is never unhappy" (9. 28). However, the gentleman's proper career is to govern (7. 32). For Confucius, as for Plato, the art of governing is the only means of insuring the peace and happiness of the great majority. But, as we have just seen, the art of governing, like any other skill or behavior or significant act, is the result of a teaching and learning process that is essentially religious. Confucius revered the civilizing heroes and the great kings of the Chou dynasty; they were his exemplary models. "I have transmitted what I have been taught, without adding anything of my own. I have
been true to the men of old, and I have loved them!" (7. O. Some scholars have seen in these declarations a nostalgia for a period irrevocably ended. Yet in revalorizing the ritual function of public behavior, Confucius inaugurated a new way; he showed the need to recover, and the possibility of recovering, the religious dimension of secular work and social activity.
132. Lao Tzu and Taoism
In his Shih Chi ("Historical Memoirs"), written about 100 B.C., the great historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien narrates that when Confucius went to consult Lao Tan (i.e., Lao Tzu) concerning the rites, Lao Tan replied, among other things: "Get rid of your arrogant attitude and all these desires, this self-satisfaction and this overflowing zeal: all this is of no profit for your person. That is all I can tell you." Confucius withdrew in dismay. He confessed to
his disciples that he knew all animals-birds, fish, quadrupedsand that he understood their way of behavior, "but the dragon



26 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
I cannot know; he rises into heaven on the clouds and the wind. Today I saw Lao Tzu, and he is like the dragon!"58 This meeting is certainly apocryphal, as, indeed, are all the traditions recorded by Ssu-ma Ch'ien. But it explains, simply and humorously, the incompatibility between these two great religious personages. For, the historian adds, "Lao Tzu cultivated the Tao and Te: according to his doctrine, one must seek to live hidden and anonymously." But to live shunning public life and scorning honors was precisely the opposite of the ideal of the "superior man" advocated by Confucius. Lao Tzu's "hidden and anonymous" existence explains the lack of any authentic information concerning his biography. According to tradition he was for a time archivist at the Chou court, but, discouraged by the decadence of the royal house, he gave up his position and set off for the West. When he traveled through the Hsien-ku Pass, the border guard asked him to write down his doctrine. Whereupon he composed "a work in two parts, in which he set forth his ideas concerning the Tao and Te and which contained more than 5,000 words; then he went on, and no one knows what became of him." After relating all that he had learned, Ssu-ma Ch'ien concludes: "No one on earth can say whether this is true or not: Lao Tzu was a hidden sage." The book containing "more than 5,000 words" is the famous Tao Te Ching, the most profound and most enigmatic text in all Chinese literature. As to its author and the date when it was composed, opinions are not only various but contradictory.59 It is, however, now agreed that the text as it exists today cannot have been written by a contemporary of Confucius; it probably dates from the third century. It contains dicta that belong to various proto-Taoist schools and a certain number of aphorisms
58. After the translation by Chavannes in Kaltenmark, Lao tseu, p. 17. 59. At least four different positions are held: (I) Lao Tzu is the same person as Lao Tan ofthe sixth century and hence could have been visited by Confucius; (2) Lao Tzu lived in the so-called "Spring and Autumn" period (ca. 774-481), but he is not the author of the Tao T€ Ching; (3) he lived in the period of the Warring Kingdoms (ca. 404-221), but it is not certain that he wrote the Tao T€ Ching; (4) he is not a historical personage. See Wing-tsit Chan, The Way of Lao Tzu, pp. 35 ff., and Jan Yiin-Hua, "Problems of Tao and Tao Te Ching," p. 209 (the author summarizes the most recent views of Fung Yu-Ian on Lao Tzu and early Taoism, pp. 211 ff.).



Lao Tzu and Taoism 27
in verse that go back to the sixth century.60 Yet despite its unsystematic character, the Tao Te Ching expresses a thought that is consistent and original. As Kaltenmark observes, "Hence we must admit the existence of a philosopher who, if not directly its author, must at least be the master whose influence was determinative at its origin. There is no harm in continuing to call him Lao Tzu."6J Paradoxically, the Tao Te Ching contains a great deal of advice directed to sovereigns and political and military leaders. Like Confucius, Lao Tzu affirms that the affairs of the state can be successfully managed only if the prince follows the way of the Tao, in other words, if he practices the method of wu-wei, "without doing" or "nonaction." For "the Tao forever remains without action, and there is nothing that it does not do" (37. 1).62 This is why the Taoist never intervenes in the course of events. "If noblemen and kings were able, imitating the Tao, to hold to this attitude of nonintervention, the ten thousand beings would at once follow their example of themselves" (37. 2). Like the true Taoist, "the best [of princes] is the one whose existence is not known" (17. 1). Since "the heavenly Tao triumphs without striving" (73. 6), the most effective ways of obtaining power are wu-wei and nonviolence.63 "The supple and the weak overcome
60. See Kaltenmark, Lao tseu, pp. 19 ff. 61. Ibid., p. 22. The same situation is also found in other traditional literatures: the work, attributed to a certain sage or contemplative, is usually continued and enriched by his disciples. In a certain sense the author, by becoming famous, became "anonymous." 62. Except when otherwise indicated, the translations are after those by Max Kaltenmark in his Lao tseu. The English version by Wing-tsit Chan, The Way of Lao Tzu, is valuable for its notes and commentaries; the translation by Arthur Waley, The Way and Its Power, is distinguished by its literary quality. [Unfortunately, Kaltenmark's version differs so often and so widely from Waley's that it has been impossible to quote the latter instead of retranslating the former.-Translator.] 63. "He who aspires to power and expects to obtain it by action-I foresee that he will fail in his attempt" (29. 1) "The good military leader is not belligerent; the good soldier is not impetuous. He who best overcomes the enemy is he who never takes the offensive.... This is what I call the virtue of nonviolence. This is what I call equaling Heaven. To equal Heaven was the highest idea of the ancients" (68. 1-2, 7).



28 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
the unyielding and the strong" (36. 10; cf. 40. 2, "weakness is the function of the Tao"). In short, just like Confucius, who proposes his ideal of the "perfect man" both to sovereigns and to any man wishing to learn, Lao Tzu invites political and military leaders to behave in the manner of Taoists, in other words, to accept the same exemplary model: that of the Tao. But this is the only similarity between the two masters. Lao Tzu criticizes and rejects the Confucian system, that is, the importance of the rites, respect for social values, and rationalism. "Let us renounce Benevolence, let us discard Justice; the people will recover the true virtues of the family" (19. O. For the Confucianists, benevolence and justice are the greatest virtues. Lao Tzu, however, regards them as attitudes that are artificial and hence useless and dangerous. "When one abandons the Tao, one has recourse to Benevolence; when one abandons Benevolence, one has recourse to Justice; when one abandons Justice, one has recourse to the Rites. The Rites are only a thin layer of loyalty and faith and the beginning of anarchy" (38. 9-14). Lao Tzu similarly condemns social values, because they are illusory and in the last analysis harmful. As for discursive knowledge, it destroys the unity of being and encourages confusion by bestowing an absolute value on relative notions.64 "That is why the holy man confines himself to inactivity and carries on wordless teaching" (2. 10). In the last analysis, the Taoist is guided by only one exemplary model: the Tao. Yet the Tao designates the ultimate, mysterious, and inapprehensible reality, fons et origo of all creation, foundation of all existence. When we analyzed its cosmogonic function, we pointed out the ineffable character of the Tao (see pp. 20-21). The first line of the Tao Te Ching affirms: "A tao of which it is possible to speak [tao] is not the permanent Tao [ch'ang tao]" (1. 1). This is as much as to say that the Tao of which Lao Tzu is speaking, the model of the Taoist, is not the Ch'ang Tao
64. "In this world each man affirms that what is beautiful is beautiful, thereby ugliness is instituted; and each man affirms that what is good is good, thereby the 'not good' is instituted." " 'Long' and 'short' exist only comparatively; 'high' and 'low' are interconnected" (2. 1-2, 5-6).



Lao Tzu and Taoism 29
(permanent or supreme Tao).65 The latter, constituted by the totality ofthe Real, transcends the modalities ofbeings and therefore is inaccessible to knowing. Neither Lao Tzu nor Chuang Tzu tries to prove its existence-an attitude well known to be shared by many mystics. In all probability, the "Obscure deeper than obscurity itself" refers to the typically Taoist experience ofecstasy, to which we shall return. So Lao Tzu speaks of a "second," contingent Tao; but this cannot be apprehended either. "I gaze and I see nothing.... I listen and I hear nothing. . . . I find only an undifferentiated Unity.... Indiscernible, it cannot be named" (chap. 14).66 But certain images and metaphors reveal some significant structures. As we have already pointed out (pp. 21-22), the "second" Tao is called the "Mother of the World" (chaps. 25 and 52). It is symbolized by the "divinity of the Valley," the "Obscure Female" that does not die.67 The image of the valley suggests the idea of emptiness and at the same time the idea ofa receptacle of waters, hence of fecundity. Emptiness, the void, is associated, on the one hand, with the notion of fertility and maternity and, on the other hand, with the absence of sensible qualities (the special modality ofthe Tao). The image ofthe thirty spokes converging toward the emptiness of the hub inspires an especially rich symbolism, evident in "the virtue ofthe leader who attracts to himself all beings, of the sovereign Unity that gives order to mUltiplicity around it," but also evident in the Taoist who, "when he is empty, that is, purified of passions and desires, is completely inhabited by the Tao" (Kaltenmark, p. 55). By conforming to the model of the "second" Tao, the adept reanimates and strengthens his feminine potentialities, first of all
65. "Or better, the Mysterious [Hsuang], or still better the Obscure deeper than obscurity itself, for there is no end to probing deeper into the mystery" (Kaltenmark, p. 45). 66. Another passage presents the Tao as "an imperceptible, indiscernible being" that "contains iIi its bosom" images, beings, fecund essences, and spiritual essences (chap. 21). 67. The expression Obscure Female "suggests the mysterious fecundity of the Tao at the same time that it is connected with the idea of the valley or cavity in the mountain" (Kaltenmark, p. 51). On this aspect ofthe Tao, see the articles by Ellen Marie Chen, especially "Nothingness and the Mother Principle in Early Chinese Taoism."



30 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
"weakness," humility, nonresistance. "Know masculinity, but prefer feminiRity: you will be the ravine of the world. Be the ravine of the world and the Supreme Te will not fail you, and you can return to the state of infancy" (28. 1-2). From a certain point of view, the Taoist attempts to obtain the modality of the androgyne, the archaic ideal of human perfection.68 But the integration of the two sexes makes it easier to return to the state of infancy, that is, "to the beginning" of individual existence; such a return makes possible the periodic regeneration of life. We now better understand the Taoist's desire to recover the primordial situation, the situation that existed "in the beginning." For him, fullness of life, spontaneity, and bliss are bestowed only at the beginning of a "creation" or of a new epiphany of life.69 The model for the integration of contraries is always the Tao; in its unity/totality the Yang and Yin coexist. But as we have seen (p. 19), beginning in the protohistorical period the collective hierogamy of youths and girls, representing the Yang and the Yin, periodically reactualized the cosmic and social unity/totality. In this case too, Taoism is inspired by archaic religious patterns of behavior. It is important to add that the Taoists' attitude toward women contrasted sharply with the ideology that was predominant in feudal China. The pan-Chinese idea of the cosmic circuit plays an important part in the Tao Te Ching. The Tao "circulates everywhere in the universe, never being stopped" (chap. 25). The life and death of beings are also explained by the alternation of the Yang and the Yin: the former stimulates the vital energies, but the Yin brings rest. However, the holy man hopes to withdraw from the universal rhythm of life and death; by realizing emptiness in his own being, he places himself outside the circuit. As Lao Tzu expresses it, "there is no place in him [in the holy man] for death" (50. 13). "He who is supplied with a plenitude of Te is comparable to a newborn infant" (55. 1). The Taoists are acquainted with several techniques for prolonging life indefinitely
68. See Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 78 ff. 69. This is, of course, a common idea, shared by all traditional societies: perfection belongs to the beginning of the (cosmic or "historical") cycle, and "decadence" soon makes itself felt.



Lao Tzu and Taoism 31
and even for obtaining a "physical immortality." The quest for long life forms part of the quest for the Tao. But Lao Tzu does not appear to have believed in physical immortality or in the survival of the human personality. The Tao Te Ching is not explicit on this point.70 To put the problem in its proper context, it must be remembered that the Taoist technique of ecstasy is shamanic in origin and structure.71 We know that during a trance the shaman's soul leaves his body and journeys in the cosmic regions. According to an anecdote narrated by Chuang Tzu, Confucius one day found Lao Tzu "completely inert and no longer having the appearance of a living being." After waiting for some time, he spoke to him: "Have my eyes deceived me, or was it real? Just now, Master, your body looked like a piece of dry wood, you seemed to have left the world and men and to have taken refuge in an inaccessible solitude." "Yes," Lao Tzu answered, "I went to frolic at the Origin of all things" (chap. 21). As Kaltenmark observes (p. 82), the expression "journey to the Origin of all things" sums up the essence of the Taoist mystical experience. This ecstatic journey constitutes a return "to the beginning" of
all things; by freeing itself from time and space, the spirit recovers the eternal present that transcends both life and death. What we have here is a revalorization and a deepening of shamanic ecstasy. During his trance the shaman, too, frees himself from time and space: he flies away to the "center of the world"; he reconstitutes the paradisal period before the "fall," when men could ascend to heaven and converse with the gods. But Lao Tzu's journey to the origin of things constitutes a mystical experience of a different kind; for he transcends the limitations that characterize the human condition and hence radically alters its ontological order. Very little is known about the life of Chuang Tzu, the second great master of Taoism. He probably lived in the fifth century B.C.; if this is so, some of his aphorisms are earlier than the text of the Tao Te Ching as we have it. Like Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu

rejects both current opinions and discursive knowledge. The only perfect knowledge is ecstatic, since it does not involve the duality of the real. This is why Chuang Tzu identifies life and death: they are the two modalities, or the two aspects, of ultimate reality.72 This theme of the unity life/death is constantly treated by Taoist authors.73 A well-known anecdote illustrates Chuang Tzu's conception of the relativity of states of consciousness: "Long ago I, Chuang Chou, dreamed that I was a butterfly, a butterfly on the wing, and I was happy; I did not know that was Chou. Suddenly I waked, and I was myself, the real Chou. And I do not know if I was Chou dreaming that he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that it was Chou."74 In other words, within the circling course of the Tao, states of consciousness are interchangeable. The holy man, who has emptied his spirit of all conditionings and has emerged in the unity/totality of the Tao, lives in an unbroken ecstasy. As in the case of certain yogins, this paradoxical mode of existing in the world is sometimes expressed in extravagant terms of divine Qmnipotence. "The perfect man is pure spirit. He does not feel the heat of burning brush or the chill of flooding waters; the thunder that splits mountains, the storm that stirs up the ocean, cannot frighten him. For such a one, the clouds are his carriage horses, the sun and the moon are his riding horses. He wanders beyond the Four Seas; the alternations of life and death do not concern him, and still less notions of good and evil."75 According to some Taoist authors, these ecstatic peregrinations are really inner journeys.76 As is the case with other peoples dominated by shamanism-for example, the Thrco-Mongols-the ordeals and adventures of the shaman

Chinese terminology usually distinguishes philosophical Taoism (Tao Chia, literally, "Taoist school") from religious Taoism or "Taoist religion" (Tao Chiao, literally, "Taoist sect").78 Some authors regard this distinction as justified and necessary; for them, the Taoism of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu is a "pure philosophy," in basic contrast to the search for physical immortality, the central goal of the "Taoist religion.' '79 Another group of scholars maintains the fundamental unity of all the historical forms
of Taoism.80 And in fact the "metaphysicians," the "mystics," and the adepts in quest of physical immortality all shared the same paradoxical conception of the Tao and sought to reach the same result: to unite in their person the two epiphanies of ultimate reality (yang and yin, matter and spirit, life and death). But the distinction between "philosophical Taoism" and the "Taoist religion" is useful and may be preserved. The ultimate goal of the adepts was to obtain physical immortality. The ideogram for the Immortal (hsien), depicting a man and a mountain, suggests a hermit; but its earliest forms represented a dancing man waving his sleeves like a bird beating its wings. The adept in the process of obtaining immortality was covered with feathers, and wings sprouted from his shoulders.8! "To ascend to heaven in broad daylight" was the consecrated

formula for the Master's final apotheosis. A second category comprised the adepts who lived for centuries in a sort of earthly paradise: the Wonderful Islands or the Sacred Mountain, K'un
Wn.82 They returned to earth from time to time to transmit the formulas for physical immortality to certain neophytes worthy to receive it. Finally, the third category included those who did not attain to the earthly paradises until after death. But this death was only apparent: in the coffin they left a staff, a sword, or a pair of sandals, to which they had given the appearance of their body. This was called the "freeing of the corpse."83 The Immortals were sometimes represented with a disproportionately large skull, a sign that their mind had stored up a great deal of yang energy. Several techniques for long life are available to the adept. Their basic principle consists in "nourishing the vital force" (yang-hsing). Since there is perfect correspondence between the macrocosm and the human body, the vital forces enter and leave by the nine bodily orifices; so these must be vigilantly watched. Taoists divide the body into three sections, called "Fields of Cinnabar";84 the upper "field" is in the brain, the second is near the heart, the third is below the navel. Dietary practices have a definite goal: nourishing the organs with foods and medicinal herbs that contain the "energies" that are proper to them. It must be remembered that the inner regions of the body are inhabited not only by gods and guardian spirits but also by maleficent beings: the "Three Worms," which inhabit the three "Fields of Cinnabar," devour the adept's vitality. To get rid of them, he must give up ordinary foods (cereals, flesh, wine, etc.)

and feed on medicinal pla,nts and mineral substances able to kill
the three demons.85 By freeing himself from the three inner demons, the adept begins to feed on dew or the cosmic "breaths"; he inhales not only the atmospheric air but also the solar, lunar, and stellar emanations. According to certain recipes, documented in the third century after Christ, the emanation of the sun must be absorbed at noon (when the yang is at its height), that of the moon (containing the yin) at midnight. But above all it is necessary to hold the breath; by an inner vision and by concentrating his thought, the adept is able to visualize his breath and conduct it through the three Fields of Cinnabar. If he holds his breath for the time required, for one thousand respirations, he obtains immortality.86 A special procedure is called "embryonic breathing" (I' ai-sO; this is an inner, closed-circuit "breathing" similar to that of the
fetus in its mother's womb.87 "By returning to the base, going back to the origin, one drives away old age, one returns to the fetal state."88 "Embryonic respiration" is not, like the yogic pra1}ayama (see § 143), a preliminary exercise for meditation. Nevertheless, the practice makes a certain experience possible. According to the T'ai-ping ching (third century A.D.), it is possible, by an inner vision, to discern the gods that reside in the five organs. They are, furthermore, the same as those that inhabit the macrocosm. By meditating, the adept can enter into communication with them and make them visit and strengthen his body. 89

Another method for obtaining longevity involves a sexual technique that is at once a ritual and a way ofmeditation. The practices "of the bedchamber [fang shung]," as they are called, go back to a very early time; their purpose is to increase vitality and to insure long life and the procreation of male offspring. But the Taoist technique, the "way ofthe Yin" ofthe Immortal Yang-cheng (first century A.D.), consists in "making the semen return to repair the brain." And infact this is the same typically Taoist ideal ofataraxia: avoid dispersal of the vital energy. The adept must perform the sexual act without emission of semen. Retaining it makes it possible for the semen, mingled with the' 'breath," to circulate within the body or, more precisely, to ascend from the lower Field of Cinnabar to the one situated in the head, where it will revitalize the brain. Normally, both partners gain by the act. A text of the fifth century A. D. states that through' 'perfect meditation. . . men and women can practice the method of Eternal Life." Through meditation the two partners must "lose consciousness of their body and consciousness of the external world"; then, after uttering prayers, the man must concentrate on the loins and the woman on the heart. "This is the method for not dying."90 The Immortal Jung Ch'eng Kung's knowledge ofthe method of "repairing and conducting" was perfect. "He drew the essence from the mysterious Female" (see above, note 67); his principle was that the vital spirits that reside in the Valley do not die, for by them life is maintained and the breath is nourished. His hair, which was white, became black again; his teeth~ which had fallen out, grew once more. His practices were exactly the same as those of Lao Tzu. He is also said to have been' 'Lao Tzu's master.' '91 Some adepts used a method that has been termed "vampirism" (Kaltenmark) and that was condemned as not orthodox. It consisted in absorbing the vital energy ofthe women one approached: "this energy, coming from the very springs of life, procured a considerable degree oflongevity."92

The Taoists and alchemy 37
One of the chief goals of the Taoist sexual technique is to mingle the semen with the breath in the lower Field of Cinnabar and there, below the navel, to form the "mysterious embryo" of the new immortal body. Nourished exclusively on the "breath," this embryo develops into a "pure body" that, upon the adept's seeming death, detaches itself from his corpse and joins the other Immortals. In order to "repair the brain," the adept had to absorb a great amount of Yin; this is why he often changed partners. This practice later gave rise to the collective "union of breaths," a ceremony that was frequently criticized, especially by the Buddhists. But this kind of "orgy" was strictly ritual; in fact, it goes back to the agrarian ceremonies of protohistory (see § 130). A certain Indian influence, especially that of "left-hand" Tantrism, which had elaborated a yogic method of obtaining the simultaneous arrest ofrespiration and ofseminal emission,93 is perceptible in Taoist sexual practices. Just as in Tantrism, the Taoist sexual terminology refers equally to mental operations and to mystical experiences.
134. The Taoists and alchemy
Certain rites and mythologies of metallurgists, smelters, and blacksmiths were revived and reinterpreted by the alchemists. Archaic conceptions concerning the birth of minerals in the "womb" of the earth, the natural transformation of metals into gold, the mystical value of gold, and the ritual complex "blacksmiths-initiatory brotherhoods-trade secrets" recur in the teachings of the alchemists. The specialists are not in agreement concerning the origins of Chinese alchemy; the dates of the earliest texts mentioning alchemical operations are still in dispute. In China as elsewhere, alchemy is defined by a twofold belief: (1) in the transmutation of metals into gold and (2) in the "soteriological" value of operations performed to obtain this result. Precise references to these two beliefs are documented in China from the fourth cen

tury before Christ. It is generally agreed to regard Tsu Yen, a contemporary of Mencius, as the "founder" of alchemy.94 In the second century before Christ the relation between preparing alchemical gold and obtaining longevity-immortality is clearly recognized by Lii An and other authors.95 Chinese alchemy, as an autonomous discipline, is a compound of (1) the traditional cosmological beliefs; (2) the myths concerning the elixir of immortality and the Holy Immortals; and (3) the techniques whose goal was not only the prolongation of life but bliss and spiritual spontaneity. These three elementsprinciples, myths, and techniques-were part of the cultural inheritance from protohistory, and it would be a mistake to believe that the date of the earliest documents that attest to them also tells us their age. The solidarity between "preparing gold," obtaining the "drug of immortality," and "evoking" the Immortals is obvious: Luan Tai appears before the Emperor Wu and assures him that he can perform these three miracles, but he is able to "materialize" only the Immortals.96 The magician Li Shao-chiin instructs the Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty: "Sacrifice at the furnace (tsao) and you can make (supernatural) beings appear; when you have made (supernatural) beings appear, powdered cinnabar can be transformed into yellow gold; when yellow gold has been produced, you can make utensils from it for drinking and eating, and then you will have increased longevity. When your longevity is increased, you can see the blessed (hsien) in the island of P'ong-Iai, which is in the middle of the seas. When you have seen them and have made the/eng and shan sacrifices, you will not die."97 So the quest for the elixir was connected with the quest for distant and mysterious islands in which the "Immortals" dwelt; for to encounter the Immortals is to transcend the human condition and share in a timeless and beatific existence. 98

The search for gold also implied a spiritual quest. Gold possessed an imperial character: it was found at the "center of the earth" and was mystically related to chile (realgar or sulphur), yellow mercury, and the future life (the "Yellow Springs"). It is thus presented in a text of ca. 122, Huai-nan Tzu, where we also find documentation for the belief in a hastened metamorphosis of metals.99 So the alchemist only accelerates the growth of metals. Like his equivalent in the West, the Chinese alchemist contributes to the work of nature by accelerating the rhythm of time. Gold and jade, by the fact that they share in the Yang principle, preserve bodies from corruption. For the same reason, alchemical vessels of gold prolong life to infinity.loo According to a tradition handed down in the Lieh Hsien Ch'uan (Complete Biographies of the Immortals), the alchemist We Po-yang succeeded in preparing "pills of immortality"; when, together with one of his disciples and his dog, he swallowed some of these pills, the three left earth in the flesh and went to join the other Immortals. 101 The traditional homologation between the microcosm and the macrocosm connected the five cosmological elements (water, fire, wood, air, earth) with the organs of the human body: the heart with the essence of fire, the liver with the essence of wood, the lungs with the essence of air, the kidneys with the essence of water, the stomach with the essence of earth. The microcosm of the human body is in tum interpreted in alchemical terms: "the fire ofthe heart is red like cinnabar; the water of the kidneys

Fragment translated by Dubs, pp. 71-72. It is possible that this text comes from the school of Tsu Yen, if not from the Master himself, who was contemporary with Mencius, fourth century (ibid., p. 74).

is black like lead," etc. 102 Consequently, man possesses, in his own body, all the elements that make up the cosmos and all the vital forces that insure its periodic renewal. It is simply a matter of strengthening certain essences. Hence the importance of cinnabar, due less to its red color (the color of blood, the vital principle) than to the fact that, exposed to fire, cinnabar produces mercury. Hence it contains, in hidden form, the mystery of regeneration through death (for burning symbolizes death). It follows that cinnabar can insure the perpetual regeneration of the human body and, in the last analysis, can procure immortality. The great alchemist Ko Hung (283-343) writes that ten pills ofa mixture of cinnabar and honey, taken in the course of a year, make white
hair become black and lost teeth grow again; if one goes on for longer than a year, one obtains immortality. 103 But cinnabar can also be created inside the human body, first of all by distillation of the sperm in the Fields of Cinnabar (see p. 37). Another name for these Fields of Cinnabar, a secret region of the brain containing the "chamber like a cave," is K'un-liin. But K'un-liin is the fabulous Mountain in the Western Sea, abode of Immortals. "To enter it through mystical meditation, one enters a 'chaotic' (hun) state resembling the primordial, paradisal, 'unconscious' state of the uncreated world."I04 Let us note these two elements: (1) the homologation of the mythical mountain K'un-liin with the secret regions of the brain and the abdomen; (2) the role attributed to the "chaotic" state, which, once it is realized through meditation, permits entry into the Fields of Cinnabar and thus makes possible the alchemical preparation of the embryo of immortality. The Mountain in the Western Sea, abode of the Immortals, is a traditional and very ancient image of the "world in little"-of a miniature universe.

Cinnabar as a drug of longevity is mentioned in the first century before our era in the collection of legendary biographies of the Taoist Immortals, the Lieh-hsien chuan. After absorbing cinnabar for several years, one master "had again become like a youth," another "was able to travel by flying," etc.; see Kaltenmark, Le Liesien Tchouan, pp. 271, 146-47, etc. 104.

The Taoists and aLchemy 41
The K'un-liin mountain has two stories: an upright cone surmounted by an inverted cone. lOS In other words, it has the shape ofa gourd,just like the alchemist's furnace and the secret region of the brain. As for the "chaotic" state realized by meditation and indispensable for the alchemical operation, it is comparable to the materia prima, the massa. confusa, of Western alchemy.l06 The materia prima is not to be understood simply as a primordial structure of substance, for it is also an inner experience of the alchemist. The reduction of matter to its first condition of absolute undifferentiation corresponds, on the plane of inner experience, to regression to the prenatal, embryonic state. But, as we have seen, the theme of rejuvenation and longevity by a regressus ad uterum is one of the prime goals of Taoism. The most commonly used method is "embryonic respiration" (t'aisz), but the alchemist also obtains this return to the embryonic
stage by the fusion of ingredients in his furnace. lo7 After a certain period, external alchemy (wai-tan) is considered to be "exoteric" and is opposed to internal alchemy of the yogic type (nei-tan), which alone is termed "esoteric." The neitan becomes esoteric because the elixir is prepared in the alchemist's own body by methods of "subtle physiology" and without the help of mineral or vegetable substances. The "pure" metals (or their "souls") are identified with the various parts of the body, and the alchemical processes, instead of being performed in the laboratory, take place in the adept's body and consciousness. The body becomes the crucible in which the "pure" mercury and the "pure" lead circulate and fuse, together with the semen virile and the breath.

106. See The Forge and the Crucible, pp. 153 ff., and vol. 3 of the present work. 107. See The Forge and the Crucible, p. 119. This "return to the womb" is only the development of an earlier and more widely disseminated concept, already documented on archaic levels of culture: cure by a symbolic return to the origins ofthe world, that is, by reactualizing the cosmogony (see Myth and Reality, pp. 24 ff.). The Taoists and the Chinese alchemists took up and perfected this traditional method; that is, instead of limiting it to curing various diseases, they applied it especially to curing man from the wear and tear of time, that is, from old age and death.



42 THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA
By combining, the forces of Yang and Yin engender the "mysterious embryo" (the "elixir oflife," the "Yellow Flower"), the immortal being that will finally escape from the body through the occiput and ascend to Heaven (cf. p. 37). The nei-tan can be regarded as a technique similar to "embryonic respiration," with the difference that the processes are described in the terminology of esoteric alchemy. Respiration is homologized to the sexual act and the alchemical work, and woman is assimilated to the crucible. lOS A number of ideas and practices that we have presented in the last two sections are documented in texts from the Ch'in and Han periods (ca. 25 B.c.-220 A.D.)-which does not necessarily imply that they were unknown earlier. We have considered it useful to discuss them at this point, since the techniques for long life and, to some extent, alchemy are an integral part of ancient Taoism. But it must be added that, in the Han period, Lao Tzu was already deified and that Taoism, organized as an independent religious institution, had assumed a messianic mission and had inspired revolutionary movements. These more or less unexpected developments will engage our attention later (chap. 35, vol. 3). For the moment, it is enough to recall that, in a text as early as ca. 165, Lao Tzu was considered to be an emanation of the primordial chaos and was assimilated to P'an-ku, the cosmic anthropomorph (§ 129).109 As for the "Taoist religion" (Tao Chiao), it was founded, toward the end of the second century A.D., by Chang Tao-ling. After obtaining the elixir of immortality, Chang ascended to Heaven and received the title Heavenly Master (t'ien shih). In the province of Szechuan he inaugurated a "taocracy," in which the temporal and spiritual powers converged. The success of the sect owed much to its leader's talent as a healer. As we shall have occasion to see in volume 3 (chap. 35), what is involved is, rather, a psychosomatic thaumaturgy, reinforced by meals taken in common, during which those present shared in the vir
108. See R. H. van Gulik, Erotic Colour Prints, pp. 115 ff. 109. "Lao Tzu transformed his body. His left eye became the moon; his head became Mount K'un-Iun, his beard became the planets and the zodiacal houses; his flesh became the quadrupeds; his intestines became snakes; his belly became the sea, etc." (text translated in Maspero, Le taoisme, p. 108).

tues of the Tao. The monthly orgiastic ceremony, the "union of breaths," pursued the same end (see p. 37). But a similar hope of regeneration by the Tao is characteristic of another Taoist movement, the sect of "The Great Peace" (T'ai-p'ing). As early as the first century A.D., the founder of the movement presented a work of eschatological intent to the emperor. The book, dictated by spirits, revealed the means of regenerating the Han dynasty. This inspired reformer was put to death, but his messianism lived on in his disciples. In 184 the leader of the sect, Chang Chiieh, proclaimed the imminence of the renovatio and announced that the "Blue Heaven" was to be replaced by the "Yellow Heaven" (for this reason his disciples wore yellow turbans). The revolt that he precipitated very nearly overthrew the dynasty. The revolt itself was finally suppressed by the imperial troops, but the messianic fever continued throughout the Middle Ages. The last leader of the "Yellow Turbans" was executed in 1112.



17 Brahmanism and Hinduism:
The First Philosophies and Techniques of Salvation
135. "All is suffering • • • "
The expansion of Brahmanism and, some centuries later, of Hinduism followed closely on the Aryanization of the subcontinent. It is probable that the Brahmans had already arrived in Ceylon by the sixth century B.C. Between the second century B.C. and the sixth century of our era, Hinduism made its way into Indochina, Sumatra, Java, and Bali. To be sure, in the course of entering Southeast Asia, Hinduism was obliged to incorporate a number of local elements. I But symbiosis, assimilation, and syncretism played a similar part in the conversion of central and southern India. By their pilgrimages and their journeys into distant regions the Brahmans had greatly contributed to the cultural and religious unification of the subcontinent. At the beginning of the Christian era these "missionaries" had succeeded in imposing on the local Aryan and non-Aryan populations the social structure, the cult system, and the Weltanschauung characteristic of the Vedas and the Brahma:t;,las, but they demonstrated both tolerance and opportunism by assimilating a large number of popular, marginal, and autochthonous elements.2 By virtue of homologations accomplished on several levels (mythology, ritual, theology, etc.) the non-Brahmanic religious complexes were reduced, so to speak, to a common denominator and were finally absorbed by orthodoxy. Assimilation of autochthonous and

"All is suffering ..." 45
"popular" divinities by Hinduism remains a phenomenon still active today. 3 The transition from Brahmanism to Hinduism is imperceptible. As we have pointed out, certain specifically "Hinduistic" elements were already present within Vedic society (§ 64). But since they were not of interest to the authors of the hymns and the BrahmaQ.as, these more or less "popular" elements were not recorded in the texts. On the other hand, the process already documented in the Vedic period, especially the devaluation of certain great gods and their replacement by other figures (see § 66), continued down to the Middle Ages. Indra still retains his popularity in the Epic, but he is no longer the erstwhile champion and proud leader of the gods: dharma is stronger than he, and the late texts even term him a coward.4 In contrast, Vi~Q.u and Siva obtain an exceptional position, and the female divinities begin their spectacular careers. The Aryanization and Hinduization of the subcontinent were accomplished during the profound crises to which the ascetics and contemplatives of the Upanishads and, above all, the preaching of Gautama Buddha bear witness. In fact, for the religious elites, the horizon had changed radically after the Upanishads. "All is suffering, all is transitory," the Buddha had proclaimed. This is a leitmotiv of all post-Upanishadic religious thought. Doctrines and speculations, together with methods of meditation and soteriological techniques, have their justification in this universal suffering, for they are without value save insofar as they deliver man from "suffering." Human experience, no matter what its nature, engenders suffering. As a late writer puts it: "The body is pain, because it is the place of pain; the senses, the objects [ofthe senses], the perceptions are suffering, because they lead to suffering; pleasure itself is suffering, because it is followed by suffering."5 And isvaralq~Q.a, the author of the earliest Sarpkhya treatise, affirms that the foundation of that phi

losophy is man's desire to escape from the torture of the three sufferings: from celestial misery (provoked by the gods), from terrestrial misery (caused by nature), and from inner or organic misery.6 However, the discovery of this universal suffering does not result in pessimism. No Indian philosophy, no Indian religious message, ends in despair. The revelation of suffering as the law of existence can, on the contrary, be considered the sine qua non of liberation; intrinsically, therefore, this universal suffering has a positive and stimulating value. It constantly reminds the sage and the ascetic that only one means of attaining to freedom and bliss is left to him: withdrawing from the world, detaching himself from possessions and ambitions, isolating himself completely. Besides, man is not alone in suffering; suffering is a cosmic necessity. The mere fact of existing in time, of having duration, involves suffering. Unlike the gods and animals, man is able to overcome his condition. The certainty that a way of obtaining deliverance exists-a certainty common to all Indian philosophies and mysticisms-cannot lead to either despair or pessimism. To be sure, suffering is universal; but for him who knows how to go about delivering himself from it, it is not final.
136. Methods of attaining the supreme "awakening"
Liberation from suffering is the goal of all Indian philosophies and techniques of meditation. No knowledge has any value if it does not pursue the salvation of man. "Except for that [Le., except for the Eternal that resides in the Self], nothing is worth knowing" (Svetiisvatara Up. 1. 12).7 "Salvation" involves transcending the human condition. Indian literature employs images of binding, fettering, or captivity, of forgetting, intoxication, sleep, or unknowing to signify the human condition; to express abolition (Le., transcendence) ofthe human condition-freedom, deliverance (mok~a, mukti, nirviifJ,a, etc.)-it employs images of deliverance from bonds and of tearing the veil (or removing a

Methods of attaining the supreme "awakening" 47
blindfold that covered the eyes), or of awakening, remembering, and so forth. The Chtindogya Upani~ad (6. 14. 1-2) tells of a blindfolded man taken far from his city and abandoned in a solitary place. The man begins crying out: "I have been led here blindfolded; I have been abandoned here blindfolded!" Someone then removes his blindfold and points out the direction of his city to him. Asking his way from village to village, the man succeeds in returning to his house. Even so, the text adds, he who has a competent spiritual Master is able to free himself from the blindfolds of ignorance and finally attains perfection. Fifteen centuries later, Sailkara (? 788-820) commented brilliantly on this passage from the Chtindogya. To be sure, the famous Vedantist metaphysician explains the fable in terms of his own system, absolute monism, but his exegesis only elaborates and clarifies the original meaning. Such is the case, Sailkara .writes, with the man whom thieves have carried far away from Being (from titman-brahman) and caught in the trap ofthis body. The thieves are false ideas ("merit," "demerit," etc.). His eyes are covered with the blindfold of illusion, and he is fettered by the desire that he feels for his wife, his son, his friend, his herds, etc. "I am the son of so-and-so, I am happy or unhappy, I am intelligent or stupid, I am pious, etc. How ought I to live? Or is there a way to escape? Where is my salvation?" So he reasons, caught in a monstrous net, until the moment he encounters one who is conscious of the true Being (brahman-titman), who is delivered from slavery, is happy, and, in addition, is full of sympathy for others. From him he learns the way of knowledge and the vanity of the world. Thus the man, who was the prisoner of his own illusions, is freed from his dependence on worldly things. Recognizing now his true being, he understands that he is not the strayed vagabond he believed himself to be. On the contrary, he understands what Being is: it is that which he too is. Thus his eyes are freed from the blindfold of illusion created by ignorance (avidyti), and he is like the man in the fable, who returns to his house (that is, finds the titman) full of joy and serenity.8
8. See Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 132 ff., on the analogies between these Indian symbolisms of captivity and deliverance from bonds, on the one hand, and certain aspects of Gnostic mythology on the other. See also below, § 229.



48 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
The MaUri Upani~ad (4.2) compares him who is still immersed in the human condition to one "bound by the chains produced by the fruits of good and evil," shut up in a prison or "intoxicated with alcohol" ("the alcohol of errors"), or plunged in darkness (the darkness of passion), or the victim of an illusory sleight-ofhand or of a dream that produces phantasmagorias-and it is for this reason that he no longer remembers the "highest state." Suffering, which defines the human condition, is the result of unknowing (avidya). As the fable commented on by Sankara shows, man suffers from the consequences of this unknowing until the day he discovers that he was only seemingly mired in the world. So, too, for Srupkhya and Yoga, the Self has nothing to do with the world (cf. §139).
It could be said that, after the Upanishads, Indian religious thought identifies deliverance with an "awakening" or with gaining consciousness of a situation that existed from the beginning but that one was unable to realize. Unknowing-which is, in fact, an ignorance ofoneself-can be compared to a "forgetting" of the true Self (atman, puru~a). Gnosis Uiiana, vidya), by abolishing ignorance or tearing the veil of maya, makes deliverance possible; true "knowledge" is equivalent to an "awakening." The Buddha is supremely the Awakened One.
137. mstory of ideas and chronology of texts
Except for the early Upanishads, all the other Indian religious and philosophical texts were composed after the Buddha's preaching. At times the influence of certain characteristically Buddhist ideas is discernible. A number of works composed in the first centuries of the Christian era are concerned, among other things, with criticizing Buddhism. However, the importance of chronology must not be exaggerated. In general, every Indian philosophical treatise9 includes concepts earlier than the
9. It should be noted that Sanskrit does not possess a word that exactly corresponds to the European term "philosophy." A particular philosophical system is called a darsana, "a point of view, vision, comprehension, doctrine, way of considering" (from the root dt;s. "to see, to contemplate, to understand").



Presystematic Vedanta 49
date of its composition and often very old. When a new interpretation appears in a philosophical text, this does not mean that it was not conceived earlier. It is sOD;)etimes possible to determine, though at best only approximately, the date ofcomposition ofcertain texts (and this only from the first centuries of our era), but it is almost impossible to establish the chronology of philosophical ideas. 10 In short, the fact that the religious and philosophical writings belonging to the Brahmanic tradition were composed some centuries after Gautama Buddha does not mean that they reflect conceptions articulated in the Buddhist period. During his apprenticeship, Gautama had encountered certain representatives of the various philosophical "schools," in which it is possible to recognize the embryonic forms of Vedanta (Le., the doctrine ofthe Upanishads) and ofSaqtkhya and Yoga (§ 148). For our purpose nothing would be gained by retracing the stages that separate these first outlines-documented in the Upanishads and the Buddhist and Jaina writings-from their systematic expressions in the classic period. It will suffice to indicate the most important transformations, to point out the modifications that radically changed the initial orientation. But it must not be forgotten that, after the period of the Upanishads, all methods and soteriologies share a common categorical framework. The sequence avidya-karman-san:zsara, the equation existence = suffering, the interpretation of ignorance as sleep, dream, intoxication, captivity-this constellation of concepts, symbols, and images was unanimously accepted. The Satapatha Brahmaf}a had proclaimed: "Man is born into a world put together by himself" (6. 2. 2. 27). It could be said that the three darsanas characteristic of Brahmanism-Vedanta, Saqtkhya, and Yoga-together with Buddhism, merely endeavor to explain this axiom and elucidate its consequences.
138. Presystematic Vedanta
The term vedanta (literally, "end of the Veda") designated the Upanishads, which were in fact placed at the end of the Vedic

50 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
texts.1\ In the beginning the Vedanta signified the sum of the doctrines presented in the Upanishads. It was only progressively, and comparatively late (first centuries of our era), that the term became the specific appellation of a philosophical "system" opposed to the other darsanas, especially to the classic Sarpkhya and Yoga. Our analysis of the Upanishadic doctrines has already set forth the governing ideas of presystematic Vedanta. As for the Vedantist "philosophical system" properly speaking, its earliest history is unknown. The oldest work that has been preserved, the Brahma Sutra, attributed to the r~i Badarayal}a, was probably composed at the beginning of our era. But it was certainly not the first, for Badarayal}a cites the names and ideas of numerous authors who preceded him. For example, discussing the relations between the individual iitmans and brahman, BadarayaQa refers to three different theories, and he gives the names of their most famous representatives. According to the first theory, iitman and brahman are identical; according to the second, until deliverance, iitman and brahman are completely different and separate; according to the third Vedantist master, the iitmans are of divine essence but are not identical with the brahman (Br. Sutra 1. 3. 21).
In discussing the theories previously advanced, Badarayal}a very probably intended to set forth a doctrine proclaiming brahman as the material and efficient cause of all that exists and, at the same time, as the basis of the individual iitmans-a doctrine that, nevertheless, admitted that the delivered ones continue to exist externally as autonomous spiritual beings. Unfortunately, comprehending the 555 aphorisms that make up the Brahma Sutra is very difficult without commentaries. Remarkably concise and enigmatic, these sutras served only as a mnemonic device; their meaning had to be elucidated by a master. But the earliest commentaries were forgotten, and finally disappeared, as a result of the inspired interpretation provided by Sankara, about A.D. 800. We know only the names of some authors and a few quotations from them.12
11. The term vedanta already appears in the MU'!ifaka Up. (3. 2. 6) and in the SvetiiSvatara Up. (6. 22).

Presystematic Vedanta 51
However, in the Svetasvatara and Mailri Upanishads, in the Bhagavad Gfta and the Mok~adharma (book 12 of the Mahabharata), we find an adequate number of indications concerning the general outlines ofVedantist thought before Sailkara. The doctrine of maya acquires primary importance. It is above all the relations among brahman, the creation, and maya that give rise to reflection. The old conception of the cosmic creation as a manifestation of the magical power (maya) of the brahman yields to the role conferred on maya in the experience of each individual, especially that of his blindness. In the last analysis, maya is assimilated to unknowing (avidya) and compared to dreaming. The multiform "realities" of the external world are as illusory as the contents of dreams. The tendency (already documented in E.g Veda 10. 129) to totalize the real in God, that is, in the One/All, leads to more and more daring formulas. If Being is the eternal unity/totality, not only the cosmos, i.e., the multiplicity of objects, is illusory (maya), but the plurality of spirits is equally so. Two generations before Sailkara, the Vedantist master Gau<;tapada maintains that belief in the plurality of individual atmans is engendered by maya (see MafJ,Qilkya Karika 2. 12 and 19). In fact, only one Being-brahman-exists, and when the sage, by a meditation of yogic type, experientially grasps his own atman, he awakens in the light and the bliss of an eternal present. As we have seen (§ 81), the identity brahman-atman constitutes the most important discovery of the Upanishads. But after the criticisms advanced by the Buddhist doctors, the Vedantist masters were obliged to provide a systematic and rigorous foundation for their ontology, which was at once a theology, a cosmology, and, finally, a soteriology. In this effort to rethink the Upanishadic inheritance and to formulate it in accordance with the needs of his time, Sailkara remains unequaled. However, despite his magnificent accomplishment and the great influence of his thought in the history of Indian spirituality, Sailkara did not exhaust the mystical and philosophical possibilities of Vedanta. For several centuries after him, numerous masters will elaborate parallel systems. Besides, Vedanta differs from the other darsanas by the fact that it did not end its creativity in the period of the Sfttras and their first commentaries. Thus, while it may



52 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
be said that the essential aspects of the SaIpkhya and Yoga "philosophical systems" were set forth between the fourth and eighth centuries, Vedanta experiences its true flowering from Sailkara onY
139. The spirit according to Sal!lkhya-Yoga
Long before the systematic articulation of the SaIpkhya "philosophy," its characteristic terminology is documented in the Ka{ha Upani~ad, 14 that is, in the fourth century B.C. The
Svetiisvatara Upani~ad, which is probably later, contains numerous references to SaIpkhya-Yoga principles and employs the technical vocabulary peculiar to those two darsanas. But little is known about the history of SaIpkhya doctrines until the appearance of the first systematic treatise, whose author is
isvarakr~I)a (probably of the fifth century of our era). In any case, the problem belongs, rather, to the history of Indian philosophy. For our purpose it is enough to say that presystematic SaIpkhya-as it can be reconstructed, for example, from certain passages in the Mok~adharma-is proclaimed as the saving gnosis par excellence, side by side with the eminently practical discipline of Yoga. In short, SaIpkhya continues the Upanishads in insisting on the decisive role of knowledge in obtaining deliverance. The originality of the earliest SaIpkhya masters consists in their conviction that true "science" presupposes a strict analysis of the structures and dynamisms of nature, of life, and of psychomental activity, completed by a sustained effort to grasp the unique modality of spirit (puru~a). Even in the classic period-that is, at the time when isvarakr~I)a's Siif'(lkhya Kiirikii and Patafijali's Yoga Sutra were composed-the theoretical outlines of the two darsanas were quite similar. Two essential differences are apparent: (1) while classic SaIpkhya is atheistic, Yoga is theistic, since it postulates the existence of a Lord (isvara); (2) whereas, according to SaIpkhya, the only way to obtain deliverance is that of meta
13. This is why we have deferred our presentation of the different systems of classic Vedanta until the third volume of the present work. 14. See, for example, Karha Up. 2. 18-19,22-23; 3. 3-4, 10-11; 7. 7-9; etc.



The spirit according to SiiT[lkhya- Yoga 53
physical knowledge, Yoga assigns considerable importance to techniques of meditation. The other differences are negligible. Hence the Sarpkhya doctrines that we shall briefly present can be considered equally valid for the theoretical aspects of Pataftjali's Yoga Sutra. ls For Sarpkhya and Yoga, the world is real (not illusory, as it is, for example, for Vedanta). Nevertheless, if the world exists and endures, it owes its existence and endurance to the "ignorance" ofthe spirit (puru~a). The countless forms of the cosmos, together with their process of manifestation and development, exist only insofar as the spirit, the Self, is ignorant of itself and, because of this "nescience," suffers and is enslaved. At the precise moment that the Self finds deliverance, the Creation as a whole will be reabsorbed into the primordial substance (prakrti).
Just like the titman of the Upanishads, the puru~a is inexpressible. Its "attributes" are negative. The Self "is that which sees [stik~in, literally, 'witness']; it is isolated, indifferent, a mere inactive spectator" (Stilflkhya Ktirikti 19). "Autonomy" and "impassibility" are traditional epithets of spirit, constantly repeated in the texts. Being irreducible, devoid of qualities, puru~a has no "intelligence," for it is without desires. Desires are not eternal, hence they do not belong to spirit. Spirit is eternally free, "states of consciousness," the flux of psychomentallife, being foreign to it. 16 Now this conception of puru~a at once raises difficulties. For if spirit is eternally pure, impassive, autonomous, and irreducible, how can it consent to let itself be involved in psychomental experience? And how is such a relation possible? We may profitably postpone an examination of the solution that Sarpkhya and Yoga propose for this problem until we have become better acquainted with the possible relationships between the Self and nature. For the moment we shall state that neither the origin nor the cause of this paradoxical situation-i.e., of this strange relation that connects the puru~a with prakrti-has been the object of formal debate in Sarpkhya-Yoga. The cause and the origin of

54 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
this association between spirit and experience are the two aspects of a problem that the Sarpkhya-Yoga masters regard as insoluble because it exceeds the present capacity of human comprehension. Man, that is, knows and understands by means of the "intellect," buddhi. But this intellect itself is only a productextremely refined, to be sure-of the primordial substance (prakrti). Being a product of nature, a "phenomenon," buddhi can enter into relations of knowledge only with other phenomena; in no case can it know the Self, for it cannot have any kind of relation with a transcendental reality. The cause, as well as the origin, of the paradoxical association between the Self and life (that is, matter) could therefore be understood only by an instrument of knowledge that did not in any way involve matter. Now such knowledge is impossible in the present human condition. Sarpkhya-Yoga knows that the cause of suffering is "nescience," in other words, the confusion of spirit with psychomental activity. But the precise moment when this metaphysical ignorance made its appearance cannot be established, just as it is impossible to fix the date of creation. To attempt to find a solution for this problem is vain. It is, in fact, a wrongly stated problem; and, according to an old Brahmanic custom (see Sailkara ad Vedanta Sutra 3. 2. 17)more than once observed by the Buddha himself-to a wrongly posed problem one replies by silence.
140. The meaning of Creation: Helping in the deliverance of spirit
Substance (prakrtl) is as real and as eternal as spirit (puru~a); but, unlike puru~a, it is dynamic and creative. Though perfectly homogeneous, this primordial substance possesses, so to speak, three "modes of being," which allow it to manifest itself in three different ways and which are called gUf}as: (1) sattva (modality of luminosity and intelligence); (2) rajas (modality of motor energy and mental activity); (3) tamas (modality of static inertia and psychomental obscurity). So the gUf}as have a twofold nature: objective on the one hand, since they constitute the phe



The meaning of Creation 55
nomenaofthe external world, and, on the other hand, subjective, since they support, nourish, and condition psychomentallife. As soon as it departs from its original state of perfect equilibrium and assumes specific characteristics conditioned by its "teleological instinct" (to which we shall return), prakrti passes from the state of mahat to that of ahalflkiira, which means: uniform apperceptive mass, still without "personal" experience but with the obscure consciousness of being an ego (whence the term aham = ego). Starting from this apperceptive mass, the process of "development" bifurcates in two opposite directions, one of which leads to the world of objective phenomena, the other to that of subjective (sensible and psychomental) phenomena. In consequence, the universe-objective or SUbjective-is only the transformation of an original stage of nature, ahalflkara, when, for the first time, a presentiment of ego arose in the energetic mass. By a twofold process of development, the ahalflkiira created a twofold universe: inner and outer, these two worlds having elective correspondences between them. Thus man's body, as well as his physiological functions, his senses, his "states of consciousness," and even his "intelligence," are all of them creations of one and the same substance: the one that produced the physical world and its structures (cf. § 75). We should note the capital importance that Sfupkhya-Yoga, like nearly all Indian systems, accords to the principle of individuation through "consciousness of self." The genesis of the world is a quasi-"psychic" act. Objective and psychophysiological phenomena have a common matrix, the only difference that separates them being the formula of the gUfJas, sattva predominating in psychomental phenomena, rajas in psychophysiological phenomena (passion, activity of the senses, etc.), while the phenomena of the material world are constituted by the increasingly dense and inert products of tamas (atoms, vegetable and animal organisms, etc.).l? With this physiological foundation, we understand why Sarp.khya-Yoga regards all psychic experi
17. Sarpkbya-Yoga also offers a subjective interpretation of the three gUT}as when it considers their psychic "aspects." When sattva predominates, the consciousness is calm, clear, comprehensible, virtuous; dominated by rajas, it is agitated, uncertain, unstable; overwhelmed by tamas, it is obscure, confused, passionate, bestial (see Yoga Sutra 2. 15. 19).



56 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
ence as a simple "material" process. Morality is affected; goodness, for example, is not a quality of spirit but a "purification" of the "subtle matter" represented by consciousness. The gUIJas impregnate the whole universe and establish an organic sympathy between man and the cosmos. In fact, the difference between the cosmos and man is a difference only of degree, not of essence.
By virtue ofits progressive "development" (pariIJiima), matter has produced infinite forms, increasingly complex, increasingly varied. Sii111khya believes that such an immense creation, such a complicated edifice of forms and organisms, demands a justification and a meaning outside of itself. A primordial, formless, and eternally unmoving prakt;ti can have a meaning. But the world as we see it presents, on the contrary, a considerable number of different forms and structures. The morphological complexity of the cosmos is raised by Sii111khya to the rank of a metaphysical argument. For common sense tells us that every compound exists in view of another. Thus, for example, a bed is a whole composed of various parts, but this provisional articulation among the parts is effected in view of man (SiirtZkhya Kiirikii 17).
Sii111khya-Yoga thus brings out the teleological nature of Cre
ation; for if the Creation did not have the mission of serving spirit, it would be absurd, without meaning. Everything in nature is "composite"; so everything must have a "superintendent," someone who can make use of these compounds. This superintendent cannot be either mental activity or states of consciousness (themselves extremely complex products of prakt;ti). This is the first proof of the existence of spirit: "knowledge of the existence of spirit by combination for the profit of another."ls Although the Self (puru~a) is veiled by the illusions and confusions of cosmic Creation, prakt;ti is dynamized by the "teleological instinct" that is wholly intent on the deliverance ofpuru~a. For, "from Brahman to the last blade of grass, the Creation is for the benefit of spirit until spirit has attained supreme knowledge" (SiirtZkhya Sutra 3. 47).

The meaning of deliverance 57
141. The meaning of deliverance
If the Satpkhya-Yoga philosophy does not explain either the cause or the origin ofthe strange association established between spirit and the' 'states of consciousness," it nevertheless attempts to explain the nature of their association. It is not a matter of real relations in the strict sense of the word, such as exist, for example, between external objects and perceptions. But-and for Satpkhya-Yoga, it is the key to this paradoxical situationthe most subtle, most transparent part of mental life, that is, intelligence (buddhi) in its mode of pure luminosity (sattva), has a specific quality: that of reflecting spirit. However, the Self is not corrupted by this reflection and does not lose its ontological modalities (eternity, impassivity, etc.). Just as a flower is reflected in a crystal, the intelligence reflects puru~a (see Yoga Sutra 1. 41). But only an ignorant person can attribute to the crystal the qualities of the flower (form, dimensions, color). When the object moves, its image moves in the crystal, though the latter remains motionless. From all eternity, spirit has found itself drawn into this illusory relation with psychomental experience, that is, with life and matter. This is owing to ignorance (Y.S. 2. 24), and, as long as avidya persists, existence is there, because of karman, and, with existence, suffering. Ignorance consists in confusion between the motionless and eternal puru~a and the flux of psychomental life. To say: "I suffer," "I want," "I hate," "I know," and to think that this "I" refers to spirit, is to live in illusion and perpetuate it. This means that every act whose point of departure lies in illusion is either the consummation of a power created by a preceding act or the projection of another force that in its tum demands its actualization, its consummation in this present existence or in an existence to come. This is, in fact, the law of existence. Like every law, it is transsubjective, but its validity and its universality are at the origin of the suffering by which existence is troubled. For Satpkhya, as for the Upanishads, there is only one way to gain salvation: adequate knowledge of spirit. And the first stage in acquiring this saving knowledge consists in one thing: to deny that spirit has attributes. This is equivalent to denying suffering



58 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
as something that concerns US, to regarding it as an objective fact, outside of spirit, that is, devoid of value, of meaning (since all "values" and "meanings" are created by the intelligence). Pain exists only to the extent that experience is referred to the human personality regarded as identical with the Self. But since this relation is illusory, it can easily be abolished. When spirit is known and assumed, values are annulled; pain is then no longer either pain or nonpain but a mere fact. From the moment we understand that the Self is free, eternal, and inactive, everything that happens to us-pain, feelings, volition, thoughts, etc.-no longer belongs to us.
Knowledge is a simple "awakening" that unveils the essence of the Self. This knowledge is not obtained by experience but by a kind of revelation: it instantaneously reveals the ultimate reality. How, then, is it possible that deliverance is realized by the collaboration of prakrti? Saipkhya replies with the teleological argument: matter instinctively acts in view of the enfranchisement of the puru~a. The intelligence (buddhi,) being the most subtle man.ifestation of prakrti, facilitates the process of deliverance by serving as the preliminary stage of revelation. As soon as this self-revelation is realized, the intelligence, as well as all the other psychomental (hence material) elements that are wrongly attributed to puru~a, withdraw, detach themselves from spirit, and are reabsorbed into substance, like a "dancer who departs after satisfying her master's desire." 19 "Nothing is more sensitive than prakrti; as soon as it has said to itself 'I am recognized,' it no longer shows itself before the eyes of the Spirit" (Sam. Kar. 61). This is the state of the man who is "liberated in this life" (jlvan-mukta): the sage lives on, because his karmic residue remains to be consumed (just as the potter's wheel continues to turn from the velocity it has acquired, although the pot is already finished [Sam. Kar. 67; Sarrz. Siltra 3. 82]). But when, at the moment of death, it abandons the body, the spirit (puru~a) is completely "liberated" (Sam. Kar. 68). Saipkhya-Yoga has, then, understood that spirit can neither be born nor be destroyed; that it is neither enslaved nor inactive
19. This comparison is very frequent, both in the Mahiibhiirata and in the SaIp.khya treatises; see Siif?lkhya Kiirikii 59, Siif?lkhya Siltra 3. 69.



Yoga: Concentration on a single object 59
(i. e., actively seeking deliverance); that it neither thirsts for freedom nor is "liberated" (GauQapada, MiifJ4ilkya Kiirikii 2. 32). "Its mode is such that these two possibilities are excluded" (Siirrtkhya Siltra 1. 160). The Self is pure, eternal, and free; it cannot be enslaved because it cannot have relations with anything except itself. But man believes that the puru~a is enslaved and thinks that it can be liberated. These are illusions of our psychomentallife. Ifliberation seems to us a drama, it is because we adopt a human point of view. In reality, spirit is only a "spectator," just as "liberation" (mukti) is only a becoming-conscious of spirit's eternal freedom. Suffering simply ceases as soon as we understand that it is outside of spirit, that it concerns only the human "personality" (asmitii). Sarpkhya-Yoga reduces the infinite variety of phenomena to a single principle, matter (prak(tl), and sees the physical universe, life, and consciousness as all deriving from a single source. This doctrine, however, postulates the plurality of spirits, though by their nature these are essentially identical. Thus SarpkhyaYoga unites what might appear to be so different-the physical, the vital, and the mental-and isolates what, especially in India, seems unique and universal: spirit. Eachpuru~a, indeed, is completely isolated; for the Self can have no contact either with the world or with other spirits. The cosmos is peopled by these eternal, free, motionless puru~as-monads between which no communication is possible. In short, we are offered a tragic and paradoxical conception of spirit-and one that has been vigorously attacked both by Buddhist doctors and by Vedantist masters.
142. Yoga: Concentration on a single object
The earliest precise references to Yoga techniques appear in the BrahmaI}.as and especially in the Upanishads. But even as early as the Vedas there is mention of certain ascetics and ecstatics who command a number of parayogic practices and enjoy "miraculous powers" (§ 78). Since the term yoga came quite early to designate any ascetic technique and any method of meditation, we find yogic practices widespread in India, both in Brah



60 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
manic circles and among the Buddhists and the Jains. But alongside this presystematic and pan-Indian Yoga, a yogadarsana, "classic" Yoga, as it was later formulated by Patafijali in his Yoga Sutra, gradually takes form. This author himself admits (Y.S. 1. 1) that, in general, he is only collecting and publishing the doctrinal and technical traditions of Yoga. As for Patafijali, nothing is known of him. We do not even know whether he lived in the second century B.C. or in the third, or even the fifth, century of our era. Among the technical formulas preserved by tradition, he retained those that an experience of centuries had sufficiently tested. As for the theoretical framework and the metaphysical foundation that Patafijali provides for these practices, his personal contribution is of the smallest. He simply rehandles the SaIpkhya doctrine in its broad outlines, adapting it to a rather superficial theism. Classic Yoga begins where SaIpkhya ends. For Patafijali does not believe that metaphysical knowledge alone can lead man to liberation. Knowledge only prepares the ground for the conquest offreedom; freedom is obtained by means of an ascetic technique and a method of meditation. Patafijali defines Yoga as "the suppression of the states of consciousness" (Y.S. 1. 2). These "states of consciousness" (cittaV/:ttis) are infinite in number, but they all fall into three categories, corresponding, respectively, to three possibilities of experience: (1) errors and illusions (dreams, hallucinations, errors of perception, confusions, etc.); (2) the totality of normal psychological experiences (everything that is felt, perceived, or thought by one who does not practice Yoga); and (3) the parapsychological experiences triggered by yogic technique and, of course, accessible only to the initiated. The goal of Patafijali's Yoga is to abolish the first two categories of experience (produced, respectively, by logical error and metaphysical error) and to replace them by an enstatic, suprasensory, and extrarational "experience." In contrast to SaIpkhya, Yoga sets itself the task of destroying, one by one, the different groups, species, and varieties of "states of consciousness" (cittavrttis). Now this destruction cannot be achieved unless one begins by knowing "experimentally," as it were, the structure, origin, and intensity of what is to be destroyed. "Experimental knowledge" here means: method, tech

nique, practice. One can gain nothing without acting and without practicing asceticism: this is a leitmotiv of yogic literature. Books 2 and 3 of the Yoga Siitra are more especially devoted to this yogic activity (purifications, bodily postures, breathing techniques, etc.). The cittaV1:ttis (literally "eddies of consciousness") cannot be controlled and, finally, abolished if they are not first known "experimentally." It is only through experiences that one obtains freedom. 20 The cause of the vrttis that make up the psychomental stream is, of course, ignorance (Y.S. 1. 8). But, for Yoga, abolition of metaphysical ignorance does not suffice to destroy the states of consciousness. For even when the present "eddies" are destroyed, others would immediately come to replace them, welling up from the immense reserves of "latencies" (viisaniis) buried in the subconscious. The concept of viisanii is of prime importance in Yoga psychology. The obstacles that these subliminal forces raise on the road that leads to liberation are of two kinds: on the one hand, the viisaniis constantly feed the psychomental stream, the endless series of cittaV1:ttis; on the other hand, by virtue of their specific (subliminal) modality, the viisaniis are hard to control and master. Thus the yogin-even if he has the advantage of long-continued practice-is in danger of being defeated by the invasion of a powerful stream of psychomental "eddies" precipitated by the viisaniis. For destruction of the cittavrttis to succeed, it is necessary that the subconsciousnessconsciousness circuit be broken. The point of departure of Yoga meditation is concentration (ekiigratii) on a single object. This object can equally well be a physical object (the point between the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, a luminous object, etc.), a thought (a metaphysical truth), or God (Isvara). The ekiigratii exercise seeks to control the two generators of mental fluidity: sensory activity and the activity of the subconscious. It goes without saying that concentration on a single object cannot be accomplished except by the use of numerous exercises and techniques, in which physiology plays
a capital role. Ekiigratii cannot be obtained, for example, if the

body is in a tiring or merely uncomfortable position or if the respiration is disorganized, that is, nonrhythmical. This is why Yoga technique includes several categories of psychophysiological practices and spiritual exercises, called ahgas ("members"). These "members" of Yoga can be regarded both as forming a group of techniques and as being stages of the ascetic and spiritual itinerary whose final goal is liberation. The Yoga Sutra (2. 29) presents a list that has become classic: (1) the restraints (yamas); (2) the disciplines (niyamas); (3) the bodily postures (dsanas); (4) control of respiration (priifJiiyiima); (5) emancipation from the activity of the senses, from the ascendancy of external objects (pratyiihiira); (6) concentration (dhiirafJ,ii); (7) yogic meditation (dhyiina); (8) enstasis (samiidhi).
143. Techniques of Yoga
The first two groups of practices, yama and niyama, constitute the inevitable preliminaries to any kind of asceticism. There are five "restraints" (yamas), namely, ahilflsii ("not to kill"), satya ("not to lie"), asteya ("not to steal"), brahmacarya ("sexual abstinence"), and aparigraha ("not to be avaricious" [see Y.S. 2. 30]). These restraints do not bring about a yogic state but a "purified" state, superior to that of the uninitiated. In conjunction with them, the yogin must practice the niyamas, that is, a series of bodily and psychic disciplines. "Cleanliness, serenity, asceticism (tapas), study of Yoga metaphysics, and an effort to make God (Isvara) the motive of all his actions constitute the disciplines," writes Patafijali (Y.S. 2. 32).21 It is only with the practice of iisana that yogic technique properly speaking begins. Asana designates the well-known yogic posture that Y.S. 2. 46 defines as "stable and agreeable." We here have one ofthe characteristic practices ofIndian asceticism, documented in the Upanishads and even in Vedic literature. What matters is to keep the body in the same position without
21. "Cleanliness" also means the inner purification of the organs (which is especially insisted upon by Hatha Yoga). "Serenity" implies "absence of the desire to increase the necessities of existence." Tapas consists in tolerating contraries, such as heat and cold, etc.



Techniques of Yoga 63
effort, for only then does iisana facilitate concentration. "Posture becomes perfect when the effort to realize it disappears," writes Vyasa (ad Y.S. 2. 47). "He who practices iisana must employ an effort that consists in suppressing the natural bodily efforts" (Wtcaspati, ibid.). .tisana is the first step taken toward abolition of the modalities peculiar to human existence. On the bodily plane, iisana is an ekiigratii, a concentration on a single point: the body is "concentrated" in a single position. Just as ekiigratii puts an end to the fluctuations and dispersion of the "states of consciousness," so iisana puts an end to the mobility and availability of the body by reducing the multitude of possible positions to a single motionless, hieratic posture. Furthermore, a tendency toward "unification" and "totalization" is typical of all yogic practices. Their goal is the transcendence (or the abolition) of the human condition, resulting from the refusal to obey one's natural inclinations. If iisana illustrates refusal to move, prii1')iiyiima, the discipline of the breath, is the refusal to breathe like the run of mankind, that is, arhythmically. The uninitiated man's respiration varies in accordance either with circumstances or with his psychomental tension. This irregularity produces a dangerous psychic fluidity and, hence, instability and dispersal of attention. One can become attentive by making an effort. But, for Yoga, effort is an "exteriorization." So, by means ofprii1')iiyiima, the attempt is made to suppress respiratory effort: achieving rhythmical respiration must become automatic, so that the yogin can forget it. A late commentator, Bhoja, observes that "there is always a connection between respiration and the mental states" (ad Y.S. 1. 34). This observation is important. The relation that unites the rhythm of respiration with the states of consciousness was no doubt experienced experimentally by yogins from the very earliest times. In all probability, this relation served them as an instrument for "unifying" consciousness. By making his respiration rhythmical and progressively slower, the yogin is able to "penetrate"-that is, to experience in his own person and with complete lucidity-certain states of consciousness that in the waking state are inaccessible, and particularly the states of consciousness that are characteristic of sleep. The respiratory



64 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
rhythm of a man asleep is slower than that of a man awake. In achieving, by virtue of priiIJiiyiima, this rhythm of sleep, the yogin-though without sacrificing his lucidity-can penetrate the states of consciousness typical of sleep. Indian psychology knows four modalities of consciousness: diurnal consciousness, the consciousness of sleep with dreams, the consciousness of dreamless sleep, and "cataleptic consciousness" (turiya). Each of these modalities of consciousness is related to a specific respiratory rhythm. By means of priiIJiiyiima, that is, by increasingly prolonging exhalation and inhalationthe goal of this practice being to leave as long an interval as possible between these two moments of respiration22-the yogin can pass without discontinuity from the consciousness of the waking state to the three other modalities.
Asana, priiIJiiyiima, and ekiigratii have succeeded in suspending the human condition, if only during the time that the exercise continues. Motionless, making his respiration rhythmical, fixing his gaze and his attention on a single point, the yogin is "concentrated," "unified." He can test the quality of his concentration by pratyiihiira, a term usually translated by "withdrawal of the senses" or "abstraction" but which we prefer to translate by "ability to free sense activity from the domination of external objects." Instead of turning toward objects, the senses "abide within themselves" (Bhoja, ad Y.S. 2. 54). Pratyiihiira can be regarded as the ultimate stage of psychophysiological asceticism. Henceforth the yogin will no longer be "distracted" or "troubled" by the activity of the senses, by memory, etc. Autonomy in respect to the stimuli of the external world and to the dynamism of the subconscious allows the yogin to practice
22. The rhythm of respiration is obtained by harmonizing the three "moments": inhalation, exhalation, and holding-in the air. Through practice the yogin arrives at prolonging each of these moments for a considerable time. The goal of priifJiiyiima being as long a suspension of respiration as possible, the yogin begins by arresting the breath for sixteen and a half seconds, then for thirty-five seconds, fifty seconds, three minutes, five minutes, and so on. Rhythmicization and retention of the breath also play an important part in Taoist practices, among the Muslim mystics, and in the methods of prayer employed by the hesychastic monks. See Eliade, Yoga, pp. 53-59,431-32.



The role of the God in Yoga 65
concentration and meditation. Dhiiraf)ii (from the root dht;, "to hold fast") is in fact a "fixing of the thought on a single point," having as its purpose comprehension. As for yogic meditation, dhyiina, Patafijali defines it as "a current of unified thought" (Y.S. 3. 2). Vyasa adds the following gloss: "Continuum of mental effort to assimilate the object of meditation, free from any other effort to assimilate other objects." There is no need to point out that this yogic meditation differs completely from secular meditation. Dhyiina makes it possible to "penetrate" objects, to "assimilate" them magically. The act of' 'penetration" into the essence of objects is especially difficult to explain; it is to be conceived neither as a species of poetic imagination nor as an intuition of the Bergsonian type. What distinguishes yogic meditation is its coherence, the state of lucidity that accompanies and continues to orient it. Indeed, the "mental continuum" never escapes the yogin's will.
144. The role of the God in Yoga
Unlike SaqIkhya, Yoga affirms the existence of a God, Isvara (literally, "Lord"). This God is, of course, not a creator. But, for certain men, Isvara can hasten the process of deliverance. The Lord whom Patafijali mentions is rather a God of yogins. Only a man who has already chosen Yoga can be helped by him. He can, for example, bring it about that the yogin who takes him as the object of his concentration obtains samiidhi. According to Patafijali (Y.S. 2. 45), this divine aid is not the result ofa "desire" or a "feeling"-for the Lord can have neither desire nor emotion-but of a "metaphysical sympathy" between Isvara and puru~a, a sympathy explained by the correspondence between
their structures. Isvara is a puru~a that has been free from eternity, that has never been touched by the "pains" and "impurities" of existence (Y.S. 1. 24). Vyasa, commenting on this text, explains that the difference between the "enfranchised" spirit and Isvara is as follows: the first has formerly been in some relation (if only illusory) with psychomental existence, whereas Isvara has always been free. God cannot be attracted by rites or devotion or by faith in his "grace," but his "essence" instinc



66 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
tively collaborates (so to speak) with the Self that seeks to enfranchise itself by Yoga. It would seem that this metaphysical sympathy that he shows in respect to certain yogins has exhausted Isvara's capacity to interest himself in the fate of human beings. We get the impressions that Isvara has entered the Yoga darSana from the outside, as it were. For the part that he plays in deliverance is unimportant, since prakt:ti itself undertakes to deliver the numerous "Selves" that are caught in the illusory snares of existence. However, Pataftjali felt a need to introduce God into the dialectic of deliverance because Isvara corresponded to an experiential reality. As we have just said, some yogins obtained samiidhi by "devotion to Isvara" (Y.S. 2. 45). Undertaking to collect and classify all the yogic techniques validated by the "classic tradition," Pataftjali could not neglect a whole series of experiences that only concentration on Isvara had made possible. In other words, side by side with the tradition of a "magical" Yoga, that is, one that called only upon the ascetic's will and forces, there was another, a "mystical" tradition, in which the final stages of Yoga practices were at least made easier by virtue of a devotion-even though extremely rarefied and intellectualtoward a god. In any case, at least as he appears in Pataftjali and in the latter's earliest commentator, Vyasa, Isvara lacks the grandeur of the omnipotent creator god and the emotion proper to the dynamic and serious god of the various mysticisms. Isvara, in short, is only the archetype of the yogin-a macroyogin, very probably the patron of certain yogic sects. Indeed, Pataftjali states that Isvara was the guru of the sages of immemorial times; for, he adds, Isvara is not bound by time (Y.S. 1. 26). It is only the late commentators, Vacaspatimisra (ca. 850) and Vijftanabhik~u (sixteenth century) who attribute any great importance to Isvara, and they lived at a time when the whole of India was permeated by devotional and mystical currents. 23
23. Another late commentator, Nilakal)!ha, affirms that God, though inactive, helps yogins in the manner of a magnet. Nilakal)!ha attributes to Isvara a "will" capable of predetermining the lives of men; for "he makes him do good deeds whom he wants to raise, and he makes him commit bad deeds whom he wants to throw down" (cited by Dasgupta, Yoga as Philosophy and Religion, pp. 88-89). We are far from the modest role that Patafijali assigned to Isvara!



Samadhi and the "miraculous powers" 67
145. SIl",iidhi and the "miraculous powers"
The passage from "concentration" to "meditation" does not require the application of any new technique. Similarly, once the yogin has succeeded in concentrating and meditating, there is no need for any supplementary yogic exercise in order to realize samiidhi. Samiidhi, yogic "enstasis," is the final result and the crown of all the ascetic's spiritual efforts and exercises.24 The term is first employed in a gnoseological sense: samiidhi is that contemplative state in which the thought immediately grasps the form of the object, without the help of categories and the imagination; a state in which the object reveals itself "in itself"
(svarilpa), in its essentiality, and as if it were "empty of itself" (Y.S. 3. 3). There is a real coincidence between knowledge ofthe object and the object of knowledge, for the object, no longer presenting itself to consciousness in the relations that delimit
and define it as a phenomenon, is "as if empty of itself." However, rather than "knowledge,"samiidhi is a "state," an enstatic modality peculiar to Yoga. This "state" makes possible the self-revelation of the Self by virtue of an act that does not constitute an "experience." But it is not any samiidhi that reveals the Self and consequently accomplishes final deliverance. When samiidhi is obtained by fixing the thought on a point in space or on an idea, the enstasis is termed "with support" or "differentiated" (samprajiiiita-samadh,). When, on the contrary, samiidhi is obtained apart from any "relation," that is, when it is simply a complete comprehension of Being, there is "undifferentiated" (asamprajiiiita) enstasis. The first state is a means of deliverance insofar as it makes comprehension of the truth possible and puts an end to suffering. But the second mode of enstasis (asamprajiiiita) destroys the "impressions (sarrzskiira) of all the antecedent mental functions" (Vijiiiinabhik~u) and even succeeds in arresting the karmic forces already set in motion by the yogin's past activity. This enstasis is in fact "ravishment," since it is experienced without being provoked.
24. The meanings of the term samiidhi are: union, totality; absorption in; complete spiritual concentration; conjunction. It is usually translated by "concentration"; but in that case there is a danger of confusion with dhiiraT}ii. That is why we have preferred to translate it by enstasis, stasis, conjunction.



68 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
Obviously, "differentiated enstasis" comprises several stages, for it is perfectible. In these phases "with support," samiidhi proves to be a state obtained by virtue of a certain knowledge.
It is necessary always to remember this passage from "knowledge" to "state," for this is the characteristic feature of all Indian meditation. In samiidhi there is the "rupture of plane" that India seeks to realize-the paradoxical passage from knowing to Being. It is when he has reached this stage that the yogin acquires the "miraculous powers" (siddhis) to which book 3 of the Yoga Sutra is devoted, beginning with sutra 16. By concentrating, by meditating, and by realizing samiidhi in respect to a certain object or a whole class of objects, the yogin acquires certain occult powers concerning the objects experienced. Thus, for example, by concentrating on the subconscious residues (sa'!lskiira), he knows his former lives (Y.S. 3. 18). By the help of other concentrations, he obtains the extraordinary powers (flying, becoming invisible, etc.). Everything that is meditated is-by the magical virtue of meditation-assimilated, possessed. In the Indian conception, renunciation has a positive value. The force that the ascetic obtains by renouncing some pleasure by far exceeds the pleasure he has renounced. By virtue of renunciation, of asceticism (tapas), men, demons, or gods can grow powerful to the point of becoming a threat to the entire universe. To avoid such an increase of sacred force, the gods "tempt" the ascetic. Pataftjali himself refers to celestial temptations (Y.S. 3. 51), and Vyasa gives the following explanations: when the yogin attains the final differentiated enstasis, the gods visit him and say: "Come and rejoice here, in Heaven. These pleasures are desirable, this young maiden is adorable, this elixir abolishes old age, death," and so on. They continue tempting him with celestial women, with supernatural sight and hearing, with the promise of transforming his body into a "body of diamond"in short, they offer him a share in the divine condition (Vyasa, ad Y.S. 3. 51). But the divine condition is still far from absolute freedom. The yogin owes it to himself to reject these "magical mirages," which are "desirable only for the ignorant," and to persevere in his task: obtaining final deliverance.



Final deliverance 69
For as soon as the yogin succumbs to making use ofthe magical powers he has acquired, his possibility of acquiring new forces disappears. According to the whole tradition of classic Yoga, the yogin makes use of the countless siddhis in order to recover the supreme freedom, the asamprajfiiita-samiidhi, but never to obtain mastery over the elements; indeed,.as Pataiijali tells us (3. 37), these powers are "perfections" (this is the literal meaning of the term siddhis) in the waking state, but they are obstacles in the state of samiidhi.25
146. Final deliverance
Vyasa summarizes the passage from samprajfiiita to asamprajfiiita-samiidhi as follows: by the illumination (prajiiii, "wisdom") obtained spontaneously when the yogin arrives at the last stage of samprajiiiita-samiidhi, he realizes "absolute isolation" (kaivalya), that is, liberation of the puru~a from the empire of prakr;ti. It would be a mistake to consider this mode of being of the spirit as a simple trance, in which consciousness is emptied of all content. The "state" and the "knowledge" that this term simultaneously expresses refer to the total absence of objects in the consciousness and in no sense to a consciousness absolutely emptied. For, on the contrary, the consciousness is then saturated by a direct and total intuition of Being. As a late author, Madhava, writes, "nirodha [final arrest of all psychomental experience] must not be imagined as a nonexistence but rather as the support of a particular condition of the spirit." It is the enstasis of total emptiness, an unconditioned state that is no longer "experience" (for in it there is no longer any relation between consciousness and the world) but "revelation." The
25. And yet the nostalgia for the "divine condition" conquered by sheer force, magically, has not ceased to obsess yogins and ascetics. And the more so since, according to Vyasa (ad Y.S. 3. 26), there is a great likeness between certain gods who inhabit the celestial regions (in the brahmaloka) and yogins at the stage of the siddhis. Indeed, the four classes of gods of the brahmaloka have, by their very nature, a "spiritual situation" that corresponds respectively to the four classes of samprajiiiita-samiidhi. By the fact that these gods have stopped at this stage, they have not attained complete deliverance.



70 BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM
intellect (buddhl), having accomplished its mission, withdraws, detaching itself from the puru~a, and reintegrates itself into prakr:ti. The yogin attains to deliverance: he is a jlvan-mukta, one "delivered in life." He no longer lives under the empire of time but in an eternal present, in the nunc stans by which Boethius defined eternity. Obviously, his situation is paradoxical; for he is in life, yet delivered; he has a body, yet he knows himself, and by that fact he is the puru~a; he lives in duration and at the same time shares in immortality. Samiidhi is, by its very nature, a paradoxical state, for it empties being and thought and at the same time fills them to repletion. Yogic enstasis takes its place on a line well known in the history of religions and mysticisms: that of the coincidence of contraries. By samiidhi, the yogin transcends contraries and unites emptiness and fullness, life and death, being and nonbeing. Enstasis is equivalent to a reintegration of the different modalities of the real in a single modality: the primordial nonduality, the undifferentiated plenitude that existed before the bipartition of the real into object-subject. It would be a gross error to regard this supreme reintegration as a simple regression into the primordial indistinction. Deliverance is not assimilable to the "deep sleep" of prenatal existence. The importance that all authors attribute to the yogic states of superconsciousness shows us that the final reintegration is accomplished in that direction and not in a more or less deep "trance." In other words, the recovery through samiidhi of the initial nonduality brings this new element into relationship with the situation that existed before the bipartition of the real into object-subject: the knowledge of unity and bliss. There is "return to the origin," but with the difference that he who is "delivered in life" recovers the original situation enriched by the dimensions of freedom and transconsciousness. He reintegrates the primordial plenitude after having established this new and paradoxical mode of being: consciousness offreedom, which exists nowhere in the cosmos, whether on the planes of life or on the planes of "mythological divinity" (the gods), for it exists only in the absolute Being (brahman). It is tempting to see in this ideal-the conscious conquest of freedom-the justification proposed by Indian thought for the



Final deliverance 71
fact, which at first sight seems absurd and cruelly useless, that the world exists, that man exists, and that his existence in the world is an unbroken series of illusions and suffering. For, by liberating himself, man establishes the spiritual dimension of freedom and "introduces" it into the cosmos and life, that is, into modes of existence that are blind and wretchedly conditioned. However, this absolute freedom was conquered at the price of a complete negation of life and of the human personality. So radical a negation demanded the Buddha in order to attain nirvafJa. But these extreme and exclusive solutions could not exhaust the resources of the Indian religious genius. As we shall see (§§ 193-94), the Bhagavad Gila offers another method of obtaining deliverance, one that does not require renunciation of the world as its price.



18 The Buddha and
His Contemporaries
147. Prince Siddhirtha
Buddhism is the only religion whose founder declares himself to be neither the prophet of a god nor his emissary and who, in addition, rejects the idea of a God-Supreme Being. But he proclaims himself "awakened" (buddha) and hence guide and spiritual master. The goal of his preaching is the deliverance of mankind. It is precisely this rank of "savior" that makes his soteriological message a religion and soon transforms the historical personage, Siddhartha, into a divine being. I say "historical," for despite the theological speculations and the fabulous inventions of the Buddhist doctors, despite certain European interpretations that have seen in Buddha a mythical figure or a solar symbol, there is no reason to deny his historicity. The majority of scholars agree in admitting that the future Buddha was probably born in April or May, 558 B.C. (or, according to another tradition, 567), at Kapilavastu. The son of a minor king, Suddhodana, and his first wife, Maya, he married at the age of sixteen, left the palace at the age of twenty-nine, had the ','supreme and complete Awakening" in April or May, ca. 523 (or ca. 532), and, after preaching during the rest of his life, died in November, ca. 478 (or ca. 487), at the age of eighty. But these few dates and some other events that we shall relate further on do not exhaust the Buddha's biography as it was understood by his disciples. For, once his true identity-that of the Awakened One-was publicly proclaimed and accepted by his disciples, his life was transfigured and received the mythological dimensions typical of the great saviors. This process of



Prince Siddhiirtha 73
"mythologization" increased with time, but it was already at work during the Master's lifetime. Now it is important to keep in mind this fabulous biography, for it was what was creative, not only in Buddhist theology and mythology, but also in devotionalliterature and the plastic arts. Thus, it is said that the future Buddha, the boddhisattva (the "Being awakening"), himself chose his parents when he was a god in the tu-rita-heaven. His conception was said to be immaculate, the boddhisattva entering his mother's right side in the form of an elephant or of an infant six months old. (The ancient versions tell only of the mother's dream: an elephant entering her body.) His gestation is likewise immaculate, for the boddhisattva is enclosed in a stone shrine of precious stones and not in the womb. His birth takes place in a garden; the mother clasps a tree, and the infant emerges from her right side. As soon as he is born, the boddhisattva takes seven steps, facing the North, and utters the lion's "roar," exclaiming, "I am the highest in the world, 1 am the best in the world, 1 am the eldest in the world; this is my last birth; there will not be another life for me henceforth." I The myth ofthe nativity, then, proclaims that, from his birth, the future Buddha transcends the cosmos {he attains the "crest of the world") and abolishes space and time (he is, indeed, "the first" and the "oldest in the world"). Numerous miracles announce the event. When he is presented in a Brahmanic temple, the images of the gods, "having risen from their places, fall at the boddhisattva's feet" and "sing a hymn [in his honor]."2 The child receives from his father the name Siddhartha ("Goal Attained"). Examining his body, the diviners recognize the thirty-two fundamental and the eighty secondary signs of the "great man" (mahiipuru-ra) and declare that he will become a universal sovereign (cakravartin) or a Buddha. An old r-ri, Asita, flies through the air from the Himalayas to Kapilavastu, demands to see the newborn infant, takes him in his arms, and, understanding that he will become Buddha, weeps, knowing that he, Asita, will not live to follow him.

74 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
Seven days after his birth, Maya dies, to be reborn as a god in the tu~ita-heaven. For seven years the child is brought up by his aunt. After that, he receives the education of every Indian prince, and he distinguishes himself both in the branches of knowledge and in physical exercises. At the age of sixteen he marries two princesses from neighboring countries, Gopa and Yasodhara. After thirteen years the latter gives him a son, Rahula. These details, which are embarrassing to th~ ascetic Buddhist tradition, are probably authentic. In any case, Siddhartha fled from the palace soon after Rahula's birth, in conformity with the Indian custom that does not allow renouncing the world until after the birth of a son or grandson. A whole scenario has been elaborated around this Great Departure. According to the earliest texts, the Buddha told his disciples that it was by meditating on old age, sickness, and death that he lost the zest for life and decided to save humanity from those three evils. Legend presents the occurrence more dramatically. Warned by the diviners' predictions, SUddhodana managed to isolate the young prince in his palace and his pleasure gardens. But the gods foiled the father's plan, for on three successive trips to the pleasure gardens, Siddhartha encountered first a decrepit old man leaning on a stick, then, the next day, a sick man, "wasted, livid, burning with fever," and, finally, the third time, a dead man being carried to the cemetery. His coachman tells him that no one can escape from sickness, old age, and death. Finally, on his last trip, the prince sees a mendicant monk, calm and serene, and this vision consoles him, showing him that religion is able to cure the miseries of the human condition.
148. The Great Departure
In order to strengthen his decision to renounce the world, the gods wakened Siddhartha in the middle of the night so that he could behold the naked and graceless bodies of his sleeping concubines. Then he summoned his groom, Chandaka, mounted his horse, and, the gods having put the whole city to sleep, the prince left it by the gate to the Southeast. Having ridden a dozen leagues from Kapilavastu, he stopped, cut off his hair with his



The Great Departure 75
sword, changed clothes with a hunter, and sent Chandaka back to the palace with his horse. When he stopped, he also dismissed the troop of gods who had escorted him until then. Henceforth the gods will play no part in the Buddha's fabulous biography. He will gain his end by his own means, without any supernatural help. Having become a wandering ascetic under the name of Gautama (the name of his family in the Sakya clan), he traveled to Vaisali (Pali: Vesali), where a Brahmanic master, AraQa Kalama, taught a kind of preclassic Satpkhya. He very quickly mastered this doctrine, but, considering it inadequate, he left AraQa and went to Rajagrha, the capital of Magadha. King Bimbisara, attracted by the young ascetic, offered him half his kingdom, but Gautama rejected this temptation and became the disciple of another master, Udraka. With equal ease, he mastered the yogic techniques taught by Udraka but, dissatisfied, left him and, followed by five disciples, traveled. toward Gaya. His philosophical and yogic apprenticeship had gone on for a year. He settled down in a peaceful place near Gaya, where, for six years, he indulged in the most severe mortifications. He reached the point of subsisting on one millet seed a day but later decided on fasting completely; motionless, reduced almost to the state of a skeleton, he finally came to resemble a heap of dust. After these terrible penances he received the title of Sakyamuni ("the ascetic among the Sakyas"). When he reached the utmost limit of mortification and only the thousandth part of his vital power was left to him, he understood the uselessness of asceticism as a means of deliverance and decided to break his fast. Given the great prestige enjoyed by tapasvins everywhere in India, the experience was not useless. Henceforth the future Buddha could proclaim that he had mastered the ascetic practices, just as he had already mastered philosophy (Satpkhya) and Yoga and just as, before he forsook the world, he had experienced all the pleasures of princely life. Nothing of what makes up the infinite variety of human experiences was thus unknown to him-from the delights and disappointments ofculture, oflove, and of power to the poverty of a wandering holy man and the contemplations and trances of the yogin, by way of the solitude and mortifications of the ascetic.



76 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
When Gautama accepted a pious woman's offering of boiled rice, his five ascetic disciples, horrified, left him and set off for Benares. Miraculously restored by this food, Sakyamuni traveled to a forest, chose a pipal tree (asvattha; Ficus religiosa), and sat down at the foot ofit, determined not to rise until he had obtained "awakening." But before sinking into meditation, Sakyamuni underwent the assault of Mara, Death. For that great god had divined that the imminent discovery of salvation, by halting the eternal cycle of births, deaths, and rebirths, would put an end to his rule. The attack was launched by a terrifying army of demons, ghosts, and monsters, but Sakyamuni's earlier merits and his' 'friendly disposition" (maitd) raised a zone of protection around him, and he remained steadfast. Mara then claimed the place under the tree, by virtue of the merits he had gained, long before, as the result of a voluntary sacrifice. Sakyamuni had also accumulated merits in the course of his former lives; but, since he had no witness, he invoked "the impartial mother of all beings," and, with the gesture that has become classic in Buddhist iconography, he touched the earth with his right hand. The Earth showed herself from the waist up and vouched for Sakyamuni's statements. However, Mara, Death, is also Kama, Eros-in the last analysis the Spirit of Life-and it i~ life itself that is equally threatened by the salvation that the boddhisattva is preparing to bestow on the world. Then countless women surrounded the ascetic, vainly seeking to tempt him by their nakedness and their many charms. Conquered, Mara withdrew before nightfall.3
149. The "Awakening." The preaching of the Law
This mythology of Mara's attack and temptation proclaims Sakyamuni's absolute moral purity. He can now concentrate all his spiritual forces on the central problem: deliverance from suffering. During the first watch, he passes through the four stages of meditation, which enable him to embrace, by virtue of

The "Awakening." The preaching of the Law 77
his "divine eye" (§ 158), the totality of worlds and their eternal becoming, that is, the terrifying cycle of births, deaths, and reincarnations governed by karma. In the second watch, he recapitulates his constant former lives and in a few moments contemplates the infinite lives of others. The third watch constitutes the boddhi, the Awakening, for he grasps the law that makes possible this hellish cycle of births and rebirths, the law of the "twelve mutually dependent productions," as it is called (§ 157), and, at the same time, he discovers the conditions necessary to halt these "productions." From thenceforth he possesses the four "Noble Truths": he has become buddha, "the Awakened One," precisely at sunrise. The Buddha remains for seven weeks in the "eyrie of Awakening." Among the fabulous events preserved by tradition, we mention the last temptation by Mara: let the Blessed One enter immediately into parinirviif}a, without proclaiming the doctrine of salvation he had just discovered. But the Buddha replies that he will not enter until he has founded an informed and wellorganized community. However, the Buddha soon afterward asks himself if it is worthwhile teaching so difficult a doctrine. The intervention of Brahma, and especially the certainty that a certain number of human beings are capable of being saved, decide him. He goes to Benares, where, with his "divine eye," he sees the five disciples who had forsaken him. He finds them in a hermitage, on the site of the present Sarnath, and announces to them that he has become Buddha. He expounds the four Noble Truths: on pain, the origin of pain, stopping pain, and the road that leads to the ending of pain (see §159). This first exposition constitutes "setting in motion the wheel of the Law." The five are converted and become "saints" (arhats). The conversion of the son of a banker in Benares, followed by that of the other members of the family, soon occurs. Very soon the community (saftlgha) consists of sixty monks (bhikkhu), and the Buddha sends them to preach individually through the country. For his part, he goes to Uruvilva, where, by a series of prodigies, he succeeds in converting the three Kasyapa brothers, Brahmans who especially venerate the god Agni. The Buddha then addresses Kasyapa's one thousand disciples; he proves



78 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
to them that the whole universe is aflame with the fires of passion. They accept the doctrine, and all become arhats. From then on, conversions mUltiply. At Rajagrha, Bimbisara, the young king of Magadha, gives the Buddha and the community a hermitage. Still at Rajagrha, the Buddha converts two eminent holy monks, Sariputra and Maudgalayana, and an ascetic, MahakMyapa, all three of them destined to playa considerable part in the history of Buddhism. Some time later the Blessed One yields to his father's pleas and, with a great troop of monks, goes to Kapilavastu. The visit is the occasion for many dramatic episodes and fabulous prodigies. The Buddha succeeds in converting his father and many of his relatives. Among them are his cousins: Ananda, thenceforth his principal lay disciple, and Devadatta, who will soon become his rival. The Buddha does not linger at Kapilavastu. He returns to Rajagrha, visits Sravasti and Vaisali, and more or less spectacular conversions continue. When he learns that his father is seriously ill, he again visits him and leads him to holiness. The widowed queen asks her adopted son to admit her into the community. Although he refuses, the queen, with a retinue of princesses, all wanting to become nuns, follows him on foot as far as Vaisali. Ananda pleads her cause, and finally the Buddha accepts her, after giving the nuns rules more stringent than those imposed on the monks. But it is a decision made unwillingly, and he announces that, because of the admission of women, the Law, which should have lasted a thousand years, will last only five hundred. After some of his disciples perform miracles, the Buddha objects to the display of the "marvelous powers" (see § 159). However, he is himself led to perform some of the greatest miracles in the course of his combat with the "six masters," his rivals: now he causes a mango tree to grow, now he walks from the East to the West on a rainbow, or infinitely mUltiplies his own image in the air, or spends three months in the Heaven oflndra in order to preach to his mother. But since the accounts of these fabulous events do not go back to the primitive tradition, it is probable that the prohibition against the "miraculous powers"

(siddhis) and the importance attributed to "wisdom" (prajfiii) as a means of conversion form part of his original teaching.4 As was to be expected, the rival masters ,jealous ofthe Blessed One's success, attempt, but vainly, to discredit him by odious calumnies. Of more consequence are the petty quarrels among the monks, like the one that, nine years after the Awakening, broke out at Kausambi in regard to a detail of the monastic rule (it was a question of knowing whether the washing bowls in the latrines were to be refilled after being used). The Master tried to reconcile the opponents, but he was asked not to bother himself about such matters, and he left Kausambi.5 However, the lay disciples indignantly refused alms to the monks who had brought about the Blessed One's departure, and the recalcitrants were obliged to give in.
150. Devadatta's schism. Last conversion. The Buddha enters parinirvilqa
The sources give us only very vague information concerning the middle period of the Buddha's career. During the rainy season he continued his preaching in the vihiiras (monasteries) near to the cities. The rest of the year, accompanied by his closest disciples, he traveled about the country, preaching the Good Law. In ca. 509, his son Rahula received final ordination. The biographies tell of certain spectacular conversions, such as that of a riddling Yak~a, or of a famous brigand, or of a noble Bengalese merchant; these show that the Master's fame had spread far beyond the districts in which he preached. When the Buddha was seventy-two years of age (in 486 B.C.), his jealous cousin, Devadatta, demanded that he tum over the direction of the community to him. Met with refusal, Devadatta attempted to have him killed, first by hired assassins, then by

having him crushed by a falling rock or a dangerous elephant. Devadatta had instituted a schism with a group of monks by preaching a more radical asceticism; but Sariputra and Maudgalayana were able to call back those who had gone astray, and, according to several sources, Devadatta was precipitated alive into Hell. The Blessed One's last years were darkened by disastrous events, among them the ruin of his clan, the Sakyas, and the death of Sariputra and Maudgalayana. During the rainy season of ca. 478, the Buddha, accompanied by Ananda, settled in the "Village of Bamboos," where he fell seriously ill of dysentery. He survived the crisis, and Ananda rejoiced because' 'the Blessed One would not perish before leaving his instructions concerning the community." But the Buddha replied that he had taught the Law completely, without keeping any truth secret, as certain masters did; he had become a "weak old man," life had reached its end, and henceforth the disciples must tum for help to the Law. However, some sources6 add a significant episode: having returned to VaisaIi, the Buddha rested in the sacred wood of Cipala, and he thrice praised to Ananda the charm of the place and the diversified beauty "of the continent of India," adding that, if asked to do so, the Buddha "can still subsist for a cosmic period or the rest of a cosmic period." But Ananda thrice remained silent, and the Master asked him to go away. Then Mara approached and reminded him of his promise to enter parinirviifJ,a when the salflgha (the community) was firmly established. "Fear not, 0 Evil One," the Buddha replied. "You have not long to wait." Thereupon he renounced the portion of life that remained to him, and the earth shook. Ananda asked his Master the reason for this strange phenomenon and, being told what it was, begged him to live on until the end of the cosmic period. But the Buddha could not go back on the promise he had just given to Mara. "It is your fault, Ananda.... If you had asked it of the Predestined One, 0 Ananda, he would have refused at the first and

the second asking, but the third asking he would have granted. So it is indeed your fault, 0 Ananda."7 He then asked his disciple to gather together the monks who were at VaisaIi, and the two of them went to Papa. There the blacksmith Cunda invited them to a dinner consisting of a "treat of pig" -a dish of pork or of a certain mushroom that pigs delight in. This dish brought on a bloody diarrhea, apparently a recurrence of~he illness from which he had scarcely recovered. Nevertheless, he set off for Kusinagara, capital of the Mallas. Exhausted after a difficult journey, the Buddha lay down on his right side between two trees in a wood, facing West, his head to the North, his left leg lying on his right. Ananda burst into tears, but the dying Blessed One consoled him: "Enough, Ananda; cease to sorrow and to moan.... How can you suppose that what is born does not die? It is absolutely impossible."8 Then, in the presence of them all, he praised Ananda's devotion and assured him that he would attain sainthood. Warned by Ananda, the Mallas crowded around the Blessed One. After converting a monk, Subhadra, the Buddha summoned his disciples and asked them if they still had doubts concerning the Law and the Discipline. All remained silent. Then the Buddha uttered his last words: "It is to you that I address myself, 0 mendicant monks: perishability is the law of things; do not slacken your efforts!" Finally, at the third and last watch of the night, he passed through the four stages of meditation and died. It was the night of the full moon of Kartikka, November, 478 B.C. (or 487, according to another tradition).
As ifto counterbalance so human a death, the Buddha's funeral gave rise to many legends. For seven days of music and dancing the Mallas honored the dead Blessed One, his body wrapped in many cloths and placed in a trough filled with oil, for he is
7. Mahiiparinibbiina Sutta 3. 40, after the translation by Foucher, p. 303. The episode of Ananda's fatal distraction was certainly invented in order to explain the Buddha's death. For, just as he had chosen the circumstances of his birth, the Buddha could prolong his life indefinitely. It was not his fault that he had not done so. However, since neither the legend nor the Buddhist community branded Ananda with infamy, it is clear that the episode was interpolated for apologetic reasons. 8. Mahiiparinibbiina Sutta 5. 14.

accorded the funeral of a king who is a cakravartin. Before its cremation on a pyre of scented wood, the body had been carried in procession through Kusinagara. But the pyre was not lighted before the arrival of the disciple Mahakasyapa, who followed the same road as his master but eight days after him. Since Mahakasyapa became the first head of the community, he had to be present, at least at the Blessed One's cremation. Indeed, according to the legend, the Buddha's feet protruded from the coffin so that the great disciple could venerate them by touching them with his forehead. The pyre then caught fire spontaneously. Since the Blessed One had died in their country, the Mallas carried away his bones. However, the neighboring people demanded their share, in order to build stiipas. The Mallas refused at first, but, threatened by a coalition, they ended by allowing the bones to be divided into eight lots. Above the relics, the urn, and the dead coals from the pyre, stiipas were erected.
151. The religious mHieu: The wandering ascetics
Toward the beginning of the sixth century, Gangetic India experienced a period of luxuriant religious and philosophical activity; it has rightly been compared with the spiritual flowering that occurred in Greece at the same period. Side by side with the monks and mystics who followed the Brahmanic tradition there were countless groups of sramaf)as ("those who make efforts; Pali, samana): wandering ascetics (parivriijaka), among whom there were yogins, magicians, and dialecticians ("sophists") and even materialists and nihilists, precursors of the Carvakas and the Lokayatas. Certain types of wandering ascetics went back to Vedic and post-Vedic times. Of most of them we know little except their names. Their doctrines are mentioned, fragmentarily, in Buddhist and Jain texts; attacked by both the Jainists and the Buddhists, they are often deliberately distorted and ridiculed. Probably, however, all these sramaf)as had forsaken the world, disgusted at once by the vanity of human life and by the doctrine implied in Brahmanic ritual. It was the mechanism of transmigrations and their mysterious impelling force, the act (karman),



The religious milieu: The wandering ascetics 83
that the srama1)as attempted to understand and master. They made use of many and various methods, from extreme asceticism, parayogic ecstasy, and empirical analysis of matter to the most abstract metaphysics, orgiastic practices, extravagant nihilism, and vulgar materialism. The means chosen depended in part on the value attributed to the actor condemned to transmigrate by virtue of karman. Was this value a psychic, perishable organism or an indestructible and immortal Self? Essentially, this was the same problem raised by the earliest Upanishads (§ 80) and one that would always remain at the center of Indian thought. The Buddhist and Jain texts sometimes speak only of the doctrines of certain religious sectarians, without mentioning their names. Thus, for example, the Brahmajala Sutta provides a long catalogue of doctrines: "Some speculate on the past cycles of duration, affirming the eternity of the self (atta; Skr. iitman) and the world, acquiring by a psychic discipline (which is that of yoga with samiidhi) marvelous powers, such as remembering their former lives. Some affirm now an eternity, now a noneternity, opposing, for example, eternal brahman to its impermanent creations. Some admit the infinity, others the finiteness, of the world.... Some agnostics avoid all questions. Some suppose the self and the world produced without cause. Another group speculates on the cycles to come, envisaging the becoming of the self after the dissolution of the body. This self can be conscious or even have form, or it can be without either form or absence of form, hence foreign to the realm of form, finite or infinite, suffering unhappy feelings. Or it is unconscious, or neither conscious nor unconscious, and everything is denied of it, etc." (summarized by J. Filliozat, L'Inde classique, vol. 2, p. 512). This catalogue is the more valuable because certain of the doctrines attacked will be taken up again and developed by various Buddhist schools. In addition to these anonymous doctrines, the sources have preserved the names of some sects. We shall consider the most important among them further on: the Ajivikas, whose chief master was Makkhali Gosrua, and the Nigranthas (those "Without Place"), that is, the Jains, disciples of Mahavira. As for Gautama's masters, Ara<;ia Kalama and Udraka, though the Bud



84 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
dha exceeded them in intelligence and in power of concentration, their influence on his method of meditation was considerable. The Siimaftftaphala Sutta (Dlgha 1. 47 ff.) also mentions the Buddha's six rival masters. Of each of them we are told that he is the "head of a community," a famous "founder of a sect, respected as a saint, venerated by a crowd of people, advanced in age." PuraI).a Kassapa seems to have preached that the act has no value; Ajita Kesakambala professed a materialism close to that of the Carvakas; Pakudha Kaccayana taught the eternity of the seven "bodies" (kiiya, that is, the "bodies" of the earth, of water, of fire, of the wind, of pleasure, of pain, and of life); and Safijaya probably taught skepticism, for he avoided any discussion. The two others are Makkhali Gosala and NigaI).tha Nataputta, that is, Mahavira; the latter is scarcely mentioned in the Buddhist sources, though he was the most important religious personality among the Buddha's contemporaries. Several Suttas relate encounters with the paribbiijakas, but the texts emphasize the Blessed One's answers rather than the doctrines and manners of his interlocutors. He reproaches them, for example, with being infatuated with their own asceticism, with scorning others, with believing that they have attained their goal and congratulating themselves on it, with having an exaggerated opinion of their accomplishments, etc.9 He declares that what characterizes the true samana or Brahman is not his external appearance, his penitence, or his physical mortification but his inner discipline, charity, mastery of self, freedom from superstitions, and his control over his intellectual processes. to

Mahiivlra and the "Saviors ofthe World" 85
succeeded in organizing a religious community that still survives in our day. Certain analogies between the careers and spiritual orientations of the two masters are observable. Both belonged to the aristocratic military caste (k~atriya) and exhibited the same anti-Brahmanic tendency, which was already visible in the earliest Upanishads; and both were essentially "heretics," for they denied the existence of a supreme god and the revealed character of the Vedas and denounced the uselessness and cruelty of sacrifices. On the other hand, they were of entirely different temperaments, and their doctrines are irreconcilable. Unlike Buddhism, Jainism did not begin with Mahavlra's preaching, for he was only the last in a fabulous series of TIrthalJlkaras (literally, "makers of the ford," in other words, "openers of the way, announcers of salvation").l1 The first, E.~abha, or AdIsvara, "the primordial master," was said to have lived for millions of years, first as a prince, then as an ascetic, before attaining nirvii1}a on Mount Kailasa. The legendary biographies of the twenty-one other TIrthalJlkaras follow more or less the same pattern, which, in any case, is only the life of Mahavlra transfigured into a paradigm: they are all of princely origin, renounce the world, and found a religious community. It is agreed to attribute a certain historicity to the twenty-third TIrthaIpkara, Parsva. Son of a king of Benares, he was said to have forsaken the world at the age of thirty, to have attained omniscience, and, after founding eight communities, to have died on a mountain at the age of one hundred, 250 years before Mahavlra. Parsva still enjoys an exceptional position in the cult and the mythology of the Jains in our day. Mahavlra was the son of Siddhartha, the head of a noble clan, and of TirsaIa, who was related to the reigning families of Magadha. But the legend sets his birth in the traditional framework of the nativity of "saviors of the world": he who was to be the twenty-fourth and last TIrthalJlkara decides to descend to earth to restore the doctrine and moral perfection of the communities founded by Parsva. He became incarnate in the womb of Devananda, wife of a Brahman, but the gods transported the embryo into a princess ofMagadha. A series of prophetic dreams

86 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
announced to the two mothers the birth of a savior-cakravartin. And, just as for the Buddha and for Zarathustra, a great light illuminated the night of his birth. The infant received the name Vardhamana ("Prosper") and, like the Buddha, experienced the life of a prince, married a noble maiden, and had a child by her. But on the death of his parents, when he was thirty years old, and having obtained permission from his elder brother, Vardhamana gave away all his possessions, forsook the world, and assumed the dress of a wandering ascetic. After thirteen months he renounced wearing clothes, and this is the first innovation that separates him from the tradition handed down by Parsva. Naked, "clad in space," for thirteen years he devoted himself to the most rigorous asceticism and to meditation. Finally, after prolonged mortifications and two and a half days of recollection, on one night in summer, under a siila tree on the bank of a river, he obtained "omniscience." He thus became ajina ("conqueror"), and his disciples would later take the name of Jains; but he is principally known as Mahavira, the "Great Hero." For thirty years he continued his wandering life, preaching his doctrine in the countries of Magadha, AIiga, and Videha in the plain of the Ganges. During the monsoon, like all other holy men, Mahavira stopped near a city. He died at the age of seventy-two at Pava (near the present Patna). The date of his ••entrance into nirviif)a" is still disputed; it was in 468 B.C. according to some, in 477 according to Jacobi and Schubrig. In any case the event took place a few years before the Buddha's nirviif)a.
153. Jain doctrines and practices
Almost nothing is known concerning Mahavira's personality. The mythology that celebrates his birth, like the mythology built up around the Buddha, is the traditional mythology of India. The Jain canon was edited in the fourth and third centuries B.C., but some passages are much earlier and perhaps still preserve the words used by the master. What appears to be characteristic of Mahavira's teaching is an interest in the structures of nature and also a passion for classification and numbers. It has been possible



Jain doctrines and practices 87
to say that his system is governed by number (Schubrig), and in fact it speaks of three kinds of consciousness and five kinds of right knowledge, of seven principles or categories, of five kinds of bodies, of six shades or colors (/esya) that mark the soul's merit and demerit, of eight kinds of "karmic matter," of fourteen stages of spiritual qualifications, etc. On the other hand, Mahavira differs from both Parsva and the Buddha by his strict asceticism, which imposed permanent nudity and numerous prohibitions on his disciples. Mahavira denies the existence of God but not that of the gods; the latter enjoy a certain degree of beatitude, but they.are not immortal. The cosmos and life have no beginning and will have no end. The cosmic cycles repeat themselves ad infinitum. The number of souls is also infinite. Everything is governed by karman except the delivered soul. A characteristic feature of Jainism, and one that emphasizes its archaic structure, is panpsychism: everything that exists in the world has a soul, not only the animals but also plants, stones, drops of water, etc. And, since respect for life is the first and most important Jain commandment, this belief in panpsychism gives rise to countless difficulties. This is why the monk, as he walks, must sweep the ground before him and why he is forbidden to go out after sunset: lest he be in danger of killing some minute animal. It seems paradoxical that a doctrine that postulates panpsychism and proclaims absolute respect for life radically disparages human life and regards suicide by starvation as the most sublime death. Respect for life-that is, for everything that exists in the three realms of the world-is not able to resanctify human life or even give it religious significance. Sharing the pessimism and the refusal of life that had become manifest in the Upanishads, Jainism conceives only a spiritual and transcosmic bliss (but see below, § 190): the soul delivered from "karmic matter" flies "like an arrow" to the summit of the universe; there, in a kind of empyrean, it meets and communicates with other delivered souls, constituting a community that is purely spiritual or even divine. Such pessimism and acosmic "spiritualism" recall certain Gnostic schools (§ 228) and, with important differences, classic Salpkhya and Yoga (§§ 139 ff.).



88 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
Karman plays a decisive part, for it creates the karmic matter, a kind of psychocorporal organism that attaches itself to the soul and forces it to transmigrate. Deliverance (mok~a) is accomplished by cessation of any contact with matter, that is, by rejecting the karman that has already been absorbed and by halting all new karmic influence. As was to be expected, deliverance is obtained by a series of meditations and concentrations that are yogic in typel2 and that crown a life of asceticism and recollection. Naturally, only monks and nuns can aspire to deliverance, but the monastic life is open to any child eight years of age on condition that he is in good health. After some years of study, the novice is initiated by a master and takes the five vows: to spare all life, to tell the truth, to possess nothing, to acquire nothing, and to remain chaste. He is then given a begging bowl, a short broom to clean the road ahead of him, and a small piece of muslin, with which he covers his mouth when he speaks (probably to avoid swallowing insects). The wandering life of the monks and nuns, except for the four monsoon months, exactly imitates that of Mahavira. According to tradition, at the time of Mahavira's death there were, in addition to a huge lay community, 14,000 monks and 36,000 nuns. These figures are probably exaggerated; but what is more surprising is the great majority of women among the adepts and in the lay collectivity, especially since, according to certain Jain masters, nuns could not attain deliverance because they were forbidden to practice monastic nUdity. However, the large number of women, whether nuns or lay sisters, is documented by the earliest tradition. It is believed that Mahavira addressed principally his social equals, members of the noble and military aristocracy. It may be presumed that women who belonged to these circles found in Mahavira's teaching-a teaching whose roots lay deep in the most archaic Indian spiritualitya religious way that was refused them by Brahmanic orthodoxy.
12. Certain techniques are in perfect correspondence with the tradition of classic Yoga, later fixed by Patafijali (§ 143). For example, concentration (dhyiina) consists in fixing the psychomental activity on "a single point."



The A.jivikas and the omnipotence of "destiny" 89
154. The Ajivikas and the omnipotence of "destiny"
The Buddha regarded Maskarin (Makkhali) Gosrua as his most dangerous rival. Disciple and companion of Mahavlra for several years, Gosrua practiced asceticism, obtained magical powers, and became the leader of the Ajlvikas. According to the few biographical references preserved by the Buddhist and Jain scriptures, Gosrua was a powerful magician. He killed one of his disciples with his "magical fire"; however, it was after a magical tournament with Mahavlra and as the result of the latter's curse that he died (probably between 485 and 484 B.C.). The etymology of the word iijivika remains obscure. Attacked by the Buddhists and the Jains, the doctrines and practices of the Ajlvikas are difficult to reconstruct. Except for a few quotations preserved in the books of their adversaries, nothing of their canon has survived. Yet we know that the movement is one of considerable antiquity, preceding Buddhism and Jainism by several generations. What distinguished Gosrua from all his contemporaries was his rigorous fatalism. "Human effort is ineffective": such was the essence of his message. And the keystone of his system lay in a single word: niyati, "fatality," "destiny." According to a Buddhist text, Gosala believed that "there is no cause, there is no motive, for the corruption of beings; beings are corrupted without cause or motive. There is no cause for the purity of beings; beings are purified without cause or motive. There is no act performed by oneself; there is no act performed by another. There is no human act, there is no force ... ,no energy ... ,no human vigor ... ,no human courage. All beings, all individuals, all creatures, all living things, are without will, without force, without energy; they evolve by the effort of destiny, of contingencies, by their own state" (Siimafifiaphala Sutta 54, after the translation by L. Renou). In other words, Gosala rejects the panIndian doctrine of karman. According to him, every being was obliged to pass through its cycle of 8,400,000 eons (mahiikalpa), and, at the end, deliverance was produced spontaneously, without effort. The Buddha considered this implacable determinism criminal, and that is why he attacked Makkhali Gosala more than



90 THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
any other of his contemporaries; he considered his doctrine of "fatality" (niyati) as the most dangerous doctrine of all. Makkhali Gos~ila holds an original position in the horizon of Indian thought; his deterministic conception prompted him to study natural phenomena and the laws of life. I3 The Ajivikas went about completely naked, following this custom earlier than the appearance of Mahavira and Makkhali Gosala. Like all wandering ascetics, they begged for their food and followed very strict dietary rules; many of them put an end to their lives by letting themselves die of hunger. Initiation into the order was archaic in character: the neophyte had to burn his hands by grasping a hot object; he was buried up to the neck, and his hairs were plucked out one by one. But nothing has come down to us concerning the Ajivikas' spiritual techniques. It must be supposed that they possessed their own ascetic traditions and methods of meditation; we deduce this from certain allusions to a kind of nirviiT)a comparable to the supreme heaven of the other mystical schools. 14

19 The Message of the
Buddha: From theTerror of the Eternal Return to the Bliss of the Inexpressible
155. The man struck by a poisoned arrow . ..
The Buddha never consented to give his teaching the structure of a system. Not only did he refuse to discuss philosophical problems, he did not even issue pronouncements on several essential points of his doctrine-for example, on the state of the holy man in nirviilJ,a. This silence early made possible differing opinions and finally gave rise to various schools and sects. The oral transmission of the Buddha's teaching and the composition of the canon raise numerous problems, and it would be useless to suppose that they will one day be satisfactorily solved. But ifit seems impossible wholly to reconstruct the Buddha's "authentic message," it would be excessive to suppose that the earliest documents already present a radically modified version of his doctrine of salvation. From the beginning, the Buddhist communityi (saf7lgha) was organized by monastic rules (vinaya) that assured its unity. As for doctrine, the monks shared certain fundamental ideas concerning transmigration and the retribution for actions, the techniques of meditation that would lead to nirviilJ,a, and the "condition of the Buddha" (what is called Buddhology). In addition to the community, there existed, even in the Blessed One's time, a mass of sympathizing laymen who, though accepting the teaching, did not renounce the world. By their faith in the Buddha, by their generosity to the community, the laymen gained "merits" that insured them a postexistence in one of the various "paradises," followed by a better reincarnation. This type of devotion is characteristic of "popular Buddhism," and it has great

importance in the religious history of Asia because of the mythologies, rituals, and literary and artistic works to which it has given rise. Essentially it may be said that the Buddha opposed both the cosmological and philosophical speculations of the Brahmans and the sramaIJas (magicians) and the different methods and techniques of a preclassic SaIPkhya and Yoga. As for cosmology and anthropogony, which he refused to discuss, it is obvious that, for the Buddha, the world was created by neither a god nor a demiurge nor an evil spirit (as the Gnostics and Manicheans think; see §§ 229 ff.), but that it continues to exist, that is, it is continually created by the acts, good or evil, of men. Indeed, when ignorance and sin increase, not only is human life shortened but the universe itself wastes away. (This idea is pan-Indian, but it derives from archaic conceptions of the progressive decadence ofthe world, which necessitates its periodical renewal.) As for SaIPkhya and Yoga, the Buddha borrows and develops the analysis of the SaIPkhya masters and the contemplative techniques of the yogins while rejecting their theoretical presuppositions, first of all the idea of the Self (puru~a). His refusal to let himself be drawn into speculations of any kind is categorical. It is admirably illustrated in the famous dialogue with MaIuQ.kyaputta. This monk complained that the Blessed One gave no answers to such questions as: Is the universe eternal or noneternal? Finite or infinite? Is the soul the same thing as the body, or is it different? Does the Tathagata exist after death, or does he not exist after death? And so forth. MaluQ.kyaputta asks the Master to state
his thought clearly and, if necessary, to admit that he does not know the answer. The Buddha then tells him the story ofthe man struck by a poisoned arrow. His friends and relatives fetch a surgeon, but the man exclaims: "I will not let this arrow be drawn out until I know who struck me; also, whether he is a k~atriya or a Brahman ... , to what family he belongs; whether he is tall, short, or of medium height; from what village or city he comes. I will not let this arrow be drawn out before I know what kind of bow was drawn against me, ... what string was used on the bow, ... what feather was used on the arrow ... ,how the point of the arrow was made." The man died without knowing these things, the Blessed One continued, just like one who would re

fuse to follow the way of holiness before solving one or another philosophical problem. Why did the Buddha refuse to discuss these things? "Because it is not useful, because it is not connected with the holy and spiritual life and does not contribute to disgust with the world, to detachment, to cessation of desire, to tranqUillity, to profound penetration, to illumination, to Nirvfu)a!" And the Buddha reminded MaluQkyaputta that he had taught only one thing, namely: the four Noble Truths (Majjhirna Niktiya 1. 426).
156. The four Noble Truths and the Middle Path. Why?
These four Noble Truths contain the heart of his teaching. He preached them in his first sermon at Benares, soon after the Awakening, to his five former companions (§ 149). The first Noble Truth concerns suffering or pain (Pali: dukkha). For the Buddha, as for the majority of Indian thinkers and holy men after the period of the Upanishads, all is suffering. Indeed, "Birth is suffering, decline is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering. To be joined with what one does not love means to suffer. To be separated from what one loves... , not to have what one desires, means to suffer. In short, any contact with [one of the] five skandhas implies suffering" (Majjhirna Niktiya 1. 141). We would point out that the term dukkha, usually translated by "pain" or "suffering," has a much broader meaning. Various forms of happiness, even certain spiritual states obtained by meditation, are described as being dukkha. After praising the spiritual bliss of such yogic states, the Buddha adds that they are "impermanent, dukkha, and subject to change" (Majjhirna Niktiya 1. 90). They are dukkha precisely because they are impermanent. 1 As we shall see, the Buddha reduces the "self" to a combination of five aggregates (skandhas) ofthe physical and psychic
1. Buddhist scholasticism distinguished dukkha as ordinary suffering, as suffering caused by change, and as a conditioned state (Visuddhimagga, p. 499; cf. Rahula, L'Enseignement du Bouddha, p. 40). But, since everything is "conditioned," everything is suffering.



94 THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA
forces. And he states that dukkha is, in the last analysis, the five aggregates. 2 The second Noble Truth identifies the origin of suffering (dukkha) in desire, appetite, or the "thirst" (taf)ha) that determines reincarnations. This "thirst" continually searches for new enjoyments, of which there are three distinct kinds: desire for sensual pleasures, desire to perpetuate oneself, and desire for extinction (or self-annihilation). It is noteworthy that the desire for self-annihilation is condemned along with the other manifestations of "thirst." Being itself an "appetite," the desire for extinction, which can lead to suicide, does not constitute a solution, for it does not halt the eternal circuit of transmigrations. The third Noble Truth proclaims that deliverance from pain (dukkha) consists in abolishing the appetites (taf)ha). It is equivalent to nirvaf)a. Indeed, one of the names of nirvaf)a is "Extinction of Thirst" (taf)hakkaya). Finally, the fourth Noble Truth reveals the ways that lead to the cessation of suffering. In formulating the four truths, the Buddha applies a method of Indian medicine that first defines a disease, then discovers its cause, and finally presents the methods able to end it. The therapy elaborated by the Buddha constitutes, in fact, the fourth Truth, for it prescribes the means for curing the evils of existence. This method is known by the name of the "Middle Way." And in fact it avoids the two extremes: the pursuit of happiness by the pleasures of the senses, and the opposite way, the search for spiritual bliss by excessive asceticism. The Middle Way is also called the Eightfold Path, because it consists in: (1) right (or just) opinion, (2) right thought, (3) right speech, (4) right activity, (5) right means of existence, (6) right effort, (7) right attention, (8) right concentration. The Buddha returns tirelessly to the eight rules of the Way, explaining them in different manners, for he addressed different audiences. These eight rules were sometimes classified according to their purposes. Thus, for example, one text of the Majjhima Nikaya (1. 301) defines the Buddhist teaching as: (1) ethical conduct (sila), (2) mental discipline (samadhi), (3) wisdom (panna; Skr. prajiia). Ethical behavior, based on universal love and com

passion for all beings, consists, in fact, in the practice of the three rules (nos. 2-4) of the Eightfold Path, namely, just or right speech and thought and right activity. Numerous texts explain what is meant by these formulas. 3 Mental discipline consists in the practice of the last three rules of the Eightfold Path (nos. 6-8): right effort, attention, and concentration. These consist in ascetic exercises ofthe Yoga type, on which we shall dwell later, for they are the essence of the Buddhist message. As for wisdom (prajfiii) , it is the result of the first two rules: right view or opinion, right thought.
157. The impermanence of things and the doctrine of anatta
By meditating on the first two Noble Truths-on pain and the origin of pain-the monk discovers the impermanence, hence the nonsubstantiality, of his own being. He finds that he is not astray among things (as is, for example, the Vedantin, the Orphic, and the Gnostic) but shares their modalities of existence; for the cosmic totality and psychomental activity constitute one and the same universe. By employing a pitiless analysis, the Buddha showed that all that exists in the world can be classed in five categories-"assemblages" or "aggregates" (skandhas); these are (1) the sum total of "appearances," of the sensible (which includes the totality of material things, the sense organs, and their objects); (2) the sensations (provoked by contact with the five sense organs); (3) the perceptions and the notions that result from them (that is to say, cognitive phenomena); (4) psychic constructions, including both conscious and unconscious psychic activity; (5) thoughts (vijfiiinas) , that is, the various kinds of knowledge produced by the sensory faculties and especially by the spirit (manas) that has its seat in the heart and organizes the sensory experiences. Only nirviil}a is not conditioned, not "con
3. For example, right speech means abstaining from lying, scandalmongering, and calumny, from all brutal, injurious, malevolent words, and, finally, from idle talk. The rule of right activity forbids the Buddhist to destroy life, to steal, to have illegitimate sexual relations, etc. The right way of life excludes professions that are harmful to others, etc.



96 THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA
structed," and, consequently, cannot be classed among the aggregates. These aggregates or assemblages summarily describe the world of things and the human condition. Another celebrated formula even more dynamically recapitulates and illustrates the concatenation of causes and effects that govern the cycle of lives and rebirths. This formula, known as "conditioned coproduction" (pratitya-samutpiida; Pali, paricca-samuppiida), comprises twelve factors ("members"), the first of which is ignorance. It is ignorance that produces the volitions; these, in their tum, produce the "psychic constructions" (sa/flskiiras), which condition the psychic and mental phenomena, and so on and on-up to desire, more especially sexual desire, which engenders a new existence and finally ends in old age and death. Essentially, ignorance, desire, and existence are interdependent, and together they suffice to explain the unbroken chain of births, deaths, and transmigrations. This method of analysis and classification was not discovered by the Buddha. The analyses of preclassic Yoga and Sarpkhya, like the earlier speculations of the BrahmaQas and the Upanishads, had already dissociated and classified the cosmic totality and psychomental activity into a certain number of elements or categories. Moreover, from the post-Vedic period on, desire and ignorance were denounced as the first causes of suffering and transmigration. But the Upanishads, like Sarpkhya and Yoga, also recognize the existence of an autonomous spiritual principle, the iitman or the puru~a. Now the Buddha appears to have denied, or at least refrained from discussing, the existence of such a principle. Indeed, a number of texts regarded as reflecting the Master's original teaching deny the reality ofthe human person (pudgala), of the vital principle (jiva), and of the iitman. In one of his discourses the Master brands as "completely senseless" the doctrine that affirms: "This universe is this iitman; after death, I shall be that, which is permanent, which remains, which endures, which does not change, and I shall exist as such for all eternity."4 The ascetic intent and function of this negation of his are com

prehensible: by meditating on the unreality of the person, one destroys ignorance in its very roots. On the other hand, the negation of a Self, subject to transmigrations but able to free itself and attain nirvaIJa, raised problems. This is why the Buddha on several occasions refused to answer questions concerning the existence or nonexistence of the atman. Thus he remained silent when a wandering monk, Vacchagotta, questioned him concerning these problems. But he later explained to Ananda the meaning of his silence: if he had answered that a Self exists, he would have lied; moreover, Vacchagotta would have put the Blessed One among the adherents of the "eternalist theory" (that is, he would have made him a "philosopher" like any number of others). If he had answered that there is no Self, Vacchagotta would have taken him to be a partisan of the "annihilistic theory," and, even more important, the Buddha would only have increased his confusion; "for he would have thought: formerly I did have an atman, but now I no longer have one" (Saf[tyutta Nikaya 4.400). Commenting on this famous episode, Vasubandhu (fifth century A.D.) concluded: "To believe in the existence of the 'Self' is to fall into the heresy of permanence; to deny the 'Self' is to fall into the heresy of annihilation at death."5 By denying the reality of the Self (nairatmya) , one arrives at this paradox: a doctrine that exalts the importance of the act and of its "fruit," the retribution for the act, denies the agent, the "eater of the fruit." In other words, as a late authority, Buddhagho~a, put it: "Only suffering exists, but no sufferer is to be found. Acts are, but there is no actor" (Visuddhimagga, p. 513). However, certain texts are less categorical: "He who eats the fruit of the act in a certain existence is not he who performed the act in an earlier existence; but he is not another."6 Such hesitations and ambiguities reflect the embarrassment occasioned by the Buddha's refusal to settle certain muchdebated questions. If the Master denied the existence of an irreducible and indestructible Self, it was because he knew that the belief in atman leads to interminable metaphysical controversies

and encourages intellectual pride; in the last analysis, it prevents obtaining Enlightenment. As he never ceased to repeat, he preached the cessation of suffering and the means of accomplishing it. The countless controversies concerning the Self and the nature of nirviilJ.a found their solutions in the experience of Enlightenment: they were insoluble by thought or on the plane of verbalization. However, the Buddha seems to have accepted a certain unity and continuity of the "person" (pudgala). In a sermon on the burden and the burden-bearer, he states: "The burden is the five skandhas: matter, sensations, ideas, volitions, knowledge; the burden-bearer is the pudgala. for example that venerable monk, of such and such a family, such and such name, etc." (Sa1?1yutta 3. 22). But he refused to take sides in the controversy between the "partisans of the person" (pudgalaviidin) and the "partisans of the aggregates" (skandhaviidin); he maintained a "middle" position.7 However, belief in the continuity of the person continues, and not only in popular circles. The Jatakas narrate the Buddha's former existences and those of his family and his companions, and the identity of their personalities is always recognized. And how are we to understand the words uttered by Siddhartha at the very moment he was born-"This is my last birth" (§ I47)-ifwe deny the continuity of the "true person" (even if we hesitate to call it the Self or pudgala)?

Besides. the pudgalaviidins approached their adversaries with a paradoxical definition of the person: ..It is false that the pudgala is the same thing as the skandhas; it is false that it differs from the skandhas." On the other hand. the "partisans of aggregates" ended by transforming the "personality" into a "series" (sa~tiina) of causes and effects. whose unity. though in motion. is not discontinuous. which makes it resemble the "souL" These two interpretations will be elaborated by later schools. but in the history of Buddhist thought the future belongs to the partisans of the soul-series.

thirst (taIJhti), that is, "the act of turning away from it (from this thirst), renouncing it, rejecting it, freeing oneself from it, not attaching oneself to it" (Majjhima N. 1. 141). One then affirms that the ways that lead to the stopping of pain are those set forth in the Eightfold Path. The last two Truths explicitly state: (1) that nirvtiIJa exists but (2) that it can be obtained only by special techniques of concentration and meditation. By implication, this also means that all discussion concerning the nature of nirvtiIJa and the existential modality of the one who has achieved it has no meaning for him who has not reached even the threshold of that inexpressible state. The Buddha does not put forth a definition of nirVlllJa, but he constantly returns to some of its attributes. He affirms that the arhats (the delivered saints) "have attained unshakable happiness" (Udtina 8. 10); that nirvtiIJa "is bliss" (Ahguttara 4.414); that he, the Blessed One, has "attained the Immortal" and that the monks can attain it too: "You will make yourselves present even in this life; you will live possessing this Immortal" (Majjhima N. 1. 172). The arhat, "even in this life, cut off, nirvanaized (nibbuta), feeling happiness in himself, spends his time with Brahman."8 So the Buddha teaches that nirvtiIJa is "visible here below," "manifest," "actual," or "of this world." But he emphasizes the fact that only he among the yogins "sees" and possesses nirvtiIJa (by this we must understand that he means both himself and those who follow his path, his method). "Vision," called in the canon "the eye of the saints" (ariya cakkhu), allows "contact" with the unconditioned, the "nonconstructed"-with nirvtiIJa.9 Now this transcendental "vision" is obtained by certain contempla

Another Buddhist text thus describes the delivered saint: "Of this monk I say that he will go neither east nor south nor west ... ; even in this life he is detached, nirva~aized, chilled, identified with Brahman (brahma-bhuta)" (cited by Vallee-Poussin, p. 73, n. I). 9. A distinction must, however, be made between the "visible" nirviifJa, the one that is accessible during life, and the parinirviifJa, which is realized at death.

tive techniques that were practiced even from Vedic times and parallels to which are found in ancient Iran. In short, whatever the "nature" of nirviifJa may be, it is certain that no one can approach it except by following the method taught by the Buddha. The yogic structure of this method is obvious, for it comprises a series of meditations and concentrations known for many centuries. But it is a Yoga developed and reinterpreted by the religious genius of the Blessed One. The monk first practices continuous reflection on his physiological life in order to become conscious of all the acts that, until then, he has performed automatically and unconsciously. For example, "inhaling slowly, he thoroughly understands this slow inhalation; exhaling quickly, he understands, etc. And he practices being conscious of all his exhalations. . . ,of all his inhalations; and he practices slowing down his exhalations . . . and his inhalations" (Dfgha 2.291 ff.). Similarly, the monk seeks to "understand perfectly" what he does when he walks, raises his arm, eats, speaks, or is silent. This uninterrupted lucidity confirms to him the friability of the phenomenal world and the unreality of the "soul." 10 Above all, it contributes to "transmuting" profane experience. The monk can now attempt with a certain confidence the techniques properly speaking. The Buddhist tradition classifies them in three categories: the "meditations" (jhiinas; Skr. dhyiinas) , the ..attainments" (samiipattis), and the concentrations (samiidhis). We shall first describe them briefly and then try to interpret their results. In the first meditation (jhiina), the monk, detaching himself from desire, experiences "joy and felicity," accompanied by an intellectual activity (reasoning and reflection). In the second jhiina, he obtains the calming of this intellectual activity; in consequence, he experiences inner serenity, unification of thought, and the "joy and felicity" arising from this concentration. At the thirdjhiina, he detaches himself from joy and remains indifferent but fully conscious, and he experi
10. Indeed, the commentary Suma1Jgaia Viliisini draws the following conclusion from bodily movements: "They say that it is a living entity that walks, a living entity that rests. But is there really a living entity that walks, that rests? There is not." As for the inhalations and exhalations, the bhikkhu discovers that "they are founded on matter, and matter is the material body; they are the four elements, etc." (see Eliade, Yoga, p. 169).



The way that leads to nirval}.a 101
ences bliss in his body. Finally, on entering the fourth stage, and renouncing both joy and pain, he obtains a state of absolute purity and indifference and awakened thought. II The four samiipattis ("attainments" or "contemplations") pursue the process of "purifying" thought. Emptied of its various contents, the thought is concentrated successively on the infinity of space, on the infinity of consciousness, on "nothingness," and, at the fourth samiipatti, it attains a state that "is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness." But the bhikkhu must go even further in this labor of spiritual purgation by realizing the halting of all perception and of every idea (nirodhasamiipatti). Physiologically, the monk appears to be in a cataleptic state, and he is said' 'to touch nirviifJ,a with his body." Indeed a late author declares that "the bhikkhu who has acquired it has nothing more to do."12 As for the "concentrations" (samiidhis), they are yogic exercises of lesser duration than the jhiinas and the samiipattis, and they serve especially a psychomental training. The thought is fixed on certain objects or notions in order to obtain unification of consciousness and suppression of the rational activities. There are various kinds of samiidhi, each directed toward a particular goal. By practicing and mastering these yogic exercises, together with still others,13 which we cannot pause to describe, the bhikkhu advances on the "path of deliverance." Four stages are distinguished: (1) "Having Entered the Current" is the stage attained by the monk who, freed from his errors and doubts, will be reborn on earth only seven more times; (2) the "Single Return" is the stage of him who, having reduced passion, hate, and stupidity, will have only one more rebirth; (3) the stage "Without Return" is when the monk, having definitely and completely freed himself from errors, doubts, and desires, will be reborn in a divine body and will then obtain deliverance; and (4) the final

102 THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA
stage is that of the' 'Deserving One" (arhat), who, purged of all impurities and passions, endowed with supernatural knowledge and miraculous powers (siddhis), will attain nirviifJa at the end of his life.
159. Techniques of meditation and their iUumination by "wisdom"
It would be credulous to think that one could "understand" these yogic exercises, even by multiplying quotations from the original texts and commenting on them at length. Only practice, under the direction of a master, can reveal their structure and their function. This was true in the period of the Upanishads, and it is still true in our day. However, we will mention some essential points. First of all, these yogic exercises are guided by "wisdom" (prajfiii), i.e., by a perfect comprehension of the psychic and parapsychic states experienced by the bhikkhu. The effort to "attain consciousness" of the most familiar physiological activities (breathing, walking, moving the arms, etc.) is continued in exercises that reveal to the yogin "states" inaccessible to a profane consciousness. Second, rendered "intelligible," the yogic experiences end by transmuting normal consciousness. On the one hand, the monk is delivered from the errors that are bound up with the very structure of an unilluminated consciousness (for example, believing in the reality of the "person" or in the unity of matter, etc.); on the other hand, by virtue of his supranormal experiences, he attains a plane of comprehension beyond any notional system, and such a comprehension cannot be verbalized. Third, by progressing in his practice, the monk finds new confirmations of the doctrine, especially the evidence for an "Absolute," a "nonconstructed," that transcends all the modalities accessible to an unilluminated consciousness, the evident reality of an "Immortal" (or "nirviifJa"), of which nothing can be said except that it exists. A late authority very aptly summarizes the experimental (i.e., yogic) origin of belief in the reality of nirviifJa:



Techniques of meditation 103
It is vain to maintain that nirviilJa does not exist for the reason
that it is not an object of knowledge. Obviously, nirviilJa is not known directly, in the way color, sensation, etc., are known; and it is not known indirectly by its activity, in the way the sense organs are known. Yet its nature and its activity ... are the object of knowledge.... The yogin, entered into contemplation, becomes conscious of nirviil]a, of its nature, of its activity. When he comes out of contemplation, he exclaims: "Oh nirviilJa, destruction, calm, excellent, escape!" The blind, because they do not see blue and yellow, have no right to say that the seeing do not see colors and that colors do not exist. 14
Probably the Buddha's most inspired contribution was the articulation of a method of meditation in which he succeeded in integrating ascetic practices and yogic techniques with specific procedures for understanding. This is also confirmed by the fact that the Buddha accorded equal value to asceticism-meditation of the Yoga type and to understanding of the doctrine. But, as was to be expected, the two ways-which, furthermore, correspond to two divergent tendencies of mind-bave only seldom been mastered by one and the same person. The canonical texts very early attempted to reconcile them. "The monks who devote themselves to yogic meditation (thejains) blame the monks who cling to the doctrine (the dhammayogas), and vice versa. On the contrary, they ought to think well of each other. Few indeed are they who spend their time touching with their bodies (that is, 'realizing, experiencing') the immortal element (that is, nirviilJa). Few too are those who see the profound reality by penetrating it by prajiiii (by intelligence)."15 All truths revealed by the Buddha were to be "realized" in the yogic way, that is, to be meditated on and "experienced." This is why Ananda, the Master's favorite disciple, though unequaled in knowledge ofthe doctrine, was excludedfrom the council (§ 185): for he was not an arhat, that is, had not had a perfect "yogic experience." A famous text ofthe SaT!lyutta (2. 115) sets Musila and Narada, each of them representing a certain degree of Buddhist

104 THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA
perfection, face to face. Each had the same knowledge, but Narada did not consider himself an arhat, since he had not experientially realized "contact with nirviif}a. "16 This dichotomy continued, only becoming more pronounced, through the whole history of Buddhism. Some authorities even affirmed that "wisdom" (prajfiii) is able by itselfto insure the acquisition ofnirviif}a, without any need to cultivate yogic experiences. There is perceptible in this apology for the "dry saint"-for the adept delivered by prajfiii alone-an antimystical tendency, that is, a resistance, on the part of the "metaphysicians," to yogic excess. We add that the road to nirviif}a-just like the road to samiidhi in classic Yoga-leads to possession of "miraculous powers" (siddhis; Pali, iddhi). This confronted the Buddha (as it later did Patafijali) with a new problem. For, on the one hand, the "powers" are inevitably acquired in the course of practice and, for that very reason, constitute precise indications of the monk's spiritual progress: they are a proof that he is in the process of "deconditioning" himself, that he has suspended the laws of nature in whose pitiless mechanism he was being crushed. But, on the other hand, the "powers" are doubly dangerous, because they tempt the bhikkhu with a vain "magic mastery over the world" and, in addition, they may cause dangerous confusion among the uninitiated. The "miraculous powers" form part of the five classes of "Super Knowledges" (abhijfiiis), namely: (1) siddhi, (2) the divine eye, (3) divine hearing, (4) knowledge of another's thought, and (5) recollection of previous existences. None of these five abhijfiiis differs from the' 'powers" that can be obtained by nonBuddhist yogins. In the Dfgha Nikiiya (1. 78 ff.) the Buddha states that the bhikkhu in meditation can mUltiply himself, become invisible, pass through solid ground, walk on water, fly through the air, or hear celestial sounds, know the thoughts of others, and remember his former lives. But he does not forget to add that possession ofthese powers brings with it the danger that they will deflect the monk from his true goal, which is nirviif}a. In addition, the display of such powers in no way advanced the propagation of salvation;

other yogins and ecstatics could perform the same miracles; even worse, the uninitiated might think that no more than magic was involved. This is why the Buddha strictly forbade displaying the "miraculous powers" before lay people.

Ifwe bear in mind the transmutation ofprofane consciousness obtained by the bhikkhu and the extravagant yogic and parapsychological experiments that he performs, we understand the perplexity, the hesitations, and even the contradictions ofthe canonical texts in the matter ofthe "nature" ofnirviilJa and the" situation" ofone who has been delivered. There has been any amount of discussion to determine whether the mode of being of the "nirvaQ.aized one" is equivalent to total extinction or to an inexpressible and blissful postexistence. The Buddha compared obtaining nirviilJa with the extinction of a flame. But it has been observed that, for Indian thought, the extinction of fire does not mean its annihilation but merely its regression to the mode of potentiality. 17 On the other hand, if nirviilJa is supremely unconditioned, if it is the Absolute, it transcends not only the cosmic structures but also the categories ofknowledge. In this case, it can be affirmed that the' 'nirvaQ.aized" adept no longer exists (if existence is understood as being a mode of being in the world); but it can also be affirmed that he "exists" in nirviilJa, in the unconditioned, hence in a mode of being that it is impossible to imagine. The Buddha was right in leaving this problem open. For only those who have entered on the Path and have realized at least certain yogic experiences and have suitably illuminated them with prajfiii realize that, with the transmutation of consciousness, verbal constructions and the structures of thought are abolished. One then comes out upon a paradoxical and seemingly contradictory plane on which being coincides with nonbeing; consequently, one can affirm, at one and the same time, that the "Self" exists and that it does not exist; that deliverance is ex

106 THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA
tinction and is at the same time bliss. In a certain sense, and despite the differences between Sarpkhya-Yoga and Buddhism, one can compare the "nirval}.aized" adept to the jfvan-mukta, the "one delivered in life" (§ 146). It is important to emphasize, however, that the equivalence between nirviifJa and absolute transcendence of the cosmos, that is, its annihilation, is also illustrated by numerous images and symbols. We have already referred to the cosmological and temporal symbolism of the "Buddha's Seven Steps" (§ 147). The parable of the "broken egg," used by the Buddha to proclaim that he had broken the wheel of existence (saJ?lsiira)-in other words, that he had transcended both the cosmos and cyclical time-must be added. No less spectacular are the images of the "destruction of the house" by the Buddha and of the "broken roof" by the arhats, images that express the annihilation of any conditioned world. 18 When we remember the importance of the homology "cosmos-house-human body" for Indian thought (and, in general, for traditional, archaic thought), we can estimate the revolutionary novelty of the objective proposed by the Buddha. To the archaic ideal of "fixing one's abode in a stable dwelling place" (that is, assuming a certain existential situation in a perfect cosmos), the Buddha opposes the ideal of the spiritual elite with which he was contemporary: annihilation of the world and transcendence of every "conditioned" situation. However, the Buddha did not claim that he preached an original doctrine. He repeated on many occasions that he was following "the ancient way," the timeless (akiilika) doctrine shared by the "saints" and the "perfectly awakened" ones of past times.'9 It was another way of emphasizing the "eternal" truth and the universality of his message.
18. See the texts cited in Eliade. Images and Symbols. pp. 87 ff.• and in "Briser Ie toit de la maison." passim. 19. "I have seen the ancient way, the old way founded by all the perfectly awakened at one time. That is the path that I claim to follow" (Saf!lyutfa Nikiiya 2. 106). Indeed, "those who. in times past. were saints. perfectly awakened. all those sublime beings. guided their disciples to just such an end as. today. the disciples are guided by me; and those who. in future times. will be saints. perfectly awakened. all those sublime beings. will not fail to guide their disciples in exactly the way in which. today. the disciples are guided by myself" (Maiihima Nikiiya 2.3-4; cf. ibid., 2. 112; 3. 134).



20 Roman Religion:
From Its Origins to the Prosecution of the Bacchanals (ca.186)
161. Romulus and the sacrificial victim
According to the ancient historians, the founding of Rome took place about 754 B.C., and archeological discoveries confirm the validity ofthis tradition: the site of the Urbs began to be inhabited from the middle of the eighth century. The myth of the founding of Rome and the legends of the earliest kings are especially important for an understanding of Roman religion, but this mythological summa also reflects certain ethnographic and social realities. The fabulous events that preceded the birth of Rome emphasize (1) an assemblage offugitives of different origins and (2) the fusion of two entirely distinct ethnic groups; for the Latin stock, from which the Roman people came, resulted from the mixture of the autochthonous Neolithic populations with the Indo-European invaders who came down from the transalpine regions. This first synthesis constitutes the exemplary model for the Roman nation and culture, for the processes of assimilation and ethnic, cultural, and religious integration continued until the end of the Empire. According to the tradition reported by the historians, Numitor, king of Alba, was deposed by his brother Amulius. In order to consolidate his rule, Amulius slaughtered Numitor's sons and forced their sister, Rhea Sylvia, to become a Vestal. But Sylvia was pregnant by Mars and gave birth to two boys, Romulus and Remus. Exposed on the bank of the Tiber, the twins, miraculously suckled by a she-wolf, were soon rescued by a shepherd and brought up by his wife. Having grown to manhood, Romulus and Remus obtained the recognition of their grand

father and, after doing away with the usurper, reestablished Numitor on the throne. However, they left Alba and decided to found a city on the site where they had spent their childhood. To consult the gods, Romulus chose the Palatine, while Remus took his station on the Aventine hill. It was Remus who saw the first augural sign: a flight of six vultures. But Romulus saw twelve, and to him fell the honor of founding the city. With a plow, he drew a furrow around the Palatine: the turned-up earth represented the walls, the furrow symbolized the moat, and the plow was raised to indicate the future sites of the gates. To ridicule his brother's extravagant terminology, Remus jumped over the "wall" and the "moat" at one bound. Then Romulus leaped on him and killed him, crying: "So perish whoever henceforth crosses my walls!'" The mythological character of this tradition is manifest. It recalls the theme of exposure of the newborn infant in the legends of Sargon, Moses, Cyrus, and other famous personages (see §§ 58, 105). The she-wolf, sent by Mars to feed the twins, foreshadows the warlike vocation of the Romans. Being exposed, then fed by the female of a wild beast, constitutes the first initiatory ordeal to be accomplished by the future hero. It is followed by the youth's apprenticeship among poor and humble people ignorant of his identity (cf. Cyrus). The theme of the "enemy (twin) brothers" and that of doing away with the uncle (or grandfather) are widespread. As for the ritual of founding a city by means of a furrow (sulcus primigenius) , parallels to it have been found in numerous cultures. (Reciprocally, an enemy city was ritually destroyed when its walls were demolished and a furrow was drawn around their ruins.)2 As in so many other traditions, the founding of a city in fact represents a repetition of the cosmogony. The sacrifice of Remus reflects the primordial cosmogonic sacrifice of the type exemplied by Puru~a, Ymir, P'an-ku (see § 75). Immolated on the site of Rome, Remus insures the

The "historicization" of Indo-European myths 109
fortunate future of the city, that is, the birth of the Roman people and the accession of Romulus to the kingship.3 It is difficult to determine the chronology and, especially, the modifications of this mythological tradition that were made before it was recorded by the earliest historians. Its archaism is undeniable, and certain analogies with Indo-European cosmogonies have been pointed out.4 More instructive for our purpose are the repercussions of this legend in the consciousness of the Romans. As Grimal remarks:
Of this blood sacrifice, the first that was offered to the divinity of Rome, the people will always preserve a terrified memory. More than seven hundred years after the Founding, Horace will still consider it a kind of original fault whose consequences would ineluctably bring about the downfall of the city by driving her sons to slaughter each other. At every critical juncture in its history, Rome will question herself in anguish, believing that she felt the burden of a curse upon her. No more than at her birth was she at peace with men, nor was she at peace with the gods. This religious anxiety will burden her destiny.5
162. The "historicization" of Indo-European myths
Tradition tells of the peopling of the city at first by shepherds of the region and then by outlaws and vagabonds from Latium. In order to obtain women, Romulus made use of a stratagem: during a festival that had attracted families from the neighboring cities, his companions seized the young Sabine women and dragged them into their houses. The war that then broke out between the Sabines and the Romans continued without any military decision until the women intervened between their relatives and their ravishers. The reconciliation led a number of

Sabines to settle in the city. After organizing its political structure by creating the senate and the assembly of the people, Romulus disappeared during a violent thunderstorm, and the people proclaimed him a god. Despite his crime of fratricide, the figure of Romulus became and remained exemplary in the consciousness of the Romans: he was at once founder and legislator, warrior and priest. Tradition agrees as to his successors. The first, the Sabine Numa, devoted himself to organizing the religious institutions of Rome; he especially distinguished himself by his veneration for Fides Publica, Good Faith, a goddess who governs relations among both individuals and nations. Among the kings who succeeded him, the most famous was the sixth, Servius Tullius; his name is connected with the reorganization of Roman society, with administrative reforms, and with the enlargement of the city. There has been prolonged discussion concerning the truthfulness of this tradition, which reports so many fabulous events, from the founding of Rome to the overthrow of the last king, the Etruscan Tarquinius Superbus, and the inauguration of the RepUblic. In all probability, recollections of a certain number of historical personages and events, already modified by the working of the collective memory, were interpreted and organized in conformity with a particular historiographic conception. Georges Dumezil has shown that the Romans "historicized" the great themes oflndo-European mythology (see § 63) to such an extent that it is possible to say that the earliest Roman mythology-the mythology that existed before Etruscan and Greek influencesis to be found, disguised, in the first two books of Livy. Thus, in regard to the war between the Romans and the Sabines, Dumezil notes the astonishing symmetry between it and a central episode of Scandinavian mythology, that is, the conflict between two groups of gods, the Aesir and the Vanir. The former are grouped around Ol'Sinn and Thor. Ol'Sinn, their chief, is the god-king-magician; Thor, the god with the hammer, is the great celestial champion. In contrast, the Vanir are the gods of fecundity and wealth. Attacked by the Aesir, the Vanir resist; but, as Snorri Sturluson puts it, "now one side, now the other, gained the victory." Wearied by this costly alternation of semisuccesses, the Aesir and the Vanir make peace; the chief Vanir divinities



The "historicization" of Indo-European myths 111
settle among the Aesir, thus completing, by the fecundity and wealth that they represent, the class of gods grouped around 6<Sinn. In this way the fusion of the two divine peoples is accomplished, and there will never be another conflict between the Aesir and the Vanir (see § 174, below). Georges Dumezil emphasizes the analogies with the war between the Romans and the Sabines: on the one side, Romulus, son of Mars and protege of Jupiter, and his companions, redoubtable warriors but poor and without women; on the other side, Tatius and the Sabines, characterized by wealth and fecundity (for they possess the women). In fact, the two groups are complementary. The war ends, not as the result of a victory, but through the initiative of the wives. Reconciled, the Sabines decide to fuse with Romulus' companions, thus bringing them wealth. The two kings, having become colleagues, found cults: Romulus to Jupiter alone, Tatius to the gods connected with fertility and the soil, among whom is Quirinus. "Never again, either under this double reign or later, will we hear talk of dissension between the Sabine element and the Latin, Alban, Romulean element of Rome. The society is complete."6 To be sure, it is possible, as a number of scholars think, that this war, followed by a reconciliation, reflects a certain historical reality-the fusion between the "autochthons" and the IndoEuropean conquerors.7 But it is significant that the "historical events" were rethought and organized in accordance with a mythological schema proper to the Indo-European societies. The surprising symmetry between a Scandinavian mythological episode and a Roman historical legend reveals its deep meaning when we examine the whole of the Indo-European heritage at Rome. First of all, it must be remembered that the earliest Roman triad-Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus-expresses the tripartite ideology documented among other Indo-European peoples, that is, the function of magical and juridical sovereignty (Jupiter; VaruI).a

and Mitra; 6i'5inn), the function ofthe gods ofwarlike force (Mars; Indra; Thor), and, finally, that of the divinities of fecundity and economic prosperity (Quirinus; the twin Nasatyas; Freyr). This functional triad constitutes the ideal model for the tripartite division of the Indo-European societies into three classes: priests, warriors, and stock-breeders/agriculturalists (brdhmanas, k~atriyas, and vaisyas, to mention only the Indian example; see § 63). At Rome the social tripartition was disrupted quite early, but it is possible to make out the memory of it in the legendary tradition of the three tribes. However, the essence of the Indo-European heritage was preserved in a strongly historicized form. The two complementary tendencies of the first function-magical sovereignty and juridical sovereignty, illustrated by the pair VaruQ.a-Mitra-recur in the two founders of Rome, Romulus and Tatius. The former, a violent demigod, is the protege of Jupiter Feretrius; the latter, level-headed and wise, establisher of the sacra and the leges, is the devotee of Fides Publica. They are followed by the exclusively warmongering King Tullus Hostilius and by Ancus Marcius, under whose reign the city becomes open to wealth and long-distance commerce.8 In short, the divine representatives of the three functions have been metamorphosed into "historical personages" and, precisely, into the series of the earliest Roman kings. The original hierarchic formula-divine tripartition-was expressed in temporal terms, as a chronological succession. Georges Dumezil has brought to light other examples of the historicization of Indo-European myths at Rome. We mention the victory of the third Horatius over the three Curiatii, which transposes Indra's and Trita's victory over the Three-Headed One. Or the legend of the two maimed figures, Cocles and Scaevola ("Cyclops" and "Lefty") and its parallel in the pair of the one-eyed god and the one-armed god of the Scandinavians, that is, Oi'5inn and Thor.9 The results of these comparative researches are of great consequence. They show first of all that the origins of Roman religion

Specific characteristics of Roman religiosity I 13
must not be sought in "primitive" beliefs,1O for the Indo-European religious ideology was still active at the time the Roman people was formed. To recognize that this heritage comprised not only a specific mythology and ritual technique but also a consistent and clearly formulated theology, we need only read Dumezil's analyses of the terms maiestas, gravitas, mos, augur, augustus, etc. II
The historicization of Indo-European mythological themes and mythico-ritual scenarios is also important for another reason. This process reveals one of the characteristic features of the Roman religious genius: its ametaphysical tendency and its "realistic" vocation. Indeed, we are struck by the passionate religious interest ofthe Romans in the immediate realities of cosmic life and of history, by the considerable importance they attributed to unusual phenomena (regarded as so many portents), and, above all, by their solemn confidence in the power of rites. In short, the survival of the Indo-European mythological heritage, camouflaged in the earliest history of the city, in itself constitutes a religious creation able to reveal to us the specific structure of Roman religiosity.
163. Specific characteristics of Roman religiosity
Their ametaphysical disposition and extremely keen interest (religious in nature!) in immediate realities, cosmic as well as historical, are early revealed in the Romans' attitude toward anomalies, accidents, and innovations. For the Romans, as for rural societies in general, the ideal norm was manifested in the regularity of the annual cycle, in the orderly succession of the
10. An approach illustrated especially by H. J. Rose, who identified numen with mana, overlooking the fact that "for centuries numen was only numen dei, the expressed will of such and such a god" (Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p.47). 11. See Dumezil, Idees romaines, pp. 31-152. To be sure, alongside this general system of theoretical explanation and, at the same time, of empirical mastery of the world there existed a number of beliefs and divine figures of foreign origin; but at the period of the ethnogenesis of the Roman people this allogeneous religious heritage affected, above all, the rural stocks.



114 ROMAN RELIGION
seasons. Every radical innovation constituted an attack on the norm; in the last analysis, it involved the danger of a return to chaos (cf. a similar conception in ancient Egypt, § 25). In the same way, every anomaly-prodigies, unusual phenomena (birth of monsters, rains of stones, etc.}-denoted a crisis in the relations between gods and meri. Prodigies proclaimed the gods' discontent or even anger. Aberrant phenomena were equivalent to enigmatic manifestations of the gods; from a certain point of view, they constituted "negative theophanies." Yahweh, too, announced his plans by means of cosmic phenomena and historical events: the prophets continually commented on them, emphasizing the terrible threats that they proclaimed (see §§ 116 ff.). For the Romans, the precise meaning of a prodigy was not obvious; it had to be deciphered by professionals of the cult. This explains the considerable importance of divinatory techniques and the respect, mingled with fear, enjoyed by the Etruscan haruspices and, later, by the Sibylline Books and other oracular collections. Divination consisted in interpretation of presages either seen (auspicia) or heard (omina). Only the magistrates and military leaders were authorized to explain them. But the Romans reserved the right to refuse presages (see, inter alia, Cicero, De divinatione l. 29), and a certain consul, who was also an augur, had himself carried about in a closed litter so that he could ignore any signs that might thwart his plans (De div. 2. 77). Once the meaning of the prodigy was deciphered, lustrations and other rites of purification were performed, for these "negative theophanies" proclaimed the presence of a defilement, which must be sedulously removed. At first sight this exaggerated fear of prodigies and defilement might be interpreted as terror fathered by superstition. It is, however, a special type of religious experience. For it is through such unusual manifestations that the dialogue between gods and men is carried on. This attitude toward the sacred is the direct consequence of the religious valorization of natural realities, human activities, and historical events-in short, ofthe concrete, the particular, the immediate. The proliferation of rites is another aspect of this behavior. Since the divine will manifests itself hic et nunc, in an endless series of unusual signs and incidents, it is important to know which ritual will be the most efficacious.



Specific characteristics of Roman religiosity 115
The need to recognize, even in their details, the specific manifestations of all the divine entities fostered a rather complex process of personification. The many epiphanies of a deity, as well as its different functions, tended to be distinguished as autonomous "persons." In certain cases these personifications do not reach the point of shaping a true divine figure. They are invoked one after the other, but always as a group. Thus, for example, agricultural activity is carried on under the sign of a number of entities, each of whom governs a particular moment-from turning over fallow land and plowing to harvesting, carting, and storing. Similarly, as Saint Augustine humorously notes (Civ. dei 7. 3), Vaticanus and Fabulinus were invoked to help the newborn infant cry and speak, Educa and Polina to make it eat and drink, Abeona to teach it to walk, and so on and so on. But these supernatural entities are invoked only in connection with agricultural tasks and in the private cult. They have no real personality, and their "power" does not extend beyond the limited area in which they act. 12 Morphologically, such entities do not share in the condition of the gods. The rather impoverished mythological imagination of the Romans and their indifference to metaphysics are made up for, as we have just seen, by their passionate interest in the concrete, the particular, the immediate. The Roman religious genius is distinguished by pragmatism, the search for effectiveness, and, above all, by the' 'sacralization" of organic collectivities: family, gens, fatherland. The famous Roman discipline, their honoring of obligations (fides), \3 their devotion to the state, and the religious prestige they attributed to law are expressed by depreciation of the human person: the individual mattered only insofar as he belonged to his group. It was not until later, under the influence of Greek philosophY and the Oriental cults of salvation, that the Romans discovered the religious importance of the person; but this discovery, which will have marked consequences (see § 206), more especially affected the urban populations.
12. What is more, even in these limited areas these entities are not important; see Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 52 ff. 13. Onfides, see ibid., p. 156, n. 3 (recent bibliography).



116 ROMAN RELIGION
The social character of Roman religiosity,14 and first of all the importance attributed to relations with others, are clearly expressed by the term pietas. Despite its relations with the verb piare ("to pacify, to do away with a defilement, an evil omen," etc.), pietas means not only scrupulous observance of the rites but also respect for the natural relationships (i.e., relationships in conformity with the norm) among human beings. For a son, pietas consists in obeying his father; disobedience is equivalent to a monstrous act, contrary to natural order, and the guilty son must expiate the defilement by his own death. Together with pietas toward the gods, there is pietas toward the members of the groups to which one belongs, toward the city, and, finally, toward all human beings. The "law of peoples" (jus gentium) prescribed duties even toward foreigners. This conception reached its full development when, "under the influence of Hellenic philosophy, the concept of humanitas became clear-the idea that the mere fact of belonging to the human race constituted a true kinship, similar to that which linked the members of one gens or one city, and created duties of solidarity, of friendship, or at least of respect."15 The "humanitarian" ideologies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries only return to and elaborate, though at the same time they desacralize, the old conception of Roman pietas.
164. The private cult: Penates, Lares, Manes
Until the end of paganism the private cult-under the direction of the pater familias-maintained its autonomy and importance side by side with the public cult carried on by professionals, who were dependents of the state. Unlike the public cult, which was continually modified, the domestic cult, performed around the

The private cult: Penates, Lares, Manes 117
hearth, seems not to have changed perceptibly during the twelve centuries of Roman history. It is without any doubt an archaic cult system, for it is documented among other Indo-European peoples. Just as was the case in Aryan India, the domestic fire constituted the center of the cult; it was offered daily sacrifices offood, flowers three times a month, etc. The cult was addressed to the Penates and the Lares, mythico-ritual personifications of the ancestors, and to the genius, a kind of "double" that protected the individual. The crises brought on by birth, marriage, and death called for specific rites of passage, governed by certain spirits and minor divinities. We mentioned above (p. 115) the entities invoked in the case of the newborn infant. The religious ceremony of marriage was performed under the auspices of the chthonic and domestic divinities (Tellus, later Ceres, etc.) and of Juno as protectress of the conjugal oath, and it included sacrifi,ces and circumambulations of the hearth. Funeral rites, performed on the ninth day after entombment or burial, were continued in the regular cult of deceased relatives (divi parentes) or Manes. Two festivals were consecrated to them: the Parentalia, in February, and the Lemuria, in May. During the first, the magistrates no longer wore their emblems, the temples were closed, the fires on the altars were extinguished, and no marriages were contracted (Ovid, Fasti 2. 533, 557-67). The dead returned to earth and ate the food on their tombs (ibid., 2.565-76). But it was, above all,pietas that pacified the ancestors (animas placare paternas: ibid., 2. 533). Since in the ancient Roman calendar February was the last month of the year, it shared in the fluid, "chaotic" condition that characterizes the intervals between two temporal cycles. The norms being in abeyance, the dead could return to earth. It was also February that saw the performance of the ritual of Lupercalia (§ 165), the collective purifications that prepared the universal renewal symbolized by the "New Year" (= ritual re-creation of the world). 16 During the three days of Lemuria (May 9, 11, and 13) the dead (lemures; etymology unknown) returned again and visited their descendants' houses. In order to pacify them and keep them

from taking some of the living away with them, the head of the family filled his mouth with black beans and, spitting them out, uttered the following formula nine times: "By these beans I redeem myself-myself and those who are mine." Finally, making a noise with some bronze object to frighten the shades, he repeated nine times: "Manes of my fathers, leave this place!" (ibid., 5. 429-44). Ritually seeing off the dead after their periodical visits to earth is a ceremony widely spread through the world (cf. the Anthesteria, § 123). Another rite connected with the Manes deserves mention: the devotio. Livy (8. 9-10) describes it in detail in his account of a battle against the Samnites. Seeing his legions on the verge of yielding, the consul Decius "devotes" his life for victory. Guided by a pontiff, he recites a ritual formula, invoking a great number of gods, beginning with Janus, Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus and ending with the Manes and the goddess Tellus. Together with his own life, Decius offers to the Manes and to Earth the enemy armies. The ritual of devotio illustrates an archaic conception of human sacrifice as "creative murder." In short, there is a ritual transfer of the sacrificed life for the benefit of the operation that has just been undertaken-in Decius' case, military victory. Almost the entire pantheon is invoked, but it is the offering to the Manes-that is, Decius' self-sacrifice and the mass immolation of the Samnites-that saves the Roman army. We do not know how the ancient inhabitants of Latium pictured the realm of the dead; the representations that have come down to us reflect the influence of Greek and Etruscan ideas. In all probability the archaic funerary mythology of the Latins continued the traditions of the Neolithic cultures of Europe. In any case, the conceptions of the other world held by the rural, Italic stocks were only superficially modified by later Greek, Etruscan, and Hellenistic influences. On the other hand, the Hades evoked by Vergil in book 6 of the Aeneid, the funerary symbolism of the sarcophaguses of the imperial period, and Oriental and NeoPythagorean conceptions of celestial immortality will become extremely popular, from the first century B.C. on, in Rome and the other cities of the Empire.



Priesthoods, augurs, and religious brotherhoods 119
165. Priesthoods, augurs, and religious brotherhoods
The public cult, controlled by the state, was performed by a certain number of officiants and religious brotherhoods. In the period of the monarchy the king held the highest rank in the priestly hierarchy: he was rex sacrorum ("king of the sacred"). Unfortunately, we know little of the services as they were celebrated. We do know, however, that in the Regia, the "king's house," three categories of rites were performed, dedicated respectively to Jupiter (or to Juno and Janus), to Mars, and to a goddess of agricultural abundance, Ops Consina. Thus, as Dumezip7 rightly points out, the king's house was the meeting place, and the king the synthesizing agent, of the three fundamental functions that, as we shall see in a moment, thejiamines maiores administered separately. It is legitimate to suppose that, even in the pre-Roman period, the rex was surrounded by a body of priests, just as the Vedic riijan had his chaplain (purohita) and the Irish ri his Druids. But Roman religion is characterized by a tendency to division and specialization. UnIlke Vedic India and the Celts, where the priesthoods were interchangeable and consequently able to celebrate any ceremony, in Rome every priest, every college or sodality, had a specific competence. IS After the rex there followed, in the priestly hierarchy, the fifteenjiamines, first of all the major flamens, those of Jupiter, (jiamines Dialis), of Mars, and of Quirinus. Their name is connected with Sanskrit brahman, but the flamens did not form a caste. They did not even make up a college, for each flamen was autonomous and attached to the divinity from whom he took his name. The institution is certainly archaic; the flamens were distinguished by their ritual costume and by a large number of prohibitions. Because of the antiquarian passion of Aulus Gellius, we are best informed concerning the status of the jiamen Dialis,' he could not leave Rome and could not wear anything knotted (if a chained man managed to enter his house, he had to be set free); he must not appear under the sky naked or see

the army or ride horseback; he had to shun contact with defilements and with the dead or anything that suggested death, etc. (Noctes Atticae 10. 15; cf. Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. 111).
For the flamens of Mars and Quirinus, the obligations and the prohibitions were less severe. We have no direct information concerning the cult services rendered by the flamen Martialis, but he probably took part in the horse sacrifice offered to Mars on October 15. As for theflamen Quirinalis, he officiated in three ceremonies: the first two (the summer Consualia, on August 21, and the Robigalia, on April 25) were certainly connected with grain. 19 We know little of the origin of the pontifical college. From a statement of Cicero's (De domo 135 and Har. resp. 12), it can safely be deduced that the college contained, in addition to the pontifices, the rex sacrorum and the major flamens. Contrary to the opinion of Kurt Latte,20 Dumezil has shown the antiquity of this institution. Beside the flamen Dialis, the ponti/ex represented a complementary function in the sacred entourage of the rex. The flamens did their duties "outside of history" in a way; they regularly performed the prescribed ceremonies but had no power to interpret or resolve new situations. Despite his intimacy with the celestial gods, theflamen Dialis did not express the will of heaven; this was the responsibility of the augurs. On the other hand, the pontifical college-more precisely, the ponti/ex maximus, of whom the others were only the extension-enjoyed both freedom and initiative. He was present at the meetings at which religious acts were decided upon, and he saw to the performance of cults that had no titular officials; he was also in control of the festivals. Under the Republic, it is the ponti/ex maximus who "creates the major flamens and the Vestals, over whom he has disciplinary powers; and, in respect to the Vestals, he is their
19. Dumezil, ibid., pp. 166 ff., 277-80. The twelve flamines minores were attached to divinities who had fallen into desuetude in the classic period: Volcanus, Volturnus, Palatua, Carmenta, Flora, Pomona, etc. 20. This author presupposes a revolution "that brought the great pontiff and the college that was subordinated to him to the head ofthe religious organization of Rome" (Romische Religionsgeschichte. p. 195). See Dumezil's critique, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 116 ff.



Priesthoods, augurs, and religious brotherhoods 121
counselor, sometimes their representative."21 Hence it is very probable that the institutions of the major flamens and of the pontifex are not the creation of royal Rome; as Dumezil remarks, "the strict status of the former and the freedom of the latter are not to be explained by successive creations, by evolutions, but correspond to different, pre-Roman functions that can still be read in their names; ... in short, it was natural that the greater part of the religious heritage of the royal function should pass to the pontifex."22 The six Vestals were attached to the pontifical college. Chosen by the pontifex maximus from among virgins between the ages of six and ten years, the Vestals were consecrated for a period of thirty years. They safeguarded the Roman people by keeping alight the fire of the city, which they must never allow to go out. Their religious power depended on their virginity; if a Vestal failed in chastity, she was shut up alive in an underground tomb, and her sexual partner was executed. As Dumezil observes, this is a decidedly original type of priesthood, one "for which ethnography has not discovered many parallels" (p. 576). The augural college was as ancient and as independent as the pontifical college. But the secret of its discipline has been well kept. We know only that the augur was not expected to decipher the future. His role was limited to discovering if one or another project (the choice of a cult site, of a religious functionary, etc.) wasfas (proper). He asked the gods: "Sifas est . .. , send me such and such a sign!" However, as early as the end of the royal period the Romans began to consult other specialists, both native and foreign (§ 167). With the passing of time, certain divinatory techniques of Greek or Etruscan origin were introduced into Rome. The method of haruspices (which consisted in examining the entrails of victims) was entirely borrowed from the Etrus
cans. 23
21. Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 574. 22. Ibid., p. 576. 23. As for oracular activity, which implied the direct inspiration of a god, it was suspect by the mere fact that it escaped state control. The collection known as the Sibylline Books must have been accepted because it was supposed to contain the secrets of Rome's future. But it was carefully guarded by priests and was consulted only in cases of extreme danger.



122 ROMAN RELIGION
Side by side with these colleges, the public cult comprised a number of closed groups, or "sodalities" (from sodalis, "companion"), each specializing in a particular religious technique. The twenty Fetiales sacralized declarations of war and peace treaties. The Salii, "dancers" of Mars and Quirinus, each group having twelve members, performed in March and October, when there was passage from peace to war and from war to peace. The Fratres Arvales protected cultivated fields. The brotherhood of the Luperci celebrated the Lupercalia on February 15, a rite that had its place among the ceremonies belonging to the period of crisis brought on by the end of the year (cf. §§ 12, 22).24 After the sacrifice ofa he-goat at the cave of the Lupanar, the Luperci, naked except for a goatskin apron, began their purifying run around the Palatine. As they ran, they struck passers-by with thongs cut from the skin of a he-goat. The women bore the strokes to obtain fertility (Plutarch, Romulus 21. 11-12, etc.). The rites were at once purifying and fertilizing, like many ceremonies celebrated in connection with the New Year. We certainly have here an archaic ritual complex, which also includes vestiges of an initiation ofthe Miinnerbund type; but the meaning of the scenario appears to have been forgotten before the Republic. In the public as well as the private cult, sacrifice consisted in the offering of some foodstuff: firstfruits of cereal, grapes, sweet wine, and especially animal victims-bovines, ovines, porcines, and, at the Ides of October, the horse. Except for the October horse, the sacrifices of animal victims followed the same scenario: preliminary libations were performed on the portable hearth (focu[us), representing the sacrificer's own foculus and placed in front of the temple, beside the altar. The sacrificer then symbolically immolated the victim by passing the sacrificial knife over its body from head to tail. Originally he himself slaughtered the animal, but in the classic ritual certain priests (victimarii) took over the task. The portion reserved for the gods-liver, lungs, heart, and some other pieces-was burned on the altar. The flesh was eaten by the sacrificer and his companions in the
24. Februum, which gave its name to the month of Februarius, is translated by Varro (De lingua latina 6. 13) as "purgamentum," and the verb februare means "to purify."

private cult, by the priests in the sacrifices celebrated for the state.
166. Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, and the Capitoline triad
Unlike the Greeks, who had early organized a well-defined pantheon, the Romans at the beginning of the historical period had only a single hierarchic group of divinities, namely, the archaic triad Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, completed by Janus and Vesta. As patron god of "beginnings," Janus headed the list, and Vesta, protectress of the city, closed it. However, the literary sources mention a large number of divinities, either aboriginal or borrowed from the Greeks or the Etruscans. But neither the classification nor the hierarchy of these gods and goddesses was settled.25 Certain ancient authors distinguished the di indigetes and the divi novensiles, the former national (patrii), the latter divinities who were accepted later (Varro, De lingua latina 5. 74; Vergil, Georg. 1. 498). Of greater value is the sequence displayed in the formula of devotio handed down by Livy: the four great gods (Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus) were followed by Bellona and the Lares (patrons of war and of the soil), then by the divi novensiles and di indigetes, and finally by the Manes and Tellus (§ 164). In any case there can be no doubt concerning the archaic character of the triad Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus. The statutes and functions of the three major flamens sufficiently indicate the structure of the gods for whose cults they were responsible. Jupiter26 is above all the sovereign god, the celestial thunderer, source of the sacred and regent of Justice, guarantor of universal fecundity and cosmocrat, though he does not govern war. That is the domain of Mars (Mavors, Mamers), who, for all the Italics, represents the war god. Sometimes Mars is also associated with peaceful rites, but this represents a phenomenon that is well known in the history of religions: the totalitarian, "imperialistic"
25. Varro divided them into certi ("determined) and incerti, among which he distinguished twenty as principal (select!) gods; see Augustine, Civ. dei 7. 2. 26. The name is found in Oscian, in Umbrian, and in the Latin dialects.



124 ROMAN RELIGION
tendency of certain gods to go beyond the proper sphere of their activity. This appears especially in the case of Quirinus. 27 However, as we have seen (§ 165), the flamen Quirinalis takes part only in three ceremonies connected with cereals. Moreover, etymologically Quirinus is closely related to the assembly (covirites) of the Roman people; in short, he represents the "third function" in the Indo-European tripartite division. But at Rome, as elsewhere, the third function underwent a decided fragmentation, explicable by its plurivalence and its dynamism. As for Janus and Vesta, their being added to the archaic triad probably continues an Indo-European tradition. According to Varro, the prima belong to Janus, the summa to Jupiter. Jupiter, then, is the rex, for the prima are outclassed by the summa, the former having their advantage only in the order of time, the latter in the order of dignitas. 28 Spatially, Janus is on thresholds of houses and at gates. In the temporal cycle, it is he who governs the "beginnings of the year." Similarly, in historical times Janus is placed at the beginning: he was the first king of Latium and the sovereign of a golden age when men and gods lived together (Ovid, Fasti 1. 247-48).29 He is imagined as bifrons (two-faced) because "every passage supposes two places, two states, the one that is left and the one that is entered" (Dumezil, p. 337). His archaism is beyond doubt, for the Indo-Iranians and the Scandinavians also know "first gods." The name of Vesta derives from an Indo-European root meaning "to burn"; the perpetual fire of the ignis Vestae constitutes the hearth of Rome. The fact that only the sanctuary of the Vesta is round (all other temples being quadrangular) is explained, as Dumezil has shown, by the Indian doctrine of the symbolism of Earth and Heaven. Temples must be inaugurated and oriented
27. This god is sometimes found grouped with Mars Gradivus; they both possess sacred shields (ancilia, Livy, 5. 52); and Romulus, son of Mars, representative of magical and martial royalty, is assimilated to Quirinus after his death. 28. Varro, cited by Saint Augustine, Civ. dei 7. 9. 1; see Dumezil's commentary, La rei. rom. arch., p. 333.
29. Similarly, Janus presides over certain natural "beginnings": he insured the conception of the embryo, he is held to have founded religion, to have built the first temples, to have instituted the Saturnalia, etc.; see the sources cited by Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 337.



Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus; the Capitoline triad 125
in accordance with the four celestial directions; but the house of Vesta must not be inaugurated, since all the power of the goddess is from the earth; her sanctuary is an aedes sacra, not a templum. 30 Vesta was not represented by images; fire was enough to represent her (Ovid, Fasti 6. 299). This is yet another proof of archaism and conservatism, for the absence of images was originally characteristic of all the Roman divinities. Under the Etruscan domination, the old triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus loses its actuality; it is replaced by the triad Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, instituted in the days of the Tarquins. The Etrusco-Latin influence, also bringing with it some Greek elements, is evident. The divinities now have statues. Jupiter Optimus Maximus, as he will henceforth be called, is presented to the Romans under the Etruscanized image of the Greek Zeus. His cult undergoes changes. Moreover, the triumph granted by the Senate to a victorious general takes place under the sign of Jupiter. During the ceremony, the triumphing general becomes Jupiter's double: he makes his way in a chariot and is crowned with laurel, wearing the trappings of the god. 31 Despite the presence of Juno and Minerva in his temple, the one master is Jupiter; it is to him that the vow and the dedication are addressed. "Juno," Dumezil observes, "is the most important of the Roman goddesses but also the most disconcerting" (p. 299). Her name, Juno, derives from a root that expresses "the vital force." Her functions are many; she rules over various festivals connected with the fertility of women (as Lucina, she is invoked during childbearing) but also with the beginnings of the months, the "rebirth" of the moon, etc. However, on the Capitoline she was Regina, a title that reflected a tradition strong enough to be accepted under the Republic. In short, Juno was associated with the three functions of the Indo-European ideology: sacred royalty, military force, and fertility. Dumezil compares this multivalence with a conception common to Vedic India and Iran,
30. See Dumezil, p. 323; similarly, in Iran, Atar, Fire, was put at the end of the list of the Amesha Spentas (Dumezil, p. 329). 31. Servius, ad Vergil, Eclogue 4.27. Plutarch, Aemilius Paulus 32-34, gives a detailed description of Aemelius Paulus' famous triumph after the victory of Pydna (ca. 168); see Dumezil's commentary, pp. 296-98.



126 ROMAN RELIGION
namely, the goddess who assumes all three functions and reconciles them, thus constituting the model of woman in society.32 As for Minerva, she was the patroness of arts and artisans. The name is probably Italic (derived from the Indo-European root *men-, meaning any mental activity); however, the Romans received it through the Etruscans. But in Etruria Menrva (Minerva) already represented an adaptation of Pallas Athena. In the last analysis, the Capitoline triad does not continue any Roman tradition. Only Jupiter represented the Indo-European heritage. The association of Juno and Minerva was the work of the Etruscans. For them, too, the divine triad played a part in the hierarchy of the pantheon. We know, for example, that it presided over the foundation of temples (see Servius ad Aeneid 1. 422). But that is almost all that we know.
167. The Etruscans: Enigmas and hypotheses
Rome was early confronted by the Etruscan world. Yet it is hard to define the reciprocal influences of their cultures. The archeological documentation (tombs, frescoes, statues, various objects) testifies to a highly developed civilization, but we do not know the Etruscan language. Then, too, no historian of antiquity presented the religion, culture, and history of the Etruscans as had been done for the Thracians, the Celts, or the Germans. Furthermore, the essential data concerning certain aspects of Etruscan religion are not supplied by Latin authors before the first century B.C., when the original heritage had undergone Hellenistic influences. Finally, even the origin of the Etruscan people is disputed, which lessens the value of comparative deductions. According to the tradition transmitted by Herodotus (1. 94), the Etruscans descended from the Lydians. And in fact their Asian origin appears to be confirmed by some inscriptions discovered at Lemnos. But the cultural forms developed in ~truria do not reflect Asian realities. What is certain is the symbiosis early realized between the conquerors from overseas and the
32. See Dumezil, pp. 307 fT., where he analyzes the function of Sarasvati and Aniihita.



The Etruscans: Enigmas and hypotheses 127
original popUlations settled between the Po and the Tiber, that is, in the region that, in the sixth century, constituted Etruria. The civilization of the Etruscans was certainly superior: they possessed a considerable fleet, practiced commerce, used iron, and built fortified cities. Their principal political organization was the federation of cities; the metropolis had twelve of these. But the population of these cities was Etruscan only in part; the remainder was made up of Umbrians, Veneti, Ligurians, and other Italic peoples. Greek influences were soon felt, in both art and religion. The Etruscan god Fufluns was represented as Dionysus, beside Semla (Semele) and Areatha (Ariadne). We find Artumes (Artemis) and Aplu (Apollo). On the other hand, a number of authentic Etruscan divinities bear Latin or Faliscan names: Uni (Juno), Nethuns (Neptune), Maris (Mars), Satres (Saturn). The name of the mythological hero Mastarna (Etruscan: maestrna) derives from the Latin magister. The assimilation of Roman to Greek divinities had the Etruscan precedent as its model: Juno, Minerva, and Neptune became Hera, Athena, and Poseidon, in imitation of the Etruscan Uni, Menrva, and Nethuns. In short, Etruscan culture, and especially Etruscan religion, are characterized by an early assimilation of Italic and Greek elements.33 To be sure, the synthesis is an original one, for the Etruscan people developed borrowed ideas in accordance with its own genius. But we do not know Etruscan mythology and theology. We do not dare consider even Hercle (Heracles) to be an exception; for, despite Jean Bayet's efforts, we know only that he was extremely popular in Etruria and that he had an original mythology, different from the Greek tradition and even including some elements of Oriental origin (Melkart).34 As for Etruscan theology, it would be vain to believe that it could be reconstructed on the basis of some late statements concerning the

128 ROMAN RELIGION
Etruscan "books." As we shall see, these statements deal almost exclusively with various divinatory techniques. In default of texts, scholars have concentrated on detailed study of the archeological material. The archaic structure of the cult of the dead and of the chthonic goddesses is reminiscent of the tombs and statues of Malta, Sicily, and the Aegean (see §34). The necropolises-veritable cities of the dead-rose beside the cities of the living. The tombs were richly furnished, especially with weapons for men and jewels for women. Human sacrifice was practiced; the custom later gave rise to the gladiatorial combats. The funerary inscriptions give only the dead person's maternal ancestry. Whereas men's tombs were decorated with a phallus, women's tombs displayed cippi in the shape of houses. Woman incarnated the house itself, hence the family.35 Bachofen spoke of "matriarchy"; what appears to be certain is the eminent position of women in Etruscan society. Women took part in banquets side by side with men. Greek writers had observed with surprise that Etruscan wives enjoyed a freedom granted in Greece only to hetairai. In fact they showed themselves before men without veils, and funerary frescoes represent them in their transparent dresses, encouraging combats between naked ath
letes by their cries and gestures. 36 At the end of the Republic the Romans knew that the Etruscan religion possessed "books" that had been communicated by supernatural personages-by Tages or the nymph Vegoie. According to the legend, the former one day emerged from a furrow; he had the appearance of a child but the wisdom of an old man. The crowd that quickly gathered around Tages carefully wrote down his teaching, and this was the origin of the haruspicinae disciplinaY The mythical motif of the revelation of a "sacred book" (or a book containing a secret doctrine) by a supernatural
35. Funerary phalli make their appearance beginning with the fourth century, whereas cippi in the shape of houses are documented much earlier. The Etruscan funerary inscription mentioned the father's first name and the family name ofthe mother: "the mother was regarded less as a personality than as a member of her lineage" (Altheim, A History of Roman Religion, pp. 51ff. 36. Altheim, ibid., pp. 61 fT. 37. Cicero, De Div. 2. 51. Lydus states that Greeks assimilate the child Tages to the chthonian Hermes.



The Etruscans: Enigmas and hypotheses 129
being is documented from Egypt and Mesopotamia down to medieval India and Tibet. This scenario became especially popular during the Hellenistic period. The epiphany of Tages as puer aeternus suggests Hermeticism (see §209), which does not necessarily imply an alchemical (hence late) "reading" ofthe Etruscan tradition. For our purpose what is important is the fact that, at the beginning of the first century B.C., the Etruscans were believed to have preserved certain supernatural revelations in their libri. Essentially these texts can be classified as libri Julgurales (the theory of thunderbolts), libri rituales (to which the acherontici are joined), and libri haruspicini (completed by the libri Jatales).
The doctrine of thunderbolts, as we know it by the explanations of Seneca and Pliny,38 comprised a repertory that gave the meaning of thunder for each day of the year. In other words, the sky, divided into sixteen sections, constituted a virtual language, actualized by meteorological phenomena. The meaning of a thunderbolt was revealed by the portion of the sky from which it came and the portion in which it ended. The eleven different types of thunderbolt were manipulated by different gods. Hence the message was of divine origin and was transmitted in a "secret language," accessible only to specialized priests, the haruspices. The analogies with Chaldean doctrine have been aptly brought
out. 39 But in the form in which it has been transmitted to us, the theory of thunderbolts shows certain influences exercised by Hellenistic science, from the Meteorologica of the pseudoAristotle to the conceptions of the "Chaldean magi."40 However, in the last analysis these influences modified principally the language, by adapting it to the style of the contemporary Zeitgeist. The fundamental idea, and especially the homology macrocosm/ microcosm, is archaic. So, too, haruspicy-that is, the interpretation of signs inscribed on the entrails of victims-presupposed correspondence among the three planes of reference: divine, cosmic, human. The peCUliarities of different areas of the organ indicated the gods'

decision and, in consequence, predicted the imminent unfolding of historical events. The bronze model of a sheep's liver, discovered at Piacenza in 1877, contains a certain number of lines
drawn by a graver and the names of some forty divinities.41 The model represents both the structure of the world and the distribution of the pantheon. The doctrine of the homology macrocosm/microcosm also informs what we may call the Etruscan conception of history. According to the librifatales, a human life extends over twelve hebdomads; after the twelfth, men "go out of their minds" and
the gods no longer send them any sign.42 Similarly, peoples and states, Etruria as well as Rome, have a term fixed by the same norms that govern the cosmos. Some scholars have referred to the pessimism of the Etruscans, especially in connection with their belief in strong cosmic and existential determinism. But what we have here is an archaic conception, held by many traditional societies: man is in solidarity with the major rhythms of the Creation, because all the modes of existence-cosmic, historical, human-iterate, on their specific plane of reference, the exemplary model revealed by the cyclical trajectory of life. It is difficult to reconstruct the Etruscan beliefs concerning death and existence beyond the grave. From the fourth century the tomb paintings depict underworlds that are "different from the Greek ones but inspired by them: the dead man travels on horseback or in a chariot; he is received into the other world by a group of men who are perhaps his ancestors; a feast awaits him, presided over by Hades and Persephone, who here' are called Eita and Phersipnai."43 On the other hand, the paintings represent a whole demonology that is not Greek in origin. The protagonist, Charun, despite his Greek name, is an original creation of Etruscan mythology. "His hooked nose suggests a bird of prey and his ears a horse; his grinding teeth, on the monuments
41. The age of the model is still in dispute; it probably dates from the third or second century B.C. The analogies with Mesopotamian hepatoscopy are obvious; they were presumably strengthened by later influences. 42. Varro, text cited and commented on by Bouche-Leclerq.

where the cruel grin on his lips reveals them, suggest the image of a carnivore ready to devour its victims."44 After killing him, Charun accompanies his victim on his journey to Hades. But his part ends at the entrance to the other world, where, to judge from the scenes painted on tomb walls, the dead man enjoys a postexistence that is rich in pleasures. The fragments of the libri acherontici are too few to permit any comparison with the Egyptian Book ofthe Dead. According to the Christian writer Arnobius (fourth century): "In its libri acherontici, Etruria promises that by offering the blood of certain animals to certain divinities, souls may become divine and will escape the condition of mortality" (Adversus nationes 2. 62). Servius adds an important detail: after certain sacrifices, souls are transformed into gods who are termed animales to recall their origin (ad Aeneid 3. 168). We should then have here a deification obtained as the result of blood rituals, which may be interpreted either as an indication of archaism or as a sacrificesacrament comparable to initiation into the Mysteries of Mithra (see § 217). In any case, the "deification of souls" adds a new dimension to Etruscan eschatology. In the last analysis, the essence of Etruscan religious thought escapes us. The prestige that the Etruscans' methods of divination, of orientatio, and of the building of cities and sacred edifices enjoyed from the beginnings of Rome indicates the cosmological structure of their theology and seems to explain their efforts to solve the enigma of historical time. In all probability these conceptions contributed to the maturing of Roman religion.
168. Crises and catastrophes: From the Gallic suzerainty to the Second Punic War
In ca. 496, soon after the expulsion of the last Etruscan king and the inauguration of the Republic, a temple was erected at the foot of the Aventine to a new triad: Ceres, Liber, and Libera. Probably politics played a part in the founding of this new cult, devoted to three divinities who were patrons of fertility. The

sanctuary, a place long consecrated to agrarian cults, belonged to representatives of the plebs.45 Etymologically, Ceres means "Growth" personified. The existence of a flamen Cerealis and the special character of the rituals celebrated on the occasion of the Cerealia (April 19) confirm the goddess's archaism. As for Liber, his name appears to be derived from the Indo-European root *leudh, whose meaning is "he of germination, he who assures birth and the harvest.' '46 According to Saint Augustine (Civ. dei 7. 3), the pair Liber-Libera were favorable to procreation and to universal fecundity by "liberating" the semen in the course of sexual union (Civ. dei 7. 9). In some parts of Italy their festival, the Liberalia (March 17), included licentious elements: procession of a phallus, which the chastest matrons had to crown publicly, obscene words, etc. (Civ. dei 7.21). But the triad Ceres, Liber, Libera was very soon assimilated (the interpretatio graeca!) to the trio Demeter, Dionysus (Bacchus), Persephone (Proserpine)Y Become famous under the name Bacchus, Liber will have exceptional good fortune as the result of the spread of the Dionysiac cult (see below, pp. 135-36). Rome was already familiar with the Greek gods in the sixth century, during the rule of the Etruscan kings. But from the beginnings of the Republic we witness the rapid assimilation of Greek divinities: the Dioscuri in 499, Mercury in 495, Apollo in 431 (on the occasion of pestilences; so it was the "healer god" who was first introduced). Venus, originally a common noun meaning a magical charm, was identified with the Greek Aphrodite; but the goddess's structure changed later, under the influence of the Trojan legend. A similar process characterizes the assimilation of Latin and Italiot divinities. Diana was received from the Albans and was finally homologized to Artemis. In ca. 396 Juno Regina, the patron goddess of Veii, was ceremonially invited to establish herself in Rome. Livy, in a famous passage (5. 21. 3-22), describes the rite of the evocatio: the dictator Camillus addressed the goddess ofthe beseiged: "I beseech thee,

Queen Juno, that dwellest now in Veii, to come with us, when we have gotten the victory, to our city-soon to be thine, toothat a temple meet for thy majesty may there receive thee." The people of Veii did not know "that they were already given up by their own soothsayers and by foreign oracles; that some of the gods had already been invited to share in their despoiling, while others, having been entreated to quit their city, were beginning to look to new homes in the temples of their enemies; or that this was the last day they were themselves to live."48 The invasion by the Celts during the first quarter of the fourth century had interrupted contacts with Hellenism. The devastation of Rome (ca. 390) was so thorough that some Romans had thought of abandoning the ruins forever and establishing themselves at Veii. Like Egypt after the Hyksos incursion (see § 30), the burning of the city shook the Romans' confidence in their historical destiny. It was not until after the victory of Sentinum (ca. 295) that Rome and Italy freed themselves from Gallic suzerainty. Communications with the Greek world were reestablished, and the Romans resumed their policy of conquest. Toward the end of the third century Rome was the greatest power in Italy. Thenceforth, political vicissitudes will have repercussions, sometimes serious, on the traditional religious institutions. For a people who were inclined to read in historical events so many divine epiphanies, their military victories or disasters were charged with religious meanings. When, soon afterward, the Second Punic War threatened the very existence of the Roman state, religion underwent a transformation in depth. Rome appealed to all the gods, whatever their origin. The haruspices and the Sibylline Books revealed that the causes of military disasters lay in ritual faults of various kinds. Obeying the indications of the Sibylline Books, the Senate promulgated saving measures: sacrifices, lustrations, ceremonies, and unusual processions, even human sacrifices. The disaster at Cannae (ca. 216), made all the more threatening by many prodigies and by incest committed by two Vestals, decided the Senate to send Fabius Pictor to consult the oracle at Delphi. At Rome the Sibylline Books prescribed human sacrifices: two

Greeks and two Gauls were buried alive (Livy, 21. 57. 6).49 We probably have here a rite that is archaic in structure: "creative murder." 50 Finally, in ca. 205-204, on the eve of the victories over Hannibal and following a suggestion in the Sibylline Books, Rome introduced the first Asiatic divinity, Cybele, the Great Mother of Pessinonte (Livy, 29. 10 ff.). The famous black stone symbolizing the goddess was brought to Pergamum by a Roman fleet. Solemnly received at Ostia, Cybele was installed in her temple on the Palatine.51 However, the orgiastic nature of the cult and, above all, the presence of eunuch priests were too strongly in contrast with Roman austerity. The Senate lost no time before carefully regulating the manifestations ofthe cult. Sacrifices were strictly confined to the interior of the temple, except for an annual procession that conducted the sacred stone to its bath. Roman citizens were forbidden to sacrifice to Cybele according to the Anatolian rite. The personnel was limited to a priest, a priestess, and their assistants, but neither Romans nor their slaves had the right to perform these functions. As for the official Roman cult, it was controlled by an urban praetor. However, in ca. 204 the Senate permitted the organization of sodalities, consisting exclusively of members of the aristocracy, whose principal function was limited to banquets in honor of Cybele. In short, the introduction ofthe first Asiatic divinity was the work of the aristocracy. The patricians considered that Rome was called to play an important part in the Orient. But Cybele's presence had no consequences. The invasion by Oriental cults will take place more than a century later. Certainly, after the
49. In ca. 226, likewise after a consultation ofthe Sibylline Books, two Greeks and two Gauls were buried alive to ward off the threat of a Gallic invasion (Plutarch, Marcellus 3. 4). Similar immolations took place at the end of the second century (Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. 83). Human sacrifices were forbidden by the Senate, ca. 97. 50. In order to make sure of victory, Xerxes had nine youths and nine girls buried alive when he set sail for Greece. We know, too, that on the eve of the Battle of Salamis ThemistocJes, in obedience to an oracle, had three young prisoners sacrificed (Plutarch, Vita Them. 13). On this mythical theme, see Eliade, Zalmoxis, the Vanishing God, pp. 183 ff.
51. It should be pointed out that, because of the legend of Aeneas, Cybele was no longer a foreign goddess.



Crises and catastrophes 135
dreadful sufferings and the terror of the Second Punic War, Rome was doubly attracted by the Asiatic divinities. But here, once again, we find the characteristically Roman ambiguity: at once the need to control foreign cults and fear oflosing their benefits.52 However, the consequences of these two wars, and of the overwhelming final victory, could not be avoided. On the one hand, a considerable number both of refugees from all the regions of Italy and offoreign slaves gathered in Rome. On the other hand, certain sections of the population increasingly broke away from the traditional religion. In Rome, as throughout the Mediterranean world from the fourth century on, the need for a personal religious experience became more and more intense. Such a religious experience was accessible especially in the conventicles and closed societies of the Mystery-religion type-in other words, in the secret associations that escaped state control. This is why the Senate had forbidden Roman citizens, and even their slaves, to take part in the Anatolian cult of Cybele. In ca. 186 the authorities discovered, with surprise and indignation, the existence in Rome itself of bacchanalia, that is, of nocturnal "orgiastic mysteries." The cult of Dionysus had become widely disseminated in the Mediterranean world, especially in the Hellenistic period (see § 206). Following the Roman conquest of Magna Graecia, esoteric associations of mystai spread through the peninsula, especially in Campania. Indeed, it was a Campanian priestess-seeress who had introduced into Rome a secret cult, modified according to her own directions and including certain rites comparable to those of the Mysteries. In consequence of a denunciation that was immediately made public by the consul, an investigation revealed the size of the cult and its orgiastic character. Its adherents, who numbered more than 7,000, were accused of many abominations: not only did they swear to reveal nothing, but they practiced pederasty and organized murders in order to obtain fortunes. The rites were performed in the greatest secrecy. According to Livy (39. 13. 12), men, their bodies tossing as if they were demented, uttered prophecies; women "in the dress of bacchantes, with disheveled hair," ran to the Tiber, "carrying blazing torches,"

which they thrust into the water and withdrew still on fire, for "they contained live sulphur mixed with calcium."53 Some of the accusations resemble the cliches used later in all trials for heresy and witchcraft. The promptness and intensity of the investigation and the severity of the suppression (several thousands of executions) show the political nature of the prosecution. The authorities denounced the danger of secret associations, hence the danger of a plot able to attempt a coup d' etat. No doubt the Bacchic cult was not entirely abolished, but Roman citizens were forbidden to practice it. In addition, all Bacchic ceremonies, which were strictly limited to five participants, had to be authorized by a decision of the Senate. The cult buildings and objects were destroyed, except for those that had "something sacred." All these panicky measures show how greatly the Senate suspected religious associations that were not under its control. The senatus consultum against the bacchanals was never to lose its validity; three centuries later, it served as a model for the persecutions of Christians.
53. They were further accused of causing those who refused to join in their crimes and debauches to disappear in some horrible manner (Livy, 39. 13. 13). For a detailed analysis of Livy's text and of the senatus consultum of 186 concerning the bacchanals, see Adrien Bruhl, Liber Pater, pp. 82-116.

169. Persistence of prehistoric elements
The impact of the Celts on the ancient history of Europe was felt for less than two centuries: from the conquest of northern Italy in the fifth century (Rome was attacked ca. 390) to the pillage of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, ca. 279. Soon afterward, the doom of the historical destiny of the Celts was sealed: caught between the expansion of the Germanic tribes and the pressure from Rome, their power steadily declined. But the Celts were inheritors of a protohistory that was remarkably rich and creative. As we shall very soon see, information contributed by archeology is of great importance for an understanding of Celtic religion. The proto-Celts were, in all probability, the authors of the socalled Urnfield ' culture, which was developed in central Europe
between ca. 1300 and ca. 700. They lived in villages, practiced agriculture, used bronze, and burned their dead. Their first migrations (tenth and ninth centuries) took them to France, Spain, and Great Britain. Between ca. 700 and ca. 600 the use of iron spread in central Europe; this was the so-called Hallstatt culture, characterized by a marked social stratification and by different funerary rites. Probably these innovations were the result of Iranian cultural influences carried by the Cimmerians (of Black Sea origin). It was then that the Celtic military aristocracy originated. Corpses (at least those of chiefs) were no longer burned but, accompanied by their weapons and other precious objects,
1. So termed because the dead were cremated and their ashes put in urns that were later buried in a cemetery.



138 CELTS, GERMANS, THRACIANS, GETAE
were laid in a four-wheeled chariot, which was then buried in a funerary chamber covered by a mound. About 500, during the second Iron Age, known by the name of La Tene, the artistic creativity of the Celtic genius reached its height. The jewelry and countless metal objects brought to light by excavations have been termed a "glory of barbarian art, a great, if limited, contribution by the Celts to European culture."~ In view of the scarcity of written sources for Celtic religion, the archeological documents are of inestimable value. As the result of excavations, we know that the Celts attributed great importance to sacred space, that is, to places that had been consecrated, in accordance with definite rules, around an altar on which sacrifices were performed. (As we shall see, the ritual delimitation ofthe sacred space and the symbolism of the "center of the world" are reported by ancient authors and are found in Irish mythology.) Again as the result of excavations, we know that different kinds of offerings were placed in ritual pits from two to three meters deep. Just like the Greek hothros or the Roman mundus, these ritual pits insured communication with the divinities ofthe world underground. Such pits are documented from the second millennium; they were sometimes filled with objects of gold and silver, heaped up in richly decorated ceremonial caldrons.3 (Recollections of these pits communicating with the other world, and of underground treasures, are found in medieval legends and Celtic folklore.) No less important is the confirmation furnished by archeology concerning the dissemination and continuity of the cult of skulls. From the limestone cylinders decorated with stylized heads found in Yorkshire, dating back to the eighteenth century B.C. and continuing on into the Middle Ages. skulls and representations of "severed heads" are documented in all the areas inhabited by the Celtic tribes. Excavations have brought to light skulls placed in niches or inserted into the walls of sanctuaries, heads sculptured in stone, and countless wooden images immersed in springs. Indeed, the religious importance of skulls was noted by the classic authors, and, despite ecclesiastical inter

dicts, the glorification of the severed head plays an important part in medieval legends and in British and Irish folklore. 4 It is indubitably a cult whose roots go deep into prehistory and that still survived down to the nineteenth century in several Asiatic cultures.5 The original magico-religious value of the severed head was later reinforced by beliefs that localized in the skull the original source of semen virile and the seat of the "mind." Among the Celts the skull was outstandingly the receptacle of a sacred force, of divine origin, which protected its owner from all kinds of dangers and at the same time insured him health, wealth, and victory. In short, the archeological discoveries bring out, on the one hand, the archaism of Celtic culture and, on the other hand, the continuity, from protohistory to the Middle Ages, of certain central religious ideas. A number of these ideas and customs belonged to the old religious stock of the Neolithic, but they were early assimilated by the Celts and partially integrated into the theological system they had inherited from their Indo-European ancestors. The astonishing cultural continuity demonstrated by archeology allows the historian of Celtic religion to make use of late sources, first of all the Irish texts composed between the sixth and eighth centuries, but also the epic legends and the folklore that still survived in Ireland down to the end of the nineteenth century.
170. The Indo-European heritage
The archaism of Celtic culture is corroborated by other sources. We find in Ireland a number of ideas and customs that are documented in ancient India, and Irish prosody is similar to that of Sanskrit and Hittite; as Stuart Piggott expresses it, this represents "fragments of a common heritage from the second millennium."6 Just like the Brahmans, the Druids attributed great importance to memory (see §172). The ancient Irish laws were

composed in verse in order to facilitate memorizing them. The parallelism between the Irish and the Hindu judicial treatises is shown not only in their form and technique but also, at times, in their diction.7 Other examples of Indo-Celtic parallelism are: fasting as a means of strengthening ajudicial petition; the magicoreligious value of truth;8 insertion of passages in verse into epic narrative prose, especially in dialogues; the importance of bards, and their relations with sovereigns.9 Because writing was ritually prohibited by the continental Celts we have not even one text on their religion composed by a native. Our only sources are the few descriptions by GrecoLatin authors and a large number of figured monuments, most of them from the Gallo-Roman period. In contrast, the insular Celts, concentrated in Scotland, Wales, and especially Ireland, produced an abundant epic literature. Despite the fact that it was composed after the conversion to Christianity, this literature in large part continues the pre-Christian mythological tradition, and this is also true of the rich Irish folklore. The information given by the classic authors is frequently confirmed by Irish documents. In his De Bello Gallico (6. 13), Caesar states that the Gauls have two privileged classes-the Druids and the knights-and a third, oppressed, class, the "people." This is the same social tripartition, reflecting the well-known Indo-European ideology (§ 63), that is found in Ireland soon after
Gaelic world until the eighteenth century and in India down to our day; see his "The Archaism of Irish Tradition," p. 246. See also, by the same author, Celts and Aryans, pp. 52 ff. Studying Irish and Indian funerary rites, Hans Hartmann concludes (Der Totenkult in Irland, p. 207) that the structure of the Irish mentality is closer to that of ancient India than to the mentality of England or Germany. 7.

We add that analogies are also found with the Sumero-Akkadian world. These can be explained by contacts of the Indo-Europeans with the peoples of the ancient Near East (see H. Wagner, "Studies in the Origins of Early Celtic Tradition," pp. 6 ff. and passim).



The Indo-European heritage 141
its conversion to Christianity: under the authority of the *rig (the phonetic equivalent of Sanskrit riij-, Latin reg-), society is divided into the class of Druids, the military aristocracy (the flaith, properly "power," the exact phonetic equivalent of Sanskrit k~atra), and the stock-breeders "the b6 airig, the free (airig) men, who are defined as owners of cows (b6)."10 We shall have occasion further on to point out other survivals of the Indo-European religious system among the Celts. But at this point it is important to state that "the survivals common to the Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic societies" are explained by "the existence of powerful colleges of priests, who were the repositories of sacred traditions that they maintained with formalistic strictness."11 As for the tripartite Indo-European theology, it can still be recognized in the list of their gods handed down to us by Caesar, and, radically historicized, it survives in Irish tradition. Georges Dumezil and Jan de Vries have shown that the chiefs of the legendary people the Tuatha De Danann actually represent the gods of the first two func~ions, while the third is embodied in the people of the Fomors, considered to be the previous inhabitants of the island. 12 Caesar presents the Celtic pantheon in an interpretatio romana. "Among the gods," the consul wrote, "they most worship Mercury. There are numerous images of him; they declare him the inventor of all arts, the guide for every road and journey, and they deem him to have the greatest influence for all moneymaking and traffic. After him they set Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Of these deities they have almost the same idea as all other nations: Apollo drives away diseases, Minerva supplies the first principles ofarts and crafts, Jupiterholds the empire ofheaven, Mars controls the wars" (B.G. 6. 17; trans. H. J. Edwards). The authenticity, and hence the value, of this interpretatio romana of the Gallic pantheon have been much discussed. Caesar had considerable knowledge of the customs and beliefs of

the Celts. He had already been proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul before he began his campaign in Transalpine Gaul. But since we know nothing of continental Celtic mythology, we know very little about the gods mentioned by Caesar. It is surprising that he does not put "Jupiter" at the head ofthe list. Presumably the great celestial god had lost his primacy among the inhabitants of cities that, for at least four centuries, had been exposed to Mediterranean influences. The phenomenon is common in the history of religions, as well in the ancient Near East (see §§ 48 ff.) and among the Vedic Indians (§ 62) as among the ancient Germans (§ 176). But the "gigantic Jupiter" type of column, found in great numbers especially between the Rhine, the Moselle, and the Saone and also erected by certain Germanic tribes, carries on an archaic symbolism, namely, that of the celestial supreme being. The first point to be noted is that these columns did not cel~brate military triumphs, like those of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. They were not set up in forums or streets but far from (;~ties. What is more, this Celtic Jupiter was often represented with a wheel,13 and the wheel plays an important part among the Celts. The wheel with four spokes represents the year, that is, the cycle of the four seasons. Indeed, the terms designating the
"wheel" and the "year" are identical in the Celtic languages. 14 As Werner Muller well saw, this Celtic Jupiter is consequently the celestial cosmocrator god, lord of the year, and the column symbolizes the axis mundi. On the other hand, the Irish texts mention Dagda, "the good god," and there is agreement in identifying him with the Gallic god whom Caesar designated by the divine name "Jupiter."15 Archeology has confirmed Caesar's statement concerning the popularity of "Mercury": witness more than two hundred statues and bas-reliefs and nearly five hundred inscriptions. We do not know his Gallic name, but presumably it was the same as that of the god Lug, who plays an important part among the

The Indo-European heritage 143
insular Celts. Several cities bear the name Lug (e.g., Lugdunum, modem Lyons), and his festival was celebrated in Ireland, a proof that the god was known in all the Celtic countries. The Irish texts present Lug as the leader of an army, using magic on the battlefield, but also as a master poet and the mythical ancestor of an important tribe. These characteristics make him comparable to Wodan-OOinn, whom Tacitus also assimilated to Mercury. We may conclude from this that Lug represented sovereignty in its magical and military aspect: he is violent and to be feared, but he protects warriors as well as bards and magicians. Just like OOinn-Wodan (§ 175), he is characterized by his magico-spiritual capacities, which explains why he was homologized with Mercury-Hermes. 16 "To Mars," writes Caesar (B.G. 6. 17), "when they have determined on a decisive battle," the Gauls "dedicate whatever spoils they may take. After a victory they sacrifice such living things as they have taken, and all the other effects they gather into one place." We do not know the Celtic name of the Gallic war god. The numerous votive inscriptions to Mars often include surnames: Albioriz, "King of the World," Rigisamos, "Most Royal," Caturix, "King of Combat," Camulus, "Powerful,'.' Segomo, "Victorious," etc. Certain surnames are incomprehensible, but even when they can be translated they do not increase our knowledge. The same may be said of more than a hundred inscriptions dedicated to Hercules; like those dedicated to Mars, they indicate no more than the existence of a war god. If we take into account other pieces of information, the structure of this god appears to be comparatively complex. According to the Greek historian Lucian of Samosata (second century A. D.), the Celtic name of Hercules was Ogmios. Lucian had seen an image of the god: it represented a bald old man with wrinkled skin, dragging along a great number of men and women fastened to his tongue by small gold and amber chains. Though the fastening was weak, they did not want to escape but followed him "gay and joyous, praising him." A native of the country explained the image to him: they, the Celts, do not represent the

144 CELTS,GERMANS,THRACIANS, GETAE
art of words by Hermes, like the Greeks, but by Hercules, "because Hercules is much stronger" (Lucian, Heracles 1-7). This text has inspired contradictory interpretations,17 The chained men have been compared to the Maruts who accompany Indra and to the troop of EinheIjar who escort Ol'5inn-Wodan (J. de Vries). On the other hand, Ogmios has been compared to Varul}a, the "master binder" (F. Le Roux). Probably the Celtic "Mars" had assimilated certain attributes proper to the sovereign godmagician, at the same time strengthening his function as psychopomp. (As we shall see in § 175, among the Germans Ol'5inn had, on the contrary, partly supplanted the war god.) To Ogmios there corresponds, in Irish epic literature, the god Ogma, the exemplary champion. But he is also credited with having invented "Oghamic" writing-which is as much as to say that he combines martial force with "science" of the Ol'5innic type. Caesar presents" Apollo" as a physician-god. We do not know his Gallic name, but his epithets, found in inscriptions, generally confirm his healing character. Now the Irish texts mention Diancecht, who cures and resuscitates the Tuatha De Danann; he is also invoked in an ancient formula of exorcism. His name is cited side by side with Grobniu, the blacksmith-god. So he may be regarded as representing the gods whom Dumezil considers to be characteristic of the "third function." As for "Minerva," whose Gallic name is also unknown but whom Caesar defines as the goddess of artisans and the trades (hence also belonging to the third function), she has been compared with the goddess Brigantia, daughter of Dagda and patroness of poets, blacksmiths, and physicians.
171. Is it possible to reconstruct the Celtic pantheon?
The pantheon disguised by Caesar's interpretatio romana camouflages a religious reality that comparison with the traditions of the insular Celts makes accessible to us only in part. As for the divine names supplied by the monuments and inscriptions
17. Some of them are discussed by Fran~oise Le Roux, "Le Dieu celtique

of the Gallo-Roman period, they are, for the most part, merely descriptive or topographical epithets of the member gods of the pantheon; some scholars have wrongly regarded them as designating autonomous divinities. The only information that we have concerning the Gallic names of the gods has been handed down to us by the poet Lucan (first century A.D.). He mentions "those who propitiate with horrid victims ruthless Teutates and Esus, whose savage shrine makes men shudder, and Taranis, whose altar is no more benign than that of Scythian Diana" (Civil War [Pharsalic] 1. 444-46). The authenticity of these names is confirmed by the Gallo-Roman inscriptions that mention Esus, Taranucus (or Jupiter Taranucus), and Mars Toutatis. The author of a medieval commentary l8 tried to explain them, but his glosses are contradictory. However, his commentary furnishes precise information about the kind of sacrifice offered to each of these gods: for Teutates, a man is suffocated by being plunged into a vat; for Esus, the victim is hung on' a tree and bled to death; for Taranis-"the lord of combats and the greatest of the gods of heaven"-men are burned in a wooden manikin. One of the images on the Gundestrup caldron represents a clothed personage throwing the human victim, head first, into a receptacle. Several warriors on foot are approaching the receptacle; above them, horsemen are moving away from it. Jan de Vries (La religion des Ceites, p. 55) thinks that an initiatory rite may be represented here but that there is no connection with Teutates. (Irish epic poetry returns more than once to the theme of the king who, in a house heated white-hot, drowns in the vat into which he had thrown himself to escape the fire. There is certainly a reference here to a ritual involving human sacrifice.)19 Since the eighteenth century, the name Teutates has been translated as "Father of the Tribe." The god certainly played an

146 CELTS,GERMANS, THRACIANS, GETAE
important part in the tribe's life: he was the patron of war, but his function was more complex.20 As for Taranis, the meaning of his name is clear: its root is *taran, "thunder.' In his secondary form, Taranos, he is close to the god of the Germans, Donar.21 Like Donar, he was assimilated to Jupiter. So it is likely that the "giant Jupiter" columns were consecrated to Taranis, the "Thunderer," the ancient Celtic sky god. The divine name Esus is found in proper names, but its etymology has not been determined.22 On the bas-reliefs of two altars, Esus is depicted striking a tree: are we to think of a sacrifice by hanging? Jan de Vries holds that Esus was a Gallic god comparable to the Scandinavian Ooinn.23 The fact is that we know nothing definite. Sculpture, iconography, and inscriptions have revealed the names and images of other Gallo-Roman divinities. In certain cases we are able to make out their structure and define their religious function with the help of the mythology camouflaged in the traditions of the insular Celts. But precisely because of the conservative tendency that is characteristic of the Celtic religious genius, the results of the analysis are often indecisive. We cite as a well-known example the bas-relief bearing the name Cemunnos and representing an old man, perhaps bald-headed, with a stag's ears and antlers. It has been natural to compare a scene from the Gundestrup caldron: a person wearing stag's antlers on his head and seated in what has been mistakenly described as the "position of the Buddha" holds a necklace in one hand and in the other a ram-headed snake; he is surrounded by wild animals, among them a very fine stag. Similar images

have been found in Great Britain.24 We know that the iconography and religious symbolism of the stag are archaic. An engraved scene from Val Cammonica that goes back to the fourth century B.C. represents a god with stag's antlers and a horned snake. But, as we saw (§ 5), the "Great Magician" or "Lord of Wild Beasts" of the Trois Freres cave also wore a stag's head with many-branched antlers. So Cernunnos could be interpreted as a god of the type of the "Master of Wild Beasts."25 However, the religious symbolism of the stag is extremely complex. On the one hand, in an area that, in the protohistorical period, extended from China to western Europe, the stag, because of the periodical renewal of its antlers,26 is one of the symbols of continual creation and of renovatio. On the other hand, the stag was held to be a mythical ancestor of the Celts and the Germans;27 in addition, it was one of the best-known symbols of fecundity, but it was also a funerary animal and guide of the dead; finally, it was the game animal preferred above all others by kings and heroes, and its death at the end of the hunt
was symbolically one with the tragic death of heroes.28 Hence it is probable that Cernunnos combined other functions with those of Master of Wild Beasts. We need think only of the long, hard struggle waged by the Church against ritual dressing-up as a stag (cervulo facere) to understand the religious importance of the stag (the preferred game of the military aristocracy!) among the popular strata. The example of Cernunnos illustrates the difficulty of correctly interpreting a multivalent religious complex in the absence of its particular mythico-ritual context. The attempt to analyze the archeological documents concerning female divinities encounters a like difficulty; all that we can say is that the considerable number of statues and ex-votos confirms their importance.

plastic representations of Matres and matronae emphasize their being in part goddesses of fertility and maternity (baskets of fruits, horns of plenty; children at the breast or held on the lap, etc.). As Camille Jullian writes, they "were perhaps at once anonymous and myrionymous divinities, who were not named and who had a hundred epithets."29 But the texts of the insular Celts supply significant details. The mother of the gods was a goddess: Danu in Ireland, Don in Wales. What is more: he who would become king of Ireland (Eriu) could do so only by marrying the tutelary goddess who bore the same name; in other words, he attained to sovereignty by a hieros gamos with the Earth Goddess. This mythico-ritual scenario is one of the commonest and most persistent themes in Irish vernacular literature.3o In all probability we have here a variant of the ancient Near Eastern mythico-ritual scenario involving the sacred marriage between the God of Heaven (or of the storm or the sun) and the Earth Mother, the two being personified by the reigning sovereign and a hierodule. This hieros gamos insured the fertility of the country and the good fortune ofthe reign for a certain period. The survival of the archaic heritage in Ireland is illustrated by the rite of royal consecration, documented in the twelfth century: before the eyes of his subjects, the king copulates with a white mare, which is then killed and cooked; the meat is shared between the king and his men.31 In other words, sovereignty is attained by the hieros gamos between the king and a hippomorphic Earth Mother. Now a Gallic goddess, Epona (Regina), is represented on the monuments as sitting on a horse or standing in front of a horse or between two or more horses. Epona has been interpreted as a Mother Goddess and psychopomp;32 her

Irish counterpart, Rhiannun « *Rigantona, "Queen") was also hippomorphic. 33 Like the iconography of Great Britain during the Roman period, the vernacular literature preferred to present the mother goddesses grouped in triads. The most famous are the three Machas, personifying the tutelary goddess of the capital of Ul
ster.34 Accession to the throne is possible only by sleeping with one of the Machas. Sometimes the goddess appears as a hideous old woman and demands to share a young hero's bed, but, as soon as he lies down beside her, the old woman turns out to be a singularly beautiful girl; by marrying her, the hero obtains the sovereignty.35 The mythico-ritual theme of the old woman transformed by a kiss, which is found in the Breton Grail romances, was already known in India during the period of the Brahmal;las.36 In the epic, Queen Medb has many lovers-which is as much as to say that she had belonged to all the kings of Ireland. But it must be added that in the Celtic societies woman enjoyed considerable religious and social prestige. The ritual of the couvade, documented in Europe only among the Celts and the Basques (a pre-Indo-European people), emphasizes the magicoreligious importance of woman. Together with other archaic customs (e.g., certain funerary rituals, the mythology of death, etc.), the couvade indicates the survival of pre-Indo-European elements that presumably belonged to the autochthonous Neolithic populations. As for the goddesses, their multiple functions as divinities governing fecundity, war, destiny, and fortune are also documented among the goddesses of the Germans, which indicates, at least in part, an Indo-European heritageY To this religious complex, which goes back to European prehistory and to the protohistory of the Celts, there were progressively added Med

iterranean, Roman (more precisely, Hellenistic-syncretistic), and Christian influences. To estimate the Celtic religious genius, it is necessary to take into account both the persistence with which certain archaic elements-most importantly, the customs and beliefs connected with the "mysteries" of femininity, destiny, death, and the otherworld-were preserved and their continual revalorization from antiquity down to the premodern period.
172. The Druids and their esoteric teaching
The pages that Julius Caesar devoted to the Druids (De Bello Gallico 6. 13) represent one of the most important sources for Celtic religion. Though he does not cite him, the consul uses the information supplied by Posidonius (second century B.C.), but he also had other sources. The Druids, Caesar writes, "are concerned with divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, public and private, and the interpretation of ritual questions: a great number of young men gather about them for the sake of instruction and hold them in great honor." It is the Druids who "decide in almost all disputes, public and private"; those who do not accept their decision are forbidden to attend the sacrifices, which is equivalent to a kind of civil death. A single chief exercises supreme authority. "At his death, either any other that is preeminent in position succeeds, or, if there be several of equal standing, they strive for the primacy by the vote of the Druids, or sometimes even with armed force. These Druids, at a certain time of the year, meet within the borders of the Carnutes, whose territory is reckoned as the center of all Gaul." The Druids are dispensed from military service and from the obligation to pay taxes. Attracted by such great advantages, many come to study under them. "Report says that in the schools of the Druids they learn by heart a great number of verses, and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training. And they do not think it proper to commit these utterances to writing, although in almost all other matters, and in their public and private accounts, they make use of Greek letters." Caesar states that the Druids established this usage "because they do not wish the rule to become common property" and also because, by



The Druids and their esoteric teaching 151
relying on writing, the apprentice Druids would be in danger of neglecting memory. Their conviction is "that souls do not die but, after death, pass from one body to another; and this belief, as the fear of death is thereby cast aside, they hold to be the greatest incentive to valor. Besides this, they have many discussions about the stars and their movement, the size of the universe and that of the earth, the order of nature, the strength and the powers of the immortal gods; and they hand down their lore to the young men." Like the Brahmans, the Druids are priests (it is they who perform the sacrifices); but they are also teachers, men oflearn
ing, and philosophers.38 Their annual reunion in a "consecrated spot ... reckoned as the center of all Gaul" is extremely significant. We certainly have here a ceremonial center regarded as "center of the world."39 This symbolism, documented more or less throughout the world (see § 12), is bound up with the religious concept of sacred space and the techniques for consecrating places; as we have seen (p. 138), the construction of a sacred space was practiced by the Celts from protohistory. It is obvious that the annual gatherings of the Druids presuppose the unity of their religious ideas, despite the inevitable variety in the names of gods and in the beliefs peculiar to various tribes. In all probability the public sacrifices performed by the Druids in the territory of Gaul had as their model the liturgy of the great sacrifice celebrated at the locus consecratus, at the "center" of the country of the Carnutes.40 The Celts also practiced human sacrifice and, according to the information from Posidonius used by Diodorus Siculus (5. 31) and by Strabo (4. 4), they practiced it in different ways: the victim was struck with a sword (and the future was predicted in
38. Vendryes has shown the unity of religious vocabulary (especially terms designating abstract notions) among the Vedic Indians, the Latins, and the Celts ("L'ecriture ogamique et ses origines"). This fact demonstrates the speculative possibility that there were "specialists in the sacred" among these three Aryan-speaking groups even in the protohistorical period; see above, page 141 and note II. 39. See the examples cited by Franlfoise Le Roux, Les druides, pp. 109 ff. 40. See J. de Vries, Rei. des Celtes, p. 218. Caesar's statement concerning the "single chief" who exercises "supreme authority" among the Druids is not confirmed by other classical authors.

accordance with his convulsions and his fall), or pierced by arrows, or impaled. Caesar (B.G. 6. 16) reports that "those who are smitten with the more grievous maladies and who are engaged in the perils of battle either sacrifice human victims or vow so to do, employing the Druids as ministers for such sacrifices." Certain scholars have interpreted these facts as proof of the "barbarity" of the Celts or of the "primitive" nature, at once savage and childish, of Druidic theology. But in all traditional societies human sacrifice was fraught with a cosmological and eschatological symbolism that was singularly powerful and complex, which explains its persistence among the ancient Germans, the Geto-Dacians, the Celts, and the Romans (who, incidentally, did not forbid it until ca. 97 A.D.). This bloodstained ritual in no way indicates an intellectual inferiority or a spiritual poverty in the peoples who practice it. To give only one example; the Ngadju Dayaks of Borneo, who have elaborated one of the most consistent and elevated theologies known to the history of religions, were headhunters (like the Celts) and practiced human sacrifice. 41 All the sources emphasize the great importance of the Druids in the education of the youth. In all probability only the disciples who were preparing to join the Druidic order, and so had to study theology and the sciences thoroughly, were taught by their masters for the twenty years Caesar mentions. The rejection of writing (which explains our ignorance of the Druidic doctrine) and the importance attributed to memory and the oral transmission oflore continue the Indo-European tradition (see vol. 1, p. 432). What was taught was secret because it was esoteric, that is, inaccessible to the uninitiated-a conception that recalls the esotericism ofthe Upanishads (§§ 80 ff.) and the Tantras. As for the belief in metempsychosis, the explanation advanced by Caesar-that it was a doctrine that, "as the fear of death is thereby cast aside," is especially "calculated to stimulate cour~ age"-is simply the rationalistic interpretation of a belief in the survival of the soul. According to the Celts, Lucan writes (Civil War 1. 450 ff.), "the same breath still governs the limbs in a

different scene." Pomponius Mela (3. 3) and Timagenes (cited by Ammianus Marcellinus, 15. 9. 2) add that, in the teaching of the Druids, "souls are immortal, and after a prescribed number of years they commence upon a new life, the soul entering into another body." The belief in metempsychosis is also documented in Irish literature.42 In the absence of any direct testimony it is difficult to determine whether the postexistence of the soul implied for the Druids "immortality" and at the same time psychosomatosis (as in the Upanishads) or whether it consisted merely in an indeterminate "survival" of the soul. Since some ancient authors brought up the Orphico-Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis in connection with the Celts, a number of modern scholars have concluded that the GrecoLatin writers interpreted the Celtic beliefs in the language of Pythagoras-in other words, that they "invented" a belief unknown to the Celts themselves. But in the fifth century B.C. Herodotus explained in the same way-i.e., by the influence of Pythagoras-the belief of the Getae in the "immortality" of the soul, a belief that, furthermore, the Greek historian did not deny (§ 179). In fact, the ancient authors brought up Pythagoras precisely because the conceptions of the Getae and the Celts were reminiscent of the Orphico-Pythagorean doctrine. Doubt has also been cast on Caesar's statements concerning the scientific interests of the Druids: "they have many discussions [concerning] the stars and their movement, the size of the universe and of the earth," etc. However, the fragment of a calendar found at Coligny shows a considerably advanced astronomical knowledge. Indeed, it was possible to construct a cycle of 19 solar years, equivalent to 235 lunar months, which enabled the two calendrical systems (solar and lunar) to be reconciled. Numerous authors have looked with the same suspicion on Strabo's information concerning the astronomical knowledge of the Geto-Dacians, but, as we shall see further on (§179), excavations have brought to light the remains of two "calendaristic temples" at Sarmizegetuza and at Costesti, which were the ceremonial centers of the Geto-Dacians.
42. See some examples in Le Roux, Les druides, pp. 128-29. This author observes; however, that in Ireland metempsychosis is limited to certain mythical or divine beings (p. 130).

The suppression of the Druids under the emperors Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius aimed at annihilating Gallic nationalism. Yet in the third century, when Roman pressure lessened considerably, there was a surprising renaissance of Celtic religion, and the Druids regained their authority. But it was in Ireland that the Druids, as well as the principal religious structures, survived until the Middle Ages. What is more, the creativity of the Celtic religious genius will experience a new apogee in the literature created, beginning in the twelfth century, around the heroes engaged in the quest for the Grail (see vol. 3).
173. Yggdrasill and the cosmogony of the ancient Germans
Though having at their disposition far fuller information than the Celticists command, the historians of Germanic religion emphasize the difficulties of their undertaking. Their sources are of different kinds and of unequal value: archeological finds. writings from the Roman period (most importantly. the Germania of Tacitus), descriptions by Christian missionaries. and. above all, the poems composed by the Icelandic skalds. supplemented by a valuable manual compiled by Snorri Sturluson in the thirteenth century. Add to this that it is only in Iceland, converted to Christianity comparatively late (in the year 1000), that a sufficiently consistent oral tradition was preserved to enable us to reconstruct, at least in their chief outlines, both mythology and cult. This is as much as to say that, without supplementary proofs, our information about the beliefs of the Norwegian immigrants into Iceland cannot be regarded as valid for the generality of the German tribes. However, despite serious gaps (our lack of information concerning the Goths and the Burgundians) and despite the heterogeneousness of beliefs, resulting from the various influences (Celtic,Roman, Oriental, North Asian. and Christian) undergone by the various tribes during their dispersal through half of Europe, we cannot doubt a certain fundamental unity of the religion of the Germans. To begin with, a number of elements characteristic of the Indo-European heritage are still recognizable in



Yggdrasill and the ancient German cosmogony 155
the traditions of several tribes (first of all, the divine tripartition, the antagonistic and complementary pair of sovereign gods, the eschatology). In addition, the names of the days indicate that all the Germanic peoples venerated the same great gods. When, in the fourth century, the Germans adopted the seven-day week, they replaced the names of the Roman divinities by those of their own gods. Thus, for example, dies Mercuri was replaced by "day of6esinn-Wodan": Old High German Wuotanestac, English Wednesday, Dutch Woensdag, Old Norse Ooinnsdagr. This proves that Mercury was identified with a god known, throughout the Germanic world, by one and the same name: Oesinn-Wodan. It has been observed that the last phase of Germanic religion was dominated by intense interest in the myth of the end of the world. This interest is, in any case, a general phenomenon, documented from the second century B.C. in the Near East, Iran, Palestine, and the Mediterranean and, a century later, in the Roman Empire. But what characterizes Germanic religion is the fact that the end of the world is already announced in the cosmogony.
The fullest account of the Creation is handed down by Snorri (Gylfaginning 4-9); his chief source is an admirable poem, Va[uspa ("Prophecy ofthe Valva," i.e., "of the Seeress"), composed toward the end of the pagan period. According to these
"Prophecies" (strophe 3), in the beginning ther~ was "neither earth nor the vault of heaven" but a "giant abyss," Ginnungagap.43 The image, familiar to Oriental cosmogonies, is also found in other texts. 44 Snorri adds that in the North lay a cold and foggy region, Niflheimr, identified with the world of the dead and from which flowed a spring that gave birth to eleven rivers; in the South there was a burning country, Muspell, guarded by the giant Surtr (the "Black"). As the result of the meeting of ice and fire, an anthropomorphic being, Ymir, was born in the intermediate region. While he slept, there were born of the sweat under his arms a man and a woman, and one of his feet engendered, with the other, a son. From the melting ice there came
43. Jan de Vries interprets the word ginnunga as expressing the idea of deceit by magic, hence "spell, magic" ("Ginnungagap," pp. 41 ff.). 44. According to the "Wessobrun Prayer," a poem of Christian origin written in southern Germany in the ninth century, "there was neither earth nor high

into being a cow, Au6mbla: it was she who fed Ymir on her milk. By licking the salted ice, Au6mbla gave it the form of a man, BurL Buri married the daughter of a giant and had three children
by her: 66inn, ViIi, and ve. These three brothers decided to kill Ymir; his outpouring blood swallowed all the giants except one, who mysteriously saved himself with his wife. Then the brothers took Ymir to the middle of the great abyss and, dismembering him, produced the world from his body: from his flesh they formed the earth, from his bones the rocks, from his blood the sea, from his hair the clouds, from his skull the sky. The cosmogony based on killing and dismembering an anthropomorphic Being is reminiscent ofthe myths ofTiamat (§ 21), Puru!iia (§73), and P'an-ku (§ 129). The creation of the world is, then, the result of a blood sacrifice, and this archaic and widely disseminated religious idea justifies human sacrifice for the Germans just as it does for other peoples. In short, such a sacrificea repetition of the primordial divine act-insures the renewal of the world, the regeneration of Hfe, the cohesion of society. Ymir was bisexual:45 he engendered a human couple by himself. Bisexuality is, of course, the most effective expression of totality. Among the ancient Germans the idea of the primordial totality is strengthened by other mythological traditions, according to which Ymir, ancestor of the gods, also engendered the demonic giants (who will threaten the cosmos until the final catastrophe). Pursuing their cosmogonic labor, the three brothers created the stars and the heavenly bodies from sparks thrown out by Muspell, and they also regulated their motions, thus fixing the quotidian cycle (night and day) and the succession ofthe seasons. The earth, circular in shape, was surrounded on the outside by the great Ocean; on its shores the gods established the dwelling place of the giants. Within, they built Mi6gar6 (literally, "middle dwelling"), the world of men, defended by a fence made from
heaven, neither tree nor mountain.... No sun shone, no moon gave light. There was no glorious sea" (trans. A. R. Ellis Davidson, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe, p. 197).
45. The name Ymir has been compared to Sanskrit Yima, "of two sexes." According to Tacitus (Germania 2), the mythical ancestor of the Germans was Thisto. Now this name is associated with Old Swedish tvistra, "separated," and, like Ymir, it designates an androgynous being.



Yggdrasill and the ancient German cosmogony 157
Ymir's eyelashes. With the help of Hoenir, the taciturn god, and of L6<"5ur, a figure of which we know almost nothing, 6<"5inn created the first human pair from two trees, Askr and Embla,46 found on the beach. He animated them; then Hoenir gave them intelligence, and L6<"5ur gave them the senses and shape of men. Another myth tells of two human beings emerging from the cosmic tree, Yggdrasill, and peopling the world. During the great winter of the Ragnarok (see § 177), they will find refuge in Yggdrasill's trunk and will be fed by the dew from its branches. According to Snorri, this couple, sheltered in the cosmic tree, will survive the destruction of the world and will set out to repeople the new world that will emerge afterwards. The tree Yggdrasill, situated at the Center, symbolizes, and at the same time constitutes, the universe. Its top touches the sky and its branches spread over the world. Of its three roots, one plunges into the land of the dead (Hel), the second into the realm of the giants, and the third into the world of menY From the time of its emergence (that is, from the time that the world was organized by the gods), Yggdrasill was threatened with ruin: an eagle set out to eat its foliage, its trunk began to rot, and the snake Nf<"5hogg began gnawing at its roots. On some not distant day, Yggdrasill will fall, and that will be the end of the world (Ragnarok) . Obviously, we have here the well-known image of the Universal Tree, situated at the "center ofthe world" and connecting
the three planes: Heaven, Earth, and Hades.48 We have more than once pointed out the archaism and the considerable dissemination of this cosmological symbol. Certain Oriental and North Asian concepts have probably influenced the image and myth of Yggdrasill. But it is important to emphasize the specif
46. Askr suggests the cosmic ash tree; Embla is perhaps the same word as elmla. "elm." Anthropogony from trees is a rather widely disseminated theme in archaic mythologies; it is also documented among the Indo-Europeans. See Bonfante, "Microcosmo e macrocosmo nel mito indoeuropeo," pp. I if. 47. According to Snorri, each of the three roots descends into a well, the most famous of them being the well of the wisest of the gods, M(mir, in which 6t)inn will put his eye in pledge (§ 174), and that of destiny (Urt')arbrunnr). But probably the original tradition knew of only one well. 48. The same symbolism appears in the column Irminsul, which, the Saxons believed, held up the sky.

ically Germanic features: the Tree-that is, the cosmos-announces by its very appearance the coming decadence and the final ruin, for destiny, Ur6ar, is hidden in the subterranean well into which Yggdrasill's roots plunge; in other words, it is hidden at the very center of the universe. According to the V6!uspa (strophe 20), the goddess of destiny determines the fate of every living creature, not only men but also giants and gods. It could be said that Yggdrasill incarnates the exemplary and universal destiny of existence itself: every mode of existence-the world, the gods, life, men-is perishable and yet capable of rising again at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle.
174. The Aesir and the Vanir. 06inn and his "shamanic" powers
After establishing the ancestral pair in Mi6gar6, the gods built their own dwelling place, Asgar6, still at the center of the world, but elevated.49 The pantheon is divided into two divine groups: the Aesir and the Vanir. The most remarkable among the Aesir are Tyr, 66inn, and Thor; the first two correspond to the binomial of the sovereign gods (in Vedic India, Mitra and VaruQa), while Thor, the god with the hammer, the most inveterate enemy of the giants, is reminiscent of Indra's martial character. On the other side, the most important among the Vanir-Njor6, Freyr, and Freyja-are characterized by their wealth and by their relations with fecundity, pleasure, and peace. When we analyzed the mythical structure of the war between the Romans and the Sabines (§ 162), we alluded to the conflict that opposed the Aesir to the Vanir. This long, hard-fought, and indecisive war ends in a definitive reconciliation. The principal Vanir divinities settle down among the Aesir and, by the fecundity and wealth that they represent, complement the Aesirs' powers ofjuridical sovereignty, magic, and martial force. A number of authors have made every effort to interpret this fabulous episode as the memory of a historical conflict between

different religious beliefs: the autochthonous agriculturalists (for some, the' 'Megalithenvolker' ') and their conquerors (the" Streitaxtvolker," that is, the Aryan-speaking invaders). But Georges Dumezil has shown that what we have here is an Indo-European mythological theme, greatly historicized in Snorri's narrative.50 To be sure, the invasions of the territories inhabited by the Neolithic agricultural populations, the conquest of the autochthons by militarily superior invaders, followed by a symbiosis between these two different types of societies, or even two different ethnic groups, are facts documented by archeology; indeed, they constitute a characteristic phenomenon of European protohistory, continued, in certain regions, down to the Middle Ages. But the mythological theme of the war between the Aesir and the Vanir precedes the process of Germanization, for it is an integral part of the Indo-European tradition. In all probability, the myth served as the model and the justification for a number of local wars, ended by reconciliation of the adversaries and their integration into a common society.. We will add, however, that if the principal Aesir-Tyr, Ot'Sinn, and Th6r'-::preserve certain features characteristic of the gods of the first two functions, sovereignty and war, their figures underwent decided modifications; for they were shaped, on the one hand, in conformity with the Germanic religious genius and, on the other hand, under the impact of Mediterranean and North Asian influences. Ot'Sinn-Wodan is the most important of the gods, their father and sovereign. His analogies with Varul)a have been emphasized: both are the model of the sovereign and are masters of magic; they "bind" and paralyze their adversaries; they delight in human sacrifices.51 But, as we shall soon see, the differences between them are no less noteworthy. In a passage of the poem Hdvamdl ("Words of the High One," strophes 139-42) Ot'Sinn tells how he obtained the runes, symbol of wisdom and magical power. Hanging for nine nights from the tree Yggdrasill, "wounded by the spear and sacrificed to Ot'Sinn, myself to myself, without food or drink, lo! the runes revealed

themselves at my call." He thus obtained occult knowledge and the art of poetry. We certainly have here an initiatory rite that is parashamanic in structure. Otsinn remains hanging from the cosmic tree;52 Yggdrasill means "the horse (drasil) ofYgg," one of Otsinn's names. The gallows is called the hanged man's "horse," and we know that victims sacrificed to Otsinn were hung on trees. By wounding himself with his spear, by abstaining from water and food, the god undergoes ritual death and acquires secret wisdom of the initiatory type. Otsinn's shamanic aspect is confirmed by his horse with eight legs, Sleipnir, and by the two ravens that tell him everything that goes on in the world. Like the shamans, Otsinn can change his shape and send out his spirit in the form of an animal; he searches among the dead for secret knowledge and obtains it; he declares in Havamal (strophe 158) that he knows a charm that can make a hanged man come down from the gallows and talk with him; he is skilled in the art of siear, an occult technique of shamanistic type.53 Other myths show the stratagems to which Otsinn has recourse, and the price he is willing to pay, in order to obtain wisdom. omniscience, and poetic inspiration. A giant, Mimir, was famous for his occult knowledge. The gods cut his head off and sent it to Otsinn. Otsinn preserved it by means of plants, and from then on he consulted the giant's head whenever he wanted
to learn certain secrets.54 According to Snorri (Gyljaginning 8), Mimir was the guardian of the spring of wisdom, situated at the foot of Yggdrasill. Otsinn did not obtain the right to drink from it until he had sacrificed an eye by hiding it in the spring (Voluspa, strophe 25). An important myth relates the origin of the "drink of poetry and wisdom": when peace was concluded between the Vanir

It is difficult to determine the "origin" of the shamanic elements in ancient German religion, especially in the mythology and cult of6~inn-Wodan. Some of them go back to the Indo-European heritage, but we must not exclude North Asian influences. In any case, the importance attributed to ecstatic techniques and to beliefs that are shamanic in structure bring Germanic religion close to Asiatic shamanism. 54.

and the Aesir, all the gods spat into a caldron; from this ceremonial spitting there emerged a being of extraordinary wisdom, named Kvasir. 55 Two dwarfs killed him, mixed his blood with honey, and thus made mead. He who drinks it becomes a poet or a sage. The drink is hidden in the other world, in a place difficult to get to, but Oc)inn manages to obtain it, and from then on it is accessible to all the gods. The skalds call poetic inspiration "Ygg's cup," "Ygg's mead," but also "mead of the dwarfs," "Kvasir's blood," etc.56 To conclude: after his initiation (which allowed him to obtain the runes), the sacrifice of his eye (which gave him the right to drink from the well of Mimir), and the theft of mead, Oc)inn became the undisputed master of wisdom and of all the occult sciences. He is at once the god of poets and sages, of ecstatics and warriors.
175. War, ecstasy, and death
Unlike Varul)a, Oc)inn-Wodan is a god of war; for, as Dumezil writes, "in the ideology and practice ofthe Germans, war invaded everything, colored everything" (Les dieux des Germains, p. 65). But in the traditional societies, and especially among the ancient Germans, war constitutes a ritual that is justified by a theology. First of all there is the assimilation of military combat to s.acrifice: both the victor and the victim bring the god a blood offering. In consequence, heroic death becomes a preferred religious experience. In addition, the ecstatic nature of the warrior's death brings him close to the inspired poet as well as to the shaman, the prophet, and the seer. It is by virtue ofthis glorification of war and ecstasy and death that Oc)inn-Wodan acquires his particular character. The name Wodan derives from the term wut, literally, "fury." The reference is to an experience typical of young warriors: by an excess of aggressive and terrifying fury, their humanity was transmuted-they became like raging carnivores. According to

Thus among the Chatti, Tacitus writes (Germania 31), the postulant cut neither his hair nor his beard before he had killed an enemy. Among the Taifali the young man had to kill a boar or a bear, and among the Heruli he had to fight without weapons.57 Through these ordeals the postulant acquired the mode of being of a wild beast; he became a redoubtable warrior to the extent that he behaved like a carnivore. Beliefs in lycanthropy, obtained by dressing ritually in a wolfskin, become extremely popular in the Middles Ages, and in the North they persist down to the nineteenth century. God of war, 6tsinn-Wodan is also god of the dead. By magical means he protects the great heroes, but he ends by betraying and killing his proteges. The explanation for this strange and contradictory behavior seems to be the need to gather around him the most redoubtable fighters in view of the eschatological battle of the Ragnarok. And in fact notable warriors, fallen in battle, were led by the Valkyries to the heavenly palace, Valhalla.58 Welcomed by 6tsinn, they spend their days fighting, preparing themselves for the final battle. Protector of the Miinnerbunde, which, like all societies of ecstatic and martial structure, terrorized the villages, 6tsinnWodan could not be the favorite god of the rural population. His

cult, which involved human sacrifices by hanging, was chiefly celebrated by the families of kings and military leaders and among their immediate followers. Yet a number of toponyms containing the word 6tsinn have been found, and in some of these his name is combined with the vocables for "field" and "meadow." This does not prove the "agrarian" structure of 6tsinn but rather his "imperialistic" character, his tendency to take over the functions and attributes of other divinities. The leading part played by 6tsinn-Wodan in the religious life of the Germans is explained by his many and various powers of magical sovereignty. 6tsinn is the chief author of the creation of the world, of gods, and of men. (Of the other divine personages active in the mythical time of the beginnings, the collective memory has retained only the names.) Similarly, he is called upon to play the chief part in the final battle of the Ragnarok. His quality of sovereign god and, at the same time, of god of war and death makes comprehensible both the sacred character of royalty and the religious valorization of death on the battlefield-conceptions characteristic of the culture of the Germanic High Middle Ages (see vol. 3).
176. The Aesir: Ty.., Thor, Baldr
The first of the Aesir, Tyr (*Tiwaz, Ziu), is far paler. Originally he was a supreme god,59 for one of the names ofthe gods, ttwar, is the plural of TYr. Since the interpretatio romana identified him with Mars, he is usually classed among the war gods, and in fact he presents a well-developed military aspect. But his original vocation of "jurist god" (homologue of Mitra) is still visible. He has organic relations with the thing-the a$sembly ofthe people before which legal cases were tried. It is true that the assemblies in peacetime resembled those in time of war, since the people gathered together in arms and approved decisions by brandishing
59. His name, *Tiwaz, is related to the other Indo-European names of the (god ofthe) sky: Dyaus, Zeus, Jupiter. Probably, at least among some Germanic tribes, the celestial god continued to be venerated under the name IrminHermin; see below, § 178.

sword or axe in the air or by striking their shields with their swords.60 The most important mythical episode, which characterizes Tyr's vocation, took place at the beginning of time. The gods knew that the wolf Fenrir, which a giantess had conceived by Loki, was to devour them. By convincing it that they were only playing a game, they managed to tie it to a magical thong, so fine that it was invisible. Suspicious, the young wolf had consented to play the game on condition that one of the gods would put a hand down its throat, as a pledge that no harm would be done it. Only Tyr dared to make the gesture, and, as soon as the wolf felt that it could not get loose, it bit off his hand (Gylfaginning 13. 21). Georges Dumezil rightly observes that such a gesture, necessary as it was to save the pantheon, constitutes a violation of an oath and hence indicates the degradation of the god who is at once sovereign and jurist.61 Thor (Donar) was one of the most popular gods. His name means "thunder," his weapon is the hammer Mjollnir ("the crusher"), mythical image of the thunderbolt, analogous to Indra's vajra (see § 68). His red beard and his fabulous appetite make him resemble the Vedic champion. Thor is the defender of the Aesir and of their divine dwelling place. Numerous stories show hi.m confronting the giants and annihilating them with his hammer.62 His chief adversary is the cosmic snake, Jornungan, who encircles the world and who will threaten the gods at the Ragnarok; several texts and some drawings show him pulling this dragon out of the sea.
60. As Jan de Vries observes, "from the Germanic point of view, there is no contradiction between the concepts of the 'god of battles' and the 'god of law' " (Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, vol. 2, p. 13).

Dumezil, Les dieux des Germains, p. 75: "What the divine society thus gained in effectiveness it lost in moral and mystical power; it is no longer anything but the exact projection of the earthly bands or states, whose only concern was gain and conquest.

The relations between Th6r and the personage brandishing an axe in the rock drawings of the Scandinavian Bronze Age are difficult to determine.



The Aesir: Tyr, ThOr, Baldr 165
Images of Thor, always with his hammer, were found in many temples. The witnesses mention these images more than they do those of the other gods. As master of storms, Thor was popular among farmers, though he was not an agrarian god. But he insured harvests and protected villages from demons. In his function of war god he was supplanted by 6esinn. The erotic tendency that is characteristic of Indra can perhaps be detected in the ritual role of the hammer on the occasion of marriages. The "folklorization" of certain mythological tales featuring Thor, Mjollnir, and the giants has been observed; for example, Thor disguises himself as a bride in order to deceive the giant who had stolen his hammer. The meaning of the underlying rituals having been forgotten, these mythological tales survived by virtue of their narrative qualities. Similar processes explain the "origin" of numerous literary themes. By his purity and nobility, by his tragic fate, Baldr is the most interesting of the gods. Son of 6esinn and the goddess Frigg, he is, Snorri writes, "the best of them, and everyone sings his praises. He is so fair of face and bright that a splendour radiates from him.... He is the wisest of the gods, and the sweetestspoken, and the most merciful" (Gy/faginning, chap. 22; trans. Jean I. Young). Little is known about his cult, but he is known to have been universally loved. Yet it is by his death that Baldr revealed his importance in the drama of the world. His myth is, in any case, the most touching in all Germanic mythology. According to Snorri's version, Baldr had ominous dreams, and the gods decided to make him invulnerable. His mother gathered the oaths of all the things in the world that they would not harm him. Then the Aesir assembled at the place of the thing, around Baldr, and amused themselves by striking him with swords and throwing all sorts of things at him. "When Loki saw that, it displeased him." Disguised as a woman, he went to see Frigg and asked her if all beings had sworn to spare Baldr. Frigg replied: "There is a young shoot of wood that is called Mistilteinn, 'shoot of mistletoe'; it seemed to me too young for me to ask for an oath from it." Loki pulled it up and went to the thing. Hoes (Hodhr), Baldr's brother, being blind, had remained at the rear, but Loki gave him the branch and said: "Do like the others, attack him, I will show you the direction where he is." Guided

by Loki, Ho() threw the shoot of mistletoe at his brother. "The stroke pierced Baldr, who fell dead to the ground. It was the greatest misfortune that has ever been among gods and among men." Nevertheless, because they were in a sacred place, no one could punish Loki (Gy/faginning: chaps. 33-35). "This drama, as is apparent from the structure of the Voiuspd, is the keystone of the history of the world. Through it, the mediocrity of the present age became irremediable. To be sure, Baldr's goodness and clemency had been ineffectual until then, since, by a kind of evil fate, 'none of his judgments held, became a reality'; at least he existed, and that existence was protest and consolation.' '63 Because he had not fallen on a battlefield, Baldr did not go to Valhalla but to the domain of Hel. To the messenger sent by 6()inn, demanding Baldr's release, Hel replied that she would release him on condition that "all things in the world" bewailed him. Informed by the gods, men and animals, stones and trees, all did so. Only one witch refused to weep for Baldr, and "it is suppposed that it was Loki." Finally Thor catches Loki, and the gods chain him to a stone. Above him they hang a venomous snake, which lets poison fall on his face. His wife, Snorri writes, i~ with him and holds a basin under the poisoned liquid. When the basin is full, she goes to empty it, but in the meanwhile he receives the venom on his face; he writhes, and then the earth trembles. However, Loki will succeed in freeing himself at the time of the Ragnarok, on the eve of the end of the world.
177. The Vanir gods. Loki. The end of the world
The Vanir are all more or less directly connected with fertility, peace, and wealth. Njor()r, the eldest of them, married his sister and had by her the twins Freyr and Freyja. Since the ancient Germans abhorred incest, this mythological tradition can be interpreted either as reflecting the customs of the aboriginal, preIndo-European populations64 or as emphasizing the orgiastic na

ture characteristic of divinities of fecundity, especially agrarian fecundity. Tacitus (Germania 40) speaks ofthe goddess Nerthus, "that is, the Earth Mother"; this is the same name as NjorlSr. The goddess traveled about among the tribes in a chariot drawn by a cow; her cult was celebrated in a sacred wood on an island in the "Ocean"-and, the Roman historian adds, "it is the only time when peace and tranquillity are known and enjoyed." The goddess's chariot and statue were then bathed, and the slaves who performed the rite were drowned in the same lake. Tacitus' account was probably influenced by what he knew about the ritual ofCybele at Rome; however, a study preserved in the saga of King Olaf confirms the existence of this type of cult.65 In the last phase of Scandinavian paganism NjorlSr was supplanted by Freyr. The latter's image in the temple at Uppsala was phallic; his cult involved many orgiastic acts and human sacrifice. But his mythology is not interesting. As for Freyja, like Frigg (*Frija)66-which" may be no more than a surnameshe was above all the goddess oflove and procreation. According to Snorri, she was the only divinity whom the people still venerated when he composed his work, and the great number of toponyms containing the name of Freyja confirms this opinion. Snorri adds that Freyja was originally a priestess of the Vanir who first taught the Aesir the divinitory technique of the seior. She had the power to communicate with the other world, and she could assume the form of a bird. Loki is an enigmatic and ambiguous god. The etymology of his name is uncertain; he had no cult, and no temples were consecrated to him. Although himself one of the Aesir, he tries to harm the gods, and at the end of the world he will fight against them; it is he who will kill Heimdallr. His behavior is disconcerting: on the one hand he is a companion of the gods,67 and he likes to fight their enemies, the giants; he makes the dwarfs forge certain magical objects that are true attributes of the gods (the ring Draupnir for OlSinn, the hammer for Thor, etc.).

other hand, he is malicious, amoral, criminal: he is the author of Baldr's murder and boasts of it. His demonic nature is confirmed by his offspring: the wolf Fenrir and the Great Snake are his sons; Hel is his daughter-she to whose gloomy land the dead go who have not earned the right to reside in Valhalla. There is a multitude of myths about Loki, but they often resemble popular and farcical tales. He boasts of his conquests: he has given Tyr's wife a son, he has taken Thor's place beside his wife, etc. He plays a role in almost all the farcical episodes and tales that bring the gods and giants on the stage. A famous and terrible poem, Lokasenna, tells how Loki, entering the chamber in which the gods were feasting, insulted them in the most insolent way. It is only Thor's appearing that silences his vituperations. For more than a century scholars have successively explained Loki as a god of fire, as a god of thunder or of death, as a reflection of the Christian devil, or as a civilizing hero comparable to Prometheus.68 In 1933, Jan de Vries compared him to the "trickster," an ambivalent personage who occurs only in North American mythologies. Georges Dumezil proposed a more plausible interpretation, because it accounts at the same time for Loki, Hots, Baldr, and the end of the world. Loki's role as an impostor, his malevolence, and his pres~nce among the enemies of the gods during the eschatological battle make him homologous with the sinister personage in the Mahiibhiirata, Duryodhana, the supreme incarnation of the demon of our age (see § 191). According to Dumezil, the extent and regularity of the harmony between the Mahiibhiirata and the Edda show the existence of a vast eschatological myth recounting the relations between Good and Evil and the destruction of the world, a myth already in existence before the dispersal of the Indo-European peoples.69 As we observed (§173), in the last period of paganism the Germans were extremely concerned with eschatology. The end of the world was made an integral part of their cosmogony, and,

as in India, Iran, and Israel, the scenario and the principal actors in the apocalypse were known. The most complete and dramatic description is supplied by the poem Voluspa and by Snorri's paraphrase. The well-known cliches of all apocalyptic literature make their appearance: morality declines and disappears, men kill one another, the earth trembles, the sun grows dark, the stars fall; freed from their chains, the monsters descend on the earth; the Great Snake emerges from the Ocean, bringing on catastrophic inundations. But more specific details are also found: a winter three years long (fimbulvetr) will occur; a horde of giants will arrive in a boat built from the fingernails of the dead; other giants, commanded by Surtr, will advance by land and climb up the rainbow to attack and destroy AsgarG, the home of the gods. Finally, the army of the gods and heroes meets the army of the monsters and giants on a vast plain for the decisive battle. Each of the gods assails an adversary. Thor confronts the Cosmic Snake and kills him but immediately falls, poisoned by its venom. OGinn is devoured by Fenrir; his young son Vidar kills the Wolf but dies soon afterward. Heimdallr attacks Loki, and they destroy each other. In fact, all the gods and all their opponents fall in this eschatological battle, with the exception of Surtr; surviving, he lights the cosmic conflagration-and all trace of life disappears; finally, the whole earth is swallowed by the Ocean, and the sky crumbles. Yet it is not the end. A new earth emerges, green, beautiful, fertile as never before, purified of all suffering. The sons of the dead gods will return to AsgarG; Baldr and HoG will emerge from Hel, reconciled. A new sun, more brilliant than the former one, will take its course through the sky. And the human pair sheltered by Yggdrasill will become the founders of a new humanity.70 Some authors have believed that they could identify various Oriental influences (Iranian, Christian, Manichaean, etc.) in the myth of the Ragnarok. But, as Dumezil has shown, what we have here is the Scandinavian version of the Indo-European eschatological myth; the possible later influences have only added a more highly colored imagery and touching details.
70. This last detail contradicts the eschatological scenario that we have just summarized, in which the collapse of Yggdrasill completes the end of the world.

Judged by the fragments of it that have been preserved, the religion of the Germans was one of the most complex and original in Europe. What first strikes us is its ability to enrich and renew the Indo-European heritage by assimilating a number of allogeneous religious techniques, of Mediterranean, Oriental, or North Asian origin. A similar process has been observed in the Hindu synthesis (§ 135) and in the formation of Roman religion (§ 161). But among the Germans religious creativity was not paralyzed by the conversion to Christianity. One of the most beautiful epic poems, Beowulf, composed in England in the eighth century, presents the heroic mythology more completely and more profoundly than similar continental compositions, thanks precisely to the influence of Christian ideas. 71 One of the most impressive descriptions of the Ragnarok is carved on a stone cross at Gosforth (Cumberland); the other side of the monument represents the Crucifixion.72 In fact, certain Germanic religious creations flowered during the High Middle Ages as the result of symbiosis with, or opposition to, Christianity. The religious prestige of medieval royalty derives in the last analysis from the old Germanic conception that the king is the representative of the divine Ancestor: the sovereign's "power" depends on a supraterrestrial sacred force that is at once the foundation and the warrant for universal order.73 As for the heroic mythology, it is continued, in enriched and revalorized form, in the institution of chivalry and in the legends of Saint George, Sir Galahad, and Parsifal (see vol. 3).

seminomadic peoples arriving from the Ukraine. The ethnogenesis of the Thracians took place in a region of considerable extent, between the Dniester, the Northern Carpathians, and the Balkans. Toward the end ofthe eighth century B.C. the incursions ofthe Cimmerians introduced certain Caucasian elements into art and armament. Writing in the fifth century, Herodotus stated that the Thracians were the most numerous people after the Indians. But their role in political history was slight. The kingdom of the Odryses (in the valley of the Maritsa), strong enough to attack Macedonia in ca. 429, lost its autonomy less than a century later to Philip II. Alexander the Great continued his father's expansionist policy: about 335 he crossed the Danube to conquer and subdue the Geto-Dacians. The failure of his campaign allowed these Thracian tribes to remain independent and to improve their national organization. While the southern Thracians were definitively integrated into the orbit of Hellenism, Dacia did not become a Roman province until the year 107 of our era. An equally unfortunate destiny seems to have pursued the religious creations of the Thracians and the Geto-Dacians. The Greeks had early recognized the originality and force of Thracian religiosity. Various traditions localized in Thrace (or in Phrygia) the origin of the Dionysiac movement (§ 122) and a large part of the mythology of Orpheus (§ 180). And in the Charmides (156e), Socrates speaks admiringly of the physicians of the "Thracian king Zalmoxis," whose doctrine and practice were superior to those of the Greek physicians. But except for some valuable details communicated by Herodotus in connection with the mythico-ritual scenario of Zalmoxis, sources for information concerning Thracian and Thraco-Getanreligion are few and vague. It is true that, especially in the period of the Roman Empire, religious monuments abound; however, in the absence of written testimony their interpretation is uncertain and provisional. Just as among the Celts, the Thracian and Geto-Dacian priests and monks were suspicious of writing. The little that we know about their mythology, theology, and rites has been transmitted to us by Greek and Latin authors, through their interpretatio graeca and latina. If Herodotus had not recorded certain conversations with Hellespontine Greeks, we should have known nothing of the mythico-ritual scenario of Zalmoxis or even the name of



172 CELTS, GERMANS, THRACIANS, GETAE
Gebeleizis. To be sure, as among the Slavs and the Baits, to say nothing of the ancient Germans and the descendants of the Celts, the religious heritage of the Thracians was preserved, with inevitable changes, in the popular customs and folklore of the Balkan peoples and the Romanians. But analysis of European folklore traditions from the point of view of the general history of religions is still in its beginnings. According to Herodotus (5. 7), the Thracians worshipped "Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis"; however, their kings venerated "Hermes," from whom they believed themselves descended. On the basis of this brief account, made still more enigmatic by the interpretatio graeca, the attempt has been made to reconstruct the original pantheon of the Thracians. From Homer (Iliad 13. 301, etc.) to Vergil (Aen. 3. 357), tradition put the native country of Ares, the god of war, in Thrace. Then, too, the Thracians were renowned for their military virtues and their indifference in the face of death; hence it could be accepted that a god of the "Ares" type was the head of their pantheon. However, as we saw (§ 176), the ancient celestial god of the Germans, Tiwaz, was assimilated by the Romans to Mars. So it is possible that the Thracian "Ares" was originally a celestial god who had become a god of storms and of war.74 In this case, "Artemis" was a chthonian divinity, analogous to the Thracian goddesses Bendis and Cotyto (Cotys); Herodotus had chosen to call her"Artemis" (instead of, for example, "Demeter") because of the wildness of the Thracian forests and mountains.
If this "reading" is accepted, we mayalso suppose the existence, among the earliest Thracians, of the exemplary myth of the hierogamy between the storm god and the Earth Mother; "Dionysus" would be the fruit of that union. The Greeks knew the Thracian names of Dionysus; those most commonly used
were Sabos and Sabazius.75 The cult of the Thracian "Dionysus"
74. Moreover, we know of the god Zbelsurdos, the second part of whose name, -surdos, appears to derive from the root *suer, "to low, to hum"; hence he was a storm god, whom the Greeks incorrectly named Zeus Keraunos. See Eliade, Zalmoxis, the Vanishing God, p. 51 and n. 87.
75. See the sources cited by E. Rohde, Psyche, p. 304, n. l. Another divine name was Bassareus, meaning "clad in a long foxskin." On the rites of Sabazius at Athens, see volume 1 of the present work, pp. 367-68.



The Thracians, "great anonyms" of history 173
is reminiscent of the rites presented by Euripides in the Bacchae (see § 124). The ceremonies took place at night, in the mountains, by torchlight; a wild music (the sounds of bronze caldrons, cymbals, and flutes) inspired believers to joyous outcries and to dances in furious circles. "It was especially women who indulged in these disorderly and exhausting dances; their costume was strange; they wore 'bessares,' long, floating garments made, it seems, from foxskins; above those, deerskins, and probably horns on their heads."76 In their hands they held snakes consecrated to Sabazius, daggers, or thyrsi. Attaining paroxysm, "sacred madness," they seized animals chosen to be sacrificed and tore them to pieces, eating the raw flesh. This ritual omophagy produced identification with the god; the participants now called themselves Sabos or Sabazius.77 Undoubtedly there is here, as among Greek bacchantes, a temporary "divinization." But the ecstatic experience could inspire specific religious vocations, first of all oracular gifts. Unlike Greek Dionysianism, prophecy in Thrace was connected with the cult of "Dionysus." A certain tribe, that of the Bessi, managed the oracle of "Dionysus"; the temple was on a high mountain,18 and the prophetess predicted the future in "ecstasy," like the Pythia at Delphi. Ecstatic experiences strengthened the conviction that the soul is not only autonomous but that it is capable of an unio mystica with the divinity. The separation of soul from body, determined by ecstasy, revealed on the one hand the fundamental duality of man and, on the other, the possibility of a purely spiritual postexistence, the consequence of "divinization." The vague and uncertain archaic beliefs in some form of survival of the soul were progressively modified, ending, in the last analysis, in the idea of metempsychosis or in various conceptions of spiritual immortality. It is probable that the ecstatic experiences that

174 CELTS,GERMANS,THRACIANS, GETAE
opened the way for such conceptions were not always of the "Dionysiac" (Le., orgiastic) type. Ecstasy could also be brought on by certain herbs or by asceticism (solitude, vegetarian diet, fasting, etc.) and by prayer.79 It is in such circles that the religious practices and concepts known by the name of Orphism (see §§ 180 ff.) developed in Greece. Among certain Thracian tribes, the belief in immortality and the certainty of bliss for the disincarnate soul end in an almost morbid exaltation of death and a depreciation of existence. The Trnusi wailed at the birth of a child, but they buried their dead joyfully (Herodotus, 5.4). A number ofancient authors explained the exceptional courage of the Thracians in battle by their eschatological convictions. Martianus Capella (6. 656) even credited them with an actual "appetite for death" (appetitus maximus mortis), for "they thought it beautiful to die." This religious valorization of death is recognizable in certain creations of the folklore of Romania and of other peoples of southeastern Europe. so As for the "Hermes" who, according to Herodotus, was worshiped exclusively by the "kings," that is, by the military aristocracy, it is hard to identify him. Herodotus makes no reference to the solar god, though such a god is well documented in other sources.81 So we could see a solar divinity in the Thracian "Hermes." Some centuries later the so-called "Hero on Horseback" monuments become frequent in the Balkans; now the

Strabo (7.3.3), following Posidonius, reports that the Mysians abstain from all flesh food, contenting themselves with honey, milk, and cheese, and that for this reason they are called both "those who fear God" (theosebeis) and "those who walk in smoke" (kapnobatal). These terms probably designate certain religious personages, not the whole people. The kapnobatai would be dancers and "shamans" who used the smoke of hemp to bring on ecstatic trances (see Zalmoxis, pp. 42, 61). Strabo adds that, among the Thracians, there are pious solitaries, known by the name of ktistai, who live apart from women, consecrate themselves to the gods, and live "freed from all fear" (8. 3. 3). 80. See Zalmoxis, chaps. 5 and 8. 81. See Pettazzoni, "The Religion of Ancient Thrace," pp. 84 ff.



Zalmoxis and "immortalization" 175
Hero on Horseback is identified with Apollo.82 However, this is a late conception, which throws no light on the "royal" theology mentioned by Herodotus.
179. Zalmoxis and "immortalization"
The same historian declares that the Getae are "the bravest and most law-abiding of the Thracians" (4. 93). They "claim to be immortal," Herodotus goes on, and in this sense: "They believe that they do not die but that he who perishes goes to the god [daimon] Zalmoxis or Gebeleizis, as some of them call him" (4. 94). This is the first-and the last-time that the name Gebeleizis appears in the literature. Tomaschek had already recognized in this divine name a parallel to the Thracian god Zbelsurdos, Zbel
tiurdos.83 Like Zbelsurdos, Gebeleizis would be a storm god or, rather, an ancient celestial god, if we follow Walde-Pokorny and Decev, who derive his name from the Indo-European root *guer, "to shine."84 After narrating the sacrifice of a messenger to Zalmoxis, a ritual that we shall consider further on, Herodotus adds: "When there is thunder and lightning, these same Thracians shoot arrows skyward as a threat to the god, believing in no other god but their own" (4. 94). Despite Herodotus' testimony (expressed, it is true, with astonishing carelessness, both grammatically and stylistically), it is difficult to regard Zalmoxis and Gebeleizis as one and the same god. Their structures are different, their cults are not at all alike. As we shall see further on, Zalmoxis has none of the characteristics of a storm god. As for the shooting of arrows, we may wonder if Herodotus had rightly grasped the meaning of the ritual. In all probability, it was not the god (Gebeleizis) who was

threatened but the demonic powers manifested in the clouds. In other words, it was a positive cult act: it imitated, and indirectly helped, the god of lightning by shooting arrows at the demons of darkness.85 However this may be, we must resign ourselves: we cannot reconstruct the function and "history" of Gebeleizis onlhe basis of a single document. The fact that Gebeleizis is not mentioned again after Herodotus does not necessarily imply his disappearance from the cult. We can imagine either his coalescence with another divinity or his survival under a different name.86 The most valuable information furnished by Herodotus has to do with the myth and the cult of Zalmoxis. According to what he had learned from the Greeks of the Hellespont and the Black Sea region, Zalmoxis was a former slave of Pythagoras: "freed and gaining great wealth, he returned to his own country. Now the Thracians were a meanly-living and simple-witted folk"; so Zalmoxis undertook to civilize them. He "made himself a hall, where he entertained and feasted the chief among his countrymen and taught them that neither he nor his guests nor any of their descendants should ever die, but that they should go to a place where they would live forever and have all good things." Meanwhile, "he was making himself an underground chamber," into which he "descended [and] lived for three years, the Thracians wishing him back and mourning him for dead; then in the fourth year he appeared to the Thracians, and thus they came to believe what Zalmoxis had told them.... For myself," Herodotus adds, "I neither disbelieve nor fully believe the tale about Zalmoxis and his chamber; but I think that he lived many years before Pythagoras; and whether there was a man called Zalmoxis, or this be a name among the Getae for a god of their country, I have done with him" (4. 95-96).
85. See Zalmoxis. pp. 51 ff. 86. The fact that the Romanian folk mythology ofthe Prophet Elijah contains a number of elements belonging to a storm god proves at least that Gebeleizis was still active at the time of the Christianization of Dacia, whatever his name at that period may have been. We may also admit that a religious syncretism encouraged by the high priest and the priestly class finally ended by confusing Gebeleizis with Zalmoxis (see below, p. 179).



Zalmoxis and "immortalization" 177
As was natural, this text made a great impression in the ancient world, from Herodotus' contemporaries to the Neo-Pythagoreans and Neo-Platonists. The story he tells is consistent: the Hellespontine Greeks, or Herodotus himself, had integrated what they had learned about Zalmoxis, his doctrine, and his cult into a spiritual horizon that is Pythagorean in structure. Now this is as much as to say that the cult of the Geto-Dacian god comprised belief in the immortality of the soul and certain rites that were initiatory in type. Through the rationalism and euhemerism of Herodotus, or of his informants, we divine that the cult had the character of a .,mystery.' '87 The Getae, Herodotus writes, "pretend to be immortal" (4. 93), for "they believe that they do not die, but that he who perishes goes to ... Zalmoxis" (4. 94). However, the verb athanatizein (5. 4) does not mean "pretend to be immortal" but "make oneself immortal."88 This "immortalization" was obtained by means of an initiation, which brings the cult inaugurated by Zalmoxis close to the Greek and Hellenistic Mysteries (see § 205). We know nothing ofthe ceremonies properly speaking, but the information transmitted by Herodotus indicates a mythico-ritual scenario of "death" (occultation) and "return to earth" (epiphany). The Greek historian also tells (4. 94) of the ritual peculiar to Zalmoxis: the sending, every four years, of a messenger "charged to tell [the god] of their needs." A number of men held three javelins, and the man chosen by lot was tossed into the air; when he fell, he was run through by the javelin points. The sacrifice made possible the communication of a message, in other words, reactualized the direct relations between the Getae and their god as they existed in the beginning, when Zalmoxis was among them. The sacrifice and sending of the messenger were in some sense a symbolic (since ritual) repetition of the founding of the
87. This may be the reason why Herodotus hesitates to give details (ifwhich is not certain-his informants had supplied him with them), for his discretion in regard to the Mysteries is well known. But Herodotus admits that he does not believe in the story that Zalmoxis was a slave of Pythagoras; on the contrary, he is convinced that the Getan daimon is far earlier-and this detail is important. 88. See I. M. Linforth, "Hoi athanatizontes, Herodotus, IV. 93-94," Classical Philology 93 (1918): 23-33.

cult; there was a reactualization of Zalmoxis' epiphany after his three years of occultation, with all that his epiphany implied, especially an assurance of the immortality and bliss of the soul. Certain ancient authors, as well as a number of modern scholars, have connected Zalmoxis with Dionysus and Orpheus, on the one hand, and, on the other, with mythical or strongly mythologized personages89 whose characteristic feature was either a shamanic technique or the gift of prophecy or descents to Hell (katabaseis). But what Herodotus tells us about Zalmoxis does not fit into the system of shamanic or shamanizing mythologies, beliefs, and techniques. On the contrary, as we have just seen, the most characteristic elements of his cult-andreia (ceremonial banquets), occultation in the "underground chamber" followed by epiphany after four years, "immortalization" ofthe soul, and teachings concerning a happy existence in another world-make it comparable to the Mysteries.90 At the beginning of the Christian era Strabo (Geography 7. 3. 5) provides a new version of the myth of Zalmoxis, chiefly drawing on the documentation collected by Posidonius (ca. 135ca. 50 B.C.). According to this, Zalmoxis was Pythagoras' slave; however, it was not the doctrine of immortality that he learned from his master but "certain things about the heavenly bodies," that is, the art of predicting future events in accordance with celestial signs. To this Strabo adds ajourney to Egypt, supremely the land of magic. It is by virtue of his astronomical knowledge and his magical and prophetic powers that Zalmoxis persuaded the king to associate him with the government. High priest and prophet of "the most honored god in their country," Zalmoxis retired to a cave at the summit of the sacred mountain Kogaionon, where he received no one but the king and his own servants, and later he "was called a god." Strabo adds that "when Boerebista ruled over the Getae, this office was held by Decaeneus," and that "in one way or another the Pythagorean

Zalmoxis and "immortalization" 179
command to abstain from eating living beings still existed as it had been taught by Zalmoxis."91 In the new stage of Geto-Dacian religion concerning which we are informed by Posidonius and Strabo, the character of Zalmoxis proves to be decidedly modified. First of all, there is the identification of the god Zalmoxis with his high priest, who ends by being deified under the same name. What is more, there is no reference to a cult with a structure resembling that of the Mysteries, such as Herodotus presented. In short, the cult of Zalmoxis is dominated by a high priest who lives alone at the top of a mountain, though being at the same time the king's associate and chief councilor; and this cult is "Pythagorean" because it excludes flesh food. We do not know to what extent the initiatory and eschatological structure of the "Mystery" of Zalmoxis survived in Strabo's time. But the ancient authors speak of certain hermits and holy men, and it is possible that these "specialists in the sacred" carried on the "Mystery" tra
dition of the cult of Zalmoxis.92
91. In another passage (7. 3. 11), in which he gives an account of the career of Boerebista (70-44), Strabo describes Decaeneus as "a magician (goes), a man who not only had traveled in Egypt but also had thoroughly learned certain signs through which he claimed to know the divine will; and in a short time he had come to be considered a god." 92. See Zalmoxis, pp. 61 ff. Another detail seems equally important for Strabo: that Zalmoxis--like Decaeneus more recently-had managed to have so prodigious a career above all because of his astronomical and mantic knowledge. In the sixth century of our era, but relying on earlier sources, 10rdanes described in extravagant terms the Dacian priests' interest in astronomy and the natural sciences (Getica 11. 69-71). The insistence on knowledge of the heavenly bodies may reflect correct information. Indeed, the temples of Sarmizegetuza and Coste§ti, whose urano-solar symbolism is obvious, seem to
have a calendrical function. See Hadrian Daicoviciu, "n Tempio-Calendario dacico di Sarmizegetuza" and also his Dacii, pp. 194 ff., 210 ff.



22 Orpheus, Pythagoras,
and the New Eschatology
180. Myths of Orpheus, lyre-player and "founder of initiations"
It seems impossible to write about Orpheus and Orphism without irritating one or the other of two groups of scholars: on the one hand, the skeptics and "rationalists," who minimize the importance of Orphism in the history of Greek spirituality; on the other, the admirers and "enthusiasts," who regard it as a movement of considerable significance.\ Analysis of the sources enables us to distinguish two groups of religious realities: (1) the myths and fabulous traditions concerning Orpheus and (2) the ideas, beliefs, and customs regarded as "Orphic." The lyre-player is first mentioned in the sixth century by the poet Ibycus of Rhegium, who speaks of "Orpheus of famous name." For Pindar, he is "the player on the phorminx, father of melodious songs" (Pyth. 4. 177). Aeschylus describes him as he who "haled all things by the rapture of his voice" (Agamemnon 1630). In a vase painting he is depicted on board a boat, lyre in hand, and he is expressly named on a sixth-century metope of the Treasury of the Sicyonians at Delphi. Beginning
1. Even the evaluation ofthe sources differs radically from one group to the other. The skeptics emphasize the fewness of the documents and their late date. The others hold that the date of composition of a document must not be confused with the age of its contents and that, in consequence, by using all the valid testimonies in the proper critical spirit, we can grasp the essential message of Orphism. The tension between these two methodologies corresponds to a deeper philosophical opposition, documented in Greece from the sixth century and still perceptible in our day. "Orpheus" and "Orphism" are prime examples of subjects that trigger polemical passions almost automatically.



Myths of Orpheus 181
in the fifth century the iconography of Orpheus becomes continually richer: vase paintings show him playing the lyre and surrounded by birds or wild animals or else by Thracian disciples. He is tom to pieces by maenads, or he is in Hades with other divinities. From the the fifth century, too, are the first references to his descent to the underworld to bring back his wife, Eurydice (Euripides, Alcestis 357 fT.). He fails in this because he looks back too soon2 or because the infernal powers oppose his undertaking.3 Legend makes him live in Thrace "a generation before Homer," but on fifth-century ceramics he is always represented in Greek costume, charming wild beasts or barbarians by his music.4 It is in Thrace that he dies. According to Aeschylus' lost play the Bassarides, Orpheus every morning ascended Mount Pangaeus to worship the sun, identified with Apollo; angered, Dionysus sent the maenads against him; the lyre-player was tom to pieces, and the parts of his body were scattered.5 His head, thrown into the Hebron, floated to Lesbos, singing. Piously recovered, it served as an oracle. We shall have occasion to mention other references to Orpheus in the literature of the sixth and fifth centuries. For the moment we will observe that Orpheus' powers and the most important episodes in his biography are strangely reminiscent of shamanic practices. Like the shamans, he is both healer and musician; he charms and masters wild animals; he goes down to the underworld to bring back the dead; his head is preserved and serves as an oracle, just as the skulls of Yukagir shamans did even as late as the nineteenth century.6 All these elements are archaic and contrast with the Greek spirituality of the sixth and fifth centuries; but we know nothing of their protohistory in ancient Greece, that is, their possible mythico-religious function before

they were incorporated into the Orphic legend. In addition, Orpheus had connections with a series of fabulous personagessuch as Abaris, Aristeas, etc.-who were also characterized by shamanic or parashamanic ecstatic experiences. All this would be enough to put the legendary singer "before Homer," as was reported by tradition and repeated by Orphic propaganda. It does not matter much if this archaizing mythology was perhaps the product of a claim inspired by certain deeply felt experiences. (It is possible to discern, behind the mythology, the desire to put Orpheus back into the prestigious time of "origins" and therefore to proclaim him "Homer's ancestor"older, that is, and more venerable than the representative, the very symbol, of the official religion.) What is important is the fact that there was a deliberate choice of the most archaic elements accessible to the Greeks of the sixth century.7 Thus the emphasis placed on his living in Thrace, on his preaching and his tragic death there,8 corroborated the "primordial" structure of his personage. It is equally significant that, among the few descents to the underworld that are documented in Greek tradition, the one accomplished by Orpheus became the most popular.9 Katabasis is bound up with initiation rites. Now our singer was famous as "founder of initiations" and Mysteries. According to Euripides, he showed "the torch-march of those veiled mysteries" (Rhesus 943). The author of Against Aristogeiton (25. 11 = Kern. Orph. Frag., no. 23) stated that Orpheus "has shown us the most sacred initiations," referring, in all probability, to the Eleusinian Mysteries. Finally, his relations with Dionysus and Apollo confirm his fame as "founder of Mysteries," for these are the only Greek gods whose cult involved initiations and "ecstasy" (ecstasy, of course, of different and even irreconcilable types). From antiq

Myths of Orpheus 183
uity on, these relations have inspired controversy. When Dionysus brings his mother Semele up from Hades, Diodorus (4.25. 4) observes the analogy with Orpheus' descent in quest of Eurydice. Orpheus' being tom to pieces by the maenads can also be interpreted as a Dionysiac ritual, the sparagmos of the god in the form of an animal (see § 124). But Orpheus was known primarily as the disciple of Apollo. According to one legend, he was even the son of the god and the nymph Calliope. He owes his violent death to his devotion to Apollo. Orpheus' musical instrument was the Apollonian lyre. 1O Finally, as "founder of initiations," Orpheus attributed great importance to purifications, and katharsis was a specifically Apollonian technique. II A number of characteristic features must be borne in mind. (1) Although his name and certain references to his myth are documented only from the sixth century on, Orpheus is a religious personage of the archaic type. It is easy to imagine him as having lived "before Homer," whether this expression is understood chronologically or geographically (that is, in a "barbarous" region not yet touched by the spiritual values distinctive of Homeric civilization). (2) His "origin" and prehistory escape us, but Orpheus certainly belongs neither to the Homeric tradition nor to the Mediterranean heritage. His relations with the Thracians are enigmatic, for, on the one hand, among the barbarians he behaves like a Greek, and, on the other hand, he enjoys pre-Hellenic magico-religious powers (mastery over animals, shamanic katabasis). Morphologically, he is close to Zalmoxis (§179), who was also a founder of Mysteries (by means of katabasis) and a civilizing hero of the Getae, those Thracians who "claimed to be immortal." (3) Orpheus is presented as the outstanding founder of initiations. If he is proclaimed "ancestor of Homer," it is the better to emphasize the importance of his religious message, which is in radical contrast to the Olympian
10. Guthrie cites line 578 of Euripides' Alcestis, where Apollo is surrounded by lynxes and lions and a doe, "dancing to the sound of the lyre" (The Greeks and Their Gods, p. 315).
11. Apollo silences the oracles produced by Orpheus at Lesbos (Philostratus, Vita Apoll. 4. 14). Is this ajealous gesture on the god's part, or does it signify incompatibility between two oracular techniques, the shamanic and the Pythian?



184 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
religion. We do not know the fundamentals of the initiation that was supposed to have been "founded" by Orpheus. We know only its preliminaries: vegetarianism, asceticism, purification, religious instruction (hieroi logoi, sacred books). We also know its theological presuppositions: the transmigration, and therefore the immortality, of the soul. As we have seen (§ 97), the postmortem destiny of the soul constituted the goal of the Eleusinian initiations, but the cults of Dionysus and Apollo also involved the destiny of the soul. So it seems plausible that the sixth and fifth centuries saw in the mythical figure of Orpheus a founder of Mysteries who, though inspired by traditional initiations, proposed a more appropriate initiatory discipline, since it took into account the transmigration and immortality of the soul. From the beginning, the figure of Orpheus arises under the joint signs of Apollo and Dionysus. "Orphism" will develop in the same direction. This is not the only example. Melampus, the seer of Pylos, though the "favorite of Apollo," was at the same time he "who introduced the name of Dionysus into Greece, together with the sacrifice in his honor and the phallic procession" (Herodotus, 2. 49). Furthermore, as we have seen (§ 90), Apollo had a certain relation with Hades. On the other hand, he had ended by making peace with Dionysus, who had finally been admitted among the Olympians. This coming-together of the two antagonistic gods is not without significance. Is it possible that the Greek spirit thereby attempted to express its hope of finding, by the expedient ofthis coexistence ofthe two gods, a solution to the religious crisis brought on by the ruin of the Homeric religious values?
181. Orphic theogony and anthropogony: Transmigration and immortality of the soul
In the sixth century B.C. religious and philosophical thought was dominated by the problem ofthe One and the Many. The religious minds of the age asked: "What is the relation of each individual man to the divine, to which we feel we are akin, and how can we



Orphic theogony and anthropogony 185
best realize ... the potential unity which underlies the twO?"12 A certain union of the divine and the human took place during the Dionysiac orgia, but it was temporary and was obtained by a lowering of consciousness. The "Orphics," while accepting the Bacchic lesson-that is, man's participation in the divinedrew the logical conclusion from it: the immortality, and therefore the divinity, of the soul. So doing, they replaced orgia by katharsis, the technique of purification taught by Apollo. The lyre-player became the symbol and the patron of a whole movement, at once "initiatory" and "popular," known by the name of Orphism. What suffices to distinguish this religious movement is, first of all, the importance given to written texts, to "books." Plato refers to many books attributed to Orpheus and Musaeus (who was supposed to be his son or his disciple) and dealing with purifications and life after death. He also cites some hexameters of theogonic content as being "by Orpheus." Euripides likewise speaks of Orphic "writings," and Aristotle, who did not believe in the historicity of Orpheus, was familiar with the theories of the soul contained in "the so-called Orphic verses."13 It seems plausible that Plato knew some ofthese texts (they could be bought at the booksellers'). A second characteristic is the considerable variety of so-called "Orphics." Side by side with authors of theogonies and with ascetics and visionaries there were what later on, in the classic period, Theophrastus called "Orpheotelestes" ("Orphic initiators"), not to mention the vulgar purifying thaumaturges and
diviners whom Plato describes in a famous passage. 14 The phe

nomenon is common enough in the history of religions: every ascetic, gnostic, and soteriological movement gives rise to countless pseudo-morphoses and initiations that are sometimes puerile. We need only remember the false ascetics who have swarmed in India from the time of the Upanishads and the grotesque imitators ofthe yogins and Tantrics. Parodies abound, especially when there is emphasis on the revealed and initiatory character ofa soteriological gnosis. Let us think, for example, of the countless "initiations" and "secret societies" that sprang up in western Europe after the appearance of Freemasonry or in connection with the Rosicrucian "mystery." So it would be simpleminded to be so impressed by the Orpheotelestes and the thaumaturges that we are led to doubt the reality ofthe Orphic ideas and rituals. On the one hand, similar ecstatics, diviners, and healers are documented from the most ancient times; they are one of the characteristic features of "popular religions." On the other hand, the fact that, from the sixth century on, a number of these thaumaturges, diviners, and purifiers invoked the name of Orpheus proves that there were in existence certain soteriological techniques and gnoses that appeared to be superior, more effective, and more highly reputed and that attempts were made to imitate them or at least to benefit by the prestige connected with the fabulous personage's name. Some references in Plato enable us to glimpse the context of the Orphic conception of immortality. As punishment for a primordial crime, the soul is shut up in the body (soma) as in a tomb (sema).15 Hence, incarnate existence is more like a death, and the death of the body is therefore the beginning of true life. However, this "true life" is not obtained automatically; the soul is judged according to its faults or its merits, and after a certain time it is incarnated again. As in India after the Upanishads, there is here a belief in the indestructibility of the soul, con
of books of Musaeus and Orpheus, the offspring of the Moon and the Muses, as they affirm, and these books they use in their ritual, and make not only ordinary men but states believe that there really are remissions of sins and purifications . . . and that there are also special rites for the defunct . . . that deliver us from evil in the other world" (Rep. 364b-365a). 15.

demned to transmigrate until its final deliverance. Even in his day, for Empedocles, who lived the "Orphic life," the soul was a prisoner in the body, exiled far from the Blessed, clothed in "a fresh garment of flesh" (frags. 115 and 126). For Empedocles, too, immortality implied metempsychosis; it was, moreover, the justification for his vegetarianism (the butchered animal may have in it the soul of one of our close relatives). But vegetarian practices had a more complex and deeper religious justification. By refusing flesh food, the Orphics (and the Pythagoreans) abstained from blood sacrifices, which were obligatory in the official cult. Such a refusal, to be sure, expressed the decision to detach oneself from the city and, in the last analysis, to "renounce the world"; but above all it proclaimed rejection, in toto, of the Greek religious system, a system established by the first sacrifice, originated by Prometheus (§ 86). By reserving the eating of the flesh for human beings, and intending the offering of bones for the gods, Prometheus aroused the anger of Zeus; he also set in motion the process that put an end to the "paradisal" period, when men lived in communion with the gods. 16 The return to vegetarian practices indicated at one and the same time the decision to expiate the ancestral fault and the hope of recovering, at least in part, the original state of bliss. What was called the "Orphic life" (Plato, Laws, bk. VI, 782c) involved purification, asceticism, and a number of particular rules; but salvation was obtained primarily by an "initiation," that is, by cosmological and theosophical revelation~. By collating the few testimonies and references of the. ancient authors (Aeschylus, Empedocles, Pindar, Plato, Aristophanes, etc.), as well as those furnished by documents, we are able to reconstruct at least the outlines of what, for want of a better term, may be called the "Orphic doctrine." We discern a theogony carried on in a cosmogony, and we find also a rather strange anthropology. It is essentially the anthropogonic myth that is the foundation

188 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
of the Orphic eschatology, which contrasts with both that of Homer and that of Eleusis. The theogony of the so-called "Rhapsodies" 17 retains only a few details of the genealogy transmitted by Hesiod. Time (Kronos) produces in the Aither the primordial egg, from which emerges the first ofthe gods, Eros, also called Phanes. It is Eros, the principle of generation, who creates the other gods and the world. But Zeus swallows Phanes and the whole creation and produces a new world. The mythical theme of the absorption of a divinity by Zeus was well known. Hesiod relates that the Olympian had swallowed his wife Metis before the miraculous birth of Athena (§ 84). But in the Orphic theogony the meaning is more subtle; we see in it the effort to make a cosmocrator god into the creator of the world that he rules. In addition, the episode reflects philosophical speculation concerning the production of a multiple universe from an original unity. IS Despite rehandlings, the myth still has an archaic structure. Its analogies with the Egyptian and Phoenician cosmogonies have been rightly emphasized. Other traditions postulate as first principle Nyx (Night), who engendered Uranus and Gaea; or Oceanus, from whom emerged Time (Kronos), who then produced Aither and Chaos; or the One, who gave birth to Conflict, by whose efforts the Earth was separated from the Waters and the Sky. Recently, the Derveni Papyrus19 has revealed a new Orphic theogony, centered around Zeus. A verse attributed to Orpheus proclaims that "Zeus is the beginning, he is the middle, and he brings all things to fulfillment" (col. 13, line 12). Orpheus called Moira (destiny) the "thought" of Zeus. "When men say, ... 'Moira has spun,' they mean to say that the thought of Zeus has determined what is and what is yet to be and also what is yet to come" (col. 15, lines 5-7). Oceanus is only a hypostasis of Zeus, just as Ge (Demeter),

the Mother, Rhea, and Hera are only different names of the same goddess (col. 18, lines 7-11). The cosmogony has a structure that is at once sexual and monistic: Zeus made love "in the air" (or: "from above") and so created the world. But the text does not mention his partner. 20 The author proclaims the unity of existence by affirming that the logos of the world is similar to the logos of Zeus (col. 15, lines 1-3). It follows that the name designating the "world" is "Zeus" (cf. Heraclitus, frags. 1, 32). The text preserved in the Derveni Papyrus is important in several respects; on the one hand, it confirms the existence, at an early period, of actual Orphic conventicles; on the other hand, it illustrates the monistic, or even "monotheistic," tendency of at least this Orphic theogony. As for the myth of the origin of man from the ashes of the Titans, it is clearly documented only in some late authors (first-second centuries A.D.).21 But as we attempted to show in connection with the mythico-ritual theme of Dionysus-Zagreus (§ 125), references are found in earlier sources. Despite the skepticism of certain scholars, it is permissible to see references to man's Titanic nature in Pindar's expression "the penalty of their pristine woe" (frag. 133 Schr.) and in a passage in Plato's Laws (701c) concerning those who show "the 'Titanic nature' of which old legends speak." According to information supplied by Olympiodorus, we may suppose that Xenocrates, Plato's disciple, associated the idea of body as "prison" with Dionysus and the Titans. 22 Whatever interpretation is. put on these few obscure references, it is certain that, in antiquity, the myth of the Titans was regarded as "Orphic." According to this myth, man shared both in the Titanic nature and in divinity, since the ashes of the Titans also contained the body of the infant Dionysus. However, by purifications (katharmOl) and initiation rites (feleta;) and by lead

ing the "Orphic life," one was able to eliminate the Titanic element and so become a bakkhos; in other words, one separated out and assumed the divine, Dionysiac, condition. There is no need to emphasize the novelty and originality of this conception. Let us remember the Mesopotamian precedent: man's creation by Marduk from earth (that is, from the body of the primordial monster Tiamat) and from the blood of the archdemon Kingu (see § 21). But the Orphic anthropogony, somber and tragic as it seems to be, paradoxically contains an element of hope that is absent not only from the Mesopotamian Weltanschauung but also from the Homeric conception. For, despite his Titanic origin, man shares, through the mode of being that is his, in divinity. He is even able to free himself from the "demonic" element manifest in all profane existence (ignorance, flesh diet, etc.). We can make out, on the one hand, a dualism (spirit/body) very close to the Platonic dualism and, on the other hand, a series of myths, beliefs, behaviors, and initiations that insure the separation ofthe "Orphic" from his fellow men and, in the last analysis, the separation of the soul from the cosmos. All this is reminiscent of a number of Indian soteriologies and techniques (§ 195), and it anticipates various Gnostic systems (§§ 229ff.).
182. The new eschatology
As for the "Orphic" eschatology, its general outline can be reconstructed on the basis of certain references made by Plato, Empedocles, and Pindar. According to the Phaedo (t08a) and the Gorgias (524a), the road "is neither straightforward nor single ... ; there are many forkings and crossroads." The Republic (614c-d) adds that the just are allowed to take the right-hand road, while the wicked are sent to the left. Similar indications are found in the verses inscribed on gold plates found in both southern Italian and Cretan tombs and going back at least to the fifth century: "Hail to thee who dost travel by the right-hand road toward the sacred fields and grove of Persephone." The text contains precise indications: "To the left of the abode of



The new eschatology 191
Hades, thou wilt find a spring beside which rises a white cypress; do not go too near to this spring. But thou wilt find another: from the lake of Memory (Mnemosyne) cool waters spring and guardians are on duty there. Say to them: 'I am the child of Earth and starry Heaven; that you know; but I am parched with thirst, and I am dying. Give me quickly of the cool water that flows from the lake of Memory.' And the guardians will of themselves give you to drink from the sacred spring, and after that you will reign with the other heroes."23 In the myth of Er, Plato tells that all souls destined for reincarnation must drink of the spring of Lethe in order to forget their experiences in the other world. But the souls of "Orphics" were believed not to be reincarnated; this is why they were to avoid the water of Lethe. "I have leaped up from the cycle of heavy punishments and sufferings, and I have sped with prompt feet to the desired crown. I have taken refuge under the breast of the Lady, queen of Hell." And the goddess replies: "0 fortunate, 0 happy one! Thou hast become a god, having been a man" (after the translation by A. Boulanger).24 The "cycle of heavy punishments" involves a certain number of reincarnations. After death the soul is judged, is then sent temporarily to a place of punishment or of bliss, and returns to earth after a thousand years. An ordinary mortal has to go through the cycle ten times before he escapes. The "Orphics" described at length the torments of the guilty, "the infinite ills

The initiate addresses the infernal gods: "I come from a community of the pure, 0 pure sovereign of Hades, Eucles, Eubouleus, and you other immortal gods. For I also flatter myself that I belong to your blessed race. But fate laid me low and the other immortal gods" (but see Zuntz's reading, Persephone, p. 318). Another tablet reveals important details: "I have undergone the punishment that my unjust acts deserved.... Now I come praying before the shining Persephone so that, in her beneficence, she will send me to the dwelling of the blessed." The goddess receives him mercifully: "Hail to thee, who hast undergone the suffering thou hadst never suffered before.... Hail, hail, hail to thee, take the right-hand road toward the sacred fields and the grove of Persephone" (after the translation by Boulanger, "Le salut selon I'Orphisme," p. 40).



192 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
in store for the damned."25 Kern even goes so far as to say that Orphism was the first creator of Hell.26 In fact, Orpheus' katabasis in search of Eurydice justified all kinds of descriptions of the infernal world. Again we come upon the shamanic element, a dominating feature of the myth of Orpheus; it is well known that, throughout central and northern Asia, it is the shamans who, telling in infinite detail of their ecstatic descents to the underworld, have elaborated and popularized a vast and spectacular infernal geography.27 The landscape and the itinerary sketched in the gold platesthe spring and the cypress, the right-hand road-as well as the "thirst of the deceased" have parallels in many funerary mythologies and geographies. Certain Oriental influences must not be excluded. But more probably the entire complex represents an immemorial common heritage, the result of millennial speculations on ecstasies, visions, and raptures, oneiric adventures and imaginary journeys-a heritage, to be sure, that was differently valorized by various traditions. The tree beside a spring or a fountain is an exemplary image of "Paradise"; in Mesopotamia what corresponds to it is the garden with a sacred tree and a spring, guarded by the Gardener King, representative of the god (§22). The religious importance of the plates, then, consists in the fact that they present a different conception of the soul's postexistence from the one documented in the Homeric tradition. It is possible that what we have here are archaic Mediterranean and Oriental beliefs and mythologies that, long pre

"Sunk in mud, they will see themselves punished in a manner befitting their moral pollution (Republic 363d; Phaedo 69c), like pigs, loving to wallow in filth (see Plotinus, 1. 6. 6), or they will exhaust themselves in vain efforts to fill a pierced cask or to carry water in a sieve (Gorgias 493b; Rep. 363e), an image, according to Plato, of the madmen who insatiably surrender themselves to ever unsatisfied passions, perhaps actually the punishment of those Who, not having submitted to cathartic ablutions, must, in Hades, constantly but vainly carry the water of the purifying bath" (F. Cumont, Lux perpetua, p.245). 26. Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyklopiidie, s.v. "Mysterien," col. 1287. Cumont (Lux perpetua, p. 46) tends to identify in Orphism the origin of all "that hallucinating literature" that, by way of Plutarch's myths and the Apocalypse of Peter, leads to Dante. 27.

The new eschatology 193
served in "popular" or marginal milieux, had for some time enjoyed a certain repute among the "Orphics," the Pythagoreans, and all those who were haunted by the eschatological enigma. More significant, however, is the new interpretation of the "thirst of the soul." Funerary libations to slake the thirst of the dead are documented in numerous cultures.28 The beliefthat the "Water of Life" insured the hero's resurrection is also widespread in myths and folklore. For the Greeks, death is assimilated to forgetting; the dead are those who have lost the memory of the past. Only a few privileged persons, such as Tiresias or Amphiaraus, keep their memories after death. In order to make his son Aethalides immortal, Hermes gives him "an unfailing memory.' '29 But the mythology of memory and forgetting changes when a doctrine oftransmigration is introduced. Lethe's function is reversed: its waters no longer welcome the newly departed soul in order to make it forget earthly existence; on the contrary, Lethe blots out memory of the celestial world in the soul that returns to earth to be reincarnated. Thus "forgetting" no longer symbolizes death but returning to life. The soul that has been so rash as to drink at the fountain of Lethe (' 'burdened with a load of forgetfulness and wrongdoing," as Plato describes it in Phaedrus 248c) becomes reincarnated and is again hurled into the cycle of becoming. Pythagoras, Empedocles, and still others who believed in the doctrine of metempsychosis claimed to remember their former lives; in other words, they had succeeded
in preserving memory in the beyond.30 The fragments inscribed on the gold plates seem to form part of a canonical text, a sort of guide to the beyond, comparable to the Egyptian or Tibetan "books of the dead." Some scholars

See Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 114 fT. The exercise and cultivation of memory played an important part in the Pythagorean brotherhoods (Diodorns, 10. 5; Iamblichus, Vita Pyth. 78 fT.). The theme of forgetting and remembering, the earliest testimonies to which refer to certain fabulous Greek personages of the sixth century, has played a considerable part in Indian contemplative techniques and speculations; it will be revived by Gnosticism (§ 130).



194 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
have denied their "Orphic" character, holding that they are Pythagorean in origin. It has even been maintained that the majority of the supposedly "Orphic" ideas and rituals really represent Pythagorean creations or rehandlings. The problem is too complex to be settled in a few pages. Yet we will say that the possible contribution of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, even if of considerable magnitude, does not change our understanding of the "Orphic" phenomenon. To be sure, analogies between the legends of Orpheus and Pythagoras are obvious, just as the parallel ~etween their respective reputations is undeniable. Just like the fabulous "founder of initiations," Pythagoras, a historical personage and yet an outstanding example of the "divine man," is characterized by a grandiose synthesis of archaic elements (some of them shamanic) and daring revalorizations of ascetic and contemplative techniques. Indeed, the legends of Pythagoras refer to his relations with gods and spirits, to his mastery over animals, to his presence in several places at the same time. Burkert explains Pythagoras' famous "golden thigh" by comparing it to a shamanic initiation. (We know that during their initiation Siberian shamans are believed to have their organs renewed and their bones sometimes fastened together with iron.) Finally, Pythagoras' katabasis is another shamanic element. Hieronymus of Rhodes relates that Pythagoras descended into Hades and there saw the souls of Homer and Hesiod atoning for all the evil they had spoken of the gods.31 Such shamanic characteristics, moreover, are not found solely in the legends of Orpheus and Pythagoras, for the Hyperborean Abaris, priest of Apollo, flew on an arrow (§ 91); Aristeas of Proconnesus was famous for his ecstasy that could be confused with death, for his bilocation, and for his metamorphosis into a crow; and Hermotimus of Clazomenae, whom some ancient authors held to be a former incarnation of Pythagoras, was able to leave his body for long periods. 32

See Eliade, Zalmoxis, p. 37, notes 44-45, and, for similar examples, ibid., pp. 37-39.



The new eschatology 195
In addition to the similarities in the legendary biographies of their "founders," there are these analogies between the doctrines and practices of the "Orphics" and .the Pythagoreans: a belief in immortality and metempsychosis and in the soul's punishment in Hades and final return to heaven; vegetarianism; the importance attributed to purifications; and asceticism. But these similarities and analogies do not prove the nonexistence of "Orphism" as an autonomous movement. It is possible that a certain number of "Orphic" writings are the work ofPythagoreans, but it would be simpleminded to imagine that the l'Orphic" eschatological myths, beliefs, and rituals were invented by Pythagoras or his disciples. The two religious movements developed in parallel, as expressions of the same Zeitgeist. Yet there is a marked difference between them: under the direction of its founder, the Pythagorean "sect" not only became organized as a closed society, esoteric in type, but the Pythagoreans cultivated a system of "complete education."33 What is more, they did not disdain active politics; during a certain period Pythagoreans even held power in several cities in southern Italy. Pythagoras' great merit is to have laid the foundations for a "total science," holistic in structure, in which scientific knowledge was integrated into a complex of ethical, metaphysical, and religious principles accompanied by various "corporal techniques." In short, knowledge had a function that was at once gnoseological, existential, and soteriological. It is the "total science" of the traditional type,34 which can be recognized in Plato's thought as well as in the humanists of the Italian Renaissance, in Paracelsus, and in the alchemists of the sixteenth century
33. By completing their ascetic and moral rules by the study of music, mathematics, and astronomy. But, as is well known, the real goal of these disciplines was mystical in nature. In fact, if "All is number" and "All is a harmony of contraries," everything that lives (the cosmos included, for it, too, "breathes") is akin. 34. The fact that, after Aristotle, this type of' 'total science" loses its prestige and that scientific research orients itself toward a methodology that, in Europe, will produce its first brilliant results in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in no way implies the inadequacy of the holistic approach. It is simply a matter of a new point of view and a different telos. Alchemy was not an embryonic chemistry; it was a discipline bound up with a different system of significances and pursuing a different end.



196 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
a "total science" such as was realized, above all, by Indian and Chinese medicine and alchemy. Some authors tend to consider the Orphic movement a sort of "church," or a sect comparable to that of the Pythagoreans. Yet it is not at all probable that Orphism set itself up as a "church" or as a secret organization, similar to the Mystery religions. What characterizes it-a movement at once "popular" and attractive to elites, involving "initiations" and possessing "books" -brings it closer to Indian Tantrism and to Neo-Taoism. These religious movements do not constitute "churches" either, but they include "schools," representing parallel traditions, made illustrious by a series of sometimes legendary masters, and possessing a very large literature. 35 On the other hand, we may recognize in the "Orphics" the successors to the initiatory groups that in the archaic period performed various functions under the names of Cabiri, Telchines, Curetes, and Dactyls-groups whose members jealously guarded certain "trade secrets" (they were metallurgists and smiths, but also healers, diviners, masters of initiation, etc.). It was simply that, with the "Orphics," these trade secrets connected with various techniques for obtaining mastery over matter had given place to secrets connected with the soul's destiny after death. Although the prestige of Orphism declined after the Persian Wars, its central ideas (the dualism, the immortality, and therefore the divinity of man, the eschatology), especially through Plato's interpretation, continued to influence Greek thought. The trend also survived on the "popular" level (the "Orpheotelestes"). Later on, in the Hellenistic period, we can identify the influence of certain Orphic conceptions in the Mystery religions; still later, in the first centuries of the Christian era, Orphism will arouse a new interest, due especially to the Neo-Platonists and Neo-Pythagoreans. It is precisely this ability to develop and renew itself, to take part creatively in a number of religious syncretisms, that reveals the scope ofthe "Orphic" experience.
35. And, just as in the case of Tantrism, certain Orphic texts of more recent date are presented as revelations of an ancient doctrine-which, at least in certain cases, may well be true.



Plato, Pythagoras, and Orphism 197
As for the figure of Orpheus, it continued to be reinterpreted, independently from "Orphism," by Jewish and Christian theologians, by the Hermeticists and philosophers of the Renaissance, by poets from Poliziano to Pope and from Novalis to Rilke and Pierre Emmanuel. Orpheus is one of the very few Greek mythical figures that Europe, whether Christian, rationalistic, romantic, or modem, has not been willing to forget (see volume 3).
183. Plato, Pythagoras, and Orphism
According to A. N. Whitehead's celebrated formulation, the history of Western philosophy is only a series of glosses on the philosophy of Plato. Plato's importance in the history of religious ideas is also considerable: late antiquity, Christian theology, especially from the fourth century on, Ismaelitic gnosis, the Italian Renaissance, all were profoundly, if differently, marked by the Platonic religious vision. The fact is all the more significant because Plato's first and most tenacious vocation was not religious but political. In fact, Plato aspired to build the ideal city, organized in accordance with the laws ofjustice and harmony, a city in which each inhabitant was to perform a definite and specific function. For some time Athens and the other Greek cities had been undermined by a series of political, religious, and moral crises that threatened the very foundations of the social edifice. Socrates had identified the prime source of the disintegration in the relativism of the Sophists and the spread of skepticism. By denying the existence of an absolute and immutable principle, the Sophists implicitly denied the possibility of objective knowledge. In order to show the faultiness of their reasoning, Socrates had concentrated on maieutics, a method of arriving at selfknowledge and the discipline of the soul's faculties. Investigation of the natural world did not interest him. But Plato attempted to complete his master's teaching; and, to provide a scientific basis for the validity of knowledge, he studied mathematics. He was fascinated by the Pythagorean conception of universal unity, of the immutable order of the cosmos, and of the harmony that



198 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
governs both the course of the planets and the musical scale.36 In elaborating the theory of Ideas-extraterrestrial and immutable archetypes of terrestrial realities-Plato replied to the Sophists and the skeptics: objective knowledge is, then, possible, since it is based on preexisting and eternal models. For our purpose it does not matter that Plato sometimes speaks of the world of Ideas as the model of our world-in which material objects "imitate" the Ideas to the extent of their abilityand sometimes affirms that the world of sensible realities "participates" in the world of the Ideas.J7 Still, once this universe of eternal models was duly postulated, it was necessary to explain when, and how, men are able to know the Ideas. It is to solve this problem that Plato took over certain "Orphic" and Pythagorean doctrines concerning the soul's destiny. To be sure, Socrates had already insisted on the inestimable value of the soul, for it alone was the source of knowledge. Taking his stand against the traditional opinion, sanctioned by Homer, that the soul was "like smoke," Socrates had emphasized the need to "take care of one's soul." Plato went much further: for him, the soul-and not life/-was the most precious thing, for it belonged to the ideal and eternal world. So he borrowed from the "Orphico"-Pythagorean tradition, at the same time adapting it to his own system, the doctrine ofthe transinigration of the soul and of "recollecting" (anamnesis). For Plato, in the last analysis, knowing amounts to recollecting (see esp. Meno 81 c-d). Between two terrestrial existences the soul contemplates the Ideas: it enjoys pure and perfect knowledge. But in the course of being reincarnated, the soul drinks from the spring of Lethe and forgets the knowledge it had ac- . quired by direct contemplation of the Ideas. However, this knowledge is latent in incarnate man, and, by virtue of the work of philosophy, it can be recalled. Physical objects help the soul to withdraw into itself, and, by a kind of "backward return," to
36. Aristotle writes, not without malice, that the only difference between Plato and Pythagoras is terminological (Metaphysics 987blO ff.), But, as Burkert rightly observes (Lore and Science, p. 44), for Pythagoras things are numbers.

Plato, Pythagoras, and Orphism 199
find again and recover the original knowledge that it possessed in its extraterrestrial condition. Death is therefore the return to a primordial and perfect state, periodically lost during the soul's reincarnation. 38. Philosophy is a "preparation for death" in the sense that it teaches the soul, once delivered from the body, how to maintain itself in the world of the Ideas continually and therefore to avoid a new reincarnation. In short, not only valid knowledge but the only policy that could save the Greek cities from impending ruin was based on a philosophy that postulated an ideal and eternal universe and the transmigration ofthe soul.39 Eschatological speCUlations were highly fashionable. To be sure, the doctrines of the soul's immortality and of transmigration and metempsychosis were not novelties. In the sixth century Pherecydes of Syros had been the first the maintain that the soul is immortal and that it returns to earth in successive reincarnations.40 It is difficult to identify the possible source of this belief. In Pherecydes' day it was clearly formulated only in India. The Egyptians considered the soul to be immortal and capable of assuming different animal forms, but we find no trace of a general theory of transmigration. The Getae also believed in the possibility of "making oneself immortal," but they knew nothing of metempsychosis and transmigration.41 In any case, Pherecydes' eschatology had no echo in the Greek world. It is "Orphism," and especially Pythagoras, his disciples, and his contemporary, Empedocles, who popularized, and at the same time systematized, the doctrine of transmigration and

39. It may be recalled that Indian metaphysics laboriously developed the doctrine of transmigration (saf!lsara) but did not relate it to the theory of knowledge, to say nothing of politics (§ 80). 40.

200 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
metempsychosis. But the cosmological speculations of Leucippus and Democritus, recent astronomical discoveries, and, above all, Pythagoras' teaching had radically changed the conception of the survival of the soul and hence of the structures of the beyond. Since it was now known that the Earth was a sphere, neither Homer's underground Hades nor the Isles ofthe Blessed, supposed to lie in the farthest West, could any longer be localized in a terrestrial mythogeography. A Pythagorean maxim proclaimed that the Isles of the Blessed were "the Sun and the Moon."42 Gradually a new eschatology and a different funerary geography became dominant: the beyond is now localized in the region of the stars; the soul is declared to be of celestial origin (according to Leucippus and Democritus, it is "of fire," like the sun and the moon), and it will end by returning to the heavens. To this eschatology Plato brought a decisive contribution. He elaborated a new and more consistent "mythology of the soul," drawing from the "Orphico"-Pythagorean tradition and using certain Oriental sources but integrating all these elements into a personal vision. He does not draw at all on the "classical" mythology, based on Homer and Hesiod. A long process of erosion had ended by emptying the Homeric myths and gods of
their original meaning.43 In any case, the "mythology ofthe soul" could have found no support in the Homeric tradition. On the other hand, in his youthful dialogues Plato himself had opposed mythos to logos; at best, myth is a mixture of fiction and truth. However, in his early masterpiece, the Symposium, Plato does not hesitate to discourse at length on two mythological motifs, the cosmogonic Eros and, above all, the primitive man, imagined as a bisexual being, spherical in form (Symp. 18ge and 193d). But these are myths that are archaic in structure. The androgyny of the First Man is documented in several ancient traditions (for
42. But another tradition, describing Pythagoras' katabasis, implied belief in an underground Hades. 43. Xenophanes (born ca. 565) already did not hesitate openly to attack the Homeric pantheon, especially the anthropomorphism of the gods. He maintained the existence of "a god above all the gods and all men; neither his form nor his thought has anything in common with that of mortals" (frag. 23). Even so profoundly religious an author as Pindar objects to "unbelievable" myths (Olymp. 1. 28 ff.).



Plato, Pythagoras, and Orphism 201
example, among the Indo-Europeans).44 The message of the myth of the androgyne is obvious: human perfection is conceived of as an unbroken unity. However, Plato adds new meaning to it: the spherical form and the movements of the anthromorph resemble the heavenly bodies, from which this primordial being was descended. What most needed to be explained was man's celestial origin, since it was the basis for Plato's "mythology of the soul." In the Gorgias (493) we come for the first time upon an eschatological myth: the body is the tomb of the soul. Socrates defends this eschatology, citing Euripides and the "Orphico"-Pythagorean tradition. Transmigration is here only implied, but this theme, which is of capital importance for the Platonic eschatology, is, as we have just seen, analyzed in the Meno (81a-e). In the Phaedo (107e) it is further stated that the soul returns to earth after a long time. The Republic uses the old symbolism of macrocosm/microcosm but develops it in a specifically Platonic way by showing the homology among the soul, the state, and the cosmos. But it is above all the myth of the Cave (Rep., bk. 7) that bears witness to Plato's powerful mythological creativity. The eschatological vision attains its high point in the Phaedrus; there, for the first time, the soul's destiny is declared to be bound up with the motions of the heavens (246b ff.). The first principle of the cosmos is found to be identical with the first principle of the soul. It is significant that the same dialogue employs two exotic symbolisms: that of the soul as a charioteer driving his chariot, and that ofthe "wings ofthe soul." The first is found in the Katha Upani~ad (1. 3. 3-6), but with the difference that, in Plato, the soul's difficulty in controlling the two horses is due to the antagonism between them. As for the "wings of the soul," they "begin to grow" when man "beholds the beauty of this world [and] is reminded of true Beauty" (24ge). The growth of wings as the result of an initiation is documented in China, among the Taoists, and in the secret traditions of the Australian medicine

men. 45 The image is bound up with the conception of the soul as a volatile spiritual substance, comparable to the bird or the butterfly. "Flight" symbolizes intelligence, comprehension of secret things or metaphysical truths.46 There is nothing surprising in the use of this immemorial symbolism. Plato "rediscovers" and develops what may be called the archaic ontology: the theory of Ideas carries on the doctrine of exemplary models that is characteristic of traditional spirituality.
The cosmogonic myth of the Timaeus elaborates certain suggestions contained in the Protagoras and the Symposium, but it is a new creation. And it is significant that it is a Pythagorean, Timaeus, who, in this supreme cosmogonic vision of Plato's, affirms that the Demiurge created just as many souls as there are stars (Tim. 41d ff.). Plato's disciples later arrive at the doctrine of "astral immortality." Now it is by virtue of this grandiose Platonic synthesis that the "Orphic" and Pythagorean elements it had incorporated will achieve their widest dissemination. This doctrine, in which a Babylonian contribution is also discernible (the divinity of the stars), will become dominant from the Hellenistic period on.47 The political reform of which Plato dreamed never became more than a project. A generation after his death the Greek citystates were collapsing before Philip of Macedon's dizzying advance. It is one of the rare moments in universal history when the end of a world is almost indistinguishable from the beginning of a new type of civilization: the civilization that is to flower in the Hellenistic period. It is significant that Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato are among the sources of inspiration for the new religiosity.
45. The Taoists believe that, when a seeker obtains the tao, feathers begin to sprout from his body. On Australian medicine men, see Eliade, Australian Religions, pp. 134 ff.

"He who comprehends has wings" (Pancavimca BriihmafJa 4. l. 13). 47. See Burkert, Lore and Science, p. 360. The belief that the soul is related to the heavens and the stars-and even that it comes from the heavens and returns there-is held by the Ionian philosophers, beginning at least with Heraclitus and Anaxagoras (Burkert, p. 362).

When, on June 13th of a year that was probably 323, Philip's son, Alexander, died at Babylon at less than thirty-three years of age, his kingdom extended from Egypt to the Punjab. In the course of the twelve years and eight months of his reign he had put down rebellions in Greece, had subdued Asia Minor and Phoenicia, had conquered the empire of the Achaemenides, and had defeated Porus. And yet, despite his genius and his halfdivine aura-for he was held to be the son of Zeus-AmmonAlexander learned at the Beas the limits of his power. His army had mutinied, refusing to cross the river and continue the advance into India, and the "master of the world" was forced to yield. It was his greatest defeat and the ruin of his fabulous project: the conquest of Asia even as far as the "outer Ocean." However, when Alexander gave the order to retreat, the immediate future of India, as well as the future of the historical world in general, was already outlined: Asia was now open to Mediterranean influences; from then on, communications between East and West would never be completely severed. Since the biography by J. G. Droysen (1833), and especially since the book by W. W. Tarn (1926), a number of historians have applied different, not to say contradictory, points of view to interpreting the goal that Alexander pursued in his conquest of Asia.48 It would be foolish to attempt, in a few pages, an analysis of a controversy that has gone on for a century and a half. But from whatever point of view Alexander's campaigns are judged, there is agreement that their consequences were profound and irrevocable. Mter Alexander the historical profile of the world was radically changed. The earlier political and religious structures-the city-states and their cult institutions, the polis as "center of the world" and reservoir of exemplary models, the anthropology elaborated on the basis of a certainty that there was an irreducible difference between Greeks and "barbarians"-all these structures collapse. In their place the notion of the oikoumene and "cosmopolitan" and "universalistic" trends

become increasingly dominant. Despite resistances, the discovery of the fundamental unity of the human race was inevitable. Aristotle, Alexander's tutor, maintained that slaves are slaves simply by their nature and that the "barbarians" are slaves naturaliter.49 But at Susa Alexander married two Achaemenid princesses and, using the Persian rite, united ninety of his close companions to the daughters of noble Iranian families. At the same time, the marriages of ten thousand Macedonian soldiers were performed, again according to the Persian rite. Afterwards Persians were given leading positions in the army and were even integrated into the phalanx. The Macedonians were far from sharing in their sovereign's political concept. Since they were victorious and conquerors, they saw in the "barbarians" only subjected peoples. When the Macedonians mutinied at Opisbecause, as one of them put it, "You have made Persians your relatives"-Alexander exclaimed: "But I have made you all my relatives!" The sedition ended in a banquet of reconciliation to which, according to tradition, 3,000 persons were invited. At the end of it Alexander uttered a prayer for peace and wished that all the peoples on earth could live together in harmony and in unity of heart and mind (homonoia). "He had previously said that all men were sons of one Father, and that his prayer was the expression of his recorded belief that he had a mission from God to be the Reconciler of the World."50 Alexander never proclaimed himself the son of Zeus; however, he accepted the title from others. To insure fusion between the Greeks and the Persians, he introduced the Iranian ceremonial of "obeisance" (proskynesis) to the king. (He had already adopted the dress and etiquette of the Achaemenid sovereigns.) For the Iranians, proskynesis varied in accordance with the social rank of the person performing it. A bas-relief from Persepolis represents Darius I seated on his throne and a noble Persian kissing his hand to him. But Herodotus states that subjects of lower rank prostrated themselves before the sovereign. However, sur

Alexander the Great and Hellenistic culture 205
prised by his companions' resistance, Alexander renounced proskynesis at the same time that he renounced the idea of becoming the god of his empire.51 Probably this latter idea had been inspired in him by the example ofthe pharaohs, but account must also be taken of certain tendencies that were beginning to develop in Greece. To give only one example: Aristotle wrotecertainly with Alexander in mind-that, when the supreme sovereign would come, he would be a god among men (Politics 3. 13; 1284a). In any case, Alexander's successors in Asia and Egypt will not hesitate to accept deification. After twenty years of wars among the Diadochi, what was left of the empire was divided among the three Macedonian dynasties: Asia fell to the Seleucids, Egypt to the Lagids (Ptolemies), and Macedonia to the Antigonids. Butfrom ca. 2120n, Rome began to interfere in the affairs ofthe Hellenistic kingdoms and ended by absorbing the entire Mediterranean world. When Octavius conquered Egypt (ca. 30), the new oikoumene extended from Egypt and Macedonia to Anatolia and Mesopotamia. But the establishment ofthe Imperium Romanum also marked the end ofHellenistic civilization. The unification of the historical world begun by Alexander was accomplished initially by the massive emigration of Hellenes into the eastern regions and by the spread of the Greek language and of Hellenistic culture. Common Greek (koine) was spoken and written from India and Iran to Syria, Palestine, Italy, and Egypt. In the cities, whether ancient or recently founded, the Greeks built temples and theaters and established their gymnasia. Schooling of the Greek type was increasingly adopted by the rich and privileged of all the Asiatic countries. From one end to the other of the Hellenistic world, the value and importance of education and "wisdom" were glorified. Education-almost always based on a philosophy-enjoyed an almost religious prestige. Never before in history had education been so sought after,

both as a means of social advancement and as an instrument of spiritual perfection.52 The fashionable philosophies-first of all Stoicism, founded by a Cyprian Semite, Zeno of Citium,53 but also the doctrines of Epicurus and the Cynics-became dominant in all the cities of the oikoumene. What has been called the "Hellenistic Enlightenment" encouraged individualism and at the same time cosmopolitanism. The decadence of the polis had freed the individual from his immemorial civic and religious ties; on the other hand, this freedom showed him his solitude and alienation in a cosmos that was terrifying by its mystery and vastness. The Stoics did their utmost to support the individual by showing him the homology between the city and the universe. Diogenes, Alexander's contemporary, had already proclaimed that he was a cosmopolites, a "citizen of the world"54 (in other words, Diogenes refused to accept citizenship in any city, any country). But it was the Stoics who popularized the idea that all men are cosmopolitai--citizens of the same city, .i.e., the cosmos-whatever their social origin or geographical situation.55 "Zeno's earliest work, his Republic, exhibited a resplendent hope which has never quite left man since; he dreamt of a world which should no longer be separate states, but one great City under one divine law, where all were citizens and members of one another, bound together, not by human laws, but by their own willing consent or (as he phrased it) by Love."56 Epicurus, too, fostered "cosmopolitanism," but his principal object was the well-being of the individual. He admitted the
52. In western and central Europe we must wait until the seventeenth century before we find a similar glorification-that of the "new science," that is, of a new method of education and scientific research, by virtue of which it was hoped to purify and reform the Christian world. See vol. 3. 53. Arriving in Athens ca. 315, Zeno opened his school in the Portico of the Painters (Stoa Poikile) in ca. 300. Epicurus, born at Samos of an Athenian father, taught at Athens beginning in ca. 306. 54. Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philosophers 6. 22. But, concerned exclusively with the well-being of the individual, the Cynics took no interest in the community. 55. M.

existence of the gods. However, the gods had nothing to do with either the cosmos or with mankind. The world was a machine, which had come into being in a purely mechanical way, without author or purpose. It followed that man was free to choose the mode of existence that best suited him. Epicurus' philosophy undertook to show that the serenity and happiness obtained by ataraxia were the characteristics of the best possible existence. The founder of Stoicism articulated his system in opposition to the doctrine of Epicurus. According to Zeno and his disciples, the world developed from the primordial epiphany of God, the fiery seed that gave birth to "seminal reason" (logos spermatikos), that is, to universal law. Similarly, the human intelligence emerges from a divine spark. In this monistic pantheism, which postulates a single logos (reason), the cosmos is "a living being full of wisdom" (Stoicorum veterum!ragmenta, vol. 1, nos. 171 ff.; vol. 2, nos. 441-44). Now the wise man discovers in the utmost depths of his soul that he possesses the same logos as that which animates and governs the cosmos (a conception reminiscent of the oldest Upanishads; see § 81). So the cosmos is intelligible and welcoming, since it is suffused by reason. By practicing wisdom, man realizes identity with the divine and freely assumes the destiny that is proper to him. It is true that the world and human existence unfold in accordance with a strictly predetermined plan; but, by the mere fact that he cultivates virtue and does his duty-that, in short, he accomplishes the divine will-the wise man proves that he is free and transcends determinism. Freedom is equivalent to discovering the soul's self-sufficiency (autarkeia). In relation to the world and to other men, the soul is invulnerable; one can harm only oneself. This glorification of the soul at the same time proclaims the fundamental equality of men. But, to obtain freedom, one must free oneself of the emotions and renounce everything-"body, property, reputation, books, office"; for otherwise man is "a slave to each thing he desires," he is "under the control of others" (Epictetus, 4. 4.33). The equation possessions and desires = slavery is reminiscent of Indian doctrines, especially Yoga and Buddhism (§§143 ff., 156 ff.). Similarly, Epictetus' exclamation addressed to God, "I am of one mind with Thee; I am Thine" (2. 16.42), suggests countless Indian parallels.



208 ORPHEUS AND PYTHAGORAS
The analogies between the Indian metaphysical systems and soteriologies and those of the Mediterranean world will multiply during the first centuries before and after Christ. We shall return to the significance of this spiritual phenomenon. Like the new philosophies, the innovations typical of the Hellenistic religions were directed to the individual's salvation. The closed organizations, involving eschatological initiation and revelation, multiply. The initiatory tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries (see chap. 12) will be taken over and amplified by the various mysteriosophic religions centered around divinities held to have experienced and conquered death (§ 205). Such divinities were closer to man; they took an interest in his spiritual progress and insured his salvation. Side by side with the gods and goddesses of the Hellenistic Mysteries-Dionysus, Isis, Osiris, Cybele, Attis, Mithra-other divinities became popular, and for the same reason: Helios, Heracles, Asclepius protect and help the individual.57 Even deified kings seem to be more efficacious than the traditional gods: the king receives the title "savior" (soter); he incarnates the "living law" (nomos empsychos). The Greco-Oriental syncretism that characterizes the new Mystery religions at the same time illus,trates the powerful spiritual reaction to the Orient that Alexander had conquered. The Orient is glorified as the fatherland of the earliest and most respected "sages," the land where the masters of wisdom have best preserved and guarded esoteric doctrines and methods of salvation. The legend of Alexander's discussion with the Indian Brahmans and ascetics, a legend that will become strangely popular in the Christian period, reflects the prevailing, almost religious, admiration for Indian "wisdom." It is from the Orient that certain apocalypses (bound up with particular conceptions of history) will be disseminated, together with new magical and angelological formulas and a number of "revelations" obtained as the result of ecstatic journeys to heaven and the other world (see § 202). Further on we shall analyze the importance of the religious creations of the Hellenistic period (§ 205). For the moment we

will add that, from the point of view of the history of religions, the unification of the historical world begun by Alexander and completed by the Roman Empire is comparable to the unity of the Neolithic world brought about by the dissemination of agriculture. On the level of rural societies, the tradition inherited from the Neolithic constituted a unity that was maintained for millennia, despite influences from urban centers. Compared to this fundamental unity, clearly visible among the agricultural populations of Europe and Asia, the urban societies of the first millennium B.C. presented a considerable religious diversity. (We need only contrast the religious structures of some Oriental, Greek, and Roman cities.) But during the Hellenistic period the religiosity of the oikoumene will end by adopting a common language.

The Buddha could have no successor. He had revealed the Law (dharma) and established the community (sarrzgha); it now became necessary to codify the Law, that is, to collect the Blessed One's sermons and settle the canon. The great disciples, Sariputra and Maudgalayana, had died. I As for Ananda, who was the Master's faithful servant for twenty-five years, he was not an arhat: he had not had time to learn the techniques of meditation. The first steps toward holding a council of 500 arhats were taken by Mahakasyapa; he too had been highly esteemed by the Buddha, but he was rigid and intolerant in character, unlike the amiable Ananda. According to unanimous tradition, the council took place in a huge cave near Rajagrha, during the rainy season that followed the Master's death, and it went on for seven months, Most of the sources report a serious tension between Mahakasyapa and Ananda. Not being an arhat, the latter found that he was refused the right to take part in the council. Ananda retired into solitude and very soon achieved sanctity. He was then admitted or, according to other versions, miraculously made his way into the cave, thus displaying his yogic powers. In any case, his presence was indispensable, for Ananda alone had heard and memorized all the Master's discourses. In answer to Mahakasyapa's questions, Ananda recited them. His answers made up the body of

the Sutras. The texts that composed the "basket" (pi{aka) of the Discipline, vinaya, were communicated by another disciple, Upali. Soon afterward Mahakasyapa was said to have accused Ananda of having been guilty of a number of faults (five or ten) while he served the Blessed One. The most serious ones were having supported the admission of nuns and having failed to ask the Blessed One to prolong his life until the end of the present cosmic cycle (see § 150). Ananda had to confess his faults in public, but he finally triumphed and became the leading figure in the safflgha. He was said to have lived the rest of his life (for forty,- or at least twenty-four, years after the parinirviifJ,a) following his Master's example, that is, traveling and preaching the Way. Little is known of the history of Buddhism after the council at Rajagrha. The various lists of patriarchs who were supposed to have guided the safflgha during the following century provide no valid information. What appears to be certain is the expansion of Buddhism westward and its entrance into the Deccan. It is also probable that doctrinal differences and divergent interpretations of the Discipline increased. A hundred or a hundred and ten years after the parinirviifJ,a, a comparatively serious crisis made a new council necessary. Yasas, a disciple of Ananda's, was indignant at the behavior of the monks of Vaisali, especially at their accepting gold and silver. He managed to bring about a meeting of 700 arhats at Vaisali itself. The council condemned the questionable practices, and the guilty were constrained to accept the decision.2 The disagreements, however, not only continued but grew worse, and it seems certain that different sects already existed
toward the middle of the fourth century B.C. A few years after the council at Vaisali a monk named Mahadeva proclaimed at Pataliputra five unorthodox theses concerning the condition of being of an arhat. He maintained that an arhat (1) can be seduced in a dream (that is, the daughters of Mara can make him have a seminal emission); (2) can still be in some degree ignorant;

212 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
(3) can have doubts; (4) can progress in the Way by the help of another; and (5) can achieve concentration by uttering certain words. Such a diminishing of the arhat expressed a reaction against the exaggerated self-esteem of those who considered themselves to be "delivered in life." The communities very quickly divided into partisans and adversaries of Mahadeva. The council, meeting at Pataliputra, could not prevent the salflgha's dividing between the partisans of the "five points"-who, claiming to be the more numerous, took the name of MahasaIpghikaand their opponents, who, maintaining that they represented the opinion of the elders (sthavira), called themselves Sthaviras.
186. The time between Alexander the Great and Asoka
The first schism was decisive and exemplary, for other differences followed it. The unity of the salflgha was irremediably broken, though without halting the spread of Buddhism. During the quarter of a century after the schism, two events of unparalleled importance for the future of India took place. The first was the invasion by Alexander the Great, which had decisive consequences for India, which was thenceforth open to Hellenistic influences. However, indifferent as it was to history and completely without historiographic consciousness, India preserved no memory of Alexander or of his prodigious enterprise. It is only by way of the fabulous legends that circulated later (the so-called "Alexander Romance") that Indian folklore became conscious of the most extraordinary adventure in the ancient history. But the results of this first real encounter with the West were very soon felt in Indian culture and policy. The GrecoBuddhist sculptures of Gandhara are only one example, but an important one, for they initiated the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha. The second notable event was the founding of the Maurya dynasty by Chandragupta (1 320-296), a prince who, in his youth, had known Alexander. After reconquering several regions in the Northwest, he overcame the Nandas and became king of Magadha. Chandragupta laid the foundations for the first Indian

"empire," which his grandson, Asoka, was destined to enlarge and consolidate. At the beginning of the third century, Vatslputra, a Brahman converted by the Sthaviras, defended the doctrine of the continuity of the person (pudgala) through its transmigrations (see § 157). He was able to found a sect, and it became powerful. Soon afterward, during the reign of Asoka, the Sthaviras underwent a new division because of the theory supported by some that "everything exists" (sarvam asti)-things past, present, and future. Asoka summoned a council, but without result. The innovators were given the name Sarvastivadins. Since the sovereign was opposed to them, they took refuge in Kashmir, thus introducing Buddhism into that Himalayan region. The great event in the history of Buddhism was the conversion of Asoka (who reigned from 274 to 236 or, according to another computation, from 268 to 234). According to his own confession (published in the Thirteenth Edict), Asoka was deeply troubled after his victory over the Kaliilgas, which cost the enemy 100,000 dead and 150,000 prisoners. But thirteen years earlier Asoka had been guilty of an even more odious crime. When the death of his father, King Bindusara, appeared imminent, Asoka had his brother murdered and seized power. However, this pitiless conqueror and fratricide was to become "the most virtuous of Indian sovereigns and one of the greatest figures in history" (Filliozat). Three years after his victory over the Kaliilgas he was converted to Buddhism. He publicly announced his conversion and for years went on pilgrimages to the holy places. But despite his deep devotion to the Buddha, Asoka exhibited great tolerance; he was generous toward the other religions of the empire, and the dharma that he professed is at once Buddhist and Brahmanic. The Twelfth Edict, chiseled in stone, states: "King Priyadarsl honors men of all faiths, members of religious orders and laymen alike, with gifts and various marks of esteem. Yet he does not value either gifts or honors as much as growth in the qualities essential to religion in men of all faiths" (trans. N. A. Nikam and Richard McKeon, The Edicts of Asoka, University of Chicago Press, 1959). In the last analysis, we here have the old idea



214 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
of a cosmic order whose exemplary representative is the cosmocratic sovereign.3 Nevertheless, this last ofthe great Mauryas, who reigned over almost all of India, was also an ardent propagator of the Law, for he considered it the most suited to human nature. He propagated Buddhism everywhere, sending missionaries as far as Bactria, Sogdiana, and Ceylon. According to tradition, Ceylon was converted by his son or by his younger brother. This event had marked consequences, for that island has remained Buddhist down to our day. The impetus that Asoka gave to missionary work continued during the following centuries, despite persecution by the Mauryas' successors and invasions by Scythian peoples. From Kashmir, Buddhism spread into eastern Iran and, by way of Central Asia, reached even China (first century A.D.) and Japan (sixth century). From Bengal and Ceylon it made its way, in the first centuries of our era, into Indochina and the Indian Archipelago. Asoka proclaimed: "All men are my children. Just as I seek the welfare and happiness of my own children in this world and the next, I seek the same things for all men" (trans. N. A. Nikam and Richard McKeon). His dream of an empire-that is, of the world-unified by religion perished with him. After his death the Maurya empire rapidly declined. But Asoka's messianic faith and his energy in propagating the Law made it possible for Buddhism to be transformed into a universal religion, the only universal religion of salvation that Asia has accepted.
187. Doctrinal tensions and new syntheses
By his messianic policy Asoka had insured the universal triumph of Buddhism. But the swift flowering and the creativity of Buddhist thought have their sources elsewhere. To begin with, the tension between the "speculatives" and the "yogins," encouraged, in both alike, a notable effort of exegesis and doctrinal investigation. Next, the theoretical discrepancies, not to say con

Doctrinal tensions and new syntheses 215
tradictions, present in the canonical texts, obliged the disciples constantly to go back to the source, that is, to the fundamental principles of the Master's teaching. This hermeneutic effort resulted in a marked enrichment of thought. The schisms and the sects in fact provide proof that the Master's teaching could neither be exhausted by an orthodoxy nor be rigidly straitjacketed into scholasticism.4 Finally it must be remembered that, like every other Indian religious movement, Buddhism was syncretistic in the sense that it continually assimilated and integrated non-Buddhist values. The example had been set by the Buddha himself, who had accepted a large part ofthe Indian heritage-not only the doctrine of karman and salflsiira, yogic techniques and analyses of the Brahmar,a and Sarpkhya type, but also the pan-Indian mythological images, symbols, and themes-on condition that he might reinterpret it from his own point of view. Thus it is probable that the traditional cosmology, with its innumerable heavens and hells and their inhabitants, was already accepted in the Buddha's day. The cult of relics became obligatory immediately after the parinirviilJa; it certainly had antecedents in the veneration paid to certain famous yogins. The stupas are the center for a cosmological symbolism that is not lacking in originality but that, in its chief outlines, existed before Buddhism. That so many architectural and artistic monuments have disappeared, added to the fact that a great part of the early Buddhist literature has been lost, makes chronologies only approximate, but it is beyond doubt that a number of symbolisms, ideas, and rituals precede, sometimes by several centuries, the earliest documents that testify to them. Thus to the philosophical creativity illustrated by the new "schools" there corresponds a slower, but equally creative, process of syncretism and integration, which is realized especially among the mass oflaymen.5 The stupa, which was presumed to contain relics of the Buddha or of the saints, or sacred objects,

216 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
probably derives from the tumulus in which the ashes were buried after cremation. The dome, surrounded by a circular corridor that served for circumambulation, rose from the center of a terrace. The caitya was a pillared sanctuary, comprising a vestibule, a deambulatory, and a small walled-up chamber containing texts written on various materials. With time, the caitya comes to resemble the temple and finally disappears as a separate unit. The cult consisted in prostrations and ritual greetings, circumambulation and offerings of flowers, perfumes, parasols, etc. The paradox-worshiping a Being that no longer had any relation with this world-is only a seeming one. For approaching the traces of the Buddha's "physical body," reactualized in the stiipa, or his "architectonic body," symbolized in the structure of the temple, is equivalent to assimilating the doctrine, that is, to absorbing his "theoretical body," the dharma. The cult later rendered to the Buddha's statues and the pilgrimages to various places sanctified by his presence (Bodh-Gaya, Sarnath, etc.) are justified by the same dialectic; that is, the various objects or activities belonging to salflsiira are able to facilitate the disciple's salvation by virtue of the grand and irreversible soteriological action of 1he Awakened One.6 For centuries, and probably immediately after his death, the Blessed One was represented-and venerated-in aniconic form: his footprint, the Tree, the Wheel. These symbols made the Law present by suggesting, respectively, the Buddha's missionary activity, the Tree of his Awakening, and "setting the wheel of the Law in motion." When, at the beginning of the Christian era, the first statues of the Buddha were made (the Greco-Indian sculptures of Gandhara), the human figure did not hide the fundamental symbolism. As Paul Mus has shown, the image of the Buddha inherits the religious values of the Vedic altar. On the other hand, the nimbus that shines around the heads of the Buddhas (and around Christ in the Christian art of the same period, first-fifth centuries) derives from a prototype of the Achaemenid period, especially the shining halo of Ahura Mazda. (Besides,
6. The earliest tradition holds that. before the parinirvc1fJa. the Buddha accepted all the gifts and all the homage that were to be rendered to him by his disciples through the ages; see Vasubandhu, Abhidharmakosa. vol. 4, pp. 236-46.



Doctrinal tensions and new syntheses 217
this prototype carries on the old Mesopotamian conceptions; see § 20). In the Buddhist iconography the symbolism preponderantly emphasizes the identity of the Buddha's nature with light, and, as we have seen (§ 81), from the /?g Veda on, light was regarded as the most adequate image and expression for "spirit." The life of the monks underwent some changes with the building of monasteries (viharas). The only change that concerns us is the multiplication of doctrinal writings and works of erudition. Despite the immense number oflost books (as the result of which we know almost nothing of many schools and sects), Buddhist literature in Pali and SanskriC is impressive by its bulk. The texts that make up the "Supreme Doctrine"-the third "basket," the Abhidharma Pi(aka-were produced between 300 B.C. and A.D. 100. It is a literature that contrasts in style with the Siitras, consisting, as it does, of works that are rationalistic, didactic, dry, impersonal. The Buddha's message is reinterpreted and presented in the form of a philosophical system, and the authors make every effort to explain the abundant contradictions in the Siitras. Obviously, each sect has an abhidharmakosa of its own, and the differences between these versions of the Supreme Doctrine gave rise to fresh controversies. The innovations are sometimes important. We will give but one example: originally, nirval)a was the only thing "uncompounded" (asa'flskrta), but now, with few exceptions, the schools confer the rank of "Uncompounded" on space, the Four Truths, the Way (marga) , pratftya samutpada (conditioned coproduction), or even certain yogic "contemplations." As for the arhat: according to certain schools he can fall, whereas for others even his body is supremely pure; some state that it is possible to become an arhat even in the embryonic state or in dream, but such doctrines are severely criticized by other masters. Still more important by its consequences was the reinterpretation of Buddhology. For the Sthaviravadins, Sakyamuni was a man who made himself the Buddha and therefore became "god." But for other doctors the historicity of Buddha-Sakyamuni was humiliating. On the one hand, how can a great god become
7. A part of it has been preserved only in Tibetan and Chinese translations.



218 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
god? On the other hand, it was necessary to accept a savior who was held to be lost in his nirviifJa. One school, the Lokottara, proclaimed that Sakyamuni, having become a Buddha several cosmic periods earlier, had not left the heaven that he inhabited; he whom men saw born at Kapilavastu, preach, and die was only a phantom (nirmita) created by the real Sakyamuni. This docetistic Buddhology will be taken up again and enlarged by the Mahayana. The Ceylonese Theravadins were not free from schismatic dissidences. But it was especially on the continent that the fragmentation and multiplication of schools continued with ever increasing intensity. Like their opponents, the Sthaviras, the Mahasaqtghikas also underwent divisions, first into three groups, then into a number of sects whose names it would serve no purpose to record. But what is important is the fact that the Mahasaqtghikas inspired, or made possible, a radical renewal of Buddhism, known by the name of the Mahayana, literally the "Great Vehicle."
188. The "Way of the boddhisattvas"
The earliest manifestations of the Mahayana are documented toward the end of the first century B.C.; they are the Prajfiiipiiramitii Siitras ("Sermons on the Perfection of Wisdom"), works of various lengths, rather hard to understand, and introducing a new style into Buddhist thought and literature. The terms Mahayana and Hinayana (literally, "Little Vehicle," applied to the old Buddhism, Theravada) are apparently late. The disciples of the new way called it the "Way of the boddhisattvas. " They are distinguished by their greater tolerance in respect to discipline and by their Buddhology, which is more mystical in structure. Scholars agree in recognizing the influence of lay devotion. The ideal is no longer the solitary arhat in quest of his nirviifJa but the boddhisattva, a lay personage, model of benevolence and compassion, who indefinitely defers his own deliverance in order to help in the salvation of others. This religious hero, who resembles Rama and Kr!jl:ta, does not demand of his disciples the austere way of the monk but personal devotion of

the bhakti type. It must be added, however, that the old Buddhism was not without this type of devotion. According to the Majjhima Nikiiya (1. 142), the Buddha himself had declared that whoever expressed "a simple feeling of faith or affection [in regard to him] will go to paradise."8 But now it is enough to make the resolve to become a Buddha "for the good ofothers," for the Mahayana radically changed the conception of the adept: he no longer aspires to nirvii1]a but to the condition of a Buddha. All the Buddhist schools recognized the importance of the boddhisattvas. But the Mahayanists proclaimed the boddhisattvas' superiority to the arhat; for the latter is not wholly delivered from the "self"; that is why he seeks nirvii1]a for himself alone. According to those who criticize them, the arhats developed wisdom but not enough compassion. In contrast, as the texts of the Prajiiii-piiramitii repeat, the boddhisattvas "do not wish to attain their own private nirvii1]a. On the contrary, they have surveyed the highly painful world of being, and yet, desirous of winning supreme enlightenment, they do not tremble at birthand-death. They have set out for the benefit of the world, for the ease of the world, out of pity for the world. They have resolved: "We will become a shelter for the world, a refuge for the world, the world's place of rest, the final relief of the world, islands of the world, lights of the world, the guides of the world's means of salvation."9 This doctrine of salvation is all the more courageous because the Mahayana elaborated a new and even more radical philosophy, that of "universal emptiness" (sunyatii). Indeed, it is said that two things are necessary for the boddhisattva and his practice of wisdom: "Never to abandon all beings, and to see into the truth that all things are empty."10 It seems paradoxical that at the very moment of triumph of compassion for all beingsnot only human beings but phantoms, animals, plants-the entire world is "emptied" of reality. The old Buddhism had insisted

on the unreality even of the soul (nairiitmya). The Mahayana, while glorifying the boddhisattva's career, proclaims the unreality, the nonexistence in itself, of "things," of the dharmas (dharma sunyatii). Yet this paradox is really not one. The doctrine of universal emptiness, by emptying the universe of reality, makes detachment from the world easier and leads to doing away with the self-the primary goal of the Buddha Sakyamuni and of the old Buddhism. We shall come upon this problem again when we present the sunyatii philosophy. For the moment let us examine the specifically Mahayanic religious creations. For what is characteristic of the Great Vehicle is, on the one hand, the limitless increase of lay devotion and of the soteriological mythologies that it implies and, on the other hand, the prodigious metaphysics, at once visionary and extremely strict, of its masters. These two tendencies are by no means in conflict; I I on the contrary, they complete and influence each other. There are many boddhisattvas, for there have always been saviors who, becoming a Buddha, have taken the vow to put off Awakening for the salvation of all beings. The most important among them are Maitreya, Avalokitesvara, and Maftjusri. The boddhisattva Maitreya (from mailri, "goodness") is the next Buddha, the successor to Sakyamuni. Avalokitesvaral2 is the most famous. He is certainly a more recent creation, typical of the devotion (not only Buddhistic) that begins to be felt in the first centuries of our era. Avalokitesvara appears as a synthesis of the three great gods of Hinduism. He is Lord of the Universe; the sun and moon come from his eyes, the earth comes from his feet, the wind comes from his mouth; he "holds the world in his hand," and "each pore of his skin contains a system of the world"-formulas that are found again in references to Vi~Qu and Siva. Avalokitesvara protects against all kinds of danger and denies no requests, not even the prayer to grant sterile women children. Maftjusri ("Smooth Fortune"), closely connected with

Scholars are in disagreement concerning the meaning of his name: "Lord (iSvara) who looks from on high" (Hurnouf) or "who looks down with compassion" (Conze) seems the most convincing.



The "Way of the boddhisattvas" 221
the Buddha Ak~obhya, personifies wisdom and protects learning. He will enjoy an exalted position in Chinese Buddhism. The boddhisattva Avalokitesvara is mystically connected with the Buddha Amitabha, but the latter did not become popular in India until very late-in the seventh century; before that, his reputation depended on his relations with Avalokitesvara. In contrast, after the eighth century Amitabha will enjoy an extraordinary reputation in Tibet, China, and Japan. It is fitting to present him at this point in the context of Mahayanist devotion, since his mythology and cult represent a surprising innovation. When he was a simple monk, Amitabha vowed to become a Buddha and to acquire a "miraculous land," whose inhabitants, by virtue of his merits, would enjoy unequaled happiness until they entered nirvclfJ,a. This land, Sukhavati ("the Happy"), is situated at an incomprehensible distance in the West; it is bathed in light and resembles a paradise in its jewels and flowers and birds. Its inhabitants are, in fact, immortal; they also feast on Amitabha's word-of-mouth teaching. Such paradises were already known in India. The distinctive feature of Sukhavati consists in the extreme ease with which believers enter it. In fact, it is enough to have heard the name of Amitabha and to have thought of him; at the moment of death the god will descend and will himself lead his disciple into the paradise of Sukhavati. It is the absolute triumph of devotion. However, its doctrinal justification can be found in the earliest Buddhism. In the Chinese version of the Milinda-paiiha, it is said that "men who in one existence have done evil for up to a hundred years, if they think of the Buddha at the moment of death, will all, after their death, obtain being born in the height of heaven." 13 To be sure, the paradise ofSukhavati is not nirVclfJ,a; but those who reach it by virtue of a single thought or a single word are destined to obtain final deliverance in the future without any effort. If we remember the extreme strictness of the Way as preached by the Buddha and the old Buddhism, we can gauge the boldness of this new theology. But obviously it is a mystical and devotional theology, which does not hesitate to apply, in

everyday practice, the metaphysical discoveries of the great masters of Mahayana. Since there is an infinite number of Buddhas, there is an infinite number of "Buddha lands" or "Buddha fields" (bllddha-k~etras). SukhavatI is only one among these countless Buddha lands. They are transcendent universes, created by the merits or the thoughts of the saviors. The Avata11Jsaka declares that they are "as innumerable as particles of dust," coming out of a "thought cherished in the mind of the boddhisattva of mercy." All these Buddha lands "rise from one's own mind and have infinite form."14 The imaginary nature of these universes is constantly emphasized by the texts. The "Buddha fields" are mental constructions, raised in the thoughts of men in order to achieve their conversion. This time, too, the Indian genius has not hesitated to valorize the creative imagination by using it as a means to salvation.
189. Nagarjuna and the doctrine of universal emptiness
These mythological theologies are accompanied by certain new theories, which also arose from the same preoccupation with the need to annihilate egocentric impUlses. The first is the doctrine of the transfer of merit (parif}iima). It seems to contradict the law of karman, yet it continues the old Buddhism's conviction that the example of a bhikkhu striving to become an arhat helps and inspires lay people. But as it is interpreted by the Mahayana, the doctrine of the transfer of merit is a creation typical of the time. Adepts are invited to transfer or dedicate their merits to the illumination of all beings. As Santideva (seventh century) writes in a work that became famous, Bodhicaryiivatiira:
By the merit emanating from all my good deeds, I wish to soothe the suffering of all creatures, to be the physician, the healer, the nurse of the sick as long as there is sickness.... My life with all my rebirths, all my possessions, all the merit that I have acquired or will acquire-all of that I abandon

without hope of gain for myself, so that the salvation of all beings shall be forwarded.l 5
Another new idea reveals that the "Buddha nature" is present in every human being and even in each grain of sand. This is as much as to say that it is our own "Buddha-ness" that forces us to become Buddha. It is an idea bound up with the Upanishadic discovery (the identity atman-brahman) and the Hindu axiom that a man cannot worship divinity except by himself becoming a divinity. The theory will have important developments in the Mahayana, especially in the famous doctrine of the "embryo of Tathagata" (tathagata-garbha). It is also bound up with another original interpretation of the nature of Buddhas: the doctrine of the Buddha's three bodies (trikaya). The first body, that of the Law (dharmakaya), is transcendent, absolute, infinite, eternal; indeed, it is the spiritual body ofthe dharma; that is, it is at once the Law preached by Buddha and absolute reality, pure being. (We may think of the body of Prajapati, constructed-in certain cases-from sacred syllables and magical formulas; see § 77.) The second body, the salflbhogakaya, or "body of enjoyment," is the glorious epiphany of the Buddha, accessible only to boddhisattvas. Finally, the "body of magical creation" (nirmafJ,akaya) is the phantom that men confront on earth and that resembles them, for it is material and ephemeral; but it plays a decisive part, for it is only through this phantom body that human beings are capable of receiving the Law and attaining salvation. As we have observed, the goal of these doctrinal elaborations and mythological constructions that are characteristic of the Mahayana is to make salvation easier for laymen. By accepting and integrating a certain number of Hindu 'elements, whether "popular" (cults, bhakti, etc.) or learned, the Mahayana renewed and enriched the Buddhist heritage, though without thereby betraying it. Indeed, the doctrine of universal emptiness (sunyatavada), elaborated by the genius of Nagarjuna (second century A.D.), was also known by the name "[the doctrine] of the middle," corresponding to the "middle way" preached by Sakyamuni. Certainly, as if to balance the tendency toward "easiness," evident in Mahayanist devotion, the doctrine of
15. Bodhicaryiivatiira 3. 6 fT., after the translation by Finot.



224 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
emptiness (sunyatiiviida) stands out by its philosophical depth and difficulty. NagiiIjuna's Indian adversaries, and some Western scholars, have declared that the sunyatiiviida is a nihilistic philosophy, since it appears to deny the fundamental doctrines of Buddhism. In reality, it is an ont{)logy, paralleled by a soteriology, that seeks to free itself from the illusory structures that are dependent on language; so the sunyatiiviida employs a paradoxical dialectic that ends in the coincidentia oppositorum, which in a way suggests Nicholas of Cusa, an aspect of Hegel, and Wittgenstein. Nagfujuna criticizes and rejects any philosophical system by demonstrating the impossibility of expressing ultimate truth (paramiirthatii) by language. First of all, he points out that there are two kinds of "truths": truths that are conventional or "hidden in the world" ([okasaftlvrti-satya), which have their practical use, and ultimate truth, which alone can lead to deliverance. The Abhidharma, which claims to convey "high learning," really works with conventional knowledge. What is worse, the Abhidharma obscures the way to deliverance with its countless definitions and categories of existences (as, for example, skandhas, dhiitus, etc.), which are basically only products of the imagination. Nagfujuna sets out to liberate, and rightly direct, the mental energies trapped in the net of discourse. From a demonstration of the emptiness, that is, the nonreality, of everything that seems to exist or can be felt, thought, or imagined, several consequences follow. The first is that all the famous formulas of the old Buddhism, as well as their systematic redefinitions by Abhidharma authors, prove to be false. Thus, for example, the three stages of the production of things"origin," "duration," "cessation"-donotexist; and equally nonexistent are the skandhas, the irreducible elements (dhiitus), and desire, the subject of desire, and the situation of the person who desires. They do not exist because they possess no nature of their own. Karman itself is a mental construction, for there is neither "act" nor "actor," properly speaking. Nagarjuna likewise denies the difference between the "world of composites" (saftlskrta) and the "unconditioned" (asaftlskrta). "From the point of view of ultimate truth, the notion of impermanence (anitya) cannot be considered more true than the notion of per



Nagarjuna; the doctrine of universal emptiness 225
manence" (MUlamadhyamaka Kiirikii 23. 13, 14). As for the famous law of "conditioned coproduction" (pratitya-samutpiida), it is useful only from the practical point of view. In reality, "conditioned coproduction-we call it sunya, 'empty' " (ibid., 24. 18). So too, the Four Holy Truths proclaimed by the Buddha have no nature oftheir own: they are merely conventional truths, which can serve only on the plane of language. The second consequence is even more radical: Nagarjuna denies the distinction between "him who is bound" and "the delivered one" and, consequently, the distinction between saftlsiira and nirviifJ,a. "There is nothing that differentiates saftlsiira from nirviifJ,a" (ibid., 25. 19).16 This does not mean that the world (saftlsiira) and deliverance (nirviifJ,a) are "the same thing"; it means only that they are undifferentiated. NirviifJ,a is a "fabrication of the mind." In other words, from the point of view of ultimate truth, the Tathagata himself does not enjoy an autonomous and valid ontological condition. Finally, the third consequence of universal emptiness is the basis for one of the most original ontological creations known to the history of thought. Everything is "empty," without any "nature of its own"; yet it must not be inferred from this that there is an "absolute essence" to which sunyatii (or nirviifJ,a) refers. When it is said that "emptiness," sunyatii, is inexpressible, inc<?nceivable, and indescribable, there is no implication that there is in existence a "transcendent reality" characterized by these attributes. Ultimate truth does not unveil an "absolute" of the Vedanta type; it is the mode of existence discovered by the adept when he obtairis complete indifference toward "things" and their cessation. The "realization," by thought, of universal emptiness is, in fact, equivalent to deliverance. But he who attains nirviifJ,a cannot "know" it, for emptiness transcends both being and nonbeing. Wisdom (prajiiii) reveals ultimate truth by making use of the "truth hidden in the world": the latter is not rejected but is transformed into "truth that does not itself exist." 17
16. Chapter 25 of the Miilamadhyamaka Kiirikii is entirely devoted to analysis of nirviif}a. See Frederick J. Streng, Emptiness, pp. 74 ff. 17. See Streng, p. 96.



226 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
Nagarjuna refuses to consider the silnyatiiviida a "philosophy"; it is a practice, at once dialectical and contemplative, which, by ridding the adept of every theoretical construction not only of the world but of salvation, enables him to obtain imperturbable serenity and freedom. Nagarjuna utterly rejects the idea that his arguments, or any other philosophical affirmation, are valid because of a foundation that exists outside of or beyond language. One cannot say of silnyatii that it exists or that it does not exist or that it exists and at the same time does not exist, etc. To the critics who observe, "Ifall is empty, then Nagarjuna's negation is likewise an empty proposition," he replies that his adversaries' affirmations as well as his negations have no autonomous existence: they exist only on the plane of conventional truth (Millamadh. 24. 29). Buddhism, as well as Indian philosophical thought in general, was changed profoundly after Nagarjuna, though the change was not immediately evident. Nagarjuna carried to the extreme limit the innate tendency of the Indian spirit toward the coincidentia oppositorum. Nevertheless, he succeeded in showing that the career of the boddhisattva retains all its greatness despite the fact that "all is empty." And the ideal of the boddhisattva continued to inspire charity and altruism, although, as the Avata1flsaka expresses it, "though dwelling in nirviilJa, he manifests the sa1flsiira. He knows that there are no beings, but he tries to convert them. He is definitively pacified (siinta), but he appears to experience passions (klesas). He inhabits the Body of the Law (dharmakiiya), but he manifests himself everywhere, in countless bodies of living beings. He is always deep in profound ecstasies (dhyiinas) , but he enjoys the objects of desire."18

sayings to his disciple Jambii. So they are the last of the "omniscient ones" (kevalins), for only they knew the whole of the sacred texts. We know the names of the sthaviras who succeeded Jambii. The most important of them is a third-century figure, Bhadrabahu, a contemporary of King Chandragupta (Bhadrabahu died in 270 or 262 B.C). It was he who established the Jaina canon and even composed several works himself. But he also witnessed, and was probably one of the causes for, the crisis that led to the division of the Jaina church. According to tradition, Bhadrabahu, foreseeing a twelve-yearfamine, emigrated into the Deccan with part of the community. He charged his disciple Sthiilabhadra to look after those who did not emigrate. Some years later a council was summoned at Pataliputra for the purpose of collecting all the sacred texts, which until then had been transmitted by word of mouth. Bhadrabahu was on his way to Nepal. Emissaries were sent to him so that he could recite to them certain old texts that he alone knew. But the emissaries listened carelessly and managed to remember only fragments of these treatises that preserved the original doctrine. Only Sthiilabhadra memorized ten works out of a total of fourteen. This episode, which is probably legendary, wi111ater justify the differences between the two canons. When the emigrants, maintaining their practice of nUdity, returned to Magadha, they were shocked by the laxity of the monks who had remained there. The tension continued for several generations, aggravated by controversies over certain details of ritual and by doctrinal differences. Finally, in 77 B.C., a split became inevitable, and the community divided into 8vetambaras, the "white-clad," and Digambaras, those "clad in space." The latter denied deliverance to those who did not observe total nakedness (hence they also denied it to women). In addition, they rejected certain elements in Mahavira's biography (for example, that he was married), and, because they held that the ancient texts were lost, the "space-clad" monks questioned the authenticity of the canon established by the 8vetambaras. A second council was held at Valabhi, in the second half of the fifth century; it was organized by the 8vetambaras to establish the definitive version of the sacred texts.



228 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
We will not discuss the different categories of works that make up the immense body of Jaina canonical literature. As for the postcanonical texts, they are many. 19 Unlike Buddhism, Jainism preserved its original structures. In its extensive philosophical and ritual literature we find few new and creative ideas. The most famous treatises, such as the Pravacanasiira by KUQQakunda (first century A.D.) and Tattviirtha by Umasvati (undated, but later than KUQQakunda's work), are essentially nothing but scholastic systematizations of the conceptions that Mahavira or his immediate successors had already formulated. 20 , The doctrine is also a soteriology. It is concentrated in the "Three Jewels" of Jainism: Right Seeing, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct. This last is realized only by monastic discipline. Four kinds of" Right Seeing" are distinguished, the first of which is merely visual, whereas the last constitutes an unlimited transcendental perception. We shall not analyze the five kinds of "Right Knowledge." We will merely mention two theses that are typical of Jaina logic: the "doctrine of points of view" (nayaviida) and the "doctrine of can be" (syiid-viida). The first maintains that, in regard to anything at all, various complementary affirmations may be made. True from a certain point of view, an assertion is no longer true if it is looked at from a different viewpoint, but it remains compatible with the total tenor of the statements. The doctrine of "can be" (syiid) implies the relativity or the ambiguity of the real. It is also called the "rule with seven divisions," because it comprises seven forms of affirmations: (1) something can be such; (2) something can be not such; (3) something can be such or can be not such; etc. The doctrine was
19. Side by side with philosophical treatises, we find epics (adapted from the Hindu epics and the Pura1).as), legendary biographies of the Tirthaqtkaras, and even tales, romances, and dramas, to say nothing of didactic and scientific literature. Except for the narrative literature (which itself is not without a tiresome didacticism), the immense Jainaproduction is characterized by monotony and aridity. 20. This type of conservatism is typical of traditional India and, in itself, does not constitute a negative characteristic. But the Jaina writings are unusual in their heavy, arid texture.



lainism after Mahiivlra 229
condemned by the other Indian philosophical schools.21 Nevertheless, these two logical methods constitute one of the most original creations of Jaina thought. Analyses of matter, of the soul, of time and space (these last two categories were regarded as "substances"), of "karmic matter," etc., were elaborated and systematized, with a multiplication of classifications and enumerations. A characteristic feature, perhaps borrowed by Mahavira from Makkhali Gosala, is the belief that acts mark the soul like a dye (lesya) and that these colors also impregnate bodies. Thus the soul's merit or demerit is expressed by the six colors of bodies; black, blueblack, and gray are characteristic ofthe inhabitants ofthe infernal regions, while yellow, pink, and white designate beings who live on earth-pure and intense white belonging only to those who rise toward the summit of the universe. This is certainly an archaic conception, bound up with certain yogic practices. In fact, in the classification of beings in accordance with their spiritual qualifications, the eighth stage, when the "first contemplative withdrawal of the soul into its pure essence" is accomplished, is also called the "first white contemplation." The equivalence color/spiritual stage is also found in other Indian traditions and elsewhere as well. Like nature (prakrti) in the Salpkhya-Yoga conception, matter is spontaneously and unconsciously organized in order to serve the soul. Although eternal and without beginning, the universe exists in order that souls may deliver themselves from its structures. But, as we shall see in a moment, deliverance does not imply total and definitive escape from the cosmos. The originality of the Jaina cosmology lies precisely in its archaism. It has preserved and revalorized traditional Indian conceptions overlooked by Hindu and Buddhist cosmologies. The cosmos (loka) is represented in the form of a man standing with his arms bent and his fists on his hips. This macranthrope is made up of a lower world (the lower members), a median world (the region of the waist), and an upper world (the chest and head). A vertical tube

230 HISTORY OF BUDDHISM AND JAINISM
traverses the three cosmic regions after the fashion of the axis mundi. The lower world comprises seven superimposed "earths" (bhumis), each having a different color, from the most opaque black to the light produced by the brightness of sixteen kinds of precious stones. The upper zones of the first "earth" are inhabited by eighteen categories of divinities. The six other "earths" constitute true hells, of which there are 8,400,000, peopled by different classes of the damned, who are colored gray, blueblack, and black. Their deformed bodies, the torments inflicted on them in fiery or icy hells, are reminiscent of the traditional cliches. Those guilty of unforgivable crimes are shut up for all eternity in the most terrifying infernal abyss, nigroda, which lies at the feet of the macranthrope. This image of an anthropomorphic universe, whose various zones-identified with the organs of the cosmic man-are inhabited by beings of different colors, is archaic. Nowhere else in India has it been better preserved and more aptly harmonized with the experiences of "mystical light" than in lainism. The middle world corresponds in general to the world described by the Hindu and Buddhist cosmologies.22 The upper world, situated above Mount Meru, is divided into five superimposed zones, corresponding to the macranthrope's ribs, neck, chin, five facial openings, and topknot. Each zone in turn comprises several "paradises" inhabited by various types of divinities. As for the fifth zone, the summit of the universe and topknot of the macranthrope, it is reserved for liberated souls. This is as much as to say that he who is delivered does not transcend the cosmos (as is the case with the Buddhist nirvGfJa) but only its many ascending levels. The liberated soul enjoys inexpressible and eternal bliss in the siddha-k~etra, the "field of the perfect," in company with his peers but within the macranthropic universe.
22. It has the shape of a disk, with, at its center, Mount Meru, whose base reaches down into the infernal regions. Around this cosmic mountain there are fifteen concentric continents (called "islands," dvipas), separated by circular oceans. The central continent, Jambudvipa, is divided into seven transverse zones by Bharatavar~a (India). The other island-continents are "lands of enjoyments" (bhoga-bhumis), for their inhabitants need not work in order to live. They are also the home of the stellar divinities.



lainism after Mahiivira 231
As early as in Bhadrabahu's time lainism made its way into Bengal and Orissa. Later the Digambaras established themselves in the Deccan, and the Svetambaras moved westward, settling especially in the Gujarat. The traditions of the two churches delighted in counting among their converts or sympathizers a large number of kings and princes. Like all the other Indian religions, lainism underwent persecution by the Muslims (pillage, destruction of temples, prohibition of nudity). It also became the target of the Hindu counteroffensive, and, from the twelfth century on, its decline was irreversible. Unlike Buddhism, lainism never became a popular and dominant religion in India, and it did not spread beyond the frontiers of the subcontinent. But whereas Buddhism has completely disappeared from its country of origin, the laina community still has 1,500,000 members today, and, because oftheir social position and cultural distinction, its influence is considerable.



24 The Hindu Synthesis:
The Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita
191. The eighteen-day battle
With its 90,000 verses, the Mahiibhiirata is the longest epic in world literature. As it has come down to us, the text includes visions and numerous interpolations, the latter chiefly in the "encyclopedic" sections (books 12 and 13). However, it would be illusory to believe that we could reconstruct the "original form" of the poem. As to its date, "the idea makes no sense for the epic" (L. RenOli). It is assumed that the epic poem was already finished between the seventh and sixth centuries before our era and acquired its present form between the fourth century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. (Winternitz). Its principal theme is the conflict between the two lines of Bharatas: the descendants of the Kurus (the one hundred Kauravas) and the descendants of the PaI,lQus (the five paI,lQavas). Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, son of the blind king Dhrtara~tra, is devoured by a demonic hate for his cousins; as a matter of fact, he is the incarnation of the demon Kali, that is, the demon of the most evil age of the world. The five PaI,lQavasYudhi~tira, Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva-are the sons of PaI,lQu, younger brother of Dhrtara~tra. Actually, they are the sons of the gods Dharma, Vayu, Indra, and the two Asvins, and we shall later perceive the meaning of this divine parentage. On PaI,lQu's death, Dhrtara~tra becomes king for the period before Yudhi~thira grows old enough to take power. But Duryodhana does not resign himself. Among the traps that he set for his cousins, the most dangerous was the burning of a lacquer house in which he had persuaded them to live. The PaI,lQavas escape

by an underground passage and, with their mother, take refuge in the forest, incognito. A number of adventures follow. Disguised as a Brahman, Arjuna succeeds in obtaining the hand of Princess Draupadi, incarnation of the goddess Sri, and takes her to the Pal).<.iavas' hermitage in the forest. Not seeing Draupadi, and believing that Arjuna is bringing only the food he had obtained as alms, his mother exclaims: "Enjoy this together." Thus the young woman becomes the common wife ofthe five brothers. Learning that the PaQ,<.iavas did not die in the fire, the blind king Dhrtara~tra decides to let them have half of the kingdom. They build a capital, Indraprastha, where their cousin Kf~Q,a, head of the Yadava clan, joins them. Duryodhana challenges Yudhi~thira to a game of dice. One of the dice being false, Yudhi~thira successively loses his possessions, his kingdom, his brothers, and their wife. The king annuls the game and restores their possessions to the PaQ,<.iavas. But soon afterward he permits a second game of dice; it is agreed that the losers shall live for twelve years in the forest and a thirteenth year incognito. Yudhi~thira plays, loses again, and goes into exile with his brothers and Draupadi. The third book, Vana-parvan ("Book of the Forest"), which, with its 17,500 couplets, is the longest, is also the richest in literary episodes: the hermits tell the PaQ,<.iavas the dramatic stories of Nala and Damayanti, Savitri, Rama, and Sita. The following book describes the adventures of the thirteenth year, which the exiles succeed in spending without being recognized. In the fifth book ("Book of Preparations"), war seems inevitable. The pal).<.iavas send Kf~Q,a as ambassador; they demand the restoration of their kingdom, or at least of five villages, but Duryodhana refuses. Immense armies gather on either side, and war breaks out. The sixth book contains the most famous episode in the epicthe Bhagavad Gila, which we shall discuss further on. In the following books the various moments of the battle, which rages for eighteen days, are laboriously narrated. The ground is covered with the dead and wounded. The leaders of the Kurus fall one after the other, Duryodhana the last. Only three Kauravas escape, among them Asvatthaman, into whom the god Siva had just entered. With a horde of demons produced by Siva, Asvatthaman makes his way into the sleeping Pal).<.iavas' camp

by night and butchers them, except the five brothers, who were away. Saddened by so much killing, Yudhi~thira wants to renounce the throne and live as a hermit; but his brothers, helped by Kr~J;ta and several sages, are able to make him abandon his decision, and he regally performs the horse sacrifice (the asvamedha; see § 73). After collaborating with his nephew for fifteen years, Dhrtara~ta retires to the forest with a few companions. Not long afterward, they are killed in a conflagration started by their own sacred fires. Thirty-six years after the great battle, Kr~l}a and his people perish in a strange way: they kill one another with reeds magically transformed into maces. The capital crumbles and disappears into the ocean. Feeling that he is growing old, Yudhi~thira leaves power to his grandnephew Parik~it (who, stillborn, was resuscitated by Kr~l}a), and, with his brothers, Draupada, and a dog, sets out for the Himalayas. One after the other, his companions fall on the journey. Only Yudhi~thira and the dog (which is really his own father, Dharma) hold out to the end. The epic concludes with a short description of Yudhi~thira descending to the underworld and then ascending to heaven.
192. Eschatological war and the end of the world
This monstrous war was decided on by Brahma, in order to relieve the earth of a population that did not cease to mUltiply. Brahma asked a certain number of gods and demons to become incarnate in order to provoke a terrifying war of extermination. The Mahiibhiirata describes the end of a world (pralaya), followed by the emergence of a new world under the reign of Yudhi~thira or Parik~it. I The poem shows an eschatological structure: a gigantic battle between the forces of "good" and "evil" (analogous to the combats between devas and asuras); destruction on a cosmic scale by fire and water; resurgence of a new and pure world, symbolized by the miraculous resurrection of Pa

Eschatological war and the end of the world 235
rik~it. In a certain sense we may speak of a grandiose revalorization of the old mythico-ritual scenario of the New Year. However, this time it is not a matter of the end of a year but of the conclusion of a cosmic age. The cyclical theory becomes popular from the time of the PuraQ.as. This does not mean that the eschatological myth is necessarily a creation of Hinduism. The conception of it is archaic and enjoys 'a considerable dissemination. What is more, similar myths are documented in Iran and Scandanavia. According to Zoroastrian tradition, at the end of history Ohrmazd will seize Ahriman, the six Amesa Spentas will each lay hold of an archdemon, and these incarnations of evil will be definitively cast into darkness (see § 216). As we have seen (§ 177), a similar eschatology is found among the ancient Germans: in the course of the final battle (the Ragnarok), each god will take on a demonic being or a monster, with the difference that the gods and their adversaries will kill one another down to the last of them and the earth will burn and finally be plunged into the sea; however, the earth will rise again from the aquatic mass, and a new humanity will enjoy a happy existence under the reign of the young god Baldr. Stig Wikander and Georges Dumezil have brilliantly analyzed the structural analogies among these three eschatological wars. It may thus be concluded that the myth of the end of the world was known by the Indo-Europeans. The divergences are certainly marked, but they can be explained by the different orientations characteristic of the three Indo-European religions. It is true that the eschatological myth is not documented in the Vedic period, but this does not prove that it did not exist.2 As Dumezil expresses it (My the et epopee, vol. 1, pp. 218 ff.), the Mahiibhiirata is the "epic transposition of an eschatological crisis," of what Hindu mythology calls the end of a yuga. Now the Mahiibhiirata contains certain Vedic, or even pre-Vedic, ele

236 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
ments.3 So it is permissible to put the myth of the end of an age among these archaic Aryan traditions, and the more so because it was known by the Iranians. But we must immediately add that the poem represents a grandiose synthesis, decidedly richer than the Indo-European eschatological tradition that it continues. In describing the annihilation of the limitless human masses and the telluric catastrophes that follow, the Mahiibhiirata borrows the flamboyant language of the Puriil).as. More important are the theological developments and innovations. The "messianic" idea of the avatiira is set forth forcefully and rigorously. In the famous theophany of the Bhagavad Gltii (11. 12 ff.) Kr~l).a reveals himself to Arjuna as an incarnation of Vi~l).u. As has been observed,4 this theophany also constitutes a pralaya, which in some way anticipates the "end of the world" described in the last books of the epic. Now the revelation of (Kr~l).a-)Vi~l).u as lord of the pralaya is pregnant with theological and metaphysical consequences. Indeed, behind the dramatic events that make up the plot ofthe Mahiibhiirata, it is possible to decipher the opposition and complementarity of Vi~l).u(-Kr~l).a) and Siva. The latter's "destructive" function is counterbalanced by the "creative" role of Vi~l).u(-Kr~l).a). When one of these gods-or one of their representatives-is present in an action, the other is absent. But Vi~l).u(-Kr~l).a) is also the author of "destructions" and "resurrections." In addition, the epic and the Puriil).as emphasize this god's negative aspect.5
3. Stig Wikander has observed that the fathers of the five Pal}'.iavasDharma, Viiyu, Indra, and the Twins-correspond to the trifunctional list of the Vedic gods: Mitra-Varul}a (= Dharma), Indra (= Viiyu and Indra), and the Asvins. This list does not reflect the religious situation at the time when the poem was finished (a period dominated by Vi~l}u and Siva), nor that of Vedic days, when Soma and Agni played important parts. It follows that the Mahiibhiirata presents a para-Vedic and pre-Vedic state ofthings (see Dumezil, Mythe et epopee, vol. 1, pp. 42 ff.).
4. See M. Biardeau, "Etudes de mythologie hindoue" (1971), p. 54. 5. In the Puriil}as, Vi~l}u is often described as savage, dangerous, irresponsible, "mad"; in contrast, Siva is more than once presented as he who is able to pacify him. See the texts cited by David Kinsley, "Through the Looking Glass," pp. 276 ff.



Eschatological war and the end of the world 237
This is as much as to say that Vi~Qu, as supreme being, is the ultimate reality; hence he governs both the creation and the destruction of worlds. He is beyond good and evil, like all the gods. For "virtue and sin exist, 0 King, only among men" (12. 238. 28). Among yogins and contemplatives the idea had been familiar from the time of the Upanishads, but the Mahabharata-particularly, the Bhagavad Gita-makes it accessible, and therefore popular, on all levels of Indian society. While glorifying Vi~Qu as the Supreme Being, the poem emphasizes the complementarity of Siva and Vi~Qu.6 From this point of view, the Mahiibhiirata can be considered the cornerstone of Hinduism. Indeed, these two gods, together with the Great Goddess (Sakti, Kali, Durga), have dominated Hinduism from the first centuries of our era to the present. The complementarity Siva-Vi~Qu in a way corresponds to the complementarity of antagonistic functions that is characteristic of the great gods (creativity/destruction, etc.). Understanding this structure of divinity is equivalent to a revelation and also constitutes the model to follow in obtaining deliverance. Indeed, the Mahiibhiirata describes and glorifies, on the one hand, the struggle between good and evil, dharma and adharma, a struggle that acquires the weight of a universal norm, for it governs cosmic life, society, and personal existence; on the other hand, however, the poem is a reminder that the ultimate reality-the brahman-iitman of the Upanishads-is beyond the pair dharma/ adharma and every other pair of contraries. In other words, deliverance involves comprehension of the relations between the two "modes" of the real: immediate-that is, historically conditioned-reality and ultimate reality. Upanishadic monism had denied the validity of immediate reality. The Mahiibhiirata, especially in its didactic sections, proposes a broader doctrine: on the one hand, Upanishadic monism, colored by theistic (Vai~Qava) experiences, is reaffirmed; on the other hand, there is acceptance of any soteriological solution that is not explicitly contrary to the scriptural tradition.
6. For the different aspects of this complementarity. see J. Gonda. Vi~1Juism and Sivaism, pp. 87 ff.



238 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
193. K!~l}a's revelation
At first sight it may appear paradoxical that the literary work that depicts a frightful war of extermination and the end of a yuga is at the same time the exemplary model for every spiritual synthesis accomplished by Hinduism. The tendency to reconcile contraries is characteristic of Indian thought from the period of the Brahmal)as, but it is in the Mahabharata that we see the importance of its results. Essentially, we can say that the poem? (1) teaches the equivalence of Vedanta (i.e., the doctrine of the Upanishads), Sarp.khya, and Yoga; (2) establishes the equality of the three "ways" (margas), represented by ritual activity, metaphysical knowledge, and Yoga practice; (3) makes every effort to justify a certain mode of existing in time, in other words, assumes and valorizes the historicity of the human condition; and (4) proclaims the superiority of a fourth soteriological "way": devotion to Vi~l)u(-Kr~l)a). The poem presents Sarp.khya and Yoga in their presystematic stages. The former means "true knowledge" (taUva-jfzana) or "knowledge of the Self" (atman-bodha); in this respect, Sarp.khya carries on Upanishadic speculation. Yoga designates any activity that leads the Self to brahman at the same time that it confers countless "powers." Most often, this activity is equivalent to asceticism. The term yoga sometimes means "method," sometimes "force" or "meditation."8 The two darsanas are regarded as equivalent. According to the Bhagavad Gfta, "only narrow minds oppose Sarp.khya and Yoga, but not the wise (paf)cjitas). He who is truly master of the one is assured of the fruit of both.... Sarp.khya and Yoga are but one" (5. 4-5). It is also in the Bhagavad Gfta that the homology of the three soteriological "ways" is strictly demonstrated. This celebrated episode begins with AIjuna's "existential crisis" and ends with an exemplary revelation concerning the human condition and the "ways" of deliverance. Seeing him depressed by the war, in which he will have to kill friends and his own cousins, Kr~l)a reveals to AIjuna the means of doing his duty as a k~atriya

Kt:~1Ja' s revelation 239
without letting himself be bound by karma. Generally speaking, Kp~l:la'S revelations concern (1) the structure of the universe, (2) the modalities of Being, and (3) the ways to obtain final deliverance. But Kr~l).a takes care to add that the "ancient Yoga" (4. 3), which is the "supreme secret," is not an innovation; he had already taught it to Vivasvant, who revealed it to Manu, and Manu transmitted it to Ik~vaku (4. 1). "It is by this tradition that the r.ri-kings knew it; but, with time, this Yoga disappeared here below" (4. 2). Every time that order (dharma) is shaken, Kr~l).a manifests himself (4. 7), that is, he reveals, in a manner suited to the given "historical moment," this timeless wisdom. (This is the doctrine of the avatara.) In other words, if the Bhagavad Gfta appears historically as a new spiritual synthesis, it seems "new" only to the eyes of beings who, like ourselves, are conditioned by time and history.9 It could be said that the essence of the doctrine revealed by Kr~l).a lies in this brief admonition: Believe me and imitate me! For all that he reveals concerning his own being and concerning his "behavior" in the cosmos and in history is to serve as exemplary model for AIjuna: Arjuna finds the meaning of his historical life and, in conjunction with it, obtains deliverance by understanding what Kr~l).a is and what he does. Moreover, Kr~l).a himself insists on the exemplary and soteriological value of the divine model: "whatever the Chief does, other men imitate: the rule he follows, the world obeys" (3. 21). And he adds, referring to himself: "In the three worlds, there is nothing that I am obliged to do ... yet I remain in action" (3. 23). Kr~l).a hastens to reveal the deep meaning of this activity: "If I were not always tirelessly in action, everywhere, men would follow my example. The
9. This is not without its bearing on all Western interpretations of Indian spirituality; for, if we have the right.to reconstruct the history of Indian doctrines and techniques and to attempt to define their innovations, their developments, and their successive modifications, we must not forget that, from the Indian point of view, the historical context of a "revelation" has only a limited bearing: the "appearance" or "disappearance" of a soteriological formula on the plane of history can teach us nothing concerning its "origin." According to Indian tradition, so strongly reaffirmed by Kf~l)a, the various "historical moments"-which are at the same time moments of cosmic becoming-do not create doctrine but merely bring to birth appropriate formulas for the timeless message. See Eliade, Yoga, pp. 155 ff.



240 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
worlds would cease to exist if I did not perform my work; I should be the cause of universal confusion and the end of creatures" (3. 23-24 [after the translation by E. SenartD. Consequently, AIjuna must imitate Kr~Q.a's behavior: that is, in the first place, to continue acting, so that his passivity shall not contribute to "universal confusion." But in order for him to act "as Kr~Q.a does," he must understand both the essence of divinity and its modes of manifestation. This is why Kr~Q.a reveals himself: by knowing God, man at the same time knows the model to imitate. Now Kr~Q.a begins by revealing that Being and nonbeing reside in him and that the whole of creation-from the gods to minerals-descends from him (7. 4-6; 9. 4-5; etc.). He continually creates the world by means of his prakrti, but this ceaseless activity does not bind him: he is only the spectator of his own creation (9. 8-10). Now it is precisely this (seemingly paradoxical) valorization of activity (of karman) that is the chief lesson revealed by Kr~Q.a: in imitation of God, who creates .and sustains the world without participating in it, man willleam to do likewise. "It is not enough to abstain from action in order to free oneself from the act; inaction alone does not lead to perfection," for "everyone is condemned to action" (3. 4-5). Even if he abstains from acting in the strict sense of the word, a whole unconscious activity, caused by the gUfJas (3. 5), continues to chain him and integrate him into the karmic circuit. (The gUfJas are the three modes of being which impregnate the whole universe and establish an organic sympathy between man and the cosmos.) Condemned to action-for "action is superior to inaction" (3. 8)-man must perform the prescribed acts-in other words, the "duties," the acts that fall to him because of his particular situation. "It is better to perform, even if imperfectly, one's own duty (svadharma) than to perform, even perfectly, the duty of a different condition (paradharma)" (3. 35). These specific activities are conditioned by the gUfJas (17.8 ff.; 18.23 ff.). Kr~Q.a repeats on several occasions that the gUfJas proceed from him but do not bind him: "not that I am in them; it is they that are in me" (7. 12). The lesson to be drawn from this is the following: while accepting the "historical situation" created by the gUfJas (and one must accept it, for the gUfJas, too, derive from Kr~Q.a)



"Renouncing the fruits of one's acts" 241
and acting in accordance with the necessities of that "situation," man must refuse to valorize his acts and, in consequence, to attribute an absolute value to his own condition.
194. "Renouncing the fruits of one's acts"
In this sense it can be said that the Bhagavad Gita attempts to "save" all human acts, to "justify" every profane action; for, by the mere fact that he no longer enjoys their "fruits," man transforms his acts into sacrifices, that is, into transpersonal dynamisms that contribute to the maintenance of the cosmic order. Now, as Kf~l)a declares, only acts whose object is sacrifice do not bind (3. 9). Prajapati created sacrifice so that the cosmos could manifest itself and human beings could live and propagate (3. 10 ff.). But Kf~l)a reveals that man, too, can collaborate in the perfection of the divine work, not only by sacrifices properly speaking (those that make up the Vedic cult) but by all his acts, whatever their nature. When the various ascetics and yogins "sacrifice" their psychophysiological activities, they detach themselves from these activities, they give them a transpersonal value (4. 25 ff.), and, in so doing, they "all have the true idea of sacrifice and, by sacrifice, wipe out their impurities" (4. 30). This transmutation of profane activities into rituals is made possible by Yoga. Kf~l)a reveals to AIjuna that the "man of action"IO can save himself (in other words, escape the consequences of his taking part in the life ofthe world) and yet continue to act. The only thing that he must do is this: he must detach himself from his acts and from their results, in other words, "renounce the fruits of his acts" (phalatr~fJavairagya); he must act impersonally, without passion, without desire, as if he were acting by proxy, in another's stead. If he strictly obeys this rule, his actions will not sow the seeds of new karmic potentialities or any longer enslave him to the karmic circuit. "Indifferent to the fruit of action, always satisfied, free from all ties, no matter how active he may be, in reality he does not act" (4. 20).
10. The "man of action" is he who cannot retire from civil life in order to gain his salvation through knowledge, asceticism, or mystical devotion.



242 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
The great originality of the Bhagavad Glta is its having insisted on this "Yoga of action," which one realizes by "renouncing the fruits of one's acts." This is also the principal reason for its unprecedented success in India. For henceforth every man is allowed to hope for deliverance, by virtue ofphalatr~f}avairagya, even when, for reasons of very different kinds, he is obliged to continue to take part in social life, to have a family, to be concerned, to hold a position, even to do "immoral" things (like Arjuna, who must kill his enemies in war). To act placidly, without being moved by "desire for the fruit," is to obtain a selfmastery and a serenity that, undoubtedly, Yoga alone is able to confer. As Kr~lJ.a teaches: "While acting without restriction, one remains·faithful to Yoga." This interpretation of the Yoga technique is characteristic of the grandiose synthetic effort of the Bhagavad Glta, which sought to reconcile all vocations: whether ascetic, mystic, or devoted to activity in the world. In addition to the Yoga that is accessible to everyone and consists in renouncing the "fruits of one's acts," the Bhagavad Glta briefly expounds a yogic technique properly speaking, which is restricted to contemplatives (6. II ff.). Kr~I.la decrees that "Yoga is superior to asceticism (tapas), even superior to knowledge (jiiana), superior to sacrifice" (6. 46). But yogic meditation does not attain its ultimate end unless the disciple concentrates on God: "With soul serene and fearless ... , mind firm and ce~selessly thinking of Me, he must practice Yoga taking Me as his supreme end" (6. 14). "He who sees Me everywhere and sees all things in Me, him I never abandon, and he never abandons Me. He who, having established himself in unity, worships Me, who dwell in all beings, that yogin dwells in Me, whatever be his way of life" (6. 30-31; our italics).
This is at once the triumph of Yoga practices and the raising of mystical devotion (bhakti) to the rank of supreme "way." In addition, the Bhagavad Glta marks the appearance of the concept of grace, foretelling the luxuriant development that it will attain in medieval Vai~lJ.ava literature. But the decisive part that the Bhagavad Glta played in the expansion of theism does not exhaust its importance. That incomparable work, keystone of Indian spirituality, can be valorized in many and various contexts. By the fact that it puts the emphasis on the historicity of



"Separation" and "totalization" 243
man, the solution that the Gltii offers is certainly the most comprehensive one and, it is important to add, the one best suited to modem India, already integrated into the "circuit of history." For, translated into terms familiar to Westerners, the problem faced in the Gltii is as follows: how is it possible to resolve the paradoxical situation created by the twofold fact that man, on the one hand, finds himself existing in time, condemned to history, and, on the other hand, knows that he will be "damned" if he allows himself to be exhausted by temporality and by his own historicity and that, consequently, he must at all costs find in the world a way that leads into a transhistorical and atemporal plane? We have seen the solution offered by Kr~l:ta: doing one's duty (svadharma) in the world but doing so without letting oneself be prompted by desire for the fruits of one's actions (phalatr~1Javairiigya). Since the whole universe is the creation, or even the epiphany, of Kr~l}.a(-Vi~l}.u), to live in the world, to participate in its structures, does not constitute an "evil act." The "evil act" is to believe that the world and time and history possess an independent reality of their own, that is, to believe that nothing else exists outside of the world and temporality. The idea is certainly pan-Indian, but it is in the Bhagavad Gltii that it received its most consistent expression.
195. "Separation" and "totaliz~tion"
To realize the importance of the part played by the Bhagavad Gitii in the religious history of India, we must remember the solutions offered by SaqIkhya, by Yoga, and by Buddhism. According to these schools, deliverance demanded, as a sine qua non, detachment from the world or even the negation of human life as a mode of existing in history. II The discovery of "universal
11. To be sure, the "classical" stage of the Sal1lkhya and Yoga darsanas is several centuries later than the composition of the Bhagavad Gila. But their characteristic tendencies-especially the methods they elaborated for separating the spirit from psychomental experience-are already documented in the period of the Upanishads.



244 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
suffering" and the infinite cycle of reincarnations 12 had oriented the search for salvation in a particular direction: deliverance must involve refusal to yield to the impulses of life and to the social norms. Withdrawal into solitude and ascetic practices constituted the indispensable preliminaries. On the other hand, salvation by gnosis was compared to an "awakening," a "freeing from bonds," the "removal ofa blindfold that covered the eyes," etc. (see § 136). In short, salvation presupposed a break, a dislocation from the world, which was a place of suffering, a prison crowded with slaves. The religious devalorization of the world was made easier by the disappearance of the creator god. For Sarpkhya-Yoga, the universe came into being by virtue of the "teleological instinct" of the primordial substance (prakrti). For the Buddha, the problem does not even arise; in any case, Buddha denies the existence of God. The religious devalorization of the world is accompanied by a glorification of the spirit or the Self (titman, puru~a). For Buddha himself, though he rejects the titman as autonomous and irreducible monad, deliverance is obtained by virtue of an effort that is "spiritual" in nature. The progressive hardening of the dualism spirit/matter is reminiscent of the development of religious dualism, ending in the Iranian formula of two contrary principles, representing good and evil. As we have observed more than once, for a long time the opposition good/evil was but one of many examples of dyads and polarities-cosmic, social, and religious-that insured the rhythmical alternation of life and the world. In short, what was isolated in the two antagonistic principles, good and evil, was in the beginning only one among the many formulas by means of which the antithetical but complementary aspects of reality were expressed: day/night, male/female, life/death, fecundity/ sterility, health/sickness, etc.13 In other words, good and evil formed part of the same cosmic (and therefore human) rhythm that Chinese thought formulated in the alternation of the two principles yang and yin (§ 130).
12. It must be borne in mind that the fatality of transmigration made suicide unavailing.

..Separation" and"totalization" 245
The devalorization of the cosmos and life, adumbrated in the Upanishads, finds its most rigorous expressions in the "dualistic" ontologies and the methods of separation elaborated by Sarpkhya-Yoga and Buddhism. The hardening process characteristic of these stages of Indian religious thought can be compared with the hardening of Iranian dualism from Zarathustra to Manichaeanism. Zarathustra likewise considered the world a mixture of the spiritual and material. The believer, by correctly performing the sacrifice, separated his celestial essence (menok) from its material manifestation (getik).14 For Zarathustra and for Mazdaism, however, the universe was the work of Ahura Mazda; the world was corrupted only later, by Ahriman. But Manichaeanism and a number of Gnostic sects on the contrary attributed the Creation to the demonic powers. The world, life, and man himself are the product of a series of sinister or criminal dramatic activities. In the last analysis, this vain and monstrous creation is doomed to annihilation. Deliverance is the result of a long and difficult effort to separate spirit from matter, light from the darkening that holds it captive. To be sure, the various Indian methods and techniques of seeking deliverance of the spirit by a series of more and more radical •'separations" continued to have proselytes long after the appearance of the Bhagavad Gila. For refusal of life-and especially of existence conditioned by sociopolitical structures and by history-had, after the Upanishads, become a highly regarded soteriological solution. Nevertheless, the Gila had succeeded in integrating into a daring synthesis all the Indian religious orientations, hence also the ascetic practices involving abandoning the community and social obligations. But above all the Gila had effected the resacralization of the cosmos, of universallife, and even of man's historical existence. As we have just seen, Vi~Qu-Kr~Qa is not only the creator and lord of the world, he resanctifies the whole of nature by his presence. On the other hand, it is still Vi~Qu who periodically destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. In other words, all is created and governed by God. In consequence, the "neg

246 THE HINDU SYNTHESIS
ative aspects" of cosmic life, of individual existence, and of history receive a religious meaning. Man is no longer the hostage of a cosmos-prison that created itself, since the world is the work of a personal and omnipotent God. What is more: he is a God who did not abandon the world after its creation but continues to be present in it and active on all planes, from the material structures of the cosmos to the consciousness of man. Cosmic calamities and historical catastrophes, even the periodical destruction of the universe, are governed by Vi~I}u-Kr~I}a; hence they are theophanies. This brings the God of the Bhagavad GUo close to Yahweh, creator of the world and lord of history, as the prophets understood him (see § 121). In any case, it is not without interest to point out that, just as the revelation advocated by the GUo took place during a horrible war of extermination, the prophets preached under the "terror of history," under tli.e threat of the imminent disappearance of the Jewish people. The tendency to totalization of the real that is characteristic of Indian thought finds in the Bhagavad GUo one of its most convincing expressions. Accomplished under the sign of a personal God, this totalization confers a religious value even on undeniable manifestations of "evil" and "misfortune," such as war, treachery, and murder. IS But it is above all the resacralization of life and of human existence that had important consequences in the religious history of India. In the first centuries of our era, Tantrism will similarly attempt to transmute the organic functions (alimentation, sexuality, etc.) into sacraments. However, this type of sacralization of the body and life will be obtained by an extremely complex and difficult yogic technique; in fact, Tantric initiation will be restricted to an elite. But the message of the Bhagavad GUo was addressed to all categories of men and encouraged all religious vocations. This was the privilege of devotion paid to a God who was at once personal and impersonal, creative and destructive, incarnate and transcendent.
15. From a certain point of view, it could be said that the Bhagavad Gftii recovers the archaic conception of total reality imagined as the alternation of opposing but complementary principles.



25 The Ordeals of Judaism:
From Apocalypse to Exaltation of the Torah
196. The beginnings of eschatology
Chapters 40 to 55 of the Book of Isaiah make up a separate work, known as Deutero-Isaiah ("Second Isaiah"). The text was composed during the last years of the Babylonian Exile by an unknown author, who was probably executed after a trial (see Is. 52: 13-53: 12). Its message is in strong contrast to the other prophecies, first of all by its optimism but also by a daring interpretationofcontemporary history: the Great King, Cyrus, Yahweh's instrument (41 :42), is preparing the destruction of Babylon; those who believe in the superiority of the Babylonian gods will be quickly confounded, for those gods are idols, inert and powerless (40:19 ff.; 44:12-20; etc.); Yahweh alone is God: "I am the first and the last; there is no other God besides me" (44:6; see also 45: 18-21); "I am God unrivaled / God who has no like" (46:9). We have here the most radical affirmation of a systematic monotheism, since even the existence of other gods is denied. "Did you not split Rahab in two, and pierce the Dragon through? Did you not dry up the sea, the waters of the great Abyss, to make the seabed a road for the redeemed to cross?" (59:9-10). The creation as well as history, and consequently both the Exile and the Liberation, are Yahweh's work. The liberation of the deportees is interpreted as a new Exodus. But this time it is a triumphant return: "I am making a road in the wilderness, paths in the wild" (43: 19). "Mountains and hills will break into joyful cries before you.... Cypress will grow instead of thorns, myrtle instead of briars" (55: 12-13; cf. 40:9-11; 54: 11-14). The new Exodus will not be made in haste: "You are not to hurry away,



248 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
you are not to leave like fugitives. No, Yahweh will go in front of you, and the God of Israel will be your rearguard" (52: 12). Other nations will be included in the redemption that is to come. "Tum to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God unrivaled" (45:22; see 56:1-7 on the converts to Yahweh). However, Israel will always enjoy its privileged situation, that of dominant nation. The fall of Jerusalem, the disappearance of the kingdom of Judah, and the Exile were in fact the divine judgments announced by the great prophets. Now that the punishment was completed, Yahweh would renew the Covenant, which this time would be eternal (55:3) and the redemption irrevocable (45:17; 51:6, 8). For "with everlasting love I have taken pity on you, says Yahweh, your redeemer" (54:8). Liberated by Yahweh, the deportees will return to Zion "shouting for joy, everlasting joy in their faces; joy and gladness go with them, sorrow and lament are ended" (51: 11). The enthusiasm, the exaltation, the beatific visions inspired by the certainty of imminent salvation are unparalleled in the earlier literature. Hosea, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel proclaimed their faith in the redemption of Israel. But the author of DeuteroIsaiah is the first prophet who works out an eschatology. In fact, he announces the dawn of a new age. Between the two periodsthe one that had just ended and the new one that was to begin at any moment-there is a fundamental difference. The other prophets did not preach the end of a tragic era and the coming of another that would be perfect and happy; they preached the end of Israel's immoral behavior, its regeneration by a sincere return to God. In contrast, Second Isaiah presents the inauguration of the new age as a dramatic history comprising a series of prodigious acts determined by God: (1) the ruin of Babylon by Yahweh (43: 14-15; etc.), by his instrument Cyrus (41:24; etc.) or by Israel (41:14-16); (2) the redemption of Israel, that is, the liberation of the exiles (49:25-26), the crossing of the wilderness (55:12-13), the arrival in Jerusalem (40:9-11), and the gatheringtogether of all who were scattered through the world (41:8-9); (3) Yahweh's return to Zion (40:9-11); (4) the transformation of the land by rebuilding (44:26), by the increase of the community



The beginnings of eschatology 249
(44: 1-5), and even by changes little short of reconstituting an Eden (51:3); (5) the conversion of the nations to Yahweh and the repudiation of their gods (51 :4-5). I This eschatological scenario will be returned to and developed by the later prophets (§ 197). But none of them will be able to equal the visionary power and spiritual depth of Second Isaiah. Four poems, called "Songs of the Servant" (42:1-4; 49:1-6; 50:40; 52: 13; 53: 12), are an original and dramatic expression of the sufferings ofthe Jewish people. Their interpretation has given rise to countless controversies. Very probably the "Servant of Yahweh" (ebhed yahveh) personifies the elite of the Jewish exiles. His torments are regarded as an expiation for the sins of the whole people. The Servant of Yahweh had accepted every tribulation: "I offered my back to those who struck me .... I did not cover my face against insults and spittle" (50:6). The ordeal of the deportation is a sacrifice by virtue of which Israel's sins were wiped out. "Ours were the sufferings he bore, ours the sorrows he carried.... He was pierced through for our faults, crushed for our sins. On him lies a punishment that brings us peace, and through his wounds we are healed" (53:5). Christian exegesis saw in the Servant of Yahweh an anticipation of the Messiah. A number of passages encouraged this interpretation. For "Yahweh burdened him with the sins of all of us .... Like a lamb that is led to the slaughterhouse ... for our faults [he was] struck down in death" (53:6-8). Voluntary victim, the Servant was "taken for a sinner, while he was bearing the faults of many and praying all the time for sinners" (53: 12). But "his soul's anguish over, he shall see the light and be content ... , [and] he shall divide the spoil with the mighty" (53: 11-12). Even more: Yahweh will make his Servant "the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth" (49:6). These texts take their place among the high points of Hebrew religious thought. The proclamation of universal salvation through the ordeals of the Servant of Yahweh announces Christianity.

250 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
197. Haggai and Zechariah, eschatological prophets
As soon as they returned (ca. 538), the deportees were faced, among other urgent problems, with rebuilding the Temple. The new sanctuary no longer belonged to the dynasty but to the people, who had undertaken to defray the expenses. The cornerstone was laid in ca. 537; however, work was stopped soon afterward. It was not until ca. 520, following a political change, that construction was resumed. The crisis that was shaking the Persian Empire brought a new wave of eschatological exaltation. Zerubbabel, who had just been appointed high commissioner, and the High Priest Joshua, supported by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, concentrated their efforts on rebuilding the sanctuary. In ca. 515 the Temple was consecrated, but Zerubbabel, considered untrustworthy by the Persian regime, had already left. For the enthusiasts, intoxicated by the recent prophecies, this was the beginning of a new series of disappointments. Since the divine judgment was now accomplished. when, they asked. would the eschatological age announced by Second Isaiah appear? For Haggai. the new age had begun at the moment when Zerubbabel laid the cornerstone (2: 15-19). And he announced that the day that the work was ended would see an earthquake. the fall of the "kings of the nations." the annihilation of their armies. and the installation of Zerubbabel as messianic king (2:20-23).2 However, when the Temple was finally consecrated. why, it was asked, did the esci1aton still not arrive? One of the most plausible answers explained the delay by the corruption of the community. But, as happened many times in history, the postponement of the universal transfiguration predicted by Second Isaiah altered the concept of salvation, and the eschatological hope was gradually extinguished. We shall evaluate, further on, the consequences of this state of confusion for the later history of Israel. However. the importance of eschatological prophecy must not be underestimated. Haggai and Zechariah insist on the radical difference between the two ages, the old and the new. For Zechariah, the former
2. Similar ideas occur in Zechariah (8:9-13: etc.).



Haggai and Zechariah, eschatological prophets 251
was characterized by Yahweh's will to destroy, the latter by his desire to save (1: 1-6; 8: 14-15). First there will be the destruction of the peoples responsible for Israel's tragedy (I: 15), followed by a very great "prosperity" dispensed by Yahweh (1:]7; 2:5-9; etc.). God will banish the sinners from Judah (5: ]-4), drive iniquities from the land (5:5-] 1), and gather the exiles together. Finally the reign of the Messiah will be inaugurated in Jerusalem, and the nations will come "to seek Yahweh Sabaoth in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Yahweh" (8:20-22; cf. 2: ]5). Similar prophecies occur in the text known as the" Apocalypse of Israel" (Isaiah, chap. 24-27).3 The same themes will be treated again in the fourth century by Deutero-Zechariah (9:tl-17; 10:3-12) and by the prophetJoel.4 The eschatological scenario contains all or some of the following motifs: annihilation of the nations, deliverance of Israel, gathering of the exiles in Jerusalem, paradisal transfiguration of the country, establishing divine sovereignty or a messianic reign, final conversion of the nations. In these images of an Eden we can see the eschatological modification of the pre-Exilic "optimistic prophets."5 From Deutero-Isaiah onward, the dawn of the eschaton was held to be imminent (see Is. 56: ]-2; 61 :2). Sometimes the prophet makes bold to remind Yahweh that he is late in restoring Jerusalem (Is. 62:7). However, he knows that the fault lies with the sinners, for "your iniquities have made a gulf between you and your God" (59:2).6 For Second Isaiah, as for the post-Exilic prophets, the inauguration of the new age will be preceded by great historical upheavals (the fall of Babylon, the nations' attack on Jerusalem, followed by their destruction).
3. God will judge all of Israel's enemies, their capitals will be ruined, yet the survivors will share in the messianic festival in Yahweh's presence on Mount Zion (24:21-25:12). 4. After the eschatological battle against the nations that have been guilty toward Yahweh and Israel, a paradisal period of wealth and peace will begin (Joel 4:2-3, 12; 4:18-21). ("Deutero-Zechariah" is composed of chapters 9-14 of the Book of Zechariah.)

6. The prophet Malachai (fifth century) refuses to specify the date of the "day of Yahweh." The essential thing is to prepare oneself inwardly, for "the day of his coming" may arrive at any time (3:2).



252 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
The extension of the eschatological redemption to other peoples is fraught with consequences for the later development of the religion of Israel. In Deutero-Isaiah (Is. 51:4-6), Yahweh, addressing all the nations, speaks of his "salvation," which will "come like the light." "That day, man will look to his creator and his eyes will turn to the Holy One of Israel" (17:7). Universal redemption is still more clearly proclaimed by Zephaniah (3:9): "Yes, I will then give the peoples lips that are clean, so that they may invoke the name of Yahweh and serve him under the same yoke." However, salvation is most often promised to all, but it will be accessible only at Jerusalem, the religious and national center ofIsrael (Is. 2:2-4; 25:6 ff.; 56:7; Jer. 3: 17; Zech. 8:20 ff.). Side by side with such prophecies, which concern only the historical world, there are other predictions more archaic in type (cf. § 12) that concern the cosmos in its totality. Haggai (2:6) announces that Yahweh will "shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land." The Last Judgment will be accompanied by cosmic catastrophes that will destroy the world (Is. 34:4; 51:6). But Yahweh will create "new heavens and a new earth, and the past will not be remembered" (Is. 65:17). The new creation will be indestructible (66:22), and Yahweh will be an "everlasting light" (60:20). Even Jerusalem will be renewed (Zech. 2:5-9) and will be called "by a new name, one which the mouth of Yahweh will confer" (Is. 62:2). As in so many other eschatological scenarios, the renewal of Creation will include certain "paradisal" elements: countless riches, unequaled fertility, disappearance of sicknesses, long life, eternal peace between men and animals, elimination of impurities, etc. But the pivot of the universe, restored to its first perfection, will be Jerusalem, true "center of the world."
198. Expectation of the messianic king
According to the eschatological prophecies, the renewed world will be ruled over by Yahweh7 or by a king whom God will

Expectation of the messianic king 253
designate and who will govern in his name. This king, usually called the "Anointed" (masiah), was supposed to descend from David. Isaiah speaks of a "child," a "son ... for the throne of David" (9: 1--6), of a "shoot ... from the stock of Jesse" (11: 1), who will reign with justice in a paradisal world in which "the wolf lives with the lamb, the panther lies down with the kid, calf and lion cub feed together with a little boy to lead them" (11 :6). Zechariah divides the messianic dignity between the temporal authority and the spiritual power, Zerubbabel and the High Priest Joshua (4: 1--6; 10:6--14). In another prediction he describes the messianic king entering Jerusalem, "victorious, ... triumphant, humble and riding on a donkey" (9:9-10). It is important to make it clear that the formula the" Anointed of Yahweh" was originally applied to the reigning king. Hence the eschatological personage was compared to a king. Later the term "anointed" was applied to priests, prophets, and patriarchs.8 To be "anointed" by Yahweh indicated a more intimate relation with God. But in the Old Testament the eschatological Messiah is not a supernatural being, descended from heaven to save the world. The redemption is exclusively the work of Yahweh. The Messiah is a mortal, an offspring of the line of David,
J
who will sit on the throne of David and reign with justice. Some historians have concluded that the messianic expectation arose
iIi circles animated by eschatological enthusiasm yet at the same time faithful to the Davidic monarchy. But these groups represented no more than a minority, and that is why the messianic expectation had no significant influence.9 Yet the problem is more complex. The originality of Hebrew religious thought is beyond doubt, but the royal ideology that it had elaborated included analogies with the "redeeming" role of the king in the great Oriental monarchies. 1o The eschatological prophecies have been contrasted with the message ofthe great pre-Exilic prophets. For these later prophets did not hope for a radical transformation of man and a new quality of existence but rather for a new age and therefore the

254 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
creation of a new world; man would be transformed indirectly, and in a way automatically, by this miracle, performed by Yahweh. As a result, the eschatological prophecies contained a misunderstanding of the message of the great prophets and an optimistic illusion concerning God's will to save Israel." Yet it must be observed that the hope of a cosmic renovation, involving man's restoration to his original integrity, is a central conception of archaic religiosity, especially that of the paleo-cultivators (see §§ 12 ff.). Every eschatology returns to, continues, and revalorizes the idea that the Creation, supremely the divine work, is alone capable of renewing and sanctifying human existence. To be sure, the eschatological expectation after the Exile came out of a different religious experience from that of the great prophets, but it was not less significant. In the last analysis, it was a matter of renouncing any hope of a spiritual perfection that could be realized by personal efforts, and of strengthening faith in the omnipotence of God and in his promises of salvation. It is true that the delay in the arrival of the eschaton ended by reinforcing the authority of the opposing legalistic and ritualistic orientations. But the eschatological hopes never finally disappeared (see § 203).
199. The progress of legalism
During the two centuries of peace under Persian suzerainty, the legalistic reform, begun before the Exile and continued during the Captivity, was definitively consolidated. At Babylon, circumcision was revalorized as the supreme symbol of membership in the people of Yahweh. Respect for the Sabbath became proof of fidelity to the Covenant (Is. 56: 1-8; 58: 13.-14). The code of ritual prescriptions contained in Leviticus (chaps. 17-26) was given its definitive form during the Exile. Called the "Law of Holiness" and attributed to Moses, it regulated sacrifices of animals, sexual relations and prohibitions, the calendar offestivals, and the details of the cult, with insistence on ritual purity and impurity. Like the Brahmal}as (see § 76), the "Law of Holiness"
II. See Fohrer, p. 352.



The progress of legalism 255
ritualizes the functions of life and social behavior. Its purpose is to preserve the purity of Israel in order to prepare it for a new conquest of the land promised by Yahweh. The survival of the people will be possible only if its ethnic and spiritual identity is safeguarded in the midst of a foreign and impure world. The reconstruction of the national life is no longer expected, as it was by the great prophets, to result from an inner conversion, brought about by the spirit, but from the effective organization of the community under the absolute authority of the Law (torah). In the cult, the glorification of God is subordinated to the "holiness" of Israel, that is, to its ritual purity, which is constantly threatened by sins. The public expiation of sins acquires a considerable importance, confirmed by the institution of the Great Pardon (yom kippurim). "The expiatory apparatus is so well set up that it scarcely leaves room to hope for a new and better order. There is not a trace of eschatology or of messianism in the sacerdotal narratives. For them, Israel possesses all the institutions necessary for its salvation, for its perpetuation through the centuries."'2 The priesthood was the only authority able to supervise the application of the Law. The hierocracy, which dominated religious life during the Persian period, had already built up its structures during the Exile. About 430, Nehemiah, a Jew living at the court of Artaxerxes I, became governor of Judaea and obtained authorization to rebuild the walls ofJerusalem. He also undertook religious reforms (among other things, he insisted on the elimination of priests married to non-Israelitish women). Not much is known of the history of another religious leader, Esdras, who (probably during the latter years of the fifth century) cOlltinued Nehemiah's mission.13 He too attributed prime importance to the ritual purity of Israel and prescribed the dissolution of mixed marriages. This was certainly no racial measure. The danger was religious, for intermarriages threatened the integrity of Yahwism. Nevertheless, Esdras' reform led to an ethnic segregation, and he con

See also ibid .• pp. 126 ff.• his analysis of the work undertaken by Nehemiah.



256 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
solidated the legalism that thenceforth dominated the religion of Israel. According to tradition (Nehemiah, chap. 8), Esdras summoned an assembly "of men, women, and all who had reached the age of reason," to which he read "the book of the Law of Moses." It is impossible to determine if the Pentateuch is meant or only a portion of that work. But, from the time of this solemn reading, the religion of Israel "officially" possesses sacred scriptures. The Law (torah) was very soon confused with the books of the Pentateuch. Oral transmission is replaced by the study and explication of written texts. Esdras was considered to be the first "scribe" or "doctor of the Law." The scribe became a veritable model of religious behavior. (See, further on, p. 261, the eulogy of the scribe by Ben Sirach.) But little by little a new idea develops-that of the oral Torah. It was held that, in addition to the written Law, Moses received supplementary instructions from God, which were transmitted orally from then on. This corpus of exegesis made up the Mishnah ("repetition"). Fundamentally, it was a way of legitimating what can already be called "esotericism," that is, an initiatory transmission of secret doctrines. 14 With time, the work of the "doctors" was invested with an authority approaching that of the Torah (see § 201). For our purpose, it would be useless to refer to all the works that were elaborated, rehandled, or edited during the centuries that followed Esdras' reform. It was this period that saw the composition of the Book of Chronicles, a certain number of the Psalms and the prophetic writings, 15 and the rehandling of many earlier texts. It was also this period that saw an increase in the tension between two opposed religious tendencies, to which we may give the approximate designations "universalist" and "nationalist." The universalists continued the eschatological prophets' hope of some day seeing the "nations" worship Yahweh, recognized as the one God. The nationalists, on the other hand, proclaimed the exclusive character of the Revelation and con

The personification of divine Wisdom 257
centrated their efforts on the defense of Israel's ethnic integrity. In fact the conflict was more complex and more subtle.
200. The personification of divine Wisdom
The most important event, and one that will have considerable consequences for the history of Judaism, was its confrontation with Hellenism. As early as the Late Bronze Age the Greeks had continuing relations with Palestine. During the first millennium their influx steadily increased, and it continued even under the Persian domination. '6 But it was especially after Alexander's victories that the influence of Hellenistic culture attained formidable proportions. The Greek language, culture, and institutions (schools, gymnasia, etc.), spread everywhere, not only in the Diaspora but also in Palestine, which after Alexander's death (ca. 323) was governed by the Ptolemies, the sovereigns of Egypt. 17 Just as for the Romans, history, especially after the prophets, was fraught with religious meanings. In other words, historical events, by transforming and modeling Israel's political destiny, were equally able to represent important moments in the history of salvation. For the Hebrews, national policy was not separate from religious activity, for ritual purity-and hence the preservation of Israel-was bound up with political autonomy. The growing influence of Hellenism made itself felt in Palestine in various political, religious, and cultural orientations. The aristocracy and certain sections of the bourgeoisie strove to introduce the ideas and institutions promoted by the Hellenistic Aufkliirung. This "liberal" and cosmopolitan policy, which threatened the national identity itself, was rejected by other social categories, first of all by the conservative religious circles and by the rural popUlation. The tension between these two

258 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
opposing tendencies will lead to the revolt of the Maccabees (§ 202). The differing ideological and religious orientations that split the Jewish people, from the time of Alexander's conquest (ca. 332) until the transformation of Palestine into a Roman province (ca. 69), left their mark on a number of works composed in Jerusalem or in the Diaspora. But it is important to point out that the force of the Zeitgeist was such that traces of Hellenistic conceptions are found even in texts composed to criticize and reject them. The personification of Wisdom (hokmii) belongs among the most original religious creations of this period. The first nine chapters of Proverbs (a book probably written in the middle of the third century B.C.) glorify the divine origin of Wisdom and enumerate her qualities. "Yahweh created me when his purpose first unfolded, before the oldest of his works. From everlasting I was firmly set, from the beginning, before earth came into being. The deep was not, when I was born" (8:22-24). Wisdom is "the inventor of lucidity of thought": by her, "monarchs rule ... , rulers govern, and the great impose justice on the world" (8: 12 ff.). Certain authors have seen the influence of Greek philosophy in this conception, but Sophia (Gk. sophia = wisdom) as a divine and personified entity appears comparatively late: she is found especially in the Hermetic writings, in Plutarch, and among the Neo-Platonists. 18 Other scholars have adduced Semitic parallels earlier than Greek influences, especially the Elephantine "Wisdom of Ahikar." 19 The antecedents of hokmii have even been sought in the cult of the Mother Goddesses (Isis or Ashtarte); but Wisdom is not God's companion: engendered by the Lord, she emerged from his mouth. Bousset and Gressmann have rightly emphasized the importance in Jewish religious thought of "intermediate beings" be

From despair to a new theodicy 259
tween man and God, especially in the Hellenistic period. 20 Certain schools of wisdom promoted hokmii to the rank of supreme authority, as mediatrix of the Revelation. But as we shall see in a moment, the various and contradictory interpretations and revalorizations of Wisdom reflect a crisis in depth that could radically have changed the profile of Judaism.
201. From despair to a new theodicy: The Qoheleth and Ecclesiasticus
Ecclesiastes (or the Qohelethfl is generally regarded, with the Book of Job, as a moving testimony to the shock brought on by the collapse of the doctrine of retribution. Against the theology of the Wisdom literature, the author of the Qoheleth dwells on the inexplicability of God's acts. Not only does the same destiny await the fool and the wise man (2: 15 ff.), man and beast ("one dies, the other too," 3: 19), but "crime is where the law should be, the criminal where the good should be" (3: 16). The author judges from his own experience: he has seen "the virtuous man perishing for all his virtue, for all his godlessness the godless living on" (7: 15). Calm, almost detached, like a philosopher, he keeps returning to this theme: "the good, I mean, receive the treatment the wicked deserve" (8: 14; cf. 9:2). In the last analysis, it is no longer possible to speak of God's "justice" (5:7; etc.). What is more, it is no longer possible to understand the significance of the Creation or the meaning of life: "no one can discover what the work is that goes on under the sun or explain why man should toil to seek yet never discover" (8: 17). For no one can "comprehend the work of God from beginning to end" (3: 11). God no longer lavishes either his anger or his mercy.

The meaning of the term Qoheleth is uncertain: it probably means "master of the assembly" or "the orator"; see Hengel. Judaism and Hellenism, vol. I, p. 129.



260 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
Feelings of guilt and hopes of forgiveness are equally vain. God has withdrawn from men; he no longer cares what befalls them. The celebrated refrain "Vanity and chasing of the wind" has its justification in the discovery of the precariousness and iniquity of human existence. The author congratulates "rather than the living ... the dead" and especially him "who is yet unborn"
(4:2-3). Even wisdom is vanity 0: 16--17; 2: 15; 9: 11). However, Ecclesiastes does not revolt against God. On the contrary, since men's fate is "in the hands of God" (9: 11), a man must take advantage of "the few days God has given him to live, since this is the lot assigned to him" (5:17). The only "right happiness" for man is hedonistic. "Go, eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a glad heart. . . . Spend your life with the woman you love ... ,for this is the lot assigned to you .... Whatever work you propose to do, do it while you can, for there is neither achievement, nor planning, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in Sheol, where you are going"(9:7-1O). This pessimistic rationalism has been compared with certain Greek philosophical schools. From the time of Voltaire a number of historians and interpreters have suggested the influence of Stoicism, of Epicurus, or of the Cyrenaic hedonists. 22 Influences from Hellenistic culture on post-Exilic Judaism were powerful and long-lasting (see § 202). Nevertheless, they are not found in the Qoheleth. The Greek philosophers and writers had drastically criticized the traditional mythologies and theologies, but the author of the Qoheleth, far from denying the existence of God, proclaims his reality and omnipotence23 and never ceases to repeat that we must profit by his gifts. What is more, the Qoheleth rejects neither the cult practices nor piety. So there is no question of atheism; what is being expressed is, rather, a tension between despair and resignation, brought on by the discovery of God's indifference. This invitation to enjoy life has been rightly compared with the Egyptian Song of the Harper (§ 30) and with Siduri's advice to Gilgamesh (§ 23). Less moving than the Qoheleth, the work by Ben Sirach, known as Ecclesiasticus, nevertheless better reveals the crisis under

From despair to a new theodicy 261
which Israel is laboring. Probably composed between ca. 190 and ca. 185 by a scribe (soper), teacher of a school of wisdom, the book is addressed to the young Hebrews who were fascinated by the Hellenistic Aufkliirung. Ben Sirach is a patriot who is convinced of the decisive importance (both religious and political) of the purity of the Law. He attacks the rich (13:3,18-23), since they are the most active supporters of cosmopolitanism and universalism. From the beginning of his book Ben Sirach protests against the secular ideology of Hellenism: "All wisdom is from the Lord," he exclaims (1: 1). This allows him to identify Wisdom (preexisting in God) with the Torah. The eulogy of Wisdom, the great hymn of chapter 24, is the high point of his book. Wisdom proclaims both her exalted position ("I came forth from the mouth of the Most High") and her descent to Jerusalem ("Thus was I established on Zion ... , and in Jerusalem I wield my authority" (24: 11). Against the opinion defended by the "cosmopolites," representatives of the "Enlightenment," Sirach describes the teacher of wisdom, the ideal scribe, as a scholar wrapped up in study of the Scriptures: he "devotes his soul to reflecting on the Law of the Most High. He researches into the wisdom of all the Ancients, he occupies his time with the prophecies. He researches into the hidden sense of proverbs, he ponders the obscurities of parables," etc. (39: I ff.). For "wisdom consists entirely in fearing the Lord, and wisdom is entirely constituted by the fulfilling of the Law" (19:20). In the Wisdom literature, especially in the Proverbs and in certain Psalms, the true "just man" was the sage who recognized the divine origin of the cosmic order and moral life. Hence wisdom was accessible to men independently oftheir religion. But Sirach rejects this "universalist" interpretation; he identifies wisdom with piety and the cult. The Torah is "no other than . . . the Law that Moses enjoined on us" (24:23).24 In other words, wisdom is the exclusive
24. In the "Eulogy of the Ancestors" (44: 1-49: 16), Ben Sirach praises the great figures of biblical history: Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, etc. It is a peculiar text, unparalleled in the Wisdom literature. (Hengel compares it to the glorification of heroes in Hellenistic literature, de viris illustribus [Judaism and Hellenism, vol. I, p. 136].) But the author loses his inspiration, and the "eulogy" becomes didactic and finally monotonous.



262 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
gift made by God to Israel. For God set a governor over each nation, "but Israel is the Lord's own portion" (17: 17). In theology Ben Sirach returns to the traditional positions. He criticizes the opinion that God is indifferent to the lot of human beings; in other words, he repudiates both the Qoheleth and the Greek philosophy that was fashionable in the cosmopolitan circles of Jerusalem. Above all, he attempts to justify the doctrine of retribution: he glorifies the perfection of the divine work (39: 16, 42: 15, 22:25); he repeats that the pious have a different fate from the wicked, for "good things were created from the beginning for good men, as evils were for sinners" (39:25). After long "pondering," he concludes: "the Lord alone will be found righteous" (18:2). This bold restoration of the traditional theodicy is accompanied by a bitter critique ofthe "enemies of Wisdom," identified with the Hellenophile apostates and "libertines." Sirach prays for Israel's deliverance from "foreign nations": "Rouse your fury, pour out your rage, destroy the opponent, annihilate the enemy . . . . Let . . . destruction overtake those who use your people badly"(36:6, 8). Yet, in the famous chapter 24, Wisdom declares: "Alone I encircled the vault of the sky, and I walked on the bottom of the deeps. Over the waves of the sea and over the whole earth, and over every people and nation I have held sway" (24:5). In other words, Wisdom is presented as a "power that fills the whole world, nature and humanity (and not only the Jews)."25 But Ben Sirach was obliged to limit and, in the last analysis, to forget the universalistic dimension of Wisdom. At grips with Hellenism and its Sophia, "a Wisdom could impose itself in Judaism only by allying itself with the factor that played the decisive part in the struggle: the Law.... The importance of hokmii for the formation of the Jewish religion in this struggle against Hellenism and its Sophia must not be underestimated."26

202. The first apocalyses: Daniel and 1 Enoch
The confrontation with Hellenism reached its highest point under the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (ca. 175-164). The opposition between the two parties-the Tobiads (the universalists) and the Oniads (the nationalists)-had for some time been threatening to degenerate into violence. The philhellenes demanded a radical reform, designed to transform biblical Judaism into a "modem" religion, comparable to the other contemporary syncretistic creations. In ca. 167, taking advantage of a failed attempt at a revolt by the Oniads, their adversaries advised Antiochus to abrogate the Torah by a royal decree.27 The Temple was transformed into a syncretistic sanctuary of Olympian Zeus, identified with the Phoenician Baal. On pain of death, the decree forbade observance of the Sabbath and feast days, the practice of circumcision, and the possession of biblical books. Everywhere in Palestine altars were raised to the gods of the Gentiles, and the populace was obliged to bring sacrifices to be offered to them. Ever since the conquest of Canaan, and especially under the monarchy, the Israelites had experienced the temptation and the danger of religious syncretism (§§ 113 ff.). But Antiochus Epiphanes' aggression was far more serious. It is true that he did not intend to substitute Olympian Zeus for Yahweh: his intention was to give a name to a god who, for the pagans, was essentially nameless.28 Besides, a number of Greek and Roman authors had compared Yahweh with Zeus. 29 Such a comparison, sacrilegious for the traditionalists, could be accepted by a great many of the philhellenic intelligentsia, fascinated by the grandiose religious and philosophical vision of Stoicism. But a philosophical interpretation of this kind was beyond the ken of the majority of Israelites; they saw in Zeus only one of the many gods honored by the Gentiles. In addition, as the historian Flavius Josephus later recognized (Antiq. Jud. 12. 220,253). Antiochus was guilty of numerous instances of sacrilege (first of all, in the polytheistic
27. According to Bickerman. it was the extreme hellenophiles of Jerusalem who drove Antiochus to the exacerbated violence of the repression: see his Der Gott der Makkabiier, pp. 120 ff. and passim.

nature of the cult established in Jerusalem) and of brigandage, intolerance, and, above all, persecution of the Jews.30 A priest named Mattathias, of the family of the Hasmoneans, gave the signal for armed revolt. From the outset he was supported by a group of zealots, the "pious" (hassidim). After Mattathias' death, one of his sons, Judas Maccabaeus, took over the direction of the war. In ca. 164 he occupied the Temple and restored the cult. This religious victory was regarded as sufficient by the hassidim. But the Maccabees continued the struggle for political freedom as well, which they succeeded in obtaining in ca. 128. After a lapse of several centuries, there were, once again, Jewish kings, now elected from the family of the Hasmoneans.31 Their reign was disastrous, and in ca. 63 the people accepted Roman suzerainty with relief. The century that elapsed between Antiochus Epiphanes' aggression and Pompey's reduction of Palestine to a Roman province was decisive for both the history and the religion of the Jewish people. On the one hand, the attempt at enforced paganization produced a trauma that the Jews of Palestine would never be able to forget: they could no longer believe in the innocence of the pagans, and thenceforth an abyss separated them from Hellenistic cultureY On the other hand, the military victory of the Maccabees had as its consequence a surprising increase in the political influence of the Jewish kingdom. What is more, the charismatic figure of Judas Maccabaeus later encouraged other armed insurrections, this time against the Romans. But the revolt in 66-70 ended in the destruction of the second Temple and of Jerusalem itself by Titus's legions. And the insurrection led by Bar Cochba in 132-35 was savagely put down by Hadrian. For the purpose of the present work, it is especially the religious creations of this period that will engage our attention. As

The first apocalypses: Daniel and 1 Enoch 265
was to be expected, contemporary historical events are transfigured, freighted with messages in cipher, integrated into a particular vision of universal history. It is in the circles of the "pious" (the hassidim) that the earliest apocalyptic writings appear-the Book of Daniel and the oldest section of the Book of Enoch. The "pious" made up a strictly closed community; they insisted on absolute respect for the Law and the need for repentance. The considerable importance accorded to repentance was the immediate consequence of an apocalyptic conception of history. And in fact the terror of history had attained proportions previously unknown. Therefore, Daniel and 1 Enoch predicted, the world is nearing its end; the pious must prepare themselves for God's imminent judgment. In its present form the Book of Daniel was completed about 164. The author describes recent or contemporary events in the form of prophecies uttered several centuries earlier. This procedure (vaticinia ex eventu) is characteristic of apocalyptic literature:33 it strengthens faith in the prophecies and hence helps believers to bear the ordeals of the present. Thus the Book of Daniel recounts a dream of Nebuchadnezzer (ca. 605-562). The king had seen a statue: its head was of gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, its legs of iron and earthenware. Suddenly a stone broke away and struck the statue: "and then iron and earthenware, bronze, silver, gold, all broke into small pieces as fine as chaff on the threshing floor in summer. The wind blew them away, leaving not a trace behind" (2:32-36). Daniel interprets the dream: the golden head is Nebuchadnezzer; after him another, lesser kingdom will arise, and then a third kingdom, this one of bronze, will rule the whole world. The fourth kingdom, "hard as iron," will crush the others, but will end by being destroyed. Then "the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not pass into the hands of another race" (2:44). The successive kingdoms of the Assyrians (i.e., the neo-Babylonian kingdom), of the Medes and the Persians, and finally that of Alexander indicate an accelerating process of decadence. But it is especially

266 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
during the fourth kingdom (that is, the kingdom of Antiochus Epiphanes) that the existence of the people of Israel is seriously threatened. However, Daniel gives his assurance, the end of this decayed world is drawing near, and after it God will build the eternal kingdom. Daniel further relates one of his own dreams, in which he saw four huge beasts coming out of the sea. The beasts represent the four kingdoms that are destined to perish; after that, rule over all the empires will be given "to the people of the saints of the Most High" (7:27). In short, by reminding them of the grandiose events of the past, especially the sequence of catastrophes that had destroyed the military empires. the author of Daniel had a definite end in view: to encourage and strengthen his coreligionists. But at the same time, the dramatic succession of the four kingdoms expresses a unitary conception of universal history. It is true that the mythological imagery shows an Oriental origin. The theme of the four successive kingdoms. symbolized by the four metals. is found in Hesiod and in Iran. As for the four beasts. they have numerous precedents: Babylonian. Iranian. Phoenician. 34 Similarly, the "great eon" of I Enoch (16: I) is comparable to the doctrine of the "Great Year."35 However. Daniel and the Jewish apocalypses present an element that is unknown in the other traditions: the events that make up universal history no longer reflect the eternal rhythm of the cosmic cycle and no longer depend on the stars; they develop in accordance with God's plan. 36 In this preestablished plan. Israel plays the central part. History is hastening to its end: in other words. Israel's definitive triumph is imminent. This triumph will not be simply political; in fact, the accomplishment of history is equivalent to the salvation of Israel, a salvation determined by God from all eternity and inscribed in the plan of History. despite the sins of his people.

The only hope: The end of the world 267
203. The only hope: The end of the world
As in the other traditions, in the Jewish apocalypse the end ofthe world is announced by a number ofcataclysms and strange cosmic phenomena: the sun will shine by night and the moon by day, blood will flow in the fountains, the stars will leave their orbits, the trees will drip blood, fire will spring from the bowels ofthe earth, stones will cry out, etc. (4 Esdras 5:4-12). The year will be shortened, men will kill one another, there will be drought and famine, etcY And, just as in the Iranian tradition, the end of the world will see the universaljudgment and hence also the resurrection ofthe dead. The Book ofIsaiah (26: 19) had already referred to the resurrection ("Your dead will come to life, their corpses will rise"), but it is difficult to date this passage. The earliest incontrovertible reference occurs in Daniel 12: 13: "you will rise for your share at the end of time."38 There is here very probably an Iranian influence; but we must also bear in mind the paleo-Oriental conceptions of the vegetation gods (see § 117). The doctrine of resurrection will be assiduously proclaimed in the apocalyptic literature (4 Esdras; 1 Enoch 51: 1-3,61 :5,62: 14 ff.; the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch) and by the Pharisees. At the time of Jesus' preaching, it was universally accepted, except by the Sadducees. As for the Last Judgment, Daniel (7:9-14) describes it as taking place before "one ofgreat age," his "robe white as snow," seated on a throne of flames: "a court was held and the books were opened." In his ecstatic dream Enoch had also seen the Lord seated on his throne and the "sealed books," and he witnessed the judgment ofthe fallen angels and ofthe apo~tates, condemned to be cast into a burning gulf (90:20 ff.; see Charles, Apocrypha, vol. 1, pp. 259-60). The image of the "Most High" seated on "the throne of judgment" reappears in 4 Esdras, where sinners are destined to the "furnace of Gehenna" and the virtuous are
rewarded in the "Paradise of delight" (7:33-37; Charles, vol. 2,
37. See Eliade. The Myth of the Eternal Return. pp. 147 ff.: P. Volz. Die Eschatologie. pp. 150 ff. These cliches. which are typical of apocalyptic literature. derive from an archaic mythico-ritual scenario: the end of the world. followed by a new creation (§ 12: see also Eliade. Myth and Reality. chaps. 4-5). 38. From the same period is 1 Enoch 90:33 and the work by Jason of Cyrene. composed soon after the death ofJudas Maccabaeus: see Hengel. vol. I. p. 196.



268 THE ORDEALS OF,JUDAISM
p. 583). After the Judgment, evil will be abolished forever, corruption will be vanquished, and truth will reign everywhere (4 Esdras 6:26-28; Charles, vol. 2, pp. 576--77). The conception of the eschatological judgment by fire is very probably of Iranian origin (see § 104). In the same vision of the "one of great age" and the Judgment, Daniel witnesses the descent from heaven of "one like a son of man," who was led into the presence of the "one of great age" and "on him was conferred sovereignty, glory, and kingship" (7:13-14). In the "Son of Man" (i.e., "Man") Daniel symbolizes the people of Israel at the supreme moment of eschatological triumph. The expression will enjoy a great success during the first century before our era; in addition, it is the title that Jesus will bestow on himself. What we have here is a comparatively familiar figure in the Hellenistic world, that of the Anthropos or Primordial Man. The myth is Indo-Iranian in origin (cf. Puru!jla, Gay6mart), but the immediate precedents for the "Son of Man" (= "Man") are to be sought in Irano-"Chaldean" religious syncretism (see § 216). The idea of the First Man invested with an eschatological mission is not biblical. It is only in late Judaism that the notion appears of an Adam who existed before the Creation. 39 Thus the unitarian concept of universal history allowed the eschatological meaning of the contemporary period to be deciphered. Contrary to the old cosmologies, which explained the progressive and ineluctable decline of the world by a cyclical theory (whose strictest expression was the Indian doctrine of the four yugas), the hassidim proclaimed Yahweh sole Lord of History. In the Book of Daniel and 1 Enoch, God remains the central figure: Evil is not clearly personified in an Adversary of Yahweh. Evil is engendered by man's disobedience (1 Enoch 98:4 fT.) and by the revolt of the fallen angels.
39. In fact Judaism did not know that the Son of Man was a variant of the myth of the Primordial Man. The Jewish apocalyptical writings glorify the eschatological role of the Son of Man but make no reference to his preexistence (see Mowinckel, He That Cometh, pp. 420 ff.). F. A. Borsch has well brought out the Oriental mythologem of the king as primordial Son of Man: see his The Son of Man in Myth and History, pp. 89 ff.



The only hope: The end of the world 269
But the background changes markedly in the apocalyptic literature. The world and history are now regarded as dominated by the forces of evil, that is, by the demonic powers commanded by Satan. The first mentions of Satan (Job 1:6 fT.; Zechariah 3:1 fT.) present him as belonging to Yahweh's celestial court. He was the "Enemy" because he was the celestial personage hostile to man (see § 115). Now, however, Satan incarnates the principle of Evil: he becomes the Adversary of God. In addition, a new idea takes form: that of the two ages (or two kingdoms): "this reign" and "the other reign." In fact it is written: "the Most High has made not one Age but two" (4 Esdras 7:50).40 In this age the" kingdom ofSatan" is destined to triumph. Saint Paul calls Satan "the god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4). His power will attain its culminating point at the approach of the messianic era, when there will be a mUltiplication of the catastrophes and aberrant phenomena briefly mentioned above (p. 267). But in the eschatological battle, Yahweh will conquer Satan, annihilate or overcome all the demons, extirpate evil, and then build his Kingdom, dispensing eternal life, joy, and peace.41 Certain texts speak of a return to Paradise and hence of the abolition of death (4 Esdras 8:52-54). Yet, despite its perfection and perenniality, this newly created world remains a physical one. The figure of Satan probably developed under the influence ofIranian dualism.42 In any case, it presents a mitigated dualism, for Satan does not coexist from the beginning with God, and he is not eternal. On the other hand, account must be taken of an earlier tradition, which conceived Yahweh as absolute totality of the real, that is, as a c~incidentia oppositorum in which all contraries coexisted-including "evil" (see § 59). We must remember the celebrated example of Samuel: "Now the spirit of
40. The same work contains the archaic idea of the inevitable degeneration of the world: "Creation is already old; it has already passed the strength of youth" (4 Esdras 14: 10). 41. The date of the eschaton can be calculated by the "wise"; see, inter alia, Daniel 9:22 ff.; 1 Enoch 10: 12, 89, 90, 97; 2 Esdras 4:5, 14: II: etc. See also W. Bousset, Religion des ludentums. 2d ed., pp. 283 ff.: P. Volz, Eschatologie, 2d ed., pp. 141 ff. 42. The Qumran texts refer to two spirits created by God, one good and one evil (see § 233), a doctrine that is reminiscent of Zurvanism (§ 213).



270 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
Yahweh had left Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh filled him with terror" (I Sam. 16: 14). As in other religions. dualism assumes clear form after a spiritual crisis that raises doubts concerning both the language and the postulates of the traditional theology and that ends. among other things. in a personification of the negative aspects of life, reality, and divinity. What until then was conceived as a moment in the universal process (based on the alternation of contraries: day/night; life/death; good/evil; etc.) is thenceforth isolated. personified, and invested with a specific and exclusive function. especially that of Evil (cf. § t 95). Probably Satan is at once the result ofa "splitting" ofthe archaic image of Yahweh (a consequence of reflecting on the mystery of divinity) and of the influence of Iranian dualistic doctrines. In any case, the figure of Satan, as incarnation of Evil, will play a considerable part in the formation and history of Christianity before becoming the famous personage, with his countless metamorphoses, of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European literature. In regard to the eschaton and the new Creation, the apocalyptic literature does not present a unified conception. Its authors agree in terming the calamities and torments of the present time "childbirth" or "messianic" pains, for they precede and announce the coming ofthe Messiah. Just as in Isaiah and the postExilic prophets, the Messiah is always regarded as a human being: he is the King of God's people.43 To mention only one example, the Psalms of Solomon (a work composed in the first century B.C.) contain a prayer to hasten the coming of the Messiah, son of David, in order that he may crush "unrighteous rulers and purge Jerusalem" of the presence of the pagans (17:22-24). He is a "righteous king ... and there shall be no unrighteousness in his days; for all shall be holy and their king [will be] the anointed of the Lord" (17:26 ff., 29, 30). For some, the Messiah's Kingdom still belongs to the present eon; in a sense it constitutes an intermediate reign. the millennium.44 This messianic kingdom is destined to endure for 400,

The only hope: The end of the world 271
500, or 1,000 years. It will be followed by the universal judgment and the destruction of the world. The Messiah himself will die, and all will return to the primordial "silence," that is, to Chaos. ••After seven days the age which is not yet awake shall be roused" (4 Esdras 7:28 ff.; Charles, vol. 2, p. 582); in other words, there will be the new Creation, resurrection, and eternal bliss.45 Several texts rank the Messiah among eternal beings, together with Enoch, Elijah, and other personages who were taken up to Heaven by God. According to certain rabbinic sources, immediately after his birth the Messiah was hidden in Paradise or, with Elijah, in Heaven.46 The Testament of the XIl Patriarchs and the texts from Qumran mention two messiahs, a priest and a king, the priestly Messiah having the primacy. The Testament of Levi states that under his priesthood "all sin will disappear ... and he himself will open the gates of Paradise ... and to the Saints he will give to eat of the Tree of Life" (18:9-12). In short, the priestly Messiah will annul the consequences of original sin.47 We may add that the preaching of Jesus and the swift rise of Christianity are bound up with the same spiritual ferment that is characteristic of Jewish messianic hopes and eschatological speculations between the revolt of the Maccabees and the destruction of the second Temple (see § 224).

The same motifs constantly recur: destruction of the pagans. triumph of the Jews, the blessings God bestows on the faithful, etc. (see the sources cited by Moore, Judaism, vol. 2. pp. 345 ff.). Certain texts add that on the day that the Messiah comes all peoples will be converted to the worship of the one God. Yahweh (Moore. ibid., p. 371). But the conviction cherished by the authors of the apocalypses that the date of the eschaton can be calculated is abandoned. The Messiah will arrive at the moment chosen by God. Until then the faithful must practice penitence. repent, and obey the Law (Moore, ibid., pp. 350 ff.).



272 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
204. Reaction of the Pharisees: Glorification of the Torah
In Judaism, as in other traditions, apocalyptic visions strengthened defenses against the terror of history. The instructed could decipher a comforting presage in contemporary catastrophes. The worse the situation of the Jewish people became, the more the certainty increased that the present eon was nearing its end. In short, the worsening of the terror announced the imminence ,of salvation. In future, the religious valorization of the sufferings brought on by historical events will be reiterated time and again, and not only by the Jews and the Christians. There is here neither a running:..away from the pressure of history nor an optimism fed on fantasies. Apocalyptic literature constituted a sacred science, divine in origin and essence. As the author of Daniel writes (2:2~22), it is God who confers "wisdom on the wise," it is "his to uncover depths and mysteries, to know what lies in darkness." Enoch, that fabulous personage, exemplary image of the sage and prophet of the primordial period,48 now becomes highly popular: he had predicted the imminent Judgment of the prediluvian generation ,and the fallen angels. Now he proclaims a new revelation and demands repentance, for the second Judgment is coming. Like Daniel, Enoch receives sacred knowledge in his dreams and visions (1 Enoch 13:8, 14:1, 83:1 ff., 93:1 ff.). Angels introduce him to celestial mysteries, and he undertakes ecstatic journeys to Heaven (chaps. 12-36), where God allows him to see the tablets on which universal history is written from beginning to end. At the dawn of time, God had revealed secret knowledge to certain personages famed for their piety and their visionary powers. This teaching was esoteric, "sealed"-in other words, inaccessible to the profane. It was then transmitted to a few exceptional beings. But since the primordial period corresponds to the end of time (eschaton), sacred knowledge is now revealed again, and always to a small group of initiates. In 1 Enoch 1:6
48. According to tradition, Enoch was one of the prediluvian patriarchs: he "walked with God. Then he vanished, for God took him" (Genesis 5:24). What follows is much indebted to Hengel's analyses in Judaism and Hellenism. vol. 1, pp. 204 iI.



Reaction of the Pharisees 273
the Son of Man is described as the initiate par excellence, "master of all secrets." When he is seated on his throne "his mouth shall pour forth all the secrets of wisdom" (ibid., 51 :3). His most characteristic qualities are wisdom and intelligence.49 We will add that the theme of a saving "hidden knowledge" is very popular during the Hellenistic period (§ 209), and it constitutes the justification for all the Gnostic schools (§ 229).50 The authors ofthe Apocalypse fully developed this conception of a wisdom hidden in Heaven and inaccessible to human beings,51 and ecstatic visions and experiences also played a leading role in the apocalyptic literature (as everywhere else in the Hellenistic world); for visions and ecstasies confirmed the authenticity of the true "prophet and sage," and, what is more, ecstatic experiences progressively enriched the sum of revealed knowledge. The Book of Daniel disclosed only universal history, whereas the texts that claimed to belong to the "tradition of Enoch" embraced the whole world, visible and invisible: terrestrial and celestial geography, astronomy and astrology, meteorology and medicine. For the "tradition of Enoch," the cosmological mysteries at once revealed and glorified the work of God. As Hengel observes (vol. I, p. 208), the masters of wisdom (hassidim) were engaged even more vigorously than Ben Sirach in the controversy with Hellenism. For basically, by virtue of "apocalyptic revelations," they possessed a knowledge superior to that of the Greeks. Indeed, their knowledge embraced the cosmos, history, and the celestial world and, in addition, the destiny of man at the moment of the eschaton-a knowledge inaccessible to reason. This conception of a total, esoteric, and saving knowledge, which could be apprehended in ecstatic visions or transmitted by an initiation, is also documented in other religious traditions and will be shared by ancient Christianity. No other current of Jewish thought borrowed HellenisticOriental ideas as freely as did the apocalyptic. Nevertheless, its

In India the doctrine of a secret gnosis, communicated by initiation, is documented from the time of the Upanishads, but it will be principally elaborated in Tantric literature (see vol. 3). 51.

274 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
foundation still rests on the Old Testament conception of the history of salvation. 52 We have to do with an extremely important spiritual phenomenon: the reli[?ious creativity inspired by syncretism. Indeed, the hassidim, authors of the earliest apocalyptic literature, received and assimilated ideas derived from several syncretistic systems; but these ideas enriched Judaism and sustained the hope of the Jewish people during an extremely difficult period. A similar process can be seen in other religious currents. Under the leadership of the "Teacher of Righteousness," the Hassidic group known as the Essenes separated from the rest of the community and resolved to live a monastic life in the desert (§ 223); now the closest analogy to the cenobitic organization of the Essenes is the closed conventicle of the Greek type. Even the Pharisees, the second group derived from the hassidim. incorporated a number of Hellenistic ideas into their doctrine of the LawY In the last analysis, Antiochus Epiphanes' sacrilegious aggression and the victorious revolt of the Maccabees determined the orientation and future structures of Judaism. The "zeal against the Torah" that animated Antiochus' partisans encouraged "zeal for the Torah" and ended by consolidating the ontology of the Law. 54 The Torah was raised to the rank of an absolute and eternal reality, exemplary model of the Creation. According to Rabbi Simon ben Laqisch (third century A.D.)' the existence of the world depends on the fact that Israel accepts the Torah; without that, the world will return to Chaos.55 Each of the 248 commandments and 365 prohibitions that make up the Torah receives a cosmic meaning. Man, created with 248 members and 365 veins, reflects in his very structure at once the work of God

I, pp. 292 ff. Eschatology-that is. the "second fruit in the confrontation with Hellenism"-represented the only force able to limit the omnipresence of the Torah: in fact. the Torah will end by dominating both the historical present and the cosmic rhythms (ibid.. p. 312). 55. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus (ca. 100 A.D.) is reported to have said: "If the Torah were not there, Heaven and Earth would not have existed" (text cited by Hengel. vol. I. p. 172). See other sources in Moore. Judaism. vol. I. pp. 266 ff.. 450 ff.



Reaction of the Pharisees 275
(the Cosmos) and his revelation (the Law).56 As absolute reality, the Torah is the source of life. As Hillel writes, "Where there is much Torah, there is much life" (Pirke Abhot 3. 7). But the glorification of the Torah radically altered the destiny of Judaism. From the time of the prophets, Hebraic religiosity was stimulated by the tension between universalist and particularist tendencies. The cause of this vigorous and creative opposition was essentially the paradoxical character of Revelation. In fact, a revelation from God in history, that is, limited to the Jewish people, was proclaimed universally valid while at the same time being considered as exclusively for the Israelites. In the second half of the second century B.C., by virtue of the surprising development ofthe Diaspora and also, in part, because of missionary propaganda, Judaism was becoming a universal religion. But the reaction against Antiochus' sacrilege ended in what has been called "fixation on the Torah."57 Now, such a "fixation" hampered the rise of a universal religion. To be sure, the Law played the decisive role in the defense of the national identity, but the consciousness of a universal mission could not develop freely beside a powerful and nationalistic current. This, by the way, explains the decision of the primitive Christian church, animated by the Jewish prophetic spirit, to send missionaries to the Samaritans, who were so greatly detested by the Israelites (Acts 8:4 ff.), and, a little later, to the non-Jews of Antioch (Acts, chaps. 11-19, etc.). "Christology took the place of Torah ontology as an expression of the free and sovereign revelation of God in history, which no longer recognized national or historically conditioned Iimitations."58 The immutability of the Torah and the triumph of legalism together put an end to eschatological hopes. "Even apocalyptic literature gradually died out and was replaced by Jewish mysticism."59
56. Two centuries later, Tantrism will present a similar anthropocosmic system and a similar ritual; see vol. 3. 57. See Hengel, vol.' I, p. 312. Even in the Diaspora the primacy of the Torah was not denied. Allegorical interpretation did not annul the literal meaning of the Scriptures, and Philo accepted the prescribed laws and prohibitions. 58. Hengel, vol. I, p. 314. 59. Ibid., p. 175.



276 THE ORDEALS OF JUDAISM
It must be added, however, that, from the point of view of Judaism, abandonment of the universal mission was the price that had to be paid for safeguarding the Israelitish community. In the last analysis, what was essential was the historical con
tinuity of the Jewish people. It was not a matter solely of "nationalism" but, above all, of a theology built up around the idea of the "chosen people." Israel was chosen by Yahweh; it was his people. Hence the Jewish people constituted a historical reality sanctified by the will of God. National alienation was equivalent to an apostasy, that is, to profanation of an ethnic structure consecrated by its very origin. Hence the first duty of the Jewish people was to maintain its identity intact, even to the end of history: in other words, always to remain at the disposal of God.



26 Syncretism and Creativity
in the Hellenistic Period: The Promise of Salvation
205. The Mystery religions
As we observed earlier (§ 184), the promise of salvation constitutes the novelty and principal characteristic of the Hellenistic religions. Uppermost, of course, was individual salvation (although the dynastic cults had a similar purpose-salvation of the dynasty).· The divinities who were believed to have undergone death and resurrection were closer to individual men than were the tutelary gods of the polis. Their cult included a more or less elaborate initiation (catechesis, rites, esoteric teaching), after which the neophyte was granted admission to the conventicle. Membership in a Mystery society did not preclude initiation into other secret brotherhoods. Like all of the spiritual currents of the time, the hope of salvation developed under the sign of syncretism. Indeed, syncretism is the dominant characteristic of the period. An immemorial and abundantly documented phenomenon, syncretism had played an important part in the formation of the Hittite, Greek, and Roman religions, in the religion of Israel, in Mahayana Buddhism, and in Taoism, but what marks the syncretism of the Hellenistic and Roman period is its scale and its surprising creativity. Far from manifesting attrition and sterility, syncretism seems to be the condition for every religious creation. We have seen its importance in post-Exilic Judaism (§ 202). We

278 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
shall later discover a similar process in certain creations of Iranian religiosity (§ 212). Primitive Christianity also develops in a syncretistic environment. It is true that, in the period we are considering, only one god, Serapis, is the result of a deliberate fusion of two divine figures. But the Greco-Oriental Mysteries, the eschatological and apocalyptic speculations, and the cult of sovereigns-to cite only a few examples-illustrate the importance and strength of syncretistic thought. It could be said that the promise of salvation attempts to exorcise the redoubtable power of the goddess Tyche (Chance; Latin, Fortuna). Capricious and unpredictable, Tyche indifferently brings good or evil; she manifests herself as (man~ke ("necessity") or heimarmene ("destiny") and shows her power especially in the lives of the greatest, such as Alexander.1 Destiny ends by being associated with astral fatalism. The existence of individuals as well as the duration of cities and states is determined by the stars. This doctrine and, with it, astrology-the technique that applies its principles-develop under the impulse given by the Babylonians' observations of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. To be sure, the theory of micro-macrocosmic correspondences had long been known in Mesopotamia (§ 24) and elsewhere in the Asian world. However. this time man not only feels that he shares in the cosmic rhythms but discovers that his life is determined by the motions of the stars.J This pessimistic conception is not discredited until the conviction arises that certain divine beings are independent of Destiny, that they are even superior to it. Bel is proclaimed Master of Chance, Fortunae rector. In the Mysteries of Isis, the goddess assures the initiate that she can prolong life beyond the term fixed by fate. In the Praises of Isis and Osiris the goddess pro
2. See Tarn. Hellenistic Civilisation. p. 340.
3. The Stoics set themselves to correct this astrological amoralism: they interpreted Destiny as a Providence that takes morality into account: indeed. it was Providence that had created the planets. On the other hand. it must be pointed out that. as the result of the astronomical calculations made by the Babylonians. the history of the world was thereafter divided into periods and crises dominated by the planets. This new cosmo-historical vision inspires certain eschatological speculations (e.g.• the Jewish apocalyptic visions [see § 202]. the Golden Age inaugurated by Augustus at the end of the Civil Wars. etc.).



The Mystery religions 279
claims: "I have conquered Destiny. and Destiny obeys me." What is more, Tyche (or Fortuna) becomes an attribute of Isis.4 A number of mysteriosophic and Hermetic texts state that initiates are no longer determined by fate. 5 Unlike initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries, which took place only in the telesterion and only at a particular date (see § 97), initiations into the other religions of salvation could take place anywhere and at any time. All these initiatory cults boasted of an immemorial antiquity even if their establishment, in certain cases, did not date back even a century. This is certainly a cliche of the Zeitgeist of the Hellenistic and Roman periods; but, as we shall see, the religions of salvation reactualize certain archaic religious elements. With the exception of Dionysianism, all of the Mysteries are of Oriental origin: Phrygian (Cybele and Attis), Egyptian (Isis and Osiris), Phoenician (Adonis), Iranian (Mithra). But in the Hellenistic period, and especially under the Empire, these Oriental cults no longer had an ethnic character; their structures and soteriologies proclaimed a universalist aim. We know the principal features of their public cults; as for their secret rituals-that is, initiation properly speaking-we are reduced to a few brief and enigmatic indications. We know that the postulant took an oath of secrecy concerning all that he would see and hear in the course of the ceremonies. He then learned the sacred history (the hieros logos), which related the myth of the cult's origin. Probably the myth was already known to the neophyte, but he was now given a new, esoteric, interpretation of it-which was equivalent to revealing the true meaning ofthe divine drama. The initiation was preceded by a period of fasting and mortification, at the end of which the novice was purified by lustrations. In the Mysteries of Mithra and Attis, bulls and rams were sacrificed over a pit covered by a grill; the blood dripped onto the mystes, who was placed un

Chance (casus in/estlls) no longer has power over those who serve and honor Isis (Apuleius, Met. II. 15). The Gnostics are no longer prisoners of/atum (Lactantius, Institutiones 2. 16); for spirit (nous) is master of Destiny (heimarmene) as well as of Law (Corp. Herm. 12. 9).

derneath. In some way that has not been elucidated, the neophyte took part ritually in a scenario centered around the death and resurrection (or rebirth) of the divinity. In short, the initiation realized a kind of imitatio dei. Most of the fragmentary indications at our disposal refer to the symbolic death and resurrection of the mystes. During his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis, Lucius, the hero of Apuleius' romance, the Metamorphoses, undergoes a "voluntary death" and "approaches the kingdom of death" in order to obtain his " spiritual birthday" (II. 21, 24). In the Mysteries of Cybele, the neophyte is regarded as moriturus, "in the process of dying."6 This mystical death was followed by a new, spiritual, birth. In the Phrygian rite, Sallust writes, the new initiates' 'were fed on milk as ifthey were reborn" (De diis et mundo 4). And in the text known as the Liturgy of Mithra, but which is filled with Hermetic gnosis, we read: "Today, having been born again by Thee out of so many myriads ... "or "Born again for rebirth of that life-giving birth .... "7 In the course of the ceremonies the neophyte contemplated or handled certain sacred objects. At the same time, he was told the interpretation of their symbolism; this probably amounted to an esoteric exegesis that defined and justified their value as means of salvation. At a certain time in his initiation the mystes partook of a ritual banquet. At the period with which we are concerned, this immemorial practice had chiefly an eschatological meaning.8 In the Mysteries of Mithra the bread and wine gave the initiates strength and wisdom in this life and a glorious immortality in the afterlife.9 By virtue of his initiation, the neophyte became the equal of the gods.

206. The mystical Dionysus
In the Hellenistic and Roman period the most popular Greek god was Dionysus. His public cult was "purified" and spiritualized by the elimination of ecstasy (which, however, continued to play a part in the Dionysiac Mysteries). II What is more, the mythology of Dionysus was the most lively, vivid, mythology. The plastic arts, especially the decoration of sarcophaguses, were freely inspired by the famous mythological episodes ofthe god's career, first of all his childhood (his miraculous birth, the winnowing basket), then his rescue of Ariadne, followed by the hieros gamos. The mythology, the sites of the cult, the monuments, all pointed to Dionysus' twofold nature, born of divine Zeus and a mortal woman, persecuted yet victorious, murdered yet resuscitated. At Delphi his tomb was shown, but his resurrection was depicted on many monuments elsewhere. He had succeeded in raising his mother to the rank of an Olympian; above all, he had brought Ariadne back from Hades and married her. In the Hellenistic period the figure of Ariadne symbolized the human soul. In other words, Dionysus not only delivered the soul from death; he also united himself with it in a mystical marriage (Schneider, Kulturgeschichte des Hellenismus, vol. 2, p. 802). Dionysus' popularity was also spread by the societies of technitai, or Dionysiac artists, associations documented in Athens as early as ca. 300. These are parareligious brotherhoods,12 but without any Mystery characteristics. As for the Dionysiac Mysteries stricto sensu, we have already presented their essential character (§ 125). We repeat that in the Bacchae Dionysus proclaims the Mystery structure of his cult and explains the necessity for initiatory secrecy: 'Their secrecy forbids communicating

them to those who are not bacchants." "What use are they to those who celebrate them?" Pentheus asks. "It is not permitted thee to learn that, but they are things worthy to be known" (lines 470-74). In the last analysis, initiatory secrecy was well maintained. The texts referring to the liturgical service have almost all disappeared, except for some late Orphic hymns. The archeological documents from the Hellenistic and Roman periods are numerous enough, but the interpretation of their symbolism, even when it is accepted by the majority of scholars. is not enough to elucidate the initiation. There can be no doubt of the closed, hence ritual (that is, initiatory), structure of the Dionysiac ti1iasoi. An inscription from Cumae (beginning of the fifth century) proves that the brotherhoods had their own cemeteries, to which only initiates into the Mysteries of Bacchus were admitted. 13 It has been possible to show (contrary to the opinion of some scholars, who saw in them only a favorable setting for profane banquets and jollifications) that the Dionysiac caverns were cult sites. The earliest iconographic testimonies, going back to the sixth century, show Dionysus lying in a cave or a maenad dancing before a huge mask of the god set inside a cavern. Now the texts refer to sacred dances and ritual banquets in front of Dionysiac caves; on the other hand, they also state that the ceremonies take place at night to insure their secrecy. As for the initiatory rituals, we are reduced to hypotheses. In his essay on the figured scenes, Friedrich Matz (though following the example of other scholars) concludes that the central act of the initiation consisted in the unveiling of a phallus hidden in a winnowing fan (liknon). 14 It is probable that this scene, which is abundantly illustrated, had a ritual importance, but Boyance has cogently shown that the texts mention the liknon in connection with all kinds of initiations, not only with that of Dionysus. On the other hand, in a stucco relief preserved at the Museum of Ostia (Matz's plate XXV), in which Dionysus and three other personages are designated by name, the cist bears the word

Mysteria. Now the cist contained the crepundia or signa, that is, the "mystical playthings" (top, bull-roarer, knucklebones, mirror) that are already documented in the third century B.C. in the Gorub papyrus. It is with these playthings that the Titans succeeded in attracting the infant Dionysus-Zagreus, whom they later slaughtered and cut to pieces (§ 125). This myth has been transmitted to us primarily by a few Christian authors, but it was also known to two who had been initiated into the MysteriesPlutarch and Apuleius-and also to the Orphic brotherhood of Hellenistic Egypt. IS To judge from the monuments, the showing of the phallus seems to have formed part "of the somewhat terrifying rites that precede access to the god's presence."16 Boyance holds that "what could engender faith in the mystes-certainty of a divine support able to insure him a privileged lot in the beyond-cannot have been the sight of such an object" (p. 45). The central act of the initiation was the divine presence made perceptible by music and dance, an experience that engendered "belief in an intimate bond established with the god."17 These observations are indubitably well justified, but they do not advance our knowledge of the initiatory ritual. In any case, it is necessary to state that the showing of the phallus constituted a religious act, for the generative organ was that of Dionysus himself, at once god and mortal who had conquered death. We need only remember the sacrality of Siva's IbiRam to understand that, in certain cultural and religious contexts, the generative organ of a god not only symbolizes the mystery of his creativity but also conveys his presence. In the modern Western world such a religious experience is, of course, inaccessible. For, unlike the Mysteries, Christianity ignored the sacramental value of sex

The celebrated frescoes of the Villa Item <the "Villa dei Misteri") at Pompeii presumably refer to the Dionysiac cult. Bllt contrary to the opinion of those who see initiatory episodes in the frescoes, other authors consider that they do not reveal Mysteries and do not illustrate either the god's myth or the stages of an initiation: see G. Zuntz. "On the Dionysiac Fresco in the Villa dei Misteri," pp. IS0--81.



284 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
uality. The same could be said of the Dionysiac ritual meals, when the initiates, crowned with flowers, surrendered to ajoyous intoxication, regarded as a divine possession. It is difficult for us to grasp the sacrality of such rejoicings. Yet they anticipated the otherworld bliss promised to initiates into the Mystery of Dionysus. 18 Late texts reflecting the Orphic eschatology emphasize the role of Dionysus as king of the new age. Though a child, he was made by Zeus to reign over all the gods in the universe (Kern, Orphicorum Fragmenta, no. 207). The epiphany of the divine infant announces the new youth of the universe, the cosmic palingenesis. 19 (The infant, as sign of rebirth and renewal, continues the religious symbolism of the phallus.) The hopes attached to the triumph of Dionysus, hence to a periodical regeneration of the world, imply belief in an imminent return of the Golden Age. This explains the popularity of the title "New Dionysus," which was bestowed on several personages (or which they bestowed on themselves) around the beginning of our era.20
207. Attis and Cybele
Even better than other contemporary religious forms, the cult of Cybele and the Mysteries of Attis illustrate the structural diversity that characterizes the syncretistic creations of the period. The Phrygian goddess, who was introduced into Rome in ca. 205-204 to save the Republic when it was being seriously threatened by the Carthaginian armies (§ 168), had a multimil

19. "The concept of palingenesis and the idea that a new god is a god who reappears periodically not only have obvious affinities with the concept implying the alternation of the epiphanies and disappearances (aphanismoi) of a god who manifested himself in his parousiai. whether annual or biennial (trieterides). On the plane of cosmic duration. this concept can easily be transposed in the form of a cycle of return on an equally cosmic scale" (Jeanmaire. Dionysos, pp. 413-14). On the Dionysiac symbolism of the infant, see also Thrcan. Les sarcophages. pp. 394 ff.• 405 ff.• 433 ff. 20. Jeanmaire (p. 416) cites Ptolemy XI, the triumvir Antony, and. later. Trajan.

lennial history. The black stone in which Cybele was ritually present testifies to the archaism of her cult: rock is one of the oldest symbols of the Earth Mother. And it is again a rock-in other words, the Great Mother Cybele-that is at the origin of Attis and his cult. According to the myth reported by Pausanias (7. 17. 10-12), a hermaphroditic monster, Agdistis, was born of a stone fecundated by Zeus. 21 The gods decided to castrate it and turn it into the goddess Cybele. According to another variant, the hermaphrodite's blood engendered an almond tree. Eating an almond, Nana,22 daughter of the River Sangarius, becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child, Attis. Grown up, Attis is celebrating his marriage to the king's daughter when Agdistis, who loves him, enters the hall in which the festivities are taking place. All those present are stricken with madness, the king cuts off his genital organs, and Attis flees, mutilates himself under a pine tree, and dies. In despair, Agdistis tries to resuscitate him, but Zeus forbids it; all that he will grant is for Attis' body to remain incorruptible, his only sign of life being the growth of his hair and the motion of his little finger. 23 Since Agdistis is only an epiphany of the androgynous Great Mother, Attis is at once the son, the lover, and the victim of Cybele. The goddess regrets her jealousy, repents, and bewails her sweetheart. This archaic mythology and the bloodstained rites that we shall describe in a moment constitute the source of a religion of salvation that became extremely popular throughout the Roman Empire during the first centuries of the Christian era. It is certain that its mythico-ritual scenario illustrated the "mystery" of vegetation (see § 12): the blood and the sexual organs offered to Cybele insured the Earth Mother's fertility. With the passing of time, however, this immemorial cult became invested with new religious meanings; its bloodstained rites became so many means of redemption. Probably the soteriological function of the cult had been known for some time. At Pessinus there was a closed
21. This episode is reminiscent of a Hurrito-Hittite myth: Kumarbi, "the
Father of the Gods," impregnated a rock with his semen (see *46).
22. Nana is another epiphany of the Mother (hence of Agdistis). 23. According to another variant, Attis is killed by a boar-an ancient tradition, for Herodotus (I. 34 ff.) relates it in euhemerized form.

brotherhood of the Mystery-religion type. 24 Long before it was introduced into Rome, the cult of Attis and Cybele had spread into Greece, where it probably underwent some changes. In Greece as at Rome, the repulsion aroused by the bloodstained rites of castration and by the eunuch priests had kept Attis in a subordinate position. For a long time the god enjoyed no public cult in Rome, though a number of terra-cotta statuettes that go back to the second century B.C. testify to his presence. It was only under Claudius and his successors that Attis and the rites he had established were raised to the first rank-an event whose importance we must point out. The festivals were celebrated at the spring equinox,25 from March 15 to March 28. On the first day (canna intl"at, "the entrance of the reed") the brotherhood of reed-bearers brought cut reeds to the temple (according to the legend, Cybele had found the infant Attis exposed on the bank of the river Sangarius). After seven days the brotherhood of tree-bearers brought a cut pine tree from the forest (arbor intrat). Its trunk was wrapped in narrow bands, like a corpse, and an image of Attis was fastened to the middle of it. The tree represented the dead god. On March 24, "the day of blood" (dies sanguinis), the priests (the Galloi) and the neophytes indulged in a savage dance to the sound of flutes, cymbals, and tambourines, whipped themselves until the blood flowed, and gashed their arms with knives; at the height of their frenzy some neophytes cut off their virile organs and offered them to the goddess in oblation. The funereal lamentations of the night of March 24-25 were suddenly succeeded by an explosion ofjoy when, in the morning, the god's resurrection was announced. 26 It was the day of "joy,"

Our information concerning the calendar of festivals is late (third and fourth centuries A.D.): see the Present Position of Studies. § 207. But it is important to present the structure of the cult at its apogee. 26. Several authors have connected with this scene a passage in the Christian writer Firmicus Maternus (fourth century) describing the nocturnal lamentations around a divine statue on a bier. Suddenly a light is brought. and the priest consoles the congregation: "Be of good heart. you novices. because the god is saved: deliverance from distress will come for us as well" (De errore profanarum religionum 22: trans. Vermaseren). Firmicus Maternus does not

the Hilaria. After a day of "rest" (requietio), March 27 saw the great procession to the river, where the statue of Cybele was bathed (the lavatio). According to some authors, individual initiations were performed on March 28; the neophyte was sanctified by the blood of a sacrificed bull or ram (taurobolium or criobolium). Presumably this sacrifice took the place of the mystes' self-mutilation, for he offered the victim's genital organs to the goddess. He was admitted to the "nuptial chamber" (pastos, cubiculum) as mystical husband of Cybele, just like the Gallos, who entered this sacrosanct place to offer the Mother the fruits of his mutilation.27 As for the initiation proper, the only document we have is the formula quoted by Clement of Alexandria, which served initiates as a password: "From the tambourine 1 have eaten; from the cymball have drunk; 1 have become the kernos: the room 1 have entered" (Protrept. 2. 15; trans. Vermaseren). The analogy with the Eleusinian synthema is obvious (see § 98); it can be explained either by a borrowing from one side or the other or by derivation from a common formula used in several Mysteries during the Hellenistic period. The formula refers to certain initiation rites. The tambourine and cymbal are Cybele's favorite instruments. Since Attis was called "the ear harvested green" (Philosophoumena 5. 8), it is likely that the ritual meal consisted essentially of bread and wine; indeed, Firmicus Maternus (De errore 18) interprets it as the demonic and baneful equivalent of the Christian communion. As for the kernos. it is probable that in the initiatory cult of Attis this terra-cotta vessel was not used to hold
state which cult is referred to, but his description seems most appropriate to Osiris; see Hepding, Ituis, p. 106; Loisy, Les mysteres parens et Ie mystere chretien, p. 102. However, we must not forget that there is a structural analogy between the two religions; see M. J. Vermaseren, Cybele and Auis, p. 116. 27. The Gallos was one of the priests of Cybele, usually a eunuch. (The name comes from the Phrygian river Gallos.) See Hepding, Attis, pp. 190 ff. According to another interpretation, the pastos (literally, "bridal chamber") was a cave or a subterranean place in the temple itself or in the vicinity; by entering it, the mystes effected a descensus ad in/eros; see Vermaseren, Cybele and Attis, pp. 117-18. It should be added that, in the Imperial period, the taurobolium and the criobolium could be performed at any season. They were also celebrated for the health of the emperor.



288 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
an oblation of food but to carry the sexual organs of the bull or the ram to the Mother "under the canopy."28 As we shall see, the Mysteries of Attis and Cybele, at least after a certain date. promised the "immortalization" of initiates. For the moment, we must look more closely into the meaning of the principal rites-that is, the alimentary prohibitions and the self-castration of the Gallot. Despite their "spiritualization." the Hellenistic Mystery religions had preserved a number of archaic elements. This, of course, is characteristic of religious movements that require individual initiation. Omophagia, supremely the Dionysiac rite, was able to reactualize a religious experience typical of primitive hunters (§ 124). As for the initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries, it made possible an anamnesis, a remembrance, of archaic sacraments, first of all, the sacramental value of wheat and bread (§ 99). In general it may be said that ceremonies that are initiatory in structure rediscover certain archaic modes of behavior and revalorize a number of ritual objects that have fallen into disuse. Examples are the flint knives employed for initiatory circumcisions. the role of the bullroarer in Orphic mythology and initiation, and the religious function of secrecy (§ 99). The Hellenistic Mysteries drew on archaic ritual modes of behavior-savage music, frenetic dances, tattooing, the use of hallucinogenic plants-in order to force the divinity to approach or even to obtain an unio mystica. In the Mysteries of Attis the fast imposed on the neophytes consisted chiefly in abstaining from bread,29 for the god was "the ear harvested green." The first initiatory meal amounted to no more than the experience ofthe sacramental value of bread and wine, an experience seldom accessible to urban populations. As for the self-mutilation of the Galloi and of certain disciples during their ecstatic trances, it insured their absolute chastity, in other words, their total gift of

themselves to the divinity.30 It is difficult to analyze such an experience; in addition to the more or less unconscious impulses that governed the neophyte, we must take into account the nostalgia for a ritual androgyny, or the desire to increase one's reserve of "sacred powers" by a unique or spectacular infirmity, or even the will to feel expelled from the traditional structures of society by a total imitatio dei. In the last analysis, the cult of Attis and Cybele made it possible to rediscover the religious values of sexuality, of physical suffering, and of blood. The disciples' trances freed them from the authority of norms and conventions; in a certain sense, it was the discovery of freedom. The tendency to recover immemorial experiences was counterbalanced by the effort to "sublimate" the divine pair AttisCybele and to reinterpret their cults. This time, too, we are dealing with a phenomenon typical of the religious syncretisms of the time: the will to restore the virtues of the most distant past and, at the same time, to glorify the most recent creations. Allegorical interpretation, laboriously practiced by the theologians and philosophers of the first centuries A.D., identified Attis with the very principles of both creation and the dialectical process life-death-rebirth. Paradoxically, Attis ended by being assimilated to the sun and became the center of the solar theology that was so popular toward the end of paganism. The original meaning of the initiation-mystical assimilation to the god-was enriched with new values. A Roman inscription of 376 proclaims that he who accomplishes the taurobolium and the criobolium is "reborn
for eternity."3I There is probably Christian influence here. But the promise of "resurrection" or "rebirth" was implicit in the mythico-ritual scenario of the Hilaria. It is likely that, faced by

It must be made clear that absolute devotion to the divinity does not necessarily imply sexual selfmutilation. Ceremonial chastity could be insured by a symbolic marriage. In the second grade ofthe Mithraic initiation, called Nymphus, the mystes became the bride of the god, but the rite was wholly spiritual; see Meslin, pp. 302-3. 31. Taurobolio criobolioque in aeternum renatus; inscription cited by Hepding, Attis, p. 89.

the success of the Christian mission, the theologians of the Mysteries strongly emphasized the idea of immortality as a consequence of the redemption accomplished by Attis. However this may be, it is certain that the Roman emperors, especially the last Antonines, vigorously fostered the Phrygian cult in the hope of halting the rise of Christianity.
208. Isis and the Egyptian Mysteries
The Egyptian Mysteries differ from similar religious associations by the fact that we know their "origin" and the stages of their spread through Asia and Europe. At the beginning of the third century B.C. Ptolemy Soter decided to strengthen his rule by the help of a divinity accepted as supreme by both Egyptians and Greeks. So he raised Serapis (Sarapis) to the rank of a great national god. According to the tradition transmitted by Plutarch (De [side 28), Ptolemy had seen the god's statue ill a dream. In ca. 286 (or ca. 278) the statue was brought from Sinope and set up in the temple that had been newly built in Alexandria. The etymology of Serapis and his country of origin are still in dispute. His name is usually derived from Oserapis, that is, "OsirisApis.' '32 As for his cult, Ptolemy Soter ordered two learned theologians to establish its structure: the Egyptian priest Manetho and the Greek Timotheus. The former, author of several works, among them a history of Egypt, was well versed in Greek culture; the latter, a member of the famous family of the Eumolpids of Eleusis, had been initiated into several Mysteries. The success of the new cult was insured by the great prestige enjoyed by Isis and Osiris. As we saw (§ 33), the theologians of the New Empire had elaborated a grandiose religious synthesis by associating Osiris and Re; regarded as complementary, these two great gods ended by being identified. Osiris' popularity did not cease to grow, for he was the only Egyptian god who, murdered, triumphed over death and was "reanimated" by the efforts of Isis and Horus. At Abydos and elsewhere, ritual scenarios representing various episodes of his legend were per

Isis and the Egyptian Mysteries 291
formed before the temples. Herodotus had been present at similar ceremonies at Sai"s; he assimilated them to the Greek Mysteries, and that is why he abstained from describing them (2. 61).33 It is beyond doubt that certain secret Osirian rituals, performed inside the temples, had reference to the future life.34 But it would be risky to interpret these secret rites as actual initiation ceremonies performed for the benefit of a living individual to obtain his "salvation." On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that such a knowing theologian as Manetho did not incorporate earlier religious traditions into the Mysteries of Isis. It has been possible to show, for example, that the aretalogies of Isis do not represent a recent innovation; on the contrary, they repeat archaic ritual formulas associated with the royal ideology.35 In addition, as we shall soon see, the Mysteries of Isis continue certain ceremonies practiced in ancient Egypt. For our purpose it would be otiose to summarize the chronology and the incidents of the cull's dissemination beyond the frontiers of Egypt. Spreading first into Asia Minor and Greece, it entered Italy in the second century B.C. and Rome at the beginning of the first century. The Egyptian cult became so popular that the Romans more than once fiercely opposed the Senate's decision to demolish its temples. Like the other Mysteries of the Hellenistic and Imperial periods, the Mysteries of Isis and of Serapis comprised public festivals, a daily cult, and secret rites that constituted the initiation proper. We know the principal features of the first two ceremonial systems. As for the initiation, Apuleius' testimony in book 11 of his Metamorphoses is regarded-and rightly-as the most valuable document of all ancient writings on the Mysteries. The two great public festivals reactualized certain episodes of the myth of Osiris and Isis. The first, the Navigium, or "Vessel of Isis," opened the spring navigation season. The second, the

292 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
Inventio of Osiris, took place from October 29 to November 1. The three days offasting, lamentation, and pantomimes depicting the search for the murdered and dismembered Osiris and the funeral rites performed by Isis (see § 29) were followed by the joy and jubilation ofthe disciples when it was announced to them that the god's body had been found, reconstructed, and reanimated.36 The daily services were celebrated at dawn and in the afternoon. The gates of the sanctuary were opened very early in the morning, and the spectators could contemplate the statues of the divinities and be present at the cult performed by the priests. According to Apuleius, on the day set in advance by the goddess the pontiff sprinkles the neophyte with water and imparts to him "certain secret things unlawful to be uttered." Then, before all those present, he urges him to abstain for ten days from flesh food and from wine. On the evening of the initiation the company of disciples offers the initiate various presents; after this, wearing a linen tunic, he is led by the priest into the inmost chapel of the sanctuary.
Thou wouldst peradventure demand, thou studious reader, what was said and done there: verily I would tell thee if it were lawful for me to tell; thou wouldst know if it were convenient for thee to hear . . . . Howbeit I will not long torment thy mind, which peradventure is somewhat religious and given to some devotion; listen therefore and believe it to be true. Thou shalt understand that I approached near unto hell, even to the gates of Proserpine, and after that I was ravished throughout all the elements, I returned to my proper place: about midnight I saw the sun brightly shine, I saw likewise the gods celestial and the gods infernal, before whom I presented myself and worshipped them. [Met. 11. 23; trans. Aldington, rev. Gaselee]
We undoubtedly have here an experience of death and resurrection, but its specific content is not known. The neophyte descends to Hades and returns by way of the four cosmic elements: he sees the sun shining in the darknesS of night, an image that could refer to Osiris-Re's nightly journey through the un

Isis and the Egyptian Mysteries 293
derground world; he then approaches other gods, contemplates them, and worships them close by. Attempts have been made to discover in this enigmatic account references to the neophyte's passing through various halls ornamented with statues of the gods and representing the underworld, then suddenly coming out into a brightly lit chamber. Other scholars have referred to parapsychological experiences or hypnotism. As a matter of fact, all that can safely be said is that the mystes ends by feeling that he is identified with Osiris-Re or with Horus. For in the morning, clad in twelve ritual garments symbolizing the twelve signs of the zodiac, the mystes mounts a platform in the very center of the temple, with a crown of palm leaves on his head. Thus, "adorned like unto the sun, and made in fashion of an image," he appeared before the eyes of the disciples in front of the statue of Isis. For the hero of the Metamorphoses, this day was the anniversary of his rebirth in the bosom of the Mysteries. On the third day, the initiation was completed by a ritual banquet. However, after a year, and still at the goddess's command, the neophyte is introduced to the "ceremonies of the great god: which were done in the night" (11. 28), a rite presumably connected with the Inventio of Osiris. Finally, another vision ofthe goddess advises a third initiation; but Apuleius reveals nothing concerning these final initiatory ordeals. As we saw (§ 33), in ancient Egypt the individual hoped for a posthumous identification with Osiris. But by virtue of his initiation the neophyte obtained, here and now on earth, this mystical identification with the god; in other words, it was the living individual who was "divinized," not the soul in its postmortem condition. Just as Osiris was "reanimated" by Isis, the neophyte's "divinization" was essentially the work of the goddess. We do not know the "existential situation" of the mystes; it is certain, however, that no initiate doubted his privileged lot, in the presence of the gods, after death. If, so far as the initiation proper is concerned, we are reduced to conjectures, what Apuleius tells us allows us to perceive the syncretistic structures of the new cult. The Egyptian elements play an important part: the mythico-ritual scenario of Isis and Osiris inspires the two public festivals and probably, at least in part, the initiation rites; the elevation of Isis to the rank of universal (or, indeed, of sole)



294 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
goddess and of Osiris to the rank of supreme god continues the tendency, already documented in the archaic period (see § 33), to raise various divinities to the highest plane. On the other hand, the mystes' descent to the underworld and his ascent through the cosmic elements bear witness to a specifically Hellenistic conception. The great popularity of the Egyptian Mysteries during the first centuries of the Christian era, together with the fact that certain features of the iconography and mythology of the Virgin Mary were borrowed from Isis, shows that we have here a genuine religious creation and not an artificial or obsolescent revival. The gods of the Mysteries must be regarded as new epiphanies of Isis and Osiris. What is more, it is these Hellenistic interpretations that will be developed by the neo-Orphic and neo-Platonist theologians. Assimilated to Dionysus (who was also killed, dismembered, and resuscitated), Osiris admirably illustrated the neo-Orphic theology: the cosmology conceived as a self-sacrifice of the divinity, as the dispersal of the One in the Many, followed by "resurrection," that is, by the gathering of MUltiplicity into the primordial Unity.37 The mutual identification of all the gods ends' in a "monotheism" of the syncretistic type dear to the theosophers of late
antiquity. It is significant that such a "monotheistic" universalism glorifies especially the typically suffering gods, such as Dionysus and Orpheus. As for Isis and Osiris, it is the last interpretations and revalorizations of them by the theologians of the Mysteries and the neo-Platonist philosophers that, for centuries, will be regarded as illustrating the true, and the deepest, Egyptian religious genius.38

The revelation of Hermes Trismegistus 295
is a collection of texts of unequal value, composed between the third century B.C. and the third century A.D. Two categories are distinguished: writings pertaining to popular Hermetism (astrology, magic, occult sciences, alchemy) and learned Hermetic literature, first of all the seventeen treatises, in Greek, of the Corpus Hermeticum. 39 Despite their differences in structure, content, and style, the two groups of texts have a certain unity of intention, reminiscent of the relations between philosophical and popular Taoism (§ 133) and of the continuity between the "classic" and "baroque" expressions of Yoga. Chronologically, the texts of popular Hermetism are the earlier, some of them going back to the third century B.C.; the philosophical Hermetism developed especially in the second century of the Christian era. As might be expected, this literature more or less reflects Judeo-Egyptian syncretism (hence certain Iranian elements as well), and the influence of Platonism is also apparent; but, from the second century A.D., Gnostic dualism becomes predominant. "By its actors, its setting, its myths, Hermetic literature seeks to be Egyptian. This claim, at least for some early texts, is based on a certain knowledge of Ptolemaic or Roman Egypt, a knowledge whose reality must not be underestimated."40 The personages (Thoth, Agathodaimon, Ammon, etc.), the settings (Memphis, Hermopolis, Sals, Aswan, etc.), certain motifs of pharaonic theology (for example, the emergence of the primordial mound at Thebes or Hermopolis), familiarity with ancient Egyptian traditions,41 are all indications that must be takeninto account. The identification of Thoth with Hermes was already known to Herodotus (2. 152). For the writers of the Hellenistic period, Thoth was the .patron of all the sciences, the inventor of hieroglyphs, and a redoubtable magician. He was held to have created the

296 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
world by his word; now, as we know, the Stoics had identified Hermes with the logos.42 The writings of popular Hermetism played an important part during the Roman Imperial period. Tbis was first of all because of their"operative" character: in an age terrorized by the omnipotence of Destiny, these texts revealed the "secrets of nature" (the doctrine of analogy, the "sympathetic" relations among the different planes of the cosmos), by virtue of which the magus became possessed of their secret forces. Even astral fatalism could be turned to advantage. In one of the astrological writings, the Liber Hermeticus,43 there was not a single reference to the problem of death and the future life; what mattered was how to live happily on earth. Yet knowledge of nature, and hence mastery over it, was made possible by the divinity. "Since it is a matter of discovering a whole network of sympathies and antipathies that nature maintains secretly, how can this secret be penetrated unless a god reveals it?"44 In consequence, Hermetic science is at once a mystery and the initiatory transmission of that mystery; knowledge of nature is obtained by prayer and the cult or, on a lower plane, by magical control.45 In the amorphous corpus of magical recipes and treatises on natural magic and the occult sciences, we sometimes find conceptions characteristic of the learned literature. In the Kore Kosmou (14-18) the creation of souls is described as an alchemical operation. The prayer with which the Asclepius ends is found, in Greek, in a magical recipe. The importance of this "popular" Hermetic literature must not be underestimated. It inspired and provided material for Pliny's Natural History and a famous medieval work, the Physiologus; its cosmology and its governing ideas (the doctrine of sympathies and correspondences, espe

cially the correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm) were markedly successful from the late Middle Ages until about the end of the eighteenth century; they are to be found not only among the Italian Platonists and Paracelsus but also among schol
ars as different as John Dee, Ashmole, Fludd, and Newton.46 Like the category of popular texts, the writings that make up the learned Hermetic literature are held to have been revealed by Hermes Trismegistus. These treatises differ in their literary forms and especially in their doctrine. As early as 1914 Bousset had observed that the Corpus Hermeticum presents two irreconcilable theologies: one optimistic (monistic-pantheistic in type), the other pessimistic, characterized by a strong dualism. For the first, the cosmos is beautiful and good, since it is imbued with God. 47 By contemplating the beauty of the cosmos, one arrives at the divinity. God, who is at once One (C.H. II. II; etc.) and All (12. 22), is the creator and is called "Father." Man occupies the third place in the triad, after God and the cosmos. His mission is "to admire and worship celestial things, to take care of and govern terrestrial things" (Asclepius 8). In the last analysis, man is the necessary complement of the Creation; he is "the mortal living being, ornament of the immortal living Being" (C.H. 4. 2). In the pessimistic doctrine, the world is, on the contrary, fundamentally bad: "It is not the work of God, in any case of the First God, for this First God resides infinitely above all matter, he is hidden in the mystery of his being; hence one cannot attain to God except by fleeing the world, one must behave here below like a stranger."48 Let us consider, for example, the genesis of the world and the pathetic drama of man according to the first treatise in~ the Corpus, the Poimandres: the androgynous superior Intellect (Nous) first produces a demiurge, who forms the world, then the Anthropos, the celestial man; the latter descends to the lower sphere, where, "deceived by love," he unites with

47. The world is an "immortal living being" (Corpus Hermeticum 8. I); it is called "god" or "great god"; it is through the world that "the invisible god" manifests himself (ibid. 5. 2). 48. Festugiere, Hermetisme, p. 37; cf. his Rew?lation, vol. I. pp. 84 ff.



298 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
Nature (Physis) and engenders terrestrial man. Thenceforth the divine Anthropos ceases to exist as a separate person, for he animates man: his life is transformed into the human soul, and his light into nous. This is why, alone among terrestrial beings, man is at once mortal and immortal. However, by the help of knowledge, man can "become god." This dualism. which devalorizes the world and the body. emphasizes the identity between the divine and the spiritual element in man; just like the divinity, the human spirit (nous) is characterized by i{fe and light. Since the world is "the totality of Evil" (C.H. 6. 4). it is necessary to become a "stranger" to the world (13. 1) in order to accomplish the "birth of the divinity" (13. 7); indeed. the regenerated man has an immortal body. he is "son of God. All in All" (13. 2). This theology, which is bound up with a particular cosmology and soteriology. has an essentially "Gnostic" structure (see § 229). But it would be risky to attribute to Gnosticism properly speaking the Hermetic treatises that express dualism and pessimism. Certain mythological and philosophical elements of the "gnostic" type are part of the Zeitgeist of the period-for example, contempt for the world. the saving value of a primordial science revealed by a God or a superhuman Being and communicated under the sign of secrecy. We add that the decisive importance attributed to knowledge. transmitted in an initiatory manner to a few disciples. is reminiscent of the Indian tradition (the Upanishads, Sarpkhya. and Vedfmta). just as the "immortal body" of regenerated man shows analogies with Hatha Yoga. Taoism. and Indian and Chinese alchemy.
210. Initiatory aspects of Hermetism
Some scholars (Reitzenstein and Geffcken) have regarded Hermetism as a religious brotherhood in the strict sense. with its dogmas. rites. and liturgy, of which the Corpus Hermeticum would have been the Sacred Book. Following Bousset. E. Kroll. and Cumont, Father Festugiere rejects this hypothesis. First of all, the presence of two opposed and irreconcilable doctrines is incompatible with the idea of a brotherhood made up of' 'a group



Initiatory aspects of Hermetism 299
of men who have deliberately chosen a system of thought and life"; second, the Hermetic literature shows no trace of "ceremonies peculiar to the disciples of Hermes. There is nothing that resembles the sacraments of the Gnostic sects, neither baptism nor communion nor confession of sins nor laying-on of hands to consecrate ministers of the cult. There is no clergy, no appearance of a hierarchic organization or. degrees of initiation. Only two classes of individuals are distinguished: those who hear the word and those who refuse it. Now this distinction had become banal; it had entered the literature at least as early as Parmenides."49 Nevertheless, if the hypothesis of a secret, hierarchically organized brotherhood is not persuasive, the great treatises of learned Hermetism presuppose the existence of closed groups practicing an initiation comparable to that of the alchemists and the Tantrics. To use an expression in the Asclepius (sec. 25), what is involved is a religio mentis: God "receives pure spiritual sacrifices" (CH. 1. 3). Nevertheless, we detect a specific religious atmosphere and certain ritual patterns of behavior: the disciples gather together in a sanctuary; they obey the rule of silence and keep the revelations secret; the catechesis takes place with ceremonial seriousness; the relations between the teacher and his disciples have religious overtones. The myth of baptism in a krater indicates familiarity with the rituals ofthe Mysteries.50 We may also assume knowledge of certain practices leading to ecstasy; Hermes tells his disciple Tat of an ecstatic experience after which he entered an "immortal body," and Tat was able to imitate him (C.H. 13. 3, 13). It could be said that what we have here is a new model for communicating esoteric wisdom. Unlike the closed associations involving a hierarchical organization, initiation rites, and progressive revelation of a secret doctrine, Hermetism, like al
49. Festugiere, Hermetisme. p. 38; cf. Revelation. vol. I. pp. 81 ff. 50. According to the fourth treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum. at the beginning of time God had filled a kraUr with nous; those who submerge themselves in it become "perfect men." Festugiere has shown that this represents a mixture of two rites practiced in the Mysteries: (I) ingestion of a sacred drink drawn from a krater (mixing bowl) and (2) a purifying and initiatory bath; see his "Le bapteme dans Ie cratere," p. 108 (reprinted in Hermetisme. pp. 100-112).



300 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
cherny, implies only a certain number of revealed texts, transmitted and interpreted by a "master" to a few carefully prepared disciples (that is, made "pure" by asceticism, meditation, and certain cult practices). We must not lose sight of the fact that the revelation contained in the great treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum constitutes a supreme Gnosis, that is, the esoteric knowledge that insures salvation; the mere fact of having understood and assimilated it is equivalent to an "initiation."51 This new type of individual and wholly spiritual "initiation," made possible by attentively reading and meditating on an esoteric text, developed during the Imperial period and especially after the triumph of Christianity. It follows, on the one hand, from the considerable prestige enjoyed by "Sacred Books," reputedly of divine origin, and, on the other hand, after the fifth century of our era, from the disappearance of the Mysteries and the eclipse of other secret organizations. From the point of view of this new model of initiation, transmission of esoteric doctrines does not imply an "initiatory chain"; for the sacred text can be forgotten for centuries, but if it is rediscovered by a competent reader its message becomes intelligible and contemporary. The transmission of Hermetism constitutes a fascinating chapter in the history of esotericism. It took place through the Syriac and Arabic literatures and especially through the efforts of the Sabaeans of Harran, in Mesopotamia, who survived in Islam until the eleventh century.52 Recent research has revealed certain Hermetic elements in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and in several thirteenth-century Spanish texts.53 However, the real renaissance of Hermetism in Western Europe began with the
51. Festugiere has aptly analyzed a characteristic cliche of the Hellenistic period: the transposition of a rite of the cult Mysteries into a metaphor in what the author calls "literary Mystery." But such a transposition still retains a religious value: it stimulates the reader's imagination and reveals to him the deep meaning of the Mysteries. 52. The Sabaeans had, as "prophets," Hermes and Agathodaimon and were
acquainted with the fourth treatise of the Corpus Her~eticum. the title of which is "Krater." According to Henry and Renee Kahane, krater is the same word as "grail."

Latin translation of the Corpus Hermeticum undertaken by Marsilius Ficinus at the request of Cosmo de' Medici and finished in 1463. But, as we shall see (vol. 3), the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum in fact constitutes a new, creative, and daring interpretation of Hermetism.
211. Hellenistic alchemy
Historians of the sciences distinguish three periods in the formation of Greco-Egyptian alchemy:54 (1) the period of technical recipes for the operations of alloying, coloring, and imitating gold (for example, the Leiden and Stockholm papyri, which date from the third century B.C.); (2) the philosophical period, probably inaugurated by Bolos of Mendes (second century B.C.), which is manifested in the Physika kai Mystika, an apocryphal treatise attributed to Democritus; (3) finally, the period of alchemical literature properly speaking, that of Zosimus (third-fourth centuries) and his commentators (fourth-fifth centuries). Although the problem of the historical origin of Alexandrian alchemy has not yet been solved, the sudden appearance of alchemical texts around the Christian era could be explained as the result of a meeting between the esoteric current represented by the Mysteries, neo-Pythagoreanism and neo-Orphism, astrology, the "wisdom of the East" in its various revelations, Gnosticism, etc. (this current was especially the concern of cultivated people, of the intelligentsia), and the "popular" traditions, which were the guardians of trade secrets and magical and technical systems of great antiquity. A similar phenomenon is found in China with Taoism and neo-Taoism and in India with Tantrism and Hatha Yoga. In the Mediterranean world these "popular" traditions had continued into the Hellenistic period a spiritual behavior that is archaic in structure. As we saw (§ 209), the growing interest in the traditional techniques and sciences having to do with substances, precious stones, and plants is characteristic of this whole period of antiquity.
54. See Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible, pp. 127 ff.



302 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
To what historical causes are we to attribute the birth of alchemical practices? Doubtless we shall never know. But it is not likely that alchemy became an autonomous discipline on the basis of recipes for counterfeiting or imitating gold. The Hellenistic East had inherited all of its metallurgical techniques from Mesopotamia and Egypt, and we know that from the fourteenth century before our era the Mesopotamians had perfected the assaying of gold. Attempting to connect a discipline that has haunted the Western world for two thousand years with efforts to counterfeit gold is to forget the extraordinary knowledge of metals and alloying that the ancients possessed; it is also to underestimate their intellectual and spiritual capabilities. Transmutation, the chief end of Hellenistic alchemy, was pot an absurdity in the contemporary condition of science, for the unity of matter had been a dogma of Greek philosophy for some time. But it is hard to believe that alchemy came out of experiments undertaken to validate that dogma and provide experimental proof of the unity of matter. It does not look as if a spiritual technique and a soteriology could have had their source in a philosophical theory. On the other hand, when the Greek intelligence applied itself to science, it demonstrated an extraordinary sense ofobservation and reasoning. Now what strikes us in reading the texts of the Greek alchemists is precisely their lack of the scientific spirit. As Sherwood Taylor observes:
No one who had used sulphur, for example, could fail to remark the curious phenomena which attend its fusion and the subsequent heating of the liquid. Now while sulphur is mentioned hundreds of times, there is no allusion to any of its characteristic properties except its action on metals. This is in such strong contrast to the spirit of the Greek science of classical times that we must conclude that the alchemists were not interested in natural phenomena other than those which might help them to attain their object. Nevertheless, we should err were we to regard them as mere gold-seekers, for the semireligious and mystical tone, especially of the later works, con
sorts ill with the spirit of the seeker of riches . . . . At no time does the alchemist employ a scientific procedure.55
55. F. Sherwood Taylor, A Survey of Greek Alchemy, p. 110. See also, by the same author, "Origins of Greek Alchemy," pp. 42 iI.



Hellenistic alchemy 303
The texts of the ancient alchemists show "that these men were not really interested in making gold and were not in fact talking about gold at all. The practical chemist examining these works feels like a builder who should try to get practical information from a work on Freemasonry" (Taylor, A Survey, p. 138).
So if alchemy could arise neither from the wish to counterfeit gold (assaying gold had been known for at least twelve centuries) nor from a Greek technique (we have just seen the alchemists' lack of interest in physico-chemical phenomena as such), we are forced to look elsewhere for the "origins" of this unique discipline. Far rather than the philosophical theory of the unity of matter, it is probably the old conception of the Earth Mother bearing minerals as embryos in her womb (see § 15) that crystallized belief in an artificial transmutation, that is, a transmutation performed in a laboratory. It is contact with the symbolisms, mythologies, and techniques of miners, smelters, and smiths that in all probability gave rise to the earliest alchemical operations. But it is above all the experimental discovery of living substance, as it was felt to be by artisans, that must have played the decisive part. Indeed, it is the conception of a complex and dramatic life of matter that constitutes the originality of alchemy in contrast to classical Greek science. We have good reason to suppose that the experience of the dramatic life of matter was made possible by knowledge of the Greco-Oriental Mysteries. The scenario of the "sufferings," "death," and "resurrection" of matter is documented in Greco-Egyptian alchemical literature from its beginning. Transmutation, the opus magnum whose result is the Philosopher's Stone, is obtained by making matter pass through four phases, denominated, in accordance with the colors the ingredients assume, melansis (becoming black), leukansis (white), xanthosis (yellow), and iosis (red). "Black" (the nigredo of medieval authors) symbolizes "death." But it must be emphasized that the four phases of the opus are already documented in the Physika kai Mystika of the pseudo-Democritus, hence in the earliest properly alchemical text (second-first centuries B.C.). With countless variants, the four (or five) phases of the work (nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo, sometimes viriditas, sometimes cauda pavonis) are maintained through the entire history of Arabic and Western alchemy.



304 HELLENISTIC SYNCRETISM AND CREATIVITY
Even more to the point: it is the mystical drama of the godhis passion, his death, his resurrection-that is projected on matter in order to transmute it. In short, the alchemist treats matter as the divinity was treated in the Mysteries: the mineFal substances "suffer," "die," and "are reborn" to another mode of being, that is, are transmuted. In his Treatise on the Art (3. 1. 2-3) Zosimus reports a vision that he had in a dream: a personage named Ion reveals to him that he was wounded by a sword, cut to pieces, beheaded, flayed, and burned by fire, and that he suffered all this "in order to be able to change his body into spirit." When he woke, Zosimus asked himself if all that he had seen in his dream did not refer to the alchemical process of the combination of ~ater, if Ion was not the figure, the exemplary image, of Water. As Jung has shown, the Water is the aqua permanens of the alchemists, and its "tortures" by fire correspond to the operation of separatio.56 It should be noted not only that Zosimus' description is reminiscent of the dismemberment of Dionysus and the other' 'dying gods" of the Mysteries (whose "passion" can, on a certain plane, be homologized with various moments of the vegetable cycle, especially the torture, death, and resurrection of the "Corn Spirit") but that it exhibits striking analogies with the initiatory visions of shamans and, in general, with the fundamental schema of all archaic initiations. In shamanic initiations the ordeals, though undergone "at a remove," are sometimes extremely cruel: the future shaman is present in dream at his own dismemberment, beheading, and death.57 If we bear in mind the universality of this initiatory schema and, on the other hand, the solidarity among metalworkers, smiths, and shamans, and if we consider that the ancient Mediterranean brotherhoods of metallurgists and smiths very probably had their own Mysteries, we are led to place Zosimus' vision in a spiritual universe typical of the traditional societies. With this, we become aware of the great innovation of the alchemists: they projected on matter the initiatory function of suffering. By virtue of alchemical operations, homologized with the "tortures," "death," and "resur

rection" of the mystes, substance is transmuted, that is, obtains a transcendental mode of being: it becomes "Gold." Gold, we know, is the symbol of immortality. So alchemical transmutation is equivalent to perfecting matter58 and, for the alchemist, to the accomplishment of his "initiation." In the traditional cultures, minerals and metals were regarded as living organisms, having their gestation, growth, and birth, even their marriages (§ tt5). The Greco-Oriental alchemists took over and revalorized all of these archaic beliefs. The alchemical combination of sulphur and mercury is almost always expressed in terms of "marriage." But this marriage is also a mystical union between two cosmological principles. Therein lies the novelty of the alchemical point of view: the life of matter is no longer expressed in terms of "vital" hierophanies, as it was from the point of view of archaic man; instead it acquires a "spiritual" dimension. In other words, by assuming the initiatory meaning of the spirit's drama and suffering, matter also assumes the destiny of spirit. The' 'initiatory ordeals" that, on the plane of spirit, result in freedom, illumination, and immortality, lead, on the plane ofmatter, to transmutation, to the Philosopher's Stone. This daring revalorization of an immemorial mythico-ritual scenario (the gestation and growth of minerals in the womb of the Earth Mother; the furnace assimilated to a new telluric womb, where the mineral completes its gestation; the miner and the metallurgist taking the place of the Earth Mother in hastening and perfecting the "growth" of minerals) could be compared to the "transmutation" of the old agrarian cults into Mystery religions. We shall later evaluate the consequences of this effort to "spiritualize" matter, to "transmute" it.59
58. C. G. Jung. Psychology and Alchemy. pp. 222 ff.. speaks of the redemption. by the alchemical work, of the anima mundi. captive in matter. This conception. which is Gnostic in origin and structure, was certainly held by certain alchemists; in any case, it is consonant with this whole current of eschatological thought, which was to end in the conception ofthe apocatastasis of the cosmos. But, at least in its beginnings, alchemy did not postulate the captivity of the anima mundi in matter, though the latter was still obscurely felt as being the Terra Mater-the Earth Mother. 59.

27 New Iranian Syntheses
212. Religious orientations under the Arsacids (ca. 247 B.C. to 226 A.D.)
After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (ca. 330 B.C.) Iranian religion was drawn into the vast and complex syncretistic movement that is characteristic of the Hellenistic period (see § 205). The reconquest of the independence of a part of Iran by the Parthian chief Arsaces, who, by proclaiming himself king (ca. 247), founded the new national dynasty of the Arsacids. did not halt this process. To be sure, the Parthians brought with them a whole religious and cultural tradition originated by the horsemen of the steppes, and it is very probable that certain elements of the royal ideology that began to define themselves after the Arsacids took power represent the heritage of these unconquerable tribes, who for centuries had led a nomadic life on the margin of the great empires. But the attraction of Hellenism proved irresistible, and, at least until the first century A.D., the Arsacids encouraged Hellenization (likenesses of the Greek gods are engraved on their coins). We must, however, remember that the model they sought to imitate, Alexandrian Hellenism, had itself absorbed a number of Semitic and Asian elements. The contemporary documents are numerous and of many kinds: writings by Greek and Latin authors. monuments. inscriptions, coins. But the information they supply concerning Iranian religious beliefs and ideas is rather disappointing. The religious creativity under the Arsacids can be better perceived by the help of later documents. Recent researchers have shown that late texts express beliefs and ideas articulated or valorized



Religious orientations under the Arsacids 307
during the Parthian period. Moreover, this was the way of the age: after numberless cultural confrontations and exchanges, new religious forms arose out of earlier conceptions. Essentially, the sources show us (1) that Mithra was worshiped throughout the Empire and that he had a special relation to the kings;· (2) that the Magi made up the caste of sacrificing priests, especially performing the sacrifices involving the shedding of blood (cows and horses); Strabo writes that the Magi worshiped Anahita, but there are indications that they also took part in the cult of Mithra (they had a role in his Mysteries); (3) that the cult of fire was extremely popular; and (4) that in the second and first centuries B.C. an apocalypse written in Greek was in circulation under the title Oracles of Hystaspes (Hystaspes is the Greek form ofVishtaspa); it was directed against Rome (whose fall was announced) but formed part of the Iranian eschatological literature.2 However, the great religious creations of the Parthian period are of a different order. It was in the first century B.C. that the Mysteries of Mithra began to spread through the Mediterranean world (the earliest document dates from 67 B.C.); it is legitimate to conjecture that the same period (more or less) begins to define the idea of the messianic king, still in connection with a mythicoritual scenario elaborated around Mithra; despite controversies, it seems probable, as Widengren· has shown, that the myth of the savior, as it is presented in the Gnostic "Hymn of the Pearl," took shape in the period of the Arsacids. Finally, it was also this period that saw the development of the Zurvanite theology, with its elaboration of ideas concerning time, eternity, the precedence of the "spiritual" over the physical creation, and absolute dualism-conceptions that were to be systematized and sometimes laboriously organized some centuries later, under the Sassanids.
I. The deification of living sovereigns, a phenomenon characteristic of the Hellenistic period, is also documented among the Arsacids; at least three examples are known. See J. Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de /'Iran ancien, pp. 225, with bibliography (English trans., by K. M. JamaspAsa, Religion of Ancient Iran [Bombay, 1973]). 2. J. Bidez and F.

308 NEW IRANIAN SYNTHESES
It is important not to lose sight of the fundamental solidarity among all these religious forms. The variety of their expressions is explained by the differences in the ends sought. It would be useless, for example, to look for elements of the royal ideology in the concurrent manifestations of the popular religion or in theological speculations. A characteristic common to all these creations is the fact that, while they continue conceptions that are earlier, sometimes even archaic, they remain "open" in the sense that they go on developing during the following centuries. The Oracles ofHystaspes take up classical eschatological motifs, probably of Indo-Iranian origin (the shortening of the year, universal decadence, the final battle, etc.), that will be elaborated in the Pahlavi apocalypse of the Sassanid period, first of all in the Bahman Yast. On the other hand, the Oracles justify their prophecies on the basis of an eschatological chronology of 7,000 years, each millennium being dominated by a planet, which shows Babylonian influence (cf. the well-known series: seven planets, seven metals, seven colors, etc.). But the interpretation of this chronological schema is Iranian: during the first six millennia, God and the Spirit of Evil fight for supremacy; Evil appears to be victorious; God sends the solar god Mithra (= Apollo, Helios), who dominates the seventh millennium; at the end of this last period, the power of the planets ends and a universal conflagration renews the world.3 Now these mytho-chronologies with eschatological aims will have a great popularity in the Western world at the beginning of the Christian era. The eschatological hope can also be deciphered in the traditions regarding the birth of a king-savior, assimilated to Mithra. The traditional conception of the divine king and cosmocrator, mediator between men and gods, is enriched by new soteriological meanings-a process easy to understand in a period dominated by expectation of the savior. The fabulous biography of Mithradates Eupator admirably illustrates this eschatological hope: his birth is announced by a comet; lightning strikes the newborn infant but leaves only a scar; the future king's education amounts to a long series of initiatory ordeals; when he is

crowned, Mithradates (like so many other kings) is held to be an incarnation of Mithra.4 A similar messianic scenario animates the Christian legend of the Nativity.
213. Zurvan and the origin of evil
The problems raised by Zurvan and Zurvanism are still far from being solved. The god is certainly archaic. 5 Ghirshman claims to have identified Zurvan in a bronze from Luristan representing the winged and androgynous god giving birth to twins (who emerge from his shoulders); three processions, symbolizing the three ages of man, bring him the barsom (bundle of twigs) in homage.6 If this interpretation is correct, it follows that the myth of Zurvan as father of Ohrmazd and Ahriman was already known at a time long before that of the earliest written testimonies. According to the information supplied by Eudemus of Rhodes (second half of the fourth century B.C.), "the Magi ... call the one and intelligible All sometimes 'Space,' sometimes 'Time'; therefrom are said to be born Ohrmazd and Ahriman, that is, Light and Darkness."7 This information is important: it assures us that, toward the end of the Achaemenid period, speculations on time-space as the common source of the two principles, Good and Evil, incarnated in Ohrmazd and Ahriman, were familiar to the Iranians. The Avestan term for "time" is thW(lSa, literally "the in-haste one" or "he who hurries," and Widengren thinks that from the beginning it designated the celestial vault, an epithet proper to

310 NEW IRANIAN SYNTHESES
a celestial god who determines destinies.s So it is probable that Zurvan was originally a celestial god, source of time and distributor of good and evil fortune-in the last analysis, master of destiny.9 In any case, Zurvan's structure is archaic: he is reminiscent of certain primitive divinities in whom cosmic polarities and all kinds of antagonisms coexist. In the late Avesta (texts probably redacted in the fourth century B.C.) Zurvan is seldom mentioned, but he is always related to time or destiny. One text (Videvddt 19. 29) states that before reaching the Cinvat Bridge (see § 103), "created by Mazda," the souls ofthejust and the impious advance along "the road created by Zurvan." The eschatological function of time/destiny-in other words, of the temporal duration granted to each individual-is clearly emphasized. In another passage Zurvan is presented as infinite time (Videvddt 19. 13 and 16); elsewhere a distinction is made between Zurvan akarana, "infinite time," and Zurvan darego xvadhdta, "long autonomous time" (Yast 72. 10). All this presupposes a theory of temporal duration pouring from the breast of eternity. In the Pahlavi works, "long autonomous time" emerges from "infinite time" and, after lasting 12,000 years, returns to it (Bundahisn I. 20; Denkart 282). The theory of cycles made up of a certain number of millennia is ancient, but it was differently expressed in India, Iran, and Mesopotamia. Although it became popular toward the end of antiquity and was used in countless apocalypses and prophecies, the theory of millennia was particularly developed in Iran, especially in Zurvanite circles. In fact, speculations on time and destiny are frequent in Zurvanite writings: they are used to explain both the origin of evil and its present predominance in the world and to propose a stricter solution to the problem of dualism.

9. Since, according to Eudemus, Zurvan was worshiped by the Magi-that is, originally in the land of the Medes-it is difficult to decide whether Zarathustra's silence is explained by polemical reasons or simply denotes the small importance, perhaps even the absence, of this god of time and destiny in the prophet's circles.



Zurvan and the origin of evil 311
In his treatise on Isis and Osiris (secs. 46-47), Plutarch, using fourth-century B.C. sources, reports the doctrine of the "Magus .Zoroaster": "Oromazdes, born of the purest light," and "Aremanos, born of darkness"; each wields power for 3,000 years, then they fight each other for another 3,000 years. The belief that the world will last for 9,000 years, divided into three equal periods (Ohrmazd's domination gives place to Ahriman's, which is followed by 3,000 years of warfare), occurs in a late treatise that is full of Zurvanite elements, the Men6k i Khrat (7. 11). Since Zoroastrianism excludes the idea of a period ruled by Ahril1)an, it is probable that the sources used by Plutarch refer to Zurvanistic conceptions. In addition, Plutarch writes that Mithra, who is placed between Ohrmazd and Ahriman (this is why he is called "mediator"), had taught the Persians to offer these gods characteristic sacrifices, an offering of the chthonicinfernal type being intended for the "Evil Demon"-which is not a Zoroastrian conception either. 10 Plutarch does not mention Zurvan, but the myth of the Twins and the explanation oftheir alternating sovereignty are presented in several late sources as being specifically Zurvanistic. According to an Armenian Church Father, Eznik of Kolb, when nothing existed, Zurvan ("Zrwan, which means 'Destiny' or 'Glory' ") had for a thousand years offered a sacrifice in order to have a son.l l And because he had doubted the efficacy of his sacrifice ("What use can the sacrifice that I offer be?"), he conceived two sons: Ohrmazd "by virtue of the offered sacrifice" and Ahriman "by virtue of the above-mentioned doubt." Zurvan decided that the first to be born should be king. Ohrmazd knew his father's thought and revealed it to Ahriman. The latter tore open the wombl2 and emerged. But when he told Zurvan that he

But other late authors speak of Zurvan's "mother" or "wife"; see Zaehner, Zurvan, pp. 63 if., 423, 428. See other texts of Eznik and ofTheodore bar Konai, reproduced in Bidez and Cumont, Les Mages, vol. 2, pp. 89-92, and in Zaehner, Zurvan, pp. 421 if.; for discussion of them, see Zaehner, pp. 54 if.

was his son, Zurvan replied: "My son is perfumed and luminous, and thou, thou art dark and stinking." Then Ohrmazd was born, "luminous and sweet-smelling," and Zurvan wanted to consecrate him king. But Ahriman reminded him of his vow to make his firstborn son king. In order not to break his oath, Zurvan granted him the kingship for 9,000 years, after which Ohrmazd should reign. Then, Eznik goes on, Ohrmazd and Ahriman "fell to making creatures. And all that Ohrmazd created was good and straight, and what Ahriman made was evil and crooked." It should be noted that both gods are creators, although Ahriman's creation is entirely evil. Now this negative contribution to the cosmogonic work (mountains, snakes, noxious animals, etc.) is an essential element in many popular cosmogonic myths and legends, disseminated from eastern Europe to Siberia,13 in which God's Adversary plays a part. As the important Pahlavi treatise the Greater Bundahisn (3.20) expresses it, "By the performance of sacrifice, all creation was created." Both this conception and the myth of Zurvan are certainly Indo-Iranian, for they are also found in India. To obtain a son, Prajapati offered the diik~iiyalJa sacrifice,14 and he, too, as he sacrificed, felt a doubt (' 'Ought I to offer? Ought I not to offer?"). Now Prajapati is the Great God who produces the universe from his own body, and he also represents the year, the temporal cycle (§ 76). Doubt, with its disastrous consequences, constitutes a ritual error. Hence, evil is the result of a technical accident, of an inadvertence on the part of the divine sacrificer. The Evil One does not possess an ontological condition of his own: he is dependent on his involuntary author, who, furthermore, hastens to limit, in advance, the terms of his existence. The mythological theme of the fateful consequences of doubt has numerous parallels in the myths-documented more or less allover the world-that explain the origin of death or of evil by lack of vigilance or foresight on the part of the Creator. The difference from the earlier conception, also held by Zarathustra, is plain: Ahura Mazda engenders the two spirits, but the Evil Spiritfreely chooses his mode ofbeing (see § 103). Thus the Wise

The eschatological function of time 313
Lord is not directly responsible for the appearance of evil. Similarly, in many archaic religions the supreme being comprises a coincidentia oppositorum, since he constitutes the totality of the real. But in the Zurvanite myth, as in other myths of the same tenor, evil is produced, although involuntarily, by the Great God himself. In any case, at least in the tradition transmitted by Eznik, Zurvan plays no part in the cosmic creation; he himself recognizes that he is a deus otiosus, since he offers his twin sons the symbols of sovereignty (the barsom to Ohrmazd and, to Ahriman, according to the Pahlavi book Zatspram, "a tool made of the proper substance of shadow").
214. The eschatological function of time
Insofar as it is possible for us to orient ourselves among the successive strata of the Pahlavi texts and their rehandlings (made when Mazdaism became the official church of the Sassanian Empire [226-635] and even after the Moslem conquest), Zurvanism appears to be a syncretistic theology, elaborated by the Median Magi,15 rather than an independent religion. In fact, no sacrifices are offered to Zurvan. What is more, this primordial god is always mentioned in association with Ohrmazd and Ahriman. But it must also be made clear that the doctrine of millennia always, in one way or another, involved Zurvan-whether as cosmic god of time or simply as symbol or personification of time. The 9,000 or 12,000 years that make up the history of the world are interpreted in relation to the actual person of Zurvan. According to certain Syriac sources,16 Zurvan is surrounded by three gods-in reality, his hypostases, Asoqar, Frasoqar, Zaroqar. These names are explained by the Avestan epithets arSokara ("the one who makes virile"), frasokara ("the one who makes

splendid"), and marsokara ("the one who makes 0Id").17 Obviously, the reference is to time as lived, as it can be perceived in the three stages of human existence: youth, maturity, and old age. On the cosmic plane, each of these three temporal moments can be connected with a period of 3,000 years. This "formula of the three times" can be found in the Upanishads and in Homer.18 On the other hand, a similar formula is used in the Pahlavi texts; for example, Ohrmazd "is, was, and will be," and it is said that the "time of Ohrmazd," zaman i Ohrmazd, "was, is, and will always be." 19 But Zurvan (= Zaman) is also he "who was and will be all things."2o In short"temporal images and symbolisms are documented in both Zorastrian and Zurvanite contexts. The same situation obtains in regard to the 12,000-year cycle. It plays a part in Zurvanite speculations. Zurvan is presented as a god with four faces, and different cosmological tetrads serve to circumscribe him, as befits an ancient celestial god of time and destiny.21 If we recognize Zurvan in "unlimited time," zaman i akaniirak, it appears that he transcends Ohrmazd and Ahriman, since it is proclaimed that "Time is stronger than the two creations."22 We can follow the polemics between Mazdean orthodoxy, which had progressively hardened its dualism, and the Zurvanite theology. The idea that Ohrmazd and Ahriman are brothers engendered by Zurvan is naturally condemned in a passage in the Denkart.23 This is why the problem of the origin of the two adversaries is not raised in the orthodox Pahlavi books. Ohrmazd and Ahriman exist from eternity, but the Adversary will cease to be at a certain moment in the future. We understand, then,

why time and the doctrine of millennia are of prime importance for the Mazdeans too. According to Mazdean theology, time is not only indispensable for the Creation; it also makes possible the destruction of Ahriman and the banishing of evil.24 In fact, Ohrmazd created the world in order to conquer and annihilate evil. The cosmology already presupposes an eschatology and a soteriology. This is why cosmic time is no longer circular but linear: it has a beginning and will have an end. Temporal duration is the indirect consequence of Ahriman's attack. By creating linear and limited time as the interval in which the battle against evil will take place, Ohrmazd gave it both a meaning (an eschatology) and a dramatic structure (a war continued without interruption until the final victory). This is as much as to say that he created limited time as sacred history. It is, in fact, the great originality of Mazdean thought that it interpreted the cosmogony, the anthropogony, and Zarathustra's preaching as moments constituting one and the same sacred history.
215. The two Creations: menok and getik
According to the first chapter of the Bundahisn, Ohrmazd and Ahriman exist from eternity; but whereas Ohrmazd, infinite in time, is delimited by Ahriman in space, Ahriman is limited in both space and time, for at a certain moment he will cease to exist. In other words, in Mazdaism God is originally finite, since he is circumscribed by his opposite, Ahriman.25 This situation would have continued for eternity if Ahriman had not attacked. Ohrmazd counterattacks by creating the world, which enables him also to become infinite in space. Thus Ahriman contributes to the perfection of Ohrmazd. In other words, unconsciously and involuntarily, Evil advances the triumph of Good-a con
24. In the Bundahisn 1. 1 (see Zaehner, The Teachings of the Magi. p. 35), Ohrmazd has three more names: Time. Space, and Religion. The quaternity is adapted from Zurvanism, but it is necessary to explain the Creation; see Duchesne-Guillemin, pp. 309-10.

316 NEW IRANIAN SYNTHESES
ception that is rather often encountered in history and that aroused Goethe's impassioned interest. In his omniscience, Ohrmazd foresees the attack and produces an "ideal" or "spiritual" Creation. The term employed, rnenok, is hard to translate, for it refers both to a perfect and to an embryonic world. According to the Diitastiin i Denik (37. 3 ff.), what is rnenok is perfect, and the Denkart (9. 37. 5) states that the world was immortal in the beginning. On the other hand, the Bundahisn O. 6) describes the Creation in the rnenok state, during the 3,000 years that it lasted, as being "without thought, without motion, impalpable."26 But it is, above all, the celestial and spiritual character of the rnenok state that is emphasized. "I have come from the celestial world (rnenok)," says a fourthcentury text; "it is not in the terrestrial world (getik) that I began to be. I was originally manifested in the spiritual state; my original state is not the terrestrial state."27 It must be made clear, however, that there is no question here of an abstract existence, of a world of Platonic Ideas: the rnenok state can be defined as a mode of being that is at once spiritual and concrete. Four stages are distinguished in the cosmic drama and the history of the world. During the earliest period, the attack by Ahriman and darkness against Ohrmazd's world of light takes place. (We here have a dualism that is acosmic, for in Zarathustra's doctrine Ahura Mazda is the creator of both light and darkness; see Yasna 44.5.) Before transposing the Creation from the spiritual state (rnenok) to the material state (getik), Ohrmazd asks the Fravashis (preexisting spirits dwelling in Heaven) ifthey will accept a corporeal existence, on earth, in order to combat the forces of evil,28 and the Fravashis consent. This testifies to the attachment for incarnate life, for work, and, in the last analysis, for matter-an attachment that is a specific characteristic ofZarathustra's message.

riman's aggression, the material Creation (getik) was in itself good and perfect. It is only Ahriman's attack that corrupts it, by introducing evil. The result is the state of "mixture" (gumecisn) , which is thereafter that of the entire Creation, a state that will not disappear until after the final purification. Ahriman and his demonic troops spoil the material world by entering it and soiling it with their harmful creations, and especially by taking up residence in the bodies of men. Indeed, certain texts suggest that Ahriman does not reply to Ohrmazd's material Creation with a negative getik Creation: to ruin the world, he has only to enter it and dwell in it. "Consequently, when he shall no longer have his dwelling in the bodies of men, Ahriman will be eliminated from the entire world."30 Ahriman's aggression is described in moving terms: he tears the periphery of Heaven, enters the material world (getik), pollutes the waters, poisons vegetation, and thus causes the death of the primordial Bul}.31 He attacks Gayomart, the First Man, and the Prostitute befouls him and, through him, all men. (However, Gayomart was predestined to live for thirty more years after the aggression.) After that, Ahriman throws himself on the sacred fire and soils it, making it smoke. But at the height of his power Ahriman is still captive in the material world, for, by closing itself, Heaven shuts him up in the material Creation, as in a trap.32
216. From Gayomart to Saoshyant

the metals proceed from his body; his semen is purified by the light of the sun, and a third of it falls to the ground and produces the rhubarb, from which the first human pair, Masye and Masyane, will be born. In other words, the primordial couple is born from the mythical Ancestor (Gayomart) and the Earth Mother, and their first form is vegetable-a mythologem rather widely disseminated in the world. Ohrmazd orders them to do good, not to worship the demons, and to abstain from food. Though Masye and Masyane proclaim Ohrmazd the Creator, they yield to Ahriman's temptations and exclaim that he is the author of the earth, water, and plants. Because of this' 'lie," the pair is damned, and their souls will remain in Hell until the resurrection. For thirty days they live without food, but then they suck the milk of a she-goat and pretend to dislike it; this was a second lie, which strengthened the demons. This mythical episode can be interpreted in two ways: as illustrating (1) the sin of lying or (2) the sin of having eaten, that is, of establishing the human condition (in a number of archaic myths the primordial pair has no need of food, and, what is more, according to Iranian belief, at the end of time men will forgo the practice of eating and drinking).33 After thirty more days Masye and Masyane slaughter a head of cattle and roast it. They offer part of it to the fire and another part to the gods, throwing it into the air; but a vulture carries off this part. (Soon afterward a dog is the first to eat flesh.) This may mean that God has not accepted the offering, but it may also mean that man is not meant to be carnivorous. For fifty years Masye and Masyane feel no sexual desire. But they copulate, and a pair of twins is born, "so delicious" that the mother eats one of them, and the father eats the other. Then Ohrmazd takes away the flavor of children so that their parents
will thenceforth let them live.34 After that, Masye and Masyane have other pairs of twins, who become the ancestors of all the human races.

From Gay6mart to Saoshyant 319
The myth of Gayomart (Avestan gaya maretan, "mortal life") is highly significant for an understanding of the Zoroastrian theologians' reinterpretation of the traditional mythology. Like Ymir or Puru~a, Gayomart is a primordial and androgynous macranthropos, but his slaying is differently valorized. It is no longer the whole of the world that is created from his body but only the metals-in other words, the planets-and, from his semen, the rhubarb that engenders the first human pair. Just as, in late Jewish speculation, Adam is endowed both with cosmological attributes and with eminent spiritual virtues, Gayomart is raised to an exceptional position. In Mazdean sacred history he ranks close to Zarathustra and Saoshyant. In fact, in the material Creation (gete), Gayomart is the first to receive the revelation
of the Good Religion.35 And, since he survived Ahriman's aggression by thirty years, he was able to transmit the revelations to Masye and Masyane, who then communicated it to their descendants. Mazdean theology proclaims Gayomart to be the Just and Perfect Man, equal to Zarathustra and Saoshyant.36 The work of late theologians, the glorification of Gayomart ends by redeeming the human condition. Man, in fact, was created good and endowed with a soul and an immortal body, just like Gayomart. Death was introduced into the material world by Ahriman, in consequence ofthe Ancestor's sin. But, as Zaehner observes,37 for Zoroastrianism the original sin is less an act of disobedience than an error of judgment: the Ancestors were mistaken in considering Ahriman the Creator. Nevertheless, Ahriman did not succeed in killing Gayomart's soul or, in consequence, the souls of men. Now man's soul is Ohrmazd's most powerful ally; for in the material world only man possesses free will. But the soul can act only through the body that it inhabits; the body is the instrument or "garment" of the soul. What is more, the body is not made of darkness (as the Gnostics affirm) but of the same substance as the soul; in the beginning the body was shining and sweet-smelling, but concupiscence made it stink

ing. However, after the eschatological Judgment, the soul will recover a resuscitated and glorious body.38 In short, by virtue of his freedom to choose between good and evil, man not only insures his salvation, but he can collaborate in Ohrmazd's work of redemption. As we saw (§ 104), every sacrificer contributes to the "transfiguration" of the world by reestablishing in his own person the condition of purity that preceded the "mixture" (gilmecisn) produced by Ahriman's attack. For, in the eyes of Mazdaism, the material Creation-that is, matter and life-is good in itself and worthy to be purified and restored. Indeed, the doctrine of the resurrection of bodies proclaims the inestimable value of the Creation. This is the most rigorous and the most daring religious valorization of matter that we know of before the Western chemist-philosophers of the seventeenth century (see vol. 3). During the 3,000 years that separate the murder of Gayomart and the emergence of the primordial couple from the coming of Zarathustra, there was a series of legendary reigns, the most famous of which are those ofYim (Yima), Aidahak, and Freton. Zarathustra appears at the center ofhistory, at an equal distance from Gayomart and from the future savior, Saoshyant. (According to a tradition of the fourth century A.D., Saoshyant will be born of a virgin who will bathe in Lake Kasaoya, in whose waters Zarathustra's semen is miraculously preserved.) As we saw (§§ 104, 112) the final Renovation lfraso-kereti) will take place after a sacrifice performed by Saoshyant. The Pahlavi books give more detailed descriptions of the episodes of this eschatological scenario. First, during the final three millennia, men will gradually abstain from meat, milk, and plants, until their only food is water. According to the Bundahisn, this is precisely what happens in the case of the aged, who are nearing their end. The eschatology, in fact, repeats, in order to annul them, the deeds and gestures of the Ancestors. That is why the demoness Az (Covetousness), having no more power over men, will be forced to devour demons. Ahriman's murder of the primordial Bull will have its counterpart in the eschatological sacrifice of

the ox Hathayos, performed by Saoshyant and Ohrmazd. The drink prepared from its fat or its marrow, mixed with white haoma, will make resuscitated men immortal. As First Man, Gayomart will be the first to be resuscitated. The battles that took place in the beginning will be repeated: the dragon AZdahiik will reappear, and it is required that Freton, who had conquered it in ilIo tempore, will be resuscitated. In the final battle the two armies will face each other, each combatant having his precisely determined adversary. Ahriman and Az will be the last to fall, under the blows of Ohrmazd and Sroz.39 According to some sources, Ahriman is reduced to impotence forever; according to others, he is thrust back into the hole through which he had entered the world, and there he is annihilated.40 A gigantic conflagration makes the metals of the mountains flow, and in this stream of fire-burning for the wicked, like warm milk for the just-the resuscitated bodies are purified for three days. The heat finally makes the mountains vanish, the valleys are filled, and the openings that communicate with Hell are blocked. (A flattened earth is, as we know, the image of the paradisal world, primordial as well as eschatological.) After the Renovation, men, freed from the danger of sinning, will live eternally, enjoying bliss that is at once carnal (e.g., families will be reunited) and spiritual.

is the first explicit reference to the Mysteries of Mithra.41 We do not know by what process the Iranian god glorified by the Mihryast (see § 109) was transformed into the Mithra of the Mysteries. Probably his cult developed in the circle of the Magi established in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. Supremely a tutelary or champion god, Mithra had become the protector of the Parthian sovereigns. The funerary monument of Antiochus I of Commagene (69-34 B.C.) shows the god clasping the king's hand. But it seems that the royal cult of Mithra did not include any secret ritual; from the end of the Achaemenid period the great ceremonies known as the Mithrakana were celebrated publicly. The mythology and theology of the Mithraic Mysteries are accessible to us chiefly through figured monuments. Literary documents are few and for the most part refer to the cult and the hierarchy of the initiatory grades. One myth told of the birth of Mithra from a rock (de petra nlltus), just like the anthropomorphic being Ullikummi (§ 46), the Phrygian Agdistis (§ 207), and a celebrated hero of Ossetic mythology.4! This is why the cave played a primary part in the Mysteries of Mithra. On the other hand, according to a tradition transmitted by al-Biruni, on the eve of his enthronement the Parthian king retired to a cave, where his subjects approached and venerated him like a newborn
infant-more precisely, like an infant of supernatural origin.43 Armenian traditions tell of a cave in which Meher (i.e., Mihr, Mithra) shut himself up and from which he emerged once a year. In fact the new king was Mithra, reincarnated, born again. 44 This Iranian theme is found again in the Christian legends of the Nativity in the light-filled cave at Bethlehem.45 In short, Mithra's miraculous birth was an integral part of a great Irano-syncretistic myth of the cosmocrator-redeemer.

The Mysteries of Mithra 323
The essential mythological episode involves the theft of the bull by Mithra and its sacrifice, undertaken (to judge from certain monuments) by order of the Sun (Sol). The immolation of the bull is depicted on almost all the Mithraic bas-reliefs and paintings. Mithra performs his mission unwillingly; turning his head away, he grasps the bull's nostrils with one hand and plunges the knife into its side with the other. "From the body of the dying victim were born all herbs and health-giving plants .... From its spinal marrow sprouted bread-bestowing wheat, from its blood the vine, which produces the sacred drink of the mysteries."46 In the Zoroastrian context, Mithra's sacrifice of the bull appears enigmatic. As we saw (§ 215), the murder of the primordial Bull is the work of Ahriman. A late text (Bundahisn 6. E. 1-4), however, reports beneficent effects from this immolation: from the primordial Bull's semen, purified by the light of the moon, the animal species are born and the plants grow from its body. From the morphological point of view, this "creative murder" is explained better as part of an agrarian religion than of an initiatory cultY On the other hand, as we have just seen (§ 216), at the end of time the ox Hathay6s will be sacrificed by Saoshyant and Ohrmazd, and the drink produced from its fat or its marrow will make men immortal. So Mithra's exploit could be compared with this eschatological sacrifice; in that case, it could be said that initiation into the Mysteries anticipated the
final Renovation, in other words, the salvation of the mystes.48 The immolation of the bull takes place in the cave in the presence of the Sun and the Moon. The cosmic structure of the sacrifice is indicated by the. twelve signs of the zodiac, or the seven planets, and the symbols of the winds and the four seasons. Two personages, Cautes and Cautopates, dressed as Mithra and

Windischmann (1859), several Iranologists have noted the striking similarities between Mithra and Saoshyant. See, most recently, Hinnells, ibid., p. 311 (bibliography in n. 132).



324 NEW IRANIAN SYNTHESES
each holding a lighted torch, watch the god's exploit attentively; they represent two other epiphanies of Mithra as solar god (indeed, Pseudo-Dionysius speaks of the "triple Mithra," Epist. 7). The relations between Sol and Mithra raise a problem that has not yet been solved; on the one hand, though he is inferior to Mithra, Sol orders him to sacrifice the bull; on the other hand, the inscriptions term Mithra "Sol invictus." Certain scenes present Sol kneeling before Mithra; others show the gods clasping hands. However this may be, Mithra and Sol seal their friendship by a banquet in which they share the flesh of the bull. The feast takes place in the cosmic cave. The two gods are served by persons wearing animal masks. This banquet constitutes the model for ritual meals, at which the mystai, wearing masks that indicate their initiatory grades, serve the chief (pater) of the conventicle. It is assumed that Sol's ascension to Heaven, a scene depicted in several bas-reliefs, takes place soon afterward. In his turn, Mithra mounts to the sky; some images show him running behind the Sun's chariot. Mithra is the only god who does not suffer the same tragic destiny as the gods of the other Mysteries, so we may conclude that the scenario of Mithraic initiation did not include ordeals suggesting death and resurrection. Before their initiation the postulants undertook on oath (sacramentum) to keep the secret of the Mysteries. A passage in Saint Jerome (Ep. 107, ad Laetam) and a number of inscriptions have supplied us with the nomenclature ofthe seven grades ofinitiation: Crow (corax), Bride (nymphus), Soldier (miles), Lion (leo), Persian (Perses), Courier of the Sun (heliodromus), and Father (pater). Admission to the first grades was granted even to children from the age of seven; presumably they received a certain religious education and learned chants and hymns. The community of the mystai was divided into two groups: the "servitors" and the "participants," the latter group being made up of initiates of the grade of leo or higher. 49 We know nothing of the initiations into the different grades. In their polemic against the Mithraic "sacraments" (inspired by

Satan!), the Christian apologists refer to a "baptism," which presumably introduced the neophyte into his new life. 50 Probably this rite was reserved for a neophyte preparing for the grade miles.51 We know that he was offered a crown, but the mystes had to refuse it, saying that Mithra "was his only crown."52 He was then marked on the forehead with a redhot iron (Tertullian, De praescr. haeret. 40) or purified with a burning torch (Lucian, Menippus 7). In the initiation into the grade of leo, honey was poured on the candidate's hands and his tongue was smeared with it. Now honey was the food of the blessed and of newborn infantsY According to a Christian author of the fourth century, the candidates' eyes were blindfolded, and a frantic troop then surrounded them, some imitating the cawing ofcrows and the beating of their wings, others roaring like lions. Some candidates, their hands tied with the intestines of chickens, had to jump over a ditch filled with water. Then someone appeared with a sword, cut the intestines, and announced himself as the liberator.54 Initiation scenes depicted in paintings in the mithraeum at Capua probably represent some of these initiatory ordeals. Cumont describes one of the best-preserved of these scenes as follows: "The naked mystes is seated, with his eyes blindfolded and his

(The crow, be it said, is the messenger who brings Mithra the Sun's order to immolate the bull.) The emblems belonging to the grade of nymphus were a torch (the marriage torch), a diadem (allusion to Venus), and a lamp, symbol of the "new light" thenceforth accessible to the mystes. 52.

hands perhaps bound behind his back. The mystagogue approaches him from behind, as if to push him forward. Facing him, a priest in Oriental dress, with a high Phrygian cap on his head, comes forward, holding out a sword. In other scenes the naked mystes kneels or even lies on the f100r."55 We also know that the mystes had to be present at a simulated murder, and he was shown a sword stained with the victim's bl()od."; Very probably, certain initiatory rituals involved fighting a bugbear. Indeed, the historian Lampridius writes that the Emperor Commodus desecrated the Mysteries of Mithra by an actual homicide (Commodus 9; Cumont, Textes et monuments, vol. 2, p. 21). Presumably in acting as "Father" in initiating a postulant into the grade of miles, Commodus in fact killed him when he was supposed only to simulate killing him. Each of the seven grades was protected by a planet: corax by Mercury, nymphus by Venus, miles by Mars, leo by Jupiter, Perses by the Moon, heliodromus by the Sun, and pater by Saturn. These astral relations are clearly illustrated in the mithraea at Santa Prisca and Ostia.57 On the other hand, Origen (Contra Celsum 6. 22) speaks of a ladder with seven rungs made of different metals (lead, tin, bronze, iron, alloy, silver, and gold) and associated with different divinities (lead with Kronos, tin with Aphrodite, etc.). Very probably such a ladder played a ritual part-a part of which we know nothing-while at the same time serving as a symbol for the Mithraic conventicle.

was impressed by the prestige and popularity that the Mysteries of Mithra enjoyed in the third and fourth centuries; he was certainly struck by their dissemination through all the provinces of the Roman Empire. In fact this new Mystery religion inspired respect by its power and originality. The secret cult of Mithra had succeeded in combining the Iranian heritage with GrecoRoman syncretism. In its pantheon the principal gods of the classical world rubbed shoulders with Zurvan and other Oriental divinities. In addition, the Mysteries of Mithra had assimilated and integrated the spiritual currents characteristic of the Imperial period: astrology, eschatological speculations, solar religion (interpreted, by the philosophers, as solar monotheism). Despite its Iranian heritage, its liturgical language was Latin. Unlike other Oriental religions of salvation, which were governed by an exotic body of priests (Egyptians, Syrians, Phoenicians), the chiefs of the Mysteries, the patres, were recruited among the Italic popUlations and those ofthe Roman provinces. In addition, Mithraism differed from the other Mysteries by the absence of orgiastic or monstrous rites. A religion especially of soldiers, the cult impressed the profane by the discipline, temperance, and morality of its members-virtues that were reminiscent of the old Roman tradition. As for the dissemination of Mithraism, it was immense: from Scotland to Mesopotamia, from North Africa and Spain to Central Europe and the Balkans. Most of its sanctuaries have been discovered in the old Roman provinces of Dacia, Pannonia, and Germania. (The cult appears not to have made its way into Greece or Asia Minor.) However, it must be taken into account that a conventicle accepted, at most, one hundred members. Consequently, even in Rome, where at a certain moment there were a hundred sanctuaries, the number of adepts did not number above 10,000.58 Mithraism was almost exclusively a secret cult reserved for soldiers; its dissemination followed the movements of the legions. The little that we do know of its initiatory rituals resembles the initiations into the Indo-European "men's societies" (see § 175) more than the initiations into the Egyptian or Phrygian Mysteries. For, as we have observed, Mithra was
58. See Widengren, "The Mithraic Mysteries," p. 453.



328 NEW IRANIAN SYNTHESES
the only god of Mysteries who had not suffered death. And, alone among the other secret cults, Mithraism did not admit women. Now at a time when the participation of women in cults of salvation had reached a degree never before known, such a prohibition made the conversion of the world to Mithraism difficult if not decidedly unlikely. Yet the Christian apologists feared the possible "competition" of Mithraism, for they saw in the Mysteries a diabolical imitation of the Eucharist. Justin (Apol. 66) accused the "evil demons" of having prescribed the sacramental use of bread and water; Tertullian (De praescr. 40) spoke of the "oblation of bread." In fact, the ritual meal of initiates commemorated the banquet of Mithra and Sol after the sacrifice of the bull. It is difficult to determine if, for Mithraic initiates, such feasts constituted a sacramental meal or if they were more like other ritual banquets that were common during the Imperial period.59 However this may be, there can be no denying the religious significance of the Mithraic banquets (or, for that matter, that of the other Mystery cults), since they followed a divine model. The mere fact that the Christian apologists vigorously denounced them as diabolical imitations of the Eucharist testifies to their sacred character. As for initiatory baptism, it was also practiced by other cults. But for the Christian theologians of the second and third centuries, the similarity with Mithraism here is even more disquieting, for the sign marked on the forehead with a hot iron reminded them ofthe signatio, the rite that completed the sacrament of baptism; in addition, from the second century on, the two religions celebrated the nativity of their God on the same day (December 25) and shared similar beliefs concerning the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the resurrection of bodies. But these beliefs and mythico-ritual scenarios belonged to the Zeitgeist of the Hellenistic and Roman period. In all probability the theologians of the various syncretistic religions of salvation did not hesitate to borrow certain ideas and formulas whose value and success they had recognized (we have already mentioned this in connection with the Phrygian Mysteries, § 207).
59. See I. P. Kane, "The Mithraic Cult Meal in Its Greek and Roman En
vironment," pp. 343 ff.



"If Christianity had been halted . .. " 329
In the last analysis, what was important was the personal experience and theological interpretation of the mythico-ritual scenario revealed by conversion and the initiatory ordeals (it is enough to remember the numerous valorizations of sacraments both among non-Christians and in the history of Christianity).60 Several emperors supported Mithraism, especially for political reasons. At Carnutum in 307 or 308 Diocletian and other Augusti consecrated an altar to Mithra, "the benefactor of the Empire." But Constantine's victory at the Milvian Bridge in 312 sealed the fate of Mithraism. The cult would recover its prestige under the very short reign of Julian; that philosopher-emperor declared himself a Mithraist. His death in 363 was followed by a period of tolerance, but Gratian's edict in 382 ended official support of Mithraism. Like all the religions of salvation and all the esoteric conventicles, the secret cult of Mithra, forbidden and persecuted, disappears as a historical reality. But other creations of the Iranian religious genius continue to make their way into a world that is in the process of being Christianized. Beginning in the third century, the success of Manichaeanism shakes the foundations of the Church, and the influence of Manichaean dualism continues all through the Middle Ages. On the other hand, a number of Iranian religious ideas-notably, some motifs of the Nativity, angelology, the theme of the magus, the theology of Light, and certain elements of Gnostic mythology-will end by being assimilated by Christianity and Islam; in some instances their traces can still be recognized in the period extending from the High Middle Ages to the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment. 61

In the year 32 or 33 of our era a young Pharisee named Saul, who had distinguished himself by the zeal with which he persecuted Christians, was traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus. "Suddenly, ... there came a light from heaven all around him. He fell to the ground, and then he heard a voice saying 'Saul. Saul, why are you persecuting meT 'Who are you, Lord?' he asked, and the voice answered, 'I am Jesus, and you are persecuting me. Get up now and go into the city, and you will be told what you have to do.' The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless, for though they heard the voice they could see no one. Saul got up from the ground. but even with his eyes wide open he could see nothing at all, and they had to lead him into Damascus by the hand. For three days he was without his sight, and took neither food nor drink." Finally a disciple. Ananias. taught by Jesus in a vision, laid his hands on Saul, and Saul recovered his sight. "So he was baptized there and then, and after taking some food he regained his strength.'" This happened two or three years after the Crucifixion. (The exact date of Jesus' execution is unknown: it could have taken place in 30 or in 33. Hence Paul's conversion can be put at the earliest in 32 and at the latest in 36.) As we shall see, faith in the resurrected Christ constitutes the fundamental element of Chris

tianity, especially of the Christianity of Saint Paul.2 This fact is of great importance, for his Epistles constitute the earliest documents that narrate the history of the Christian community. Now all the Epistles are infused with an unequaled fervor: certainty ofthe Resurrection, hence of salvation through Christ. "At last," wrote the great Hellenist Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, "at last the Greek language expresses an intense and burning spiritual experience."3 It is important to emphasize another fact: the short time-a few years-that separates Paul's ecstatic experience from the event that revealed the vocation of Jesus. In the fifteenth year of the principate of Tiberius (hence in 28-29 A.D.), an ascetic, John the Baptist, began traveling about the Jordan district "proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins" (Luke 3:1 ff.). The historian Flavius Josephus describes him as an "honest man" who exhorted the Jews to practice virtue, justice, and piety (Ant. Jud. 18. 5. 2. 116-19). In fact, he was a true prophet, illuminated, irascible, and vehement, in open rebellion against the Jewish political and religious hierarchies. Leader of a millenarianistic sect, John the Baptist announced the imminence of the Kingdom, but without claiming the title of its Messiah. His summons had considerable success. Among the thousands of persons who flocked from all over Palestine to receive baptism was Jesus, a native of Nazareth in Galilee. According to Christian tradition, John the Baptist recognized the Messiah in him. It is not known why Jesus chose to be baptized. But it is certain that his baptism revealed the messianic dignity to him. In the Gospels the mystery of the revelation is translated by the image of the Spirit of God descending in the form of a dove and a voice coming from heaven and saying: "This is my Son, the Beloved" (Matthew 3:16; cf. Mark 1: 11, Luke 3:22). Immediately after his baptism Jesus withdrew into the wilderness. The Gospels state that "the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness" in order for him to be tempted there by Satan (Mark 1: 12, Matt. 4:1-10, Luke 4:1-13). The mythological character ofthese temp

332 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
tations is obvious, but their symbolism reveals the specific structure of the Christian eschatology. Morphologically, they are a series of initiatory ordeals, similar to those of Gautama Buddha (see § 148). Jesus fasts for forty days and forty nights, and Satan "tempts" him: he first orders him to perform miracles ("tell these stones to turn into loaves"; he takes him to the parapet of the Temple in Jerusalem and says, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down"), and he then offers him absolute power: "all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor." In other words, Satan offers him power to destroy the Roman Empire (and so effect the military triumph of the Jews announced by the apocalypses) on condition that Jesus will fall at his feet. 4 For some time, Jesus practiced baptism, like John the Baptist and probably more successfully (see John 3:22-24; 4: 1-2). But learning that the prophet had been arrested by Herod, Jesus left Judaea for his native land. Flavius Josephus explains Herod's act as due to fear: Herod was afraid of the Baptist's influence over the masses and dreaded a rebellion. However this may have been, John's imprisonment triggered Jesus' preaching. As soon as he arrived in Galilee, Jesus proclaimed the Good News, that is, the Gospel. "The time has come, ... and the Kingdom of God is close at hand. Repent, and believe the Good News."5 The message expresses the eschatological hope that with few exceptions had dominated Jewish religiosity for more than a century. Following the prophets, following John the Baptist, Jesus predicted the imminent transfiguration of the world: this is the essence of his preaching (see § 220). Surrounded by his first disciples, Jesus preached and taught in the synagogues and in the open air, especially addressing the humble and the disinherited. He used the traditional didactic
4. To be sure, the scenario of the "temptations" was later integrated into the fabulous traditions collected in the Gospels, after the defeat of the insurrection of 66-70, that is, after the Romans had destroyed the Temple. But in the symbolic horizon in which the Church was developing, the "temptations" prefigured the miracles of Jesus (for soon afterward he will change water to wine and multiply the loaves and fishes) and the triumph of Christianity (for, though the Roman Empire was not destroyed by an armed insurrection, it would end by being conquered, that is, by becoming Christian). 5. Mark 1:15. Matthew 4:17 refers to the "Kingdom of Heaven," but the two formulas are synonymous.

means, referring to sacred history and the most popular biblical personages, drawing from the immemorial reservoir of images and symbols, making use especially of the figurative language of parables. Like so many other "divine men" of the Hellenistic world, Jesus was a physician and thaumaturge, curing all kinds of sicknesses and relieving the possessed. It was after certain prodigies that he became suspected of sorcery, a crime punishable by death. "It is through Beelzebub, the Prince of devils, that he casts out devils," said some. "Others asked him, as a test, for a sign from heaven."6 His reputation as an exorcist and thaumaturge was not forgotten by the Jews: a tradition of the first or second century mentions Yeshu, who "practiced sorcery and led Israel astray."7 Jesus' preaching soon began to disquiet the two politically and religiously influential groups, the Pharisees and Sadducees. The former were irritated by the liberties the Nazarene took in regard to the Torah. As for the Sadducees, they sought to avoid the disturbances that were likely to break out after any messianic propaganda. In fact, the Kingdom of God that Jesus preached suggested to some the religious fanaticism and political intransigence of the Zealots. The latter refused to recognize the authority of the Romans because, for them, "God is the only ruler and lord" (Josephus, Ant. Jud. 18. 1. 6. 23). At least one of the twelve Apostles, Simon, called the Zealot,S was a former adherent of that sect (Mark 3: 18). And Luke reports that, after the Crucifixion, a disciple said: "Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free" (24:21). In addition, one of the most spectacular and mysterious episodes recounted by the Gospels brings out the misunderstanding
6. Luke 11:15-16. Luke well saw that the demand for a "sign" and the accusation of sorcery constitute a narrative unity; the other Gospels report them separately: Mark 3:22, 8: 11; Math. 12:24, 38; 16: I. See C. H. Dodd, The Founder 0/ Christianity, p. 179, n. II.

334 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
concerning the Kingdom proclaimed by Jesus.9 After preaching for part of a day, Jesus learned that the five thousand people who had followed him to the shores of the Sea of Galilee were without food. He made them sit down and miraculously multiplied a few loaves and fishes, whereupon they all ate together. We here have an archaic ritual act by means of which the mystical solidarity of a group is affirmed or restored. In this case, the common meal might signify a symbolic anticipation of the eschaton, for Luke (9: 11) states that Jesus had just been speaking to them ofthe Kingdom of God. But, excited by this new wonder, the crowd did not understand its deep meaning and saw in Jesus the feverishly awaited "prophet-king," him who was to deliver Israel. "Jesus ... could see that they were about to come and take him by force and make him king" (John 6: 15). At that, he sent away the crowd, took refuge in a boat with the disciples, and crossed the Sea of Galilee. The misunderstanding could be interpreted as an abortive revolt. In any case, Jesus was abandoned by the crowd. According to John (6:66-67), only the Twelve remained faithful to him. It was with them that, in the spring of 30 (or 33), Jesus decided to celebrate the Feast of Passover at Jerusalem. The purpose of this expedition has long been-and still is-discussed. In all likelihood, Jesus wanted to proclaim his message in the religious center of Israel in order to force a definite answer one way or the other.1O When he came near Jerusalem, people "imagined that the kingdom of God was going to show itselfthen and there" (Luke 19: 11). Jesus entered the city like a messianic king (Mark 11:9-10), drove the buyers and sellers from the Temple, and preached to the people (11: 15 ff.). The next day he entered the Temple again and told the parable of the murderous vine-dressers who, after killing the servants sent by their master, seized and killed his son. "What will the owner of the vineyard do?" Jesus concluded. "He will come and make an end of the tenants and give the vineyard to others" (12:19).
9. The episode is narrated by the four Evangelists (Mark and Matthew tell it twice): Mark 6:30-44,8: 1-110; Matt. 14: 13-21, 15:32-39; Luke 9: 10-17; John 6:1-15.

An "obscure Jew": Jesus of Nazareth 335
For the priests and the scribes the meaning of the parable was transparent: the prophets had been persecuted, and the last emissary, John the Baptist, had just been killed. According to Jesus, Israel still represented God's vineyard, but its religious hierarchy was condemned; the new Israel would have other leaders. II What is more, Jesus gave his hearers to understand that he himself was the heir to the vineyard, the "beloved son" of the mastera messianic proclamation that could provoke bloody reprisals on the part of the incumbent. Now as the High Priest Caiaphas will say, "it is better for one man to die for the people, than for the whole nation to be destroyed" (John 11 :50). It was necessary to intervene quickly, yet without alerting Jesus' partisans. The arrest must be made secretly, by night. On the eve of Passover Jesus celebrated his last meal with his disciples. This final agape will become the central rite of Christianity: the Eucharist, whose meaning will engage our attention further on (§ 220). "After psalms had been sung, they left for the Mount of Olives" (Matt. 26:30). Of this touching night, tradition has preserved the memory of two incidents that still haunt Christian consciences. Jesus announces to Peter that "before the cock crows" he will deny him three times (Matt. 26:34; cf. Mark 14:2fr-31). Now, Jesus saw in Peter his most constant disciple, him who was to sustain the community of the faithful. To be sure, the denial was only a confirmation of human weakness. However, such an act does not annul Peter's dignity and charismatic virtues. The meaning of this painful incident is obvious: in the economy of salvation, human virtues matter no more than human sins; what counts is to repent and not to lose hope. A great part of the history of Christianity would be hard to justify without the precedent of Peter; his denial and his repentance (Matt. 26:74) have become in a way the exemplary model for every Christian life. No less exemplary is the next scene, which occurs in a place "called Gethsemane." Jesus took Peter and two other disciples with him and said: "My soul is sorrowful to the point of death. Wait here and keep awake with me" (Matt. 26:38). And going a little distance away, "he fell on his face and prayed. 'My

336 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
Father,' he said, 'if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it' " (26:39). But when he came back, he found his disciples sleeping. He said to Peter: "So you had not the strength to keep awake with me one hour" (26:40). "You should be awake and praying," he urged them again. It was in vain: when he returned, he "found them sleeping, their eyes were so heavy" (26:41; cf. Mark 14:32-42, Luke 22:40-46)., Now, since Gilgamesh's adventure (§ 23) it has been well known that conquering sleep, remaining "awake," constitutes the most difficult initiatory ordeal, for it seeks a transformation of the profane condition, a conquest of "immortality." At Gethsemane the "initiatory vigil"-though limited to a few hours-proved to be beyond human strength. This defeat, too, will become an exemplary model for the majority of Christians. Soon afterward, Jesus was arrested by the High Priest's guards, probably reinforced by Roman soldiers. It is hard to determine the succession of events. The Gospels report two separate judgments. The Sanhedrin found Jesus guilty of blasphemy. For, asked by the High Priest, "Are you the Christ (that is, the Messiah), ... the Son ofthe Blessed One?" he answered, "I am" (Mark 14:61-62; cf. Matt. 26:57-68, Luke 22:54, 66-71). Blasphemy was punishable by stoning, but it is not certain that at this period the Sanhedrin had the right to inflict capital punishment. In any case, Jesus was next judged by Pontius Pilate, the prefect of Judaea. Accused of sedition ("Are you the king of the Jews?"), he was condemned to death by crucifixion, a typically Roman torture. Subjected to derision (clad in a purple cloak and a crown of thorns, he was saluted by the soldiers with "Hail, king of the Jews!'-'), Jesus was crucified between two "thieves." Josephus often used this term-/eistai-to signify revolutionists. "The context of Jesus' execution was thus clearly the suppression of Jewish revolt against the rule of Romans and their collaborators in Judaea. Any proclamation of the coming reign of God immediately suggested to the Jerusalem authorities that the restoration of a Jewish kingdom was involved."12
12. Grant, Augustus to Constantine, p. 43. The rabbinic tradition reports that Jesus was judged by the Jewish authorities and sentenced to be hanged on the eve of Passover; see Klausner, Jesus of Nazareth, pp. 18 fT.



The Good News: The Kingdom of God is at hand 337
The arrest, trial, and sacrifice of Jesus scattered the faithful. Soon after the arrest, Peter, Jesus' favorite disciple, denied him three times. It is certain that Jesus' preaching, and perhaps even his name, would have sunk into oblivion but for a strange episode that is incomprehensible except to believers: the resurrection of the victim. The tradition transmitted by Paul and the Gospels attributes decisive importance to the empty tomb and the numerous appearances of the resurrected Jesus. Whatever the nature of these experiences may be, they constitute the source and foundation of Christianity. Faith in the resurrected Jesus Christ transformed the handful of demoralized fugitives into a group of resolute men, certain that they were invincible. It could almost be said that the Apostles themselves also experienced the initiatory ordeal of despair and spiritual death before they were reborn to a new life and became the first missionaries of the Gospel.
220. The Good News: The Kingdom of God is at hand
Rudolf Bultmann spoke of the "intolerable platitudinousness" of the biographies of Jesus. And in fact the testimonies are few and uncertain. The earliest-Paul's Epistles-almost entirely neglect the historical life of Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels, composed between 70 and 90, collect the traditions transmitted orally by the earliest Christian communities. But these traditions concern Jesus as well as the resurrected Christ. This does not necessarily lessen their documentary value, for the essential element of Christianity-as is also the case with any religion laying claim to a founder-is precisely memory. It is the memory of Jesus that constitutes the model for every Christian. But the tradition handed down by the earliest witnesses was "exemplary," not simply "historical"; it preserved the significant structures of events and the preaching, not any precise recollection of Jesus' activity. The phenomenon is well known, and not only in the history of religions. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the earliest Christians, Jews of Jerusalem, constituted an apocalyptic sect



338 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
within Palestinian Judaism. They were in daily expectation of the Second Coming of Christ, the parousia; it was the end of history that preoccupied them, not the historiography of the eschatological expectation. In addition, as was to be expected, around the figure of the resurrected Master there had early crystallized a whole mythology reminiscent of that of the savior gods and the divinely inspired man (theios anthropos). This mythology, which we shall outline further on (§ 222), is especially important: it helps us to understand not only the specifically religious dimension of Christianity but its later history as well. The myths that projected Jesus of Nazareth into a universe of archetypes and transcendent figures are as "true" as his acts and words; indeed, these myths confirm the strength and creativity of his original message. Besides, it is due to this universal mythology and symbolism that the religious language of Christianity became ecumenical and accessible beyond its original homeland. It is generally agreed that the Synoptic Gospels have brought us the essence of the message, first of all the proclamation of the Kingdom of God. As we mentioned (p. 332), Jesus began his ministry in Galilee by preaching the "Good News from God: 'The time has come, ... and the Kingdom of God is close at hand' " (Mark 1: 15).'3 The eschaton is imminent: "There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Kingdom of God come with power" (Mark 9:1; cf. 13:30). "But as for that day or hour, nobody knows it, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son; no one but the Father" (Mark 13:32). However, other expressions used by Jesus imply that the Kingdom is already present. After an exorcism he said: "But if it is through the finger of God that I cast out devils, then know that the Kingdom of God has overtaken you" (Luke II :20). On another occasion Jesus affirmed that since the time of John the Baptist "the Kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence, and the violent are taking it by storm" (Matt. II: 12). The meaning seems to be: the Kingdom is impeded by the violent. but it
13. Contemporary exegesis accepts as authentic four declarations concerning the Kingdom of God: Mark 1:15a: Luke 11:20 and 17:20-21: and Matt. 11:12.

is already present. 14 Unlike the apocalyptic syndrome abundantly set forth in the literature of the period, the Kingdom arrives without cataclysms, even without external signs. "The coming of the Kingdom of God does not admit of observation and there will be no one to say 'Look here! Look there!' For you must know, the Kingdom of God is among you" (Luke 17:20-21). In the parables, the Kingdom is compared to the gradual maturing of the seed that is sprouting and growing (Mark 4:26-29), to the mustard seed (30-32), to the yeast that makes the dough rise (Matt. 13:33). It is possible that these two differing proclamations of the Kingdom-in a very near future, in the present-correspond to successive phases of Jesus' ministry. 15 It is also conceivable that they express two translations of the same message: (1) the imminence of the Kingdom, announced by the prophets and the apocalypses-in other words, "the end of the historical world"and (2) anticipation of the Kingdom, accomplished by those who, by virtue of the mediation of Jesus, already live in the atemporal present of faith. 16 It is especially this second possible translation ot the message that emphasizes .the messianic dignity of Jesus. It is beyond doubt that his disciples had recognized him as the Messiah, as is proved by the appellation "Christ" (the Greek equivalent of the "Anointed," that is, the "Messiah"). Jesus never used this term in regard to himself; however, he accepted it when it was spoken by others (Mark 8:29, 14:61). Probably Jesus avoided the appellation Messiah in order to emphasize the difference between the Good News that he preached and the nationalistic forms of Jewish messianism. The Kingdom of God was not the theocracy that the Zealots wanted to establish by force of arms. Jesus principally defined himself by the expression "Son of Man." This term, which in the beginning was only a synonym

for "man" (see § 203), ended by designating-implicitly in Jesus' preaching and explicitly in Christian theology-Son of God. But insofar as it is possible to reconstruct the "personage" of Jesus, at least in its general outlines, it is to the figure of the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 40-55; see § 196) that he can be compared.
Nothing warrants our rejecting, as not authentic, the verses
in which he speaks of the ordeals that await him. It is his entire ministry that becomes inexplicable if we refuse to admit that he faced and accepted the possibility of sufferings, of humiliations, and doubtless of death itself. By going up to Jerusalem, he certainly-though perhaps without entirely dismissing the possibility of a victorious intervention on the part of Godassumed the risks of his course of conduct. 17
"Do not imagine," Jesus declares, "that I have come to abolish the Law of the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them" (Matt. 5:17). Just like the prophets, he glorifies purity of heart at the expense of ritual formalism; he returns tirelessly to the love of God and one's neighbor. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:3-12, Luke 6:20-23) Jesus describes the blessings that await the merciful and the pure in heart, the gentle and the peacemakers, the afflicted and those who are persecuted in the cause of right. It is the most popular Gospel text beyond the Christian world. Yet for Jesus Israel always remains the people chosen by God. It was to the lost sheep of the House of Israel that he was sent (Matt. 15:24), and only exceptionally does he turn to the pagans: he teaches his disciples to shun them (Matt. 10:6). But he seems to have accepted. "all the nations" at the establishment of the Kingdom (Mark 13: 10, Matt. 8: 11). Like the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus sought the radical transformation of the Jewish people, in other words, the emergence of a New Israel, a new people of God. The Lord's Prayer (Luke 11:2-4, Matt. 6:9-13) admirably summarizes the "method" for achieving this end. An expression of Hebrew

piety, the prayer does not use the first person in the singular but only in the plural: our Father, give us this day our daily bread, forgive us our trespasses, deliver us from evil. The content derives from the kaddish prayer of the ancient synagogue; it reflects the nostalgia to recover a primitive religious experience: the epiphany of Yahweh as Father. But the text put forth by Jesus is more concise and more moving. 18 However, every prayer must be imbued with true faith, that is, the faith shown by Abraham (§ 57). ·"Because everything is possible for God" (Mark 10:27). Similarly, "everything is possible for anyone who has faith" (Mark 9:23). Due to the mysterious virtue of Abrahamic faith, the mode of being offallen man is radically changed. "Everything that you ask and pray for, believe that you have it already, and it will be yours" (Mark 11:24; cf. Matt. 21:22). In other words, the ~ew Israel emerges mysteriously by the power of Abrahamic faith. This, furthermore, explains the success of the Christian mission of preaching faith in the resurrected Jesus Christ. When he celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples, Jesus "took some bread, and when he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to them. 'Take it,' he said, 'this is my body_' Then he took a cup, and when he had returned thanks he gave it to them, and all drank from it, and he said to them, 'This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is to be poured out for many.' "19 A modern exegete does not hesitate to write: "No other words of his are more firmly attested."20 Only Luke reports Jesus' command: "Take this and share it among you" (22: 18). Though Paul confirms the authenticity of this tradition (1 Cor. 11:24), there is no way of proving that these words were uttered by Jesus. The rite continues the Jewish domestic liturgy, especially the blessing of the bread and wine. Jesus often practiced
18. The exegetes also emphasize the difference between the formula of the earliest kaddish text ("May God establish his Kingdom during thy life and thy days") and the one used by Jesus: "Thy Kingdom come." See Perrin, Rediscovering the Teachings, pp. 57 ff., and the literature cited there. 19. Mark 14:22-24; cf. Matt. i6:26, Luke 22: 19, I Cor. II :24. John (6:51) transmits a parallel version, presumably based on a different translation of the original Aramaic of the statement. 20. Dodd, The Founder, p. 10.



342 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
it; when publicans and sinners were present, the meal presumably proclaimed the Kingdom.21 For the earliest Christians, the "breaking of bread" (Acts 2:24) constituted the most important cult act. On the one hand, it was the reactualization of the presence of Christ and hence of the Kingdom that he had established; on the other hand, the rite anticipated the messianic banquet at the end of time. But Jesus' words contain a deeper meaning: the need for his voluntary sacrifice in order to insure the "new covenant,"22 foundation of the New Israel. This implies the conviction that a new religious life arises only through a sacrificial death; the conception is well known to be archaic and universally disseminated. It is difficult to determine if this ritual communion with his body and his blood was regarded by Jesus as a mystical identification with his person. This is what Paul states (1 Cor. 1:16; cf. 12:27; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 4: 12), and, despite the originality of his thought and his theological language, it is possible that he is continuing a genuine
Jerusalemite tradition.23 In any case, the meal taken in common by the first Christians imitated Jesus' last act; it was at once a memorial of the Last Supper and the ritual repetition of the voluntary sacrifice of the Redeemer. Morphologically, the Eucharist is reminiscent of the cult agapes practiced in Mediterranean antiquity, especially in the
Mystery religions. 24 Their goal was the consecration, and hence the salvation, of the participants through communion with a divinity who was mysteriosophic in structure. The convergence with the Christian rite is significant: it illustrates the hope-common enough in that period-of a mystical identification with the divinity. Some authors have tried to explain the Eucharist by influences from the Oriental religions of salvation, but the hy
21. Certainly, the presence of "untouchables" offended and angered the Jewish rigorists. 22. The Qumran community also regarded itself as having been granted the benefit of a New Covenant; see § 223. 23. Paul elaborates this idea and at the same time gives it a deeper meaning; he identifies the Christian community, the New Israel. with the "body of Christ," each Christian being "in Christ," just as Christ is "in him"; see p. 348, below.

pothesis is groundless (see p. 348). Insofar as it sought an imitatio Christi, the primitive agape virtually constituted a sacrament. It must be said even now that in the course of the centuries this central rite-together with baptism, the most important in the Christian cult-inspired many and various theologies; in our own day, the interpretation of the Eucharist still separates Roman Catholicism from the reformed churches (see vol. 3).
221. The birth of the Church
On the day of Pentecost in the year 30, Jesus' disciples were all together "when suddenly they all heard what sounded like a powerful wind from heaven, the noise of which filled the entire house in which they were sitting; and something appeared to them which seemed like tongues of fire; these separated and came to rest on the head of each of them. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak foreign languages" (Acts 2: 1-4). Fiery epiphanies of the Holy Spirit are a rather well-known theme in the history of religions: they are found in Mesopotamia (§ 20), in Iran (§ 104), in India (Buddha, Mahflvira, etc.; § 152). But the context of the Pentecost has a more definite aim: the violent wind, the tongues of fire, and the glossolalia are reminiscent of certain traditions concerning the theophany on Sinai25 (see § 59). In other words, the descent of the Holy Spirit is interpreted as a new revelation from God, similar to the revelation on Sinai. The day of Pentecost sees the birth of the Christian Church. It was not until after they had received the Holy Spirit that the Apostles began preaching the Gospel and producing many "miracles and signs" (Acts 2:43). On that day Peter addressed to the crowd the first summons to conversion. He and his companions bore witness to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ; it was God who resurrected him (2:24, 32, etc.). The miracle had already been predicted by David (2:31); hence the Resurrection is the eschatological event foretold by the prophets (2:17-21). Peter adjured the Jews to repent,

adding that "every one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (2:38). This first harangue, which became the exemplary model for the kerygma (the Christian "proclamation"), was followed by numerous conversions (three thousand according to Acts 2:41). On another occasion (he had just cured a man crippled from birth; Acts 3: 1-9), Peter exhorted the Jews to recognize that they had been wrong, though out of ignorance, when they condemned Jesus, and to repent and accept baptism (Acts 3: 13-19). The Acts of the Apostles afford us a glimpse of the life of the first Christian community in Jerusalem (to which the author gives the Greek name ecclesia). Apparently its members still followed the traditional religious discipline (circumcision of male infants, ritual purifications, rest on the Sabbath, prayers in the Temple). But they often met for instruction, breaking bread, the agapes, and to pray and praise God (2:42, 46). However, the Book of Acts (which cites many examples of preaching to unbelievers) tells us nothing of the instruction given to members of the community. As for economic organization, it states that' 'the faithful all ... owned everything in common; they sold their goods and possessions and shared out the proceeds among themselves according to what each one needed" (2:44-45). They awaited the Second Coming of Christ. Despite their strict obedience to the Mosaic usages, the Christians of Jerusalem aroused the hostility of the High Priests and the Sadducees (4: 1-3). Peter and John were arrested when they preached in the Temple, were summoned before the Sanhedrin, but were later released (4: 1-3). On another occasion all the Apostles were arrested, then released by the Sanhedrin (5: 17-41). Later, presumably in the year 43, one of the Apostles was beheaded at the order of Herod Agrippa I (12: 1 ff.), who wanted to obtain the support of the family of Annas. The attitude of the Pharisees was less decided. Gamaliel-Saul's teacher-defended the Apostles before the Sanhedrin. But the Pharisees, favorable to the converts of Jerusalemite stock (the "Hebrews") were hostile to the proselytes recruited among the Jews of the Diaspora (the "Hellenists"); they reproached them for their detach

ment from the Temple and the Law (6: 13-14). This was the reason for the stoning, in 36-37, of Stephen, the first martyr to the Christian faith (7:58-60). "Saul entirely approved of the killing" (8: l). On that same day the "Hellenists" were expelled from Jerusalem into the country district of Judaea and Samaria (8: I). Thenceforth the Hebrews and their leader James, "brother of the Lord," will hold sway over the Church of Jerusalem. It is possible already to detect a certain tension between the "Hebrews" and the "Hellenists." The former are more conservative and legalistic, despite their expectation of the parousia. They faithfully follow the Jewish code of ritual prescriptions and are the typical representatives of the movement designated by the term "Judaeo-Christianity."26 It was their strict obedience to the Law that Paul refused to accept (see p. 348). And in fact it is difficult to understand a rabbinical legalism practiced precisely by those who proclaimed the Resurrection of Christ and bore witness to it. The "Hellenists" were a small group of Jews established in Jerusalem and converted to Christianity. They had no great esteem for the cult celebrated in the Temple. In his speech Stephen exclaimed: "The Most High does not live in a house that human hands have built" (Acts 7:48). The dispersal of the "Hellenists" hastened missionary work among the Jews of the Diaspora and, exceptionally, at Antioch, among the pagans (11: 19). It was in the Diaspora that Christology developed. The title "Son of Man"-which, in Greek, has no further meaningis replaced by "Son of God" or "Lord" (Kyrios); the term Messiah is translated into Greek, Christos, and ends by becoming a proper name: Jesus Christ. Very soon the mission was directed to the pagans. At Antioch, in Syria, the first important community of converts of pagan stock was organized; it is there that the term "Christians" was

first used (Acts 11:26).27 It was from Antioch that the Christian mission spread out into the Hellenistic world. The confrontation of a Jewish messianic movement with Greek thought and religiosity will have decisive consequences for the development of Christianity. It is Saint Paul's inestimable contribution that he rightly grasped the elements of the problem and had the courage to fight untiringly for the only solution that he considered just and consistent. Born probably at the beginning of the first century at Tarsus in Cilicia,~8 he came to study in Jerusalem with Gamaliel, "a doctor of the law and respected by the whole people" (Acts 5:34). He describes himself as a "Hebrew born of Hebrew parents. As for the Law, I was a Pharisee: as for working for religion, I was a persecutor of the Church" (Phil. 3:5: cf. Gal. I: 13-14). When on his anti-Christian mission. he saw Christ appear to him on the road to Damascus. He is the only one of those who did not know Jesus to have been given the title of Apostle. In fact. he was converted by the resurrected Christ: he had received or learned the Gospel that he preached not from a human being but "only through a revelation of Jesus Christ" (Gal. I: 11-12: I Cor. 2: 16). Become the "Apostle to the Gentiles," Paul undertook long missionary journeys through Asia Minor. Cyprus. Greece. and Macedonia. He preached in many cities, founded churches. spent a long time in Corinth and in Rome. Denounced by the Jews and arrested in Jerusalem, after two years in prison he was referred to the emperor's tribunal. At Rome he lived for two years in freedom but watched by guards. Acts breaks off at this point, and we do not know the full story of the Apostle's end. He died a martyr in Rome, between 62 and 64. Despite the fifteen chapters (out of twenty-eight) that Acts devotes to him, despite the fourteen Epistles that are attributed

to him,29 our knowledge of the life, apostolate, and thought of Saint Paul remains fragmentary. His profound and personal interpretation of the Gospel was expounded orally-and probably differently to believers and unbelievers. The Epistles do not constitute consecutive chapters of a systematic treatise. They continue, clarify, and define certain questions of doctrine or practice-questions that are carefully discussed in his teachings but that were not correctly understood by the community or questions whose typically Pauline solutions were criticized or sometimes eVen rejected by other missionaries. Despite this, it must immediately be added that the Epistles represent the earliest and most important document of the primitive Church, for they reflect not only the most serious crises of nascent Christianity but also the creative daring of the first Christian theologian.
222. The Apostle to the Gentiles
Saint Paul's theology and kerygma derive from his ecstatic experience on the road to Damascus. On the one hand, he recognized in the resurrected ChrisPO the Messiah, the Son sent by God to deliver men from sin and death. On the other hand, his conversion established a relationship of mystical participation with Christ. Paul interprets his experience as analogous to the Crucifixion (Gal. 2: 19): he now possesses "the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2: 16) or "the Spirit of God" (7:40). He does not hesitate to proclaim: "It is Christ speaking in me" (2 Cor. 13:3; Rom. 15: 18). He refers to being mystically caught up "into the third heaven" and to "revelations" that he had received from the Lord (2 Cor. 12: 1-4,7). These "signs and wonders" were granted him by the Spirit of God "to win the allegiance of the pagans" (Rom. 15: 18). Despite this privileged experience, Paul does not demand an exceptional status, different from that of others. Every believer accomplishes mystical union with Christ through the sacrament of baptism. For "when we were baptized in Christ
29. There is now agreement as to the authenticity of five or six, among them the most important ones: the Epistle to the Romans, I and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. But the other Epistles express or continue the same Pauline thought. 30. Paul was the last to whom the resurrected Christ appeared (I Cor. 15:8).



348 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
Jesus we were baptized in his death ... we went into the tomb with him and indeed joined him in death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too might live a new life" (Rom. 6:3-4). Through baptism, the Christian "is in Christ" (2 Cor. 5: 17); he has become a member of a mystical body. Baptized in one Spirit, to "make one body," "Jews as well as Greeks, slaves as well as citizens, ... one Spirit was given us all to drink" (1 Cor. 12: 13). Death and resurrection by immersion in water constitute a well-known mythico-ritual scenario that is bound up with a universally documented aquatic symbolism.3! But Saint Paul connects the sacrament of baptism with a recent historical event: the death and resurrection ofJesus Christ. In addition, baptism not only insures the new life of the believer but accomplishes his transformation into a member of the mystical body of Christ. Such a conception was unthinkable for traditional Judaism. On the other hand, it differs from the other contemporary baptismal practices, for example that of the Essenes, in which the numerous lustrations had an essentially purifying value (see p. 355). The sacrament of the Eucharist is equally foreign to Judaism. Just like baptism, the Eucharist integrates the believer into the mystical body of Christ, the Church. By communicating with the consecrated bread and wine, he assimilates the body and blood of the Lord (1 Cor. 10: 16-17; cf. 11 :27-29). For Saint Paul, salvation is equivalent to mystical identification with Christ. Those who have faith have Jesus Christ within them (2 Cor. 13:5). Redemption is brought about by a gratuitous gift of God, namely, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The prime importance that Saint Paul attributes to grace (Rom. 3:24; 6: 14,23; etc.) presumably derives from his own experience: despite all that he had thought and done-even to approving the stoning of Stephen-God granted him salvation. Hence it is useless, for a Jew, to obey the ritual and moral prescriptions of the Torah: by himself, man cannot obtain salvation. Properly speaking, it is in consequence of the establishment of the Law that man became conscious of sin; before knowing the Law, he was
31. See Eliade, Patterns o/Comparative Religion, §§ 64 ff., and Images and Symbols, chap. 5.



The Apostle to the Gentiles 349
not aware if he was or was not a sinner (Rom. 7:7 iT.). To be under the Law is equivalent to being "slaves to the elemental principles of this world" (Gal. 4:3). This is as much as to say that "those who rely on the keeping of the Law are under a curse" (Gal. 3: 10). As for the pagans, though they can know God through the works of his creation, "the more they called themselves philosophers, the more stupid they grew"; they sank into idolatry, the source of degrading passions and perversion (Rom. 1:20-32). In short, for the Jews as for the pagans, redemption is accomplished only by faith and the sacraments. Salvation is "the free gift given of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom. 6:23).32 Such a theology inevitably opposed Saint Paul to the JudaeoChristians of Jerusalem. The· latter demanded the preliminary circumcision of converted pagans and forbade their presence at meals taken in common and at the celebration of the Eucharist. After a conflict, of which Paul (Gal. 2:7-10) and Acts (15) give contradictory accounts, the two parties, meeting in Jerusalem, reached a compromise solution. The converted pagans were bound to abstain only "from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from fornication" (Acts 15:29). This decision was probably arrived at in Paul's absence. The Apostle to the Gentiles would certainly not have accepted it, for it preserved a part of Jewish observance. In any case, the meeting in Jerusalem confirmed the unexpected success of the Christian mission among pagans-a success that contrasted with the partial failure experienced in Palestine. But Saint Paul was also called on to face certain crises that threatened his own churches, the communities that he had founded. At Corinth the faithful coveted the spiritual gifts or
32. It should be pointed out that the Epistle to the Romans-in which the theology of grace and the soteriology of the Cross are developed-is the most important of Saint Paul's writings. Many theologians consider the Epistle to the Romans the most important book of the New Testament. Exegesis of this profound, daring, and enigmatic text has given rise to numerous speculations and has brought on crises that have divided and at the same time renewed Christianity for fifteen centuries. One of the most significant contemporary theologies was inaugurated by Karl Barth's famous commentary on it (see vol. 3).



350 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
"charisma" received from the Holy Spirit. As a matter of fact, we have here a religious practice of considerable popularity in the Hellenistic world: the quest for enthousiasmos. "Charisma" included the gift of healing, the ability to perform miracles, prophecy, glossolalia, the gift of interpreting languages, etc. (1 Cor. 12:4 ff.). Intoxicated by their ecstasies and their powers, some of the faithful believed they had obtained possession of the Spirit and hence offreedom; they held that henceforth everything was allowable to them (6: 12), even prostitution (6: 15-16),33 Paul reminds them that their bodies are "members making up the body of Christ" (6: 15). He further elaborates the hierarchy of charismata: the most important is that of the Apostle, next that of the prophet, followed, in the third place, by the spiritual gift of the didaska/os or teacher (12:28; cf. 14: 1-5). In short, Saint Paul does not reject aspiration to the higher gifts, but he adds: "I am going to show you a way that is better than any of them." Then follows the hymn to charity, one of the summits of Pauline thought: "If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels, but speak without love, I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If I have the gift of prophecy, understanding all the mysteries that are, and knowing everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move mountains, but without love, then I am nothing at all," and so forth (13: 1-13). In all probability, Saint Paul accepted the quest for charisma, for he had understood the need to translate the message of the Gospel into a religious language familiar to Hellenistic circles. Better than anyone else, he knew the difficulty of preaching "a crucified Christ; to the Jews an obstacle that they cannot get over, to the pagans madness" (l Cor. 1:23). The resurrection of bodies, a belief held by the majority of Jews, seemed senseless to the Greeks, who were exclusively interested in the immortality of the souJ.34 No less difficult to understand was the hope of an
33. The phenomenon is abundantly documented in the history of Indian religions (see § 146) and of Gnosticism (§ 230); it will also be found in certain mystical currents of Christianity and Islam (see vol. 3). 34. The Resurrection of the Redeemer insures the resurrection of Christians (1 Cor. 15: 12 ff.). Paul also accepts the (originally Greek) conception of an immortality obtained immediately after death (Phil. 1:23; cf. 2 Cor. 5:8). However, postexistence is not purely disincamate; it is the "spiritual [pnellmatiko,s]



The Apostle to the Gentiles 351
eschatological renewal of the world; the Greeks, on the contrary, sought more certain means of freeing themselves from matter. The Apostle tried to adapt himself; the more deeply he penetrated into Hellenistic circles, the less he spoke of the eschatological expectation. We also note innovations of considerable significance. Not only did he often use the Hellenistic religious vocabulary (gnosis, mysterion, sophia, kyrios, soter), but he adopted certain conceptions that were foreign to Judaism and to primitive Christianity. Thus, for example, Saint Paul took over the dualistic idea, fundamental to Gnosticism, of a "psychic man" inferior and opposed to the "spiritual man."35 The Christian seeks to cast off the carnal man in order to become purely spiritual (pneumatikos). Another dualistic characteristic opposes God to the world, dominated by its "masters" (l Cor. 2:8), in other words, by the "elemental principles" (Gal. 4:3, 9). However, Paul's theology remains fundamentally biblical. He rejects the distinction, insisted on by the Gnostics, between the supreme God and redeemer and the evil Demiurge, responsible for the Creation. The cosmos is dominated by evil after the fall of man; but redemption is equivalent to a second creation, and the world will recover its original perfection. Paul's Christology develops around the Resurrection; that event reveals the nature of Christ: he is the Son of God, the Redeemer. The christological drama is reminiscent of a soteriological scenario well known at the time but whose earliest expressions are far 01der: 36 the savior comes down from heaven to earth for the good of men and then returns to heaven after accomplishing his mission.
body" that survives death (or, to use his expression, that is "raised": I Cor. 15:44 fT.). The doctrine ofthe "spiritual body" is documented in other traditions (India, Tibet, etc.). Saint Paul's originality is in having associated immortality with resurrection; but this solution raised other problems. 35. 1 Cor. 2: 14-15. "The first man, being from the earth. is earthly by nature; the second man is from heaven" (15:47). 36. Archaic mythologies are aware of several types of supernatural beings (sons of God. demiurges, civilizing heroes. messianic and millenaristic figures. etc.) who descend to teach or to save men and then return to heaven. Similar conceptions occur in the theologies of Hinduism (avatar) and Buddhism <the boddhisa(fvas).



352 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
In his earliest letter, the First Epistle of Paul to the church in Thessalonica, written in 51 from Corinth, Paul makes known a "word of the Lord"37 concerning the parousia: "At the trumpet of God, the voice of the archangel will call out the command and the Lord himself will come down from heaven: those who have died in Christ will be the first to rise, and then those of us who are still alive will be taken up in the clouds, together with them, to meet the Lord in the air. So we shall stay with the Lord for ever" (4:16-17). Six years later, in 57, he reminds the Romans that "our salvation is even nearer than it was when we were converted. The night is almost over, it will be daylight soon" (Rom. 13:11-12). However, expectation of the parousia must not trouble the life of the Christian communities. He insists on the need to work in order to deserve the food that one eats (2 Thess. 3:8-10), and he demands respect for the laws in force, submission to the authorities, and payment of taxes, direct or indirect (Rom. 13:1-7). The consequences of this ambivalent valorization of the present (while awaiting the parousia, history continues and must be respected) were soon to make themselves felt. Despite the countless solutions proposed from the end of the first century, the problem of the historical present still haunts contemporary Christian thought. Saint Paul's considerable authority in the ancient Church is largely the result of a catastrophe that shook Judaism and paralyzed the development of the Judaeo-Christian tendency. During his lifetime the Apostle's importance was not very great. But soon after his death the war of the Jews against Rome broke out, in 66; it ended, in 70, with the ruin of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple.
223. The Essenes at Qumran
During the war, at the beginning of the summer of68, a contingent of Vespasian's army attacked and destroyed the "monastery" of Qumran, situated in the open desert on the shore of the Dead Sea. In all likelihood the defenders were massacred; but on the eve of the disaster they had had time to hide a considerable

The Essenes at Qumran 353
number of manuscripts in large clay vessels. Their discovery, between 1947 and 1952, renewed our knowledge of the Jewish apocalyptic movements and the origins of Christianity. In fact, scholars have seen in the Dead Sea monastic community the mysterious sect of the Essenes, known until then only through the scanty information supplied by Josephus, Philo, and Pliny the Younger.38 Among the manuscripts so far deciphered and published, there are, in addition to commentaries on certain books of the Old Testament, some original treatises. We mention the most important among them: the "Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness," the "Treatise of Discipline," the "Thanksgiving Psalms," and the "Commentary on Habakkuk." With the help of these new documents it is possible to reconstruct the general outline of the sect's history. Its ancestors were the hassidim, whose religious fervor and whose role in the War of the Maccabees will be remembered (see § 202). The founder of the Qumran community, known to his disciples as the "Teacher of Righteousness," was a Zadokite priest, hence a member of the legitimate and ultraorthodox priestly class. When Simon (142-134) was proclaimed "prince and high priest for ever," and the office of high priest was irrevocably transferred from the Zadokites to the Hasmoneans, the Teacher of Righteousness left Jerusalem with a group of disciples and took refuge in the desert of Judah. In all probability the "Evil Priest" execrated in the Qumran texts was Simon; he had persecuted the Teacher of Righteousness in his exile and was even contemplating attacking Qumran when he was assassinated by the governor of Jericho (1 Mac. 16: 11 ff.). It is not known under what circumstances the Teacher of Righteousness died.39 His disciples and followers venerated him as God's messenger. Just as Moses
38. The contradictions between the two classes of documents-the Qumran manuscripts and the reports of the classical authors-are explained, in part, by the latter's inadequate information and, in part, by the complexity of this apocalyptic sect. The Qumran community does not represent Essenism as a whole; it seems certain that Essene groups existed in other regions of Palestine. 39. A. Dupont-Sommer, followed by other scholars, accuses the "impious priest" of having inspired his assassination; see Les ecrits esseniens. pp. 375 ff. (Eng. trans., The Essene Writings/rom Qumran. pp. 349 ff.). However, this crime is not explicitly attested in the documents; see the analysis of the texts in F. M. Cross, The Ancient Library o/Qumran, pp. 157-60.



354 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
had made the old Covenant possible, the Teacher of Righteousness had renewed it; by founding the eschatological community at Qumran, he had anticipated the messianic era. From the publication of the first texts, the specialists observed significant similarities between the Essenian religious practices and those of Christianity. Through these new documents we are now better informed concerning the historical and spiritual milieu (the Sitz im Leben) of a Jewish apocalyptic sect. The Essenian parallels illuminate certain aspects of Jesus' preaching and numerous expressions often used by the authors of the New Testament. But there are also differences, and they are not less important. The Qumran community was strictly monastic; the earliest Christians lived in the world, they made up a missionary community. Both sects were apocalyptic and messianic: like the Christians, the Essenes regarded themselves as the people of the New Covenant. But they awaited an eschatological prophet (who, in the New Testament, had already come in the person of John the Baptist) and two messiahs: the Priest Messiah, who would sanctify them, and the Royal Messiah, who would lead Israel in the war against the Gentiles, a war that God himself would bring to a triumphant end. Indeed, the "Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness" constitutes the phm of battle for this eschatological conflagration. A mobilization lasting six years would be followed by twenty-nine years of war. The army of the Sons of Light would be made up of28,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, reinforced by a large number of angels. 4O The Christians, too, hoped for the Second Coming of Christ in glory, as judge and Redeemer of the world; but, following Jesus' teaching, they did not accept the ideology of the holy war. For the Essenes as for the Christians, the Messiah would appear at the end of time and would receive an eternal kingdom; in both messianic doctrines the priestly, royal, and prophetic elements coexisted. However, in the Qumran literature the idea of a preexistent Messiah (the Second Adam, the Son of Man) is not documented; what is more, the Messiah has not yet become

The Essenes at Qumran 355
the celestial Redeemer, and the two messianic figures are not unified, as in the Christology of the primitive Church.41 As eschatological personage, the Teacher of Righteousness would inaugurate the new age. His disciples accorded him the rank of Messiah: that of the Master who reveals the real, esoteric meaning of the Scriptures and who also possesses prophetic powers. Some texts imply that the Master will be resurrected at the end of time. 42 But as one expert, Professor Cross, concludes, "if the Essenes expected the return of their Master as a Priestly Messiah, they expressed their hope in an extremely indirect manner" (p. 299): this is in contrast to the insistence with which the New Testament develops this idea. The organization and the ritual systems of the two apocalyptic sects present astonishing similarities, but certain differences are observable, and they are not less important. The Essenes made up a community that was at once priestly and lay. Its religious activity (teaching, cult, exegesis) was directed by hereditary priests; the laymen were responsible for the community's material resources. The directing group was termed the rabbfm (literally, the "numerous"), a term found also in the New Testament (where it designates the "assembly" that chooses its representatives; Acts 15: 12). Twelve laymen and three priests formed the inner circle. The highest office was that of "inspector" (mbaqqer); this supreme leader was bound to behave as a "shepherd" (the "Damascus Document," 13:7-9). His function is reminiscent of that ofthe "shepherd" or episkopos among the Christians. At Qumran, initiatory baptism, which integrated the neophyte into the community, was followed by annual ritual lustrations. And, like the "breaking of bread" for the Christians, their com

"of the order of Melchizedek" (6:20; 7: 1-25: etc.). Cross sees in this interpretation the effort of the primitive Church to adapt Christology to the messianic expectation of the Essenes or. more precisely. to present in a single figure the fulfillment of all the messianic nostalgias of the past (p. 221). 42. The most important text, and the one most discussed. is a passage in the "Damascus Document" commenting on Numbers 21:18: see the translations and analyses in Dupont-Sommer. Les ecrits. pp. 145 ff.

356 THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY
mon meal was understood by the Essenes as an anticipation of the messianic banquet.43 The members of the community abstained from marriage, for they considered themselves all to be soldiers in the holy war. This was not a true, disciplinary, asceticism but a provisional one, imposed by the imminence of the eschaton.44 Another point of resemblance must be emphasized: the similar hermeneutic method employed by the Essenian exegetes and the authors of the New Testament-a method without analogies either in rabbinic Judaism or in Philo. By applying a special procedure (pesher), the Essenes read in the prophecies of the Old Testament precise references to contemporary history and hence predictions concerning certain imminent events. Those who had access to "knowledge"-that is, those initiated into the apocalyptic gnosis revealed by the Teacher of Righteousness-knew that the supreme war was on the point of breaking out. Moreover, as we have seen (§ 202), the whole of Jewish apocalyptic literature glorified esoteric knowledge. Similarly, especially from the second generation, the Christians accorded a special value to gnosis: they were impatient to decipher the precursory signs of the parousia. For the Essenes, religious knowledge was essentially a revealed knowledge, eschatological in nature. A parallel conception has been shown to exist in Paul's Epistles and in the Gospels of Matthew and John. Higher teaching, and even the community sacraments, were regarded as esoteric. For the Kingdom of God is not accessible to the "flesh" but only to the "spirit."45 In short, among the Jews as among the Christians, secret gnosis and esotericism form part of the apocalyptic "method." After the destruction of Qumran and the dispersal of the Essenes, some of those who escaped probably

joined the Christian communities of Palestine. In any case, the apocalyptic and esoteric traditions were maintained in the Christianity of the first two centuries, and they encouraged certain Gnostic tendencies (see § 228). The analogies between the Essenian theological language and that of the Gospel of John are equally remarkable. The Qumran texts contain a number of specifically Johannine expressions, for example "light of the world" (8:12), "sons of light" (12:36), "the man who lives by the truth comes out into the light" (3:21), "the spirit of truth from the spirit of falsehood" (1 John 4:6).46 According to the doctrine of the Essenes, the world is the field of battle between two spirits whom God created from the beginning: the Spirit of Truth (called also the Prince of Light and the Angel of Truth) and the Spirit of Wickedness or Perversity; the latter is none other than Belial, the Prince of Darkness, Satan. The war between these two spirits and their spiritual armies also takes place between men and in the heart of each" Son of Light" ("Treatise of Discipline," 4:23-26). The Essenian eschatological scenario has been compared to certain Johannine texts. The "Treatise of Discipline" (3:17-23) states that, though they are guided by the Prince of Light, the Children of Justice sometimes fall into error, driven by the Angel of Darkness. Similarly, the First Epistle of John speaks of "children of God" and "children of the devil"47 and exhorts believers not to let the devil lead them astray (3:7-10, 4: 1-6). But while the Essenes await the eschatological war, in the Johannine literature, despite the fact that the combat still continues, the crisis has passed, for Jesus Christ has already triumphed over evil. Another difference must be pointed out: in the Johannine literature, the Spirit is usually understood as the Spirit of God or

The dualism light/darkness and especially the glorification of light as the supreme epiphany of the Spirit show the influence of Iranian ideas. But it must not be forgotten that a similar imagery is found in the Old Testament and in other Semitic religions; see Eliade, The Two and the One, pp. 55 ff. 47. [The English version of the Jerusalem Bible (whose texts I have for the most part reproduced) does not use the expression "children of the devil." However, it is used in both the Authorized Version and the New English Bible.-Translator.]

of Christ (1 John 4: 13); in the "Treatise of Discipline," the Prince of Light or the Spirit of Truth proves to be the helper of the Son of Light. However, the figure of the Paraclete, described by John (14:17; 15:26; 16: 13, etc.), seems to derive from a theology similar to that of Qumran. Christ promised to send him to bear witness and to intercede for the faithful, but the Paraclete will not speak in his own name. Such a function, which was not expected of the Holy Spirit, has always aroused the curiosity of exegetes. The Qumran texts allow us to understand the origin of the Paraclete; morphologically, he is one with a personage of Yahweh's celestial court, especially the divine angel or messenger.48 But Iranian influences, first of all religious dualism and angelology, have transformed the two angels of Yahweh's court (see § 203) into the incarnation of two opposed principles: good/evil, truth/ falsehood, light/darkness. The Essenes, as well as the author of the Johannine corpus, shared in this Palestinian syncretistic theology and eschatology, which were strongly influenced by Iranian dualism. Despite the numerous resemblances that we have just mentioned, Elisenism and primitive Christianity present different structures and pursue different ends. The Essenian eschatology derives from the priestly tradition; the Christian eschatology has its deep roots in the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament. The Essenes maintained and strengthened priestly separatism; the Christians, on the contrary, sought to reach all social strata. The Essenes excluded from the messianic banquet those who were physically or spiritually impure or deformed; for the Christians, one of the signs of the Kingdom was precisely the curing of the infirm (the blind who see, the dumb who speak, etc.) and the resurrection of the dead. Finally, the Resurrection of Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit, the spiritual freedom that succeeded to the discipline of the Law, constitute the central "event" that discriminates between these two messianic communities.49

Destruction of the Temple; the parousia delayed 359
224. Destruction of the Temple. Delay in the occurrence of the parousia
Refusing to take part in the messianic war against the Romans, a
group of ludaeo-Christians was evacuated, in 66, to Pella, in Thmsjordan; others sought refuge in the cities of Syria and Asia Minor and in Alexandria. The significance of the refusal did not escape the insurgents: the Christians50 were separating themselves from the national destiny of Israel (Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 3.5.3). The event marks the breaking-away of the Church from Judaism. However, Judaism will survive, by virtue of a similar action. The most important religious leader ofthe century, Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, who had strongly opposed the armed insurrection, was evacuated in a coffin during the siege ofthe city. Soon afterward he obtained leave from Titus to establish an elementary school at Jabneh, a village not far from Jaffa. It would be the founding of this school by Rabbi Johanan that would save the spiritual values of the Jewish people, conquered on the national plane and threatened with disappearance. The ruin of the holy city and the destruction of the Temple brutally changed the religious orientation of the Jews as well as that of the Christians. For the former, the destruction of the Temple raised a problem still more serious than the one their ancestors had faced six centuries earlier. For then the prophets, in predicting the catastrophe, had at the same time revealed the reason for it: Yahweh was preparing to punish his people for their countless infidelities. This time, on the contrary, the apocalypses had proclaimed as certain the final victory of God in the eschatological battle against the forces of evil. The answer to this unexpected and incomprehensible catastrophe was given at Jabneh: Judaism will continue, but "reformed," that is, rid of vain apocalyptic hopes and messianisms and exclusively following the teaching of the Pharisees (see § 204). The consequences of this decision were, first, the stren~thening of the Law and the synagogue and then the valorization of the Mishnayoth and,

finally, of the Talmud. But the second destruction of the Temple profoundly marked the development of Judaism: deprived of the sanctuary-the only sacred space where the cult could be performed-the faithful were reduced to prayers and religious instruction. 51
During the war, the Christians, too, experienced a resurgence of apocalyptic enthusiasm: the hope that God would soon intervene, and precisely by hastening the Second Coming of Christ. The Gospel of Mark reflects and continues this apocalyptic hope. 52 But the delay in the parousia prompted embarrassing questions. Essentially, the answers given may be classified in three categories: (1) the imminence of the parousia is reaffirmed even more strongly (e.g., in the Second Epistle of Peter); (2) the parousia is deferred to a more distant future, and a theological justification is offered for this long interval: it is the period set aside for the missionary activity of the Church (see, e.g., the Gospels of Matthew and Luke); (3) the parousia has already taken place, for the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus are in fact the true "final event" (eschaton), and the "new life" is already accessible to Christians (see, e.g., the Gospel of John).53 It was this third explanation that ended by being accepted. In point of fact, it continued the paradoxes faced by the earliest believers: for Jesus the Messiah was not different from other human beings; though the Son of God, he was humiliated and died on the Cross. But the Resurrection confirmed his divinity. Yet this irrefragable proof was not generally accepted. (For the majority of Jews, the coming of the Messiah necessarily implied national deliverance and the obvious transfiguration of the world.) Henceforth, the parousia was awaited in order to force the conversion of unbelievers. The author of the Gospel of John and his circle of followers give a daring reply to the delay in the parousia. The Kingdom of God has already been inaugurated; it is not automatically universally obvious, just as the Messiah, incarnated in the historic personage of Jesus, was not obvious
51. See Judah Goldin, "On Change and Adaptation in Judaism," pp. 290 ff. 52. After the catastrophe of 70, the Christians began to collect and write down the Jerusalemite traditions concerning the life. ministry. death, and resurrection of Jesus; thus the first Gospels came into existence. 53.

Destruction of the Temple; the parousia delayed 361
to the majority of Jews-and the divinity of Christ still is not so for unbelievers. In short, there is here the same dialectical process that is well known in the whole history of religions: the epiphany of the sacred in a profane object is at the same time a camouflage; for the sacred is not obvious to all those who approach the object in which'it has manifested itself. This time the sacred-the Kingdom of God-manifested itself in a human community that was historically circumscribed: the Church. This revalorization of the parousia opens numerous possibilities for religious experience and theological speculation. Instead of the familiar scenario-the parousia as concrete and unmistakable manifestation of the triumph of God, confirmed by the annihilation of evil and the end of history-there emerges the conviction that the spiritual life can progress and be perfected in this world and that history can be transfigured; in other words, that historical existence is capable of reaching the perfection and bliss of the Kingdom of God. To be sure, the Kingdom will be "obvious" first of all to believers, but every Christian community can become the exemplary model of a sanctified life and hence an incitement to conversion. This new interpretation of the dialectic of the sacred, inaugurated by the identification of the Kingdom with the Church, continues in our day; paradoxically, it is manifested especially in the multitude of "desacralizations" (demythicizations of the Gospels and of tradition, banalization of the liturgy, simplification of sacramental life, antimystical tendencies and depreciation of religious symbolism, exclusive interest in the ethical values and social function of churches, etc.)-"desacralizations" that are in the course of being brought about in the contemporary Christian world (see vol. 3).

and Gnosis in the Imperial Period
225. Jam redit et Virgo .•.
If the cult of the Great Mother Cybele was patronized by the Roman aristocracy (see p. 134), the success of other Oriental religions, introduced later, was insured by the urban proletariat and by the large number of foreigners settled in Rome. During the last two centuries of the Republic the traditional religionthat is, the public cults-had gradually lost its prestige. Certain priestly functions (e.g., those ofthejlamen Dialis) and a number of sodalities had fallen into desuetude. As everywhere else in the Hellenistic period, religiosity displayed itself under the sign of the goddess Fortuna (Tyche) and in astral fatalism (§ 205). Magic and astrology attracted not only the masses but also certain philosophers (the Stoics recognized the validity of astrology). During the civil wars a large number of apocalypses of Oriental origin were in circulation: those known by the name of the Sibylline Oracles announced the imminent collapse of Roman power.

"At every historical crisis two crepuscular myths obsessed the Roman people: (\) the life of the city is ended. its duration being limited to a certain number of years (the 'mystic number' revealed by the twelve eagles seen by Romulus): and (2) the Great Year will put an end to all history, hence to that of Rome, by a universal ekpyrosis [conflagration]. Roman history itself undertook to show the baselessness of these fears. down to a very late period. For at the end of 120 years after the foundation of Rome. it was realized that the twelve eagles seen by Romulus did not signify 120 years of historical life for the city. as many had feared.

of contemporary history. Horace did not hide his fear of the approaching fate of the city (see his Sixteenth Epode). When Caesar crossed the Rubicon, the Neo-Pythagorean Nigidius Figulus announced the beginning of a cosmico-historical drama that would put an end to Rome and even to the human race (Lucan, Pharsalia 639, 642-45). But the reign of Augustus, coming after the long and disastrous civil wars, seemed to inaugurate a pax aeterna. The fears inspired by the two mythsthe "age" of Rome and the Great Year-now proved to be groundless. For, on the one hand, Augustus had just founded Rome anew, hence there was nothing to fear as to its duration; on the other hand, the passage from the Iron Age to the Age of Gold had taken place without a cosmic catastrophe. Indeed, Vergil replaced the last saecu/um, that of the Sun-which was to bring on the universal combustion-by the century of Apollo; he thus avoided the ekpyrosis and considered that the civil wars themselves actually indicated the passage from the Iron Age to the Age of Gold. Later, when Augustus' reign seemed really to have inaugurated the Golden Age, Vergil tried to reassure the Romans as to the duration of the city. In the Aeneid (1. 255 ff.) Jupiter, speaking to Venus, assures her that he will impose no kind of spatial or temporal limitation on the Romans: "I have given them endless rule" (imperium sine fine dedi). After the pUblication of the Aeneid, Rome was named urbs aeterna, Augustus being proclaimed the city's second founder. His birthday, September 23, was regarded "as the point of departure of the Universe, whose existence Augustus had saved as he had changed its face."2 Then the hope spread that Rome could be periodically regenerated ad infinitum. It was thus that, freed from the myths of the twelve eagles and the ekpyrosis, Rome could spread, as Vergil announced (Aeneid 6. 798), even to the regions "that lie beyond the roads of the Sun and the year" (extra anni solisque vias).

the eternal renewal of Rome, to recover the archaic myth of the annual regeneration of the cosmos by means of its periodic recreation (by sacrificers or by the sovereign). It is likewise an attempt to valorize history on the cosmic plane, that is, to regard historical events and catastrophes as true cosmic combustions or dissolutions, which must periodically put an end to the universe to allow its regeneration. The wars, the destructions, the sufferings brought on by history are no longer the precursory signs of the passage from one cosmic age to another: they are themselves that passage. Thus, at each period of peace, history is renewed, and, in consequence, a new world begins; in the last analysis (as is shown by the myth that arose around Augustus), the sovereign repeats the creation of the cosmos.3 In his Fourth Eclogue Vergil announces that the Age of Gold is about to begin again under the consulate of Asinius Pollio (ca. 40 B.C., that is, before Octavius' final victory). "It is the birth of a new cycle of ages [magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo]. Now the Virgin returns Uam redit et Virgo], returns now the reign of Saturn." A "golden race" springs up throughout the world, and Apollo is its sovereign (5-10). Now Vergil associates all these signs pointing to the return of the Age of Gold with the birth of a child whose identity is unknown but whom numerous scholars suppose to be the son of Pollio. The meaning of this inspired and enigmatic poem has long been discussed and is still under discussion. For our purpose, it is enough to emphasize Vergil's visionary power: like a true vates, he grasped the simultaneously cosmic and religious context of the end of the civil wars, and he divined the eschatological function of the peace inaugurated by the victory of Octavius Augustus. And in fact the reign of Augustus marks a creative rebirth of the traditional Roman religion. 4 According to Suetonius (Aug. 90-92), Augustus behaved like a true Roman of the olden times, taking into account dreams and other warnings, observing the manifestations of the gods, practicing pietas in regard to divinities and men. "It is this religio, and not the Stoic theology, that

always dictated the emperor's decisive acts .... Through pietas and religio, the religious attitude and the ideals of the Roman past were consciously recovered and renewed."5 Augustus decreed the restoration of ruined sanctuaries and built many new temples. He reestablished sacerdotal positions that had long been vacant (e.g., the position of flamen Dialis), and he revived sodalities as venerable as that of the Titii, the Luperci, and the Arval Brothers. His contemporaries did not doubt the authenticity of the change. "The advent ofthe new age was celebrated in the songs of poets as well as in public manifestations" (Altheim, History of Roman Religion, p. 372). And works of art of Augustus' century brilliantly show the renewal of religious experience and thought. History set itself to give the lie to the Age of Gold as soon as Augustus died, and the Romans returned to living in expectation of imminent disaster. But the century of Augustus remained the exemplary model for the civilization of the Christian West. What is more, Vergil, and Cicero in part, inspired the theology of literature and, in general, the theology of culture that was typical of the Middle Ages and that continued into the Renaissance.
226. The tribulations of a religio il1icila
After his death Julius Caesar was proclaimed a god among the gods, and in ca. 29 a temple was consecrated to him in the Forum. The Romans consented to the postmortem apotheosis of their great leaders but refused them deification in their lifetimes.6 Augustus accepted divine honors nowhere but in the provinces; at Rome he was only "son of god," Divi filius. However, the imperial genius (attendant spirit) was venerated at official and private banquets. The deification of the "good" emperors and, in consequence, the organization of the imperial cult became general after

AugustuS.7 But Tiberius was not deified, because Caligula failed to present the request for it to the Senate. As for Caligula, he had seen to it that he was deified before his death; however, his memory was officially condemned by the senators. Claudius, Vespasian, and Titus were apotheosized, but not Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, who did not deserve it; nor was Domitian, enemy of the Senate. Once the apparatus of succession was firmly established, all the great emperors of the second century were deified; this did not happen in the third century, when the emperors succeeded one another too rapidly.H From the second century on, refusal to celebrate the imperial cult was the chief basis for the persecutions of Christians. At first, except for the slaughter ordered by Nero, anti-Christian measures were chiefly encouraged by the hostility of Roman public opinion. During the first two centuries, Christianity was considered a religio illicita, and Christians were persecuted because they practiced a clandestine religion, pne that had no official authorization. In 202 Septimus Severus published the first anti-Christian decree, forbidding proselytizing. Soon afterward, Maximus attacked the ecclesiastical hierarchy, but unsuccessfully. Until the reign of Decius, the Church developed in peace. But in 250 Decius published an edict requiring all citizens to offer sacrifices to the gods of the Empire. The persecution, though short, was extremely severe, which explains the large number of abjurations. However, chiefly by virtue of its confessors and martyrs, the Church emerged from the ordeal victorious. The repression decided on by Valerian in 257-58 was followed by a long period of peace (260-303). Christianity was able to infiltrate everywhere in the Empire and on every social level (even into the emperor's family). The last persecution-Diocletian's (303-5)-was the longest and the most sanguinary. Despite the dramatic situation of the Empire, public opinion this time showed itself less hostile to the Christians. Now Diocletian had made up his mind to destroy this exotic and antinational religion precisely in order to strengthen

the idea of Empire; he wanted to reanimate the old Roman religious traditions and, above all, to glorify the quasi-divine image of the emperor. But the heritage of Augustus' reform had been gradually eroded. Cults native to Egypt and Asia Minor enjoyed an astonishing popularity; they also benefited from imperial protection. Commodus (185-92) had been initiated into the Mysteries of Isis and those of Mithra, and Caracalla (211-17) had encouraged the cult of the Syrian solar god, Sol Invictus. Some years later, the Emperor Heliogabalus, himself a Syrian and a priest of the god of Emesa, introduced this cult into Rome. HeIiogabalus was assassinated in 222, and the Syrian god was then banished from the city. However, as we shall see (p. 411), Aurelian (270-75) successfully reintroduced the cult of Sol Invictus. Aurelian understood that it was useless simply to glorify the great religious past of Rome; it was necessary also to integrate into the venerable Roman tradition a monotheistic solar theology, the only religion that was in the process of becoming universal. Even before the great persecutions, toward the end of the second century, several Christian theologians and controversialists tried to justify and defend their religion before the authorities and the pagan intelligentsia. But their attempt was doomed to fail. Naive or unskillful, certain apologists (Tatian, Tertullian) virulently attacked paganism and Hellenistic culture. The most important of them, Justin (martyred ca. 165), attempted to show that Christianity did not scorn pagan culture; he praised Greek philosophy but pointed out that it was inspired by the biblical revelation. Repeating the arguments of Alexandrian Judaism, Justin affirmed that Plato and the other Greek philosophers knew the doctrine that had been professed, long before their time, by the "prophet" Moses. In any case, the failure of the apologists was foreseeable. For the authorities, Christianity was not only clearly guilty of atheism and lese-majeste. it was suspected of all kinds of crimes, from orgies and incest to infanticide and cannibalism. For the pagan elite, the essence of Christian theology-the incarnation of the Savior, his sufferings and resurrection-was simply unintelligible. In any case, the fanatical intransigence of this new religion of salvation made any hope of peaceful coexistence with the polytheistic religions illusory.



368 PAGANISM, CHRISTIANITY, GNOSIS
For the Christian mission, the persecutions constituted the greatest peril; but they were not the only danger threatening the Church. The Mysteries of Isis and of Mithra and the cult of Sol Invictus and solar monotheism represented a competition greatly to be feared, and the more so since they had the benefit of official protection. In addition, a far more subtle danger threatened the Church from within: the various heresies, and first of all Gnosticism. The heresies and gnoses make their appearance from the very beginning of Christianity. In the absence of a canon, the only way to verify the authenticity of beliefs and ritual practices was the apostolic tradition. By about the year 150 all the Apostles and those who had known them personally had died, but transmission of their testimony was insured by a number of texts they had composed or inspired and by oral tradition. However, the two currents of apostolic tradition-written and oral-were both subject to more or less dubious innovations. Besides the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, which were accepted by all of the Christian communities,9 other texts were in circulation under the names of Apostles: the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel ofTruth, the Gospel ofthe Pseudo-Matthew, the Acts of Peter, of John, etc. The majority of these works, termed "apocrypha" (since they contained revelations previously "hidden"), involved the revelation of an esoteric doctrine, communicated to the Apostles by the resurrected Christ and concerning the secret meaning of the events of his life. It was to this secret teaching, preserved and transmitted by oral tradition, that the Gnostics appealed as their authority.
227. Christian gnosis
The problem of esotericism, and consequently of initiation, was to inspire countless controversies, especially and first of all during the crisis brought on by Gnosticism. In the face of the extravagant pretensions of certain Gnostic authors, the Fathers of

Christian gnosis 369
the Church, later followed by the majority of ancient and modern historians, denied the existence of an esoteric teaching practiced by Jesus and continued by his disciples. But this opinion is contradicted by the facts. Esotericism-in other words, the initiatory transmission of doctrines and practices restricted to a limited number of adepts-is documented in all the great religions in both the Hellenistic period and near the beginning of the Christian era. In varying degrees we find the initiatory scenario (secret teaching and rites, segregation of believers, oath of silence, etc.) in normative Judaism and in the Judaic sects, among the Essenes (for example, in the "Treatise of Discipline" 9. 16 ff.; 6. 13-23), and among the Samaritans and the Pharisees. HI The practice of a certain esoteric teaching is likewise mentioned in the Gospel of Mark (4: 10 ff., 7: 17 ff., 10: 10 ff.). From the beginnings of the Church, three degrees-which presuppose initiatory apprenticeship-are distinguished within the community. They are: the "Beginners," the "Progressing," and the "Perfect." According to Origen, "Jesus explained all things to his own disciples privately, and for this reason the writers of the Gospels concealed the clear exposition of the parables" (Commentary on Matthew 14. 12). Clement of Alexandria is still more explicit. He mentions his teachers, who preserved "the true tradition of the blessed teachings, come directly from the holy Apostles Peter, James, John, and Paul, transmitted from father to son [and which] came down to us, thanks be to God" (Stromateis 1. II; 2. 3). This refers to teachings restricted to a certain number of believers and which, transmitted orally (13. 2), must remain secret; these teachings constitute the gnostic tradition. In another work Clement states: "James the Righteous, John, . and Peter were entrusted by the Lord, after his resurrection, with the higher knowledge. They imparted it to the other apostles, the other apostles to the seventy, one of whom was Barnabas."11

It is impossible to determine the criteria that guided the selection of disciples worthy of being initiated into the gnosis, and especially the circumstances and the stages of their initiation. A certain instruction, "esoteric" in type, was gradually given to all believers; it dealt with the symbolism of baptism, the Eucharist, and the Cross, with the archangels, and with the interpretation of the apocalypse. As for the secrets revealed to the "perfect" and those in the course of becoming such, they probably referred to the mysteries of the descent and ascension of Christ through the seven heavens inhabited by the angels (see Ephesians 4:9) and to individual eschatology, that is, to the mystical itinerary of the soul after death. Now this mystical itinerary is connected by Pseudo-Dionysius to the oral tradition of the Apostles. "Thus we are brought to see the existence of a succession of gnostic masters or spiritual masters, separate from the succession of bishops, who transmit the faith of the Apostles ... but who continue the charismatic tradition of apostolic times and of the ApostJes."'2 However, the esoteric traditions of the Apostles carryon a Jewish esotericism concerning the mysteries of the ascent of the soul and the secrets of the celestial world. But these doctrines are also found among the Mandaeans. What is more, they are similar to certain Egyptian (see § 53) and Iranian eschatological conceptions. Side by side with other ideas and beliefs that differ from those held in common by Judaism and Christianity, they are found in a number of Gnostic, pagan, and heterodox Christian authors. We understand why, from a certain moment, gnosis and esotericism became suspect in the eyes of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. By citing the authority of an oral and secret apostolic tradition, certain Gnostics could introduce into Christianity doctrines and practices radically opposed to the ethos of the Gospel. It was not esotericism and gnosis as such that were found to be dangerous but the heresies that infiltrated themselves under the cloak of initiatory secrecy. To be sure, as long as the "Book" and the dogmas were not fixed, it could seem an abuse to apply the term "heretical" to certain daring interpretations of Christ's teaching. But in a num

Approaches of Gnosticism 371
ber of cases the heresy-that is, the false interpretation of the Gospel message-was obvious: for example, when the validity of the Old Testament was rejected and God the Father was regarded as a malevolent and stupid demiurge; similarly, when the world was condemned and life was denigrated as accidental or demonic creations, or when the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Son were denied. It is true that Saint Paul himself regarded this world as dominated by Satan, and the Jewish and Christian apocalypses predicted the imminent destruction of the earth. But neither Saint Paul nor the authors of the apocalypses denied the divine origin of the Creation.
228. Approaches of Gnosticism
It is difficult to determine the origin ofthe spiritual current known by the name of "Gnosticism," but it must be distinguished from the numerous earlier or contemporary gnoses that formed an integral part of various religions of the time (Zoroastrianism, the Mysteries, Judaism, Christianity)-gnoses that, as we have just seen, included an esoteric teaching. It must be added that almost all the mythological and eschatological themes employed by the Gnostic authors are earlier than Gnosticism stricto sensu. Some of them are documented in ancient Iran and in India of the Upanishadic period, in Orphism and Platonism; others are characteristic of Hellenistic syncretism, biblical and intertestamentaIt Judaism, or the earliest expressions of Christianity. However, what defines Gnosticism stricto sensu is not the more or less organic integration of a certain number of disparate elements but the daring, and strangely pessimistic, reinterpretation of certain myths, ideas, and theologoumena that were in wide circulation at the time. 13 A formula of Valentinian gnosis, transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, declares that one obtains deliverance by learning
13. Thus, for example, the Gnostic doctors reinterpreted the myth of Christ's descent into the world by detaching it from its biblical context-the Messiah sent by the creator God-and connecting it with an entirely different "secret history" (the Creation is a sinister tragedy and must therefore be attributed to a demiurge or a demonic being, a true incarnation of evil).

"what we were and what we have become; where we were and where we have been cast; toward what end we hasten and whence we are redeemed; what is birth and what is regeneration" (Extracts/rom Theodotus 78.2). Unlike the Upanishads, SfullkhyaYoga, and Buddhism-which deliberately avoid discussing the original cause of the fall of humanity-the redeeming knowledge taught by the Gnostics consists above all in the revelation of a "secret history" (more precisely, a history kept secret from the uninitiated) of the origin and creation of the world, the origin of evil, the drama of the divine redeemer come down to earth to save men, and the final victory of the transcendent God-a victory that will find expression in the conclusion of history and the annihilation of the cosmos. This is a total myth: it reports all the decisive elements, from the origin of the world to the present and, by demonstrating their interdependence, insures the credibility of the eschaton. This total myth is known to us in numerous versions. We shall mention some of them further on, especially emphasizing the most grandiose among them, the version elaborated by Mani (§ 233). To return to the Valentinian formula, the Gnostic learns that his true being (i.e., his spiritual being) is divine by origin and by nature, though at present it is captive in a body; he also learns that he lived in a transcendent region but that he was later cast into this world below, that he is rapidly advancing toward salvation, and that he will end by being freed from his fleshly prison; in short, he discovers that, whereas his birth was equivalent to a fall into matter, his rebirth will be purely spiritual. The following fundamental ideas are to be noted: the dualism of spirit/matter, divine (transcendent)/antidivine; the myth of the fall of the soul (= spirit, divine particle), that is, incarnation in a body (assimilated to a prison); and the certainty of deliverance (salvation) obtained by virtue of gnosis. At first sight, we would seem to be dealing with an exaggerated, anticosmic, and pessimistic development of Orphico-Platonic dualism. 14 In reality the phenomenon is more complex. The

drama of humanity-in particular, its fall and redemption-reflects the divine drama. God sends a primordial being, or his own son, into the world in order to save men. This transcendent being undergoes all the humiliating consequences of incarnation but is able to reveal the true, redeeming gnosis to a few chosen spirits before finally returning to heaven. Some variants give a more dramatic amplification to the descent of the son or the transcendent being: he is captured by demonic powers and, brutalized by immersion in matter, forgets his own identity; God then sends a messenger who, by "awakening" him, helps him recover consciousness of himself. (This is the myth of the "saved Savior," admirably narrated in the "Hymn of the Pearl"; see § 230.) Despite certain Iranian parallels, the immediate model of the savior-messenger sent by God is obviously Jesus Christ. The texts discovered in 1945 at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt demonstrate the Judaeo-Christian origin of some important Gnostic schools. 15 Yet their theologies and ethics are radically different from those professed by Judaism and Christianity. First of all, for the Gnostics, the true God is not the creator God, that is, Yahweh. The Creation is the work of lower or even diabolical powers, or, alternatively, the cosmos is the more or less demonic counterfeit of a superior world-conceptions inconceivable both for the Jews and the Christians. To be sure, in late paganism the cosmogony had lost all positive religious meaning. But the Gnostics go still further. Not only is the creation of the world no longer a proof of God's omnipotence; it is explained by an accident that occurred in the higher regions or as the result of the primordial aggression of Darkness against Light (see the Manichaean myth, § 233). As for incarnate existence, far from being a part of a "sacred history," as the Jews and the Christians thought, it confirms and illustrates the fall of the soul. For the
incarnation of the soul, for Plotinus it is a "fall," since the soul loses its spiritual plenitude and its autonomy (4. 8; 5. 16); but it is also a descent freely accepted in order to help existences placed in the lower world (4. 8; 7. I). 15. Thus, for example, the Gospel according to Thomas, found at Nag Hammadi, constitutes the complete version of the logia attributed to Jesus in the Oxyrynchus papyri and known since 1897; see H.-C. Puech, En qUele de fa Gnose, vol. 2, pp. 33 fT., 65 fr., and passim.

Gnostic, the only object worth pursuing was the deliverance of that divine particle and its reascent to the celestial spheres. As we saw (§§181 ff.), the "fall" of man, that is, the incarnation of the soul, was already a prime object of speculation for the Orphic and Pythagorean theologians; it was explained either as the punishment for a sin committed in heaven or as the result of a disastrous choice made by the soul itself. During the earliest centuries of the Christian era, these two myths were amplified and modified by numerous Gnostic and other authors. 16 Since the world is the result of an accident or a catastrophe, since it is dominated by ignorance and ruled by the powers of evil, the Gnostic finds himself completely alienated from his own culture and rejects all of its norms and institutions. The inner freedom obtained by gnosis enables him to comport himself freely and to act as he pleases. The Gnostic forms part of an elite, the result of a selection decided by the Spirit. He belongs to the class of Pneumatics or "Spirituals"-the "Perfect," the "Sons of the King"-who alone will be savedY Just like the t:~is, the sannyasis, and the yogins, the Gnostic feels that he is freed from the laws that govern society: he is beyond good and evil. And, to pursue the comparison with Indian phenomena: to the sexual techniques and orgiastic rituals of the Tantric schools of "the left hand" (see vol. 3, chap. 38) there correspond the orgies ofthe libertine Gnostic sects (first of all, the Phibionists).IK

Marcion. Bardesanes). by Mani. by the author of the Kore Kosmou, and. probably. by Origen. As for the soul's voluntary descent. it resulted from narcissism (the soul fell in love with its own image reflected in the material world) or from ambition. This conception is documented in Numenius of Apamaea. in the author of the Poimandres, and in Plotinus; see the references brought together by E. R. Dodds. Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety, pp. 23-24.

229. From Simon Magus to Valentinus
The Christian apologists denounce in Simon Magus the first heretic and the ancestor of all heresies. According to some historians, Simon is not a Gnostic stricto sensu, but his disciples became such after the catastrophe of the year 70. 19 The Apostle Peter ran afoul of the Simonian movement in Samaria, where Simon proclaimed himself "the divine Power that is called great."20 And in fact he was worshiped as the "first God," and his companion, Helen, discovered by Simon in a brothel at Tyre, was regarded as the last and most fallen incarnation of the Thought (Ennoia) of God; redeemed by Simon, Helen-Ennoia became the means of universal redemption. Simon Magus is of interest to the historian of religions especially for the glorification of Helen and the mythology that she inspired. The union of the "magician" with the prostitute insured universal salvation because their union is, in reality, the reunion of God and divine Wisdom. The memory of this eccentric couple in all probability gave rise to the legend of Faust, the archetype of the magician. In fact, Simon was known in Rome as Faustus ("Favored"), and his companion had, in a previous existence, been Helen of Troy. But in the first centuries of the Christian era, emphasis was laid on the supreme confrontation between the Apostle Peter and the magician. According to the legend, Simon, in the presence of a large number of spectators in Rome, announced his ascent to
existence, the world, God himself. It can lead equally well to imagining a final event that will be an eversio. revollitio-an overturning and reversal of the present situation, reciprocal substitution of left and right, outer and inner, higher and lower-or to nihilism: a nihilism of the 'libertine Gnostics' who, freed from all natural or moral law, use and abuse their body and the world in order to profane them, to 'exhaust: deny, and annihilate them: the nihilism of a Basilides, for whom every being, every thing, the uriiverse in the totality of its becoming, is destined to find its definitive fulfillment in the darkness of
the 'Great Ignorance: in the peace of 'nonbeing' " (H.-c. Puech, En quete de la Gnose, vol. I, p. xxii).

heaven, but a prayer uttered by the Apostle made him fall lamentably. The example of Marcion is instructive for several reasons. He was born ca. 85 in Pontus; son of the bishop of Sinope, he largely adhered to orthodox practices. But he developed the Pauline anti-Judaism to excess. Marcion rejected the Old Testament and established his own canon, which was reduced to Luke's Gospel and Paul's ten Epistles. He added a manual, the Antitheses, in which he set forth the principles of his theology. At Rome about 144 Marcion tried in vain to obtain the support of the presbyters. Excommunicated, he elaborated his doctrine more and more radically and actually founded a church. An excellent organizer, he succeeded in converting a large number of Christian communities in the Mediterranean Basin; This new theology had considerable success and hence was tirelessly attacked by orthodox writers. But from the beginning of the third century Marcionism was in decline, and it disappeared in the West in less than a century. Marcion accepted the essentials of Gnostic dualism, but without embracing its apocalyptic implications. His dualistic system opposes the Law and justice, instituted by the creator god ofthe Old Testament, to the love and the Gospel revealed by the good God. The latter sends his son, Jesus Christ, to deliver men from slavery to the Law. Jesus assumes a body capable of feeling and suffering, though it is not material. In his preaching, Jesus glorifies the good God but is careful to state that he does not mean the god of the Old Testament. Indeed, it is from Jesus' preaching that Yahweh learns of the existence of a transcendent God. He avenges himself by delivering Jesus to his persecutors. But the death on the Cross brings salvation, for by his sacrifice Jesus redeems humanity from the creator god. However, the world continues to be under the domination of Yahweh, and believers will be persecuted until the end of time. It is only then that the good God will make himself known: he will receive the faithful into his Kingdom, while the rest of mankind, together with matter and the creator, will be definitively annihilated. Another Samaritan, Menander, introduced Gnosticism into Antioch. He presented himself as the redeemer come down from heaven to save men (lrenaeus, Adversus haereses 1. 23. 8), and

claimed that those whom he baptized would become superior to the angels. His heir, Satomil (active at Antioch between ca. 100 and 130), opposed the hidden God to the God of the Jews, mere leader of the creator angels. He condemned marriage, which he declared to be the work of Satan (Irenaeus, 1.24.2). His theology was dominated by dualism. According to Irenaeus, Satomil was the first to speak of the two categories of men, those who have and those who do not have the celestial light. Cerinthus, a Judaeo-Christian contemporary of John (Irenaeus, 3.3.4), teaches that the world was created by a demiurge who did not know the true God; this is the first expression of Gnosticism stricto sensu~ According to Cerinthus, Jesus is the son of Joseph and Mary; at his baptism Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove and revealed the Unknown Father to him and then, before the Passion, reascended to God the Father (Irenaeus, 1. 28). Judaeo-Christian Gnosticism, disseminated in Asia and Syria, also made its way into Egypt. Cerinthus settled in Alexandria, where, about 120, Carpocrates proclaimed a similar doctrine: Jesus is the son of Joseph, but a "power" sanctified him (Irenaeus, 1. 23. l). He who receives this power becomes the equal of Jesus and is able to perform the same miracles. A characteristic feature of Carpocrates' gnosis is his radical amoralism, "which seems to arise from the Gnostic revolt not only against the Jewish God but against the Law."21 Basilides, another Alexandrian, contemporary with Carpocrates, gave the first synthesis of the doctrines taught by the disciples of Simon Magus. He elaborated a vast and complex cosmogony of the Gnostic type, spectacularly mUltiplying the heavens and the angels that rule them: he reckoned their number at 365122 Basilides entirely rejected the Jewish Law and regarded Yahweh as only one of the angels who created the world, though he attempts to dominate and subject them all (Irenaeus, 1. 24. 4). The most important Gnostic teacher is indubitably Valentinus, who ranks among the greatest theologians and mystics of his

time. Born in Egypt and educated in Alexandria. he taught at Rome between 135 and 160. But since he did not succeed in obtaining the position of bishop, he broke with the Church and left the city.23 In elaborating his grandiose system, Valentinus set out to explain the existence of evil and the fall of the soul not from a dualistic point of view-i.e.. by the intervention of an anti-God-but by a drama that took place within the divinity. No summary does justice to the magnificence and boldness of the Valentinian synthesis, yet a summary has the advantage of omitting the countless genealogies, "emanations," and "projections" summoned up with touching monotony to explain the origin and relate the drama of all cosmic, vital. psychic, and
spiritual realities. 24 According to Valentinus, the Father, absolute and transcendent First Principle, is invisible and incomprehensible. He unites with his companion, Thought (Ennoia), and engenders the fifteen pairs of eons that, together, constitute the Pleroma.25 The last ofthe eons, Sophia, blinded by desire to know the Father, brings on a crisis, as the result of which evil and the passions make their appearance. Precipitated from the Pleroma, Sophia and the aberrant creations that she had occasioned produce an inferior wisdom. Above, a new couple is created, Christ and his feminine partner, the Holy Spirit. Finally, restored to its original perfection, the Pleroma engenders the Savior. also named Jesus. Descending to the lower regions, the Savior forms "invisible

But the Gospel of Truth. discovered at Nag Hammadi. though it is not the work of Valentinus. certainly represents his thought. Other texts from Nag Hammadi (for example. the "Treatise of the Three Natures" and the "Letter to Rhegius on the Resurrection") are connected with the Valentinian school. 24. The fascination exercised by such cascading genealogies and series of manifestations is one of the specific characteristics of the period. The tendency to multiply the intermediate stages and the mediating agents between the Absolute and the various classes of realities is also present in the philosophers (for example. Plotinus): but among the Gnostic authors-especially Basilides. Valentinus. and Mani-it became at once an obsession and a stereotype. 25. The term Pleroma (Gk. plerijmll. "plenitude") designates the spiritual world around the primordial divinity: it is constituted by the totality of the eons.

matter" with the hylic (material) elements proceeding from the lower Wisdom, and with the psychic elements he makes the Demiurge, i.e., the God of Genesis. The latter knows nothing of the existence of a higher world and considers himself the only God. He creates the material world and, animating them with his breath, forms two categories of men, the Hylics and the Psychics. But the spiritual elements, proceeding from the higher Sophia, introduce themselves into the Demiurge's breath, unknown to him, and give birth to the class of Pneumatics. 26 In order to save these spiritual particles, captive in matter, Christ descends to earth and, without incarnating himself in the strict sense of the word, reveals the liberating knowledge. Thus, awakened by gnosis, the Pneumatics, and they a/one, ascend to the Father. As Hans Jonas observes, in Valentinus' system matter has a spiritual origin and is explained by divine history. Indeed matter is a state or an "affection" ofthe absolute Being-more precisely, the "solidified external expression" of that state. Ignorance (the "blindness" of Sophia) is the first cause of the existence of the world27-an idea that is reminiscent of Indian conceptions (held by certain Vedantic and Sarpkhya-Yoga schools). And, just as in India, ignorance and knowledge characterize two types of ontologies. Knowledge constitutes the original condition of the Absolute; ignorance is the consequence of some disorder produced within this same Absolute. But the salvation procured by knowledge is equivalent to a cosmic event (see Jonas, p. 175). The redemption of the last Pneumatic will be accompanied by the annihilation of the world.

and wanting to know the pleasures of the body, the soul forgets its own identity. "It forgets its original dwelling place, its true center, its eternal being."28 The most dramatic and moving presentation of the Gnostic myth of amnesia and anamnesia is found in the "Hymn of the Pearl,"29 preserved in the apocryphal Acts of Thomas. A prince arrives in Egypt from the East to seek
the one pearl Which is in the midst of the sea Hard by the loud-breathing serpent.
In Egypt he is captured by men of the country. They give him some of their food to eat, and the prince forgets his identity:
I forgot that I was a son of kings. And I served their king; And I forgot the pearl for which my parents had sent me. And by reason of the burden of their foods I lay in a deep sleep.
But the prince's parents learned what had happened to him, and they wrote him a letter:
"Up and arise from thy sleep And listen to the words of our letter! Call to mind that thou art a son of kings! See the slavery-whom thou servest. Remember the pearl for which thou Didst speed to Egypt!"
The letter flew in the likeness of an eagle, alighted beside him, and became speech.
At its voice and the sound of its rustling I started and arose from my sleep. I took it up and kissed it, I loosed its seal [?], [and] read.... I remembered that I was a son of kings. . . . I remembered the pearl for which I had been sent to Egypt, And I began to charm ...

This is the myth of the "saved Savior," Sa/vator sa/vatus, in its best version. It must be added that parallels for each mythical motif are found in the various Gnostic texts.30 The meaning of the images is easy to apprehend. The sea and Egypt are common symbols for the material world, in which man's soul and the savior sent to deliver it are both taken captive. Descending from the celestial regions, the hero lays off his "bright robe" and puts on the "filthy garb" in order not to differ from the inhabitants of the country; it is the "fleshly envelope," the body in which he is incarnated. At a certain moment during his ascension he is met by his glorious garment of light, "like unto himself," and he understands that this "double" is his true Self. His meeting with his transcendent "double" is reminiscent of the Iranian conception of the celestial image of the soul, the daena, which meets the deceased on the third day after his death (see vol. 1, pp. 329 ff., 472). As Jonas observed, the discovery of this transcendent principle within one's Self constitutes the central element of the Gnostic religionY The theme of the amnesia brought on by immersion in "life" (= matter) and ofthe anamnesia obtained by the gestures, songs, or words of a messenger is also found in the religious folklore of medieval India. One of the most popular legends tells of the anamnesia of Matsyendranath. This master yogin fell in love with a queen and went to live in her palace, completely forgetting his identity, or, according to another version, he became a pris

See also Puech, En quere de fa Gnose. vol. 2, pp. 118 ff. 31. Jonas, Gnostic Religion. p. 124. In the apocryphal Gospel according to Thomas (logion 84), Jesus says to his disciples, "When you see your images, which came into existence before you, [which] neither die nor are manifested, how much will you bear!" The "image" (eik6n), that is, the transcendent Self, is also described as an "angel"; see Puech, En quere. vol. 2, pp. 130 ff., 142 ff. The meeting of the transcendent Self with the "ange'" can be compared to the ineffable experience of the unity atman-brahman.

oner of the women "in the land of Kadali." Learning of Matsyendranath's captivity, his disciple Goraknath comes before him in the form of a dancing girl and falls to dancing, at the same time singing enigmatic songs. Little by little Matsyendranath remembers his true identity: he understand's that the "fleshly way" leads to death, that his "forgetting" was, fundamentally, a forgetting of his true and immortal nature, and that the "charms of Kadali" represent the mirages of profane life. Goraknath explains to him that it was the goddess Durga who had brought on the "forgetting" that had almost cost him immortality. This spell, Goraknath adds, symbolizes the eternal curse of ignorance laid by nature (i.e., Durga) on the human being. 32 The "origins" of this folklore theme go back to the period of the Upanishads. We earlier summarized the fable in the Chlindof(ya Upani~ad about the man captured by robbers and carried far from his village with his eyes blindfolded, and Sankara's commentary on it: the robbers and the blindfold are the teacher who reveals true knowledge; the house to which the man succeeds in returning symbolizes his atman, his Self, identical with the absolute being, brahman (see above, § 136). Sarpkhya-Yoga presents a similar position: the Self (puru~a) is, above all, a "stranger"; it has nothing to do with the world (prakrti). Just as for the Gnostics, the Self (the spirit, the pneuma) "is isolated, indifferent, inactive, a mere spectator" in the drama of life and history (see §§ 136 ff.). Influences, in one direction or the other, are not excluded, but it is more probable that this is a case of parallel spiritual currents, developing out of crises brought on several centuries earlier in India (the Upanishads), in Greece and the eastern Mediterranean (Orphism and Pythagoreanism), in Iran, and in the Hellenistic world. A number of images and metaphors used by the Gnostic authors have a venerable history-even a prehistory-and an immense dissemination. One of the favorite images is that of sleep assimilated to ignorance and death. The Gnostics maintain that men not only sleep but love to sleep. "Why will you always love sleep and stumble with those that stumble?" asks the

Gnostic myths, images, and metaphors 383
GinzaY "Let him who hears wake from heavy sleep," it is written in the Apocalypse of John.34 As we shall see, the same motif is found in Manichaeanism. But such formulas are no monopoly of the Gnostic authors. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians (5:14) contains this anonymous quotation: "Wake up from your sleep, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." Sleep (Hypnos) being the twin brother of Thanatos (Death), in Greece as in India and in Gnosticism, the act of "awakening" had a soteriological meaning (in the broad sense of the term: Socrates "awakens" his interlocutors, sometimes against their will). This is an archaic and universally disseminated symbolism. Victory over sleep and prolonged wakefulness are a rather typical initiatory ordeal. Among certain Australian tribes the novices who are being initiated must not sleep for three days; alternatively, they are forbidden to go to bed before dawn. 35 We have seen the initiatory ordeal in which the famous hero Gilgamesh fails miserably: he cannot stay awake, and he loses his chance to obtain immortality (see § 23). In a North American myth of the Orpheus-and-Eurydice type, a man succeeds in descending to the underworld, where he finds his wife. who had just died. The lord of the underworld promises him that he can take his wife back to earth if he can stay awake all night. But twice, and even after sleeping during the day in order not to be tired, the man fails to stay awake until dawn. 36 It is clear, then, that "not to sleep" is not only to overcome physical fatigue; it is, above all, to demonstrate the possession of spiritual strength. To remain "awake," to be fully conscious, means: to be present to the world of the spirit. Jesus constantly told his disciples to "stay awake" (see, for example. Matt. 24:42). And the night of Gethsemane is made especially tragic by the disciples' inability to "keep awake" with Jesus (see above, p. 336).

In Gnostic literature, ignorance and sleep are also expressed in terms of "intoxication." The apocryphal Gospel of Truth compares him "who is to have knowledge" with "one who, having become drunk, has turned away from his drunkenness, [and] having returned to himself, has set right what are [sic] his own."37 "Awakening" implies anamnesia, the rediscovery of the soul's true identity, that is to say, re-cognition of its celestial origin. "Awake, soul of splendor, from the slumber of drunkenness into which thou hast fallen," says a Manichaean text. "Follow me to the place of the exalted earth where thou didst dwell at the beginning." In the Mandaean tradition the celestial messenger addresses Adam, after waking him from his deep sleep: "Slumber not nor sleep, and forget not that with which the Lord hath charged thee."38 In the last analysis, the majority of these images-ignorance, amnesia, captivity, sleep, intoxication-become, in Gnostic preaching, metaphors to indicate spiritual death. Gnosis bestows true life, that is, redemption and immortality.
231. The martyred Paraclete
Mani was born on April 14 of the year 216, at Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Babylonia. According to tradition, for three days his father, Patek, heard a voice bidding him not to eat flesh, not to drink wine, and to remain apart from women. Troubled, Patek joined a Gnostic baptismal sect, the Elchasaites.39 The child came into the world sickly (he was probably lame). When he reached the age of four, his father took him to live with him in order that he should be brought up in the Elchasaite community. For more than twenty years (from 219/220 to 240) Mani grew up and was educated in a milieu of great Judaeo-Christian fervor. Hence the importance of the Christian elements in the Manichaean synthesis must not be underestimated. Yet Mani's religious vocation

manifested itself in opposition to the theology, the eschatology, and the rituals of Christianity. Two revelations, received, respectively, at the ages of twelve and twenty-four years, by disclosing his own mission to him obliged him to break with the Elchasaite sect. Mani himself has informed us of the content of these revelations. An angel brought him messages from the "King of the Paradise of Lights" (the supreme and good God ofManichaeanism). In the first message he was ordered to abandon his father's community. Twelve years later, in 240, the second message urged him to act: •The time is now come for thee to manifest thyself publicly and to proclaim thy doctrine aloud."40 We know almost nothing of the spiritual travail that transformed the young weakling into the tireless apostle of a new religion of salvation. Nor do we know the reasons that decided him to undertake his first apostolic journey to India, which lasted from 240/41 to the beginning of 242 or 243.41 In any case, contact with certain representatives of Indian spirituality had consequences both for Mani and for India. Summoned back to Persia by the new king, Shapur I, Mani journeyed to Balapat (Gundev Shapur), the capital of the Sassanids. Shapur was deeply impressed by the prophet and gave him, as well as his missionaries, permission to preach throughout the empire. This amounted to official recognition of the new religion, and the date has been piously preserved: March 21, 242 (or, according to a different calculation, April 9, 243). We are poorly informed concerl).ing Mani's biography during the reign of Shapur I (from 242 to 273).

its end (disgrace, death). What seems certain is that he remained on good terms with the king and that he undertook long journeys as a preacher through the whole Iranian empire, as far as its eastern boundary. He also sent numerous missions to the interior of the empire and abroad (to Egypt, Bactriana, etc.). In April, 272, Shapur died, and his son Hormizd succeeded him. Mani hastened to meet him. From the new sovereign he obtained the renewal of the letters of protection, together with permission to go to Babylonia. But scarcely a year later Hormizd died and the throne passed to his brother, Bahram I. Summoned to appear before the king, Mani arrived at Gundev Shapur after a journey that can be considered his "supreme pastoral tour." the "apostle's farewell visit to the scenes of his youth and the churches that he had founded."42 And in fact, as soon as he arrived, he was accused by the leader of the Magians, the inflexible !nohi'd, Karter: Mani's preaching, this prime mover in Mazdaean intolerance maintained, led the king's subjects away from the official religion. Mani's interview with the king was stormy. When Mani proclaimed the divine character of his mission, Bahram burst out: "Why was this revelation made to thee, and not to Us. who are the masters of the land?" Mani could answer only "Such is the will of God."43 Condemned, he was chained and put in prison. The chains (three on his hands, three on his feet, and one on his neck) made it impossible for him to move, and their weight (about twenty kilos) caused atrocious suffering. This passion-which the Manichaeans have designated by the Christian term "crucifixion"-continued for twenty-six days.44 Nevertheless, the prophet was able to receive visits from his coreligionists, and
42. Puech, Le Manicheisme, p. 50. According to tradition. Mani addressed his companions: "Look at me and feast your fill on me, my Children, for as for my body I shall depart from you"(cf. Fran<;ois Decret. Mani et III tradition manicheenne, p. 67).
43. Puech, p. 51: cf. Decret. p. 68. 44. In a moving prayer, Mani implores his god: '" have shown the way to the sons of height. I have executed your order, for which' was sent into this world. Now let me be united again with the peace of deliverance so that I shall no longer see the face of enemies and no longer hear their powerful voice. This time, give me the great crown of victory" (F. C. Andreas. Mittelirallische Manichaica ails Chinesisch-Tllrkestan. vol. 3, p. 863).



The Manichaean gnosis 387
tradition, though embroidering on them, has preserved several edifying episodes. Mani died on February 26, 277, aged sixty years. His body was cut to pieces. The head was exposed at the gate of the city; the rest was thrown to the dogs. Immediately after the prophet's death, Bahram ordered a merciless repression of the movement. The Manichaean church seemed on the point of disappearing forever. Yet it continued to progress for centuries, propagating itself in the West as far as the Iberian Peninsula and in the East as far as China.
232. The Manichaean gnosis
Manichaeanism is above all a gnosis and, as such, forms part of the great Gnostic current that we have just presented. But unlike the other founders of sects, Mani sought to create a universal religion, accessible to all and not limited to an esoteric teaching restricted to initiates. He recognized the value of certain earlier religions but considered them incomplete. On the other hand, he proclaimed that he had integrated into his church the essentials of all scriptures and all wisdoms: "As a river joins another river to form a strong current, so the old books are added together in my Scriptures; and they have formed a great Wisdom, such as has not existed.in previous generations" (Kephalia 154, after the translation by Puech, Le Manicheisme, p. 69). And in fact Mani attributes an eminent role to Jesus and makes his own the idea of the Paraclete; he borrows from India the theory of transmigration; above all, he goes back to the central Iranian ideas, first and foremost the dualism Light/Darkness and the eschatological myth. Syncretism was a syndrome characteristic of the period. In Mani's case, it was also a tactical necessity. He wanted to extend his church to the two ends of the Persian Empire, so he was obliged to use the religious languages that were familiar to both the eastern and the western regions. Nevertheless, despite seemingly heterogeneous elements, Manichaeanism possesses the inner unity of a powerful and original creation. A universal religion, like Buddhism and Christianity, Manichaeanism was obliged, like them, to be a missionary religion. According to Mani, the preacher must "wander perpetually



388 PAGANISM, CHRISTIANITY, GNOSIS
through the world, preaching the doctrine and guiding men in the truth."45 Finally, and here, too, in harmony with the Zeitgeist, Manichaeanism is a "religion of the book." In order to avoid the controversies and heresies that had shaken Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity, Mani himself composed the seven treatises that make up the canon. Except for the first, the Shiibuhragiin, which he composed in Middle Persian, the others are written in Syriac and or in Eastern Aramaic. Of this large production, very little has been preserved, and that only in translations; but the number and variety of the languages in which these fragments have come down to us (Sogdian, Coptic, Turkish, Chinese, etc.) proclaim the unprecedented success of Manichaean preaching. As in all gnoses, and as is also the case for Sarpkhya-Yoga and Buddhism, the journey to deliverance begins with a rigorous analysis of the human condition. By the mere fact that he lives on this earth, that is, that he is endowed with an incarnate existence, man suffers, which is as much as to say that he is the prey of evil. Deliverance cannot be obtained except through gnosis, the only true science, the knowledge that saves. In conformity with the Gnostic doctrine, a cosmos dominated by evil cannot be the work of God, the good and transcendent, but of his adversary. So the existence of the world presupposes an earlier, precosmic, state, just as the miserable, fallen condition of man supposes a blissful primordial situation. The essence of the Manichaean doctrine can be summarized in two formulas: the two principles and the three moments.46 Now these two formulas also constitute the foundation of post-,Gathic Iranian religiosity. So it could be said that Manichaeanism is the Iranian expression, during the syncretistic period, of Gnosticism. On the one hand, Mani reinterpreted certain traditional Iranian concep
45. al-Birftni, Chronology, p. 190; Puech, p. 64. 46. According to a text from Turfan, translated by Pelliot (JA 1913, pp. 110 ff.), he who wished to "enter religion" had to know that there are two principles, absolutely different in nature, light and obscurity, and three moments: the anterior moment, when the world had not yet come into being and when light was separated from darkness; the median, intermediate moment, after darkness had attacked the region oflight; and, finally, the moment beyond, when the two principles will be separated again.



The great myth 389
tions; on the other hand, he integrated into his system a number of elements of diverse origin (Indian, Judaeo-Christian, and Gnostic). For believers, Manichaeanism furnished not only a soteriological ethics and method but also, and above all, a total, absolute science. Salvation is the inevitable effect of gnosis. "Knowing" is equivalent to an anamnesia: the adept recognizes that he is a particle of light, hence of divine nature, for there is consubstantiality between God and souls. Ignorance is the result of the mingling of spirit and body, of spirit and matter (a conception that was dominant in India and elsewhere from the fifth century B.C.). But for Mani, as for all Gnostic teachers, the redeeming gnosis also included knowledge of the secret (or forgotten) history of the cosmos. The adept obtained salvation because he knew the origin of the universe, the cause of the creation of man, the methods employed by the Prince of Darkness and the countermethods elaborated by the Father ofLight. The "scientific explanation" of certain cosmic phenomena, first of all the phases ofthe moon, impressed contemporaries. And in fact, in the great cosmogonic and eschatological myth elaborated by Mani, nature and life play an important part: the drama ofthe soul is reflected in the morphology and the destiny of universal life.
233. The great myth: The fall and redemption of the divine soul
In the beginning, in the "anterior time," the two "natures" or "substances," light and obscurity, good and evil, God and matter, coexisted, separated by a frontier. In the North reigned the Father of Greatness (assimilated to God the Father of the Christians and, in Iran, to Zurvan); in the South, the Prince of Darkness (Ahriman or, for Christians, the Devil). But the "disorderly motion" ofmatter drove the Prince of Darkness toward the upper frontier of his kingdom. Seeing the splendor of light, he is fired by the desire to conquer it. It is then that the Father decides that he will himself repulse the adversary. He "evokes," ,Le., projects from himself, the Mother of Life, who, in her tum,



390 PAGANISM, CHRISTIANITY, GNOSIS
projects a new hypostasis, the Primordial Man (Ohrmizd in the Iranian transpositions). With his five sons, who are, in fact, his "soul," and "armor" made from five lights, the Primordial Man descends to the frontier. He challenges the darkness, but he is conquered, and his sons are devoured by the demons (the Archontes). This defeat marks the beginning of the cosmic "mixture," but at the same time it insures the final triumph of God. For obscurity (matter) now possesses a portion of light-that is, part of the divine soul-and the Father, preparing its deliverance, at the same time arranges for his definitive victory against darkness. In a second Creation, the Father "evokes" the Living Spirit, which, descending toward obscurity, grasps the hand of the Primordial Man47 and raises him to his celestial homeland, the Paradise of Lights. Overwhelming the demonic Archontes, the Living Spirit fashions the heavens from their skins, the mountains from their bones, the earth from their flesh and their excrements. (We here recognize the old myth of creation through the sacrifice of a primordial giant or monster, of the type of Tiamat, Ymir, Puru~a.) In addition, he achieves a first deliverance of light by creating the sun, the moon, and the stars from portions of it that had not suffered too much from contact with obscurity. Finally, the Father proceeds to a last evocation and projects by emanation the Third Messenger. The latter organizes the cosmos into a kind of machine to collect-and, in the last analysis, to deliver-the still-captive particles oflight. During the first two weeks of the month, the particles rise to the moon, which becomes a full moon; during the second two weeks, light is transferred from the moon to the sun and, finally, to its celestial homeland. But there were still the particles that had been swallowed by the demons. Then the messenger displays himselfto the male demons in the form of a dazzling naked virgin, while the female demons see him as a handsome naked young man (sordid, "demonic" interpretation of the androgynous nature of the celestial messenger). Fired by desire, the male demons, or Archontes, give forth their semen and, with it, the light that they

The great myth 391
had swallowed. Fallen to the ground, their semen gives birth to all the vegetable species. As for the female devils who were already pregnant, at the sight of the handsome young man they give birth to abortions, which, cast onto the ground, eat the buds of trees, thus assimilating the light that they contained. Alarmed by the Third Messenger's tactics, matter, personified in Concupiscence, decides to create a stronger prison around the still-captive particles of light. Two demons, one male, the other female, devour all the abortions in order to absorb the totality of light, and they then couple. Thus Adam and Eve were engendered. As Henri-Charles Puech writes,
so our species is born of a succession of repulsive acts of
cannibalism and sexuality. It keeps the stigmata of this diabolic origin: the body, which is the animal form of the Archontes; libido, desire, which drives man to couple and reproduce himself in his turn, that is, in accordance with the plan of Matter, indefinitely to maintain in its captivity the luminous soul that generation transmits, "transvasates," from body to body. [Le Manicheisme, p. 81]
But since the greatest quantity of light is now collected in Adam, it is he, with his progeny, that becomes the principal object of redemption. The eschatological scenario is repeated: just as the Primordial Man was saved by the Living Spirit, Adam, degraded, unknowing, is awakened by the savior, the "Son of God," identified with Ohrmizd or with "Jesus, the Light." It is the incarnation of the saving intelligence ("the god of Nous," the "Nous") that comes to save in Adam its own soul, astray and chained in Darkness (Puech, p. 82). As in the other Gnostic systems, deliverance involves three stages: awakening, revelation of the saving knowledge, and anamnesis. "Adam examined himself and knew who he was"; "The soul of the blessed one, become intelligent again, revived."48 This soteriological scenario became the model for all redemption through gnosis, present and future. Until the end of the

world, a portion of the light, that is, of the divine soul, will attempt to "awaken" and, in the last analysis, to deliver the other part of it that is still immured in the world, in the bodies of men and animals and in all the vegetable species. It is especially the trees, which contain a large quantity ofthe divine soul, that serve as gallows for the suffering Christ, Jesus Patibilis. As the Manichaean Faustus expressed it, "Jesus, who, as hanging from every tree, is the life and salvation of men."49 The continuation of the world carries on the crucifixion and agony of the historical Jesus. It is true that the particles of light, that is to say, the souls of the blessed dead, are continually conveyed to the heavenly paradise by the "vessels" of the moon and the sun. On the other hand, however, the final redemption is delayed by all those who do not follow the road pointed out by Mani, that is, who do not avoid procreation. For, since light is concentrated in the sperm, each infant that comes into the world only prolongs the captivity of a divine particle. In describing the Third Time, the eschatological finale, Mani sometimes borrows from the apocalyptic imagery familiar throughout western Asia and in the Hellenistic world. The drama opens with a series of terrible ordeals (called by the Manichaeans the "Great War"), which precede the triumph of the Church of Justice and the Last Judgment, when souls will be judged before the tribunal (bema) of Christ. After a short reign, Christ, the Elect, and all the personifications of Good will ascend to heaven. The world, enveloped and purified in a conflagration that will continue for 1,468 years, will be annihilated. The last particles of light will be brought together in a "statue," which will ascend to heaven.5o Matter, with all its personifications, its demons, and its victims, the damned, will be imprisoned in a kind of "globe" (the bolos) and cast into the bottom of a huge pit, sealed by a rock. This time, the separation of the two substances will be definitive, for Obscurity can never again invade the kingdom of Light.

However. according to certain Manichaean schools. not all the particles of light will be saved; in other words. a certain number of souls will remain prisoners of matter for all eternity.

This grandiose mythology clearly contains the essential themes of Iranian spirituality and Hellenistic gnosis. Laboriously, with a plethora of details, Mani "explains" the causes of humanity's deCline, retracing the various episodes of the fall and captivity of the divine soul in matter. Compared, for example, to the succinctness or even the silence of the Indian gnoses (SamkhyaYoga and Buddhism), the Manichaean theology, cosmogony, and anthropogony seem to answer any and every question concerning "origins." It is understandable why the Manichaeans regarded their doctrine as more true, that is, more "scientific," than the other religions: it is because it explained the totality of the real by a chain of causes and their effects. In truth, there is a certain likeness between Manichaeanism and scientific materialism, both ancient and modern: for the one as for the other, the world, life, and man are the result of a chance happening. Even the conflict between the two Principles had broken out because of an accident: the Prince of Darkness happened to be close to the Light because of what Alexander of Lycopolis called the "disorderly motion" of Matter. And, as we have just seen, all the "creations," from the forming of the world to the appearance of man, are only defensive acts on the part of one or the other of the protagonists. Seldom does an acosmic philosophy or gnosis attain the tragic pessimism that informs the Mani system. The world was created from a demonic substance, the bodies of the Archontes (although the cosmogonic act was performed by a divine being). And man is the work of the demonic powers in their most repulsive incarnation. It is improbable that a more tragic and more humiliating anthropogonic myth exists. (Here too we may observe an analogy with contemporary science; for Freud, for example, saw cannibalism and incest as contributing in no small measure to making man such as he is.) Human existence, like universal life, is only the stigma of a divine defeat. Indeed, if the Primordial Man had conquered from the beginning, neither the cosmos nor life nor man would have existed. The cosmogony is a despairing gesture on the part of God to save something of himself, just as the creation of man



394 PAGANISM, CHRISTIANITY, GNOSIS
is a despairing gesture on the part of Matter to keep the particles of light captive. Despite his ignoble origin, man becomes the center of the drama and its stake, for he bears within him a particle of the divine soul. 51 However, a misunderstanding is involved, for God is not interested in man as such but in the soul. which is of divine origin and precedes the appearance of the human species. In short, what is involved is always the effort of God to save himself; in this case, too, we may speak of a "saved Savior." It is, furthermore, the only moment in which the divinity is active, for in general the initiative and the action fall to the Prince of Darkness. This is what makes Manichaean literature so moving, especially the hymns that describe the fall and tribulations of the soul. Certain Manichaean psalms are of great beauty, and the image of Jesus Patibilis ranks among the most touching creations of human piety. Since the body is demonic by nature, Mani prescribes, at least for the "Elect,"52 the strictest asceticism, at the same time forbidding suicide. Once its premises-the two Principles and the primordial aggression of Evil-are accepted, the whole system seems to be solidly constructed. One cannot, one mllst not, religiously valorize what belongs to the adversary ofGod: nature, life, human existence. The "true religion" consists in escaping from the prison built by the demonic forces and in contributing to the definitive annihilation of the world, of life, and of man. The "illumination" obtained through gnosis suffices for salvation because it inspires a particular behavior that separates the believer from the world. Rites are useless, except for a few symbolic gestures (the kiss of peace, the fraternal greeting, the handclasps), together with prayers and songs. The principal festival, the Bema, though it commemorates Mani's passion, glorifies the apostle's "chair" (bema), that is, the teaching of the redeeming gnosis. Indeed, preaching, "teaching," constitutes the true religious activity of the Manichaeans. In the third, but especially in the fourth, century, missions multiply all through Europe and in

North Africa and Asia Minor. The fifth century marks a certain retrogression, and in the sixth century Manichaeanism seems on the point of disappearing in Europe, though it survives in certain centers (for example, in Africa in the eighth century). In addition, in the Sassanid Empire it inspires the movement of Mazdak in the fifth century, and it is probable that the Paulicians in Armenia in the seventh century and Bogomilism in Bulgaria in the tenth century revived certain Manichaean themes (see vol. 3). On the other hand, beginning with the end of the seventh century a new and powerful thrust carries the preaching into Central Asia and China, where Manichaeanism survives into the fourteenth century.53 It must be added that, directly or indirectly, Manichaean cosmological ideas had a certain influence in India and Tibet (see vol. 3, chap. 36). What is more, a certain "Manichaean tendency" is still an integral part of European spirituality. All these successes with its preaching must not make us lose sight of the fact that Manichaeanism was regarded by the Christians as the heresy par excellence and that it was also violently criticized, not only by the Magi, the Jews, and the Muslims, but also by such Gnostics as the Mandaeans and by the philosophers-for example, Plotinus.

30 The Twilight of the Gods
235. Heresies and orthodoxy
The first systematic theology is the consequence of the dangerous crises that shook the Church during the second century. It was in the course of criticizing the •• heresies" of the Gnostic sectsfirst of all, anticosmic dualism and rejection of the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ-that the Fathers gradually elaborated orthodox doctrine. Essentially, orthodoxy consisted in fidelity to the theology of the Old Testament. The Gnostics were regarded as the worst of heretics precisely because they repudiated, either wholly or in part, the principles of Hebrew thought. And in fact there was complete incompatibility between the ideas of Gnosticism-preexistence of the soul in the bosom of the original One, the accidental nature of the Creation, the soul's fall into matter, etc.-and the theology, cosmogony, and anthropology of the Bible. It was impossible to call oneself a Christian and not accept the doctrines of the Old Testament concerning the origin of the world and the nature of man: God had begun his cosmogonic work by creating matter, and he completed it by creating man, corporeal, sexual, and free, in the image and likeness of his Creator. In other words, man was created with the powerful potencies of a god. "History" is the temporal span during which man learns to practice his freedom and to sanctify himself-in short, to serve the apprenticeship of his calling as god. I For the end of Creation is a sanctified hu

Heresies and orthodoxy 397
manity. This explains the importance of temporality and history and the decisive role of human freedom; for a man cannot be made a god despite himself. These conceptions were taken over by Christianity. Saint Paul glorifies the new birth assured by Christ: "For anyone who is in Christ there is a new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17). Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters; "what matters is ... to become an altogether new creature" (Gal. 6: 15), "one single new man in himself" (Eph. 2: 15). As Claude Tresmontant writes,
from this point of view, it is not a matter of returning to our previous, primitive condition, as in the Gnostic myth, but, on the contrary, of aiming, without a backward glance, at that which is ahead, at the creation that is coming and becoming. Christianity is not a doctrine of return, like Gnosticism or NeoPlatonism, but a doctrine of creation. 2
Paradoxically, despite the delay of the parousia and the increase in persecutions, Christianity appears as an optimistic religion. The theology elaborated against the Gnostics glorifies the Creation, blesses life, accepts history-even when history becomes nothing but terror. Just like Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, who, in his school at Jabneh, insured the continuity of Judaism, the Church looked at the future with hope and confidence. To be sure, as we shall soon see, certain attitudes expressive of a refusal of life (asceticism, monasticism, praise of virginity, etc.) are accepted, and sometimes glorified, in the various churches. However, in a period dominated by despair and characterized by philosophies almost as anticosmic and pessimistic3 as those of the Gnostics, the theology and practice of the Church are distinguished by their balance. For the Fathers, orthodoxy was bound up with the apostolic succession: the Apostles had received the teaching directly from
2. La metaphysique du christianisme, p. 71. It is significant that, in general, the Fathers followed the principles of normative Judaism and ignored Jewish speculations of the Gnostic type. 3. It is important to bear in mind a paradox that is often ignored by historians: the most important Gnostic teachers, as well as Marcion and certain classic authors (Epictetus, Plutarch), elaborated their tragic and extremely pessimistic philosophies in a period of peace and prosperity, the "Golden Age" of the Antonines; see E. R. Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety, p. 4.



398 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
Christ and had transmitted it to the bishops and their successors.4 As for the cause of heresies, Irenaeus and Hippolytus found it in the corruption of the Scriptures by Greek philosophy. This thesis was criticized by Walter Bauers in 1934. This German scholar observes first of all that the opposition orthodoxy/ heresy became explicit rather late, at the beginning of the second century. Primitive Christianity was comparatively complex, taking many and various expressions into account. In fact, the earliest Christian forms were closer to those that were later considered heretical. Bauer comes to the conclusion that three great Christian centers-Edessa, Alexandria, and Asia Minorwere heretical during the first two centuries; orthodoxy was not introduced until later. From the beginning, the only orthodox center was Rome. Hence the victory of orthodoxy in antiquity is equivalent to the victory of Roman Christianity. "Thus, in a primitive Christianity, with many and shifting forms, with many and often opposing currents, Rome succeeded in fixing a particular form that takes the name of orthodoxy because it succeeded in imposing itself and over against which the other tendencies were then termed heretical."6 However, as Andre Benoit observes, Bauer's explanation remains purely historical; it does not take into consideration the doctrinal content belonging to orthodoxy and to heresy. We are indebted to H. E. Turner for having undertaken a theological analysis of these two opposing positions.7 According to Turner, as Benoit remarks, heresy
4. The heretics also claimed descent from one or another of the Apostles (e.g., Basilides claimed to be descended from the interpreter of Peter and hence from Peter himself), but the Fathers rejected these would-be successions on the ground that they were secret and unverifiable. As Irenaeus wrote (Adv. haer. 3. 4. 3), "prior to Valentinus, those who follow Valentinus had no existence; nor did those from Marcion exist before Marcion" (trans. from The Ante-Nicene Fathers). .5.

is distinguished from orthodoxy, on the one hand, by rejecting doctrines explicitly defined by the Church and, on the other hand, by corrupting the specific content of the Christian faith; in short, it represents a deviation from the traditional faith. [Benoit, p. 303]
Orthodoxy appears as a consistent and well-coordinated system ofthought, whereas heresy, by increasingly departing from the primitive doctrinal bases and introducing factors of dilution, mutilation, distortion, and archaism, appears as a congeries of fragmentary and incomplete systems that are finally inconsistent. [Ibid., p. 306]
From the point of view of the history of Christian thought,
the victory of orthodoxy is the victory of consistency over inconsistency, of a certain logic over fantasizing elucubrations, of a theology scientifically elaborated as opposed to unorganized doctrines.... Orthodoxy appears as bound up with a juridical institution, with a society that has its history and its policy. But it also appears as bound up with a system of
thought, a doctrine. It is at once a juridical institution and a theology. [Ibid., p. 307]
In short, orthodoxy is defined by (1) fidelity to the Old Testament and to an apostolic tradition attested by documents; (2) resistance to the excesses of the mythologizing imagination; (3) a high regard for systematic thought (hence for Greek philosophy); (4) importance accorded to social and political institutions-in short, to juridical thought, a category specifically characteristic of the Roman genius. Each of these elements gave rise to significant theological creations and contributed, to a greater or lesser extent, to the triumph of the Church. Yet, at a certain moment in the history of Christianity, each of these elements precipitated crises, often extremely serious, arid contributed to the improvement of the primitive tradition.
236. The Cross and the Tree of Life
Because of the anti-Gnostic polemic, the esoteric teaching and the tradition of Christian gnosis were almost stifled in the Church.



400 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
(Later, the ecclesiastical hierarchy will show a similar suspicion in regard to mystical experiences; see vol. 3.) This is perhaps the highest price that Christianity had to pay to safeguard the unity of the Church. Henceforth Christian gnosis and esoteric teaching will survive, in diminished and camouflaged form, on the margin of the official institutions. Certain esoteric traditions (predominantly those preserved in apocalypses and apocryphas) will enjoy great currency in popular circles, but in connection with myths and legends derived from heretical Gnostic systems, especially Manichaeanism (see pp. 405-6). For the purpose of this chapter, it would be useless to dwell on certain difficulties of the primitive Church, for example, the controversies concerning the paschal question (toward the end of the second century) or questions of discipline (e.g., forgiveness of believers guilty of mortal sins after their baptism, etc.). More serious and of greater significance for the general history of religions are the controversies and crises brought on by dogmatic formulations of Christology, a problem that will engage our attention further on. For the moment, it may be said that it is possible to distinguish two parallel and complementary tendencies at work in the process of integrating the pre-Christian religious heritage, in the repeated and varied efforts to give a universal dimension to the message of Christ. The first (and earlier) tendency appears in the assimilation and revalorization of symbolisms and mythological scenarios of biblical origin, whether Oriental or pagan. The second'tendency, chiefly illustrated by theological speculations from the third century on, attempts to universalize Christianity by the help of Greek philosophy, especially Neo~Platonic metaphysics. Saint Paul had already invested the sacrament of baptism with a symbolism that is archaic in structure: ritual death and resurrection, new birth in Christ. The earliest theologians elaborated the scenario: baptism is a descent into the abyss of the Waters for a duel with the marine monster; the model is Christ's going down into the Jordan. According to Justin, Christ, the new Noah, risen victorious from the Waters, has become the head of a new race. Baptismal nudity, too, has a meaning that is at once ritual and metaphysical: it is abandoning the old garment



The Cross and the Tree of Life 401
of corruption and sin with which Adam was clothed after the Fall. Now all these themes are found elsewhere: the "Waters of Death" are a leitmotiv of paleo-Oriental, Asiatic, and Oceanic mythologies. Ritual nudity is equivalent to integrity and plenitude: "Paradise" implies the absence of "clothing," that is, the absence of "wear and tear" (archetypal image of Time). Encountering the monsters of the abyss is an initiatory ordeal of heroes. To be sure, for the Christian, baptism is a sacrament because it was instituted by Christ. But, despite that, it repeats the initiatory ritual of the ordeal (= battle with the monster), of symbolic death and resurrection (= birth of the new man).8 Still according to Saint Paul, by baptism one obtains the reconciliation of contraries: "there are no more distinctions between ... slave and freeman, male and female" (Gal. 3:28). In other words, the baptized person recovers the primordial condition of the androgyne. The idea is clearly expressed in the Gospel of Thomas: "And when you shall make one thing of male and female, so that the male is not male and woman is not woman ... then you shall enter the Kingdom."9 There is no need to insist on the archaism and the universal dissemination of the symbol of the androgyne as the exemplary expression of human perfection. It is probably because of the marked importance accorded to androgyny by the Gnostics that this symbolism was less and less used after Saint Paul. But it never entirely disappeared from the history of Christianity. 10 Even more daring is the assimilation, by Christian imagery, liturgy, and theology, of the symbolism ofthe World Tree. In this case too we have to do with an archaic and universally disseminated symbol. The Cross, made from the wood of the Tree of

Good and Evil, is identified with, or replaces, the Cosmic Tree; it is described as a tree that "rises from earth to heaven," an immortal plant "that stands at the center of heaven and earth, firm support of the universe," "the Tree of Life planted on Calvary." Numerous patristic and liturgical texts compare the Cross to a ladder, a pillar, or a mountain, characteristic expressions for the "center of the world." This shows that the image of the Center imposed itself naturally on the Christian imagination. To be sure, the image of the Cross as Tree of Good and Evil and Cosmic Tree has its origin in biblical traditions. But it is by the Cross (= the Center) that communication with heaven is conducted and that, at the same time, the entire universe is "saved." Now the notion of salvation merely takes up and completes the notions of perpetual renewal and cosmic regeneration, of universalfecundity and sacrality, of absolute reality, and, in the last analysis, of immortality-all notions that coexist in the symbolism of the World Tree." More and more archaic themes became integrated into the scenario of the Crucifixion. Since Jesus Christ was crucified at the Center of the World, where Adam had been created and buried, Christs' blood, flowing onto "Adam's head," baptized him and atoned for his sins.12 And since the Savior's blood had atoned for the original-sin, the Cross (= Tree of Life) becomes the source of the sacraments (symbolized by olive oil, wheat, the grape) and of medicinal herbs. 13 These mythological themes, elaborated by Christian authors, especially from the third century onward, have a long and complex prehistory: from the blood and the body of a sacrificed god or primordial being, wondrous plants grow. But it is important to emphasize at this point that these archaic scenarios and images, rehandled by Christian authors, enjoyed an unparalleled success in the religious folklore of Europe. Countless popular legends and songs tell of flowers and medicinal herbs that grow under the Cross or on Jesus'

And my flesh fell. Where it fell Good wheat came.

237. Toward "cosmic Christianity"
It is in one of the last chapters of the third volume that we shall study the significance of Christian folklore and its interest for the general history of religions. But it is necessary to point out now the role of what we have called the "universalization" of the Christian message through the instrumentality of mythological imagery and through a continual process of assimilation of the pre-Christian religious heritage. It should first be borne in mind that the majority of the symbols invoked (baptism, the Tree of Life, the Cross assimilated to the Tree of Life, the origin of the sacramental substances-olive oil, chrism, wine, wheat-from the Savior's blood) continue and develop certain symbols documented in normative Judaism or in the intertestamentary apocryphas. Sometimes (e.g., the Cosmic Tree, the Tree of Life) they are archaic symbols, already present in the Neolithic period and clearly valorized in the Near East from Sumerian culture on. In other cases we have to do with religious practices of pagan origin, borrowed by the Jews during the Greco-Roman period (e.g., the ritual use of wine, the symbol of the Tree of Life in

Jewish art, etc.).15 Finally, a large number of the mythological images, figures, and themes that are employed by Christian authors, and that will become the favorite subjects of European popular books and religious folklore, derive from the Jewish apocrypha. In short, the Christian mythological imagination borrows and develops motifs and scenarios that belong to cosmic religiosity but that have already undergone a reinterpretation in the biblical context. In adding their own valorization, Christian theology and mythological imagination have only continued a process that had begun with the conquest of Canaan (see § 60). In the language of theology, it could be said that, integrated into a Christian scenario, a number of archaic traditions gain their "redemption." What in fact we have here is a phenomenon of homologation of different and multiform religious universes. A similar process is found (as early as the end of antiquity, but especially in the High Middle Ages) in the transformation of certain gods or mythological heroes into Christian saints. We shall analyze the significance of the cult of saints and their relics further on (vol. 3, chap. 32). But one of the consequences of this cult must be borne in mind even now: the "Christianization" of pagan religious traditions-hence their survival in the framework of Christian experience and imagination-contributes to the cultural unification of the ecumene. To give only one example, the countless dragon-slaying heroes and gods, from Greece to Ireland and from Portugal to the Urals, all become the same. saint: Saint George. It is the specific vocation of all religious universalism to go beyond provincialism}6 Now as early as the third century, and everywhere in the Roman Empire, we see various tendencies toward autarchy and autonomy that threaten the unity of the Roman world. 17 After the collapse of urban civilization,

and vol. 12, pp. 126 if. (the Tree of Life). But the number of pagan symbols assimilated by Judaism is far longer: bull, lion, Victory, eagle, shell, bird, boat, etc.; see Goodenough's summary of vols. 7-11 in vol. 12, pp. 132-83. 16. Similar processes are found in India (Hinduization of aboriginal divine figures and cults), in China (especially in popular Taoism), in Judaism (in the period of the conquest of Canaan and in the Middle Ages), and in Islam. 17.

Toward "cosmic Christianity" 405
the process of homologation and unification of the pre-Christian religious traditions is destined to playa considerable part. The phenomenon is important because it is characteristic of religious creativity of the folklore type, which has not engaged the attention of historians of religions. It is a creativity parallel to that of the theologians, the mystics, and the artists. We may speak of a "cosmic Christianity" since, on the one hand, the Christological mystery is projected upon the whole of nature and, on the other hand, the historical elements of Christianity are neglected; on the contrary, there is emphasis on the liturgical dimension of existence in the world. The conception of a cosmos redeemed by the death and resurrection of the Savior and sanctified' by the footsteps of God, of Jesus, of the Virgin, and of the Saints permitted the recovery, if only sporadically and symbolically, of a world teeming with the virtues and beauties that wars and their terrors had stripped from the world of history. 18 It must be added, however, that Christian folklore is also inspired by more or less heretical sources and that it sometimes ignores myths, dogmas, and scenarios that are of prime importance for theology. For example, it is significant that the biblical cosmogony vanished from European folklore. The only "popular" cosmogony known in southeastern Europe is dualistic in structure: it involves both God and the Devil. 19 In the European traditions in which this cosmogony is not documented, there is no cosmogonic myth.20 We shall return in volume 3 of this work to the problem of the survival, in European folklore, of figures and scenarios familiar to the Jewish, Christian, and heretical apocalypses and apocryphas. The persistence of this class of archaic traditions until the twentieth century emphasizes their importance in the religious universe of the rural populations. It is highly significant, for example, that a mythological motif that is abundantly invoked in Mandaeanism and Manichaeanism but whose origin is prob

ably Sumerian still plays an essential part in the mythology of death and the funeral rituals of the Romanians and other peoples of eastern Europe. Mandaean and Manichaean writings speak of "customs houses" at each of the seven heavens and of the "customs officers" who examine the soul's "merchandise" (i.e., its religious works and merits) in the course of its heavenly journey.21 Now in the religious folklore and funerary customs of the Romanians there is mention of a "road of death" through the seven "customs houses of the atmosphere" (viimile viizduhului) .
We will list some Iranian symbols and scenarios that were assimilated by both Christian theology and Christian mythology. The Iranian idea of the resurrection of bodies was received with the Judaic inheritance. "The comparison of the body of resurrection to a heavenly garment is indubitably reminiscent of investitures that abound in Mazdaean theology. And the fact that the bodies of the just will shine is best explained by the Persian religion of light."22 The imagery of the Nativity-the star or the pillar of light that shines above the cave-was borrowed from the Iranian (Parthian) scenario of the birth of the cosmocratorredeemer. The Protogospel of James (18: I ff.) tells of a blinding light that filled the cave in Bethlehem; when it began to depart, the Infant Jesus appeared. This is as much as to say that the light was consubstantial with Jesus or was one of his epiphanies. But it is the anonymous author of the Opus imperJectum in Matthaeum who introduces new elements into the legend. According to him, the twelve magi-kings lived near the "Mount of Victories." They knew the secret revelation of Seth concerning the coming of the Messiah, and, every year, they climbed a mountain where there was a cave with springs and trees. There they prayed to God for three days, awaiting the appearance of the Star. It finally appeared in the form of a little child, and the child told them to go to Judaea. Guided by the Star, the magikings traveled for two years. Returned home, they told of the

prodigy they had witnessed, and, when the Apostle Thomas arrived in their country, they asked to be baptized.23 With some very suggestive developments, this legend is found again in a Syrian work, the Chronicle ofZuqnfn. There we learn that twelve "wisemen-kings" come from the land of "Shyr" (a corruption of Shyz, Zarathustra's birthplace). The "Mount of Victories" corresponds to the Iranian cosmic mountain, Hara Barzaiti, that is, to the axis mundi that connects heaven with earth. Hence it is at the "center of the world" that Seth hides the book containing the prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah, and it is there that the Star announces the birth of the cosmocrator-redeemer. Now according to Iranian tradition, the xvarenah that shines above the sacred mountain is the sign announcing the Saoshyant, the redeemer miraculously born from the semen of Zarathustra.24
238. The ftowering of theology
As we have already said, Christian theology, articulated during the Gnostic crisis of the second century, is essentially characterized by its fidelity to the Old Testament. Irenaeus, one of the earliest and most important Christian theologians, interprets the Redemption-that is, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ-as the continuation and completion of the work begun with the creation of Adam but obstructed by the Fall. Christ recapitulates the existential trajectory of Adam in order to deliver humanity from the consequences of sin. However, while Adam is the prototype of fallen humanity, doomed to death, Christ is the creator and exemplary model of a new humanity, blessed by the promise of immortality. Irenaeus seeks-and finds-antithetical parallels between Adam and Christ: the first was created from virgin soil, Christ is born of a virgin; Adam disobeys by eating the fruit of the forbidden tree, Christ obeys by allowing himself to be sacrificed on the tree of the Cross, etc.

24. See The Two and the One, pp. 52-54.



408 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
The doctrine of recapitulation can be interpreted as a twofold effort to assimilate, on the one hand, the biblical revelation in its totality and, on the other hand, to justify the Incarnation as the completion of the same revelation. The first structures of the sacred calendar, i.e., of liturgical time, continue Jewish institutions; but there is always the christological novum. Justin calls Sunday "the first day," connecting it at once with the Resurrection and with the creation of the world. This effort to emphasize the universality of the Christian message by associating it with the sacred history of Israel-the one truly universal history-is made in parallel with the effort to assimilate Greek philosophy. The theology of the Logos-more precisely, the mystery of its Incarnation-gives speculation admittance to perspectives that were inaccessible within the horizon of the Old Testament. But this daring innovation was not without its dangers. Docetism, one of the earliest heresies, which was Gnostic in origin and structure, dramatically illustrates the resistance against the idea of the Incarnation. For the Docetists (the name comes from the Greek verb dokeo, "to seem," "to appear"), the Redeemer could not accept the humiliation of becoming incarnate and suffering on the Cross; according to them, Christ seemed to be a man because he had put on an appearance of the human form. In other words, the passion and death were suffered by someone else (the man Jesus or Simon of Cyrene). Yet the Fathers were right in fiercely defending the dogma of the Incarnation. From the point of view of the history of religions, the Incarnation represents the last and most perfect hierophany: God completely incarnated himself in a human being both concrete and historical (that is, active in a well-defined and irreversible historical temporality) without thereby confining himself to his body (since the Son is consubstantial with the Father). It could even be said that the kenosis of Jesus Christ not only constitutes the crowning of all the hierophanies accomplished from the beginning of time but also justifies them, that is, proves their validity. To accept the possibility of the Absolute becoming incarnate in a historical person is at the same time to recognize the validity of the universal dialectic of the sacred; in other words, it is to recognize that the countless pre-Christian generations were not victims of an illusion when they proclaimed



The flowering of theology 409
the presence of the sacred, i.e., of the divine, in the objects and rhythms of the cosmos. The problems raised by the dogma of the Incarnation of the Logos recur, in aggravated form, in the theology of the Trinity. To be sure, the theological speculations had their source in the Christian experience. From the beginnings of the Church, Christians knew God in three figures: (1) the Father-creator and judge-who had revealed himself in the Old Testament; (2) the Lord Jesus Christ, the Risen One; and (3) the Holy Spirit, who had the power to renew life and bring about the Kingdom. But at the beginning of the fourth century, Arius, an Alexandrian priest, proposed a more consistent and more philosophical interpretation of the Trinity. Arius does not reject the Trinity, but he denies the consubstantiality ofthe three divine persons. For him, God is alone and uncreated; the Son and the Holy Spirit were created later by the Father, and so are inferior to him. Arius revived, on the one hand, the doctrine of the Christ-Angel, i.e., Christ identified with the archangel Saint Michael (a doctrine documented at Rome at the beginning of the second century), and, on the other hand, certain of Origen's theses that presented the Son as a secondary divinity. Arius' interpretation had some success, even among the bishops, but at the Council of Nicaea in 325 the creed rejecting Arianism was adopted. However, Arius' theology still had comparatively powerful defenders, and the controversy continued for more than half a century.25 It was Athanasius (died 373) who elaborated the doctrine of the consubstantiality (to homoousion) of the Father and the Son, a doctrine summarized by Saint Augustine: una substantia-tres personae. All this was no mere controversy among theologians; the dogma of the Trinity was of the utmost concern to the people in general. For if Jesus Christ was only a secondary divinity, how was it possible to believe that he had power to save the world? The theology of the Trinity never ceased to raise problems; from the Renaissance on, rationalistic philosophers declared themselves first of all by their antitrinitarianism (see vol. 3). However, the theology of the Trinity must be credited with hav

410 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
ing encouraged daring speculations, by forcing Christians to escape from the bounds of daily experience and ordinary logic. 26 The increasing sanctification and, in the last analysis, the deification of Mary are chiefly the work of popular piety. Toward the end of the first century, the date of the Gospel of John, the Church had already recognized the religious significance of Mary. On the Cross, Jesus said to his mother: " 'Woman, this is your son ... .' Then to the disciple he said, 'This is your mother' " (John 19:25 IT.). The importance of Mary derives from her motherhood: she is Deipara, "she who gives birth to the God." The term is first documented at the beginning of the third century; but when the Monophysites27 used it in a heretical sense, Deipara was replaced by a clearer term, Theotokos, "Mother of God." But it was always a virgin mother, and the dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary was proclaimed at the Council of Ephesus. 28 In this case, too, we can see the process of assimilating and revalorizing an archaic religious idea that is universally disseminated. In fact the theology of Mary, the Virgin Mother, takes over and perfects the immemorial Asiatic and Mediterranean conceptions of parthenogenesis, the faculty of self-fecundation, which was claimed by the Great Goddesses (for example, Hera; see § 93). Marian theology represents the transfiguration of the earliest and most significant homage paid, from the time of prehistory, to the religious mystery of womanhood. In Western Christianity the Virgin Mary will be identified with the figure of divine Wisdom. The Eastern Church, on the contrary, will develop, side by side with the theology of the Theotokos, the doctrine of celestial Wisdom, Sophia, into which the feminine figure of the Holy Spirit flowers. Many centuries later, sophianology will play for the intellectual elites of Eastern Christianity a part similar to Neo-Thomism in the renewal of Christian philosophy in the West.

Between Sol Invictus and Constantine 411
239. Between Sol Invictus and "In hoe signo vinees"
As we saw (p. 367), the Emperor Aurelian (270-75) had rightly grasped the importance of a solar theology, monotheistic in structure, for insuring the unity of the Empire. Thus he reintroduced the god of Emesa into Rome, but in doing so he took care to make radical changes in the god's structure and cult. The Syrian elements were deliberately eliminated, and service of the god was confined to Roman senators. The anniversary of the Deus Sol Invictus was set at December 25th, the "birthday" of all Oriental solar divinities. The universalistic nature of the solar cult and theology was recognized, or foreseen, by the Greek and Roman disciples of Apollo-Helios, as well as by the worshipers of Mithra and the Syrian Baals. What is more, the philosophers and theosophers were, many ofthem, believers in a monotheism solar in structure. Indeed, the tendencies toward monotheism and universalism that are characteristic of the end of the third century become dominant in the fourth. Numerous religious syncretisms-the Mysteries, the rise of the Christian theology of the Logos, the solar symbolism applied at once to the emperor and to the imperiumillustrate the fascination exercised by the notion of the One and by the mythology of Unity. Before his conversion, Constantine (306-37) was a disciple of the solar cult and saw in Sol Invictus the foundation of his Empire. The sun is plentifully represented on figured monuments, on coins, and in inscriptions. But unlike Aurelian, for whom Sol Invictus was the Supreme God, Constantine considered the sun the most perfect symbol of God. The subordination of the Sun to the Supreme God was in all probability the first consequence of his conversion to Christianity; but the idea had already been expressed by the Neo-Platonist Porphyry.29 The various testimonies do not agree as to the sign that Constantine saw before the decisive battle-at the Milvian Bridge, in which his adversary, Maxentius, was killed. According to Lactantius, Constantine "was directed in a dream to cause the heavenly sign to be delineated on the shields of his soldiers, and so
29. See F. Altheim, Der unbesiegte Gott, chap. 5.



412 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
to proceed to battle. He did as he had been commanded, and he marked on their shields ... the cipher of Christ" (De mortibus persecutorum 44). But in his Vita Constantini (1. 28-29) Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, tells a different story. According to him, Constantine said that
about mid-day, when the sun was beginning to decline, he saw with his own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, and bearing the inscription Conquer by this. At this sight he himself was struck with amazement, and his whole army also . . . . He doubted within himself what the import of this apparition could be; ... and in his sleep the Christ of God appeared to him with the same sign which he had seen in the heavens, and commanded him to procure a standard made in the likeness of that sign, and to use it as a safeguard in all engagements with his enemies.
The genuineness of these accounts is still in dispute, and there is dispute, too, whether the sign that Constantine saw was Christian or pagan.30 However this may be, Constantine's conversion insured the official Christianization of the Empire. The first Christian symbols begin to appear on coins as early as 315, and the last pagan images disappear in 323. The Church receives a privileged judicial status, that is, the state recognizes the validity of the decisions of the episcopal court, even in civil affairs. Christians attain the highest offices, and restrictive measures against pagans increase in number. Under Theodosius the Great (379-95) Christianity becomes the state religion, and paganism is definitely forbidden; the persecuted become the persecutors. Indeed, Christianity had proved its strength and vitality before the conversion of Constantine. About 300, at Antioch and Alexandria, the Christian community was the largest and bestorganized religious group. Indeed, the antagonism between Church and Empire gradually lost its intransigence. The last apologists, Lactantius (240-ca. 320) and Eusebius of Caesarea (263-ca. 339), proclaimed that Christianity was the only hope of saving the Empire.

Between Sol Invictus and Constantine 413
The causes of the final triumph of Christian preaching are many and various. First of all were the unshakable faith and moral strength of Christians, their courage in the face of torture and death-a courage admired even by their greatest enemies, Lucian of Samosata, Marcus Aurelius, Galienus, Celsus. Furthermore, the solidarity of the Christians was unequaled; the community took care of widows, orphans, and the aged and ransomed those captured by pirates. During epidemics and sieges, only Christians tended the wounded and buried the dead. For all the rootless multitudes of the Empire, for the many who suffered from loneliness, for the victims of cultural and social alienation, the Church was the only hope of obtaining an identity, of finding, or recovering, a meaning for life. Since there were no barriers, either social, racial, or intellectual, anyone could become a member of this optimistic and paradoxical society in which a powerful citizen, the emperor's chamberlain, bowed before a bishop who had been his slave. In all probability, neither before nor afterward has any historical society experienced the equivalent of this equality, of the charity and brotherly love that were the life of the Christian communities of the first four centuries. The most unexpected innovation, and one that had marked consequences for the religious, cultural, and social history of Europe, was monasticism, characterized by separation from the world and an extremely severe asceticism.31 This phenomenon appeared in the third century, and not only in Egypt, as was believed until recently, but also, independently, in Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia.32 Saint Anthony founded Egyptian monasticism, but it was Pacomius (ca. 290-347) who, in 320, organized monastic life in the desert of the Thebald (where, toward the end of the fourth century, there were some 7,000 monks). As Peter Brown observes, the monks had voluntarily

32. It is true that Egyptian monasticism developed rapidly and, by virtue of its literature, which made it famous, exercised considerable influence.



414 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
chosen the "anti-culture"-the desert and the cavesY Their considerable prestige is the consequence, on the one hand, of their victory over the demons and, on the other hand, of their mastery of wild beasts. A new idea appears: these monks, true "saints," are strong enough to command devils and to affect God's will by their prayers. And in fact only the monks had the courage to resist some of the emperor's decisions. Perched on his pillar, Saint Simeon Stylites examined lawsuits, prophesied, performed cures, and reprimanded and advised high officials. Toward the end of the fourth century a wave of violence committed by monks swept from Mesopotamia to North Africa: in 388 they burned a synagogue at Callinicum, near the Euphrates, and terrorized Syrian villages in which there were pagan temples; in 391 the Patriarch of Alexandria, Theophilus, summoned them to "purify" the city by destroying the Serapeum, the great temple of Serapis. During the same period they forced their way into the houses of pagans to look for idols. And in 415 a group of fanatical monks committed one ofthe most odious crimes known to history: they lynched Hypatia, the noble Alexandrian philosopher, whom her pupil, Bishop Synesius; termed' 'mother, sister, teacher, and benefactress" (Ep. 16). In the East the bishops protected the monks in order to reinforce their own position; together, bishops and monks put themselves at the head of the people and dictated popular opinion. As Peter Brown observes, "these eccentrics transform Christianity into a religion of the masses."34 This makes the accomplishment of their successors, the monks of the High Middle Ages, especially in the West, appear all the more surprising (see vol. 3).
240. The bus that stops at Eleusis
No historical event more effectively expresses the "official" end of paganism than the burning of the sanctuary of Eleusis in 396 by Alaric, king of the Goths. On the other hand, however, no

The bus that stops at Eleusis 415
other example better illustrates the mysterious process of occultation and continuity undergone by pagan religiosity. In the fifth century the historian Eunapius, himself an initiate into the Eleusinian Mysteries, relates the prophecy of the last legitimate hierophant. In Eunapius' presence, the hierophant predicts that his successor will be illegitimate and sacrilegious; he will not even be an Athenian citizen; still worse, he will be someone who, "consecrated to other gods," will be bound by his oath "to preside only at their ceremonies." Because of this profanation, the sanctuary will be destroyed, and the cult of the Two Goddesses will disappear forever. And in fact, Eunapius goes on, a highly placed initiate into the Mysteries of Mithra (where he had the rank of pater) became hierophant. He was the last hierophant of Eleusis, for, soon afterward, Alaric's Goths made their way through the pass of Thermopylae, followed by "men in black," Christian monksand the oldest and most important religious center in Europe was finally ruined. 35 However, if the initiation ritual disappeared from Eleusis, Demeter did not abandon the site of her most dramatic theophany. It is true that, in the rest of Greece, Saint Demetrius had taken her place, thus becoming the patron of agriculture. But Eleusis knew, and still knows, a Saint Demetra, a saint who is unknown elsewhere and who has never been canonized. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century a statue of the goddess was ritually covered with flowers by the peasants of the village, for she insured the fertility of their fields. Then, in 1820, despite the armed resistance of the inhabitants, the statue was taken away by E. D. Clarke, who presented it to Cambridge University.36 Again at Eleusis, in 1860 a priest told the French archeologist F. Lenormant the story of Saint Demetra: she was an old woman from Athens; a "Turk" carried away her daughter, but a brave pallikar succeeded in setting her free. And in 1928,

416 THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
Mylonas heard the same story from an Eleusinian woman ninety years oldY The most touching episode of the Christian mythology of Demeter took place at the beginning of February 1940, and it was
recounted and commented on at length in the Athenian press.38 At one of the bus stops between Athens and Corinth there came on board an old woman, "thin and dried up but with very big and keen eyes." Since she had no money to pay her fare, the driver made her leave the bus at the next stop-which was, precisely, Eleusis. But the driver could not get the motor started again; finally the passengers decided to chip in and pay the old woman's fare. She got back on board, and this time the bus set off. Then the old woman said to them: "You ought to have done it sooner, but you are egotists; and, since 1 am among you, 1 will tell you something else: you will be punished for the way you live, you will be deprived even of plants and water!" "She had not finished threatening them," the author of the article published in Hestia goes on, "before she vanished.... No one had seen her get out. Then the passengers looked at one another, and they examined the ticket stubs again to make sure that a ticket had indeed been issued." To conclude, we will quote Charles Picard's well-taken observation: "I believe that even Hellenists in general will find it hard, in face ofthis story, not to summon up certain recollections of the famous Homeric Hymn, in which Kore's mother, disguised as an old woman in the house of the Eleusinian king Celeus, also prophesied and-in a fit of anger, reproaching men with their impiety-announced terrible catastrophes for the whole region."39

Chapter 16. The Re6gions of Ancient China
126. Especially deserving of mention among the numerous studies of the prehistoric cultures ofChina are: William Watson, Early Civilization
in China (London, 1966), an excellent introduction; Li Chi, The Beginnings of Chinese Civilization (Seattle and London, 1957; 2d ed., 1968); Cheng Te-k'un, Archaeology in China, vol. 1, Prehistoric China (Cambridge, 1959); William Watson, Cultural Frontiers in Ancient East Asia (Edinburgh, 1971), especially the first chapter, "Neolithic Frontiers in East Asia" (pp. 9-37); Carl Hentze, Funde in Alt-China: Das Welterleben im iiltesten China (Gottingen, 1967), which summarizes the author's views presented in several earlier works; Ping-ti Ho, The Cradle of the East: An Inquiry into the Indigenous Origins of Techniques and Ideas ofNeolithic and Early Historic China, 5000-1000 B.C. (Hong Kong and Chicago, 1975). On the discovery of the Chinese Neolithic (the Yang Shao culture), see J. G. Anderson, Children of the Yellow Earth (London, 1934). In his recent work, Ho maintains the autochthonous origin of Chinese agriculture, metallurgy, and writing; see his Cradle of the East, esp.
pp. 341 ff. For his part, Li Chi, in accord with other archeologists, brings out certain Western (i.e., Mesopotamian) influences in the ico
nography of Anyang (Beginnings ofChinese Civilization, pp. 26 ff.). In any case it is certain that Chinese culture, like all other cultures, was progressively enriched by ideas and techniques that were Western, Nordic, or Meridional in origin. On the other hand, as has often been stated, China is "a window toward the Pacific," and the influence of the Chinese cosmological symbolism and its artistic expressions can be discerned in the religious art of certain peoples of Borneo, Sumatra, and New Zealand, as well as among the tribes of the northwest coast of America. See, inter alia, two studies of art in the Pacific area: Mino

Chapter 16. The Religions ofAncient China 421
On scapulamancy, see Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, trans. Willard R. Trask, Bollingen Series 76 (Princeton, 1972), p. 164, n. 97 (bibliography). On the symbolism of the t'ao-t'ieh mask, see the works by Carl Hentze, especially Bronzegeriit . .. der Shang-Zeit, pp. 215 ff., Funde in Alt-China, pp. 171 ff., 195 ff., and "Antithetische T'ao-t'ieh-motive," IPEK 23 (1970173): 1-20. No less significant is the symbolism of the cicada. Since its larva comes out of the ground (hence, it is a symbol of obscurity), the cicada is an emblem of resurrection; this is why it is put in the mouth of the corpse; see Carl Hentze, Friihchinesischen Bronzen und Kultdarstellungen (Antwerp, 1937), pp. 37 ff. Stylized delineations of cicadas are engraved on the tongue of the t'ao-t'ieh mask, the demon of darkness that created light and life (ibid., pp. 66 ff.).
128. On Chou culture, see Ch'eng Te-k'un, Archaeology in China, vol. 3, Chou China (Cambridge, 1963); Kwang-Chih Chang, The Archaeology of Ancient China, pp. 256 ff., 263 ff.
On religion in the Chou period, see Ping-ti Ho, Cradle, pp. 322 ff.; Hentze, Funde in Alt-China, pp. 218 ff., and the works cited in the following two paragraphs. The "classic books" present a dozen names of the Supreme God, among which the most famous are Shang Ti (' 'The Lord on High' ') and Huang Ti ("August Lord"). But at the basis of all these divine names are the appellatives Ti (Lord) and T'ien (Heaven). The celestial structure of the supreme god is evident: Shang Ti is all-seeing (Shih Ching 3. 1. 7. 1), he hears everything (5. 16. 3. 14); T'ien keeps watch over men (Shu Ching 4. 9. 1. 3), he sees and hears (3. 3. 5. 7), he is clairvoyant (Shih Ching 3. 3. 2. 11-12), his decree is infallible (Shu Ching 4. 3. 2. 5), he understands and observes everything (4. 8. 2. 3), etc. For translations of the Shu Ching, see vol. 3 of James Legge's The Chinese Classics, 5 vols. (London, 1861-72), and Bernhard Karlgren Shu Ching: The Book of Documents (Stockholm, 1950).
On the cult of the supreme celestial god, see B. Schindler, "The Development of Chinese Conceptions of Supreme Beings," Asia Major: Introductory Volume (1923), pp. 298-366; H. H. Dubs, "The Archaic Royal Jou Religion," T'oung Pao 47 (1958): 217-59; and J. Shih, "The Notion of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion," Numen 16 (1969): 99-138. According to Joseph Shih, Ti was a supreme god and T'ien a personal god. Under the Chou these two divine names were used indifferently to invoke the same god; see also, by the same author,



422 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
"II Dio Supremo," in "La religione della Cina," Storia delle Religioni 5 (Thrin, 1971): 539 ff. In contrast to what is the case with other religions, books on the general history of Chinese religion are few. The most useful ones are
L. Wieger, Histoire des croyances religieuses et des opinions philosophiques en Chine depuis /'originejusqu'tl nosjours (Hien-hien, 1917), a very personal work, to be consulted with caution; Jan J. M. de Groot, The Religious System ojChina, 6 vols. (Leiden, 1892-1910; reprinted Thipei, 1964), irreplaceable for its documentation; Marcel Granet, La religion des Chinois (Paris, 1922); Henri Maspero, Melanges posthumes, vol. 1: Les religions chinoises (Paris, 1950); C. K. Yang, Religion in Chinese Society (Berkeley, 1967), an important work, though not a general history of Chinese religion; D. H. Smith, Chinese Religions (New York, 1968) (but see the review by Daniel Overmyer, HR 9 [1969-70]: 256-60); Laurence G. Thompson, Chinese Religion: An Introduction (Belmont, 1969), which chiefly presents religious ideas and practices after the Han; Werner Eichhorn, Die Religionen Chinas (Stuttgart, 1973), an admirable restatement; and Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society, ed. Arthur P. Wolf (Stanford, 1974). A short but brilliant exposition has been provided by Max Kaltenmark, "La religion de la Chine antique" and "Le taoisme religieux," in Henri-Charles Puech, ed., Histoire des religions, vol. 1 (1970), pp. 927-57,1216-48. Pertinent analyses of Chinese religious beliefs and institutions occur in the books by Marcel Granet, Fetes et chansons anciennes de la Chine (1919), Danses et iegendes de la Chine ancienne (1926), and La pensee chinoise (1934). See also Henri Maspero, La Chine antique (1927; new ed., 1955). On the Earth Mother, see Berthold Laufer, Jade: A Study ojChinese Archaeology and Religion (Chicago: Field Museum, 1912), pp. 144 ff. (against these views, see B. Karlgren, "Some Fecundity Symbols in Ancient China," pp. 14 ff.); Marcel Granet, "Le depot de l'enfant sur Ie sol: Rites anciens et ordalies mythiques," Revue arcMofogique (1922), reprinted in the volume Etudes sociologiques sur La Chine
(1953), pp. 159-202. According to Edouard Chavannes (Le T' ai Chan. Essai de monographie d'un cufte chinois [Paris, 1910], esp. pp. 520-25), the personification of the Soil as a Great Earth Goddess would be a comparatively recent phenomenon: it seems to have taken place about the beginning of the Han dynasty, in the second century B.C.; before that date there would have been only local cults crystallized around gods of the soil (p. 437). But Granet has shown that these gods replaced very ancient feminine or "neuter" divinities who had preceded them. This is a widespread phenomenon; see Eliade, "La Terre-Mere et les

For a detailed analysis ofthe various provincial and marginal cultures that were integrated into Chinese culture, see Wolfram Eberhard, Kuttur und Siedlung der Randvolker Chinas (supplement to vol. 36 of T'oung Pao [Leiden, 1942]); and Eberhard, Lokalkulturen im alten China, 2 vols. (vol. 1 was published as a supplement to vol. 37 of T'oung Pao [1943]; vol. 2 was published as Monumenta Serica, monograph no. 3 [Peking, 1943]). A corrected and enlarged version of the second volume of Lokalkulturen has been published under the title The Local Cultures of South and East China (Leiden, 1968).
On Chinese shamanism, see Eberhard, The Local Cultures, pp. 77 ff., 304 ff., 468 ff.; cf. Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 448 ff.; Joseph Thiel, "Schamanismus im alten China," Sinologica 10 (1968): 149-204; John S. Major, "Research Priorities in the Study of Ch'u Religion," HR 17 (1978): 226-43, esp. pp. 236 ff.
U9. The most important cosmogonic texts have been translated by Max Kaltenmark, "La naissance du monde en Chine," in Sources Orientales, vol. 1: La naissance du monde (Paris, 1959), pp. 453-68. The problem of Chinese mythology, especially that of cosmogonic myths, has been discussed, from different viewpoints, by these authors: Henri Maspero, "Legendes mythologiques dans Ie Chou King," JA 204 (1924): 1-100; Bernhard Karlgren, "Legends and Cults of Ancient China," Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, no. 18 (1946), pp. 199-365 (irreplaceable for its rich documentation, but see the critique of Karlgren' s method in the review by W. Eberhard, Artibus Asiae 9 [1946]: 355-64); Derk Bodde, "Myths of Ancient China," in S. N. Kramer, ed., Mythologies ofthe Ancient World (New York, 1961), pp. 369-408; J. Shih, "The Ancient Chinese Cosmogony," Studia Missionalia 18 (1969); 111-30; N. J.

In his analysis of the love songs preserved in the earliest "classic . book," the Shih Ching, Marcel Granet has brought out the structure of the seasonal festivals celebrated by the peasants, probably from Neolithic times (see his Fetes et chansons anciennes de la Chine). According to Kaltenmark, "They were chiefly the festivals of young people in connection with marriage festivals: the two sexual groups

came from different villages by virtue of the principle of exogamy and engaged in poetic contests whose themes were obligatory and drawn from the ritual landscape. This was nearly always a landscape of water and mountains, and all of its elements were sacred.... [The festivals] corresponded to critical moments in peasant life, those in which the agriculturalists changed their way of life. The spring season scattered them in the fields, where they lived in small huts; in winter they were once again in the familial village. There is certainly a connection between the holy places of the peasant communities on the one hand and the mountains, rivers, and sacred woods of the classic ritual on the other; both were ancestral centers, and the chief sanctuaries of the feudal cult-the temple of the ancestors, the altars of the gods of the soil and of harvests-were only diversifications of the ancient holy places. In the same way, certain royal cult practices are only transpositions of the peasant festivals" (Max Kaltenmark, "Religion de la Chine antique," p. 952). On the notion of Tao, see Granet, La pensee, pp. 300 ff.; Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 2 (1956), pp. 36 ff. (five volumes of this work have been published by Cambridge University Press; two more are in preparation); Koster, Symbolik, pp. 16 ff., 51 ff.; Ellen Marie Chen, "Nothingness and the Mother Principle in Early Chinese Taoism," International Philosophical Quarterly 9 (1969): 391-405; Holmes Welch, Taoism: The Parting of the Way (Boston, 1957; rev. ed. 1965), pp. 50 ff.; Max Kaltenmark, Lao tseu et Ie taoisme (Paris, 1965), pp. 30 ff.; Wang-tsit Chan, The Way ofLao Tzu (New York, 1963), pp. 31 ff. On the cosmogonic fragments of the Tao Te Ching, see Norman J. Girardot, "Myth and Meaning in the Tao te Ching: Chapters 25 and 42," HR 16 (1977): 294-328, and the bibliography listed in § 129.

131. Confucius was the first to use his teaching as a method of spiritual and political reform. He did not give formal instruction but simply conversed with his disciples. At the age of fifty he was given a post in the administration of the kingdom, but he resigned soon afterward, when he realized that he had no power. Disappointed, he traveled for more than ten years through all the states of the kingdom. At the age of sixty-seven he yielded to the urging of his old disciples and returned to his native country, Lu, where he lived five years more. Tradition ascribes a number of works to Confucius, especially the "Classic Books," but it is very unlikely that he composed them, and it is even doubted if he edited them. A collection of his notes and

conversations was published later by his disciples under the title Lun Yu ("Conversations," usually translated into English as Analects). We have used the translations by James Legge, The Analects of Confucius (new ed., New York, 1966); L. Giles, The Sayings of Confucius (new ed., New York, 1961), and W. E. Soothill, The Analects (London, 1958). See also F. S. Couvreur, Entretiens de Confucius et de ses disciples (new ed., Paris, n.d.); James R. Ware, The Sayings of Confucius (New York, 1955). There is an abundant literature on Confucius. We mention: H. G. Creel, Confucius and the Chinese Way (New York, 1949; republished 1960); Lin Yutang, The Wisdom of Confucius (New York, 1938); Liu Wu-chi, Confucius, His Life and Times (New York, 1955); Etiemble, Confucius (Paris, 1956); Daniel Leslie, Confucius (Paris, 1962); J. Munro, The Concept ofMan in Early China (Stanford, 1969), pp. 49-83 ("The Confucian Concept of Man"); Herbert Fingarette, Confucius: The Secular as Sacred (New York, 1972); and the selection of critical studies edited by Arthur F. Wright, Confucianism and Chinese Civilization (New York, 1967).
132. There are many translations of the Tao Te Ching (thirty-six in English alone, published between 1868 and 1955). We are frequently reminded of Marcel Granel's observation concerning the translation by Stanislas Julien (1842): "perfectly conscientious, it is not unfaithful to the text, but neither does it make possible to understand it" (La pensee chinoise, p. 503, n. 1). We have used the translation by Arthur Waley, The Way and Its Power (London, 1934), for its literary value, and the translation by Wing-tsit Chan for the richness and precision of its commentary. But the portions cited in the text follow the translation of Max Kaltenmark, in his admirable little book Lao tseu et Ie taofsme (Paris, 1963). The works by Waley and Chan contain long introductions, which examine the numerous problems raised by the history of the text. See also Jan Yiin-Hua, "Problems of Tao and the Tao Te Ching," Numen 22 (1975): 208-34 (the author presents the latest investigations into early Taoism by Fung Yu-Ian), and his "The Silk Manuscripts on Taoism," T' oung Pao 63 (1977): 66-84 (on the manuscripts recently discovered in a tomb dating from ca. 168). The commentary by Hoshang-kung has been translated by Edouard Erkes, Ho-shang-kung's Commentary on Lao-tse, Translated and Annotated (Ascona, 1950). Among the general presentations, we mention: Henri Maspero, Melanges posthumes, vol. 2: Le taoisme (Paris, 1950); Fung Yu-Ian, History of Chinese Philosophy, vol. 1 (Princeton, 1952), pp. 170 ff.;

A portion of the communications presented at the Colloquy on Taoism in Bellagio, September 7-14, 1968, has been published in History of Religions 9 (1969-70): 107-255; see, especially, Holmes H. Welch, "The Bellagio Conference on Taoist Studies," pp. 107-36, and Arthur F. Wright, "A Historian's Reflection on Taoist Tradition," pp. 248-55. On present orientations in the study of Taoism, see Norman J. Girardot, "Part of the Way: Four Studies on Taoism," HR 11 (1972): 319-37. We list some recent studies: Donald Munro, "The Taoist Concept of Man," in The Concept of Man in Early China (Stanford, 1969), pp. 117-39; J. J. L.

The relations between "philosophical Taoism," as it is expressed in the Tao Te Ching and by Chuang Tzu, and' 'religious Taoism," or the search for immortality by various techniques of subtle physiology and by alchemy, are a problem that is still under dispute. Some authors insist on the differences that separate "philosophical Taoism" from the cult of immortality. According to these authors (for example, A. G. Graham, H. H. Welch, Fung Yu-Ian), the first great period of philosophical Taoism was debased by the invasion of superstitions (magic and popular religion) and by Buddhist conceptions and practices. The result of this debasement is "Neo-Taoism" or the "Taoist religion." See, inter alia, Creel, What Is Taoism? pp. 1-24, 37 ff.; A. C. Graham, The Book ofLieh-tzu (London, 1960), pp. 10 ff., 16 ff. (see the critique of this position by K. Schipper in his review in T'oung Pao n.s. 51 [1964]: 288-92). On the other hand, French sinologists and their pupils (Granet, Maspero, Max Kaltenmark, C. Schipper, Anna Seidel, etc.) bring out the structural likeness between the two "Taoist schools." For discussion of some recent works that illustrate these two methodological approaches see Norman Girardot, "Part of the Way: Four Studies on Taoism," pp. 320-24, and especially the article by N. Sivin, "On the Word 'Taoist' as a Source of Perplexity: With Special Reference to the Relations of Science and Religion in

Cohen (Chicago, 1979); Ellen Marie Chen, "Is There a Doctrine of Physical Immortality in the Tao Te Ching?" HR 12 (1973): 231-49. Joseph Needham has emphasized the "magical, scientific, democratic, and politically revolutionary" character of Taoism (Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 2, p. 35); according to Needham, the Taoists were hostile not only to Confucianism but also to the whole feudal system (p. 100; cf. pp. 1O~132). However, Sivin has expressed doubts concerning the justification for these statements; no one has been able to demonstrate the antifeudalism of the Taoists or their identification with the beginnings of a scientific movement; see his "On the Word 'Taoist,' " pp. 309 ff. The writings of Chuang Tzu have been more than once translated into the chief European languages. The translation by James Legge, The Writings of Kwan-zze (SBE, vols. 39 and 40, London, 1891) is the best known. Now see Burton Watson, The Complete Works ofChuang Tzu (New York, 1968).

Memoires, trans. Edouard Chavannes (Paris, 1967), vol. 3, pp. 436-37: "In former times ... people could travel there: there are the Blessed and the drug that prevents death; there all beings, the birds and the quadrupeds, are white, and the palaces there are made of gold and silver; when those people were not yet there, they saw them from afar like a cloud; when they arrived there, the three sacred mountains were upside down under the water.... No one now has been able to arrive there" (see also vol. 2, pp. 152-53). These are countries that belong to a mythical geography, crystallized as the result of immemorial ecstatic experiences. Cf. the Hindu legends of the r:~is rising into the air to travel to the mysterious region in the North called Cvetadvlpa; so, too, the lake Anavatapta could be reached by those who possessed the supernatural power of flight; the Buddha and the arhats arrived at Anavatapta in the twinkling of an eye (see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 414 ff.). The crane is especially the bird of the Immortals; it was believed to live for more than a thousand years and "could breathe with its neck bent, a technique that makes the breath flexible and that the Taoists imitate" {Kaltenmark, Lao tseu, p. 153). See also J. J. de Groot, The Religious System of China, vol. 4, pp. 232-33, 295, 395. On the dance of the cranes, see Granet, Danses et Iegendes, pp. 216 ff.

On the antiquity of respiratory practices in China, see Hellmut Wilhelm, "Eine Chou-Inschrift fiber Atemtechnik," Monumenta Sinica 13 (1948): 385-88. On the technique of "nourishing the vital force," Henri Maspero's article remains fundamental: "Les procedes de 'nourrir Ie principe vital' dans la religion taolste ancienne," JA (1937): 177-252, 35~30; see also Le taoisme, pp. 107-14. For a comparative analysis ofIndian, Islamic, and Christian respiratory techniques (hesychasm in the last instance), see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 47-53. "The importance of Embryonic Respiration lies in the fact that the human body is made of breaths. At the beginning of the world, the Nine Breaths mingled to form Chaos; when Chaos dispersed, they separated: the pure and subtle breaths rose and formed heaven, the impure and coarse breaths descended and formed earth. The first gods, the greatest ones, were spontaneously created from the knotting of the breaths; then lesser gods were produced and rengendered. Later, the Yellow Emperor, Huang-ti, formed men by erecting earthen statues at the four cardinal points; he exposed them to all the breaths for three hundred years; when they were thoroughly penetrated, they were able to speak and move, and they gave birth to the various races of men.

Thus man's body is made from the impure breaths that formed the earth, but the vital breath that animates it is the pure breath that circulates between heaven and earth. For man to become immortal he must entirely replace the impure breaths in him by pure breaths; this is the goal of Embryonic Respiration. Whereas the ordinary man, subsisting on cereals, every day replaces the matter of his body by such gross matter, the Taoist, subsisting on breaths, replaces it by a purer and purer matter" (Maspero, Le taoisme, p. 114). The parallelism with the Orphic anthropogony and eschatology should be noted; see § 181. For the Taoists, the whole human body is filled with divinities and transcendent beings; see the description of this pantheon in Maspero, Le taoisme, pp. 116-37. It is possible to enter into relation with the gods by mystical meditation and by ecstasy (ibid., pp. 137-47).

Section 0/ "The Essence 0/Medical Prescriptions" (Tokyo, 1968; new ed. New York, 1970). The techniques analyzed are not exclusively Taoist. A text translated by Maspero ("Les procedes," p. 385) gives the following description of "making the semen return and repair the brain": "The principle ... consists in copulating so that the Essence [i.e., the semen] is extremely agitated; [then] when it is about to come out, [the penis] is quickly seized behind the scrotum and in front of the anus by the two middle fingers of the left hand; it is squeezed tightly, and the breath is slowly expelled through the mouth while the teeth are gritted several times without the breath being held. Then, when the Essence is emitted, it cannot come out but instead returns from the Jade Stem [the penis] and rises to enter the brain. This procedure is transmitted from Immortal to Immortal; drinking blood, they swear not to transmit it at random." See also van Gulik, Erotic Colour Prints o/the Ming Period, with an Essay on Chinese Sex Life/rom the
Han to the Ch'ing Dynasty, B.C. 206-A.D. 1644 (Tokyo, 1951), p. 78. In the Biography 0/ the Real Man 0/ Pure-Transcendence, which Maspero considers may date from the fifth century A.D., the method for returning the semen is included among the five recipes of the Immortal Master Chiang: "It is necessary, by perfect meditation, to dismiss [every] external thought; then men and women can practice the method of Eternal Life. This procedure is absolutely secret: transmit it to none but sages! . . . Whenever one practices [this procedure], [one must] enter into meditation; first, consciousness of one's body, and



Chapter 16. The Religions of Ancient China 431
consciousness of the external world, must be lost." After saying a prayer, "men keep [the mind fixed on] the kidneys, firmly preserving the Essence [i.e., the sperm] and distilling the Breath, which follows the spine and rises to the Ni-hoan [i.e., the Cinnabar Field situated in the head] against the current: this is what is called 'making return to the Origin,' hoan-yuan; women will keep [the mind fixed on] the heart, nourishing the spirits, distilling an immutable fire, making the Breath descend from the two breasts to the kidneys, whence it mounts by the spine and thus goes to the Ni-hoan; this is what is called 'transforming the real,' hoan-chen. After a hundred days one reaches Transcendence. Ifone practices [this procedure] for a very long time, one spontaneously becomes Real-Man and, living eternally, traverses the centuries. This is the method for not dying" (after the translation by Maspero, "Les procedes," pp. 386-87). On the "mysterious embryo" of the new immortal body, see Welch, Taoism, pp. 108 ff., 120 ff.

lation of chapters 4 and 6 of the treatise by Ko Hung (Pao P'u Tzu). Chapters 1-3 are translated by Eugen Feifel in Monumenta Serica 6 (1941): 113-211 (see ibid., vol. 9, 1944, for a new translation of chapter 4, also by Feifel), and chapters 7 and 11 by T. L. Davis and K. F. Chen, "The Inner Chapters of Pao-pu-tzu," Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 74 (1940-42): 287-325. On the value of the translations of T. L. Davis and his collaborators, see J. Needham, Science and Civilisation, vol. 5, pt. 2, p. 6, and Nathan Sivin, Chinese Alchemy, p. 15. James R. Ware has provided a complete translation of the Nei P'ien of Ko Hung in Alchemy, Medicine and Religion in the China ofA.D. 320: The ''Nei P'ien" ofKo Hung (Cambridge, Mass., 1966) (see our observations in HR 8 [1968]: 84-85). Sivin's Chinese Alchemy, pp. 145-214, contains an annotated translation of Tan ching yao chueh ("Essential Formulas from the Alchemical Classics"), a work ascribed to Sun Ssu-mo (sixth century A.D.). See also Roy C. Spooner and C. H. Wang, "The Divine Nine-Thm Tan Sha Method: A Chinese Alchemical Recipe," Isis 38 (1947): 235-42. According to H. H. Dubs, the earliest document would date from 144 B.C.; in that year an imperial edict threatens public execution to all those who are caught counterfeiting gold (the text is reproduced by Dubs, "The Beginnings of Alchemy," p. 63). But as Needham has pointed out (Science and Civilisation, vol. 5, pt. 2, pp. 47 ff.), counterfeiting gold is not, properly speaking, an alchemical "method." Dubs believes that the origin of alchemy is to be sought in the China of the fourth century B.C. According to him, alchemy could be born only in a civilization in which gold was little known and in which there was no knowledge of the methods of titration of the quantity of pure metal; the fact that in Mesopotamia these methods were well known as early as the fourteenth century B.C. makes the Mediterranean origin of alchemy improbable (Dubs, pp. 80 ff.). But this opinion has not been accepted by the historians of alchemy (see, inter alia, F. Sherwood Taylor, The Alchemists [New York, 1949], p. 75). Dubs (p. 84) thinks that alchemy was introduced into the West by Chinese travelers. However, according to Laufer, it is not impossible that "scientific" alchemy represents a foreign influence in China (Laufer, Isis [1929], pp. 330-31). On the penetration of Mediterranean ideas into China, see Dubs, pp, 82-83, nn. 122-23. On the probable Mesopotamian origin ofthe Chinese alchemical ideology, see H. E. Stapleton, "The Antiquity of Alchemy," Ambix 5 (1953): 15 ff. In a short discussion of the origin of Chinese alchemy, Sivin (pp. 19-30) rejects Dubs's hypothesis. The most radical critique has been provided by Needham (vol. 5, pt. 2, pp. 44 ff.), despite the fact that he too, though for entirely different reasons, maintains



Chapter 16. The Religions of Ancient China 433
that alchemy is a Chinese creation. According to Needham, the culture of ancient China was the only milieu in which belief in an elixir against death, the supreme work of the chemist, could crystallize (pp. 71, 82, 114-15), and the two conceptions-that of the elixir and that of the alchemical manufacture of gold-were integrated for the first time in
the history of China in the fourth century B.C. (pp. 12 ff., etc.). But Needham recognizes that the relation between gold and immortality was known in India before the 'sixth century B.C. (pp. 118 ff.). In a recent article, N. Sivin has drawn attention to the "panChinese" character of Taoist techniques and of alchemy; see his "On
the Word 'Taoist' as a Source of Perplexity," pp. 316 ff. In the same article (pp. 323 ff.) Sivin aptly analyzes the importance of Ko Hung, regarded by the majority of scholars as "the greatest of all Chinese alchemical writers" (Needham). Until recent years Western scholars regarded "external alchemy," or iatro-chemistry (wai-tan) , as "exoteric" and regarded "internal
[otherwise, yogic] alchemy" (nei-tan) as "esoteric." If this dichotomy is true for certain late authors such as Peng Hsiao (9th-10th centuries), in the beginning wai-tan "was as esoteric as its yogic counterpart" (Sivin, Chinese Alchemy, p. 15, n. 18). And in fact Sun Ssu-mo, the great iatro-chemist of the seventh century, representing "external alchemy," is entirely within the Taoist tradition; see the fragment cited in our The Forge and the Crucible, p. 110, after Sivin's translation in Chinese Alchemy, pp. 146-48.
For the alchemical symbolism of respiration and the sexual act, see R. H. van Gulik, Erotic Colour Prints, pp. 115 ff. Not only Lao Tzu's death (see n. 109) but also his birth have been interpreted as a cosmogony; see Kristofer Schipper, "The Taoist Body," HR 17 (1978): 355-86, esp. 361-74. On the deification of Lao Tzu, see Anna K. Seidel, La divinisation de Lao tseu dans Ie Taoisme des Han (Paris, 1969); see also, by the same author, "The Image of the Perfect Ruler in Early Taoist Messi

The general problem of continuity in Indian religion has been treated by J. Gonda, Continuity and Change (see esp. pp. 38 ff., 315 ff.). Ananda K. Coomaraswamy has on numerous occasions brought out the "traditional" character of Indian metaphysics (in the sense of its independence from historical conjunctions). See his Selected Papers, vols. 1 and 2, edited by Roger Lipsey (Princeton, 1977).
138. On presystematic Vedanta, see the respective chapters in the histories ofIndian philosophy by S. N. Dasgupta and S. Radhakrishnan; H. von Glasenapp, Die Philosophie der Inder (Stuttgart, 1949), pp. 129 ff.; William Beidler, The Vision of Self in Early Vediinta (Delhi, Patna,
Benares, 1975), esp. pp. 104 ff., 227 ff. We have examined (§ 82) the paradox ofthe "corporeal" ("mortal") and "incorporeal" ("immortal") brahman in the middle Upanishads; we also mentioned the mythological antecedents of this metaphysical speculation (§ 68). A similar tendency toward the coincidentia oppositorum is observable in Srupkhya philosophy, and especially the "teleological instinct" that moves the cosmic substance (prakr:tr) to further the deliverance of spirit (puru~a); see § 140. We add that the coincidentia oppositorum that characterizes the brahman (as totality of the real or the absolute Being) is also expressed in numerous myths, especially in myths that refer to the human condition. Thus, for example, the manifestations of evil (demons, monsters, etc.) emerge from the very body of the God (first of all from his excreta); in other words, evil, exactly like good, is of divine origin: it is an integral part of the divinity. See the Brahm~c and Pur3.Qic myths cited and commented on by W. D. O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology (Berkeley, 1976), pp. 139 ff. It should be added that this motif is documented in other mythologies: the devil, or Death, is born from the spittle or the excrement or the shadow of the Creator; see Eliade, Zalmoxis, the
Vanishing God, trans. Willard R. Trask (Chicago, 1972), pp. 82 ff. (Bulgarian legend); p. 83 (Mordvinian legend); p. 97 (Vogul myth).

Larson's book contains a critical review of the interpretations of the SaqJ.khya philosophy from Richard Garbe to S. Radhakrishnan (pp. 7-76). On SaqJ.khya ideas in the Upanishads, see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 111 fT.; E. H. Johnston, "Some SaqJ.khya and Yoga Conceptions of the Svetasvatara Upanishad," JRAS 30 (1930): 855-78; Johnston, Early Siirrtkhya (London, 1937); J. A. B. van Buitenen, "Studies in SaqJ.khya," esp. pp. 88 fT., 100 fT.; Larson, Classical Siirrtkhya, pp. 99 fT. On the ontological structure of the puru~a (the "Self"), see Yoga, pp. 15 fT.; Larson, Classical Siirtlkhya, pp. 181 fT. As we saw, the almost magical power of "gnosis" (vidyii, jniina) is tirelessly praised in the Upanishads (see vol. 1, § 80). Indeed, it is solely by virtue of (esoteric) metaphysical knowledge that the r~is succeed in destroying "ignorance" (avidyii) and obtaining liberation, that is, succeed in transcending the human condition. The quasi-magical force of "gnosis" can be compared on the one hand to the powers set in motion by rituals and on the other hand to the "marvelous powers" obtained by asceticism or by Yoga practices (see §§ 76 fT.). On this particular point, SaqJ.khya carries on the Vedic and Upanishadic tradition. F. Edgerton has cogently emphasized the "magical" character of knowledge in the Upanishads; see his The Beginnings of Indian Philosophy (London, 1965), pp. 22 fT. See also Corrado Pensa, "Some Internal and Comparative Problems in the Field of Indian Religions," in Problems and Methods of the History of Religions (Leiden, 1971), pp. 114 fT. Meditation of the SaqJ.khya type has been analyzed by Gerhard Oberhammer, Strukturen yogischer Meditation (Vienna, 1977), pp. 17-56.
140. On the modalities and "development" of substance (prakrti), see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 19 fT. In respect to the emergence of the world, it is important to point out the difference between Sfupkhya and Yoga. Whereas for Yoga the world comes into being because of ignorance of the real structure of spirit (see Yoga Sutra 2. 23-24), the Sfupkhya authors consider that the procession (pariI'Jiima) of substance (prakrti) is animated by a "teleo

logical instinct" for "the benefit of the puru~a" (Siirrtkhya Kiirikii 31, 42, etc.; cf. Eliade, Yoga, pp. 26 ff.). This attempt of the Sarpkhya philosophy to go beyond the dualism puru~a/prakr:ti can be compared to the speculations of the Upanishads-especially the middle Upanishads (Katha, Svetasvatara, Maitri)-on the two modalities of the brahman: "spiritual" and "material," "absolute" and "relative," etc. (see § 82; see also C.

The Yoga Sutra, with the commentaries by Vyasa and Vacaspatimisra, has been translated by J. H. Woods, The Yoga-System of Pataiijali (Cambridge, Mass., 1914). Jean Varenne has translated Huit Upanishads du yoga (Paris, 1971), and a translation of the Yoga-darsana Upani~ad is published in his Le Yoga et la tradition hindoue" (pp. 232-55; Eng. trans., pp. 200-222). The Yoga Sutra consists of four chapters, or books (piidas). The first, containing fifty-one aphorisms (sutras), is the "chapter on yogic enstasis" (samiiddhi-piida); the second, containing fifty-five aphorisms, is called siidhana-piida ("chapter on realization"); the third, of fifty-five sutras, treats of the "marvelous powers" (vibhUtl). Finally,

the fourth and last chapter, the kaivalya-pada (kaivalya = isolation), has only thirty-four sutras and probably represents a late addition. Whatever Patafijali's date may be (second century B.C. or third or even fifth century of our era), the techniques of asceticism and meditation expounded by the author of the Yoga Sutra are certainly of considerable antiquity; they are neither his discoveries nor those of his time; they had been tested many centuries before him. Moreover, it is not impossible that the original text of the Yoga Sutra was rehandled more than once in order to adapt it to new "philosophical situations." This basic text was meditated on and commented on by numerous authors. The first work of this kind that is known to us is the Yoga Bhii~ya of Vyasa (sixth-seventh centuries), a commentary later annotated (about 850) by Vacaspatimisra in his Tattvavaisaradi. These two texts are among the most important for an understanding of the Yoga Sutra. See Eliade, Pataiijali and Yoga, trans. Charles L. Mark

Aside from the Yoga "with eight members," as described by Patafijali (that is, the series of exercises and meditations, of "restraints" up to samadhl), Indian tradition also knows the "Yoga with six members" (~aqahga-yoga). In this series, the first three "members" (yama, niyama, asana) are lacking, but a "member" unknown to the Patafijalian tradition appears: tarka (literally "reasoning," but here having the meaning "supreme knowledge"). See A. Zigmund-Cerbu, "The ~aQatigayoga," HR 3 (1963): 128, 134; C. Pensa, "Osservazzioni e riferimenti per Ie studio dello ~aqahga-yoga," Istituto Orientale di Napoli, Annali 19 (1969): 521-28. This yogic system "with six limbs" played an important part in late Buddhism and in Tantrism; see vol. 3. See also Gunter Gronbold, $aqahga-yoga (Inaugural diss., Munich, 1969), esp. pp. 118 ff. (Kalacakra Tantra); pp. 122 ff. (the series of masters said to have taught the ~aqahga-yoga).

"Since they are now placed, by definition, 'beyond good and evil,' these supermen need no longer take any account of earthly values; everything is permitted to them. As one might expect, there are many yogins who, claiming (or sincerely believing) that they have attained samadhi, then take advantage of that attainment in order to 'live in heaven' on earth. And metaphysically they are quite justified in doing so, insofar as their acts are all at once without cause and without effect. Without cause, because the jivan-mukta is by definition liberated from all desire (since all his vasanas have been destroyed); without effect, because the liberated soul can no longer be affected by karman.

act in such a situation must therefore be a gratuitous act, and this is why it is said of the jivan-mukta that he is in a state of absolute solitude (kaivalya)" (Varenne, Yoga, English trans., p. 138).

Reynolds and Donald Capps, eds., The Biographical Process (The Hague, 1976),pp. 37-61. After referring to the methodological positions characteristic of scholars in the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth-the "myth-oriented" (E. Senart, H. Kern, A. K. Coomaraswamy) and the "historicists" (H. Oldenberg, T. W. and Caroline A. F. Rhys-Davids}-Reynolds analyzes some recent approaches that attempt to integrate the two viewpoints: that of "myth" and that of "history." Benjamin I. Schwartz has cogently drawn attention to the fallacious character of the sociological interpretations of the rise of Buddhism

and, in general, of soteriological movements: "If Buddhism did indeed arise within an urban commercial environment, as Prof. Thapar suggests, it hardly strikes us as a particularly 'bourgeois' philosophy. While she stresses the political and social doctrine of early Buddhism, one has the feeling that the heart of Buddhism does not lie there" ("The Age of Transcendence" in "Wisdom, Revelation and Doubt: Perspectives on the First Millennium B.C.," Daedalus, Spring, 1975, p. 4). On the symbolism of the "Great -Man" (mahiipuru~a), see A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Buddha's cut/ii, Hair, and u~fJf~a, Crown," JRAS 26 (1928): 815-40; Stella Kramrisch, "Emblems of the Universal Being," Journal of the Indian Society for Oriental Art 3 (Calcutta, 1935): 148-60; A. Wayman, "Contributions Regarding the Thirty-Two Characteristics of the Great Person," in the Liebenthal Festschrift, ed. K. Roy, Sino-Indian Studies 5 (Santiniketan, 1957): 243-60. The theme ofthe "Seven Steps" recurs in the Nativity of Mary; see the Proto-Gospel of James, chap. 6, and the commentary by Henri de Lubac, Aspects du Bouddhisme (Paris, 1951), pp. 126-27. The boddhisattva's presentation in the temple has been compared to an episode in Pseudo-Matthew 23: "When Blessed Mary entered the [Egyptian] temple with the child, all the idols were flung to the ground." But the two stories prove to be unlike: the Egyptian idols are thrown down forever, for Christ abolishes the worship of false gods, but the Briihma.J}.ic divinities prostrate themselves in homage to the future Savior; see Foucher, La vie du Bouddha, pp. 55 fT. The episode of the r~i Asita is related at length in Lalita Vistara, pp. 101 fT.; see the translation of the passage in Foucher, La vie du Bouddha, pp. 61~3. Foucher also gives the relevant iconography. Asita's prediction has been compared with the episode ofthe old Simeon taking the child Jesus in his arms and blessing God ("for mine eyes have seen the salvation which thou has prepared," Luke 2:8-20, 25-35); see Foucher's commentary, pp. 6~.

The word ajivika has been explained by the root aj[va ("way of life or profession of a class of beings"), but it could also derive from the expression ajivat, "as long as life," a reference to the fundamental doctrine that postulated a large number of existences before obtaining deliverance.

For la Vallee-Poussin's first interpretation, see his The Way to Nirviif]a: Six Lectures on Ancient Buddhism as a Discipline of SaLvation (Cambridge, 1917), Nirviif]a (Paris, 1925), and his article "NirvaI}a" in Indian HistoricaL QuarterLy 4 (1928): 347-48. For Stcherbatsky's views, see his The Central Conception ofBuddhism and the Meaning ofthe Word "Dharma" (London, 1923) and The Conception ofBuddhist Nirviif]a (Leningrad, 1927). However, after a long controversy, each of these two scholars became convinced by the interpretation of his antagonist; see T. Stcherbatsky, "Die drei Richtungen in der Philosophie des Buddhismus," Rocznik Orjentalistyczny 10 (1934): 1-37; L. de la Vallee-Poussin, "Buddhica," HJAS 3 (1938): 137-60. Friedrich Heiler has examined the concept of nirviif]a in terms of religious experience; see his Die buddhistische Versenkung (Munich, 1918). On the "road to nirviif]a" and the symbolism of initiation, see Eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, trans. Willard R. Trask, Bollingen Series 56 (Princeton, 1970), pp. 155 if.

The work by Pietro de Francisci, Primordia civitatis (Rome, 1959), contains several chapters on the social structures and religious ideas of archaic Rome (pp. 197-405); useful for their documentation, these pages must, however, be read with caution (see the critique by G.

A first wave of Aryan-speaking peoples, acquainted with the metallurgy of copper and practicing cremation, settles in northern Italy in the second millennium; they are the authors of the so-called terramare civilization ("from terra mar[n]a, 'fat earth,' because of its wealth of organic matter, where the peasants traditionally came to get their fertilizers" [Heurgon, Rome et La Mediterranee occidentaLe, p. 64]). A second wave, toward the end of the second millennium, is that of the Villanovans: they use iron and put the ashes of the dead in large terracotta urns, buried at the bottom of a pit. At the beginning of the first millennium Latium was dominated by a civilization of the Villanovan type. Deserving of mention among general histories are: A. Piganiol, Histoire de Rome, 5th ed.

Since the work by G. Wissowa, Religion und KuLtus der Romer, 2d ed.

In addition to the most popular version-his being carried away during a storm-another tradition reports that, because he became a tyrant, Romulus was killed by the senators; the tyrannicides then dismembered his body and carried away the pieces under their robes; see Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Rom. arch. 2. 56; Plutarch, Romulus 27; Ovid, Fasti 2. 497, etc. Puhvel compares this version with the dismemberment of Puru~a, Ymir, and Gayomart; in the Roman myth the episode was transferred from Remus to his twin brother, "because a man can be killed only once" ("Remus et Frater," p. 155).

On the Indo-European mythological motifs camouflaged in the "history" of Horatius and the Curiatii and in that of Cocles and Scaevola, see Dumezil, Horace et les Curiaces (1942) and La rei. rom. arch., p. 90 (where the author's earlier works are listed). The two maimed men, Cocles and Scaevola ("Cyclops" and "Lefty") successively save Rome, beseiged by Lars Porsena, "the one paralyzing the Etruscan army by the dazzling glance of his eye, the other sacrificing his right hand before the Etruscan leader in an heroic act of perjury." This legend has its parallel in the Scandinavian pair of the one-eyed god and the one-armed god, 6t5inn and Tyr, of whom "the former, because he has sacrificed an eye, receives supernatural wisdom as compensation, while the other saves the gods by thrusting his right hand into the jaws of the demon-wolf" (Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 90; English trans., pp. 75-76). See Dumezil's discussion ofH. J. Rose's theses (especially those set forth in "Numen and Mana," HTR 29 [1951]: 109-30) and those of H.

Livy (21. 62) reports the prodigies that occurred during the winter of ca. 218, one of the most dramatic of the Punic War. In the Forum boarium an ox had climbed by himself to the third story, from which he later threw himself down. Images of ships had burned in the sky. The temple of Spes had been struck by lightning. Juno's lance had moved of itself. In the country human phantoms clad in white had been seen far off.

Stones had rained in the Picenum, etc. Consulted, the Sibylline Books decreed nine days of sacrifices. The whole city was busy with the expiation of the portents: first, there were lustrations, followed by sacrifices; then an offering of gold weighing forty pounds was carried to the temple of Juno, and a bronze statue of the goddess was consecrated on the Aventine, etc. See E. de Saint-Denis, "Les enumerations de prodiges dans rreuvre de Tite-Live," Revue de philologie 16 (1942): 126-42. A list handed down by Varro enumerates the divine entities who governed the various moments of agricultural activity: Vernactor (for turning over fallow ground), Imporcitor (for plowing deep furrows), Institor (for sowing), Oburator (for surface digging), Occator (for harrowing), Sarritor (for weeding), Subruncinator (for second dressing), Messor (for harvest), Connector (for carting), Conditor (for storing), Promitor (for taking out of storage). The list comes from the Libri iuris pontijicii by Fabius Pictor, cited by Varro in a text preserved by Servius (ad Vergil, Georg. 1. 21); see J.

The lemures that visit houses during the Lemuria festival in May are not identical with the larvae, which come to torment the living at any time of year; see Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 373. The dead also return on August 24, October 5, and November 8, when the mundus-the trench that gives access to the underground world-is opened. "When the mundus is open, it is as ifthe door ofthe grim infernal deities were open" (Varro, cited by Macrobius, Saturnalia 1. 16. 18). But the term mundus also designated the trench into which Romulus had thrown the "first-fruits of all things the use of which was sanctioned by custom as good and by nature as necessary," together with a small portion ofthe soil of each of his companions' native lands (Plutarch, Romulus 11. 1-4; Ovid, Fast; 4. 821-24).

See also Dum~zil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 584-89. The origin and history of the Sibylline Books are obscure. According to legend, they were acquired by Tarquin, who deposited them in the temple of Jupiter and appointed a commission of two members with the duty of consulting them-but only when ordered to do so and only for the sake of the state. In ca. 367 the permanent college of the decemviri, five patricians and five plebeians, was created. Whatever their origin may have been, the Books were already Hellenized when the Second Punic War increased their consultation. In ca. 213 the carmina Marciana were added to them. "Burned in Sulla's time along with the Capitol, reconstructed or forged anew by commissions sent to every place in the world where there were Sibyls, and particularly to Erythrae, expurgated under Augustus and transferred from Jupiter to Apollo, from the Capitol to the Palatine, revised once more under Tiberius, they were burned at the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era by Stilicho. The college, which had been honored by the emperors, then disappeared" (Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 594; English trans., p. 605). On the origin of the Sibylline Books, see also J. Gage, Apollon romain (Paris, 1955), pp. 26-38,196-204; cf. R. Bloch, "Les origines etrusques des Livres Sibyllins," Melanges A. Ernout (1940), pp. 21-28.

Wissowa, "Zum Rituel der Arvalbriider," Hermes 52 (1917): 331-47; E. Norden, Aus romischen Priesterbiichern (1939), pp. 109-268; A. Pasoli, Actafratrum Arualium (1950) (text and commentary). The principal rite of the fetiales consisted in demanding reparation in the name of Rome; ifhe did not obtain satisfaction, the fetial returned and, after thirty-three days, ceremonially declared war by throwing a lance or a cornel branch on the enemy's soil (Livy, 1. 32. 5-14; etc.). The Salii, "dancer-priests," ritually opened the season of war on March 1. They ran through the city and, at the consecrated places, indulged in contorted dances, at the same time singing a carmen (which had become incomprehensible by the time of the end of the Republic)



454 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
in honor of the gods. At the close of each day of dancing there was a feast. From March 9 on, the rites became more spectacular; there were horse races, lustration of weapons and war trumpets, etc. In October the Salii celebrated the closing of the season of war by lustrations of arms (to spare the city the miasma of spilled blood). An attempt has been made to reconstruct the text of the carmen saliare; see L. Bayard, "Le chant des Saliens, essai de restitution," Melanges des sciences rei. des Facultes Catholiques de Lille 2 (1945): 45-58.
The twelve Fratres Arvales had their cult center in the sacred wood of "the Goddess" (Dea Dia), 75 kilometers from Rome. The annual ceremonies were celebrated during three days in May: the first and the last at Rome, the second-and most important-at the cult center. In the sacred wood the Brothers immolated two pregnant sows (porciliae, outstanding symbols of fecundity) and ate the flesh. Then, crowned with ears ofgrain and veiled, they advanced to the temple in procession; in front of the sanctuary they passed the ears from hand to hand. After a vegetable meal, they shut themselves up in the temple and sang invocations to the Lares and to Mars. (The text of the carmen arvale, in a very archaic Latin, is hard to interpret.) The invocations were followed by a dance and by horse races. See Ileana Chirassi, "Dea Dia e Fratres Arvales," SMSR 39 (1968): 191-291. On the Lupercalia, see L. Deubner, "Lupercalia," ARW 13 (1910): 481 ff.; A. K. Michels, "The Topography and Interpretation of the Lupercalia," Trans. Amer. Phil. Assoc. 54 (1953): 35-39 (with an extensive bibliography); M. P.

The name of the brotherhood certainly contains the name of the wolf, but the formation is obscure; see Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 352 and n. 2. J. Gruber derives lupercus from a "luposequos," i.e., "qui lupum sequitur" (Glotta, vol. 39, 1961). The brotherhood would be a Miinnerbund inherited from protohistory; see F. Altheim, A History of Roman Religion, pp. 206-17 (German ed., Romische Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1, pp. 131 ff.). A. AlfOldi also considers the Luperci to be the vestige of a Miinnerbund-the brotherhood, in fact, that would have played a decisive part in the foundi~g of the Roman state; see his Die trojanischen Urahnen der Romer (Rektoratsprogr. d. Univ. Basel fur das Jabr 1956). For Kerenyi, the Luperci represented at once wolves (the primitive form of the brotherhood, of Nordic origin) and goats (southern influence); see his "Wolfund Ziege am Fest der Lupercalia," in Melanges Marouzeau (1948), pp. 309-17 (reprinted in Niobe [Zurich, 1949], pp. 136-47).



Chapter 20. Roman Religion 455
Plutarch (Romulus 21. 10) describes a rite of the initiatory type: after a sacrifice of goats, two youths of noble birth are brought before the Luperci; "some of them touch their foreheads with a bloody knife and others wipe the stain off at once with wool dipped in milk. The youths must laugh after their foreheads have been wiped." The initiatory character of the brotherhood has been analyzed by G. Dumezil, Le probleme des Centaures (Paris, 1929), pp. 203-22. Now see Gerhard Binder, Die Aussetzung des Konigskindes: Kyros und Romulus (Meisenheim am Glan, 1964), pp. 90-115, esp. pp. 98 ff. On the race of the two groups of Luperci, see G.

Eitrem, Opferritus und Voropfer der Griechen und Romer (1913); Wissowa, Religion und Kultus, pp. 380 ff.; Latte, Romische Religionsgeschichte, pp. 379-92.
Dumezil has brought out the structural analogy between the sacrifice of the suovetaurilia (comprising the immolation of pigs, ovines, and bulls), a sacrifice peculiar to the cult of Mars, and the sautriima1']l, offered to Indra; see his Tarpeia (1947), pp. 117-58, and La rei. rom. arch., pp. 247-51. On the ritual of the October horse, sacrificed to Mars, and the similarities with the asvamedha, reserved for the warrior class (see § 73), see, most recently, Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 225-39, and his Fetes romaines d'ete et d'automne, pp. 179-219.
Later (end of the fifth century?), under the influence ofthe Etruscans (who, in fact, were following a Greek model), Rome saw the introduction of the lectisternia, characterized by the physical presence of the god to whom sacrifice was being offered. "To feed the god at the altar is the object of every sacrifice. To serve him a meal is another matter" (Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 559; Eng. trans., p. 567). And in fact the god (i.e., his cult statue) lay on a bed near the table that was served for him. "The lectisternia were originally served outside of the temples: in this way men could see with their own eyes these protectors, who were ordinarily confined in a cella" (ibid.).

On the archaic triad, see the treatment by Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 187-290, with the bibliography of his earlier works (most importantly: Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus [1941]; Naissance de Rome [1944];
L'heritage indo-europeen a Rome [1948]; and Mythe et epopee, vol.
1 [1968], pp. 259-437). Wissowa had already drawn attention to the existence of the pre-Capitoline triad; see his Religion und Kultus, pp. 23, 133-34. According to Latte, the grouping is late and accidental (Romische Religionsgeschichte, pp. 37, 195, etc.); but see Dumezil's critique, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 154 ff. In the circumstances in which Jupiter appears to be agrarian or martial, allowance must be made for the mode of his interventions (Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., p. 193). "Politics and law, power and justice are united, at least ideally, at many points. Another element of the prestige of Jupiter, as of Zeus and the sovereign gods of Vedic India, VaruI}.a and Mitra, is his role as witness, as guarantor, as avenger of oaths and pacts, in private as well as in public life, in commerce between citizens or with foreigners" (ibid., p. 190; Eng. trans., p. 179).

In the sanctuary at pyrgi (one of the ports of Caere), a Punic inscription has recently been discovered, together with tablets inscribed in Etruscan, dating from ca. 500. The Punic text contains the homage of the Etruscan king to the Phoenician goddess Astarte, assimilated to Uni (= Juno). This is another proof of the malleability of Etruscan theology, ready to receive a mythico-ritual formula of the Semitic world and homologize it with a national divinity. Cf. A. Dupont-Sommer, "L'inscription punique recemment decouverte a Pyrgi (ltalie)," JA 252 (1964): 289-302; the translation (p. 292) is reproduced and commented on by Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 665 ff.

Pliny's and Seneca's texts on the theory of thunderbolts depend on the same source (Caecina). Jupiter himself had at his disposal three different categories of thunderbolts. The other eight types of thunderbolts were manipulated by the gods corresponding to Juno, Minerva, Vulcan, Mars, and Saturn and to three other divinities who have remained unknown.

The forty divinities whose names are inscribed on the bronze model of a liver found at Piacenza are probably grouped according to a certain order that it has not yet been possible to reconstruct. We have another classification of the pantheon, namely, the one transmitted by Martianus Minneus Felix Capella in his treatise De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii O. 41-61). This is a late text (fifth century A.D.), full of Greek and Greco-Roman speculations; however, it is valuable for the clear and detailed presentation of the gods assigned to the sixteen celestial regions. (The chief source seems to have been the translation of the Etruscan rituals made by Nigidius Figulus, a contemporary of Cicero.) Thulin had no doubt that there was a correspondence between the divine personages inscribed in the sixteen divisions of the liver from Piacenza and Martianus Capella's sixteen regions (see his Die Gotter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza [Berlin, 1906]). But Stefan Weinstock has brought out the considerable contribution made by Hellenistic astrology; see his "Martianus Capella and

In certain tomb scenes a demon holds a book or a scroll or is writing on it. The few characters that it has been possible to decipher indicate the name and age of the dead person.

Dumezil, La rei. rom. arch., pp. 379 ff. "The Aventine cult is evidence of a victory of the plebs, resulting from one of the first of the many compromises which little by little were to assure that social class of political and religious equality. The classic pattern-the plebeian aediles holding office in the outbuildings ofthe temple and accumulating there the archives of the plebs, the texts of the plebiscites, and later, as a precautionary measure, duplicates of the senatus consulta of the
rival order-would have been formed in the beginning of the fifth century, at the time of the foundation" (Dumezil, p. 384; Eng. trans., Archaic Roman Religion, vol. 1, pp. 379-80). See also F. Altheim, History of Roman Religion, p. 250. It is probable that the association of three agrarian divinities, two of them female and one male, comes from Magna Graecia; see Dumezil, p. 448. On the occasion of the Cerealia, in addition to the sacrifice of sows, a barbarous "game" was played: foxes were turned loose in the Circus "with burning torches fastened to their backs" (Ovid, Fasti 4.679-82).

Powell has taken up Dumezil's demonstration (in Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, pp. 110-23) in his study "Celtic Origins: A Stage in the Enquiry,' , Journal ofthe Royal Anthropological Institute 78 (1948): 71-79; cf. Piggott, The Druids, p. 88. And, as Dumezil remarks elsewhere, "The Irish conceived the history of their island as a succession of invasions; the next-to-the-Iast invading people, that of the Thatha De Danann, 'tribes of the goddess Dana,' is in fact composed of the old gods of paganism, especially those whom the Celts had inherited from their Indo-European ancestors." The general staff of the Thatha De Danann is made up of the following: the great god Dagda, devoted to high Druidic magic; Ogma, the champion god; Lug ("the god of all trades"); Dian Cecht, the physician; and Goibniu, the blacksmith. The third function in its most necessary form, agriculture, the supplier of food and wealth, was represented by the preceding inhabitants of the island, the Fomors, "demonic beings whom the Thatha De Danann conquered, killed for the most part, and domesticated the rest. And it was at the end ofthis war, at their famous victory of Mag Thired, that the invading Thatha De Danann decided to leave the leader of the conquered folk alive, in return for his revealing the secrets that were to insure the agricultural and pastoral prosperity of Ireland" (G. Dumezil, Mythe et epopee, vol. 1 [1%8], p. 289; see also note 1 for references to earlier works). Jan de Vries has followed Dumezil's interpretation in his La religion des Celtes, pp. 157 iI. See also Myles Dillon, Celts and Aryans, pp. 96 iI.

On the other hand, the name Ogmios appears to be borrowed from

Greek ogmos, "line, row, furrow"; but this divine name of Greek origin conceals a Celtic religious reality. The god Ogma is called "father of the ogams," alphabetical characters used especially in the 360 funerary inscriptions found chiefly in Ireland and Wales and dating from the fifth and sixth centuries; see J.

M. L. Sjoestedt has emphasized the importance of the ritual union of the god-chief and the mother goddess on New Year's Day (Samain), when' 'the Celtic year is reborn"; this hieros gamos was' 'the guarantee of the ever-reborn vitality of the tribe" (Dieux et heros des Celtes, p. 57). The theme of the hieros gamos between the Irish sovereign and the territorial goddess (epiphany of Terra Mater) has been fully treated by Celtic scholars. See, most recently, Proinsias Mac Cana, "Aspects of the Theme of King and Goddess in Irish Literature," Etudes Celtiques 7 (1956): 76-114, 356-413; 8 (1958): 59-65; Rachel Bromwich, "Celtic Dynastic Themes and the Breton Lays," Etudes Celtiques 9 (1960): 439-74; Ross, Pagan Celtic Britain, pp. 292 ff. See also the works by A. C. L. Brown and A. K. Coomaraswamy cited below. F. R. Schroder was the first to call attention to a passage in the Topographia Hibernica (ca. 1185) of Geraldus Cambrensis in which it is related that among the Kenelcunil, a tribe of Ulster, the king copulates with a white mare in the presence of his subjects. The mare is then killed, its flesh is cooked, and, from the contents of the pot, a bath is made ready for the king. He then shares out the meat and drinks the liquid in which he has bathed; see SchrOder, "Ein altirischer Kronungsritus und das indogermanischen Rossopfer," Zeitschrift fur keltische Philologie 16 (1927): 31~12. SchrOder compared this ritual of royal consecration with the asvamedha (see § 73). The problem was then taken up again, from Dumezil's point of view, by Jaan Puhvel in "Aspects of Equine Functionality," in his Myth and Law among the Indo-Europeans (1970), pp. 159-72 (but see Dumezil, Fetes romaines d'ete et d'automne, pp. 216-19).

myth of Rhiannon, Breton equivalent of Epona, corresponds in Ireland to the myth of Macha). Like Gricourt, Puhvel holds that the territorial goddesses originally had hippomorphic features; see his "Aspects," pp. 165 fT. Dumezil had recognized in the three Machas a seeress, a woman warrior, and a peasant mother; in other words, they represented the three social functions: that of the priest, the warrior, and the peasant; see his "Le trio des Machas," Mythe et epopee, vol. 1, p. 603. In one of the versions of "the horrible old woman and the young hero," the fairy (= goddess) explains the meaning of the kiss that brings about her metamorphosis: "As at first thou hast seen me ugly but in the end beautiful, even so is royal rule. Without battles it may not be won, but in the end, to anyone, it is comely and handsome" (trans. by Ananda Coomaraswamy in "On the Loathly Bride," Speculum 20 [1945]: 391-404 [a comparative study of this theme, making use principally of Indian sources)). A. C. L. Brown has amply analyzed the theme of the "horrible fairy who represents sovereignty" in the Breton Grail romances; see chapter 7 of his work The Origin of the Grail Legend (Cambridge, 1943). On the religious importance of woman among the Celts and the ancient Germans, see Helmut Birkhan, Germanen und Kelten his zum Ausgang der Romerzeit, pp. 487 fT.
172. Most of our information on the status and ceremonies of the Gallic Druids goes back to Posidonius' History (book 23). The work is lost, but Strabo (ca. 63 B.C.-A.D. 21), Diodorus Siculus (who wrote Detween 60 and 30 B.C.), Athenaeus (second century A.D.), and Julius Caesar (who also had access to other sources) reproduced and summarized long passages from it. J. J. Tierney has succeeded in identifying these borrowings in his study "The Celtic Ethnography of Posidonius," Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 60 (1959-60): 180-275 (the texts are published on pp. 225-46, followed by an English translation, pp. 247-75). On Posidonius' importance for the ethnology of the Celts, see also Arnaldo Momigliano, Alien Wisdom: The Limits of Hellenization (Cambridge, 1975), pp. 67 fT. We also have some information transmitted by Pliny (Nat. Hist. 16. 249) and some commentaries by several late authors (first-fourth centuries A.D.), which, to use Nora Chadwick's expression, make up "the Alexandrine tradition"; see her The Druids (Cardiff and Connecticut, 1966); see also Stuart Piggot, The Druids (1968), pp. 88 fT.

There is a large literature on the Druids, most of it unusable. The book by T. D. Kendrick, The Druids: A Study in Keltic Prehistory (London, 1927), must be mentioned for its ultra-positivist point of view; according to this author, the Druids were "wizards" (see the pertinent
observations by Fran~oise Le Roux, "Contribution a une definition
des druides," Ogam 12 [1960]: 475-86, esp. pp. 476 ff.). The following may be consulted: Jan de Vries, "Die Druiden," Kairos 2 (1960): 67-82; de Vries, La religion des Celtes, pp. 212 ff.; F. Le Roux, Les Druides (Paris, 1961); Nora Chadwick, The Druids; S. Piggott, The Druids (all these works include more or less complete bibliographies; Piggott's book, pp. 123 ff., also contains the history of the romantic image of the Druids, which dates from the seventeenth century). The information given by Caesar is the most valuable because, during his consulate in Gaul, he had personally become aware of the spiritual authority and political power of the Druids. Moreover, there were many people in Rome who knew Gaul and could therefore inhibit any exaggerations on his part. The vernacllIar literatures of Great Britain and Ireland make up an inestimable source for a knowledge of the Druidic order. See the works by Myles Dillon, D. A. Binchy, J. E. C. Williams, and K. H. Jackson, cited above (§ 170), and Fran~oise Le Roux, Les Druides. The differences recorded by some classic authors between Druids, bards, and vates is not documented among the insular Celts (see Le Roux, pp.
14 ff.).
Caesar writes that the doctrine of the Druids "was discovered in Britain and was transferred thence to Gaul, and today those who would study the subject more accurately journey, as a rule, to Britain to learn it" (De Bello Gal. 6. 13. 11 ff.). This observation has inspired several extravagant hypotheses (some of them are mentioned by de Vries, La rei. des Celtes, pp. 218-20). But the Druidic order is a Celtic institution inherited-in Gaul as in Great Britain-from a common past; de Vries analyzes the reasons that seem to lie behind Caesar's statement. Caesar adds that people came from everywhere to "the consecrated spots in the land of the Carnutes" to have their disputes settled. But since the suits of individuals were usually dealt with by the Druids of their own community; it is likely that Caesar's reference is to political conflicts between tribes. The assembly at the locus consecratus constituted a "supranational" court of final appeal; see Hubert, Les Celtes, vol. 2, p. 227; de Vries, La rel. des Celtes, pp. 215-16. On the prohibition against committing the sacred tradition to writing, see M. Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Literatur, vol. 1 (Leipzig, 1908), p. 31; G.

Jan de Vries has shown the danger of explaining ancient Germanic religion by the help of folklore (see esp. pp. 62-63). The Romans homologized 60inn-Wodan with Mercury, and the Germans translated dies Mercurii by "day ofWodan." The reasons for this homologation are not clear. The fact has been adduced that 60inn, like Mercury, was the protector of traders. In addition, Mercury was supremely the psychopomp, and 60inn ended by assimilating the function of god of the dead. B]lt'wllat makes the two most akin is their "spiritual" faculties, and especially their mastery of magical powers and their relations with occult techniques (cf. § 92). On 60inn hanging from the cosmogonic tree, see A. G.

In chapter 9 of his Germania, Tacitus writes that the chief gods are Mercury, Mars, and Hercules, that is, Wodan-60inn, Tyr (Tiwaz), and Th6r (Donar). In chapter 39, in his presentation of the Semnones, the chief tribe of the people of the Suebi, the Roman historian relates that at a particular time the delegates of the Suebi gather in a sacred wood; there they immolate human victims to a god whom Tacitus calls regnator omnium deus. For a century scholars have tried to prove that this supreme god was either Tyr or Wodan; see the history of the controversy in R. Pettazzoni, "Regnator omnium deus," Essays on the History ofReligion (Leiden, 1954), pp. 136-50; the Italian text appeared in SMSR 119-20 (1943-46): 137 ff.; cf. Hildebrecht Hommel, "Die Hauptgottheiten der Germanen bei Tacitus," ARW 37 (1941): 144-73; J. de Vries, Altgermanische Religion, vol. 2, pp. 32 ff.; Eliade, Images and Symbols: Studies in Religious Symbolism, trans. Philip Mairet (New York, 1952), pp. 103 ff. Pettazzoni (p. 145) rejects the identifications with Tyr or Wodan; for him, the reference is to the impersonal numen of the sacred forest. It must, however, be taken into account that the Suebi were the most important tribe of the Herminones, an eponym derived from the name Irmin-Hermin (see A. Closs, "Die Religion des Semnonenstammes," pp. 653 ff.). Now Rudolf of Fulda, author of the Translatio S. Alexandri, composed between 863 and 865, writes that the Saxons venerated a tall wooden column, called in their language Irminsul and in Latin universalis columna, for it supports the whole world. (See other references to Irmin and Irminsul in R. Meissmer, "Irminsul bei Widukind von Corvey," Bonner Jahrbucher 139 [1934]: 34-35; Heinz Lowe, "Die Irminsul und die Religion der Sachsen," Deutsches Archiv fur Geschichte des Mittelalters 5 [1942]: 1-22.) So Irmin was a celestial god; in fact, a number of archaic peoples represent their celestial and supreme god in a column that, symbolically, supports the Sky. Following other authors, H. Lowe (p. 15) identifies Irmin with the regnator omnium deus. It follows that the Germans worshiped a celestial and supreme deity named Irmin or Tiwaz-Ziu (cf. H. Hommel, "Die Hauptgottheiten," p. 151), a god who was later supplanted by Wodan-60inn. See the excellent analysis by Werner Miiller, Die Jupitergigantensiiulen und ihre Verwandtes (Meisenheim am Glan, 1975), esp. pp. 88 ff.

Klasse 88 (1951): 343-72; Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion ofthe North, pp. 196 ff. The interpretation of Baldr as a genius of agrarian fecundity, proposed by Mannhardt and Frazer, has been revived by F. R. Schroder, "Balder und der zweite Merseburger Spruch," Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift 34 (1953): 166-83; the theory has been criticized by J. de Vries, "Der Mythos von Balders Tod," Arkiv for Nordisk Filologi 70 (1955): 41-60 (but de Vries's interpretation-Baldr's death as myth, corresponding to a ritual of initiation for young warriors-has not been accepted by Dumezil; see his Les dieux des Germains, p. 104). For an exhaustive analysis of the theme of the mistilteinn, see Jonathan Z. Smith, "When the Bough Breaks," HR 12 (1973): 342-72, esp. pp. 350-70. Since S. Bugge, several scholars have found likenesses between Baldr and Christ; see Derolez, pp. 126 ff.; Turville-Petre, pp. 119 ff. For Dumezil, Baldr takes over the function ofTyr ("that degenerate Scandinavian Mithra"); see his Les dieux des Germains, p. 93.
For another god of the Aesir, Heimdallr, the documentation is fragmentary. He is the watchman of the gods and is endowed with clairvoyance; he was born of nine mothers. There is an enmity between Heimdallr and Loki, and at the end of the world they will kill each other. The sources for Heimdallr are analyzed by B. Pering, Heimdall (1941); cf. J. de Vries, Altgermanische Religion, vol. 2, pp. 238 ff.; de Vries, "Heimdallr, dieu enigma,tique," Etudes germaniques 10 (1955): 257-68. The book by Ake Ohlmarks, Heimdall und das Horn (Uppsala, 1937), should be consulted for its ample documentation; his naturalistic
explanation (Heimdall = the sun; the hom = the moon) is naive. Dumezil interprets Heimdallr as a "first god," analogous to Yayu and Janus; see his "Remarques comparatives sur Ie dieu scandinave Heimdallr," Etudes Celtiques 8 (1959): 263-83.

There is an extensive literature on Loki. The theories put forward up to 1931 have been examined by J. de Vries, The Problem of Loki, FFC no. 110 (Helsinki 1933), pp. 10-22; see also de Vries, Altgermanische Religion, vol. 2, pp. 255 ff. De Vries compares Loki to the' 'trickster," a characteristic figure of North American mythology. F. Strom, in Loki: Ein mythologisches Problem (Gothenburg, 1956), sees in this god a hypostasis of 60inn, his "foster brother." Using documents of Scandinavian folklore, A. B. Rooth concludes that the original figure of Loki was the spider (Locke in dialectal Swedish); see his Loki in Scandinavian Mythology (Lund, 1961). See also de Vries, "Loki ... und kein Ende," Festschriftfiir F. R. Schroder (Heidelberg, 1959), pp. 1 ff.; Alois Closs, "Loki und die germanische Frommigkeit," Kairos 2 (1960): 89-100. Georges Dumezil has treated the problem in an important book, Loki (1948), a second edition of which, considerably altered, appeared in German in 1959; see also his Les dieux des Germains, pp. 94 ff. Dumezil has adduced a Caucasian parallel to the drama that opposes Loki to Baldr: the wicked Syrdon succeeds in having the handsome hero Sozryko killed by a seemingly harmless stratagem; see Loki, pp. 169 ff. On the Scandinavian eschatological myth, the Danish scholar Axel Olrik has published a book that is extremely valuable for its abundant documentation: Ragnarok: Die Sagen vom Weltuntergang, trans. W. Ranisch (Berlin, 1922). According to Olrlk, the conception of the Ragnarok would have been influenced by certain Causasian myths and by Persian and Christian eschatologies. R. Reitzenstein attributed an important role to Manichaean influences; see his "Weltuntergangsvorstellungen" in KyrkohistoriskArsskrift 24 (1924): 129-212, and his "Die nordischen, persischen und christlichen Vorstellungen vom Weltunter

gang," in Vortriige der Bibliothek Warburg 1923-24 (Leipzig and Berlin, 1926): 149-69. But Dumezil has shown that what is really involved is the Indo-European eschatological myth documented in India (the Mahiibhiirata), in Iran, and in Scandinavian tradition; see his Les dieux des Germains, pp. 212 fT. Cf. Stig Wikander, "Germanische und indoiranische Eschatologie," Kairos 2 (1960): 83-88. On the Ragnarok, see also J. de Vries, Altgermanische Religion, vol. 2, pp. 397 fT.; J. S.

Ellis, The Road to Hel (Cambridge, 1943); and R. T. Christiansen, The Dead and the Living (1946). Pertinent observations on the initiation of warriors, the destiny of the hero, and the paganism-Christianity symbiosis will be found in a study by H. Margaret Arendt.

On the Gosforth cross, see K. Berg, "The Gosforth Cross," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 21 (1951): 27 fT. (excellent photographic reproductions). On Germanic royalty, Otto Hofler has published a suggestive and extremely learned book, Germanische Sakralkonigtum, vol. 1: Der Runenstein von Rok und die germanische Individualweihe (Tiibingen, 1953); see also his article in The Sacral Kingship (Leiden, 1959), pp. 664 fT. See the review by J. de Vries, in Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift 34 (1953): 183 fT., and our observations in Critique 83 (1954): 328 fT. The importance of the runic inscription on the Rok monument lies in the fact that its author, Varin, guardian of a sanctuary, "consecrates" his son not to a god-a custom well documented in Germanic traditions-but to a king, Theodoric, king ofthe Goths. Now Varin erects the monument in Sweden, but Theodoric had reigned in Italy, at Verona, several centuries earlier. "But," the text of the inscription states, Theodoric "still decides the fate of battles." He intervenes in battles fully armed, shield on shoulder, riding his charger. Theodoric was not only a king who, during his lifetime and after his death, had known glory and apotheosis; for the whole Germanic world he had become a mythical personage, and, under the name Diederich of Berne, he was still popular in the nineteenth century and even in the twentieth. These facts were well known. But the Rok inscription proves that it is no longer a matter of "literature" or folklore but of a living religious belief; in other words, when he erected his monument,

Varin petformed a ritual, which implied belief in the sacredness of the king.

179. The Geto-Dacians descend directly from the Thracians of the Bronze Age. They extended well beyond the present frontiers of Romania. Recent excavations have brought to light Geto-Dacian sites as far east as the Dniester, south as far as the Balkans, and north and west as far as Hungary, southeastern Slovakia, and Serbia. In the first century B.C., under King Boerebista, the Dacian state attained its greatest power. But the Romans, who had made their way into the Balkan Peninsula toward the end of the third century, reached the Danube in the days of Augustus. The second important Dacian king, Decebalus, successfully fought off the Romans under Domitian in 89 but was conquered by Trajan's legions in two bloody wars (101-2, 105-7) and committed suicide. Dacia was then transformed into a Roman province. From the ample bibliography on the protohistory and history of Dacia, we mention: Vasile !>arvan, Getica (Bucharest, 1926); !>arvan, Dacia: An Outline of the Early Civilization of the Carpatho-Danubian Countries (Cambridge, 1928; see also the Romanian translation of this work by Radu Vulpe, 4th ed. [Bucharest, 1967], containing important additions and critical bibliographies by the translator [pp. 159-216]); Hadrian Daicoviciu, Dacii (Bucharest, 1965); H. Daicoviciu, Dacia de fa Buerebista La cucerirea romand (Bucharest, 1972); R. Vulpe, A§ezdri getice in Muntenia (Bucharest, 1966); I. H. Cri§an, Burebista §i epoca sa (1975). On the expansion ofthe Thracians and the Geto-Dacians and their relations with the Scythians, see M. Dusek, "Die Thraker im Karpatenbecken," Slovenska Archaeologia 22 (1974): 361-428. According to Strabo (7. 3. 12), the Dacians were originally named daoi. A tradition preserved by Hesychius informs us that daos was the



Chapter 21. Celts, Germans, Thracians, Getae 481
Phrygian word for "wolf." Thus the early Dacians called themselves "wolves" or "those who -are like wolves." Now the wolf was the exemplary model of the warrior: imitation of the wolf's behavior and external appearance was characteristic of military initiations and of the secret warrior brotherhoods. See Eliade, "The Dacians and Wolves," in Zalmoxis, pp.5-20.
On the religious beliefs of the Geto-Dacians see I. I. Russu, "Religia Geto-Dacilor: Zei, credinte, practici religioase," Annuarul Institutului de Studii Clasice 5 (Cluj, 1947): 61-137, and the bibliography given in our Zalmoxis, p. 22, n. 1. On Gebeleizis, see Zalmoxis, pp. 51-55, and the bibliographies given in notes 87-97. Add: C. Poghirc, "Considerations philologiques et linguistiques sur Gebeleizis," Academia Litterarum Bulgarica, vol. 2: Thracia (Serdicae, 1974), pp. 357-60. The author proposes (p. 359) to read this divine name as *Nebeleizis, the first part of which is close to Greek nephele, Lat. nebula, Anglo-Saxon nifol, meaning "cloud, stormy sky," while the second part means "god." On Zalmoxis, see the bibliography given in our Zalmoxis, p. 22, n. 1. See ibid., pp. 24 ff., for the analysis of the mythico-ritual scenario that can be detected in Herodotus 4. 94-96. On the Greek ecstatics, thaumaturges, and "shaman-philosophers," with whom numerous scholars have compared Zalmoxis, see Zalmoxis, pp.34-42. From Jakob Grimm to Neckel and Jan de Vries, some Germanists have compared the theme of Zalmoxis' occultation with the death of Freyr, god of fertility, but the comparison is not necessarily valid; see Zalmoxis, pp. 47-48.
Hippolytus (Philosophoumena 2. 25) reports a legend according to which Zalmoxis would have propagated the Pythagorean doctrine among the Celts, which once again proves the importance attributed to the tradition that defined the religion of Zalmoxis by belief in the immortality of the soul. H. Hubert has compared Druidism with the Thracian and Geto-Dacian brotherhoods; see his Les Celtes depuis l'epoque de la Tene, p. 283. It is above all the importance of the high priest, the belief iIi immortality, and a sacred science of the Druidic initiatory type that suggest Geto-Dacian parallels. Moreover, certain Celtic influences must be considered, since the Celts inhabited the western parts of Dacia for some time; see Parvan, Getica, pp. 461 ff.; Parvan, Dacia, Civilizaliile antice din larile carpato-danubiene, 4th ed.

Ziegler, "Orphische Dichtung," in the PaulyWissowa Realencyklopadie, vol. 28 (1942), cols. 1321-1417. A complete bibliography of modern works down to 1922 was compiled by Kern for his Orphicorum Fragmenta (pp. 345 ff.); this was updated to 1941 by Martin P. Nilsson in "Early Orphism and Kindred Religious Movements," Opuscula Selecta, vol. 2 (Lund, 1952), note 1, pp. 628-30 (this article is an enlarged version of an article published in HTR 28 [1935]: 181-230).

Orpheus' Thracian origin, already maintained by Strabo and Plutarch, has been adopted again by E. Rohde (Psyche), by E. Mass (Orpheus), and by P. Perdrizet (Cultes et mythes du Pangee, 1910). But A. Boulanger has discerningly observed that "the most characteristic features of Orphism-consciousness of sin, need of purification and redemption, infernal punishments-have never been found among the Thracians" (Orphee, p. 47, n. 1). See also R. Bohme, in Annales Univ. Saraviensis 6 (1956): 3 ff. A.

In his book Die Trennung von Himmel und Erde: Ein vorgriechischer Schiipfungsmythos bei Hesiod und den Orphiker (Tiibingen, 1942; reprinted, Darmstadt, 1968), pp. 85 ff., Willibald Staudacher distinguishes two original Orphic cosmogonies, the first based on the motif of Night (Eudemus and Plato, Timaeus 40c and 41a), the other on the theme of the primordial Egg (Aristophanes, The Birds 650-731; also Hieronymus and Hellanicus); these two traditions were amalgamated in the cosmogony of the Orphic Rhapsodies. The Derveni Papyrus, discovered in 1962, has revealed an independent theory, glorifying the cosmogonic power and absolute sovereignty of Zeus. This papyrus has been edited by S. C. Kapsomenos and translated into German by Walter Burkert in "Orpheus und die Vorsokratiker: Bemerkungen zum Derveni-Papyrus und zum pythagoreischen Zahlenlehre," Antike und Abendland 13 (1967): 93-114 (translation, pp. 94-96), and by R.

Epigraphik 1 (1967): 23-30. An English translation, with commentary, has been provided by Alderinck in Crisis and Cosmogony, chap. 6. On the myths of the Titans struck by Zeus's thunderbolts, see § 124 in vol. 1 of the present work. The birth of men from the Titans' ashes has given rise to countless controversies. Nilsson (Geschichte der griechischen Religion, vol. 1, pp. 686 ff.) accepts the antiquity of the myth; on the other hand, Linforth (Arts, p. 331) holds that we have no convincing element to determine the age of the tradition. Moulinier's hypercriticism (Orphee, pp. 44 ff.) arrives at a completely negative result: "It is Plutarch who first ... saw that the myth of the Titans devouring Dionysus refers to our own birth: men who eat flesh will be punished as they were" (p. 59, referring to De esu carne 996e, Kern, Orph. Frag., no. 210, p. 231). On the other hand, Dodds says that, taking into account all references to the myth, "I find it hard to resist the conclusion that the complete story was known to Plato and his public" (The Greeks and the Irrational, p. 156; cf. p. 176, notes 132 and 135). Dodds allows a certain importance to Xenocrates' testimony. For discussion of this passage, see P. Boyance, "Xenocrates and the Orphics," Rev. des etudes anciennes 50 (1948): 218-25. J. C. G. Strachan ("Who Did Forbid Suicide at Phaedo 62b?" Classical Quarterly n.s. 20 [1970]: 216-20) derives Xenocrates' fragment from an Orphic source. In any case, Olympiodorus states that Plato's work "is filled with echoes of the writings of Orpheus" (ad Phaed. 70c; Kern, Orph. Frag., no. 224). See also H. Jeanmaire, Dionysos, pp. 391 ff. Ugo Bianchi interprets the myth of Zagreus and the passage in Plato's Laws 701c-d on "the old nature of the Titans" as an "antecedent sin," committed by superhuman beings in a time preceding human existence; see his "Peche originel et pecht! antecedent," RHR 170 (1966): 118 ff.

"An exile by the will of the gods and a wanderer"-so Empedocles presented himself. "For already have I once been a boy and a girl, and a bush and a bird, and a sea fish" (Purifications, frag. 117). Speaking of Pythagoras, Empedocles described him as "a man knowing an extraordinary number of things," for, "when he reached out with all his thoughts, he would see easily every one of all the things that are in the ten, or even twenty, lifetimes that one lived as a man" (ibid., frag. 129); cf. Ettore Bignone's commentary, Empedocle (Thrin, 1926), pp.

483 ff. The Indian yogins and t:~is remembered some of their previous
existences, but the Buddha alone knew them all. This is a way of saying that only the Buddha was omniscient; see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 180 ff. The fact that shamans also claim to remember their former existences indicates the archaism of the practice; see Eliade, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries: The Encounter between Contempor4ry Faiths and Archaic Realities, trans. Philip Mairet (New York, 1960), pp. 51-52. The essentials of the legend of Aristeas of Proconnesus are reported by Herodotus (4. 14). Left for dead in his city, he was met on the road to Cyzicus. Mter seven years he was said to have reappeared at Proconnesus, bringing with him an epic poem in which he narrated his adventures: "possessed by Phoebus," he traveled as far as to the Issidones, where he was told about their neighbors, the Arimaspes ("men who are said to have but one eye") and the Hyperboreans. He disappeared for the second time, but Herodotus adds that 240 years later he appeared in Metaponte, in southern Italy, and ordered the inhabitants to build an altar to Apollo and, beside the altar, to erect "a statue bearing the name of Aristeasof Proconnesus." He told them that in the form of a crow he had accompanied Apollo when the god once visited Metaponte. "This said, he disappeared." Let us note some distinctly shamanic features: ecstasy that can be confused with death, bilocation, appearance in the form of a crow. On Aristeas, see the bibliographies given in Eliade, Zalmoxis, the Vanishing God, trans. Willard R. Trask (Chicago, 1972), p. 37, n. 44, and Burkert, Lore and Science, pp. 147-49. J. D. P. Bolton, in his book Aristeas of Proconnesus (Oxford, 1962), presents a "historicistic" interpretation of the legend. Another legendary personage, Hermotimus of Clazomenae, had the power to leave his body for many years. During this long ecstasy he journeyed far, and on his return he predicted the future. But one day, when he was lying inanimate, his enemies burned his body, and his soul never returned after that (see Zalmoxis, p. 37, n. 45). Certain "shamanic" features can be identified in the legends of Epimenides of Crete, of Phormion, and of Leonymus (see Zalmoxis, pp. 37-38; Burkert, Lore and Science, p. 152). Some scholars have added the names of Parmenides and Empedocles. H. Diels had already compared Parmenides' mystical journey, described in his poem, to the ecstatic journeys of Siberian shamans; the subject was taken up again, with various arguments, by Meuli, Morrison, Burkert, and Guthrie (see Zalmoxis, p. 38 and notes 48-50). As for Empedocles, Dodds writes that his fragments represent "the one first-hand source from which we can still form some notion of what a Greek shaman was really like" (The Greeks and the Irrational, p. 145). This interpretation has been

rejected by Charles H. Kahn: "Empedocles' soul does not leave his body like that of Hermotimus and Epimenides. He does not ride on an arrow like Abaris or appear in the form of a raven like Aristeas. He is never seen in two places at the same time, and does not even descend to the underworld like Orpheus and Pythagoras" ("Religion and Natural Philosophy in Empedocles' Doctrine of the Soul," Archiv fur Geschichte der Philosophie 42 [1962]: 3-35, esp. pp. 30 ff.). However, Empedocles is known for certain magical powers: he can control storms and bring rains (frag. 111; see other references in Burkert, Lore and Science, pp. 153-54). This practice is characteristic ofThrkish, Mongol, and Icelandic shamans; see John Andrew Boyle, "Thrkish and Mongol Shamanism in the Middle Ages," Folklore 83 (1972): 184 ff.; Stefan Einarsson, "Harp Song, Heroic Poetry ... ," Budklavlen 42 (1965): 25-26. We add that this is a practice that goes beyond the sphere of shamanism stricto sensu.
For Pythagorean "shamanism," see Burkert, pp. 120 ff. (with an ample bibliography); J. A. Philip, Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism (Toronto, 1966), pp. 159 ff.; M. Detienne, La notion de Daimon dans le pythagorisme ancien (Paris, 1963), pp. 60 ff.

166 ff., 192 ff. See also M. Detienne, "Des confreries de guerriers a la societe pythagoricienne," RHR 163 (1963): 127-31. The existence of an Orphic "sect" or of Orphic conventicles, accepted by Guthrie, Orpheus, pp. 203 ff., and by Cumont, Lux Perpetua, pp. 240, 244, 405-6, has been disputed by'Festugiere (in agreement with Gruppe and Wilamowitz) in his study "L'Orphisme et la legende de Zagreus," Revue Biblique 44 (1935): 366-96. Yet we may compare the Orphic "secret groups" to the no less secret associations of Tantric adepts.

On beliefs in celestial immortality, the ancient sources and modern critical studies have been admirably analyzed by Walter Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, pp. 358 ff. Louis Rougier's interpretation, L'Origine astronomique de la croyance pythagoricienne en l'immortalite celeste des ames (Cairo, 1935), according to which the origin of the idea is not to be sought in religious imagination but in "Pythagoras' astronomical revolution" (pp. 21 f.), is critically examined and rejected by Burkert, Lore and Science, p. 358, n. 41. On the similarities between the philosophies ofPythagoras and Plato, see Burkert, pp. 43 ff., 53 ff., 81 ff. On the Timaeus interpreted as a Pythagorean document, see ibid., pp. 64 ff., 84 ff. The possible Oriental influences on Plato are discussed by Joseph Bidez, Eos, ou Platon et l'Orient (Brussels, 1945), chaps. 5 and 9, and by Julia Kerschensteiner, Platon und der Orient (Stuttgart, 1945), pp. 147 ff., who argues against them. We observed above (p. 201 and n. 46) the analogy between one of Plato's images ("the wings of the soul") and Indian thought. We add that, for Plato, as for Sfupkhya-Yoga and Vedanta, the so-called "virtues" lose their value beside the supreme faculty of the soul, which is to contemplate the Eternal (Rep. bk. IV, 428 ff.). The duty of the perfect sage is to perfect his inner life in order to gain liberation. The highest knowing, applied to true Being, leads to liberation; to know God is to become divine. We must point out a rather unexpected parallel to anamnesis. Like Plato (Meno 81), the Australian Aranda also believe that to know is to remember. During his initiation the novice learns the myths that narrate the activities of the totemic ancestors, who lived at the beginning of time. He next learns that he himself is the reincarnation of one of these ancestors. In the mythology of a particular hero he discovers his own fabulous biography, his exploits during the primordial period. Certain material objects (rocks, tjurungas, etc.) are proofs of his earlier and glorious existence on earth. (For Plato, too, external objects help the soul to recover the knowledge that it possessed during its supraterrestrial- existence.) Among the Aranda the supreme initiatory act consists in the revelation, by the novice's father, of the mystical identity between the young man and the sacred object (tjurunga). "Young man, see this object. This is your own body. This is the tjilpa ancestor you were when you used to wander about in your previous existence. Then you sank down to rest in the sacred cave nearby" (T. G. H. Strehlow,

quoted in Eliade, Australian Religions: An Introduction [Ithaca, N.Y., 1973], pp. 98-99). On another occasion we outlined the process of erosion of Greek myths (Myth and Reality, pp. 152 ff.). We quote some fragments from Xenophanes (born ca. 565): "Homer and Hesiod say that the gods do all manner of things which men would consider disgraceful: adultery, stealing, deceiving each other." He cleverly criticizes the anthropomorphism of the gods: "If cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as each had themselves." Yet the mythology of Homer and Hesiod continued to interest the scholars of the whole Hellenistic world. But the myths were no longer accepted literally: now "hidden meanings," "undermeanings" (hyponoiai; the term allegoria was used later) were sought in them. By means of the allegorical method, developed especially by the Stoics, Homer and Hesiod were "saved" in the eyes of the Greek elites, and the Homeric gods were able to retain a high cultural value. Anothel" method, euhemerism, contributed to saving the Homeric pantheon and mythology. At the beginning of the third century B.C. Euhemerus published a romance in the form of a philosophical journey, Hiera anagraphe (Sacred History), whose success was immediate and considerable. Euhemerus believed that he had discovered the origin of the gods: they were ancient kings who had been deified. This offered another "rational" possibility of preserving Homer's gods. They now had a "reality": it was historical (more precisely, prehistoric) in nature; the myths represented a confused memory, or a memory transfigured by imagination, of the deeds of the primitive kings. It is important to add that the "mythology of the soul" articulated by Plato has never lost its power of attraction. But the allegorical interpretation of certain Platonic myths has been of interest only to scholars.

Schneider distinguishes four periods in the history of Hellenistic civilization: (1) until ca. 280 B.C., a time characterized by the appearance of the first Hellenistic universal god, Sarapis, and by the beginnings of the cult of the great gods, worshiped as protectors of dynasties,etc.; (2) the time between ca. 280 and ca. 220, the most brilliant period of Hellenism; (3) the time of eschatological tensions and uneasiness (ca. 220-168), characterized by the rise of apocalyptic literature, of Egyptian and Asiatic mysteriosophic cults, and of Dionysianism; (4) the Roman conquest, from ca. 168 to ca. 30, a time during which many temples were destroyed or pillaged and their priests were deported, etc., but the Hellenistic religious traditions survived in the initiatory centers: Eleusis, Samothrace, Andania, Delos (pp. 770-72); see also the final synthesis (pp. 963-88).

Civ., p. 326). The texts have been edited by H. von Arnim, Stoicorum veterum fragmenta, 4 vols. (1903-5, 1924; republished, Stuttgart, 1968); Italian translation by N. Festa, Frammenti degli Stoici antichi (1932-35; republished, Hildesheim, 1971), and by R. Anastasi, I Frammenti morali di Crisippo (Padua, 1962); French translation by E. Brehier, Les Stoi'ciens (Paris, 1962); see also the German translation by M. Pohlenz, Stoa und Stoiker (Zurich, 1950). The fundamental work remains the one by M. Pohlenz, Die Stoa, 2 vols. (Gottingen, 1948-49; 2d ed., 1964; Italian translation, Florence, 1967). See also J. M. Rist, Stoic Philosophy (Cambridge, 1969); C. Rodis-Lewis, La morale stoi'cienne (Paris, 1970); R. Hoven, Stoi'cisme et stoi'ciens face au probLeme de l'au-deLa (Paris, 1971); and the bibliographies listed by Leon Robin, La pensee grecque et les origines de l'esprit scientifique (new ed., 1973), pp. 477-78, and by P. M. Schuhl, ibid., pp. 501-3. Epicurus' fragments have been collected by Hermann Usener, Epicurea (1887; republished Rome, 1963). See also C. Arrighetti, Epicuro: Opere (original texts and Italian translations) (Thrin, 1960). From the extensive critical literature it is important for our purpose to cite the work by A. J. Festugiere, Epicure et ses dieux (1946; 2d ed., 1968). On the Cynics, see the essential bibliography in L. Robin, La pensee grecque, pp. 464-65. In the Hellenistic period the philosophy of Aristotle enjoyed chiefly a scientific reputation, but in the Middle Ages it will have considerable influence on the Christian, Islamic, and Jewish theologies. Aristotle's metaphysics is also reminiscent of Sfupkhya-Yoga. Man is made up of



Chapter 22. Orpheus and Pythagoras 493
the body (soma), the soul (psyche), and the mind (nous), that "whereby the soul thinks and judges" (De anima 429a23). The mind exists from all eternity and it "must come into a being in the male from outside" (De generatione animalium 736b20). The mind is transcendent to man's living organism, which it directs while remaining inaccessible to psychic influences: it is "something more divine and is unaffected" (De anima 408b~9). In fact, the n.ous resembles God, who is, for Aristotle, the absolute, unconditioned, eternal reality; being "motionless," God's activity is purely spiritual (Eth. Nic. 1178b7-22; De caelo, 292b4 ff.). Similarly, the mind's only activity consists in thinking. The human personality is not determined by the mind. Undifferentiated and equal to itself, the mind has no relation with the personalities to which it is attributed. Having no birth, it does not experience death (De caelo 279b20). When death comes, the nous recovers its previous condition. But it is impossible for us to know, or even to imagine, the modality of this disincarnate existence, for the mind has neither any rational activity nor any memory; the predicate that can be attributed to it is that of being (De anima 408b18 ff.). Consequently, in the beyond, man cannot feel a desire to liberate himself, and belief in immortality no longer makes sense. It is precisely this part of Aristotle's doctrine that gave rise to countless controversies in the Middle Ages. We will once again emphasize the analogies with, on the one hand, the speculations of the Upanishads and Vedanta on the nature of the titman and, on the other hand, the structure and destiny of the puru~a in Srupkhya-Yoga (see §141). However, there is a capital difference between Aristotle's doctrine and the Indian metaphysical systems; for the latter, the deliverance of the spirit (titman, puru~a) implies both consciousness of self and bliss (cf. sticcitantinda). On Alexander and India, see H. G. Rawlinson, Intercourse between India and the Western World, 2d ed. (New York, 1972); A. K. Narain, "Alexander and India," Greece and Rome 12 (1965): 155-65; F. F.

185. There is an extensive bibliography on Buddhism and the history of the Buddhist sects. The essential works are listed in the following volumes: three works by L. de la Vallee-Poussin, Le dogme et la philosophie du Bouddhisme (Paris, 1930), NirviifJa (1925), and La morale bouddhique (1927); two works by E. Conze, Buddhism: Its Essence and Development (Oxford, 1951), and Buddhist Thought in India (London, 1962); Sukumar Dutt, The Buddha and Five After Centuries (London, 1957); E.

On the literature of the Siitras in the Pali language, see the account by J. Filliozat in L. Renou and J. Filliozat, L'Inde classique (1949), vol. 2, pp. 323-51; A. Bareau, "Le Bouddhisme Indien," pp. 30-40. On the formation of the canon, see Lamotte, Histoire, vol. 1, pp. 155-209. At the Council at Rajagrha, the two collections oftexts-Sutra Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka-were recited in chorus by all the participants. According to some traditions, the Abhidharma Pitaka, the "Basket of the Supreme Doctrine" (or "Quintessence of the Doctrine") was recited in the same way, so that the complete canon, the Tripitaka, was already organized at that period; but this is improbable (see Bareau, "Le Bouddhisme Indien," p. 27). On the importance of Sariputra, see A. Migot, "Un grand disciple du Bouddha, Sariputra," BEFEO 46 (1954): 405-54.

Przyluski's work, La /egende de l'empereur Asoka dans les textes indiens et chinois (Paris, 1923), is still useful for its excellent translation of the texts. Filliozat has this to say: "At the height of his power, Asoka was the greatest prince of his times. Neither the Rome of the middle of the third century B.C. nor the Egypt of the Ptolemies attained the greatness and power of the Indian empire; the Seleucid kingdom yields to pressure from the Parthians, China is still struggling against the Ch'in dynasty that is to give it its unity. If Asoka remained

unknown to all these peoples despite the efforts he made in the direction of the West, it is because in his time none of them could or would see anything but itself in history.

John Irwin has shown that Asoka's pillars carry on a long religious tradition, dominated by a cosmological symbolism comparable to that of Mesopotamia; see his" 'Asokan' Pillars: A Reassessment of the Evidence," Burlington Magazine 65 (1973): 70fr20; 66 (1974): 712-27; 67 (1975): 631-43.

On the analogies between representations of the Buddha and of Christ in the first to fifth centuries, see Benjamin Rowland, "Religious Art East and West," HR 2 (1962): 11-32. According to Rowland, it is a matter of the common inheritance of a symbolism that goes back to a far earlier period. Christ and the Buddha are presented as primarily teachers (inheriting the Greek orator's toga), or they are endowed with solar symbolism and with gigantic proportions, in order to show their transcendental nature. See also Rowland's "Buddha and the Sun God," Zalmoxis 1 (1938): 69-84. On monastic life, see Nalinaksha Dutt, Early Monastic Buddhism, rev. ed.

It must be noted, however, that the Abhidharma set out not to encourage speculation but to clarify the mind by the help of a consistent philosophical theory. Its ultimate purpose, then, was soteriological.

498 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
On the Mahayana, see E. Conze, Buddhist Thought in India (London, 1962), pp. 195-237; A. Bareau, "Le Bouddhisme Indien," in Les religions de I'Inde, vol. 3, pp. 141-99; Bareau, L'Absolu en philosophie bouddhique (Pcu1s, 1951); E. Lamotte, "Sur la formation du Mahayana," Festschrift Friedrich Weller (Leipzig, 1954), pp. 377-96. The most important translations of Mahayana texts into European languages are listed by A. Bareau, "Le Bouddhisme Indien," pp. 242-43. According to Mahayana tradition, after the death of the Blessed One the disciples met at Rajagrha under the leadership of Mahaklisyapa and compiled the' 'Three Baskets"; during this time the great boddhisattvas ascended Mount Vimalasvabhava and, with the help of Ananda, compiled the Mahayana Siitras. These were deposited in hiding places among the Devas, the Nagas, and the Gandharvas. It was not until five hundred years after the parinirviilJa, when the Law was in decline, that NagliIjuna found, in the Nagas' palace, seven baskets filled with Mahayana Siitras. In ninety days he memorized them and began communicating them to laymen. On this fabulous tradition, see Lamotte, L'Enseignement de Vimalakirti, pp. 67-68.
On the boddhisattva, see, most recently, W. Rahula, "L'Ideal du Bodhisattva dans Ie Theravada et Ie Mahayana," JA 259 (1971): 63-70. In the first centuries of our era, the Mahayana authors speak of sriivakas, pratyekabuddhas, and boddhisattvas. A sriivaka (literally, "disciple") practices the Buddha's teaching and finally attains nirviilJa; a pratyekabuddha (individual Buddha) realizes nirviil].a himself but is not able to reveal the truth to others, as a fully awakened Buddha does. A boddhisattva is a person who is capable of attaining nirviil].a but who renounces it for the good of others (Rahula, pp. 65-66). There are analyses of the various boddhisattvas in E. Conze, Le bouddhisme, pp. 123 ff.; A. Bareau, "Le Bouddhisme Indien," pp. 169 ff.; J. Rahder, Dasabhilmikasutra et Boddhisattvabhilmi (Paris, 1962); L. de la Vallee-Poussin, Vijnaptimiitratiisiddhi, vol. 1, pp. 721-42; and especially the translation (with full commentary) by Etienne Lamotte, L'Enseignement de Vimalakirti.

elements in Avalokitesvara;see the discussion in H. de Lubac, Amida, pp. 237 ff. But the Indian antecedents are not lacking; see J. Filliozat's remarks in JA 239 (1951): 81 and RHR 137 (1950): 44-58. On AmiHibha and Sukhavati, see de Lubac, Amida, pp. 32-48, 78-119, and passim. The article by P. Demieville cited in note 13, "Version chinoise ... ," appeared in BEFEO 24 (1924), and in an offprint of 258 pages. None of the other Buddhas has the greatness and efficacity of Amitabha. Later, all these Buddhas and boddhisattvas are described as accompanied by gods, especially Brahma and Indra, and by various feminine personifications of Prajfiaparamita or of the Taras (goddesses whose name means "Star" and "Savior" [fern.]). This new Buddhology continues the pre-Mahayanist theories of the supramundane nature of the Buddhas. It seems to have been definitely constituted by ASaI}.ga in the fourth century; see Vijiiaptimatratasiddhi, trans. L. de la ValleePoussin, vol. 2, pp. 762-813; Paul Demieville, ed., Hobogirin: Dictionnaire encyclopedique du Bouddhisme d' apres les sources chinoises et japonaises (Tokyo, 1929), fasc. 2, pp. 174-85. The "Buddha fields" (buddha k~etras) are the countless universes in which the compassion of a Buddha is manifested. Pure, impure, and mixed universes are distinguished. Our universe, Saha, is presented as dangerous and wretched, yet it is there that Sakyamuni attained perfect enlightenment. But, "pure or impure, the buddha-k~etras are all 'Buddha lands' and, as such, perfectly pure. The distinction between pure and impure fields is wholly subjective. The Buddhas transform an impure land into a pure land and vice versa at will" (Lamotte, L'Enseignement, p. 399). See also the article Butsudu in Hobogirin, pp. 198-203. The cult of Buddhas and boddhisattvas includes various kinds of homage and praise, an effort to think of them continually, requests to be reborn one day as a perfect Buddha, but, most of all, repetition of their names, a method that became very popular in India and in all the countries to which the Mahayana spread. The doctors have discussed the respective virtues of these two methods: faith in a Buddha and ritual repetition of his name. As matter of fact, these two Mahayanist innovations have a long prehistory in India, and, in their "popular" guise, conceal strictly enunciated ideas of the effectiveness of sacred words and "thoughts of compassion." See also Frank E. Reynolds, "The Several Bodies ofthe Buddha: Reflections on a Neglected Aspect of Theravada Tradition," HR 16 (1977): 374-89.

189. On Nagrujuna and Miidhyamika, see the bibliographies in Frederick J. Streng, Emptiness: A Study in Religious Meaning (Nashville, 1967), pp. 237-45. On Nagrujuna's life, see ibid., pp. 237-38, and the bibliography listed by E. Lamotte in the Introduction to his Le Traite de la grande vertu de sagesse de Nagiirjuna (Mahaprajnaparamitasastra), 2 vols. (Louvain, 1944, 1949), vol. 1, pp. xi-xiv. Lamotte has shown that, for Kumarajiva and his school, Nagarjuna falls between 243 and 300 A.D. (L'Enseignement de Vimalakfrti, p. 76). On Nagarjuna's works and the works that have been attributed to him, see Streng, Emptiness, pp. 238-40. The Mulamadhyamaka Karikii and Vigrahavyartanf are translated by Streng, pp. 181-227; Lamotte's Traite contains a translation of chapters 1-30 of the Chinese version by Kumarajiva. Probably the work contains supplements added by Kumarajiva. Translations of other works into European languages are listed by Streng, pp. 238-40. The text of the Madhyamika Karikii is included in the Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese commentaries on the work. The commentary by Candrakirti (Prasannapada) is by far the most valuable. The twenty-seven chapters of the Prasannapada have been translated into German, English, and French by various authors (Stcherbatsky, S. Schayer, E. Lamotte, J. de Jong, and J. May; see Streng, p. 240). J. May, Candrakfrtf Prasannapadii Miidhyamakavrtti: Douze chapitres traduits du sanskrit et du tibetain (Paris, 1959), deserves special mention.

191. The text of the Mahiibhiirata is now accessible in the critical edition published under the editorship of Vishnu S. Sukthamkar and S. K. Belvalkar: The Mahiibhiirata: For the First Time Critically Edited (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1933-66). The English translations by P. C. Roy (Calcutta, 1882-89) and by M. N.Dutt (Calcutta, 1895-1905) are still useful, but now the reader should consult the version begun by the late J. A. B. van Buitenen. Before his recent death, van Buitenen had translated books 1 through 5 of the Mahiibhiirata (University of Chicago Press, 1973-78), and he had cOmpleted his translation of the Bhagavad Gilii (now published; see below, § 194). For the history of interpretations of the poem, see Alf Hiltebeitel, Kr~T)a and the Mahiibhiirata: A Study in Indian and Indo-European Symbolism (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1973), pp. 134-90. Among the most important contributions, we mention those of Adolf Holtzmann (the younger), Das Mahiibhiirata und seine Theile, 4 vols. (Kiel, 1892-93); E. W. Hopkins, The Great Epic ofIndia: Its Character and Origin (1901); Joseph Dahlmann, Die Genesis des Mahiibhiirata (Berlin, 1899); G. J. Held, The Mahiibhiirata: An Ethnological Study (London and Amsterdam, 1935); V. S. Sukkhamkar, The Meaning of the Mahiibhiirata (Bombay, 1957); Georges Dumezil, Mythe et epopee, vols. 1 and 2 (Paris, 1968, 1971); Alf Hiltebeitel, The Ritual ofBattle: Krishna in the Mahiibhiirata (Ithaca, N.Y., 1976). J. Bruce Long has recently published an annotated bibliography, The Mahiibhiirata: A Select Annotated Bibliography, South Asia Occasional Papers and Theses, no. 3 (Cornell University) (Ithaca, N.Y., 1974). In 1947 Stig Wikander showed in an article (in Swedish) that the gods who were the fathers of the Pfu}.4avas formed a well-structured Vedic or pre-Vedic group and that the heroes' collective marriage corresponds to a theologem related to the same divine grouping. The article-"La legende des Pal}4ava et la substructure mythique du Mahabharata"-was translated and annotated by Georges Dumezil in Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, vol. 4 (Paris, 1948), pp. 37-53, 55-85. Now see Dumezil, Mythe et epopee, vol. 1, pp. 42 ff. (The first part of the book-pages 31-257-is devoted to an analysis of the MBh from the viewpoint of Indo-European mythology.)

In one of his interminable didactic discourses Bhi~ma affirms that "Sarpkhya and Yoga each praises its method as the best means (kiiral')a) .... I consider both these teachings true.... They have in common purity, suppression [of desires], and compassion for all beings; ... but the opinions [darsanas] are not the same in Sarpkhya and in
Yoga" (MBh 13. 11043 ff.). To be sure, the reference is to a presystematic stage of the two darsanas. Sarpkhya is not presented as the method for distinguishing and separating the spirit (puru~a) from psychomental experience, which is the point of departure for Isvara Kf~l}a's system.

Chapter 25. The Ordeals of Judaism
196. The history of the Jewish people after the Exile has inspired many studies. We mention some recent works: K. Galling, Studien zur Geschichte Israels im persischen Zeitalter (TUbingen, 1964); E. Bickerman, From Ezra to the Last ofthe Maccabees: Foundations ofPostBiblical Judaism (New York, 1962); I. L. Myres, "Persia, Greece and Israel," Palestine Exploration Quarterly 85 (1953): 8-22. For a general view of the religious history, see Georg Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion (Nashville and New York, 1972), pp. 33~90. On Deutero-Isaiah, see, most recently, the extremely valuable book by P. E. Bonnard, Le Second Isafe, son disciple et leurs editeurs (!safe
40-66) (Paris, 1972). Iranian influences have been identified in certain passages of Deutero-Isaiah. Thus, for example, Is. 50: 11 speaks of those who are "setting light to a fire," an expression equivalent to the Avestan term athravan. See the bibliography in David Winston, "The Iranian Component in the Bible, Apocrypha, and Qumran," HR 5 (1966): 187, n. 13. Still more obvious is the Iranian influence in chapters 44 and 45, whose resemblance to the "Cylinders of Cyrus" and to Yasna 44 has been'observed; see Morton Smith, "II Isaiah and the Persians," JAOS 83-84 (1963): 415-21, and the bibliography cited by Winston, p. 189, n.17. On the Songs of the Servant, see I. Engnell, "The <Ebed Yahweh Songs and the Suffering Messiah in 'Deutero-Isaiah,' " BJRL 31 (1948): 54-96; C.

Michaeli, Les livres des Chroniques, d'Esdras et de Nehemie (NeucMtel, 1967). According to Kellermann, foilowed by Morton Smith, Ezra preceded Nehemiah; see U. Kellermann, Nehemiah: Quellen, Uberlieferung und Geschichte, supplement 102 to Zeitschriftfur die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft (Berlin, 1967); "Erwagungen zum Problem der Esradatierung," Zeitschr.furdie alttest.

Eissfeldt, The OLd Testament, pp. 541-59. During Ezra's and Nehemiah's mission the opposition takes shape between the "parties" of the exc1usivists (or "nationalists") and the syncretists (or "universalists"). To be sure, the opposition existed before the Captivity, but it acquires a political character in the period of Ezra and Nehemiah. The short Book of Jonah, composed in the fourth century, admirably illustrates the "universalist" tendency: God sends the prophet to Nineveh to announce that the city will be destroyed because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. But since the Ninevites repent, Yahweh renounces punishing them. In other words, Yahweh cares for all peopLes. (Some authors have seen the same spirit in the Book of Ruth.) But the denomination "universalist" could equally well be applied to the partisans of assimilation (religious, cultural, racial). This syncretistic tendency, which was already popular at the time of the monarchy, will reach its height in the HellenIstic period.

The problem was brilliantly treated in the learned work by Martin Hengel, Judentum und Hellenismus (1968; 2d ed., Tiibingen, 1973); we cite the English translation by John Bowden, Judaism and Hellenism: Studies in Their Encounter in Palestine during the Early Hellenistic Period, 2 vols.

For the historical analysis of the text, see Eissfeldt, The Old Testament, pp. 491-99. On Ben Sirach, see the annotated translation by G. H. Box and
W. o. E. Oesterley in R. H. Charles, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1913), vol. 1, 268-517. For historical analysis of the text, with an extensive bibliography, see Eissfeldt, The Old Testament, pp. 595-99. Our interpretation is much indebted to Martin Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism, vol. 1, pp. 130--55; vol. 2, pp. 88-96. Ben Sirach's approach presents certain analogies with Stoic conceptions; first, the certainty that the world and human existence develop according to a plan determined by God (see § 184). In addition, Sirach shares with Stoicism the idea that the cosmos is infused with a rational power, which is, precisely, the divinity; see M. Pohlenz, Die Stoa, 2d ed. (Gottingen, 1964), vol. 1, p. 72. Then, too, Zeno's philosophy comes out of a Semitic religious vision that has much in common with the thought of the Old Testament (see ibid., p. 108). Thus the assimilation of Stoic ideas by the Jews, from Ben Sirach and Aristobulus to Philo, was in fact a return to an Oriental heritage (see Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism, vol. 1, pp. 149, 162). However, the importance of Greek influences must not be exaggerated. The parallels between the celebrated chapter 24 of Ben Sirach and the aretalogies of Isis have long been recognized. W. L. Knox observed "a startling affinity [ofthe personified Wisdom] to a Syrian Astarte with the features of Isis" ("The Divine Wisdom," Journal of Theological Studies 38 [1937]: 230--37; the passage quoted occurs on p. 235).

ligious Past, pp. 230-43; and Hengel, vol. 1, pp. 158 ff.; vol. 2, pp. 101 ff. (supplementary bibliography in n. 331). It is not impossible that the cult of Isis was known in Jerusalem in the third century and that the Jewish schools of Wisdom transferred the aretalogy of Isis-Astarte to divine Wisdom; see Hengel, vol. 1, p. 258. But, as we have already observed (p. 258), Wisdom is not the paredros (associate) of God but comes out of his mouth. See W. Schencke, Die Chokma (Sophia) in der jiidischen Hypostasenspekulation,' J. Fichtner, Die altorientalische Weisheit in ihrer israelitisch-jiidischen Auspriigung; Fichtner, "Zum Problem Glaube und Geschichte in der israelitisch-jiidischen Weisheitsliteratur," Theologische Literaturzeitung 76 (1951): 145-50; J. M. Reese, Hellenistic Influence on the Book of Wisdom and Its Consequences (Rome, 1970); B. L. Mack, Logos und Sophia: Untersuchungen zur Weisheitstheologie im hellenistischen Judentum (Gottingen; 1973). It is important to note that, between the third century B.C. and the second century of our era, similar conceptions are documented not only in the Oriental-Hellenistic world but also in Buddhist and Hindu India; we witness the religious and mythological personification of "knowledge" (prajiia,jiiiina) as the supreme means ofliberation. The process will continue in the Middle Ages, both in India and in Christian Europe (see vol. 3). The grandiose undertaking of the translation of the Pentateuch, an enterprise unequaled in antiquity, had provided the possibility for a Jewish literature composed directly in Greek, and in ca. 175-70, Aristobulus, the first Jewish "philosopher," wrote a didactic and apologetic work addressed to the young sovereign Ptolemy VI Philometor. To judge from the fragments of it that have been preserved, the author propounded a daring theory, which was to be frequently restated later: Jewish doctrine, as formulated in the Bible, represents the one true philosophy; Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato were acquainted with it and borrowed its principles; when the Greek poets and philosophers speak of "Zeus," they are referring to the true God. "For all philosophers agree that, concerning God, we ought to hold pious opinions, and to this, especially, our system gives excellent exhortation" (quoted by Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica 13. 12. 7 f.). However, the wisdom of Moses is proclaimed to be definitely superior to Greek philosophical doctrines because it is of divine origin; see Hengel, vol. 1, pp. 163 ff., and the references he cites in vol. 2, pp. 106-10, notes 375-406.



Chapter 25. The Ordeals of Judaism 509
Soon afterward, the author of the Letter ofAristeas still more clearly expresses the tendency to assimilate the biblical idea of God to the Greek (i.e., "universalist") conception of the divinity. The Greeks and the Jews "worship the same God-the Lord and Creator of the Universe ... , though we call him by different names, such as Zeus or Dis" (Arist. 15-16). Greeks learned in philosophy were held to have long professed monotheism. In conclusion, the author considers Judaism identical with Greek philosophy. See the English translation and the commentary by M. Hadas, Aristeas to Phi/ocrates: Jewish Apocryphal Literature (New York, 1951), and the edition by A. Pelletier,

For the persecutions by Antiochus and the war of liberation, see the sources cited in note 31. In the last analysis, the "reform" that Antiochus sought-inspired by the philhellenes-aimed at transforming Jerusalem into a Greek polis; see Hengel, vo1. 1, p. 278.

Hengel, vo1. 1, 261 ff.; add Marcel Simon, "Jupiter-Yahve: Sur un essai de theologie pagano-ju~ve," Numen 23 (1976): 40-66. It is important to note that the first testimonies by Greek authors-Hecataeus of Abdera, Theophrastus, Megasthenes, Clearchus of Soli-presented the Jews as a people of "philosophers"; see the analysis of the sources in Hengel, vo1. 1, pp. 255 ff.

The Iranian doctrine of resurrection is clearly documented in the
fourth century B.C.; see Theopompus, Frag. 64, in F. Jacoby, Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (Berlin, 1929); see also § 112 in vol. 1 of the present work. The apocrypha and pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament have been translated by R. H. Charles and his collaborators in the second volume of Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha (Oxford, 1913). We have followed their translations of 4 Esdras, 1 Enoch, the Psalms of Solomon, the Testament of the XII Patriarchs, and the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch. We have also consulted J. T. Milik, The Books of Enoch (1976), and Pierre Bogaert, L'Apocalypse syriaque ie Baruch, 2 vols. (1969). See also A. M.

Braude, Jewish Proselytizing, Brown University Studies, no. 6 (Providence, 1940), and Hengel, vol. 1, pp. 168 ff. (with recent bibliography). Hengel rightly observes that Judaism exercised its greatest historical influence during the Hellenistic-Roman period. "Both its fight for freedom against the Seleucids and its bitter struggle with Rome are probably unique in the ancient world" (vol. 1, p. 309). Unique, too, was the effort to proselytize that was imitated and continued by primitive Chris

tianity. However, the "ontology of the Torah" and the strict legalism of the Pharisees ended, on the one hand, in halting the missionary effort and, on the other hand, in the tragic misunderstanding in regard to Christianity. The small Judaeo-Christian community managed to maintain itself in Palestine with great difficulty and only by observing the Torah. The accusation of syncretistic-Hellenistic apostasy still influences Jewish interpretations of Paul in our own day (Hengel, vol. 1, p. 309, mentioning J. Klausner, L. Baeck, and H. J. Schoeps; cf. Hengel, vol. 2, p. 205, n. 315). For H. J. Schoeps, for example, Paul is "a Jew of the Diaspora, alienated from the faith of his fathers" (Paul [London, 1961], p. 261). Citing this passage, Hengel remarks (vol. 1, p. 309) that strict and apologetic understanding of the Torah, so unlike the message of the Prophets, was irreconcilable with the universal eschatological proclamation of the Gospels and must have been ignored. For the defenders of the Torah, however, the Christians looked like the Jewish renegades who, between ca. 175 and 164, urged apostasy and assimilation (ibid., p. 314).

Augustus published his horoscope, and coins were struck with the image of Capricorn, his zodiacal constellation. The mythology and theology of the seven planets have left their traces in the seven days of the week, the seven angels of the Apocalypse, the notion of seven Heavens and seven Hells, the ritual stairway of seven steps in the cult of Mithra, etc. For the cult of sovereigns, see E.

Scott and A. S. Ferguson, Hermetica, 4 vols. (Oxford, 1924-36), valuable for its notes and commentaries, should be consulted cautiously, since the authors worked from a poor text. An excellent presentation and review of studies and problems has been provided by Jean Doresse, "L'Hermetisme egyptianisant," Histoire des religions, vol. 2 (Paris, 1972), pp. 430-97 (see also pp. 433-41 for an inventory of texts). The fundamental work by Festugiere, La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, 4 vols. (Paris, 1944-54), remains indispensable.

Priimm, Religionsgeschichtliches Handbuch, pp. 540-605; G. van Moorsel, The Mysteries ofHermes Trismegistos (Utrecht, 1955); Hugo Rahner, Greek Myths and Christian Mystery (London and New York, 1963), pp. 190 ff. The texts of popular Hermetism have been analyzed at length, in
terpreted, and translated in part in Festugiere's La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, vol. 1: L'Astrologie et les sciences occultes. On the alchemical structure of the creation of souls in the treatise Kore Kosmou, see the article by Festugiere published in Pisciculi (MOnster, 1939), pp. 102-16, and reprinted in Hermetisme et mystique paiimne, pp. 230-48. The writings of philosophical Hermetism belong to various literary genres. The Poimandres is an aretalogy, that is, a narrative of a miraculous manifestation (arete) of the divinity (here, the divine Nous); there are also fragments of cosmogony and didactic logoi (see Festugiere, Revelation, vol. 2, pp. 28 ff.). Treatises I and XIII describe the experience of a divinization, and it is especially these two treatises that contain the revelation of Hermetic salvation (see Festugiere, Hermetisme et mystique paiimne, pp. 34 ff., 38 ff.).
The optimistic theology is expounded in Treatises V, VII, and IX of the Corpus Hermeticum, and the pessimistic doctrine is presented in Treatises I, IV, VI, VII, and XIII. But sometimes the orientations coexist in the same book. The Egyptian affinities of the Corpus Hermeticum have been brought out by Reitzenstein in R. Reitzenstein and H. H. Schaeder, Studien zum antiken Synkretismus (Leipzig and Berlin, 1926), pp. 43-44; Philippe Derchain, "L'authenticite de l'inspiration egyptienne, dans Ie Corpus Hermeticum," RHR 161 (1962): 172-98; Martin Krause, "Aegyptisches Gedankengut in der Apokalypse des Asclepius," ZDMG, supplement, 1 (1969): 48-57; and by Jean Doresse in "Hermes et la gnose: A propos de l'Asclepius copte" and, most recently, "L'Hermetisme egyptianisant," pp. 442-50. Certain influences from Jewish sources have also been detected. Corpus Hermeticum, Treatise I, cites Genesis; see C. H. Dodd, The Bible and the Greeks (1935), pp. 99 ff.; Scott, Hermetica, vol. 1, pp. 54 ff. See also Marc Philonenko, "Une allusion de l'Asclepius au livre d'Henoch," in Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studies for Morton Smith, vol. 2 (Leiden, 1975), pp. 161-63.

tic library of Nag Hammadi has yielded a collection of Hermetic texts in the dialect of Upper Egypt, among them several long fragments of a proto-Asclepius; see three works by J. Doresse, "Hermes et la gnose: A propos de I'Asclepius copte," Novum Testamentum 1 (1956): 54-59; Les livres secrets des gnostiques d'Egypte (Paris, 1958), pp. 256 ff.; and "L'Hermetisme egyptianisant," p. 434.
210. The existence of Hermetic brotherhoods has been maintained by R. Reitzenstein, Poimandres, pp. 248 ff. (on the "PoimandresGemeinde"), and accepted by Geffcken, Der Ausgang des griechischromischen Heidentums (Heidelberg, 1920), pp. 20 ff. See the critique of this hypothesis by Festugiere in La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, vol. 1, pp. 81-84, and in Hermetisme et mystique pai"enne, pp. 37-38.
On the transposition of cult Mysteries into literary Mysteries, see Festugiere, L'ideal religieux des Grecs et l'Evangile, pp. 11~32; La Revelation, pp. 82 ff.; Hermetisme et mystique pai"enne, pp. 103 ff.

The Hermetic literature of the Sabaeans is analyzed by Scott, Hermetica, vol. 4, pp. 248-76 (the author has drawn chiefly on the two volumes by D. A. Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier und Ssabismus (St. Petersburg, 1856]); see also Festugiere and Nock, Hermes-Trismegiste, vol. 4, pp. 145-46; J. B. Segal, "The Sabian Mysteries," in E. Bacon, ed., Vanished Civilizations (New York and London, 1963), pp. 201-20.
On Arabic Hermetic literature, see L. Massignon's appendix in the first volumeof La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, pp. 384-99, and Henry and Renee Kahane, The Krater and the Grail, pp. 11~22. In the twelfih century, after a spate of translations of Arabic works, Hermetism began to be known in Europe; see H. and R. Kahane, pp. 130 ff. The Hermetic influence on the Parzival of Wolfram von Eschenbach and the derivation ofthe term graal (cup, vessel, basin) from -the vocable krater have been brought out by the Kahanes in The Krater and the Grail, passim.

Festugiere, La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, vol. 1 (1944), pp. 216-82; three works by F. Sherwood Taylor, "A Survey of Greek Alchemy," Journal oj Hellenic Studies 50 (1930): 103-39, "The Origins of Greek Alchemy," Ambix 1 (1937): 30-47, and The Alchemists (New York, 1940); Robert P. Multhauf, The Origins oj Chemistry (London, 1966), pp. 103-16; W. J. Wilson, "The Origins and Development of Greco-Egyptian Alchemy," Ciba Symposia 3 (1941): 926-60; and J. Lindsay, Hellenistic Alchemy (London, 1970). As for technical recipes for metallurgy and the craft ofthe goldsmith, already documented in the sixteenth century B.C. (in, for example, the Ebers Papyrus), they certainly comprised a hierurgical context, for in the traditional societies operations were paralleled by a ritual. The Leiden and Stockholm papyri, containing purely "chemical" recipes (on these, see, most recently, Multhauf, The Origins oj Chemistry, pp. % ff., with the recent bibliography), were found in a tomb at Thebes beside Magical Papyruses XII and XIII (published by Preisendanz). R. G. Forbes has cited many examples of a "secret language" used in Mesopotamia for writing down recipes for the manufacture of glass (as early as the seventeeth century B.C.) and for synthetic lapis lazuli, as well as for medical recipes; see his Studies in Ancient Technology, vol. 1 (Leiden, 1955), p. 125. The oft-repeated warning in Mesopotamian medical texts of the seventh century B.c.-"He who knows may show to him who knows, but he who knows may not show to him who knows not"-is already found in recipes for manufacturing glass in the Kassite period, ten centuries earlier; see Forbes, p. 127. Hellenistic alchemical literature abounds in objurations and oaths forbidding the communication of esoteric mysteries to the profane. Ostanes "veiled the mysteries as cautiously as [he did] the pupils of his eyes; he ordered that they were not to be imparted to disciples who were not worthy

of them"; other examples are in J. Bidez and F. Cumont, Les mages hellenises (Paris, 1938), vol. 2, pp. 315 if. The obligation to preserve the secrecy of the opus alchymicum remained in force from the end of the ancient world down to our day. Besides, communication of "trade secrets" by means of writing is 'an illusion of modem historiography. If there is a literature that has claimed to "reveal secrets," it is certainly the literature of Tantrism, but in this sizable mass of writings we never find the practical indications that are indispensable to sadhana: in the decisive moments, the assistance of a master is necessary, if only to verify the authenticity of the experience. H. E. Stapleton holds that the origin of Alexandrine alchemy must be sought not in Hellenistic Egypt but in Mesopotamia, at Harran; it is there that he places the author of the Treatises of Agathodaimon, a text probably written in the year 200 B.C. and so, according to Stapleton, before Physika kai Mystika,· see his "The Antiquity of Alchemy," Ambix 5 (1953): 1-43. This hypothesis, which, among other things, explains the rise of Arabic alchemy, is still in dispute. In a series of recent studies H. J. Shepard has seen in Gnosticism the chief source of the alchemical mystique; see his "Gnosticism and Alchemy," Ambix 6 (1957): 86-101, and the bibliography given in Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible, pp. 217-21.
C. G. Jung commented on the visions of Zosimus in his study "The Visions of Zosimus," trans. R. F. C. Hull, in The Collected Works of Carl G. Jung, Bollingen Series 20, vol. 13 (Princeton, 1954). The original text of the "Visions" is in M. Berthelot, Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs (Paris, 1888), pp. 107-12, 115-18. There is also an English translation by F. Sherwood Taylor in Ambix 1 (1937): 88-92. Separatio is expressed in alchemical terms of the dismembering of a human body; see Jung, "The Visions of Zosimus," p. 87, n. 111.

On the cosmogonic myths, disseminated from Eastern Europe to Siberia, in which God's adversary plays a part, see Eliade, Zalmoxis, the Vanishing God: Comparative Studies in the Religions and Folklore ofDacia and Eastern Europe, trans. Willard R. Trask (Chicago, 1972),
pp. 76 ff. (the Iranian legends are analyzed on pp. 106-12). The myth transmitted by Eznik, Against the Sects (translated by Zaehner, Zurvan, pp. 438-39) goes on to relate that Ohrmazd, after creating the world, did not know how to make the sun and the moon. Ahriman did know, and talked of it to the demons: Ohrmazd must sleep with his mother to create the sun and with his sister to make the moon. A demon hastened to communicate the formula to Ohrmazd (see Eliade, Zalmoxis, p. 107 and notes 80--81). Now, as Widengren has shown (Religions de [,Iran, p. 321), the Magi were known for their incestuous practices. The continuation of the myth preserved by Eznik contains a contradiction, for Ohrmazd, who had shown himself to be the "successful creator" ("all that Ohrmazd created was good and straight"), suddenly proves unable to complete his creation; he exhibits the "mental fatigue" that is characteristic of certain types of dii otiosi (see
Zalmoxis, pp. 87 ff. and passim). This episode was probably introduced as an etiological myth to justify the conduct of the Parthian Magi.
214. We shall study the religions of the Sassanid period in volume 3 (see also below, § 216). A good account will be found in Widengren, Les religions de l'Iran, pp. 273 ff., and in Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de ['Iran ancien, pp. 276 ff. It must not be forgotten, however, that several conceptions that are documented only in late texts go back to the Achaemenid period; see, inter alia, G. Widengren, "The Problem of the Sassanid Avesta,'" in Holy Book and Holy Tradition, ed. F. F. Bruce and E. G. Rupp (Manchester, Eng., 1968), pp. 36-53.

There are good discussions of Gayomart by Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien, pp. 208 ff., 324 ff.; Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight, pp. 180,232,262 ff.; M. Mole, Culte, mythe et cosmologie, pp. 484 ff. (critique of Hartmann's thesis). K. Hoffmann has brought out the similarities to a semidivine Vedic personage, Mfu1:aI}4a ("mortal seed"), in "MartaI}4a and Gayomart," Munchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft 11 (1957): 85-103. On the macrocosmos-microcosmos theme and its relations with the cosmogony and with Gayomart, see Anders Olerud, L'idee de macrocosmos et de microcosmos dans Ie "Timee" de Platon (Uppsala, 1951), pp. 144 ff., and Ugo Bianchi, Zaman i Ohrmazd, pp. 190-221 (see pp. 194 ff. for a critique of Olerud). Jewish circles provide similar speculations in regard to Adam. A text of the Sibylline Oracles (3. 24-26), dating from the second or first century B.C., explains the name of Adam as a symbol of the cosmos: A = anatole, East; D = dysis, West; A = arktos, North;
M = mesembria, South. See also the Book of the Slavic Enoch (in R. H. Charles, The Apocrypha [Oxford, 1913], vol. 2, p. 449); the alchemist Zosimus, Authentic Commentaries, sec. 11, translated by Festugiere in his La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, vol. 1 (Paris, 1944), p. 269.

According to an earlier tradition preserved in the Bundahisn, Gayomart fiercely resisted the attackers and, before succumbing, caused considerable losses among them. In Manichaean mythology, the Primordial Man, Gehmurd (Gayomart), headed the resistance against the Evil One's attack; see G. Widengren, "The Death of Gayomart," in J. M. Kitagawa and C. H. Long, eds., Myths and Symbols: Studies in Honor of Mircea Eliade (Chicago, 1969), p. J81. See also, by the same author, "Primordial Man and Prostitute: A Zervanite Motif in the Sassanid Avesta," Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to Gershom G. Scholem, pp. 337-52.
On Gayomart as Perfect Man, see M. Mole, Culte, mythe et cosmoiogie, pp. 469 if. According to Mole, the "MazdaeanMacranthropos is not Gayomart; rather, he appears as a manifestation of Ohrmazd" (p.410). The various expressions for the imperishable element in man (aM, "life"; urvan, "soul"; baodhah, "knowledge"; daenii and fravashi) are analyzed by Duchesne-Guillemin, La Religion de ['Iran ancien, pp. 327 if., who also mentions the essential bibliography. On the saviors to come and the final renovation, see Duchesne-Guillemin" pp. 343-54 (there is a brief analysis of the contradictions in the eschatology, pp. 352-53); G. Widengren, Les religions de ['Iran, pp. 127 if.; Mole, Culte, mythe et cosmologie, pp. 412 if., and the bibliographies given in vol. 1 of the present work, pp. 471-73 (§§ 111-12).
217. The two volumes by Franz Cumont, Textes et monuments figures relati/s aux Mysteres de Mithra (Brussels, 1896, 1898), still remain indispensable. The same author has published a short summarizing book, Les Mysteres de Mithra (Brussels, 1900; 3d ed., 1913); see also his Les religions orientales dans Ie paganisme romain, 4th ed. (Paris, 1929), pp. 131 if., 270 if. (both works are available in English tranSlation). Cumont's last work on Mithraism, probably finished in May 1947, three months before his death, was not published until 1975: "The Dura Mithraeum," translated and edited by E. D. Francis in Miihraic Studies, ed. J. R. Hinnells (Manchester, 1975), pp. 151-214. A critical analysis of Cumont's interpretation has been provided by R. L. Gordon,"Franz Cumont and the Doctrines of Mithraism," ibid., pp. 215-48. Stig Wikander had already criticized Cumont's reconstruction in the first fascicle (the only one published) of his Etudes sur les Mysteres de Mithra (Lund, 1950); but see Widengren's observations in Stand und Aufgaben der iranischen Religionsgeschichte (Leiden, 1955), pp. 114 if.

In several of his works G. Widengren has brought out the Iranian elements present in the Mysteries of Mithra; see, most recently, "The Mithraic Mysteries," passim. R. Merkelbach has identified other features of Iranian origin; see his "Zwei Vermutungen zur Mithrasreligion," Numen 6 (1959): 154-56. On the enthronement of the Parthian king and the Armenian traditions concerning Meher, see G. Widengren, Iranisch-semitische Kulturbegegnung in parthischer Zeit, pp. 65 if.; S.

In his study "Mithra-Verehrung, Mithras-Kult, und die Existenz iranischer Mysterien" (Mithraic Studies, pp. 378-405), Carsten Colpe limits the origin ofthe Mysteries to the region of Pontus and Commagene; he sees the cult as a politically oriented syncretistic one, of comparatively recent date (second century A.D.). For the episodes featuring Mithra and the bull before the immolation, see Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien, p. 250, and
M. I. Vermaseren, Mithras, the Secret God, pp. 79 if.; these adventures are depicted almost exclusively on the monuments of Central Europe, between the Rhine and the Danube.

Martin Schwartz, "Cautes and Cautopates, the Mithraic Torch Bearers," in Mithraic Studies, pp. 406-23; these two studies cite the most important items of the 'earlier literature. In the representations of the sacrifice of the bull, Mithra has his head turned, "as iflooking behind him and often with a strangely sad expression; usually a crow, to the left, leans toward him; the figure of the Sun is often in the left-hand comer, and, to the right, that of the Moon; below, springing toward the blood spouting from the wound, is a dog, also a snake; a scorpion pinches the testicles of the dying beast and stings them with its tail; an ant sometimes joins the gathering; or else, below the bull, a krater is depicted, and a lion appears to be guarding it or drinking from it, while, elsewhere, the snake seems to be doing likewise.... The bull's raised tail ends in a tuft of ears of com; there are even monuments in which,instead of blood, such ears spout from the bull's wound" (Loisy, Les Mysteres parens, pp. 185-86, summarizing Cumont). From the considerable bibliography on Mithra the bull-slayer, we mention Vermaseren, Mithras, the Secret God, pp. 67 ff., and also his "A Unique Representation of Mithras," Vigiliae Christianae 4 (1950): 142-256; L. A. Campbell, Mithraic Iconography, pp. 247 ff.; John R. Hinnells, "Reflections on the Bull-slaying Scene," in Mithraic Studies, pp. 290-312 (the author rejects Cumont's interpretation, according to which the animals present at the sacrifice of the bull-the dog, the snake, and the scorpion-would represent the conflict between Good and Evil). For the sacrifice of animals on the occasion of the Mithrakana among the Zoroastrians of Iran, see Mary Boyce, "Mihragan among the Irani Zoroastrians," in Mithraic Studies, pp. 106-18. On the seven grades of Mithraic initiation, see F. Cumont, Textes et monuments figures, vol. 1, pp. 314 ff.; G. Widengren, "The Mithraic Mysteries," pp. 448 ff.; and Campbell, Mithraic Iconography, pp. 303 ff. For it long time the second grade was read cryphius instead of nymphus. However, though no manuscript of Jerome (Ep. ad Laetam 107. 10) has cryphius, this term is documented in the Mithraic inscriptions of San Silvestro; see Bruce M.

219. The majority of works on Jesus of Nazareth, which have been increasing in number ever more rapidly since the beginning of the

nineteenth century, are of interest chiefly for the ideology and methodology of their authors. A detailed critical history of the works that appeared from Hermann E. Reimarus (1779) to Wilhelm Wrede (1901) will be found in the book by Albert Schweitzer, Von Reimarus zu Wrede: Eine Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung (TObingen, 1906; 6th ed., 1951); we have used the English translation, The Quest of the Historical Jesus (1910), republished in 1968, with an introduction by James M. Robinson valuable for its analysis of some later studies (Maurice Goguel, R. Bultmann, Karl Barth, F. Buri, etc.). We mention some recent works: G. Bornkamm, Jesus von Nazareth (Stuttgart, 1956; English trans., Jesus of Nazareth, New York, 1961); Ethelbert Stauffer, Jesus: Gestalt und Geschichte (Bern, 1957); J.

See also Nock's article "Hellenistic Mysteries and Christian Sacraments," Mnemosyne 4th ser. 5 (1952): 177-214. There is a significant difference between the spectacular cures, exorcisms, and miracles performed by Jesus and the similar exploits documented in the Hellenistic traditions (e.g., by Apollonius of Tyana) and the Jewish tradition (some examples from the Babylonian Talmud are cited by Perrin, Rediscovering the Teaching ofJesus, p. l35). Jesus always insists on "the faith that saves". (see Mark 5:34, 10:52; Luke 7:50, 17:19, etc.). After he cured the boy possessed by a devil, the disciples asked Jesus: "Why were we unable to cast it out?" "Because you have little faith," he answered. For "if your faith were the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move; nothing would be impossible for you" (Matt. 17:19-20; cf. Luke 17:6). Now, as has been observed, this valorization of faith is completely absent from Hellenistic literature and from the traditions collected in the Babylonian Talmud; see Perrin, Rediscovering the Teaching of Jesus, pp. 130-42, and the recent works cited there, p. l30, n. 1, and p. 131, nn. 1-6, etc.

1959); H. Kosmalas, Hebriier, Essener, Christen (Leiden, 1959); M. Simon, Verus Israel (Paris, 1948; 2d ed., 1964). The Book of Acts scarcely mentions the leader of the first Christian community in Jerusalem, James, "the brother ofthe Lord" (Gal. 1: 19), whom Paul opposed (Gal. 2: 12). His relations with rabbinic Judaism are obvious (he did not drink wine, never shaved, spent his life in the Temple, etc.). Since James's party finally disappeared after the war of 66-70, the memory ofhim faded away. But other documents (the Gospel ofthe Hebrews, the Gospel of Thomas, the Pseudo-Clementines, etc.) present James as the most important personage in the Church; see S. G. F. Brandon, The Fall of Jerusalem and the Christian Church (London, 1951), pp. 126-54; J. Danielou, Nouvelle histoire de I'Eglise, vol. 1 (Paris, 1963), pp. 37-38. On Judaeo-Christianity, see H. J.

Simon et aI., Aspects du Judeo-Christianisme: Colloque de Strasbourg (Paris, 1965). There is a good general presentation in M. Simon and A. Benoit, Le Judafsme et Ie Christianisme antique, pp. 258-74. Add: M. Simon, "Refiexions sur Ie judeo-chnstianisme," Christianity, Judaism ..• : Studies for Morton Smith, vol. 2 (Leiden, 1975), pp. 53-76 (critical examination of some recent works). Judaeo-Christianity was characterized by its exclusive attachment to observance of the Jewish Law-a fidelity that was later expressed, in M. Simon's words, in "a sort of fossilization. Certain Judaeo-Christians became heretics by the mere fact that they remained apart from the doctrinal evolution of the Great Church and did not accept, or simply ignored, the enlargements and enrichments that Christian dogma experienced in relation to the simple primitive kerygma, especially from the time when Greek thought lent it its framework and concepts.... Their aversion to Paul, so characteristic of their position, was doubtless motivated by his attitude toward the Law. But by the same token, it kept them apart from Christological developments, of which Pauline thought constitutes the point of departure. In doctrine as on the plane of observance, they remained the immobile heirs of the primitive community. They were, so to speak, negative heretics, heretics by default" (Marcel Simon, in Le Judaisme et Ie Christianisme antique, p. 270).
The reasons given by the Jews for rejecting Christianity are examined by D. R. A. Hare, The Theme ofJewish Persecution ojChristianity in the Gospel according to St. Matthew (Cambridge, 1967), pp. 1-18.



Chapter 28. The Birth of Christianity 535
222. For two generations, the interpretations of the conversion and theology of Saint Paul were dominated, on the one hand, by too strict a distinction between Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism and, on the other hand, by overly personal evaluations of these two forms of Judaism. Thus, for example, Albert Schweitzer c,ontrasted Saint Paul, whom he held to have been an adherent of the Palestinian religious structure, to Saint John, who was completely integrated into the tradition of Hellenistic Judaism; see A. Schweitzer, Die Mystik des Apostel Paulus (TUbingen, 1930; English trans., The Mysticism ofPaul the Apostle, New York, 1968); while a Jewish exegete, C. J. G. Montefiore, ranked Paul among the uprooted members of the Diaspora; had he known the pure and superior Judaism of Palestine, Montefiore concluded, Paul would never have accepted the Gospel (Judaism and St. Paul [London, 1914]). Similar positions are defended by Joseph Klausner, From Jesus to Paul, translated from the Hebrew by W. F. Stinespring (London, 1943; republished, New York, 1961), and by S. Sandmel, A Jewish Understanding of the New Testament (New York, 1956), pp. 37-51, and H. J. Schoeps, Paulus (TUbingen, 1959). But recent researches have shown, on the one hand, the profound Hellenistic influence on the rabbinic ideology and vocabulary and, on the other hand, the presence of Semitic concepts in the Hellenistic writings. The old dichotomy between Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism is no longer tenable (see the bibliographies for §§ 200, 204). By the same token, the opposition between the two forms of Christian religiosity, Pauline and Johannine-an opposition brilliantly elaborated by A. Schweitzer-disappears. See W. D. Davies, Paul and Rabbinic Judaism: Some Elements in Pauline Theology (London, 1948; paperback, New York, 1967, with a new introduction, "Paul and Judaism since Schweitzer," pp. vii-xv). In obeying the call of the resurrected Christ, Paul did not consider himself an apostate. But he redefined the true nature of Israel and the Law from the point of view of a Jew who had just discovered the Messiah in Jesus Christ. For Paul, what thenceforth characterized the "people of God" was no
longer obedience to the Law but faith in the Christ. It was in a sense the fulfillment of Jewish religious universalism; for, by virtue of the Christ-Messiah, the "people of God" could accomplish the universal reconciliation ("neither Greek nor Jew nor man nor woman," etc.) and prepare the renewal of the world, the "New Creation." From the very extensive recent literature, we mention M. Dibelius and W. G. Kiimmel, Paulus, 2d ed. (Berlin, 1956; English trans. of the first ed., Paul, New York, 1953); J. Dupont, Gnosis: La connaissance

but the author's thesi~oncerning the initiatory baptism practiced by Jesus and the libertine practices that invoked the authority of that secret tradition-has been generally rejected by the exegetes.

228. Investigations of Gnosis and Gnosticism have made significant progress during the past forty years; however, the origin of the current known by the name of "Gnosticism" is not yet solved. For Adolf Harnack, Gnosticism-as it appears in the second century of our erarepresents a radical Hellenization of Christianity ("eine akute Hellenisierung des Christentums"). This is, furthermore, the thesis of the Christian theologians-first of all, Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome-for whom Gnosticism was a diabolical heresy, produced by a deformation of Christian doctrine under the influence of Greek philosophy. But in a book that still remains fundamental, Hauptprobleme



Chapter 29. Paganism, Christianity, Gnosis 543
der Gnosis (G6ttingen, 1907), Wilhelm Bousset proposes a completely contrary explanation: analyzing the specifically Gnostic themes (dualism, the notion of the Savior, the ecstatic ascent of the soul) from a comparative point of view, he credits them with an Iranian origin. For Bousset, then, Gnosticism is a pre-Christian phenomenon that also actually included Christianity. R. Reitzenstein developed and clarified this hypothesis in several works, the most important of which is Das iranische ErlOsungsmysterium (Leipzig, 1921). Reitzenstein reconstructs the Iranian myth of the "saved Savior," whose most articulate expression is in the "Hymn of the Pearl" in the Acts of Thomas (see § 230). The Iranian origin of Gnosis, criticized by certain Orientalists and historians of religions, has been accepted, corrected, and brought up to date by G. Widengren; see especially his study "Les origines du gnosticisme et l'histoire des religions" (Le origini della Gnosticismo, pp. 28-60), where the Swedish scholar also examines other more recent hypotheses.
The work by Hans Jonas, The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity (Boston, 1958; ent. ed., 1963), is fundamental for its penetrating analysis of the "Gnostic phenomenon." Jonas is the first historian of philosophy to study Gnosticism, after H. Leisegang and Simone Petrement; but Leisegang's Die Gnosis (Leipzig, 1924; 3d ed., 1941; French trans., La Gnose, 1951) is useful chiefly for its long quotations from texts, and Simone Petrement's work has as its title Le dualisme chez Platon, les gnostiques, et les manicheens (Paris, 1947). As regards the beginnings of the Gnostic movement, Jonas distinguishes two types of Gnosis, derived from two different cultural milieux: Syro-Egyptian and Iranian (this hypothesis is criticized by Widengren in "Les origines du gnosticisme," pp. 38 ff.).
The book by Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism and Early Christianity (New York, 1959), is an excellent introduction, valuable for its pertinent analyses of several Gnostic systems. Grant explains the appearance of Gnosticism by the crisis of Jewish apocalyptic thought after the catastrophe of the 70s. This hypothesis, accepted by Father Jean Danielou (among others), has been criticized by, inter alia, Jacob Neusner, "Judaism in Late Antiquity," Judaism 15 (1966): 236 ff. For Gilles Quispel, Gnosis is a universal religion (see his Gnosis als Weltreligion [Zurich, 1951]), but the different Gnostic systems of the second century derive from Jewish and Judaeo-Christian apocalyptic speculations (see his articles collected in Gnostic Studies, 2 vols. [Leiden, 1973]). Henri-Charles Puech's important contributions to the history and phenomenology of Gnosis, published from 1934 on in various

learned journals and in the Annuaire du College de France, have recently been collected and published under the title En quete de la Gnose, vol. 1: La Gnose et Ie Temps; vol. 2: Sur l'Evangile selon Thomas (Paris, 1978). We must mention especially his studies on Plotinus, on the phenomenology of Gnosis, and on Gnosis and time (vol. 1, pp. 55-116, 185-214, 215-70). An up-to-date restatement has been provided by R. McL. Wilson, The Gnostic Problem (London, 1958), where he analyzes particularly the Jewish and Christian elements present in the various Gnostic schools. See also his contribution to the Messina Colloquium, "Gnosis, Gnosticism, and the New Testament" (Le origini dello Gnosticismo, pp. 511-27). The participants in the international Messina Colloquium on the origins of Gnosticism undertook carefully to delimit the meanings of the terms Gnosis and Gnosticism; "Gnosticism" designates "a certain group of systems of the second century A.D., which everyone agrees to denominate thus." But "Gnosis," on the contrary, means "a knowledge of divine mysteries, but a knowledge restricted to an elite" (Le origini dello Gnosticismo, p. xxiii). On the occasion of the Messina Colloquium it was possible to observe once again the number and variety of the hypotheses concerning the "origins" of Gnosticism. In his study' 'Perspectives de la recherche sur les origines du gnosticisme" (ibid., pp. 716-46), Ugo Bianchi sketched a morphology of Gnostic themes, at the same time analyzing their geographical distribution and their possible historical relations. See also, by the same author, "Le probleme des origines du gnosticisme" (ibid., pp. 1-27). Among the numerous communications to the Messina Colloquium we mention those of H. Jonas, "Delimitation of the Gnostic Phenomenon-Typological and Historical" (ibid., pp. 90-108); A. Bausani, "Lettere iraniche per l'origine e la definizione tipologica di Gnosi" (pp. 251-64); G. Gnoli, "La gnosi iranica: Per un impostazione del problema" (pp. 281-90), principally an examination of Manichaeanism; R. Grahay, "Elements d'une mythopee gnostique dans la Grece classique" (pp. 323-39); M. Simon, "Elements gnostiques chez PhiIon" (pp~ 359-76); H. Ringgren, "Qumran and Gnosticism" (pp. 379-88); H. J. Schoeps, "Judenchristentum und Gnosis" (pp. 528-37); and G. Quispel, "Makarius und das Lied von der Perle" (pp. 625-44). On Plotinus and Gnosis, see the study by H.-C. Puech, En quite de la Gnose, vol. 1, pp. 55-116; on the relations between Platonic dualism (especially in Plotinus' interpretation) and Gnostic dualism, see E. R.

The discovery of Gnostic manuscripts in a jar at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt and the eventful history of their acquisition, deciphering, and publication have been told by Jean Doresse, Les livres secrets des gnostiques d'Egypte, vol. 1: Introduction aux ecrits gnostiques coptes
decouverts a Khenoboskion (Paris, 1958), pp. 133 ff. (English trans., The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics, New York, 1972), and, with previously unknown details, by John Dart, The Laughing Savior (New York, 1976). See also James R. Robinson, "The Jung Codex: The Rise and Fall of a Monopoly," Religious Studies Review 3 (1977): 17-30. The complete edition, The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices, was completed in 1976. Critical editions of certain texts, accompanied by translations and commentaries, have been published progressively since 1956, but the only complete translation (unfortunately without notes and commentaries) is the one published under the direction of James M. Robinson, The Nag Hammadi Library (New York, 1977). The library discovered at Nag Hammadi has given rise to countless studies. See David M. Scholer, Nag Hammadi Bibliography, 1948-1969 (Leiden, 1971), and the annual reports of developments published in the periodical Novum Testamentum. An extremely learned analysis of the new publications--critical editions, translations, and contributions to the history and exegesis of the texts-has been provided by Carsten Colpe in "Heidnische, jiidische, und christliche Uberiieferung in den Schriften aus Nag Hammadi," Jahrbuch fur Antike und Christentum 16 (1973): 106-26; 17 (1974): 109-25; 18 (1975): 144--65; 19 (1976): 120-38. Among works devoted to analysis and interpretation ofthe new texts, we mention: W. C. van Unnik, Newly Discovered Gnostic Writings (Naperville, Ill., 1960); Alexander B6hlig, Mysterion und Wahrheit (Leiden, 1968), pp. 80-111, 119-61; Martin Krause, ed., Essays on the Nag Hammadi Texts in Honour of Alexander B6hlig (Leiden, 1972); M. Tardieu, Trois mythes gnostiques: Adam, Eve, et les animaux d'Egypte dans un ecrU de Nag Hammadi (Paris, 1974). See also the studies by Henri-Charles Puech collected in his work En quete de la Gnose, vol. 2: Sur I'Evangile selon Thomas. The same volume contains (pp. 11-32) a translation of the Gospel according to Thomas (published for the first time, with apparatus criticus and commentary, in 1959). Another translation, thoroughly annotated, has been provided by Jean Doresse in L'Evangile selon Thomas, ou les Paroles Secretes de Jesus (Paris, 1959). See also the excellent commentary by J. E.

Marcion's work, the Antitheses, is lost, but the substance of it is known to us from Tertullian's treatise Adversus Marcionem. Numerous orthodox writers composed attacks on Marcionism-for example, Justin, Irenaeus, and Dionysius of Corinth. The book by Adolph von Harnack, Marcion: Das Evangelium vom fremden Gott, 2d ed. (Leipzig, 1924), has not been surpassed. See also E. G. Blackmann, Marcion and His Influence (London, 1948); H.

On Valentinus and his school, see F. M. Sagnard, La gnose valentinienne et Ie temoignage de saint [renee (Paris, 1947); A. Orbe, Estudios valentinianos, 4 vols. (Rome, 195~1), a most learned comparative study ofthe Gnostic and Christian theologies; and H. Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, pp. 174-205. See also the bibliography given above on the Gospel of Truth. Among the writings that belong to the Valentinian school, mention must be made of the treatise De Resurrectione (Epistula ad Rheginum); we use the translation and commentary by Malcolm Lee Peel, The Epistle to Rheginos: A Valentinian Letter on the Resurrection (Philadelphia, 1969). This short text (fewer than eight pages) is especially important because iUs the first Gnostic document from Nag Hammadi devoted to individual eschatology (i.e., the death and postexistence of the person). Valentinus is the only Gnostic teacher the names of whose disciples are known. One of them, Heracleon, composed the first commentary on John's Gospel; Origen replied to him by writing his own commentary. In fact, these disciples developed Valentinus' system in such a way that it is hard to determine the outline of his original doctrine. On the different expressions of the Valentinian theology, see R. Grant, Gnosticism and Early Christianity, pp. 134 ff.
On the libertine Gnostic sects, first of all the Phibionites (whose orgies were described by Epiphanius, Panarion, 26. 1. 1 ff.), see Stephen Benko, "The Libertine Gnostic Sect of the Phibionites according to Epiphanius," Vigiliae Christianae 2 (1967): 103-19; Alfonso M. de Nola, Parole segrete di Gesit, p. 80-90; Eliade, Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions (Chicago, 1976), pp. 109 ff., 139-40. The Gnostic sect of the Mandaeans still survives in a small community of 13,000-14,000 believers in southern Iraq. Their name derives from the term mandiiye ("Gnostics"). We have a large number of works: the two Ginziis ("treasures"), the Book of John, and a canonical book of prayers and other cult texts, all obtained especially thanks to the enthusiasm and energy of Lady E. S. Drower. It is probable that the religious practices (first of all, baptism and the requiem Mass), as well as the theology of the Mandaeans, go back to a very ancient time, preceding the preaching of Jesus Christ. However, the origin and history of the sect are still inadequately known. Probably it represents a heretical Jewish sect, opposed to orthodox Judaism and strongly influenced by Gnostic and Iranian ideas. As Kurt Rudolph writes: "It is a branch, organized in a baptismal sect, of the JudaeoSyrian Gnostic current, which has become a closed community in life

The history of Manichaean studies constitutes an important chapter in the history of ideas in Europe; we need but call to mind the philosophical interest and the impassioned controversies aroused by the Histoire critique de Manichee et du Manicheisme, 2 vols.

The best general exposition remains the book by H.-C. Puech, Le Manicheisme: Son fondateur, sa doctrine (Paris, 1949); the notes (pp. 98-195) make up an excellent documentation. The same author presents a new synthesis in the chapter "Le Manicheisme" in H.-C. Puech, ed., Histoire des religions, vol. 2 (1972), pp. 523-645. See also G.

The episode of the voice heard by Patek has been transmitted to us by Ibn an-Nadim (Fihrist, pp. 83-84, trans. Flugel). On the baptismal sect to which Patek was converted, see the discussion of the sources in Puech, Le Manicheisme, pp: 40-42 and nn. 146-56; G. Widengren, Mani, pp. 24-26. The recent discovery of a Greek Codex whose Syriac origin goes back to the fifth century enables us to identify the baptismal sect: it is that of the Elchasaites, a Judaeo-Christian Gnostic movement founded by Elchai during the reign of Trajan.

Edward Sachau [London, 1879], p. 190). According to the testimony ofaCoptic Kephalaion, Mani received a single revelation at the age of twelve years: the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete promised by Jesus, descended and revealed to him the long-hidden "mystery," that is, the conflict between Light and Darkness, the origin of the world, the creation of Adam-in short, the essentials of what will later become the Manichaean doctrine; see Kephalaia (= H. J. Polotsky, Manichiiische Handschriften, vol. 1 [Stuttgart, 1934], chap. 1, pp. 14-15). On the date of the conversation with Shapur I, see Puech, Le Manicheisme, p. 46 and notes 197-84; the date April 9 was calculated by S. H. Taqizadeh. On Mani's last journey, see W. B. Henning, "Mani's Last Journey," BSOAS 10 (1942): 941-53. As for certain atrocious details of Mani's death (he was flayed alive, etc.), their authenticity seems to be suspect; see Puech, pp. 54-56.
232. Mani's writings have been analyzed by P. Alfaric, Les ecritures manicheennes, 2 vols. (Paris, 1918-19; on the later discoveries and the publications of F. W. K. Miiller, E. Chavannes, P. Pelliot, W. B. Henning, et al., see Puech, Le Manicheisme, pp. 144 ff. (nn. 240 ff.); Puech in Histoire des religions, vol. 2, pp. 547 ff.; and Widengren, Mani und der Manichiiismus, pp. 151-53; see also Ort, Mani, pp. 32 ff. Aside from Shiibuhragiin, dedicated to Shapur and composed in Middle Persian, Mani wrote, in Syriac or in Eastern Aramaic, "The Living Gospel," "The Book of Mysteries," the "Pragmateia" (or "Treatise"), "The Treasure of Life," "The Book of Giants," and the "Letters" (Puech, Le Manicheisme, p. 67 and n. 262). Among the texts attributed to the prophet, the most important are the Kephalaia, or "Chapters." Some texts, translated and commented on, will be found in A. Adam,

233. The myth is presented by Puech, Le Manicheisme, pp. 74-85, Widengren, Mani, pp. 43--69, and Hans Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, 2d ed. (Boston, 1%3), pp. 209-31. While insisting on the Iranian character of Manichaeanism (see also Les religions de l'Iran, pp. 331-41), G. Widengren has pertinently analyzed the Mesopotamian antecedents of certain personages and episodes in the myth; see his Mesopotamian Elements in Manichaeism (Uppsala, 1946), pp. 14-21, 25, 53 (the
"Mother of Life"), pp. 31 ff. (the "Prince of Darkness"), pp. 74 ff. (the "Messenger"), etc. See also W. B. Henning, "Ein manichaischer kosmogonischer Hymnus," NGWG 10 (1932): 214-28; Henning, "A Sogdian Fragment of the Manichaean Cosmogony," BSOAS 12 (1948): 306-18; A. V. W.

H.-C. Puech, pp. 611-16.
234. The image of Jesus Patibilis and, above all, the idea that making bread constitutes a sin since it implies "torturing" grain (see Puech, Le Manicheisme, p. 96) are reminiscent of certain archaic beliefs that
are an integral part of agrarian religiosity (see §§ 11 ff.). On the dissemination of Manichaeanism, see U. Pestalozza, "11 manicheismo presso i Thrchi occidentali ed orientali," Reale Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere 2d ser. 57 (1934): 417-79\ (republished in Nuovi Saggi di Religione Mediterranea, pp. 402-75); G.

H. W. Turner, The Pattern of the Christian Truth (London, 1954); A. Benoit, in M. Simon and A. Benoit, Le Judaisme et Ie Christianisme antique (Paris, 1968), pp. 289-90. In this book, Benoit remarks (p. 300): "It is necessary henceforth to renounce a simplistic and monolithic view of Christian origins. Though always appealing to faith in Christ, Christianity did not express it in a single and identical way: it is enough to think here of the different theologies that are found in the New Testament itself: Pauline theology, Johannine theology . . . ."

A good anthology of texts has been provided by Ernst Benz, Adam: Der Mythus des Urmenschen (Munich, 1955). Among contemporary authors, we mention the Catholic theologian Georg Koepgen, Die Gnosis des Christentums (Salzburg, 1939), who considers not only Christ but also the Church and priests androgynous (pp. 316 ff.). For Nicholas Berdyaev, too, the perfect man of the future will be androgynous, as Christ was; see his The Meaning ofthe Creative Act (English translation, 1955), p. 187 (originally published in 1916). On the symbolism of the Cosmic Tree and the "center of the world," see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, §§ 99 ff.; Images and Symbols, pp. 42 ff.

554 CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES
237. The long and complex process of assimilating pagan religious iconography and its symbolism by Judaism during the Hellenistic and Roman period has been brilliantly presented by Edwin R. Goodenough in the twelve volumes of his opus magnum: Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period (New York, 1953--65). See also Morton Smith, "The Image of God: Notes on the Hellenization of Judaism, with Especial Reference to Goodenough's Work on Jewish Symbolism," BJRL 40 (1958): 473-512. On "cosmic Christianity," see Eliade, Zalmoxis, the Vanishing God, trans. Willard R. Trask (Chicago, 1972), chap. 7. On the dualistic cosmogonies documented in the folklore of eastern Europe, see Zalmoxis, chap. 3. The problem of the Iranian contribution to Christianity has been briefly presented by J. Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancien (Paris, 1962), pp. 264 fT. (see p. 264, nn. 2-3, for bibliography). The earliest Christian sources that place the Nativity in a cave are the Proto-Gospel of James (18: 1 fT.) and Justin Martyr and Origen. Justin attacked the initiates into the Mysteries of Mithra, who, "instigated by the devil, claimed to perform their initiations in a place that they called spelaeum" (Dialogue with Tryphon, chap. 78). This attack proves that as early as the second century Christians perceived the analogy between the Mithraic spelaeum and the cave in Bethlehem. On the Opus imperjectum in Matthaeum and the Chronicle of Zuqnin, see Ugo Monneret de Villard, Le leggende orientali sui Magi evangelici (Rome, 1952), pp. 62 fT.; G. Widengren, Iranisch-semitische Kulturbegegnung in parthischer Zeit (Cologne and Opladen, 1960), pp. 70 fT.; Eliade, The Two and the One, trans. J. M. Cohen (Chicago, 1979), pp. 52 fT.

See also the works by F. Altheim cited above, especially Der unbesiegte Gott, chap. 7. A good synthesis has been provided by Andre Benoit in M. Simon and A. Benoit, Le Judaisme et Ie Christianisme antique, pp. 308-34, and he remarks (p. 328) that, "Whatever the case may be concerning the precise meaning and origins of the sign seen by Constantine, it is clear that historians will tend to explain it in terms of their general understanding of the Constantinian question. For those who think that Constantine definitely sided with Christianity in 312, the sign can only be Christian (see, among others, Alfoldi and Vogt). Those who think that Constantine did not side with Christianity in 312 regard the sign as either pagan or Christian and used to rally believers (see Gregoire). Finally, those who hold that, beginning in 312, Constantine evolves in a syncretistic perspective consider the sign ambiguous, polyvalent, able simultaneously to express paganism and Christianity.' ' On the history of Christianity in the fourth century, see the synthesis by Henri Marrou in J. Danielou and H. Marrou, Nouvelle histoire de
I'Eglise, vol. 1: Des origines a Saint Gregoire Ie Grand (Paris, 1963), pp. 263-72, 547-59 (bibliographies).
