The St. Vigeans Drosten Pictish Stone
Michel-Gérald Boutet, Drummondville, Québec, Canada, 2016
According to some scholars, the dedication found on the side of St. Vigeans Drosten Stone and inscribed in medieval Gaelic or Hiberno-Saxon script reads partially as Latin or Goidelic. Others argue that Pictish was a pre-Celtic language and that the inscriptions defy translation since written in non-Indo-European. Regrettably, this interpretation has only thwarted progress in the understanding of the Pictish language as a form of Brythonic. Also, Pictish stones are replete with symbols which are also found in other examples of Celtic Art from the Hallstatt and LaTène periods. Many scholars interpret these as a symbolical language describing a pre-Christian philosophy maintained through the Ages by the initiated elite of the Druids.
Iconography of St. Vigeans Drosten Stone
Pictish Art, although expressed in stone monuments from around the IVth to the IXth centuries CE, owes more to the complex linear and symbolic Celtic Art of the La Tène Iron Age period (from ca. 450 to 55 BCE) than to the Classical RomanoBritish Art of late Antiquity. Celtic Art was mainly characterised by its organic intertwining designs, its abstract symbols, zoomorphic and floral motifs, and by linear cartoonish characters and animals. Celtic Art not only celebrated life in all its manifestations, but was also the illustration of higher thought and philosophy. For example, trees and animals most often represent astrological and other cosmic concepts such as heavenly bodies, planets, stars and constellations. The authors of the Canmore site cataloguing Scottish archaeology have summed it perfectly:
“The interlace above the inscription is characteristically Pictish (see the crossshaft), but the trailing vine-leaf on the other narrow side is not Pictish but is characteristic of Anglian or Northumbrian sculpture of the later ninth century. The inscription and the art style of this stone therefore agree to date it approximately to the period 850-900 AD. It is probably nearer 850.”
Iconic symbology:
1. Circles intersected by a zigzag : the dual lunar-solar cycles crossed by the ecliptic and marked by the northern and southern lunar nodes; therefore, the solar wheel with the spiraling four seasons and the moon with the four time spiraling quarterly semesters; 2. Crescent : the time spiraling three main lunar phases; 3. Mirror : the light reflecting moon taken as a symbol for mind and soul;

4. Bear : Constellation of Ursa Major, the Septentrion; 5. Doe milking a fawn: probably the constellation of Leo which was called Elembiui Prinnios in Gaulish for “constellation of fawns,” elembos / elnbos “fawn;” 6. Dog or hound: Canis major, Sirius; 7. Eagle pecking a salmon: Aquila, Altair over Piscis Austrinus, Fomalhaut; 8. Goat : the constellation of Capricornus; 9. Archer shooting a boar: Constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius and Bow stars = Sagitta) and the Boar constellation (Ursa Minor). The Gaelic name Saighdéar or Saighdeoir derives from the Latin Sagittarius “archer,” as does the Welsh equivalent Saethwr; Saeth < Sagitta and Saethydd, Saethyddion < Sagittarius, “archer.” The true Gaelic word is boghadair, from the Old Celtic bogdarios. Another Old Celtic or Gaulish name for “archer” was uarcustos.
Hunting scene, top section: a hound chasing a dashing stag with a bear cub below. In Old Celtic, Sidos, “deer,” denotes the combined constellations of Libra and Scorpio, while it is also the name for the Otherworld realm.
Hunting scene, bottom section: Please note the archer aiming at a boar at the very bottom of the image. This could very well represent Forcus, the “Archer.”

The Pictish Language
The Northern tribes of Scotland, the Caledones or Caledonii, were later called Pictavi by the Romans and Piktiaid, Ffichtiaid, Cruitnigh by their neighbours. The Pictish language was spoken in Alba or Caledonia (Scotland, Highlands and Lowlands) and probably in some eastern parts of Ultonia (Future Ulster). Concerning Pictish, as with the other contemporary Celtic British languages, what can be observed is the loss of declensions. This clearly shows a definite degradation of the classic grammar as maintained by the former Druids. This being that despite of the survival of Pictish as an idiom, the Christianising process was long under way.
And as Joseph Monard remarked in his paper on Celtic grammar, the Pictish tongue of the Qureteni (as the Goidelic Scots called them) was a dialectal P-Celtic idiom. It was differentiated enough from the main British language in its particularities which can be glimpsed through certain place names, the late ogham inscriptions when not those of the kings lists maintained by the Gaels in Roman writing. Certain elements of Pictish are also suspected in some lexical peculiarities of the Qureteni Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages. A noted quirk in the ogham inscriptions of the Picts was the way of marking consonantal stress on letters such as d, t and r by doubling them.
For most experts, the case is settled, the Drosten Stone is in Latin bearing a certain Gaelic influence for the Pictish proper names. The argument being that the Pictish language could not have survived past the VIIIth as it was assimilated into Scottish Gaelic.
Translation of the Inscription
Thomas Owen Clancy, professor of Celtic and Gaelic at the University of Glasgow, has interpreted the text as Goidelic, thus reading Drosten, i ré Uoret ett Forcus which translates as: “Drosten, in the time of Uoret, and Forcus.”
In the abstract to his paper (p. 347), Clancy writes:
“This paper seeks to interpret the inscription on that stone as containing a Gaelic time expression coupled with a personal name: i re Uoret. This would allow for close dating of the stone, to 839 x 842, the dates of the Pictish king Uurad, son of Bargoit.”
One of the problems with this reading is that Clancy substitutes the ‘p’ for an ‘r’ in order to have it read as a form of Old Gaelic. However, the carver intentionally laboured to carve a ‘p’ and not an ‘r’ as it is evidenced in the graphic presentation of the letters. This unnecessary correction adds more to the confusion since the radical prefix ipe- is very acceptable in Pictish terms.

But then again, if we are to read ire- in place of ipe- as he proposes, this would yield a different interpretation giving it the meaning of “beyond or ultra.”
In Gaelic Roman script, from right to left, top to bottom:
DROSTEN IPEUORET ETTFOR CUS
Drosten ipe-uoret ett for-cus
Drosten < drustennos > drustannos “vigorous blaze, strong fire”; Drosten is akin to the Welsh Drystan.
Ipe-uoret
Ipe- Pictish prefix “all around, surrounding;” prefix ipe- < impe- / impi- > imp- ; c.f. ambi- > amb- / imb- / mbi- “circum, amphi-, around, surrounding, encompassing;” ambi- “both;”
Uoret < uoretos m.c.n. “rescue, aid;” uoretô, v. “to rescue, to help, aid, assistance;” most likely the personal name Ferat < Uurad < Uoret < Uoretos.
Ipe-uoret < impe-uoretos “surrounding help, aid, assistance;”
Ett-for-cus
Ett < eti “much, idea of excess;” Pictish form of eti < etic “and, also;” cf. Latin et, French itou.
For < uor- / uer- < *upper- “super, hyper, over;” cf. Gaelic for- / fer-;
Cus < cos, adverb “together;”

Forcus, Gaelic rendering of the Latin form Vorcus which probably derives from the Celtic name Uarcustos “archer,” and was later coalesced with the Old Irish personal name Fergus. It is doubtful that Fergus was spelled Forcus in Pictish since as a rule for the Celtic languages letter mutations shift from the harder devoiced consonants on to the softer voiced ones: p > b; b > ph/f; c > g; t > d; d > đ(dd)/z; u(w) > b/v, etc.
Forcus could also connote Uorcos / Uercos “work, endeavour,” adjective uercos/-a/-on, uerg-os/-a/-on “performing, working;” in word play with a hypothesised Old Pictish personal name in the form of *Uurcus, “archer.”
Translation
1. “Drosten both Uoret and Forcus.” 2. “Drosten all-around Uoret and Forcus.”
Connoting:
3. “Drosten in the circle of Uoret (Rescue) and Forcus (Archer).”
The Pictish name Drosten is related to the Welsh Drystan, both deriving from the Old Romano-British form Drustanus from the Celtic root Drustannos.
On a monument dating from around the sixth century found at Fowey Cornwall on the locale of Castle Dore and referred to as the stone of Tristan is recorded the mention:
DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOMORI FILIVS
“Drustanus, here lies, son of Cunomorus.”
During the XVIth century, John Leland recorded the following line which completed the mention concerning Drustanus:
CVM DOMINA OVSTILLA
“With his lady Oustilla.”
Oustilla is most likely the Latin form of Esyllt, Uiseult or Iseult / Yseut / Isolde.
Oustilla seems to derive from uistu / uissiu “vision” suffixed with superlative –illa “very, great, and intense.”
As for Essylt, it is probably from the Celtic compound name *Esuueleda “good lady seer, soothsayer.”
On the Pictish side, at the site of King's Cave, Blackwaterfoot, Kilmory, Arran, North Ayrshire, there is a similar name found on the wall of the cave which reads



6
as Fuedla > Vuedla > Uuedla > Uidela. A version of the name is found in Gallic epigraphy (La Vaissière, near l'Hospitalet du Larzac in France): uidluias / uidluas < Uidlueia < Uidelia “ghost, disincarnated soul.”
Whatever the original spelling, in both cases the name hints at a woman having divinatory or prophetic vision therefore a witch-type person.
Uoret, this is the old form of Uorad later spelled Uurad > Wrad and Ferat or
Ferach in Gaelic spelling. Uurad was the son of Bargoit and king of the Picts from
around 839 to 842. The three sons of Uurad competed for the kingship of the
Pictish throne along with another Bridei. Some believe that Bridei was the
brother of Talorgen and son of Uuthoil. He shared the throne along with Drest,
son of Constantin, between the years 834 and 836.
The name Bridei derives from Brigantis “overlord, gentleman,” and was used as a title to define chieftains, kings and noblemen.
Ciniod, Cinaed or Kenneth, from Gaelic Caioneach < *Counacos, for "handsome, comely one."
Tarlorgen is from Talarogenos “born at the border.”
Uuthoil, from Uuotalos “quite valorous,” suffixed as Uuotalios and punning with
Uotalos “two-faced.”
As for Bargoit, Bargod or Bargoch, it comes from the Celtic adjective barg-os/-a/on “clumsy, heavy-handed, undexterous,” suffixed –ocos for Bargocos or suffixed –atios for Bargatios, both meaning “the clumsy.”
Forcus is generally given as the Latinised Pictish form for the Old Irish name Fergus. Uorcos or Uercos and probably confused with Ferat or Vurad. Fergus, the Gaelic proper name Fearghus, is from the Celtic compound uiros, uiro- “man” and gustos / gustus “chosen;” from the PIE roots *wihro- “man” + *geus- “to taste.” The Pictish equivalent was Uurguist < Uirogutios “man of choice,” which is attested in a manuscript. On the Dupplin Cross monument at St. Serf's Church, Dunning, Perth and Kinross was inscribed a Latin inscription bearing the mention: Custantin filius Fircus – U... am... CD EFG.
From the lists of the kings of the Picts according to ancient annals based on the Pictish Chronicle Kings Lists:
Constantine son of Fergus 790-820
Constantine son of Vurguist / Urguist reigned 35 years. He was probably the son of Fergus who ruled Dál Riata from 778 to 781. In 811 Constantine himself
Custantin filius Wrguist xxxv. annis regnavit

succeeded to Dál Riata. Died in 820 Angus son of Fergus 820834
Óengus son of Fergus reigned 12 years Also King of Dál Riata. Died 834
Unuist filius Constantini, et Talorgen filius Wthoil iii annis conregnaverunt
Drust son of Constantine
834-837 (joint) Drest son of Constantine
and Talorcan son of Vuthoil reigned together 3 years.
Talorgen son of Fothoil 837

Uven filius Vnuist iij annis regnavit
Ferach son of Bargoch 839-842
Ferat son of Barot Wrad son of Bargoit Vurad son of Bargoit reigned 3 years and Bred one year.
Wrad filius Bargoit iii et Bred uno anno regnavernunt
Bruide son of Ferach 842 Brude son of Ferat
Ciniod son of Ferach 842843
Kyneth son of Ferat Keneth son of Vurad – one year Bruide son of Fochel 843845
Brude son of Fochel Brude son of Vuthoil – two years Drust son of Ferach 845847
Drust son of Ferat Drust son of Vurad – three years Ciniod son of Alpin 847858 (alias Kenneth I mac Alpin of Scots) Kenneth mac Alpin successfully united the Kingdom of the Picts with that of the Scots.
Cinaed son of Alpin Kinadius igitur filius Alpini.
Drust (or Drosten) was the last true king of the Picts. After the loss of his father Ferach, along with his two brothers Brude and Cinaed, and exhausted by the



8
bloody Viking raids, he called on the Scots of Dalriada for assistance. After the death of Drust in 847 CE, the Scottish chieftain Ciniod mac Alpin seized power and took the throne thus uniting the two kingdoms.
