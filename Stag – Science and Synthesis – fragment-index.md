pIoration, through physical and intellectual participation in worth-while projects of study and service, and the enjoyment of love and beauty. We should also start planning for social fulfillment through sane population policies; through creating cities which would be organs of civilized life instead of generators of frustration; through balanced land-use giving opportunities for solitude and enjoyment as well as for industry, building and communication. We must start thinking about how production could be properly organized so as to leave people free to devote most of their time of learning, teaching and aiding, to the enlargement of experience and the achievement of a greater sense of significance. Most people are prisoners of their conflicts and their own little selves; their primitive ways of thinking saddle them with guilt and make them project own repressed nastiness on to others. Already we know of various methods of achieving wholeness and self-transcendence: we must push ahead with the development of psychotechnology on a large scale. My brother Aldous in his last book, Island, has outlined various of the methods by which human beings could find fulfillment and wholeness and enjoy richer experience. On the world scale we must give effective expression to the central fact of the unity of man, while encouraging cultural variety. We must have a world population policy, and try to link all nations in unified projects of world development. I must end with one particular plea - that Unesco continues to promote the great debate which the Director General has today initiated. The building of a new organized system of thought and belief is the greatest task of this generation. I hope that Unesco will organize continuing discussion of the subject in all its Member States, in the world's main regions, and of course here at Unesco House. In so doing, it would emphasize its rightful function of intellectual, cultural and moral leadership in the realm of the human mind.
THE GREAT COSMOLOGICAL DOCTRINES
Giorgio de Santillana I am going to walk straight into my subject by the front door, the monumental portal of ancient Greece. We see before us the severe and spare architecture of the pronouncements of Anaximander, some 600 years before Christ - spare it most certainly is, for we possess only three or four phrases of his. "That of which all things are born is also the cause of their end, as is just, for they must make amends and expiate the injustices they did to one another in the order of time." All things are born and die in a universal rhythm, and so the first term of the equation is a law of periodicity. The second term - expressed in "as is just" - is a reminder of indwelling justice and an invocation of the sovereign

order of time. This is the very beginning of physics, with its opposing forces, its dynamic equilibrium which turns into a whirlpool and sets off the evolution of life, as is explicitly stated. Aristotle later forgort this idea and it did not re-emerge until Leonardo da Vinci. The substance of the whirlpool, a model of the spiral nebulae, is Apeiron, the boundless. This substance is also said to be the Divine, the Arche of all things - a word of pregnant meaning, if ever there was, signifying primacy, supreme power, principle and beginning. He goes on: "The Boundless understands and rules all things." The word used here is kybernai, to direct or steer. This rule is conceived, not as a voluntary action, but as self-regulating, which should be the case in a well-conceived society. This is an idea truly physical in its conception, although Animaxander did not have the words to describe it. These words are: automation and cybernetics - as you can see, it was all there in germ! And here, at a single stroke, a real physical principle emerges. Why does the Earth not fall down? Because it is located symmetrically relative to its surroundings. There is no sufficient reason why it should fall down. This is clearly the first draft of the principle of sufficient reason which Mr. Oppenheimer quoted when he was talking about Einstein. What a strange and wonderful beginning to come out of a purely vitalistic world! Under this particular negative aspect, this is the principle which releases the mind from good reasons in our own image and on our own puny scale and launches it into the immense adventure of science unbounded. A once-only chance, a throw of the dice which stopped men from dreaming about organisms and moved them to draw up their first model in terms borrowed from their technology: winds and coulds, sieves and whirlwinds. It was this model which steered them towards new horizons and new and burning questions - that intellectual acuity which is called Sophia. Here is the point of origin of scientific rationalism, an intellectual fever which can declare that what one thinks without contradiction must be able to be true, however strange and new it may be. On this foundation there arose another dazzling novelty, Pythagorean mathematics, hand in hand with the creation of the ideal of culture which the Greeks called mousike, which implies a combination of logos, melody and movement. So here we are already in the open sea of naked, materialistic physics, with the true powers of nature defined as harmony and proportion. Number is on the march, an autonomous force which is not an element like air or water"but a genuine principle with a life of its own; and this is right and proper for it represents the laws of thought. In this way physics itself becomes mousike and astronomy the royal art it always had been. Pure form and periodicity, these are the main themes laid down by geometry, and they led Aristarchus, 270 years before Christ, to propose the Copernican system. And so our cosmos was born, of which Kepler

2000 years later sings in the language of a prophet: "Behold, a light appeared unto me, the sun of truth. Nothing can now hold me back; the die is cast. I write for posterity. The Lord waited 6000 years for his works to be understood; I too can wait." This is his hymn to the harmony of the stars. But soon after this the harmony of heaven and earth was to be made discord; mechanics was to be born and Descartes would destroy the cosmos. Then, when the reign of Newton set in, the universe became a carefully wound clockwork mechanism and God a despot playing with his mechanical toy. Later still, things were to become more complicated; Mr. Holton is going to tell us about that, but this is where the idea of space has brought us, to the point where it receives philosophical affirmation in Einstein's total geometrization. Now let us go back to the beginning. Of Anaximander's four great phrases, two look forward, predicting modern space-based cosmology, and two look back to the traditional idea of the sovereignty of the Order of Time. For the fourth, which comes down to us through Cicero, states that, according to Anaximander, "the gods have their beginning at long intervals in the East and in the West, and they are numberless worlds." These strange words, of which Cicero said they were Greek to him, can be understood only in relation to an almost forgotten cosmology which comes down to us from the dawn of time and which survives only in myths and fables. It is the vestige of a technical language from before the invention of writing and which we are painstakingly trying to reconstruct. I shall therefore go back even further to look for the remnants of these beginnings. Would you like me to show you the thing in its primitive state? Here is a story from the Red Indians of the Canadian Pacific coast, one among thousands, picked almost at random, and to which nobody has paid much attention. It derives from the Satlo'lq Indians of the south-east of Vancouver Island. "Once upon a time there was a man whose daughter had a magic bow and arrow, but she was lazy and did nothing but sleep. Her father grew angry and said, 'Instead of sleeping, take your bow and try to hit the navel of the ocean, so we can have fire.' Now, the navel of the ocean was a big whirling funnel and there were bits of wood floating in it for making a fire. For at that time there was no fire. The daughter took her bow, drew it and hit the target and the sticks flew on to the shore. The old man was pleased and lit a fine fire. But he wanted to keep it for himself, so he built a house with a door which fell shut from top to bottom, like a jaw, and it killed everyone who tried to go through it. But the news went round that the old man had fire, and the Stag decided to steal the fire for the people. He stuck bits of resinous wood in his hair, then he bound two canoes together and built a bridge of planks between them, and he sang and danced upon it as he paddled towards the old man's house. He sang,



40 Science and Synthesis
'Ho, I am going to catch fire.' The old man's daughter said, 'Let him in, I like his song,' but the door of the house fell shut. Guided by his song, the Stag reached the door just as it was opening again and got inside without harm. There he leaned over the fire as if to dry himself, and the twigs in his hair caught fire. Thereupon he leaped out of the door, and this is how he brought fire to men." This is the Prometheus story in Satlo'lq. But it is much more as well. The Stag is not merely our heroic Prometheus (as described by Aeschylus and Shelley, just to get the record straight); he is Kronos, Saturn, the greatest of the earthly gods, the Cosmic Demiurge, Deus Faber. In the Hindu tradition, Kronos is called Yama and has a stag's head. This animal's head is found right through the ancient world. Now, if you care to look - only no-one ever doesin the Orphic hymns, you will find that Number 13 in the old Hermann edition is a hymn to Kronos: "0 thou, almighty devourer, ever-reborn Kronos, great Aion, venerable Prometheus" - in Greek, Semne Prometheu. Now, I did not put these words into their mouths. And Sophocles' Scholiast, quoting the lost sages, Polemon and Lysimachides, says that in the gardens of the Academy there was an altar dedicated to Prometheus, "first and most ancient holder of the sceptre", and to Hephalstos, "the second and younger". Now, those of us who are in the business know that Hephalstos appears as the second aspect of Saturn, or more specifically Demiurge, Deus Faber. But it is to the grim Kronos, the all-knowing, "the planner", that the Promethean prescience goes back. We are here in the basement of Greek antiquity and, by a strange subterranean route, it needed a primitive people from the other side of the world to draw our attention back to certain Greek texts which throw new light on the classical myth. As for Omphalos, the navel, there are whole books of studies on this. It is the island of Calypso, but also Charybdis of the Odyssey, the eye of the whirlpool (Maelstrom) of Indo-European tradition, the gurges mirabilis transpiercing the world and coming out in the Land of the Blessed which, of course, is in the southern heavens at Eridu, or else the ship Argo where sleeping Kronos is king; for the Hindus, Yama Agastaya; for the Egyptians, Osiris, judge of the dead; for the Babylonians, Ea-Enki; for the Mexicans, Quetzalcoatl- and many more. This, if we are to believe Dante, is where Ulysses went astray; it is where Gilgamesh lies seeking immortality at "the confluence of the celestial rivers". And what about those bits of wood in the whirlpool? This is the other whirlpool, the cosmic one, the Precession of the Equinoxes which was known even then and which, over a span of 26,000 years, establishes the Order of Time. This is where the primitive Prometheus is at home (Pramantha in the Indes), and the fires are not those of midsummer but of the passing of the equinoctal sun from one sign of the Zodiac into the next, which happens roughly every 2,400 years; the end of one "world", or era, and the beginning of the next.



The Scientific Synthesis 41
I would like to quote a line from the French poet, Agrippa d'Aubigne; he is writing about the end of one of these worlds:
" ... quand les esprists bienheureux Dans la Voie de Laict auront fait nouveaux feux ..."
(when the Spirits of the Blessed will have kindled new fires in the Milky Way.) This is the moment when, in Mexico, Tezcatlipoca lights a new fire by twirling his stick in the sign of the Gemini and "from this time on he was called Mizcoatl". After this, things become more complicated (I must ask you to be patient a while longer); the original fire of Mizcoatl was supposed to have been lit at the Pole, so it is not at all clear why it happened in Gemini at the same time, but this is attested by a number of ceremonies. One should perhaps see in this a kind of ambivalence or bilocation of the sacred fire which consecrates the equinoctal colure of this famous year zero, from which time was counted in Mesopotamia, in China and in Mexico, too: the solemn moment when the sun of the spring equinox passed under the sign of the Gemini and so, too, on to the Milky Way, and the great galactic arch (or bow) raised on the horizon made an almost complete circle, the equinoctal colure. This, indeed, marks the fundamental geometrical scheme of this cosmogony, as it is found more than once. Our story even has its proto-Pythagorean element. The rhythm of the Stag's singing and dancing becomes in another story from northwest Canada (British Columbia, Lower Fraser River) the prowess of the grandson of the Woodpecker who, on the point of drawing his bow, intones a song and, once he has found the correct note, the arrows which he shoots thrust one into another to form a bridge between earth and heaven. This is a truly Orphic theme, many times repeated, but also, as Sir James Frazer himself remarked, a lingering memory of the scaling of Mount Olympus in the Gigantomachia. So now you see where such a story, which appears to have neither head nor tail, can lead us. And yet, you will say, what a confusion of ideas! I quite agree. Still, we have to remember that their transmission was exposed to all the hazards of being passed on by word of mouth, of being forgotten and of being misunderstood. The very disorder only accentuates the authenticity of the component parts, the incredible pertinacity of certain ideas in surviving - surviving indeed their own meaning - like a sacred trust from lost ages. To continue, the bow and the arrow are constantly reaffirmed as basic images, keystones of the arch of theory; both are found in the heavens: the bow of Marduk, the Babylonian Jupiter, the bow celebrated by the Poem of the Beginning, with which he won power and established universal order. Then again, it is the bow the Chinese emperors received on their accession. With this bow one cannot fail to "hit" Sirius, "he" - so says the great Babylonian ritual

of Akitu - "who measures the depths of the sea". There have been many books written about this, too. But the Schlegels, the Guerins, the Gundels and all the great scholars who by their prodigious labors have elucidated this uranography, tend to be imprisoned each within his own province, be it Mesopotamia, India, Egypt or China, and each has instinctively claimed the privilege of discovery for his proteges, leaving to others the labor of building a bridge between these diverse civilizations. There have also been distinguished astronomers men like Biot and Henseling, whose books are no longer read and whose efforts at comparison have run away into the sand. It was, however, by repeated cross-comparisons that the meaning of these enigmatic words was ferreted out. The star, Sirius, has been an object of fascination in many latitudes and frequently obscure allusions are found to its links with the sea - right down to Aristotle and Pliny. Sirius seems to have been a kind of pivot for a number of intersecting lines drawn from various regions of the heavens. The main alignment places Sirius on the line joining the Poles, terminating in the south at Canopus. This is another very fascinating star, the seat of Yama Agastaya for the Hindus, the mythical city of Eridu for the Sumerians and for the Arabs Suhayl-the-Heavy, because it marked the bottom of the "celestial sea" of the southern hemisphere. The other alignments linked Sirius with the "four corners of the heavens", equinoxes and solstices which owing to the Precession were moving imperceptibly throughout the centuries; the line of the North Pole passed over all the stars of the Great Bear in turn, like a needle moving round a huge dial. It seems that these angular measurements were solemnly and carefully checked on high days and holidays. It was conceived that by means of Sirius the earth was indeed "anchored to the depths of the Abyss" and "hitched" to the southern heavens; through this star it was possible to check whether the universe was functioning properly. This, so far as we can divine it, was the mythical and ceremonial role of the Bow of the gods. Thus, the only originality of the Redskins seems to have been to place the bow in the hands of a woman, and a lazy one, at that! Is this a faint echo of Ishtar, the cajoler? I would prefer to believe that the Indian storyteller had his moment of invention. There are, after all, so few in this rigidly traditional poetry! To return to the door which shut like a trap, this is quite in keeping with Homer's Plangtai, the Simplegades of the Argonauts, the rocks-which-crashtogether, or even further back, in the primitive vertical figuration, it could be the Ecliptic, rising and falling on the horizon in yearly cycles, the object of innumerable parallel figurations spaced out over the continents since at least the fifth millenium. But then savages, of course, hadn't a clue about astronomy - you are quite right to remind me of this fact. True enough, they hadn't any more, and the people who did have this knowledge were not savages, no more than the builders of Stonehenge, although until last year the archeologists



The Scientific Synthesis 43
persisted in calling them "howling barbarians". But last year Gerald Hawkins, a young astronomer who knew his earlier colleagues by their works, came up with his ordinators. Sir Norman Lockyer had quickly been buried and forgotten, because philologists have very little in common with astronomers, but he has now had to be rehabilitated. I have offered you here a whole encyclopedia full of themes condensed into a dozen lines. I have made you a gift of one of those Japanese flowers, creations of folded paper which open into enormous patterns when you drop them into a bowl of water. The first opening of the Japanese flower can be seen in Lycophron's Alexandra, a conjuring poem of the Archaic myth; it opens a little more with Apollodorus' Bibliotheca, that reservoir of classical myths, and in Ovid's Fastes, the commentaries of Proclus and Porphyrius, and comes to its full blossoming, or almost, in the Dionysiaka of Nonnos the Panopolite, or the Tetrabiblion of Ptolemy, which are the true manuals of Archaic mythology. Now everyone knows that the innovator was Sir James Frazer, that tireless seeker after pre-classical antiquity; but, although he had a well-tended garden, with all the myths laid out in formal beds, he was not able to decipher their meaning, for he ignored the vegetation of the cults. There was, to be sure, a little hut tucked away in one corner where he could have found the tools and the plans, but Sir James didn't notice it. He was a full-blooded evolutionist and for him everything had to be either agriculture or magic. I do not wish to detract from the virtues of Cook or Jane Harrison and all their school, but if they had had fewer pre-conceived ideas they might have found, in addition to the annual cycle recorded in the vegetation, other cycles of 2, 4, 8, 12, 30, 52 and even 60 years which had quite a different significance and could only be planetary cycles. But there it is, in all the excitement of a new idea a lot of things are overlooked and the problem of dealing with the loose ends is left until later. I have given you an example of how a universal mythical language, predating written records, has been found to conceal a lost cosmology which was also universal- quite as universal as the one we have today. Not the least of the mysteries involved is how these ideas traveled by diffusion from protohistoric Mesopotamia, since it seems to have been here that the planetary cults - which Aristotle attributes to the panpalaioi, the most ancient - and protoPythagorism, too, first came into existence. What was diffused clearly was not ready-made ideas, but patterns: the Ecliptic and its constellations, the positions of the heavenly bodies, the celestial zones, certain key myths and all this curious urano-geography where heaven and earth meet under the domination of the sovereign planets in their inexorable courses. Then again, it was the link between harmony and the heavenly bodies, harmony and units of measurement, the sovereign principles of precision, called maat in Egypt, rta or rite in India. "Between the music of the ritual pipes and the calendar" - says a Chinese proverb - "the adjustment is

so fine one could not draw a hair between them." And in just this way alchemy was adjusted to astrology, then astro-medicine, plants, metals, alphabets, learned games like chess, magic squares like the one recorded in Durer's Melancholia - the microcosm adjusted to the macrocosm. The whole thing was not set out like a system of logic, but like a fugue in music, as befits a genuine selfregulating organism. This world was not merely determinist but pre-determined - on a number of interacting levels; it was a world supersaturated with determination, where total necessity is queen but freedom yet remains, as with Spinoza's God. "And they say," remarks Aristotle the Modern without too much charity, "they" being the Pythagoreans, "that the interval between the letters alpha and omega is the same as that between the top and bottom notes of the aulas, and that the number of them is equal to the heavenly choir." Thus, these ideas persisted right into classical times, thanks to the fervency of the Pythagoreans. We still retain from it number and rhythm, the incidence of the unique moment, the idea that the time is ripe, the kairos, as the Greeks called it, which decides between being and non-being. There was a time when justice was above all justness and to be inexact was a sin. Since Descartes, we moderns think in terms of simple space, something we can dominate and where our actions are recorded. Archaic man thought in terms of time dominating all else. And indeed, what we persist in regarding as "distances" in his system are really angular measurements which change with time. Spatial order as we understand it is meaningless; for him, it was modulated entities, intervals on a vibrating string, spheres, triangles, magic squares, polyhedra. Even for Plato, pure space, what we would call Newtonian isotropic space, was the nearest thing to non-being. Parmenides himself was unable to give his Being a being other than by assigning him bounds in the form of a sphere. It was said in China, "The sovereign rules over space because he is master of time." This is the way mankind thought during as many centuries as separate us from the Great Pyramid. This thinking was totalizing, if we may borrow the term from Levi-Strauss. The Order of Time, which was the true cosmic order, governed the fate of lives and of souls. It supplied an eschatology as well as a science to generations without number in the dim and distant past. If we now seek to recover it, the reason is that we hope to restore their true shape to civilizations long buried and forgotten; whole contintents long classed as having no history are now stepping on to the world stage, armed with fresh claims and ready to reassume their proper role in the history of our species. Our ancestors said to themselves, like Cocteau, "Since these mysteries are beyond us, let us make ourselves organizers of them." What we have here is thrilling material, only just beginning to be deciphered; however, our generation has brought up reinforcements, names like Hartner, van der Waerden, von Dechend, Needham, Werner, Marius Schneider, forces assembled from all points of the intellectual horizon.



The Scientific Synthesis 45
What we need now is a convergence of ideas, disciplines and methods, as well as the aesthetic intuition to enable us to unravel this Art of the Fugue and to comprehend, as d'Alembert once said, "our forefathers to whom we owe everything and about whom we know nothing".
WHERE IS REALITY? THE ANSWERS OF EINSTEIN
Gerald Holton To do justice to any part of Einstein's work is of course not possible in a talk. But on an anniversary occasion such as this, one can do two things. First, one can celebrate a great and good man; and while Einstein has no need of our celebration, and was always rather amused by this sort of affair, we are right to do it because it is good for us to remember him. And secondly, one can try to add something to what is already known, thereby making an offering, a wreath of flowers from one's garden. This is what I want to present here today - a chapter in the history of ideas that illuminates Einstein's pilgrimage from a philosophy of science in which positivism was the center, to one in which the center was a rational realism. To the extent that it is possible without unduly neglecting the major published contributions on this topic, I hope to use here the unpublished scientific correspondence and other documents in the Archives of the Estate of Albert Einstein at Princeton which I have recently been studying and helping to order for scholarly purposes. 1
1. Philosophical Background
If one studies Einstein's earliest papers on special relativity from a philosophically critical point of view, one can discern the influence of many, partly contradictory, points of view - not surprising in a work of such originality. There are debts to Hume and Kant and Poincare, for example. But perhaps the most important of these influences was that of the empirio-critical positivism of the type of which the Austrian philosopher Ernst Mach was the foremost exponent. Let us remember the philosophical background of that period. The 1890's and 1900's were a time of turmoil not only in physics but also in philosophy of science. There were vociferous opponents of kinetic, mechanical, or materialistic views of natural phenomena. They objected to atomic theory and gained great strength from the victories of thermodynamics from Carnot on, in which knowledge or assumptions about the detailed nature of the material (e. g. in understanding heat engines) were not needed at all. In the late nineteenth century the critics of the mechanical interpretation of physical phenomena included W. Ostwald, Helm, Stallo, and Mach. Their positivism provided an epistemology for the new, phenomenologically based
