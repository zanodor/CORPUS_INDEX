NATIVE CALENDAR SYSTEMS
Native Calendar Systems
1. Day : Sun; Rainbow; (Moon) (Short Earth Day Count)
2. Night: Moon; Planets; Stars; Milky Way Contours. (Short Earth
Night Count)
3. Seasons: Often 4 basic Element related. Hot; Dry; Cold; Wet.
(“Elementary Count”)
4. Earth Solar Day Year: 365.2 days; Earth solar orbit. (Middle Earth
Count)
5. Earth Cosmic Night Year: Stars; Constellations; Milky Way
Contours. (Long Count)
AD: Measuring methods.
1. Measuring and marking the daily rise, the noon and the setting of
the Sun.
2. The same, except from the Sun, goes for # 2.
3. Measuring and marking the cycle of Solar high- and low rises,
noonʼs and settings throughout the year.
4. Same as # 3.
5. Measuring a specific Star turning back to the same local marking
point.(Often a stone)
Worlds:



Many ancient cultures basically divided their cosmos in 3 Worlds or
primary dimensions, namely:
1. The Upper World
2. The Middle World, and:
3. The Underworld
World Explanations:
These 3 prime Worlds or dimensions all again could be divided in
furthermore 3 sub dimensions, telling of 9 Worlds or dimensions in
all.
The main division was/is based on the on your geographical location
of observation – where ever you are located on the Earth. This World
is always The Middle World, as for instants with the Midgaard in
Norse Mythology where humans etc. etc. are living.
A part of the Night Upper World is the one of the Heaven where the
“Light Beings”; the Moon; Planets; Single Stars and Star
Constellations can be observed. (This goes of course both for the
southern and northern hemispheres). In the North Mythology, this
World/dimension is called the Asgaard.
- Another part of both the Upper- and Underworld deals specifically
with the giant whitish colored (mythologically, often also described
as the Night Rainbow) contours of the Milky Way which is the largest
figure/structure on the night Sky.
The Upper- and Underworld is of course divided accordingly to the
day- and night view where the Sun; Moon; Planets; Stars; Star
Constellations and Milky Way Contours are rising above and setting
below the actual horizon, “going up and under” down in the



Underworld.
The farthest part away in both the Upper- and Underworld is called
the Udgaard in Norse Mythology where all the Giants/Jaetter lives.
These mythologically human- ; animal-; and anthropomorphic beings
are of course named Giants because they belong to the giant figure
of the Milky Way. “Ud” is Danish for “out”, meaning in this matter
“long distance away”.
- From these basically and physical observations, all the Myths are
being constructed all over the World – though: Together with
spiritual meditation and visions where an individual were/are in direct
contact with specific forces of Creation, a spiritual overlay of telling
was/is added to tell of the very Story of Creation. A story that deals
with the very basics of elementary creation, again very often
described with “deities names with elementary qualities” of fire,
water, soil and air, a telling which is very recognizable when first
observed in almost every mythological telling from all cultures all
over the World.
MEASURING THE DAY AND THE YEAR.
It is my belief that most of the ancient cultures have used the Sun as
a Calendar system. But even in our time there are religions who
determine their rituals according to the Moon, for instant the
Christianity where the Moon moves the Christian celebrations from
year to year.



From the time where people become more settled and agricultural, it
was expedient to be able to measure the Sun trough the year.



The left drawing show the cardinal directions in order to measure
and mark the seemingly movement of the Sun trough the day and
year. Compared to a Rock Carving from Madsebakke, the Island of
Bornholm, Denmark.
A very simple system of Sun measuring is to set a pole on the
favourite spot and mark the shadow of the Sun trough the day and
year.
The famous Megalith monument of Stonehenge could very easy



have started as a wooden henge of poles as shown above.
A monument from Jantar Mantar, India, measuring the Sun positions
trough the day and year.
In order to follow the cycles of the day and night and the year, you
have to mark the movements of the Sun and the Stars. That is just
what our ancestors did by setting at stone or a pole and marking the
Sun shadow on different positions.



The oval shaped figures above has been mentioned as a "stone row
ship setting". The oval shaped structures of stones are often
interpret by modern astro-archaeologists as having an astronomical
function, which very well can be the truth because you can get the
specific shape by setting a stick in the ground to mark the
movements of the Sun throughout the day and the year. Picture 2 is
a Danish ship- like rows of stones from Glavendrup, Denmark.



This animation shows how the shape to the Stone Row Settings and
the shape of the Viking Ship appears. In the centre, a pole is
standing and the lines in the periphery marks the different Sun
positions throughout the day as well the year. If one imagines both
the oval shape and its different shadow markings as the origin figure
to the later material Viking Ship, you even get the Shields on the side
of the Ship from the Sun marking points in the oval shape.
THE WHEELS OF CREATION AND THE CALENDAR WHEELS.
Every old culture have their Story of Creation. Even the Bible have
descriptions of the Calendar Wheels and Wheels of Creation in the
Book of Ezekiel: "Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one
wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces".
And: "The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
colour of a beryl . . .". Several times Ezekiel talks about "the
firmament" which of course is a Story of Creation and how the
different Wheels moves in the movement of Creation.



WHEEL 1: Milky Way Directions and The 4 ANIMALS
1. Sagittarius (Centre) 5 The Bull
2. Gemini 6 The Lion
3. Virgin 7 The Serpent
4. Pisces 8 The Horse
In order to be able to follow the seasonal changes, the positions of
the Sun was marked with 4 stationary stones. If a more precise
calendar was wanted, the wheel could be divided into 4 more
stationary stones. These extra 4 markings was very often depicted
as "the 4 animals".



THE EARTH POSITION IN OUR GALAXY.
The Earth orbit around the Sun shows the stars in the Zodiac and the
stars shows the directions in the Galaxy which are very important
according to the Story of Creation. The most important direction is of
course the direction to the centre of the Galaxy in the Star
constellation of Sagittarius, The Archer, who hit the centre of the
target, the Milky Way Centre.
Many old cultures used the bright stars of Vega and Sirius as a



guideline towards the centre in our Galaxy where the direction from
Sirius over the polar centre to Vega pointed to the galaxy centre in
the star constellation of Sagittarius.
In order to mark the precession movement in the Milky Way Wheel, 1
object in the calendar system should be placed and moved 1 degree
every 72. years because of the difference between the Solar Year
and the Celestial Year. It was/is of course very important to move
these markings. Otherwise the cultural society would get out of
synchronization with the story of Creation, which is specially
connected to the Milky Way facts.
Many astro-archaeological scientists overlook very often the fact,
that many cult places, churches and temples also have the
cosmological data of our Galaxy build in the structure of the
buildings. Even though many astro-archaeological scientists are
mentally minded to use alternative approaches and ideas in order to
analyze the meanings of the old buildings and cultural places, it is
very seldom that the scientists recognizes that our Forefathers, in a
simple intuitive and spiritual way, could experience the cosmological
data concerning the position of our Solar system and its position in
our Galaxy.
