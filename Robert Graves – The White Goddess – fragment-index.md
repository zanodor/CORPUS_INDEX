# Index for Robert Graves – The White Goddess – fragment.pdf

Where else shall we walk in peace, to andfro, on fertile ground? Who but I can take you to where the stream runs, or falls, clearest?
Or who but I tell you the age ofthe moon ? Who but I can bring you Tethra's cattle from the recesses ofthe sea? Who but I can draw Tethra's cattle shoreward? Who can change the hills, mountains or promontories as I can ?
I am a cunning poet who invokes prophecy at the entreaty ofseafarers. Javelins shall be wielded to revenge the loss of our ships. I sing praises, Iprophesy victory. In closing my poem I desire other preferments, and shall obtain them.
The original five-lined pendant to the poem may have run something like this:
A / am the womb of every holt, O / am the blare on every hill, U / am the queen of every hive, E / am the shield to every head, ' I / am the tomb to every hope.
How or why this alphabet of thirteen consonants gave place to the alphabet of fifteen consonants is another question, the solution of which will be helped by a study of Latin and Greek alphabet legends.
That the first line of the Song of Amergin has the variant readings 'stag of seven tines' and 'ox of seven fights' suggests that in Ireland during the Bronze Age, as in Crete and Greece, both stag and bull were sacred to the Great Goddess. In Minoan Crete the bull became dominant as the Minotaur, 'Bull-Minos', but there was also a Minelaphos, 'StagMinos', who figured in the cult of the Moon-goddess Britomart, and a Minotragos, 'Goat-Minos' cult. The anders found in the burial at New Grange suggest that the stag was the royal beast of the Irish Danaans, and the stag figures prominendy in Irish myth: an incident in The Cattle Raid of Cuailgne, part of the Cuchulain saga, shows that a guild of deerpriests called 'The Fair Lucky Harps' had their headquarters at Assaroe in Donegal. Oisin was born of the deer-goddess Sadb and at the end of his life, when mounted on the fairy-steed of Niamh of the Golden Hair and sped by the wailing of the Fenians to her island paradise, he was shown a vision: a hornless fawn pursued over the waters of the sea by the red-eared white hounds of Hell. The fawn was himself. There is a parallel to this in the Romance of Pwyll Prince of Dyfed: Pwyll goes out hunting and meets Arawn King of Annwn mounted on a pale horse hunting a stag with his white, red-eared hounds. In recognition of Pwyll's courtesy, Arawn, though sending him down to Annwm—for the stag is Pwyll's soul216



permits him to reign there in his stead. Another parallel is in the Romance of Math the Son of Mathonwy: Llew Llaw in the company of the faithless Blodeuwedd sees a stag being baited to death: it is his soul, and almost immediately afterwards he is put to death by her lover Gronw. The fate of the andered king—of whom Cernunnos, 'the horned one' of Gaul, is a familiar example—is expressed in the early Greek myth of Actaeon whom Artemis metamorphosed into a stag and hunted to death with her dogs. She did this at her anodos, or yearly reappearance, when she refreshed her virginity by bathing naked in a sacred fountain; after which she took another lover. The Irish Garbh Ogh with her pack of hounds was the same goddess: her diet was venison and eagles' breasts. This ancient myth of the betrayed stag-king survives curiously in the convention, which is British as well as Continental, that gives the cuckold a branching pair of anders. The May-day stag-mummers of Abbot's Bromley in Staffordshire are akin to the stag-mummers of Syracuse in ancient Sicily, and to judge from an epic fragment concerned with Dionysus, one of the mummers disguised as an Actaeon stag was originally chased and eaten. In the Lycaean precinct of Arcadia the same tradition of the man dressed in deer skins who is chased and eaten survived in Pausanias's day, though the chase was explained as a punishment for trespassing. From Sardinia comes a Bronze Age figurine of a man-stag with horns resembling the foliage of an oak, a short tail, an arrow in one hand and in the other a bow that has turned into a wriggling serpent. His mouth and eyes express an excusable terror at the sight; for the serpent is death. That the stag was part of the Elysian oracular cult is shown in the story of Brut the Trojan's visit to the Island of Leogrecia, where the moon-oracle was given him while sleeping in the newly-flayed hide of a white hart whose blood had been poured on the sacrificial fire. The stag-cult is far older than the Cretan Minelaphos: he is shown in palaeolithic paintings in the Spanish caves of Altamira and in the Caverne des Trois Frires at Ariege in the French Pyrenees, dating from at least 20,000 B.C. The Altamiran paintings are the work of the Aurignacian people, who have also left records of their ritual in the caves of Domboshawa, and elsewhere in Southern Rhodesia. At Domboshawa a 'Bushman' painting, containing scores of figures, shows the death of a king who wears an antelope mask and is tighdy corseted; as he dies, with arms outflung and one knee upraised, he ejaculates and his seed seems to form a heap of corn. An old priestess lying naked beside a cauldron is either mimicking his agony, or perhaps inducing it by sympathetic magic. Close by, young priestesses dance beside a stream, surrounded by clouds of fruit and heaped baskets; beasts are led off laden with fruit; and a huge bison bull is pacified by a priestess accompanied by an erect python. The cults of stag and bull were evidently combined at Domboshawa; but the
