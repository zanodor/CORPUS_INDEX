Aproject of this magnitude contains numerous surprises. I had thought
that I was fairly well acquainted with Japanese mythology, having spent
years studying contemporary Japanese religion and beliefs. As the writing
of this book progressed, so too did my horizons expand. Heretofore obscure fig
ures took on flesh and color. Places I had been in and cursorily viewed, as tourist
or researcher, took on new importance. In this volume I’ve tried to communicate
some of the complexities and excitement of these (re)newed discoveries.
It is useful to start, too, by saying what this book is not. First and foremost,
this is not an exhaustive description of Japanese mythology. Given the Japanese
happy multiplicity of deities and other mythological figures, that would be
impossible. The key word here is the Japanese concept yaoyorozu-no-kamigami:
the eight million deities. Even with ruthless pruning, I ended up with more
entries in the second section than my editor, Bob Neville at ABC-CLIO, was
happy with. In a complex and conceptually rich culture such as the Japanese,
that is not at all surprising.
What this book is, is a traveler’s guide. It is here to point out the main fea
tures of the mythical landscape that is Japan and to relate it to the main actors,
on the one hand, and to the anchor of the contemporary mundane world, on the
other. The book thus has been organized into four main sections. Chapter 1, the
Introduction, is intended to embed the main concepts of Japanese mythology in
the historical, social, literary, and political matrixes from which it emerged. In
this chapter, as throughout the book, I have taken the word Japanese in its broad
est context, to refer not only to Japanese culture, but to the two other cultures
that share the same land: Okinawan and Ainu. I have also, throughout the vol
ume, made an attempt to relate features of these three cultures to one another,
both in their similar features and in their contrasts. Japanese mythology itself is
a composite of a number of elements, and the mythology derives from complex
and varied sources. These too have been addressed in the Introduction.
Whereas Chapter 1 provides a context for Japanese myths, Chapter 2
describes the various myths themselves. The broad strokes of the description
xv
PREFACE



provide an overview without going into too many details. This chapter is the
matically divided into two: a retelling of the Shintπ myths, and then of Buddhist
ones. It is immediately apparent that Shintπ mythology is far more “coherent.”
That is, there is a continuous story into which specific myths fit, more or less,
whereas Buddhist mythology is far more fragmented. The reader must keep in
mind, however, that this is to a very large degree the effect of editing. The orig
inal recorders of myths selected and edited the myths they wrote. In the interest
of providing a coherent description for the reader, so did I. Neither time nor
space in myth is constrained by physical time, space, or causality. Things hap
pen simultaneously, and prime causes are obscure or are told in different ways
by different persons. And, inevitably in a print medium, some sort of order must
be imposed if only to be able to put it down on a page. The time and space of all
myths must therefore be seen as mythical time and space: They are congruent
with “real” time and space only in a limited sense.
Chapter 3 contains an alphabetical listing of the major concepts and figures
in Japanese mythology from all three cultures. Though I have devoted a great
deal of thought to choosing those entries, the list, as all such lists are, is proba
bly idiosyncratic to some degree. Nonetheless, most of the central mythological
figures are noted. At this point it is worth warning the reader that many Japan
ese figures, mythological as well as historical, have numerous names and are
referred to under several names in the same source. Thus the deity ∏kuninushi
is referred to throughout most of his adventures as Onamuji. To compound this
problem for the writer and the reader is the issue of orthography. There is no sin
gle, agreed-on way to spell most Japanese classical names in English (nor, for that
matter, in Japanese in some cases!). After a great deal of consideration, and in the
interest of simplicity, I have compressed all lengthy names (many of them
descriptive) into a single word, and then hyphenated the titles added to the
name. Thus ∏kuninushi’s name might also be spelled O-kuni-nushi, Okuni
nushi, and ∏kuni Nushi in different sources. Here I’ve elected to choose ∏kun
inushi.
The fourth chapter of this book is concerned with sources for further and
detailed study of the features of Japanese mythology. Here too, the list of sources
is not exhaustive. More obscure English-language sources, as well as those that
are highly technical, have not been included. Because this book is for English
language readers, I have included only a scattering of references from non
English European languages, choosing those that are either absolutely necessary
as references or that might be easily accessible to the reader. Finally, some Japan
ese sources, a mere mouthful of the plenitude available, have been selectively
included for those willing (and able) to pursue that avenue. The reader is warned,
however, that some of the issues in Japanese mythology are still “hot,” politi

cally and socially speaking, in Japan, and the views the reader will encounter
will often be contentious and conflicting.
The advent of information technology has been both a blessing and a curse
to the researcher. On the one hand, the World Wide Web has allowed wide access
to an enormous pool of data and information. On the other hand, the Web is a
catch-all: Anyone can post anything, and much of the information posted is
uncritical. I have included a number of significant websites in Chapter 4, but the
reader is warned that (a) some of these are misleading, and (b) websites come and
go: New ones will emerge, better than the ones that existed when this book went
to print. Some of those listed here will, in the nature of things, disappear.
As with all books, several people have contributed or assisted in the prepa
ration of this manuscript, though, as all authors do, I take responsibility for all
omissions and commissions within. My editor, Bob Neville, who commissioned
this book, supported the writing cheerfully and ensured that even when I felt I
was being overwhelmed, I was kept on an even keel. Michelle Asakawa, the copy
editor, did a sterling job of untangling my often convoluted sentences and keep
ing an eagle eye on the minutiae of naming conventions, hyphenation, and syn
tax. Many thanks are owed her for a painstaking and professional job that greatly
improved the book. Great thanks, as usual, are owed to my wife, Jeanne, who put
up with blank stares, mumbled replies, and screams of “Amatsumikaboshi?
Who the hell is Amatsumikaboshi? I can’t keep track of all these people!” that
were emitted irregularly from my study. Steve Fletcher and Sven Griesenbeck,
librarians at Regent’s College, tracked down a number of obscure works and pro
vided them for me. My friend Asakura Hisashi took time from his own work to
help with providing Japanese material, as did Mrs. Taketomi Yoshiko, a friend of
my mother’s who provided a very necessary Japanese book. My mother, Dr.
Zafrira Ashkenazi, has, as always, been an intellectual foil and goad and, in the
case of this book, provided encouragement and material assistance for which I
give many inadequate thanks. And finally, I’d like to thank all those many ordi
nary Japanese people, who over the years have provided me with information and
support concerning their beliefs and religious habits. Minasama, dπmπ arigatπ
gozaimashita.

1
INTRODUCTION
“Be careful of the snake,” Mr. Takayama said conversationally. We
were passing beneath a large cryptomeria on our way back from a
purification ritual he had conducted in a small shrine set among
ripening rice fields.
“Where?” I looked down, expecting the snake to appear, fangs dripping
venom, from between the gnarled roots.
“Oh, he’s around somewhere,” Mr. Takayama said vaguely. “I just didn’t
want you startled. I’ve already warned the people at the shrine.”
Behind us, a small group of people—farmers mostly—milled around the lit
tle wooden model building that served as a shrine. Before it two rather ratty ban
ners fluttered in the breeze.
“It’s very bad to hurt one of these snakes, the ones that live in the cryp
tomerias near shrines. They are always messengers of Ry∆ jin.” Mr. Takayama led
the way along the narrow path that headed for his car. It was a ten-minute ride to
the city, whose buildings were clearly visible before us. During the ride, he told
me the story of Ry∆ jin, how this dragon kami (deity) lived in a lake crater in the
extinct volcano about thirty-two miles away. He dropped me off in front of an
electronics store, where a neon dragon flashed on and off, advertising the shop.
For many modern Japanese, the relationship between myth and life is a
complex one. Myth consists of stories about nebulous and concrete beings and
items. It also consists of beliefs about origins—of the Japanese people, of their
customs and culture—which are unquestioned, often unquestionable. And few
Japanese will admit to “believing” in these myths. They simply act as if they
do. To complicate things still further, religion and ritual, household practices
and national ones blend in subtle and unpredictable ways. Mr. Takayama, my
priest friend, was at one and the same time a serious believer in the dragon
kami and dismissive of what he called superstition and superstitious prac
tices, which he decried very strongly. To him, the foundations of his ritual
practice were not mythical: They simply were, and he wished every person
that came into his orbit, to perceive things as simply as he did himself: an
1



unbroken continuity between humans and deities, and between humans and
other forms of life on the planet.
Myths, as understood in this volume, stand at the intersection of a num
ber of narrative forms. On the one hand is the category of the folktale, oral sto
ries that are repeated in some traditional format. Quite often they are mythical
in character (speaking of deities, causes for things, and morals), and sometimes
they are mere entertainment. Many such folktales were collected by Japanese
folklorists, particularly in the first half of the twentieth century, when the oral
traditions started disappearing with the advent of radio, television, and other
forms of entertainment. Another narrative form popular in Japan is the ghost
story. Traditionally told in midsummer in order to send a chill down the lis
tener’s back (a simple form of air-conditioning!), ghost tales often came from a
Buddhist tradition concerned with the afterlife and with the consequences of
acts in one’s lifetime. A third important narrative form are “official” myths,
often recorded by, or at the instigation of, persons in power with the intent of
creating charters for political and social circumstances. All of these forms con
tribute to a culture’s mythology. The mythology in this volume acknowledges
the many sources, oral and written, folk and elite. To keep things fairly con
sistent and clear for a nonspecialized audience, many “alternative” versions
have been ignored, or merely mentioned briefly in order to provide a coherent
picture.
TRANSLITERATION OF JAPANESE TERMS
The Japanese language is easily transcribed into English. All the consonant and
vowel sounds of Japanese are common to the English alphabet, and there are also
fairly regular rules about the relationship between consonants and vowels: No
consonant except “n” can appear on its own after a vowel. All consonants except
“n” must be followed by a vowel. There are five vowels: a, e, i, o, u, pronounced
roughly as they would be in English. The only difficulty for the English speaker
is the existence of double vowels: oo (a long “o” sound, not the “u” sound), ou,
and ee (double “e,” not “iy”). These have been indicated in the text with
macrons: π, ∆, §.
Japanese names given in the text are given in the Japanese order: surname,
then personal name, thus Minamoto (surname) Yoshitsune (personal name). His
torical names usually have the possessive “no” between the surname and per
sonal name: Minamoto no Yoshitsune. To make reading easier, hyphens have
been used to join the parts of a single name: Amaterasu-π-mikami.
2 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



MYTHOLOGY AND THE JAPANESE WORLD
Japanese mythology is a misnomer in at least two ways. First, rather than there
being one coherent mythology of the Japanese people, there are in reality a mul
titude of them. There are a number of different mythological traditions, some
recorded in writing (and of use to politicians and ideologues), others stories that
individuals tell one another, and which the experts often dismiss as “folk tradi
tions” rather than “proper” mythology. The mythologies of small villages, and
of minority peoples of the Japanese islands—the Ainu and the Ryukyuans—are
sometimes not considered, in some fashion, “properly” Japanese or “properly”
mythology. Second, even recorded “proper” Japanese mythology—whatever that
means—is a compendium of mythologies of local origin and those that come
from other traditions, largely India and China, but even the West.
To complicate matters, the term myth itself can be confusing. For our pur
poses here, myths consist of two elements. One element is the story-telling part.
Myths almost always consist of stories with a supernatural (i.e., the intervention
of powerful, autonomous entities) component. These stories can be lengthy
epics or brief anecdotes. In this, it is difficult to distinguish between myths, leg
ends, ghost stories, and fairy tales. Myths, however, have a second component as
well: They generally have an intellectual component that provides a structure to
people’s lives. The people concerned might be individuals, or they might be an
entire culture. Myths are ways in which people explain to themselves who they
are, what they are doing, and why. Though no myth does all of these things, the
corpus of myth, however contradictory and fragmented, offers individuals an
inventory of explanations about how things come about, and why and how they
themselves came into being as the end product of a lengthy (therefore,
respectable, worth adhering to and defending) process. Many of the myths dealt
with throughout this book are in a familiar narrative structure: Some individual,
under certain circumstances in the misty past, performed some action, whose
social, physical, material, and/or ideological consequences are visible to us here,
today. Other myths, however, have no narrative. They are descriptions—in
verse, sculpture, painting, or architecture—of features of the universe, the cul
ture, the history. To give an example, there are no “stories,” in the conventional
sense, of one of the main Buddhist figures, Kannon. There are, however, lengthy
descriptions of her qualities and nature. And, of course, Kannon appears in
numerous myth stories about other people, usually as savior and supporter. To
understand these different types of myth in the Japanese context, we discuss
their emergence at greater length below.
In more mundane terms, Japanese myth, particularly in its function as a
social and political charter, has been extremely important. In the early ninth
Introduction 3



century two families, the Takahashi and the Imbe, vied for the position of impe
rial family chef. To bolster their claims, each cited their clan myths as justifica
tion. Far more recently, in the 1980s, a Japanese government minister cited the
Japanese uniqueness myth as justification for limiting imports of meat. Perhaps
none of these parties were “believed” by their audiences, but the cited myths,
nonetheless, were conceived of as powerful and compelling arguments.
Great Tradition and Little Traditions
In the early twentieth century, Yanagita Kunio, and later Origuchi Shinobu,
started collecting the folklore of the peasants and common people, which Yana
gita believed were rapidly disappearing. Yanagita in particular felt that this folk
lore was the “original” and “authentic” folklore of the Japanese people, and
thus was the essence of the traditional and real Japaneseness that formed the
Japanese nation. Many of the myths Yanagita and Origuchi collected were
unique to specific locales, stories that did not necessarily reflect the things
taught about and repeated in schools that were becoming the traditions of
Japan, at least according to the government. Surprisingly, many of these myths
contradicted the established myths that are recounted in monumental compi
lations of Japanese traditions such as the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki. These had
been republished and republicized in the eighteenth century as part of an ideo
logical effort to “renovate” Japanese society. To explain these contradictions, it
is useful to turn to a set of terms credited to American anthropologist Robert
Redfield. More or less a contemporary of Yanagita’s, but working in Mexico,
Redfield coined the terms “Little Traditions” and “Great Tradition,” which
will be of use to us here.
“Little Traditions” are sets of local beliefs and practices that are to be found
in all human groups, but which are particularly prevalent in communities that
are relatively self-contained, even if not isolated. Little Traditions vary from one
community to another, tend to be very flexible and changeable, and are rarely
recorded since those repeating them are often illiterate. They focus on the imme
diate concerns of these communities: family, social responsibilities, agriculture,
and health. The Little Traditions are in effect the mythology of the common
people.
In contrast, the “Great Tradition” of a nation or culture tends to be written,
printed in books, codified, almost frozen. It is controlled by the elite (who are
generally literate, and always powerful) and tends to serve their purposes: the
glorification of the nation, the religion, the culture in terms that they, the elite,
determine for their own ends.
4 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The relationship between Little and Great Traditions is dynamic. The Great
Tradition tries, through its main supporters, the literate elites, to mobilize peo
ple for the ends of the entire society that they lead. The Great Tradition incor
porates elements of local stories and myths insofar as they can be used to
support the central myths of the elite and of the nation. Little Traditions feed
into the Great Tradition but often deal with themes that are not central to the
Great Tradition—hunger, local patriotism, the concerns of farmers and produc
ers—or even antithetical to it, through themes of rebellion. At the same time,
Little Traditions may take and adapt myths that derive from the Great Tradition
for their own local purposes.
Little Traditions and Great Tradition in the Japanese Context
In the Japanese context, localism has always coexisted uneasily with
“Japanism.” That is to say that it was in the local community—the buraku
(hamlet) and the ie (household)—that most personal interest was focused on and
most emotional investment was given to. The larger community—the nation or
the han (feudal domain)—were of less concern to most individuals except those
in power. As a direct result of this dichotomy, the central government (when it
was powerful and able to do so) was at pains to try and “nationalize” local myths
to engender and strengthen a nation rather than a collection of separate com
munities. In such a ferment, it is not surprising to find that the same deity may
play several different roles and have several different identities and names, or
that different deities will be subsumed into the same one and different myths
“amalgamated” into one myth that serves the interests of those in power.
External Sources of Japanese Traditions
Japanese traditions, including the mythical, were influenced by a number of
external sources. Two of these, because they were traditions of literate cultures,
are well documented and relatively easy to trace. Both India and China con
tributed to Japanese myths and enriched them substantively, largely through the
vessel of Buddhism. There are also traces—less well documented, far more dif
fuse—of two other traditions: Ainu mythology is a crystallization and expression
of traditions that can be found in many neighboring cultures such as the Okhot
skian and Tungus cultures to the north and northwest of Japan. It is also possi
ble to trace similarities between Japanese myths—for example, the myth of the
creators of the land, the brother-sister combination of Izanagi and Izanami—and
Introduction 5



myths from the proto-Polynesian cultures of the island chains that stretch
southward from Japan, through the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and the Philippines,
where this myth (along with others) is retold in many variants.
Chinese Sources
One of the greatest influences on Japanese mythology has been the mythology of
neighboring China. Chinese mythology was composed, itself, of a blend of two
traditions. One was the native tradition of gods (shin) arranged in great arrays of
heavenly officials, princes, and generals, headed by a supreme Jade Emperor, or
Celestial Emperor, who ruled the heavens, as the earthly Chinese emperor was
supposed to do on Earth, with virtue and benevolence. A large number of local
deities and saints—some of them historical persons of verified existence, whose
virtues impressed their peers—were assimilated into this pantheon in the form
of celestial officials.
The other tradition was that of Buddhism, itself a distillation of earlier
Hindu traditions mixed with some Central Asian and even Persian myths. Bud
dhism introduced new deities and concepts, new sages and saints into China,
and they too assumed the form of a celestial bureaucracy, coexistent with, or
identified as, the native one.
As all mythologies, Chinese conceptions of the mythical world were based
on people’s perception and understanding of the social world that surrounded
them. One of the major social features of the traditional Chinese world was the
imperial government system. Although the emperor was supreme, he was
expected to govern by virtue, and he was in principle the head of a bureaucracy
whose office-holders acquired their posts by merit. In formal terms, a system of
strict (and difficult!) examinations open to all males allowed every individual the
chance to become an official. The humblest farmer’s son, could, in theory,
become the chief minister of the empire. Thus Chinese mythology expresses
official positions within the celestial government’s bureaucracy. This bureau
cracy was divided into departments and bureaus, just as the material world’s
imperial government was.
For all its adherence to parts of the Confucian ethic, Japan never evolved a
meritocratic examination system. Clan and family membership and relationship
to the ruler were far more important. Moreover, outlying parts of the Japanese
state, though always expressing deep loyalty to the emperor, owed actual fealty
to their immediate clans, and later feudal lords.
The mythological differences between the two sociopolitical systems are
reflections of this. When Japanese borrowed mythological figures from China (as,
for example, the conversion of Ch’ung-chuan into Shπki Demon-queller), much of
the rationale for the person’s deification vanished, because Japan had no compara
6 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



tive bureaucratic system. As a result, mythological figures in Japan assumed differ
ent degrees of importance and even play different roles than their Chinese originals.
Indian Sources and Buddhism
India had a thriving literate culture well before the emergence of the Japanese as
a nation. Indian Buddhism had adapted and built upon the earlier mythological
tradition of Hinduism. Indian mythology included references to a pantheon of
powerful, well-defined gods. Many of the chief deities of Hinduism—Brahma the
Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, Indra the Fort-Breaker, and even many of the
demons—were harnessed as Buddhist figures: lower than the Buddhas them
selves, but nonetheless powerful and worthy of respect. Introduced into Japan via
China, these figures and deities became figures in Japanese mythology as well,
under Japanese names and with Japanese attributes, but clearly sourced from a
rich Hindu and Indian tradition. Here too, social differences between India and
Japan—the absence of a caste system, for instance—meant that the imported
deities are found in different niches than in their original homeland, with corre
sponding differences in the myths told about them.
The Myth of Japan
One of the primary myths the Japanese ascribe to is the myth of Japan. In this
view, Japan is a nation alone, unique as to culture, special as to its place in the
world, inscrutable and homogenic. This is, of course, part of the Great Tradition,
and it is what has come down to us in the form of written documents; the Kπjiki
and Nihonshπki texts, which we discuss later, are two examples of that. The
Great Tradition of Japanese myth is very much alive in modern Japan. Most
Japanese will still subscribe to some version of the following:
• Japanese language is unique, without any similarities beyond the slight
traces to other languages.
• Japanese culture, and particularly the way of thought of the Japanese, is
incomprehensible to other people. This is particularly true with regard to
Japanese communication, which relies strongly on unspoken, felt emo
tions transmitted between people who share them: the Japanese people.
• The origin of the Japanese people is unique.
• The course of Japan’s cultural development was largely unrelated to
developments elsewhere in the world.
And quite a few will agree that the complex of physical traits Japanese peo
ple have is homogeneous and unique. Thus, over the past five decades, books
Introduction 7



have come out in Japanese explaining the uniqueness of the Japanese by their
supposed unique gut length, hair color, blood type, or physical brain structure.
None of these views, it so happens, is true. These beliefs are, however, held
because the elite—the bureaucracy, academics, religious figures, even show
business figures and foreign reporters—will often repeat these mythical details
as if they are true. To a certain extent they are, but only if one adds numerous
qualifications. For our purposes in discussing Japanese mythology, they are
mythological facts that derive from, and sustain, the presence of many of the
detailed “story” myths we shall examine here. To do so, we must now turn to
some of the features of Japanese society that give birth to Japanese mythology.
JAPANESE TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY
Japan is a large archipelago running from tropical seas to arctic ones along the
east coast of Asia. The archipelago is composed of four major islands—Honshu,
the largest and most populous; Kyushu; Shikoku; and the most recently
“Japanized” one, Hokkaido—along with numerous smaller ones. The islands are
volcanic in origin, and active volcanoes still erupt from time to time. Signifi
cantly, mountain ranges criss-cross the country, isolating some communities,
and these mountains have always been a locus of mythical activities.
The land is also very fertile as a whole, and early Japanese (as well as their
modern descendants) rightly view it as a source of plenitude and bounty, which
it generally is, notwithstanding historical famines and infertile rocky areas. The
topography is not all benevolent. A Japanese saying, “Kowai mono yotsu: jishin,
kaji, kaminari, oyaji” (There are four frightening things: earthquake, fire, thun
der, and daddy), exemplifies the feeling that nature was dangerous as well as
benevolent (and, of course, that the pater familias was the dominant figure in
everyone’s life).
Although from a social or economic viewpoint Japan’s most important geo
graphic features are its fertile plains and river valleys, which produced wealth in
the form of grain for food surpluses, the most important features from a mythi
cal viewpoint are its mountains. The most famous of these is Mt. Fuji, a near
perfect, snow-tipped cone that is visible (pollution and weather permitting) from
Tokyo, over sixty miles away. This and many other mountains are associated
with mythical events and beings, and mountain deities feature prominently in
ritual and myth—probably because, though often impenetrable and difficult to
reach, mountains loomed close to centers of population.
Another geographic feature that has been traditionally important, both cul
turally and for myths, is the sea. As an island people whose livelihood and lines
8 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



of communication were often associated with the sea, the Japanese unsurpris
ingly made the sea a locus of belief, practice, and art. The Seto Inland Sea, locked
between the islands of Kyushu, western Honshu, and Shikoku, is particularly
important, because many of the events of the national foundation myth happen
on its shores, islands, and many bays.
The Japanese islands are sufficiently close to the Asian mainland that they
can be reached by four land bridges—that is, by moving from land mass to land
mass via relatively narrow water passages. Just off the western tips of Kyushu
and Honshu islands one can reach the Korean Peninsula in a modern ship in
twenty-four hours. To the south, Kyushu dwindles into a series of fingerlike
peninsulas from which one can island-hop through the chain of Ryukyu Islands
to Taiwan and on to Southeast Asia via the Philippines. To the north, a string of
islands visible from the northern tip of Hokkaido stretches via Sakhalin Island
to the Asian mainland at Kamchatka, and another arc of islands off the eastern
corner of Hokkaido leads to the Kuriles and the Arctic Ocean. These island
bridges have been the highways across which the prehistoric settlers of Japan
moved to the islands. One of these bridges—the passage to Korea—has been par
ticularly important in providing cultural influences throughout history. It thus
also features heavily in myths.
Besides the mountains and the Seto Inland Sea, the most important area for
Japanese myths is the Yamato Plain (around the modern city of Nara) and the
mountains and valleys surrounding it. This is a lush area that runs down from
mountains on all sides to the usually quiet Inland Sea. To the southeast are the
wild forested mountains of Kumano and the Kii Peninsula. To the east, beyond
a range of high mountains, is the largest lake in Japan. Named Lake Biwa for its
resemblance to a Japanese lute, its shores and the valleys around it have been the
source of stories and lore for centuries. To the north and northeast are other
ranges of mountains bisected by valleys. Both forested mountains and cultivated
valleys provide the backdrop to many of the country’s myths.
Far to the east lies another huge, fertile plain: the Kantπ. Though this is the
economic and political center of Japan today—one small fishing village named
Edo evolved into the de facto capital and, finally, changed its name to Tokyo in
the nineteenth century—in the past it was the source of opposition to imperial
control, a land of vagabonds, rebels, and the headquarters of the warriors who
eventually wrested all real power from the imperial court. The wide Kantπ Plain
runs for 180 miles almost due north, and its villages and towns provided both
economic and military power for Japan’s rulers after Japan’s Middle Ages.
The rest of the country replicates the geography of the Kantπ and Yamato
(now part of the Kansai) areas: wide alluvial, fertile river valleys bordered by
forested mountains, some of them quite impenetrable. Even in the twenty-first
Introduction 9



century, some areas of the mountains are relatively unvisited, and there remains
room for mythical occurrence.
The northernmost island of Hokkaido is slightly different from the other
three main islands. Most significantly, it was the last to be settled by the Japan
ese proper. Until the nineteenth century its forests were prowled by bears and
deer, and its rivers teemed with salmon. It was also far colder, covered by a
boreal forest of pines and other needle-leafed trees. Besides the giant brown bear
(a relative of the American grizzly) it was also home to giant owls and sea eagles,
and not very well suited to rice agriculture. Its Ainu inhabitants, unsurprisingly,
spent their lives hunting and gathering for a living.
In contrast to the boreal northern island, the southern islands that are strung
like pearls between Kyushu Island and Taiwan were quintessentially tropical.
Now Okinawa prefecture, the Ryukyu Islands grow pineapple and sugar cane
like many other tropical islands. In the past, their inhabitants relied heavily on
fish and on rice farming, and the difficulties of making a living in such restricted
landscapes led to poverty and inequality. Beautiful as the islands are, they sup
port a large population with difficulty. Speaking a different language (about as
close to Japanese as Provençal is to French), the Ryukyuan culture developed in
a different form than the Japanese, though incorporation into the Japanese state
obscures this.
POPULATION
The population of Japan is probably a fusion of people who used all four of the
land passages (the Kuriles, Sakhalin, Kyushu-Korea, and the Ryukyus) to reach
these fertile shores. There is some evidence of linguistic, cultural, and genetic
ties to peoples from the west—Koreans, Manchus, and Chinese—the south
proto-Polynesians who arrived in prehistoric times, and whose descendants were
probably the Kumasπ of Japanese myth—and the north—the Emishi and Ezo
natives, ancestral to the Ainu as well as to the Japanese. The homogenization of
the Japanese people was the result of political expansion of one central state
the Yamato—which, for political reasons, was loath then (as the current Japan
ese government is loath today) to acknowledge internal heterogeneity. “Strange”
or “foreign” groups were incorporated into Yamato social forms and forced to
politically, socially, and culturally join the Yamato state. Groups that did not do
so were marginalized or destroyed, as happened to nomadic groups of hunters,
gatherers, and craftsmen, and to the Ainu.
The cultivation of rice has great importance culturally and mythologically. It
has also had a major effect on the population of the Japanese islands (and, of course,
10 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



on other places as well). Briefly put, growing rice permits greater population
growth than most other grains. This has meant that notwithstanding occasional
famines, the Japanese islands were and are able to support a large population.
Japanese society emerged from small local groups who had to depend heav
ily on group effort to survive. Space in river valleys is limited, rice requires care
ful water management, and horizons can be restricted both emotionally and
economically. These local groups were often isolated in their river valleys.
Strangers and outsiders were a class apart, whether as hinnin (outcast wanderers)
or as wandering deities (marebito). In any case, powerful and dangerous itinerant
strangers feature prominently in the Japanese consciousness.
The fact that agriculture could be practiced very successfully in the river val
leys has also had an important political consequence. Surpluses garnered by pri
mary producers—that is, farmers—could be converted to cultural artifacts and
thus gave rise to privileged nonproducing classes. Thus several versions of social

family farm near Mount Fuji. (A. Tovy/TRIP)



history could exist simultaneously: one for farmers on the land; one for city
dwellers, made possible by surplus from farming; and for the ruling classes, enjoy
ing surpluses created by farmers and townspeople alike. Quite often, the mytholo
gies that emerged served as part of the glue to keep the whole system together,
forging a single national entity. For example, the existence of a single prosperity
god—Inari—across most of Japan helped make possible a certain national unity.
And many other myths reflect the population realities of Japan: Hunger, rebellion,
the lives of urban dwellers, and many other themes are reflected in myth.
JAPANESE HISTORY AND TRADITIONS
Like many other mythologies, Japanese mythology takes place against a back
ground of real events. In fact, at least some of the heroes of Japanese myth are
real historical personages. The following brief history emphasizes two aspects:
the social and political context, and the evolution of Japanese religion. For con
venience’s sake, Japanese history has been divided into periods that more or less
coincide with the types of myths encountered, rather than the more common
divisions used by historians.
Archaic Period: J ̄omon, Yayoi, and Kofun (Approximately 1000 B.C.E. to 650 C.E.)
The coasts of Japan are littered with huge mounds composed of sea-shells—the
detritus of thousands of years of Neolithic hunter-gatherer dinners. Some of
them are about five acres in extent. That’s a lot of sushi dinners. These Neolithic
people entered Japan along the chains of islands that link it to the mainland,
finding a welcoming and fertile ecology. They mainly lived in pit dwellings that
were probably communal. A large pit about six feet deep was dug in clay and
roofed over with a system of posts and grass thatch.
This culture evolved into a more sedentary farming population called by
anthropologists the Jπmon culture. Sources of food were expanded, and agricul
ture—perhaps developed indigenously, perhaps influenced by migrants from the
continent—started being practiced. Larger villages came into existence in some
places. This culture lasted from about 1,000 B.C.E. to about the third century B.C.E.
Jπmon culture is reflected in a rich assortment of artifacts and probably was very
heterogeneous. There are remains of pit dwellings, of long-houses, and of villages.
Large shell mounds and other middens indicate the Jπmon survived on a mixture
of dry farming and hunting-gathering, much like the Ainu of later centuries. The
12 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Jπmon also produced pottery in amazing variety and quality. (The name Jπmon,
meaning “rope-mark,” was given them by archaeologists who noticed the many
pieces of pottery marked with a ropelike pattern. We do not know what, if any
thing, they called themselves.) Much of this pottery includes animal- and human
shaped masks and dolls. Presumably they had an elaborate mythology, and possibly
that mythology was the forerunner of the Japanese mythology we know today.
Around 250 B.C.E., new groups of Asian immigrants entered the Japanese
islands, largely from Korea and the northeastern Asian mainland, or else internal
developments in Jπmon society brought about a radical social and cultural change.
Called the Yayoi by archaeologists, the new culture or people were a different ket
tle of fish entirely. They had bronze and iron technology and, no less important,
the use of the horse. They had learned about irrigated agriculture, which meant
they had the knowledge to produce a surplus far greater than the more hand-to
mouth Jπmon people. Most important, they were organized into clans composed
of mounted warrior-aristocrats, common people, and a lower stratum of slaves.
Perhaps the Jπmon people found themselves at the bottom of the heap, and this
made for some strong resistance. Perhaps development was uneven in the Japan
ese islands, or perhaps there was (as some archaeologists claim) a lengthy period of
population movement. Certainly the myth of Yamato-takeru (which we will dis
cuss in the next chapter) indicates that the Jπmon culture people did not accept the
impositions of Yayoi culture lying down! The Yayoi clans contested for territory,
and an early Chinese record of Japan notes the large number of independent sov
ereignties into which southwestern Japan, at least, was divided at that time.
The arrival of this new culture brought about significant changes. The new
political system was far less egalitarian than the Jπmon culture. The new culture
also brought with it a network of ties to the more politically complex Korean
kingdoms, and through them, to the mighty Chinese empire with its culturally
sophisticated ideas. It was a short step from squabbling clans to the establish
ment of complex kingdoms, with palaces, courtiers, and the varied apparatus of
state. By about 250 C.E., large tumuli tombs called kofun, echoing Chinese and
Korean models of the time (similar mound tombs can be seen in Kyongju, Korea,
and near Xian, China), were erected to commemorate powerful kings in several
of the small kingdoms that divided up much of Kyushu and the Inland Sea coast
of Honshu. The Kofun period thus is named for these large keyhole-shaped and
moat-girded tombs established by the Japanese monarchic states.
Yamato emerged as a powerful kingdom in central Japan. It had located itself
on a fertile, wide plain not far from the sea. Having a great deal of surpluses at
their disposal, the Yamato rulers were able to dominate their neighbors. Yamato
did so both militarily, as the myths of Jimmu Tenno and Yamato-takeru show us,
and by political alliances, cooptation of neighboring clan chiefs, and the practice
Introduction 13



of impressive rituals. When all else failed, it even resorted to assassination.
When it began expanding, the Yamato kingdom was organized as little more
than an enlarged clan. The emperor or empress (until the arrival of the patriarchal
Chinese political system, one was as likely as the other) was the head of the dom
inant clan and therefore the head of the state. There were few courtiers or officials,
and clans of warrior-aristocrats were relatively free to control their own domains
and, in fact, impose their own economic or political systems. These clans were
supported by estates worked by attached peasants. Some of the clans, notably the
clan that ruled Izumo, brought their gods with them when they joined the Yam
ato kingdom, and room had to be found for those deities in the official accounts.
The proximity to the Asian mainland brought about changes. As the king
dom expanded and became richer, the demand for luxuries grew. Specialist crafts
men immigrated from Korea and China. These did not fit into the clan pattern,
and the solution was to establish special autonomous corporations of craftsmen,
sometimes with grants of land, so they could practice their crafts. These craft cor
porations produced pottery, cloth, and other luxury items and built the aristo
crats’ palaces. There was the beginning of a standing army, as well as written
laws, taking over from customary tribal law. The influence of the mainland, par
ticularly China, did not end there: It extended to political and legal models, and,
no less important, to the importation of a whole new religion: Buddhism.
The Roots of Empire (Approximately 500–781 C.E.)
Toward the end of the Kofun period, in the sixth century C.E., the capital—which
had moved from one place to another with the death of each reigning emperor
was established at Nara. The cost of moving the entire court, dismantling the
great halls and rebuilding them, was possible in a small clan-dominated system
but impossible in an administrator-centered government, with its attendant
officials and records. Great palaces and temples were built, based on Chinese
models. One of these, the Tπdaiji, houses to this day an enormous bronze Bud
dha, tribute both to the craftsmanship of that era and to the penetration and
dominance of Buddhist theology in the court’s life. Court life was regulated by
rituals managed by a clan of ritual specialists, the Nakatomi. Other clans spe
cialized in administration or warfare. All of these required an elaborate economy
to support them.
Seventy years after the establishment of the court at Nara, the transforma
tion of the Yamato kingdom into the Japanese empire was complete. A new cap
ital, designed on a grid pattern and arranged in accordance with feng-shui
principles, was established to the north of Nara, in an auspicious cup of moun
14 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



tains facing south, and called Heian-kyπ: Tranquil Capital. A proper bureaucracy
based on the Chinese model was established. Laws were codified. Land was
made the property of the emperor, and he—from this point on, virtually all
emperors were males—granted its use as he felt necessary. Slavery, never a
prominent social feature, was in effect abolished. And Buddhism became a major
religious, literary, ethical, political, and even military influence.
In the early sixth century (521 according to some sources, 528 according to
others), a Korean king of Paekche introduced the Japanese court to Buddhism,
sending an image of the Buddha, some priests, and copies of the sutra (Buddhist
canon) to the Japanese court. One of the aristocrat-administrator clans, the
Soga, promoted the new practice, building several temples. The indigenous rit
ual specialists, headed by the Nakatomi clan of priests and ritual specialists,
were concerned about their possible loss of power and influence. So were the
Mononobe clan of royal guardsmen: If the Chinese model of government would
be adopted, they would become bureaucrats and retainers, rather than a free
clan giving military and other service to a paramount chief. A running battle of
several decades and two generations ensued. The Soga (their motives were more
political than religious), aided by a certain Prince Umayado, second son of a pre
vious emperor, finally defeated the Nakatomi-Mononobe coalition in battle,
aided, it is said, by the appearance of two Buddhist warrior-deities. Buddhism,
which was in general favor at court (its rituals were impressive, it had written
books, and its promises of a better afterlife were extravagant compared to the
native belief in a dark, cold underworld that local myths spoke about) was sup
ported openly, and eventually became, in effect, the court religion. Unsurpris
ingly, the Soga clan chief immediately deposed the emperor and put his own
puppet, Suiko (who was also his niece), on the throne. Surprisingly, Prince
Umayado not only broke with his Soga relatives but actually, through a combi
nation of political acumen and sheer magnetic personality, blocked the Soga
grab for power and established a reasonable and balanced governmental system
based on Buddhist ethics (which he published in a seventeen-article rescript, or
public announcement) but giving scope for native observances. Prince
Umayado, better known to millions of Japanese as Shπtoku Taishi (his posthu
mous Buddhist name), a brilliant scholar and skilled administrator, became
chief minister and regent to Empress Suiko and oversaw the massive overhaul
and Sinicization of the government system.
Native Japanese religious beliefs became known as Shintπ, or Way of the
Gods, to distinguish them from Butsu-dπ, or the Way of the Buddha. Contrary to
the practice with religions in the West, this new religion neither superseded nor
was expected to supersede traditional ritual and religious practices. Instead, the
two religions were gradually blended, place being found for both. The end of the
Introduction 15



religious contest was marked by the emergence of two bodies of writing. One
consisted of translated and native Buddhist writings, including the seventeen
article rescript and translations of the sutras. The other was the recording in the
early seventh century of compilations of chronicles of the Japanese nation, its
myths and history (though the two were not distinguished), the Kπjiki and
Nihonshπki compilations (of which more later) being the most prominent.
These two bodies of literature allowed for the development of both Buddhist
and Shintπ traditions. And along with them came several theories that
accounted for the blend of Buddhism and Shintπ. These, generally known as
honji-suijaku theory, eventually agreed that the Japanese kami (deities) were
the local-national aspects of the Buddhas, who were the universal aspect of the
kami. All nice and tidy.
Religiously this period is characterized by the gradual domination of Yamato
myths and religious practices over those of other states and polities, and by the
introduction of Buddhism. The states overcome by Yamato in its gradual rise to
supremacy in the islands had their own tutelary deities, myths, and supporting rit
uals. In very broad terms these were similar to those of the Yamato, if different in
detail. Some vestiges of these myths can be found in Little Tradition practices; oth
ers, such as the mythology of ∏kuninushi (whose cult is centered at Izumo-taisha,
a major shrine northwest of Yamato), were incorporated into the Yamato mythol
ogy. The struggle for dominant mythologies was also a political one: Ritual and its
motivating myths were embedded in the state apparatus, and whomever controlled
the rituals the emperor carried out had a great deal of control of the emperor him
self, a feature that reemerged from time to time to the present century.
The Aristocratic Period (Approximately 650 C.E.–1185)
As mentioned earlier, the Yamato state established a stable capital at the new
city of Nara in 712 C.E. and then in 781 C.E. moved the court to a new city named
Heian-kyπ. The period of foundation of these cities marked the gradual emer
gence of the Japanese empire from the Yamato state. The city of Heian was built
according to Chinese principles—its back to a northern mountain, a square-grid
pattern of streets, a central palace following feng-shui geomantic principles
and this, the Heian period to historians, was the high point of emulation of
things Chinese. More significant than the buildings, however, were the bureau
cratic and administrative changes.
The emperor headed a state bureaucracy modeled on the Chinese one in all
respects save for the all-important one of promotion by examination and merit.
The aristocratic clans were converted into a civil bureaucracy, with administra
16 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



tive offices in government they were entitled to fill. The Heian aristocracy num
bered little more than 20,000 to 30,000 people. Outlying provinces were consid
ered the wilderness, and one of the worst punishments for an aristocrat was
banishment to Kyushu or the wilds of northern Honshu. The precarious hold of
the central government on outlying provinces, some of which were controlled by
the central government in name rather than in fact, is reflected in the mythol
ogy of that time. It is a mythological period of heroes who, (usually) operating
under imperial license, set out to restore order in the world. Heroes such as
Tawara Toda and Raikπ, either by themselves or together with bands of no-less
famous retainers, subjugate rebels and bandits (the two terms are often synony
mous) and add to the emperor’s dominions. Things are not, of course, so simple:
Tawara Toda toys with the idea of joining the rebels but is repelled by the rebel
leader’s perceived meanness. Very clearly loyalty to the emperor takes second
place to personal success. Nonetheless, most of these myths are very similar,
and they are summed up in a legend known to every Japanese: the legend of
Momotarπ.
An elderly childless couple, after living a virtuous life and praying to the
gods, find a giant peach floating down the stream. From the fruit pops a baby,
whom they raise. When he is older, the child—now named Momotarπ (Peach
boy)—hears of an island of evil demons who terrify and dominate the country
side. Taking his wooden sword, a store of millet dumplings, and a banner made
by his mother saying “First in Japan,” he sets off to find the island. Along the
way he encounters a bird, a monkey, and a dog, whom he treats kindly and with
whom he shares his food. He and his loyal retainers reach the island and defeat
the demons. Some of them agree to become peaceful beings, and Momotarπ is
rewarded for his victory.
The heroic mythology of the aristocratic period frequently repeats this story
line, indicating perhaps that not only was the country unsettled and wild but
there was plenty of scope for individuality and individual action, so long as it was
away from the court. For, back at the capital, the Heian period was a period of
intense cultural flowering. Poetry, painting, literature, and ritual flourished. The
world’s first novel, Genji monogatari (Tale of Genji), was written in this period
by a court lady. Reminiscences and diaries, and new forms of poetry and painting
prospered during this period. The court and the aristocrats isolated themselves
from the reality of the countryside, concentrating on ritual and aesthetic pursuits.
So long as the rent in rice and labor from the domains continued to arrive, they
could ignore anything outside the capital. Most tried to avoid traveling more than
a hundred miles from the court. Many considered distant Ugo (modern Tohoku
in the far northeast of Honshu) and the island of Kyushu to be the outer darkness:
a realm of bandits and uncivilized boorish and savage warriors.
Introduction 17



Like many such enclosed environments, the Heian court created the seeds
of its own destruction. The Heian period ended with squabbles between aristo
crats, which escalated as the squabbling parties brought in their own “barbar
ians”: the warrior descendants of exiles, lower-class aristocrats, and the
mythological heroes who had maintained their military abilities on the periph
eries of the empire. The rural warriors—referred to somewhat contemptuously
as samurai (temple servitor)—hardened by fighting among themselves and by
wars of subjugation against the Emishi (Ainu tribes on Honshu) and the
Kumasπ (other native tribes in Kyushu), were hard to control. So when the aris
tocrats entered into squabbles among themselves, some were careless enough
to invite their country-bumpkin cousins to do their fighting for them. The
results were predictable. In the Onnin War the capital and imperial palace were
burned. Further squabbles made the situation worse, and the Gempei war

between two powerful coalitions of rural families spelled the end of the Heian
period and its elegance.
The Medieval Period (1185–1600)
By the twelfth century, squabbling Heian aristocrats had called their own doom
upon themselves. Accustomed to calling in their rough country cousins to help
settle disputes, they discovered to their horror that the rough warriors—the
bushi—had no intention of relinquishing control. To add to the aristocrats’ woes,
Buddhist monasteries, the supposed embodiment of peace and harmony, had
established their own armies of sπhei (monk-soldiers), who terrorized the aristoc
racy to the point that Heian, the capital itself, became a ghost town at one stage.
The fighting bushi (warriors) eventually resolved themselves into two coali
tions. One, the Taira (known also as the Heike), more refined than others (they
lived closer to the capital and in the eyes of the aristocrats were at least semi
domesticated), gained the advantage at first and seized control of the ultimate
symbol of rule: the person of the emperor. The Taira’s opponents, the Minamoto
(known also as Genji), after having been almost exterminated in the early
twelfth century, roared back triumphantly. Led by Minamoto no Yoritomo, son
of the defeated and executed Minamoto chief, the clan in the five years of the
Gempei War (a contraction of Gen[ji] and Hei[ke], 1180–1185), swept the Taira
before them. Yoritomo was aided by several able generals, among them his
younger brother Yoshitsune (birth name Ushiwakamaru), who in 1185 deci
sively defeated the Taira at a sea battle at Dan-no-Ura, in the far west of Japan,
where the child emperor Antoku lost his life. Minamoto no Yoritomo was
appointed shogun, an ancient military title—somewhat like the republican
Roman “dictator”—given temporarily to generals with a commission to sup
press Ainu/Emishi forces in western Japan.
The Minamoto were not about to repeat Taira mistakes. Not to be taken in
and weakened by the seductions of aristocratic living in Heian, they established
a new capital at Kamakura (near modern Tokyo, in eastern Japan) away from the
influences and intrigues of the court. A new form of government, the bakufu
(tent government)—headed by the shogun—was established. This military
regime persisted in one form or another until 1868.
The Minamoto were heads of an alliance, and thus each domain, headed by
a family of one of the alliance members supported by its retainers—they had
adopted the epithet samurai for themselves—assumed a great deal of autonomy.
This period brought into the foreground tales of heroism and bravado of individ
ual, sometimes historical, personages whose mythical exploits, like those of
Introduction 19



Yoshitsune/Ushiwakamaru, victor of Dan-no-Ura, became models of propriety
for future generations. National myths did emerge, but as the country descended
into civil war, and as domains became isolated and xenophobic, so they also con
cerned themselves with creating their own local myths and practices.
The major national myth to emerge in this period was to have lasting con
sequences. In 1274 Kubilai Khan, grandson of the Mongol conqueror Genghis
Khan, mobilized a massive fleet of some 450 ships manned by 15,000 Korean
sailors and 15,000 Mongol troops. These landed in Hakozaki Bay in Kyushu. The
local forces mobilized but were on the verge of defeat when the Mongols
returned to their ships. A storm was brewing, and they did not want to be cut off
from their means of maneuver. In the event, a typhoon blew up, dispersing the
fleet and drowning about half its manpower. By the time the Japanese relief col
umn had arrived, it was all over. Kubilai was busy finishing off the Chinese Sung
dynasty and did not turn his attention to Japan again for several years. In 1281
the blow fell. A Korean fleet of 50,000 Mongol soldiers and Korean sailors landed
in Kyushu. A second fleet of 100,000 Mongols and Chinese arrived from South
ern China. The two fleets landed men at Hakata Bay, one of the expected land
ing points that the Japanese had fortified with a wall. The fighting lasted for
about fifty days. At the end of that period another typhoon arose. Both invading
fleets were heavily damaged, losing over two-thirds of their ships and manpower.
The repeatedly miraculous nature of the Mongol defeat, combined with the
claims by the clergy that the Japanese victory was due to divine intervention,
meant that the idea of the kamikaze, the divine wind that helps Japan defeat its
enemies, became enshrined deeply as a national myth.
The medieval period ended with a century-long civil war, the sengoku
jidai of the historians, in which fiefs and clans battled one another for
supremacy or survival while the shogun’s government became as powerless as
the emperor’s court, which was still resident in Heian-kyπ. The civil war
ended with the establishment, after years of fighting, of a suzerain (though not
supreme) government based in Edo. This small fishing village in Eastern Japan
emerged as the capital of a premodern Japan unified under the shogunal gov
ernment of the Tokugawa family. The exploits of the years of the civil war
(roughly, the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) were well documented and
yielded more in the realm of personal myth-making than national myths.
Many of these myths fall into the realm of what we call today image manage
ment and public relations: The various domain lords were well-versed in psy
chological warfare, and most were fully conscious of the need to appear
invincible, or at least highly successful.
20 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The Premodern and Modern Periods (1615–)
The Tokugawa government in Edo issued in a period of unprecedented peace
from about 1615 to 1868. This was characterized by ultimately unsuccessful
attempts to keep out foreign (read, Western) influences. A major, though often
overlooked, myth of samurai virtues and strengths, which has become the
national myth of economic Japan, emerged from this period, when the virtues of
the samurai were codified, glossing over their actual practices. They were pic
tured as the perfect warrior, dedicated absolutely to their lord even at the
expense of themselves and their families. An event occurred in the middle of the
Edo period that, though factual in outline and many details, must also be con
sidered as a major myth. This event, known subsequently as the Forty-Seven
Rπnin and illustrated in a famous play as Ch∆shingura (Treasury of Loyal
Retainers), had a major effect on the ideology of Japan in subsequent centuries.
The forty-seven rπnin exemplified in their actions everything the Japanese
wished to believe about themselves: loyalty beyond death, acceptance of misfor
tune without flinching, ability to face insurmountable odds. It dovetailed nicely
with a previous national myth—the kamikaze—that showed how, in practice,
the kami were ready to defend their land, but only if the Japanese themselves ral
lied to its defense without thought of personal survival.
The outline of the events is fairly straightforward. Lord Asano of Akπ, a
daimyπ (lord of a domain; the closest English concept is baron) of modest stand
ing, was fulfilling his duties at the shogunal court. While receiving instruction in
court etiquette, he was insulted by his instructor, Lord Kira. (Kira, it is said, had
told Asano to wear the wrong kind of trousers to a court function.) Asano drew
his sword on Kira. Drawing a sword in the shogunal palace was an act of treason,
and Asano was ordered to commit seppuku (honorable suicide), which he duly
did. His fief was confiscated and his retainers disbanded, becoming rπnin (mas
terless samurai). Forty-seven of these retainers pledged to extract vengeance.
After three years of secret preparation, during which they abandoned their fami
lies and friends and proceeded by subterfuge to throw the authorities off track,
they struck. In the winter of 1703 they assembled and forced their way into Kira’s
mansion in Shinagawa, a suburb of Edo. After taking the villain’s head, they
placed it upon the gravestone of their dead master. They surrendered to the
authorities, and after a year of debate (most of the public were hugely delighted
by the romance and passion of the events, as was the shogun himself), they were
ordered to commit seppuku, which they promptly did. It was great drama, and it
contributed immeasurably to the Japanese sense of who and what they were.
The Tokugawa state, through a combination of bribery, threats, hostage
taking, and elaborate ceremonialism, managed to perform two major feats. It
Introduction 21



kept the two-hundred-odd domains isolated from one another, so that even the
most hostile of them needed a couple of centuries to band together to remove
the Tokugawa shogunate. And, overall, it kept Japan peaceful and free of annex
ation by rapacious Western colonial powers. The settled lives of the townsmen
and bushi brought forth a renewed Great Tradition of literate discussion by
philosophers as well as artists, of myths in the context of national mythologies
rather than regional or local ones. Such myths were incorporated into theatrical
works, paintings, popular cheap “penny dreadful” books, and formal story
telling arts. They formed a national mythology, the hallmark of a mature Great
Tradition. The Little Traditions still flourished in the shade, often the object of
satire by sophisticated urbanites and the educated.
In the latter half of the nineteenth century Japan started a rapid program of
modernization and part-Westernization. This culminated in World War II, when
Japan attacked and its forces occupied most of its neighbors. The myth of the
kamikaze was revived during the war: the idea that with nothing more than
spirit and self-sacrifice, the deities would save Japan from defeat.
The Japanese adapted rapidly to the situation after their defeat in World War
II, and within a couple of decades, they were directing their energies to surviving
in a capitalist, reasonably peaceful (from their perspective) world. In the process,
new myths started emerging: myths built on Japanese successes, and explaining
Japanese failures as well. Many of these myths—collectively called by foreign
scholars “myths of Japanese uniqueness” and by Japanese scholars Nihonshugi
(Japaneseness) or Nihonjin-ron (Japanese thinking), were initiated and spread by
academics and politicians. They also had impact on diverse fields such as fashion.
The idea of Japanese uniqueness, based on some physical distinction of the Japan
ese as a race, is particularly prominent. Thus in the past twenty years alone, sev
eral such myths have emerged: that the Japanese, being largely vegetarians, have
gut lengths shorter than most other humans. That the prevalence of one blood
type in Japan is responsible for the communitarianism and self-sacrifice in Japan
ese society. That Japanese brains are structured differently from other nations, and
therefore Japanese language can be imprecise and vague without limiting intra
Japanese communication. There is even a modern myth that brown-haired people
(as opposed to black-haired or blond) are warmer, more sociable, and kinder than
other people, leading to a rash of younger Japanese people dying their hair brown!
SOCIAL HISTORY
While all the political history described above was going on, the vast mass of the
population were living much as their ancestors had. Hamlets, usually of farmer
22 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



tenants, lived in close proximity to their landlords, who also worked the land.
Small manufacturing and service towns, often clustered around castles that
offered some protection in times of unrest, were scattered about the countryside.
In the larger cities of Sakai, Osaka, Edo, and others, a large class of workers and
small entrepreneurs emerged from the fourteenth century onward. These popu
lations, often isolated from others (there were major travel restrictions imposed
by fearful local governments starting in the fourteenth century), sometimes mar
ginalized, created their own myths and the rituals that bolstered them. These
myths were sometimes transmitted from one community to another by way of
wandering monks and priests, pilgrims, sailors, medicine sellers, and other itin
erants. And some of these myths were incorporated, one way or another, into the
myths of the Great Tradition.
But more than that, each hamlet, each area, had its own myths associated
with their way of life, which they perceived to be unique and markedly different
from those of their neighbors. These local myths were of varied and diverse ori
gins, but they shared one major element: They reflected local experience and
fears. The ferocious Bimbogami, the deity of poverty, was always knocking at
the door. Sprites and demons lurked at particular local places where real dangers
to the unwary—precipices and deep rivers, falling trees and landslides—were to
be found. Wizards lurked in the mountains, and if they were properly addressed
and solicited they might provide a relief from the hardships of life.
The social world of the Japanese individual throughout “traditional” history
(that is, up to the end of World War II) was intensely circumscribed and formal
ized. For much of history, peasants (whom the rulers knew, even if they did not
admit it, were the real wealth of the land) were forbidden to travel without per
mission. And when they did travel, it was in supervised groups visiting pilgrim
age sites. Formally and informally the population was divided into four classes:
warrior-administrators, farmers, craftsmen, and merchants. They were discour
aged from interacting with one another socially. The prohibitions were not air
tight, and there was some overlap, but unsurprisingly, different traditions did
emerge.
Whatever the formal social divisions in Japan, the source of myths during
the middle ages and the premodern age of Japan can be attributed to three social
categories: powerful, powerless, and outsiders.
The Powerful
The early aristocracy, those connected with and directly serving the imperial
court, were a tiny proportion of the population, never numbering more than
Introduction 23



twenty thousand or so. Nonetheless, under the aegis of the emperor, they exem
plified power. Originally the aristocrats were clan members and landowners, but
with the entrance of the Chinese bureaucratic system they became administra
tors paid for by domains granted them by the emperor. By the twelfth century
the court aristocrats had lost power to the warrior-aristocracy from the
provinces, the bushi. These warrior-knights had a different ethos and different
myths from those of the imperial aristocracy. But, together, these power-holders
had a shared interest in maintaining and supporting the Great Tradition and in
emphasizing the unity and greatness of Japan. Later, when the country was semi
unified under the Tokugawa rulers, these warriors became mainly official
bureaucrats, still later metamorphosing into the civil-servant bureaucrats and
managers of the modern state. It was their ideals and ideas that find reflection in
many myths: ideas about loyalty, about masculinity and the power of persever
ance, and about forthrightness and battle.
The Powerless
The powerless made up more than 90 percent of the Japanese population. They
included farmers, craftsmen, and merchants. During the archaic period they
were in effect the clients, if not the virtual property, of the powerful. Later,
under Chinese ideological influence, they were expected to defer to their betters,
and when a national ideology emerged, they were exhorted to sacrifice their all
for emperor and nation. Aside from that, they were often left to their own
devices. Their myths and interests reflected these facts. By and large, their inter
ests were local and immediate. In their myths foxes and mysterious spirits,
ghosts, and goblins inflicted themselves upon individuals, but in ways that the
central government or powerful samurai could not deal with. Only prayer,
reliance on the wits of others (humans and Buddhas), and a certain sharpness
could extricate a person from his troubles. And sometimes, as in most ghost sto
ries, there was no solution but to part from the dead on amicable terms: inochi
wa tsurai-yo (life is difficult).
Outsiders and Rovers
The powerful and the powerless in Japan both had a vested interest in promot
ing stability, as well as in resisting outside influences. But outside influences
were inevitable, even in the smallest hamlet. Japanese traders and travelers had
been frequenting Korea, China, Indochina, and what were to become the Philip
24 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



pines. A Japanese rover had become high admiral to the Siamese court. Japanese
embassies and scholars had been visiting China for centuries. Japan’s rulers, as a
group, were fully aware of international developments in East Asia. They were
thus very cautious about foreigners. But the caution of foreigners went far
deeper, to the days, perhaps, when the Jπmon lived in isolated bands. Villages
and domains abhorred strangers, and they were proscribed or controlled.
Nonetheless, there was a tradition of wanderers and itinerants throughout the
islands. The Emishi, inhabitants of northern and eastern Japan against whom the
Yamato conducted a series of campaigns, might have been wandering hunter
gatherers like their Ainu cousins. There were bands of hunters, of foresters, of
weavers of akebi vine baskets making a living in Japan until the early twentieth
century. They lived in the forests and mountains, coming into contact with set
tled villages only occasionally. And there were wanderers who deliberately came
into contact with settled areas. Kebπzu (hairy priests; unlike most Buddhist
priests, they did not shave their heads) and bikuni mendicant nuns visited
remote villages on a regular basis, offering rituals and exorcisms. Wandering
medicine sellers would stock a household’s medicine chest once a year, receiv
ing payment for what had been consumed since the previous visit. Slave dealers
would purchase children for household service and brothels. Pilgrims passed
through on their way to remote sites, as did poets on inspiration-seeking travels.
Occasionally seamen and sailors washed onto the beach. No one was completely
isolated from these visitors. Unsurprisingly they became the source for much
myth, and while many were considered outcast and dangerous, many others
were considered holy and dangerous: worthy of worship, of hospitality, and of
the wish that they retire, benevolently inclined toward their hosts, after being
properly entertained.
Essential and central to all these social groups, powerful and powerless
alike, was a shared concept of language and of kinship.
JAPANESE FAMILY RELATIONS
The Japanese kinship and family system differs in some crucial regards from
families in most other societies. First and foremost, the significant element is
the ie (household), and the foremost traditional responsibility of its members
was to maintain it in perpetuity. Normally, an ie would be composed of a mar
ried couple and their unmarried children. Nonmaterial social categories were
also members of the ie: the ancestors (called hotoke and kami) and unborn gen
erations of members. The living members had responsibility toward both these
categories of nonmaterial members. Unmarried members, both male and female
Introduction 25



(except for the one intended to inherit the ie), were members on sufferance only,
sometimes on a temporary basis until they married out and often severed all ties
with their natal ie.
Nominally, inheritance of all productive property went wholly to the senior
male child. The overriding necessity for ensuring ie continuity, however, meant
that in practice, the eldest son could be replaced by another son. This was rarely
done but existed as a normative and legal possibility. If no qualified son were
available, a married daughter could take on the inheritance, and her husband
would be adopted by her father into the family and take on the surname of the
ie. This is still relatively common in families who own productive property
(farmland, family manufacturing businesses, even Kabuki acting families).
About 15 percent of marriages in rural Japan were of this sort during the twenti
eth century.
Another peculiarity of the traditional family, though less observed during
the modern period when most family economies are based on wage earning, is
that the inheriting son (or daughter) inherited all the ie’s property. As a conse
quence, wealthy families “spun-off” junior or branch houses, giving them their
own productive resources. The junior families owed fealty and ritual and some
times economic obligations to the senior, or main or “stem” ie. A branch house
could, if it became wealthy, spin off a number of branches of its own. This sort
of branched inter-ie system is known as a dπzoku.
In mythical terms, the Japanese people constitute a super-dπzoku. The
imperial household, descended from the foundress Amaterasu-π-mikami
through her grandson Ninigi-no-mikoto, is the honke or main ie; other house
holds are distantly or more closely related to the imperial household through a
process of continued branching of ie. Some members of the sets of deity or ances
tor arrive there by adoption, others through birth. Whatever the case, some form
of amorphous familial feeling is engendered in many of the myths. This also
means that the precise familial relationships are not at all clear, nor particularly
important. After all, the main concern is membership in, and protection of, the
entire system, not how any individual case fits into it. What mattered was that
the individual acted responsibly as a representative of his/her group.
THE MYTHIC TRADITIONS
As noted before, a number of cultural traditions make up Japanese mythology. The
two dominant influences are the mixed and often intertwined religious elements
from Shintπ and Buddhism. To that we need to add the two “outrider” cultures in
the Japanese islands: the Ainu in the north, and the Ryukyuans in the south. We’ll
26 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



discuss the religious traditions of Shintπ and Buddhism at some length, since they
are the matrix within which much Japanese mythology was embedded.
Shinto ̄
Shintπ, the native religion of Japan, did not acquire its name until it became nec
essary for the Japanese to distinguish their native practices from the imported
Bukkyπ or Butsu-dπ (Buddhism). The local religion was based largely on the
veneration of, and appeal to, local spirits that resided in material objects, usually
natural or peri-natural. Mountains, unusual trees, waterfalls, water, peculiarly
shaped rocks, and other objects were considered to have a power—kami—of will
fully influencing people’s lives. The spirits of the dead were of that sort too,
though the dead were also considered to live in a dark and dank place, somewhat
like the classical Greek concept of hell. Kami could and did reside in everything
and anything that inspired awe or even great interest. To this day in Japan there
are trees, rocks, waterfalls, and oddly shaped stones that are kami. This is in addi
tion to the sun, mountains, and other major geographical and natural features.
The native religion heavily emphasized personal purification as an element
in worship, along with direct communication with the kami and the offering of
gifts: There was no clear division between the mundane and the kami worlds.
As we shall see, much of this has been retained in Japan’s various Little Tradi
tions. Indigenous belief was local and unwritten. There was no effective limit to
the number of kami. Some of the kami became specialized, as for example the
rice-field kami, or the water kami. Indeed, when I lived in northern Japan, our
garden was graced by a small spring surmounted by a stone carved only with the
word suijin (water kami). My landlord urged us to keep the stone clean “and
make occasional offerings,” which we duly did: saké and flowers, easy to come
by and enjoyable in their own right (as in all Shintπ rituals, we shared the kami’s
saké and enjoyed looking at the flowers as much as s/he did).
As the Yamato state grew larger and stronger it was faced with the need to
centralize and control its populace, resorting, as many states do, to religion,
among other devices. Thus the local cult of the Yamato state became the para
mount religious system in the Japanese islands, and local kami, their myths and
rituals, became absorbed into or made to align with the imperial Great Tradi
tion. This resulted in two somewhat contradictory features. On the one hand, a
series of “constructed” myths—derived from attempts to amalgamate disparate
traditions—became “the” standard Japanese mythology, particularly when they
were eventually written down. Often incorporating local myths and inevitably
containing contradictions, these are the written mythology published in such
Introduction 27



works as the Kπjiki and Nihonshπki. Such mythologies are charter myths for the
Japanese state. On the other hand, underlying these Great Tradition myths are
the myths of the Little Traditions, fitting more or less comfortably into the over
arching structure of the Great Tradition. The saints and goblins, the kami and
demons of local mythology had to adapt themselves, happily or not, to the rul
ing viewpoint: All of them, in some fashion, were and are kami.

The Kami
The term kami used throughout this book is a complex one. For our purposes (and
to avoid a lengthy discussion) the term functions as both noun and adjective. As a
noun, kami means a powerful being with an interest in the lives of humans and the
ability to intervene in human affairs, either directly or indirectly, by influencing the
activities of other kami, animals, or natural events and features: in short, a deity. As
an adjective, the term means something close to “holy”: a mysterious and elevating
quality that various living beings, including animals and humans, possess to vary
ing degrees. Kami (the noun form) possess kami (the adjectival form) in very great
degrees, though they too, as the story of Susano-wo shows, can lose some, even
much, of the quality. Kami (the adjective) is closely associated with purity. Pollut
ing oneself or others lowers one’s “store” of kami. Contrariwise, purifying oneself
by austerities, washing in pure or sea water, use of salt or fire, and avoiding polluting
substances such as the dead, feces, and blood—will add to one’s store of kami.
The Shintπ mythological actors are individuals—deities, humans, or ani
mals—who have greater or lesser degrees of kami. The deities among them often
have intensely human characters. All actors require purity in order to retain
their position, whether they are deities or humans. In fact, the borderline
between the two classes, human and divine, is a very thin one. Humans can be
purer, and thus possess more kami, than certain deities.
Many Japanese deities help and protect people (mainly from their own local
ity or lineage) as long as they are properly honored. These matsurareru kami
(celebrated deities), as Yanagida calls them, can become angry and fierce when
appropriate offerings are not made. And when angered, such deities will take
action, often violent, to express their feelings.
Though many of the Japanese kami are identified as “deity of X,” where X
might represent thunder, wind, fire, or some other phenomenon, this is not
strictly accurate. Many Japanese kami are associated with some natural phe
nomenon, or perhaps embodied in them or it. The vagueness of this association
means two things: Many kami may be associated with one phenomenon, and the
nature of the association may well be obscure. Thus both Raiden and Takemi
kazuchi are “thunder deities” quite independently of one another.
Shintπ acknowledges the presence of yaoyorozu-no-kami (the eight million
kami) as an indication that the number of kami was effectively infinite. In real
ity, a far smaller number of kami are named in the myths. However, this num
ber is complicated by the fact that many kami have several names, which were
changed according to circumstances (as were the names of individuals through
out their lives and after death in traditional Japan). Sometimes a particular kami
was given several names at birth in the myth. In this volume I have tried to use
the most commonly used and most familiar names.
Introduction 29

The names of kami are further complicated by the fact that they are descrip
tive and always incorporate one or more titles, such as no-kami or o-mikoto.
Each kami is considered to have three mitama (souls or natures): aramitama
(rough and wild), nigimitama (gentle and life-supporting), and sakimitama (nur
turing). Obviously, one or another of these natures might predominate in any
particular myth: Susano-wo usually expresses his aramitama, whereas Amat
erasu usually expresses nigimitama. Under different circumstances, however,
for example, when not sufficiently honored, another of the deity’s natures would
express itself: when forced to confront Susano-wo’s apparent rebellion, Ama
terasu very quickly assumes her aramitama, arming herself as a warrior and per
forming aggressive rituals.
A brief word is necessary about Shintπ as a religion. Ritual practices and
beliefs of what we call Shintπ existed in Japan well before the name was created.
The practices came under two headings: propitiation and divination. Propitia
tion involved acts of purification—water, sparks, and salt were the best puri
fiers—the recitation of a prayer or request, and offerings of foods that were
considered pure, mainly vegetables, fruit, and wine from various sources. More
elaborate rituals involved some form of entertainment, whether a dance, a mag
ical play, or some music. (Keep in mind that rituals in all simple societies are a
great source of entertainment, as well as awe and worship.) Divination was car
ried out using a number of devices: hot-water cauldrons, possession-trance, and
dances, many of which are still performed today.
With the emergence of the Yamato state, these rituals became formalized,
and groups of specialists such as the Nakatomi assumed responsibility for
“proper” ritual organization within the state. Upon the arrival of Buddhism,
Shintπ went into a lengthy period of somnolence. The kami were worshiped,
often within the confines of Buddhist temples. Large rituals were conducted for
the grandees of the land, while the common people, as they do, continued per
forming the rituals to the kami, led by whatever local ritual specialist they could
find, be it a Buddhist priest, local ritual expert, or wandering kebπzu (“hairy
priest,” usually a wandering mendicant member of the Shugendπ sect who did
not shave their heads; also called yamabushi). Then in the eighteenth century,
as a result of political events, some Japanese scholars started taking an interest
in the “Japanese” elements of their religion, trying to separate it from the “for
eign” elements, notably Buddhism. The Kπjiki became fashionable again. When
the shogunal government was toppled by middle-class samurai of non-Tokugawa
fiefs in 1868, part of their motivation was derived from the ideology of
Shintπ/Japanese nationalism started in the eighteenth century.
Very quickly—in 1873—the new government forcibly separated Buddhism
and Shintπ, forcing Ryπbu Shintπ (Two Schools Shintπ) and its honji-suijaku
Introduction 31



theories to abandon all Buddhist ties and ideology. The process was neither
immediate nor completely thorough. There are still many Shintπ shrines served
by Buddhist priests, and many boddhisatvas are the kami of Shintπ shrines.
Nonetheless, a separation was created where none existed before. Large Shintπ
shrines were supported by the government, and a new ideology—Kokutai Shintπ
(National Shintπ)—emerged. In this theory, Shintπ was more than a religion: It
was the expression of the Japanese people’s inner spirit and way of life. Shintπ
priests became in effect government functionaries on a salary. Shintπ was
directed toward national glorification and support of government activities. In
1946, after the Japanese defeat of World War II, the Occupation authorities insti
tuted a new religious law that separated religion and government absolutely.
Shintπ shrines became independent once more. All are today supported by dona
tions, and they are free to worship whichever kami they choose, in the ways that
please them. There are several confederations of shrines and priests, but there is
some degree of variation between shrines and localities.
Shinto ̄ Kami Classification
The large number of named kami (not all of them mentioned in this handbook,
because of sheer numbers) can be classified in a number of ways. The following
classification is an attempt to clarify the concepts used here in a way that is
accessible to the average reader. However, you should be aware that a number of
scholars have classified the deities in other ways. For example, all the Shintπ
deities can fall into “job” classifications, that is, by their responsibilities and
functions: agriculture, war, health, and so on. For us the problem is that many
kami cross these divides and thus will appear in more than one category.
Another classical category much beloved by folklorists is to classify kami by
their nature. There are thus sea and water kami, mountain kami, field kami, and
storm/thunder/fire kami. Again, the cross-boundary problem is evident here as
well, and much of this identification is on the basis of speculation about the
“original” nature of a particular kami during prehistory. In the spirit of cooper
ating with the idea of multiplying the number of classifications, the following
classification is offered. It has two virtues: First, it is as simple and comprehen
sive as possible; and second, it relates directly to the entries in the next section
of the book.
1. The Classical Kami This category includes three subcategories, the heavenly
kami and the earthly kami, and a small group of named marebito (visiting kami),
all of whom are named in one of the classical works such as the Kπjiki, the
Nihonshπki, and the Engishiki. Many of these kami were included in those
works in order to bolster the political status of one of the many aristocratic
32 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



clans, including the imperial house, which ruled Japan during the eras before the
Heian period. The assignation to one of the subclasses depended heavily on his
torical events: whether they were Yamato clans (and therefore, in most cases,
their ancestor kami was defined as a heavenly kami), or were from one of the
clans that were absorbed or conquered by the Yamato, such as clans from Izumo.
In such a case, the ancestor kami were identified quite often as earthly kami and
their status was, in general, lower.
1.1. The Heavenly Kami The named heavenly kami include those who
appeared in heaven before the earth was created and those who are the descen
dants of these original kami. The relative status of these kami, and the degree to
which there are myths about them, does not reflect their origin: It is a “second
generation” kami, the Sun deity Amaterasu, who is the chief deity. Next after
her is a male, Takamimusubi-no-kami, who is one of the originals but who fea
tures far less, perhaps because he was the patron deity/ancestor of a lesser, or los
ing, clan in some long-forgotten internecine squabble.
1.1.1. The Original Kami Many of the kami of this category are barely
defined in the myth beyond their name. These kami all come into existence
from nothing, springing into being without any explanation. Some of them
appear as single deities, while others appear as pairs (with the implication of
male and female). The three exceptions to the barely defined characteristic are
Takamimusubi, who seems to be (almost) equal to Amaterasu-π-mikami, and
the two founder deities, Izanagi and Izanami. Certainly Takamimusubi features
as decision-maker and as major mover in a number of myths, notably in the
work to pacify the Central Land of the Reed Plains. Izanagi and Izanami are, of
course, the creators of the land, the true demiurges, bringers of both life and
death, as well as the parents of a number of kami.
The male-female couples are often spouses as well as siblings. The ancient
Japanese apparently saw nothing wrong in sibling incest, and marriages of sib
lings, half-siblings, and aunt and nephew are recorded in the Nihonshπki and the
Kπjiki. This sat very uneasily with the Confucian-trained Japanese of later times
(incest was strongly abhorred by the Chinese), and Motoori Norinaga, the popu
larizer and interpreter of the Kπjiki in the eighteenth century, had a hard time
explaining the phenomenon in his Kπjiki-den (Commentary on the Kπjiki). He
concluded by stating that since Japan’s gods were unique and special, so too were
their marital arrangements (and no backtalk from incredulous foreigners wanted!).
1.1.2. The Descendant Kami These are the children and descendants of the
original kami. Most, though not all, are the descendants of Izanagi and Izanami,
Introduction 33



including Amaterasu-π-mikami, the chief deity and Sun goddess, and her
brother, Susano-wo, ruler of the netherworld and hero in his own right. Various
of these descendant kami are named ancestors of Yamato clans, as they accom
pany the various expeditions that ensured the dominance of the heavenly kami
over the land of Japan.
1.2. The Earthly Kami As the heavenly kami interact with the denizens of
the Earth, they discover a host of local kami has taken up residence, though,
apparently, mismanaging their trust. Some of them, such as ∏kuninushi, are
descendants of heavenly kami (in this case, Susano-wo), but they are clearly
identified in the texts as earthly, not heavenly kami. The attitude in the classi
cal writings was that they were more or less fine for their place and time but that
they needed to learn a lot more respect, which the heavenly kami duly taught
them. Many of the earthly kami were hospitable and supportive of the expedi
tions to subdue the land, and many such minor kami appear from rivers, the sea,
and inside rocks or caves to support the triumphal progression of the heavenly
grandson, Ninigi-no-mikoto, the heavenly kami’s representative.
1.3. Marebito: The Overseas Connection The final class of kami found in the
classical texts are visiting kami from over the sea. The two most notable ones
are associated both with the creation of the land and its subjugation: Sukun
abikona, who helps ∏kuninushi in creating the land, and Sarutahiko-no-kami,
who helps to guide the heavenly grandson when he descends to subjugate the
land. The idea of mysterious gods from over the sea is a recurrent theme in
Japanese myth. It occurs as a Buddhist theme as well as a Shintπ one, and simi
lar features can be found in Ryukyuan myth and in Ainu tales, though in the lat
ter case the overseas visitors are rarely benevolent.
2. The “New” Kami
More kami emerged (that is, were acknowledged and worshiped) after the classi
cal texts were written. They may well have been worshiped before this time but
did not have “official” recognition. They can be subdivided into two categories,
neither mutually exclusive.
2.1. Officially Established Kami This category includes kami that emerged,
or were added to the list of known and officially acknowledged kami main
tained by the authorities, after the classical writings had been finished. The
two most important such deities are Hachiman, kami of war and culture, and
Inari, kami of prosperity, grain, and commerce. Although both of these deities
existed in local forms from a fairly early period, their continuing worship is due
34 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



very largely to the establishment of major shrines in their honor during the
Heian period by Buddhist priests. Hachiman became important to warrior fam
ilies during the latter half of the Heian period, and his worship was intensified
by the kami identification with Emperor ∏jin, who, it appears from the
sources, was a formidable man (both intellectually and martially), and his
mother, the Empress Jing∆ (a no-less-formidable woman, it appears). One myth
recounts that ∏jin, then an elderly man, drank heavily of some excellent wine
at a party. Later that night he walked tipsily home. He tripped on a stone that
had been lying in the road. The enraged emperor shouted so fiercely at the
stone that it got up and ran off the road! His mother, being engaged in the con
quest of Korea while she was pregnant with the future emperor, tied a girdle
hung with stones tightly around her waist and so delayed the birth for three
years. It is possible that the Korean connection was also partly responsible for
the renown of Hachiman: The rise of his popularity coincided with the loss of
the Japanese colonies on the Korean Peninsula, and someone perhaps saw the
need for a bit of spin-doctoring.
A second important kami in this category is Inari, who rivals Hachiman in
the number of shrines erected to worship him. Rice deities were probably wor
shiped in many communities, and there is some argument that the main kami
of the Yamato state may have been a food kami, displaced only later by the
totemic deity of the imperial clan. Even so, Inari’s emergence as a national deity
of rice and prosperity was probably due, paradoxically, to Buddhist influence. By
establishing temples that supported both Buddhist figures and a kami of pros
perity, Buddhism ensured greater acceptance among the laity and commoners.
2.2. Upgraded Kami This category blends with the previous one. It
includes a number of kami who were officially upgraded by the imperial court
for one reason or another—political appointees, one might say. The most
prominent of this category is Tenjin, kami of scholarship. His promotions (he
was upgraded a number of times) were due to calamities that beset the imperial
capital at Heian after the death in exile of a courtier, Sugawara Michizane. Sug
awara was then deified as the kami Tenjin, and when the calamities did not
stop, was upgraded in rank until he appeared satisfied, and the plagues and fires
ceased. Recently deceased emperors, such as the Meiji emperor and the Shπwa
emperor (better known outside Japan by his personal name, Hirohito), are also
members of this category. Even retired politicians can receive this honor: Toku
gawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa shogunal dynasty that ruled Japan for
seventeen generations (1603–1868), was deified as a gongen, a kami who is rec
ognized as avatar of a boddhisattva, and is worshiped at the magnificent shrine
of Nikko Toshog∆.
Introduction 35



2.3. Kami from Buddhist Sources A number of kami owe their existence to
borrowings from the Buddhist pantheon. Thus both the Indian gods Indra and
Brahma are worshiped as kami in Ryπbu Shintπ (syncretic Shintπ) rituals. So is
the boddhisattva Kannon, seen by some as a Shintπ kami who chose a Buddhist
guise “because Buddhism is more feminine,” as one worshiper said to me.
3. Local Kami
The final class of kami is a residual one. It contains all those kami who were not
assimilated into the national cult. Sometimes they are identified with one or
another of the formally recognized deities, often not. Various forms of Dosôjin
(kami of the crossroads and of the phallus) and of Ry∆jin (the dragon kami) are
worshiped in rural areas throughout Japan, often in household or family con
texts. Priests will conduct rituals at tiny field shrines, sometimes claiming that
the deity worshiped is “really X-kami” (insert kami name of choice), while oth
ers, more humble, perhaps admit they have no idea which of the yaoyorozu-no
kami the kami is. Nor does it matter. The locals, meantime, happily continue to
repeat the myths of “their” kami, usually relating to local events and places,
that they heard from their grandparents.
All in all, the Japanese are remarkably laissez-faire about the myths they
embrace or are prepared to embrace and accept. Although there are instances of
people dismissing these stories as mukashi banashi (old legends, fairy tales), few
people dismiss the myths entirely.
Buddhism
Buddhism emerged as a response to social and religious features of northern
India in the fifth century B.C.E. Transmitted via a number of routes to China, it
found its way to Japan as well. The transmission to Japan was not straightfor
ward. The first injection of Buddhism into Japan came from the Paekche king
dom of Korea in the fifth century C.E. The Koreans were interested in “taming”
their overseas Japanese cousins, both to avoid piratical and raiding pressure and
to enlist them in their own fight against the rising power of Silla, another Korean
kingdom. Not surprisingly, the major emphasis in this early Buddhism was on
magic and material efficacy. Later, Japanese scholars—Ennin, K∆kai, and oth
ers—traveled to China, each one bringing back a different version of Buddhist
belief, practice, and myth, which were incorporated both into local traditions
and the traditions of the Japanese courts, depending on local presence and cur
rent political fashion and prestige.
Buddhism brought with it a number of important features. The most impor
tant one, perhaps, was the Buddhist focus on the afterlife and on salvation. In tra
36 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ditional Buddhist thought (i.e., that of Shakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism),
death was a prelude either to rebirth or, if the believer practiced the right path
(dharma), to a condition of Buddhahood where one was relieved from the burden
of rebirth. In the Chinese context, these beliefs became embroidered into native
Chinese beliefs of hell and retribution, and it was these beliefs and their associ
ated practices that arrived in Japan. As a consequence, Buddhist practice was
strongly focused on dealing with the afterlife and the dead.
A second feature is closely related to the first. In its migration from India to
China via Tibet and Mongolia, Buddhism acquired large canons of elaborate rit
uals. Many of these rituals had to do with the dead (funerals, obsequies, memo
rials), but many of these rituals were concerned with efficacy, that is, with
causing material changes in the world through the practice of the “right” ritual
formula, of which there were many. The significant element here is that Bud
dhism brought with it the idea that one could, if one knew the correct formula,
directly influence material outcomes.
Buddhism differed radically from Shintπ in a number of ways. First, it was a
“revealed” religion. It had a definite founder in the person of Shakyamuni Sid
dharta, a prince of the Sakya clan in what is now Nepal. Second, it was con
cerned with personal morality, salvation, and the afterlife. Third, it was a world
religion, in the sense that its message was deliberately aimed at all humankind,
not at a specific nation or culture. Not only that, but Buddhism has always
acknowledged that life is widespread throughout the universe of time and place,
and can take many local forms in different worlds. Fourth, as a consequence, it
introduced the Japanese to a number of new philosophical and political concepts
that had a major impact on their institutions and thinking.
Individual salvation is the core of Buddhist belief. The question of how an
individual can be saved was solved in two different ways. Some Buddhist
thinkers argued that individuals could not attain salvation by their own efforts.
This “Other-salvation” party holds that it is by the mercy of a special person
a Buddha or boddhisattva—that an individual can reach paradise, or nirvana.
Other thinkers argued that individuals can only be saved by their own efforts.
This “Self-salvation” party, in contrast, therefore requires an individual to fol
low a rigorous regime of denial and discipline in order to be saved: something
that not every person is capable of. This in effect means that most people will
never reach the goal outlined by Shakyamuni. The “Other-salvation” party, it
should be noted, argues that this is a contradiction: The Buddha could hardly be
all-compassionate if he was only interested in saving himself, could he? Both of
these viewpoints are supported, in different places, in the canon of Buddhist
writings. Unsurprisingly, the “Other-salvation” party became more popular and
is the basis for most Buddhist sects in Japan and in China. The “Self-salvation”
Introduction 37



party, popular today in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, nonetheless finds an echo
in Japanese Buddhism in the form of Zen.
Buddhist Cosmology
The fundamental cosmological idea of Buddhism consists of two related syllo
gisms. First, that actions, good or bad, bring about consequences for the individ
ual. Second, that the individual’s ego or soul—some immaterial component of
the self—lives, dies, and is then reincarnated in a form that is the consequences
of that soul’s previous actions. The fundamental truth that the Buddha preached,
and which Buddhism as a religion adheres to, is that this process can be stopped,
albeit through great effort. The trick, as we all know, is in the details.
There are three different types of realms in which this action takes place.
The most exalted realm is the Realm of Formlessness, which has no material
component. This is the realm of nirvana, the release from the recurrent cycle of
birth. To reach that realm, one must be entirely in tune with the fundamental
principles of the Buddhist Law. Below that exalted realm, which is characterized
in different ways by different Buddhist sects, is a realm of fundamental material
truths. This, the Realm of Form, has only some material qualities. In this realm
the forces that underlie the material universe are played out. Its inhabitants are
still part, albeit a detached part, of the process of birth, destruction, and rebirth
of universes and living beings. Below these realms is the Realm of Desire. This
is where all the action takes place. In it are six destinies corresponding to six
classes of being, all of whom are struggling and living within the wheel of birth
and rebirth.
The six destinies/classes of existence in the Realm of Desire are all related
in that their inhabitants can, through the cycle of birth and rebirth, migrate from
one to another, according to their deeds in a previous life. The first destiny is
that of the gods, myriad of them, living in a multitude of heavens. The second is
that of humans, both good and bad, saintly and otherwise. The third is that of
the shuras, a class of spirit. The fourth is that of animals, both zoologically exist
ing and mythological. The fifth and sixth levels, or destinies, are those of the
hungry ghosts (those who have died an untimely death, or who have no one to
care for them in the afterlife) and hell, where those who have been utterly evil
suffer great torments.
The destiny of the gods contains a variety of heavens each presided over by
a Buddha. Thus Miroku, the future Buddha, resides in one awaiting his time.
Four heavenly kings, the Myπ-π, inhabit another. The Pure Land Paradise of the
West may be a third: It is there that good people would go, awaiting Amida Bud
dha’s mercy for final salvation in nirvana, that is, ascending to the Realm of
Formlessness.
38 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Buddhist cosmology also accepts the existence of an infinitude of universes,
each unbounded, each open to salvation by its own Buddha. The Lotus Sutra (one
of the main books in the Buddhist canon), for instance, mentions 3 x 1018 Bud
dhas. That’s three billion billion. Most of these are faceless and nameless. In this
universe, on this world, the Buddha is (or in some versions, is heralded by) the
historical Buddha Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni, who now resides in the Realm of
Formlessness, was in previous lives a boddhisattva, a resident of the Realm of
Form who in his infinite compassion returned to the Realm of Desire in order to
assist others to free themselves from that Realm. Born in some unknown eon as
a man, he gradually made his way to the Realm of Formlessness. In some tradi
tions he is thought of as the seventh, and final, in a series of Buddhas to have
appeared; in others he is considered the twenty-fourth (the numbers reflect
Indian numerology more than any reasoned figure).
Brief History of Buddhism in Japan
The peculiarities of Japanese Buddhism owe much to two sources: the influence
of Shintπ, and the freedom with which Japanese chose from the vast mass of
beliefs, practices, and philosophies offered to them under the name Buddhism.
Though the main cosmological points are more or less agreed to by all, differences
Introduction 39
Six Jizπ protecting the six destinies of living beings. (Courtesy of the author)



in nuances of interpretation have led to the creation of a number of different
forms of Buddhism—sects—that still flourish today in Japan.
The arrival of Buddhism in Japan was a gradual process. Starting with personal
importation of images and books, by the time the king of Paekche had sent his
famous image of Dainichi to the Japanese emperor there already was a substrate of
people who were sympathetic to the new religion. As mentioned earlier, Bud
dhism was formally introduced into Japan in the sixth century from Korea in an
attempt at political and cultural pacification. The king of Paekche, a Korean king
dom with linguistic, cultural, and blood ties to the Yamato court, sent several Bud
dhist images, a number of teachers, scrolls, and artists to the Yamato court. This
was an attempt to mitigate the raids of Japanese corsairs on Korea, as well as to
initiate closer political and military cooperation against the rising power of Silla,
Paekche’s rival on the peninsula. Several decades of opposition in Japan were
insufficient to dampen the enthusiasm for the new doctrine. After a period of some
fifty years of resistance by major imperial clans, notably the Mononobe warriors
and the Nakatomi priests, Buddhism was adopted as the court religion. Buddhist
practices were adopted at court and were formally supported by Shπtoku Taishi,
the imperial regent. By the seventh century several Buddhist sects were operating
in Japan, though only one of those early sects, the Hosso, is still extant today.
40 Handbook of Japanese Mythology

These sects were largely established in the capital of the time, Nara. But by
741, the government had decreed the establishment of kokubunji (provincial
branch temples) in each province. These began to spread Buddhist doctrine, and,
what was no less important, gradually took over two government functions: They
became the registrars of birth (because support of the temples was allocated to
local families, this was at first limited to the gentry only, but in later centuries
all households were registered) and of death (because the temples also took over
the performances of rituals for the dead, which Shintπ generally lacked).
Japanese Buddhism is divided into a number of “schools,” or sects, more or
less the equivalent of different Christian denominations, which arrived in Japan,
or were formulated in Japan, at different points in history. The period 550 to 850
C.E. was a period of importation. Different Chinese Buddhist sects were brought
back by visiting scholars from Japan. The two most important and influential
sects that have come down to us from that period are Tendai and Shingon. Zen
was brought to Japan some time later. The last of those importations was the
Zen ∏baku sect, which was imported in the seventeenth century. Jπdπ, a major
Buddhist sect, though based on Chinese ideas, was essentially a Japanese sect.
Certainly this is true of its large and fractious offshoot, Jπdπ Shinsh∆. Last on the
scene of the large Buddhists sects was Nichiren-sh∆, in the fifteenth century.
Differences between sects are the effect of emphasis on one or another
aspect of Buddhist doctrine—a very complex subject well beyond the scope of
this book. Each sect has selected particular constellations of important sutras
and writings, and with them particular deities and rituals. Each such school
tends to define a “central” Buddha (Amida is the most popular) but in a slightly
different (but significant to the practitioners) way. For our purposes, it also
means that different Buddhist schools will emphasize different mythological
beings. Nonetheless, most schools (Nichiren-sh∆ and Jπdπ Shinsh∆ being the
major exceptions) will acknowledge the importance of most other deities or fig
ures, whether or not they consider the figure central to their doctrine, since
there is a potentially infinite number of Buddhas.
Each one of these sects draws from the same, or at least a similar, pool of
anecdotes, myths, and images, but lays emphasis on a segment of this vast pool.
The religious differences between the sects may be profound, but the mytholog
ical differences are more a matter of selecting one myth rather than another as
being worthy of repetition.
The strong influence of Buddhist ideas and symbology, including myths,
was due to another institution that the Buddhist temples, particularly in the
countryside, took upon themselves: education. Virtually every town and moder
ately sized village from the seventeenth century onward had a teragoya, a tem
ple school, where the local commoner boys (the bushi boys were educated in
Introduction 41



their own schools) could get an excellent education, albeit one permeated by a
Buddhist flavor. The graduates of these schools often went on to become suc
cessful merchants, landowners, and craftsmen, and, no less significantly, as Bel
lah (1957) argues, were inspired, like the Protestants of late Medieval Europe, to
go forth and succeed as a way of glorifying God.
The following paragraphs are a brief introduction to the major existing Bud
dhist sects in Japan, more or less in order of their historical appearance.
Tendai
The Tendai (Heaven’s Peak) school of Buddhism was introduced from China,
together with the Shingon school, at the beginning of the ninth century. In China,
Tientai was a thriving sect, but in Japan it became a powerful independent orga
nization, threatening, at times, the emperor himself from its headquarters on Mt.
Hiei, northeast of the capital Heian-kyπ. The various temples of the school did
not necessarily get along, and the long feud between Miidera on the shores of
Lake Biwa and Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei broke out into violence from time to time.
Tendai was founded on the basis of the Lotus Sutra by Saichπ, a monk who
had been ordained in 785, collected a small band of monks on Mt. Hiei not far
from the capital, and was eventually sent to China in 804 by the emperor. There
he studied Zen, Shingon, and Tendai (to give these sects their Japanese names),
eventually choosing the last to propagate in Japan when he returned to found a
temple at the site of his old monastery. Other temples and monasteries were
soon founded nearby, and Mt. Hiei eventually became a complex containing
three thousand temples and about twenty thousand monks. Many of these were
sπhei, or monk-soldiers. Originally temple guards, by the thirteenth century and
after they had become marauders and bullies, ever ready to riot and descend
upon the streets of the capital below at the slightest excuse. The most famous of
these fighting monks, one who became a figure of myth, was Benkei, who not
only stole the bell of Miidera (he was himself a partisan of Enryakuji) but dis
rupted traffic in the capital itself.
Tendai teaches that any individual can become a Buddha. They can do so by
following the eightfold path of the Buddha. Tendai accepts all the Buddhist scrip
tures and writings, viewing their complexity as a developing and unfolding
truth: As one achieves one stage of wisdom, a further stage beckons. In the ninth
century, Tendai came under the influence of Shingon (another sect, described
below) and became more mystical, describing these development stages in mys
tical and artistic terms.
Tendai also recognizes four paradises, each one for a different type of inhab
itant. There is a paradise in which ordinary people and saints live together, there
is a paradise of those who have freed themselves from rebirth and attained per
42 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



sonal nirvana, there is a paradise for boddhisattvas, and there is the final para
dise of Dainichi Nyπrai, inhabited by Buddhas and those who have rid them
selves of ignorance.
Shingon
Shingon (True Word) was introduced from China by K∆kai, better known by his
posthumous Buddhist title as Kπbπ Daishi. Probably the most celebrated figure
in Japanese Buddhism, he is reputed to have invented the katakana and hiragana
syllabaries and was a miracle worker, writer, painter, and sculptor. He studied in
China from 804 to 806 at the Golden Dragon temple of the Qen-yen (“True
Word”) sect. When he returned to Japan he founded a monastery on Mt. Kπya,
away from the capital Heian-kyπ, perhaps because he did not want to compete
with Saichπ, who had established himself and the Tendai sect on Mt. Hiei at
about the same time. Upon Saichπ’s death, Kπbπ Daishi was appointed the
emperor’s chaplain. He died at Kπyasan in 835.
Shingon is characterized by two features: a reliance on magical formulae by
which an individual may acquire power, and the worship and acceptance of a
large host of deities of Hindu, Buddhist, and Shintπ origins. In fact, many Shin
gon temples were constructed to protect and honor local popular deities in Japan.
Shingon has an outer (exoteric) and inner (esoteric) doctrine. The first is to be
found in the teachings of Shakyamuni; the latter is communicated secretly to
Shingon adepts. Only a person who has been properly indoctrinated and who per
forms the proper Shingon rites can ascend to the true consciousness of Dainichi
Nyπrai, who is the supreme Buddha.
Shingon is a very cosmotheist sect: The whole universe is regarded as the
body of Dainichi Nyπrai. His body is composed of six elements: ether, air, fire,
water, earth, and consciousness. These are symbolized in sotoba, small pillars
found on the grounds of Shingon temples, consisting of a ball, crescent, pyramid,
sphere, and cube placed one atop the other, standing for ether, air, fire, water,
and earth, the surrounding atmosphere standing for consciousness. Shingon also
allocates a place for the Pure Land, or paradise, of Amida, saying that it is located
everywhere that people meditate on Amida in the Shingon way!
Shingon is the source for some of the most popular Buddhist deities in Japan:
the Myπ-π, particularly Fudπ Myπ-π, who are widely worshiped in Shingon. The
same is true of the boddhisattvas Jizπ and Kannon. A large number of Hindu
deities have also found a place in Shingon in the form of boddhisattvas and gods.
Because all are considered reflections of Dainichi, it is not surprising that Shin
gon is a very broad and accepting church.
An important graphic feature of Japanese Buddhism that owes much to
Shingon propagation is the use of mandara (mandala), a schematic illustration
Introduction 43



of Dainichi’s power and virtue. A mandara usually shows illustrations of deities
and saints confined within a circle or other geometric figure upon which one can
focus one’s meditations. Two of these mandara are particularly important in
Shingon: the Kongπkai (Diamond mandala) and the Taizπkai (Womb mandala).
The Diamond mandala is bright and eternal, like the ideas of Dainichi. All the
saints and deities are contained within the universe of Dainichi like children in
their mothers’ wombs in the Taizπkai. The Diamond mandala is mainly white
in color, the Womb mainly red. The deities and saints portrayed have specific
headdresses, attitudes, positions, and objects in their hands, all of which have
esoteric significance. Some of these symbols have become translated into gen
eral mythology and are associated as physical (rather than symbolic) elements
with particular deities.
Jo ̄do ̄
Founded by Hπnen (1133–1226), the Jπdπ (Pure Land) sect is based, as is Jπdπ
Shinsh∆, on the worship of Amida, the merciful Buddha of the Pure Land. The
focus of the sect is to show the common person how to be reborn into Amida’s
paradise. The only way to do so is to trust solely and wholly in the benevolence
of Amida. Amida himself became a Buddha by making a series of vows to save
humankind. The salvation consists of being reborn in the Pure Land of the West.
The way to enter paradise is simply to recite the nembutsu prayer: the formula
Namu Amida-butsu, or “Hail Buddha Amida.” The prayer should be repeated as
often as possible to ensure salvation, and repetitions of ten or a hundred thou
sand during a day or week are not uncommon. Though Jπdπ mythology centers
around Amida, the founder, Hπnen accepted that other beings, deities, and bod
dhisattvas were worthy of respect and even worship, just so long as the faithful
repeated the nembutsu.

Founded by Hπnen’s disciple, Shinran (1173–1262), Jπdπ Shinsh∆ (True sect Pure
Land) takes the belief in Amida a step further. Worship is offered only to Amida,
and salvation is to be attained solely by faith. In fact, even without reaching par
adise, which one does after death, the true believer in the salvation of Amida
immediately receives the benefits and is saved. Unlike previous sects and reli
gions, Shinsh∆ introduced a new element into Japanese religion: the scourge of
religious particularism. Thus Shinsh∆ members are expected to reject other reli
gious practices and works and devote themselves to belief in Amida. Nonetheless,
there are several persons considered worthy of veneration by the faithful: Shinran,
who founded the sect; the seven preceding patriarchs, including Jπdπ’s Hπnen and
Shπtoku Taishi, the minister and scholar who introduced Buddhism into Japan;
44 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



and Amida himself. Shakyamuni (Shaka in Japanese), the historical Buddha, is
regarded as a reincarnation of Amida, in his form as Teacher. And though no other
deities are worshiped or addressed in prayers or rituals, it is recognized that the
numberless Buddhas, boddhisattvas, and deities are all contained in Amida.
Zen
The Zen (Emptiness) sect has several subsects that agree on principles and aims,
and disagree on methods. In Japanese (and Chinese) tradition, Zen was brought
to the Shπrin temple in China by a Buddhist monk and master named Boddhi
darma. Known as Daruma in Japanese, he may be entirely mythical. Zen was
introduced into Japan from China by Eisai (1141–1215) and by Dπgen
(1200–1253). Under the Hπjπ steward-regents who ruled in Kamakura, the
administrative capital, during the Japanese Middle Ages, it was patronized by
members of the bushi (warrior) caste. Zen was antiintellectual and surprisingly
practical-oriented though it supported monasteries, and it claims to be based
more on feelings and emotions than on rationality.
Zen has three major divisions—Sπtπ, the largest, Rinzai, and ∏baku—which
agree on most points of doctrine. Sπtπ emphasizes gradual enlightenment
through training, and Rinzai emphasizes sudden enlightenment (often quite
abrupt: a quick smack to the top of the head is considered one excellent way to
attain enlightenment). ∏baku, the latest to be introduced (in 1654), favors sud
den enlightenment like Rinzai but also through meditation on the nembutsu
(calling on Amida’s name—a Jπdπ practice). Satori (enlightenment), unfortu
nately, is not an easy term to explain. Basically, Zen thinking holds that those
who have experienced it cannot teach it, and those who have not experienced it
cannot understand it. An analogy from a common Zen parable is useful here:
In a pond were many tadpoles. They swam about in their watery world, puz
zled, sometimes, by the glow that rose, progressed across the ceiling of their
domain, then disappeared. The glow was warm, bright, pleasant. One day, one
of them turned, as tadpoles do, into a frog. Reveling in its new freedom, the
frog hopped onto a lotus leaf, and observed the dry world outside the pond.
When he hopped back and dove into the water, the tadpoles asked him to
explain, at last, the mystery of the glow they had so yearned for.
“It is a perfect circle” said the frog.
“Circle?” queried the tadpoles.
“It is bright enough to bring tears to your eyes,” said the frog after some
thinking.
“Tears?” asked the tadpoles.
Whatever explanation the frog gave, he found that the tadpoles lacked
the basic concepts to understand his explanation. Finally, the exasperated frog
Introduction 45



growled that there was only one way the tadpoles could possibly understand
what the sun was: to turn into frogs themselves.
Satori is thus whatever a Zen adept is searching for. It has been compared to
reaching nirvana, and also to a complete unification of the inner person. Satori
may arrive suddenly and in the most mundane of circumstances (it came to Bat
tabara as he was entering the bath), or after many years of intensive study and
meditation, as it came to the Buddha Shakyamuni. Many Zen practitioners fol
low a monastic way of life in which hard conditions and regulated lifestyles help
in shedding the distractions of this world and achieving satori; others live
entirely mundane lives.

Any deity is acceptable in a Zen temple because all are either equally worth
less and unimportant or equally valuable. The Buddha venerated (though not
prayed to) is Shaka, the historical Buddha.
Nichiren-sh  ̄u
Founded in 1255 by Nichiren (1222–1282), a bellicose priest from the Kantπ (the
area around modern Tokyo), this is the most extreme case of particularism in
Japanese religions. Nichiren preached that only the worship of Dainichi Nyπrai
through the medium of the Lotus Sutra is the proper Buddhism. He identified
Dainichi, Buddha of the Sun, with Amaterasu-π-mikami, and the religion he
preached was intensely nationalistic. His fanaticism was so extreme that he pre
dicted that calamities would befall the Kamakura shogunate unless other sects
were suppressed. Those prophecies proved (somewhat) true when Japan was
invaded in 1274 and again in 1281 by Mongol fleets that were defeated only by
apparent divine intervention, for which Nichiren claimed credit. His sect took
off after that. Nichiren-sh∆ teachings emphasize the adoration and study of one
single sutra—Hokke-kyπ (the Lotus Sutra), and adherents are expected to repeat
the formula Namu-myoho rengei-kyπ (Hail to the sutra of divine law) as the only
way to eternal life. To this day a number of very large socioreligious movements
are based on Nichiren teachings: Rissho-koseikai and Sπka Gakkai number mil
lions of members each.
Buddhist Deities
The mythological figures of Buddhism all fit, more or less, into the cosmolog
ical scheme described above, and their popularity or lack of it relates to support
and “official” recognition and adoration by one or more of the sects. In a real
practical sense, there are five central Buddhas—one for each of the five cardi
nal directions (in Asia this includes the center)—of whom Amida (Buddha of
the West), Dainichi Nyπrai (of the Center), Yakushi Nyπrai (of the East), and,
of course, Shakyamuni himself are the main figures in Japan. Either the five
Celestial Buddhas are considered aspects of the one Buddha Shakyamuni, or he
is considered a reflection of one (or all) of them: The details differ according to
the sect.
In Buddhist tradition, Shakyamuni, an Indian prince, became enlightened
into Buddhahood. Before the death of his corporeal form, he instructed his fol
lowers in a set of reasonably simple ethical and behavioral practices. Buddhas
have no interest or need to intervene in mundane affairs: They have no desires
nor wants. To overcome the need people have for help in their daily lives, Bud
dhist thinkers came up with the idea of the boddhisattva: someone capable of
achieving Buddhahood, who has decided to delay this state in order to assist in
Introduction 47



the salvation of others. With time, some Buddhist schools also proposed the idea
of Buddhas as active players in the world: creators, saviors, rulers, of heavenly
realms. These entities functioned in much the same way as the Gods of the
Western world. In fact, in both Chinese and Japanese thought, they were often
identified with local gods/kami. The Buddha, in some doctrines, has three bod
ies: A human form in which he appears to humanity; a body of bliss, in which
he manifests in paradise or nirvana; and a body of law, which is the true body
and cannot be described as having existence or nonexistence. In another view of
the same concept, the Buddha Shakyamuni has, by his good deeds (in revealing
the Law) acquired a spiritual power that allows him to appeal to humankind, and
has become the “perfect man.” He can also appeal to those like the boddhisat
vas, who are on a higher plane of existence, revealing the true Buddha nature.
These two bodies are provisional, assumed for the purpose. His real body is pure
“suchness” without taint, imperfection, or emotion. Much more elaborate
schemes of ten, twenty, and more bodies of the Buddha are also extant among
Buddhist philosophers and theologians. An analogy in the West is the Kabbalah,
a Jewish mystical system much studied by Christian theologians, in which the
monad nature of the Creator and God is divided into subunits following a logi
cal progression of functions and opposites.
Disregarding for a moment the extensive scholarly analysis and enumera
tion of the different Buddhas and deities in Buddhist mythology throughout
Asia, we shall try to make sense of the plethora of different deities mentioned in
the Japanese context. Doing so, we must keep in mind that this description is
necessarily a vast simplification of the qualities and the nature of the Buddha. It
is also necessary to remember four other features of Buddhist mythology:
• The deities mentioned here are not universal. Some Japanese Buddhist
sects do consider them part of the pantheon, others do not.
• Many Buddhist sects consider particular figures to be reflections, or
avatars, of a limited number of, or even one, “original” or “central” Bud
dha. Nonetheless, the laypeople, even of that sect, will consider these
avatars to be wholly functioning, independent entities.
• The term god or even deity is inappropriate, because many of these fig
ures are more similar to the saints and miracle-workers of Western tra
dition. In actual common usages, the Buddhas, gods, saints, and abbots
are shoson (venerated persons), and they, in effect, following the doc
trine of transmigration, can and will metamorphose from one to the
other.
• There is no one authoritative statement of creed, as there is in Christian
ity, Islam, or Judaism, to name but a few.
48 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Bearing the above in mind, we can, nonetheless, try to establish some sort
of classification of the various figures. This classification is a modification, for
reasons of clarity, of the commonly accepted (keeping the first feature from the
list above in mind!) classes of venerated beings.
1. The Buddhas: Butsu and Nyo ̄ rai. A Buddha is a being who has detached
himself (it is possible for females as well, but because females are generally held
in low regard in Buddhism, they usually become males first, before being able to
attain this status) from the Wheel of Being and has entered nirvana, where he is
not touched by the passions of the world or by the need for action. Buddhas
reside/exist in the Realm of Formlessness. They are highly compassionate, but
because of their state, do little in the world directly: They act through their
reflections/avatars or lesser beings. Three of the Buddhas—Dainichi, Yakushi,
and Shaka—traditionally have the title nyπrai (lord) appended to their names.
Others have the title butsu. A number of other mythological figures are men
tioned as having attained the status of butsu (Buddha). As butsu, they rarely
interact with humans (or even with one another, at least mythologically). They
merely exist in the timeless frame of the Realm of Formlessness.
The four Buddhas named below are the central Buddhas in Japanese mythol
ogy. That is to say, they tend to be worshiped more than others, are commonly rep
resented in art and sculpture, and are worshiped in person. This is not to say that,
with the exception of Shaka, they feature heavily in mythological texts. If and
when they do appear, it is at the climax, as proof of their mercy and compassion.
Amida-butsu (Sanskrit: Amitabha), Amida Nyπrai: Probably the most com
monly worshiped Japanese Buddha of all, Amida is formally the Buddha of the
Western Paradise. Worship of Amida, the Buddha of salvation and faith, is accom
plished by meditating on his name or by reciting a simple formula: Namu (or
Namo) Amida-butsu (Hail the Buddha Amida), called the nembutsu. Amida is
barely mentioned in the Lotus Sutra, and his worship probably originated in cen
tral Asia, perhaps based on an Iranian original. He may well have emerged from
Zoroastrian scriptures, which worship him in a similar way to the Amidists. In
Zoroastrianism, those who pray to Ahura-Mazda and rely on his mercy will end
in the Paradise of Boundless Light, which they may attain if they repeat the
proper formula. In Amidist thought, Amida is to be found everywhere, and all
other Buddhas and deities are merely reflections of the one central reality.
Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is little more than a forerunner, a sort of John
the Baptist to Amida’s Christ. According to Amidists, humans are too weak and
foolish to save themselves, and only reliance on Amida’s boundless mercy can
bring them into his paradise. The giant seated bronze Buddha of Kamakura,
which often adorns travel brochures and other “things Japanese,” is of Amida.
Introduction 49



Dainichi Nyπrai, also known as Roshana Butsu (Sanskrit: Vairocana): The
Buddha of the sun and of the origin of the universe, Dainichi may be the origi
nal creator as well. He is the principle object of worship in Shingon, and the large
statue at Nara—the largest bronze statue in existence until the modern era,
housed in the Tπdaiji temple—is of him. Like Amida, he is viewed by his adher
ents as the original Buddha, with all other Buddhas being his reflections. This is
particularly true of the Nichiren sect, which does not recognize other Buddhas
at all.
Shaka Nyπrai (Sanskrit: Shakyamuni; also Siddhartha, his personal name,
and Gautama Buddha): The historical Buddha Shakyamuni is honored by the
Nichiren sect but largely ignored by Jπdπ and Jπdπ Shinsh∆, where he is eclipsed
by Amida. Nichiren regards Shaka as the only manifest Buddha, the avatar of
Dainichi Nyπrai. Shaka’s life has been described in brief above. In most sects he
is seen at least as the great teacher, the Buddha of his age. He is one of the cen
tral Buddhas for the schools of the Zen sect.
Yakushi Nyπrai (Sanskrit: Baishajyaguru): The Buddha of healing and of
restoration, Yakushi is Lord of the Eastern Paradise. His power is to heal ills, not
only of the body but of the soul. Given his healing powers, he is obviously
important to laypeople, though he is eclipsed by most other central Buddhas.
2. The Bosatsu (Boddhisattvas). The second class of beings addressed in
Japanese Buddhism are the bosatsu. A Buddha is someone who has attained
enlightenment and has entered nirvana. A boddhisattva is, by definition origi
nating in India, a being who though capable of attaining Buddhahood, has
decided to remain in the Wheel of Life (that is, will be constantly reborn, and has
the will and ability to act) in order to assist others to attain enlightenment and
start the process toward Buddhahood themselves. This does ignore the issue of
Amida’s infinite mercy and his active benevolence, but there you are. Success
ful religions do not have to be consistent, only glorious. Boddhisattvas in effect
miss perfection by a hair, albeit a deliberate hair.
Unsurprisingly, the various bosatsu tend to be the most venerated and
adored figures in Japan. Statues of Jizπ and of Kannon, in one of the recognized
formal variants, can be found everywhere in Japan, and new ones are still erected
today. Several giant statues of Kannon carved of stone or concrete have been
erected in Japan in the past two decades.
In theory there can be innumerable bosatsu, but in practice Japanese mythol
ogy considers a limited number of named ones. Most of these are of Indian origin.
The four most important bosatsu (in terms of their interest to the Japanese) are
beings without antecedent or historical-scriptural context. They are:
Jizπ-bosatsu (Sanskrit: Kshitigarbha): Protector of the dead, and particularly
50 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Twelfth-century Boddhisatva. (J. Stanley/TRIP)



of dead children and aborted embryos, Jizπ is portrayed as a saintly baby-faced
monk carrying a shaku (priest’s staff topped with rings) and sometimes holding
the Jewel of Mercy. Statues of Jizπ can be found throughout Japan, often dressed
in a red bib and cap—the sign of childhood. These are donations from anxious
parents who have lost a child, or whose child is ill. Quite often these statues
have small piles of pebbles before them, as one of Jizπ’s tasks is to aid the spir
its of dead children in building these small mounds.
Kannon-bosatsu (Sanskrit: Avalokiteshvara): The personification of
absolute mercy. Kannon originated in India as a young man, but along the way
to Japan, through China, he underwent a sex change and became a female. Kan
non is the fount of mercy, but she can also bestow immortality on the deserv
ing, sprinkling them with the bottle of Waters of Life she carries. One common
way of portraying her is as a willowy woman in monk’s robes, with a tall head
dress, carrying a vase (usually interpreted by laypeople as a bottle of Waters of
Life) and a lotus bud, indicating that mercy is the foundation of the Buddhist
Law (the lotus).
Miroku-bosatsu (Sanskrit: Maitreya): This is the Buddha of the future, who
waits, hidden, until the right time to appear, and who will save all living things.
In common with other Buddhist figures, Miroku has many guises, among them
Hπtei, one of the seven gods of good fortune.
Monju-bosatsu (Sanskrit: Manjusri): The boddhisattva of learning and of the
law, Monju supports those engaged in earnest effort to be good Buddhists. He is
often featured in monasteries and temples dedicated to learning and repeating
the scriptures.
Other Bosatsu: A number of other bosatsu, less commonly portrayed than
the five above, also feature in Japanese consciousness. They include:
Fugen-bosatsu. Riding a white six- or nine-tusked elephant, Fugen is likely
to appear to those who are engaged in meditation upon the Law. The elephant
represents the earthly presence of the Buddha, that is, Shaka Nyπrai.
Hπkai Kok∆zπ-bosatsu. He is the Buddha of wisdom and is usually dressed
as a pilgrim and sage, carrying a ring-topped staff. He appears in five manifesta
tions as the Go Dai Kok∆zπ. He is particularly important because of his associ
ation with Kπbπ Daishi, the most important Japanese saint.
Seishi-bosatsu. In most representations of Amida, the deity is flanked by
Kannon on one side and by the lesser known and less-worshiped Seishi-bosatsu
on the other. Seishi-bosatsu (Sanskrit: Vasubandhu) and his brother, Muchaku
bosatsu, were sages in India. Seishi founded the Yogacara school of Buddhism,
which eventually led to the belief in Other-salvation. Muchaku ascended to
heaven and acquired the Buddha Law from Miroku.
52 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



3. The Gods. In the Buddhist scheme of things, the deities rank lower than
the Buddhas and boddhisattvas. Unlike the two previous categories, deities are
still enmeshed in life, and it is by their efforts to protect the Law that they aspire
to reach membership in the higher categories. Thus they serve as protectors and
defending deities. In Buddhist mythology their function is to protect the Bud
dhist Law, or particular aspects of it. In many cases they have made a vow to live
in the world in this way.
This category can be split into a number of subcategories based more on
their popular associations than on their nature (ferocious or tranquil) or history.
We thus have a number of groups of deities that often occur together in statuary,
paintings, or myths. Many of these have manifold identities: Some are the more
martial aspects of the gentle bosatsu, the Buddhist equivalent of the aramitama
of the Shintπ kami. Some appear in more than one group, assuming different
names and attributes, but considered (at least according to priests and scholars)
to be “the same as” one in another group.
Ten (Sanskrit: Devas; protective gods): This subcategory includes a number
of deities, mostly of Indian origin, who command armies of gods and lesser spir
its devoted to protecting Buddhism and the Buddhist Law. The most important
of the ten are the four heavenly kings who have taken a vow to protect Mt. Meru,
the home of the gods and the symbol of the ascent to Buddhahood. The four, gen
erally called the shitenno (four heavenly kings), are:
• Bishamon-ten (Sanskrit: Vaisravana), also called Tamon-ten. He is the
defender of the North and appears in full Chinese armor, carrying a reli
quary and a spear.
• Jikoku-ten (Sanskrit: Dhrtarastra) carries a trident and rests his foot on
the head of a demon. He is the defender of the East.
• Zπchπ-ten (Sanskrit: Virudhaka). Armored like his peers, he carries a pole
arm or holds a drawn sword and stands on a demon. He defends the West.
• Kπmoku-ten (Sanskrit: Virupaksa). Armored as well, he carries a scroll
and wields a baton. His domain is the South.
Two other ten (out of a larger list) are of great importance and originate with
major Hindu gods. They are:
• Bon-ten. Originally Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. In Japan he pro
tects warriors who fight in his name and follow the Law.
• Taishaku-ten, originally Indra, the Hindu god of warriors. Like Bon-ten,
he is a deity of warriors who defend the Law.
Introduction 53



The Myπ-π (bright kings): Developed mainly in esoteric Buddhist sects such
as Tendai, these beings are the personification of the essences of Buddhist law.
They are active principles in the lives of individuals, and reflections, as it were,
of the Buddhas. They are the martial counterparts of the mild bosatsu. The dis
tinction between bosatsu and these gods is a thin one. Bosatsu tend to be more
personal, and “softer” or “feminine,” whereas the Bright Kings tend to be more
aggressively male and to be the defenders of principles rather than of persons.
There are, of course, exceptions, and the bosatsu can be powerful warrior pro
tectors (as Jizπ was protector of Shπtoku Taishi), just as Maha Mayuri, one of the
Myπ-π, is generally portrayed as a gentle supporter.
The Myπ-π are nonetheless generally regarded, and portrayed as, fierce
deities. Two of them, at least, have been borrowed from Hinduism. They have
sworn oaths to protect Buddhism, or specific aspects of it. Fudπ Myπ-π (Sanskrit:
Acala) is probably the most popular of the Myπ-π and is often the center of wor
ship in Tendai temples. In Shingon temples, Fudπ Myπ-π is the protector and
patron of the goma fire ritual. Aizen Myπ-π is another popular member of this
group. Gundari Myπ-π (Gundari) has eight arms and is surrounded by flames. He
carries a sanko (three-pronged diamond weapon), spear, wheel, and battle-ax, and
performs the crossed arms mudra (hand gesture) with the remaining two arms.
Maha Mayuri (the only one of the Myπ-π who is not ferocious) is generally por
trayed as a woman, or at least a feminized figure. Other Myπ-π are Batπ Myπ-π,
Buteki Myπ-π, Dai-Itoku Myπ-π, Dairin Myπ-π, Gozanze Myπ-π, Munπ sho Myπ
π, and Shozanze Myπ-π.
The Myπ-π are often the central images in temples of the Tendai sect. In
other sects they may have separate halls established for their worship within the
grounds of a larger temple. They can be regarded as personifications of attributes
necessary for the protection of Buddhism. This means that though there might
be myths associated with them (“Fudo appeared to me in a dream . . .”) there are
very few myths in which they feature as major protagonists, unlike the Shintπ
deities. Their ferocity (Maha Mayuri excepted) is an iconic representation of the
power of protection they offer in their particular “area of expertise.”
The Ni-π (two guardian kings): The Ni-π are the two guardians of temple
precincts. They are giants, exhibiting fierce scowls, and can be seen as statues or
paintings at the gates of almost all major temples in Japan. Sometimes they are
identified with Aizen Myπ-π and Fudπ Myπ-π. More often they are thought to be
deities in their own right. They have Shintπ counterparts in the form of depic
tions of armed Heian-period generals who sometimes flank the entrances to
major Shintπ shrines.
Hachi-bu-shu (Sanskrit: Ashura; eight messengers of the Buddha): These
are the eight classes of supernatural beings converted by Buddha to be his disci
54 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ples. They are usually arrayed with the Ju Dai deshi (ten major disciples) around
the Buddha Shakyamuni. This class of beings is generally undifferentiated. They
feature, if at all, as figures that surround the Buddha while he sleeps or preaches.
Gongen (local deities, avatars): Most of the deities and Myπ-π are transfor
mations, into the Buddhist canon, of extant Hindu or Buddhist deities from
India. They came to Japan already part of the vast Buddhist array of worthy
beings. The gongen category, in contrast, is made up of deities who are protec
tors, or essences of a particular place in Japan, most commonly a mountain. The
gongen are kami considered to be the avatars of boddhisattvas. They, like the
Myπ-π, are fierce figures, martially attired, and are called upon in times of war
and trouble. They include the deification of real historical persons such as Toku
gawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa dynasty of shoguns, who after a century
of warfare brought stability and peace to Japan in the early seventeenth century;
Amaterasu-π-mikami; and other kami.
4. Ko ̄so ̄ soshi (Eminent Religious Figures). A number of historical figures—pre
dominately the founders of Buddhist sects and disciples of the Buddha Shakya
muni—have become mythologized through the devotion of their disciples or the
fame of their magical acts. Of those, the most important is undoubtedly Kπbπ
Daishi, the founder of the esoteric Shingon sect, but popular in Japan as the devi
sor of the syllabary alphabet, founder of a major pilgrimage route, civil engineer,
and sculptor. Others include En-no-Gyπja, a wizard and legendary founder of the
Shugendπ sect; Nichiren; and the founders of other major Buddhist sects.
Of perhaps lesser religious importance, but often greater popular reverence
and prominence, are a large number of minor Buddhist functionaries—abbots,
disciples, hermits, and the like—who feature in stories that have struck the
imagination of the populace. Examples are Battabara, usually titled bosatsu, who
is the patron of the bath in Buddhist monasteries; Fu-Daishi, patron of libraries;
and Binzuru-sonja, a disciple of the Buddha who through a bizarre twist of fate
became the patron of healing.
DEMONS, GOBLINS, WITCHES, GHOSTS, HERMITS, AND WIZARDS
The story of Japanese mythology would not be complete without accounting for
the plethora of figures—demons and witches, goblins and ghosts—that, though
interwoven with the “religious” mythology, do not have any “official” existence
in religious consciousness. These figures are nonetheless very important as
myths, or elements in myths.
Introduction 55



These figures derive from the interaction of local people with the mysteri
ous and unexplained in their lives. Some of them owe their existence to popular
Japanese interpretations of Chinese stories that were fables of Daoist, Buddhist,
Chan (Zen), or popular origin. They are in no sense systematized, though in
many instances such persons or creatures feature (often as the villains) in the
Great Tradition myths. They are “outlying” myths in the sense that though they
were very real and feature prominently in the myths of the common people, they
rarely had any official existence. On occasion the elite who control the Great
Tradition would adopt one or another of these elements into the Great Tradition
myths. In a very rough division, these figures can be divided into human and
nonhuman figures, though the division is often very blurred. Another possible
categorization is between classes of creatures on the one hand—ghosts, tengu
which are not generally personalized—and actual personalities—Gama-sennin
and Yuima Kπji—from Japanese, Chinese, or Indian traditions.
Humans
Many of the human figures that are described in myth are of Chinese Daoist ori
gin. Philosophical Daoism, which coalesced after the publication of Lao-tze’s
Tao-te Ching and the Chuan-tze, was a sociophilosophical belief at whose cen
ter stood the individual hermit. Daoism has always been heavily permeated by
Chinese religious beliefs in ghosts and demons, and with the transfer of these
beliefs to Japan, these mythological creatures came along for the ride. Thus one
character, Shπki, reputedly a wronged official in China who had vowed to fight
all demons after his suicide, became popular in Japan as a suppresser of oni
(demons).
Quite a few of these mythical characters have more of an existence in art
than in actual mythological discourse. But they were available, as it were, in
Japan’s traditional but highly literate society, to fill mythical niches as required.
Non-humans
Several “tribes” of nonhuman creatures also populate Japanese myths. The four
most prominent of these are gakki (ghosts), tengu (forest goblins), oni (demons),
and kappa (water sprites). They generally figure as nonpersonalized creatures or
groups of creatures. Rarely personally named (the Kurama tengu is one excep
tion), they may be the victors or the butt of a particular story.
Ghosts are a large category of nonhumans who afflict humanity. The appear
56 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ance of ghosts in Japanese myth coincides with the arrival of Buddhism, and they
may have been a Buddhist introduction from China. Ghosts tend to be the souls
of those who have passed away without being allocated proper care by their fam
ilies. However, certain categories of ghosts were prominent in Japan. One of the
most notable is the caring ghost: for example, a mother who has died but returns
to care for her infants or children. Most ghost stories are, or have, a Buddhist
moral attached to them.
Tengu are a form of goblin (the word itself is not exact, because tengu are
amoral rather than evil) who reside in the deep woods, and who can cast spells
upon the unwary. They particularly afflict those who do not show them proper
respect. The reverse of the coin is that they are able to provide the well-behaved,
determined individual with great gifts.
Oni are usually translated as demons in English, though this too is a mis
nomer. On the one hand, oni are misguided, wild, anti-Buddhist individuals who
can be converted to the good if they meet the right person. On the other hand,
their wildness, mischief, and lack of morals means that they are the cause of
numerous calamities that befall individuals. At the same time, they also serve
in the Buddhist hells in a manner similar to some Christian concepts, as the
stokers who torment the souls of sinners—a concept borrowed from Buddhism
and Daoism.
Kappa, as well as other types of monsters, can bring about calamities, but
can also be exploited to learn from or to acquire skills and gifts. And, like all
nonhuman mythical figures, they can be banished or killed by the determined,
the powerful, or those equipped with the proper spells and procedures.
Many of these creatures are “monsters,” in the sense that they attack or
menace humans or their doings. Nonetheless, it is useful to remember that these
creatures are not “evil” in the Western sense. They are, at most, misguided, and
as a consequence are suffering the penalty of this lack of law, whether the law is
seen from the native Japanese viewpoint of obedience to higher authorities or
through the Buddhist lens of obeying the Buddhist Law. Though occasionally it
is necessary to kill such creatures, they can just as well be converted or subju
gated by the proper authority.
SHUGENDO ̄
Shintπ and Buddhism merged and melded on many levels and in many different
ways. During the Japanese Middle Ages (roughly twelfth to sixteenth centuries),
a series of philosophical-religious systems broadly called Ryπbu Shintπ emerged.
The driving idea behind these movements was seishin-ichi, the idea that the
Introduction 57



kami and the Buddhist deities were one and the same. This adds a layer of com
plexity to the mythological actors in both religions. One expression of Ryπbu
Shintπ was a syncretic religious movement called Shugendπ, which consisted of
four main features, both historically and in popular imagination: ascetic prac
tices drawn from both Shintπ and Buddhism (fasting, bathing under waterfalls);
mountain worship and pilgrimage; wandering priests; and magical rituals.
Mountain worship was a central element in many Shintπ practices, and the
transference to Buddhist practice was, of course, very easy. The shugensha
(Shugendπ practitioner), gyπja (ascetic), yamabushi (mountain monk), or, collo
quially, kebπzu (hairy Buddhist priest) and bikuni (wandering nuns) would
appear from out of the mountains, practice their magic spells, and disappear
again. This relates to the concept of marebito (visiting deity) so prominent in
Japanese mythology.
The shugensha were also important because, as the only religio-medical fig
ure many common people saw in their isolated hamlets, they were also the bear
ers of news. That is, mythological ideas and stories were carried by the
shugensha and nuns (and other wandering figures like players and puppeteers)
from place to place. Their patron saint was En no Gyπja (En the Ascetic), con
sidered to be founder and first practitioner of the yamabushi (mountain monk;
that is, ascetic) way of life.
Shugendπ priests and nuns fulfilled a number of roles, not all religious and
not all even highly moral in character. In addition to organizing prayer meetings
and exorcisms in remote villages and communities, they organized and partici
pated in pilgrimages, sold charms and medicines, and provided fortune-telling
and prostitution services along the road. Many of these activities did not endear
them to the authorities, and they were banned or suppressed from time to time
in the history of Japan. Even so, the entire set of Shugendπ beliefs, which focused
on a number of different famous mountains, has survived, altered and modified,
to this day. The yamabushi tradition, and more than that, the stories the yam
abushi and bikuni told their rural audiences as Buddhist morality tales, became
one of the origins of wondrous stories, legends, and myths in Japan.
OUTLYING MYTH COMPLEXES
Japanese national and imperial mythology tried to foster the idea of a politically
and culturally monolithic Japan. This reflected the aims and interests of the cen
tral elite, and ignored and blurred the interests of local communities and the Lit
tle Traditions. But the Japanese nation is not as homogeneous as the authorities
tried to make out. Two other distinct cultures—perhaps the sole two remnants
58 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



of a richer and more varied cultural quilt that used to exist in the Japanese
islands before Yamato’s rise to dominance—still retain some vestiges of their
cultural past, including their mythologies. These two cultures—the Ainu of the
north, and the Ryukyuans of the south—are significant not only for their own
sake, which is significance enough, but also for the comparative light they shed
on Japanese (here read to mean that of the Yamato tradition) mythology as well.
Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands
Okinawa prefecture in southern Japan consists of the Ryukyu archipelago,
including the largest island, Okinawa. Indigenous language and culture differ
from the Yamato (that is, standard Japanese). An independent kingdom until
conquest by the Japanese Satsuma clan early in the seventeenth century, Oki
nawa was influenced by both China and Japan, and it often served as a bridge
between the two cultures. Okinawan culture and religion have been maintained
as distinct entities in many ways to this century. The Ryukyu Islands stretch for
four hundred miles between the southern tip of Kyushu and the northern coast
of Taiwan. Okinawa is about seventy miles long, situated more or less in the
middle of the island chain. The population currently numbers about 1.3 million,
excluding American troops.
The Ryukyuan economy was based on subsistence farming and fishing. Per
haps under the influence of Chinese envoys, the small independent polities that
existed in the islands were amalgamated by Shπ Hashi in 1429 into a single king
dom. One of his successors, Shπ Shin (1477–1526), consolidated these conquests
and established a Confucian-based government, forbidding the carrying of arms
and institutionalizing the separation between nobility and commoners. In the
late sixteenth century, the growing power of the southern Japanese domain of
Satsuma brought the Okinawan kingdom more and more into Japan’s orbit than
China’s, and the kingdom became a part of the Satsuma domain in the seven
teenth century.
In contrast to the Japanese on the main islands, Ryukyuans have been
recorded by almost all researchers as being singularly uninterested in mythol
ogy. Mythological figures are amorphous and undefined, and discussions of leg
ends and mythology seem to have little or no interest for the average Okinawan.
In many cases what has been touted as a Ryukyuan myth was a reworking by a
mainland Japanese scholar in search of some affinity between Okinawa and
Japan, usually to justify Japan’s ascendancy. Such myths that do exist and are
retold are generally origin myths, and even those are often abbreviated and local
ized. The Ryukyuans are religious in the sense that most individuals recognize
Introduction 59



the importance of participating in rituals and in carrying out ritual require
ments. But their religion is not focused on, nor dependent on, clear enunciation
of the gods they refer to. The focus is rather upon the proper conduct of rituals,
which are deeply embedded in Ryukyuan life and interpersonal behavior.
Unusually too, Ryukyuan religion is one of the few female-centered religions in
the world: The majority of ritual specialists (priests and mediums), and all the
senior ones, are female. Whether this is the relict of an earlier matriarchal type
of religion or a peculiarity of Ryukyuan culture is impossible to say.
The main Okinawan mythological figures are the kang. These are conceived
of as very similar to humankind, if much more powerful. Where portrayed, they
are seen as figures dressed in Chinese robes and hats: the clothes assumed by the
nobility of Okinawa. The kang are generally neutral so long as the rituals are car
ried out and people behave “properly” in their relations with others and with the
sacred groves and caves the kang inhabit (or rather, through which they travel to
the mundane world). The kang are powerful and possess abilities that people do
not have. They will interfere in human lives if the rituals are not carried out.
Even so, they can be manipulated, even cheated, by human actions and deceit.
In the vague mythology that is expressed, there are a number of identifiable
categories. The senior group are the ting nu kang (heavenly kang). Like the
Japanese kami, these are vaguely felt to be superior. Among them are unjang (sea
kang), miiji nu kang (water kang), and tiida-kang (solar kang). Again, like the
Japanese system, there are a plethora of local kang: well kang, house kang, and
paddy kang. There are also occupational kang: fishermen, net-makers, and boat
builder kang. The final category is composed of the futuki, the ancestors, who
might mediate between living individuals and the kang. All of these conceptu
alizations are blurred and vague, and few Okinawans can distinguish (or are even
interested in distinguishing) between these figures. It is sufficient, in Ryukyuan
eyes, to behave properly and make the offerings via the nuru (village priestesses).
The mythological timeline, vague as it is, starts with the Age of Heaven.
During that age, the heavenly kang (or, in some versions, Nirai Kang, the heav
enly creator deity) instructed a brother and sister kang, Shinerikyu and
Amaikyu, to create the land and the people on it. The two of them descended
from heaven and created the mythical paradise of Kudaka Island out of the
waters. Another version of the same myths (in the Chuzan Seikan) recounts that
the two descended with building materials—stones, earth, trees, and plants
with which they held back the waves and formed the archipelago’s islands. They
then gave birth, without sexual intercourse, to three offspring: the first ruler (a
son), the first priestess, and the first farmer (again, a son).
After several generations a descendant of these first people was born. Ten
teishi, as he was named, divided humankind into proper classes: kings, nobles,
60 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



farmers, high priestesses, and village priestesses. Each of his five children
assumed one of these positions. The people were then many, and they crossed
the sea, landing at Seefa Utaki (the sacred grove of Seefa) on the south shore of
Okinawa island. Seefa Utaki is still the main pilgrimage site in Okinawa.
Every village or community normally has an utaki where the local priestess
communes with the kang. The world was ordered so that temporal power in
Ryukyuan communities is wielded by men, while the spiritual power that sup
ports them is wielded by their sisters. The same is true in most families. With
the establishment of the unified Okinawan kingdom in the early fifteenth cen
tury (the kingdom also controlled, with greater or lesser effect, the outlying
islands), the female-male system was formalized, and village nuru (priestesses)
were trained and appointed by the central government.
The generalized creation story recorded in the main island of Okinawa is
repeated on other Ryukyuan islands, with local, rather than “national,” refer
ents. Ouwehand recorded a similar story on the island of Hateruma, which
makes no reference to Okinawa. And the foundation myth of sister-brother
founder deities can also be found further south, in Taiwan and the Philippines,
as well as further north, echoed in the Japanese foundation myth.
For the Ryukyuans there are two distinct realms: The first, of humans (that
is, the mundane world), occupies most people’s interest. The other realm, of the
kang, is poorly identified, diffuse, and not clearly conceptualized. The kang
inhabit that realm, but they are able to manifest themselves in the mundane
world. The portals between the two worlds, at least insofar as humans are con
cerned, are the sacred groves (utaki), springs, and caves through which the other
realm may be accessed. Above all, however, it is the hearth through which infor
mation on the doings of individuals and families reaches the kang.
Ainu
The other of the indigenous cultures of Japan, now absorbed almost wholly by
Yamato culture, is that of the Ainu. Speaking a language distinct from the Japan
ese language, they populated northern Honshu and the island of Hokkaido dur
ing the early history of Japan. On Honshu they (or a closely related culture
whom the Japanese called Emishi) gradually merged into the general Japanese
populace as a result of the Yamato kingdom’s expansion before and during the
Heian period. By the Kamakura period, Ainu culture in northern Honshu had vir
tually disappeared, leaving behind place names and some indefinable cultural
influences. Ainu culture continued as an independent culture in Hokkaido and
in the southern Sakhalin islands. Never very numerous (about 16,000 lived in
Introduction 61



Hokkaido), the Ainu came once again under cultural, demographic, and political
pressure from the Japanese in the nineteenth century, when Hokkaido was
opened to Japanese settlement. They have today virtually disappeared as a dis
tinct culture. Remnant communities maintain some aspects of the culture,
notably for the tourist trade. Those tracing themselves to Ainu descent today
number around 18,000.
The Ainu were an element in the much larger circumpolar arctic culture.
Their economy was based on a mix of gathering and hunting with some subsis
tence farming of millet, until forced to abandon their practices by the Japanese
and become full-time farmers. An important element in their political economy
was sea-borne trade, and their large, clinker-built boats plied the waters between
the northeast Asian islands and possibly the mainland as well. In this they were
not unlike their cultural relatives in Siberia and Tunguska in Asia, and the
Northwest Coast cultures of North America.
A warlike people, the Ainu struggled against their Sea People neighbors
probably members of what anthropologists call Okhotskian Culture, who inhab
ited the island chains to the north of Hokkaido—and later against the Japanese,
who subdued them only in the eighteenth century. Many Ainu myths tell of
struggles against the Sea People, or of the treachery of the Japanese, to whom the
Ainu turned for valued goods such as lacquerware and metalwork.
Politically, the Ainu were organized into small bands or communities of
about a hundred people divided into several households. These communities laid
claim to a kotan or domain, where they, and only they, exercised the right to
hunt, fish, and gather. Each kotan was centered on a river valley, running up to
the ridges between. Raiding and conflict were, to judge by the evidence of the
sagas, quite common. Communities were generally quite isolated from one
another, though the need to marry outside one’s matrilineage brought about a
certain amount of intercourse between communities, and thus a certain cultural
uniformity.
Men were warriors and hunters. Women were gatherers and shamans pro
viding visions to guide the people. Though spheres of activity were different,
women were not inferior to men, and they possessed a great deal of power of
their own, resting often in their matrilineal lineage, or “girdle group”: women of
the same matrilineal descent wore a kut, a narrow girdle of recognized weave
peculiar to that group. A woman’s daughters-in-law could not be of the same gir
dle group, and it was thus the women who controlled Ainu fertility, since men
were forbidden from seeing or even discussing the girdles. Women in Ainu
myths are generally portrayed as powerful, even warlike. They fight alongside
their menfolk and are perfectly capable of fighting off intruders, or handling the
tasks of daily life, including hunting and fishing, on their own.
62 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Two concepts are fundamental to understanding Ainu religion: ramat and
kamui. Ramat is an immanent power possessed by all living things, both plants
and animals, and by objects, particularly those associated with humankind.
Ramat is a nonsentient force that can occupy an object that is whole and func
tional, and that leaves it upon destruction and death. In this ramat is very sim
ilar to Polynesian mana, as well as, unsurprisingly, Japanese kami. The
destruction of an object results in its ramat leaving it, as does the death of a
being. Larger, more complex beings such as humans, have more ramat than do
simple implements and beings such as tools or seeds.
Kamui are the deities of Ainu religion. They include several subclasses,
some more powerful, some less powerful. There is a fundamental difference
between pirika kamui (good kamui), wen kamui (hostile, malevolent), and
koshne (neutral). Again, there is clear similarity between the Ainu and Japanese
conceptions, and it is clear that they either share a common origin or have been
mutually influencing one another for a long time. The kamui are no different
from human beings. They live, love, even die as human beings do. However,
they are, or can be, extremely powerful once they leave their homeland and visit
the homeland of the Ainu. The kamui and the Ainu have a reciprocal relation
ship. Central to Ainu religious behavior were offerings to the kamui. Offerings
consist of wine, food, and items of value, the most important of which are inau.
Every kamui has a type of inau specific to that deity. Inau can only be made by
humans. Using a thick wand of willow or other tree, the craftsman would care
fully shave curling strips from the wand. Still attached to the tip of the wand,
these were formed into shapes appropriate to the kamui in question. The inau
were kamui in their own right, though their only activity was to convey the
respect and gifts of the person making them. Inau would be stuck in the ground
in appropriate places—before the hearth, on a river bank, at an ill person’s bed
side—and offerings of food and drink, song, and dance were made there. As we
learn from the yukari poems, kamui are highly dependent upon the offerings and
the inau. Without the food, wine, and other offerings, the power of the individ
ual kamui will wane, and he or she might eventually become moribund. With
out the inau to convey the gift, either the recipient kamui will not get it or
having got it, will not know who is responsible for it.
The kamui could assume any shape, and when they reciprocated the offer
ings of human beings they would “dress” in animal, or tree, or vegetation “cloth
ing.” A fish or a whale, a tree, or an animal were the outer garments of a kamui,
who provided these things to the Ainu when the deity returned to the kamui
homeland. These outer garments were shed by the kamui and became gifts to
the person being visited. The ramat of the deity was still associated with the
object, which needed to be treated with great respect. A hunter who caught a
Introduction 63



good prey or a gatherer who found succulent lily bulbs was receiving a present
from the kamui.
This practice was exemplified in the bear ritual, practiced until the early
years of the twentieth century. A young bear cub was raised for a year, then
killed with arrows. The meat eventually was eaten and the fur used, but for a
week the bear was displayed and offered wine and entertainment; finally the bear
deity was sent back to his homeland, minus his “clothes”: the empty husk of the
bear cub’s body, which he left behind as a gift to his hosts. Bears in general were
very important to the Ainu. The largest land predator (the Asian brown bear
Ursus arctos, of which the Hokkaido brown bear is a subspecies, is related to the
American grizzly) in their experience, bears were generally considered benevo
lent and well disposed toward humans. They were, in effect, the outer clothing
worn by the mountain god Nuparikor Kamui when he came to visit humankind,
soliciting offerings of wine and inau, and leaving his earthly husk, or covering
the fur, meat, and bones of the bear—behind for the humans to enjoy. Monster
bears—ararush—existed as well, usually because people did not treat the bears
with proper rituals and offerings. Ararush were feared because not only did they
not yield their garments gracefully to the hunters but they actually would stalk
and attack people, dam up the rivers to keep the salmon to themselves, and
frighten off deer and other food animals.
In Ainu cosmology there were four realms. Two of those, the realm of the
land, or land mass (Hokkaido) and the realm of the sea islands over the horizon,
were populated by people: the Ainu in one, and their enemies—Japanese and
Okhotskians—in the other. The kamui lived in their own realm, similar in every
way to that of humans, and often portrayed as being up in the sky. The fourth
realm was the deep dank realm of those who had misbehaved in life. Such sad
souls, whether human or kamui, were doomed to wander that clammy and dark
realm, whereas those who behaved properly, having reciprocated hospitality and
performed rituals, would be kept in the hearth by the Hearth Goddess until
released to be reborn.
JAPANESE MYTH IN THE MODERN WORLD
Japan has been a modern state, and in some ways an ultramodern state, since at
least the 1950s. Though many of its institutions might look odd to someone from
North America, they are modern expressions of historical Japanese culture. Most of
the population is literate (over 99 percent, one of the highest rates in the world). All
modern technological devices are available to the population. There is a reasonably
equitable distribution of wealth. Transportation facilities are unsurpassed.
64 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Even in this modern milieu, however, myth has a place. Myth is one expres
sion of religion, and though most Japanese might claim they are irreligious, they
do, at the same time, perform religious rituals at a frequency that is very high.
And most people are aware of the general thrust of Japanese mythology. Whether
they accept the myths as true or not is a different issue.
Certainly many Japanese have a sense of Nihon-damashii (Japanese spirit).
Whether they support the actions of Japan before and during World War II or not,
they are nonetheless conscious of the fact that Japan fought bravely against huge
odds. And fundamentally, in the Japanese view expressed in many myths, winning
is not all: Fighting with style is far more important. The great heroes of Japanese
myth are often the losers, but they lost with their eyes open and died in style.
Japanese myth thus is viewed as relevant to the modern world in that it pro
vides a template for doing. Whether one is a samurai or a sarariman (salaried
office worker), one is expected to fight tenaciously, to be loyal, and if necessary
to be ready to sacrifice all. That few people actually live up to this behavioral
template is immaterial.
At the same time, Japanese myth has plenty of examples, or behavioral tem
plates, for other types of life: sly foxes, wild deities, contemplative scholars and
recluses who acquire power for ends of their own. These thematic myths occur
and reoccur in modern Japan in the form of films, historical series, samurai dra
mas, advertisements, and comic books.
The most powerful and enduring myth is still the myth of Japanese unique
ness. This includes the physical, mental, cultural, and familial qualities of the
Japanese. In the physical realm recurrent ideas are floated by scholars and writ
ers about some unique characteristic Japanese are supposed to have. In the famil
ial realm, the feeling still persists among a large segment of the population that
the Japanese are special because each family is the bunke (branch house) of the
imperial family, and thus descendant from the heavenly deities. All of these feel
ings are based upon a substrate of myth that has originated from the dawn of
Japanese culture.
SOURCES OF JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
There are two main types of sources from which we get information about Japan
ese mythology. Both Shintπ and Buddhism have textual canons from which
myths have been drawn. Few of these written works have the same status of
irrefutable truth attributed to, say, the Christian Bible. Nonetheless, like the
Bible, they recount the myths of deities and heroes, along with moral precepts,
ritual requirements, and explanations of the world.
Introduction 65



A second source is the work of ethnographers who have recorded oral myths,
usually those of the Little Traditions. Starting with Yanagida (also Yanagita)
Kunio, and Origuchi Shinobu, Japanese ethnographers have been diligent in
recording the myths and folktales, rituals, and traditions of far-flung, often
remote villages. Others such as Kindaichi Kyπsuke and Chiri Mashiho did the
same for the Ainu.
The Shint  ̄o Canon
The major works recounting Shintπ mythology are compilations of purported
histories compiled during the Heian period. Two are of primary importance: the
Kπjiki (Record of Ancient Matters, compiled circa 712 C.E.) and Nihonshπki
(Chronicles of Japan, compiled circa 720 C.E., often referred to as Nihongi). Both
provide a mixture of mythical (or at least, unverifiable) and historical accounts
of the Japanese nation, from mythical times to the reign of the first emperors.
Until the eighteenth century, neither work was held in particularly high regard
(Nihonshπki slightly more than Kπjiki). But in the middle of the eighteenth cen
tury, the Kokugaku (National Learning) scholar Motoori Norinaga started on his
massive (49 volume) Kπjiki-den—a commentary on the Kπjiki. In his view, the
traditional myths of Japan, untainted by Confucian or Buddhist influences, were
the charter history of the Japanese people. The elevation of the Kπjiki, and with
it, of the Nihonshπki, thus derive quite clearly from political ideologies associ
ated with the decline of the Tokugawa shogunate.
Both books are similar in character and cover much of the same material in
slightly different formats. The Nihonshπki, however, provides a number of alter
native versions of myths along the lines of “Some say this, others say other
wise . . ..” The Nihonshπki also shows much more of a Chinese influence and
borrows terms and explanations from that source, whereas the Kπjiki is more
self-consciously Japanese. Both books consist of brief chapters, the earliest
describing the activities of the deities, the later describing the events during the
reigns of named emperors. In the Nihonshπki the emphasis is slightly more on
the latter, and it includes events relating to the introduction of Buddhism, which
is deemphasized in the Kπjiki. There are also a number of other compilations of
lesser importance and renown. One such is the Engishiki, a collection of norito
(declamatory prayers). Another are the Fudoki, collections of local myths,
records of customs, and gazetteers from various areas of Japan collected in the
Heian period. Of these, only fragments remain of many, and only small parts of
some have been translated into English.
The sources of heroic and later myths have been recorded, or mentioned, in
66 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



a variety of formats. Song-recitation texts, plays, and novels provide rich sources
for Japanese myths, though they often contradict one another. Some, though by
no means all of this literature—for example the Heike Monogatari (Tale of the
Heike)—have been translated into languages other than Japanese.
Another rich source is available: the graphic arts. Japanese painting and sculp
ture, as well as arts such as lacquering and enameling, quite often express mythi
cal themes. Favorite images such as Buddhist sages, heroes, and deities are often
replicated and portrayed in art, sometimes with commentaries in prose or poetry.
These portrayals provide an essential source for understanding how the Japanese
in any particular period thought about mythical events and personages. Some por
trayals, such as those of Daruma (the mythical founder of Zen) and the Ni-π tem
ple guardians, are still “mythicized” by people today: People still make Daruma
dolls to ensure effort, and still offer the giant Ni-π straw sandals for their bare feet.
Buddhist Literature: The Sutras and Commentaries
Buddhist literature is vast. Soon after Shakyamuni’s death, an attempt was made
to write down what he had said in his forty-five years of preaching. Even then
there were disagreements, with some followers essentially arguing “Yes, you are
right, the Buddha probably did say such and such at a particular event, but he
told me something else under other circumstances.”
A second pan-Buddhist conference about one hundred years later added
more material, but neither reduced the disagreement nor brought about a unified
canon of work, or any statement like the essentials recorded for Christianity in
the Nicene creed. As the Buddha’s followers spread throughout East and Central
Asia, they wrote still more books, trying to explain or resolve problems they
thought were central. And they came into contact with other ideas—Zoroastri
anism from Persia, Bon in Tibet, and even Christianity—and tried to interpret
the Buddha’s preaching in light of what they encountered.
The central Buddhist writings are organized into sutra (meaning “thread” in
Sanskrit). These sutra were either brief expositions of the main points of Bud
dhist doctrine or lengthy essays on the topic, including the preaching of Shakya
muni. Two sutra play a central part insofar as Japan is concerned: the Diamond
Sutra and the Lotus Sutra. Most Japanese versions of Buddhism see one or the
other as central to their thought. The problem from our point of view is that
quite often the mythological characters mentioned are found, if at all, only mar
ginally in these works.
Other writings, including a variety of exegeses from Hindu, Chinese,
Tibetan, and no-longer-available Central Asian texts, are the sources from which
Introduction 67



much of the Buddhist mythology in Japan is constructed. A more or less agreed
upon canon of texts exists in the form of the Daizπ kyπ (Collected Buddhist writ
ings), which, though vast, encompasses only part of what can be considered Bud
dhist source writings. Many of these writings have been adapted from works that
have vanished, or that had little popular distribution, but caught the eye of some
scholar or priest.
Folktales and morality tales told by or about Buddhist miracles and miracle
workers are also sources of Japanese Buddhist mythology. These tales, many of
which have been complied into collections such as the Konjaku Monogatari (but
only some translated from Japanese), offer a good source of ideas about the
deities and Buddhas, and of myths about them and their powers.
Ainu Yukari
The Ainu did not have a writing of their own. They did, perhaps as a conse
quence, manage to maintain an extensive oral tradition of poetry that was per
formed publicly. Much of Ainu mythology is retained in kamui yukar, or “deity
epics,” in which a singer recounted a deity’s adventure in verse. These epics,
some of great length (over 7,000 verses), were sung at gatherings by a singer who
appropriated the persona of the kamui or the culture hero. A person who could
recite a story in poetic format was highly honored. These poems—passed on
from father to son and mother to daughter—concerned the doings of the deities
and heroes. They were recited in formal gatherings and served as entertainment
when time and other activities permitted. In the late nineteenth and early twen
tieth centuries, Western missionaries and Japanese ethnographers (and eventu
ally some Ainu trained in those disciplines) set about recording these
poems—yukari—with the object of preserving them. The strong interest the
Ainu have maintained in their own religious practices, as well as the tradition
of memorizing the yukari, has ensured that a great number have been preserved.
What this means is that many of the extant poems have been filtered through
non-Ainu sensibilities. Even so, we get a feel for the major concerns of Ainu life:
the nature around them, social relations, and family issues.
Yukari are usually classified as deity yukari, hero yukari, and human
yukari, essentially repeating tales of these three categories of individuals. They
tend to be lengthy sagas of the lives and activities of humans and deities, usu
ally told in the first person. Yukari sometimes contradict one another, assigning
the same events to different actors, or describe a particular character in opposite
terms. This is unsurprising in the oral literature of a culture organized into
small, relatively isolated bands.
68 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Ryukyuan Myths
The Ryukyuans, as noted earlier, are probably the least myth-inclined people in
the world. Very few Ryukyuans, including ritual specialists of various sorts,
show any interest in discussing myths of origin or of the deities, or in discussing
metaphysical issues in any way. As was discussed earlier, some myths of origin
have been gathered on some of the islands, similar to origin myths found else
where, both to the south (Taiwan and the Philippines) and to the north (Japan).
Discrete scraps of myth are recorded here and there in various works, but there
is in effect no “body” of Ryukyuan mythology comparable to Japanese or Ainu
mythologies.
Ryukyuan mythology is difficult to characterize because the sources them
selves are contradictory and sometimes suspect. Two main categories of sources
are available. A number of ethnographers and anthropologists have studied the
religion of the Ryukyus at firsthand (these include Norbeck, Ouwehand, Sered,
and Robinson, and a large number of Japanese scholars that have not been trans
lated into Western languages). In most cases the study has been limited because
it has focused on one of the small island communities, and the degree of gener
alization possible is restricted. However, these studies have provided firsthand
information directly from the people concerned.
The second source of information are written records, of which three are
paramount. One, Omoro Sπshi, was collected between 1531 and 1623. The
Omoro Sπshi was an anthology of poetry and literature but includes mythologi
cal themes. By 1609 the Okinawan kingdom had become a vassal of the Satsuma
lords of southern Kyushu, and this collection no doubt reflects Japanese concerns.
The same is true of the second source. Taichu-shπnin, a Buddhist monk, wrote
the Ryukyu Shindo-ki in 1638. This reflected his Buddhist point of view, which
sought to make parallels between his Japanese Buddhist concerns and Okinawa,
where he acted as missionary. Finally, Tomohide Haneji, a politician and scholar,
wrote Chuzan Seikan, a compendium similar to Taichu’s, but more detailed.
LANGUAGE AND WRITING
One important aspect of Japanese culture that is relevant to myths is the Japan
ese language. Japanese is part of the Ural-Altaic family of languages that includes
Korean and Manchu. These languages are agglutinative, that is, words are mod
ified by meaningless particles to indicate aspects of the language such as verb,
politeness levels, tense, and so on. Japanese is written, however, in kanji (Chi
nese characters), which are ideographic in nature. Chinese does not have the
Introduction 69



agglutinations of Japanese, and the Japanese people, of necessity, eventually
developed two sets of syllabaries (characters indicating a consonant and a vowel)
to write these agglutinations (one of these, katakana, was invented to simplify
reading Buddhist scriptures for women, who were considered too weak-minded
to read proper Chinese characters). The consequence, however, is that many con
cepts in Japanese are expressed by two words: one of Japanese native origin, and
another of Chinese. Moreover, though each Chinese character has a unique
meaning, its “reading”—the sound it is indicated by—can have many meanings
in Japanese.
All this has consequences for Japanese mythology. The names, and often the
characteristics of mythological beings and articles, may be derived from alterna
tive readings/interpretations of their names, their location, or actions. A name
that might have had one meaning in the on yomi (Chinese reading) of a word
might be read deliberately as if it were kun yomi (Japanese reading), and mean
ing then read into the sound. Here is an example: Most people are familiar with
the three monkeys, Hear No Evil, See No Evil, and Speak No Evil. In Japanese
mythology they are associated with the road kami, Sarutahiko-no-kami. The
word saru in Japanese means monkey, and ta means rice paddy. In the Chinese
character rendition of the kami’s name, it is written with the characters for
monkey and for field, which sound like the kami’s name. This associates the
deity with monkeys, though there is no such association in the Kπjiki or in the
Nihonshπki where Sarutahiko is mentioned. In old Japanese the verb suffix -saru
or -zaru is the negative imperative suffix of a verb (“do not . . .”). Thus the exhor
tation, probably from a Buddhist source, to hear no evil, see no evil, and speak
no evil, can by a visual pun be illustrated as three monkeys, effectively associ
ating these three monkeys with Sarutahiko.
INTERPRETING JAPANESE MYTH
How does Japanese myth fit into other myth systems, and into a general under
standing of myth and of Japan? The original recorders and interpreters of Japan
ese myth were the two Japanese ethnologists, Yanagida (also Yanagita) Kunio
and Origuchi Shinobu, and their students. Yanagida, in particular, was interested
largely in trying to reconstruct “the original circumstances of life of the Japan
ese people.” He, in effect, concentrated, as noted earlier, on the “Little Tradi
tions” of the hamlets and villages of Japan. There are varied interpretations of
(and methods of interpreting) Japanese myths. Quite often no single interpreta
tion is “the right” interpretation, since much rests upon speculation and some
esoteric pattern comparisons: Multiple explanations perhaps hit closer to the
70 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



mark. Some of the more prominent interpretations are described and explained
briefly below.
Universal Types
Many Japanese myths follow patterns that are clearly discernible in stories that
have been told around the world. They represent, in a sense, Japanese expres
sions of archetypal themes. To cite but one example, the legend of the descent
of Izanagi into the land of the dead in search of his wife, her refusal to come
because she has eaten of the food of the underworld, and his violation of his oath
to her are paralleled by the myths of Persephone and Hades, and of Orpheo and
Eurydice. Now, whether or not these stories and images come from some com
mon source is not as important as the fact that this myth type is so significant
that two peoples, separated by hundreds of years of history and thousands of
miles, will nonetheless retell these myths and feel they are important.
What this means is that many Japanese myths repeat themes that are
sociopsychologically important to all humankind. Both human hopes and
human fears are represented and re-represented in culturally acceptable guises.
It should not therefore surprise us at all that some myths seem familiar.
Structuralist Interpretations
Structuralist interpretations are related to the search for universal types. In this
technique the interpreter seeks to establish patterns relating themes—items,
types of actions, descriptions of protagonists, relationships between all of these
three elements—to one another in different myths. For example, Ouwehand
(1964) and others have related the thunder god and the catfish in this way.
Many of the themes of Japanese mythology can benefit from this kind of
structuralist treatment, which then allows them to be compared to myths and
more universal themes found elsewhere. The repeated occurrence of swords, and
the contexts in which they are found, as well as the repeated contrasts between
high/low and heavenly deities/earthly deities, are simple relations of this type.
Not all myths yield to this kind of analytical treatment, but over the years of
interpretation, a number of analyses of this kind have been made.
Diffusion
Very little is really known (as opposed to speculated upon) about the cultural and
genetic exchanges and changes during Eurasia’s prehistory. Yes, we know some
Introduction 71



of the gross facts, but these tend to be the result of post-hoc ergo propter hoc
thinking: This is the way it is now, therefore everything must have led up to it.
The myths, if the attempt to trace them cross-culturally is correct, seem to paint
a more ambiguous picture. Littleton (1995) has shown how two myths from
either side of the Eurasian continent (a distance of over ten thousand miles!)
Arthur and Yamato-takeru—show great homologies that may very well mean
they are the result of cultural diffusion: a tribe or culture that split in prehistoric
times, part of the culture moving east, the other west. The same can be said of
the story of Ho-ori’s sea-wife. Known to European folklorists as a Melusine
myth, it is found throughout Europe: the silkie or mermaid wife marrying a
nobleman, who then spies on her in her bath, whereupon she flies away to her
home in the sea. ∏kuninushi’s escape from his father-in-law is another case in
point. The “escape from the giant’s castle” myth can be found in numerous
European folktales, even to the specifics of the harp (or other musical instru
ment) waking the sleeping victim, and the use of various magical items to cre
ate a barrier from pursuers—a theme that is also present in the myth of Izanagi’s
descent into the underworld.
There are other indications of diffusion that can be traced, somewhat less
ambiguously than the Arthur/Yamato-takeru story. The myth of the brother
sister founder can be found throughout the island chains south of the Japanese
islands all the way to the Philippines. The stories are, if we discount ecological
and cultural differences, very similar. It is reasonable to speculate, under those
circumstances, that somehow or other these stories come from a common
source or sources, and that they have arrived either by contact between peoples
or because the same people have spread throughout a much greater geographic
area than is known today.
Interpretation on the Basis of Archaeo-Anthropology: The Attempt to Extract Prehistory from Myth
Many Japanese students of mythology have been concerned about trying to under
stand the prehistory of the Japanese people by looking at the myths. This is of
course a dangerous business, not least because there is a difference between those
who recounted the myths and those who, many years and often centuries later,
wrote them down. This is not only because the literate people were not living in
the archaic times they were recording but also because the writers, members of
the elite, had, as we know, their own ideological and political axes to grind.
Even so, by comparing the different versions of foundation myths recorded
in the Kπjiki, the Nihonshπki, and the Engishiki, to name but a few, we can get
72 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



a sense of the political and social life the people of early Japan led. It does not
require much analysis to see, for instance, that the conquering Yamato had a
different social makeup from the people they “subdued,” nor that a variety of dif
ferent social customs were familiar and common. For example, Yamato-takeru
approaches a communal pit dwelling, and yet he lives, and his ancestors live in
“Heaven-reaching halls.” We know from archaeological evidence that both sorts
of structures were used, and we can see that the communal pit dwellers, often
ruled by an elder-brother, younger-brother combination of rulers, were sup
planted by the clan- and family-oriented Yamato social structure. We can also get
a glimpse of the relations between the sexes. Women are far more powerful in
archaic than in traditional (or even modern) Japan. They rule, often achieving
their aims by force, supported by brothers or husbands. Primogeniture (inheri
tance by the eldest son) is the exception rather than the rule in most cases. It is
usually the younger sibling who inherits (Amaterasu, Jimmu-Tenno, Yamato
takeru, to name but a few), whereas the reverse became true in traditional Japan,
presumably because of Chinese Confucian influence. Interestingly enough (and
unsurprisingly), these two features of archaic societies—female equality and
ultimo-geniture—were features that neither Motoori nor Yanagida—the two cen
tral proponents of Japan’s traditional practices, but both the products of pater
nalistic Confucian-derived morality—definitely did not promote.
Many of these interpretations are valid because we find support for them
from another quarter. Archaeological excavations in Japan have uncovered the
remains of pit dwellings, of weapons and tools described in the myths, and of dif
ferent foods consumed during this period by the mosaic of people who populated
the Japanese islands during the archaic period.
Japanese Uniqueness Myths
Motoori Norinaga, the eighteenth-century scholar of the National Learning
School, was, in effect, an interpreter of myths. He very strongly believed that the
Japanese foundation myths were unique to Japan and that they demonstrated the
primacy of Japan in the world. He (and his many followers) attempted to explain
the nature of Japanese myths based on linguistic associations, construction of
elaborate tables of genealogy and chronology, and relating ideas common in his
own era to scraps of items found in the classics.
With a very similar view, Yanagida Kunio attacked the problem from the
opposite direction, methodologically speaking. Convinced that the uniqueness of
the Japanese people was to be found in the practices of the common people and
the peasants in remote villages, he set out to collect these customs firsthand.
Introduction 73



Yanagita believed that the peasants had not been contaminated by the Confu
cian, Buddhist, and Chinese influences that the elite writers of the Great Tradi
tion (including, presumably, Motoori) had been touched by. The essence of
Japanese tradition and culture was therefore to be found among the peasants:
Motoori would have thought that a ridiculous notion.
Notwithstanding the different political stances of these two (and many of
their colleagues and students), the idea behind this form of interpretation was
the enhancement of “pure” Japanese culture. Both schools, that of Motoori and
that of Yanagida, were partly attempts to buttress Japanese culture against
assumed cultural threat from outsiders: the Chinese and Europeans.

MYTHIC TIME AND SPACE
T
he two dominant mythical timelines of Japanese thought, from Buddhism
and from Shintπ, are radically different in their origins as well as their
beginnings, but they converge and eventually meld into a single progres
sion centering on Japan and the Japanese people. One reason, perhaps, why the
Japanese had no difficulty in reconciling Shintπ and Buddhist myths is that each
of these mythical traditions leaves large sections of the account blank, or at best,
sketched in rather perfunctorily, so that it can be “filled in” by the other.
The Shintπ mythical timeline can be divided into four eras. The first is the
mythical era of the heavenly and earthly kami. This is the time for the creation
of the heavens and earth, and for their population and organizing. The end of
this era sees the earth created in all its aspects, and the earth kami subdued by
the proper authority of the heavenly kami. The second era is that of the emper
ors. It details the lives of the emperors and their rule from the earliest and most
mythical to the historical. The third era, of heroes, deals with the activities of
a string of powerful warriors and heroes, many with a grain of historical fact.
Some of the heroes fought to extend the imperial reign, and others fought for
their kin and clan.
Finally we come to an extensive era of more localized myths, ghost tales, and
belief paradigms that include modern times. This blends Shintπ and Buddhist
myths into a mix of Great and Little Traditions that make up the modern world
and include a number of modern myths relating to the nature of modern Japan.
Buddhist mythic timelines are not easily compartmentalized in this way.
Very roughly, they can be divided into (1) myths that have a continental, mainly
Indian origin, which essentially deal with the ages of the Buddha, and (2) those
that concern the establishment of Buddhism in Japan. As noted above, this time
line blends with Shintπ in the settled periods of the Edo and modern ages.
A word, too, about the Japanese calendar. The traditional Japanese calendar
was a complex affair. This is not surprising, given that both native and Chinese
ideas gave great importance to the seasons, the stars, and the association of por
tents with days that could be used for divination. The calendar was modified
75



several times during the early history of Japan. It was modified again when Japan
became a modern state and adopted the Gregorian calendar, albeit with simple
numerical months (First Month, Second Month, . . .) rather than the Western
names. One peculiarity, however, remains: Years are often indicated not by the
Common Era indicators used worldwide but by imperial reign names. Thus
1925, the first year of the reign of the Shπwa emperor (most non-Japanese know
him as Hirohito) became Shπwa 1. Hirohito’s son assumed the throne in 1989,
taking the reign name Heisei, and the year promptly changed to Heisei 1, though
it can still be referred to as Shπwa 63. Significantly, this system has ensured that
many mythical dates avowed as authentic are probably inaccurate.
CREATION AND CONSOLIDATION: THE FOUNDATION MYTHS
In the beginning, says the Kπjiki, five single deities (that is, they had no spouses)
came into existence. The land itself was formless, like a jellyfish. Six more gen
erations of gods came into existence after the first five, some of whom had
spouses. The last of the seventh generation were a male and female pair, called
Izanagi-no-mikoto and his spouse, Izanami-no-mikoto. The Nihonshπki pro
vides a number of versions that are roughly similar.
By unanimous voice of all the kami, the last two were given the Heavenly
Jeweled Spear and told to solidify the land. This they did by standing on the
Heavenly Floating Bridge, and stirring the liquid with it. Raising the spear,
droplets fell from the tip and formed solid islands.
The two creator-kami descended to the islands and built a heavenly pillar
and a palace to live in. Having completed the palace, they noted that their bod
ies were constructed somewhat differently. As Izanagi is said to have told
Izanami, “My body, formed though it be formed, has one place which is formed
to excess. Therefore, I would like to take that place in my body which is formed
to excess and insert it into that place in your body which is formed insuffi
ciently, and give birth to the land” (Kπjiki, as cited in Phillipi, 4:4). Izanami
agreed, and the two deities resolved to walk around the pillar, he from the left,
she from the right, meet again, and have conjugal intercourse. They circled
around, but when they met, Izanami exclaimed, “How wonderful! Such a hand
some lad!” Izanagi too was delighted to see her, but he reproved her, saying it
was unseemly for the woman to speak first.
They commenced procreation, but gave birth to a leech-child without arms
or legs (in the Nihonshπki this is the last, rather than the first, child), then to an
island. Distressed, they consulted the senior deities, who informed them that
76 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



the problem was the result of Izanami having improperly spoken first after they
circled the pillar. They repeated their actions, this time getting the greetings in
the right order. As a consequence, Izanami gave birth to the eight islands of
Japan. Then she gave birth to many deities.
Izanami died after giving birth to the fire deity, who burned her genitals as
he was born. In her dying throes she gave birth to many other deities, created
from her organs and discharges. In total she gave birth to fourteen islands and
thirty-five deities. The enraged Izanagi killed the newly born fire deity. The dead
fire-deity’s organs yielded more deities, as did the blood collected on Izanagi’s
sword.
After her death, Izanagi wished to visit his wife in the land of Yπmi (the
underworld). He met her in her great hall in the underworld, and she agreed to
come with him to the land of the living if she received permission from the kami
of hell. Izanagi broke his word to wait patiently, spied on her, and discovered her
putrefied body being eaten by maggots. He fled, and she, accompanied by the
maggots who had turned into snake-thunder deities and her servants, pursued.
He blocked the way after him with a rock, but Izanami cursed Izanagi and his
people that one thousand people would die every day. Izanagi averted the curse
by blessing humanity with 1,500 births every day.
Izanagi purified himself from the taint of the underworld by washing. From
each element of his dress came forth several deities, both pure deities and pol
luted deities. The same happened when he washed his body: From each part he
washed came forth a kami. Seeing his children, he assigned them to rule various
dominions. The three last—Amaterasu-π-mikami, Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto, and
Susano-wo—were especially blessed and so were assigned the rule of heaven,
night, and the ocean. All the kami obeyed their father’s orders and took up the
duties of their office, except the last, Susano-wo. He lamented the loss of his
mother, Izanami, and as a consequence was reassigned by his furious father to
rule over Yπmi. Izanagi then retired to a palace he had built in Izumo.
Susano-wo’s Crimes and the Sun Goddess
As was only proper, Susano-wo came to take leave of his sister Amaterasu before
leaving for his kingdom in Yπmi. Not unnaturally suspicious, she armed and
armored herself, tied up her hair in a masculine manner (women of the archaic
period would have let their hair fall free; men tied it up in bunches), and took a
plentiful supply of arrows. As he approached, she performed a war dance, kicking
the earth up into the air and stamping it down so she sank to her thighs in the
hard ground. Susano-wo protested that his intentions were completely benign and
Mythic Time and Space 77



her suspicions unfounded. He then said he would prove his words: He and his sis
ter would undertake a trial by ordeal. Trials by ordeal were apparently a familiar
feature of life, and Amaterasu agreed. She requested her brother’s sword, broke it
into three pieces, rinsed them in the Heavenly Well, then chewed and spat them
out. The spray from her mouth brought forth three deities.
Susano-wo requested his sister’s string of magatama jewels (which, as a
chieftain, she had taken care to wear into battle). She gave him those from the
right hair bunch on her head. He rinsed them, chewed, and spat. From the spray
emerged a deity. He then borrowed the jewels from her left hair bunch, her hair
band, her left arm, and her right arm, chewing and spraying each time, bringing
forth five deities in all.
The account in the Kπjiki is that Amaterasu conceded defeat: The first three
deities were female, and because they had come from Susano-wo’s possession
(his sword), they were his children. The Nihonshπki account is the reverse:
Because the first children were male, victory went to Susano-wo, and his inno
cent intent was proven.
Susano-wo, never gracious, gleefully ran amuck, emitting the equivalent of
“I’ve won! I’ve won!” He tore down the dikes between the rice paddies in heaven,
covered up the ditches, and finally defecated in the Hall of First Offerings.
Amaterasu was too indulgent with her younger brother. “He only did it
because he was drunk,” she said. “And perhaps he thinks that growing rice is
wasteful.”
Alas, indulging bullies is never a good strategy. Susano-wo’s mischief con
tinued, until one day he caught a heavenly dappled pony, skinned it alive, then
threw the corpse into Amaterasu’s weaving hall. One weaving girl was so
shocked, she hit her genitals with a shuttle and died.
Amaterasu herself, whether from fear or disgust, closed herself into a cave. The
consequences of the solar deity’s retreat were serious: Heaven and earth became
completely dark. The myriad deities called out, and many calamities cursed the
land. The eight million heavenly kami resorted to their usual practice in time of
trouble: They assembled to discuss the issue in the dry bed of the Heavenly River.
Then, taking the necessary materials, they commissioned the smith kami Amat
sumara to make a metal mirror. They commissioned Tamanoya-no-mikoto to
make long strings of magatama beads. They ordered the proper deities to perform
divination to ensure the success of their efforts. Uprooting, then replanting, a sacred
evergreen sakaki bush, they hung offerings on its branches: the jewels and mirror,
along with blue cloth and white cloth. They performed rituals of offering.
Then Amanotachikara-π-no-kami, the strong deity, hid himself behind the
rock closing the cave entrance. The wily deity, Ama-no-uzume bound up her
sleeves and hair, exposed her breasts and genitals, and, standing on a bucket,
78 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



danced a loud and rowdy dance. The eight million kami burst out laughing.
Thinking this behaviour strange (for, after all, she had brought darkness and
gloom to heaven and earth by her retreat), Amaterasu opened the cave door and
demanded what the levity was about. Ama-no-uzume retorted that they were
happy because there was a better deity than Amaterasu around. Then the two
ritual specialist deities showed Amaterasu her own image in the mirror. Amat
erasu, intrigued, opened the cave further and peered out at the mirror. Ameno
tachikara, whose name means “heaven’s strength,” then seized her hand and
pulled her out of the cave. Amenofutotama-no-mikoto, one of the ritual-expert
kami, then closed the entrance to the cave with a sacred rope, which she could
not pass. And light came back to heaven and onto the land.
As for Susano-wo, the source of all this trouble, he was sentenced by the
assembled kami to a fine of one thousand tables of offerings, his beard was
shaved, his nails pulled out, and he was expelled from heaven (and, the
Nihonshπki says, from the Central Land of the Reed Plains as well; some say he
went to Korea). The one thousand tables of offering—cloth, jewel strings, paper,
bronzeware, and foods, such as are still offered at shrines and at ceremonies to the
emperor today—were presumably distributed among the kami.
The Creation of Food for Humankind
Amaterasu heard of a kami named Ukemochi-no-kami living on the Central
Land of the Reed Plains. She sent her brother Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto to inquire
after her. When he arrived at her dwelling, Ukemochi-no-kami took rice and
other foods from her mouth, placed them on offering tables, and gave them to
the visiting kami. Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto was insulted at what he saw as a pol
luting act, and he killed the food goddess. Amaterasu was furious at her mes
senger, vowing never to set eyes upon him again and making him the deity of
the moon, which always rises at night, when the sun is down. She sent to see
the body of the murdered food deity. In the corpse’s head there came to be cat
tle and horses. Millet was found in her forehead, and silkworms in her eyebrows.
Rice was in her belly, and wheat in her genitals. These were presented to Amat
erasu, who declared they would be used by humanity for its living.
Although the former story is told by the Nihonshπki, the Kπjiki tells the
story differently. In that version the offending kami was Susano-wo, who in his
exile asked for shelter from Ugetsu-hime. She took various foods out of her nos
trils, mouth, and rectum, and offered them to him. Insulted by the seeming pol
lution, he killed his hostess. Various foodstuffs and other things useful for
humankind grew out of her eyes, and so on.
Mythic Time and Space 79



The two myths illustrate two important contradictions that would have
been apparent to the Japanese of that age. First, that growth, and the very liveli
hood of humankind, was dependent upon death and decay. With the change of
seasons, plants would die only to spring forth later and yield their seeds, just as
animals would die to make way for their young. No less important was the
sociopolitical commentary. Food was the source of life, but men were socially
dependent upon women to prepare food for them: as a consequence, it is female
deities that are the source of food. Yet, in the male-dominated culture of early
(and modern!) Japan, women were more polluted then men. The food they offer
the male visitors is suspected of contamination and pollution, as, presumably,
can any food be. As neat a put-down of women as can be found anywhere.
Susano-Wo and the Eight-Tailed Dragon
In his wanderings, Susano-wo encountered an elderly kami couple, seven of
whose daughters had been eaten by the eight-tailed dragon of Kushi. Only the
eighth daughter remained, and Susano-wo arrived the eve before the dragon was
expected again. Susano-wo volunteered to slay the serpent (not before extracting
a promise to have the remaining daughter for his bride). They brewed specially
strong wine at his order, and Susano-wo had a strong fence constructed with
eight doors. Inside the doors he laid eight barrels of wine, strongly tied to sturdy
platforms. The dragon arrived, pushing one head through each door and drinking
the wine, then falling into a drunken stupor. Susano-wo drew his sword and
chopped the dragon into pieces. When he cut into the middle tail, his sword
broke, and, digging deeper, he found the sword Kusanagi, which he presented to
Amaterasu, possibly in apology for his previous misdeeds.
He then built a magnificent palace in Izumo, at Suga, and lived there with
his wife, Kushinada-hime. He took another wife as well and fathered a number
of children, who, in turn, fathered their own.
 ̄Okuninushi and His Eighty Brothers
One of Susano-wo’s descendants was named ∏kuninushi. Though he had eighty
brothers and was reckoned the least among them, he finally became master of
the land (kuni-nushi). This is how it came about: All the brothers wanted to
marry Yagami-hime, a great beauty from Inaba. They went to court her, taking
∏kuninushi along as baggage carrier. At Cape Keta they found a rabbit who had
lost its fur. Jokingly, they told the rabbit to cure itself by bathing in the sea, then
80 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



lying in the sun. The rabbit did so and found its skin cracking and the salt seep
ing in with painful results. ∏kuninushi, presumably still struggling with lug
gage, and at the time still named ∏-Namuji-no-kami, passed by. Taking pity on
the rabbit, he asked what had happened.
“I was on Oki Island and wished to visit the mainland,” said the rabbit. “I
tricked the sea crocodile to cross the sea. I told him I would count his relatives
(to show how powerful the crocodile clan was, presumably) by having them lie
side by side from Oki Island to Cape Keta. The crocodiles assembled, and I
skipped from one to the other, counting as I went. Just as I was on the last croc
odile, I boasted about how I had fooled them. The last crocodile seized me and
skinned me of my fur. Then your brothers came by.”
∏kuninushi instructed the rabbit to bathe in fresh water, then roll in the
pollen of a certain grass, which would restore his fur. The rabbit, in gratitude,
prophesied that of all the brothers, ∏kuninushi would win Yagami-hime’s hand.
And so it was.
The eighty brothers were not pleased at this development and plotted to kill
∏kuninushi. At the foot of Mt. Tema they tried their hand at boar hunting, plac
ing ∏kuninushi in ambush, to which they would drive the red boar from above.
Instead, they took a large rock, heated it until it glowed, and rolled it down the
mountain. When ∏kuninushi caught the boulder he was burned to death. His
mother ascended to heaven and pleaded for his life. Two female deities were dis
patched and restored him to life as a beautiful young man.
Once again the eighty brothers tried to kill him. They split a tree, shoved him
inside, then removed the wedge holding the tree open. It snapped shut, crushing
him to death. Again his mother revived him, this time telling him to flee. His
brothers pursued, but as they were about to shoot him, he managed to slip away.
 ̄Okuninushi Is Tested by Susano-wo
∏kuninushi was counseled to go to see Susano-wo, his great-great-great-grand
father, who was living in his palace in a distant country. Upon arrival at the
palace, Suseri-hime, Susano-wo’s daughter, met him. They fell in love and mar
ried. Then she went in to talk to her father, who greeted ∏kuninushi by one of
his five birth names (that is, not as ∏kuninushi). Susano-wo, to try his new son
in-law’s mettle, invited him to sleep in a chamber of snakes. Suseri-hime gave
her new husband a snake-repelling scarf. He waved the scarf about, and the
snakes went to sleep, as he did himself. The following night Susano-wo put him
to sleep in a room full of centipedes and bees. Again his bride gave him a scarf,
and again he slept the night peacefully. Then Susano-wo shot a humming arrow
Mythic Time and Space 81



(the shaft had a bone whistle attached, and it was used to frighten enemies) and
made ∏kuninushi fetch the arrow. While ∏kuninushi searched in a bed of tall
grass, Susano-wo set fire to the grass all round. A mouse came and showed
∏kuninushi a narrow cave in which he hid until danger had passed and the
mouse could bring him the arrow.
∏kuninushi returned the arrow to Susano-wo, who graciously allowed his
new son-in-law to pick lice from his head. But the deity’s head was crawling
with centipedes (he was, after all, the ruler of the underworld as well). ∏kuni
nushi tricked Susano-wo into believing he was removing the centipedes and bit
ing them to death (thus proving his immunity to poison), and the older deity fell
asleep, whereupon the younger deity took his elder’s hair and tied it to the
rafters, blocking the door of the chamber with a boulder.
With the father-in-law asleep and immobilized, ∏kuninushi put his bride on
his back and escaped, not forgetting to steal Susano-wo’s sword, bow and arrows,
and jeweled kπtπ (zither, a harplike instrument). As he fled, the kπtπ brushed
against a tree and its sound awakened the sleeper. As Susano-wo jumped up, he
pulled the hall down with his hair, and by the time he had gotten himself out of
the ruins, the young couple were far away. Susano-wo pursued them to the bor
ders of his land, but they escaped. From the distance he blessed them, saying
∏kuninushi should assume his proper name, and, using the weapons he had
stolen, subdue his brothers. He should make Suseri-hime his chief wife, and
raise a great palace. Susano-wo ended his blessing (either under his breath or in
an exclamation of approval for a crafty rival and descendant) “You scoundrel!”
∏kuninushi did indeed subdue his brothers. He then raised his great hall,
and took over the task of creating the land.
Versions of this myth should be very familiar to readers of European legends,
and there are numerous variants, with or without the giant’s/witch’s/god’s
daughter (for example, Jack and the beanstalk). It has been suggested by Little
ton (1995) that another common Japanese myth, that of Yamato-takeru, is very
similar to the legend of Arthur, and he has managed to trace the legend to a
source of Central Asian nomads, from whom it dispersed east and west as those
people split and migrated into Europe and Siberia. The similarity of the story of
∏kuninushi and his father-in-law may well reinforce the case, and may have
first been told by those same people.
 ̄Okuninushi and Sukunabikona Finish Creating the Land
∏kuninushi married several times, arousing the ire of his chief wife, Suseri
hime, and causing his first wife Yagami-hime, the beauty of Inaba, to abandon
82 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



her husband and child and return home. Possibly because of the press of the great
number of offspring that resulted from his many marriages, the deity continued
the process of creating the land started initially by Izanami and Izanagi. While
he was busy in Izumo, a dwarf deity approached ∏kuninushi, carried across the
waves on a boat made of a tree pod wearing the skin of a wagtail (or, according
to one version of the Nihonshπki, a goose, which would have made him slightly
larger). The dwarf deity would not speak, so the toad deity suggested they ask
the scarecrow kami Kuyebiko, who, though without feet, was out in all weather
and all seasons and knew everything under the skies. It was revealed to them
that the dwarf deity, Sukunabikona by name, was one of the thousand sons of
one of the heavenly deities, Kamimusubi-no-kami (says the Kπjiki) or
Takamimusubi-no-mikoto (says the Nihonshπki). The two deities, ∏kuninushi
and Sukunabikona, then set forth to solidify and create the land, which Izanagi
and Izanami had left unfinished.
The substance of this myth, with the complex genealogy that is described,
is closely related to the following story of the conquest of earth by the heavenly
deities. There are several versions of these myths, in the Kπjiki (which is the
source most strongly advocated and made “authoritative” by supporters of the
Imperial status-quo and the Great Tradition) and Nihonshπki, but also in the
Engishiki, another compendium of myth and prayer. In the latter versions, the
Izumo partisans are painted much more favorably. This supports the view that
historically, there must have existed a body of myth/history of the Izumo peo
ple, which was substantially different from that of the Yamato people. When the
latter’s state expanded at the expense of the former, the two mythological/his
torical accounts were blended. The Yamato scribes or scholars, having the more
dominant position, naturally tended to belittle the personalities and accom
plishments of the Izumo deities.
The Heavenly Deities Subdue the Land: First Attempt, with Weak Son
The procreative actions of Susano-wo and of ∏kuninushi, which are detailed in
extensive “begat” lists in the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki, seemed to have
alarmed the deities of heaven. Most of the earthly deities married several times,
either happily or unhappily (as ∏kuninushi), and many important deities of spe
cific locations—as well as of specific functions, such as the hearth deity—were
born.
Amaterasu commanded her son Ame-no-oshi-homimi-no-mikoto (who was
one of those born in her struggle with Susano-wo) to go down to the land and
take possession. However, as he stood outside heaven, on the Heavenly Floating
Mythic Time and Space 83



Bridge from which the earth had originally been formed, he saw that the earth
was in an uproar (as result, presumably, of the actions of ∏kuninushi’s large
family). There were gods flitting to and fro, lighting up the night sky like fire
flies. Evil spirits buzzed like flies, and trees and rocks talked and could move
about. He returned in some fear to report to his mother.
As was their custom, the heavenly deities assembled in the dry riverbed of
Ame-no-yasunokawa, the heavenly river. They decided to send another of Amat
erasu’s sons, Amenohohi-no-kami, to subdue the land. This deity, the Kπjiki (15:
21) notes, was the ancestor of the Izumo rulers and an untrustworthy emissary.
The Engishiki, in contrast, sees him as someone sent to prepare the eventual
subjugation of the land. In any case, he descended to the Central Land of Reed
Plains but began to curry favor with ∏kuninushi and did not return for three
years.
The Heavenly Deities Subdue the Land: Second Attempt, with Pheasant
Once again Takamimusubi and Amaterasu-π-mikami assembled the eight mil
lion deities and asked for advice. This time they decided to send the kami Ame
no-wakahiko. To ensure he was better prepared, they gave him a magical bow
and arrows. This attempt was not any more successful than the first. Like his
predecessor, Ame-no-wakahiko was seduced by the earthly deities, courting and
marrying ∏kuninushi’s daughter Shitateru-hime. Possibly by doing so he hoped
to become ∏kuninushi’s heir. In any case, the Kπjiki reports he planned on keep
ing the land for himself. After eight years with no results, the heavenly deities
started worrying again, and they once again convened a meeting. They sent the
pheasant to question Ame-no-wakahiko. The kami shot the pheasant to death
with the bow and arrow he had received with his commission. The arrow passed
through the pheasant, then rebounded all the way up to heaven, to the dry
riverbed where Takamimusubi-no-kami and Amaterasu-π-mikami were still in
conference. Takamimusubi-no-kami recognized the arrow and, showing it to the
assembled deities, said a spell: “If this arrow has been used against evil kami,
then let Ame-no-wakahiko be safe from it; if he be treacherous, let it slay him!”
and he thrust it down the way it had come. The arrow hit Ame-no-wakahiko in
the chest, and he died. His wife’s laments were so loud they were heard in
heaven, and Ame-no-wakahiko’s parents and siblings knew he was dead and
made a funeral house. Houses in which people died, or those associated with
death, were polluted and were therefore, if at all possible, erected for the pur
pose, then torn down again. One consequence of this custom, prevalent in pre
84 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Nara Japan, was the constant movement of the Yamato capital, which occurred
whenever a reigning monarch died. This was observed until the foundation of
Nara in the sixth century C.E.
The Heavenly Deities Subdue the Land: Third Time Lucky
Once again the heavenly deities conferred, deciding to send Takemikazuchi-no
kami (a powerful warrior deity). Accompanied by Amenotoribune-no-kami (bird
boat deity, who may have been merely his transport) or by Futsunushi-no-kami
(another sword deity, this time mentioned in the Nihonshπki version), he
descended to Inaba beach in Izumo. Unsheathing his sword, he showed his cre
dentials by planting the sword hilt on the crest of a wave, then sitting on the
point nonchalantly.
He then inquired of ∏kuninushi what were his intentions with regard to the
land, which was the possession of Amaterasu’s descendants. ∏kuninushi asked
to confer with his son Kotoshironushi. When the younger deity returned from
his hunting trip, he heard Takemikazuchi-no-kami’s claims, then counseled his
father to heed the heavenly deities. With magical gestures, he made himself
invisible and retired to a grove to become an invisible kami.
“Now will you submit?” asked Takemikazuchi-no-kami.
“I’ve got another son,” replied ∏kuninushi. “He must be asked too.”
The son, Takeminakata, arrived carrying a large boulder on his fingertips.
He challenged Takemikazuchi to a wrestling bout. As the rebellious son seized
Takemikazuchi’s arm, the heavenly deity changed it to an icicle. Takeminakata
tried again; this time the arm was changed to a sword blade. Takeminakata
retired in panic. Now it was Takemikazuchi’s turn. He grasped his opponent’s
arm, crushing it like a reed. Takeminakata ran away, with Takemikazuchi in hot
pursuit. The fight ended on the banks of Lake Suwa (in modern Nagano). When
Takeminakata was about to be killed, he pleaded for his life, vowing he would
settle there, at Lake Suwa, and would yield the land, as his father had, to the
heavenly deities. The shrine of Suwa stands there, on the spot, to this day.
Takemikazuchi returned to ∏kuninushi to demand once again whether the
latter was satisfied: His sons had agreed to submit. ∏kuninushi admitted that
they were in agreement but added a rider: He would have a palace built in Izumo,
on Tagishi Beach. It would be a magnificent palace, rooted in the earth and
roofed at the height of heaven. There would be a bridge there, over the Heavenly
River, by which means ∏kuninushi could come and go. The Heavenly Bird-Boat
would also be put at his disposal for the same reason. Special foods from the sea,
cooked by fire lit from a fire drill and served on special clay plates, would be
Mythic Time and Space 85



offered. And Kotoshironushi would be “the vanguard and the rearguard” of the
deities, to ensure that no rebellion took place. He himself, ∏kuninushi, though
yielding the material possessions (that is, the land), would retain dominion over
the invisible (the realm of the divine, the religious, and the magical). And so it
came to pass. To this day the magnificent shrine of Izumo Taisha stands in
Izumo. Special offerings are made, and the fire still is lit with a fire drill. (A fire
drill is one of the many types of fire-making implements used by premodern peo
ple to light a fire at will—an important skill for any person or people without
modern conveniences. It consists of a bowlike implement whose string is
wrapped around a length of hard wood. This “arrow” of hard wood is inserted
into a board of soft wood surrounded by some tinder or punk. By drawing the
bow rapidly back and forth, sufficient heat can be generated by friction, which
lights the tinder.) This illustrates the magical nature of ∏kuninushi: The ability
to make fire would have been, in a traditional society, a highly magical act.
The Heavenly Grandson Descends to Take Possession of the Central Land of the Reed Plains
The time had come to settle the land, and Takamimusubi-no-kami and Amat
erasu commanded her son Ame-no-oshi-homimi-no-mikoto to get on with it. He
demurred, as he had before, and suggested that his newborn son, product of his
union with Takamimusubi-no-kami’s daughter, should be sent instead. The two
grandparents agreed, and the heavenly grandson, Ninigi-no-mikoto, was dis
patched to the land. As he was about to leave, a fearsome glowing apparition
appeared at the heavenly crossroads. The heavenly deities sent the crafty and
decisive Ame-no-uzume to inquire who the interfering deity was. He identified
himself as Sarutahiko-no-kami, an earthly deity. He had a ferocious aspect: An
inner fire made his mouth, posterior, and eyes glow cherry-red. He was over
seven feet tall, and his nose was seven hands (about eighty-five centimeters)
long. However, convinced by Ame-no-uzume, he consented to serve as a guide
to the heavenly grandson. Amaterasu and Takamimusubi-no-kami ordered five
other deities, including Ame-no-uzume, to accompany their grandson and serve
as his subordinates and counselors. Eventually they became the ancestors of the
most important Yamato clans. Amaterasu also gave her grandson the magatama
beads and mirror that had been used to lure her from her cave, and the sword
Kusanagi she had received from her brother, Susano-wo. She then ordered a num
ber of other deities to serve him in various ritual and managerial capacities. The
heavenly grandson descended through the multiple layers of heaven to Mount
Takachio in Himuka (in modern Kyushu), where he built his palace.
86 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Having built his palace, he courted Kπnπhanasakuya-hime, daughter of Oya
matsumi-no-kami, a mountain deity. In addition to Kπnπhanasakuya-hime
(Flower-blossom princess), the father also gave the bridegroom his older daugh
ter, the ugly Iwanaga-hime (Long-rock princess). He returned the ugly sister, and
her ashamed father said: “I gave my two daughters to the divine grandson to
ensure his life would last as long as the rocks, and as flourishing as the blossoms
of the trees. He has rejected Long-rock princess, and therefore his prosperity and
life shall be as evanescent as the blossoming of the trees.” And indeed, from that
day on, the emperors have never lived very long.
After they had spent no more than one night together, Kπnπhanasakuya
hime became pregnant. Her husband accused her of infidelity with one of the
earth deities, for, after all, how could she have become pregnant after only one
night of marriage? She proved her innocence by setting fire to the parturition
house, from which she and the baby emerged unscathed. The child was named
Hoderi-no-mikoto, and after him were born Hosuseri-no-mikoto and Ho-ori-no
mikoto, also known as Amatsuhiko-Hikohohodemi-no-mikoto.
Ho-ori Loses His Brother’s Fish-Hook
Hoderi, Ninigi’s oldest son, was a fisherman, whereas Ho-ori, the last born, was
a hunter. Each had a luck fetish—an object that ensured success in their enter
prise—a fishhook and hunting implements, respectively. Ho-ori badgered his
brother to exchange fetishes, which the elder brother finally consented to. But
Ho-ori was such a poor fisherman that not only did he not catch a single fish, he
even lost the fishhook fetish. When the time came to return the fetishes to their
original owners, Ho-ori could not come up with the goods, and even a gift of five
hundred fishhooks made from the fragments of his sword would not mollify his
older brother.
Eventually, pressed by his brother, Ho-ori received some advice from a
passer-by. Making a bamboo coracle, he set out to sea, where he found the fish
scaled palace of Owatatsumi-no-kami, kami of the sea. There he hid himself in
the branches of a tree overlooking the palace wall and awaited the coming of the
sea-king’s daughter. A maid out to draw water from the well saw him reflected
in her pitcher and offered him a drink. Drawing a jewel he wore around his neck,
he moistened it with his saliva and dropped it into the water vessel, whereupon
it stuck. The servant showed it to her mistress, Toyotama-hime, and the
princess went out to see the handsome young man her handmaiden had
described. They immediately fell in love and became man and wife. Introduced
to his son-in-law, Owatatsumi-no-kami immediately recognized Ho-ori as
Mythic Time and Space 87



Ninigi’s son. He blessed the wedding, giving the customary trousseau of one
hundred tables laden with gifts.
After living with his wife for three years, Ho-ori became homesick. He
explained his circumstances to his father-in-law. Owatatsumi promptly sum
moned all the fishes and asked if any had found the lost fishhook. A bream had
something lodged in his throat, which proved to be the missing article. Owatat
sumi instructed the young man in a spell that would bring bad luck to the hook’s
user.
He then instructed the young man to build his rice paddies at a different ele
vation from his brother’s: “If he builds them high, you build them low; if he
builds low, you build high. Since I am the lord of the waters, if he builds high, I
will deprive his fields of water; if he builds low, I will flood them.”
In addition, Owatatsumi gave Ho-ori two jewels, one that would raise the
tides, the other that would lower them. Should Hoderi attack, Ho-ori could use
the tide-raising jewel to drown him. Should the brother be penitent, then Ho-ori
could lower the tides and give his brother his life. He then sent a crocodile to
carry Ho-ori in one day to his old home. There he did as instructed by Owatat
sumi. His brother became poorer and more desperate, eventually attacking Ho
ori, who countered with the tide-raising jewel. When Hoderi pleaded with his
brother, Ho-ori used the other jewel to save him. And so it went, until Hoderi
vowed to serve his brother.
Toyotama-hime emerged from the sea to join her husband and give birth to
their first child. They built a parturition hut on the beach, and she instructed her
husband not to observe her as she gave birth. Curious, he secretly watched and
saw his wife turn into a giant crocodile as she experienced the birth-pangs.
Ashamed that she had been seen in her animal state, Toyotama-hime returned
to the sea, leaving her child with its father. Though she was angry at her hus
band for disobeying her request, she sent her younger sister, Tamayori-hime, to
nurse the child. Ho-ori then dwelt in his palace of Takachiho for five hundred
years.
Jimmu Tenno, the First Emperor
The son of Ho-ori and Toyotama-hime eventually married his aunt, Tamayori
hime. They had four sons. When they came into adulthood, the youngest, Kamu
Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto, suggested to the eldest, Itsuse-no-mikoto, that
they should leave the palace of Takachiho their great-grandfather had built in
Himuka in Kyushu, and travel to establish imperial rule. They traveled peace
fully for the most part, resting from time to time for lengthy periods in halls they
88 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



built along the way, or were entertained by the local inhabitants. At Shirakata,
however, they were ambushed by Nagasunehiko of Toumi, a local ruler. Itsuse
no-mikoto was wounded. The two princes nonetheless defeated their enemies
and traveled on to the land of Kii, where Itsuse died of his wounds.
Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto and his entourage traveled to Kumano
in Kii, where a mysterious force affected them and they all fell asleep. A man
from Kumano named Takakuraji came to Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto,
the future emperor, bringing him a sword. In a dream, Takakuraji had seen the
two heavenly deities Amaterasu-π-mikami and Takamimusubi discussing the
difficulties their descendant was experiencing. They ordered Takemikazuchi-no
kami (the deity who had subdued ∏kuninushi and his sons) to descend and help.
He suggested they send down his sword through a hole in the roof of Takaku
raji’s storehouse and alert the owner to pass the gift along. “Indeed,” concluded
Takakuraji, “when I woke this morning, I found the sword and hastened to pres
ent it to you.” As soon as the sword was brought to him, all of the unruly deities
of the Kumano mountains, who were responsible for the spell that had put the
emperor and his men to sleep, were vanquished.
Takamimusubi then sent a giant crow to lead his descendant to safety.
Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto journeyed on, meeting many local deities
who greeted him with respect, until he reached a place called Uda. At Uda were
two chiefs of the Ukashi people, Elder-brother and Younger-brother. When the
crow came to ask whether the heavenly deities’ descendant would be received,
Elder-brother Ukashi shot at the messenger with a humming arrow (intended to
produce fear in the victim). He then built a trap inside a festival hall constructed
to welcome his guests. But his younger brother disapproved, and he came and
disclosed the trap to the intended victim. Thereupon Elder-brother Ukashi was
driven before Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto’s forces into the hall and was
caught by his own trap and hacked to bits by his intended victims. They also
composed a satirical song:
On the high place of Uda
We set a bird net.
We waited,
But no birds were caught.
Instead, a fine whale
Fell into our net.
Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto then traveled on to Osaka, where
eighty men of the Tsuchigumo lived in a traditional pit dwelling. He invited
them to a feast with his men acting as servitors, one man standing behind each
Mythic Time and Space 89



guest. At a signal, the eighty servants drew their swords and killed the eighty
heroes of Osaka. Finally, after subduing many other tribes, Kamu-Yamatoihare
hiko-no-mikoto built himself a palace called Kashihara at Unebi and assumed
his reign-name, Jimmu Tenno, as first emperor of Japan.
Yamato-takeru, the Hero of Yamato
Several generations of emperors passed. Emperor Keikπ had two sons, Ousu-no
mikoto and Wousu-no-mikoto. “Large Mortar” and “Little Mortar” were appar
ently twins. Their father, as was the custom at the time, had had to carry around
a rice-pounding mortar while his wife was in labor, and he was somewhat
annoyed at the length of time the birth took, hence the names. Ousu-no-mikoto,
the elder brother, failed to join the emperor for the morning or evening meals (at
that time, the Japanese ate only two main meals a day). Some time before, Ousu
no-mikoto had been commissioned by his father to bring him two sisters, famed
for their beauty, to be his wives. The son took the two for himself, substituting
two other women, so he was in bad odor with his father in any case.
The emperor asked his second son, Wousu, to teach his older brother some
manners.
Five days passed and the older brother still did not appear.
“Why hasn’t your brother come? Have you warned him about his behavior?”
the emperor asked his second son.
“I have,” replied the stripling calmly.
“How did you warn him?”
“I caught him in the morning, when he went to the outhouse. I crushed him,
then tore off his arms and legs, wrapping them in a mat and throwing them
away.”
The emperor was not unnaturally terrified at this display of savagery and
strength, and dispatched his son to the west, where dwelt two rebellious men,
Kumasπ-takeru (Heroes of Kumasπ) the Elder and the Younger, telling Wousu to
kill them. Equipped only with a set of women’s clothing supplied by his aunt,
the High Priestess of Amaterasu-π-mikami at Ise, and his small-sword, Wousu
set off.
When he arrived at the Kumasπ domain, he found they were about to cele
brate the construction of a new pit dwelling. Guards surrounded the new con
struction. The young lad waited for the feast, then combed his hair over in the
way of young girls and dressed in his prescient aunt’s gift. With these he sneaked
in with the local women. The Heroes of Kumasπ were very much taken by this
fresh and unknown maiden and had “her” sit between them during the feast.
90 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



When the drinking and excitement had allayed their caution, our hero drew his
short sword from his bosom and stabbed the Elder Hero of Kumasπ to death. The
Younger Kumasπ-takeru jumped up to flee, but was caught by the prince at the
foot of the ladder leading up from the pit. There the attacker grabbed his victim
and stabbed him clear through the body from behind.
“Don’t remove the sword!” cried the Kumasπ-takeru..
The young prince assented.
“Who are you?” asked the Younger Kumasπ-takeru.
“I’m the son of emperor Keikπ, who rules all these islands. He sent me to
pacify you disrespectful Kumasπ.”
“We are the bravest men in the West, and you have killed us,” said the
Younger Kumasπ-takeru. “I therefore bestow upon you the title we bore. You
will be known henceforth as Yamato-takeru, Hero of the Yamato.”
When Kumasπ-takeru had had his say, the prince, now known by his new
name, withdrew the sword, slicing his victim like a ripe melon. On his way
back, he subdued all the local mountain and river deities.
Yamato-takeru’s father must have been less than reassured by his savage
offspring’s return, and the next we hear of him, he was dispatched to kill Izumo
takeru, another local hero. Yamato-takeru prepared an imitation sword of wood,
which he wore instead of a real one. Then he entered the land of Izumo, pre
tending friendship with his intended victim. One day the two heroes went to
bathe in the Hii River. Yamato-takeru emerged first from the water and cried
“Let us exchange swords!” The other agreed, taking Yamato-takeru’s fake
sheathed sword and thrusting it through his sash. Then Yamato-takeru said,
“Let’s practice fencing.” Yamato-takeru then drew his borrowed blade and
killed his hapless victim. Never at loss for words, he then mocked the other in
a poem:
The hero of Izumo,
Land of the heavy cloud banks.
Wears a sword,
Vine sheathed
But alas, without a blade.
He then returned to report to his father.
The emperor was not anxious to keep his rather intemperate son at home,
so he sent him on another mission, this time to subdue the East. The emperor
also gave his son a single attendant and a magical spear. On his way, Yamato
takeru stopped once again with his aunt, the high priestess of the shrine to
Amaterasu-π-mikami at Ise. He complained to his aunt that his father wanted to
Mythic Time and Space 91



get rid of him, sending him to subdue a country without any troops. His aunt,
helpful as ever, gave him the sword Kusanagi, which had been the gift of Susano
wo, and a bag.
“Should there be a problem,” she said, “Open the bag.”
On his way he met a maiden, Miyazu-hime, in Owari, and promised to
marry her on his return. He then proceeded to the East and subdued the tribes
there. Eventually he reached Sagamu. The king of that land (taking a page from
Yamato-takeru’s own book) pretended friendship, but said:
“Near here is a plain. In the middle of it is a pond, where lives a rebellious
and unruly deity.”
When the hero went to check on the pond, the king set fire to the grass on
the plain. Yamato-takeru looked into the bag he had been given and found fire
making flints. He mowed down the grass around him with his sword (justifying
the sword’s name of “Grass-cutter”) then set a counterfire. He then killed the
king and all his clan, burning them in their houses, and called the place Yakitsu
(Burning ford). Never at a loss for words, he was making a pun: yaki can also
mean “roast”.
On his way back home, he had to cross the sea straits at Hashirimitsu. But
the deity of the crossing stirred up the waves, and the boat was about to sink.
Yamato-takeru’s consort, Otπtachibana-hime, sacrificed herself to the waves,
piling sedge mats, skin mats, and silk mats one on the other, then laying them
and herself as offering on the waves. The boat proceeded on its way, and the
princess sank into the waves. Only her comb was washed ashore. At the pass of
Ashigara, as Yamato-takeru was eating his rations, the deity of the pass assumed
the form of a white deer. Yamato-takeru took a piece of wild garlic he was eat
ing and struck the deer, killing it. At the top of the pass he remembered his wife,
and sighing, named the land he had pacified Azuma (“My wife”). After pacifying
more lands on his way, he returned to Owari and married Miyazu-hime, whom
he had courted on his way to the East. Leaving his bride at her house and entrust
ing her with his sword Kusanagi, he went to subdue the deity of Mt. Ibuki. With
out a sword, he decided to take on the deity with his bare hands. On his way he
met a giant boar, which was the deity in disguise. “This must be the deity’s mes
senger, sent to distract me,” he said to himself, and proceeded up the mountain.
But the deity caused a hailstorm that struck Yamato-takeru and dazed him, so
he had to come down off the mountain, mortally ill. He walked from there, pro
gressively getting worse (and composing poems about his condition, in the best
heroic tradition) until, at Nπbo, he died.
As his wives and children (presumably the story compresses several years
of the hero’s life, during which he married several times, became emperor, and
fathered children) assembled to construct his tomb, the spirit of the hero was
92 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



transformed into a giant white bird, which flew away. It finally alighted near
the shore at Shiki, where his tomb was built and is called the White Bird
Tomb.
The Empress Jing  ̄u Subdues Korea, and the Kami Hachiman Is Born
Years later, with imperial rule established, Emperor Ch∆ai was playing his zither
when his empress, Okinagatarashi-hime, known as Jing∆, became possessed and
uttered the following prophecy: “There is a land to the west, abounding with
treasures of gold, silver, and jewels. I give you this country.”
The emperor was suspicious, dismissing the words as those of a deceiving
kami. In any case, he was preparing for an expedition to subdue the Kumasπ of
the South. He therefore replied, “When one climbs a mountain and looks west
ward, one sees only the sea.”
The enraged kami then said (through the empress), “You will not rule this
promised land.” And, indeed, the emperor soon died. After a lengthy process of
exorcism and searching out sins throughout the country, the empress prophesied
again, giving the same instructions, with one rider: “The child in your womb
will rule that land.” The kami giving these instructions were Sokojutsu-no-π,
Nakajutsu-no-π, and Uwajutsu-no-π, children of Izanagi and lords of the sea. The
now-pregnant Empress Jing∆ then assembled a fleet and army, made offerings to
the kami, and was borne by the good winds across the sea to the land of Shiragi
(the kingdom of Silla in Korea), whose king became a vassal offering annual trib
ute. The king was designated a royal stable-groom. Though not a high rank, this
was not a mark of shame: It was definite acknowledgment of the king of Shi
ragi’s position at court, and in effect, a royal honor (he didn’t have to feed or
curry the horses with his own hands!). The king of Kudara also became a vassal,
and his lands became property of the Japanese throne. Meanwhile the empress
delayed the birth of her son by tying rocks to the waist of her skirt.
When she returned to Japan, her child, named ∏jin, was born in a place
called Umi. At Matsura in Tsukushi she ate a meal on the banks of the river.
Using grains of rice for bait, she fished from some rocks for ayu (a small river
fish). This was during the fourth month, and since then, only women can catch
the ayu on that month using the traditional method taught by Jing∆.
Upon her return, Empress Jing∆ was faced by a rebellion of two of Emperor
Ch∆ai’s children by another wife. The imperial forces used a ruse, saying that
the baby emperor was dead. When the rebels came to inspect the funeral ship
bearing the supposed body, the loyalist army attacked, chasing the rebels to
Yamashirπ. The loyalist general then used another ruse, announcing that the
Mythic Time and Space 93



empress had died. The rebels again believed the story and unstrung their bows.
The loyalists attacked again, and the rebels were defeated, whereupon they
jumped into the waters of Lake Biwa and drowned.
∏jin reigned as emperor for fifty-two years. His mother, Jing∆, lived for one
hundred. He had many children from several wives and extended the domain of
the empire. While thus engaged, however, he was also a man of culture. He
ensured that his sons and other men of his court were diligent in their studies.
During his reign, many Korean immigrants—craftsmen, traders, and scholars
settled in his domains. As a consequence, he was deified with his mother as
Hachiman, the kami of both war and culture.
THE AGE OF HEROES
The subsequent mythological age was an age of heroes. Though the doings of the
Imperial family were noted in great detail in the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki, they
turned from the mythical to the mundane: the murders, squabbles, loves, and
children of assorted emperors and empresses. Many of these details may be fac
tual and, indeed, can be traced through documents and artifacts of the time.
In parallel, however, and recorded not in the “official” accounts of the
emperors’ reigns and chronicles, myths began emerging about individuals
mainly men but also some women—who performed acts of heroism and
strength. Some of these are enhancements of real historical events, seen through
a mythical lens. Many of the earlier heroes were continuing the work of “paci
fying” the countryside started by Ninigi-no-mikoto and were working under the
authority, claimed or real, of the emperor. Later heroes, such as Yoshitsune,
were warriors through and through. Their loyalty was to their clan and lord, or
to themselves alone. And, as we get to later myths, more and more Buddhist ele
ments are inserted, until the Shintπ elements we saw in the creation and pacifi
cation tales—myths about how things came to be, myths about the kami, myths
that gave charters to various families or clans—tend to disappear.
Historically, the Age of Heroes corresponds to the Heian (794–1185) and
Kamakura (1185–1333) periods of Japanese history. A multitude of heroic myths
emerge from this age: Tawara Toda, the archer hero and ally of the dragon king;
En-no-Gyπja, the ascetic wizard and subduer of demons; and Kπbπ Daishi, the
Shingon saint, are all products of the Heian period. In each case the hero is a real
historical figure to whom a mythical dimension has been added. The warrior
heroes such as Tawara Toda and Raikπ act in the name of the emperor, subdu
ing rebels and bandits, many of them monstrous in appetite and appearance. The
saints and wizards are all busy extending the rule of law (the emperor’s) and the
94 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



realm of the Law (the Buddha’s). If the previous mythical period was one of cre
ation and then conquest, this period is one of consolidation and civilization of a
fractious hinterland. Two important myths arose from this period: the heroic
tale of Yoshitsune, the perfect warrior; and the kamikaze divine wind sent by
the kami Hachiman in the battle against the invading Mongol-Chinese armies
of Kubilai Khan (1274, 1281).
The heroes are generally a rough lot. Like Yamato-takeru, they triumph by
a combination of guile and force, using treachery and disguise when necessary.
One important feature to remember is that they often operated with a retinue of
retainers, sometimes one loyal servant, sometimes more. Many of these retain
ers, such as Musashibπ Benkei and Kintarπ, became more popular than their
masters.
Tawara Toda, the Archer
Among the early heroes was Fujiwara Hidesato. Nicknamed Tawara Toda (Lord
Rice Bale) for his ability to lift a rice bale (60 kg, or 132 lb.) in either hand,
Tawara Toda was the foremost archer of his time. When a local ruler in the
Kantπ area (in what is today Chiba prefecture), Taira no Masakado by name,
rebelled against imperial authority, Tawara Toda went to inspect the rebel, try
ing to decide whether to support him. He found Masakado eating dinner and
agreed to share his meal. As they ate, Toda noticed that Masakado was absently
picking up grains of rice he had spilled onto his robes and popping them into his
mouth. At that he decided that Masakado was a mean man, unlikely to be gen
erous to his supporters, and he promptly joined the imperial forces and brought
about the defeat of Masakado.
Tawara Toda went on to other adventures. His most famous involved meet
ing Ry∆jin, the dragon kami. As the hero was about to cross a bridge on Lake
Biwa, he found his way blocked by a serpent. He stepped carefully over the ani
mal, which turned into a dragon. The dragon informed the hero that he was
Ry∆jin, and that his kingdom was being plagued by a giant centipede. Tawara
Toda accompanied the dragon back to his realm, where he confronted and
attacked the centipede. His first arrows were shot accurately, but to no effect. He
mastered his resources, wetted his last arrow with his own saliva, and with the
arrow thus magicked, shot the centipede to death. The inexhaustible sack of rice
he received from the grateful dragon may also have brought about his nickname.
Mythic Time and Space 95



Raiko ̄ and His Band of Heroes
Minamoto-no-Yorimitsu was a famous archer during the reign of Emperor
Murakami. Nicknamed Raikπ, he is credited with ridding the land of many rob
bers and rebels (the terms being almost synonymous in Japan at that period) and
extending the rule of the emperor throughout the land. Raikπ is at one and the
same time an extension of the imperial will, following in the footsteps of Jimmu
Tenno and a figure of the sort that was extremely important for later Japanese
myth: the head of a group of heroes, rather than a lone hand. The myths about
Raikπ, which can be found in various localities throughout Japan, have a dis
tinctly local flavor, associating topographic features with the imperial will, and
thus associating wide-flung areas of the empire with imperial rule.
Woman Heroes
Though Japanese culture has, at least since the injection of Chinese culture,
been intensely male-oriented, Japanese myths contain a number of instances of
female heroes. Amaterasu and Empress Jing∆ have already been discussed, and
they belong properly to the pre-sinicized era. However, even during the aristo
cratic and medieval periods there were a few instances of female warriors.
Of them the one who is most famous in Japanese myth is Tomoe Gozen, the
wife of Kido Hidesato, one of the Minamoto generals. There is no evidence of her
existence beyond the legend, which tells of her military prowess (she led a troop
of some three thousand defending against Taira attacks). Several other female
heroes are also recorded, including some strong women, able to lift rice bales or
fight with tree boles.
What is common to all these myths is their tragic overtones: In almost all
cases, Tomoe Gozen included, the woman ends up either being killed or being
made the property of an eventual victor. In that sense these stories are part of the
myths that tell of things-as-they-should-be. Strong as a woman is, she is after all
a woman and therefore must play second fiddle (or concubine) to a successful
man.
Benkei and Yoshitsune
This story starts, oddly enough, with the servant, not the master. Benkei was a
sπhei, one of the armed monk-soldiers who defended their monasteries (in his
case, Enryakuji, of the Tendai sect, on Mt. Hiei). The sπhei of Mt. Hiei—which
96 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



is clearly visible from today’s Kyoto, weather and pollution permitting—were in
the habit of descending on the imperial court whenever their monasteries did
not receive what they considered their due in respect or handouts, and the
monasteries and temples were not fighting among themselves. Benkei was a
powerful man of violent temper. He wore black-lacquered armor, which made
him instantly recognizable. On one occasion, Benkei stole the giant bell of the
Miidera temple over the mountains on the shores of Lake Biwa, east of the cap
ital, and carried it home on his shoulders. Japanese temple bells tend to be large
items. The one at Miidera is almost the height of a man. Prevailed upon by his
abbot to return it, he contemptuously gave the bell a kick, and it bounced back
to its place of origin.
At one stage, unable to find a rival to test his mettle, Benkei set up shop in
the middle of one of Heian-kyπ’s major bridges. He had made a vow, he said, to
have armor forged of the swords of one thousand warriors. He therefore chal
lenged every passer-by who carried one to a duel, the sword to be forfeit to the
winner. One day a handsome youth tried to cross the bridge. He was made up in
the proper manner for a young bushi (warrior) who had not yet undergone the
adulthood ceremony, and he was playing a flute. Because he also carried a sword,
Benkei challenged him. The young man, Ushiwakamaru (Young Bull) by name,
nimbly outfought his gigantic opponent, defending himself with little but his
flute and folding fan. Benkei was so impressed by his foe that he vowed to serve
Ushiwakamaru for the rest of his life.
Ushiwakamaru himself, better known by his adult name, Yoshitsune, was
the younger son of the Minamoto clan chief who had lost his head to the Taira.
He had only been saved by the quick wits and sheer grit of his mother, who had
married her Taira captor. Ushiwakamaru had been sent to serve as a novice in a
temple on Mt. Kurama, north of the capital. His elder brother, Yoritomo, by now
an adult, was in hiding in eastern Japan. At Kurama, Yoshitsune (not, apparently,
religiously inclined) was wont to wander the woods, where he made friends with
a dai tengu, a wild forest spirit. The tengu had instructed the young man in the
art of fencing, and by the time he had left Mt. Kurama to come to the capital, he
was already the best-trained fencer in Japan.
When Yoritomo raised the flag of rebellion against the Taira, Ushiwaka
maru, now bearing his adult name Yoshitsune, became one of his generals.
Numerous military victories are ascribed to him, the greatest being the final
defeat of the Taira at Dan-no-Ura. But his fame endures, and myths about him
emerged, because of his brother’s attempts to kill him. Yoritomo, always highly
suspicious of his subordinates, became convinced that Yoshitsune intended to
supplant him. In a series of campaigns Yoritomo forced Yoshitsune to flee,
finally catching and burning Yoshitsune to death along with his castle and
Mythic Time and Space 97



retainers. Japanese myth claims that Yoshitsune actually escaped, establishing
himself as a Mongol warrior named Temujin, and giving birth to the Mongol
dynasty of Genghis Khan. Throughout his exploits, he had the loyal Benkei at
his side. Once, while they were crossing a frontier barrier at San no Kuchi,
Yoshitsune, who had a “Wanted” notice out for him, had to disguise himself as
a servant, and Benkei posed as his master. To complete the ruse, Yoshitsune
required that Benkei beat him in front of the barrier commander. So moved was
the commander by Benkei’s obvious distress at having to beat his “servant” that
he let them through.
The greatest myth of the Age of Heroes, however, relates to the nature of
Japan rather than to any particular individual. The thirteenth-century invasion
of Japan by Mongol fleets provided plenty of examples of individual heroism.
However, the event is remembered more vividly because of the phenomenon of
the kamikaze, the divine wind that the kami blew up to defend the Japanese
nation. This, the climactic myth of the age of heroes, found expression during
World War II as young Japanese men sacrificed themselves in a vain attempt to
stop a modern invasion. The myth of the modern kamikaze relates modern
Japan directly to its mythical past. It lives on, in a sense, in the new Yasukan,
the memorial hall to Japan’s fallen soldiers at the Yasukuni shrine in Kudan
shita, Tokyo. And while many individual Japanese credit neither the medieval
kamikaze nor the modern ones as a divine event, the power of the myth is evi
dent in the numbers of modern visitors and the economics of building and main
taining the hall.
BUDDHIST MYTHS
Buddhist myths are substantially different from those of Shintπ origin. Virtually
all of the Buddhist-related myths have to do with the establishment of the Bud
dhist Law in one way or another. They are also, with the exception of myths
regarding Shakyamuni, rarely sequential. They can be divided into two rather
broad categories. The first contains the myths of Indian and Chinese origin that
deal with the establishment of Buddhism. They do not refer directly (or even indi
rectly, by and large) to Japan. Though retold in Japan, they are in effect Buddhist
myths from which the Japanese have made a selection to bolster the choice of par
ticular Buddhist venerated figures: Buddhas and boddhisattvas, gods and sages.
The second broad category contains myths associated either with specific
Japanese Buddhist sages, such as Kπbπ Daishi, or local stories—of miracles,
piety, ghosts, and demons—that have been elaborated into Buddhist morality
tales.
98 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The Life of Shakyamuni and the Formation of Buddhism
The details of Shakyamuni’s life—his conception, birth, upbringing, and notably
his life as religious teacher—have been central to much Buddhist literature.
Many of these tales have been transported to Japan. Significantly, some of the
myths have provided mythological foundations for figures in the mix of Shintπ
and Buddhism that prevailed in Japan until the Meiji era (late nineteenth cen
tury). For example, dakini, a class of female anthropophagous demons in Hindu
mythology, has been translated into the myth of the goddess Dakini in Japan,
who because she flies on a white fox has been associated with Inari as the honji
(Buddhist aspect of a Shintπ deity).
The thrust of the Shakyamuni myths in Japan has been the ability of the
Law, and of the Buddha to bend evil, in the form of demons, to his will. This is
accomplished not by violence but by persuasion. Significantly, in Japanese myth,
there are few evil beings. Mischievous, disobedient, and fractious, yes; but the
concept of evil (in the Christian sense) does not emerge coherently in the
mythology.
There are also a number of myths, such as the retrieval of the Law by Ry∆go
(Nagarjuna, a major figure in early Buddhism) from an iron tower in Southern
India, which connect the life of Shakyamuni with the establishment of Bud
dhism in Japan: Ry∆go, for example, is seen as the sage-founder of the Mahayana
form of Buddhism, which is the forerunner of all Japanese Buddhist sects.
The Arrival of Buddhism in Japan
The second thrust of Buddhist myths in Japan concerns myths associated with
the establishment of Buddhism in Japan. Since Buddhism arrived from so many
sources, there have been a great number of such myths as well. These myths
mostly tell of how, through struggle and perseverance and the timely interven
tion of one or another of the Buddhist gods, the Law arrived in Japan, sometimes
in the form of a blazing jewel, or of a scroll of writings. Intermediate stages exist
as well, as for instance the hugely popular series of myths that deal with the foun
dation of Zen in China by Daruma. No myth links Daruma directly with Japan,
and yet the figure has been immensely popular in art and folk representation.
A second popular figure is that of Kπbπ Daishi. Perhaps his personal popu
larity (the sect he founded in Japan, Shingon, has always appealed more to the
aristocracy) is due to the fact that he was uninvolved, until fairly late in life,
with the court in Heian-kyπ. As a consequence, he is very much seen as a popu
lar figure by commoners. The eighty-eight-stage pilgrimage that he founded in
Mythic Time and Space 99



Shikoku and the worship of Konpira that he established are still very much alive
in people’s consciousness. Many people still do the famous pilgrimage route, but
large portions are by bus and train, which sort of spoils much of the earlier
magic. Much of the pilgrimage route is now covered in concrete and asphalt, vic
tim of Japan’s continued urbanization. Other myths, about founders such as En
no-Gyπja, or even about monks and abbots, followers of the Buddha, and so on,
also fit into this category, though they may have no “historical” progression.
Morality Tales
The final set of myths derived from Buddhism are more in the nature of moral
ity tales or homilies. Collections of these tales, which demonstrated the virtues
of adhering to Buddhist precepts, were published frequently from the Kamakura
period onward. Some of them have become extremely famous: One example is
the legend of Dojπji, in which a young woman smitten by a handsome priest
tries to seduce him, and when the love affair fails, as inevitably it would, she is
transformed into a ravening dragon (this has become a staple of Kabuki drama).
Unlike the Shintπ myths, the Buddhist myths tend to be either highly per
sonalized or punctuated, rather than chronological. Myths about the Buddha
Shakyamuni are the most coherent, as are myths about individuals in Japanese
history. The morality tales seem to be embedded in Japanese history (there is
often a specific historical referent, for example, “In the days of Emperor
Kimmu . . .”), but certainly upon examination, the historical referent is rarely
significant for the myth, and it may well have been some later addition intended
to provide veracity and authenticity.
MYTHICAL SPACES
Like members of many other cultures, Japanese define themselves in terms of a
conceptual, or mythical, time and space. The structure of these concepts in
Japanese thinking is complicated by two issues. First is one we have already dis
cussed: the varied sources—native Japanese, Chinese and Indian imports, and
Western science—from which they are drawn.
The second is, paradoxically, the nature of Japanese language and writing,
which allows and encourages puns, plays on words, and “deliberate” warping of
meaning by jumping from one mode of communication, for example common
speech, to another mode, writing kanji, to make a pun or elicit a meaning. The
intention of word play and puns is not all facetious or humorous. It helps people
100 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



embed their experience in some common ground, to share experiences and non
material ideas, and it creates a shared set of concepts, unique to those who share
the same language.
The creation of mythical times and spaces in Japanese myth is therefore the
intersection of a number of factors, not all of them mythical in nature. Land
scape features, antique and forgotten rituals and practices, political events, and
human attempts to organize their experiences in a meaningful way create the
mythical reality.
Perhaps the most significant issue regarding mythical space, which is true to
all of the myths and myth complexes discussed here, is the relationship between
the cosmos and the deities. In Buddhism and Shintπ (unlike the Judeo-Christian
system), the deities are part of the world. Even though they have a great deal of
power and freedom to act as they will, even when they are, as in Jπdπ Shinsh∆ and
Nichiren-sh∆, monotheistic deities, they are still limited by the cosmic rules that
surround them. They cannot, on a whim or for any reason, change the basic cos
mological rules that are fundamental to the universe. The effect of works, good
or ill, on human destiny, and the nature of human beings are things with which
the deity, no matter how compassionate or interested in salvation, must work.
Buddhist Spaces
The spaces of Buddhist cosmology are at one and the same time symbolic repre
sentations of the moral and theological themes that Buddhism preaches (largely
for the adept, the priest, and the religious expert) and very real parts of the cos
mos that one might, and possibly will, visit at some time (for the main body of
believers). In rough terms, the cosmos can contain within itself any number of
universes, all proceeding from past to future. At the same time, the universe is
divided into several realms. What connects these realms is the symbolic/topo
graphical feature called Mt. Meru (Sumeru in Sanskrit).
Called Sumi in Japanese, Mt. Meru is the mythical and physical representa
tion of the universe in Buddhist thought. The roots of this mountain lie in hell,
where the souls of those who have done evil in their life suffer torment until
they expiate their sins or acknowledge the mercy of Buddha (depending on Bud
dhist sect). On its flanks toil those who are on the path, the way to achieve Bud
dhahood. The upper slopes contain the domains of the various Buddhist deities,
with their armies, attendants, subordinates, and servants: a giant host of hosts.
At the peak are the paradises of the various directions (two, that of the West and
that of the East, feature heavily in Japanese cosmology), and at the peak is the
Realm of Formlessness, where those who have attained nirvana can be found.
Mythic Time and Space 101



Hell is a contradictory concept in Buddhism. Punishment for sins in life
should, in theory, occur in the process of rebirth. Nonetheless, Jigoku has a very
real mythical existence. Like Dante’s version, there is a hell to fit every crime.
Monsters and oni (demons), many borrowed from Indian or Chinese cosmology,
torment the denizens with fire, ice, and instruments of torture. The number and
kind of loggia, to follow Dante’s terminology, depend, once again, on which Bud
dhist sect is doing the defining. The one common major feature of hell is the dry
riverbed that runs through, or beside, it. In this foggy plain are the souls of inno
cents such as aborted children, who have noone to assist them in their climb to
better realms. Before hell also flows Shozukawa, the hell river, which only the
souls of the dead, stripped of their possessions by the Shozuka-no-baba (the hell
hag), can pass.
The universe of the living is effectively limitless. Japanese Buddhist cos
mology recognizes that though Japan is the most important of all locations, there
are myriad worlds without end encompassed within the universe.
The myriad realms of the deities lie above, arrayed in a variety of locations
and systems. Supreme over all these, and responsible for the defense of Mt. Meru
(that is, of the entire Buddhist Law that Meru represents), are the four Tenno.
Each marshals his own particular gifts; for example, Bishamon, guardian of the
North, is also the guardian of earthly treasure. Each also marshals his own host
of followers and soldiers who defend that particular direction.
Above these, toward the ultimate peak, are the paradises of the various Bud
dhas, the peak itself being occupied by ___ Buddha (fill in the blank according to
your sect).
The schematic described here is just that: a schematic. Its details vary con
siderably, and none of it appears as a full description in any myth. Rather it is an
abstract drawn from the many viewpoints that express the entity called Bud
dhism. Certainly the motif of the mountain is very powerful in Buddhist
thought. In Japan it has been reinforced by the native predilection for mountains
and mountain deities, and may well have been one of the reasons Buddhism
found such easy acceptance in Japan.
Shinto ̄ Spaces
Shintπ cosmology and topography are far simpler than Buddhism’s. The defini
tion of the various realms of the cosmos is also far more clearly delineated, with
actual geographical features framing much of the mythical topography.
The realm of the heavenly kami, Takamagahara (Plain of Heaven), overar
ches the realm of the earth. Within heaven lie the halls of the various gods,
102 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



though we have a description of only one: that of Amaterasu-π-mikami. It has
specialized halls for the usual domestic tasks—weaving is mentioned—as well
as paddy fields and dikes. Running through heaven is a riverbed. The river itself
has been dammed upstream so that the kami have a wide assembly place (nec
essary in a system that rules by consensus, as the Japanese still do, and where
the participants number eight million). The river runs from a range of high
mountains. Heaven is bounded on its earthly side by a shallow stream: This is
where Amaterasu confronts her wayward brother.
Two significant features in heaven are its exits. There is the Heavenly Float
ing Bridge, often identified with the Milky Way, which joins heaven to earth,
and from which the earth was created. There is also a major crossroads, of which
one road leads to heaven, the other to earth: This is where Sarutahiko awaited
the descent of the heavenly grandson.
The earth is composed of several parts. The first is the sea, which appears
boundless. It preceded the land, which was drawn from it “like the shoot of a
reed.” The land itself is composed of islands, some formed originally from the
drops that coalesced on the tip of Izanagi’s jeweled spear, others born of the
intercourse between Izanagi and his mate, Izanami. The main component of
these islands are the ones that make up the Japanese archipelago. The topogra
phy here is that familiar to us from modern Japan, though the names have
changed and many places are identified very doubtfully. Certainly the plains and
mountains of Yamato (in the modern Kansai area); the Yoshino mountains on
the Kii peninsula (southeast of Yamato); Lake Biwa, which borders Yamato to
the east; Izumo to the northwest; and the Seto Sea and island of Kyushu to the
south are all identified and play a part in the myths. The Korean Peninsula fea
tures as well, especially two of the three major Korean polities of the time, Silla
and Paekche.
The domain of the sea god, variously Owatatsumi-no-kami or Ry∆jin, is like
the earth except that the denizens are fish rather than humans. In former times,
until Ho-ori’s disagreement with his wife, the domains of the sea and the land
were one expanse. Now they are separate parts of the earth. Other parts of the
earth are reachable through caves or fissures in the earth’s crust. Perhaps the
most important is an undefined realm across the sea. This is the homeland of
such marebito (visiting deities) as Sukunabikona, the magician dwarf god who
helps ∏kuninushi complete the construction of the land started by Izanagi.
There is some reason to suggest, argues Ouwehand, that this land, sometimes
identified (following a Chinese legend) as the Isles of the Blessed, is in reality the
final realm of myth: the Land of Yπmi.
The Land of Yπmi exists underground. It is a damp and dark place, devoid of
light and color. We have no clear topography of the place. The dead, judging by
Mythic Time and Space 103



the description in the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki, exist in halls as they do in life.
Their torment, if such there is, consists of being separated from their former
lives and particularly from their loved ones and friends. No other torments are
in evidence, nor is the land of Yπmi a place of punishment. Yπmi is merely a
place of utter pollution from which no one returns.

DEITIES, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
AE-OINA KAMUI (AINU)
A “teacher” kamui and culture hero who taught humans the domestic arts.
Armed with a magical and irresistible spear of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris, a
bitter aromatic herb), Ae-oina Kamui fought many battles on behalf of
humankind. Instructed by Kamui Fuchi, the kamui of the hearth, he taught
weaving and other domestic tasks to Ainu women. He is depicted as wreathed
in mist or smoke. When this parts briefly, he is seen to be skirted by flames from
his feet to his belt, wearing a coat of elm-bark fiber, its hem aflame, and a girt
with a flame-tipped sword-sheath. The flames indicate his strongly virtuous
character and his association with Kamui Fuchi.
There are a number of myths of his origin, due most probably to regional dif
ferences among Ainu tribes: Some say he was born of the elm tree, or fathered
by the sun or by thunder, or even by Pakoro Kamui, the deity of pestilence and
smallpox.
In the myths of some Ainu areas, Ae-oina Kamui is identified with
Okikurmi, the culture hero and magician. He/they are often referred to as Ain
urakkur, meaning the father of the Ainu. He is at the same time a savior and a
dangerous kamui. In one myth, he kills a magical giant char with his spear of
mugwort, saving humanity from famine. In another myth he fights a famine
crone, who has built fish traps to block the salmon from the people. He breaks
all her fish traps, then releases herds of deer and schools of fish from the snow
on his snowshoes. And another myth recounts how he forces the sister of the
owl deity, Chikap Kamui, to marry him after defeating Chikap Kamui in battle.
Ae-oina Kamui/Okikurmi is credited with teaching humans the important
basics of being Ainu (i.e., human). Philippi summarizes these teachings as (1) rit
ual activities appropriate for men and for women; (2) handicraft techniques spe
cific to men (carving) and women (needlework); (3) fishing, hunting, and
gathering techniques; (4) architecture; (5) medicine; (6) dispute settlement (that
is, law); and (7) entertainment and singing.
Ae-oina Kamui finally returned to heaven, or, in some epics, left for another
109



country, in disgust at the depraved ways of the Ainu. With his departure started
the long decline of the Ainu. Thus the Ainu equate their subjugation by the
Japanese in terms of the departure of their culture hero.

AIZEN-MY  ̄O-  ̄O
Deity of love and sex, worshiped by prostitutes, landlords, singers, and musi
cians. One of the Myπ-π (heavenly kings). Despite his ferocious appearance he is
considered to be beneficial to humankind. Originally he was a deity of the Shin
gon and Tendai esoteric schools and represented love and desire for enlighten
ment and union with the Buddha. With time, desire was interpreted as carnal
desire as well, and Aizen became patron of the “Floating World”: the evanescent
world of the entertainer and prostitute, which, though decried incessantly in
Buddhist thought and literature, was deeply embedded into actual life.
Aizen is portrayed as having a red body and face, and six hands. These hold a
bell, a five-pointed kongπ (a double-ended weapon representing diamond and thun
derbolt; see Weapons), an arrow, a bow, and a lotus bud. He has three eyes, one set
vertically in the middle of his forehead, and his erect hair is topped by a shishi (q.v.),
lion’s head. His expression is ferocious and angry. He represents passions con
quered, and subjugation of oneself, and one’s external enemies through self-control.
During the second Mongol attack on Japan (1281) Aizen Myπ-π was invoked.
He shot an arrow from his bow, which precipitated a tempest—the kamikaze
which sank the Mongol fleet.
In addition to being the patron of entertainers, Aizen is also worshipped as
patron of dyers and cloth sellers. The reason is a play on words between Aizen
and aizome (dyeing with indigo). He is worshiped as such in the Nichiπ-ji tem
ple in Tokyo.

AJISHIKITAKAHIKONE-NO-KAMI
One of the many thunder deities. The son of ∏kuninushi, he is the tutelary deity
of Kamo province. He was a friend of Ame-no-wakahiko, who had been dispatched
110 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



by the heavenly deities to subdue the land. After Ame-no-wakahiko had been
killed for rebelling against the heavenly kami’s orders, Ajishikitakahikone-no
kami arrived at the obsequies, but was mistaken by the dead deity’s parents for
their son. Ajishikitakahikone, enraged at being confused with a polluting corpse,
drew his sword and destroyed the funerary house, then left in high dudgeon.
He is often portrayed as a baby (no doubt due to his outburst at the funeral)
who, unable to sleep, is carried by his mother up and down a ladder in order to
lull him to sleep. The sound of growing thunder is the result of his being pulled
up and down the ladder. The same myth is told, of course, of the other thunder
deities as well.

AMA-NO-UZUME
The kami who enticed Amaterasu-π-mikami from her cave by dancing a lewd
dance. Ama-no-uzume is one of the most active deities in Shintπ mythology.
One of the most aggressive, powerful, and crafty of the deities, she features in
many of the world foundation myths.
When the sun goddess, incensed by the behavior of her brother, hid herself
in a cave, it was Ama-no-uzume-no-mikoto who enticed her out. She bound up
her sleeves and hair with sacred vines and carried a fan of sasa leaves (a grass
similar to bamboo). Overturning a bucket, she stamped and danced upon it, then
becoming possessed, she danced a lewd dance, exposing her breasts and genitals,
causing the audience of worried kami to laugh out loud, thus enticing the solar
deity from her hiding place.
When Ninigi-no-mikoto was ready to descend from the Plain of Heaven to
the Central Land of the Reed Plains, his way was blocked at the Eightfold Cross
roads by Sarutahiko-no-kami, an earth kami. Ama-no-uzume—considered a
woman of great character and force—was dispatched by Amaterasu-π-mikami
and Takamimusubi-no-kami to demand explanations and subdue him as neces
sary, which she promptly did. As a consequence, she became one of Ninigi’s
advisers and companions in the descent to the land. As she had been the first to
recognize Sarutahiko, Ninigi-no-mikoto commanded her to accompany Saru
tahiko home when the latter’s work as guide to the Central Land of the Reed
Plains was done. Subsequently she became the ancestress of an important impe
rial clan and assumed the name of her protégé, Sarutahiko. It is possible, and
some people hold, that they became man and wife. The accounts of her are a tes
timony to her determination and ruthlessness: Incensed by the sea cucumber’s
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 111



refusal to support the heavenly grandson, she promptly slit its mouth with her
dagger, so that it is silent to this day.
She is sometimes worshiped as patroness of performers and dancers. She
also appears as Otafuku or Okame: a full-cheeked, plump peasant woman laugh
ing happily, whose name Otafuku means “large breasts.” As such she is consid
ered by some to be the kami of mirth, and she is accompanied by her husband,
the peasant Hyottoko, who is identified with Sarutahiko. Both of these deities
are addressed fervently during the November festival of Tori-no-ichi (Cock mar
ket), when merchants buy pictures or masks of the pair, together with wide bam
boo rakes “to rake in fortune.”

AMATERASU-  ̄O-MIKAMI
Sun deity ancestress of Japan’s imperial house and dominant heavenly kami of
Japan. Amaterasu is the penultimate child of Izanagi and Izanami of the second,
successful mating of the two founder deities. Having been born and assuming her
place, she was offered an extreme insult by her brother, the wayward deity
Susano-wo. After a suspicious meeting when he came to take leave of her (he was
to rule over the underworld), she indulgently allowed him to live in the Realm of
the Heavenly Deities. He reciprocated by polluting her fields with abominable
acts, then throwing the flayed carcass of a horse onto her palace while she and her
attendants were weaving. As a consequence, Amaterasu-π-mikami withdrew into
a cave, taking the light of the sun with her and rolling a great rock before the
entrance. The deities, after assembling, managed to lure her from her cave. This
was accomplished by Ama-no-uzume, who, dancing lasciviously, made the gods
laugh. Intrigued by the levity, Amaterasu, peering from the cave, was entranced
by the jewels the kami had hung in a tree. She asked why all the hilarity and was
told that there was another deity in heaven fairer than she. She was then shown
a mirror, which reflected her own face. As she peered into the mirror, Amano
tachikara-π-no-kami, the strongman deity of heaven, pulled her from the cave. As
a consequence, the mirror and jewels became part of her regalia.
Her grandson, Ninigi-no-mikoto, was ordered to descend and take posses
sion of the Central Land of the Reed Plains, which he accomplished at her
instructions after receiving a sword from her hands. She assisted him in the con
quest of the Central Land of the Reed Plains by sending allies and assistants.
112 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Amaterasu is the primus-inter-pares of the Shintπ pantheon. It is particu
larly remarkable that she is neither male nor the first born of her parents. This is
notable coming from a society in which women’s positions have been secondary,
and in which primogeniture is a feature. The discrepancy may be accounted for
by the fact that the ancient Japanese, before the infiltration of Chinese ideas
(aggressively male and hierarchical) allotted positions of religio-political power to
women. Many of the myths in the Nihonshπki and the Kπjiki indicate that
women occupied a prominent position in ancient Japanese thinking. On the
other hand, there is also indication, both from the two mythological records and
from other sources, that rulership was often dual: a younger and an older brother,
or, as is the case in the Yamato myth, a female shamaness and a male ruler. The
latter was ritually subordinate and his prestige was lower, but probably had a
great deal of political power, as is the case of Amaterasu’s male counterpart,
Takamimusubi-no-kami. However, she is by no means a passive female deity.
When Susano-wo ascended to heaven, she, apparently concerned about his
motives, not only armed and armored herself but actually performed shiki, the
earth-pounding ritual performed by archaic warriors before battle (and still per
formed today by sumo wrestlers before a match). Her strength (or perhaps her
determination, far more important in the Japanese scheme of things) is attested
to by the fact that her legs sank into the earth to her knees at each stamp.
Under the honji-suijaku theory, Amaterasu was considered an avatar of
Dainichi Nyπrai, Buddha of the sun. For Nichiren she represented the true Japan
ese aspect of the solar Buddha.
Amaterasu-π-mikami’s main shrine is at Ise. It is rebuilt every twenty years
of plain wood from a nearby sacred grove. Branch shrines are found throughout
Japan. She is considered the ancestress of the imperial house, and thus by exten
sion of the Japanese people, whose houses constitute cadet houses to the
emperor’s.

AMENOMINAKANUSHI-NO-KAMI
The first kami to come into existence out of nothing. He is considered by some
to be the original kami of heaven and earth, though this is a matter of interpre
tation. Immediately upon his appearance, and after doing what he had come to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 113



do, he (one assumes it was a male) became a “hidden” kami, that is, one who
does not take a part in subsequent affairs.

AME-NO-UZUME
See Ama-no-uzume.
AME-NO-WAKAHIKO
The second of the deities dispatched by the heavenly deities to subdue the Cen
tral Land of the Reed Plains. He was armed with the heavenly deer-slaying bow
and the heavenly arrows. He descended to the land and took as his wife Shi
tateru-hime, ∏kuninushi’s daughter. He plotted to gain control of the land for
himself and resided there for eight years.
The senior deities, Amaterasu-π-mikami and Takamimusubi-no-kami, con
vened all the deities and sent the pheasant to inquire why Ame-no-wakahiko
had not returned. Advised by a wise woman who heard the pheasant’s queries,
he shot the bird with one of his heavenly arrows. It rebounded from the pheas
ant’s body up to heaven, coming to rest by Amaterasu and Takamimusubi. After
showing the arrow to the rest of the heavenly deities, Takamimusubi bespelled
the weapon to kill Ame-no-wakahiko if his arrow had been shot with evil intent;
otherwise it would do no harm. He then thrust it down the way it had come.
Ame-no-wakahiko was killed instantly as the arrow pierced his breast.
The myth gives rise to a traditional Japanese saying about the returning
arrow, implying something similar to “Evil to him whom evil thinks.” The
myth is partly an elaboration on the common human motif of “third time
lucky,” with Ame-no-wakahiko being the unsuccessful second try. At the same
time, it is probably also a mythicization of the various attempts made by the
Yamato state to impose its rule over the neighboring nation states.

114 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



AMIDA NY  ̄ORAI
The merciful Buddha of the Pure Land. The conceptualizations of Amida have
always been very vague in Japanese myth. Like many other Buddhas and bod
hisattvas, Amida appears in myths, if at all, as influencing the protagonist or as
a figure of appeal, but never as an active protagonist himself. Nonetheless, the
presence of Amida is a very powerful one in Japanese myth, and a great many
other religious figures appear either as his avatar or representing him in one way
or another.
Amida is portrayed as a seated, contemplative Buddha. He is often shown
accompanied by the boddhisattvas Kannon and Seishi-bosatsu. The origins of
Amida may well be found in the figure of Ahura Mazda, the Persian-Zoroastrian
god of light. Certainly Joly, at least, argues that the great similarities in both
characteristics and ritual addresses to Amida make it all but certain that this fig
ure represents a transfer into Buddhism of elements of Zoroastrian worship. One
thing that lends supposition to this idea is that Amida has no existence in any
of the original Buddhist sutras. The belief in Amida is a product of the expansion
of the Chinese empire under the T’ang, when contact was established on a reg
ular basis with Persia and its ideas.
Though Amida is a background figure in Japanese mythology, he is of pri
mary importance in Japanese religion. A major figure in esoteric Buddhism,
belief in Amida was promulgated by Hπnen, who sought an “easier path” to sal
vation than that advocated by earlier Buddhist schools. Because Amida is infi
nitely merciful, this requires little more than a repetition of the nembutsu
formula “Namu Amida Butsu” (Hail Buddha Amida). Amida is all-hearing, and
a repetition of this formula ensures the repeater entrance into Jπdπ, the Pure
Land of paradise. The Buddha Amida is venerated as the main deity of the Jπdπ
and Jπdπ-Shinshu sects. His main characteristics are love and benevolence. Thus
the way to salvation is dependent simply upon repeating the nembutsu (in Jπdπ),
or by absolute belief and trust in the deity (Jπdπ-Shinshu).

ANIMALS
As in most traditional societies, animals play a part in many myths. Some of
these myths are of the explanatory type, others have to do with aid to deities and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 115



heroes, and still others are somewhat more puzzling. Certain animals have
been traditionally associated with particular deities, which may or may not be
evidence of totemism (the association of humans with animal ancestors) in
archaic Japan. Doves are traditionally associated with Hachiman, the war
deity. Inari’s messenger and companion is a fox. The kunitsu kami (earth
deities) seemed especially able to present themselves in the shape of animals:
Yamato-takeru encountered two of them, and the second brought about his
death.
Three animals in particular attracted the Japanese imagination and are dealt
with separately: the rabbit or hare, the fox, and the badger. All of these animals,
(particularly the fox) were considered to be powerful and magical. The other ani
mals described in this section occur as monsters or as saviors or servants in var
ious myths. Some are purely mythical whereas others are based on second- or
third-hand reports that Japanese heard of animals in “foreign parts.” Some of
these animals are briefly described here.
Centipede
Centipedes were impure, polluted animals associated with the dead. Thus
Susano-wo, when he entertained his descendant ∏kuninushi when the
116 Handbook of Japanese Mythology
Group of tanuki figures wearing leaf hats and drumming on their distended bellies.
(C. Rennie/TRIP)



latter had married Susano-wo’s daughter, had centipedes in his hair instead of
lice.
A giant centipede was harassing the kingdom of Ryujin, the dragon king,
under Lake Biwa. The hero Tawara Toda was enlisted to aid the beleaguered
monarch. He shot three arrows at the giant monster, whose body length covered
a mountain, finally overcoming the beast with his last arrow.
Crocodile
Though not living in Japanese waters, crocodiles may have been known to the
early Japanese from Buddhist sources; from China, where they live in the
Yangtze River; or from reports of marine crocodiles. A row of crocodiles
allowed the rabbit of Inaba to leave its island in the myth of ∏kuninushi and
his eighty brothers. Another crocodile, chosen from an assembly of the beasts,
helped Ho-ori-no-kami return to confront his brother during the dispute over
the lost fishhook.
Crow
Crows were generally birds of good omen. The giant eight-lengths crow Yata
garasu was sent by the heavenly deities to guide the future first emperor Jimmu
Tenno, on his way from Kumano to Yamato. In another form, some tengu have
the form of crows.
The Ainu recognized two types of crow. One was despised, and the subject
of myths that showed how stupid and bad tempered he was; the other was
respected and considered a good omen. In the early days, the sun was threatened
by a monster, which swallowed it. The earth became dark, and there was no
warmth. Pashkuru Kamui, the crow, flew at the monster and pecked ferociously
at its tongue. In panic, the monster regurgitated its prey, bringing back the light
and warmth. On another occasion, when the first Ainu were starving, the crow
guided them to a stranded whale, whose flesh saved the humans. As a result, the
crow is honored as a friend of humankind.
Elephant
In Japanese iconography the elephant is a tusked, fanged, mythical beast. It
appears in both Buddhist and Shintπ iconography.
In Buddhism, the elephant represents the historical Buddha. Some of the
Japanese ideas derive from Buddhist jataka tales (which tell of the Buddha’s life
and activities, sometimes in fabulous detail). Fugen-bosatsu, a major boddhisattva,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 117



rides a white elephant with blazing red eyes or face and six tusks that represents
the reincarnation of Shakyamuni before he became the Buddha. Fugen appears to
those who meditate upon the sutras.
The Japanese had not seen elephants until the sixteenth century, so repre
sentations of elephants tend to be elaborated by the fancy of the artist. In
Shintπ, the elephant is portrayed, along with other fabulous beasts such as
leopards and dragons, on the beams of Shintπ shrines. The association may
derive from the makatsugyπ, an Indian water monster, part elephant, part
crocodile, part dolphin, which also represented the river Ganges. Arriving in
Japan, the idea was translated into a clawed, tusked-and-fanged short-trunked
finial of roof and ceiling beams. Presumably because of its watery associations,
the elephant serves to protect wooden structures against fire and to bring about
the rain.
Kirin
A mythical animal, symbol of purity. Somewhat akin to the European unicorn,
the kirin only appears to those who are pure at heart. It is reputed to run across
the clouds. A creature of Chinese origin, the kirin features in art and iconogra
phy, much less in actual myth texts.
Pheasant
Nakime the pheasant was dispatched to inquire of the dilatory Ame-no
wakahiko why he had not returned to Takamagahara to report on his doings in
the Central Land of the Reed Plains.
Rabbit
A sly, clever creature not unlike B’rer Rabbit of the United States. The rabbit
of Inaba tricked the sea crocodiles into lining up between the island of Oki and
Cape K§ta, where he wanted to go, by promising to count the size of the croc
odile family. Skipping over their backs, he could not resist gloating at his clev
erness and was seized by the last in line, getting away only after being skinned.
Grateful for ∏kuninushi’s healing advice, he prophesied that ∏kuninushi
would successfully wed the princess ∏kuninushi and his brothers were com
peting for.
118 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Sea Cucumber
A type of echinoderm (a soft, spiny sea creature) that is popular as a snack with
liquor, the sea cucumber was the only one of the fish that, by its silence, refused
to serve the offspring of the heavenly deities (i.e., Ninigi-no-mikoto). As a con
sequence, Ama-no-uzume, one of Ninigi’s companions, slit its mouth with a
dagger, giving it its current shape and causing it to lose its voice.
Shishi
A mythical “lion” of Chinese tradition, imported into Japan. They have large
bulging eyes, curly bushy tails, and a playful temperament. Monju-bosatsu rides
a shishi. Shishi are generally impervious to magic, and Japanese legend has it
that though very protective of their cubs, shishi throw each cub over a cliff to
test its vitality and toughness. The most significant feature of the shishi is their
protective nature, and they are thus invoked as playful and nonthreatening pro
tectors of children.
Spider
Spiders occur in a number of myths, notably in the tale of Raikπ. The
Tsuchigumo harassed Yamato in the time of Jimmu Tenno and was vanquished
by smoking the spider in its den. Several other myths tell of maleficent, often
giant spiders that needed to be vanquished by heroes.
Tanuki
Usually translated as “badger,” this is an animal—Nyctereutes procyonides
related to the raccoon. It is reputed to be sly and mischievous, with magical pow
ers. It is depicted with a pot belly and enlarged scrotum, on either of which it
might play as on a drum. Tanuki sometimes disguises himself as an itinerant
monk and begs at the wayside or steals the belongings of passers-by. In one
famous story, the tanuki disguised itself as a kettle, only to be filled with water
and boiled, leading to a desperate escape.
Toad
A magical animal mentioned in both Nihonshπki and Kπjiki in the Sukun
abikona myth. The toad, according to ancient belief, was considered a great
traveler and had been everywhere. The toad is either an accomplice or a mes
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 119



senger of Kuyebiko, the scarecrow deity, who knows everything. Gama-sennin,
the toad sage, carries a three-legged toad with him, though perhaps not the
same as the scarecrow’s. The animal’s warty skin and apparent immunity to
most predators, as well as its apparent longevity, made it an element in the
Daoist pharmacopoeia of longevity, an idea that apparently entered Japanese
culture as well.
Turtle
The minogame (mythical turtle) is usually represented as having a luxuriant
bushy tail. It is one of the animals of the four directions (tiger, dragon, phoenix,
and turtle) imported from China. It is reputed to live a thousand years. It is thus
emblematic of longevity.
Zodiacal Animals (J ̄unishi)
Like many other mythological and religious phenomena, Japanese mythology
has imported the idea of the zodiac from a Chinese origin. Each zodaical ani
mal is associated with a particular year, as well as month. The idea of yaku
doshi (momentous years) is still very prevalent in Japan and has social
implications that are quite significant. The twelve zodaical animals are com
bined with the cycle of five elements (fire, water, earth, metal, air) to produce
a sixty-year cycle. A well-known example of the effects of yakudoshi is that
of girl children born in the year of horse-fire. Believed to be destined to
become widows, few men will marry them. As a consequence, the Japanese
birthrate in those years is far lower than in previous or subsequent years, as
many couples avoid having a child for fear the baby would be a girl, and thus
unmarriageable.

APASAM KAMUI (AINU)
The spirit of the threshold. An important Ainu kamui, Apasam Kamui is the
protector of the passage from the wild outside to the tame inside of Ainu culture.
Though Apasam is not considered one of the “major” deities of the Ainu pan
theon (that is, unlike Kamui Fuchi, Apasam Kamui is not honored or called on
120 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



at many rituals), Apasam is nonetheless the kamui called upon whenever
changes of state are occurring. The most important, perhaps, is requests for
Apasam to protect women during difficult labor, and to protect people from such
angry kamui as the dreaded smallpox kamui, Pakoro Kamui. Apasam is often
conceived of as a dual kamui, either a male and female couple or a dual entity,
perhaps similar in concept to the Roman Janus.
For the Ainu, living as they did in close contact with nature, the delineation
of boundaries was crucial both materially and intellectually. Each settlement of
Ainu controlled a kotan, a domain from which they drew their living and that
they were able and willing to defend. Yet the very nature of the society
demanded that they cross the boundaries between one ramat and another, as the
salmon and the deer and bears moved about. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they
needed a figure that could oversee these passages and enable them to be carried
out fearlessly and without trouble. The same was true of their households; the
difference they saw between themselves as civilized beings, and their neigh
bors—the Japanese and the Okhotskians—who they viewed as uncivilized, had
a lot to do with their pursuits within the house (carving, weaving, wine-making)
and the contrast with the wild outside where such cultured activities were not
pursued. Apasam Kamui exemplified all of these differences and the transitions
between them.

ASSEMBLY OF THE GODS
In many of Japan’s myths, the kami assemble together to debate or deal with
crises or with the normal management of their affairs. Thus one assembly was
called to deal with the events surrounding Amaterasu-π-mikami’s retirement
into the cave after Susano-wo’s outrages. Other assemblies were called to deal
with the matters surrounding the subjugation of the Central Land of the Reed
Plains. The assemblies recorded in the Kπjiki note that these take place in the
dry riverbed of the Heavenly River. In Heian and later Japan, dry riverbeds were
usually the major open spaces available for city dwellers to meet, have fairs, and
performances of dance and sarugaku (the predecessor to classical Nπh theater).
Thus it was fitting that the kami would have assembled in a similar manner,
particularly considering that there were eight million of them. Most of the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 121



recorded assemblies were convened by Takamimusubi-no-kami and Amaterasu
π-mikami.
The kami also assemble annually at Izumo on the tenth month, to discuss
what has happened across the land as well as the behavior of its denizens. The
one exception to the gathering is Ebisu, who is deaf to the summons. During this
month, prayers to the deities and most festivals are suspended, the exception
being the festival for the kami of war, Hachiman.
The idea that important decisions should be reached by consultation and
consensus is a cornerstone of Japanese sociopolitical thinking. Even today, well
managed Japanese companies take care to consult even the most junior employ
ees affected by a policy decision. Though often obeyed more in form than in
substance, the idea is nonetheless an important concept in Japanese culture. The
idea that the kami, responsible for celestial management, would settle their
affairs in what amounts to a public meeting does not strike the Japanese as out
of the ordinary, but rather as good managerial practice.

ATAGO-GONGEN
The guardian deity of Mt. Atago, north of Kyoto, protective deity of fire and of
protection from conflagration. Like many gongen, Atago-gongen is largely a
Shugendπ deity. Mt. Atago, which guards the northwest approaches to the impe
rial capital of Heian-kyπ (now Kyoto), was the haunt of tengu (goblins), particu
larly a very powerful one named Tarπbπ. During the reign of Emperor Monmu
(701–704), the sages En-no-Gyπja, founder of the Shugendπ syncretic sect, and
Taichπ, founder of the Hakusan Shugendπ monastery, were ordered to clear the
mountain of the goblins. Tarπbπ surrendered to the two sages and promised to
become the protector of the mountain and to mount a vigil against fire. As a con
sequence, he is often viewed as the guardian of Jizπ, or an avatar of this bod
dhisattva, who is appealed to for protection for children against being burned by
the hearth.
Atago-gongen, mounted on a horse and carrying the symbols usually carried
by Jizπ (the ringed staff and the desire-canceling jewel), is titled Shogun Jizπ. On
his white horse he flanks Kannon on one side, mirrored on the other by Bisha

mon. During the Heian period, when the famous general Tamuramaro subdued
the Ezo (the Ainu) in northern Japan, he dreamed that his patron, Kannon,
appeared to him promising her aid and that of her generals, Bishamon and Jizπ.
As a consequence Jizπ, in his form as Atago-gongen, still overlooks and protects
the ancient capital.

BATTABARA-BOSATSU
The tutelary venerable of the bath in Zen monasteries. Battabara was an Indian
monk who attained enlightenment in the bath. He was entering the bath with
seven other monks when he suddenly, being between pure and impure (one foot
in the water, one outside), experienced enlightenment. Battabara thus became
the patron of bathing, and his figure (or a board with his name), usually carry
ing the stick used to stir the warm water, is kept in every bathroom in Zen
monasteries.
The myth of Battabara illustrates two concerns of the Zen school. First,
enlightenment can come to any individual at any time. Second, bathing is intrin
sic to the Japanese lifestyle, and to religion in general, because it indicates the
ability to free oneself from pollution (and thus, in Zen thinking, from the illu
sions of this world). Like all bosatsu, Battabara can lead the individual to
enlightenment in this life.

BENKEI
Monk-soldier during the period of the Gempei war (1180–1185) and devoted
companion of Ushiwakamaru/Yoshitsune. Benkei was born to the daughter of a
blacksmith near Shing∆. His mother ate iron and may have been a descendant of
Dπjπ-hπshi. His father was either a yamabushi or a priest, or perhaps the thun
der deity. Benkei’s mother was pregnant in a miraculous manner for three years
and three months. He was born with a full head of hair that reached his knees
and a full set of teeth.
In his grandfather’s smithy he hammered the anvil into the ground and col
lected firewood by the treeload. In his youth he was called Oniwaka (Young
demon) for his pranks and ferocity. On one occasion when challenged, he held
aloft a large rock to crush his challenger: The rock can still be seen today.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 123



Because of his wildness and perhaps his huge appetite, he was made a novice at
Enryakuji temple on Mt. Hiei (thus his familiar surname—Musashibπ, or “Priest
Musashi”), where he studied to be a yamabushi. Eventually he became a sπhei,
one of the monk-soldiers of the temple. Originally a position for less intelligent
and devout monks, the sπhei had become threats to order in the capital by the
eleventh century. Benkei was eight feet tall and had the strength of a hundred
men. Annoyed by the monks of Miidera (traditional rivals of Enryakuji) on the
shores of Lake Biwa east of Hiei and the capital, he carried away the massive bell
of Miidera temple and placed it at his own monastery on Mt. Hiei, overlooking
the capital from the northeast. When the bell refused to toll, only uttering “I want
to return to Miidera” when struck, the hero gave it a kick that rolled it down the
mountain and back to the gates of Miidera. His price for returning the bell (he
agreed to return it only after the intercession of his abbot) was a satisfactory meal.
His depredation emptied the temple’s larder and cellar. The cauldron from which
he ate can still be seen in Miidera today: He was not, apparently, a dainty eater,
and the marks of Benkei’s teeth are on the cauldron still.
As a sπhei he needed weapons and armor, and his way of equipping himself
was as eccentric as the rest of his life. For weapons he carried, in addition to his
sword, a quiver of tools: masakari (broad ax); kumade (rake), nagihama (sickle
124 Handbook of Japanese Mythology
Temple bell (Courtesy of the author)



weapon), hizuchi (wooden mallet), nokogiri (saw), tetsubπ (iron staff), and
sasumata (half-moon spear). These were the weapons of the common man, not
the bred warrior, and Benkei is often known as “Nanadogu Benkei” (Benkei of
the Seven Tools). He also ordered himself a special suit of armor to fit his gigan
tic frame. The armorer told him it would take one thousand swords to make the
suit, and these he vowed to collect. For this purpose he stationed himself at one
end of the Gπju Bridge in Kyoto, challenging all comers to surrender their swords
or fight. He was on the point of adding the last sword to the collection when he
challenged a young boy, Ushiwakamaru, and was promptly defeated. Benkei
then became the young man’s devoted retainer.
Benkei’s devotion to his master—whose full name became Minamoto-no
Yoshitsune—was extreme. He is epitomized as both a loyal retainer and as wild
genius tamed by craft. In the most famous episode attributed to him, he helped
his disguised master pass for a low-ranking monk by beating him at a barrier at
Ataka (in modern Ishikawa prefecture) guarded by men loyal to Minamoto-no
Yoritomo, Yoshitsune’s brother and nemesis. The conflict between the respect
for a lord and the need to humiliate the lord and save his life became an endur
ing theme in Japanese literature and art. One charming story attributed to him
has it that while writing a draft of a letter Yoshitsune wanted to send to his
brother, Benkei was disturbed by the sound of crickets. Furious, he shouted out
loud “Silence!” and since then, the environs of the Manpukuji temple in Koshi
goe (near Kamakura) have been free of the sound of the insects. Benkei was
finally killed defending his master’s castle against Yoritomo’s forces.
Benkei is usually depicted wearing black armor under a priest’s coif. He is
thus often known by his priestly name, Musashibπ Benkei. In some depictions he
wears the hexagonal pillbox hat of the yamabushi and is seen carrying his seven
implements on his back. And he is just as often shown following a youthful,
almost childish looking Ushiwakamaru. Benkei is barely mentioned in the Heike
Monogatari, one of the main sources about the Gempei war and its aftermath.
His life is more extensively documented (and possibly fabricated) in the Gikeiki
(translated by McCullough as Yoshitsune [1966]), written two centuries later.
The popular appeal of this figure was so strong that whatever his origins, his
stature grew to that of one of the best-known Japanese mythical heroic figures.

BENZAITEN
Often called “Benten,” she is the only female member of the Shichi Fukujin. She
is depicted riding on a dragon and playing a Chinese lute (pipa, or biwa in Japan
ese). Benzaiten is the deity of love and of feminine accomplishments and also the
boddhisattva of entertainers.
Benzaiten is the personification of the river that flows from Mt. Meru,
where, according to some traditions, the Buddha has his abode. Her name means
“the deity of talent and eloquence.” She is identified as a river kami and as the
sea goddess as well. The famous “floating” shrine of Itsukushima, built on in the
shores of the Seto Inland Sea near Hiroshima, is dedicated to her.
She is often pictured accompanied by a small white snake with a woman’s
head, called Ugajin, the name of an important fertility kami.

BIMBOGAMI
The god of poverty. Bimbogami’s attentions will lead to poverty and misery, and
people in some locations in Japan will carry out personal rituals to avert the
god’s gaze. His attendant is the Death Watch beetle (Anobium notatum), a small
black insect that infests rotted wood and old wooden houses, whose clicking
betrays the presence of the kami. Bimbogami is black, and he is the shadow of
Fuku-no-kami, the kami of wealth.
Until the latter half of the twentieth century, poverty was a very real threat
for most Japanese. The average person could do little to stave off poverty, some
times due to the exactions of landlords, sometimes to absence of work or famine.
Poverty and the kami of poverty could not be avoided or propitiated. One could
only hope that it would pass one by. There are thus no shrines or temples to
Bimbogami.

BINZURU-SONJA
One of the Buddha’s first disciples (rakan) who fell from grace and is usually not
126 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



allowed into the hallowed company. Some say he came from a long line of physi
cians. He was unfortunately addicted to drink, and the Buddha had to warn him
several times against his weakness.
In one version of his myth, the Buddha was asked by a wealthy merchant for
help. The merchant and his household had been plagued by demons. Being busy,
the Buddha sent one of his senior disciples, Binzuru, to attend to the matter.
Binzuru carried out the exorcism, and the evil was banished. The grateful mer
chant then prepared a feast for the disciple. After many entreaties by his host,
Binzuru finally succumbed to an offer of a small cup of wine. Not able to stop,
he soon drank too much, and the evil demons were released. The Buddha was
very annoyed and dismissed Binzuru from his company. Binzuru, still the
devoted disciple, would stand outside the hall where the Buddha lectured, to fol
low the lesson. When the Buddha was about to die, he summoned Binzuru and
told the former disciple that he was aware of his devotion and he was therefore
forgiven, but that Binzuru could never enter nirvana: He was bound to serve the
people forever.
In another version of the myth, the first disciples, sixteen in number, were
meditating. Binzuru (who seems to have been a more earthy figure than most),
commented casually on the beauty of a passing maiden. As a consequence he
was banished from the fellowship of the disciples. Forgiven on the Buddha’s
deathbed, he was nonetheless condemned to minister to those unable to attain
enlightenment rather than enter nirvana.
Statues of Binzuru are commonly found outside temple buildings. They may
be painted red or made of red wood. (For those who prefer the drink story, many
people experience a flush when drinking alcohol, and a red face in Japan signifies
someone given to drink.) All the statues of Binzuru are polished and shiny from
the hands of believers. One rubs the saint’s body at the spot of one’s own pain,
and the affliction goes away.
The myth of Binzuru is part of the vast body of myth and belief that anchors
Japanese Buddhism to the here and now. Although the esoteric and soteriologi
cal elements of Buddhism are not concerned with bodily afflictions and illness,
this is clearly a concern of anyone living in the world. As a consequence, many
myths attach to particularly “mundane” or merciful figures to help ease personal
affliction. Kannon, Jizπ, and the saint Kπbπ Daishi are examples, along with
Binzuru, of Buddhist figures whose main attraction for the average Japanese per
son is the help they give in the mundane world. Binzuru is at one extreme of
these figures: a popular, nonsaintly figure nonetheless attached deeply to Bud
dhism. At the other end of the continuum is Kannon, a divine figure attached
directly to the Buddha’s mercy. The Daishi is somewhere in-between.

BISHAMON-TEN
One of the Shichi Fukujin (seven gods of good fortune), Bishamon-ten is depicted
as an armored warrior in the Chinese style, carrying a Chinese halberd. In his other
hand he carries a small pagoda—the traditional repository for scrolls of the Bud
dhist canon (the sutra). Bishamon is the protector of Buddhist Law, and conse
quently, the god of happiness: By his protection people can find happiness and
avoid misfortune. Bishamon-ten’s miniature pagoda, or reliquary, has five super
imposed parts representing the elements of the universe. It also represents the iron
tower from which Ry∆go (Nagarjuna) received the secret scrolls of the Law. He is
master of the northern direction and as such, traditionally, the dispenser of
largesse and good fortune (which accounts for his membership in the Shichi Fuku
jin), because the North was supposed to be the land of treasures guarded by spirits.
Bishamon-ten is also a member of the Shi Tenno, the four heavenly protec
tors/emperors. Therefore, in his own character, Bishamon-ten is viewed as pro
tector in times of war. In his persona as protector of the Law, he aided Shπtoku
Taishi in his war to establish Buddhism at the imperial court. The famous war
lord Uesugi Kenshin (1530–1578) was consecrated to Bishamon-ten, and one of
his banners always bore the first syllable of that deity’s name.

purification after his visit to the underworld. Originally perhaps a phallic deity
of fertility and joining, his phallic symbol was placed at crossroads. Even today
such phalluses (some very large) of wood or stone can be found in small rural
shrines. In some well-known onsen (hot spring spas) Chimata-no-kami is
erected, and men with sexual problems, as well as women wishing for children,
will come to stroke the phallus and ameliorate their condition. Chimata-no
kami is one of the aspects of Dosπjin.

CHISEIKORO KAMUI (AINU)
The Ainu god of the house. He resides in the northeast corner of the house,
where the household treasures—swords, robes, lacquered boxes, and tubs of
Japanese manufacture—are stored. Together with Kamui Fuchi, the hearth god
dess, he protects the house. He is often said to be her husband.
The relationship between Chiseikoro and Kamui Fuchi exemplifies the
domestic relationships among the Ainu. Although the husband was dominant in
some areas, it was also clear from this and other mythical relationships that in the
domestic sphere, the woman was dominant. And clearly, Chiseikoro is responsi
ble for treasures that were the domain of men: imported and trade articles.

CH  ̄UJ  ̄O-HIME
“Guard-general princess” is the Japanese Cinderella, and a paragon of the virtue
of filial devotion. Born, according to the story, on the eighteenth day of the
eighth month of the eighteenth year of emperor Shπmu’s reign (747), she was the
daughter of an imperial minister and his wife, a royal princess. Childless, they
appealed to Kannon and were granted a daughter in exchange for the life of one
of the parents. At the age of three (some say five), therefore, the young girl’s
mother died. Her father subsequently remarried. The stepmother hated the girl
and ordered her taken into the mountains and killed. She was saved from death
and brought home to her father. Disappointed, however, by the vanity of the
world, she entered a monastery, where she meditated upon Buddha Amida, pray
ing for the reincarnation of her mother in the Pure Land of the West. Years of
austerity followed, during which she became a “living Buddha.” As she was at
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 129



the end of a period of austerity, Amida Butsu appeared to her in the form of a
nun, and, in response to her prayers, wove a cloth of five colors in one night,
depicting the Bunki mandala, which shows the cosmography of the Pure Land.
The mandala covered the entire wall of the room she was in (a considerable feat,
considering that looms of the day were much smaller than the width of a room).
Ch∆jo-hime represents one of the most familiar and well-loved of the Bud
dhist miracle stories. Many of those were promulgated and told throughout Japan
as examples of Buddhist principles and of the power of Buddhism. The myth is so
attractive to Japanese because it contains major elements of Japanese ideology: fil
ial piety, austerity in search of an ideal, and the mercy of the Buddha.

CH  ̄USHINGURA
The Ch∆shingura (Treasury of Loyal Retainers) tells the tale of the forty-seven
retainers of the lord of Akπ who were loyal beyond death. In the early eighteenth
century, the young and inexperienced Lord Asano Naganori of Akπ drew his
sword in the shogun’s palace after being mortally insulted by Lord Kira Yoshi
naka, a shogunal retainer and master of ceremonies. Because of this, Asano was
sentenced to death. Forty-seven of his retainers swore to avenge their lord’s
death on the man who had caused the incident, even though the shogunal gov
ernment had forbidden their official request for a blood feud. For three years they
pretended to obey the government’s ruling and acted as rπnin (masterless war
riors), while secretly making preparations. In early 1703 they made their way to
the villain’s home in Edo (now Tokyo), attacked the premises, and placed Lord
Kira’s severed head on the grave of their lord.
The shogunate government wished to execute them as common criminals,
but due to public pressure, which was excited by the conspirators’ self-sacrifice,
allowed them to commit sepukku (ritual disembowelment) instead. Several
plays, including Ch∆shingura, were written about this event, which is reenacted
every year in November, though the costumed retainers now travel on the sub
way from the location of Lord Kira’s villa in Shinagawa (where the murder took
place) to the graves of the loyal band in the Sengakuji temple.
The Ch∆shingura myth is one of the most popularly influential in Japan. It
reinforced and dramatized the ideas of self-sacrificing loyalty that were the basis
for the Japanese view of themselves as capable of utmost loyalty. The plays were
as popular among the elite as among the common people and when staged today
130 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



still evoke the Japan of warrior virtues. The Ch∆shingura embodied the virtues
of bushidπ, the Warrior’s Way, which was formulated during the Edo-period
peacetime. It provided some of the underpinnings of the blind ferocity and loy
alty exalted by the Imperial Japanese Army during the lengthy years of the
Pacific War (circa 1936 to 1945, and including World War II).
The story of the forty-seven rπnin is one of three major national myths of
Japan (the other two being the kamikaze and the divine antecedents of the impe
rial house). It defined for Japanese civil society since the eighteenth century
what being Japanese was: self-sacrificing, loyal to one’s superiors beyond the
grave, and capable of limitless sacrifice. Whatever the facts of the story (some
historians argue that the original quarrel was Asano’s fault, not Kira’s), the
drama was incontestable. It was felt not only by the warrior class who governed
Japan but also, and no less, by the townspeople, who were already becoming a
significant cultural factor. The idea of loyalty became so deeply ingrained that it
was easily exploited by Imperial Army recruiters and modern industrial con
cerns alike. That the myth is based on actual events, and that these events can
be verified by anyone wishing to see the graves of the protagonists, makes it even
more powerful and imposing.

DAIGENSHURI-BOSATSU
Zen protector of monasteries and Buddhist Law, and protector of seafarers. Tra
dition has it that he was one of the sons of Asoka, an Indian emperor of the Mau
ryan dynasty who was a strong supporter of Buddhism. Reborn a magistrate on
the southern coast of old China, he was noted for his piety and justice to the day
he died.
In one story, Dπgen, the founder of the Sπtπ Zen sect, had traveled to China,
staying for four years and studying the principles of sudden enlightenment. On
the final night of his stay, he was busy copying a rare manuscript given him for
the purpose by his teacher. Daigenshuri’s spirit appeared to Dπgen and aided the
sage’s efforts, supplying him with illumination throughout the night.
As Dπgen returned home across the stormy China Sea, Daigenshuri—who
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 131



had boarded the ship unknown to the sage—calmed the storms and insured that
the Zen idea would reach the shores of Japan safely. Daigenshuri is thus por
trayed in the dress of a Chinese magistrate, with a tall hat, symbol of his rank.
One of his hands is shading his eyes, indicating his dual responsibility as
guardian of the Law and as a navigator at sea.

DAIKOKU
God of wealth, and one of the Shichi Fukujin (seven gods of good fortune), he is
Ebisu’s father. Normally depicted as a jolly man with lucky fat earlobes, he
wears a soft squashed hat and flourishes a wooden mallet. Every blow of the mal
let brings forth a shower of oval-shaped ryπ (gold coins). Daikoku wears volumi
nous court trousers, and he is perched upon two or three bales of rice. Daikoku
is so wealthy and happy that he is unconcerned by the rats that accompany him
and gnaw into the bales: There is bound to be more grain. The presence of the
rats also implies the lesson that one should always work to preserve one’s riches,
otherwise they will be carried away by misfortune. Daikoku is particularly wor
shiped by farmers and, as the god of wealth, by merchants. His image in the form
of plaques or sometimes small figurines can be found in many shops throughout
Japan. He is sometimes identified with ∏kuninushi, the kami of Izumo and the
Lord of the Land, because one way of writing his name is “Great land,” the same
as ∏kuni(nushi).
Daikoku is one of the most powerful and enigmatic of Japanese kami. His
name also can be written as “Great black,” and he is identified with the Indian
Buddhist deity Mahakala, the dark lord. His transformation from Mahakala and
his association with ∏kuninushi tie him to magic and necromancy. And though
this association has declined in importance since the Edo period, Daikoku’s
importance is indicated by the fact that the main pillar of a traditional house is
still called daikokubashira (daikoku pillar) to this day. Notwithstanding
Daikoku’s power, he is still most commonly known as a rather jolly member of
the Shichi Fukujin and the father and associate of Ebisu.

DAINICHI NY  ̄ORAI
Buddha represented as the sun. Dainichi is the Japanese translation of the San
132 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



skrit Maha-Vairocana (Great Illumination), the central emanation of the uni
verse. Dainichi is often represented as seated at the heart of a red lotus with
eight petals, representing the fount of all things. He is viewed in Shingon
thought as the center of wisdom and mercy and the main (sometimes, sole) uni
versal deity.
Dainichi is often identified in Ryπbu (“both sects,” that is, Buddhist and
Shintπ syncretism) with Amaterasu-π-mikami. He represents the ultimate real
ity of the world. He is often depicted holding a double-headed, three-pronged
lightning bolt—a kongo—which emphasizes his role in sudden enlightenment.

face and body are blue, and he may be represented with any number of faces and
arms. He rides a bull or buffalo—the symbol of perseverance against resistance
and in some areas of Japan was worshiped primarily by owners of draft animals,
whose patron he was. He is sometimes identified with Monju-bosatsu.

DAKINITEN
A Buddhist deity who is often conflated with Inari. Dakiniten is the Japanese
transformation of a type of female Indian demon called dakini, attendants of Kali,
goddess of death, and bearers of her blood cup. They were converted to Buddhism
by Dainichi Nyπrai. In Japan, the demon type became changed to a single person:
Dakiniten. She is usually depicted sitting on a flying white fox. Her face is white.
She is the patroness of magical spells, and there are special spells said in her name
to promote success. The flying fox on which she rides originated in India, and this
relationship creates her association with Inari, as either his assistant or as an
avatar, she being the honju (universal deity), he being the suijaku (Japanese man
ifestation). She carried a flaming jewel (the sign of Inari) in her left hand. She is
sometimes, though rarely, identified as Sae-no-kami.

DARUMA
The Japanese rendition of the name Boddhidarma, a Buddhist sage who brought
a form of Buddhism to South China and became the founding saint of Zen Bud
dhism. Most of the myths surrounding Daruma are of Chinese origin and in Chi
nese settings. Daruma arrived in China in a mysterious way, in response to the
need to teach the Buddhist Law. He founded the Shπrinji temple (Shaolin in Chi
nese) and gathered many students. In his pondering upon the Law, he decided
that the way to salvation was through meditation. As a result, he spent nine
years meditating facing a wall, in which time his legs withered to stumps.
Finally, falling asleep just before reaching enlightenment, he ripped off his eye
lids in a rage and threw them away. Where they landed grew a magical bush,
whose leaves could be brewed into a liquid that would banish sleepiness. This
bush became known as cha (tea) and is drunk to this day as a refreshing antidote
to sleep.
Daruma noticed that his disciples were having difficulty in maintaining the
immobility and concentration required in order to complete their enlighten
ment. As a consequence, he formulated a series of body and arm exercises,
including jumps and kicks, and taught his disciples how to practice martial
134 Handbook of Japanese Mythology
A doll of Daruma, Zen founder, peering out from an offering tray (Courtesy of the author)



moves as an aid to concentration. This was the beginning of the various kenpo
(fist art) styles that evolved into unarmed combat we know today.
Finally, once the monastery and his teachings were well established,
Daruma stepped onto a reed, which bore him across the sea to the West, back to
his homeland in India.
Daruma is usually depicted wearing red robes (in reference to the saffron
robes of Buddhist monks), one drape of the cloth held over his head like a hood,
and barefoot. He is bald, with a beard and fierce staring eyes. He is often depicted
in the form of a round-bottomed doll that when pushed over immediately rights
itself. He is, in effect, the patron saint of determination and self-discipline.
Before undertaking an effortful commitment, many Japanese will acquire a
Daruma doll with blanks for eyes, then paint in one eye. The second eye is
painted in only when the commitment has been accomplished. Collections of
seven such small dolls can be bought, with reference to the idea that even
Daruma is reputed to have failed six times before succeeding in the seventh try
in reaching enlightenment.

DATSUEBA
A skeletal figure who denudes the dead of their clothing as they cross the
Shozukawa River at the entrance to the world of the dead. Datsueba (Naked Old
Man) strips the dead of whatever clothes they were buried in, whether rich or
poor, and hangs them on the branches of a leafless tree. Datsueba is thin, all his
bones showing and his cheeks sunken. His denuding of the passers to the land of
the dead is said to make perfectly clear to them that they have finally left the
land of the living, never to return. In some versions he is called, or has a female
counterpart, the Shozuka-no-baba.

DIVINATION
Divination was, and in some places still is, an important aspect of Japanese
belief. Many of the deities mentioned in the myths practiced divination. The
kami Hitokotonushi (One Word Master) could be applied to for terse answers to
questions put to him. Kotoshironushi, one of ∏kuninushi’s sons, was another
important divination kami. In many other instances in the Kπjiki and
Nihonshπki, actions and results are determined by divination, which the kami
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 135



themselves practice. The two most notable instances are the divinatory contest
between Amaterasu-π-mikami and her brother Susano-wo to determine whether
Susano-wo intended to usurp his sister’s position, and the Empress Jing∆’s div
inatory trance that precipitated her invasion of Korea. Several deities could be
applied to to divine the answers to specific questions, and the practice was so
widespread that few major decisions were reached without reference to divina
tion. A special bureau existed in the imperial government responsible for noth
ing else than divination and interpretation. To this day a number of shrines and
temples hold lengthy divination rituals, some lasting for over twelve hours. Div
inatory rituals such as that can involve the use of a boiling cauldron, the use of
patterns made by evergreen leaves, trance, usually by miko (temple maidens),
dreams, contests, and so on.
The heavy use of divination is not surprising considering the difficulties of
life in premodern Japan. Hunger and famine were always around the corner, and
life was not safe from human or nonhuman afflictions—disease, earthquakes,
fire. Unsurprisingly, many of these disasters were personified: hunger
(Hidarugami), poverty (Bimbogami), earthquake (Namazu), fire (Kagutsuchi-no
kami). The process of personification is not random or whimsical. It allows
humans a means, however fanciful or technically weak, to affect and deflect the
calamities. This is particularly the case because, as noted elsewhere in this vol
ume, the moral position the Japanese adopted was that of a family. Impersonal
fire can, and will, burn without control. But fire personified as a deity is a rea
sonable person, and, moreover, a member of one’s family however many times
removed, and may be, therefore, propitiated. The major problem with all deities,
as Guthrie (1980) notes, is that one needs a means of communicating with them.
Divination is one such means, and it includes within itself the understanding
that the communication will be uncertain and often even vague. None of the
oracles mentioned in the myths provide direct, clear answers. Like all commu
nication, the responses are often unspecified and elliptical and sometimes are
disregarded by recipients. Even the kami themselves are prone to divination,
perhaps for the same reason: There are so many of them that no single kami is
able to act without, in some way, receiving input from others. The Assembly of
the Gods can perhaps be seen in this light: a form of divining the kami (in the
sense of the immanent power, rather than the personified deities) will.

136 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



DIVINE DESCENT
One of the three most powerful myths of Japan as a nation (the other two being
the kamikaze and loyalty exemplified in the Ch∆shingura). The myth of the
descent of the heavenly grandson, Ninigi-no-mikoto, to rulership provides a
direct connection between the divine and the Japanese people. Combined with
the concept of dπzoku (extended household relationship), this implies two
things: that individual Japanese are directly related to the divine, and that the
political system of emperorship is divinely sanctioned.
The turning point of Japanese society, following this myth, is the descent of
Ninigi-no-mikoto from heaven to assume his rulership, following the mandate
of his heavenly grandparents. Everything else in Japanese polity flows from this
one event. The myth is clearly one that was reinforced, and perhaps engendered,
by the ruling class of the Yamato state, and reinforced by the Japanese empire.
And, though all Japanese know this myth, not all subscribe to it, nor do all see
it as the foundation charter of the state. Nonetheless, political philosophers, as
well as nationalist-inclined religious and political figures, tend to take this myth
seriously as a political and national charter.
Since the end of World War II and the abolition of the formal relationship
between religion and the state in Japan, the myth is no longer as central as the
pre–World War II government wished it to be. It is, however, still an extremely
powerful viewpoint among many Japanese.

DIVINE RULERSHIP
Divine rulership was attributed to the line of emperors descended from Amat
erasu-π-mikami. However, establishing the rulership of the land was a long
process. Masakatsu-no-mikoto was ordered to go down and assume rule, but he
declined the honor in favor of his newborn son, Ninigi-no-mikoto, who set forth
a program of pacification that ended only many generations later. Ninigi-no
mikoto’s grandsons spread out from Ninigi’s palace in eastern Kyushu and paci
fied all tribes on their way, eventually establishing the divine kingdom in
Yamato. All the emperors of Japan, male and female, from that day to the cur
rent emperor, Heisei, are of this lineage.
For ancient Japanese—and no less for modern ones, at least up to World War
II—the divine authority of the emperor was unquestioned. The genealogy was
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 137



sanctified and was tremendously important both to the position of the emperor
and to the entire Japanese political system. In a very short time (relatively speak
ing) after the establishment of the Yamato state, the emperors lost their politi
cal clout. First it was to the Fujiwara family (and, in fact, the Fujiwara family and
their cadet branches are as much the imperial house in Japan as any other, except
that because they contributed the female side, this is discounted), then to the
shogun of the Minamoto bakufu, then to the Hπjπ regents (claiming to be
another offshoot of the Fujiwara!), other shogunal branches, and strongmen.
Whomever the ruler was, the emperor, a descendant of the heavenly kami, con
tinued to reign. Notwithstanding a few political hiccups after the Kamakura
shogunate ended, the imperial line has not attempted to rule since. Having been
politically displaced did nothing to lower the prestige and reverence with which
the emperor was held. In practice, the government that held the person of the
emperor was the legitimate government, and with a few very archaic exceptions,
such as Taira no Masakado, there have been no attempts to dismiss the imperial
family. At the heart of the reasoning was the fact that the imperial lineage was
demonstrably (at least, in myth) the direct link between the heavenly kami and
humanity. Unlike European or Chinese ideas of divine rulership, divinity was
not conferred upon the ruling emperor by the gods or by merit so much as a very
real, unquestioned part of his very person.

D  ̄OJ  ̄O-H  ̄OSHI
A child endowed by the thunder deity with supernormal strength. One day, the
story tells, a man was working his fields when the thunder kami fell to ground.
The farmer, who had been leaning on his iron hoe (iron is considered a sovereign
defense against snakes and thunder), wanted to strike the fallen (and presumably
terrifying) apparition. The thunder kami then promised, in exchange for his life,
a wondrous child.
The farmer returned home, and some time later his wife conceived and then
gave birth to a boy. He was born with a snake around his head (the thunder
deities are strongly associated with snakes; see, for example, the myth of
Izanami in the underworld). The boy was troublesome, uprooting trees in his
play, or drinking the village well dry. Eventually he became a novice to a tem
ple, where he was a diligent student but also strong enough to save the temple
in times of trouble. Many of his descendants, including women, were as strong
as he was. It is said that among his descendants was Benkei’s mother.
138 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



There are a number of Japanese myths in which a strange boy appears to a
man or a couple and grows up with the strength of many men, or sometimes
other powers. The Dπjπ-hπshi myth is repeated in numerous variants across
Japan. Many of these strong-men are described as giants, or as demigod heroes
who formed the hills and rivers of the landscape. Some such heroes include the
giants Sakata-no-kintoki and Musashibπ Benkei.

DOS  ̄OJIN
Deity of crossroads and of fecundity. Dosπjin is often represented by a wooden
or stone phallus, and offerings of wooden phalloi are made at Dosπjin shrines.
Dosπjin is often referred to as Sae-no-kami, and it is possible that at some time
in the past the functions or nature of these deities might have been different. He
is also identified with Chimata-no-kami, born of Izanagi’s trousers.

Sarutahiko, who helped in pacifying the Central Land of the Reed Plains, was
deified and worshiped as Dosπjin. Dosπjin in his character as Sae-no-kami is also
seen (as is the scarecrow deity) as the repository of knowledge about the world.
These two functions—prosperity and knowledge—were clearly related in Japan
ese thinking (as elsewhere, for example, in Greek mythology) by the association
with crossroads: This is where both goods and articles would be exchanged; and
with the phallus representing fecundity. Unsurprisingly, many other deities are
associated with this complex as well, for example, Dakiniten, who is seen as a
deity of plenty, and also of knowledge, or perhaps better, information.

D  ̄OZOKU-SHIN
The kami of an extended family cluster. Families in some areas of Japan, par
ticularly the Northeast and mountain areas where land was scarce, would
organize themselves into family clusters. These consisted of a main house—the
honke—and several branch houses originating either from the main house or
from other branch houses, called bunke. The houses’ relations were hierarchi
cal, each one owing obligations directly or indirectly to the honke. These obli
gations were financial, political, and, most important, ritual. Each branch house
was obligated to support, in worship and offerings, the shrine of the main
house. The kami worshiped by the main house thus became the dπzoku-shin of
the entire cluster.
Often the dπzoku-shin was viewed as the ancestor of the main house, and
thus of all members of the branch houses as well. Dπzoku that have the dragon
kami Ryujin as their deity often accept that the dragon-kami or a magical snake
was the ancestor (sometimes ancestress) and founder of the main house.
In a broader context, the Japanese people as a whole constitute a dπzoku.
The Imperial House is the honke, and all other Japanese households are bunke
related and differentiated by their closeness to the imperial house. The dπzoku
shin in this case would be Amaterasu-π-mikami, tutelary deity and ancestress of
the imperial household.

EARTHLY KAMI (KUNITSU-KAMI)
Deities who inhabited and ruled the earth before the descent of the heavenly
grandson. The vast category of kunitsu-kami is usually opposed to the concept
of amatsu-kami (heavenly kami). Many of the myths of the Nihonshπki and of
the Kπjiki have to do with the struggle between the heavenly and earthly kami.
The earthly kami do not in any sense represent evil, merely opposition to the
divine way of things, and to the domination of the heavenly kami. There is no
single myth that explains the presence of the earthly kami, though one could
argue (as do some mythical exegeses) that the earthly kami are simply those
kami born of Izanami and Izanagi’s labors and who were not “assigned” to
heaven.
In many cases, earthly kami accept the domination of the heavenly kami
with good grace and proper humility, offering their daughters as wives and being
appointed rulers of their locales. This happens often in the myth of the heavenly
grandson, as well as Susano-wo, who is both heaven-born and an earthly kami by
his expulsion from heaven. In other cases (Takeminakata-no-kami, ∏kun
ishushi’s son, is one major example) they resisted, only to be defeated more or less
spectacularly by the hero of the hour, be it Takemikazuchi or Yamato-takeru.
The primary earthly kami is ∏kuninushi, as indicated by his name (Master
of the Land), his activities (creation of the land), and his importance during the
subjugation. Another figure is Oyamatsumi, who gave his daughter to Susano
wo to wed. The name may simply be a generic title for any mountain kami, as
it appears several times in the Kπjiki in different contexts.
In a broader interpretative sense, the earthly kami serve two functions. On
the one hand they (or at least, some of them) may have been local clan deities
that were subdued by the Yamato in their march to imperial greatness. In
another sense, they also represent the personification of the land itself: a
recounting of the process whereby the Yamato overcame not only the peoples
living in particular places in Japan but also the locale itself, absorbing it into the
empire. The presence of inferior earthly kami also bolstered the Japanese court’s
view of itself, as masters of the peasants around them who worked for the aris
tocratic manors. The aristocrats often saw themselves as the authors and geni
tors of civilization and culture, which they brought to the inferiors under their
control, thus the necessary subordination of those who worked the earth, as well
as, symbolically, the earth itself.

EBISU
Kami of luck and good fortune, patron of fishermen, and a member of the Shichi
Fukujin. Ebisu is often depicted in concert with his father, Daikoku. He wears tra
ditional Heian period clothes and brimless black hat, is usually holding a fishing
rod, and holds a large red tai (sea bream) under his arm or slung over his shoul
der. Ebisu is a marebito (a “visiting” deity, whom one does well to treat with
respect). Fishermen, particularly along the shores of the Seto Inland Sea, often
catch him in their nets as he floats from place to place. If the trawl is hauled in,
he transforms himself into a curiously shaped stone. The crew possessing such a
stone, if it is worshiped and given proper offerings of drink and fish, will have for
tunate catches. Ebisu is one of the rusugami (caretaker kami) who keep an eye on
the land while the gods are having their annual assembly at ∏kuninushi’s palace
in Izumo. He does not heed the summons for the assembly because he is deaf, or
pretends to be. He therefore invented the practice of clapping hands and ringing a
bell at a shrine to attract the attention of the kami. This is still practiced today
by every visitor to a shrine. The kami, particularly Takamimusubi-no-kami, are
very suspicious of Ebisu’s absences, and they test Ebisu’s hearing from time to
time, which is why he doesn’t always answer petitioners.
As the kami of good fortune, Ebisu aids merchants in finding and accumu
lating wealth. He is also sometimes identified with Sukunabikona, another
marebito, or with Kotoshironushi-no-kami. Like many marebito, he sometimes
appears as a wandering traveler who if treated hospitably will provide good for
tune. He is also sometimes identified with the god Hiruko, who has neither arms
nor legs. In the Ryukyus, Hiruko goes to live in the palace of the dragon-king of
the sea, returning at adulthood to become god of fishermen and of commerce
(Ebisu). Ebisu is sometimes identified with whales, because like Sukunabikona
and Ebisu, they come during a season bringing bounty, then depart again to the
depths of the sea.
The fish he holds—a tai, one of the most palatable fish in Japan’s seas—is
homonymous with medetai (congratulations). It is a staple of Japanese weddings
and other major celebrations that invoke good fortune.
The figure of Ebisu is extremely enigmatic, as evidenced by the number of
other kami he is associated with. Of all the Shichi Fukujin—his most popularly
recognized identity—he is the most elusive and ungraspable. He is at one and the
same time friendly and threatening, available to the common man and
extremely elusive. If anything, he is the antidote, or opposition, to many of the
things the kami stand for. Not of any one place, he is at all places, and always a
wanderer.

EMMA-  ̄O
King of the dead and their judge. He appears in the robes of a Chinese magistrate,
carrying a shaku (a thin, flat board about one foot long that was used by court
officials to rest scrolls they were reading on, and became a symbol of rank and
authority) and wearing a crown or bonnet on which appears the character
“king.” He has a fierce expression with a red face and protruding canine teeth,
but like Jizπ, with whom he is sometimes identified, he cares for those under his
care. He is merciful, and one can also appeal to him for help from disease. Emma
π is a Buddhist figure of Chinese antecedents. Because both he and Susano-wo
are rulers of the underworld, they are identified as one and the same.

EN-NO-GY  ̄OJA
Mythical founder of the Shugendπ order of syncretic practice in the seventh cen
tury and a powerful wizard. Also known as En-no-Ozunu and En-no-Ubasoku (an
ubasoku is an unordained monk). He is supposed to have lived between 634 and
701, but there is no evidence of his existence aside from later writings. According
to myth he lived as a hermit in the mountains of Katsuragi, on the border
between the provinces of Kii and Yamato, where he meditated and practiced
magic. He was able to coerce demons to do his bidding in mountains and water.
He revered Buddhism and used the power of its spells to produce his magic.
He was powerful enough to call several deities and oni to him, command
ing them to build a bridge between Mt. Katsuragi and Mt. Kimpu. The oracle
deity Hitokotonushi-no-kami slandered the sage, saying he was plotting to
usurp the emperor. En-no-Gyπja (En the Ascetic) was exiled, and he withdrew
into the mountains to meditate. There he practiced the magical formula of
Kojaku-π, the peacock king, which allowed him eventually to subdue and con
trol Hitokotonushi. Due to his magic, the ascetic was able to fly and even reach
heaven itself. He was accompanied by two demons he had subdued, and under
their master’s direction they built bridges for pilgrims in the mountains.
Among other feats, he is the Johnny Appleseed of Japan: He planted ten thou
144 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



sand cherry trees on Mt. Yoshino, and their blossoms may be enjoyed by visi
tors today.
On a visit to Shikoku he found a valley ravaged by a fiery serpent. Using his
powers, he subdued the serpent and bound it to the earth. This magic lasted for
over a century, until it had to be renewed by Kπbπ Daishi.
En-no-Gyπja is revered by the yamabushi (mountain ascetics, also called
kebπzu, “hairy priests,” because they did not shave their heads as other Buddhist
priests and monks do) as the founder of their order. The story of the sage’s con
trol of the oracle deity may be an explanatory myth for the activities of the yam
abushi as diviners, twined with a story that emphasizes the superiority of
Buddhist over native Shintπ practices. For many Japanese throughout history, the
importance of Buddhism was that it offered magical solution to daily distress and
fears. The yamabushi—esoteric practitioners whose rituals were based largely on
Shingon—were often the only visible religious presence in remote mountain vil
lages. Their adherence to the teachings of this remote mythical leader gave the
yamabushi a strong claim to practice magic and supernatural powers.

FII NU KANG (RYUKYUAN)
The deity of the hearth. In the very diffuse system of Ryukyuan beliefs is gener
ally considered a female and the point of access to the world of the kang (deities).
Fii Nu Kang is probably the most frequently addressed of the Ryukyuan kang,
and there is usually both a household hearth and a communal hearth through
which she can be addressed. Very similar to, but far less personified than, the
Ainu deity Kamui Fuchi.
The difficulties of lighting and maintaining a fire, and the centrality of the
hearth, are not too apparent to modern life. They are, however, critically impor
tant to technologically simple people, and many religions have extolled and pre
served the sanctity of the hearth. It is not surprising to find that the hearth deity
is of paramount importance to both Ainu and Ryukyuans. This importance is
overshadowed in complex polities such as the Yamato state by deities who sup
port the Great Tradition and are supported and maintained by the state apparatus.

FOOD DEITIES
The ability of Japan’s traditional societies to maintain a food surplus, and thus
ensure freedom from famine, was limited. It is thus unsurprising to find that a
number of Japanese deities are recognized as kami of food, and that several dif
ferent myths account for food in human life.
The most important food kami, ritually speaking, is Toyoukebime (also
Toyouke-π-mikami and Toyouke-no-kami), or “Plentiful food princess.” One of
the daughters of Wakamusubi-no-kami, who came into being from the urine of
Izanami as she lay dying from giving birth to the fire deity, she is not otherwise
mentioned in the myths. However, her main shrine is the Geig∆ (Outer Shrine)
at Ise-jing∆. The Inner Shrine is the famous shrine to Amaterasu-π-mikami,
Shintπ’s major shrine, indicating that food was secondary only to the existence
of the imperial house.
However, another myth is far more significant for understanding the Japan
ese approach to food. This is the double myths of Ukemochi-no-kami (from the
Nihonshπki) and of ∏getsuhime (from the Kπjiki). Both of these myths are sim
ilar in outline, though the actors differ. In the Nihonshπki version, Ukemochi
no-kami was an earthly deity who was the kami of food. Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto,
Amaterasu’s younger brother, was sent to her as emissary by his sister. Uke
mochi-no-kami offered him food that she extracted from her mouth. Insulted by
her actions (because the food was polluted by having been in her mouth),
Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto kills her, then returns to Amaterasu to report on his
actions. Amaterasu banishes him to the night sky but sends to see the corpse. In
the corpse various useful items are discovered: in her head, cattle and horses; in
her forehead, millet (the most important food grain before the introduction of
rice); on her eyebrows, silkworms; in her eyes, panic grass (another food grain);
along with rice in her belly, and wheat, soybeans, and red beans in her genitals.
The Kπjiki version has different protagonists. In his wanderings on the
earth, after having been exiled from heaven, Susano-wo came upon the deity
∏getsuhime. She gave him shelter and offered him food. This she extracted from
her mouth, nose, and rectum. Insulted, he killed her. From her corpse grew var
ious things useful for humankind: silkworms from her head, rice seeds from her
146 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



eyes, millet from her ears, red beans from her nose, wheat from her genitals, and
soybeans from her rectum. There is no mention of Susano-wo’s fate after the
murder, but we know from the myth of ∏kuninushi that he eventually came to
rule in a great hall. Susano-wo has a second connection to food. His daughter
Ukanomitama-no-kami, by his second wife, Kamu-π-ichi-hime, is revered as a
food deity. It is possible that the differences between different tellings of the
same myth may represent two mythical traditions, that of Yamato and that of
some other culture.
Finally there is, of course, Inari. The Inari myth recounts an old man appear
ing with sheaves of rice over his shoulder. Although this myth is clearly related
to food, it is no less an aristocratic rather than a commoner myth: Rice during
the Heian period, when Inari worship first became widespread, was a newfangled
food, the province of the aristocracy in the capital Heian. It did not become
important as a major staple until much later.
The issue of food was crucial for the Japanese as for any agriculturally-based
society. However, they also acknowledged the fact that growth implied death,
and that the death of the previous season’s plants was a necessary part of the
next season’s crops. It is no less important that the Japanese in these myths were
actually dealing with two oppositionary phenomena that they associated cultur
ally. One is the association of food with decay, and thus of life with death.
Inevitably, one follows, and is dependent on, the other. Death was highly pol
luting in Japanese culture, and this aspect of the myth is strongly emphasized in
both versions of the food goddess myth. Indeed, the Japanese are perhaps the
only culture that identifies foodstuffs with excretion (though perhaps the
authors of both versions were exhibiting a hint of a sense of humor in associat
ing beans with the rectum).
Another cultural opposition is in evidence in these two central myths as
well. The kitchen, where food was provided for men, was the essential domain
of women. And women in archaic Japan could be divine, but they could also be
polluted by their association with menstrual and birth blood, a polluting status
that was reinforced with the arrival of Chinese culture (where women were
always subordinate to men) and Buddhism (where women were definitely pol
luting). The authors of both versions (as well as the myth of Toyouke’s origins)
seemed to be hinting at the contradiction that pure food for pure men was
nonetheless prepared by impure women.

FOX
Animal that features in many legends, either as messenger to the deity Inari or
as a sly magical creature. As messengers of Inari, foxes are protected and their
goodwill solicited. As magical animals they are feared and sometimes killed.
Foxes are both good and bad omens. As night howlers and haunters of temple
gates (near the graveyards, which are on the grounds of Buddhist temples) they
were considered bad omens. But white foxes, black foxes, and nine-tailed foxes
were considered good omens from the gods.
The fox can give a variety of gifts. A fox marrying a human produces half
fox human offspring with great powers, sagacity, and strength. Or the fox might
provide its human spouse with a magical device—a jewel is common—that will,
for example, fool tax-assessors into believing the fields are barren. Foxes also
reward benefactors and punish transgressors.
Foxes in general, and white foxes in particular, were reputed to be the messen
gers of Inari, kami of wealth and harvest and worldly success. This may be because
the rice harvest was associated with the yearly migration of the Yama-no-kami
(Mountain deity) from the mountains to the rice fields, where he assumed the title
of Ta-no-kami (Rice-paddy deity). Similarly, the fox moves between the wild areas
of the mountains and the area of human habitation on the plain. Foxes, particularly
the envoys of Inari, were also reputed to carry a ball of fire about with them, with
which they could both enchant and be enchanted. Inari shrines are always flanked
by statues of foxes, some carrying bags of rice, some carrying jewels, others sheaves
of rice. White figurines of foxes are offered at Inari shrines as well. In some shrines
it is possible to borrow these images for a time to ensure success in a venture.
Foxes became associated with Inari in the following manner. A pair of old
magical foxes lived in the mountains. They were both of unusual appearance:
The husband had silvery points on his fur, and the wife had the body of a fox but
the head of a deer. They had five progeny, equally strange. One day they went
and knelt before the shrine to Inari. They said, “Though we are dumb brutes, we
are not without finer feelings, nor without sense, and we desire to serve the
shrine in some capacity to do good.” As a consequence, they and their brood
were made the guardian assistants of Inari, as they remain, appearing in people’s
dreams and reporting what was going on to the kami.
Foxes have magical powers whether associated with Inari or not. In particu
lar they have the ability to transform themselves into people. Travelers at night
who are solicited by a beautiful woman are probably being ensorcelled by a fox.
The only way to find the truth is to observe whether the lady has a tail—the only
part of its anatomy the animal is unable to transform.
One of the most common legends concerns the fox wife: a fox, who for one
reason or another (usually tragic) assumes the shape of a woman. In one famous
148 Handbook of Japanese Mythology

story, the fox spirit follows a drum that had been made of the hide of one of its
offspring. In another, Abe no Yasuna saved a fox from hunters. Some time later
he courted and married a beautiful young woman named Kuzunohana. She left
him after bearing a son, Seimei, who became the famous wizard and astrologer
Kamo Yasunari. Yasunari saved the life of the emperor by discovering that an ill
ness was caused by a nine-tailed fox who had disguised herself as human and
become the emperor’s favorite concubine. The famous hero Yoshitsune had his
own encounter with a fox. In the Kabuki play Yoshitsune senbon zakura, a fox
takes on the guise of Yoshitsune’s retainer Tadanobu following the drum made
of his parent’s skin. He hears the voice of his parents when the drum is struck.
When Yoshitsune learns of this, he gives the drum to the fox, who, in return,
supplies the hero with magical protection.
A man once met a beautiful woman; they married and had a child. They had
a dog who gave birth to a litter at approximately the same time. But when the
puppies grew a bit older, they started barking whenever the wife was near. She
begged the man to kill them, but he refused. Then one day the wife was startled
by a puppy that she had come too close to. The puppy started barking, and she
jumped on to the fence and turned back into her natural form of a fox. The hus
band loved his wife dearly and, vowing never to forget her, begged her to return
to sleep with him at night (kitsune = “come and sleep” but also “fox”), which
she agreed to do.
Far more serious is fox possession. Possessed people bark, eat from dishes on
the floor, and are fearful of dogs. They may be successful at the expense of their
neighbors, and were thus shunned and attacked in Japan until recently. In some
recorded instances whole families were extirpated because they were suspected
of being fox-possessed and thus preying upon their neighbors.
The various aspects of the fox—powerful, willful, dangerous, and malicious
but also family-oriented and loyal—created an image that was both admired and
feared. Foxes are, in effect, a variation on the marebito theme of powerful
strangers. The fear foxes engendered was projected upon successful families in
farming villages in a form of envy transference: One was expected to rejoice at a
neighbor’s fortune, yet at the same time, one was envious. Thus accusations of
being foxes, often leveled against wealthy families, served in small, close-knit
Japanese hamlets as a way of expressing envy and jealousy in a form that was
mythically and socially acceptable.

FU-DAISHI
The protector of libraries and collections. Fu Xi (497–569) was a learned abbot
and philosopher in Liang, a Chinese kingdom of the period of the Six Dynasties.
He invented a rotating vertical table that allowed storage and display, and the
honoring, of the entire Buddhist canon, the Daizπkyπ. As a consequence, he and
his two sons, Fujπ and Fuken, who usually flank his image, are considered
guardians of libraries.
Many ecclesiastical libraries in Japan show these three figures. Fu-daishi
himself is usually shown seated on a broad Chinese chair, his two sons as
smaller figures standing on either side. The sons are portrayed often as laughing
monks, like Hπtei. However, one is shown with his mouth open (saying om, the
first syllable), and the other’s mouth is closed (saying hum, the last syllable),
indicating their role—like the koma-inu and the Ni-π—as guardians of the Law
from beginning to end. Fu-daishi is popularly known as warai Botoke, the laugh
ing Buddha, an image also popular in the West.

FUD  ̄O MY  ̄O-  ̄O
One of the most popular deities in Japan, and the most commonly depicted of
the heavenly kings, Fudπ, whose name means “Immovable,” represents resolute
and immovable determination. Fudπ is the supreme barrier against evil and sub
duer of forces hostile to the Buddhist Law. He is the direct envoy of Dainichi
Nyπrai and is his avatar. Fudπ is portrayed carrying a sword and a rope to bind
evildoers. His body is usually black or blue. His eyes are staring, and his facial
expression is fierce. He is also often portrayed as having two long fangs project
ing from his mouth. Fudπ stands or sits cross-legged on a rock, signifying his
immobility and steadfastness, and is surrounded by flames. Fudπ is always
accompanied by two young servitors; on his left is Kongara-dπji (“What is it
about?” boy), who carries a lotus flower and stem signifying the Law, and on his
right is Seitaka-dπji (Gangling youth), whose one hand shields his eyes while the
other holds a gourd, signifying the cosmos or the emptiness of life.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 151



Fudπ Myπ-π surrounded by flames (Courtesy of the author)



Fudπ grants strength to withstand all perils and to overcome tribulations.
Gyπja (Shugendπ ascetics) would invoke Fudπ’s name before engaging in auster
ities such as standing under waterfalls, walking across coals, or climbing sword
blade ladders. He is also invoked during the goma fire ceremonies in Shugendπ
practice and in the Tendai and the Shingon esoteric schools of Buddhism. He is
the most active of all avatars of the Buddha.
Fudπ, paradoxically for his association with fire, is also the deity of water
falls. This comes about because of his title as “the Immovable.” Shugendπ asce
tics would appeal to him to aid them during periods of meditation under freezing
mountain waterfalls, to keep them still and unmoving under the cold and pres
sure of the water.
Fudπ’s main shrine is at Narita City (near Tokyo’s international airport).
The image enshrined there was made in China. The sage Kπbπ Daishi was told
in a dream that it wanted to travel to Japan, and when he returned home he
brought it with him. It was deposited at Takao-zan, a mountain temple about 40
miles from the fishing village of Edo (now modern Tokyo). During the Masakado
rebellion, the statue was brought close to the rebel headquarters, and a fire rit
ual was performed before it for three days, as consequence of which the rebel was
defeated. The statue indicated it wished to stay in the neighborhood to continue
to subdue evil. The emperor had lots cast for the site of a sumptuous temple, and
Narita won. The temple houses a sword donated by Emperor Shujaku, which
banishes insanity and evils of possession by foxes.

FUGEN-BOSATSU
The boddhisattva of good practice. He is represented riding on one of the elephants
that support the world (a borrowing from Indian cosmology). Fugen represents the
virtue embodied in the world, including all the buddhas and boddhisattvas of all
the multiple universes. He carries a fly-whisk, a symbol of majesty and rule. Often
a companion of Monju-bosatsu, they flank images of the Buddha Shakyamuni, the
historical Buddha. Fugen appears to those who meditate upon the sutras, riding his
six-tusked elephant. This elephant is the incarnated nature of the Buddha, who
first appeared on earth in his incarnation of a six-tusked elephant.

FUJIN
The wind god. He has a demon’s staring, horned, and fanged head, and claws on
his hands and feet. He grasps a bag from whose open mouth issue the winds. He
is sometimes shown as companion to Raijin (Raiden) the thunder deity.
Winds were, of course, of great importance to the Japanese. They brought

FUKUROKUJU
Member of the Shichi Fukujin, he represents longevity, wisdom, and occasion
ally, carnal pleasure. He is represented as a small-statured man, almost a dwarf,
whose bald, hair-fringed head is sometimes the length of his body. He is dressed
in Chinese robes and is reputedly the avatar of a Chinese philosopher. The shape
of his head evokes the image of a phallus, and he is often displayed in the form
of a traditional harigata (dildo), or as a statue of that shape. This may either be
a result of the original shape of his head or because of the Chinese association of
longevity and Daoist wisdom with sex and the principles of yin and yang (female
and male). His image can thus often be found, together with another of the
Shichi Fukujin, Jurojin—with whom he is often confused—in Japan’s red-light
districts. He is sometimes accompanied by a stag, a symbol of longevity.
Fukurokuju is usually portrayed as a jolly, fun-loving deity, more at home in the
company of Ebisu and Hπtei than the other more dour of the Shichi Fukujin.

FUTSUNUSHI-NO-KAMI
A sword or warrior kami dispatched with Takemikazuchi to subdue the Central
Land of the Reed Plains (as told in the Nihonshπki). He is one of the kami in the
composite Kasuga Daimyπjin deity. He is the main deity worshiped at the Katori
shrine as a martial and protective deity. A famous sword-fighting school—the
Katori Shinden-ryu—is named for him. He is appealed to for protection, success
in the martial arts, and guidance at sea. In the Kasuga shrine, Futsunushi is wor
shiped as an avatar of Yakushi Nyπrai.

GAMA-SENNIN
“Toad sage,” also known as Kosensei. An elderly man with a warty hairless skin,
he is said to live forever, able to change himself into a toad. He is one of the immor
tal sages, of Chinese Daoist origin, who are associated with longevity and medicine.
Gama-sennin’s constant companion is a three-legged toad, whom he often carries
on his hand or back. He is also the creator and manufacturer of magical pills, and
whomsoever manages to secure them is able to extend his lifetime. Gama-sennin
himself sheds his skin like a toad, and thus renews himself as necessary.
The adoption of the immortals concept from Daoist origins was done unsys
tematically in Japan, and without much of the philosophical-popular basis that
formed the origin of these ideas in China. Gama-sennin is one of the most pop
ular of these figures, often depicted in carvings and drawings.

GHOSTS
Y∆rei are a name given to a number of mythological phenomena that can be sub
sumed under the English term ghosts. Many of these stories fall under the cate
gory of legend or entertaining story rather than myth. However, they contain
some mythical elements that are important.
Y∆rei stories can be grouped into a number of categories. One of the most
important mythical elements is the idea of gaki, or hungry ghosts. In Japanese
social thought, individuals were members of a household, or ie, before their
birth, during their lives, and after death. The dead were expected to be main
tained—by worship, offering, and remembrance—by their descendants. When
this was not done, the ghost would become dangerous, preying on the living and
bringing afflictions such as maladies. The idea perhaps originated in China, but
it fit well into the Japanese conceptions of the role of the family.
Ghosts of defeated armies and warriors occupy a prominent place in mythol
ogy. There are a number of myths related to the calamitous defeat of the Taira
clan at Dan-no-Ura (1185). A well-known story tells of Hoichi, a biwa (lute)
player. Traditionally, lute playing was an occupation reserved for the blind, and
Hoichi was no exception. One night he was approached by a samurai in full
armor. The soldier informed the musician that he was the retainer of a visiting
daimyπ who wanted his presence to be kept secret, and who wished to hear a
recitation of the Heike Monogatari, the story of the defeat of the Taira. After
156 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



playing for some nights to the august company, he was questioned by the abbot
at the temple where he was staying. The abbot had him followed, and he was
eventually found playing by himself in the rain at the memorial stone to the
drowned infant emperor Antoku. Other fallen warriors are often reported to
appear under specific circumstances or places associated with their death.
A second major theme of interest is the “ghost mother” who cares for her
child even after death. A woman who visited a sweet shop, purchasing a special
kind of local candy, was observed clandestinely by the shop owner, then fol
lowed to a gravesite in which her baby was found against the dead body, sucking
contentedly on the sweet. Similar stories are to be found throughout Japan.
A third theme is that of malevolent ghosts. Sea ghosts follows ships or fish
ermen, demanding the use of a pail. If they are not provided with a pail without
a bottom, they fill the boat with water. The ghosts of those who have died on
high mountains or mountain passes may seek to entice passers-by to their
deaths, or kill them outright. Temples (and their associated graveyards) are often
the sites of ghostly apparitions, whether as warnings or by vengeful ghosts.
Defeated armies aside, most of these stories highlight the fears and anxieties
common to the Japanese. The “ghost mother” myth illustrates in one setting the
intense emotional relationship between Japanese and their mothers that has
been documented by recent psychological and sociological studies, and female
obligations to protect and nurture even beyond the grave. The uncertainty of
sailor’s lives and the risks they run are alluded to in the stories of ghosts entic
ing crews to their deaths. And the specter of starvation and want has haunted
the Japanese countrypeople until fairly recently.
For the Ainu, ghosts were an expression of the evil side of a deceased person.
These tukap may appear in the dreams, either to convey a message from the
deceased or to bring a message from Kamui Fuchi, or some other important
kamui. As a result of such an apparition, the person’s ramat, or spirit, may
undertake a journey. If the ramat loses its way or cannot return for some rea
son—such as the sleeper’s sudden waking—then the person may die.
Ghost stories and legend are mythological in two senses: First, they consti
tute explanatory tales for local communities, that is, they are part of the Little
Traditions rather than the imperial or national myth corpus. Second, in some
instances, for example, the myths related to the defeated Taira clan, ghost sto
ries constitute “cultured myths” used to evoke mood and feeling, rather than
specific explanatory tales. They are related to the imperial and national myths
in that they evoke concepts of self-sacrifice and loyalty to one’s superiors even
beyond death.

GONGEN
A general term for syncretic deities who are protectors of mountains or impor
tant areas. There are a number of such gongen, the title usually preceded by the
locale name. The one exception is the deification of Tokugawa Ieyasu
(1543–1616), founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, often simply
called “Gongen-sama” (Sir Gongen).
Gongen are expressions of the honji-suijaku concept, by which Shintπ
deities and Buddhist ones were seen as the same. Thus the local deities of moun
tains at specific localities in Japan were “Buddhiscized” and received the title
gongen. In formal terms they are the avatars of named boddhisattvas.

GO-SHINTAI
Representation of the kami in Shintπ worship. Every Shintπ shrine houses an
object associated with the kami. These objects are extremely varied. In fishing
villages, odd-shaped stones caught in fishermen’s nets are assumed to be the go
shintai of the kami Ebisu and are enshrined either in the boat itself or in a small
shrine on the shore. Objects associated with the kami—bows and stirrups, both
associated with war for the kami Hachiman; writing brushes in Tenjin shrines;
statues of Inari—may be enshrined too. Some go-shintai are actual statues of fig
ures dressed in court robes or, in the case of Inari, the deity’s fox messenger. Go
shintai are surrounded both metaphorically and actually with layers of secrecy.
They are ensconced in containers that are rarely opened (never, in the case of the
imperial household regalia at Ise and some others), which are often wrapped in
several layers of cloth and paper. Opening such a container, when it is done, is
part of a lengthy ritual. The three most important go-shintai in Japan are the
three items of the imperial regalia.

GOZU-TENNO
The emperor Gozu, ox-headed deity of the underworld in Buddhist mythology.
He is the deity of disease and plague and is therefore invoked for protection
against the calamities he brings. He is similar to other mythological figures such
as the Ainu Kenash Unarabe, invoked because of fear and their power to do
harm. Gozu-tenno is often identified with Susano-wo, who was banished to rule
the underworld by his father, Izanagi.

GUT LENGTH
Modern myth prevalent in the last decades of the twentieth century. Japanese
people are said to have longer gut length due to a historical diet that was prima
rily vegetarian. This is supposedly a distinguishing feature of the Japanese, and
indicates their physical as well as mental uniqueness, and difference from the
rest of humankind.
The myth was first formally stated as such in the 1980s by Hata Tsutomu,
then the Japanese agricultural minister. Though part of an economic-political
defensive move (Hata was arguing against importation of American beef, claim
ing that Japanese, being largely vegetarians historically, had a longer gut and
therefore could not digest beef), it was firmly believed by many Japanese, and
often repeated colloquially.

HACHIDAI RY  ̄U-  ̄O
Eight dragon kings. Originally the naga or snake spirits of Indian belief, these
became the dragon kings in China, from whence they arrived in Japan. The eight
dragon kings rule dragon- and snake-kind, and are personified in the form of
Ry∆jin, the dragon kami. They reside under the ocean or in large lakes, and their
abode is a magical palace surrounded by gardens. The dragon kings are not all
powerful. Their magic resides in a ball, or pearl, whose virtue is that it controls
desires. They are also vulnerable to other powerful entities, as the story of
Tawara Toda indicates. Generally benevolent, one or another of these dragon

HACHIMAN
“Eight banners,” one of the major deities of the Shintπ pantheon, Hachiman is
associated with the activities of war and culture. As a Buddhist deity he is wor
shiped as a daibosatsu (great Buddha) and protector of Buddhist temples. Go
shintai in Hachiman shrines are generally either a bow or a stirrup, referring to
the classical mounted archer, and more rarely a writing brush, referring to his
nature as deity of culture and learning. Doves are his messengers. Appealed to
during the Mongol invasions of Japan, Hachiman sent the kamikaze (divine
wind) to sink the combined Mongol-Chinese-Korean fleet.
In the second century C.E. Empress Jing∆, following a vision from the kami,
engaged in a campaign of conquest in Korea. Pregnant by her deceased husband
and fearful that childbirth would slow down the campaign, she wrapped herself
with tight bandages and tied a stone weight to her belly, thus managing to carry
the baby for three years in the field. Her son, the emperor ∏jin to-be, was born
once the campaign was over. Jing∆ had dreamed that if her son was born after the
campaign was won, he would be a deity, and the child was born with a mark
resembling a bow guard on his forearm, thus confirming his wondrous origin. In
the sixth or seventh century, the mother-and-son combination were identified
together as the deity Hachiman.
∏jin, the fifteenth emperor of Japan according to the Kπjiki, invited Korean
and Chinese scholars to educate his son and courtiers in the ways of the world.
As a consequence Hachiman is the patron god of writing and culture, as well as
war, divination, and protection.

HASHINAU-UK KAMUI (AINU)
Hunting goddess in Ainu mythology. She protects hunters, often appearing to a
good hunter to show him the best place to find game. She is also the deity of the
full catch for fishermen. Of great assistance to humankind, she was born of the
base-plate of the fire-drill. Some say she is a relative of Shiramba Kamui, others
that she is sister to Kamui Fuchi, goddess of the hearth. She is also called
Isosange Mat (Bringing-down-game woman), and appears as a small bird to show
hunters the location of their prey. In her person as Kamui Paseguru (Potent per
son), she is represented by the aconite plant, with which the Ainu would poison
their arrows for the hunt.
For the Ainu, who subsisted largely on gathering, fishing, and hunting,
Hashinau-uk Kamui is obviously of great importance. She may be invoked as an
aid in childbearing and is often described as having an infant on her back.

HEAVENLY FLOATING BRIDGE
The vantage point between heaven and the formless waters from whence
Izanagi, stirring with his jeweled spear, stirred the waters. As a consequence, the
liquid formed clumps, and drops of water falling from the tip of the spear formed
the islands, bringing about the creation of the Central Land of the Reed Plains.
The Heavenly Floating Bridge is sometimes equated with the Milky Way,
though that celestial phenomenon is more usually interpreted as the Heavenly
River. The bridge joins the heavenly and earthly realms, though its precise
nature is undisclosed.

HEROES
Like most other mythologies, Japanese mythology includes a list of heroes. Most
of these heroes were samurai of note, whose reputation may have been enhanced
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 161



with the retelling. They are largely characterized by the concept of loyalty—to
one another or, more important, to their superior—which is their driving char
acteristic. Many of the heroic myths are structurally similar. Two themes pre
dominate. One is the struggle against hopeless odds and eventual defeat. The
other is the statement, in action, of principles that have become almost a
byword for Japanese culture: the virtues of group action, loyalty, and honor. The
heroes depicted here, and in separate entries, such as Benkei, Kintoki, and
Yoshitsune, are not by the standards of the modern world necessarily wholly
admirable. Many are avaricious, and some are vicious and disruptive. But to the
people of the Japanese Middle Ages they displayed precisely the qualities of
bravery and dedication that were the hallmark of the age. This entry provides a
number of exemplary heroes. The list is by no means exhaustive, and only a few
of the most notable heroes are mentioned.
Hachimantarπ (original name: Minamoto-no-Yoshiie) was born in 1042 (d.
1103). On the eve of his birth his father had dreamed he was handed a sword by
the kami Hachiman, deity of war, and he thus nicknamed the boy Hachiman
tarπ (Young Hachiman). A famous archer, warrior, and general, Hachimantarπ
was capable of sending an arrow through three armored men. He was also the
main force in subduing the Ezo of northern Honshu. While warring during a
period of severe drought, he shot an arrow into a rock and brought forth clear
water for his troops. On one occasion crossing a river during a storm, he threw
his armor overboard, which not only calmed the river but dammed its flow to
this day. He was so well known as an archer that when the emperor fell ill, the
mere twanging of Hachimantarπ’s bowstring was sufficient to scare away the oni
that was the source of the malady.
Minamoto-no-Tametomo, Hachimantarπ’s grandson, was seven feet tall,
and his left arm was longer than his right, making him a great archer like his
grandfather. He carried an eight-foot-long bow, and his arrows were five feet
long. He boasted about his prowess and in one incident challenged two bowmen
to shoot arrows at him. He caught the missiles in his hands. He was very violent
as a boy, and like another hero, Yamato-takeru, was sent away, in his case to the
isle of Kyushu, which he subjugated in two years. He became a follower of
Emperor Go Shirakawa and during the Hπgen Insurrection (1156: fighting
between Taira and Minamoto that brought about the end of the Heian era) killed
two warriors with a single arrow. The victorious Taira exiled him to Oshima
after severing the muscles of his arm. Nonetheless, he remained a formidable
archer, and when men were sent to kill him, he sank the leading boat with one
arrow. Subsequently he committed suicide rather than fall into his enemies’
hands. In some legends it is said that he escaped his assassins to the Ryukyu
Islands, founding the ruling house there.

Tomoe Gozen, a great beauty, became the concubine of Yoshinaka, a hero
of the Taira, after her father’s defeat. She killed a number of men during the
fight, on one occasion turning aside a tree trunk one warrior aimed at her head.
She was captured and then became the concubine of another of the victors.
Watanabe-no-Tsuna, one of Raikπ’s retainers, spent the night in front of the
Rashπmon gate of Heian, which was reputed to be the location of the last oni in
Japan (Watanabe’s master, Raikπ, having cleared the rest out). The oni Ibarakidπji,
who had been one of the retainers of Shutendπji, whom Raikπ and his retainers
had killed in an earlier adventure, attacked after midnight. Watanabe cut off the
oni’s arm in the struggle, but the demon escaped into the night. The hero secreted
the gruesome relic in a box. Years later an elderly woman begged to see the arm,
and when the box was opened, she changed into an oni, took the arm, and
escaped. When Raikπ fell ill, a monster thought to kill him, but Raikπ cut off the
monster’s tongue. Watanabe followed the bloody trail the monster had left. Deep
in a mountain cave he found a giant spider, six feet high, its legs covered with
sword-hard bristles. Using a pine tree as a club, he battered the spider to death.
Minamoto-no-Yorimasa, a descendant of Raikπ’s, killed the nuye (a chimera
with the head of a monkey, claws like a tiger, and a tail that ended with a ser
pent’s head) that had afflicted the emperor with illness, shooting in the dark
with his bow. He committed suicide after the defeat of his candidate for the
emperorship, and his spirit was transformed into fireflies because he burned
with spite and greed during his life.
One of the most significant heroic figures for the modern era was Kusunoki
Masashige. A famous warrior at the end of the Kamakura period, he was a parti
san of Emperor Godaigo and a first-class guerrilla leader. During Godaigo’s
attempt to reestablish imperial rule on the wane of the Kamakura shogunate,
Kusunoki was one of his main supporters. He died in a futile battle at Minato
gawa (near modern Kobe), obedient to the emperor’s command, and against his
own better strategic judgment. He was mythicized by the Shπwa war govern
ment as the perfect example of self-sacrifice and obedience to the emperor. As a
consequence, he was made into an inspiration for the kamikaze corps of the
imperial airforce and navy at the end of World War II.
The character of most of the heroes of Japanese myth is, at least, ambiguous.
They are prepared to use all means, fair and foul, to attain their goal. Most of
them are graced by physical prowess, and many of them come to tragic ends.
Two other features identify the heroes of the period (historically speaking, most
of them, perhaps with the exception of Yamato-takeru, operate during the Heian
and Gempei periods). Quite often they are members of assemblages of heroes,
such as Raikπ’s band. And they operate with the imprimatur of, or claim to be
supporting, the emperor. Nonetheless, as is made clear from their actions, they
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 163



are individualists, even egoists, reaching for their own goals. This is particularly
true in the case of Tawara Toda, who explicitly dithers between choosing to side
with the emperor or with the usurper Masakado. Finally, just as the heroes of the
archaic periods, the descendants of the heavenly grandson, bring about topo
graphical features and names, so too do the heroes of this era, albeit in a much
reduced scale. In this period, the islands of Japan have emerged as places with
well-known and clearly identifiable features, and the heroes lend their names
(and strengths) to the creation of local and national myths.

HIDARUGAMI
The spirit of hunger. This is an evil spirit or ghost that can inflict itself on trav
elers in remote locations. When possessed by such an apparition, the individual
becomes faint, often losing consciousness, which can be restored only with dif
ficulty by applying mochi (pounded rice cake) or some other ritually special food
stuff. Untreated, the victim will die. Hidarugami is often interpreted as a form
of ghost of someone who died a lonely death on some moor or mountain pass.
Attacks of Hidarugami can be avoided by carrying a morsel of rice or mochi, or
by reciting nembutsu or some other distracting prayer.
The prevalence of Hidarugami stories, which are found throughout Japan, is
an indication of the very real problems of hunger and starvation that threatened
most of the rural population of Japan in premodern times. Like most premodern
people, Japan’s population has gone through recurrent periods of famine because
of crop failure or greedy landlords. The specter of Hidarugami is thus a personi
fication of a very real and immediate problem for this population. The problem
was particularly severe for those individuals who had no support group—travel
ers and pilgrims. The cure for Hidarugami is one that, under the circumstances,
was almost guaranteed to work.

HIRUKO
The leech child, first born of Izanami and Izanagi. In the Kπjiki Hiruko is por
trayed as a failure. He was born after his mother had erred in addressing Izanagi
before he addressed her. Hiruko, born without arms or legs (thus one interpreta
tion of his name, leech child) was placed in a boat of reeds and floated away.
Hiruko is nonetheless a powerful deity. He is identified with Ebisu, another
marebito or wandering deity: In one myth, Hiruko’s boat brought him eventu
ally to the palace of the dragon king of the sea, from whence he returns at odd
times as the deity of fishermen and is called Ebisu.
Another interpretation of the same myth depends on another reading of the
name: sun child. In this version the limbless Hiruko is actually the recurring
phenomenon of the sun, which is another form of marebito, visiting humans
with blessings on a regular schedule.
Though they seem at odds, the two versions are closer than one might
think. One of the major themes of Japanese mythology is the dualistic relation
ship between purity and pollution, and between life and death. The association
of femininity with pollution and death (as exemplified in the visit of Izanagi to
his wife in the underworld) is one of those paradoxes. The association of purity
and pollution exemplified in the oppositional interpretation of Hiruko’s name
may well be another case in point: Ancient writers may well have been at pains
to point out that purity springs from pollution, and that the two are not so far
apart as might be thought.

HITOKOTONUSHI-NO-KAMI
The “One-word deity” of Mt. Kaduraki. One day Emperor Y∆ryaku was ascend
ing Mt. Kaduraki with his retainers. They were dressed in uniforms of blue
attached with red cords. As they ascended, they spied another group of people
dressed in the same way. The parties approached one another. The emperor
understandably demanded to know the identity of these people, who by their
dress seemed to be claiming kingship in opposition to himself.
The opposing party mirrored the emperor’s demands.
The emperor and his men fitted arrows to their bows. The emperor then
said, “Tell us your names, before we discharge our arrows” (the code of conduct
for warriors was to identify themselves individually before engaging in combat).
“Since I have been asked first,” retorted the leader of the other group, “I
shall tell you that I am the One-Word-Master deity of Kaduraki!”
The emperor promptly apologized, saying he did not realize the kami man
ifested himself in this form, and he and his attendants stripped and offered their
clothes to the deity. The deity accepted the gifts and accompanied the emperor
to the base of the mountain.
Hitokotonushi is a kami often invoked for divination. His responses were in
the form of a single word, which could determine the fate of the individual. Later
Shugendπ tradition has it that the kami accused En-no-Gyπja falsely of plotting
to usurp the throne and was subsequently subdued by the sage and made to do
the sage’s bidding.

HODERI-NO-MIKOTO
Eldest son of Ninigi-no-mikoto and Kπnπhanasakuya-hime. His father sus
pected Hoderi was not his natural son, as his mother announced she was preg
nant after one night with her husband. As a consequence, Hoderi was born in
the midst of the flames his mother set in the birthing house to prove he was of
divine origin.
As an adult, Hoderi the fisherman quarreled with his brother, Ho-ori-no
mikoto, after the younger brother lost his brother’s fishhook. Persecuting his
younger brother, Hoderi came to grief when Ho-ori allied with Owatatsumi-no
kami, deity of the sea, and received the tide-raising and tide-lowering jewels.

HO-ORI-NO-MIKOTO (HIKOHOHODEMI)
One of the children of Ninigi-no-mikoto and Kπnπhanasakuya-hime, and the
grandfather of Jimmu-Tenno, first emperor of Japan. He was nicknamed Yama
sachi-no-hiko (Mountain luck prince) and Hikohohodemi. His brother Hoderi
no-mikoto was a master fisherman, and one day they agreed to exchange lucks.
But when Ho-ori tried fishing he was unable to catch a single fish, and lost the
luck—the fishhook—in the bargain. Hoderi insisted on the return of his luck,
but Ho-ori was unable to comply. Even breaking his sword and making a gift of
five hundred fishhooks from it did not mollify his brother. He then offered a
thousand hooks, to no avail, as his brother insisted on the original hook.
Ho-ori escaped to the palace of Owatatsumi-no-kami, lord of the sea. He
climbed a tall tree near the palace and was seen by Toyotama-hime-no-mikoto,
the sea deity’s daughter. They fell in love. Owatatsumi-no-kami, recognizing
Ho-ori and knowing his parentage, entertained him royally, and the two lovers
were married. After three years in the palace, Ho-ori pined for home and told his
father-in-law the reason for his exile. The sea deity summoned all the fish and
found the hook in the throat of the sea bream. He returned the hook to Ho-ori
and taught him a curse to put on it. Owatatsumi-no-kami also gave his son-in
law the tide-raising and tide-lowering jewels, with which he could destroy his
brother’s rice fields by denying them water or inundating them, as necessary.
One was chosen from among the assembly of crocodiles to take Ho-ori home
and to report on his safe arrival within one day. Using the devices given by his
father-in-law, Ho-ori soon triumphed over his brother, causing him to drown,
and then saving him by using the jewels. As a result, Hoderi became his obedi
ent servant.
Toyotama-hime-no-mikoto joined her husband to give birth to their child
on dry land. She begged him not to observe her during the birth, but he did so
nonetheless. As she gave birth, she changed back to her natural form as a giant
crocodile. Ashamed of having been seen, she abandoned the baby to its father
and returned to the sea, but sent her younger sister, Tamayori-hime, to nurse the
child.
A number of universal themes intertwine in this myth. They include the
younger-brother/older-brother envy competition (see, for example, Jacob and
Esau in Genesis), the palace of the dragon king under the sea (see, for example,
the myth of Urashimatarπ), the Melusine myth of the silkie mother who returns
to the sea when she is seen bathing, and the Japanese fascination with jewels as
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 167



items of power. As is not unusual in Japanese mythical perspective, it is the
younger brother who is the winner of the contest, humbling his elder brother:
another universal theme. This particular myth also marks the end of the divine
era in the classical texts (Kπjiki and Nihonshπki). From this point on, much of
the myth concentrates on the doings of humans rather than of divinities: The
next myth has to do with Jimmu Tenno, who, for all his divine ancestry and the
help he receives from the deities, is a human rather than a deity himself. The
theme of closing off the direct path between humans and divinities is also evi
dent in another element: When Toyotama-hime returns to the sea, she also
closes off the easy passageway to the undersea world her father rules. And
though it is still possible to reach the other worlds—Tokoyo, the dragon king’s
realm under the sea, Yπmi—the passage is no longer a matter of fast travel along
a road. From this point onward the three major realms—the earth, the sea, and
the heavens—are separate domains.

H  ̄OTEI
One of the Shichi Fukujin (seven gods of good fortune) and an incarnation of
Amida Nyπrai and of Miroku-bosatsu. Hπtei is depicted as a fat, jolly, bald priest
with fat pendant lucky ears. He may be surrounded, or climbed on, by laughing
and playing children. His most important asset is the sack (hπtei) from which he
takes his name. It is full of treasures that he dispenses, Santa Claus–like, to
deserving children. He also carries a large rigid Chinese fan, with which he can
waft happiness onto those surrounding him.
Hπtei is one of the most popular of the Shichi Fukujin and of all the deities.
His identification in popular imagination with Amida may be related to the fact
that unlike Ebisu, for example, he does not demand much but is more concerned
with giving.

HOTOKE
The general term for Buddha. This is used in two rather different senses, indi
cated throughout this text by upper or lowercase first letter.
Immediately after their passing, and for several years after that, the deceased
168 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



are termed hotoke by most Japanese. The period is informal and varies from one
household to another, but it can usually be considered the length of time until
the individual is no longer recognized or remembered personally by members of
the household. During this stage, the hotoke has an intense personal interest in
the doings of members of the household, is likely to return during the annual O
bon (equivalent to All Souls Day) in midsummer, and is remembered in rituals
and even in casual conversation. Once this period of several years, even decades,
has passed, the individual becomes merged in the far more featureless mass of
the household’s kami, who are remembered collectively rather than as individ
uals. Hotoke who are not treated properly—that is, presented with gifts of food,
incense, prayers, or sutra readings—by their families or a temple may become
gakki (hungry ghosts) or some other form of akuma and will plague people or
locations.
The Buddha (without personal qualification) is Hotoke—in other words, not
referring to a specific named Buddha but to the concept of “a Buddha.” The con
cept encompasses the idea of a benevolent, caring being who can be appealed to
for help, including salvation or material assistance.

IDA-TEN
The titular deity of the meal in some Zen sects. He is portrayed in full armor and
carrying a sword. He is supposed to have had a violent temper, and is thus also
a warrior deity: He is a guardian king of the south. After the Buddha had entered
nirvana, a swift-footed demon stole one of the teeth of the cadaver and escaped
at great speed. Ida-ten, one of the master’s disciples, saw the theft. He pursued
immediately, bounding over mountains and across rivers, until he finally
trapped the thief and retrieved the relic. The Japanese expression Ida-ten hashiri
(to run like the wind) derives from that story.
Ida-ten is mentioned in the premeal prayers at Sπtπ Zen temples. He pre
sides over the meals as protector of nourishment, but also as a warning about
combating and controlling the appetites. References and further reading:

IMPERIAL REGALIA
The three treasures of the Japanese imperial household—sword, mirror, and jew
els. The sword is reputed to be the weapon granted by Amaterasu-π-mikami to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 169



the imperial grandson, Ninigi-no-mikoto, with orders to pacify the Central Land
of the Reed Plains and establish the Yamato/Japanese nation. Mirrors had been
associated with the sun goddess as the device that induced her to exit the cave
she was hiding in. They were used in premodern Japan to represent the spirit, or
mitama. Metal mirrors are displayed prominently in most shrines today, repre
senting the spirit of the shrine’s kami. Comma-shaped jade or carnelian jewels
have served as indications of royalty in the Korean peninsula since well before
the establishment of the Japanese state, and were thus presumably adopted by
the Japanese from their more developed neighbors.
Each of the items is associated with a color—red for the sword, white for the
mirror, and green for the jewels—which have implications of power, purity, and
growth. These colors appear, alone or in combinations, in numerous symbolic
elements, such as the trefoil that marks certain shrines, banner colors, and even
formal correspondences.

INARI
Kami of rice, prosperity, and plenty. One of the most popular deities, Inari is most
often depicted accompanied by his messenger, the fox. His symbol is a flaming
jewel. Inari shrines are instantly recognizable by their asymmetrical red-painted
torii gates, red-lacquered walls, and statues of foxes. Such shrines are commonly
found throughout Japan’s rural areas and in many places in towns as well.
Inari’s major shrine is at Fushimi Inari, near Kyoto, where he has been wor
shiped since the Heian period. One of Inari’s cognomens is Ukanomitama-no
kami, roughly meaning “The deity of nourishment,” though Ukanomitama may
be an earlier female version of the food deity and is mentioned in the Kπjiki as
a daughter of Susano-wo. His usual name, Inari, refers to ine (the rice seedling)
and may be read as “Rice carrier.”
In the eighth century a man by the name of Irogu used a rice cake for target
practice. His arrow pierced the cake, which changed into a white bird and flew
away. Irogu chased the white bird to the top of Mt. Fushimi. There he found rice
growing (in Japanese, ine-nari), and started the worship of the kami. At first a
purely local agricultural deity, Inari’s fortunes rose when he was appointed the
guardian deity of Tπji temple, then run by Kπbπ Daishi, who had just been
appointed the emperor’s priest. It rose again when the emperor fell ill, and it was
only by granting Inari high court rank that the emperor’s illness was cured.
In Buddhism, Inari is referred to as Inari Daimyπjin. In a previous life, both
170 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Inari and Kπbπ Daishi, the great Buddhist saint and founder of the Shingon sect,
were disciples of the Buddha. They pledged that in a future life they would be
reborn in the Eastern Lands, Kπbπ Daishi to spread the word of the Buddha, and
Inari to protect the sacred teachings (a story similar to that told of the Ni-π). One
day, while staying at an inn, the disciple now reborn as Kπbπ Daishi met an
unusually tall and vigorous old man carrying sheaves of rice on his shoulder. The
saint invited the old man to come and visit him, and indeed, several years later,
when Kπbπ Daishi’s first monastery at Tπji was established, the old man
appeared at its southern (fortunate) gate, carrying more sheaves of rice and
accompanied by his family. The saint then granted the man/kami the land that
was to become the Fushimi Inari shrine.
The close association between Buddhism and the Inari cult lasted until
1873, the year the separation of Buddhism and Shintπ was formally ordered by
the government (Fushimi Inari shrine was served by Buddhist priests of the
Shingon sect until that time). It is still common in rural areas to find an Inari
shrine served by a priest from Tendai or Shingon.
With the rapid rise of commercialism and wealth in the Edo period, partic
ularly in the merchant towns, Inari assumed an added function as the kami of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 171

author)



merchant wealth and prosperity. Later, during the Meiji period and extending
into the modern period, he has become the kami of industry and finance. In
modern Japan his shrines are to be found at the corners of market streets and on
the tops of skyscrapers in the financial districts of Japanese cities.
Inari’s fox is provided for in each shrine by a small round opening cut in the
base of the wall. The opening is to allow the fox, the kami messenger and
informant, to come and go unimpeded. Those who wish to solicit the deity’s
goodwill, often leave offerings of inari-zushi, cooked rice in a fried tofu wrapping
soaked in sweet rice liquor. The fox, who is very fond of this sweetmeat, is
expected to provide the kami with only good news about the supplicant.
Inari belongs neither to the heavenly nor to the earthly kami. His late inclu
sion in the pantheon is due, perhaps, to his importation from unknown Chinese
sources, or to the mutation of an earlier food deity such as Ukanomitama under
Buddhist auspices. A syncretic deity, he may be portrayed in his Buddhist ver
sion as an elderly man, or in the Shintπ version as a man in court robes riding a
fox. Often Inari is portrayed carrying a large key, which signifies the richness of
the granaries he controls.
Inari is concerned with all worldly success. He is known as Manzoku Inari
(Fulfillment Inari) and as Susshe Inari (Success Inari). He is sometimes identified
with Dakiniten, particularly among warriors who adopted him as their house
hold deity (yashikigami), since they are both depicted riding on a white fox, car
rying the wish-fulfilling jewel in one hand and a sheaf of rice in the other.

IZANAGI AND IZANAMI
The male and female creator kami. The last two of the many deities that
emerged from chaos, Izanagi (He-who-invites) and his female counterpart
Izanami (She-who-invites) were summoned by the first-formed kami to create
the world out of chaos and rule it. They were given the jeweled spear Ama-no
Nuboko to accomplish their task. Standing on the Heavenly Floating Bridge,
they gazed at the formlessness below, puzzled about the procedure. Eventually
Izanagi suggested they try stirring the “fragrant moisture” below the bridge with
the spear. Pulling the spear up, a drop fell from the tip and coalesced into the
island of Onogoro, to which the two descended. There they decided to make
their abode. They built their house, the Eight Measure Palace, around a central
pillar, the Heavenly August Pillar. Deciding to populate the land, Izanagi turned
to the left and walked round the pillar, while Izanami turned right and did the
172 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



same. Rounding the pillar, they met each other coming in opposite directions.
Izanami could not contain herself and called out “Oh, what a comely youth!”
Izanagi, delighted, replied “Oh, what a comely maiden!” but added that it was
inappropriate that a woman should make her greeting before the man. Still con
fused as to their further actions, they were instructed in the act of generation by
two wagtails. Izanami soon bore her husband a child, but because she had spo
ken first, the child Hiruko was ugly, as boneless and limbless as a leech. Putting
the child disgustedly into a boat constructed of reeds, they tried again, but once
again produced a monster.
Thereupon the two deities ascended via the Bridge of Heaven and requested
advice. The older gods informed them that the problem was that Izanami, the
woman, had greeted her male counterpart first against the rule of nature. Chas
tened, the two returned to earth. Once again they circled the pillar, he to his
right, she to her left. This time, though, Izanagi greeted his consort first, saying
“What a delightful maiden!” to which she replied appropriately. Their mating
was fruitful. Izanami gave birth to the islands of Awaji, Shikoku, Oki, Kyushu,
Tsushima, and, finally, Honshu, the largest. They named the land Oyashima

Harholdt/Corbis)



kuni, the Land of Eight Great Islands. After that, Izanami gave birth in quick
succession to the other minor islands that surround the main ones, and to the
main kami of sea and harbor, of wind, trees, mountains, and so on.
The happy occasion was interrupted by the birth of the kami of fire, Kagut
suchi-no-kami, whose fiery body seared his mother during birth. Izanagi made
utmost efforts to resuscitate his wife but ultimately failed. As she died, various
kami issued forth from her limbs. Her death, the corruption of her body, and the
sorrow it engendered were the first experienced in the newly created world. Thus
ended the divine creation of Japan.
The tears Izanagi shed at the death of his wife brought forth further deities.
Angered by the sight of the newly born fire kami who had been the cause of
Izanami’s death, Izanagi drew his sword and decapitated the infant. The blood
coalescing on the sword brought forth eight martial kami, including the impor
tant Takemikazuchi-no-kami and his peer, Futsunushi-no-kami. Eight more
fierce kami of mountains and iron emerged from the infant’s body and limbs.
After a lengthy period of mourning, Izanagi determined to go down to Yπmi,
the land of the dead, to rescue his wife. After long travel down precipitous
places, he spied a large mansion, which he thought must be his destination. The
front gate of the mansion was guarded by demons, and Izanagi sneaked around
to an unguarded back entrance. Inside the castle he spied his wife and called her
name. They greeted one another lovingly, and Izanagi entreated his wife to come
back with him, so that they could complete the act of creation imposed on them
by the elder kami. Izanami replied that though she would like to obey him, her
return was impossible because she had eaten food while in Yπmi.
Izanagi begged her to reconsider, and she finally agreed to go into the man
sion and ask the deities of the place whether there was any way for her to return.
In the meantime, she cautioned her husband to not by any means look into the
interior of the mansion. He agreed to the condition, but after waiting for a full
day, he was seized by a sudden foreboding. Snapping one of the teeth of his hair
comb, he lit it for a torch and stole into the building. There, to his horror, he
found Izanami’s dead body. She had appeared to him in her original form as his
beautiful wife, but now she appeared as a rotting corpse. Eight snake-formed
thunder kami had been born from the corpse and were still attached to the
remains. Revolted by the horrible sight, Izanagi dropped his torch and fled. The
sound of the falling torch awoke Izanami, and she vowed to take revenge for his
faithlessness. At her word, the hag of Yπmi and the thunder deities pursued the
frightened widower.
Izanagi delayed the hag, first by throwing down his headdress, which became
a bunch of grapes that she picked and ate; then by tossing down his second comb,
which became bamboo shoots, which the hag ate as well. Izanami then sent the
174 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



eight thunder deities with a thousand and five-hundred warriors after him. He
warded them off as he ran by backslashing with his sword. He then reached the
pass of Yomotsu Hirazaka, where a tree with three peaches was growing.
Ambushing his pursuers, he forced them back with the peaches (presumably
because they represented life, as opposed to death—a Chinese idea originally).
Acknowledging his debt to the fruit, he declared them divine and gave them the
position of protecting the people of the Central Land of the Reed Plains.
Finally, Izanami herself took up the pursuit. Izanagi then rolled a huge rock
to block the pass of Yπmi. Izanagi and Izanami then stood at either side of the
rock and took their leave, Izanami vowing that she would kill a thousand of the
folk of the Central Land of the Reed Plains every day to avenge herself. To this
Izanagi retorted that he would set up one thousand and five-hundred parturition
houses, and thus more than make up by births what had been decimated by
death. From that time on Izanami has been known as the Yomotsu-π-kami
(Great deity of Yπmi). The entrance to Yπmi, still blocked by the rock called
Blocking-Great-Deity-of-the-Door-of-Yπmi, is at Ifuya Pass in the land of Izumo.
Izanagi realized that he had been polluted by his visit to the land of the dead.
He went to a small river-mouth near Tachibana in Himuka on the island of
Tsukushi (Kyushu) to purify himself. From the clothes he shed were born more
kami, and as he washed in the river, fourteen kami, first of pollution, and sub
sequently of purification, were born of the ablutions.
The last three children were born as Izanagi washed his left eye, his right
eye, and finally his nose. To the first of these, Amaterasu-π-mikami, he gave the
necklace of jewels he wore, charging her to be the ruler of Takamagahara (the
plain of high heaven). He charged the boy child born of his right eye, Tsukiyomi
no-mikoto, with responsibility for the night. The child born last, of his nose,
called Susano-wo, he charged with responsibility for the sea. Susano-wo, instead
of assuming his responsibilities, wept and complained, demanding to go to Yπmi
to see his mother. Furious, Izanagi banished him from his post to join Izanami
in Yπmi. Thereupon Izanagi retired to live in Taga in Afumi.
Most scholars agree that the myth of Izanagi and Izanami does not consti
tute a creation myth in the Biblical sense: Neither humans nor animals or vege
tation are brought forth. Instead, what is mentioned is the name of political
divisions (the names of islands and provinces) with which the Yamato scribes
would have been familiar. Once these have been established, they are populated
by deities. People, plants, and animals are givens. The importance of this myth
rests on its political underpinnings: How is rule established, and by whom? The
founder (rather than “creator”) pair are present to provide an unassailable argu
ment about the relationship of the Yamato court to the heavens, on the one
hand, and to the land, on the other. Considering the later mythical description
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 175



of dominating the land, the Yamato needed all their force and cunning, as well
as compelling arguments, to ensure that the polities they were dominating
stayed dominated. As we know from archaeology and political record, this was
not a given thing, nor was it easily attained or, once attained, maintained. It is
not therefore surprising that a great deal of effort, and mythical space, went into
a detailed account of which areas were being claimed.
A second important theme is related to the first. The importance of
women—politically and socially—in early Japan became badly eroded as the
Japanese came under Confucian Chinese influence. In the Confucian system (as
well as in Buddhism) there was no question about the subordination of women.
All three native cultures in the Japanese islands, in contrast, have actual (in the
Okinawan case) or relic (in the Japanese and Ainu case) ideas that assume greater
interdependence between men and women, and far more political equality. The
indications of female inferiority—the explanation for Hiruko’s formless birth,
and Izanami’s relegation to the polluted land of the dead—seem to be indications
of more male-oriented influences, Chinese or otherwise. This in turn relates to
the tension between pure and impure, which is the foundation of Shintπ reli
gious ideas. Pure food emerges from impure dirt. Pure men must associate with
impure women. Death and corruption give rise to green shoots and new life. All
three of these themes are interrelated and mixed in this particular myth. Politi
cal changes in the Yamato state aside (by the time the mythological texts were
written, women rulers no longer reigned), these ideological tensions between life
and death, purity and pollution, and men and women were to become the sub
strate for much of Japan’s ideology in the following centuries. It is therefore sig
nificant that the major deities mentioned—Amaterasu, Tsukiyomi, Susano-wo,
Takemikazuchi, Ukemochi—are born without contact with a mother’s sexual
parts, thus in the male-dominated view preserving their purity and kami (in the
adjectival sense).
Finally, the elder deities who preceded the founding pair are largely
Takamimusubi is the exception—passive. Once they have arrived (and perhaps
symbolize, as some scholars argue, the act of creation of the universe and its
principles) they no longer feature in the myths. It is the active deities brought
about by Izanagi and Izanami’s union (even after her death, the deities born are
considered hers as much as his) that have active parts, and become “worshiped”
as opposed to “hidden” deities in subsequent myths.
Like the Yamato-takeru and ∏kuninushi myths, the myth of Izanagi and
Izanami has echoes across the Eurasian continent. Many of the specific themes
(visit to the underworld, founding goddess to death goddess, throwing out three
items to prevent pursuit) are to be seen in European myths as well. Other
themes—founding brother-sister couple, birth of deities from body parts—can be

found throughout Southeast Asia. These similarities may have to do with popu
lation diffusion, or they may be the result of the existence of universal arche
types in human thinking: a mythical version of “great minds think alike.”

IZUMO
Izumo is an area on the Japan Sea side of Honshu Island (approximately modern
Shimane Prefecture) to the west and north of Yamato, and an archaic polity that
was the Yamato state’s most serious rival for dominance. Izumo features in the
original foundation myth a number of times. Besides being politically important,
it was also the home to both Susano-wo and his descendant ∏kuninushi, leader
of the earthly kami. When the heavenly grandson and his heirs assumed control
over the central Land of the Reed Plains, it was at Izumo, more than anywhere
else, that their rule was contested, and eventually acknowledged, by ∏kuninushi
and his sons.
Extrapolating from what is said in the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki, it is likely
that Izumo was an independent nation-state or polity, one of the many that the
Chinese recorded as controlling the Japanese islands. This conclusion is also
supported by recent archaeological finds.
It seems likely that Izumo challenged the supremacy of the Yamato state in
the Nara area to its southeast. The Yamato, using a combination of threats, mil
itary action, astute diplomacy, magical spells, and cooptation, managed to sub
due the Izumo and then attach them as subordinate allies to the nascent Yamato
empire. All of this took place sometime around the second or third century C.E.,
though Japanese traditional dating makes this about the fifth century B.C.E.
There are two aspects of Izumo that need to be considered in parallel: the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 177



Izumo polity and its opposition to the Yamato, on the one hand, and its mythi
cal significance on the other.
As a polity the Izumo were (apparently) less centralized than their Yamato
neighbors. In effect, they represent perhaps a pattern of the original archaic
Japanese political system unmodified by contacts with the more advanced Kore
ans and Chinese. They were, however, a powerful external force. Their resis
tance, judging solely from the mythical texts, must have lasted for several
generations at least. The degree of ritual autonomy they managed to maintain
was unprecedented. To this day Izumo Taisha, the shrine dedicated to ∏kuni
nushi, is the most powerful independent shrine in Japan. Izumo retained a great
deal of autonomy in the form of its worship as well as in its architecture and
internal organization. It is likely that within the accommodation to the Yamato
state, the Izumo people, or their leaders, insisted on a privileged position for
their tutelary kami.
As a mythical place, Izumo is the connection and entry point between the
three realms of Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld, including Tokoyo-no-kuni,
the mysterious land. Certain caves in Izumo were said to lead directly to
Tokoyo-no-kuni. Izumo’s direct connection to heaven is also recounted in the
myths. ∏kuninushi’s agreement with Takemikazuchi specifies that he has use
of a heavenly boat to take him up and down to heaven. And it is at ∏kuninushi’s
hall, in Izumo Taisha, that the kami gather from all over Japan in the tenth
month for the assembly of the Gods.
Izumo’s connection with wizardry and the underworld are evident through
out the myths about it. They arose, perhaps, because the Yamato, in common
with other societies, assigned to their most powerful opponents the label of wiz
ards and necromancers, or else because Izumo rituals were indeed concerned
with material efficacy, or perhaps simply because the Yamato needed an identi
fiable place for the starting place of many of their myths about the underworld.

178 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



JAPANESE UNIQUENESS
A prevalent modern myth claiming that the Japanese people, or their culture, are
unique. The myth has a complex history. Like in many other cultures, some
intellectuals have made extensive claims to Japanese primacy and cultural
uniqueness and supremacy. In the early eighteenth century Motoori Norinaga
was already claiming that one reason it was self-evident that Japan was unique
was the extraordinary quality of Japanese rice.
The creation of a self-laudatory myth of Japanese uniqueness, often called
Nihonjin-ron (Japanese logic), may well be the creation of Japanese intellectuals
and bureaucrats in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, argue many
scholars. Certainly the expressions of Nihonjin-ron in daily life tend to emerge
from the musings of Japanese intellectuals, then are accepted as true by many
other Japanese (and, of course, denied or ignored by many others). In one early
expression of Japanese uniqueness a Japanese anthropologist argued that the
uniqueness of the Japanese was due to the fact the Japanese genome had been iso
lated from the rest of Asia for millennia, and that it therefore developed in unique
directions. A later interpretation argued that the uniqueness was the result of the
mainly vegetarian diet of the Japanese, creating a unique temperament and intra
cultural understanding between Japanese. In a later development of this myth,
circa the mid-1990s, it was argued that as a consequence of a diet that eschewed
meat, Japanese intestines were longer than those of other people, proving their
physical uniqueness. The physical difference argument is also evident in the
myth attaching intellectual and particularly emotional qualities to blood type.
The Japanese, it argues, are largely and almost homogeneously type AB, which
predisposes them to particular qualities of empathy and internal unity.
All of these myths tend to have two implicit, and often explicit, similarities:
(1) The myth, however expressed in detail, argues that the Japanese are an unusu
ally homogenous people (in culture, physical characteristics, social abilities,
empathy, etc.); and (2) the myth supports the argument that the Japanese cannot
be understood by people from other cultures. Among other features cited are the
uniqueness of the Japanese language (conveniently ignoring its similarities to
Korean), the “nonexplicit” or indirectness of the language (that is, many gram
matical elements, such as personal particles, or subject, can be omitted in a sen
tence), and the ability of the Japanese, consequently, to communicate effectively
without words or by using limited vocabulary.
The prevalence of these myths is hard to assess, though some scholars such
as Befu and Oguma have done a great deal of work on the subject. Like other
myths discussed here, this modern myth is one that some Japanese adopt explic
itly, some reject, and the majority of the population are content to have avail
able in their inventory of myths that can be appealed to at need.

JEWELS
Tama (jewels) play a prominent part in Japanese mythology. They are significant
symbolic elements for both Shintπ and Buddhist myths. In Shintπ, the jewel is
usually, but not always, a magatama or comma-shaped jewel of jade or car
nelian. These comma-shaped beads, with a hole in the “head,” have been found
in many graves in Japan and Korea. Jewels first appear in Shintπ mythology in
Amaterasu’s divination/trial-by-combat confrontation with her errant brother,
Susano-wo. On that occasion, he chewed on the jewels she had woven into her
hair to keep them in separate bunches. The jewels in this case were clearly sym
bols of chieftainship for archaic Japanese. From his actions emerged several
deities. A similar string of jewels was used to draw Amaterasu from her cave
after Susano-wo’s later outrages. The tide-raising and tide-lowering jewels,
owned presumptively by Owatatsumi, kami of the sea, feature in a number of
myths, most notably that of Ho-ori and his fight with his brother Hoderi. Many
of the weapons described in the Shintπ myths were jeweled: the spear with
which the land was created by stirring the seas is one, and Susano-wo’s jeweled
sword is another. Jewels are often elaborated into the Shintπ triskelion of three
magatama jewels, their heads to the center. One exception to the comma
shaped jewel is the flaming jewel that represents Inari, kami of wealth and rice.
In this case the jewel is round, sitting at the base of a flame that surrounds and
protects it. Inari’s foxes are closely associated with these flaming jewels, repre
senting (depending on the particular interpretation) either the kami’s mitama or
the deity’s Buddha nature.
In Buddhist myths jewels are associated with a number of deities. Jizπ car
ries a jewel, as do some of the other Buddhist deities. They are the symbol of
purity, sometimes of nirvana, and will dispel evil. Jizπ often carries a jewel that
dispels evil, while his counterpart, Kokuzπ, carries the jewel of existence. Other
jewels carried by Buddhist deities—Kannon often carries one—will satisfy
desires and bring about good fortune and happiness.
Perhaps the most important jewel in Buddhism, though not generally
referred to as such, is the diamond. The hardness and brilliance of this stone
was well known to the Indians, and the early Buddhists viewed the diamond
180 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



as emblematic of enlightenment and the role of the Buddhist Law: illumina
tion, essentially unchangeable. One of the major Buddhist sutras, the
Taizπkyπ or Diamond Sutra, has become extremely popular in Japan. “Dia
mond” has been equated in Buddhist thought with thunder/lightning, and as
a consequence a great many Buddhist deities, particularly the more militant
ones, carry a weapon, the kongπ, representing both thunder/lightning and the
diamond.
Dragons, both the Shintπ and the Buddhist varieties, are associated with
jewels, usually in a round shape, an idea probably derived from Chinese Daoism.
Thus Owatatsumi, kami of the sea (often represented in the form of a dragon),
Ry∆jin, and other dragon deities are represented, or appear, in myths carrying or
giving jewels.
The Shichi Fukujin are often represented carrying, sometimes juggling, with
a jewel as part of the cargo of the Takarabune. They too are demonstrating the
association of jewels with well-being and prosperity, and the hopes that these
will endure.
The enduring qualities of jewels such as jade, ruby, pearl, carnelian, and dia
mond, and their importance in the luxury economy of the court, meant that they
implied great wealth, fortune, and magical properties. In terms of their mythical
importance, however, the term jewel (the Chinese ideogram is an object in the
possession of a king) represented majesty and power. Their hardness and bril
liance represent the very essence of stones: hard, durable and natural. It is not
surprising that they play an important role in Japanese mythology. Perhaps more
than any other material item in ancient Japan, jewels were associated with good
things, both material and spiritual.

JIMMU TENNO
First emperor of Japan, great-grandson of Ninigi-no-mikoto, and great-great
grandson of Amaterasu-π-mikami. He was the last son of Amatsuhiko-no
mikoto, the son of Ho-ori-no-mikoto from his marriage to the daughter of
Owatatsumi, the kami of the sea.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 181



From their father’s palace in Takachiho, Jimmu Tenno (he was named at the
time Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto) and his eldest brother traveled east to
establish their peaceful governance over the land.
The two brothers traveled leisurely eastward, building palaces and staying
in some places for several years at a time. At Hayasuhi, Kamu-Yamatoihare
hiko-no-mikoto met an earthly kami (that is, not one of those who had
descended from Takamagahara, the heavenly realm, with Ninigi-no-mikoto)
fishing from a tortoise’s back. This deity, Sawonetsuhiko, agreed to act as guide
on the sea lanes.
At Shirakata the brothers were ambushed by a certain Nagasunehiko of
Toumi. Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto’s brother was wounded by an arrow
and died later of the wound.
At Kumano, Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no-mikoto and his troops fell asleep,
ensorcelled by the deities of Kumano in the shape of a bear. A person of Kumano
called Takakuraji presented a sword to the sleeping hero, and he and his troops
promptly woke up and vanquished the unruly deities of Kumano. The sword had
been sent on the orders of Amaterasu-π-mikami by Takemikazuchi-no-kami,
and was named Futsu-no-Mitama.
From Kumano, the hero was guided by a giant crow sent by the heavenly
deities, meeting and accepting as his retainers many earthly deities. A man of
Uda, Yeukashi, attempted to ambush the hero but was frustrated. Yeukashi then
prepared a trap in the hall he built, but his design was frustrated by his younger
brother, Otoukashi, who disclosed the plot to Kamu-Yamatoihare-hiko-no
mikoto. Yeukashi was driven into his own trap and was killed. Subsequently, in
the process of pacification, the eighty strong men of the pit dwelling of Osaka
were killed at a feast. Finally, the hero assumed his reign name, Jimmu Tenno,
and built a palace at Kashihara in Yamato and ruled from there.
The exploits of Jimmu Tenno, with their detailed place names and the
names of his supporters and opponents, seem to be a mythical retelling of an
actual historical event or process: the gradual conquest by a people or state
called Yamato of other states and nations in central Japan. In this view, starting
in Kyushu (the “west” of the myth, though actually southwards), the Yamato
migrated (or conquered) over a period of years across the Sea of Japan to the Kii
Peninsula, and from there, past the area that is now Osaka to the area around
modern Nara, where they established the Yamato kingdom. Clearly, of course,
the myth, which indicates that certain supporters were ancestors of important
early Japanese clans, was written or recorded as a sort of imperial charter, justi
fying and explaining both place names and social and political relationships with
the imperial house. It took several centuries from the establishment of the Yam
ato court in central Japan for the imperial system to spread throughout the
182 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Japanese islands. In the process, the ancient place names and origins have been
lost. Some of the elements repeated in the myth clearly indicate archaic origins:
rituals, marital customs (several of the protagonists marry their female relatives
in what in modern Japanese society would be considered an act of incest), and
dwellings (there are, for example, remains of pit dwellings that have been uncov
ered by archaeologists).

JINUSHIGAMI
“Landlord kami,” that is, the kami who is the tutelary deity of a particular area.
∏kuninushi is the jinushigami of the Izumo area. Other kami of various titles
and importance may be the jinushigami of a particular grove, shrine precincts,
or household.
The association of a particular kami to an area is a common phenomenon.
Jinushigami may be of lower rank in the Great Tradition scheme of things, but
they are the kami actually worshiped most frequently, particularly in rural loca
tions, where they may be Yama-no-kami or Ta-no-kami as well, and where their
goodwill is important for daily survival.
In a broader context, many of the kunitsu kami (earthly kami) that joined
the heavenly kami to pacify the earth were in effect jinushigami. The Ainu have
their own master of the land in the form of the giant owl, Chikap Kamui, who
is responsible for and keeps an eye on each of the clan domains. The local kang
in Ryukyuan culture fulfill a similar function.

JIZ  ̄O
A boddhisattva, one of whose particular concerns is the roadways, and thus by
extension, lost children. Together with Kannon, he is the most popular bod
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 183



dhisattva in Japan. Jizπ is portrayed as a child-featured Buddhist monk, his
head shaven. His task is to ensure compassion on earth during the three-thou
sand-year era between the death/accession to nirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha,
and the arrival of Miroku, the Buddha of the future. Jizπ comforts those in
pain or distress, succors captives, and assists all those in need. He is the
guardian of the roads in the Buddhist pantheon, and his statues are present
along roadsides in many parts of Japan. His particular concern is the souls of
children, including those of aborted embryos and those who died in child
birth. He finds them wandering on the banks of a stony waterless riverbed in
Jigoku (hell), assists them in the construction of the piles of stones that are
their penance, and conducts them to the Pure Land. He is often twinned with
Kok∆zπ-bosatsu. Because of his role as protector of those in distress on earth,
and his connection to the underworld, he is also sometimes identified with
Dπsπjin or Sae-no-kami, the kami of the crossroads. Statues of Jizπ were
therefore often erected along lonely mountain passes or on particularly diffi
cult roads. Jizπ statues often appear in groups of six, as Roku Jizπ, because as
a bodhisattva he took the vow to function simultaneously on all six states of
transient existence.
Jizπ is one of the most popular of all Buddhist deities. He often holds the
Desire Banishing Jewel in his left hand, and a staff tipped with rings in his right.
The sound of this staff (still used by priests in many temples) banishes evil and
brings about rejoicing. It also lets his lost charges know he is around. Statues of
Jizπ are often dressed by distressed parents with the red cap and bib that are
emblematic of childhood. Visitors will often pile up stones before a Jizπ to help
in alleviating the children’s penance. Jizπ’s protection is also assured against fire.
Children living in open-hearthed homes (as most Japanese houses were in the
past) were constantly exposed to burning themselves, and thus Jizπ was appealed
to to counter this. As a consequence, he is also associated with Atago-gongen,
deity of protection against fire.
Though principally a gentle saint, his identification with Atago-gongen
means that like many other deities, he has another side: He is also a martial
deity known as Shogun Jizπ (General Jizπ). As such he is a patron of warriors;
most notably, of Shπtoku Taishi and Hachimantarπ.

The sixteen arhat, or Buddhist saints, who by their asceticism are perfect exam
ples of the monastic way of life. The rakan are predecessors or disciples of the
Buddha, openers of the way for the Buddhist Law. They are represented as ema

Binzuru), Ragora-sonja, Ingada-sonja, Chudahandaka-sonja, and others. The
names of others vary from one tradition or temple to another.
The rakan appear, usually, in the iconography of Zen monasteries and tem
ples, where their presence serves as a model to be emulated by the monks and
meditators. The exception, Binzuru, is placed outside the hall, because he broke
either the vow of chastity or of sobriety and is thus not allowed in the august
company.

KAGUTSUCHI-NO-KAMI
Kami of fire. He was the cause of his mother Izanami’s death, burning her geni
tals as he was born. His father, Izanagi, beset by grief for his wife, decapitated the
newborn. From his blood, which dripped off his father’s sword, emerged eight
powerful and violent sword kami, and from his dead body emerged eight deities
of volcanoes and rocks.
Fire was an obvious problem for people who lived in houses made of wood
and straw: a good servant, a terrible master. In Edo, the Tokugawa capital (from
1616; today’s Tokyo), fires were so common they were known as “the flowers of
Edo.” Some scholars argue that the birth of fire, and particularly the emergence
from fire of mountains (volcanoes), iron, and swords, was a metaphor for the
establishment of the new social and material forms generated by Yayoi culture.
The birth of fire marked the end of the creation of the world and the start of
death. Nonetheless, Izanami only accuses fire of being rather capricious and
hard-hearted in causing her death. In the Engishiki, from which the latter part of
the myth comes, she hides herself from Izanagi in her death throes. Then she
bears several children: Mizuhame-no-mikoto (a water kami), the clay princess,
the gourd, and the water reed, instructing them to pacify Kagutsuchi if he
became violent. The water, the gourd to transport it, and wet clay and reeds to
smother fire were traditional fire-fighting equipment. In many places in Japan
today there is a midwinter ritual of placing reed and evergreen bundles in the
eaves to control fires.

KAMADO-GAMI
The stove, or kitchen, kami. Instructions for worshiping this kami were issued
in an imperial rescript mentioned in the Kπjiki. It seems this was an after-the
fact recognition by the imperial court of what amounts to a Little Tradition.
Kamado-gami oversees the activities in the house and may report, perhaps via
the jinushigami, on the activities of members of the household. All these
reports, and the resulting rewards and punishments, are discussed at the Assem
bly of Gods in the tenth (lunar, traditional calendar) month at Izumo.
For individuals (in contrast to the state) the Kamado-gami would have been
all-important. Relics of that importance can be found in Ryukyuan and Ainu cul
186 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ture, where Fii-nu-kang and Kamui Fuchi are the central deities for most activi
ties. In mythology the Kamado-gami would have been far overshadowed by
heroic tales and the activities of the heavenly deities, but that does not detract
from his (or her) central importance for daily life.

KAMI
A spiritual power or deity. The concept, under different names (kamui in Ainu,
kang in Ryukyuan), is pervasive throughout Japanese mythology. At its basis, it
refers to the numinous power that is spread unevenly throughout the world.
Potent, pure, and essentially nonpersonalized, kami may mean power and may
be dissipated or aggregated, according to human (or divine) actions. Pollution
repels kami, whereas purity attracts it. Actions and objects that have this purity
may attract kami or imbue kami on their own.
Personalized deities are called kami as well. The term kami is used as a title
appended to the names of certain deities, thus Amaterasu-π-mikami. The Japan
ese kami tend to be highly personalized, sometimes having distinct and identi
fiable personae and preferences. There are also numerous unnamed and
attributeless deities. The totality of kami is expected to be too numerous to
count and is referred to as yaoyorozu-no-kamigami (the eight million various
kami). Deities associated particularly with the state cult and national Shintπ are
usually carefully defined, named, and provided with ranks and titles. Other kami
(particularly those worshiped exclusively in smaller communities) are far less
carefully delineated.
A similar situation exists for the Ainu kamui. Some, like the hearth goddess
Kamui Fuchi, are carefully delineated, others less well so. The Ainu do not
appear to have a general category such as yaoyorozu-no-kamigami. Ainu kamui
tend to have very specific associations, such as the kamui of the undertow.
The reverse is true for Ryukyuan kang (the term varies between isles and
island clusters in the archipelago). Although kang are viewed in almost all cases
as individual beings, similar in form to humans, they are rarely provided with
particular attributes, dress, or activities to distinguish them. They are, in fact,
rarely well defined, and quite often almost incidental to the rituals Ryukyuans
perform. With some few exceptions, most of which may better be described as
“culture heroes” rather than worshiped deities, they are not associated with
particular myths beyond “they are the ancestors/kang of our group (lineage or
hamlet).”

KAMIKAZE
“Divine wind.” In 1274 and again in 1281, when Japan was invaded by Korean
Mongol fleets, the invading fleets were destroyed by typhoons—the divine
wind—sent by Hachiman, the deity of war whose aid had been appealed to by
the numerically inferior Japanese forces. The divine wind was viewed as the ulti
mate defense of Japan by Shintπ scholars and laity alike. The kamikaze is one of
the three central Japanese myths. (The other two are the myth of imperial
descent from the heavenly kami, and the myth of bushido, particularly as exem
plified by the forty-seven rπnin.)
For the Japanese of the thirteenth century, the threatened Mongol invasion
was, historically and politically, a major watershed. It was the first time the
entire military might of Japan had had to be mobilized for defense of the nation.
Until then, even foreign wars were little more than squabbles that involved one
188 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



or another faction within Japan—essentially domestic affairs. With the Mongol
invasion Japan became exposed to international politics at a personal and
national level as never before. That the Japanese forces won two consecutive vic
tories against numerically and materially superior foes was something most
Japanese appreciated. That the victory was the consequence of almost improba
ble nonhuman factors made it a miracle. In the years between the first and the
second invasion the entire nation became aware—through the distribution of
sutras that were to be read by individuals and in temples, through the preaching
of priests, particularly those like Nichiren who were highly nationalistic—that
some miracle was to be expected. When the miracle actually happened, skeptics
were quickly converted. The idea that the kami or Buddhas were protecting
Japan became a very personal one.
Thus, in the final months of World War II, the name was revived for suicide
pilots and submariners (about four thousand of them actually carried out
attacks) sent out in unsuccessful attempts to stop the U.S. fleet. Once again, the
nation was under severe threat. Once again, the authorities, secular as well as
religious, made very clear that the Japanese were defending themselves against
insurmountable odds. And once again, the only salvation that could be expected
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 189

Corbis)



would come from the only two sources that had demonstrably, in the past, done
such an office: the self-sacrifice and fighting spirit of the Japanese warrior, and
intervention by the kami/Buddhas. Using suicide bombers by air and by sea was
less a technical response to lack of weaponry than an attempt to recreate the
self-sacrifice of the original period of the kamikaze. Japan’s leaders knew the
kamikaze pilots would not stop the American fleets. But they were also part of
the Japanese myth that said, roughly, that if the Japanese warrior would do his
part and sacrifice his life in the doing, then the kami would do theirs. This time,
of course, the myth failed to live up to its billing.
The appearance of the kamikaze is significant in two senses: the construc
tion of pan-Japanese nationalism during the feudal period, and the extension of
the idea of direct relationship between the kami and the imperial household to
all of the Japanese nation. The concept has had its ups and downs and has been
constantly manipulated by the powers-that-be in Japan. Nonetheless, even in
the start of the twenty-first century it is a fundamental idea held to by many
Japanese.

KAMIMUSUBI
The third deity to come into existence at the beginning of the world at Takam
agahara. Kamimusubi is one of the three “single kami,” that is, without a coun
terpart or genitor. However, this deity is later identified as the parent of
Sukunabikona. It also seems from the context, as well as from the actions
ascribed to this deity, that Kamimusubi is female, because in the Nihonshπki
Takamimusubi-no-mikoto (who came into being just before Kamimusubi), a
male deity, is identified as Sukunabikona’s parent as well.
Also known as Kamimusubi-Mioya-no-mikoto (Generative great parent
deity: the “great parent” title is usually accorded to females), Kamimusubi is the
one who took the various foodstuffs born from the murdered food deity, ∏get
suhime, and gave them to humankind. Later she restored ∏kuninushi to life,
after he had been killed for the first time by his brothers. He obviously had a soft
spot for her because she is mentioned in the song that concludes his agreement
with Takemikazuchi-no-kami: Takamagahara is mentioned principally as
her/his abode.
190 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



At a more mundane level it is certainly possible that Kamimusubi may
have been an important deity for the Izumo, as well as for the Yamato. This is
one of the many points of similarity between the two polities that helped in
their amalgamation.

KAMUI
See Kami.
KAMUI FUCHI (AINU)
Hearth deity. One of the most important deities for the Ainu, Kamui Fuchi was
significant in her own right, as well as an access point to the world of the gods.
Her full name is Apemerukoyan-mat Unamerukoyan-mat (Rising Fire Sparks
Woman Rising Cinder Sparks Woman). Together with Shiramba Kamui she is
“owner of the world.” The hearth at the center of each Ainu house was her
abode, and it also served as the gateway through which the kamui and people
could communicate.
In the most common myth, Kamui Fuchi descended from the heavens,
accompanied by Kanna Kamui, kamui of thunder and lightning, in his guise as a
fiery snake. Another tale has it that she was born from an elm tree that had been
impregnated by Kandakoro Kamui (the Prime Originator kamui). In another
myth, she was born of the fire drill, together with her sister Hashinau-uk Kamui,
kamui of the chase.
The hearth, her abode, also serves as the abode of the dead, and ancestors are
actually known as “those-dwelling-in-the-hearth.” Because the Ainu believe in
transmigration, it is the holding place from which new souls are assigned to bod
ies in the act of human procreation. As a consequence, the hearth must be kept
pure; nothing is allowed to contaminate it. At night Kamui Fuchi retires to rest
as the coals are covered with ashes, but the fire itself must never be extin
guished. So important is her position that Kamui Fuchi never leaves her house.
Instead, she deputizes other kamui to act for her in the mundane world. When a
woman gives birth (and there is consequent fear of pollution from blood), a new
fire is laid for the occasion, at the other end of the house, near the birth site, and
another kamui deputizes for the hearth goddess.
Kamui Fuchi was the goddess who instructed Ainu women in the making of
kut (sacred girdles), and for this and other gifts she taught humankind, she is
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 191



styled Iresu Kamui (People Teacher). Among her servants and deputies (since she
cannot leave the hearth) are Mintarakoro Kamui, guardian of the precincts, and
Rukoro Kamui, guardian of the privy. Like other kamui she lives a perfectly
mundane life. In one myth, her husband was seduced away by Waka-ush-Kamui,
deity of the sea. The insulted goddess challenges her rival, and the two women
engage in a sorcerous duel, from which Kamui Fuchi emerges the winner. She
returns to her house, and her shamefaced husband finally returns as well, bear
ing indemnity gifts.
The varied roles of Kamui Fuchi, and most notably her role as guardian of
access to the realm of the kamui, make her one of the most powerful in the Ainu
cosmology. She is, in effect, the major contact point with any domestic ritual.
Unsurprisingly, she is also considered the judge of human domestic affairs:
Those who pollute in her presence, or do not maintain proper relationships
within the household, incur her wrath. In a society heavily dependent on the
benefit of fire and the hearth, fear of her punishment would have been a potent
element of social control. Moreover, though she was served by men, her ties to
women insured some balance between the sexes, at least inasmuch as familial
and household affairs were concerned. Her myths demonstrate the relative inde
pendence and power that women assumed in Ainu society. Her name “Fuchi”
may well have survived into Japanese in the form “Fuji,” thus Mt. Fuji, a live
volcano.

KANDAKORO KAMUI (AINU)
“Possessor of the sky.” Ainu god who is the prime originator. From his abode in
the heavens, he deputized Moshirikara Kamui to prepare the world for the inhab
itation of men. Though a powerful deity, Kandakoro is by no means a supreme
being. His mythical presence is necessary to cause the emergence of the world,
but he plays a very small part in future developments. Instead his role is more of
mediator and general overseer, somewhat like Chikap Kamui, owner of the land
(and, in a sense, the Japanese ∏kuninushi).
Like a great many people unafflicted by capitalism, the Ainu were keenly
aware of the fact that the land could not be “owned.” It could be utilized for a
192 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



period of time, and then passed into someone else’s usufruct. The various
“owner” kamui are, in this sense, an appreciation and understanding of the tem
porary nature of possession against the enduring nature of the land itself: a moral
(and sensibly ecological) imperative to preserve the land.

KANG
See Kami.
KANNON (KANZEON-BOSATSU)
A compassionate boddhisattva, Kannon (Chinese: Guanyin; Sanskrit: Aval
okiteshvara) is often represented as a companion or avatar of Amida Nyπrai, the
Buddha of the Pure Land. One of the most popular representations of the bod
dhisatvas, Kannon represents the essence of compassion. As such, she may serve
as an intermediary to Amida, the Buddha of the Far West. In her original form as
the Indian Buddhist saint Avalokiteshvara, Kannon was a male disciple of the
Buddha. Imported as part of Buddhist theology into China, the Indian male saint
became a female boddhisattva.
Following Chinese belief, she is the compassionate deity of mercy and is
sometimes portrayed as carrying a child, because of her particular mercy for chil
dren and the helpless, though she is not a mother herself.
She is represented in a variety of ways. Among them are J∆ichimen Kannon,
showing her with eleven faces, representing her eternal vigil in assisting people;
Batto Kannon, with a miniature horse head as her hair ornament (In this form
she is the patroness of carters and horse copers, as well as a protector from small
pox); and Niorin, wherein she is portrayed with four arms, one supporting her
cheek, and considered patroness of fishermen. She sometimes carries the wish
granting wheel or the Vase of the Waters of Life, which she sprinkles about her
with a lotus bud. Both of these items have esoteric significance as representing
the Buddhist Law, but for most people it is sufficient that she carries the possi
bility of restoring and continuing life.
The most famous temples of Kannon in Japan are the one in Asakusa, a
working-class district of Tokyo, and the remarkable Sanjusangendπ (33,333
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 193



Kannon, boddhisattva of mercy, sits in contemplation on an island off the coast of
southern India. (Asian Art & Archaeology, Inc./Corbis)



Kannon hall) in Kyoto, a long gallery with tier upon tier of thousand-handed
Kannon. Worshipers, largely women, come to these temples to pray for kinfolk
and children. The number 33 is sacred to Kannon, and she appears in thirty-three
different manifestations. A major pilgrimage route of thirty-three Kannon tem
ples stretches from the Pacific Ocean side of Japan in Kumano, through Kyoto,
to the Japan Sea. There are numerous temples and shrines to Kannon through
out Japan, both in Buddhist and Shintπ form.
Kannon is, unsurprisingly, one of the most beloved figures of Japanese
mythology and belief. She is the representation of pure mercy, and the major
female figure in the mythology. In a sense, she is the epitome of the contradic
tion embedded within Buddhism: the difficulty in reconciling mercy and salva
tion to others with the nature of Buddhahood, which is beyond desire or action.

KAPPA
A water creature reputed to seduce people into rivers or ponds, then drown
them. The kappa has the body of a monkey and a tortoiselike shell covering its
torso. On the top of its head the kappa has a depression that is filled with water.
On land this may be covered by a metal cap. This depression allows the creature
to live on land unless someone causes the kappa to spill the water, whereupon
it becomes helpless. This can be done by tripping it, or by bowing. The kappa is
extremely polite and will always bow back, spilling the fluid and rendering itself
helpless.
Kappa are very licentious, and they attract young women and children to
the water side, whereupon they seize their victims and pull them down to
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 195



drown. They also torment horses, sometimes by eviscerating them through the
anus.
Kappa are experts at aiki-jutsu and other bone-locking and wrestling tech
niques, and are reputed to have taught these skills to humankind: One retainer
of Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s, Rokusuke by name, was reputed to have overcome a
kappa (presumably by the politeness route) and as a consequence became an
unbeatable wrestler. It is this ability that allows kappa to control their victims.
Kappa are also experts at bone setting, and those wishing to practice as bone set
ters and doctors sometimes solicit the kappa’s aid. One way of bribing a kappa
is by offering a cucumber or other cucurbit, of which the creature is reputedly
fond. Kappa are often portrayed riding on a cucumber or a squash, and a type of
rolled sushi with a cucumber inside is called a kappa-maki.
Some authors suggest that kappa represent in conventional form some of
the tragedies of human life in preindustrial Japan—babies that have been aborted
or killed as a means of population control, and possibly the mothers of unwanted
children who have drowned themselves in grief. This supposition is strength
ened by the kappa’s appearance: babyish and thin, the water-depression perhaps
representing the infant’s fontanel. References and further reading:

KASUGA DAIMY  ̄OJIN
The “Great bright deity of Kasuga”: a syncretic deity and the protector of the
Nara temple and shrine complex. The Kashima Daimyπjin is syncretic in two
ways: The deity is a composite of five deities, and each of the five deities is a pair
of Shintπ kami and Buddhist deity. The main deity is Takemikazuchi, the thun
der kami, who is seen as a gongen of Fukukensaku Kannon. The others are Fut
sunushi-no-mikoto (Yakushi Nyπrai), Amenokoyane (Jizπ), Himegami (J∆ichimen
Kannon), and Ame-no-oshikumone-no-mikoto (Monju-bosatsu).
Originally supported by the Fujiwara family, who virtually ran Japan as they
controlled the emperor, the Kasuga Daimyπjin was promoted as a protector of
the area of what had become Yamato province (the area of Nara and the new cap
ital, Heian).
The importance of the Kasuga deity is that such “combined” deities were to
become a major model for all Japanese deities to some extent or other, where
deities are combined, almost indifferently, according to political, economic, and
social exigency, in popular belief and worship.

KAWA-NO-KAMI
God of rivers. Larger rivers have their own gods, but all waterways are under
Kawa-no-kami’s authority. When rivers flooded in archaic times, the gods were
sometimes appeased with human sacrifices. The introduction of Buddhism
meant the end of this practice. Instead, dolls made of straw or flowers were sub
stituted and offered to the Kawa-no-kami. This custom is still extant today in
some areas of Japan.

KENASH UNARABE (AINU)
A blood-sucking female monster dwelling in swamps. Kenash Unarabe will
often assume the guise of Hash-uk Kamui, deity of the hunt, to lure hunters
away and lead them through the swamps until they tire, whereupon she drinks
their blood. She will conceal her face with long tresses, by which she may be
distinguished from Hash-uk Kamui. Kenash Unarabe, together with a variety of
diseases and poisonous and unhealthy waters, emerged from the decomposing
remains of the tools the gods used in their making of the earth.
Kenash Unarabe’s fondness for blood makes her, paradoxically, important to
the Ainu. She is invoked during rituals for a birthing mother, and for menstru
ating women, to come and remove the pollution, her reward being drinking the
flowing blood. For Ainu as for many other people, blood was an important and
powerful mystical element. This is particularly true of the polluting aspect of
childbirth and menstruation. Unsurprisingly, as in this case, very powerful
mythical figures are invoked in order to deal with the pollution. Kenash
Unarabe’s origin in association with polluting and diseased matter means that
invoking her addresses these problems with a very powerful counterforce, but
one that is potentially malevolent, uncontrollable, uncertain, and therefore
threatening.

KIM-UN KAMUI (AINU)
The bear god. Also known as Metotush Kamui and as Nuparikor Kamui (Moun
tain God). An Ainu myth recounts how one day a beautiful young woman went
with her baby on her back to collect forest bulbs. While washing them in a river,
she started singing a song, and her sweet voice attracted a bear. Frightened, she
abandoned her baby and her clothes and ran away. The bear was disappointed
that the beautiful singer had stopped her music, but, investigating the pile of
clothes, found the baby. He cared for the baby for several days, feeding it from
his saliva, which he dropped into the baby’s mouth.
The men of the village came to the place, and discovered the baby alive and
healthy. They were immediately convinced that the bear was Kim-un Kamui,
followed its tracks, and shot it dead. They then arranged a feast of the bear’s
meat, raised the bear’s head on a stand offering it wine and inau, and by doing
so, freed its ramat to return to heaven.
One day the bear god went to visit a friend, leaving his beloved wife and
their baby behind. He lost track of time until the crow came to tell him that his
wife had gone down to the village of the humans and had not returned. The bear
rushed to his house and, picking up the little one, followed his wife. The fox
tried to ensorcel him, and two men shot arrows at him, but he continued on his
way unharmed. He followed the men to the village, where he was greeted by
Kamui Paseguru (the aconite poison goddess), who invited him to come and visit
Kamui Fuchi, the hearth goddess. While they were speaking thus, the fox con
tinued his enscorcellment. Kamui Paseguru then leapt upon Kim-un Kamui, and
he lost consciousness. When he awoke he was high in the branches of a tree.
Below him lay the body of an old bear, and a young cub played nearby. The men
returned and captured the bear cub. They then worshiped the dead bear, putting
up inau, who protected the meat from predators and demons. The meat was
taken down to the village, where the bear god was offered wine, inau, and
dumplings made of millet. He also found his wife sitting by the hearth. They
feasted for several days with Kamui Fuchi, the hearth goddess, then went back
to their home laden with gifts. They threw a feast for the other kamui, and
when their young cub later came back, also laden with gifts of wine and inau,
another feast.
Bears were not necessarily so benevolent, and another kamui yukar tells of
how a bear maiden of evil disposition (an ararush) went down to a human vil
lage and killed a woman. Chastised by Kamui Fuchi, she restored the woman to
life. She was then entertained by the villagers, and, leaving her earthly covering,
returned to the land of the kamui bearing the usual gifts of wine and inau, and
told her kinfolk of human generosity. The humans feasted on her discarded
mundane form.
198 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The bear is a significant figure in Ainu mythology and is the focus of a major
cult and ritual. Villages that could do so would, in traditional times, capture a
bear cub alive. It was fed and treated almost as a family member for a year, and
then, during the bear ceremony, was shot to death with arrows. Its skull was
added to the skull repository, and its flesh was eaten to free its ramat (spirit) to
return to Kim-un Kamui’s home in the sky. For the Ainu, killing and eating the
bear was not an act of ingratitude or cruelty: Rather, they were releasing the bear
spirit to return to its natural place, bearing tales of their piety and good manners.
The central ritual of Ainu life—the raising, then killing of a bear cub—was
explained in this myth as an act of the reciprocal relationship between the
kamui and humans.

KINASHUT KAMUI (AINU)
The snake deity. Generally friendly and helpful to humans, he controls the worst
behavior of snakes. Snake spirits trouble people with eye disease, paralysis, and
other ills, and Kinashut Kamui, if appealed to, is able to evict these evil spirits
from their victim. Kinashut Kamui is the brother of Nusakoro Kamui (though
they are sometimes regarded as one). He protects communities against other
evils, most notably typhoid.

KINTOKI (ALSO KINTAR  ̄O)
A giant hero, one of the four Shi Tenno who were Raikπ’s (Minamoto-no-Yorim
itsu’s) retainers and loyal attendants. His name means “Golden boy” due to the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 199



brilliant red color of his skin. He was born (or fostered) to a yama-uba at Mt.
Ashigeru. He grew up wrestling with, beating, and making friends with the wild
animals and tengu. His inseparable tools were his masakari (broad ax) and his
giant saké bowl. He participated in Raikπ’s adventures until the latter’s death,
then returned to wander, wild and naked, on Mt. Ashigeru. His saké bowl and ax
perhaps indicate his origin as a wild being, possessor of the elixir of life embod
ied in saké.
Kintarπ is one of the most endearing figures in Japanese mythology. His pic
ture, usually in the form of a prepubescent child wearing only a chest protector
(a sort of apron Japanese children wore instead of clothes in premodern times)
and frequently accompanied by a bear, can be found on saké bottles, insurance
companies’ logos, toys, and almost everywhere else. In the very rigid atmosphere
of Japanese society he represented for most Japanese the freedom and strength to
be oneself, even in the extremes of drunkenness. In the most common image he
is portrayed uprooting a tree so that he and his companion—a bear he had wres
tled into submission—could cross a gorge on their way to his home.

KISHIM  ̄OJIN
One of the most popular of Buddhist deities, she is the protector of infants. Orig
inally an Indian demon named Häriti, she sustained her five hundred offspring
with the bodies of children she caught. The Buddha trapped her youngest and
favorite offspring under his begging bowl. He relented when she promised to
abandon her anthropophagous practices, whereupon, regretting her previous
existence, she devoted herself to the protection of infants. In return, the Buddha
promised that offerings would be made for her sustenance in all his monasteries.
In an alternative telling of the myth, she and her assistant rakasha (demons)
reported to the Buddha and expressed their desire to protect all infants born
under the Law.
Kishimπjin is represented as a woman carrying an infant in one arm. In her
other hand she holds a branch and fruit of the pomegranate: a fruit that because
of its many seeds represents fecundity in the Asian mainland as it does in
Europe. The blood-red seeds of the pomegranate are said in Japan to represent the
human flesh Kishimπjin used to consume as an ogress. As a consequence, many
Japanese will refuse to eat pomegranates because they say the fruit tastes of
200 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



human flesh. The image of Kishimπjin with the infant in her hands is similar to
the image of Kannon in a like stance, and thus, perhaps, the idea of both of them
as patronesses of childbirth took over, in Japanese Buddhist thinking, from the
image of Koyasu-gami, the deity of childbirth, who is identified with Kπnπ
hanasakuya-hime.

K  ̄OB  ̄O DAISHI
Saint, miracle worker, and founder of the Shingon Buddhist sect. To Kπbπ Daishi
are attributed a vast array of miracles and wonders. He established the worship
of Konpira-daigongen in Kompira-san on Shikoku Island and founded the temple
complex on Kπya-san. The facts of his life are dramatic enough, even without
the mythical dimension.
Born in 774 in Shikoku to a family that had been exiled from Heian, the cap
ital, he assumed the name Kukai as a Buddhist priest. He died in 835, after pre
dicting the day of his death and painting in the eyes of his own portrait. He was
posthumously given the name Kπbπ Daishi (Great teacher of spreading the law),
a special title, in 921 by the imperial court.
His brilliance as a child was such that he was soon ordained as a monk,
assuming the name Kukai (air-sea), and sent to the capital to study. There he was
selected to accompany one of the infrequent, tedious, long, and dangerous impe
rial missions to China. Of the fleet of three ships, only two made it. The one
bearing the ambassador and Kukai lost its way and was sequestered by a suspi
cious regional Chinese governor. Kukai’s eloquence won the governor over, and
the mission was sent on to Xian, the capital. The young priest dipped into many
forms of Buddhism, finally settling on the Quen-yen esoteric form, to be known
in Japan as Shingon. The patriarch Hui-ko of the Chinese Quen-yen sect declared
the young Japanese to be his chosen successor and ordered him to return to Japan
to spread the true word. He returned to Japan but was unable to expound his the
ories because of political events at the capital, Heian-kyπ. Eventually he estab
lished the headquarters of the Shingon sect in Heian, moving the main temple
and monasteries to Mt. Kπya. He established Japan’s longest and most famous
pilgrimage route, the eighty-eight temple circuit of Shikoku (about one thousand
miles in length).
Kπbπ Daishi is credited with one of the greatest Japanese inventions of all:
the kana syllabaries. Each of the two sets (hiragana used for verb endings and
grammatical particles; katakana used for foreign words, but originally intended
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 201



to allow women to write) has forty-seven symbols. There are also two modifying
marks that allow hardening a consonant. He wrote the syllables down in the form
of a poem, called “Iroha,” in which each of the syllables appears, but only once:
I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to
Chi-ri-nu-ru-wo
Wa-ka-yo-ta-re-so
Tsu-ne-na-ra-mu
U-(w)i-no-o-ku-ya-ma
Ke-fu-ko-e-te
A-sa-ki-yu-me-mi-shi
(W)e-hi-mo-se-su-n
(Colors are fragrant
But they fade away.
In this world of ours none lasts forever.
Today cross the high mountain of life’s illusions,
And there will be no more shallow dreaming,
No more drunkenness. [Nelson 1974])
(Note: wi and we are no longer used in modern Japanese.)
The miraculous life of the Daishi started while he was still a boy. A loner
and mystic since childhood, he soon was the subject of his first miracle. At the
age of seven, the boy who was to become Kπbπ Daishi climbed a mountain near
his home. Reaching the peak, he threw himself off, crying, “If I am destined to
serve the Law, let me be saved, otherwise let me die.” A company of arhats then
appeared and brought the boy safely to the ground. Later, when he assumed his
priestly name Kukai, the morning star flew into his mouth as he was doing aus
terities, proclaiming him a saint.
The Daishi was, among other talents, a sculptor of note. He has carved stat
ues of the boddhisattva Kokuzπ (his special patron) and Shakyamuni into living
trees, which can still be seen today. In one case he used a sick farmer’s sickle to
carve an image of himself, and so cured the man. In another, he carved a statue
of Yakushi out of a living trunk using nothing but his fingernails. He is said to
have carved a special statue in three of the four ancient provinces of Shikoku
(Awa, Iyo, Tosa), where the eighty-eight-stage pilgrimage associated with his
name and his birthplace are located. The fourth province, Sanuki, did not bene
fit from a statue because the pilgrimage path through it was easy, and its gov
ernment was welcoming to pilgrims: Presumably, a statue was not required to
keep an eye on them. Two of those statues (the one in Iyo, and the one in Tosa)
still exist, whereas the Awa statue has been lost.
202 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



While still searching for his way in life, he came upon a young woman who,
while living in a mountain hut, wove cloth for her living. She gave him some
cloth and told him that she was the daughter of a court official who had had to
flee the capital because of involvement in a plot. Kannon had appeared to her
mother in a dream and warned her of imminent arrest, and the pregnant woman
had escaped to the mountains, where she gave birth to the baby girl. Moved by
the story, the saint started carving a statue of Kannon-bosatsu. When the statue
was finished, a cloud descended and the girl was revealed as Kannon-bosatsu her
self. Kπbπ Daishi installed the statue he had carved on the summit and built a
temple: Kirihata-ji (Cut-cloth temple), which is there to this day.
The Daishi, as he is known, accompanies every pilgrim on the pilgrimage
route he established around the island of Shikoku. Women on pilgrimage are
under the Daishi’s protection, and in numerous myths, he intervenes to help
women deliver safely. He also cares for children born on pilgrimage, supplying
their needs if necessary if their parents die.
The Daishi’s care extends to the pilgrims’ material needs as well. There are
still a number of places in Japan, on the pilgrimage route and off, where the
Daishi brought forth good water for the people to drink. While walking in Awa
the saint was thirsty and could find no stream. Eventually he smelled a wonder
ful fragrance. He prayed, and pure fresh water welled up from the bottom of the
earth and filled a handy depression. In the depression he saw a wonderful bright
rock, which he carved into a statue of Yakushi. It became too dark to work, so
the moon obliged and the night became as day with the moonlight until the
saint had finished his carving.
As did most miracle workers, Kπbπ Daishi dispelled demons and pests wher
ever he went. Some of his exorcisms repeated and strengthened those performed
by En-no-Gyπja a century before the Daishi. There are no foxes on Shikoku, and
people there are immune to fox magic. That is because the Daishi expelled all
the foxes for their tricks, which he feared would distract the pilgrims. While
traveling in the mountains of Shikoku, near the pilgrimage route he later estab
lished, the Daishi came to a valley that was being ravaged by a fiery snake. The
snake had been subdued a century earlier by En-no-Gyπja, but had since revived.
The saint called on his patron, the boddhisattva Kokuzπ, who bound the snake
firmly and extinguished its fire for all time. At another time, the Daishi came to
Muroto, a cape jutting out of Shikoku Island, which is, among other things, a set
ting off point for explorers searching for the route to the fabulous land of
Tokoyo-no-kuni. He found the people of the place plagued by demons who lived
in a huge camphor tree on top of the mountain. The saint abolished these mon
sters and carved his own image on the trunk of the tree. Eventually, when he
returned from China, he returned to Cape Muroto, cut down the tree, and used
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 203



the wood to build a monastery, one of those on the pilgrimage route. The statue
is still kept there, shown only once a year on the saint’s death day.
Several of the miracles performed by the Daishi relate to fish. At the place
that was to become a large pilgrimage site, the saint met a merchant leading a
pack horse loaded with dried and salted mackerel. The saint asked for a fish, but
the merchant refused. After a while, the merchant’s pack horse suddenly stum
bled and fell ill. The man, having heard that a holy man was on pilgrimage in the
area, ran back and begged the Daishi for help. The saint gave the man his beg
ging bowl and bade him fill it with seawater. Uttering a spell, the saint had the
man give the water to his horse, which recovered at once. The amazed merchant
offered the saint a fish. The saint took the fish, waded into the sea, and, after a
prayer, loosed the salted fish into the waters. The revived animal promptly
swam away. The merchant then became a monk and built a chapel, which
became known as Saba Daishi (Mackerel Daishi).
A similar myth is told around Mt. Koya. A woman was roasting small ayu
(sweetfish) on skewers over a fire. The saint begged for one. He carefully took it
off the spit, put it in the water, murmured a prayer, and the fish swam away. To
this day the fish in the river that flows by Mt. Koya have three small spots on
their head and body: the mark of the skewer. Another time he was crossing a
riverbed when the sharp shell of a river clam cut his foot. He touched the offend
ing clam with his staff, and since then, the shellfish in that river have smooth
shells.
When the Daishi’s days were numbered, he could see his death day clearly.
One of his disciples, an imperial prince, painted the saint’s portrait. The Daishi
admired the portrait, then painted in one final detail: the eyes. The following day
his body was still. His disciples placed him in a tomb on Mt. Koya. Some time
later, the emperor had a dream in which the saint requested a new robe: As the
Daishi personally accompanied each pilgrim who walked the eighty-eight stations
of the pilgrimage on Shikoku, his own had become quite tattered. The emperor
hastily dispatched an official to Mt. Koya. The tomb was opened in the presence
of the abbot. The saint appeared wreathed in mist and smoke. The official and the
abbot were the only ones who could see the saint clearly, but an acolyte, whose
hand had been placed on the saint’s knee, was left with a sweet-smelling hand for
the rest of his life. The Daishi was barbered and dressed in the new robe by the
abbot. He then informed the emperor that he had taken a vow not to die but to
await the coming of Miroku, the future Buddha, and gave signs from which it was
possible to calculate that Miroku would arrive 5,670,000,300 years into the future.
The three hundred represented the years since the saint’s death.
The case of Kπbπ Daishi illustrates how myth in Japan ties together the
world of the divine and of the mundane. That Kπbπ Daishi lived as a real man is
204 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



beyond dispute. From material evidence that still exists, it is also clear that he
was an exceptional man: gifted artist, architect (he laid out the Shingon head
quarters on Mt. Kπya), scholar, and consummate politician. The variety and
extent of myths about him are elaborations of his actual deeds, and quite often
the activities of other Buddhist figures in areas such as Yoshino (where Mt. Kπya
is located) and Shikoku are attributed to him.
In effect the mythologization of the Daishi is a morality tale, Buddhist style:
from a relatively humble beginning, he achieved greatness, even divinity, by
constant and unremitting endeavor. He ties together a large number of different
threads that are significant for Japanese culture. Three are notable in this vol
ume. First is the theme, already mentioned above, of the transformation of a
common man into divinity. The Buddhas, says the myth, are concerned. They
do help the common man, and the common man can become a Buddha himself.
The second theme is the (Shintπ) theme of the unity of the Japanese nation. The
Daishi is an inhabitant of both common people’s houses and those of emperors
and aristocrats. He associates with them all on the basis of personal relationship,
unmediated by ritual or pomp. A third theme is the theme of art, or perhaps
more accurately, style. Shingon recognizes that Buddhahood can be attained
through art. For the Daishi, doing things elegantly was as much a way of attain
ing enlightenment as following any precept: Aesthetics is close to godliness. It
is, in fact, godliness.
The influence and fame of the Daishi are so great that even the miracles
associated with other holy figures are generally attributed to him. For example,
the myth about Saba Daishi was originally attributed to another saintly figure:
Gyπgi. Even the invention of the syllabary attributed to the Daishi may not be
historically accurate. Nonetheless, he is such a towering cultural figure that he
overshadows everyone else in Japanese thought.

KOJAKU MY  ̄O-  ̄O
The peacock king. One of the four divine kings protecting the sacred Buddhist
Mt. Meru from each of the sides, Kojaku rides a peacock, emblematic of fire and
the sun, and opposed to water. Snakes, sometimes identified with dragons, are
emblematic of water, but also of poison. Thus Kojaku is the protector against
poison and other things that menace the body or the spirit. For that purpose,

Kojaku (or the peacock) can provide a spell against poison. Kojaku may be repre
sented with several arms. In one hand he carries a peacock feather, in another a
stem of millet indicating fecundity. Other hands may carry a lotus blossom (the
foundations of the Buddhist Law) and a fruit of good fortune.

KOKKA SHINT  ̄O
National Shintπ was a government attempt during the Meiji, Taishπ, and early
Shπwa periods (1868–1945) to establish Shintπ as the driving ideology and reli
gion of the Japanese state. The roots of this ideology lay in the Mito school of
National Learning, an eighteenth-century reaction to the Buddha-ization of the
Tokugawa shogunate. In National Learning thought, Japan was the land of the
kami, and the Japanese people were members of an all-encompassing dπzoku
whose “main house” was that of Amaterasu-π-mikami, and her heir and repre
sentative on Earth, the Japanese emperor.
In 1873 the Meiji government of the time dictated the separation of Bud
dhist and Shintπ places of worship. Deities that had been worshiped in dual
forms (Ryπbu) as Buddhist and Shintπ deities were now required to be worshiped
separately. Over a period of several decades, Shintπ shrines were “rational
ized”—assigned rank and income—within a comprehensive state system. Shintπ
priests were trained and forbidden to use Buddhist forms of ritual. And a system
that placed the emperor as a divinity was established formally, along with a
process of ranking all kami.
Aspects of Kokka Shintπ were opposed or supported in varying degrees in
different parts of the country. The general rankings of kami that have emerged
today are often the result of the Kokka Shintπ system, which was abolished as
a branch of government with the Allied Occupation’s Shintπ Directive of
1945.
Kokka Shintπ is an extreme case of the adoption of a series of myths, told
by different voices at different periods, into a unified, formalized, official creed.
It sustained the Japanese government through several decades, and the “official”
mythology it espoused was at the basis of much of the behavior and actions of
the Japanese in the decades leading up to and during World War II. One of the
206 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



benefits conveyed by the Occupation period was the decoupling of government
from religion in the Shintπ Directive of 1945. From our point of view, the bene
fit is the freeing of Japanese myth-making from the shackles of formal govern
ment approval, allowing the existence and recreation of multiple myth versions
and a multitude of different myth styles and voices.

KOK  ̄UZ  ̄O-BOSATSU
The boddhisattva of space and of potential. He carries the magical jewel of exis
tence, and in his right hand, a sword of happiness, which represents the bounty
of the heavens. Sometimes his right hand is portrayed as being in the position
signifying giving. Kok∆zπ dispenses good luck and wisdom to the body and to
the spirit. Invoking his name, one can be assured of the preservation and reten
tion of memory, and thus he is also the boddhisattva of ascetic practice, where
long repetitive formulae need to be repeated again and again. By repeating his
name, one can retain the entire corpus of the Buddhist Law. Children aged thir
teen appeal to Kok∆zπ for intelligence, and they may receive talismans on April
13 (the day dedicated to Kok∆zπ) to enhance their intelligence. In his association
with the bounty of heaven, Kok∆zπ is represented by the rain, and by a dragon
who brings rain. He is also associated with the planet Venus, which is his celes
tial manifestation. He was the protective patron of Kπbπ Daishi, the founder of
Shingon and Japan’s foremost Buddhist saint.

KOMA-INU
“Korean dogs.” They protect most shrine and many temple entrances from the
entrance of evil. One male and one female sit on either side of the entrance.
They originate from similar lion figures in China, and probably have even earlier
antecedents in India. In their protective function they serve for Shintπ shrines a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 207



Guardian koma-inu from a shrine (Courtesy of the author)



similar function to that of the Ni-π guardians at the entrance to Buddhist tem
ples. The Chinese originals were fanciful renditions of Indian traditions of an
animal that did not exist in China. The Japanese copies of these, with even less
familiarity with the zoological original, were even more fanciful and subse
quently labeled “dogs.” Because the idea was transmitted from China via Korea,
they became Korean dogs.
In most cases, the pair, representing a male (his mouth is open, and he emits
the primal first sound, yo [Sansk. om]) and a female (her mouth is closed, and she
emits the final sound, in [Sansk. hum]) also represent Chinese ideas of the com
plementarity and opposition between yang (male) and yin (female) universal
principles. The female is often accompanied by her cubs.
These two guardians, with their semicomical pop-eyed expressions, are
often confused with Kara-shishi, the lion of the lion dance and a favorite image
of later (Edo-period) art. The koma inu, like the shishi, are reputed to be fierce
in protecting their young with absolute devotion, and are thus appropriate
guardians for shrines.

KONG  ̄O
The diamond weapon. It represents the Taizπkyπ (Diamond Sutra), one of the
main sutras of Buddhism, the sagacity of which pierces all evil. A great many
Buddhist deities carry the kongπ. It is usually shaped in the form of a short han
dle with rectangular or hexagonal spikes like chisels sticking out of either end.
Those can have one, three, or five prongs. It is used as a symbolic implement,
made of bronze, in Tendai and Shingon rituals.
The kongπ brings together three elements of esoteric and exoteric Bud
dhism, as it represents thunder, diamond, and a weapon all at once. In esoteric
Buddhism—Shingon and Zen—the possibility of sudden illumination was a
main feature. The power of the Buddhist Law to pierce, suddenly and forcefully,
through ignorance and illusions was a crucial concept, repeated often in iconog
raphy, and therefore attached regularly to the character of numerous deities.
Thunder/lightning also stood for pure, immutable truth that could not be
obscured, and was thus represented by diamond, the hardest substance known,
brilliant with an inner light, and having manifold reflections, just as the Bud
dha is reflected in all creatures. Many Buddhist thinkers and sects conceived of
themselves as fighting an unending battle against ignorance, illusion, and
death. The kongπ in this guise is the perfect weapon that illuminates and shat
ters illusions.

K  ̄ON  ̄OHANASAKUYA-HIME
Daughter of Oyamatsumi-no-kami, a mountain deity; also Ninigi-no-mikoto’s
wife, and mother to the quarreling deities Hoderi and Ho-ori. Oyamatsumi gave
his two daughters, Iwanaga-hime (Long-rock princess—also a play on “long life”)
and Kπnπhanasakuya-hime (Flower-blossom princess) as wives to Ninigi-no
mikoto after he descended to earth at Himuka. Ninigi returned the older sister,
claiming she was ugly. Her ashamed father said, “I gave my two daughters to the
divine grandson to ensure his life would last as long as the rocks, and as flour
ishing as the blossoms of the trees. He has rejected Long-rock princess, and
therefore his prosperity and life shall be as evanescent as the blossoming of the
trees.” From that day on, says the Kπjiki’s author, emperors’ lives have been
short-lived.
Kπnπhanasakuya-hime became pregnant after only one night with her new
husband. The suspicious heavenly grandson accused her of infidelity with one of
the earth deities, for, after all, how she could have become pregnant after only
one night of marriage? Incensed, she set fire to the parturition house, from which
she and the baby Hoderi-no-mikoto emerged unscathed. In consequence, she is
also identified with Koyasu-gami, the kami of easy childbirth (Ko-yasu can also
be read as “Child-easy”), who in Buddhism was identified with Kishimπjin,
because she gave birth safely in the middle of flames and adversity.
Blood, like death, was a major pollutant to the Japanese. In archaic times, a
woman would give birth in a special menstruation hut (not an uncommon fea
ture of many simple societies), which would be torn down or burnt after the
birth, so as not to pollute the home. A similar house would be built in case of
expected death, and for the funeral obsequies, as the story of Amenowakahiko’s
funeral shows. Kπnπhanasakuya-hime proved her innocence by burning down
the parturition house while she was still inside. In doing so, she also became
patroness of easy childbirth.
The legend of Kπnπhanasakuya-hime and her husband and sons is a signifi
cant one because it marks the nexus of a number of themes. Most significantly,
it marks the passage of heavenly descent from deities to mortals (albeit heroic
ones). In marrying an earthly deity, the heavenly grandson was assuming some
of the qualities of mortals, and, indeed, becoming mortal himself. For the writ
210 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ers of the early compendia and their audiences, this was a necessary step in
explaining the mortality of the emperors and the imperial line, who were divine
by descent but, nonetheless, subject to mortal frailty, as much of the later parts
of both Kπjiki and Nihonshπki attest. Emperors (and thus the commonality as
well) die because of a fatal choice made by Ninigi-no-mikoto, the link between
the heavenly deities and the imperial line. Death had been introduced earlier, by
Izanami, but Ninigi’s choice explains why all men, even those who are divini
ties like the heavenly grandson’s descendants, would die in time. The exploits of
Kπnπhanasakuya-hime’s sons continue this theme, as the boundaries between
men, however heroic, and the kami are defined and structured.
Kπnπhanasakuya-hime is worshiped as the deity of Mt. Fuji, often under her
Buddhist-derived name, Sengen.

KONPIRA-DAIGONGEN
The guardian deity of the Inland Sea (between Shikoku, Kyushu, and Honshu).
Thus he is patron of navigators, of fishermen, and of trade, which were impor
tant for the region. He is also known as Zπsusan (Standing on an elephant’s head,
for the shape of the mountain on which his main shrine, Kotohira-gu, stands)
and Konpira-ry∆-π (Konpira king of dragons). In Shintπ, Konpira has been known
as Kotohira since the Meiji restoration. He is one thousand shaku (feet) long and
has a thousand heads and a thousand arms.
Konpira is one of the major protective deities, and the complex of shrines
and temples on Konpira-san, in modern Kagawa (northern Shikoku), is a major
pilgrimage site established by Kπbπ Daishi.

KOTANKOR KAMUI (AINU)
The Ainu land, or domain (kotan), deity. He is also called Chikap Kamui (owl
deity) because he is represented as a great owl. The owl was considered to be the
watcher, or master, of the local domain. He ensured that proper rituals were
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 211



carried out and that, in general, humans and kamui behaved themselves in his
domain.
Famine struck the land, and wishing to send a message to heaven to inquire
about the cause, Kotankor Kamui asked Crow to be a messenger. The instruc
tions and message he gave were rather lengthy. On the third day of the recita
tion, Crow dozed off, and Kotankor Kamui killed him in anger. Once again the
deity asked for a messenger, and this time the Mountain Jay responded. On the
fourth day of the recitation, the new messenger dozed off and was killed in turn.

nights to the message, then flew off to the heavens.

deity had stopped sending their gifts to humans because the humans had become
contemptuous of the gifts received, and did not treat them properly. Kotankor
Kamui then taught the humans how to kill fish properly with a fish maul, and,
after killing a deer, how to offer their heads some inau. The fish and the deer
(spirits) therefore come home rejoicing, and the humans do not fear famine.
Kotankor Kamui was considered a dispenser of wealth and success, and in
some areas his eyes were said to drop tears of gold or silver.
The hondo crow (Corvinus coronoides) and the mountain jay were despised
by the Ainu. The Siberian dipper (Cinculus palasii) on the other hand was con
sidered a harbinger of good fortune. This myth both serves as an explanatory
myth for the relationship with these animals and reemphasizes to the Ainu lis
teners the importance of making proper offerings, and of the proper ritual behav
ior that, because of the uncertainties of their lives, tried to ensure their survival.

KOTOSHIRONUSHI-NO-KAMI
Son of ∏kuninushi, he is a kami of oracular pronouncements. His full name,
Yahe-Kotoshironushi, means something like “Eightfold-word master,” indicat
ing that his pronouncements were valuable and penetratingly deep. He coun
seled his father to submit to the rule of the heavenly deities. He is invoked for
oracular pronouncements in some shrines to this day.
When the heavenly deities sent Takemikazuchi-no-kami to pave the way for
the arrival of the heavenly grandson, he accosted ∏kuninushi with the heavenly
deities’ demands. The earthly kami wished to consult with his two sons. Koto
shironushi agreed to submit to the heavenly deities. However, he clapped his
hands magically, caused a green thicket to grow, and became a “hidden” kami.
212 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



His withdrawal was not total, however, because his father insisted that he
become “vanguard and rearguard” to the heavenly kami. In view of his name,
this presumably meant that like the scarecrow deity Kuyebiko, the oracular
Hitokotonushi, and others, he was an oracular deity whose pronouncements
could direct even the paths of the heavenly deities. However, as a hidden kami
he no longer took part in the activities of the world, reserving his intervention
to the provision of divinatory utterances.

who was the father of two princesses who married the descendants of Susano-wo

are otherwise hidden or passive in heavenly and earthly affairs.

MAREBITO
Visiting deities. Mysterious visitors, often from across the seas or deep in the
mountains, are a staple of many Japanese local myths. These strangers, if treated
kindly, fed, and entertained, are likely to emerge as donors of important founda
tion gifts. Sukunabikona, the dwarf kami who assisted in the creation of the
land, is one such marebito. Another is Ebisu, who in his personification as
patron of fishermen is worshiped as a visiting deity. The ancestors who return to
visit the household during the bon season in midsummer are marebito as well.
In all cases, great importance is to be placed on treating these powerful beings
with respect, offering them food, and, after they have visited for a while, send
ing them back to their original homes across the sea or in the mountains.
The idea of visiting deities is a reflection of the lives the peasantry led
throughout much of Japan’s history and prehistory. Isolated by mountain barri
ers in small, steep river valleys, many farmers and other producers had little, if
any, contact with the outside world. Outside visitors were therefore regarded
with a mixture of suspicion (an outsider could be a threat, a robber, or a tax gath
erer) mingled with respect (outsiders were often powerful and dangerous) and a
touch of hope (visiting doctors and kebozu were often the only providers of
news, medicine, and emotional palliatives). Moreover, for the peasants the
changes of seasons were personalized in the form of the complementary Ta-no
kami/Yama-no-kami deities. The Ta-no-kami’s visits in the spring were
solicited and eased because it was the Ta-no-kami who provided food in the
fields. It was thus crucial to maintain an attitude of correctness in dealing with
strangers who might be tempted otherwise to harm one.
The myth of the visiting stranger with hidden powers emerges in the twen
tieth century as well. One of the longest-running television series in Japan has
been Mito Komon, which tells the story of a retired elderly daimyπ (lord) who
travels incognito throughout Japan in the eighteenth century, dispensing jus
tice, rewards, and punishments. Japan’s dealings with foreigners can be viewed
as an extension of the marebito myth. Foreign specialists in nineteenth-century
Japan were brought to dispense gifts—western science and technology—and
after having been feasted and laden with gifts, were sent back to their home
land. Until a decade ago, many Japanese would have been horrified at the idea
of foreigners settling permanently in Japan. Many corporations now practice the
marabito myth in similar ways, bringing in specialists for brief periods of time,
feasting them royally, then sending them back home after extracting gifts of
information and knowledge. Whether this is a conscious use of the marebito
214 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



myth or an unconscious echoing of a traditional cultural practice is difficult to
determine.

MARISHI-TEN
One of the seven sages who have been placed into the sky as the stars of the
Great Dipper. Marishi-ten himself is the embodiment of the rays of light that
precede the sunrise, in other words, the harbinger of Dainichi Nyπrai. Marishi
ten, who is sometimes portrayed as male, sometimes as female, is also a patron
of warriors. S/he is portrayed riding on a wild boar, and sometimes is portrayed
as having three heads, one of them a pig’s face. The wild boar represents auda
cious advance without fear, a desirable quality for a warrior. Marishi-ten is
armored, has six hands, and is armed with a sword, trident, and bow and arrow.
In particular s/he is patron god of archers. The grave of the forty-seven rπnin of
the Ch∆shingura in Sengaku-ji temple in Tokyo is watched over by a figure of
Marishi-ten. S/he was originally the Hindu warrior-god Indra, becoming a Bud
dhist figure of protection soon after the emergence of Buddhism as an organized
religion.

MIROKU-BOSATSU
The boddhisattva of the future (Sanskrit: Maitreya). The future Buddha is to rise
as the savior once the time is ripe. In this view, Shakyamuni, the historical Bud
dha, was one of a long chain of Buddhas extending through past ages. Having
brought the way of enlightenment to humankind, he departed to his own nir
vana. In some Buddhist schools, however, this posed a problem of salvation in
later ages. The coming of the boddhisattva Miroku solves this problem by
promising the possibility of salvation in the future. The figure of Miroku in
Japanese thought is close to that of a messiah in European thought, promising
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 215



the possibility of salvation in this world, as opposed, for example, to Amida, who
promises salvation in the Pure Land in the afterlife.
Miroku is popularly associated with the figure of Hπtei, one of the Shichi
Fukujin. He is thus represented as an obese laughing monk with pendant ear
lobes, carrying an enormous sack from which he dispenses gifts.

MIRROR
The kagami (traditional mirror) was a metal disk—usually of bronze or silver
with a high polish. The mirror first appears as the device by which Amaterasu
π-mikami was lured from her cave. Mirrors were used in divination as well as in
sorcery, and in one myth a court nobleman threw his mirror overboard as a sac
rifice to the deities during a storm that threatened to capsize his ship, indicating
how precious these objects were.
A mirror forms part of the Japanese imperial regalia, representing the
mitama (spirit) of the deity. Its ritual color is white, and many shrines are deco
rated with streamers of this color.
“Magical” mirrors are still in existence. Made of bronze, they will reflect an
image of Kannon carved into the back of the object. They were considered of
great merit and high value because they reflected the mercy of Kannon’s exis
tence. The incision of the image on the back of the bronze mirror produces con
coidal blemishes, invisible to the eye, on the polished front of the mirror. When
bright light is reflected off the polished surface, these invisible blemishes cause
a ghostly image in the reflection. This can be quite startling and satisfyingly
mysterious even if the viewer does know the secret.

A water kami, last-born deity of Izanami, the creatrix. Distressed for humans
after giving birth to the fire god, Kagutsuchi-no-kami, she felt mercy for
humankind and so gave birth to four more offspring: Mizuhame, the clay
princess, the gourd, and the water reed. These would pacify the fire god if he
became rambunctious and evil hearted.

MONJU-BOSATSU
The boddhisattva of sagacity and of the word. Words and thought are both par
ticularly powerful concepts in Buddhist thought. He is the guardian of the words
that make up the Buddhist canon. As such, he is particularly well disposed
toward those engaged in the effort of study, and temples to Monju-bosatsu (e.g.,
in Yamadera in Yamagata prefecture) are often visited by those taking university
entrance exams. Thus he may be identified with Tenjin, the kami of scholarship.
He is also associated with the more severe-looking Daitoku-bosatsu.
Monju-bosatsu is often pictured as a young infant carrying in his left hand a
scroll and in his right an upright naked sword, with which one can defeat the
passions that interfere with studies. He rides a shishi lion, a symbol of majesty
and rule and the icon of protectiveness toward the young. The shishi, like
Monju, loves and protects its young but also tests them severely.

lished, there is no great need for this creative principle.

MOUNTAINS
Mountains and rivers were the most important elements in the mythological
landscape, and both mythical and real mountains feature heavily in Japanese
myths.
For archaic Japanese, mountains were sacred. Not only were they the abode
of gods, but they were the personification of gods as well. Most such famous
mountains, whether the majestic sole peak of Mt. Fuji or the lower hill forma
tions that became mountains in popular imagination, were forbidden places.
When a shrine was erected to a deity in that mountain, the mountain was gen
erally put off limits, and the shrine was erected at its base. Gradually some of
those rules were relaxed. The feeling that mountains were sacred and the abode
of the gods received a reinforcement from Buddhism, for which Mt. Meru was a
physical embodiment of Buddhist Law.
In Shintπ, two of the most prominent features of Takamagahara, the home
of the heavenly deities, are two mountains ranges, one that produces iron, the
other that produces ritual resources: Both ritual and iron were the source of
majesty and rule in archaic Japan. Other mountains feature prominently in
myths as the abodes of deities, both heavenly and earthly. Mt. Fuji is the embod
iment and home to a female kami, Kπnπhanasakuya-hime, also known as Sen
gen. Other deities, some named, others unnamed, lived in or on mountains,
which they sometimes defended with zeal, as the story of Yamato-takeru’s death
at Mt. Ibuki shows.
For Buddhism there was only one major mythical mountain—Mt. Meru
(Sumeru. Shumisen in Japanese)—all other mountains were emblematic of that
one prominence. This was not only a mythical place but, more important, a sym
bolic representation of the cosmos as a whole, of the place of humans, gods, and
Buddhas within it. Its flanks were guarded by armies of gods and demons com
manded by four generals (the Shi Tenno) who conveyed blessings and defended the
approaches of the mountain with equal zeal. And at its peak resided the Buddhas,
218 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



each in his own paradise. The mountain could be climbed by those individuals
determined and bold enough, and, of course, possessing a pure heart. Thus Mt.
Meru represented the individual’s struggle, passing through layers of reality and
experience, to become a Buddha. The image of pilgrimage up a mountain was thus
an essential element in the practice of Buddhism. When Buddhism was imported
into Japan, this particular element was completely in tune with Japanese native
attitudes. Many sacred mountains thus became sites of pilgrimage as people fol
lowed both Buddhist and Shintπ devotions, or mixed them into Ryπbu Shintπ.
The syncretic beliefs espoused by theologians such as Kπbπ Daishi brought
mountains into further prominence. A new form of deity was born—gongen
deities of particular mountain locations that were protective deities with a
mixed Shintπ-Buddhist coloring.

MY  ̄OGEN-BOSATSU
The polar star, one of the seven celestial sages of the Big Dipper constellation.
He regulates the seasons and the stars. The veneration of Myπgen is highly syn
cretic. He has characteristics borrowed from Indian, Chinese, and Japanese
beliefs as regulator of the heavens in the same way that the emperor is regulator
of the earth. Myπgen is perceived as both a Buddhist and a Shintπ deity. He is
generally portrayed in the form of a youth in armor, resting on a sword, his head
surrounded by the nimbus of the seven celestial sages. He rides a peculiar beast
composed of an intertwined serpent and turtle. These two represent the world in
total, longevity, and health. He is a warrior, and was often appealed to on the eve
of battle.

NAMAZU
A giant catfish that lives under the earth. When it swims through the bowels of
the world, it brings about earthquakes. Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto (Kashima
Daimyπjin) drove the kaname-ishi stone through the earth to pin the fish’s head
in place. The top of the stone is still visible at the Kashima shrine in Hitachi
(Ibaragi prefecture). It is a rounded rock, 16 inches or so in diameter and project
ing 6 inches above the ground, with a concave upper surface, but it goes down
deep into the earth. A popular saying is, “Yurugu tomo yomoya nukeji no
kaname-ishi Kashima no kami no aran kagiri wa.” (Even if the earth moves, have
no fear, for the Kashima kami holds the kaname-ishi in place; Ouwehand 1964).
220 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Namazu and the thunder deity are feared, but they also bring material
wealth. The myth of the catfish became particularly prevalent during the Edo
period when economic conditions threatened the lives of poor people. Namazu
was the cause of earthquakes, which, though they caused trouble and grief to
all, caused more trouble and grief to the rich—who had more to lose—and
might bring relief to the poor, who could escape their harsh lives in the periods
of anarchy that followed earthquakes. Namazu thus also represented, at least
for the poor (of whom there were many), the yo-naoshi, the renewal of the
world, when everything turns topsy-turvy and the poor shall inherit the gold of
the rich. When Kashima Daimyπjin travels to Izumo to attend the annual con
ference of the gods on the tenth month, Namazu may exploit this absence and
cause earthquakes.
The association of Namazu with wealth and with its wandering over the
earth in the absence of the other deities had brought about a parallelism, even an
identity, between Namazu and the deity Ebisu, who also does not heed the call
to the kami assembly in Izumo. Though Namazu often appears in a semihuman
form, usually one that predicts, or causes, personal misfortune (in which case
one needs to appeal to the Kashima kami to ensure his expulsion), he might, like
Ebisu, also provide wealth.
Namazu gives, or at least lends, riches, if one knows how to solicit him, and
if one behaves properly: In many places in Japan there are kuramaya (cave store
houses) where one can borrow lacquer bowls or other utensils for use, provided
they are returned. These are the property of a local deity, often identified with
Namazu. But woe if the utensils are not returned: The loan process as well as the
good that the utensils bring terminates immediately.
The thunder (Takemikazuchi) and earthquake (Namazu) deities are related
and often refer to one another as “colleagues,” or members of the same group.
Earthquakes are thus thunder that bides its time under the earth, as can be seen
from the eight thunder gods who emerged from the body of the dead Izanami.
Another earthquake deity, Nai-no-kami, was worshiped beginning in the sev
enth century and was later identified with Namazu. During the Meiji period,
attempts were made to personify Nai-no-kami as a separate Shintπ earthquake
deity.

NINIGI-NO-MIKOTO
Grandson of Amaterasu-π-mikami and founder of the imperial house. Ninigi-no
mikoto, known as the heavenly grandson, was charged with assuming rule over
the Central Land of the Reed Plains, which under ∏kuninushi’s governance had
become troubled and disordered. He received the position after his father had
abdicated in his favor. Five future clan heads, and several deities, some armed,
were assigned as his assistants; they eventually became the ujigami (ancestral
deities) of several clans. This myth, argue many scholars, may well be an
account of the struggle between the Yamato and other nations (and traditions)
for control of the Japanese islands.
Ninigi-no-mikoto (his full name is given as Am§-Nigishi-Kuninigishi
Amatsu-hiko-no-ninigi-no-mikoto) was given three items as symbols of his rank
and mission and as shintai (objects of worship). These were the string of myriad
magatama jewels, the mirror that drew Amaterasu from her cave, and the sword
Kusanagi that Susano-wo had cut from the tail of the eight-headed serpent and
given Amaterasu in apology for his sinful acts. In his conquest, Ninigi was
guided by Sarutahiko-no-kami, and advised by Ama-no-uzume. He settled in
Himuka on the island of Kyushu. Besides the story of his descent from heaven,
which constituted a charter for the Yamato ruling house in its conquest of
Japan—most notably of its most serious rivals in Izumo—Ninigi features in two
other myths concerning his spouse and children, whose significance is that they
mark the beginning of the process of separation between the deities and the
emperors, their descendants.
Ninigi-no-mikoto met Kπnπhanasakuya-hime and proposed marriage. Her
father, the earth-mountain kami Oyamatsumi-no-kami, agreed, and sent the
bride rich bridal gifts along with Kπnπhanasakuya-hime’s ugly older sister as sec
ond bride. Ninigi sent the older ugly bride back and was upbraided by his father
in-law, who explained that the elder sister brought longevity and steadfastness,
the younger flourishing like blossoms. Because Ninigi had sent the elder back,
the lives of the children of the heavenly deities would be brilliant but short. As
a consequence, the emperors’ lives have generally been short.
The day after the wedding, Kπnπhanasakuya-hime announced she was preg
nant. Ninigi suspected the child was not his. To counter that, his wife set the
222 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



birth-sequestration hut aflame after sealing the entrances. If the child was of
divine descent, she announced, it would survive, but if it were the child of an
earthly deity, it would perish. The child, Hoderi-no-mikoto, survived the flames.
In these myths the Kπjiki and Nihonshπki authors were explaining the para
dox of the avowed divinity of the emperors and their very clearly human nature.
In fact, the latter halves of both books are a record of not-so-glorious lives of a
series of emperors, their assignations, plots against them, murders, and other
events: a mundane record of petty rulers that could be found in any culture. The
authors were in effect saying that notwithstanding this evidence of humanity and
mortality, the rulers of Japan were descended from a line of deities, and were in
fact deities themselves. The combination of the two messages—political superi
ority and its charter, and the divinity/humanity paradox—were at the basis of the
Japanese state, and survived as its political manifesto to World War II and beyond.
It is this myth, perhaps more than any other, which allows the Japanese to think
of their emperor—and by extension, of the Japanese state and the Japanese peo
ple—as a unified, heaven-descended, yet clearly human, group of people.

NI-  ̄O
Two giant figures who are protectors of sacred precincts positioned at the
entrance to many shrines and temples. They are otherwise known as Kongπ-rik
ishi (Thunderbolt strongman), and shown, seminude, muscles bulging, and faces
in terrifying rictuses, on either side of a temple’s entrance. They are sometimes
said to be two demons who became the zealous disciples and self-appointed
bodyguards of the Buddha. One displays a hand-gesture signifying pacification of
enemies. His mouth is open, uttering the syllable om (the first word; the alpha)
and named Misshaku (also identified with Aizen Myπ-π). The other, Kongπ
(identified with Fudπ Myπ-π), may hold a kongπ (thunderbolt weapon), and his
mouth is closed as he utters the syllable hum (the final word; the omega).
Many centuries ago a certain king’s wives bore him sons after word of the
Buddha’s preaching had reached his ears. The first wife bore a thousand sons,
whom the king wished to have attain perfect enlightenment. The second bore
only two sons. One of these two vowed to turn the Wheel of the Law for his
thousand brothers; the other vowed to protect the first while he worked. The
first was Misshaku, the second Kongπ. The Ni-π represent the duality and union
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 223



Misshaku, a ferocious temple Ni-  ̄o guardian, in threatening posture (T. Bognar/TRIP)



of the material and spiritual, and are in reality (say Buddhist believers) a single
god known as Misshakukongπ who lives on Mt. Meru and can manifest himself
in myriad ways. In effect he is the material manifestation of Dainichi Nyπrai.
The Ni-π are very popular figures. They have the power to protect babies as
well as offering protection against thieves. Because they are barefoot, many peo
ple offer them oversized straw sandals to protect their feet. Rikishi, strongman
wrestlers, have been important ritually in Japan since the Nara period. Sacred
wrestling bouts were organized during that period and continue to this day in the
tradition of ∏zumo (grand sumo). Wrestlers and wrestling are considered sacred
activities, and sumo bouts take place in a pavilion considered a Shintπ shrine
under the auspices of an umpire dressed in clothes similar to a Shintπ priest’s.
As can be seen from the competition between Amaterasu and Susano-wo,
wrestling (along with archery) was a means for both divination and trial by com
bat. In fact the shiki leg movements and hand-clapping that are performed by all
sumo wrestlers before a bout are echoes of the ritual Amaterasu carried out
before her bout with her brother. It is not surprising to see, therefore, that the
idea of a wrestler being in some way sacred has permeated Japanese Buddhism as
well. In modern Japan some of this feeling still persists at a popular level: rikishi
(a colloquial term nowadays for sumo wrestlers) are in great demand during Set
subun rituals, when oni are exorcised from Japanese houses in midwinter.

NUSAKORO KAMUI (AINU)
The “community-founding” kamui, he represents the dead and is sometimes
identified with his brother, Kinashut Kamui, the snake deity. As his name indi
cates, he is the spirit, and possibly the origin, of nusa (inau), the shaving-tipped
wands that represent the kamui in any ritual. He is assisted by Yushkep Kamui,
the spider. Nusakoro Kamui is sometimes said to be a female deity. In either
case, one of the major responsibilities of this deity is to preserve the row of inau
arranged in a sort of fence outside the house. This is where the kamui came to
talk and gossip.
Nusa played an important role in the ritual lives of the Ainu, and like almost
all important objects it was deified. Nusakoro Kamui is a messenger to the gods,
expressing the Ainu people’s admiration and reverence, and carrying to the gods
the people’s gifts of wine, lacquer boxes, and other riches. In practice, different
inau were carved to represent/serve as messengers to individual gods. Perhaps
more than any other god except Kamui Fuchi, Nusakoro Kamui represents the
very strong interdependence between the Ainu and their gods and surroundings.

 ̄OGETSUHIME
See Food Deities.
OKAMUTSUMI-NO-MIKOTO
A kami responsible for protection of humankind from painful suffering and
pressing troubles. When Izanagi was pursued by Izanami in the underworld, he
came upon three peaches. The peaches, representing life, helped him ward off
the one thousand five hundred warriors and the eight thunder-snake deities sent
after him. In gratitude he deified them as Okamutsumi-no-mikoto and bid this
kami to protect humankind.
The idea of the peaches may well be an intrusion from a scholar with Chi
nese learning. Certainly the idea of peaches as protectors and bearers of life (as
well as the fruit itself) was introduced from China fairly early in the relations
between the two cultures. The fruit in this case, as in many others, is apposite.
One of the main themes evident in the Izanagi and Izanami theory, as well as in
the issue of food—see for example Ukemochi-no-kami—is the seeming contra
diction between the purity of food (and of men) on the one hand, and the impu
rity of dirt (and of women) on the other. The authors of this myth wanted to
point out the duality implicit in the relationship between life and death—an idea
that is continued as Izanami pursues Izanagi.

OKIKURMI (AINU)
Ainu culture hero who features in many myths as an extremely pious powerful
man who performs all the rituals, or who calls on the kamui for assistance for
his people. Okikurmi is wise and good, but he has a counterpart, Samai-unkur,
the chieftain of a neighboring village, who is stupid, careless, and weak. The acts
of the two are often counterpoised, demonstrating the proper reverential way of
226 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



dealing with the kamui. Although Okikurmi performs the right rituals and is
always respectful toward the kamui, Samai-unkur, either through stupidity or
malevolence, often forgets, or does not perform the right rituals, and brings
about calamities on his people. Several myths recount how Okikurmi and
Samai-unkur went fishing. In one such, they are met by the North Wind goddess,
who dances up a storm. Samai-unkur dies, but Okikurmi, knowing the proper
magic, procured a magical bow and arrow, and shoots the deity dead. In another,
they harpoon a swordfish that drags their boat across the waves for many days
and nights. Again, the weak and indecisive Samai-unkur dies, but the hero
knows the magic of the harpoon, curses the fish, then lets him go. The sword
fish dies of the curse and is washed upon the beach, where he is eaten by foxes
and unclean crows, instead of being treated royally and enjoying the ritual send
off deities-as-prey are entitled to. In contrast, a tree goddess, entreated properly
by Okikurmi, allows herself to be made into a boat that conducts many glorious
trading voyages to the Japanese. Once old and broken, the boat is dismissed rit
ually together with the presents she has been instrumental in acquiring.
Okikurmi also features in myths as a lone hero, succeeding either by wit or
agility. In one myth, Okikurmi tricked a sak-somo-ayep (a dragon, or snake god,
who hates the cold; Ainu dragons live in lakes, and their mere stench is sufficient
to kill other beings) into going upriver to its source, where there would be a bride
waiting for him. The dragon followed the instructions, but instead of finding a
fine house and a waiting bride, as was promised, he found himself in a hornets’
nest, where he was stung to death. In another, rather similar myth, Okikurmi
appears to an ararush (evil monster bear) who has been hoarding the fish and the
game on his own drying racks. The hero charms the bear with an inau and tells
him to leave and find a place over the sea where others of the bear’s kind are feast
ing. The ararush does so, dying of hunger when he reaches his objective and finds
a rocky shore rather than a paradise. Okikurmi breaks the bear’s storehouses and
drying racks, releasing the game and fish there, thus allowing them to repopulate
the rivers and forests and avert an Ainu famine. On another occasion, Okikurmi
ambushes the ferocious man-eating furi bird. He hides all the people in the forest,
walking about on the beach by himself. When the furi stoops, Okikurmi dodges,
and the furi bird buries itself in the sand, its beak impaling the bottom of the
earth. The hero then rushes up and beats the monster to death.
The corpus of Okikurmi myths represents the ideal Ainu man: Tough and
able to stand privation, he knows magic and is able to overcome even the most
powerful opponents by his knowledge or his cleverness. Above all, Okikurmi
myths reiterate the fundamental basis of Ainu life: the need to accommodate to
nature by using the proper ritual observances.

 ̄OKUNINUSHI
“Master of the land,” major earthly kami, and concurrently the kami of magic
and medicine. He is referred to by one of four names in addition to his formal
one: Onamuji-no-kami (Possessor of the great name or Possessor of the great
land), Ashiharahikπ-wo-no-kami (Prince of the reed plain), Yachihokπ-no-kami
(Eight-thousand spears deity), and Utsushikunitama-no-kami (Spirit deity of the
mortal world). The names indicate how significant this kami is in Japanese
mythology.
A sixth-generation descendant of Susano-wo, he was used by his eighty
brothers as servant when they set out to woo Yagami-hime, the beauty of Inaba.
At Cape K§ta, the eighty brothers found a badly flayed rabbit and played a cruel
joke on him, telling him that if he bathed in saltwater, his skin would heal.
∏kuninushi, following his brothers with the baggage, found the suffering rabbit
and advised it to bathe in river water and roll in the pollen of river grass to
restore its pelt. Yagami-hime refused the eighty brothers and instead married
∏kuninushi, though she abandoned him and their child when he promoted
another to chief wife later in the myth.
At Mt. Tema, the eighty brother deities, seeking ∏kuninushi’s life, ordered
him to ambush a red boar. Heating a large rock to red-hot, they rolled it down
the slope. When he caught the rock, thinking it was the boar, ∏kuninushi was
burned to death. His mother ascended to heaven and begged Kamimusubi-no
mikoto to revive him. Kisagai-hime and Umugi-hime (both names of shellfish)
restored ∏kuninushi to life at her orders by shaving some of their shell and
washing him in clear water. His brothers then crushed him to death in a tree,
whereupon he was revived once more by his mother. ∏kuninushi fled for advice
to Susano-wo. Arriving at Susano-wo’s hall he met Suseri-hime, Susano-wo’s
daughter, and married her. Susano-wo, apparently incensed by ∏kuninushi’s
breach of manners (the young couple had not solicited the father’s permission)
or wishing to test the mettle of his new son-in-law, bid him sleep in a room with
snakes, then of centipedes and bees. Each time the hero was saved by his new
wife. Susano-wo tried burning ∏kuninushi in a field, but he was saved by a
mouse. ∏kuninushi then entered Susano-wo’s house and was told to comb his
father-in-law’s hair for lice (a mark of respect and intimacy). Instead of lice he
found centipedes (poisonous creatures feared as causes of death). His wife saved
him once again, giving him nuts and red clay that he chewed and spat out, caus
ing Susano-wo to believe that ∏kuninushi was biting the centipedes and spitting
228 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



them out in an act of great filial piety, and an indication of his immunity to poi
son. When Susano-wo fell asleep, ∏kuninushi tied his father-in-law’s hair to the
rafters, blocked the door with a boulder, and, taking his new wife on his back,
made his escape.
During his escape he stole the life sword, Ikutachi, and the life bow-and
arrows, Ikuyumiya. But when he tried to steal the jeweled heavenly harp,
Am§nonπri-gπtπ, it brushed against a tree and woke Susano-wo up. The angered
victim tried to pursue the fleeing couple, but brought his house down upon him
self when his hair pulled down the rafters. Eventually, after being frustrated by
his daughter’s advice to her husband, Susano-wo gave up at Yomotsu Hiruzaka,
the pass from Yπmi to Izumo (where Izanami had been blocked in pursuit much
earlier). He bade ∏kuninushi make Suseri-hime his chief wife, subdue his broth
ers with the stolen weapons, and rule between heaven and earth. This ∏kuni
nushi did, after which he completed the labor of creating the land, assisted by
the dwarf deity Sukunabikona.
Following the construction of his great hall, ∏kuninushi, as his name (Mas
ter of the land) implies, ruled the earth until the heavenly deities, concerned
about the anarchy of his rule, sent down representatives to rule the earth. The
first two attempts failed, and ∏kuninushi enticed the first two representatives,
falling victim only to the third, Takemikazuchi-no-kami (in the Nihonshπki,
accompanied by Futsumitama-no-kami), who bested ∏kuninushi’s son in a
wrestling match. ∏kuninushi agreed to the takeover, but only after he had been
promised a great hall, special foods cooked on a special fire, and access directly
to heaven via the heavenly boat. Not mentioned in the formal histories, but
accepted by most Japanese, is the fact that the kami from all over Japan (with
two notable exceptions, Ebisu and Namazu) convene at Izumo Taisha (a shrine
on the site of ∏kuninushi’s hall, and considered its mundane counterpart) to
report on the passed year’s events and discuss the fate of the people.
There is some internal evidence to suggest that the story of ∏kuninushi is
an alternative myth to the Yamato creation myth. It is conceivable, suggest a
number of scholars, that the Yamato state cult of Amaterasu and the Izumo state
cult of ∏kuninushi were in competition. The Izumo strategy appears to have
been a set of extensive marital alliances with neighboring states, reflected in the
∏kuninushi myth. With the absorption of the Izumo state by the Yamato state
to its east, both myths were combined, carefully positioning the Yamato cult
deities as sky deities (and thus superior) and the Izumo deities as more subordi
nate earth deities. This is strongly evident in the myth of the divine rulership of
the land.
∏kuninushi himself remains a powerful figure. Not only did he create the
land, completing the work started by Izanagi and Izanami, but he is also a bridge
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 229



between the dead and the living, having experienced both states. Unsurprisingly,
he is able to move freely between the lands of the living and those of the dead,
where Susano-wo rules. The parallel of his escape from Susano-wo and Izanagi’s
escape from Izanami is probably no coincidence. His immunity to poison and his
creative powers make him also a deity of magic and wizardry. As a wizard he is
able, unlike others, to travel freely between the two domains of the living and
the dead and is even able, unlike Izanagi, to retrieve wealth and a wife from the
land of the dead. Moreover, the weapons he stole give him the power to both give
and deny life, just as his possession of Am§nonπri-gπtπ (the jeweled heavenly
harp: another item of loot) presumably indicates his control and power over men
and deities, a power that was accorded to music in Japan from early times. Even
today, most formal shrine rituals include music, which is supposed to call the
deities, entertain, and soothe them.

ONI
Demons in the Buddhist pantheon. They constitute one of the six orders of life
in Buddhist cosmology. They received less dangerous, more amusing character
istics in popular imagination and art when they were brought to Japan. Japanese
oni are generally pictured as red, green, or blue humanoids, generally naked but
for a loincloth. They generally have two short horns (sometimes one) growing
from between their unkempt locks of hair. Their hands and feet are clawed, and
they often carry a tetsubπ, a hexagonal club, as a weapon. They serve in Jigoku
under Emma-π to punish wrongdoers who have been sentenced to hell to expi
ate their sins.
They can and do inhabit the mundane earth, and can be expelled on Setsubun
(second day, second month) by a ritual still carried out today: beans are thrown at
the home with the invocation Oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi (Demons out, good luck
in), preferably by a strong man, such as a rikishi (sumo wrestler). At other times
Shπki, a demon-quelling deity, may be called upon to exercise his function and
dispel the demons, who hide from him under furniture and in boxes.
Not intrinsically evil, oni are wrathful and uncontrolled, may be anthro
pophagous, and bring about calamities to the land. They can, however, be paci
fied using spells or Buddhist incantations, and they can even become

boddhisatvas or kami. Some become the servants of holy men, such as the two
oni who served En-no-Gyπja.
In Shintπ the active malevolent aspect (aramitama) of a deity or human who
has been insulted or wronged may be considered an oni. Thus Sugawara
Michizane is depicted as a demon after his death and while he was dealing out
afflictions on Heian-kyπ, the capital. It was not until his deification as Tenjin
that the afflictions ceased. Kamata argues convincingly that though the word oni
does not appear in the Kπjiki, there are a number of oni-like beings, such as
Izanami in the underworld; her servant, the hag of the underworld; Susano-wo;
and some of the earth kami. These all share the duality of wildness and uncon
trolled fury. The Nihonshπki mentions oni in the context of strange dwellers in
wild places with odd customs. On this basis, oni are beings with strange behav
ior, often wild and uncontrolled, who dwell in the margins of the world.
Women in particular are potential oni because (as the myths tell it) they are
given to jealousy. Thus traditional Japanese bridal clothes include a large white
headdress called a “jealousy cover” intended to hide the bride’s possible demon
horns from the public. Its weight (about 22 pounds) is intended to force the
bride’s head down and teach her to accept her lot without jealousy.

ORIHIME AND KENGY  ̄U
Divine lovers separated by parental wrath. Orihime (Weaver princess) was the
daughter of the emperor of heaven. She sat daily by the Heavenly River (the
Milky Way) weaving cloth that her father dearly loved. After many entreaties to
her father, she was allowed to marry Kengy∆ (Cattle-herder). The marriage was
very happy, but in their passion for each other, Orihime neglected her weaving.
As a consequence, her wrathful father placed her back in the sky, and she is vis
ible as the star Vega, whereas Kengy∆ was placed as the star Altair (both among
the brightest in the skies), on the opposite side of the Milky Way. They can only
meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month. The quarter moon
serves as the boat to convey Kengy∆ to his lover. If Orihime does not attend to
her duty, however, the heavenly emperor makes it rain, and they cannot meet,
but must pass messages on by a flock of magpies.
The myth is celebrated in Japan as the festival of Tanabata, during which
people decorate the streets with giant bamboo fronds hung with colored slips of
paper on which poems have been written. The breeze carries the poems’ mean
232 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



ing to the intended recipient. Both this myth and its attendant festival were
imports from China during the Heian period, though it has been argued that the
Chinese myth was superimposed on an earlier native one of the visit of the water
kami to heaven (i.e., the end of the rainy season). Certainly the concept of
“emperor of heaven” (Tien Ta-ti in Chinese) is not originally Japanese. The
theme—true love devastated by the demands of duty—is however a favorite one
in Japanese romance, whether or not this specific myth is referred to. References and further reading:

 ̄OTOSHI-NO-KAMI
A kami of grain, and one of Susano-wo’s children, born in his palace of an
alliance with one of his wives, Kamu-π-ichi-hime, daughter of Oyamatsumi-no
kami. As in the myth of Ukemochi-no-kami, Susano-wo (who is a ruler of the
underworld) is tied closely to the concept of food. Food and women represented
a paradox to the ancient Japanese in that they were the sources of life, yet, in the
dominant ritual conceptions, they were also the sources of, or the derivatives of,
pollution.

OWATATSUMI-NO-KAMI
The major sea kami. One of the children born to Izanagi and Izanami, and also
the father-in-law of Ho-ori-no-mikoto, providing the hero with the tide-raising
and the tide-lowering jewels. The sea was obviously important to the Japanese,
who made a living on its shores. It was a source not only of food but also of trade
goods, as this kami name indicates (wata, meaning “sea,” is also is an old word
for cotton, which was an early and important import in archaic Japan). Owatat
sumi lived in a palace under the sea. He is master of fishes, and his real shape is
that of an old dragon (as is the shape of his descendants, as Ho-ori found out).
The location of Owatatsumi’s kingdom was often identified with Tokoyo-no
kuni, the mysterious land. There are also clear connections to the land of the
dead. Susano-wo was originally slated to become ruler of the sea, but his behav
ior caused him to be reassigned by his father to the land of the dead. Nonetheless,
he is still sometimes identified as ruler of the sea. This conflation of terms may
be the result of confused transmission of the mythical tradition, of the mixture
of different traditions that existed side-by-side in the Japanese islands during the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 233



archaic period, or of a mythical conception that equated the netherworld under,
or in, the sea because it claimed so many victims.

OYAMATSUMI-NO-KAMI
Mountain god. His daughter Kamu-π-ichi-hime married Susano-wo after his
other daughters were eaten by the eight-headed serpent. Another daughter,
Kπnπhanasakuya-hime, mentioned in a subsequent myth, married Ninigi-no
mikoto. Oyamatsumi may have been one of the deities that came into being dur
ing the death of the fire deity last-born of Izanagi and is thus Susano-wo’s brother
as well as father-in-law. From the record in the Kπjiki and Nihonshπki of their
interaction, this seems unlikely. It is possible, therefore, that Oyamatsumi may
have been a generic name for any mountain kami.

“Great eight islands land.” A poetic and traditional name for Japan, derived from
the birth of the eight islands to Izanami in her second act of creation. This term

(The Land of the plentiful reed plains and the fresh rice-ears), which comes into
use in the myth of the heavenly grandson. This may be a mere authorial con

PAUCHI KAMUI (AINU)
An evil spirit that is responsible for psychological disorders. It was born on the
Willow-soul River in High Heaven (Pikun Kando) and came down to earth to
plague humans. It is also responsible for stomach problems, food poisoning,
insanity, and epidemics of frenzied dancing.
For the boreal-forest–dwelling Ainu, madness and stomach ailments were
closely linked. Starvation and the ingestion of a number of semipoisonous and hal
lucinogenic plants brought about similar outbreaks. Japanese officials in Hokkaido
234 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



in the late nineteenth century
reported that a number of vil
lages were wiped out by epi
demics of a mysterious “dancing
disease” in which the communi
ties starved themselves to death
in a dancing frenzy. Whether this
was the result of Japanese intru
sions and impositions or cases of
mass poisoning by some halluci
native substance is not known,
but very clearly the Ainu knew,
and feared, the emergence of
these events.
The pressure of technologi
cally superior cultures on boreal
circumpolar societies that
occurred in the nineteenth cen
tury seem to have brought out
similar responses among these
people, who largely shared many
cultural traits. Thus Pauchi
Kamui’s effects seem remarkably
similar to psychotic afflictions
among North American natives
such as the wendigo syndrome
and the Ghost Shirt dance.

PURE LAND
The Pure Land of the West is the paradise of most of the Amidist sects of Bud
dhism in Japan. There are a number of Pure Lands that appear in Japanese myth,
though rarely as coherent places with dimensions and location. The Pure Land
of Kannon is located in the south, and many explorers have set forth from Cape
Muroto, in Shikoku, in search of it.

Amida Nyπrai (J. Stanley/TRIP)



Amida’s paradise was originally a place where those not yet ready to become
Buddhas could spend eons in meditation until they could enter nirvana. In pop
ular myth, however, it became a paradise where all things were good to eat,
where the breezes were pleasant and well scented, and where life was a reward
for piety and suffering on mundane earth.

RAIDEN (ALSO RAIJIN)
One of the many representations of thunder deities. He is represented as a
demon-headed being playing upon a series of drums floating in the air around
him. He is often accompanied by Fujin, the wind god, whose appearance is sim
ilar except that he carries a wind-sack.
Surprisingly, Raiden is reputed to be fond of people’s navels, which he will
consume unless they are well protected. Many Japanese men to this day will
wear a haramaki, a cylinder of cloth or wool worn under one’s clothing, to pro
tect from Raiden’s attentions.
Once a hunter tried to catch Raiden by attaching a human navel to a kite,
which he would reel in once the bait was taken. To acquire the bait he killed a
woman named O-Chiyo, whom he met in the woods. Raiden saw the corpse and,
descending, was struck by O-Chiyo’s beauty. He restored her to life by inserting
a navel he had been chewing on into her. They married and returned to the sky.
Raiden is also sometimes associated with Tenjin, or Sugawara Michizane,
who in his aramitama form brought thunder and lightning to Heian after his
death in exile.

RAIK  ̄O
A legendary archer and hero during the reign of Emperor Murakami, who killed
numerous demons during his career (948–1021). His original name was
Minamoto no Yorimitsu, and though of the bushi (warrior) class (that is, not an
aristocrat in Heian Japan), he was appointed to several governorships. He was
236 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



approached in a dream by the daughter of a legendary Chinese archer who
declared he was the worthy heir of her father, and who left him a bow and
arrows. With his four companions, including the strong man Kintoki, he cleared
the land of demons and monsters.
He killed the monstrous Shutendπji, a giant robber who used to feast on
human flesh and was a great wine bibber, from whence his name (Chief drunk
boy). At night Shutendπji would be transformed into an oni. With his band,
Raikπ set out to kill the ogre. Disguising themselves as yamabushi, they carried
their weapons and armor in the medicine boxes on their backs. On their way
they met a woman who showed them the path to Shutendπji’s castle. The
Sumiyoshi kami gave Raikπ a drug to make Shutendπji drunk, a magic golden
cap, and silken cords. At the castle they asked for shelter for the night.
Shutendπji offered them human flesh, which they pretended to like, and as a
consequence, he offered them drink. Raikπ offered to make the ogre a potent
drink, drugging the wine with the medicine he had received from Sumiyoshi.
When the robber had fallen asleep, Shutendπji assumed his real shape as a fanged
oni. The band armed themselves, bound the ogre with the silken cords, and then
cut off his head. The head jumped up and embedded its fangs into Raikπ’s hel
met, but the golden cap saved his life. The headless but still living demon was
hacked to pieces by Raikπ’s retainers.
On another occasion, Raikπ and his band killed the oni of Mt. Oeyama, who
drank human blood instead of wine. In Kaguragaoka they killed the yama uba
(mountain ogress) dressed in white, with her breasts falling by her knees. She
gave way before them, and they forced their way into the underground palace she
was guarding. They were enticed into a cave by the vision of a beautiful woman,
only to find themselves enmeshed in the cobwebs the magical giant spider had
woven. Raikπ prayed for assistance to Shπki the demon-queller, and, thrusting
with his sword, dispatched the monster. He or one of his retainers, Watanabe no
Tsuna, dispatched the shapeshifter bandit Kidπmaru, who could assume the
guise of any animal. They spied him in ambush in the form of a bullock and
killed him before he could act. Falling ill one day, Raikπ was sent some medi
cine. The medicine made his condition worsen, and, suspecting the messenger,
he stabbed him with his sword. One of his retainers followed the blood trail and
dispatched the giant spider that had disguised itself as a doctor’s assistant.

RENGE
The lotus flower, which reproduces in water without being anchored to earth.
Therefore it represents the absolute and irreducible truth, as well as the self
engendered nature of the Buddha and the Buddhist Law. More than any object it
symbolizes the Buddha as an object/being sui-generis requiring no explanation
or interpretation. The eight-petalled lotus flower represents the Buddhist Law,
and Buddhas are usually represented seated on a lotus flower. Many, such as
Kannon, carry a lotus bud in their hands. In the Pure Land of the West, there is
a lotus pond. Whenever a Buddhist is born, a new lotus bud floats to the surface.
It grows or fades according to the type of life that Buddhist leads.

REPUN KAMUI (AINU)
The killer whale, ruler of the deep sea. As a young boy he was mischievous and
unruly, and his sister, who was raising him, punished him for that. They went
out to hunt whales, and the sister, after harpooning her own whale, came to the
young god’s assistance. Finally they filled their house with blubber, staving of
famine. In another kamui yukar, the young Repun Kamui shot a whale and her
young, and generously threw them ashore by a village. He then headed for home.
The sea wren came to Repun Kamui with the gossip that the people were cut
ting up the whale using sickles and axes (that is, they were not showing proper
respect for the animal, or for the donor). Repun Kamui laughed this off and
returned to his home, saying that the meat now belonged to the humans and
they could do as they wished with it.
Sitting in his house, the deity then saw that the sea wren had lied: The
humans were cutting the meat up with their sacred swords, dressed in their
finest clothes (that is, they were properly respecting the gift from the sea). A
winged inau then appeared magically in the deity’s house, bringing with it a
metal goblet of wine, sufficient to fill six tubs, and the grateful prayers of the
humans. Organizing a feast, the sea god gave gifts to his fellow deities, thus con
firming his eminent status, as well as assuring the humans that the bounty of
the sea would keep them from famine.
The mutually dependent relations of humans and kamui are well repre
sented in this myth: The humans need food from nature (stranded whales were
a major item of food), and the kamui need the prayers and offerings of the
humans. These offerings increased the social position of the recipient, who
238 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



would then be inclined to provide more food. Repun Kamui was particularly
important for the Ainu because the sea presented opportunities for harvests that
were not available on land: from food sources such as stranded whales, from fish
ing and hunting marine mammals, and from trading expeditions. References and further reading:

ROKUJI MY  ̄O-  ̄O
One of the heavenly kings. His name means “Six syllables,” and he represents
the six syllables of the Buddhist creed (Om ma ne pad me hum). He has a serene
face, often a green body, and carries a curved sword and a trident in two of his
six hands. He is the guardian of the foundation of the Buddhist Law.

RUSUGAMI
The deities responsible for maintaining the world while the kami are in assem
bly on the tenth month in Izumo. The rusugami include the Kamado-gami
(kitchen kami), Ebisu, and Namazu (the earthquake catfish). Ebisu is usually
questioned by the other kami (usually the suspicious and aggressive
Takemikazuchi) why he did not attend the council but always manages to find
some sort of excuse or lie.
In traditional Japanese culture, the practice of leaving a rusuban (caretaker)
in a house while the family was out was common until fairly recently. Most tra
ditional Japanese houses had no locks, and any burglar could enter simply by lift
ing the shutters. Polite custom dictates even today that a visitor shout out
“Excuse me” to announce his presence. In premodern Japan an individual who
did not do so could be attacked with impunity. In this social framework, the
absence of the kami at Izumo requires a caretaker, because otherwise the social
fabric would be threatened by dissolution and anarchy. Excepting Kamado-gami,
the rusugami are a dissolute lot, which accounts, mythically, for the upsets that
occur within Japan, which is supposedly a land ordered by the kami.

RY  ̄UJIN (ALSO RYU-  ̄O)
The dragon king. Variously portrayed as having a dragon or a giant serpent shape,
he is the master of serpents who act as his messengers. Ry∆jin appears in dreams,
and many people claim to have seen him upon waking. He is variously reported
to live in a palace in the sea or in lakes in extinct volcanoes. He carries the tide
raising and tide-lowering jewels.
Ry∆jin features in a number of Japanese myths, sometimes as a benevolent
ruler or aid to a hero, sometimes as a villain. His palace is generally under the
sea, and he is often identified with Owatatsumi-no-kami. As Owatatsumi he
aided Ho-ori in warding off the attacks of his brother, Hoderi. An example of the
reverse side of his nature concerns a jewel he stole from Kamatari, the founder
of the Fujiwara clan, which was retrieved only at the loss of Kamatari’s wife, a
fisherwoman, who swam down to the dragon’s palace, fought him, and rescued
240 Handbook of Japanese Mythology
Protective water-dragons. Detail from a shrine lintel. (Courtesy of the author)



the jewel, then drowned. He also stole a bell, which he later gave as a gift to
Tawara Toda, who saved Ry∆jin’s palace from a centipede. The same bell was
later stolen by Benkei from the Miidera temple.
The snake can, if treated properly, offer medicines for long life, and Ry∆jin
can help with one’s health. He is often the ujigami of Japanese clans.
The bipolar nature of Ry∆jin as both protector and fierce and troubling oppo
nent is not surprising. He is associated with the most capricious of all elements,
the sea, which, as the Japanese were well aware, brought great benefits and treas
ures but also caused death and havoc. Moreover, as lord of the serpents, who are
associated with thunder and death, and as bringer of rain, he is at the same time
a figure of death and life. Ry∆jin’s good-and-bad nature is a reflection of these
realities.

RY  ̄UJU (NAGARJUNA)
One of the disciples of the Buddha Shakyamuni and a patriarch in a line extend
ing from Dainichi Nyπrai to Kπbπ Daishi. According to Shingon, he received his
secret doctrine (i.e., Shingon’s internal doctrine) from the Second Patriarch,
Vajrasattva, who lived in an iron tower. It is also said that he received his knowl
edge from the nagas (snake spirits), and particularly from Ry∆jin in his palace
under the sea. The treatise he wrote on the Buddhist Law is read in order to bring
rain, and he is identified with Ry∆jin.

SAGES (BUDDHIST AND DAOIST)
Sages are one of the most important classes of “venerated beings” in Buddhist
myth. A number of different persons fall into this classification. Collectively,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 241



sages are humans (almost all male) whose study of Buddhism, or acts in their
lifetimes, were miraculous, exemplary, and erudite. In most cases they are also
miracle workers within the area of their activities.
The sages and the stories told about them straddle the border between myth,
folklore, and legend. That is to say, the stories about them are not, individually,
fundamental to Japanese beliefs or myth. Most Japanese will have come across
these myths as part of their childhood stories or as part of their exposure to clas
sical art. The concept of the sage, however, is a compelling and powerful one in
Japanese ideology, and in that, the idea constitutes a myth in the sense used
here. Sages are fundamentally human. They achieve their mystical powers by
effort and internal struggle. Most sages have at least a touch of magical power,
but this is not inherent in them. It is the result of effortful study, of continued
application and hard work. Sages thus represent the “you-and-me” side of myth.
They are very compelling because they point to features of life that are as fun
damentally true for Japanese people as are similar myths in other countries. Con
centration of mind on achieving one’s goal, the need to live within nature, and
the quirkiness and ineffable nature of life and being are all expressed by the per
son of the sage in much the same way as truth-telling and patriotism are repre
sented by George Washington and Nathan Hale.
For convenience’s sake I have divided sages in the following discussion into
a number of categories. Nonetheless, sages are a mixed lot, and myths about
them are sometimes isolates, sometimes part of a broader mythical background.
Many of those about whom there are myths in Japan are of Chinese and Indian
origin. Sages are particularly important in Zen thinking, and a huge body of tales
exists about Zen sages, whose activities serve as examples for future generations
of Zen adepts.
The Buddha’s Disciples
Many of the Buddha’s disciples are named as sages. A number of these sages,
such as the sonja and the rakan, are known not necessarily for the qualities they
embodied but for events that supposedly took place during their lifetimes, and
which therefore made them fitting intercessionaries in this area. Binzuru-sonja,
for example, has become a Buddhist patron of healing because he looked at a
young woman during meditation and is therefore placed outside the meditation
hall: Common people can therefore approach him without fear of offense, and
beg for help. Disciples such as Ry∆go are the founders of Buddhist sects and may
well straddle the boundaries between this category (disciples) and the next
(saints).
242 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Buddhist Saints
Later Buddhist figures, many of them either founders of schools of Buddhist
thought or abbots of famous monasteries and temples, are within this category.
The three most venerated such figures in Japan are each a founder of a Buddhist
sect or school of thought. Undoubtedly the most well-known and universally
venerated is K∆kai, generally known by his posthumous title of Kπbπ Daishi. In
addition to his historically documented achievements, he is credited with
numerous miracles.
A second well-known sage is Boddhidarma, known in Japan as Daruma.
Daruma is credited with having established the Zen school in China, at the
Shaolin monastery. Most Japanese would be able to recount one or another of the
miraculous activities credited to him: the discovery of tea, his indomitable will,
or his invention of gung-fu. Finally, though only a minority of Japanese are fol
lowers of the Nichiren school of Buddhism, Nichiren-shπnin is recognized as a
major sage in the Buddhist tradition. He too has miraculous events associated
with him, though his fame is perhaps more solidly based on his refusal to com
promise with his beliefs. Other well-known sages who fall into this category
include the founders of virtually all the Buddhist schools in Japan: Hπnen, Shin
ran, En-no-Gyπja, and others.
Daoist and Zen Sages
A great many Daoist sages, virtually all of them Chinese, are recognized in
Japanese art. Quite often their particular characteristics are noted by Japanese
people simply because they are major artistic subjects. In this class can be
included Roshi (Lao-tse), Gama-sennin, and even Songokku (Stone Monkey), the
protagonist and hero of a classical Chinese novel, Voyage to the West. These fig
ures are attractive as mythical heroes, even when they do nothing but walk
across a bridge, for two reasons. First, the stories are quintessentially human,
often amusing, and visually powerful. Second, at a deeper level, they often illus
trate points that the various teachings—Daoism and Zen—were trying to make
about human nature and about their central cosmological concerns, such as rela
tion to nature and to reality.

SANB  ̄O-K  ̄OJIN
Deity of fire and of the hearth, and of the kitchen. Identified sometimes with
Monju-bosatsu and at other times with Fudπ Myπ-π, Sanbπ-Kπjin (Three-way
rough deity) represents violent forces turned toward the good (the three treas
ures—the Buddha, the Law, and the community of monks—most important to
Buddhism). Sanbπ-Kπjin (sometimes called just Kπjin) is a rough and violent
deity of uncertain temper. He is the divine expression of fire, controlled and
sanctified by use, its destructiveness turned into beneficial paths. He destroys all
impurity and all calamity.
A representation of Kπjin is usually placed near the hearth and worshiped
scrupulously. He may be represented merely by a fuda (memorial tablet) in most
households, or by a statue (in Buddhist temples). In such a case he is depicted
with a violent contorted face, fangs gleaming, and carrying a bow and arrows, his
hair aflame. This makes him the Buddhist equivalent of Kamado-gami.
In some ways Kπjin resembles the Ainu Kamui Fuchi and the Ryukyuan
Fii Nu Kang, albeit less powerful than the former. In Japanese myth he has
assumed some of the characteristics of the Chinese kitchen god, who supervises
the activities of members of the household, reporting on their misdeeds to the
village or city god. His association with flames naturally leads to the view that
he is an incarnation or aspect of Fudπ, who is always surrounded by flames and,
like Kπjin, deals with malefactors.

SARUTAHIKO-NO-KAMI
The deity who appeared from the Central Land of the Reed Plains to provide a
guide to Ninigi-no-mikoto when he descended to rule the land. His name can be
244 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



read as “Field-monkey prince.” Because the deity appeared at an eightfold cross
roads, he is often viewed as the deity of crossroads; he is worshiped in the form
of a phallus as Dosπjin. His initial meeting with the heavenly deities was not
auspicious, because he had a fierce aspect and was blocking the roads. He is
described as being over seven feet tall, with a nose seven hands long. His mouth
and posterior were brightly lit up, and his great mirror-like eyes shone cherry-red
from inner flames. He was dissuaded from stopping the heavenly grandson by
Ama-no-uzume, who earlier had enticed Amaterasu from her cave.
After helping Ninigi-no-mikoto control the land, he was accompanied on
his way home by Ame-no-uzume, who may have married him. In any case, they
are both considered the ancestors of an important imperial clan. Sarutahiko sub
sequently went fishing but got his hand caught in a shell and sank to the bottom
of the sea. There he became, or was named for, the different types of seafoam.
As Kπjin (or Kπshin), the kami of the roads, he is accompanied by three
monkeys: Mizaru, Kikizaru, and Iwazaru—a play on words between s(z)aru
(monkey) and the formal negative of the verb. Travelers and other people whose
livelihood depends on the roads celebrate Iron-Monkey Day in his honor, which
occurs every two months at the intersection of the Five Element (pental), Yin
Yang (binary), and Zodiacal (duodenary) calendrical cycles. Many travelers will
offer Kπjin little figurines of straw horses to ensure a safe journey.

SENGEN
Kami of the sacred Mt. Fuji. She is also called Fuji-hime (Princess Fuji) and is
identified with Kπnπhanasakuya-hime, mother of Hoderi-no-mikoto and Ho-ori
no-mikoto. She is represented wearing a broad hat adorned with wisteria twigs,
a play on words between the names of the mountain and the flower that are
homonymous in Japanese.
Fuji-san (Mt. Fuji) is the tallest peak in Japan. It forms an almost perfect
cone and is clearly visible from a great distance because, as a volcano, it is an iso
late (not part of a mountain chain). The name Fuji may be a Japanese pronunci
ation of the Ainu Fuchi, and the original deity of the mountain may well have
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 245



been an Emishi deity of fire. The appearance of the mountain or of Sengen in a
dream is an omen of great good fortune.

SHAKA (SHAKYAMUNI, SAGE OF THE SHAKYA CLAN)
The historical Buddha, founder of a revolutionary philosophy in India. Accepting
the prevailing metaphysical premise of Hinduism—one’s conduct in life deter
mines one’s position in rebirth—Shakyamuni, prince and heir of the Shakya
kingdom in northern India, reflected on the consequences of this cycle. He con
cluded that human and other suffering was the result of desires. These desires
for pleasure, for food, for luxuries, for power—were the results of illusions. So
long as the individual desired those illusions, he was bound to be reincarnated
for more suffering. Shakyamuni’s meditations under the bodhi tree eventually
suggested a cure for this suffering as well: Cessation of desire through a disci
plined life, and search for the truth behind the illusion, could bring about a state
of nibbhana, lack of desire, or salvation. Realizing this, the individual would
become a buddha (enlightened one).
Shakyamuni, renamed the Buddha, preached his view of reality, and by the
time of his death had established a thriving and growing religio-philosophical
sect. This sect grew, after his death, to the major religion on the Indian sub
continent, particularly after its adoption as the state religion by the northern
Indian Maurya dynasty. The teachings were transferred by several routes to
China, and thence to Japan (in India it subsequently declined and has almost
disappeared). Within some Japanese Buddhist schools, Shakyamuni is the Bud
dha of the current age. Within others, such as Jπdπ, he is merely a great saint
and teacher.
Numerous myths are told about Shakyamuni: his strength, his compassion,
and his wisdom. Most of these are borrowed from Indian sources. For devout
Buddhists, the Buddha has thirty-two defining physical marks that set him off
from all of humankind. Some, such as the urna, or shining ball, in the middle of
his forehead, the double-domed skull, and the curling hair, are obvious; others
are much less so. The purport of these myths, which originate in India, is to
show how unusual Shakyamuni was as a human being. In various other myths
he performed awesome austerities, defeated armies of demons, and even chal
lenged Emma-π (Yama), the Lord of Death.
246 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



Many of these tales are told as part of doctrine in some Buddhist sects. They
thus constitute myth as defined here. Like Kπbπ Daishi, however, many of the
myths were originally told about some other hero.

SHI TENNO
The four heavenly kings who protect the world of Buddhism from evil. Each one
is represented by a direction and a color. They also correspond to the four mys
tic animals (Tortoise, Phoenix, Tiger, and Dragon). To the north is Bishamon-ten
(blue). To the west is Komoku-ten (red). To the South is Zπchπ-ten (white). To
the east is Jikoku-ten (green). Bishamon is also popular as the guardian of the
Law and as one of the Shichi Fukujin.
See also Bishamon; Shichi Fukujin. References and further reading:
Joly, Henri L. 1967. Legend in Japanese Art. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Co.
SHICHI FUKUJIN
The seven gods of good fortune. These seven gods, of different origins and asso
ciations, are often represented as traveling together in the fabulous Takarabune
(Treasure ship). Their representation as a collective along with their ship is most
often seen in merchant establishments. Their association in a ship indicates that
they are also marebito (visiting deities).
The seven are: Benten (goddess of love and the arts), Bishamon (god of pro
tection), Daikoku (god of prosperity), Ebisu (god of good luck), Fukurokuju
(longevity and wisdom), Hπtei (good fortune and serenity, generosity), and Juro
jin (longevity). Each of these may also appear separately (see relevant entries). As
separate deities they have an importance and gravity belied by their amusing rep
resentation in the Shichi Fukujin tableau.
Benten carries a lute that signifies her artistic connotations as patroness of
the arts. Bishamon is usually depicted holding a miniature pagoda, indicating his
role as defender of the Buddhist Law and of preserver of legality in general. He is
armed and armored in the Chinese manner. Daikoku is depicted, both in the
ship and when appearing in his own person, as sitting on two fat rice bales. The
bales are surrounded by mice, because Daikoku’s bales are so overflowing he is
prepared to allow the rodents to eat their fill as well. He carries in his hand a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 247



wooden mallet that when shaken or pounded produces gold coins. On his head
he wears a rounded cap of the merchant. Ebisu, with whom Daikoku is most
often associated, is considered Daikoku’s son. He holds a fishing rod in one
hand, and his catch, a large tai (sea bream, but homophonous with the word con
gratulations), in the other. He wears commoner clothes from the Heian period.
Fukurokuju (also called Fukurokujin) has an elongated hair-fringed head, indica
tion of his wisdom and longevity. Hπtei, one of the most popular of the seven, is
depicted as a shaven-headed Buddhist monk, wearing a rumpled robe open at the
waist that displays his enormous stomach (the sign of good nature and generos
ity). He carries, or rests upon, a large sack, from which gifts are dispensed to wor
thy children. Jurojin is represented with a long white beard and carrying a staff
to which is fastened a scroll containing Daoist wisdom. He is always accompa
nied by a stag, a tortoise, or a crane, all symbols of happy old age.
The Takarabune itself is usually drawn as a dragon-prowed Chinese ship.
Jurojin’s crane often flies overhead, and its sail is often marked with the charac
ter for good fortune or with an oval gold coin.
The seven gods and their ship represent one of the strongest streams of
Japanese mythology: the ideas and interpretations of the mercantile classes.
They represent not so much blind luck as good fortune, particularly for the indi

vidual who applies himself. The seven have different origins—Daoism, China,
Confucianism, Buddhism, Shintπ—and are all associated together in a way that
would have made the “official” historians and mythologists of the imperial sys
tem blanch. The images are powerful precisely because they appealed (and still
do) to the enterprise tinged with fatalism of the merchant, shopkeeper, and
urban worker: Takarabune representations are probably the most commonly
seen religious item in modern Japan.

SHIRAMBA KAMUI (AINU)
The kamui of vegetation, and thus of many household implements and tools,
because they are made of wood. He is also present in grains and vegetables. All
plants share some of his spirit or essence (ramat), and as a consequence, they have
some human feelings. For the Ainu, the world surrounding them was alive, and
all plants and animals they made use of had ramat and needed to be dealt with.

SH  ̄OKI
Demon queller. A figure of protection of Chinese origin, Shπki (Qung Kuei) was
a student who had failed the imperial examinations and committed suicide to
expiate his shame. The emperor had him buried with honors, and in return, his
ghost vowed to rid the world of demons. He is applied to for protection against
oni.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 249



Shπki is one of the many mythical figures appealed to for dispelling afflic
tions. As a non-Japanese figure he does not feature in any of the official
mythologies. In art his relationship with oni is sometimes humorous, with one
famous painting depicting an oni hiding in Shπki’s hat. Another famous
hashira-e (pillar painting: long narrow paintings intended for hanging against
house pillars) depicts only the tip of Shπki’s Chinese sword scabbard as he
walks away. Behind him, a miserable-looking oni wipes his face with relief at
having escaped Shπki’s wrath.

A Buddhist deity of wealth. Also called Kangi-ten, he is usually worshiped by

headed god of wealth, Ganesha.

SH  ̄OTOKU TAISHI
A real historical figure, protector of Buddhism in its establishment in Japan, and
author of Japan’s first constitution, the J∆shichijπ-kenpπ (Twelve Article Con
stitution). Prince Umayado (574–622) was the second son of Emperor Yπmei and
became prince regent to Empress Suiko. He was the perfect governor and coun
selor, ruling wisely throughout his office. His posthumous name, Shπtoku
Taishi, means “Prince of Sainted Virtues.” Because of his wise and sagacious
rule and the concern he gave to the common people, he is sometimes venerated
as an avatar of Kannon.
A supporter of Buddhism from his youth, Shπtoku Taishi joined with the
Soga clan of the pro-Buddhist party to defeat the Mononobe and Nakatomi (pro
Shintπ) conservatives at the battle of Mt. Shigi (in modern Osaka). Once he
assumed office, he did his best to ensure the success of the empress’s rule,
strongly opposing centripetal tendencies among the aristocracy of the Yamato
state. He is still venerated as the lawgiver and the founder of the Japanese state.
He is reputed to have been a Buddhist scholar of note, having written a Com
mentary of the Three Sutras at the command of the empress.
250 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



In mythology, Shπtoku Taishi is depicted both as an avatar of the Buddha
and as one who was supported by, and owed his victories to, the boddhisattvas,

SHOZUKA-NO-BABA
An old hag who lives under the dried-up tree at the bank of the Shozukawa, the
river that leads to hell. She deprives the dead of their clothes, which she hangs
up on the branches of the tree. This is said to reinforce the idea that they have
left their old material life behind them. She has a male counterpart, Datsueba,
who may simply be a male variant of the same mythical being.

SHUMISEN (MT. MERU, SUMERU)
The mountain that is the center of the universe in Buddhism. It is guarded on
four sides by the Shi Tenno. Thirty-three million gods dwell on its flanks. The
paradise of the Buddha is upon its summit. It also represents the arduous and
lengthy process a Buddhist must undergo to reach nirvana. Shumisen represents
the struggle of individuals and of humanity collectively to become buddhas. A
number of mountain pilgrimages in Japan, including Mt. Takao, Mt. Fuji, and
the famous pilgrimages of the yamabushi at Yoshino and Mt. Haguro, were
modeled after the path leading up the flanks of Shumisen.

SNAKES
Snakes feature prominently in Japanese myth, usually in one of three forms: as
messengers or avatars of the dragon deity Ry∆jin, as shape-changers who entice
and threaten people, or as thunder deities. Some other kami, such as Ame-no
oshikumone, manifest themselves as snakes.
Many people in Japan today feel that snakes are the messengers of Ry∆jin.
At least in mythology, snakes and dragons are often conflated, and snakes are
considered a minor sort of dragon. Shintπ priests and devout laypeople will
endeavor to avoid harming snakes or their places of residence.
The best-known myth of the second type is the tale of Dojπji temple. Kiy
ohime, a maiden, fell in love with Anchin, a young Buddhist priest. For a time
he resisted her advances and was true to his vows, but eventually he became
entangled and made love to her. His abbot, fearing the worse, identified the
source of the youth’s listlessness as his illicit amour. The young priest
attempted to flee his lover’s clutches, only to see her change into a giant serpent,
which pursued him. The Dojπji myth has become a staple of Kabuki theater,
where the lovely maiden is transformed, with the magic of the theater, into a
giant monster.
A similar myth to Dojπji is encountered earlier in history. Prince Homuchi
wake, recovering from illness, took Hinaga-hime as a one-night bride (a common
practice, as marriage was a fluid affair in Heian Japan). During the night, he dis
covered she was in reality a serpent and fled the marital bed in panic. Enraged,
Hinaga-hime pursued him in a boat. The myth does not tell of the conclusion of
the pursuit.
252 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



As Kiyohime follows the monk who has rejected her, evil thoughts begin to change her
into a snake. From the series Shingata sanjurokkaisen, “New Forms of Thirty-Six
Ghosts.” (Asian Art & Archaeology, Inc./Corbis)



Snakes were associated with lightning and thunder, and thus the snake
kami were often thunder kami as well. There is a strong association in Japanese
myth between snakes, death, and thunder. In the creation myth, Izanagi’s body
in the Land of Yπmi is infested by eight snake deities, who are, at the same time,
also thunder deities. Ouwehand argues that the nature and form of snakes
reminded the ancient Japanese of the shape of lightning and thus their associa
tion with thunder.

STONES
Stones feature in a number of Japanese myths. Izanagi rolls a giant rock to pro
tect his escape from his enraged wife in the underworld. The kaname-ishi stone
pierces through the ground to pin Namazu the catfish in place, because his
movements underground cause earthquakes. Ebisu is recognized as a rock
caught in the nets of fishermen. The empress Jing∆ tied rocks to her girdle to
delay the birth of her son, the Emperor ∏jin, deified as Hachiman.
In common myths, stones could also be the measure of a man’s steadfast
ness. Many local myths tell of meeting a mysterious stranger in the mountains
or on the road, who asks the unwary traveler to hold a stone. The stone grows
heavier and heavier, eventually crushing the victim, or, if the victim endures,
the visitor (male or female) gives the victim magical powers.
The use of stones as items of worship and reverence is very common in
Japan. There is some evidence that the practice was prehistoric in origin. Large
and small boulders can still be found throughout the country that have been gir
dled by shimenawa (rice ropes, often of immense girth, decorated with paper
streamers, used to indicate sacred precincts). In most cases a local myth explains
the significance of the rock. One of the most famous is on the coastline not far
from Amaterasu-π-mikami’s main shrine at Ise. There, two rocks—one on the
shore, the other in the water—are joined by a sacred rope. They represent an eld
erly devoted couple who when they died were transformed into rocks.
Stones and rocks of varying sizes are often worshiped as shintai (the physi
cal representation/manifestation of a kami). It is often sufficient for someone to
find a stone under unusual circumstances, or to find a stone of unusual shape,
254 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



for it to be made into a shintai. The ancient Japanese clearly, and quite naturally,
credited unusual stones with great powers and importance.

SUIJIN (ALSO MIZU-NO-KAMI)
Kami of water, springs, and sometimes wells. Suijin appears in many guises and
most often governs the treatment of springs that provide water for human con
sumption. Suijin is sometimes conflated with Ry∆jin, the dragon kami who is
also associated with water. Fudπ Myπ-π is also sometimes termed Suijin because
of his association with the waterfall. In most cases, however, Suijin appears sim
ply as a stone plaque, or even a simple small stone set upright near a spring’s
emergence.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 255

Suijin expects to be worshiped, or at least noticed. This author, upon leas

sionally” by placing some saké and flowers on the small stone plaque above a
spring on the property.

SUITENGU
One of the sea deities, who is appealed to, to avoid shipwreck. He is shown sup
ported by a tortoise. He is also sometimes considered the deity of luck, because
the sailor and fisherman’s lot is much dependent upon luck. The name is also a
nickname of the child emperor Antoku, who perished at the battle of Dan-no
Ura to the forces of the Minamoto. References and further reading:

SUKUNABIKONA
A midget deity who assisted ∏kuninushi in completing the creation of the land.
∏kuninushi, after contesting with his father-in-law Susano-wo, got down to fin
ishing the act of creation started by Izanagi and Izanami. At Cape Miwo in
Izumo, a midget deity, riding in a boat made of a kagami pod (a gourdlike pod
from an Ampelopsis vine) and dressed in the skin of a wagtail (a goose in the
Nihonshπki), appeared to ∏kuninushi and his party. After some inquiries that
were met with silence from Sukunabikona, the toad (a member of the party who
is a magical animal and has been everywhere) suggested that the scarecrow kami
Kuyebiko would know the newcomer’s identity. Kuyebiko informed them that
the midget deity was the child of Kamimusubi-no-kami (according to the Kπjiki)
who had slipped from her fingers after birth, or of Takamimusubi-no-mikoto
(according to the Nihonshπki). Sukunabikona joined with ∏-Namuji (∏kuni
nushi) to solidify and increase the land. According to the Nihonshπki, the two
deities then completed the construction of the world and made provisions for
curing illness and disease among humans and animals. Included in this were
magical spells to dispel calamities of various sorts. Having done so, Sukun
abikona returned to his own country, Tokoyo-no-kuni.
Sukunabikona, along with ∏kuninushi, is master of magic and wizardry.
Traditionally too, he is associated with the folk figure of Hyottoko, a clownish
figure representing the country bumpkin whose twisted-mouthed mask features
in many kagura (ritual plays).
No less importantly, Sukunabikona is sometimes claimed to be the leech
child, Hiruko, and thus, perhaps, is Ebisu as well. In any case, the most impor
256 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



tant characteristic of Sukunabikona is that he is the marebito par excellence. He
visits, helps in providing magical gifts and in construction, then departs to his
own country. Like other marebito—Ebisu and Hiruko in particular—he is both
deformed and powerful, setting him apart from the normal run of human (and
kami) -kind. It is possible that the marebito concept is a generalized mythical
warning: Be careful of strangers, no matter how odd they look: Treat them well,
then send them off.

SUMERU

SUMIYOSHI
A kami of seafarers and of poetry. Sumiyoshi is a composite deity of Uwazutsu
no-π, Nakazutsu-no-π, and Sokozutsu-no-π (upper sea, middle sea, and lower
sea), and provided Empress Jing∆ with the jewel that allowed her to control the
waves in her invasion of Korea. The Sumiyoshi-taisha shrine in Settsu, in mod
ern Osaka, is Sumiyoshi’s main shrine, though there are branch shrines through
out the country. It is famous for (among other things) being the site where Prince
Genji came to give thanks for attaining marriage with his beloved during the
Heian period.
Sumiyoshi is also enshrined at Uji, near Nara, as the kami of medicine and
healing, carnal lust, and dissipation. Sumiyoshi provided the magic elixir that
aided Raikπ in subduing the drunkard monster Shutendπji. The relationship
between medicine and sexual activity was possibly an import from China, where
Daoism laid great emphasis on the relationship between the two. Sumiyoshi’s
wife-companion in the Uji version is Hashi-hime, deity of lust. It is of course
possible, and not unusual, that the Sumiyoshi of Sumiyoshi-Taisha and of Uji
are two different deities whose names have become conflated.
There are a number of shrines and temples in Japan dedicated to sexual
deities, including a famous temple in Shimoda where Townsend Harris, the first
U.S. ambassador to Japan, resided. Harris was given a concubine by the Japanese
authorities, whom he subsequently abandoned, and this was elaborated into a
myth of unrequited lust in the temple’s history. Echoes of this story may have
influenced Puccini’s Madame Butterfly.

cussing sex (though many of their translators are: Basil Hall Chamberlain wrote
all the suspect events in Latin), or for that matter excretion. Lust and sexual
pleasure as a natural consequence of humanity occur in a number of myths,
starting with Izanagi and Izanami.
The bimodal importance of Sumiyoshi—as protector and as deity of heal
ing—extends to another aspect of Japanese society. One of the major yakuza
(organized crime) gangs in Japan is the Sumiyoshi Rengo, whose patron deity is
Sumiyoshi as kami of healing. The yakuza trace the origin of their organization
to the itinerant traders of medicines and other goods at fairs during the Edo
period, and this gang has adopted the kami’s name as its own.

SUSANO-WO
Brother to Amaterasu-π-mikami, deity of the untamed and the wild storm, and
ruler, with his mother, Izanami, of the underworld. He is identified with the
Buddhist deity Gozu Tenno, emperor of the underworld and plague carrier, and
with Emma-π, the death king. He is also the founder and major culture hero of
the Izumo people. Takehaya-Susano-wo-no-mikoto, to give his full name, is a
complex figure, perhaps the most complex in Japanese mythology. In the classi
cal narrative recounted in both Kπjiki and Nihonshπki he was born after Amat
erasu to Izanami. Susano-wo started his career inauspiciously. Born last, he was
declared ruler of the sea, but his lamentations for his dead mother, Izanami,
brought down the wrath of his father, Izanagi. As a consequence, he was ban
ished to join her in Yπmi, the land of the dead.
Before departing for his new post in the netherworld, Susano-wo went to
visit his sister in the High Plain of Heaven. Suspecting his intentions, she
awaited him armed and armored on the near side of Amanokawa (the Heavenly
River). To assure herself of his good intentions, the two siblings agreed to pro
duce offspring in a form of trial-by-combat. Using the fragments of Susano-wo’s
sword, Amaterasu produced three female deities. Susano-wo, borrowing her
string of jewels, broke them and produced five male deities. They agreed that the
females, having been born of Susano-wo’s sword, were his offspring, whereas the
males, having been born of Amaterasu’s jewelry, were hers (the Nihonshπki,
arguing from the reverse premise, reached the same conclusions), thus Susano
wo declared himself winner of the contest.
Next, the triumphant Susano-wo committed severe acts of pollution: He
broke the dykes his sister had built for her rice paddies and threw excrement at
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 259



his sister’s weaving hall, climaxing his activities by flaying a horse and throw
ing the carcass onto Amaterasu’s palace. Amaterasu withdrew into a cave, caus
ing darkness on heaven and on the Central Land of the Reed Plains. The deities
of heaven, after the usual assembly and after luring Amaterasu from her cave,
promptly banished Susano-wo (this after pulling out his nails and beard and
receiving a heavy indemnity fine of one thousand offering trays). While wander
ing the earth after his banishment, he slew ∏getsuhime, the deity of food, whom
he accused of trying to feed him with polluted substances.
In his wanderings in the Central Land of the Reed Plains, Susano-wo came
upon an elderly couple whose daughters, all but one, had been sacrificed to an
eight-headed serpent. Susano-wo ordered them to prepare eight barrels of special
saké for the serpent. Once the serpent had consumed these and become drunk,
Susano-wo emerged from a hiding place, cutting off the serpent’s heads. He cut
open the serpent’s tails and found the great sword Kusanagi, which he gave, as
an apology, to his sister. The sword was subsequently passed to Ninigi-no
mikoto when he descended to the Central Land of the Reed Plains. Susano-wo
settled in Izumo, and one of his descendants from his marriage to the daughter
of the old couple includes ∏kuninushi. Subsequently, he had one of his daugh
ters, Suseri-hime, stolen along with his sword, bow and arrows (that is, the signs
of his rule), and his kπtπ (harp) by ∏kuninushi.
There are several variants to the Susano-wo myth. The Nihonshπki recounts
in addition to the above that he resided in Kara (Korea) and reached Izumo by
stone (or clay) boat, bringing with him the seeds of edible grains and tree saplings
that he duly planted. The Izumo Fudoki also states that Susano-wo came from
Korea but adds that he brought the art of sword forging with him and essentialy,
founded the Izumo nation. Local myths still extant in Shimane prefecture (the
modern name for the area of Izumo) reinforce the idea that Susano-wo was a
great cultural hero, perhaps originating from Korea (Grayson 2002).
Susano-wo is a complex figure because he appears as both villain and hero, and
as a figure associating the underworld and the sea. As villain he is an uncontrol
lable force, something both admired and feared. As hero, he defends against evil. It
must not be assumed that Susano-wo is the deity of evil. He is, in fact, a commit
ter of tsumi, polluting acts, rather than of evil in the Western or Buddhist sense.
These tsumi are the result of his uncontrolled nature rather than malevolence. In
Japanese terms, it is his aramitama, his wild spirit, that predominates. The storm
is his element because storms are evidence of blessings (rain and fertility) gone
wild and uncontrolled. Shintπ traditionally regards death as polluting, and Susano
wo’s polluting actions suit him for the role of ruler of the land of the dead. The sea,
his original domain, was the location of the Land of Tokoyo, a mysterious land
sometimes identified with the underworld, sometimes with the realm of magic.
260 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The deities that emerged from his meeting with his sister are all assigned
specific dwelling places in the Central Land of the Reed Plains (that is, Japan).
And the record of original Izumo myths recounted above also ensure Susano
wo’s place as a significant deity in the process of creating and naming the land.
These myths, as well as the myth of ∏kuninushi, his descendant, may well be
political myths: a charter for the supremacy of the Yamato royal cult, which
incorporated and ordered, in a subsidiary manner, the cults of other, weaker
nations during the Yamato period. It is also, however, part of the lengthy state
ment made in Japanese myth about the relationship between life and death, and
about the nature of life: a mixture of regulated, orderly progressions and proce
dures, and wild, uncontrollable urges and actions.
Susano-wo’s character is complicated by his nature as a death god or, at
least, as ruler of the underworld. When ∏kuninushi encounters him, he is living
in his high hall in Izumo, the entrance to Yπmi, the land of the dead. He has with
him the Ikutachi (Life sword), Ikuyumiya (Life bow and arrows) and Am§nonπri
gπtπ (Jeweled heavenly harp). His hair is inhabited by centipedes rather than by
lice, as a normal person’s would. All of these would seem to indicate that
Susano-wo is a taker of life, as well as the ruler of the dead. But the Japanese
wording is such that these instruments have an association with life in general.
That they are stolen by ∏kuninushi indicates the ambivalent position of ∏kun
inushi as a wizard able to deceive death. The recorders of the myth seem to be
indicating their belief in the possibility, if one just knew how (or knew whom),
of cheating death.
Like other Japanese myths, the myth of Susano-wo’s defeat by his son-in
law has parallels in European mythology. The myth-type of the giant’s castle is
probably familiar to everyone who has grown up in a Western culture in the form
of Jack and the Beanstalk, which has many variants. Given Japanese ambiva
lence about the underworld, it is not surprising to find the giant’s castle in the
realm of death, nor to find that the lord of death is also a life giver and creator.

SWORDS
Swords appear in a number of Japanese myths, and they fulfill an important role
as indicators of purity, action, and fortitude. A sword is also part of the regalia
of the Japanese imperial house. Swords are represented in one of two forms in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 261



mythological iconography. Those depicted from the age of the founding of Japan
are generally shown as single-edged straight blades often worn slung from a belt
sash. Swords associated with heroes are more often depicted as curved, single
edged, two-hand tachi sabers. The former are fabulous in a sense (though some
fine examples are still extant), and indicate the claim to antiquity and misty ori
gins of the user and of the sword itself.
When Izanami gave birth to the fire kami and was killed by the birth, her
husband, Izanagi, drew the sword Ame-no-π-habari-no-kami (Heavenly wide
pointed blade), also called Itsu-no-π-habari-no-kami (Consecrated wide pointed
blade), and killed his son. The blood adhering to the blade, guard, and pommel
gave birth to other deities. This sword was a kami in its own right. It dammed
the waters of the Heavenly River so that the deities could confer in the dry
riverbed, as was their custom. When they needed someone to subdue ∏kuni
nushi, they asked Ame-no-π-habari to do the job, though he sent his son,
Takemikazuchi-no-kami, instead. As the case of the sword Ame-no-π-habari-no
kami illustrates, swords were considered kami in and of themselves.
Susano-wo found the great sword Kusanagi (Grass-cutter) in the tail of the
eight-headed and –tailed serpent he slew. Ninigi-no-mikoto was given this same
sword by his grandmother, Amaterasu-π-mikami, to help him in his conquest of
the Central Land of the Reed Plains. The sword came into the possession of the
hero Yamato-takeru, who, after using it to subdue the people of the East, left it
in care of one of his wives in Owari (modern Nagoya), where it is kept today at
the Atsuta-jinja shrine. However, some reports attest that the original Kusanagi
was thrown overboard by the losing Taira at the sea battle of Dan-no-Ura and
was replaced by the sword Hironogoza, forged during the reign of Emperor Sujin.
Another of Susano-wo’s swords, Ikutachi (Life sword), was stolen by the wizard
deity ∏kuninushi. The sword’s name (as well as the character of its bearers) is
ambiguous enough to argue that it was a wizardly instrument for conferring, as
well as taking, life.
Ajishikitakahikone-no-kami, enraged at being mistaken for his dead friend
Ame-no-wakahiko (and thus being compared to a corpse), used the sword ∏
Hakari (Great leaf cutter), also called Kamudo-no-tsurugi (Heavenly way sword),
to cut down the funeral house where his friend’s corpse was resting.
Takemikazuchi-no-kami’s sword, Futsu-no-mitama, was dropped into the
storehouse of Takakuraji of Kumano, who was instructed in a dream to hand it
to the future first emperor, Jimmu Tenno. This sword, which helped the hero
subdue the unruly deities of Kumano, was eventually enshrined as go-shintai in
the shrine of Iso-no-kami.
The hero Raikπ, who cleared Japan of demons and ogres, had a sword,
Higekiri (Beard-cutter), with which he dispatched the robber-ogre Shutendπji.
262 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The sword was later loaned to Raikπ’s attendant, Watanabe no Tsuna, with
which he cut off the arm of the Rashπmon oni.
The cult of the sword was a prominent part of Japanese belief and myth.
Swords, along with bows, were the most important weapon of the gentleman,
and there is evidence that the long bow and the sword were the symbols of rule
of the emperor in archaic times. The metallurgy of Japanese swords, originally
fairly simple, became a sophisticated technology that is hard to duplicate today.
Over the centuries the sword underwent two major transformations. The origi
nal straight, single-edged blade was used until around the Nara period. These are
referred to in the Kπjiki as “mallet-headed” swords because the pommel ended
in a large, mallet-shaped knob, often heavily decorated—a necessary balance for
the long blade (which could measure ten hands, approximately fifty inches). All
the blades named in the Kπjiki and Nihonshπki must have been of this type.
Advances in metalworking led to the creation of the composite blade. Made of
alternating layers of steel and softer iron, these blades reached their peak during
the Gempei wars and soon after. They were short, heavy, curved sabers, called
tachi, which evolved later, during the Edo period, into the slimmer, longer, two
handed katana. In mythical terms, the swords that Raikπ and other heroes used
would have been of the tachi type, worn, like the earlier mallet-head swords,
slung under the sash with cords.

TAIRA
The name of a family, or rather clan, that claimed descent from a branch of the
imperial family. The Taira (the Chinese character for their name can be read as
Hei, and they are thus also known as the Heike or House of Hei), led by Taira no
Kiyomori, were called upon by a faction of the nobility in Kyoto to expel the
Minamoto from the capital. Their work done, they stayed to control the impe
rial court. They lost the Gempei wars to the forces of Minamoto no Yoritomo,
and were finally defeated decisively at the sea battle of Dan-no-Ura, the straits
between Kyushu and western Honshu, by Minamoto no Yoshitsune. The
remains of Taira partisans were then hunted down by the victorious Minamoto
loyalists.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 263



The story of the rise and, most particularly, fall of the Taira has long
excited Japanese romanticism. The Taira were doomed heroes, and their spec
tacular fall has resounded in art and popular imagination. Thus a particular
form of crab found in the Seto Inland Sea is named for them because of the
resemblance of the carapace to an armored warrior’s face mask: The crabs are
said to represent the spirits of dead Taira warriors drowned at Dan-no-Ura. Per
sistent myths tie various hidden mountain communities of hinnin (outcasts)
and of shinobi (ninja) clans to the descendants of Taira partisans hiding from
Minamoto retribution.
One of the most famous myths concerning the Taira is the legend of the
blind lute player who was called to play before the ghostly court of Taira noble
men as they eternally wait battle.
The popularity of the Taira is related in some ways to the Japanese cultural
fondness for fighting in doomed causes. The Taira are always portrayed as more
elegant and refined than their Minamoto opponents, doomed from the start to
fall to brute strength. A similar enthusiasm is shown for the cause of the Taira’s
greatest opponent, Minamoto Yoshitsune, who suffered a similar fate to his ene
mies at the hands of his older brother, the shogun Yoritomo. The popularity of
this concept is evidenced by the historical prevalence of lute players, whose
repertoire consisted of a recitation of the Taira chronicles and who were to be
found throughout Japan until the middle of the twentieth century. A number of
Taira-based plays in the Nπh theater exist as well.

TAKAMAGAHARA
The “High Plain of Heaven.” The abode of the heavenly deities. It seems, on the
basis of the writing in the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki, to be not much different
than the early Japan the writers were living in. We know that it held at least one
palace, that of Amaterasu-π-mikami, and her rice fields and dikes. The rest of the
realm is undifferentiated or, at least, not described, with a few landmarks
sketched in. There is the bed of Ame-no-yasu-no-kawa (Heavenly River, also
called Amanokawa). Originally the stream ran free, but it was dammed by Ame
no-π-habari-no-kami, the sword Izanagi carried. The lower, dry riverbed is used
by the deities for their assemblies, where they debate matters relating to them

selves and the land. There are iron-bearing mountains, the Ame-no-kanayama,
and a well, Ame-no-manai, and a further range of mountains, Ame-no
kaguyama, from which divinatory implements can be obtained. We also know
that it is separated from the earthly realm by the Heavenly River (Milky Way),
spanned perhaps by the Heavenly Floating Bridge, though those two elements
are sometimes conflated. At some point there is a meeting of nine ways, where
Sarutahiko ambushed the heavenly grandson, though that might be slightly out
of the boundaries of Takamagahara itself.

TAKAMIMUSUBI-NO-KAMI
The second of the three “invisible” kami who came into existence sponta
neously at the creation of heaven and earth. Though having no spouse, he
nonetheless was the ancestor of a line of kami. In the Nihonshπki he is the
father of Sukunabikona, the midget deity. The same role is assigned to Musubi
no-kami in the Kπjiki, which might suggest they are spouses. He is one of the
most important deities in heaven, almost the coeval of Amaterasu-π-mikami. It
is he, together with Amaterasu, who convenes the Assembly of the Gods in the
dry riverbed of the Heavenly River, whenever that becomes necessary.
He and Amaterasu-π-mikami convened an assembly of the kami when the
heavenly kami decided to restore control and order to the Central Land of the
Reed Plains. He again collaborated with Amaterasu in sending Ame-no
wakahiko to subdue the earth, and when that deity rebelled, sent the pheasant
to find out what had happened. After Ame-no-wakahiko killed the messenger
pheasant, Takamimusubi-no-kami thrust the arrow back the way it had come
and killed Ame-no-wakahiko.
Historically, we know that the Japanese states of the Yayoi and Kofun peri
ods were often ruled by female ruler-shamans. These were usually assisted by a
male counterpart who was ritually secondary, but administratively primary.
The same system existed in historical times in Okinawa, where rulership was
embodied in a brother-sister rulership, the “king” attending to secular matters,
his sister to the divine. It is conceivable that Takamimusubi’s and Amaterasu
π-mikami’s mythical positions derive from that archaic system.

TAKARABUNE
The treasure ship ridden by the Shichi Fukujin (seven gods of good fortune). It is
usually portrayed as a dragon-headed Chinese-style ship with a single mast and
sail. The sail is emblazoned with the character reading “good fortune,” or an
oval, Edo-period ryπ gold coin. It is often accompanied by a crane above and a
turtle below, symbols of longevity and felicity. It sails into port on New Year’s
Eve, dispensing its treasures. These include the key to the gods’ storehouse, a hat
of invisibility, an inexhaustible purse, Daikoku’s hammer that showers gold
coins, a lucky straw raincoat for protection against evil spirits, jewels, assorted
boxes or sacks of oval ryπ gold coins, copper cash, brocade rolls, and other pre
cious items.

TAKEMIKAZUCHI-NO-KAMI
A heavenly warrior deity and thunder god, considered son of the heavenly sword
Ame-no-π-habari-no-kami (though he came into being from the blood of the
slain Kagutsuchi-no-kami), and the messenger who caused ∏kuninushi and his
sons to surrender the Central Land of the Reed Plains to the authority of the
heavenly deities. Sent to Izumo, he seated himself on the point of his sword,
which he had thrust hilt-first into a wave. He convinced ∏kuninushi and his son
Kotoshironushi to submit. The second son, Takeminakata-no-kami, resisted and
was defeated in a wrestling match: When he came to seize Takemikazuchi’s arm
in a wrestling hold, it turned first to an icicle, then to a sword blade. When
Takemikazuchi seized Takeminakata-no-kami’s, arm, it was crushed like a reed.
Later, he sent the sword Futsu-no-mitama to Kamu-Yamato-Iharehiko-no
mikoto (Jimmu Tenno) in Kumano when the emperor had been ensorcelled, to
help him continue his subjugation of the land.
Takemikazuchi-no-kami is sometimes regarded as patron of the martial
virtues, and by extension, of the martial arts. Some martial arts dojo (training
halls) in Japan, notably those of aikido (a martial art heavily reliant on control
ling an opponent’s joint movements), may have small shrines dedicated to this
deity. One of the reasons, of course, is the kami’s steadfastness in accomplish
ing his tasks. The close attachment to aikido derives from the description of
Takemikazuchi’s defeat of Takeminakata by an arm-hold: an aikido hallmark.
In popular myth, Takemikazuchi is important as a thunder god and, even
more significantly, as the subduer of Namazu, the giant catfish that causes
266 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



earthquakes. Takemikazuchi is thus a powerful aramitama, or rough spirit. His
steadfastness and his earthquake-subduing powers—he drove the kaname-ishi
(pinning rock) through the catfish to keep it in place—have brought him the title
of Kashima Daimyπjin (Great deity of Kashima), and his main shrine is the pop
ular Kashima shrine in Ibaragi prefecture, northeast of Tokyo. Many people still
believe that the kaname-ishi, which can be viewed today on the grounds of the
shrine, is what keeps earthquakes in Japan from being even more severe than
they are. He is also a gongen as the main deity of the Kasuga complex in Nara,
where he is considered the avatar of Fukukensaku Kannon in Ryπbu Shintπ. His
totem animal is the white deer, though the association between the kami and
the bodhisattva may be nothing more than the association between the kami’s
tutelary animal and the deer representing the Deer Park where the Buddha
preached.

TAKEMINAKATA-NO-KAMI
One of ∏kuninushi’s sons. When the heavenly deities sent Takemikazuchi-no
kami to demand submission, this son refused, but was defeated in a wrestling
match with the heavenly emissary. He ran away but was overtaken on the banks
of Lake Suwa, where he pleaded for his life. His submission was accepted, and
he dwells to this day in the Suwa shrine, where he is worshiped as the deity of
Lake Suwa. This myth may be the foundation myth for the shrine, as well as a
mythicized account of the surrender of one of the Izumo state’s clans to the
Yamato Omi clan, who claimed Takemikazuchi as clan ancestor.
Takeminakata-no-kami is sometimes identified with the hunter Koga
Saburo, who, persecuted by his brothers, fell into a hole in the earth. He made
his way to a wondrous country (or the country of the dragon king, in some ver
sions) where he lived for many years, marrying a princess of that place. He even
tually returned, took revenge upon his brothers, and was deified as the deity of
Lake Suwa in the name of Takeminakata. This is, of course, a variant of the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 267



Urashimatarπ story, and both are related closely to the story of Ho-ori and the
daughter of the dragon king. Takeminakata is also identified in the Nihonshπki
with Amatsumikaboshi, the kami of the dawn star (Venus).

TA-NO-KAMI
Kami of the rice fields. The guardian of the paddy, this kami is worshiped and
invited to enter the paddy rice, to ensure its growth, and to protect the harvest.
At the end of the harvest he is sent back to his abode in the mountains, where
he is known as Yama-no-kami. Ta-no-kami is sometimes conflated with Inari,
also a deity of the harvest and of prosperity generally. However, many Ta-no
kami shrines in the fields lack the special symbols (red torii, fox figures) of Inari
shrines, and thus Ta-no-kami (whose responsibilities are for the field, but not, as
Inari, for wealth in general) must be considered a separate deity.

TAWARA TODA (TODA HIDESATO, FUJIWARA HIDESATO)
An eleventh-century hero of great strength (his nickname tawara means
“rice–bale,” as he was able to lift a 132-pound bale by himself; for another expla
nation, see below). In the tenth century, Taira no Masakado, a nobleman from
the East, around Edo (now Tokyo) Bay, rebelled against the emperor. Tawara
Toda thought of enlisting with him, but when he was granted an audience, the
hero saw the rebel prince picking up fallen rice from a mat with his chopsticks.
Deciding the rebel was a miser (and presumably unlikely to reward his followers
in the way Toda desired), the hero enlisted with the imperial side under a Fuji
wara shogun (general). Fearing the hero, Masakado spelled up a hundred images
of himself who aped his movements exactly, to act as decoys. The hero crept
into the rebel camp at night and felt the wrist of each sleeping Masakado image,
finally finding the only one with a pulse and slaying it. The apparitions vanished
268 Handbook of Japanese Mythology

Corbis)



with the death of their master. In another version of the story, Toda killed some
of Masakado’s kagemusha (doubles), then started violently insulting Masakado.
The rebel prince, unable to bear the insults, replied, and the wily hero killed him
with an arrow.
As he was crossing the long bridge of Seta in Omi over an inlet of Lake Biwa,
he found a dragon blocking the way. Unconcerned, he passed over the dragon’s
tail. The dragon identified himself as Ry∆jin and said that his domain was being
threatened by a giant centipede, longer than a mountain, and that he had been
waiting for the passage of a fearless man. The hero slew the centipede with an
arrow moistened with his own saliva. In gratitude, Ry∆jin gave him a giant bell,
which he deposited in Miidera temple—the same bell stolen later by Benkei,
which had previously been stolen by Ry∆jin himself—along with a magic caul
dron that would cook without fire, an inexhaustible roll of brocade, and an inex
haustible bag of rice (hence the hero’s nickname).
Tawara Toda represents the protagonists of Japan’s heroic age, and his
behavior and motivations are closer to the reality of that time than those of
many other heroic and romantic heroes described in myths. The samurai ideals
familiar from the ideas of Yamato-damashii (Japanese spirit) and the Ch∆shin
gura evolved during the time of national seclusion and peace of the Edo period.
The samurai of the Gempei and Civil War period were of a different cut of cloth.
Many of them were unabashedly out for what they could get. They were fearless
and brave, but they very clearly expected rewards for that bravery and for their
actions. Tawara Toda was acting in character in the myth, representing the
interests of the bushi (warrior) class when it was being established, and before
the ideals had modified reality. His characteristics are also the characteristics of
the period: strength mixed with guile and a dose of personal magic, as well as
help from the deities when necessary (Toda’s victory over Masakado is credited,
in the Japanese official chronicles, to the statue of Fudπ Myπ-π, currently
enshrined at Narita, not far from the scene of the action).

TENGU
Sometimes benevolent, sometimes malicious mountain sprites. The name is
written in Chinese characters as “Celestial dog,” and the concept may have been
borrowed from China, where comets with long “bushy” tails were considered a
form of a heavenly dog. Tengu are reputed to be quick to anger and to be experts
in sword-making and use. They are associated with mysterious events—sudden
270 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



laughter, unexplained rock falls, and mysterious voices—that people encounter
in the deep mountains. Tengu befuddle and confuse people who attract their
attention, and they are particularly attracted to ascetics who have retired to
mountains to meditate. The yamabushi (mountain ascetic) who practiced mag
ical and esoteric rituals in the depths of mountain wilderness contributed to the
personification of these spirits and to their appearance in popular imagination.
There are two types of tengu described. The shπ-tengu (little, or minor,
tengu), also called karasu-tengu (crow tengu), have the beaks and feathers of
crows and their coloration. The more powerful konoha-tengu (Tumbling-leaf
tengu) have bright red human faces, long bulbous noses, wild white hair, and
bulging eyes. Both kinds of tengu wear the tight leggings and jodhpurlike
trousers, colorful surcoats, and small black pillbox hats that are the uniform of
the yamabushi. They are ruled by an elder, the dai tengu, whose white beard
falls to his belt.
Tengu are not all malevolent. Properly supplicated and given respect, they
may impart some of their legendary skills—stamina, swordsmanship, magical
amulets or spells, and knowledge of the mountains—to the proper person.
Famous tengu include Tarπbπ, the tengu of Mt. Atago, who was converted to the
good by En-no-Gyπja. Tarπbπ is associated with fire, and thus with Jizπ. Another
famous tengu is Kurama-tengu, worshiped on the neighboring Mt. Kurama and
associated with both fire and Bishamon, another guardian of the mountain.
Ushiwakamaru/Yoshitsune was commonly believed to have acquired his leg
endary proficiency with the sword by being trained by Kurama-tengu, as were
several other legendary swordsmen. A well-known sword defense is called
konoha, or tumbling leaf, either deriving from the tengu or, because of the asso
ciation between the term and the tengu’s forest home, giving them their leg
endary reputation for swordsmanship.
Like the kappa and some other magical beings, tengu do not appear in the
official myths, at least not in the form they took in popular imagination. For the
highly regimented and regulated common people of Japan, the tengu, along with
some deities such as Namazu, represented the potential of freedom and of upset
ting the powers that ruled their lives. The parallel between the real yamabushi
(also called kebπzu, or hairy priests) and the mythical tengu was both an
explanatory and prescriptive myth. The tengu were fierce and wild, obeying their
own leaders but not anyone else. In a similar vein, many peasants who rebelled
against the accepted order when times were bad appealed to their own leaders
and to a higher morality, to which the tengu subscribed as well. Further evidence
can be found in the tengu’s female counterparts, the yama-uba and the hap
pyaku bikuni. Yamabushi female counterparts often acted in a mixed role of
Buddhist mendicant nun, medicine woman, diviner, and holy prostitute. Like
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 271



wise, the yama-uba seduced men, promising them a reward if only they could
withstand the burden she placed on them. Under the circumstances in which the
people lived—oppressive taxes, lack of security in the long term, and victimiza
tion by the powers-that-be in various guises—a myth of a free, wild, and uncon
trollable spirit provided some comfort. Nonetheless, it threatened to upset
whatever security the peasant or villager did have. The wild and the civilized
existed side by side with very thin barriers between them.

TENJIN
The deity of scholarship and learning. In the ninth century, Sugawara Michizane
(845–903), a brilliant scholar and official in the Heian court, was charged falsely
with a treasonable offense as result of a power struggle. He was exiled from
Heian-kyπ, the imperial capital (modern Kyoto), to Chikuzen in Kyushu. After
his death, the capital was struck by plague and famine, as well as thunderstorms
that destroyed many buildings. Sugawara appeared to the emperor, as well as
others, in dreams as a goryπ (angry spirit). The emperor canceled the edict of ban
ishment and reinstated Sugawara in his court rank, declaring him a divinity.
When the afflictions did not end, he promoted Tenjin in the official ranking of
kami, and the afflictions ceased.
A number of shrines were established to honor Tenjin as patron deity of
scholarship: There are a number of famous Tenman-gu shrines, including in
Kyushu and Kyoto. Minor Tenjin shrines are also often found on the grounds of
Hachiman (the kami of culture) shrines, and visitors, particularly students doing
their university entrance examinations, will often tie petitions for success to
branches of trees planted near the Tenjin shrine.
Tenjin is a prominent example of a goryπ, an angry kami who has a cause
for grievance (unlike, for example, Susano-wo). His appeasement and deification,
insofar as the authorities were concerned, was merely correcting an improper sit
uation. The case also illustrates the thin boundary between political reality and
religion that existed in the Japanese system. The difference between humans and
kami is a very narrow one, more a difference of degree than of kind. Humans can
272 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



achieve kami-hood, and kami can become disturbed and rough, almost demonic,
under sufficient provocation. The point is further emphasized by the fact that
portrayals of Tenjin during his goryπ phase show him in the form of a red oni,
lightning sprouting from his body and striking onlookers and buildings. The con
tinuation deity-human-demon is clearly illustrated here.

simply be the result of Japanese or Okinawan attempts to increase the legiti

classes: Ruler, high priestesses, nobles, local priestesses, and peasants. In some
accounts he is named as Tenteishi.

See Tenson.
THUNDER DEITIES
A large category of important named and unnamed deities associated with death,
protection, and fertility, often simply addressed indifferently as “Kaminari
sama” (Sir thunder). Among the important named thunder deities are Ajishiki
takahikone, Takemikazuchi, and Raiden. Thunder was a feared natural
phenomenon associated with both death and fertility. Because by thunder the
Japanese also meant lightning, thunder is also related to the concept of diamond
(see Jewels). At the other extreme, thunder is also related to snakes, which are,
at least in the classical mythic histories, associated with death and the under
world.
The various myths concerning thunder deities show them to be a varied lot
in both nature and characteristics. The eight snake/thunder deities that emerged
from the body of the dead Izanami in Yπmi are clear representations of death and
corruption. Presumably because of their habitat and occasional poisonous
nature, snakes were considered the denizens of the world of the dead. Their asso
ciation with thunder is less clear but may be result from a similarity to the shape
of lightning.
Takemikazuchi, a warrior kami who subdued ∏kuninushi and his sons,
later became associated with the cult of the Kashima Daimyπjin, a deity who
protects against earthquakes. When that association began, and whether
Takemikazuchi was the original deity worshiped at Kashima, is difficult to tell.
Nonetheless, the duality between thunder and earthquakes was noted by the
early Japanese, and the associated deities—Takemikazuchi and Namazu
became fixtures of myth.
274 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



A statue of the thunder deity Jikokuten, playing his drums to produce rolling thunder,
in Nitenmon Gate at The Daiyuinbyo, the final resting place of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the
third of the Tokugawa Shoguns and builder of Toshogu Shrine, Nikko, Japan. (Michael
Maslan Historic Photographs/Corbis)



There is also the figure of Raiden. Represented in iconography by a taloned
demon banging on drums, Raiden is clearly influenced by Buddhist tradition. The
stories told about him—his incessant crying (the cause of thunder), his fondness
for human navels—are, like the stories about the raiju, a complex of “Just so” sto
ries and presumably local myths that have lost their original explanation. Ajishik
itakahikone-no-kami, a son of ∏kuninushi, had a petulant outburst at a funeral
and is therefore credited with being the baby whose crying (while he is being
taken up and down a ladder) is the sound of thunder. The raiju is another person
ification of thunder, this time in the form of a weasel- or cat-shaped animal that
leaps onto trees and marks them with fiery claws. Lightning burns on trees are
said to be formed by a raiju’s claws. One other reminder of the thunder deities
needs to be mentioned: their offspring from human women. The myth of the
strong man (or woman) who is a child of the thunder deity (name usually unspec
ified) can be found throughout Japan in both local and Great Tradition form. The
offspring generally favor their male parent: They are wild, powerful, and uncon
trollable but essentially can be tamed by the application of the Buddhist Law
(Dπjπ-hπshi) or by “natural” social obligations of society (Musashibπ Benkei).
These three aspects of the thunder deity myth—association with death, asso
ciation with protection, and explanation of natural phenomena—are combined in
popular imagination. The classic myth histories describe a large number of thun
der deities, and the addition of other myths from nonclassical and later sources
indicates that thunder was a major concern; indeed, it is one of the most impor
tant deity characters in Japanese mythology. Viewed as a myth complex rather
than as individual myths, we can see that thunder deities are among the category
of deities that are most intimate with humankind, in all senses of the word. They
are controllable if only one knows how to approach them; they are vastly power
ful but able, and willing, to impart some of that power to humans; and they inter
act with both humans and deities and as such, serve as useful emissaries and
go-betweens. Moreover, they are quintessentially connected both to the heavens
and to the earth, thus both to the divine and pure, and to the mortal and polluted.

TOYOASHIHARA-NO-CHIAKI-NO-NAGAIOAKI-NO-MIZUHO-NO-KUNI
“Land of the plentiful reed plains and the fresh rice-ears”; in other words, the
Japanese islands. These were the first lands created by the kami and given to the
divine descendants of Amaterasu-π-mikami. Often referred to as Ashiha
ranakatsukuni or Toyoashi-no-hara-no-kuni or Central Land of the Reed Plains,

TSUKIYOMI-NO-MIKOTO
The moon deity, penultimate of Izanagi’s children. He was destined to rule over
the night as his sister, Amaterasu, was to rule over the day. In a myth recounted
in the Nihonshπki but not the Kπjiki (where it is told of Susano-wo), he was sent
by his sister to visit Ukemochi-no-kami, kami of food. The goddess offered him
food taken from her own mouth. The kami was enraged by this seeming insult
(she offered him food polluted by her mouth, rather than fresh food), and he
immediately killed her. Amaterasu heard of the incident and was incensed that
he had killed the kami of food. She subsequently banished her brother to be the
kami of the moon so that she, as kami of the sun, would not see his face again.
It seems that the authors of the Nihonshπki were retelling two origin myths:
the myth of the separation of day/sun and night/moon, and the origins of
humankind’s food. There is also a third theme that touches on this story: The
paradox between men, as pure, or at least potentially pure creatures, and women,
as polluting, or at least potentially polluting creatures.

headdress. Ugajin may be a Japanese representation of the naga, the serpent
deities who protected the Buddha and stored some of his treasures (that is, teach
ings) in their heads. However, given that native Japanese inclination to
adore/fear serpents, this seems like a later interpolation.

UMINAI-GAMI AND UMIKII-GAMI (RYUKYUS)
The sister and brother deities who, together, created the Ryukyu Islands. As is
true with other Ryukyuan mythical figures, they are barely personified, and the
myth is vague and lacks detail. They are comparable to the Japanese Izanami and
Izanagi, albeit without the detail. Formal positions in the Okinawan kingdom
were modeled on the sibling pair: a sister-brother pair were respectively the chief
priestess and the chief ruler in traditional Okinawa, before the importation of
the Confucian patriarchal system in the fourteenth century. Even so, the posi
tion of the sister has always been ritually higher than that of the male of the pair.

A complex term used here to synthesize three related but different concepts in
Japanese mythology: Yπmi, Jigoku, and Tokoyo. In crude terms, the first two rep
resent the world of the dead in Shintπ, and hell in Buddhism. The third is a con
cept linking the two, but it is also equivalent to Never-never land, the Land of
Cockaigne, Hi Brasil, and Fiddler’s Green: a land of wondrous plenty and magic.
Examined in detail, however, none of the Japanese concepts fit precisely with the
Western concepts.
Yπmi is perhaps the easiest to deal with. It is the land of the dead. When
Izanami died giving birth to Kagutsuchi, the fire kami, she arrived in the land of
Yπmi, from where her loving husband tried to rescue her. Because he disobeyed
278 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



her orders not to observe her, they fell into dispute, settled only when Izanagi
escaped to the land of the living. Izanami then reigned as the personification of
death until their son Susano-wo was banished there for mourning his mother
more than was appropriate.
Yπmi is described as a dark and gloomy land, usually “down below,” where
the dead continue their existence amidst centipedes and rot and other polluting
things. Yπmi does not appear to be attached to any idea of sinfulness or punish
ment, and aside from its general gloominess, there is no specific idea of hell as
any more than a continuation of existence. Though the way out is barred by the
Heavenly Rock Barrier, it is clearly identified as a place accessible from the land
of Izumo.
With the emergence of Buddhism in Japan, the idea of Jigoku (hell) was
added to the concept of Yπmi, and Susano-wo became identified with Gozu
tenno, lord of hell and bearer of pestilence and disease, and with Emma-∏, king
of hell and its chief magistrate. In Jigoku, the Buddhist hell, the sinful and unre
pentant dead are tormented by demons until the time of rebirth. The demons are
managed by ten kings headed by Emma-∏. Jigoku is reached by a river, the
Shozukawa, and after crossing it, the dead are deprived of their clothes by Dat
sueba or his female counterpart, Shozuka-no-baba. In the dry river bed of Sansu
no kawa, the souls of little children build cairns of pebbles as their penance.
They are aided by Jizπ-bosatsu, the sound of whose ringed-staff both offers them
comfort and frightens off Shozuka-no-baba.

The two reasonably clear images portrayed by the concepts of Yπmi and
Jigoku are, however, bridged by the third concept, Tokoyo-no-kuni. Tokoyo is
variously described as a land of wonders across the sea, as a place where the dead
go, and as a realm under the sea. Access is via known entrances in the land of
Izumo.
Tokoyo is also the land across the sea where an important category of
kami—the marebito, or visiting kami—come from, including Sukunabikona and
Ebisu. It is also the far-off land where Tajima-mori, a servant of Emperor Suinin,
went to fetch the fruit of the seasonless fragrant tree as medicine. This fruit of
Tokoyo gave rise to the tachibana (Japanese orange) of today. Moreover, Tokoyo
is also the source of saké (rice wine), the medicine par excellence, the secret of
which was brought by Sukunabikona, deity of magic and healing, when he came
to help establish the world. The concept could therefore also imply a realm of
magic and power. To complicate things further, Tokoyo is the realm to which
the son of Tamayori-hime and Hikohohodemi returns. It is identified as the
realm of Tamayori-hime’s father, Owatatsumi, the dragon king of the sea. The
Tokoyo concept was embraced in Buddhism as well, where it is seen as the Land
of the Blessed, ruled by Kannon, and lying somewhere to the southeast of Cape
Muroto in Shikoku. From Tokoyo the ancestors would return from time to time
to visit their descendants. These associations firmly anchor Tokoyo as a marine
domain.
The multiple associations of Tokoyo with death, the sea, and blessings
mean that at least in ancient Japan, the three realms were conflated, or that the
boundaries between the three were very thin. This is reinforced by Ryukyuan
myth: On Ishigaki Island in the southern Yaeyama Group of the Ryukyu Islands
is a cave that leads to niiru, the underworld. Two monstrous giants, Akamata
(Red) and Kuromata (Black), emerge from the cave from time to time, bringing
with them the typhoons that assail the world, and punishing wrong-doers. The
underworld is a good and bad place at the same time: The ancestors come from
there, bringing good, but evils and akuma come from there as well. And the idea
that blessings can be acquired from Tokoyo/the sea is reinforced by the
Urashimatarπ legend, as the fisherman goes to the dragon king’s palace, which
might be in Tokoyo. Finally, the relationship between the land of the dead and
the realm of the sea is evident in the complex position of Susano-wo, who, del
egated to rule the sea, has become ruler of the underworld as well.
The concept of a far land of wonders, usually an island, should not be sur
prising in the Japanese case. Though Tokoyo is often mentioned as being off the
southeastern coast of Cape Muroto in Shikoku (in Buddhist tales) and is reach
able from Izumo, on the other side of Honshu, it is also the kind of never-never
land that people have always speculated about in many cultures. Whether the
280 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



concept derives ultimately from a religious myth (the land of the dead) that was
adopted by popular culture, or whether it was a popular myth about the land of
plenty (which can be found in many cultures) adopted for religious purposes,
does not matter. What is significant is that there was a miraculous source for
good (and bad, or at least, upsetting) things in society. Indeed, Japanese official
and popular experience throughout Japan’s history was such that many strange
and potentially useful things—concepts, people, and material goods—did come
from Korea and China, and starting in the fifteenth century, from Europe. These
same things, and same persons, were also often dangerous, upsetting to the nor
mal order, and threatening in their arrival. The very foundations of Japanese cul
ture were based on the importation of Chinese ideas, and later, by Emperor ∏jin
in particular, of whole families and clans of craftsmen and experts from Korea
(this was important enough to have ∏jin deified as Hachiman, kami of culture).
These imports forced a wholesale rearrangement of archaic Japanese society, just
as the importation of Buddhism some years later, the arrival of the Mongols cen
turies later, and the arrival of the Europeans almost a millennium later did. Thus
visits from the outside became embedded in Japanese myth as both opportuni
ties and threats, and these mysterious far-off lands were the source of blessings
and miracles, as well as evils and upsets. The myth of Tokoyo was thus rein
forced from time to time by the actual appearance of gifts from Tokoyo, that is,
from overseas. For the Japanese peasant and commoner (and sometimes even the
elite) those lands were no less fabulous than the fabled Tokoyo.

URASHIMATAR  ̄O
The Japanese Rip van Winkle. Urashimatarπ was a poor fisherman who found
two boys tormenting a turtle on the beach. He rescued the animal. The follow
ing day he was invited to ride the turtle’s back to the dragon king’s palace under
the sea. Upon arrival, he was greeted, feasted, and entertained by the dragon
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 281



king’s daughter. After some time (often described as several years) he yearned to
return home, notwithstanding the princess’s entreaties. As a parting gift, she
gave him a jewel box.
Arriving at his village, he saw that everything was changed. His house and
family had disappeared. No one remembered him except one old woman who
recalled that she had been told, in her childhood, of Urashimatarπ’s disappear
ance. Despondent, Urashimatarπ opened the jewel case. A mist enveloped him,
and he suddenly changed into a white-bearded old man. In some versions, the
box also contained a feather, which changed him into a crane (symbol of felic
ity); as the crane flew away, it was greeted by the dragon king’s daughter in the
form of a turtle (symbol of long life).
The theme of Urashimatarπ is a common one around the world. Two ele
ments are significant: the concept of the dragon or sea king’s home under the
waves, with clear connections to Ry∆jin and to Owatatsumi-no-kami and Ho
ori-no-mikoto, on the one hand; and the association of the turtle and the crane,
symbols of marital felicity, longevity, and good wishes, which feature on the
Takarabune (Treasure ship) as well. For fishermen in Japan as elsewhere, the sea
was the provider of its bounty, but, at the same time, it was also a source of dan
ger, and of loss of fishermen and those who lived by its shores.

USUSUMA MY  ̄O-  ̄O
One of the heavenly kings responsible for purification from material pollution.
He is invoked by menstruating women, those who are ill, and those with other
bodily afflictions. He is, in consequence, also the guardian of the privy. He is por
trayed as multiarmed, with flaming hair and flames spurting from every pore. He
is sometimes portrayed as bearing a trident.
Ususuma is venerated in Tendai and Shingon esoteric schools of Buddhism,
and particularly in Zen monasteries, mainly at the entrance to meditation halls,
where he ensures the purity of the premises by his presence.

WAKA-USH-KAMUI (AINU)
Deity of the waters. Her name means “Water-dwelling kamui.” Also called
Petorush-mat (Watering-place woman), she is responsible for all fresh water.
While sitting at her hearth (the kamui have hearths and homes like humans, and
they engage in the same tasks, in this case, needlework) she received a message
from the culture hero Okikurmi that a famine had broken out among the
humans. With the last of his resources, he had brewed wine and sent a winged
inau to supplicate the goddess. The goddess then invited the kamui of the River
Rapids, the kamui of game, of fish, of the hunt (Hashinau-uk Kamui), and
Kotankor Kamui (Domain-ruling kamui) to a feast. While dancing and singing
with the kamui of River Rapids, to entertain her guests, she told them of the
humans’ plight.
“The humans do not respect the deer when they come to visit (that is, spir
its wearing their deer guise, as a present to the humans)” said the game kamui.
“The humans do not respect the salmon, killing them any old way, instead
of by properly beating them with a fish maul,” said the fish kamui.
Kotankor Kamui, the domain-ruling kamui, was angry too, for a woman’s
hair had fallen into the wine of the offering.
“I am so sorry,” said the goddess quickly, “I am so stupid, that hair fell from
my head while I was dancing.”
While they were dancing, the two goddesses sent their souls to the store
houses of the kamui of game and of fish and let the deer and the salmon out, so
that they swarmed once again in the land of the humans. The gods went on with
the feast, not wishing to make a scene. After the feast, Waka-ush Kamui sent a
dream to Okikurmi, telling him what had happened, and warning him to treat
the game and fish respectfully. She also told him to apologize to the two
offended deities, and to her assistant, the goddess of the River Rapids, by offer
ing them inau and wine. This he did, ensuring the kamui’s delight, as well as
enhancing Waka-ush Kamui’s reputation and prestige (because she had gotten
offerings for the other gods).
Hokkaido is covered by a web of lively streams and rivers, and it is not sur
prising that the Ainu, whose kotan, or corporate domains, centered around river
valleys, felt that the waters were worthy of particular respect. The myth retold
here, from a kamui yukar, also shows the interdependence and exchange
between the Ainu and their gods. A god’s power and reputation rested on the
amount of offering s/he received, just as human lives depended on treating the
kamui, in their guise as food, in a properly ritualized manner.

WATATSUMI-NO-KAMI
See Owatatsumi-no-kami.
WEAPONS
Many of the Buddhist and Shintπ deities are portrayed carrying weapons, which
are an essential part of their regalia, and weapons appear in many myths. The
carrying of weapons, most notably swords and bows, was a distinguishing mark
of the “gentleman” throughout East Asia from earliest recorded history. The
Yayoi culture, with its stratified ideas, must have participated in this weapon
bearing ideology. The three most common weapons are swords (which are often
named and constitute kami in their own right), bows, and kongπ (a small hand
weapon representing lightning). Swords and kongπ are dealt with in separate
entries.
As a general rule, Buddhist deities tend to carry elaborate Chinese pole arms,
of which the Chinese had a more varied inventory than did the Japanese. Shintπ
deities tend to carry a bow or sword, if anything. The main exception here is the
jeweled spear, Ama-no-Nuboko, with which Izanagi stirred the sea to bring forth
the land.
Bows and arrows feature in a number of myths. Although arrows can slay,
they can also bring about good luck, and they even represent some deities, such
as Hachiman. Contrary to the impression gained from evocations and imagery of
later ages, it was the bow more than the sword that signified the nobleman and
the warrior in Heian Japan and earlier. This might be because metallurgy was
less developed, or because bows were more effective and less risky weapons
(after all, one did not have to see the whites of the enemy’s eyes in order to use
a bow). Several magical bows and arrows appear in the early myths. The most
important arrow is the one that slew Ame-no-wakahiko when he killed the
pheasant rather than returning to heaven. Perhaps the most important bow is
found in the bow-and-arrow of life, symbols of Susano-wo’s nature as kami of
death and ruler of the underworld, and of the ambiguous nature of ∏kuninushi,
who stole them from his father-in-law and is thus wizardly dispenser of both life
and death.
A weapon commonly carried by Buddhist deities is the kongπ (vajra in San
skrit). It consists of a handle with a pile-shaped, rectangular, hexagonal, or octan
gular spike at either end. Tokko have a single spike on either side, sankπ are
284 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



triple-spiked, and there are gokkπ, which are five-pronged. They represent the
diamond and the hard piercing truth of the Buddhist Law, as well as the thun
derbolt, which creates flashing illumination.
One of the most famous and feared collections of weapons are the seven
weapons carried by Benkei, Yoshitsune’s hatchetman and majordomo. The
weapons he carried differ among sources. In addition to a sword and a naginata
(a kind of halberd, with a short, broad sword blade attached to a pole) or a
masakari (broad ax), he also kept a rather unorthodox collection of weapons,
almost all of which were common workmen’s tools. This may have derived from
the minor theme in many myths: the assertions of independence and rebellion
by the lower classes.
The importance of weapons as symbols of power is a feature of many myth
systems, and Japan’s is no different. During most of Japanese history, those who
carried arms displayed and exhibited superiority over those who did not. There
fore, even in Buddhism, with its tradition of respect for life (not always adhered
to, granted), weapons became symbolic of the struggle that Buddhism was
engaged in to establish itself. The weapons, of course, were the weapons com
mon to the times, and those that had particular ideological associations, such as
swords and bows, both expensive items, and items that needed a great deal of
training to use effectively.
From a lengthy historical perspective, the different types of weapons dis
played in mythical iconography constitute a form of debate between prevailing
trends and mythical arguments. The primacy of the kami and the foundation
myths is elaborated by the representation of archaic weaponry: straight mallet
headed swords and long bows. Later, the historical period is presented in the
form of curved tachi and compound long bows. Buddhism weighs in with Chi
nese broad-bladed halberds and kongπ. Commoners contribute the weapons
available to them in the form of adapted daily tools and staves. And the various
strongmen, Benkei, Kintoki, and the oni, carry massive weapons that demon
strate their position, straddling the worlds of order and disorder. The debate is
not about supremacy but more about the place of these many concepts within
the ideological/mythical world the Japanese were constructing.

YAKUSHI NY  ̄ORAI
The Buddha in his appearance as Master of Remedies. Yakushi Nyπrai is the
Buddha of the Pure East (in counterpoise to Amida Nyπrai, Buddha of the Pure
West), the Land of Pure Beryl. He represents the quality of the Buddha as the
great healer to the illness of suffering engendered by attachment to illusion.
Yakushi Nyπrai has a luminous body the color of beryl (green) or lapis lazuli
(deep blue) and is the guardian of the suffering body. Yakushi is particularly effi
cacious when appealed to for illnesses that affect the eyes. He is also generally
worshiped at hot springs, and therefore, by association—because hot springs
were places of both healing and relaxation—at places of entertainment.
Yakushi is usually portrayed holding a pot of medicine in his left hand, with
his right hand raised in a gesture of appeasement. Yakushi (like Amida) is asso
ciated with light, and he may be accompanied by a number of followers repre
senting space, stars, and other bright objects.

YAMA-NO-KAMI
Mountain deity. There are a great number of these, some mentioned in the
Kπjiki by name. Japanese myths and rituals will quite often refer to a, or the,
mountain kami without specifying the name. Most important, the eponymous
Yama-no-kami leaves his home in the mountains in the spring and is enticed
down to the plains by the invitation of the farmers, where, for the summer sea
son, he assumes the name and guise of Ta-no-kami to protect the crops and
ensure a bountiful harvest.
Mountains were considered the main residence of the deities in both Shintπ
and Buddhist belief. The willingness of these mountain deities to leave their
places of residence and aid humans in their work required a great deal of effort
on the part of humans and reaffirmed both the tie between humans and deities
and the fragility of those ties: The harvest was never guaranteed, and the deities
always required proper propositioning and propitiation.
The idea of itinerant deities has wider distribution in the idea of marebito.
286 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



The Yama-no-kami deigns to descend from his seat for a while to help
humankind. But he is there, in the fields, only for a brief while before departing
for his home in the mountains. Many Shintπ rituals are thus constructed on the
idea that humans need to entice the far-off kami to be human guests for a short
while, bringing with them gifts of their presence and what their presence might
provide, that is, the bounty of the harvest.
Though the “itinerant” agriculturally oriented Yama-no-kami is the most
commonly found, another Yama-no-kami is worshiped by hunters, woodcutters,
charcoal gatherers, and other mountain workers. In this myth the Yama-no
kami was believed to be female, represented as an elderly woman whose twelve
offspring are the twelve months of the year.

YAMATO
Ancient province of central Japan and the original home of the Japanese ruling
house. Jimmu Tenno, the first emperor, traveled east to subdue the lands and
founded his kingdom in what is now the Nara Plain in central Japan, which was
known as Yamato. By association, however, the term has come to mean the
Japanese people and Japan as a whole. The term Nihon used today in Japanese for
Japan (from which the English “Japan” originates) is a sinitic term, and tradi
tional Japanese will still sometimes refer to their country as Yamato.
A large portion of both the Kπjiki and the Nihonshπki are devoted to the
political, ritual, and military expansion of this Yamato state. By dint of clever
marital alliances, political maneuvering, and sheer military power, the Yamato
state grew throughout the fifth and sixth centuries C.E. to dominate most of Hon
shu and the littoral of the Seto Inland Sea. This expansion and consolidation
continued until the Heian period, during which the three major islands of Japan
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 287



came under imperial rule. The ruling family of the Yamato state became the
imperial house of Japan, whose descendant still sits on the throne today.
YAMATO-TAKERU
Born Wousu-no-mikoto, Yamato-takeru is one of the major heroes of Japanese
myth associated with the conquest of Japan by the Yamato. His nickname means
“Hero of the Yamato.” The usual dates of his life are given as 70–130 C.E., though
if he existed, those dates are probably a guess by later commentators.
The third son of Emperor Keikπ, Wousu-no-mikoto, was a wild and fierce
youth. While still a boy, he was ordered by his father to admonish his older
brother for not appearing before their father (the brother was ashamed because
he had married two maidens destined as concubines for the emperor). Wousu-no
mikoto caught his older brother in the toilet and tore him apart, throwing the
bits away, after which he calmly reported his deed to his father. Fearing for his
own life, the emperor directed his son to subdue two mighty men, the Kumasπ
takeru in the far west. Equipping himself with women’s garments and a short
sword, the boy hero set forth. Arriving at his destination, he found that the
Kumasπ-takeru and their warriors were completing the construction of a pit
dwelling and preparing for a feast. When the feast started, the prince combed
down his long hair (because he was a boy, his side-locks had not yet been shaved)
and dressed in his aunt’s clothes. Mingling with the women, he joined the fes
tivities. The two Kumasπ-takeru had the young “maiden” sit between them. At
the height of the feast, the hero-prince drew forth his blade and killed the elder
Kumasπ-takeru. The younger victim fled but was caught at the ladder out of the
pit dwelling, where the prince thrust the blade through his body. In a line that
could be credited to a Schwarzenegger film, Wousu-no-mikoto then said, “Don’t
remove the sword, there’s something I want to say.” The youthful hero told his
opponent that he had been sent to kill the Kumasπ-takeru. The dying victim
then bestowed the name Yamato-takeru-no-mikoto on his killer for his bravery.
Following the assassination, Yamato-takeru subdued the country to the west.
On the way home Yamato-takeru directed his attention to Izumo. He made
himself an imitation sword of wood, then falsely befriended Izumo-takeru, a
hero of Izumo. At an opportune moment, after they had relaxed with a swim, he
suggested to his host that they exchange swords, and then suggested that they
practice fencing against one another. Izumo-takeru was unable to draw the imi
tation from its sheath, and Yamato-takeru drew and killed him. After singing a
satirical song, he then subdued Izumo and returned home to report.
His (apparently still fearful) father next ordered the hero of Yamato to pacify
the East, giving him one servant and a spear (the Nihonshπki indicates, in an
alternative view, that this was a sign of the emporer’s trust and confidence in his
288 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



son, not an attempt to kill him). Stopping at the Grand Shrine of Ise, where his
aunt (the emperor’s sister) was the high priestess, Yamato-takeru complained of
his treatment by his father: He had been sent without an army, and without a
chance for rest to subdue first to the west, then to the north, and now to the east.
His aunt provided him with the sword Kusanagi (originally the property of
Susano-wo and later of Amaterasu, and a sign of the youth’s future role as
emperor) and a bag that he was to open only in an emergency. He then proceeded
to the East and subdued the people there.
In Suruga, near Mt. Fuji, he was tricked by the local ruler into going into a
wide plain of grass, which the foe set on fire. Opening his aunt’s bag, he found
fire-making implements with which he set a counterfire, using the sword (whose
name means “Grass-cutter”) to clear a space for himself. He then killed the
treacherous ruler and all his clan, setting fire to his house.
While crossing the sea, Yamato-takeru’s boat was tossed by the waves. His
wife, Otπtachibana-hime (the myth seems to have skipped a period of time,
because he is referred to from this point on as the emperor) threw her eight sleep
ing mats onto the waves and followed in sacrifice (some people say she did this
to spite her husband, who had told her a woman’s place was on the mats!); by
her sacrifice, she calmed the waves. When the hero reached land, he remembered
his wife’s sacrifice and exclaimed, “Azuma wa ya (Oh, my wife!)” as a conse
quence of which the eastern provinces of Japan were known as Azuma. Yamato
takeru then proceeded to subdue the Emishi people. On his way back to the
capital, while he sat to eat his rations, he saw a white deer, which he killed by
striking it in its eye with some wild garlic he was eating.
On his way he stopped and married a woman at Owari. Leaving his sword
Kusanagi with her, he climbed Mt. Ibuki to capture the deity of the mountain
with his bare hands. The deity appeared as a white boar, but it evaded the hero
by causing a hailstorm that battered Yamato-takeru into a daze. Weakened, he
struggled to Nπbo, where he died. While he was being mourned by his wives and
children, his spirit turned into a white bird.
The myth of Yamato-takeru is a myth that elaborates on the growing power
of the Yamato state. It also represents a general myth pattern similar to the myth
of Arthur in Western Europe. In fact, so great are the similarities that Littleton
has argued that both myths derive from a similar source, perhaps a now-vanished
culture of central Asia, from which it spread eastwards and westwards to Britain
carried by Sarmatian mercenaries in the Roman army. Yamato-takeru is thus the
greatest mythical hero of the state religion and emperor cult. The myth both pro
vides a record of the expansion of the empire and continues the practice of pro
viding names for known (at least at the time) geographical features.

portrayed as a terrifying anthropophagous woman of immense strength whose
sharp-toothed mouth is hidden under her hairline, and whose hair turns into ser
pents with which she ensnares and captures small children to eat, or as a merci
ful foster mother to many heroes. Men working in the mountains, wandering
priests, or defeated warriors sometimes meet the yama-uba in the mountains.
She sometimes gives them her baby to hold, promising to return soon. The
child’s weight increases almost beyond endurance. But if the weight is endured,
when she returns she usually endows her victim with superhuman strength,
which becomes hereditary in his family. If the man is unable to bear the weight,
it turns into a rock that crushes him. The most famous hero raised by the yama
uba is Kintarπ (or Kintoki), one of the Shi Tenno (four retainers) of Raikπ.
One variation on the yama-uba myth is that of the happyaku bikuni. The
happyaku bikuni (eight-hundred year nun) wanders the mountains with ever
lasting youth. She eats the servants (some say, the nine-holed shellfish) of the
sea deity and so remains young. She offers people she meets oracles and protec
tive amulets.
In some ways the yama-uba is the counterpart of the tengu. The tengu are
all male, and their dress and manners are mythical reflections of the mountain
ascetics—the yamabushi or kebπzu—who wandered the mountains (itself sus
picious behavior in Japanese society: Where do they belong? What group are they
members of?). The yamabushi visited remote villages to perform rituals, which
to the villagers were magical acts. In parallel there were nuns—bikuni—who did
the same. They ranged in function from traveling holy prostitutes to fortune
tellers and mediums. From the people’s experiences with them probably rose the
image of the happyaku bikuni as well as that of the yama-uba. The tengu and
the yama-uba offer men gifts of skills, but only if they are strong and resolute

enough to acquire them. At the same time they are wild and uncontrolled indi
viduals who can engender wildness among humans, as the myth of Kintoki
shows.

YAOYOROZU-NO-KAMIGAMI
The “eight-hundred ten-thousand-many kami,” or eight million deities. The term
is used to indicate the multitude of kami, many unnamed, some worshiped only
locally, that comprise the Shintπ pantheon. Many kami worshiped are not named
except by title, and the use of the terms allows for great inclusiveness in descrip
tions of the pantheon. It indicates that the kami, whether known or unknown,
permeate Japan and affect everything that happens there. This idea is related to the
concept that Japan is eminently the land of the kami, and therefore that the bound
aries between the Japanese, as a people, and their kami are multistranded.

YOSHITSUNE
A cultural hero and warrior (b.1159–d.1189) during the Gempei war (1180–1185).
Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune, born Ushiwakamaru, was the younger brother of
Minamoto-no-Yoritomo, who became the shogun. Not much is definitely
known about his real life, though it is clear he was a successful general on the
Minamoto side, and responsible for many of their military successes.
In myth, Yoshitsune looms large as the perfect knight, sans peur et sans
reproche. His father had been killed rebelling against the Taira overlords, and
Yoshitsune, a handsome young boy, was sent as an acolyte to the temple on Mt.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 291



The young Ushiwakamaru (later, Yoshitsune) practicing swordsmanship under the eye
of the Kurama dai-tengu. (Asian Art & Archaeology, Inc./Corbis)



Kurama. While there, he was taught fencing by the tengu, whose master took a
fancy to the boy. After his training, he escaped from Mt. Kurama, killing four
robbers on his way to Heian-kyπ, the capital. There he defeated the fearsome
warrior-monk Benkei, using nothing but his fan and flute, thus making Benkei
his loyal servitor for life. Joining his elder brother’s cause, he fought in many bat
tles. Perhaps the most famous is the cavalry charge at Ichinotani, where he led
his troops down what was considered an impassable slope. At the battle of Dan
no-Ura, where the Taira were finally defeated, Yoshitsune jumped over eight
boats, landing in the ninth, to avoid the attentions of Noritsune, the strongman
champion of the Taira.
Yoshitsune eventually incurred his suspicious brother’s hostility for his
popularity and success. He went into hiding again, and, as one major myth tells,
on his way to Northern Japan he and his party disguised themselves as yam
abushi on pilgrimage. At the San no Kuchi barrier, they were detained, only
saved by Benkei’s quick thinking: He beat the young Yoshitsune for being an
intractable servant, thus convincing the gate keeper to let them pass. The story
is recounted in a famous Kabuki play, Kanjinchπ.
Finally, after some time of wandering, Yoshitsune, Benkei, and Yoshitsune’s
wife were surrounded by Yoritomo’s forces and burned to death in their castle.
However, one myth recounts, the brave Benkei dressed himself in his master’s
distinctive armor and died, while Yoshitsune himself escaped from Japan, even
tually becoming a Mongol prince known as Temujin (in some accounts, Temu
jin’s father), who in time became known as Genghis Khan, founder of the
Mongol empire.
The Yoshitsune myth is known by virtually all Japanese, and elements of
it—for example, the servant episode—are the staple of theatrical productions in
Nπh and Kabuki theater. The idea of Benkei’s loyalty to his lord, and indeed of
Yoshitsune’s loyalty to his lord and brother notwithstanding the provocation he
endures, is a major icon of Japanese normative beliefs in loyalty and hard work.

YUKI-ONNA
Snow woman. She is a tall white spirit in the form of an elderly woman. She may
be an image of the kaze-no-kami (the kami of colds) and can sometimes be seen
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 293



by people who are performing kangeiko (cold-weather austerity, during which
men in manual trades, usually apprentices, run naked from their homes to pray
at shrines) during the daikan, the period of greatest cold during the first two
weeks of the second month.
Like the yama-uba, the yuki-onna may be a good or bad omen, depending
on the individual’s stamina, strength, and most importantly determination.
Kangeiko is still practiced in Japan, largely by apprentices in traditional trades
and martial arts schools. The tinkle of the bell that practitioners hang from their
sashes (like sumo wrestlers, they dress only in a mawashi, or broad-sashed loin
cloths) is one of the most evocative midwinter sounds in Japan. The concept of
fortitude and self-discipline in adverse circumstances is intrinsic to Japanese cul
ture. There are a number of ways of expressing it, such as misogyi (purification
under mountain waterfalls) and fire-walking. The yuki-onna and her relative (?)
the yama-uba are expressions of this cultural concept. The cold threatens and
even kills, but being able to overcome it implies the potential for personal
growth and reward.
See also Yama-uba.

YUSHKEP KAMUI (AINU)
The spider goddess. She is also known as Ashketanne-mat (Long-fingered
woman). She is often the familiar of women shamans, serving as guardian and
guide. She is also invoked by birthing women, because with her long legs and
pincers she is able to pull out the newborn safely. In one myth she was wooed
by Poronitne Kamui, a giant demon who lived beyond the cloud horizon. Warned
by a friendly deity, she prepared a trap for her unwelcome suitor. Poronitne
Kamui turned up, but Yushkep Kamui had turned herself into a reed and set her
servants in ambush. The demon searched for his prize, but while digging up the
embers of the hearth he was popped in the eye by Chestnut Boy, who had hid
den there. Falling backwards in surprise, he was jabbed by Needle Boy, then
stung by Hornet Boy in his other eye. His hand was bitten by Viper Boy, his head
thumped by Pestle Boy, and, as he was escaping, Mortar Boy fell onto his head
from above the lintel. The dying demon fled back to his homeland. Yushkep
Kamui lived on calm and undisturbed.
As in most Ainu myths, women are supreme in their own domain, and the
very domestic implements that help them in their daily lives are also weapons
if they are attacked by men. Though Ainu women were formally subordinate to
men in most spheres, they had their own responsibilities and areas of autonomy.
Most crucially, they controlled marriage and the choice of partners through the
294 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



secret kut girdles they wore. As a consequence, few Ainu men were willing to
cross them.

ZA  ̄O-GONGEN
The protective deity of Mt. Zaπ, one of the peaks used extensively by the
Shugendπ ascetics for pilgrimage and ascetic practices.
Zaπ-gongen was revealed to En-no-Gyπja, the original yamabushi, during
the Heian period. While meditating in Yoshino, En-no-Gyπja solicited the aid of
the local guardian spirit. The spirit of Shakyamuni appeared to the sage, but he
rejected him, saying that he himself had not sufficient merit to approach the
state of Buddhahood. The spirit of Kannon then appeared to him in the form of
the Thousand-hands Kannon, but the sage rejected her as well, saying that her
approach was too gentle for the evil world he found himself in. Maitreya then
appeared, and En-no-Gyπja rejected him in turn, saying that the time of the Bud
dha of the future had not yet come: He needed a figure to help in the immediate
battle against evil. As a consequence, he was immediately vouchsafed the view
of the giant figure of Zaπ-gongen, whom he adopted as his patron.
Zaπ-gongen is usually portrayed as a violent deity, one foot raised to stamp
down evil. He carries a kongπ thunderbolt in one hand and wears a flaming
crown. Three giant statues (each over 23 feet tall) of him can be seen at his main
temple, Kinbusen-ji in Yoshino. Many pilgrims, not all of them yamabushi, par
ticipate in his rituals, intended to drive out evil. Zaπ-san is today still a yam
abushi pilgrimage mountain.

TABLE OF MINOR DEITIES
Minor deities are defined here as those for whom there are few mythical
sources—for example, a deity mentioned in the Kπjiki or Nihonshπki without
any particulars, or a deity integral to a story without any details, or a deity whose
myths are restricted to one area or community. The various mythical sources
Kπjiki, Nihonshπki, Engishiki, and others—name several hundred deities, some
without explanation. Scholars such as Motoori attempted to order this informa
tion, often based on little more than a reading, often highly imaginative, of the

deity’s name. The same can be said of Buddhist deities. The following table is
merely a brief sample of some deities who are related in some way to the myths
described throughout this volume, but for whom there is no further significant
information. A few names have been added as examples of the breadth of inter
ests of mythological figures.

NAME DESCRIPTION
Amatsumara A smith deity who made the mirror that enticed
Amaterasu-π-mikami from her cave. He is wor
shiped as patron kami of smiths.
Amatsuhiko-no-mikoto Ninigi-no-mikoto’s father, and son of Amaterasu
π-mikami. He was directed to descend to the Cen
tral Land of Reed Plains to assume control in the

of his son, Ninigi-no-mikoto, and remained in
heaven.
Amatsumikaboshi Kami of the evening star. Also known as
Amenokagasewo. One of the deities born from
the blood of Kagutsuchi-no-kami, the fire kami
slain by his father Izanagi. Identified with Ajishik
itakahikone.
Amenomikumari A pure-water deity. One of the eight born of Haya
akitsu-hiko. Kami with kumari (rushing water) in
their names are generally associated with pure
streams and therefore purification.

the creation.
Amenooshikumone A youthful kami who brings the purification
water for the enthronement rituals of the emperor.
He manifests as a snake.
Amenotokotachi One of the five heavenly deities who came into
being as separates (that is, with no female counter
part).
Anan (Sanskrit: Ananda) One of the Buddha’s earliest disciples, and the
youngest among them. Blessed with a phenomenal
memory, he was able to recite all of the Buddha’s
sermons he had heard, and as such was the source

into existence from the feces Izanami voided after
dying while giving birth to the fire deity.
Hosho Nyπrai The Buddha of the South.
Hπsπ-no-kami Kami of smallpox. Appears in numerous guises,
some of which may well be related to the Indian
Durga. Smallpox was a terrible killer in all pre
modern societies. The vast number of deities, usu
ally female, whose protection against this illness is
sought is evidence of this.
Izuna-gongen Guardian deity of Mt. Izuna. Under the impulse of
Shugendπ, the kami of Mt. Izuna (north of mod
ern-day Nagano, in north-central Honshu), which
may have been an Inari, was redeified as a syn
cretic gongen. The deity is the guardian of the fer
tile Nagano Plain. Like most gongen, the local
kami was subsumed into the syncretic form as a
strong and vigorous protector.
Kanayama-hiko The male kami of metals. He was one of the last
born of Izanami when she died. He and his sister,
Kanayama-hime, were born of her mouth.

WEBSITES
Web pages can be a useful source of information regarding Japanese mythology.
However, because there is no quality control on the Web, you should be aware
that some information may be misleading or incomplete. Some sites seem to
have uncritically accepted data, and as a consequence, information may be dubi
ous. Moreover, because the Web is fluid and always incomplete, new sites will
appear and old ones disappear even in the period between writing and publica
tion. Also to be considered is that many of the relevant sites are in Japanese—an
obvious barrier for scholars lacking Japanese language skills.
Samples of four types of relevant sites are reviewed here. Sites dealing
specifically with mythology include some useful universal glossaries. In the
Japanese case, these must be used carefully. For example, Encyclopedia Mythica
(http://www.pantheon.org) uses the term “God of ___” freely, which is more
than misleading in the Japanese context. Sites about Japanese religion may have
brief notations of mythological stories or narratives, or other relevant data.
Many of these are in Japanese. The third type are sites that contain bibliograph
ical information and even partial fragments of texts, in translation or the origi
nal Japanese. Finally, not dedicated to mythology, some sites have illustrations
of Japanese artworks that depict figures from mythology.

GLOSSARY
akuma Personified evil. That is, beings, sometimes undefined, who bring
afflictions to humankind.
amatsu-kami The heavenly deities. Those deities who came into existence out
of the void, or who were created or born of these deities.
avatar A reflection or expression of a particular Buddha that has (semi-)
independent existence and personifies a limited set of characteristics of that
Buddha. The closest Western analogy are the angels and sephirot of the
Jewish Kabbalah.
bikuni Wandering nun. The yamabushi’s female counterparts; some became
“wives” of settled yamabushi in villages while others wandered on their
own or as part of groups of yamabushi.
boddhisattva Someone capable of achieving Buddhahood immediately, but
who has decided to delay this state in order to assist in the salvation of
others. The title -bosatsu (Japanese rendition of the Indian term
boddhisattva) is appended to a number of deities and saints, such as Jizπ
bosatsu, the patron of lost children.
-bosatsu See boddhisattva.
bunke Branch family of a dπzoku.
bushi The class of individuals throughout medieval and premodern Japanese
history who had the right to bear arms and fight in the service of their lords.
Their status was publicly indicated by the right to wear two swords. Bushi
included samurai (retainers) and unattached rπnin (wave-men). During the
Heian period their status was well below that of the kuge, or court
aristocrats.
butsu Japanese form for Buddha, meaning enlightened. It is appended to the
names of those entities who have freed themselves from the Wheel of Being
and have entered into a state of nirvana where they are no longer subject to
reincarnation and human passions. In practice in Japanese mythology, the
title is applied to a few main venerated beings: Amida-butsu, Shaka-butsu.
311



daimyπ The lord of a feudal domain in the period from the Gempei wars to the
end of Tokugawa rule in 1868. The title, which broadly means “great
name,” is perhaps equivalent to the Western baron. During the Edo period
(1600–1868) the title was regularized, and only lords with an income of
10,000 koku (one koku is the amount of rice needed to sustain one man for
one year, equivalent to 180 liters of rice) and above could call himself
daimyπ.
daishi Usually an honor applied to a great Buddhist priest or innovator who
has exhibited persistent efforts to preserve and extend the Law, such as Kπbπ
Daishi.
Daizπkyπ “Great Storehouse of Writings.” The compilation of Buddhist texts,
including sutras, legal treatises, and other matter. This is roughly
comparable to the Bible combined with the writings of the church fathers,
the prayer books, and the rules of monastic and other orders.
Daoism A philosophical system based heavily on Chinese traditional religion
and incorporating many of its ideas and concepts. Elucidated in two main
books—the Dao-de-jing and the Zhuangzi—and myriad lesser volumes, it
supposes a necessary connection between natural and human ways. Many of
its ideas became incorporated into Japanese religions, particularly Zen.
dπzoku An association of households bound by descent from a common stem
or main household and held together by ritual and economic tie, and most
particularly by the obligations between branch houses and the stem house.
fuda A strip of paper with the name of a kami or Buddhist deity inscribed on
it. Usually placed in the household kami shelf of Buddha-shelf.
goryπ Vengeful spirits of people who have died from false accusations or from
transgressions committed against them. The most widely known goryπ is
that of Sugawara Michizane, subsequently deified as Tenjin-sama.
Great Tradition The traditions of the literary elite. Generally focused on
themes of national unity, power, and the “proper” order of things.
-gu Suffix for the name of some Shintπ shrines. Hachiman and Tenman
(Tenjin-sama) shrines are usually labeled such, for example, Tenman-gu.
gyπja An ascetic who practices austerities, usually in isolation, in order to
gain magical powers.
hiko Prince. A common suffix of many Japanese male kami as well as the sons
of emperors.
hime Princess. Applied to female deities and women of high rank.
honji-suijaku The theological idea, evolved in the Heian period, that Japanese
kami were local expressions of the Buddhas, who were the universal
expression of the kami. This idea formed the basis for Ryπbu Shintπ.
honke Main, or stem, family of a dπzoku. The Imperial family is sometimes
312 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



considered the honke of the Japanese people, who are viewed in their
entirety as a sort of “super dπzoku.”
hum The final word. The sound that brings about the end of the universe. The
last word of the Buddhist creed “Om ma ne pad me hum.”
ie The fundamental building block of Japanese society, ie consists of the
current occupants of a household—spouses and their children—and all
deceased ancestors and unborn descendants. Where no children are born, ie
members will adopt outsiders to continue the ie; thus it does not correspond
exactly to non-Japanese concepts of family.
Immortals A group of sages from Chinese mythology who, following the
Daoist concept of “the Way,” have found immortality. Six such immortals,
including Lotse, are denizens of Heaven, though not a part of the heavenly
bureaucracy. The idea was also translated into the Japanese experience,
albeit as a minor theme.
in Japanese pronunciation of the Sanskrit “om.” See om.
inau Used in Ainu culture, a stick representing the deity formed by shaving
strips off a wand but leaving them intact at the top. Different forms of
shaving and curling represented different kamui. The inau itself was an
offering to the kamui, a representation of the kamui, and a kamui itself,
mediating between humans and the kamui. Inau were generally placed in a
row on the northeast side of the house, forming a sort of sacred fence.
-ji Suffix indicating a Buddhist temple, for example, Enryakuji.
jing∆ A central Shintπ shrine. There are a few shrines with this title in Japan,
the main ones being the shrine to Amaterasu-π-mikami at Ise (Ise-jing∆) and
the new shrine to the Meiji emperor in Tokyo (Meiji-jing∆).
jinja A Shintπ shrine. Shrine names might also end with the term -jing∆, -g∆,
-taisha, or -miya.
kamui Ainu deity. The word is related to the Japanese kami.
kamui yukar “God Epic.” An Ainu song, of varied length, which tells a tale,
usually in first person, about a deity and its adventures. These were sung as
both entertainment and ritual during Ainu feasts.
kang Ryukyuan deity. The word is related to Japanese kami.
kebπzu Hairy Buddhist priest. A name given colloquially to the yamabushi
and other Shugendπ practitioners because they acted as priests and yet did
not shave their heads as other Buddhist priests did.
kπji Buddhist practitioner who does not become a monk. In a traditional
Buddhist story, Yuima-kπji was so eloquent in telling the Law that the
Buddha sent Monju-bosatsu to visit him when Monju was ill. Yuima and
Monju are therefore often represented together.
kotan Domain. Ainu families and clans each controlled a domain, usually a
Glossary 313



river valley or stream, which was their main hunting and gathering ground.
Such kotan were sanctified by custom and defended vigorously. Kotankor
Kamui was the deity of the domain, ensuring that the Ainu used their
usufruct rights wisely.
kunitsu-kami The Earthly deities. Those deities who were bound to the Earth
or were born there. Usually associated with a particular location. It is likely
that these were the deities of polities assimilated or conquered by the
Yamato. The most powerful among them is probably ∏kuninushi, who
seems to have been a chief deity among the Izumo, the Yamato’s main rivals.
kut A narrow (one to two inches) woven girdle worn by Ainu women. Each
matrilineage (women owning descent by birth from a common ancestress)
had a specific design and way to tie the kut. The kut were a secret. Many
men were unaware of them, or professed to be unaware. Each mother
instructed her daughters in the proper weaving. A woman could not have
the same kut as her mother-in-law. Thus marital negotiations were the
responsibility of the women of the community, which afforded them a great
degree of power.
Little Traditions The traditions of local communities, often of the powerless
and the illiterate. These traditions may show an overall cultural continuity
from one place in a culture to another but differ widely in details.
lotus A water plant that grows without soil and produces a large flower with
an enchanting scent. In mythology, the lotus flower, bud, and sometimes
seed represent the Buddhist Law, which like the lotus has no earthly roots.
A number of Buddhist deities—Kannon is one prominent example—carry a
lotus branch or flower.
mana A religious concept deriving from most Polynesian religions. Mana is an
impersonal immanent power that humans and gods possess to differing
degrees. It is both beneficial (when handled correctly, with rituals and
respect) and dangerous (when mishandled). Anthropologists use the term to
identify similar concepts from other parts of the world.
mandara Mandala (Sanskrit). A picture illustrating, in visual/cartoon form, the
main Buddhist principles. They usually show the major Buddha (of
whichever sect drew the mandara) surrounded by lesser Buddhas and items
representing esoteric concepts of the sect. There are a large number of them,
the two most important ones in Japan being the Diamond mandara and the
Womb mandara.
marebito Wandering visitors. A term usually applied to mysterious kami who
arrived from afar, sometimes from the land of Tokoyo. Many Shintπ rituals
are addressed to marebito, who are mysterious, powerful, and, most
important, visit only to leave again.
314 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



matsurareru kami Named kami that are celebrated and recognized as
individuals.
miko A shrine maiden in Shintπ shrines. Miko perform sacred dances, assist at
rituals, and in some cases perform divination or enter into possession
trances. They are different from female kannushi (priests) since this is
usually a temporary position from which they retire upon marriage.
mitama Spirit, soul, or nature, usually of a deity. Each deity has three mitama:
aramitama (rough and wild), nigimitama (gentle and life-supporting), and
sakimitama (nurturing).
mudra A hand gesture used in esoteric Buddhism. There are several hundred
of these, some with exoteric meanings such as compassion or protection,
others with more esoteric meanings.
Nembutsu The formula “Namu Amida Butsu (Hail the Buddha Amida)”
repeated as an act of faith by followers of Amidist sects in Japan. Frequent
repetition is considered a sure path to salvation.
om The first word. The sound that brought forth the universe. Also the first
word of the Buddhist creed “Om ma ne pad me hum.”
rakan Arhats. A stage in Buddhist progression where one is free of all passions,
this state has been achieved by all of Shakyamuni’s original disciples. In
Japanese belief, however, the term is applied to only sixteen named
individuals, more or less equivalent to the Apostles.
ramat Ainu spirit, usually of a kamui (deity).
rπnin Masterless bushi who did not owe loyalty to a lord. The word means
“wave-man,” meaning someone who is unattached, wild, free.
Ryπbu Shintπ Two schools Shintπ. A theological concept that held that
Shintπ and Buddhist deities are both to be worshipped, and which fused both
religions into one. Abolished formally by Meiji-era government edicts. See
also honji-suijaku.
samurai Members of the bushi class who were retainers of a lord. The word
means “temple guard,” and the position originated during the Heian period
when samurai were sent to serve kokubunji (provincial temples).
sarariman “Salary man.” A white-collar worker in modern Japan. Sometimes
extolled as the modern samurai, whose loyalty is to his firm rather than a
feudal lord.
seishin-ichi The idea that Buddhist and Shintπ deities were one and the same;
a simplified concept of honji-suijaku.
-sennin (rishi) Hermit. Sage. Immortal (Daoist). Usually applied to individuals
such as famous abbots, hermits, or wonder workers. The title is appended to
the names of sages, usually of Chinese Daoist origins.
seppuku Honorable suicide. An option available to members of the bushi class
Glossary 315



who had transgressed in certain ways, had lost in battle, or who wished to
follow their master into death. The acceptable method was a self-inflicted
abdominal cut (hence the popularly vulgar name harakiri) followed by
beheading by a trusted friend or retainer.
shakujπ A staff topped by four to twelve steel rings set in a stupa-shaped
capital. By thumping on the floor the rings sound, and the carrier can
announce his presence, thus allowing insects and other small animals to
remove themselves from harm. The sound also dispels evil. Carried by Jizπ
in the netherworld, it calls the souls of unborn and dead children to him,
where he can offer them his mercy and aid.
-shonin A title applied to important Buddhist abbots and senior priests,
particularly those known for piety and the working of miracles. The best
known is Nichiren, founder of the Nichiren sect.
Shugendπ A syncretic religious sect still practiced in Japan, based on a mixture
of Shingon, Tendi, and Shintπ beliefs and practices. Practitioners, generally
termed shugensha or yamabushi, practice group austerities, special magical
rituals such as firewalking, and mountain pilgrimages. Shugendπ preaches
that salvation is to be found in magical words and in purification. Mountain
pilgrimages seek to replicate the Buddhist act of ascending Mt. Meru. Shintπ
kami are celebrated as avatars of Buddhist deities, notably Fudπ Myπ-π.
shugensha Shugendπ practitioner.
sonja “Eminent priest.” A title bestowed on some Buddhist venerable beings,
such as Binzuru-sonja, and on rakan, individuals who have almost reached
the rank of Buddha.
sumo A form of competitive wrestling by large, well-fleshed professional
wrestlers that remains popular today. In the Heian period it was used as a
form of divination. Sumo today is still highly ritualized, with the bout
taking place in a structure resembling a Shintπ shrine, the ring being
purified with salt, and each wrestler performing a shiki—raising his feet
alternatively in the air and bringing them forcefully down, to evoke the
power of the earth.
sutras The canons of the Buddhist law. They consist of a large number of
volumes that include the Buddha’s preaching, commentaries, records of his
life, and various anecdotes concerning him and his activities. There is no
agreed-on list, and each Buddhist sect, in Japan and elsewhere, chooses from
the collection those books it wishes particularly to expound on.
-ten A class of deities, many of Indian origin, who function to protect the
Buddhist Law.
tsumi Sin. A very important concept in Shintπ, tsumi implies a polluting
action. In consequence of tsumi, the perpetrator is likely to suffer
316 Handbook of Japanese Mythology



punishment, which can only be avoided by performing purification, such as
ablution, fasting, and making offerings to the offended deity/spirit. Even the
deities can commit tsumi, as witnessed by Susano-wo’s destruction of the
dikes.
ujigami Clan deity. Ujigami are the particular deity worshipped by a
household (ie) or an extended collection of households (dπzoku) as their
primary family deity. Ujigami will appear in dreams to warn or foretell, and
they will protect the family, provided they are worshipped appropriately.
Common ujigami are Inari, Ryujin, and Fudπ Myπ-π. Amaterasu-π-mikami
is, of course, also the ujigami of Japan’s imperial household.
utaki Okinawan term for a sacred grove in which the priestesses commune
with the kang using appropriate rituals.
yamabushi “One who sleeps in the mountains”: an ascetic and practitioner of
Shugendπ. Yamabushi may be the model for tengu.
yashikigami “House deity.” The patron deity of a household, particularly of a
bushi family. Yashikigami are usually worshipped in private by members of
the family.
yo Japanese pronunciation of the Sanskrit hum. See hum.
