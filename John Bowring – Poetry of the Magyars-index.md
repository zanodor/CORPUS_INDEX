PREFACE.
I SHOULD think with less concern of the
delay which has taken place since the an
nouncement of this Volume, if I believed I
had succeeded even to the extent of my
own anticipations in producing a work of
interest and value. Nothing can be more
indulgent than the criticisms which, from
time to time, have noticed the attempts I
have made to bring the Poetry of other
lands to the hearths and homes of England.
I can truly say, had I myself been the critic
they would have been judged with far greater
severity. Another race of poets are now
candidates in my hands for the good opi
nion of my countrymen; but on this occa

sion the claim to a candid, to a forbearing
judgment, is stronger than I have ever before
had to urge.
The Magyar language stands afar off
and alone. The study of other tongues will
be found of exceedingly little use towards
its right understanding. It is moulded in
a form essentially its own, and its construc
tion and composition may be safely referred
to an epoch when most of the living tongues
of Europe either had no existence, or no in
fluence on the Hungarian region.
Distance, too, has made the mission of
books, and even the communication of ideas,
tardy, uncertain, and expensive. Many
valuable documents have been lost, or have
lingered beyond the period when I could
employ them usefully. One delay becomes

the parent of many, and in the mean time
the mind gets diverted, as mine has too
frequently been, to other and more imme
diately attractive topics. My book goes
forward, then,
" With all its imperfections on its head."
They would have been many more but for
the watchful care of my friend M A Y E R , to
whom I offer this public testimony of my
thanks.
There are some, I know, who look upon
the occupations of a Translator as ignoble and
unworthy of literary ambition. I am well
content to stand at respectful distance from
those great intellects whose works are borne
on the wings of an all-pervading fame to
every country where the ear of civilization
is listening. Yet I cannot believe that my



Vlll PREFACE.
humble labors are useless, nor have I ever
wanted, and I hope I never shall want while
health is vouchsafed to me, both encourage
ment and enthusiasm to pursue them. My
mission, at all events, is one of benevolence.
I have never left the ark of my country
but with the wish to return to it, bearing
fresh olive branches of peace and fresh gar
lands of poetry. I never yet visited the
land where I found not much to love, to
learn, to imitate, to honor. I never yet saw
man utterly despoiled of his humanities.
In Europe, at least, there are no moral nor
intellectual wildernesses. Let others go
forth with me to gather its fruits and
flowers.
J. B.



TO
FR. J. SCHEDEL.
I FOLLOW in thy footsteps, yet afar; Thou hear'st the voice—I but the echoes hear, Of the time-consecrated Magyar; And while they vibrate in my spirit, bear The music, ere it dies upon the ear, To the old halls of England—where there are Spirits of love, of sympathy sincere, To welcome, as from some new-beaming star, All I can bring of beauty, light, and song. Say to Hungaria, she shall stand among The lands which Poetry with glory girds; And if not mine, some happier lot 'twill be To fling the wreath of fame o'er her and thee, With sweeter harmony and loftier words.

INTRODUCTION.
AFTER a long period of inertness and almost of oblivion, the language and literature of Hungary seem starting into a new and vigorous existence. A band of distinguished writers have appeared with the present generation, whose privilege it has been at once to will and to effect the regeneration of their native idiom, which had been sinking under the indifference of some and the attacks of others. Its history has been marked by many vicissitudes. Originating in an age too remote to be defined or even discovered, and receiving from time to time infusions from the various tribes and tongues who have visited or been visited by the Magyar race, it has yet retained all its essential peculiarities, and offers to the inquirer some of the most curious topics of research. Space, however, will allow nothing here but a 62



IV INTRODUCTION.
slight sketch of some of its more remarkable characteristics. The roots of the Magyar are for the most part exceedingly simple and monosyllabic, but their ramifications are numerous, consistent, and beautiful. I know of no language which presents such a variety of elementary stamina, and none which lends itself so easily and gracefully to all the modifications growing out of its simple principles. These modifications are almost always postfixed, and invariably they harmonize with the preceding part of the word. The accent is not necessarily on the root of a word, which in verbs is to be sought in the third person singular of the present tense. The analogy between words and things is very striking and not only extends to objects with which sound is associated, but sometime* is observable even to the eye. Dorog (it thunders) affects the ear; villdm (it lightens) has an obvious propriety even in the appearance of the words. Many noises are admirably represented by the words which convey the idea; as, four (it boils), t&r (it breaks), cseng (it rings), peng (it rings, i. e. speaking of coins), hang (sound). No eight monosyllables in any language could convey a more complete image of the horrors of war than does Kisfaludy's verse:



THE MAGYAR LANGUAGE.
Mars mord duhe a' rait e*r, vag, Bont, dort, t6r, ront, dul^uj
The voices of animals are alfeo represented by characteristic words — the bear morog, the lion ardit, the owl huhong, the cock kukorit, the bull bombol, the cow bog, the goat me/ceg, the lamb beget, the pig rdfbg, the goose gdgog.
The most remarkable character of the Magyar, and that which gives and preserves avi euphony beyond the reach of any other language, is the ^. separation of the vowels into two classes—a, o ^ male, and e5 i, 5, and u, female; while each class possesses a separate set of instruments for creating all conjugates.f If the last syllable of a word have, for example, a masculine vowel, the affix must be made to agree with it. A wonderful uniformity of character and harmony of sound
* The murderous rage of Mars, which, whatever it reaches, cuts, Wastes, shakes, breaks, destroys, uprends, scatters, and slays.
t Verseghi divides the vowels into four classes, which he caHs, 1, Base-vowels—a, o, and u. 2, Tenor-vowels^—6 and ii. 3, Alt-vowel—e. 4, Discant-vowel—i. The first, he says, must have a base-vowel for its suffix. The second and third cau never take a suffix from the first. The fourth is neutral, and sometimes takes a suffix from all the others.



VI I N T R O D U C T I O N .
are the necessary consequence of this simple and appropriate machinery. Thus, for example, ando and endo are the signs of the participle future, and are used the first for the male, as hal, root of halal (death), makes halando, will die, or dieable; and the second for the female, as 6g, root of 4gni (to burn), 4gendo, will burn, or burnable—as and es, as olvasds (reading), from the root olvas, reads—and szenved4s (suffering), from szenved suffers — at and et, as gondolat (thought), from gondol, thinks—4pulet (a building), from 4pul, builds. So, again, the comparative is formed of abb or ebb, according to the ultimate syllable; as drdga dear, drdgdbb dearer —boles wise, bolcsebb wiser. Sag and s4g make a quality from a personification—bardlsdg, friendship, from barat, friend—embers^g, manhood, from ember, man: talan, telm^ denote absence; as, szobdtalan, without a chamber—k&retlen, unasked, i. e. without asking. And so are the Hungarian plurals, according to the vowels of the singular, formed in ok, ok, or eh. The same modification runs through all the declensions and conjugations. This division of the language into male and female words may be pursued in its influences to some very curious results. It will be found that the letters a and o are usually employed in the words to which the ideas of grandeur, vastness,

weight,'and pomp, attach, such as t6, the lake; nap, the sun; hold, the moon; t&bor, a camp; had, war—that e and i occur where swiftness or alacrity are denoted; as, vig, gay; vidit, to exhilirate—that disagreeable associations are usually connected with u; as, rut, ugly; buta, stupid; bu, grief: o and u generally represent vagueness and confusion; as, goz, vapor; fust, smoke; sottt, dark; godor, ditch; surii, thick. So the short vowels for the most part express rapidity, and the long ones slowness; as sebes, hasty; ropul,to fly; szalad, to run—lassu, slow; csusz, creeps ; mdsz, crawls. In the same manner it will be found that the hard and soft consonants are adapted to the different ideas conveyed; as for example, kb, stone; Jeard, sabre; durva, rude; while Idgy, anya, ledny, soft, mother, girl, have a sweetness suited to the objects they represent.*
* A very curious example of two distinct meanings to the same syllables, wheu differently arranged, is given in the Sz6p Literaturai Ajandek, for 1820, p. 65. Boris te ! nem amor ostoba Nyila zftrOmb&l. Tsoje Meg tompult a* langon. Domboru t4n Bora kedvelloje.
Bor Istene ! mamoros toba Nyil az BrSra bolts^je Megtouipul talan gondom Por utan. Bor a' kedv EUoje.



Vlii INTRODUCTION.
Whatever changes the language, brought by the Magyars into Europe, has undergone in consequence of their intercourse with their neighbours, the construction has been little changed, and retains its Asiatic forms. The words which have been introduced have mostly undergone an Hungarian modification, and of late the language has obtained a decided mastery over the Latin, which, for mauy centuries, had been the instrument of law and literature. That it presents many difficulties to the student, is certain. It has sounds which, though they may be collected from other languages, are combined in none — the French eu, u, and j , the German 6 and u$ the Spanish 1], fi, the Russian XJ and J H , the Italian gi, and many others. Then again its Eastern peculiarities. Its precision, however, facilitates the right understanding of it, as do the simple and efficient rules by which all its conjugates are made. Of any adjective an active verb may be formed by the addition of etni, and a substantive by the addition of sdg or s£g. The same form of conjugates is used for substantives, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, and verbs. These conjugates are simple additions to, and never alterations of, the root, and are throughout postpositions, which sometimes, when gathered up one after another, pre

sent a curious aspect; as Idt (sees), the root; ldthaty he can see; Idtds (seeing or sight); Idto, the seeer (the prophet); Idtni, to see; Idtatlan, unseen; Idthato, seeable; Idthatosdg, seeableness; IdtatatIan, unseeable; Idthattalak, I might have seen thee; Idthatatlansdg, unseeableness; Idthatatlonokrtdk, to the unseeable (pi. Dat.). In the Magyar alphabet the y, after g, 1, n, and t, produces that sound which melts into the following letter; as, in French, gn, 11, in montaghe, medaille: cs, ts, are equivalent to our ch; sz, to 8; zs, to the French j ; tz or cz to z\ and s to the English sh. The effect of an accent is to lengthen the vowel; 6 and u (d and li, or 6' and t? long) have nearly the sounds of the French eu and w. The whole number of sounds in the Magyar is thirty-eight, and their orthography, like that of all the Gothic and Slavonic nations, has to struggle with the imperfections of the Roman alphabet in representing sounds unknown to the Latins. The characteristic of the Latin alphabet is poverty, and its inconvenience and inaptitude to many of the idioms into which it has been introduced, are very striking. It is thus that strangers are so perplexed with our two th'e, as in thing and that; the \> and the $ of the Anglo Saxons, the 0 and

the 8 of the modern Greeks. If the Polish and Bohemian tongues present a strange appearance to the eye, it arises from the blending together of many consonants to represent a single sound. The letters c, q, and x, are wanting to the Magyar alphabet. Some of the inconveniences of the small number of letters are avoided by accents. In the word Grtelem, for example, the e has three distinct sounds. The introduction of an accent frequently gives a word a completely different signification.—Sas9 eagle; sds, reed; szii, woodworm; szu, heart; por, dust; por9 peasant. So again many words have two meanings; as, ido, time and weather; h6t> week and seven; nap, sun and day.—These, however, bear the obvious names of original identity. The native Hungarian cannot combine two consonants in the same syllable. The words in the language which present such a combination are foreign. The presence of many consonants in a word is always a source of difficulty to foreigners, and is one of the main sources of modifications. In Spanish, 5 followed by a consonant has almost always an e, making another syllable before it; Z89estrada9 for strada; espada, for spada: so the Magyar iskola for school.



THE MAGYAR LANGUAGE. XI
In the Finnic branches of language some very extraordinary changes will be found, produced by this circumstance. And in Hungarian scarcely less; as, Gorog, Greek; Ferencz, Francis. The Magyar is absolutely devoid of genders, and the female sex is always expressed by a distinct word.* It has only a definite article, az, ez9\ which is at the same time a demonstrative pronoun. It has only one'declension, and the possessive pronouns are suj/txa to the nouns, as are the personal pronouns to the verbs, modifying both nouns and verbs to a singular uniformity; as for example,
szeretet, love; szeretetem, my love; szeretettlnk, our love. szeretni, to love; szeretem, I love; szeretiink, we love. szereteted, thy love; szeretetek, your love. szeretedy thoulovcst; szerettek, you love. szeretete, his love; szereti, he loves.
Gibbon says, that " the Hungarian bears a close and clear affinity to the idiom of the' Fennic race, i. e. the Finnish, Laplancfish, and Bsthonian." He is an indifferent authority in philological matters. The words of identity are really few—far fewer than will be found common to the

XII INTRODUCTION.
Magyar and German, or even the Magyar and Latin. There are some curious affinities, but they are not peculiar in the construction of the Finnish and the Hungarian : the copulative conjunctions, prepositions, interrogative adverbs, and possessive pronouns, are all postfixed to the nouns. The adjectival termination es, and the possessive em, are common to the Lappish and the Magyar. The Magyar mene, and the Esthonian minne, are conjugates of substantives denoting action, and k6 is a diminutive in both. The Hungarian end Finmark plural nominative ak, ek, are identical; in Finuish the plural is formed by h. Ber.egassi's work* has traced the affinities of the Magyar into twenty eastern and half the number of western languages. Gyarmathf has written with extreme minuteness on the resemblance between the Hungarian and the Finnish. He produces a number of words ending, for the most part, in as, es, is, os, and ad, which are common to both. Neither has any gender, and they each form their com

parative in b. Every noun may in both be formed into a verb, while the verbs of both have some of those peculiar tenses which are not very easily translatable into English ; as for example,
LaplawiUh. Etsab Etsam Etschtattam Etsahtallam Etsehtam Etsatzjatu Etseelam
Etseslam Etsolestara Etsehtattatlam

Gyarmath thus Latmizes. amo. amavi. amor. maxime amo. euro at amet. frequenter amo. frequenter quidem sed nimus amo. amo aliquautulum omnium minime amo. facio ut alterum ?aepe et diu amet.
In Finnish, Laplandish, and Hungarian, the adjectives precede the nouns, except where a verb interposes. The singular number follows all numerals, as kilentz nap9 nine day, not nine days. In both a superlative idea is often communicated by a repetition of the positive noun, as kieura, kieura al?nats, (Lap.,) Eros eros ember, (Hung.,) a strong, strong man. The verb to have is wanting in the two branches; possession is expressed by, to be to9 Le musne kirje, (Lap.,) van nekem kdnyvem—A book is to me, u e. I have a book. Both frequently suppress the verb to be, as J6 az, that (is) good, and both employ it in the ge

rundial form for the present of the infinite, Evuben vagyok, (Hung.,) Lden porriem, (Lap.,) I am eating.* The Esthonian and Hungarian pronouns have a strong resemblance.
Esthonian Hungarian

ke ki who
kegi kiki whoever
ininna en I
mere mi we
teie ti you
And in their expressions of endearment there is much similarity of phrase, as Kulla Herra, (Est.,) Aranyos Uram, (Hung.,) My golden Sir ! The affinities with some of the remoter idioms, are very remarkable. The word atya, father, is (as is well known) one found in a variety of different tongues, though I suspect its resemblance to the first lispings of a child is the secret of its extension. But blended with a possessive pronoun, the affinities are extraordinary.

The prosody of the Magyar is very remarkable. There is no measure of Latin or Greek rytbmus to which it does not lend itself. Pyrrhics and Spondees abound. The tribrach and mdldssus are not wanting; and all the intermixtures of long and short feet, Iambics, Trochees, Dactylg, and anapests. Vir&g's Magyar Prosodia & Magyar Irds>* contains specimens of every classical measure. Other specimens of the adaptation of the Magyar may be found in his Poesia, at the end of his Tragedy of Hunyadi Ld$zlo.\ The first example of measured verse is of the date of 1541. The dialects of Hungary are not much unlike;

and there is no part of the country where the Magyar is so spoken, as not to be intelligible in every other part. The varieties are principally in confounding a and o, and 6 and i, and in lengthening the syllables and words. Two prize Essays, one by Horv&t, and the other by G&ti, on the Dialects of the Hungarian, were published in 1821. The two most distinct idioms are those of Raab and Bihar. The Transylvanians, especially the Sz£kely, have a drawling manner of pronouncing words which is very singular. They are of Tatar origin, and have preserved a greater number of their original terms.* The Hungarians invariably write the baptismal after the family name. Thus, Thaisz Andrds (Andrew Thaisz, the translator of the Scottish Romances) ; this rule even extends to foreign names, as in the title to these translations, Scott Walter Romdnjai. Hungarian women do not abandon their family names when they marry. As in every other tongue of ancient date, a demand for new words, accommodated to an advanced cultivation, has been felt in the Hungarian.

reign kings, the Hungarian was employed for laws and ordinances, and was used as the Court language under Charles and Louis of Anjou. There is a Magyar partition-document, dated 1339. There are, too, Hungarian oaths sometimes attached to Latin laws, for the better understanding of the people. The form of the Coronation Appeal, used at this epoch by the Primate of the kingdom, the Archbishop of Gran, to the assembled orders, is still preserved. Three times he demanded Akarjdtok 4 hogy e% jelenlevo N. N. Mrdlysdgra kormdztdsstk, " Will you that N. N. here present be crowned for our king?" And the answer thrice repeated was, Akarjuk 4ljen> 4ljen> 61/en, a9 kirdly—" We will,—Live, live, live the king." There have been from time to time royal declarations in favour of the Hungarian language. In 1527) Ferdinand the First publicly declared that " he would preserve the Magyar tongue and people with all his power and means;" and, in 1569, there is in the statutes of Maximilian the following words: " E t casu quo suam majestatem a regno longius abesse contingeret unum ex filiis loco sui et si usque possibile sit, in Ungaria ut linguam quoque gentis addiscant, relinquere." The Princes of the Habsburgh House have



THE MAGYAR LANGUAGE. XXI
given all possible encouragement to the predominance of the German tongue in Hungary. As there has been for centuries no kingly court at Buda, the language has suffered something from the want of that protection which fashion communicates. The Emperor Joseph issued a Hungarian decree during the tumults which disturbed his reign 5 and, in 1790* the Diet encouraged the language by a specific law ; but the Diet has not ventured to make the Magyar the recognized language for official communication. Something like this was anticipated from their last assembly in 1825-27, but the public expectation was disappointed. There are many Hungarian grammars, of which the oldest is that of John Erdosi, printed at Vissigath, in 1539. Another was published by Albert Moln&r in 1610, of which an improved edition appeared at Vienna in 1788. Meliboi's Ungarischer Sprachnieister, (Presburg, 1787, 6th ed.,) and Jos. Farkas' Grundliche und Neu Perbesserte Ungarische Sprachlehre, originally printed in 1771, have been reprinted from time to time, the latter with additions and amendments by P. de Kis Szonto, and Jos. von M&rton. Sam. Gyarmath's Kritische Grammatik, in 2 vols., is a more elaborate production; and Paul Bersgszdszis Persuck einer Magyarischen Sprachlehre has a

particular view to the affinities between the Hungarian and the Oriental tongues. This is also the object of Verseghi's A9 tiszta Magyarsag, or " the pure Hungarian tongue," which has led to a philological controversy, in which he has been attacked by Joh. Miklosi, in a volume entitled Verseghi Ferentz nek Tisztdtalan Magyarsdga, or Fr. Verseghi's impure Hungarian Tongue.* Jos. von M&rton's Hungarian and German Dictionary is the best.

Various are the opinions respecting the origin of the Hungarian people. Dr. F. Thomas has written three volumes to prove them to be descended from the ancient Egyptians.* The word Hungariai is of Mogol root, and was originally Ugur or Ingur, meaning foreigner or stranger. The Hungariai denominate themselves and their language Magyar, which was undoubtedly the name of one of the tribes from which they sprung. In the fourth century they took possession of the land of the Bashkir (Tartars), between the Volga, Tobol, and Jaik. They were subdued by the Turks in the sixth century; and in the seventh, eighth, and ninth, they associated themselves with the Chazars in Lebedia, (now the province of Katherinoslav,) and subsisted by robbery and ravage. In the middle of the ninth century they

were called in by Ratislaw, Duke of Moravia, to assist him against the Germans; and not long after, their territory being intruded on by the Pechenegers, they took up their abode under the Carpathian mountains, and combined with King Arnulf against their former Moravian allies. In their absence the Bulgarians had devastated their province, and they took possession of a part of Galicia, but afterwards broke through the Carpaths towards Munkacb, attacked the Bulgarians on the river Theiss, and seized a part of Pannoriia. They were at this period composed of seven tribes, of which the Magyar waa the strongest, and ultimately gave its name to all the rest. A part of the race still occupied Bashkiria, and are mentioned by Carpini in 1246, and Rubrivis in 1251, who speak of them as having originally gone forth from the Bashkirs. In our time, however, no fragments of the Magyar language are left in Bashkiria, though Von Orlay reports that one of the Caucasian tribes is still called Ugrkhi (Hungarians) by the Russians, and uses an Hungarian dialect. Among the Hungarians it has always been a favorite theory to consider themselves as Huns, with little other reason than the similarity of name. The Huns were undoubtedly a Mongolian race, and nothing can

be more unlike than the languages, characters, persons, and habits, of the Hungarians and the Mongolians. Of late, a theory that the Hungarians and Finlanders have a common origin, has found many intelligent advocates; but probably nothing more than the orientalism of both can be deduced from the affinities of their language. We know little of Etele (Attila), except from testimony which must be received with the greatest distrust. Priscus Rhetor, who was sent by Theodosius the Second to the Court of Etele, speaks of the fondness of the Huns for their native language, and of the festal songs in which, after their festivals, the deeds of their heroes were celebrated in so touching a style, that the aged men of the assembly shed many tears. He mentions also, that when Etele returned to his castle, he was met by maidens in white veils, who greeted him with Scythian hymns. During the reign of the Arpadian kings, which brings us down to the beginning of the 14th century, (Andreas Veneta having been poisoned in 1301,) many are the references to the Joculators and Trufators,* the IJoets and Jesters, who were always to be found

about the person of the monarch. And Galeotti, the librarian of King Matthias, asserts that his father, the celebrated John Hunyadi, awakened the martial spirit of his master by the hero-songs which he caused to be recited to him. " At table too," he says, " musicians and cithara players sung the deeds of valiant warriors in their native tongue to the music of the lyre—an usage," he continues, " brought from Rome, and which passed from us (Italians) even to the Hungarians/'* At this period the literary influence of Italy upon Hungary was very remarkable, and Dante has expressed in his Paradise a bright anticipation for the

But of this period little remains, except such scattered notices and fragments as are scarcely remarkable enough to occupy a place in this brief t notice. Simon von Reza is the first of the Hungarian Chroniclers. His history is from the earliest times down to the end of the thirteenth century.

John von Kukiillo wrote the Life of Lewis the First, 1342—1382, and John De Turocz published a Chronicle of the Kingdom of Hungary down to the year 1473, in which he has introduced, word for word, the writings of his above-mentioned predecessors, as well as the Chronicon Budense of an anonymous author printed at Buda in 1473.* The battle of Moh&cs (1526) is the "Dies ire" of the Hungarians, and its story of defeat and humiliation is more melancholy from its so immediately following a period of hope and of brightness. Hungary had been enlightened by the efforts of her own sons, and by the influx of illustrious strangers, as if merely to contrast with the darkness of Turkish oppression. The Reformation which soon after this period broke in upon the land, did much for the language. The spirit of Lutheranism was essentially popular. Its instrument, the vernacular tongue, especially represented in that mighty machine of knowledge and of power, the Press, whose efforts have changed and continue to change the character of nations, and which acts as a security against their permanent decline and fall, began to exert its beneficial influences.

XXX INTRODUCTION.
In the sixteenth century many printing presses existed in Hungary. The great circulation of the Bible in the vernacular tongue produced a great demand for books. In the cities of Bartfeld, Debretzen, V&rad, Neusoh), Kassa, were printing establishment* supported by the public, and the Magnates assisted those of Detrekd, Ujszigeth, Galg6cz, Als6hendra, N^methujvar, and Papa. In the following century presses were erected in Trentsin, Silein, Senitz, Puchov, LeutschfftJ, and Csessreg. No censorship existed in any shape during this periods The names of Magyar authors begin now to thicken, and a list of chroniclers and poets occupy the pages of literary story. The works of this period are for the most part biographical and his* torical.* The poetry can hardly be said to be much elevated above dull and sober prose, the ars poetica of the age being little more than the art of making common-place sentences dance tg the jingle of a rhyme. The best poet of the day was Tinodi, who wrote both foreign and domestic history, and who does not seem to have had patronage enough to exalt him even above bodily sufferings for in a single verse, which he

introduces more than once, he gives a description of himself which brings him and his misery pictorially before us. It may thus be rendered:
This was written in his chamber by the penniless Tinddi, Often blowing on his fingers, for the cold was in his body.*
TIN6DI flourished in the middle of the sixteenth century. He was employed as a literatus in the suite of Valentine Torok, who being led captive by the Turks to the seven towers, left his poor bard to wander over Hungary and Transylvania. His works were collected by himself into two small quarto volumes in 1554. BALASSA (born 1550, died 1594) has a few compositions of some energy and feeling, and one or two of his warlike songs are martial and fiery. He fell in the siege of Gran. How many of the poets of war have been its victims! His first introduction to notice was on occasion of the crowning of Rudolf at Presburg in 1572, when he exhibited a grotesque peasant dance to the court, exciting, says his biographer, the wonder of the royal family and of all who saw him. His love for poetry is manifest from the pieces he wrote

amidst the clang of arms, a few days before his death. Some dramatic writers belong to this epoch. Karadi's Balassa Mmyhdrt and Boniemisza's Klytemiestra are the most remarkable. A few years after, we find a description of the sort of plays performed in Transylvania. " Hinc publics fabulee exhibit® et comaedise expugnationem Caniszensem, Turcarum trepidationem fugam et futuram stragem, represententes." But both tragedies and comedies were represented by strolling players, both in Hungarian and Latin, to which the Jesuits contributed a great number. RIMAI is not without some merit as a didactic and meditative poet. He was a contemporary of Balassa, though the exact dates are unknown of his birth and death. ERDOSI made the first attempt tVbreak through the fetters which rhymes imposed upon the Magyar poets, and to introduce the classical prosodial forms. The Bohemians had attempted this before, and the first Sapphics of the Germans are of the year 1537. In 1541, Erdosi wrote his " A* Magyar nepnek Id czt olvassa" an address to such of the Magyars as would read it, in flowing hexameters. He had for a long time no followers, and the singular aptitude of the Hungarian Ian

guage for the Greek and Roman measures, seems to have continued unobserved for nearly two centuries longer. ZRINYI appeared at a period which several nations are disposed to claim as the golden age of their literature. He was born in the year in which Shakspeare and Cervantes died—the proud era of Italy, England, Spain, and Portugal. Zrinyi is, however, the founder of the modern poetry of the Magyars. In 1651, appeared his Zriniad, an epic poem, the produce of those hours which military and civil service left him in his busy existence. His verses, consisting of four lines of twelve syllables, with a common rhyme, have given a name to this peculiar stanza. Little can be said in favor of his language, style, or versification. They are careless and incorrect, and his battle descriptions are tedious indeed. Yet are his conceptions bold and strong. His portraits are well drawn, and his groupings happy. Hi9 facility of writing led him astray; yet, withal, he is undoubtedly far above any poet that had preceded him, or any that followed, for a century at least. In some of hid shorter poems there is evidence of a playful and busy fancy. He was the representative of a family of great antiquity, and was the son of that Ban of Croatia, who was d

poisoned by Wallenstein in 1626. It has been said that his sword had been stained with Turkish blood before he was ten years old; and that, in after times, crowds of Osmanlis rushed to see a hero, " the beautiful, tall, thin hero/9 who had been so much the object of their dread. There is an address of Solhnan to the Grand Vizier, in which he directs him not to desist from attack until he has captured Zrinyi, " the author of so much mischief/' Zrinyi fought and won many battles, but was killed by a wild boar on the 18th November, 1664. He had been covered with honours from many of the powers of Christendom, and was as distinguished for his learning as for bis courage. He spoke six languages, and was * master of the literaiure of ancient and modern times. The first edition of his works appeared at Vienna, in 4to., in 1651.* LISZTI, a man of considerable condition but of barren fancy, printed a long Epic, Mohdcsi vet-* zedelem, on the Moh&cs' defeat. It is in six-lined stanzas, the lines of six and seven syllables fol* lowing one another, and the whole effect intolerably monotonous. His Lyrics have not this defect* In 1659, on account of some charge made against him by the King's Fiscal, he was tried by • A'driai tengernek Syrenaja, Grof Zrinyi Miklos.

The songte of BENJCZKY, who lived in the be^ ginning of the seventeenth century, are not without merit. His P4ldabesx4dek (Proverb^) are excellent and condensed moral lessons. He was an Eques auratus, but complains in one of his poems of his defective education. Of his history little is known. Hi* works have been several times reprinted, and are popular among the middle orders. GyoNGYtisf deserves little praise except on account of his rhymes, which are generally perfect: He wrote with great facility; but he could not relieve himself from the trammels of ancient mythology, and he has little that is natural or characteristic about him. He has passages of beauty, and advanced the cultivation of his native tongue; but his allegories are often inappropriate, and his sentimentality not very natural. Gyftngydsi is supposed to have been born in 1620, ai*d from the early development of talent was called, as a page, to the Court of the Palatine in 1640.

obtained the favour of the then Palatine Eszterh&zy, and continued to hold different distinguished offices to the time of his death, having reached the age of eighty-four. His Kenu*nyiad> an epic poem, in four books and thirty cantos, was received with great enthusiasm, and his name was long one of the most honoured among Hungarian writers. In 1796* a complete edition of his works was published by Dugonics.* KOHARI did the service, with Beniczy,of breaking down the monotony of the Zrinian quartet rhyme. He is a moralist, " dwelling among the tombs/' and bringing the shortness and the nothingness of life to bear constantly on his moralities. He was born in 1648. He was in military service, and suffered all the miseries of dungeons and chains and cold and thirst and hunger. Delivered from imprisonment, he was received with marked distinction; but soon after, being again engaged in war, his right arm was shot away by the Turks. Charles the Third advanced him to high office—and that of Oberstreichsrichter, and gave him the privilege of employing a silver stamp for his signature, which is often mentioned as the Lamina Koharii, in the Corpus

Juris of Hungary. His Lyrics he published under the- Latin title of Tintinabulum Tripudiantium. Some of his poems we're translated into Latin by Sztr&kos, and he himself wrote in Latin elegantly, as is evidenced by his Chronolographica Budce composita (1706), and Antidota Me~ lancholwe (17*22). He spent the latest part of his life in his Castle of Cs&br&g, where he died in 1730, leaving a reputation for integrity, which has passed into a proverb. We come now to an epoch of absolute barrenness. The extinction of the Transylvanian Court was a serious blow to the Hungarian tongue 5 for its employment there made it the language of courtesy and of commerce. The constant attraction of Vienna drew away from the land of the Magyars those who might best have given encouragement to the idiom of their forefathers; and if they returned home, they returned with other tastes. Latin and German seemed gradually preponderating, and driving out the Magyar from the circle of civilization. But a reaction at last occurred, and we discover a marked revival of Magyar literature. Intercourse with Germany, which at first was the bane, became afterwards the blessing, of Hungary;

and the Writers who agitated Germany with a literary reformation, reflected back their influence upon the Magyars. And thenceforward, amidst some vicissitudes, a gradual progress may be traced to the present day; it is obvious the language has grown stroiiger and stronger by exercise, and its literature spread wider and wider by cultivation. Newspapers and literary journals in the Magyar tongue became active agents in its diffusion, and it slowly rose from that depression, that persecution rather, by which it had so long been vraited. RADAI, (P^L,) who figures in history as the negotiator of the peace of Shemnitz with Leopold the First, and the representative of Prince R&k6czi, who had been nominated by the French Court as the arbitrator between Peter the Great and Charles XII., and who struggled for the liberties of his fellotv-Protestants with so much zeal and talent, published a volutae of poetry, entitled LeM Hddolds, (Spiritual Worship,) which has preserved its hold on the affections of the Hungarians. AMADE was Paul Radai's contemporary, and was once deemed the first of Magyar Lyric Poets. His verses were learned hf heart, and circulated in MS. over the land. A few bave been printed by Kults&r, in his Mulatsdgok, (Amusements,

1827,) &»d others are in the progress of publication. They do not seem to possess any special valye. But FALCDI is the first poet on whose works it is possible to dwell with real satisfaction. He indeed awoke the Hungarian language, which was half-slumbering in his time. The Magyars speak of him as the Magyar poet. He caught the spirit of some of the Spanish poets, and has translated one at least of Gongora's romances. Bis Tundtrkerl (Enchanted Garden) is admirable. Few Lyrics flow more naturally and sweetly than his. They are music both to the eye and the ear. They are natural outpourings of a happy temper. One wishes the ancient mythology far away whenever it interrupts, as it frequently does, the current of his feelings. Faludi was a Jesuit, and spent some years at Rome. He taught Law afterwards in the Vienna Academy, translated Gra^ian, wrote a drama, and was made Librarian at Poson. He published a series of volumes on Manners, several of which were from translations from English. R£vai collected his works into two volumes, which appeared at Gydr (Raab) 1786-7* A second edition almost immediately followed. Faludi wrote Latin and French as well

as Magyar verges, and these also are to be found in bis works. GVADANYI is one of the few, the very few, comic poets of the Magyars. His account of die life, death, and journey to Tartarus, of a Tillage notary,* is witty and amusing, though not always in good taste. In his adventures of Count Beny6vsky, and his Paul Ronto, which are the delight of the lower orders of the Hungarians, he is coarse and vulgar, and his composition is throughout careless and incorrect. He was born at Rndab&nya in 1725, entered the army in his 19th year, made many campaigns, .and underwent the discipline of wounds and imprisonment; became a general in 1773, and died at Skaliz in 1801. BESSKNYEI has been accused of supplantiug a greater evil by a lesser one, instead of getting rid of both, when he drove out the Zrinian to introduce the Alexandrine measure. The charge appears to me well founded. The Alexandrine verse is one of the most monotonous of the

forms of poetry, and is especially monotonous in the Magyar, which, with its many poetical capabilities, undoubtedly wants variety in its ryhmes. But Bessenyei was the representative of the French school, and it has been said of him, as of many of the French dramatists, that his Greeks and Romans are all disfigured Frenchmen. Bessenyei was the son of an obscure tavern-keeper at Berczel, and was born in 1740. He learnt a little Latin in the preliminary school, which he soon forgot, and in the course of time became a soldier in the Hungarian body-guards at Vienna* There he began again to study, mastered the French language, and was captivated by the French literature. He wrote several dramatic pieces, and an imitation of Pope's Essay on Man, Az embemek pr6bdja. In the later part of bis life he became almost wholly a prose writer, and published several philosophical works. His example served greatly to impede the project of the Emperor Joseph, whose determination to drive out the Hungarian by means of the German language, was rash and futile. Bessenyei died in 1811, an object of great affection and interest among the Hungarians. ORCZT has much that is artificial. He was almost unknown as a poet, until Revai published

BARCSAI was of the race of the Transylvanian Prince of his name, and was born at Piskiin 1743. fie, like so many other literary men of Hungary, took military service, in 1762. He became a Catholic in 1779, having been first known as a poet about two years before. Rgvai did for his writings the same service he rendered those of Orczy* The works of both were printed in one volume; and so strikingis their resemblance that they seem the et»aoations of one single mind. They are for the most part epistles. In 1794, Barcsai retreated to his rural estates in Maros-Solymos, and Cs6ra, which bad been ravaged by the Wallachians about ten years before. In 1806, he was found mortally wounded, under a favourite apple-tree, which had been the device of his seal, with the inscription, 'Arnyikban mldul (Growing under its shadow). Count ttalter wrote a funeral oration in French, which was afterwards translated into Hungarian by Kazinczy.

He obtained early academical honours, and, encouraged by the writing of Besaenyei and Bar6czi, and yet more by the personal influence of Baretai, he became a decided votary of literature, which, amidst the high mountains and deep solitudes of the convent where he dwelt, (for Anyos was a monk,) he pursued with unwearied exertions. But amidst his brethren of the convent he found no kindred spirit, and he left the cloisters of Felsd-Elefent for the gymnasium of Sz^kesFej&v&r, in 1783 ^ but his health was broken, and he died* aged only twenty-eight, two years after his settlement there. He was gifted b y nmtttre with strong sensibilities and kindly affections.

the hero, which had a brilliant but a short-enduring fame. His collection of Transdanubian Popular Songs, is interesting and valuable. His Plays are scarcely worth notice. He wrote with wonderful ease, sometimes producing a hundred strophes in a day. But to write fast and to write well are not the same thing; and the offer which he once made to write a drama per week, is a poor credential for his reputation. He was rash in his judgments, though honest in his purposes; condemned the literature of other countries, because he did not understand i t ; and, like too many critics, imagiued that censure and snarling were wisdom and wit. He began an Encyclopedia, which was a great desideratum for his country. Spite of his weaknesses, he was beloved and honored, and died in 1820, having obtained the office of District Judge and Curator of the Reformed Church. DUGONICS lived at a period when the policy of the Austrian Emperor, in attempting to root out the national tongue of the Magyars, aroused a body of patriotic opposers. His national romances greatly aided the popular feeling—but his higher flights are all failures. He was born in 1740, at Szegedin, and was received as a priest among the Transylvanian Piarists. Dwelling amidst the



MAGYAR BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. xlv
scenes, and dreaming of the events of ancient Dacia, his mind was soon wholly engaged in antiquarian studies. The first of his romances, which obtained distinguished attention, was his Etelka. (Poson, 1787.) He wrote many dramas, but they have little value, and several prose histories. The most valuable by far of all his productions is his Magyar pdcla hesztdek 4s jeles Monddsoky a very useful philological work. He wrote less for the highly cultivated than for the middling classes, among whom he labored with great effect. He was a man of fine presence and ready wit, and he died, after a happy old age, in 1818. MOLNXR had, in 1760, opposed the universal employment of hexameters, and introduced with much acceptableness many of the ancient measures. A classical school soon grew up. Its leaders were Bar6ti Szab6, the translator of Virgil, a man who was thoroughly imbued with the characteristics of the Augustan age, and who, by dint of labour, managed to give specimens of most of the ancient forms of verse; Rajnis, not a great poet certainly, but an agreeable poetical painter; and the third, Revai, an admirable translator, and a grammarian, whose writings on language have

been important auxiliaries to the Magyar stu* dent.* BAROTI was born at Barot in Transylvania, and was educated by the Jesuits at Trencsfen. When the order was abolished he obtained a professoiw ship at Kaesa (Kaschau Germ.), having previously made those experiments on the Magyar prosody which proved tbat it might be easily and happily adapted to all the antique forms of poetry.% These novelties led to much literary discussion, and the controversy gave him new encouragement to pro* ceed in his classical career. He knew na Ian* guage except Hungarian and Latin, and fighting his way with honour through many a philological controversy, he died, aged fourscore, amidst " labor," but not amidst sorrow. RAJNIS was the son of a German, and born-in J741. Educated by the Jesuits, and thoroughly acquainted with the Greek language, he began, in early life, to write Hungarian verses in the das* aical measures.

the formation of a Literary Society, but failed in the attempt. In 1790, the Diet reintroduced the Hungarian language into the elementary public schools, and established Magyar chairs in the university academies. A number of small societies have since grown up, and each in its little circle has co-operated for the common object. It waa only by assisting such minor associations that Rivai and others could forward their patriotic designs in favour of the language of their nation. Revai published many Latin poeouu Notwithstanding his broken health, he, on being called to the professorship of Hungarian literature at Pest, devoted himself with unbounded and unbroken zeal to the topics of his chair. His large Hungarian Grammar appeared 1803-6. He died in 1807, leaving behind him many valuable philological MSS. and translations from the Greek, Latin, and German. SZAB6 was a Transylvanian, who also belongs to the classical school. Some of his Epigrams are happy, and his works were deemed excellent for their classical correctness. H e wrote on Magyar prosody, and a description of rural life. The criticisms of Kacinczy have diminished the number of Szabo's admirers. RADAY (GBDEON), the son of P41, made some

farther experiments in rhyme by introducing many of the stanzas of the southern nations of Europe. He exerted an influence greater than that of his writings in furthering the cultivation of the Magyar language, and pointing out to the young inquirers aroiind him the pathway of taste and talent. He thus led forward Kazinczy and Dayka, two of the most accomplished and industrious Writers of their age. R&day had been educated in the University of Germany. He founded the excellent library of P6czel, and died in 1792. To BACSANYI'S history an interest, political as well as poetical, attaches. He was born in 1763, at Tapolcza, and first obtained great notice from his valuable contributions to the Magyar Museum from 1788 to 1792. He treated in them of poetry, morals, and general literature. He began a translation of Ossian, which he has lately completed. But his opinions made him at an early period the object of mistrust, and being associated with other enthusiasts in what was called the jacobin conspiracy of the Abb6 Martinovics, in 1794, he was conveyed as a state prisoner, first to Munk&cs, and afterwards to Rufstein. He. obtained his release in 1798, and took up his abode at Vienna, where, in 1799, he married the

tuitous education. His existence was disturbed by many annoyances, and he died in his.twentyeighth year, when it was believed he had purified and elevated his style. Kazinezy published his poems, (Pest, 1813,) and has devoted a preface to an interesting and touching account of a far vorite and friend. VERSEGHY'S Prosody is a great improvement on that of most of his predecessors. He, too, has written a Grammar of the Magyar, which, though less profound and critical than Revai's, is a very useful work. His poetry has not much that is original, but he made the best use of the powers he possessed, and elaborated his productions into, correctness. The place of his birth was Szolnok; of his education, Eger. He became a member of the religious order of the Paulists, and when it was suppressed he entered the army during the Turkish campaign. Ill health compelled him to aban^ don the military profession, and he became a frequent and a valuable contributor to the Magyar Museum. He wrote on Thorough Bass, being an excellent singer, and on many topics of history, theology, and ethics. But being involved in political discussions, he was proceeded against capitally, and his sentence commuted to a nine years' imprisonment, which ended in 1804. He pub*

lished two humorous satires in the same year. His works make up nearly forty volumes. He took an active part against the Rev&yen school id defending what he deemed the purity of the Magyar tongue. He might have enriched it, instead of endeavouring to close the door upon foreign contributions, for he was the master of nine languages. Schedel says of him, " In his literary contests he had not acquired the act of yielding, was exceedingly irritable, and sometimes coarse. But in his domestic relations he was gentle, friendly, and generous, and in society amiable." Of the classical school, VIRAG is the most important auxiliary. He always writes in full possession of his subject—vigorous, clear, and strong. His odes might for their purity have belonged to the Augustan age. But they do not come home to u s ; they are the representatives of something remote and afar; they are of the past, unlinked to the present—cold as antique marble sculpture, and as motionless too. Virag was a regular priest of the Paulist order. In 178.1, he was made Professor at the Gymnasium of SzfetceS-Fejfervfer, and in .1799 published his Odes, which obtained for him the name of the Magyar Horace. His Fables (Buda, 1819; are excellent.

He is often slovenly, sometimes coarse, sometimes exalted. His Dorrotya has much of fine wit and sharp satire in it, but is often degraded by low vulgarity. He was badly trained, and vibrated, as it were, from scholastic trammels into an unrestrained freedom of style. Writing always and about all things, he disappointed the expectations he had created. Schedel says he had in him all the elements of a popular lyric poet In his wiser and happier veto he is charming. He helped, however, to redeem Hungarian poetry from the artificial coldness which had long frozen its genial spirit, and, with Kazinczi, Verseghy, and D*yka, to give it a genuine national character. Csokonai's birth-place was Debretzen. In his twentieth year he was chosen to fill the chair of Poetry, but was speedily dismissed on account of his irregularities. The following year (1796) be went to Poson (Presburg), where he published a poem on the then sitting Diet, which won him great praise. In \7979 he became enamored of the lady to whom many of his lyrics are addressed under the name of Lotta.

She refused her hand; and he, in his gloom, abandoned the Professorship Which Count Feste* tics had given him at £s*rg6« He lost his health, and died in his thirty-first year. His reading was considerable, and spread over many oriental as well as European tongues* His history is a melancholy one of flighttness and folly* He lived, his epitaph says, somewhat slanderously towards his arty poete more. After his disappointment he became indifferent to Opinion, and produced a series of profligate writings, whose highest privilege Will be—oblivion. The present century dawned prosperously for Magyar literature* The first volume of ALEXANDER KIS&ALUDY'S Himfy Was published in 180L No book wfcs ever known to produce such an imprestfion in Hungary as was awakened by this volume | nor was the success of the second part, which appeared in 1807* less than that of the first.

The main topic is, however, relieved by much beautiful philosophy and salutary tuoraliz

ing. Between the 400 shorter Dalok or Songs, are introduced 28 Canzonets, somewhat in the Petrarchan style. There is throughout, a masterly condensation of thought, without any embarrassment of language. Kazinczy called these productions the Epigrams of Love. They have many novel forms of expression, some uncommon words; but they approve themselves constantly to the mind. His Regth are the very images of Hungarian life. In his Dramas* whether historical or domestic, he has been less successful; the characters rather describe than develop them* selves. Kisfaludy was born of an ancient Hungarian family at Siimeg 5 educated at Gydr (Raab) and Poson; entered the army in his twentieth year 5 fought the Italian campaign, and was taken prisoner by the French in 1796. Visiting Avig-non, it seems as if the mantle of Petrarch had descended upon him, and that out of the fountain of Vaucluse he had drunk of the Italian Helicon. In 1800, he left military service and married the Lisa of his songs. They were published anonymously, and he was for a time " the Great Unknown" of Hungary. His later lyrics have been all welcomed with enthusiasm. In 1809, he enlisted among the Hungarian insurgents, and wrote a history of the campaign. His abode is at Siimeg,



MAGYAR BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. Ivil
where he was born, in a spot said to be one of romantic beauties. KAZINCZY'S active spirit has poured upon his country many streams of foreign literature. His prose is admirable. He had to fight a hard battle in favour of improvements which the Hungarian language demanded, in order to accommodate itself to an improved civilization. The man who introduces one really useful word or expression into his native language, is entitled to great applause. It has been by a series of benefactions of this sort that our English tongue has become whit it is, and that it promises to go on gathering strength and riches with the progress of time. The foolish resistance to such melioration has left the French language in nakedness and poverty, unable to communicate a thousand shades of thought and feeling* which find representatives in the greater opulence of other idioms. The prejudices of what is called nationality—a word the random use of which may to an unbounded extent impede good and encourage evil—are easily awakened; but K&zinczy has struggled successfully against them—and he has done well; for the author who gives to the mind any new instrument of power, who assists the development and the lucidness of ideas by finding appropriate

expressions for them, plants the best sfeeds of knowledge, K&zinczy aroused a strong opposition against him, as if he had polluted his mother tongue 5 but that good sense which at last triumphs over narrow prejudices, has recognised him as a well-doer* He has translated much, and from many languages* His parents wtre Calvinists, and he was born at fir-Semlyen in 1759. He pursued his studies with great activity and succesB at Sfcrospatak, and in his eighteenth year had published a geographical work. In 1786j he was placed at the head of the national schools of the Kassa district, extending over nearly a fourth part of Hungary. His literary history, is one of continued labor and successful exertion* With Baroti and Bac*6nyi, he produced the Ma* gyar Museum, and in 1790 he himself established the Orpheus, a monthly literary periodical. When the ancient crown of Hungary was deposited at Buda in 1790, Kfczinczy was deputed with the congratulations of the Abauj district. With this event the awakening enthusiasm of the Magyars was connected. Hungarian dramas were represented, Hungarian Anthologies printed, and the works of many a celebrated foreign poet first wore an Hungarian dress. The revival of Hungarian emotions was not agreeable to the court, and K&

zinczy, like many of his literary friends, became obnoxious, and was visited by state prosecution, whose sentence was commuted by the Idng into seven years' imprisonment* He left his jail in 11301, and married a Catholic lady, Sophia, the daughter of Count Ttirttk. On the breaking out of the war with France, he was one of the twelve Deputies chosen to organize the insurrection against the enemy; and in 18019 with Count Joseph DezscJfi, wad appointed to plan the monument to those who had fallen at Gydr, which now ornaments Ujhely, in the neighbourhood of which Kazinezy dwells. A collection of his works on Belles Lettres, in irine volumes, has been published.* That part of his Erdttyi Levelek (Transylvaniatt Letters) which has been printed—the result of a journey through that country—is much valued, H* name i»> in a word, spread over the whole field of modern Magyar literature, and will be found as a contributor to every periodical of distinction which has appeared in his native country.

him. His is a philosophical temperament, and his style is clear and bright He has published much original poetry and many translations. Nothing can be farther removed from .affectation than his writings, and his verses especially flow like a stream down a gentle declivity. He was born of poor parents at Szent-Andr&s, in Soprony. His mother taught him to read, his father to write. When he entered the Soprony Gymnasium, a benevolent German Professor (Schwart* ner) took much notice of him, and greatly assisted the cultivation of his mind. In his twentyfirst year, (1791,) accompanied by a school -fellow, he undertook a pedestrian tour through a great part of Hungary, for the purpose of making the personal acquaintance of the eminent writers of the time. He travelled into Germany, and followed the courses of some of the distinguished Professors of Gottingen and Jena; on his return to Hungary he was made a professor, and elevated to many distinguished offices in the career of education. He was one of the founders of the Magyar Society at Soprony for the cultivation of the poetical literature of Hungary. He obtained the prize which was offered in 1804, by an Hungarian patriot, for the best essay on the cultivation and extension of the Magyar tongue. In

he was called to the ranks.of nobility. He translated Lowth's Choice of Hercules from the English. His works are very numerous—sixty volumes at least, independently of many contributions to periodicals., They consist of versions from the classics, school-books, and ethics> and poetry on many topics. Of BERZSENYI, opinions are various and sometimes contrary. He has been admired for his originality by some, and attacked for his servility by others. Dobrentei, however, says of him in a letter to me, "Berzsenyi is truly a national poet, fiery,, glowing, soft, and. exalted. His language the purest Hungarian." I have heard him compared to a lark soaring and singing in the heavens. The thoughts, and sometimes the phrases, of the Latin and German classics may be traded in some of his works. Nothing can be more natural than the flow of his strains, more awakened and awakening than his sensibilities, more lively than his imagination. The Hungarians call him their national bard, as a special distinction. His compositions are fervent and fiery, and so frequently breathe those warm and passionate appeals to the patriotic feelings of his countrymen which agitate their minds like an intellectual tempest. They



lxii INTRODUCTION.
speak of Berzsenyi with a wild enthusiasm. H e has fanned and flattered the strongest of the Ma-, gyar sensibilities—has sung the ancient glories of the Hunnish race—and, with deep pathos, has poured strains of plaintiveness over their present decay. Rumy says of him, that as a boy he was "non sine Dis animosus infans." It has been objected to him that his style is sometimes inflated and degraded by provincialisms, but his severest critics are willing to allow that be has many distinguished merits. His place of birth was Hetye, and he became in early Hfe the friend of Kis, and the correspondent of K&zinczy. In: one of the assemblies of the different orders at Siimeg in 1812, Count Teleki presented our poet as the treasure of the Hungarian Parnassus* His works were published in three volumes, b y Helmeczy, in 1813. Berzsenyi was one of those who were sharply attacked by the Jfondolaty a satire on the Neologiats, as they were called, as the introducers of novelties. His present abode is Mikla. HKLMECZY has ventured far in introducing new^ words and new combinations of words, particularly in his translations from Schiller and Tasso, in the original measures. Perhaps he is not al

ways happy in his experiments, but he has, at all events, added something to the riches of his native tongue, SZEMERR'S Sonnets are the best existing in the Hungarian,* He, too, has been a translator from other idioms, and has published a version of Earner's Zrinyi, a drama recommended to the Magyars by its connexion with their history. Szemere was of an ancient and noble family; biff studies were pursued through many schools and colleges ; in his twenty-third year he hecame an advocate, and about ten years after was made Vice Fiscal of Pest. He has written many philological papers, and taken an active part in the strife as to the improvements of the Magyar tongue. He published a collection of songs in 1812,f and has been actively engaged with Kolcsey in the editorship of l i f e and Literature, lsilet 4s lAtteratura.

and Jena to be trained to the office of Librarian. After an absence of two years he returned, and died in his thirtieth year, in 1812. His friend Dobrentei published some of his poems in the Erdtlyi Museum, with an affectionate and eulogistic notice (Pt. II. pp. 102—116). DOBRENTEI has translated several of Shakspeare's plays, and his Magyar Macbeth was represented at Poson during the sittings of the Diet in 1825. His epic Ketn/ermezei Diadal, Victory of Kenyermezo, a sort of Ossianic composition, has been translated into German by Count MaiUtth. There is a charming popular tone about some of his productions, while others give evidence of a high and cultivated taste. His origin is noble—his birth-place Hogye*sz. His early productions obtained for him the favor .of the Soprony Literary Society, whose transactions he edited in 1804. After travel in foreign lands, he became the preceptor of the young Count Gyulai, of Transylvania. He again left his country for Italy in 1814, and on his return established the Erd&yi Museum at Kolosv&r, one of the most valuable contributions to Magyar literature. Men of every sect united to assist this interesting undertaking, and its pages will be found ornamented with the works of Catholics and Calvin

ists, Lutherans, and Unitarians. Ever labouring for the advance of his country's literature, he laid the foundations of a society of Belles Lettres on an extended scale, which has been sanctioned and recommended by many of the authorities, but has not yet obtained the patronage of the King, In 1825, he was made commissary of the Buda district, and there is his place of abode. He is one of the moat zealous, one of the most enlightened and fascinating of the Magyar writers. He is the author of the article in the Leipzig Conversations Lexicon on the literature of his country, and his name will be found associated with honourable titles to distinction and affection over the whole field of Magyar intelligence. The odium theologicum, which may be translated malevolence in its worst shape, sometimes breaks very offensively through the writings of Hungarian divines. Yet I have heard from Dobrentei a story so honourable to all concerned, that I record it here with exceeding satisfaction. Dobrentei is a Protestant, and one who, to my knowledge, has made sacrifices to his religious convictions. In 1829, when he returned from Transylvania, he visited, in Tfet, the well-known Catholic Priest, Horvkt Endre, who lived in his Pdzmdndi Magdny, (Pazmandian Solitude,)

amidst the vineyards on the sides of the moun- * tain, where the ancient Benedictine convent stands. There were present several Catholics, and among them Guzmics Izidor, a Benedictine monk, the translator of Theocritus into Magyar Hexameters, and Szalai Imre, the grammarian, now Professor at Pest. A little festival welcomed the poet. It was held in the open air, under a large apple-tree. Horv&t rose, and thus addressed the party: " Friends, Dobreutei is here, the Editor of the Erdfelyi Museum. I take you all to witness, that, in memory of this day, I name this noble apple-tree the Gdbor F&ja" (Gabriel's Tree). The word was re-echoed by all the company, they filled their glasses with Huagarian wine, and baptized the G&bor F&ja. Guzmics wrote a distich, which was suspended on the tree, which has been since an object of considerable attraction. I owe much to Dobrentei, far more than my thanks can repay. BCCZY is a native of Kolosv&r—his poetry is of the classic character, which has grown out of bis great devotion to the writers of Greece and Rome. He was professor of rhetoric at Nagy Szeben (Hermanstadt), but ill health compelled him to abandon his chair, and to retire for some years to

private life. On his recovery he was appointed to the professorship of moral philosophy at K&roly* Fej£rv&r (Karlsburg)^ which occupies him at this hour. Most of his poems are contributions to the Erdtilyi Museum.
T6TH has more of erudition than of poetical genius, and his erudition is visible in the classical character of his writings. His father was a preacher of the Reformed Church at Kis^Tokaj, and the young Toth.made such progress in his early studies of Latin and Greek, as to excite the admiration of his teachers. In 1814 he came to Pest in order to fit himself for the practice of medicine. Two years afterwards he published his first volume of poems; and in 1818, his Greek verses with their Hungarian translations. They were favourably received and honorably noticed. In 1816 he joined the Catholic church; but he died of cholera, some have suspected of poison, in 1820. He was the first to introduce the Pindaric Ode into the Magyar literature. His unpublished writings were more numerous than his published ones, and great hopes were indulged of the services he might render by them to the healing art. While the paper is yet wet which bears these translations from Vrraovics, I receive the intel/2

ligence that this interesting poet has erased to be. He died on the 9th of September, 1829. He was a Servian by birth, and wrote his native and his adopted language with equal purity. His tones are easy, graceful, and airy, and he introduced into Hungary those strains of popular song which are so diffused among the Slavonian nations. Eger (Eylau) was his birth-place, and there was he educated. Having been chastised as a boy for the offence of verse-making, he clung to the art the more closely when he grew to be a man. Professor Pkpay gave him the first instructions as to the composition of Magyar poetry. His Address to Horv&t, and more especially his Fables and Poems, (Mes$i 4s versei: Pest, 1817,) were welcomed with high praise. His writings are scattered over the fugitive Hungarian papers of the present centufy. FAY is a sharp and sparkling writer, from whose pen mirth and laughter are constantly gushing forth. He was born in 1786, at Koh&ny, and was just that eager and sprightly youth who might be expected to become the lively and witty man. Having studied at S&rospatak and Poson, he became a judge in the Pest district, where he dwells. In 1807 he published a collection of. his fables and poems (Bokr&a), of which many were



MAGYAR BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. lxix
written before he had reached his fifteenth year. Another collection, Fris Bokr&g, (Fresh Plumes), appeared in 1818; and a third, consisting of Fables and Aphorisms, in 1820. These are excellent^they are humorous and wise. In 1824 appeared other Tales and a Prose Cqmedy, entitled Kedvesapongdsok (Pleasure Vibrations). Fay is one of the most popular of the Hungarian writers. In 1814, HORVXT Andreas published bis Zircz Emtekezete — Remembrance of Zircz, in hexameters. The paucity of events is relieved by many philosophical musings, and the language and versification correct and easy. The date of Horv&t's birth is 1778. In 1708 he entered the Cistercian order of Monks. In 1806 he was appointed to a Cure in T£t, his present abode. At the request of many of his adjpirers he undertook a National Epic—to celebrate the founder of the Hungarian Kingdom, Arp&d, which is not yet completed, though he has published specijnens in some of the periodicals, especially the Aurora, where also may be found many other productions of his pen.
The songs of SZBNTMIKLOSSY ALOYS are agreeable, and his Epigrams pointed. He was the son of a state councillor, who paid great attention Jo his education, and on the completion of his stu

dies at Eger, in his twenty-sixth year, he was made an Assessor at Borsod. In his early writings he appears to have made Faludi and Anyos his models; but K&zinczy obtained afterwards great influence on his mind The presence of a number of French officers, prisoners of war, at Eger, induced him to attend particularly to the literature of their country. Szentmikl6ssy's writings have not, I believe, been collected into volumes, but are spread through the different periodicals of Hungary. KOLCSEY introduced the Ballad into the Hungarian literature.—His elegiac powers are great. His remarks on His contemporaries have been salutary, though sometimes severe. He w;as the Editor of Elet 4s Litter atiira (Life and Literature), a periodical of high reputation. His own writings are warm and vigorous. Born at Szd Demeter, in Transylvania, he studied at Debreczen, obtained honor as a classical scholar, and mastered the literature of France and Germany* In his nineteenth year he became a Jurat at Pest, and there formed that intimate alliance with Horv&t, Vitkovics, and Szemere, which afterwards exercised so important an influence on Magyar criticism. His first productions appeared in the DdmdJt Kalenddrioma (Ladies' Calendar), and the



MAGYAR BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. lxxi
Transylvanian Museum* On a visit paid his friend Szemere, he wrote the attack on Mondolat, which was published without his cognizance in 1815. His criticisms on Csokonai, Kis, and Berzsenyi, won him many enemies, and made him the object of sharp censure, These criticisms appeared in the Tudomanyos Gyujtemeny (Literary Collection), and the intention of going over the whole course of Hungarian literature in the same spirit was abandoned. His critical productions are vigorous, eloquent, and useful. His translation of Homer, if it can be judged of by the specimens published, is very masterly. He inhabits Cs^ke (Schwake). It is earnestly to be desired that his vigorous, original, and for the most part judicious, criticisms, should be continued.
Though so much of KISFALUDY'S (KAR6I<Y) life
was passed -far away from Hungary, -a more correct painter of Hungarian manners has never appeared. His Dramas are rich in fancy juid remarkable for their truth and tact. He has far outstripped the expectations excited by his earlier productions. He has wop for himdelf a dramatic, almost equal to his brother'« lyric, feme.

with great rapidity, each being welcomed with1 new enthusiasm. He has taken his materials, for the most part, from the interesting events of Magyar history, and has presented admirable pictures in which truth has furnished all their bright lights and dark shadows. He deserves * more special attention, and a more careful and detailed criticism, than can be found room for here; but on some future occasion, I hope, with the co-operation of a valuable friend, to%itroduce some of his admirable works in their entirety to English readers. His Aurora cannot be mentioned without praise. For some years it has been the receptacle of the gems of modern Magyar poetry. It was here that Kolcsey first became known. . ; Charles Kisfaludy is the younger brother of Alexander, and was born at Tet, on the 19th of March, 1790* In his fifteenth'year he entered the army,—was engaged in the campaign of Italy in 1805i and that of Germany in 1809. It is said that when he left his paternal home he had never seen any other poetry than his' brother's Himfy. This, however, sufficed to enkindle the embers of his imagination, and in Italy he wrote many poems, which have seen the light at different times, and in various ways. The first of his

It produced such a tempest of applause, that (says Schedel) " the poet could hardly save himself from the rush of young people, who, with loud shouts of joy, insisted on producing him on the stage." It was again and again represented with boisterous applause. His second play, Zacs, was prohibited,—*his third, Ilka, was scarcely less fortunate than the first. In the following year he wrote h\&*SHbor9 a Drama, in four acts,—-and, on a notice of only ten days, his Sz&si,—and* in a yet.less period, Kenieny Simon. A number of dramatic pieces followed these, and in 1820, he published an Apotheosis of Pannonics. His intimacy with Helmeczy led him to a more thoroughly pfailosophical examination of the character of the Hungarian language, and to project the establishment of a school of art, for the furtherance of a pure poetical taste. The Aurora dawned out of this conception, and it is sprinkled over with various works, in almost every, class of composition. In many of these Kisfaludy adopted pseudonymes, some of which became almost as famous as his own. .

In 1825, he was chosen Secretary to the representatives to the diet of the Heves district, and remained two years in the capital. His writings are principally in the Aurora; one of them, a Bor&ek, or Wine Song, was enthusiastically admired. CZUCZOR'S Augsburgi uthozet, (Battle of Augsburg, A. D. 910,) is an epic in four cantos. The subject is too remote, and too little assisted by historical facts, to excite much interest. It is an energetic composition, but swelling at times into an almost bombastic grandiosity. His Arw& gyules (Diet of Arad, A. D. 1136,) in five cantos, is happier in every respect. The actors are fine and veracious portraits, the events both touching and important. Less varied, less romantic than Vdrosm&rty, he has more simplicity and unity in his story, and more of individuality in his actors. He was born at And6d in 1800, became a Benedictine in 1S17; the following year he attended a course of philosophy at Gyor. In 1824, he became Latin Professor, and, in 1826, Professor of Rhetoric there, and he still fills the chair.

VoRdsMARTY entered on dangerous ground when he determtned to try his fortune as an epic poet. He had several living rivals; among them Czuezor and Horv&t, who had published some specimens of hife Arpad. But V&rosmarty was not a man of an every-day stamp* His rich and powerful fancy has always been sufficient to his highest intellectual conceptions. Not that he has formed on all occasions a correct estimate of his own powers. His mind is not fitted for dramatic groupings. He is a master of description, not of action. No fault can be found with the poetry . of his dramas; but unless the doings of the stage are as interesting as the sayings, there is no redemption for the work. Vdr6smarty's dramas ' are failures. As an epic poet, however, Vorosmarty is really great.* Schedel speaks of the inexhaustible opulence of Vdrdsmarty's imagination, the infinite versatility of its creations, the marvellously varied shades of thought and feeling for which he has found expression, and especially of the felicitous sketches and personifications of woman which decorate bis pages. His Hexameters are beautiful, and truly national. In

the field *>f poetry, it is of these epics that the Hungarians feel most proud, and desire that these should be deemed the representatives of their poetical cultivation. Vdrosmarty (Mih&ly) was born on the 1st of December, 1800, at Nyflc, of noble Catholic pa* rents. In 1816, he was a student at Pest. In this year his father died, and he undertook the office of tutor, which he filled for nine years. In 1824, he became an Advocate, and has ever since that period made Pest his place of abode, studying the writings and benefiting by intercourse with the distinguished men of his time. He visited Transylvania with his pupil in 1820-3, and there began to study Shakspeare, his mind growing stronger and stronger by the communion with noble spirits of other ages. He wrote several dramas, but did not receive the applause which was to welcome his productions till his Zaldn appeared in 1825, which was received with marks of uncommon delight. On Kisfaludy's recommendation, he engaged in celebrating the conquest of King Salomon over the Rumaniansa popular and successful enterprise. Other pieces followed, both historical and critical; and invested now with the Editorship of the Tudoma

The lyrics of SZENVBY are more remarkable for their form, than their correctness of language. He is a preceptor at Maglod, and was born in 1798. The greater part of his manhood was passed in the neighbourhood of Visegrad, " the paradise of Hungary, in the midst of those ruins which make the memory of the past so beautiful, living a life of enthusiasm and of song."* He has written seven tragedies, and many ballads, I have thus gone through the list of those Mar gyar authors who seem more particularly entitled to notice. I trust in this good wock I am the forerunner of wiser and more successful men. That the Magyar language and literature will receive greater attention from foreigners, and that the interest excited elsewhere will act upon the better and brighter part of Hungarian ambition is certain. I see without jealousy the ardent national feeling of the Magyars, and feel that a nationality founded upon knowledge, and representing a spirit of freedom and independence, is itself a virtue, and the parent of many virtues.

INTRODUCTION.
And witnessing the anxiety and the interest which these imperfect labors of mine have awakened among the Magyars, I could not but derive encouragement to continue them. They who have patronized the daring, as well as they who have experienced the difficulties, will find indulgence for me. It may be deemed that originality is wanting in these compositions. But it should not be forgotten that something of originality is lost by the transfusion of any thought into a different idiom 5 that an English verse of necessity becomes in some degree English. There are other causes, too, which act upon Magyar literature. A people so closely connected with Austria as arc the inhabitants of Hungary, and whose learned men almost without exception speak and write the German tongue, do undoubtedly, though sometimes almost imperceptibly, adopt the character of a literature with which they are so familiar. This familiarity, if it sometimes trench on their nationality, does at the same time keep a high standard ever present to their minds, and leads to comparisons and contrasts which are on the whole favorable to the exercise of the intellectual powers. A German critic* has denied to * See Wiener Zahrbiicher for 1829, No. xlv.

the Magyars a poetical temperament. He says the national tone is noble, generous, gallant, susceptible, good-natured, loving, easily won, sharpwitted, and imaginative. Now, are not these elements enough for. the creation of poets and poetry 2 And how can a nation be deemed unpoetical which can offer to the world such a roll of poets as Hungary presents ? Of the popular poetry of the Magyars, little can be referred to a high antiquity. A fragment of an ancient poem is still sung by Hungarian children, thus:
Lengyel L&sztf j<S kir&lyunk Az is nekunk illense*gunk.*
Nothing, however, but these two lines remain. The martial songs of their warlike ancestors have not been saved out of the oblivion of old time. Of the historical songs none are earlier than those of the wars of the last Hungarian revolution. Of the oral stories (Mes4k or Eeg4k) of the Magyars, I shall translate Mailath's interesting description : " The Magyar story-tellers are one of the many evidences of the oriental origin of the people. Like the Night- fablers of Arabia, they go on by

the hour~-aye, by the night long-—without wearying their hearers. These are for the most part to be found among soldiers and peasants. The stories which in other lands are preserved only in work-rooms and nurseries to our days, are narrated in Hungary in the porch, by watch and shepherd fires, and amidst the night labors of the field. The character of the Magyar tale is wholly unlike that of southern lands. The hero is generally a student, a soldier, or a king's son; his companion, a magic horse called Tat6s, who is his counsellor and saviour. His enemy is often a dragon with six, nine, or twelve heads, and the hero must undergo three ordeals; and this number is the ruling one throughout the story. There is a sharpness and oddity about the conception* and an original development of the plot. The scenery, and the deeds] of the principal actors, shew that.the stories emanate from a people who lived in elevated places. The narrator sometimes unites two or three stories in one — sometimes' divides one into many—elaborates or changes it according to his own caprice or the demands of his audience.—It has happened that many tales of foreign origin have been introduced, which have been all nationalized by time.

To advocate their merits as literary compositions is no part of my task. I have given nearly the whole that have reached me, in order to shew what are the Songs of the Magyar people. Hungarian towns ancl villages, and rivers and plains, and hills and valleys, have been painted and described by many. Here are some of the thoughts of those who dwell there* The dresses of Hungary and Transylvania decorate many books, and are the subject of many pictures. Here are some of the adornings of the inward man—here is something of the costume of mind.

And scarcely less am I indebted to Count Mailath's Magyarische Gedichte* Without the assistance of these valuable writers I could not have effected a labor, of whose incompleteness and imperfections no individual can be more sensible than myself. But to do something, though feebly and unsatisfactorily, where nothing has been done before—to bring some mementos, though few and small, from an undescribed country—to introduce a little knowledge, in the place of much ignorance —may haply be a not unworthy service. Criticism will estimate the difficulties which surround " the stranger in a strange land/' and will deal out an indulgent award.

• Respecting the date of this poem tliere are mauy diflerent opinions. Rival quotes it as one of the national ballads sung at the public festivals of the Magyars, attributing it to the twelfth century as its earliest date; but it is generally supposed to be a composition of the fourteenth century. The three last stanzas were first published by Schedel in his collection.

And glorious were their doings then: Seven bands composed the host; Seven valiant chieftains led the men, And each a Far * could, boast.
In their communion all was union. And valor in the fray; No thought of fear was ever there. But safety kept the sway.
They conquered long—like Samson strong, All foemen they subdued; With lion-hearts overwhelming allA fearful multitude.
Of all the band, the Magyars' pride Was the renowned Arpad; He was the highest, noblest chief, And greatest riches had.
And soon they found, while wandering round, The Duna'sf waters clear; In beauteous road those waters flow'dNo clearer waters were.
They hurried then a messenger, The Duna's stream to track; And, did its name deserve its fame, Tire borders to attack.

The messenger pursued the stream, The banks, the fields, the flood; He drank of Duna's water there, And swore that it was good.
A Lcngyel* Lord was ruler then, Of all the land the Lord; Veszprem his court—but over all Was spread a Nemetf horde.
The messenger to Veszprem came, The Polish Count to see; And bow'd his head in reverence, And thus spoke cunningly:
" I came to see thy land and thee, And, Herczeg,% this the cause That I resort to Veszprem's court:To learn thy people's laws."
This pleased the Count, and nobly he The Magyar entertain'd; And much he saw of Lord and law, And much instruction gain'd.
An empty flask he dar'd to ask, Where Duna's waters pass; The flask he filled, some earth he took, And pluck'd a little grass.

And hastened back to Erdely, And sought the chief, Arpad ; And much joyed he, the things to see, The faithful Magyar had.
He called together all the chiefs, He shewed the water clear, The bit of earth, the blades of grass, And held a council there.
And then decreed, a snow-white steed The Magyar should convey ; With golden bit, and saddle rich, And thus be charged to say:
" The men who out of Scythia came, Have sent this steed to thee; And from thy grace, they ask a place To settle quietly."
The Count saw nought of what was thought By those the steed who sent; And for the love of snow-white steed, His land was from him rent.
" Go, messenger," he said; " declare"His folly went so far" I give whatever lands they ask, To the brave Magyar."

The messengers delighted heard; Their bosoms fill'd with glee, They said, " Farewell!" and went to tell Their tale in Erdely.
They made a call on heroes all, And straight a council held; And summoned every man to meet The Herczeg in the field.
And thrice on Isten's name they called, The Deus of their prayer; And then the Godhead's title gave To Szamos' city there.*
And yet we recollect the day, And in all bargains we Still loudly " Deus! Deus!" say, In that time's memory.
And when the bands were ready all, They order'd heralds three; The Polish Lord, with this bold word, To visit speedily:

" Remember, Herczeg ! what thou dostTo leave the land prepare; Which thou hast sold to Magyars boldThe Magyars hasten here,"
The heralds sought the Polish Count, And bent them low and meek; Yet free from fright, they spoke outright, As Arpad bade them speak.
" For snow-white steed thou gav'st the land; For golden bit, the grass ; For the rich saddle, Duna's streamNow bring the deed to pass."
The Herczeg laugh'd at first, nor cared For what the heralds brought j But soon his rage overcame his mirth, And thus he spoke his thought:
" 'Twere better to have slain the steed, Than sport such dangerous wit; The saddle hide 'neath Duna's streamBeneath the grass, the bit/'
The heralds to the Herczeg said, " Your Highness need not storm; The bargain made with Magyar men, Your Highness must perform.

At Kelemfold, Arpad the bold O'er Duna's waters goes; At Cseke's land his forces mann'dIn Tetem were the foes.
The Magyar throng in £rd was strong, And on Szaszhalom's plain: In those proud wars, the Magyars, By God upheld, their foemen quell'd, And mighty was their gain.

BALLAD OF THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER 5 OR THE HISTORY OF MICHAEL SZILAGYI AND LADISLAUS HAJMASI.
I HAVE an interesting tale to tell you, Such: as you never heard. List! for 'twill charm you; 9Tis of the Turkish Emperor's lovely daughter.
Two youthful heroes were of old made prisoners, Sent to Constantinople to the Emperor, And hy the Turkish Emperor flung in prison.
The prison was adjacent to the palace; The heroes9 names were, Szilagy Mihaly The one—Hajmasi Laszlo was the other.
Szilagyi, looking through the prison trellice, ('Twas Whitsun day,) play'd an harmonious ditty On his guitar—'twas sweet, yet melancholy :
And spake, 'midst deepest sighs—"With father, mother, And with mine own dear sister, this day twelvemonth, This very day, I was so very happy!"



12 ANONYMOUS.
The Emperor's daughter, standing near the window, Heard him—look'd in—and soon was moved to pity; Besides, Szilagyi's form had pleased the maiden.
And suddenly she sought the prison's portal, And pour'd sweet comfort on Szilagyi's bosom. And gently, sweetly, held thisflatteringlanguage:
" Young hero! if upon thy knightly honor Thou swear to bring me to the Magyar country, And swear too (should I prosper) to espouse me
" I shall be satisfied—and I will free thee; Yes! I will free thee from thy prison's darkness: So swear me by thy faith and by thine honor!"
And soon Szilagyi answered—" Free me, maiden ! And I will wed thee—by my faith and honor I swear to wed thee, thou imperial daughter !"
And so the maiden won the prison keeper ;Aroused at midnight both the sleeping heroes. And led them forth to the imperial stables:
Gave each a sharpened sword in golden scabbard; They kilPd the stable-keepers and attendants, And the three fleetest horses swiftly saddled.
The morning brought the tidings to the EmperorThe prisoners were out-broken from the prisonThe boys, the keepers of the stables, murder'd.

They stopp'd the heroes at the gate of customs, Ask'd them where speeding. " Out to Nagy-Szombat,* Among the wolves—with Isten's holy favor." f
Five of his choicest chiefs the Emperor summoned, And thus commanded them: " Pursue the flyingCapture them—and produce them in my presence."
And the five chieftains hasten'd to the borders, Bidding the guards arrest the flying heroes, And bear them swiftly to the Emperor's presence.
They fell upon the heroes at the borderStrove to arrest them—but they fought so bravely, They forced their way, and passed in safety onward.
The chieftains heard it, and pursued the flyingO'ertook them—and there was a bloody combat: The chieftains fell—it was the will of Isten !
The heroes sent the maid for her protection, What time the battle lasted, to an island, An island not remote. The battle ended,
The heroes sought again the hidden maiden, And then Szilagyi heard a voice of wailingSzilagyi saw the maiden sorely troubled.
• Tyman (Germanice). t The meaning (says Schedel) is, " We go to Tyman to join the Turkish troops, who are terrible to the enemy (the Hungarians) as wolves to sheep."

Uttering despairing tones of lamentation, " Merciful Isten! I have left my dwelling: What will befal me in this dreary desert ?
" O miserable fortune! But my fortune Is far less grievous than those youthful heroes', Who fell beneath the sword-strokes of the foeman.
" For them, I'll haste to death—for them, I'll make me A burial-bed upon the gloomy desert: God! let the wolves and wild fowl be my mourners.
" Into God's hand I now my soul deliver." Szilagyi hastened thither—and the maiden Smiled joyous while he led her forth. They jouraey'd
Towards the Magyar land; they reach'd the borders; And then Hajraasi said to his companion, " Let's strive who shall possess the lovely maiden."
But swift Szilagyi turn'd upon Hajmasi: " Nay, at thy peril; thou art wed already To a fair bride: I'm pledged unto the maiden."
Then cried the imperial daughter to the heroes, " Nay! not for me shall hero blood be wasted: Fling me upon the sword—not your own bosoms." *
* " Hanyjatokinkabb engem szablyara, mintezt niiveljltek." This is an Hungarian idiom for " Kill me, uot yourselves/1



ANONYMOUS. 15
Hajmasi still persisted, and their weapons, Unsheathed, were swiftly drawn upon each other; And sorely, sorely was Hajmasi wounded.
Then spoke the wounded man to his companion, " Forgive me, friend! for I am well rewarded: Well recompensed is he who breaks his duty.
" I had a gentle wife and two fair childrenThe thought overwhelms me—I am justly pumsh'd : Brother in arms! farewell—and O forgive.me!"
So each bestow'd on each a friendly greeting; Szilagyi took the maiden to his dwelling, And made a bride of that imperial maiden.
[This Ballad has been just published by Schedel. He has done me the honor of dedicating the volume which contains it, to me, in terms far too flattering for any deserts of mine. There is a concluding stanza which says that the Ballad was taken from an old History, and writteu in 1571. Schedel thinks it not improbable that the Michael Szilagyi of the Poem was afterwards the Governor of Hungary, and the uncle of the famous Matthias. The character of the Ballad in form and manner remarkably resembles the uarrative poetry of the Slavonian nations ]

Thou look'st on my love with no menacing air, But wouldst help me to win while I worship the fair; And while joy piled on joy flings delight on my days, Let thine be the glory, and thine be the praise.
The first vernal song, and the first vernal leaf, And Nature's sweet childhood—so beauteous and brief; And the nightingale's strain—and the rivulet's fallAnd the light breeze—are thine—music, beauty, and all.
And the summer, when cypresses shade me from heat, And the zephyrs come freshen'd, to kiss my retreat; Where the tent is above, and the wine-cup goes round, And theflowerssmile below—thou, O Fortune! art found.
From autumn's rich harvest thou hasten'st to pour Pomegranates and citrons—a limitless store; Or leadst to the chace, when I follow the preyThe bird in its flight, or wild beast on its way. c

O Fortune! thou wearest my fetters—art bound In my bonds—and I look without terror around: No evil will chance me—I feel that the chain But binds thee more firmly to bless me again.

H E is of illustrious name, Free from spot, and free from blame; Bred as noble minds are bred, Leading, too, as he was led: Yet I love him not—and I . Know full well the reason why !
Lustrous are his eyes as light, And as milk his skin is white; Never did vermillion streak Beauty fairer than his cheek: Yet I love him not—and I Know full well the reason why!
Wisdom all his forehead arches, He is tall as mountain larches; Waving locks of chesnut hair, Lips as twilight dawning fair : Yet I love him not—and I Know full well the reason why!

When he sits upon his steed, Mars must yield for strength and speed; Here and there, and to and fro, Like a Centaur, see, they go: Yet I love him not—and I Know full well the reason why !
Witty, wise and honor'd, too; Tasteful, learned, thro9 and thro'; Calm, courageous, just, urbane ; Courteous, aye! without a stain : Yet I love him not—and I Know full well the reason why!
When he smiles, delight is nigh; Joy salutes him, passing by; Pleasure in his steps is treading, And his friendship, 'tis an Eden: Yet I love him not—for I Heard him call me false—that's why !

" WATER, WIND, REPUTATION,"

I WAS a boy and heard this pretty story: That Wind and Water play'd with Reputation At hide-and-seek together.
The Water rushed adown the mountain passes, But was discovered after long pursuing In the deep valleys.
The Wind flew upwards: But it was followed to the mountain summits, And soon entrapp'd there.
Then Reputation was to be imprisoned, And Reputation whispered In a sonorous voice to her companions: " Know, if you lose me—know, if once I hide me, Pm lost for ever."
And so it was—she hid her; all inquiry Was wasted in the seeking; Nothing can renovate that perish'd treasure, If thou have lost it— thou hast lost all with it.

THERE is an ancient saying—Idleness Is the world's curse: and I have heard a story Out of old time, instructive.
King Matthew once, half-tipsy, put three fellows Three idle fellows—in a house to fatten; And fate, or forethought, set the house on (ire. " Ah ! see, the house is burning !" cried the first; M If the King want us," said the second knave, " Why he will send and save us," In a rage, " Your tongue is very glib," exclaimed the third ; And the house went on burning, and they perish'd.
O there are many idle dogs like theseMany who open wide their lazy mouths, And think that roasted ortolans will enter.

THE WREN AND THE OWL.
Say, why all birds hate the Wren and the Owl? I will tell you the reason: Once, heaven's feather'd inhabitants, aping the manners of mortals, Swore they would make them a monarch. So they all gathered together: Great was the noise, and unbounded the strife, and loud the confusion. Lastly, they all agreed, and every one promised obedience : He who the highest can soar 'midst the lofty clouds of heaven, He shall be king, 'Twas said—and each, on pinions ambitious, Urged his upward flight—but the mightier influence of Phoebus Depressed them down to earth. Someflutteredin midway regionsSome were exhausted and fell—some rose aloft like an arrow, And like an arrow they sunk. Passion and power brought weaknessWeakness and dire defeat—and all earth's face was covered,



3 8 DAVID SZABO BAROTI.
And all the lower skies, with the wrecks of pride and presumption. Lost in the crowd, the small Wren looked on in destitute sadness: Poor little flutterer ! how should he hope to soar over his brethren ? Who would have thought that his cunning would serve him in trial far better
Better than strength ? You shall hear how ingenious his dextrous devices: The Eagle was rising aloft—he sprung on his wing, till he mounted High in the clouds—through the clouds; while the little Wren, silently crouching, Rose with the Eagle, and saw the combatants vanquished beneath themHeard their loud voices which cried—All hail to our Sovereign and Ruler ! Pride is too confident oft, and slippery the footsteps of monarchs, Perch'd on his pinions, the Wren soon stole all his honors imperial; When he could speed no higher, the little Wren sprung from the E a g l e Sprung, and singing, still soared, and claimed the homage of subjects. Vain was his pride, reproved was his falsehood, and sadness came with it; All the assembled tribes spurned the usurper with scoffings,



DAVID SZABO BAROTI. 3 9
Bid the Owl go forth and arrest and watch over the traitor. Great was his eye, and bright—so fitting was he for a keeper. Wisdom's not always wise, nor prudence over prudential. Yet shall the Wren be king—imprisonment gives him the sceptre. Sleep overtook the Owl—the little Wren fluttered his pinions, Flew on the breezy wind, and escaped from the scene of danger. Justice summons her court-—dispatches her minions to bring him: Lo! the Owl asleep—and the Wren—go, ask of the sunbeams. Rage and reproaches cover the careless Owl—thenceforward Crowds of birds pursue the sleeping, slovenly guardian : Never again by day may he venture his hated intrusionsNever, till twilight darkens, and night comes clouded in blackness. Even his voice, when heard, awakens the hate of the songsters. He, like the crafty hound, has track'd the footsteps of silence Where the poor hare, thro' woods, o'er groves and lonely places, Flies to be hidden, in vain—the fugitive soon is discovered. So the Owl's wild scream brings every bird about himOne long torment is his, and a permanent persecution.

Yes ! I will read all the deeds of futurity. Dark-mantled groves, sweet fountains of gentleness, Have ye not thoughts to overwhelm me with transport, And to upbear me to heaven ?

THY faithful lover stands beside thy melancholy tomb ! The tomb which shrouds thee from mine eyes in its unhallowed gloom. Awake! arise!—my open arms would tear thee from thy pallMingle thy heart with mine! O heir my anguish-moving call! The fates—the frightful fates—which closed the grave upon thee there, Dissolved my heart, my hope, in mists which melted in the air. Death! why wert thou so cruel ? Why, with faithfulness like ours, Why didst thou blast mirth's opening bud, that soon would bloom in flowers ? Why trample on those morning gems which in such meekness grew, And just in morning's twilight smiled, and drank love's early dew ? Was it a triumph fit for thee a lowly stem to crushTo break a feeble twig—to mow a bruised and broken rush? I speak—she hears not—no reply—no echo can intrude, No sound may vibrate from the grave, or break its solitude.



PAUL STEPHEN ANVOS. 47
Once, even a whisper touch'd her soul—was music in her ears; Now is she senseless to my cries, and heedless of my tears: A tear—which once could melt her heart and agitate her thought, Whatever I felt she felt—to each a common doom was brought; But death has cut the holy band—and now her heavenly eye Shall ne'er be wet with selfish tears, nor tears of sympathy. Sleep, sleep, sweet spirit! sleep in peace—I will not mourn —I feel, Though thou art silent, yet I dwell within thy bosom still. But I, while still I toil along through life's devoted road, Must bear in hopelessness and grief my overwhelming load.

THOU gloomy star! whose melancholy glances Play with the gentle streamlet softly murmuring, Thou hast awaked thee with the wretched mourners, And their hearts vibrate yet with heavy sorrow. Thou hear'st their sighings in the evening darkness, While all the earth, in silence shrouded, slumbers. There is no slumber in the house of mourning; Slumber takes flight to the abodes of gladness. In the dull churchyard, lo! a cross is standing, And the light breezes shake the dark-leaved cypress, As it overshadows many a mouldering mortalMortals who bore, as I now bear, life's burden. From the deep tomb I see a spirit risingRising from death's upyielding dormitory: Is it not one of that distressful number Borne down like me by heavy, heartfelt trouble ? Came it not towards me ? Why should I avoid it ? Comfort is more in that night-walking spirit Than in the vain illusions of the living, Who have betray'd me with their treacherousfavors! Spirit! come. Ah ! 'tis fled!—how soon departed ! Soon as it glanced my falling tears, it vanish'd.



PAUL STEPHEN ANYOS. 49
Is there, of earth or heaven, no one to hear meNo one to sooth this bitterness of anguish ? Strike, thou blest hour ! whose summoning voice shall call me Out of my sorrows into my seclusion : Free my torn heart from this tormented bosom, And let the earth receive its earth and ashes: Then, when I speak, some friendly hand may garland O'er the tall cross some melancholy flowretsFriendship's mementoes—truth's sweets breathing pledgesDropping a tear upon my clayey ruins.

'Tis the dawn of delight to the sons of the pond; From its green bed they look to the bright moon beyond. Brekeke, brekeke, Koax, too-oo; Koax, koax—too-oo, too-oo!

And then we descended, And so we are here, No helper attended, No helping was near; The heads of our nation Look'd up from the wave, And called for salvation On him who could save. He turned away frowning, And Nemesis cried, " Jove ! doom them to drowning!" He laugh'd at our pride, Nor thought of the danger Of waking our power. At last his hot anger Passed quietly o'er; An epoch of blessings Soon dawn'd on our race; And Juno's caressings, More sweet than before, O'ershadow'd with glory this beautiful place. Brekeke, brekeke, brekeke; Koax, koax—-too-oo, too-od!

So thanks, cordial thanks, to the thunderer of heaven, Who pour'd out the waves where we thrive and have thriven; All honor and praise to his wisdom be given.

When tuning our vesper, As twilight appears, The sweet-emiling Hesper Oft lingers and hears; And Cynthia, she tarries To list and admire, While every fair star is All jealous desire; And often we hear them exclaiming, How blest, In these tranquil green waters to revel and rest! The reverend Tellus, She wonders—what power To such songs can impel us; On us doth she shower

His voice thrilling o'er us Confuses, our chorus. The Gods, interfering, Have punish'd the fool, And given him a hearing Of melody's school; He flies with his riot, He hurries away, Leaves heaven to its quiet, And earth to be gay. Yes! gay with our music till winter, and then We bury our voice in sad silence again, Till the spring breaks anew on the freshness of youth, And we walk in the spirit of music and truth, To pour forth our anthems o'er forest and plain.

Holy virgin! in the throng Of mighty worlds I seek thy throneI seek thee, and have sought thee longOf loveliest ones, the loveliest one ! The right hand of the Deity Graved in my heart thine image bright, And the reflected ray from thee Makes nature's darkness melt in light.
Blest daughter of the skies, who sheddest Undying beams, and smiling spreadest Th' eternal green and gifts of springThou, who o'er heaven's crystal gates dost fling A light of purest, fairest glistening, And standest at the portal listening To songs which angel voices sing.



JOHN KIS. 75
Sister of heavenly sisters! Truth Goes with thee, and untainted youth. Thou on the flowery mounds dost sport With Innocence, while thy fair cheek The roses of contentment streak, And glorious palms thy hands support. Thy thoughts, thy feelings and desire, The harmonious choirs of heaven inspire ; Thou passion's furies know'st to bridle, Things as they are thy bright eyes see; Thou wilt not bow thee to the idol, However bright the diamond be, Fixed on his brow of mystery.
The golden chains of order bound The everlasting spheres around Thou measurest, as those spheres advance Like bright-eyed virgins in the dance Of beauty; and no poisoned spear Wielded by demon hand is there To wound the heart, the bliss to steal, Which all creation's tenants feel.
Th' All-former's hidden works are known To thee—his everlasting will— • Thou seest all upward mounting, s t i l l Still higher mounting, to the throne, Where Good, pure Good, resides alone;

Thou seest the fires of discipline, Improve, sublime, correct, refineTill as the mists.dissolve away, In the diffusing smiles of day, Man glides from mortal to divine.
Dweller in heaven, from heav'n upspnmgAU—all has heavenly looks for thee; Thou nearest songs in every tongue, In every motion melody; Thou bathest in eternal streams Of endless hope and joy, and findest Repose and light in all heaven's schemes, Which seem the strangest and the blindest.
Thou hallowed goddess of my heart, Tell me, O tell me where thou art! Where thine eternal home ? and say, May not my spirit wend its way (For passionate longing might find pinions To reach even thy sublime dominions) To thine abode ? Can nought but spirit Thy presence seek, thy friendship merit ? Why struggling after thee, O why, Sink we in deep obscurity ?
Yet when at morning-dawn I bring A matin-incense to thine altarWhen, tho* I scarcely breathe, but falter, And at the evening twilight fling



JOHN KIS. 77
My heart before thee,—on the wing Of the calm breeze, methinks 1 hear Thy voice—O tell me, art thou there ? Methinks, when at the midnight hour, In solemn silence fluttering by, The whisper that some viewless power Passes, in angel-chariot, nigh; Methinks that whisper needs must be Some herald's voice announcing thee.

Hej juhasz bojtar ! hoi a' juh ?
SAY, Shepherd ! where thy sheep are gone, And why this discontented frown ? They're wending forth to Balaton,* And heavy sorrows press me down. I eat not, drink not—but I lie Like a felPd trunk upon the plain ; The sun sinks downwards from the sky, And gives me up to night and pain. O hopeless doom \ She turns away, Indifference in her eyes I see ; In vain my Shepherd's pipe I playShe listens not, nor looks on me. The freshest milk, the whitest lamb, And wreaths of knots, to her I bore; And all I have, and all I amLife, soul—would give, to win her o'er. Her face f I press'd with kisses sweet, Upon her breast my sighs outpour'd, Fell, like a pilgrim, at her feet, And drank her every breath and word.

But what of this ? She knows it all, And all forgets—she laughs at woe ; No pity on despair lets fall; For other youth her passions glow. But God shall punish her. O why, Why was that lovely maid untrue ? Why did she bid my pleasure die r Why pierce my heart, and pierce it through ? When shepherdless my sheep shall stray, And madness thought and hope destroy, " Shame on the maid!" the youths will say; " Poor fool! beloved Shepherd boy!"

COTTAGER'S SONG.
Nem adott az Isten nSkem nagy palotat.
No elegant palace God raised o'er my head, Rich tapestry gave not, nor silk to my bed; But a cottage of peace, and a rude, healthy life, And, to crown my enjoyments, a brown, cheerful wife. Together we earn the coarse bread which we eat, And love makes it taste more delightfully sweet; When our labours are ended, together we rest, And each to the other's bare bosom is prest. The sun rises up—and we rise, full of joy, Full of strength, to the busy day's wonted employ. Then the spring dawns in green, and the fields smile anew, And every fresh flow'ret is dripping with dew; And the song of the lark pours its melodies sweet, Like a zephyr of freshness on summer's close heat. Then comes the gay vintage—the red grapes we bear, And alike of the labor and recompence share. The winter puts on its white robes—we retire At even—and bend o'er our own cottage fire. My Sari turns round the gay spindle and sings, And out of our happiness time makes its wings. I have handicraft labors—and, happy the thought, For this pay no taxes to Germans—nor ought.

The sabbath comes round, and in holiday gear I go to God's dwelling—then quietly steer To the Kortsma,* where, cheer'd by a wine-loving brother, We pledge a full glass, and we laugh with each other; Get warm, and we call on the Gipsies to play. I know of no care, roll the world as it may: I nothing am owed, and to nobody oweHurting none, none will hurt me—so smiling we go On the rude path of life—when its labors are past, Death will find us both ready and cheerful at last.

LOOK at the dance! You may trace in its playful and varying changes National manners and habits—the feelings and thoughts of the people. First, see the German come forward—and, waltzing three paces, he seizes Her whom he loves, and he gracefully wheels her in lightfooted circle: Simple and quiet in all things—his very enjoyments are tranquil: One and one only he claims—if he love her, his love wUbe faithful. Giddy and graceful and vain, comes the Frenchman, and, ogling and sporting, Flits from one maid to another*—to this and to that his hand proffers: Fiery and rash as a child, like a child he is light and capricious ; Changes his mistress at will, and bumours his fancy till weary. Whelmed in a passionate storm, the Magyar's turbulent spirit Blends in the dance all the heat of his struggling and glowing affection,



120 DANIEL BERZSENYI.
Like a sweet breeze—and his soul-piercing softness insinuates All that is hid in the depths of his gcn'rous and love-flowing spirit. Link'd and dissevered, he leads or is led by the lovely Hungarian; Dances alone in his joy, while all the earth trembles delighted. This is the warrior's dance, which Kinysi, with blood* spotted weapons, Danced with his followers around the heaps of his enemies scattered. Here are no rules of art, no masters of science assembled; This is her own bright law—'tis fancy's own free-pinion'd charter. Let ev'ry man who is born to the dance of the Magyar be joyful;
Strength and vigor are hi>, Inspiring his spirit with, firmness.

From laughing love and song and jest, From blessing, I would fain be blest: Bliss flaps my soul on every breeze, And am I blest with thoughts like these ?

Are not my meadows verdant as Tarentum ? Are not my fields as lovely as Larissa ? Flows not the Tiber with majestic beaming Through my darkforest?
Have I not vines and golden corn-ears dancing In the gay winds, and doth not heavenly freedom Dwell in my dwelling ?—Yes! the gods have given me All I could envy.

O'er all the earth he spreads birth-giving ether, Waking to life what wintry cold had frozen, Calling to joy, and budding into being, Countless creations*'
Flora attends him with her smiles of beauty, Scattering before him violets and roses; Laughter and love and bliss, and all the graces, Follow his footsteps.

JOYOUS as the wild squirrel in the forest, Or in the dancing waves the silver eel, Till thou, to the bright heaven, in which thou soarest, Didst fascinate my footsteps, Isabel! O, I was happy—now, alas! thou pourest A stream of sorrow into my heart's well; And hill and valley's echoes wake the sorest Of all the pangs of grief ineffable, That thou—thou art another's—that sad thought Breaks up my heart—and o'er my being flings The deepest clouds of darkness—they have brought Garlands of flowers to crown thee at the shrine Of Hymen. Joy the marriage-anthem singsYet they have brought thee not a love like mine.

I HEARP a gentle breathing, like a sigh, I saw a quiet smiling, like the dawn, A bosom heaving 'neath th' o'ershadowing lawn, Half hidden, half unveil'd. A raptur'd cry Broke from me—" Yes! 'tis thou:" and then I flung My arms around thee, and in passionate bliss Joy followed joy, and kiss gave way to kiss, And rapture fetter'd both—and thus she sung: " Thou I so long have sought for, thou art mine; Thine is the maiden's sweetest kiss, and thine All that the maiden's heart and soul possess." I listen'd—and suchflutteringsof delight Shook all my senses, I was silent quiteThoughts overpower'd expression. Could they less ?

THOU art mute, all but thy sighing—and the tear Rolls down thy cheek its sad and silent way; And thou dost turn to mortal men, and say, " Pour out your sympathy, and sooth me here." Thou dreaming, hapless creature ! learn, that'they Will turn on thee a cold and listless ear; And thou thy gloomy pilgrimage mayst steer Through mists and storms and sorrows. They are gay, However dark thy grief; no sympathy ' Is in their breasts. But come, O come to me, Who am a mourner too—and I will mourn With thee. Hath death distressed thee > Tell the name Of thy lost love—I will repeat the same, And we will weep together o'er her urn.

For a wild fire is burning in my bosom, Which I can quench not—which I cannot guide* I strive to build the fair—to baild the fairest Upon the wise—as thou would teach me; I Would blend my spirit and my heart in one, Making my hymn both beautiful and strong; That it may teach—and teaching, may transport With ecstacy. I ask, with prayerful tear, My way to fame's bright goal: thou hast the crownTeach me to win and wear it—I beseech thee, With passionate longings I beseech thee—say, Say—thus ? Ah, no! 'tis sweet—but not successful. I cannot reach the bourn—and life to me Is melancholy waste of life!"

Thou turns't away in sadness from its waves So troubled—for 'tis purity that charms, And quiet. Think on this, and be at rest. The muse is a soft maiden, whose bright wand, Whose odorous ringlets, flinging light around, Thy lips may kiss. She is not wooed by fierceness, But turns, deep blushing, to her own sweet self, From the wild turbulent grasp of stormy thought.
" Glow—but glow not with blind and savage heat; Approach, with gentleness, and she will wake Her own responses from thy feeling breast; Her bright eye will enkindle loveliest light, Thy soul transporting. Gently, gently come, And she shall press thee to her breast—that breast So soft, so warm—and gently kiss her lips; Her breatH shall then impregnate thee—her fires Bear thee aloft above a thousand stars, And summon from thy soul harmonious songs."

LIFE AND FANCY.
DARK-VESTED spirits Hidden in vapours, Point out and fashion Man's gloomy journey; Thro* his life's mysteries, Heartless and silent, Over his path-way Sharp thorns they scatter, And with cold grasp They fling the poor mortal In the rough ocean Of time's dreary desert. Loud-foaming billows, Stormy winds struggling, Whelming and whirling Life's little bark; Now on the wave-top Flung in their fury, Up to the clouds ; Now in abysses Yawning destruction, Deep as the grave: Fearful the struggle



CHARLES KISFALUDY. 143
With furies unbridled, Wresting and wrestling In the fierce storm. Now with swoln bosom Drives he for land, Out of the darkness Dawning—but distant, Hope with her smiles Looks from the strand. Lo! an Aurora, Promising beauty, Pours out bright dew-drops Fluttering with bliss; Nay I granite mountains, Spurn back the ocean: Warm is the contestBack with the wavesAnd they roll fiercer, While with strong jpassion Stronger and stronger Strives the poor swimmer; One drop of water, Fresh, pure, and sparkling, One—and one only, Vainly to reach. Serpents ding round him, Laughing like demons Most when he writhes; Doubt* dreary tempests



144 CHARLES KISFALUDY.
Rattling above him Chase the sweet dreamings Justice and virtue Waked in the frozen Shrines of his soul. Wild he looks round On the desolate world. Shadows attend him Beckoning and trembling, Mists, glooms, and terrors, Flit o'er the waste. One ray of lightning Now and then brightning O'er his griefs' gloom; When his eyes weeping In the vast void Sees hope-directedThe tomb. Light is descending; See, from the clouds, Dovelets attending, A goddess appears! Waked by her glances, Beautiful spirits Flit in their transports Through the gay scene; Dew-drops of heaven Shine in her eyes, Seraphs of brightness



CHARLES KISFALUDY. 145
Bend from the skies, And Edens of bliss Out of deserts arise. The winds sport together, In gentleness blending O'er flower-sprinkled fields Their cops full of honey, Their lips of perfume, They dream of delight; All nature is laughing, And e'en the grave's height Has its bloom. Man waxes divine, And is wafted above; In spring and in beauty, In brightness and virtue, He clasps to his bosom Young nature—in love. He feels that his lot Is immortal; the fire Of the Godhead within hint Is burning—still burning, And thought ever turning To prospects eternal, Eternal desire. His dust may not waken Till heavenly breath Has melted the fetters ) Of darkness and death.



146 CHARLES KISFALUDY.
He lies on the border, Faint—helpless—till fancy, That sweet mate of reason, Hath broken his fetters, And led him to light. And still let her flight Be unbridled—beyond The precincts of vision, Her glories still weaving In beauty and light.

AGES OF LIFE.

MID smiling friends and sports, for, far from sorrow, Hanging around a mother's lap, we play In the bright sunshine of our childhood's morrow, Nor dream of any darker future day: We smile on smiling hours that pass, and borrow No gloom from all the mists that dim our way; But rise and fall on every floating wave, And with each image sweet communion have.
Each blessed sunbeam in that glorious time Wakes us to never-palling jests and joys; And transport—in those days, unstained by crime, Flings all around her, roses—nor annoys Our innocent paths with pains. Though not sublime, Yet sweet as honey dew, the hours when boys Dance on the emerald grave-heaps of the dead, And upward, heavenward, all their footsteps tread.
And now the bud of lovely Hope is bursting, And a new life its streams of passion pours; And, like sweet, shadowed dreams, which fancy nurs'd in Our parents9 bosoms, all the household shores L2



H 8 CHARLES KISPALUDY.
Which seemed so bright and beautiful at first, in Dimness are shaded. Yet the spirit soars To something far above its narrow cell, And seeks with brighter thoughts than earth's to dwell.
There is an impulse bidding us break through Our prison's bounds: a world before us lies Gladdened with glories fascinating, new,And fragrant flow'rs and lovely fantasies: So the soul waxes strong, and to pursue Its noble destiny and high emprise Will wrestle with all foes—all storms will meet, Crushing all disappointments 'ueath its feet*
The spirit feels its dignity of fehrth And destination, in the mighty strife It holds with all the storminess of earth: It bends not to the yoke of mortal life, But strives at something greater—feels a dearth In worldly luxury—in aspirings rife It mounts on mightier wings than time's—and flies To heights which o'er heaven's highest torches rise.
It clads itself in purple like the morn's, And walks in its imperial dignityDives to the deepest seats of thought—adorns The very drearoings which around us l i e Wakes images of light and beauty—-scorns Th' infirmities of human destiny,



CIIARI.ES KISFALUDY. 149
Pointing to hope's own pyramid sublimeA watch-tower o'er the waves and storms of time.
First, youth's pure love develops the high source Of intellect within him—gives it wings Heavenward to urge its passion-prompted course. While to his breast the lovely loved-one clings, Into one maddening moment is the force Of all existence flung—and angel-wings Are borrowed for a time—while Hymen's breeze Wafts two united spirits' harmonies.
And so sweet chains surround us till we die, And when we die, we sleep—we toil, we rest: The visions of life's morning-twilight flyGrief cools the life-blood boiling in our breastThe buds are blown away—the fruit is nighAnd man by time's strong urgency is press'd. On, on to labor—duty must be heard; She speaks in majesty the mighty word,
" Country V—-the invaders on her bosom tread: Up to the field—he stands among the brave; His cheeks with freedom's roseate glow are red, And he is there to sink, or there to save. Amidst the ghastly forms of death, no dread Is his—indifferent if a hero's grave Or garland wait him—if he dies, or lives, Some brighter pledge he to the future gives.



150 CHARLES KISFALUDY.
Trembles ? He trembles as the granite trembles, Lashed by the waves; for the courageous heart Bastions of brass around its shrines assembles, Which snap or spurn away the sharpest dart. Duty becomes delight, toil joy resembles, And health and bliss are labor's better part; While love for lovely women—and for friend Friendship—and tenderness for children—blend,
Blend in a beauteous light* Creation's power Flings radiance on the soul, and leads it on, Firm as a column, through its mortal hour, Stretching for higher recompense. Anon Both heaven and earth their benedictions shower On that which is their kindred, and hath won Their own reflection—while its torch will light Through the world's darkness and its own dark night
So speed we—so we sink—so disappearSo fades our little lamp—and so we fade. Winter will scatter snow-storms on our bier, And midnight mantle darkness round our beadAnd graves will yawn—and death, with frown austere, Fill up our hearts with ashes of the deadAnd joy will be a grief—and lust will pallAnd all be tasteless, hopeless—heartless all.
And all life's painted shadows disappear, While solitude puts out her frozen hand



CHARLES KISFALUDY. 15]
To lead us, hapless, to that unknown sphere Which ignorance has called the promised land, And blindness, peace. Cold mistiness is there, Clouding around that superhuman band Which shines like moonlight rays upon the waves, And rears green altars over mouldering graves.
It may be—nay! it is—a sleep as sweet As ever infant slept. 'Tis more: to hope Is nothing—confidence and faith are meet For mortals: there is an eternal scope For immortality. When death we greet, . We greet a resurrection—and we ope Heaven's mansions, making room for other mortals As deafh wafts our poor ashes through life's portab.

SOUND OF SONG.
Minden OrOm hangot szril, a' t>6 '« f&jdalom \sm6t.
JOY has its voice—-so has grief! There are eloquent tears; and deep sorrows Melt into songs—in the fields wliich grow green the sweet nightingale sings; Genius and Love never meet hut the spirit of muric is near them; When the heart speaks, lend thine ear—lend thine ear, for its language is song.

LOVELY LENKA.
Szep Lcnka var &' part felett.
H E lingers on the ocean shore, The seaman in his boat; The water-spirit's music o'er The ruffled wave doth float " Maiden of beauty! counselled be, The tempest wakes from out the sea."
" I may not stay," the maiden cried, " Tho' loud the tempest blow; That meadow on the water s i d e That cottage—bids me go. That shady grove, that murmurs near, Invites me—he I love is there."
" The wave is high—the storm is loud, And dangers rise anon."" But hope sits smiling on the cloud, Storms drive the vessel on. And joy and sorrow both convey Man's mortal bark along its way."
Into the seaman's boat she stept, The helm the seaman took; The storming billows fiercely swept, And all the horizon shook.



FHANCIS KOLCSEY. 155
The maiden spoke—" Ye fears, be gone ! The storm-wind drives the vessel on*"
" O maiden ! darker is the sky, And fiercer is the wind; Alas! there is no harbour nigh, No refuge can we find. A whirlpool is the angry sea, It will engulph both thee and me."
" No, seaman ! fortune always shone And still will shine on me; Soon will the stormy clouds be gone, And sunbeams calm the sea, And evening bring the promised dove, And evening guide me to my love."
She turned her to the distant strand, (He stood upon the spot)In sweet delirium stretched her hand, And winds and waves forgot. So is love's spirit overfraught With love's intensity of thought.
He stood—a statue on the shore, A pale—ice-hardened form : The billows battling more and more, And louder waxed the storm. Clouds—waves, all mingled—and the boat ? Its scattered planks asunder float.



156 FRANCIS KOLCSEY.
Where is she ? Ask the storm ! for he No single tear has shed; And he ? Go ask the silent s e a Its echoes answer « Dead!" I held communion with its waves, But could not find the lovers' graves.

BOAT SONG.
Ultero csolnakomban.
O'ER th' unsteady wavelets I my boat sped, Heard the crane's wing fluttering Over my head; Thou, heaven's pilgrim, flying O'er land and sea, Would it were my privilege To fly with thee.
Wisely art thou seeking Some fairer clime, Springtide's vernal beauties, Summer's bright time; Thy blest track I follow, With thee I roam, Seek a better country And a sweet home.
Seek a home of sweetness •Neath heaven's blue, Where no winter darkens, No noisome dew:



158 FRANCIS KOLCSEY.
Where are lovely rainbows Made by hope bright, Morning waking morning, Glorious in light.
Thro' the verdant branches, Soft west-winds sigh; Near my hut a streamlet Glides gently by. Boat! may God be with theeThou stormy strand! See my sweet one calls me, Waving her hand.
O'er th' unsteady wavelets, I my boat sped, Heard the crane's wing Buttering Over my head; Fly, thou heavenly pilgrim, O'er earth and sea, But my fate forbids me To fly with thee.



FRANCIS KOMJSEY. 159
TO FANCY.
COME, bright-eyed Fancy, smiling, and unlock me Those dreamy regions where thoti reignest yet; In thy bright cradle curtain me and rock me, As Venus rocks young Cupid, her sweet pet. As through life's dark and solitary forest T tread, surround me with thy balmy air; Let the glad notes of melody thou pourest, Be like the nightingales' that warble there.
Dreaming upon thy lap, I call the maiden Mine, who is mine no longer—and am blest; Dreaming upon thy lap—though sorrow-laden, I find in silent tears the thought of rest. Thou misery's burden wondrously dost lighten, And minglest joy with such creative power, That shadow'd doubts, to hope, to rapture, brighten, And patience dawns upon the troubled hour.
A dark blue veil upon the future lowers, And hides my coming doom—in vain I gaze; While from my heart a flame of light uptowers, Flinging its radiance o'er departed days.



160 FRANCIS KoLCSEY.
The present's narrow limits swiftly widen, And joy drives sorrow from the path of life ; Sweet roses bloom beneath my feet unbidden, While beauty takes the seat of woe and strife.
Then come the sylphids on their downy pinions; Then bows Favonius from his cloudy throne; Joy builds a shrine in the green earth's dominions, And I hang smiling o'er my loving one. So lives the butterfly—amidst the blisses Of the fresh breeze enamour'd—on his bliss; So—the sweet lips of balmy flowers he kisses, Flowers that give back again his eager kiss.

LOVE'S FESTIVAL.
THERE are dark clouds upgathered in the heavens, And the full moon can hardly look them through ; All nature sleeps, wrapp'd round in misty dew, And the stars shine not, while in slumber's arms All find repose ; life's heavy load forgot. All ? No! I in the green shade slumber not; For a transporting hope holds aM my soul, Round me the fragrant clouds of Jasmines rolL •Twas here—'twas here she spoke at eventide; Here said, Farewell! And will she camp again When fair Chitona fills her lamp ?—In vain I wait—that lamp is filled. Where tarries she ? Impatience, weary of her lingering, stands, And doubt comes on the mind overwhelmingly.
She comes ! she comes!—I hear the rustling leaves; Nay, 'twas the trembling which my sighs awaken, As gliding thro' the branches idly shaken; They rouse delusive thought, which only grieves. What, what forbids her to these arms to flee! Why would she make of love a mockery ? Why will she trifle with my misery ? Why ? O ye warm-breathings of my bosom—plaints Of deepest-drawn emotion—hasten—fly

LOVELY MAID.
H6, vagy hab, vagy csillag r£mlik.
IS'T snow, or star, or wavelet, In the valley's depth that plays ? 'Tis neither—but a meteor That sparkles—that betrays.
Neither snow, nor star, nor wavelet, Is crown'd with ringlet hair; But a maiden crown'd with ringlets, Bathes in the streamlet there.
With grace beyond expression She bows her lovely head ; Her hand holds up a flow'ret, By those sweet waters fed.
The wind is whispering secrets Into that maiden's ear; The branches trembling round her, Seem all attracted near.
How swiftly would I bend me, Were I but one of these ! How fondly would I kiss her, Were I a heavenly breeze!



1 7 4 MICHAEL VOROSMARTY.
Around her beauteous members, Delighted fishes play; The rivulet, hush'd to silence, Long tarries on its way.
Still longer should I tarry, Were I that silent stream ; But midst those fish to revel, Would be the bliss supreme.
Ne'er would I leave those waters, Where tread that maiden's feet; But kiss1 and kiss untiring, And die in bliss so sweet.
But how! my eyes deceive me; This dream—tho' bright it beIs but a mortal likeness Of one less fair than she.
As in her beauteous shadow, All earthly beauties fade; So fades the maid's fair shadow, Before the fairer maid.
'Twas but a feeble picture, 'Twas but a shadow rude, That playing in the wavelets, In maiden beauty stood.

Arpad's dominions were peril'd in Solomon's dangerous rule-time; Still it stood firm and unshaken—in strength of unperishing manhood's Heroes undaunted: and most in the happier days of their concord; Countless their enemies' graves, as countless their enemies' armies.

Like a tall rock, that towers from the earth with a doublecrown'd summit, Reaching to heav'n—from the east and from west reaching upwards to heaven; Sunshine and day on its sides, while its brow is o'erturban'd in darkness; Round it the lightning plays till weary, like innocent childhood; Fixed are its roots in the earth, in its greatness and grandeur reposing: Such was the land of Arpad, and the storms and the flashings of danger Roll'd unmolestingly by—all harmless the rage and the thunder. Then with his armies went forth, like the light-giving beam of the noontide, Solomon Kiral, with twain of the noblest and choicest of heroes, Bela's descendants—wise Ge*za, and he of the battle-axe, Laszl6Laszl6 the terrible: both seemed bright as the blessing of heaven* Courage and power were theirs, and the union of temperate prudence Shielded the land from the day of precipitate fell and perdition.

Prince of the Kunians, Ozul—now where, with thy passionate legions ? Backwards thy banners are blown with the breath of the north wind chilling: Thrice hath thy steed wheeled round—he will not bear thee onward. Look! for the birds of prey are screaming frightfully o'er thee, Gathering together in crowds—the famishing broods are impatient, Waiting to feed their fill of thy multitudinous warriors; Lo! how they hasten now! for their glorious festival longing. There, as the wolf invades the fold of the shepherd, and ruthless Plunders, ravages, raves, 'midst the terror-struck flocks, till the sheep-dogs Howl in the distance, the dogs with the spike-girded collars—the shepherd Steps o'er the threshold, excited, the terrified robber pursuing,

So in their murderous purpose the enemy came, and Nyerseg Ravaged. Their footsteps of violence crushed all the fruits of the Theiss, while Blood spouted forth on her sands. Bihar saw the terrible ruinsSaw—'twas too late: death sat on the gloom-cover'd brows of the valiant; Grey-headed men o'er the dead sigh'd despairingly; all their life-currents Flow'd like a slow stream of bitterness. Babes on their cradles disordered, Wept in their innocent woe; their mothers, Ozul's cruel bandits Led bound in cords: heavy chains they fetter'd on youths and on maidens, Driv'n into slavery—slavery hopeless of any redemption. There was old Ernyei shorn of his fortune—one treasure, one only; She of the auburn hair—Etelke—Etelke the lovely: Nay! not Etelke—how hollow and heavy the sound of « Etelke! " O, had I delved thy grave, had I made thee a bed on the silent Bosom of earth, I had known it! If whelmed in the stream of the Danube, Borne on the fown-color'd waters, pursued by an army of fishes, Still I had known it! If, gathered in desolate sadness and sorrows, N2

Youths round thy death-couch were crowded, still, still—Shall my spirit Sink in despair ? No! I'll suffer and breathe resignation. Blessed be God!—I look round me—I look—but mine eyes can see nothing. Loudly I call—and 1 hear but the echoes. Tears fall on my bosom. Groaning 1 ask, Doth a God still dwell in the precincts of heavenOne who old Ernyei hears and pities? Or, visiting error, Awfully flings he his bolts at the sins which stand blazing before him ?" So mourned the wretched old man, and buckled about him his weapons, Trembling. The King rises up; and the fame-covered children of Bela On to the field—'twas in haste and in gloom—they were girded for battle.
Round the hill, like clouds, the hosts of Ozul were collected : He, 'neath gorgeous tent, was laid on magnificent carpets: Under his feet was his club; at his head was the battle trumpet; Stuck on his spear his cap; but his sword to his side was belted; Firm in his terrible hand the sheath: around him singers and dancers



MICHAEL VOROSMARTY. 1 8 1
Sported, and spread the spoil; while sad and beautiful women Sung of OzuPs proud feats, and the horrible days of carnage. Bonger's son alone, the stately one, Arbocz, scornful Stood in the crowd, and flung his hate and his pride around him. He, like the eagle watching the timorous brood, seems to linger : Most when most longing to pounce on the prey. In the silent Rapture of joy and of fear in the circle he stood, where approaching, Fair as a statue of marble, Etelke, the brown-hair'd, the lovely Near'd. She looked round, if the dust of the plain by the army of Laszl6 Rose—if her father were there with the well-known, the wind-flapping banners. All, all was silence—all silence—except the loud tones of the mirthful Girdling thy limits, Cserhalom! and echo returned the rejoicings. Laszl6 appeared not then—the wind-flapping banner appear'd not, Held by her father aloft: but, many a youthful one greeting. Arbocz approach'd, whose eye was still fixed on the face of the maiden.

First was the silence broke by the voice of the dark-eyed K<!ddr: " Beauteous is the swan, when calmly from heaven descending Towards his well-loved home from foreign and distant waters: Gracefully glides he on o'er his natural lake, while above him Moon and stars scatter round their exquisite light-rays of silver. Thou, O Bonger's fortunate son! the maiden is for more lovely; Whiter her breast than the snowy down of the swan's snowy bosom. See, she weeps, she weeps. Go, Arbocz—the tears of the mourner Dry; on her brows sits hot sweat—and see, for her forehead is burning." Frowningly look'd the son of Bonger, the stately one, Arbocz: " Light-thoughted Kodor ! enough of such sportive and frivolous language; Words such as thine may provoke—I can bear them an instant—no longer." Kodor retired; but there came a legion of boisterous comrades: One thus laughingly spake: " Arbocz, I pray, if thon love me, Sell me one smile of the prisoner. She turns—O how lovely her motions!



MICHAEL VOROSMARTY. 1 8 3
Covering her brow—what a languishing look! what a beautiful figure! Exquisite grace when she stirs!—'tis the beautiful bend of the wavelet. Speaks she r Ten pieces of gold would I give for each word that she utters. Give me her smile, and Til give thee my bow with the costly adornings." " Arbocz," another cried—" thou foolish one! leave me an instant Resting beneath the shade of her auburn hair, and my spirit More shall joy than to steal the pearls of a thousand oceans.9' Then a third appear'd and began: " Thou art far too flighty; I alone deserve an exquisite word to utter. Maiden ! thou dost right well not to hide thy feet so lovely; Beautiful they as the piles of the foam which the wind awakens: Happy indeed were I, could I bow me down and kiss them. May I not watch the print of her exquisite footsteps, Arbocz ? Prints she leaves in the sands; on my shield I'll engrave them, and bear them Over the earth till I find a maiden whose foot-print shall match them." Dember the strong, Czika's son, was of all the most tlesome youth there;



1 8 4 MICHAEL VOROSMARTY.
Rosy his cheeks, while his locks fell in light-color'd shocks on his shoulders; Slender and tall was his form; his glance was a sharppointed dagger; Stormy his soul when the flame flashed forth of the good and the lovely. Forward he sprang—saw the maid—was astounded—and eloquent language Burst unprepared from his lips: " Heaven certainly means to chastise thee, Arbocz, who stealest its gems—or the maid steals its beauty from heavenPunished on earth for a while. No woman e'er bore such a beauty; Milk never fed her; she drank alone the ambrosia of Eden. Breezes play timidly round her, and exquisite dews of the morning Damp her fair cheeks, which are fairer—aye, fairer by far, than Aurora's, Aurora's that blush with deep hues of shame and of jealousy mingled. Look on her eye—it has nought that is earthly—'tis like a black fragment Torn from the midnight, and flung on the sun's burning centre. Its glory Not brighter than that of her glances. Speak, Arbocz!from morning I'll pray thee; Bring thee the sun and the torches of heaven to purchase the maiden:



MICHAEL VoRoSMARTY. 185
She is my life-giving day-light—beyond her all shadows and darknessDarkness and nothingness all." But the maiden stood trembling in sorrow. Arbocz towYd up erect o'er the crowd; he look'd on them fiercely; Half unsheath'd his sword while he spoke: " Are ye more ? Have yefinish'd? Babblers 1 what would ye ? Have I—have I interrupted your pleasures ? Why will ye weary the ears with your childish and spiritless prattle ? Fling yourselves off—far too long have I borne ye: and, idle ones ! listen : One—aye, one single word more of such insolent jeers, and 'twere better, Far better, the jeerer from birth had been blind and been dumb; for I'll smite him With blindness and speechlessness here on the spot where he sports with his insults." Said—and the youths gather'd round the intemperate, passionate stormer: Dember held fast his sword. Arbocz his harangue had but ended When the proud Ozul came forward, and glanced at the maiden: " Truly, 'twas not in vain Arbocz in the battle-tents tarried; He guards a beautiful treasure: but list to the word of Ozul now.



186 MICHAEL VoRoSMARTY.
Give the maiden to me—and instead, take my daughter, young Zeje; Rich is she in song, and bright as the brightest starlet; Softer is she than dew—and never has slept on man's bosom. Five good battle steeds of the strongest, swiftest, and youngest, Saddled, with gold and with riches caparison'd, cheerfully give I. This—yes, and more, will I give to thefortunatehero who wins her." Swift did Bonger's son, the stately one, Arbocz, answer: " Victory-crown'd Oziil! I give thee all thanks and all honor; Great is thy favor to me—to me, last and least of thy heroesOffering thy Zeje, Forgive my rejection : in vain from the maiden Strive I to tear my heart; my heart she hath steadfastly fetter'd. Noble thy gifts, I own; thy presents well worthy of princes; Yet, could thy battle steeds fly as swift as the swift winds of heavenWere the trappings of gold pluck'd forth from the stars of the concave, Dazzling and glorious—in vain were they weigh'd in exchange for the maiden. If ever disheartened in battle thou find me, produce hermy courage



MICHAEL VoRdSMARTY. 187
Will wake and be worthy of thee." Thus Arbocz. Then answer'd the hero, " True, thou art proud; but thy pride shall enkindle no hatred towards thee: Still, if thou long for the strife, being far more imprudent than valiant, Know that my arm shall overwhelm thee, and give the fair maid to> my servant." "Never!" cried Arboez—and, stinging with passion, he started and seized his Sword, while his rage brought blood to his eye-balls, glaring with fury. Ozul withdrew with the youths. And such were the pleasant discussions Gathering the people together. By Ernyei's trump-call assembled, Solomon's armies came : in might with the troops of the monarch, Geza was there, and the mighty one, Laszl6: in furious disorder Pour'd they, a river resistless, o'er Bihar's all desolate borders. Arbocz grew calm at last, though vexation was rife within him: Spreading round him a mantle light, o'er his shield the striped skin of the tiger, Then he dried the tears of the maiden with gentle endearment;



188 MICHAEL VdRdSMARTY.
Low at her feel he sat, pouring words of love and of comfort. Once did the maiden ope her pure and rose-tinged lips, which Breathed such beautiful tones, that the very breezes caught them: " Hero ! thou wert begot by a strong and generous father; Born of a joyous mother at morning's loveliest dawning. Thou, thou didst grieve me not; thou lettedst not others grieve me; Soothing the prisoner's pang, and easing the chains of bondage. So, when I utter prayer, and sink at the Deity's footstool, All thy fondest hopes shall mingle with my petitions. Thee would I preserve in the bloody perils of battle; Thee, from the edge of the sword. Let thy destiny keep thee from peril. Hither, O hither, approach not. The lioness rearing her cubs, the Dragon that wastes the south, are milder when raging in fury Than the herd of the three-crown'd hill, than the fruitful sons of Hunnia. He rushes—they all arise—the youth are gather'd together; Love's very wreaths forgot in that fearful hour of danger. Power, powerful though it be, by a mightier power is vanquished :



MICHAEL VOROSMARTY. 1 8 9
Aggression but calls up more terrible aggression. Prince of tbe battle-axe — he, the dreadful and terrible stniter, Laszl6—he only—he goes with his army to fight and to conquest, Arbocz, behold! Well I know the troops of Ozul came to ravage. Perchance thou dost curse me—while I fain would find thee a shelter of safety. Fly ! fly I I tell tbee—aye, fly as far as thou canst—lest the mountain Cserhalom swallow thee up with the hosts of the overthrown foemen, Crush'd, blown away in the dust, by Solomon's far-spreading army. Come, rather lead me to dwell in the far distant hall of my father: He, white-hair'd old man, tears his hair in his sadness and sorrow. Come—when he sees us approach, he'll thank thee with tears—O believe me! Thank thee with tears—who restorest his daughter—and cheerfully give thee All that thou wilt to redeem me. Thy path is before thee all darkness: Stumbles thy war-steed there: it is cover'd with heaps of the dying: Birds of prey hover o'er. When the night and its clouds are approaching,



190 MICHAEL VORoSMARTY.
Enemies gird thee round. * Who is here ?' thou inquirest No answer. Look on Ozul, for the moon shines bright on his bloodcover'd forehead. Nay! thou wilt save the child, the child of the snowy-hair'd hero; Or wilt thou haste to the field, to the sorrow-clad field of thy brethren ?" Arbocz with gloomy heart to the words of the prisoner listened; Still he repressed the storm of his easily-waken'd anger, Look'd on the maiden's face and answer'd her—" Lovely Etelke! Dreams, vain dreams, are these: words never made heroes tremble: Men, with murderous weapons, alone do this. But a maiden's Menace!—Nay! Roses close their beautiful lips till the morning Warms their bosom anew withthe light and joy of the sunshine ; • Dews on the leaflets shake, and the winds of the valley blow gently; Then unveil they their charms, then 'fling they their smiles around them: So, if thou hide thy head in the clouds, the gloom is but transient; Dark for an instant thine eyes, by those beautiful eye-brows o'ershaded;



MICHAEL VOROSMARTY. - 1 9 1
Soon do they shine, as the rainbow the south-seeking sun paints so gaily. Sad art thou, maiden, and anxious—yet sportive and smiling thou seemest; Lovelier far, and thy cheeks are more beautiful, hiding thy sorrow. List, and Til tell thee why Arhocz elected thee : Maiden ! Never again shall we reach the cherish'd abode of thy comrades. Joyful they sit in the porch, while they hear the old song of the battle; Pledging some distant companion—not knowing how idly they pledge him The death-glass—-and he whom they pledge is departed for ever. We hasten On, on; and in faith all your heroes may cut through the far slower south-windFollow the shadows that flit in the frown-curtain'd regions of darkness, Stretching in giant stride, like ghosts that grow huger in distance. Truly, they never shall reach us; and great is their fortune and favor, Spared by our darts, which might bring them the message of death. But I'll bring thee . Home to some isle of the ocean, that smiles in the beams of the morning;



192 MICHAEL V0R08MARTV.
Sweetest the song of the nightingale, greenest the leaves of the forest, Softest the sounds of the winds, and brightest the azure of heaven: Apples of exquisite taste hang there on the ground-kissing branches. Thee shall no bird overtake — faint and feeble the flight of the eagle; Tracking our course, shall he droop on his whirling and wearisome pinions. Tiresome the way for man; not one of a thousand can pass it. Even the man thou didst name, the man of the battle-axe, dreadful Laszl6—aye, cleanse he thy land for his followers—know, he shall perish, Perish—-and all the wave's monsters shall feed on the wrecks of his armies. He—when his armour of brightness invites the great fish of the ocean, Moving glibly on, while the soak'd and wandering members Fall in his man-devouring maw—shall die. Dost grieve thou art helpless > Nothing thy pride can do 'gainst power. Far better the transports Love will give in the grasp of an age of youthful vigor. Scorn not bliss that asks thy welcoming, but dispose thee, Maid, for love—my hand—my hand of faith do I proffer.



MICHAEL VoROSMARTY. 193
Say, wilt be the slave, or rather the sovereign, of Arbocz ?v Craftily thus he spoke, and bade her forget her countryBade her make him alone the care and love of her bosom. Silly one ! O'er the plain the armies of bronze are shining; Dust in clouds upsoars, and crowds of heroes are coming. " Talpra vitez I" * exclaim'd Ozul in his haughtiest bidding; " Talpra vit6z!" around Cserhalom's borders was echoed. Shouts and cries were heard where the Kunians march'd with their weapons. Arbocz trembled then — looking round with fright and terror, Like a sleeping man who is roused by the rumbling of thunder: So he stood—and the dreams of his folly and lust were scattered; Other thoughts were his than the thoughts of the fair Etelke. Horrors came o'er his soul, like waves on the ocean troubled. Soon did the armorist come—he came with his lance and charger. Frighten'd, the lovely maid had hastened to meet him; yet pleasure, • Pleasure was in her soul, though tears in her eye—tears of gladness:
• Ou, Warriors!
O



194 MICHAEL VORoSMARTY.
Yet she wept—she wept; while, tossing his head in disquiet, Arbocz wander'd round, made hoarse by the longing for combat: AH his gentleness gone, he utter'd these words of impatience: " Weeping, forsooth !—yet these, all these, to their deathbed are hast'ning. Weep—thon shalt weep no more. Expect me delighted from battle." Said, and he sprung on his steed, and he rash'd 'midst the thick of the squadrons.
Hark ! for the trump is loud, and the combatant weapons are clashing; Volumes of dust, shouts and cries, ascend from the crush of the warriorsTones of confusion and moans, and the manifold accents of passion. Over the rest, Ozul, on his chestnut war-steed advancing, Speeds through the ranks, and lets loose destruction's terrible ploughshareCurses begetting rage, and devilish purpose of murder. Soon the voice of joy is heard. On the top of Cserhalom's mountain, Lo! a valiant band, their arms in the high heavens shaking. 'Midst a terrible crowd is Etelke—the feeble young flowret;



MICHAEL VORoSMARTY. 195
Hope, with its sorrow-mix'd fear, and joy, in her spirit are struggling. Hard-hearted warriors surround her, wherever she turns for protection: Bending on trembling knee, she invokes the heavenly Ruler. Say, shall she perish > In vain the question breaks forth from her spirit. Hear her, O Heaven! in her bitterness—hear her: she prays for her country. Heaven ! thou hast heard her prayer—her country shall no man wrest from her.

Kind was the thought—the countenance of evil Shouldst thou not see, for thou wert its condemner; All the gold piles of wealth-encumbered proud ones, Thee should not dazzle.
Doff the thick veil—hide thy bright eye no longer; Crime is too bold—look on in sternest beauty; See, for mankind are dragged to basest doings By their own blindness.
Eyes sharp as thine are watching how thou boldest High o'er thy head the scale; but listen, Goddess I Didst thou not hear a piece of gold that tinkled In thine own balance ?

Didst thou not know thy sword had lost its brightness ? Trembled thy hand—the while a mighty villain Whispered, and threatened thee with wrath and vengeance ? Yes! thy hand trembled.
Didst thou not know that thou hadst been deluded By the vain pomp of words—hadst lost the spirit, Seeking the letter, of thine holiest canon ? Justice! unveil thee.
Off with the veil—behold the heaven is cloudless, And the sun mounts in unaccustomed glory; See, all mankind are seeing—wilt thou only Wear thine old blindness ?

Wealth amasses in countless storehouses, Harvests—and power, its piles upgathering, Holds the keys which long-lin'd ancestry Sends like sceptres from son to son.
Lo! it pours from crystal glasses The juice Tokayan, which earth provided For favorites, in her capricious restlessness. Lo ! they smile while they quaff the cup ;
I, in narrow chamber, quiet My hunger with poor supply; and quenching My thirst with water-drops, ask the Deity None but humble gifts like these :

CEASE thy reproaches, my friend, nor hastily blame me if, weary, Stretch'd on a pillow of down, I have tarried too long in my slumbers; Say not, The sun is awake, and is mounting aloft to meridian ; Long, long before thee he rose; but night is the time for reposing.
Friend ! when the sun hastens down to the ocean at even, what drinks he ?
When he seeks rest and sweet sleep, what drinks he ? He drinks the salt billows;
Had he but drunk of the grape which grew on Szeszgard's* lovely vineyard, He had not roused him so soon, but had slept to this moment, my friend!

There's only one whose mightier strength The strength of time o'erpowers at length, And sits in quiet victory; Time's sickle mows it not; time's flight Brings nor decay, nor death, nor blight,
There's only one—'tis virtuous fame, Through shifting ages still the same, It shines eternally.

IT smarts, it smarts, it smarts with pain; O my poor heart! it smarts for thee; Thou wakenest to my memory, And then it smarts, and smarts again.
Woe, woe, woe, woe!—my doom is woe; Thou fann'st my feelings into fire; And irony that's worse than ire, Its venom o'er my wounds doth throw.
It weeps, it weeps—my heart it weeps Far bitterer tears than when the bird Its mate's imprisoned song has heard, And its lone watch of sorrow keeps.
No! no, no, no! I will not wear A monarch's gems—but rather hold Love's chains of grief than pomps of gold, And lay them on my bosom bare.
None, none, none, none, O none but thee, Where'er I tarry, tread, or turn; For thee alone life's flame shall burn Till trampled by mortality.

'Twere vain annoy ; But, with his fellow-travellers speeds Over the plain, 'midst flowers and weeds, In social joy.
Then yield not, yield not to despair, But bid the bud of sorrow bear A flower of peace; For peace is virtue's favorite twin, And grief is close allied to sin; And changeless ease Is not a child of earth: there's nought But quiet courage, tranquil thought, To smooth our path:
Pain will be there—-'tis yours, 'tis mine, 'Tis all men's. Misery its decline And rising hath.
Thus I subdue my stubborn will, And though my grief were greater still, Would patient bow. Calmer and happier there are many, And yet I would not change with any My being now: For I have learnt 'tis well! and spring A joyous, renovated thing, From grief and gloom. 'Tis well! I'll utter through the day 'Tis well! upon my bed I'll say, Through time to come.

I never asked nor pledged a vow, I never bowed to thy command; I was a child—but now, O now, Too well thy sway I understand. I am thy slave—I wear thy chainsMy heart is subject all to thee; One passion flows thro' all my veins, One sole sweet thought has mastered me.

Happy, who stretches to the goal, And sits beneath love's flowery tree, And gathers from a blooming soul The fruits of blessed sympathy. There is no bliss but this—for bliss Apart from love is all a dream; It dwells upon a maiden's kiss, And consecrates the lover's theme.
Hung on his maiden's arm, distress A garb of peace and pleasure wears ; And want itself is blessedness, When love looks smiling on its cares: So that love's pains their pleasures bring, And all its burthens wax them light, While hope's sweet beamings sun-rays fting, Thro' many a darkened day and nigbt.

I BURN for thee, and thou art cold, yet canst not quench my fire ; Why wilt thou smile on my despair, and not on my desire ? Yet could I break away from thee, I would not wear the chain, Nor dash among the breakers wild, a sailor on the main.
There's no reward for constancy, no honour waits on truth, And love awakens misery, and faithlessness, and ruth: Passion's remorseless scourges give more painful pangs to pain, And danger sits, and discord comes, where fondness has her reign ;
And fear, that doubles all distress, hies thither with its frown, And bondage, taking freedom's name, impels the spirit down. I see thee not—I hear thee not—how dark my path appears ! I know not which o'erhangs it most, my passion or my fears.

Dragg'd, dragg'd by misery on, life's press intolerably great, For, loveless, truthless, who could bear his melancholy fate? For disappointment brings distress, and fearful thoughts impend, And life will linger, linger on, as if it had no end;
Unless my love for thee should break life's melancholy thread! They ask me whence my gloomy dreams, and why I bend my head, And why I sigh and weep, nor know why sorrows cloud my brow. And shall I tell the dreary tale, and shall I say 'tis thou!

BLISS.
Gyaszba borfilft gondolatim szuttjetek.
THOUGHTS that have slept in darkness, vanish now; Ye have too long o'ershadow'd my sad brow; And I am summoned to that golden hour, When bliss, not sorrow, wields its mighty power.
A brighter vision beams upon mine eyes, With dreams of thee and thy sweet courtesies; And kiss-returning kisses—odorous words, And all the smiles and sweets that love affords.
The radiance bursting from thine orbs of day, The dimpled graces near thy lips which play; They have possessed my spirit—waked a fire That burns and brightens, and can ne'er expire.
A fair pearl floating in my vision seemsIs it a dream ?—Then life has nought but dreams. Is she not mine? Am I not hers? Then thought, Sense, suffering, pain, and pleasure—all are nought
Call honey, bitter—I will not mistrust; Call justice, knavery—I will still be just: Say all that glitters is not gold—'tis true; That hearts are morbid—and Til say so too. s2

DESPONDENCY.

LIKE a turtle-dove complaining That no joy is now remaining; What shall hope's sweet dreams renew me, All life's desert, bare and gloomy ?
One sad thought pursues me everLove is fled, returning never; She who was my love'sfirstblossom, Sleeps upon another's bosom.
What is left for love and gladness ? Sorrow, solitude, and sadness: For the dreams of peace departed, Sighs have burst and tears have started.
But the trees and flowers I summon, " Bring me back that lovely woman !'* Then I think that she is sitting In her castle, me .forgetting.
So doth every matin, dawning, Shade my thought with gloomiest awning; Hope deferred, and bliss retreating, Shall I ever hear thy greeting ?

A thousand, and a thousand times, I pledged to thee my vow; If I have in a tittle failed, be my accuser now! Now, while again I swear, through life and time to be Devoted to thyself, devoted all to thee.

Here, hovering round thy lovely form, till death shall smite thee, maid; And dreaming of that better world which death shall ne'er invade. Sweet thought! which time can bring from blest eternity; Sweet thought! eternal joy! to dwell in heaven with thee.
Thou bidst mo leave thee. Yes! Fll leave, when love grows cold, or I Can plant another in my breast; or, tired of thee, I die: Of thee, for whom I all abandon and despise ; Of thee, with whom the rays of pleasure set and rise.
O scorn me not—thy scorn is pour'd on truth, on love—on all That earth adores, that heaven approves; thy marriage festival May see a fairer swain—a prouder train may show, But faithfulness like mine, and fondness, maiden, No!
Yet come what will, and frown what may, I'll worship thee* my fair! All pains, all pangs, all martyrdoms, for thee I'll voiceless bear. There is no death I dread, if from its suffering thou Would rouse thy love's sweet smile and consecrate my vow.

THE HUiMAN HEART.
B&tor a* sziv, eros is.
THE human heart is bold and strong, Yet oft betrayed or guided wrong, With little flattering, soft carresses, Or gilded words that love expresses; With fascinating smiles and kisses, And present dreams and promised blisses.
The human heart is strong and bold, Yet often wounded, oft controll'd; Listening to fancy's strange transportings, And falsehood's wiles, and woman's courtings; A thousand treacherous darts go through it, And then it bleeds, and then—we rue it.j
The human heart is strong and bold, A granite castle's mural hold, Where fetters rattle—ah! those fetters Have chained me, and they chain my belters. Sweet rosel why should thy thorns surround me, Thus to perplex, and thus to wound me ?



264 HUNGARIAN POPULAR SONGS*
The human heart i& strong and bold, But thine, a woman's, proud and cold; Its iciness a fire has lighted, Its pride, my buds of hope has blighted. Strange that such power to thee was given To make, by love, a hell of heaven.
Heart! then be cautious, nor attend To whispering wiles, nor slippery friend; The honied speech hath verjuice in it, And ecstacy's swift-pinion'd minute Brings years of pain: if love betray thee, Nought can its miseries repay thee.

Full of smiles and cheerful-hearted, Spring leaves winter's dreary den ; Night's dark demons, when departed, Bring day's sunny sprites again. In the abyss of grief the deepest, Thou, sweet consolation! sleepest.

THE BRIDE.
Bezzeg vagyon nekem is mar felese'gem.
I GOT me a bride—ah! I got me a bride, And a pretty good portion of trouble beside; I have buried the peace and the joy of my life, Which I shouldn't have done had I buried my wife.
I know hot what fiend with the witch has combined; He dived to his den, but he left her behind: I asked her for wine, and I asked her for bread, And she dung first abuse—then her fist at my head.
When I think of that excellent landlady who Gives me food—gives me drink, and so cheerfully too; And turn to that dragon,* whom tiger-milk nurst, My heart splits in two when I feel how I'm curst.
Only two nights ago—who had dreamt she was nigh? When thinking and meaning no evil, not I ; I was bound to a neighbor's—the hideous one came And vomited vengeance, and fury, and flame.

Kurvanya literally means, mother of harlots.- Kurva is the Slavonic for courtezan; though it is hardly to be supposed the Magyars were universally chaste before they borrowed the unchastity-denoting word from their neighbours. There is an old Hungarian word ringyo, meaniug the lowest of prostitutes. f This is somewhat too free in the original: Ijedtemben beVizeltem a' gatyamban. The gatya is the linen underdress (drawers) worn by the Hungarians in warm weather.

* Lam Souiogy Varinegye'ben a' tauczot meg jarjak Sot hogy ugrost votnijanak, azt is alig varjak. See how, in the province of Somog, they dance that dance; There is no lingering, till the ugros is danced through. The Ugros is the gay and cheerful dance ; the Verbunkos the slow and formal—it is used when recruits are engaged. f This is true of the German waltzes, to which it refers. The Magyar dance is exceedingly varied in its figures. Dr. Rumy tells me, that on one occasion an English traveller noted down the many changes of figure in a Magyar dance, and they amounted to more than a hundred. My friend, who thinks that there is a strong resemblance between the national character of the English and the Magyars, will have it that even in their dances this is the case. The general tone of the Magyar feeling is melancholy and pathetic.

I vow'd—I will not break the vow, Though pledged to one so cold as thou ; I'll keep the sacred oath I swore, Till o'er me death shall close its door; And then, even then, my slumbering clay,* My crumbling bones, from day to day Shall pour forth sighs to thee—to theeTill not a fragment rests of me.

OUT with it! the knave is a miscreant, and more, Who behind your back says what he wont say before; To the yells of foul slander as little I list, As I list to the howl of a dog in the mist. Let his tongue in his mouth-roof to rottenness turn; My God shall assist me bis slanders to spurn.
Let the world go to wreck, if the vine-trees be spared, And their rich ruby drops without culture be reared; Our minds to enlighten, Our spirits to brighten, Hurra ! and hurra ! and hurra ! to the pledge; Dive down to the crystalline deeps from the edge.
I know of a city, and Buda its name; Near Buda flows onwards the Duna of fame ; In Duna's a fish—'tis the Hartsa*—o'er all May the blessing of God's own benignity fall; And joy with the honest and excellent be, While the worthless are given to infamy.

FROM the smiling fields of Rakosh,* on the niarket-<jay of Pest, Lo ! an Over-Tiszian Chikosh in his snowy bunda drest ;f Bunda wearing, bagpipes bearing, And he seeks the " Three Cups' " Tavern, where they sell of wine the best.
There they jok'd the sheep-clad Chikosh—asked him if in Tiszian land People spoke the Magyar language, and could Magyar understand ? Or if Tiszians spoke like Grecians ? So when they had ceased their laughing, thus he answered out of hand:
"Our Hungarians out of pitchers drink the overflowing wine; Spice their food with rich paprika, and from ancient platters dine; Your Hungarians are Barbarians, And the manners of our fathers, scouted by such sons, decline.

" We have not a Tiszian hostess—none! but speaks our Magyar; Here they prattle out their German—pretty patriots they are! But if German they prefer, man, Soon would each wine-drinking Magyar fly from their infected bar.
" Priests and preachers midst our Tiszians speak our Magyar tongue alone; E'en our Rusniakian papas make the Magyar tongue their own; Here, Teutonic, or Ratzonic;* Any, any thing but Magyar—and of Magyar nothing known."

O FORTUNE ! thou capricious thing! Flitting on low or lofty wing; Now scattering round thee honey-dew, Now dark drops of poison too: All thy vanities well I know, Joy is a heap of mountain-snow; Fond words are the forms in the stream that dwell, As sweet and brittle as the honey-cell.
Thy heart I worship—and dwell with thee Wherever thou go, whatever thou be ; For thee to live, and for thee to die, Were a bright and a blessed destiny. But a time may come, when my heart, set free, Shall bring no tribute of love to thee; And the sunshine of joy, long veil'd, may soon Pour in my path the light of noon.
