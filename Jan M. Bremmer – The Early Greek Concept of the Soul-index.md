The
Early Greek
Concept of
the Soul






One
THE SOUL
M O D E R N S E C U L A R I Z A T I O N has made the salvation of the soul a problem of diminishing importance, but the prom inence in Western society of psychiatry and psychology shows that we still care for our psyche, or "soul." Our idea of the soul has both eschatological and psychological attributes, and the borrowing of the Greek word psyche for modem terms implies that the Greeks viewed the soul in the modern way. Yet, when we look at Homer's epics we find that the word psyche has no psychological connotations whatsoever. And in Homer the psyche may fly away during a swoon or leave the body through a wound, behavior now not asso ciated with the soul. Do these differences then suggest that the early Greeks viewed the soul and human psychological make-up differently? Indeed, the Greeks of Homer did not yet have "cognisance of any concept denoting the psychic whole, of any notion that might correspond to our word 'soul,' " as Bruno Snell has demonstrated in his epoch-making book The Discovery of the Mind.1 Moreover, the Greeks were not the only people 1 who had a concept of the soul unlike our own. The Anglo- i Saxon concept of sawol, the linguistic ancestor of the mod

THE SOUL
ern English word "soul," lacked any psychological content,2 and the evidence we will consider below shows that this absence is common in the soul beliefs of most "primitive'' peoples. Thus an analysis of the early Greek concept of the soul may not only contribute to a better understanding of the development of the Greek, and, consequently, the mod ern Western mind, but can also clarify the so-called prim itive notion of the soul. Such an analysis may look deceptively simple at first. After all, what needs to be done? We collect words normally translated as "soul" or those associated with it, and so are led, presumably, to the Greek concept. The Greek material has been approached repeatedly i n this manner. However, scholars have failed to ask some important preliminary ques tions. First, should the term "soul" be used at all? It is now generally recognized that the use of modern Western ter minology to describe non-Western beliefs influences anal ysis since it assumes the existence among other peoples of the same semantic fields for modern words, and thus often implies a nonexistent similarity.3 I n order to escape this danger a recent monograph introduced new terms to de scribe as exactly as possible the Oceanic concepts of the soul,'1 Although the use of modern Western terms can be

Drijvers (eds.), Religion, Culture and Methodology (The Hague and Paris 1973) 99-108. The prob lems arising from the use of such general terms as "soul" have been lucidly analyzed by the Dutch anthropologist Anton Blok, Wittgenstein en Elias (Amsterdam 1976), 4 Fischer, Studien über Seelenvorstellungen. In his terminology Fischer was followed by L. Leertouwer, Het beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse volken (Diss. Univ. of Groningen 1977). Leertouwer's results, as do F i scher's, correspond with those reached by Arbman and his pupils.

THE SOUL
misleading there are dangers inherent in the use of com pletely new terms. I f every scholar introduces new terms to cover his specific area, from the Bongo-Bongo to ancient Greece, we will end up with a scientific Babel where com munication is well-nigh impossible. For that reason I shall not introduce new terms for Greece but shall use the ex isting anthropological terminology. In so doing we shall, however, always have to be careful that we do not import into the Greek material shades of meaning that are typical of our own terms but not characteristic of the Greeks. There is yet another problem to be faced. Scholars of the various soul beliefs have made extensive use of the insights of modern psychology in attempts to identify the experi ences that moulded primeval man's ideas about himself. However, experiences are not events that take place in a historical vacuum. We recall and interpret our experience with the help of stereotypes of the particular society in which we live.5 Our own experience therefore may well be vastiy different from those of primeval man. Although it is difficult to reconstruct those primeval experiences, we can some times trace developments of concepts by studying the ety mology of the words concerned—for example, of psyche. In that case, however, we must beware of introducing into our texts the etymologies we have discovered. The fact that psyche once had a connection with breath does not nec essarily mean that it has this meaning in Homer. Our point of departure must always be the assumption that the mean ing of a word can only be derived from its use in the lan guage. Classicists seem to be in a more favorable position than many students of social anthropology. Between them and their sources there is not an informant who has his own

interests and opinions or who is too young to be fully ac quainted with his people's tradition. Nor do classicists have to rely upon the data of only one or two reports, as do schol ars of soul belief in North America and North Eurasia. Clas sical students can study their subject direcdy from the texts and monuments and thereby establish meaning from a word's context or through its comparison with similar represen tations or texts. Yet classicists also have particular difficulties stemming from the nature of the sources. The archaeological remains and reports are not always as informative as we might wish. The ancient authors have their particular bias and do not give systematic accounts of their soul belief. We often have to glean our information from records where information on the soul appears only incidentally. Sometimes a concept or rite in the period under investigation can only be compared with one i n a later document. Such later examples cannot bring absolute confirmation of an interpretation, although they can enhance its probability. In some cases we have to compare a subject with rites or concepts from other cul tures. Again, such a comparison cannot constitute absolute proof, but it may establish a certain degree of probability, depending on the number and nature of the parallels.
Modern research on the early Greek idea of the soul started in 1894 when Nietzsche's friend Erwin Rohde published his Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks, a supreme scholarly achievement, writ ten with such skill that it soon became a classic.6 Rohde

THE SOUL
possessed a profound knowledge of the ancient Greek world and he developed his views in dialogue with contemporary anthropological and folkloric studies. He was much im pressed with the ruling animistic theory that primitive man had conceived of the notion of the soul as a double of man when he observed that in dreams he could wander away.7 Rohde tried to harmonize this view with the Homeric text but, as he could not find any instance of the soul as double in Homer, he resorted to a fragment of Pindar:
In happy fate all die a death That frees from care, And yet there still will linger behind A living image of life, For this alone has come from the gods. It sleeps while the members are active; But to those who sleep themselves It reveals in myriad visions The fateful approach Of adversities or delights.8
This fragment indeed illustrates the theory that in dreams the soul acts as a double, but Rohde did not bother to explain why this activity does not occur in Homer; neither did he find it necessary to continue his analysis of the words used for "soul." Like the great majority of his contemporaries, he was exclusively interested in the destination of the soul, and had no eye for the rich and varied Homeric psychological terminology. His interpretation was enthusiastically re ceived by some and silently rejected by others, particularly

These discussions did not make much funda mental progress toward an eschatology of the soul, but they rightly stressed the difference between the soul of the living and the dead, and took into account the etymology of the various words studied.10 They did, moreover, advance our knowledge of the Homeric psychology of the soul, an ad vance culminating in SnelTs demonstration that the early Greeks did not yet have a unitary concept of the body and m i n d . 1 1 SnelTs analysis has been corrected, supplemented, and refined, but not superseded, by later scholars.12 We still lack, however, a systematic approach that assembles all the

THE SOUL
elements and accounts for all the factors determining the nouns for the different parts of what we usually associate with the soul. Such an integral approach was first undertaken by the Swedish Sanskritist Ernst Arbman in an analysis of Vedic soul belief in India. He found that the concept of the soul , (atman, purusa) was preceded by a duality where the es- 1 chatological and psychological attributes of the soul had not yet merged. For Christian Scandinavia and classical Greece he arrived at the same conclusion. After these high cultures he proceeded to investigate "primitive'' ones, where he found the same duality, although its presence had often been ob scured by the concept of the soul held by the field inves tigators themselves.13 In his analysis Arbman distinguished between body souls [ endowing the body with life and consciousness and the free soul, an unencumbered soul representing the individual personality. The free soul is active during unconsciousness, and passive during consciousness when the conscious in dividual replaces it. It is not exactly clear where the passive free soul resides i n the body. The body souls are active during the waking life of the living individual. I n contrast to the free soul the body soul is often divided into several parts. Usually it falls into two categories: one is the life soul, frequently identified with the breath, the life principle; the other is the ego soul. The body soul, or several of its parts, represents the inner self of the individual. In the early stage of the development of Vedic soul belief the free soul and the body souls did not yet constitute a unity; later the con cept of the Vedic free soul, atman, incorporated the psy

chological attributes of the body souls, a development that occurred among a number of peoples. Arbman's views have been elaborated by his pupils i n two major monographs on the soul beliefs of North America and North Eurasia, confirmed by the studies of other scholars, and widely accepted by anthropologists.14 It seems reason able to apply his method to the problem of Greek soul belief in order to establish its value for the study of archaic Greek soul belief. This comparative analysis will begin with the epic tradition, the earliest and richest source, that greatly influenced later ideas, and will then consider material from the period after the epic until about 400 B.C. when aspects of Greek soul belief occur that are not found in Homer. In this way we can hope to see as complete a picture as possible of Greek soul belief before the soul became the subject of systematic reflection by Plato and other philosophers. Arbman concentrated especially on the soul of the hving, but his pupils also paid attention (albeit to a much lesser degree) to the soul of the dead, of animals, and plants! These aspects of the Greek concept of the soul will be compared to the discoveries of Arbman's pupils to enrich our understanding of them. This analysis necessarily has a certain ideal character. The evidence comes from different places, and we simply do not know whether all the aspects of the Greek soul belief

or of a rite can be found throughout the period under in vestigation and throughout Greece. There may well be local variants and developments that escape us because of the fragmentary nature of our sources. In addition since the records come mainly from the upper classes of Greek so ciety, the ideas expressed there may not have been shared by the lower classes. The sources do not allow us to differ entiate in this respect. We discuss the material arranged as far as possible ac cording to the categories denned by Arbman and his pupils, and then we compare the results with the concepts of Arb man described i n detail at that point. I n general the material will not be analyzed exhaustively but only so far as it is of interest for a better understanding of the Greek soul belief; the texts cited are offered by way of example. The analysis may seem somewhat dogmatic since in each case only a few examples are given as illustration, but for each term discussed an extensive bibliography is given to allow the reader to pursue the material at length. This study then applies the model of "primitive11 soul be lief with its distinction between a free soul representing the individuality of a person and the body souls endowing a person with life and consciousness. Following this model -psyche will be identified in the next chapter as correspond ing with the free soul and terms connected with man's inner life such as thymos, noos, and menos, as corresponding with the body souls. Although the concept of psyche developed into the modern unitary soul, its "primitive" character can be discerned i n the so-called shamanistic traditions and the early descriptions of dreams. An investigation of terminol ogy i n the last chapter will show that for the Greeks, as for many other peoples, the free soul of the living continued as the soul of the dead, although other manifestations of the deceased were also thought to exist. There was no uniform

representation of the dead in an afterlife, neither did all the dead have the same status. An appendix will take up the question of the possible existence of a soul in plants and animals, and i n a second appendix the wandering soul in Western European folktales will be discussed. Finally, since the sources are fragmentary and hard to interpret; it may well be that others will be inclined to draw different conclusions from the material studied here. But 1 hope that in any case this archaeology of Greek anthropology will make a fresh start in the analysis of the early Greek concept of the soul.

T H E SOUL OF T H E

I N C H A P T E R O N E we saw that Arbman distinguishes be tween a free soul representing the individual personality and the body souls endowing the body with life and con sciousness. I n this chapter we apply this distinction to the soul of the living in Homer and the Archaic Age. Homer distinguishes between a free soul, corresponding with psy che, and body souls, corresponding with thymos, noos, and menos. One element of Arbman's definition of the free soul, the activity of the soul in trance, we find only in the Archaic Age; yet it was an integral part of Greek dualistic soul belief and, contrary to Dodds' view (discussed below), was not derived from the shamanistic practices of the Siberians. Of Arbman's description of the body souls Homer knows only the ego soul but his representation of the inner self of the individual is much richer than Arbman's definition of the ego soul suggests. Moreover, besides the more abstract ego souls Homer presents organs, such as the lungs and the heart, that also have psychological attributes. The presence of Arbman's distinction in Homer suggests that the dualistic soul belief existed also before the time of Homer. In both these periods the free soul, while repre sentative of the individual, possessed no psychological at

tributes. Though linked to the living, its major significance was still eschatological. In addition the etymology of psyche, the free soul in Homer, links it to Arbman's life soul and suggests that during the Homeric period the free soul was developing into Arbman's unitary soul. This development was still going on and had not yet reached the state in which psyche incorporated the psychological attributes of the ego soul. That development would reach its completion only at the end of the fifth century. After this general outline of the nature of the soul of the living we start our detailed dis cussion of the free soul and the body souls with psyche.1
The Free Soul
As noted above, the psyche in Homer can be identified with the free soul. It is only mentioned in Homer as part of the living person at times of crisis. The passages reveal that without psyche a person cannot survive. When the embassy of the Greek army beseeches Achilles to suppress his anger
1 On psyche, see the literature quoted in Chapter One; O. Regenbogen, Kleine Schriften (Munich 1961) 1-26; Ε. L. Harrison, "Notes on Homeric Psychology," Phoenix 14 (1960) 63-80. esp. 75-77; J. Warden, "Ψυχή in Homeric Death Descriptions," Phoenix 25 (1971) 95-103; H. G. Ingenkamp, "Inneres Selbst und Lebensträger," Rheinisches Museum 118 (1975) 48-61; S. M. Darcus, "A Person's Relation to ψυχή in Homer, Hesiod, and the Greek Lyric Poets," Glotta 57 (1979) 30-39; Β. C. Claus, Toward the Soul (New Haven and London 1981). The extended discussion of psyche by A. Schnaufer, Frühgriechischer Totenglaube (Hildesheim and New York 1970) has been shown to be rather unconvincing, see C. Sourvinou-Inwood, Journal of Hellenic Studies 92 (1972) 220-222. We may add that also Schnaufer's use of the concepts of survival and lebender Leichnamm is highly uncritical. For these concepts, see Μ. Τ Hodgen, The Doctrine of Survivals (London 1936); G. Widengren, "Evolutionistische Theorien auf dem Gebiet der vergleichenden Religionswissenschaft," in G. Lanczkowski (ed.), Selbstverständriis und Wesen der Religionswissenschaft (Darmstadt 1974) 87-113; G Wiegelmann, "Der 'lebende Leichnamm' im Volksbrauch," Zeitschrift für Volkskunde 62 (1966) 161-183.

and resume fighting, he complains that he is continually risking his psyche (ix.322). Agenor, summoning up his courage to face Achilles who is routing the Trojans, reflects that his opponent has only one psyche (xxi.569); when Achilles pursues Hector around Troy, the poet comments that the prize will be Hector's psyche (xxn.161). The psyche leaves the body during swoons. These swoons are all described in a more or less similar way and have recently been analyzed in great detail;2 one example may therefore suffice. When his friend Pelagon had pulled a spear from Sarpedon's thigh, "his psyche left him and a mist came down upon his eyes" (v.696).3 Although it is not stated specifically, we assume that the psyche returned, since Sarpedon recovered immediately. I n none of these instances of swooning, however, is the return of the psyche men tioned. This omission has been commented upon more than once and will be discussed below.4 When a person dies, the psyche leaves forever and departs to Hades. For example, when Hector had spoken his last words to Achilles, death overtook him and "his psyche fled from his limbs and went to Hades" (xxn.362). In these cases psyche is sometimes closely connected with the aiôn, the force vitale, or the source of vitality.5 But unlike psyche, in

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
Homer we do not find the aiön connected with the elderly; it is only the young who possess it i n its full power.6 When Hera discusses the fate of Sarpedon with Zeus, she de scribes his death as the time "when psyche and aiön have left him" (xvi.453). Odysseus, i n his farewell speech to Po lyphemus utters the wish that he could send him to Hades "robbed of his psyche and aiön' (9.523f.). In Homer the psyche does not have any physical or psychological con nections. It is not the "life-stuff" or "breath of life," descrip tions which i n any case are ill-defined by those who use them.7 We can say only that when the psyche has left the body forever, it dies. It has been argued that i n Homer the psyche was located in the head, since the terms psyche and head are sometimes used interchangeably. Nestor describes pirates as people "risking their souls" (3.74), while Mentor describes the suit ors of Penelope as "risking their heads" (2.237). In the pro logue of the Iliad the poet speaks of Achilles' wrath sending many psychai to Hades (i.3).8 The expression is used again later, but then the poet uses heads instead of souls (xi.55).

mourning (xxiv,712, 724), the primal offering (in.273), and the importance of sneezing.9 Yet it is obvious that the fact the head and -psyche are sometimes used interchangeably does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the psyche was located in the head. It can also mean that they represent the same thing, that is, the whole person. The only valid conclusion to be drawn from the association is that the Greeks considered the head as very important, which, in itself, is not very surprising. What we know for certain about the psyche's location is merely that it flew away from the limbs (xvi.856; xxn.362),10 or left the body through the mouth (ix.409), the chest (xvi.505), or through a wound in the flank ( x i v . 5 1 8 ) . n That is all Homer says of a positive nature about the psyche. How does this all compare with the free soul? As outlined by Arbman and his pupils the free soul is the individual's nonphysical mode of existence not only after death but also in dreams, swoons, and other types of unconsciousness. It

is the free soul i n these conditions that represents a person's individuality. This is shown by the many tales in which people relate, as their personal experience, the adventures of their dream soul, whether in the shape of an insect, animal, or homunculus (Appendix Two). The free soul, therefore, is always active outside the body; it is not bound to it like the body souls. But precisely because the free soul functions outside the body its place inside the body is rather obscure, for when its owner is awake the body represents the individual and only its activities are of interest. The free soul i n this state is only passively present and is not usually mentioned. Its exact place in the body is, for that reason, a matter of minor importance, though the location is often a source of speculation. In North Eurasia, for example, the free soul can be located throughout the body, or in the heart, the lungs, or the kidneys,12 The free soul never has any physical or psychological attributes; it only represents the individual. In addition it is impossible for the free soul to continue its worldly existence when the body is dead even though it is always active outside the body. The soul cannot stay behind i n a dead body but has to pursue an afterlife. In the same way the body is dependent upon the free soul. When the free soul disappears, the body dies after falling ill or gradually pines away.13 When we compare this description of the free soul with the Homeric psyche, one feature is conspicuously absent. In Homer the psyche does not represent a person's individ uality i n dreams or in forms of unconsciousness. Yet from

this absence we should not conclude that such a role for the psyche did not exist i n Homer's time. Such a conclusion, drawn by Walter F. Otto, Rohde's fiercest critic, completely misconstrues the evidence. In Homer we find only a very special kind of dream and dream description. The dreams in Homer are "literary dreams" used to further the story and, as such, cannot be taken as informing about the whole real dream-experience of the early Greeks.14 Homer's dreamdescriptions always follow a strict pattern that may be di vided into four stages:
1. Circumstance before the dream; 2. The dream image moving toward the sleeper and stand ing above the sleeper's head;15 3. The speech of the dream image; 4. The aftermath of the dream.16
This strict patterning was also the rule i n the ancient Near East although there we find different introductory and con cluding stages also followed by Herodotus.17 Dreams in Ho

mer are neither fantastic nor incoherent because, presum ably, this would make them very hard to use for literary purposes. Homer only reports those dreams with a message. The "message" dream as a "theological" event and as a literary topos "goes back to an age-old dream pattern, that of the incubation dream. Actual incubation dreams are quite rare in the texts of the ancient Near East, but the 'message' dream is most easily explained as a literary creation based upon transformed actual dream experiences of persons passing the night, after due ritual preparation, in the cella of the god's sanctuary i n order to receive his command or advice. Only divine messages obtained under such circum stances are considered theologically—or politically, which ever the context demands—valid and genuine."18 It is ob vious that the "message" dream must have been especially popular with state leaders as a means of sanctioning political decisions since it would not require the help of an inter preter to understand them, which might be the case with dreams of travelling and seeing strange people.19 Thus we conclude that, although we do not find in Homer the activ ities of a dream soul, its absence does not necessarily pre suppose its nonexistence. We simply do not know.20 It should

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
also be noted that modern legends relating the adventures of the soul are not to be found in fine literature, like the Iliad, but mainly in folktales (Appendix Two). A comparison of Arbman's description of the free soul with what we know about the Homeric psyche reveals the following similarities:
1. Both are located in an unspecified part of the body; 2. Both are inactive (and unmentioned) when the body is active; 3. Both leave the body during a swoon; 4. Both have no physical or psychological connections; 5. Both are a precondition for the continuation of life; 6. Both represent the individual after death.
Taken separately these similarities do not prove anything. As a whole, however, they provide for the existence of a free soul in Homeric Greece. Moreover, given the fact that the concept of the free soul seems to have existed at one time nearly everywhere for which we have evidence it is not unreasonable to infer that the Homeric psyche corresponds with the free soul. Not only can psyche in Homer be identified with the cus tomary functions of Arbman's free soul, but an examination of its etymology reveals that it expresses a stage in the development of the unitary soul. It is generally agreed that psyche is etymologically connected with psycheln, "to blow or to breathe."21 This meaning is suggested i n Homer when

the psyche leaves the body at the beginning of a swoon and then breathing begins again at the end.22 Especially inter esting in this connection is the description of Andromache's swoon where it is said that she "breathed forth" (ekapusse) her psyche (xxn.467), a word most likely connected with smoke.23 Yet the absence of psyche at the end of the swoon recalls the concept of the free soul as defined by Arbman and his pupils. The movement of the person who had fainted proves that the soul has returned, and when the person is awake the free soul is of no further interest. The Homeric poems are the culmination of a tradition of oral composition joining elements of different periods.24 Their coexistence implies that we must be prepared to find dif ferent stages in the evolution of words and concepts without always being able to distinguish with certainty between older and younger elements. The etymology of psyche and the fact that the meaning "breath" is most prominent in the rather formulaic swoon descriptions imply that those cases in Homer where psyche has lost or is losing its purely phys ical meaning are later developments. The original meaning of "breath" may weU be an impor tant clue to the better understanding of psyche's develop ment. As pointed out i n Chapter One, Arbman also identified a life soul, usually associated with the breath, i n which case he calls it a breath soul. According to Arbman the life soul

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
often acquires new qualities and frequendy develops into a unitary, that is, a modern type of soul. The Swedish an thropologist Hultkrantz, one of Arbman's most gifted pupils, has analyzed this process from a psychological viewpoint:
The breath-soul is the soul of great possibilities. It is at one and the same time material and immaterial, bound by matter and yet free. When Wundt combined the breath-soul with the idea of the free-soul, he did so on good grounds: both are unsubstantial and unstable. From the psychological viewpoint the conception of the free-soul is of course identical with the memory-image of the dead person projected to the supernatural reality; and the airy, etherial shape of the deceased is like a condensation of human breath. The surviving soul and the breath-soul thus have qualifications fa vouring a meeting and merging. But the fusion takes place only when the situation is suitable for this—when speculation has started or the dualisuc front has been weakened. . . . it appears probable that the life-soul, in its character a breath-soul, has emancipated itself from its immediate physical functions and in consequence of its airy consistency been assimilated with and finally absorbed the conception of the free-soul.25
Such a process in which the original free soul becomes absorbed by the breath soul that, in turn, develops into a unitary soul, can be traced i n the development of the Atha pascan nezacl, Indian dtman, Estonian king, Finnish henki, Russian dusa, and Wogulian lilt26 A similar development is also likely for Latin anima, "breath," or free soul.

represents personal identity for, as a Hungarian anthropol ogist observed: "Not a single example did we find in the beliefs of more than 200 peoples to indicate that the breath left the body during sleep and that its adventures appeared as dreams, nor is it believed anywhere that the breath re sembles human beings."27 It is hard to see why the Greeks should form an exception. All factors suggest, with due qualification, that the de velopment from the life soul to the unitary soul, as sketched by Hultkrantz, also took place in early Greece. Before Homer the Greeks i n all probability had a word for the free soul that was gradually replaced by the life soul, identified with the psyche or "breath," and that at the same time started to lose its purely physical function.28 I n Homer we meet this process at a halfway stage. Psyche has already absorbed the role of the free soul as the soul of the dead, but it has not lost all of its connections with its original function as breath. It was to be some centuries before psyche developed completely into a unitary soul.29
Can we find the free soul in post-Homeric times too? Archaic Age legends of persons whose souls were reputed to wander away during a trance indeed reflect the contin uation of the belief in the free soul found in Homer. E. R. Dodds, on the contrary, thought that these legends revealed

a new and revolutionary conception of the relation between body and soul appearing at the end of the Archaic Age. According to him, this new development was due to trade and colonization that had brought the Greeks i n contact with the shamanistic culture of the Black Sea Scythians i n the seventh century; he had been inspired by a celebrated article on Scythian shamanism by the Swiss Karl Meuli, who, for a classical scholar, possessed an unusual knowl edge of North Eurasian beliefs and customs.30 Dodds' and Meuli's views have been highly influential and not only the wandering soul but also other elements of these legends have been derived from Central or North Asia. I n our anal ysis we shall inquire whether the wandering of the soul indeed has to be ascribed to a shamanistic influence or whether these legends are testimonies of authentic Greek soul belief. Evidence of a soul wandering away in a trance is found in legends about two men, Aristeas of Proconnesus, an is land in the Propontis later called Marmara, and Hermotimos of Clazomenae, a town on the west coast of Asia Minor. Herodotus (4.14) tells the following local legend of Aristeas:
They say that Aristeas, a member of one of the noblest families of the city, entered a fuller's shop in Proconnesus and dropped dead. The fuller closed his shop and left to inform the relatives of the dead man. When the story had already spread about the town that Aristeas was dead, an inhabitant of Cyzicus, who came from Artace, arrived and started to dispute with those who said this, as serting that he had met Aristeas, who was on his way to Cyzicus, and had spoken with him. So this man strenuously contradicted the rumor; but the relatives had arrived at the shop with the things

due for the funeral, intending to carry away the body. When the shop was opened, however, Aristeas did not appear to be there, neither dead nor alive. After six years he appeared in Proconnesus and composed that poem which the Greeks call Arimasvea, after which composition he disappeared for the second time. This is what those cities relate.
In his poem Aristeas told how he, possessed by Apollo, trav elled to the far north to the country of the Issedones and learned from them about the Hyperboreans living near the sea (Herodotus 4.14) and the one-eyed Arimaspi who stole gold from griffins (Herodotus 3.116). That was, however, not yet the end of Aristeas for Herodotus (4.15) goes on:
What follows I know to have happened to the people of Metapontum in Italy two hundred and forty years after the second disap pearance of Aristeas, as 1 found by calculations made in Metapontum and Proconnesus. The Metapontines say that Aristeas appeared in person in their country and ordered them to erect an altar to Apollo and near to it a statue bearing the name of Aristeas the Proconnesian. Apollo, he told them, had come to them alone of the Italiotes; and he accompanied the god at the time, being now in the shape of Aristeas, but then, when he accompanied the god, in the shape of a raven. After these words he vanished, but the Metapontines say that they sent to Delphi to ask the god what the apparition signified. The Pythia ordered them to obey the ap parition: it would be better for them if they obeyed. They accepted this and did as they were told, so there is now a statue bearing the name of Aristeas, close by the image of Apollo, and laurel bushes are standing around it.
The raven is also mentioned by Pliny {Natural History 7.174) who in telling how the soul of Aristeas was seen flying from his mouth i n the shape of a raven seems to combine the Metapontine and the earlier legend. Apollonius gives us a second description of a soul wan dering away during a trance in the tale of Hermotimos (Mirabilia 3):
26



T H E SOUL OF T H E LIVING
They say that the soul of Hermotirnos of Clazomenae, wandering apart from the body, was absent for many years, and in different places foretold events such as great floods and droughts and also earthquakes and plagues and the like, while his stiff body was lying inert, and that the soul, after certain periods re-entering the body as into a sheath, aroused it. As he did this often, and although his wife had orders from him that, whenever he was going to be in trance (lit. to depart) nobody should touch his 'corpse,1 neither one of the citizens nor anybody else, some people went into his house and, having moved his weak wife by entreaty, they gazed at Hermotirnos lying on the ground, naked and motionless. They took fire and burned him, thinking that the soul, when it should arrive and have no place anymore to enter, would be completely deprived of being alive—which indeed happened. The inhabitants of Clazomenae honor Hermotirnos till the present day and a sanc tuary for him has been founded into which no woman enters for the reason above given.
Many details of this account have disappeared in Pliny's Natural History (7.174), so that we can discern the reduc tionist tendency discussed below, even though it contains the "superfluous" detail of the enemies' name: "We find that the soul of Hermotirnos of Clazomenae used to leave his body and roam abroad, and in its wanderings report to him from a distance many things that only one present at them could know of—his body in the meantime being halfconscious, until finally some enemies named the Cantharidae burned his body and so deprived his soul upon its return of what may be called its sheath." Pliny's version of Hermotirnos' wandering soul is already much less informative than Apollonius' report. Differences like these induced C. W. von Sydow, a Swedish folklorist with a great interest in the formal aspects of popular tra ditions, to introduce the terms "memorate" and 'Tabulate," terms that have been generally accepted by German and Scandinavian scholars but neglected by the Anglo-Saxon

world.31 Von Sydow defined a memorate as the story of people about their own, strictly personal, experiences. This definition, although in principle very useful, has proved to be somewhat too narrow.32 The memorate can best be de fined as the report of a supranormal experience either of the narrator himself or of one of his acquaintances. Legends that do not relate strictly personal experiences Von Sydow called 'Tabulates"; these need not have a basis in the folk belief of the region from which the tale comes. Memorates can relate highly individual experiences in which traditional concepts play only a minor role, but they are more often dominated by such concepts that then give the stories a stereotyped character: the ghosts people meet are always dressed i n white!33 Over time and distance memorates can become transformed and standardized. Details unnecessary for the story but typical of the narrator are dropped and other motifs are added. The exact time and place, the sit uation and frequency of an experience, the interpretation of the narrator himself, or the reaction of his audience are often ignored. The social context of the happening remains vague. In this way the memorates become migratory leg ends of only minor importance as testimonies for the beliefs of a certain region.34

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
The legends of Aristeas and Hermotimos are still re markably detailed and they can therefore be accepted as memorates from the Archaic Age; the reports are testimo nies of the soul belief of that period whether they are con sidered to be originally Greek or derived from a shamanistic culture. Aristeas' legend reveals one aspect of the free soul not found in Homer, the wandering of the soul in a trance. This becomes clear when we subject his legend to a detailed analysis; we start with the trance.35 It seems reasonable to assume that Aristeas1 supposed death was a deep trance, since he disappeared afterwards and returned after many years. This identification of death and trance occurs in very different cultures; an interesting example is given by the English traveller Richard Johnson in a description of a Samoyed shamanistic seance in 1556. After the shaman had started to play the drum and put on his garment, "hee singeth as wee use heere in Englande to hallow, whope, or showte at houndes, and the rest of the company answere him with this Owtis, Igha, Igha, Igha, and the Priest replieth againe with his voyces. And they answere him with the selfsame wordes so manie times that in the ende he becommeth as it were madde, and falling downe as hee were dead, having nothing on him but a shirt, lying upon his backe I might perceive him to breathe/'36 I n an account of the activities of a Lapp shaman, it is observed

that he "worked for a while with the gabdes (Lapp drum) and with one finger foDowed the signs to be found on it. Suddenly he stretched himself out on his back and lay as if dead for a quarter of an hour. They could not even see that he was breathing."37 Among North American Indians we find the same practice. The ecstatic is said to be "like dead" or even "to be dead."38 The identification also takes place in a nonshamanistic context. When the Irish abbot Furseus (ca. 650) once awoke from an ecstasy, he saw around him his relatives and neighbors, all assembled to lament his death.39 And the Italian monk Filippo Neri (1515-1595) was awakened by the extreme unction that his colleague, Father Bordini, administered to h i m . 4 0 During the great Ghost Dance movement in America at the turn of this century a woman lapsed into a deep trance lasting for such a long time that people thought she was dead.41 She awoke only when she had been laid to rest on a platform according to the tradi tional rites.42 Aristeas did not reach his ecstasy by a definite technique,

like Herrnotimos (below); instead he evidently was unable to control himself, since he very suddenly fell into a trance in the fuller's shop. This lack of control is not uncommon among ecstatics and also occurred among Christian saints. Filippo Neri fell into trance when he gave absolution, and Caterina Ricci (1522-1554) had to be given special rules by her monastery because her sudden ecstasies created too much disruption of normal life.43 Having looked at the trance of Aristeas, we shall now discuss the wandering of his soul that caused his miraculous appearance on the road to Cyzicus. The appearance belongs to a familiar type of folktale in which a person who is fast asleep, lies i n trance or is dying, is at the same time seen in a different place.44 For example, a Tirolean folktale re counts how "at Mieders in Stubai a farmer once was at the point of dying. A day-labourer saw the same man raking leaves outside the village and thought: look at that, the fellow is healthy again! Just when the day-labourer came into the village, the death-bell toDed and he asked who had died. How surprised he was at the news that it was the farmer he had just seen outside raking leaves."45 The theme is applied more subtly in a Swedish folktale set i n the mid-eighteenth century:
When a Swedish court could not start because the magistrate had not arrived, a naite (a Lappshaman) was asked to find out what delayed him. He went into trance and, when woken up, told "that the magistrate had taken the wrong way and got stuck in a drift. But now he was on the right road again and would arrive in three

hours." And sure enough, in three hours he did arrive; and he then related that he had taken quite the wrong road and the sledge had finally tipped over and got stuck, so that he had had a great deal of trouble getting it loose again. "And we should have been there still if an old Same (Lapp) had not chanced to come and help us. He was, by the way, an uncommonly strong fellow, that Same" said the magistrate. But just then he caught sight of the naite and said "Are you here now? But it was you who helped us?" "It was" said the naite.'16
An example of bilocation during sleep appears i n St. Au gustine who records the following event without giving it a date nor ascribing it to any known philosopher:
Another man also said that in his own home, at night before he went to bed, he saw a certain philosopher whom he knew very well, coming to him, and this philosopher expounded to him some Platonic theories that he had refused to explain when he was earlier asked to do so. And when the same philosopher was asked afterwards why he did in another's house what he had refused to do for him when the request was made in his own house, he said: " I did not do it, but I dreamed that I did."47
So whereas the philosopher thought that he expounded the Platonic theories only in his dream, the other man saw him in person. The occasions of bilocation—sleep, trance, and deathare those when the free soul leaves the body, and it seems very likely that the key to this type of story is to be found in the concept of the free soul. Because the free soul, that is, i n primitive experience the whole person, was believed to leave the body and to experience adventures, it is un derstandable that, at the same time, it was believed to be visible during these journeys outside the body. The story

about Aristeas points therefore i n the direction of the ex istence of the concept of the free soul i n Archaic Greece. Bilocation reportedly took place i n antiquity and also i n more modern times but i n a number of cases the exact circumstances remain obscure. Of Pythagoras it was told only that he was seen i n Croton and Metapontum at the same hour on the same day, a feat later imitated by Apollonius of Tyana who was seen in Smyrna and Ephesos on the same day.48 St. Francis was seen i n Aries blessing the brethren when he was sitting at the same time on the moun tain La Verna; Filippo Neri himself told how he was present at the death of his friend Cordelia even though he did not leave his own room.49 Rohde saw i n the death and disappearance of Aristeas a

combination of two versions of the legend.50 I n one, Aristeas dies, that is, goes into trance; in the other he is carried away with body and soul without dying, like Euthymos and Kleomedes (see Chapter Three, The Abnormal Dead). This last (hypothetical) version, however, is an unlikely source since, unlike Aristeas, Euthymos and Kleomedes do not return. Meuli thought that the legends about Aristeas lying in a trance were original and that the versions of him ex periencing his adventures i n the body were later rationali zations of the Greeks of Cyzicus and Proconnesus.51 This interpretation seems more likely but misjudges the func tioning of the free soul, for persons i n a trance or swoon typically tell "on their return to 'life' of their experiences i n the state of lethargy in the first person."52 This identification is understandable since, as discussed above, the free soul represents the complete identity of a person. Aristeas, too, told of his adventures in the first person, just as the Siberian shamans when recounting their adventures in a trance.53 The two versions then will have been coexistent from the very beginning. Those who knew Aristeas personally will have known that he experienced his adventures only in a trance; others who knew only his poem must have con cluded that he in person had experienced his adventures.54 Dodds' shamanistic interpretation of the Aristeas legends induced scholars also to derive other elements of his legend from areas to the north of Greece. I f these elements indeed

derive from Central Asia or Siberia—areas with a strong shamanistic influence—they may be taken as at least en dorsing the probability of Dodds' interpretation. But do they? Pliny told that the soul of Aristeas flew from his mouth in the shape of a raven. According to Meuli the raven-shaped soul recalled the practice of Siberian shamans.55 Actually, Meuli could not find a direct parallel but confined himself to pointing out that in old Siberian myths the prototype of the shamans was called "Big Raven." This is not a partic ularly striking parallel; more important is the fact that Big Raven is a typical trickster appearing in the mythology of the northeastern Palaeo-Asiatic peoples, especially those liv ing on the Kamschatka Peninsula and near the Bering Strait,56 an area fairly unlikely to have influenced Greece strongly. The soul in the shape of the raven in Pliny's report clearly finds its origin in the Metapontine legend related above and, ultimately, in the close connection of Apollo with the ra ven.57 The departure of the raven-shaped soul does some times occur elsewhere, but in all of these instances (which often have a Christian coloring) the return of the soul is

never reported—a fact that does not seem to have been noted and one which I am unable to explain.38 Andreas Alföldi links Aristeas with Central Asia. He sug gests that Herodotus' gold-guarding griffins were in fact transformations of the guards of the "Golden Mountain of the Golden Heavenly Father."59 This explanation presup poses a radical change in Aristeas' time of a tradition that, supposedly, was still found in its original form in the latter half of the last century by a German Orientalist.60 It seems somewhat less strained—and consequently more convinc ing—to view Herodotus' version as a doublet replacing ants with griffins of another story of Herodotus that he learned from the Persians. I n the Bactrian desert animals in the shape of ants, smaller than dogs but bigger than foxes, dig up sand containing gold when they make their burrows, gold that the Indians then steal from them in an ingenious way (Herodotus 3.102).61 This connection of ants and gold is confirmed by a pas sage in the epic Mahäbhärata (2.48.4).

sacrifice the kings "brought the gold called Pipllika, which is granted by the pipilika ants, and they brought it by bucketsful and piles."62 Similarly, in a description of a golden mountain, a Mongolian legend declares, "there is gold in nuggets which the king of the ants has piled up during his activities." Finally, this connection is made in a Tibetan chronicle where the king asks, in an enumeration of im pressive works, "will I fill up Fox valley with ant-gold dust?"63 It may eventually be shown that this ant-gold legend derived from the Altai in Siberia, although no evidence has so far been brought forward to prove this. In any case, the legend does not furnish any proof for an immediate connection between Aristeas and Central Asia. The name of the robbers, Arimaspi, a compound most likely containing the Iranian aspa, or "horse," also points more to the immediate neigh borhood of Greece than to a connection with Central Asia.64 A Swedish Orientalist has argued that there existed an ec static cult in the Iranian region whose ecstatic trances sug gest a close resemblance between Zoroaster and the sha

mans. This view has been widely opposed and is rejected by the majority of scholars, even though, as regards soul belief, undeniable points of contact existed between Iranian and Siberian cultures.65 The journey of Aristeas to the Rhipaean mountains i n the North also suggests an influence from the immediate neigh borhood of Greece. The journey has been illuminatingly compared with Gilgamesh's trip to the "Mountain range of Mashu" (Gilgamesh 9.2.9), which was situated in the North (9.5.38).66 I n both cases the same motif is apparent: the journey to a huge mountain i n the North to acquire (or receive) wisdom. Another such journey appears in the Apoc alypse of Enos, a fragment of which occurs in the recently published Cologne Manx Codex: Enos is taken away by an angel to the North where he sees huge mountains and re ceives a revelation.67 The Aristeas legend then reveals the journey of the free soul i n a trance but not so far any influence from shaman ism. The legend of Hermotimos recounted by Apollonius also presents the free soul wandering away during a trance.68

It seems that Hermotimos, unlike Aristeas, even practiced a certain technique of ecstasy because his murderers saw him lying naked. Changing clothing or undressing before falling into a trance is known i n shamanistic seances. The shaman's garment is of the utmost importance and is even initiated with a special song, but the importance of the gar ment does not he primarily in its symbolism, since the sha man also goes into trance by just winding a scarf around his head; it is the change from normal everyday dress that is the significant feature.69 Changing clothing, however, is not restricted to shamans; Hellenistic and later mediums also practiced their art naked or lightly clad.70 Hermotimos' ecstasy was a deep one: he was lying inert like a corpse (somation).
The burning of Hermotimos' body presupposes the belief that his soul could wander away. Similarly, i n Western folk tales the body was turned or the mouth covered with a cloth so that the wandering soul could not re-enter i t . 7 1 The burn ing of the body is a rather ruthless way of preventing the return of the soul and rarely mentioned in Western sources; the closest parallel can be found in an Indian legend of Madras on the subject of a struggle about temple ownership. The two parties, the Jangams and the Kapus, agreed that the owners would be those who found the jasmine flower

of the temple. To obtain this flower "the Jangams, because they were skilled i n the art of transformation, decided to go, and quitting their mortal bodies went in spirit guise in search of the flower. While they were away the Kapus burnt their bodies and when the spirits returned they had nowhere to enter.1'72 Although the traditions about Hermotimos agree that his soul left the body, there is a complicating factor in that Aristotle connects Anaxagoras' theory about nous, or "mind,'' with Hermotimos: "When one man (Anaxagoras) said, then, that reason (nous) was present—as in animals, so through out nature—as the cause of order and of all arrangement, he seemed like a sober man in contrast with the random talk of his predecessors. We know that Anaxagoras certainly adopted these views, but Hermotimos of Clazomenae is credited with expressing them earlier."73 The prominence given to nous is not surprising in the late Archaic Age when Parmenides (B 4. 1) has exhorted "look with the nous" a phrase taken up by Empedocles (B 17. 21) as "gaze with the nous" The special use of the nous for inner observation in the Archaic Age is an important stage in its development that culminated in Plato's idea of the nous as the "eye of the soul."74 Hermotimos, however, i f we understand the

rather obscure allusion of Aristotle correctly—and he is our only source—called the soul that left his body nous, an identification of the free soul with the ego soul (see The Ego Souls below). Hultkrantz, too, not only repeatedly encountered this identification but could also observe that it was always—as now—the intellect within the ego soul that was identified with the free soul. As a very important cause for this iden tification he sees the "quality in the intellect-soul that is expressed in the phrase 'the flight of thought.'. . . Thought shows the same mobility as the free soul—or a still greater mobility. Just as dreams of distant places are interpreted as the journeys of the dream-soul to these places, so also thoughts of remote things (and especially eidetic day dreams?) sometimes imply the removal of the thought-soul to them."75 This explanation will also suffice for Hermotimos' case—assuming at least that our interpretation of Ar istotle is correct—since the Greeks too were struck by the speed of the nous. A simile in the Iliad compares the speed with which Hera goes from Ida to Olympus to the speed with which the nous of a much-travelled man returns to places he once visited.76 The Hermotimos' legend has not been connected with

Central Asia or Siberia and two elements seem to point to Asia Minor. The Cantharidae may have been a sneering reference to a Dionysiac organization, for after the sixth and fifth centuries Dionysos is usually represented with a cantharos in his hand, and Dionysiac cult organizations were especially common i n Asia Minor.77 On a recently published fifth-century bone graffito from Olbia the words "for Dion(ysos)" and "psyche" appear.78 Moreover, in a recently excavated fifth-century grave of a woman, another so-called Orphic lamella has come to light referring to those initiated into Bacchic mysteries.79 This evidence indicates that there was already at an early stage of the Dionysiac cult an interest in the soul and afterlife. Was the murder of Hermotimos, then, perhaps, caused by a rivalry with a Dionysiac organ ization also, possibly under Orphic influence, strongly in terested i n the soul? The story about Hermotimos' wife is obviously an aetiological one; the exclusion of women from Eunostos' temple in Tanagra was also connected with treacherous behavior by a woman (Plutarch Moralia 300/1). Such an exclusion

was not uncommon and could be found mainly on the is lands and the coast of Asia Minor. We meet it in the cult of Heracles in Thasos and Miletus, Egyptian gods in Delos, Zeus and Athena Apotropaioi in Lindos, Zeus Amalos in Lindos, Poseidon in Myconos, Aphrodite Akraia in Cyprus (Strabo 14.6.3), Artemis in Ephesos where only men and free maidens were admitted (Artemidorus 4.4; Achilles Ta rdus 7.13), the Anakes in Elateia, and in the unknown tem ples of Zeus (Callimachus 1.13) and Kronos.80 From the more reliable ethnological accounts it appears that in such a situation the women, although excluded from participa tion in the actual ritual, often still have, in some way, a place in the whole ritual either as actors or as spectators.81 Our sources, however, restrict themselves to lapidary state ments that do not enable us to observe whether this was also the case in ancient Greece. Hermorimos and Aristeas are not the only figures for whom a connection has been claimed with areas influenced by shamanism. Burkert believes Abaris, to whom Heraclides Ponticus perhaps ascribed a trance journey of the soul, came from Central Asia.82 Abaris was reputed to have come in

from the North (no nearer specification is given) with an arrow in his hand—which will have been the reason why Herodotus connected him with Apollo, who was himself an archer (Herodotus 4.36).83 Like Aristeas, Abaris, too, pre sumably claimed to have travelled to the North and, in con sequence, to possess higher wisdom. Dodds saw in this arrow the vehicle for his soul but there is no evidence that the Siberian shamans viewed arrows i n this way.84 The ar row as a vehicle for Abaris is found only in later testimonies,
"Abaris, Priester von Apollo," Körösi CSOMA-Archivum, suppl. 1 (1936; 104-118; Burkert, Lore and Science, 162; Meuli, Gesammelte Schriften 2: 859-864.

Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion, 3rd ed., vol. 1 (Munich 1967) 541; L. Robert, Hellenica 11-12 (1960) 268-271. 8 1 Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational, 161 n. 34 thinks that the use of an arrow as vehicle by the soul is implicit in "the Buryat's shaman's use of arrows to summon back the souls of the sick," but this use of the arrow can instead be connected with a widespread explanation of illnesses as caused by projectiles. See L . Honko, Krankheitsprojektile (Helsinki 1959). When Dodds states that "it is said that the Tatar shaman's external soul is sometimes lodged in an arrow (N. K. Chadwick, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 66 [1936] 311)," he obviously infers too much from the following passage: "The object in which the soul is contained may be the sole of a shoe or a braid of horse-hair, a golden sword, or arrow, or some other small object which is kept carefully hidden away." When Dodds, 172 n. 97, draws a parallel between Greece and India, citing as a source W. Ruben, Acta Orientalia 17 (1939) 164ff.—Dodds means W. Ruben, "Schamanismus im alten Indien." Acta Orientalia 18 (1940) 164-205—his conclusions are, in my opinion, not supported by Ruben s article. In an earlier study—"Indische und griechische Metaphy sik," Zeitschrift für Indologie und Iranistik 8 (1931) 147-227—Ruben had already stated "ob es für die Geschichte fruchtbar sein wird, das 'Neue' in India von Nicht-indo-germanischen wie in Griechenland von Thrakern herzuleiten, mag dahingestellt bleiben (p. 152)." Eliade, Shamanism, 411 is also rather reserved regarding the proposed shamanistic parallel in India: "All these practices and beliefs . . . are not necessarily 'shamanistic' "

while the earliest clearly describe him with the arrow in his hand.85 The later version may well have been influenced by Greek traditions of flying seers, but there is no indication that arrows were associated with flying.86 There are many peoples who separate the role of the bow and the arrow; the Finnish national epic Kalevala (Runo 2.215) mentions magicians with their arrows whereas no mention is made of bows, and a detailed study of arrow symbolism in Siberia rarely mentions the bow.87 The pur pose of Abaris' arrow is unclear, but several uses are pos sible. Just as the plague was thought to be caused by arrows, so people believed in the healing power of arrows,88 and Abaris was believed to have expelled the plague from those cities that had requested him to do so (Iamblichus Life of Pythagoras 19). Abaris also predicted the future, and Dodds himself has pointed to the use of arrows in divination, but

Later testimonies are Heraclides Ponticus fragment 51c Wehrli; Iamblichus Life of Pythagoras 91.

this use is not restricted to shamans and was evidendy known in Israel.89 The evidence presented and the lack of parallels indicate that a connection between Abaris and Central Asia is far from certain. Another example where a connection with shamanism has been postulated is also not above suspicion. According to Dodds, the oracle-giving head of Orpheus suggests Nordic influence; Eliade is even more certain and considers it a clear shamanistic detail.90 A similar use of the severed head is, however, also testified for the Celts, Icelanders, and many other peoples.91 The wide occurrence of this motif does not

of course preclude with certainty a shamanistic derivation of the Orpheus myth, but it does not increase the probability of this suggestion. We conclude that no convincing evi dence exists for shamanistic influence on Archaic Greece; when there are parallels, such as the identification of death and trance, changing clothing before trance, and the oraclegiving head, these are not exclusively shamanistic. It has not yet even been shown that the Scythians who were sup posed by Dodds to have influenced the Greeks knew a sha-, manistic journey of the soul!92 Where does this leave us with Aristeas and Hermotimos? According to Dodds, the tale of Hermotimos is an example of the influence of shamanism i n Greece at the end of the Archaic Age. Before Dodds Karl Meuli claimed the same influence on the legend of Aristeas.93 These interpretations have been accepted by, amongst others, Walter Burkert and, understandably, Mircea Eliade since they complement

Eliade's interpretation of shamanism as an archaic tech nique of ecstasy.94 Yet his interpretation has recently been unanimously rejected by those scholars who have sought a more detailed definition of the shamanistic complex. De spite mutual differences they all agree that the shaman is a phenomenon restricted in time, place, appearance, and activities. Ecstasy and the journey of the soul occur in too many places to be distinguishing traits.95 As shown above, the souls of Aristeas and Hermotimos could wander away in a trance. Such ecstatic journeys pre suppose a free soul able to leave the body. Now it appears probable that psyche sufficiently corresponds with the no tion of the free soul as defined by Arbman and his pupils to be accepted as the Greek version of the free soul. Con sequently, it seems acceptable to claim also the memorates of Aristeas and Hermotimos as valid evidence for Greek soul belief. Finally, although shamanism did not influence the development of the Greek free soul, it, as Burkert remarks, "has in any case performed the useful function of taking the so-called (shamanistic) myths and legends seriously and showing how they make sense as clues to actual cult prac tices/'96 In addition to the legends of Aristeas, Hermotimos, and

Abaris, other reports exist about a journey of the soul. Heraclides Ponticus most likely mentioned a journey of the soul in a description of the miracle worker Empedocles resur recting a woman who had been in a coma for many days.97 He also ascribed a journey of the soul to a certain Empe dotimos, but Rohde saw that Empedotimos was only a fic titious character in a dialogue of Heraclides, and it seems nearly certain that his name was a composition of Emped ocles and Hermotimos.98 Unfortunately, we cannot be too sure of the story of Empedocles either, since "it is clear that any evidence about anything that can be traced to the au thority of Heraclides must be treated with the greatest re serve. It is also clear that it cannot be peremptorily dismissed as sheer invention, for the elements out of which he moulded his fancies were often provided by earlier literature or tra dition."99 Since there is no other information regarding Em pedocles, the authenticity of Heraclides' report must remain in doubt. The young Aristotle seems to have displayed a special interest in the activity of the soul.100 He wrote a dialogue, Eudemos, also known as On the SouL in which he, as an Arabic source informs us, tells "of the Greek king whose soul was caught up in ecstasy" while his body remained inanimate. We are not informed which king it was, but it can hardly have been a contemporary one, and the whole episode looks rather like fiction.101

Aristotle also attended, as his pupil Clearchus relates, a psychic experiment in which someone with "a wand which draws the soul out of the body," a psychoulkos rhabdos, experimented on a sleeping boy:
For after having struck the boy with his wand, he pulled out the soul and, so to speak, leading the soul with the wand far from the body, he showed that the body was motionless and, completely unhurt, did not feel the blows of those who mangled him, like a body bereaved of its soul. Since the soul, in the meantime, had carried itself far away from the body, the man touched the child again with his wand and, after the return of the soul, it told every thing that had happened. That is why both the spectators of this impressive experiment and Aristotle himself believed that the soul is separable from the body.102
This is a very interesting account but it is unfortunately, as many critics have pointed out, pure fiction.103 This sometimes neglected evidence has rightly been com pared with the legends about Hermotimos and Aristeas.104

However, Hermotimos could fall into a trance on his own, whereas the boy seems to have been hypnotized. But here again, even though the authenticity of these accounts is highly suspect, they could hardly have originated without the former existence of the concept of the free soul. Dodds began his "shamanistic" interpretation of the leg ends of Aristeas and Hermotimos with an analysis of the fragment of Pindar cited in Chapter One. In it Pindar says 1 that although the body sleeps, an image of life remains that reveals the coming of adversities or joys. As Dodds observed, Xenophon describes the same behavior of the soul during sleep: " I t is in sleep that it enjoys a certain insight into the future; and this apparendy, because it is freest in sleep" (Xenophon Cyropaedy 8.7.21, tr, Dodds). Dodds also sug gested that this behavior of the soul during sleep can prob ably also be found in the Eumenides (104) of Aeschylus where Clytemnestra says "for in sleep the pkren (the mind) is lightened with eyes (see The Ego Souls below).105 It seems that here, as in the case of Hermotimos, the intellectual soul has been identified with the free soul. Hippocrates gives a much more interesting description of the soul's behavior during sleep: "But when the body is at rest the soul (psyche), being set in motion and awake, administers her own household and of herself performs all the acts of the body. For the body when asleep has no perception; but the soul when awake has cognizance of all things—sees what is visible, hears what is audible, walks, touches, feels pain, ponders. I n a word, all the functions of body and soul are performed by the soul during sleep."106 This passage finely illustrates a typical feature of the free soul absent in Homer: the soul becomes active as soon as

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
the body sleeps. Here, the soul also completely takes over the activities of the individual. Dodds remarked that in the passages of Pindar and Xenophon, " 'psychic1 and bodily activity vary inversely: the psy che is most active when the body is asleep or, as Aristotle added, when it lies at the point of death.'1107 Dodds also noted a similar pattern of behavior for the soul i n the cases of Aristeas and Hermotimos. These observations mean that in fact Dodds had already identified the typical behavior of the free soul, for as explained in Chapter One, the free soul becomes active during unconsciousness and at the moment of death. Since Arbman's investigations had evidently es caped him and he understandably felt unable to explain this pattern of behavior from the Greek tradition, Dodds bnked them to shamanistic practices. This would mean that these typical features of the ''primitive" concept of the soul had already disappeared from the whole of Greece at a very early stage of Greek civilization and suddenly reappeared in postHomeric times for some obscure reason. As shown above, this shamanistic interpretation is based on inadequate par allels. When we take into account that the dualistic concept of the soul at one time seems to have existed almost every where, including among Indo-European peoples, it is much less complicated to suppose both that the features of psyche found in Pindar and Hippocrates did not occur in the epic tradition because there only ''message" dreams are found and that the absence of descriptions of a journey of the soul in the epic was due to the subject matter of those poems.

The Greeks and the Irrational, 140; compare Burkert, Griechische Religion, 446: "Zunächst ist dieses beständiges Etwas (i.e. the soul) keineswegs identisch mit dem empirischen Wachbewusstsein; Pindar beschreibt es geradezu in Antithese zu diesem, es schläft, wenn die Glieder tätig sind, es zeigt sein Wesen allenfalls im Traum, und dann im Tod" (my italics).

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
Thus the passages from Pindar, Hippocrates, and Xenophon like the legends of Aristeas and Hermotimos exemplify the existence of the concept of the free soul in the Archaic Age.
The Ego Souls
In his analysis of the dualistic nature of the soul Arbman distinguished between the free soul and the body souls. The body souls are active during the waking life of the living individual. Arbman found that the body souls are usually divided into two parts: the life soul, often identified with the breath, and the ego soul. The breath soul has been linked in this chapter to the development of the free soul in Archaic Age Greece; the ego soul, however, as it appears in Greece during the Archaic Age, is richer and more varied than the descriptions offered by Arbman and his pupils. Arbman, who was clearly more interested in the free soul, to a certain extent neglected the ego soul, but this neglect was not his alone; his contemporaries and predecessors too were more interested in the problems of afterlife than in those of psychology and, consequently, did not furnish the data Arbman could have used. This is especially true in the studies of soul belief in North Eurasia and Oceania that are based on very fragmentary and scattered sources.108 Arbman used the ego soul to denote individual living con- I

Hultkrantz was more aware of the multiple psychological aspects of the ego soul and his identification of multiple ego souls and his definition of them as "potencies behind the various

acts and phases of the life of consciousness" are apt.109 Yet his descriptions do not suggest the psychological richness and variety of the Greek concepts. I n the epic tradition the major parts of the Greek ego soul were the thymos, noos, and menos.u0 I n the course of the Archaic Age psyche in corporated the psychological attributes of thymos. In the case of Hermotimos, the noos was associated with the free soul but this particular form of the development toward the unitary soul remained unique. The most frequently occurring form for the ego soul i n the Homeric epic is thymos.111 Unlike psyche, thymos is active only when the body is awake. Thymos can urge people on. For example, when Achilles is causing havoc among the Trojans and is going to meet Aeneas "his brave thymos roused h i m " (xx. 174). Sometimes thymos expresses hope, but it is always the hope to act, not to receive something. After Patroclus had been killed, it is said of the Trojans that "their thymos strongly hoped to pull away Patroclus1 body ! from under Ajax" (xvii.234). Thymos is, above all, the source of emotions. Friendship and feelings of revenge, joy and grief, anger and fear—all spring from thymos. Deiphobus "feared in his thymos the spear of the fiery Meriones" (xin.163); Hector reproaches Paris when he does not join

the battle: "Fool, wrongly you stored up bitter anger in your thymos" (vi.326). When Hector has challenged the Greeks, Menelaos finally stands up and "complained loudly in his thymos" (vn.95). However, the action of thymos is not al ways restricted to emotion. Sometimes it serves intellectual ends. Yet, these are not the intellectual activities of an arm chair scholar.112 Deliberations take place in difficult situa tions, in an atmosphere charged with emotions. When Odysseus is left alone by the Greeks in a battle, "he spoke to his proud thymos" (xi.403). Having realized the two pos sibilities left to him, he ends his deliberations by asking, "but why does my thymos consider that?" (xi.407). The thymos was thought to reside mainly in the chest (iv. 152 etc.), where its principal seat was the phrenes (see below). Hera asks Poseidon: "Does not the thymos in your phrenes feel pity for the dying Trojans?" (vin.202). In a few cases the thymos is associated with the limbs. When Odys seus meets his mother Antikleia in the Land of the Ghosts, she reproaches him by saying that it was yearning for him that killed her, and not an "illness which especially takes away the thymos from the limbs by its hateful wasting away" (11.201). This association with the limbs does not contradict its normal location, for Antikleia stressed in this way the effect of the thymos upon a healthy body. The thymos normally stays in its place and does not move around, but it is affected by a swoon. Homer, as we have already seen in the previous section, describes all swoons according to a set pattern. This pattern indicates that upon awakening from a swoon, the thymos resumes its inter rupted activity. After Andromache has fainted at the sight of Hector's body being dragged around the city, her recovery is described thus: "And when she had recovered her breath and the thymos was concentrated into her phren, she said

, . (xxn.475). These words suggest that during a swoon the thymos leaves its original seat, but they do not neces sarily imply that it always leaves the body, as has been suggested.113 The verb used, ageirö "to collect," or "to gather," could point to a concentration of something that has been dispersed i n the body. This is suggested in another passage: when Menelaos realizes that he is not dangerously hit, "the thymos became again concentrated in [not: into] his chest" (iv.152).114 The description of Sarpedon's swoon, however, seems to indicate an actual leaving of the body since the wind is said "to restore to life him who had blown forth his thymos" (v.697f.).115 Not only does it seem that the thymos was sometimes represented as a kind of breath, but the concept could also have been influenced by the concept of psyche.
What was the thymos originally? It has recently been shown that the thymos must once have been a substance that could be brought into movement, and this observation again lends support to an old etymology connecting thymos with words such as the Latin fumus, or "smoke."116 Thymos is indeed sometimes represented as a kind of breath (iv.524; xvi.468), but an identification with the psyche should not be assumed from this one point of resemblance.117 More intellectual is noos, which after Homer usually is

written in its contracted form as nous118 It is the mind or an act of mind, a thought or a purpose. Whatever Patroclus may do, "the noos of Zeus is always more powerful than that of men" (xvi.688); Nausicaä "laid the lash on her mules with noos" (6.320), so that her maids and Odysseus could follow her on foot; Zeus reproaches Athena: "Did you not yourself devise that noos?" (5.23). Yet the noos is not ex clusively intellectual. Agamemnon "rejoiced in his noos" (8.78); Paris says of Hector that "the noos in his chest is fearless'1 (m.63). The intellectual meaning is, however, much more prominent. The noos is always located in the chest (iv.309 etc.) but it is never conceived of as something material. It cannot be struck or pierced or blown out. There is nothing that even hints at an origin as an organ of the body. Many attempts have been made to etymologize noos, but until the present day none of these has gained general acceptance. The most recent attempts agree in suggesting a connection between noos and neomai, "to return," but they differ sharply in the explanations of the semantic developments, and a definitive solution does not yet seem to be forthcoming.119 Like noos, menos is not a physical organ.120 It is a mo

mentary impulse of one, several, or even all mental and physical organs largely directed toward a specific activity. This impulse, although observed by the subject, can only be influenced by him to a limited extent.121 When Odysseus' father Laertes rejoiced in the fight against the suitors, "Pal las Athene breathed a great menos into him . . . and whirling back he swung his long-shafted spear" (24.520); after the wounded Glaucus has prayed to Apollo, the god "immedi ately eased his pains . . . and put menos into his thymos" (xvi.529); when Nestor tries to resolve the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon, he appeals to the king: "Son of Atreus, stop your menos" (i.282). Menos can also be the fury of a warrior. In the heat of the battle Helenus sketches to Aeneas and Hector the des perate situation caused by Diomedes, for "he rages furiously and no man can match him with his menos" (vi. 101). Georges Dumézil has suggested that the Homeric menos was similar to the Irish dasâcht and the Germanic WzU, the martial rage that made the warrior behave in the same way as Odin's men: "his men rushed forwards without armor, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were strong as bears or wild bulls, and killed people at a blow, but neither fire nor iron told upon themselves. This was called the Berserk fury."122

Although menos is indeed used to denote the ardor of the warrior, in Homer the equivalent of the berserk's fury is expressed by the word lyssa, or "wolfs rage," as appears from the words of Odysseus when he describes Hector: "Hector, exulting greatly in his might, rages vehemently, relying on Zeus and holding no one in respect, neither men nor gods. And the powerful lyssa has entered h i m " (ix.2379, tr. L i n c o l n ) . 1 2 3 A warrior possessed by the lyssa had lost control over himself and he had stopped being fully human: daimoni isos, or "resembling a supernatural being," is the normal term for a warrior gone berserk.124 Yet, the menos on the battlefield can hardly have been negligible either, since the existence of the words dusmenes and Persian dusmanah (equivalent to the Turkish dusman), or "enemy," suggests that the enemies were especially feared because of their adverse menos. The menos was located either in the chest (xix.202) or i n the thymos (xvi.529). It could also be located in the phrenes (1.89). It has been argued that menos was conceived as some thing gaseous, since the Abantes are described as "breath ing forth menos" (n.536), and during a nightly raid "the owl-eyed Athena breathed menos into Diomedes" (x.482).125 However, the last example can be compared to expressions from the Veda where it is said that thought, skill, and spir itual power are breathed toward someone without any sug gestion that they are gaseous by nature.

expression, which derives from a common Indo-European langage poétique, can be explained from a quality of breath ing. Just as one breathes into the fire and fans it, so one breathes into persons spiritual powers and fans t h e m . 1 2 6 This suggestion finds support in Greek expressions where it is said that menos is difficult to "put out1' (xvi.621), or that menos is "inextinguishable" (xxn.96). However, the expression "breathing forth menos" most likely finds its or igin i n the meaning of menos as martial rage: the heavy breathing shows the energy spent in battle. Finally, it may be observed that menos has not developed in the same direction as the related Indian manas and Per sian manah. The latter two both expanded into a secondary free soul,127 while menos occupies only a small place in the Greek ego soul. The reasons for this separate development still have to be investigated. How do these ego souls compare with Hultkrantz's con ception of the ego soul? Hultkrantz, who has studied the ego soul i n the most detailed way, defines it as
a body-soul of a rather heterogeneous and sometimes obscure nature. In its "pure" form it constitutes a hypostasis of the stream of consciousness, the centre for thinking, willing and feeling—the mind in a wide sense. But at the same time as in this way the egosoul shows its close kinship with our concept of the ego, it man ifests certain peculiar features which makes it clear that it is not an expression for the individual's own personality, but a being within the individual which endows him with thought and will etc. The soul of consciousness has probably obtained its function of potency in the individual on the same grounds as the life-soul: the perceptions, thoughts, desires etc. which constitute the con scious content of the ego often manifest a certain independence, especially when (as in above all psychasthenic persons) in con

sequence of their strength they are found to conflict with other tendencies in the mind or acquire the character of compulsive notions, compulsive acts, phobias and so forth. This peculiarity of the ego-soul explains why we find it now split into several poten cies, now taking up an exaggeratedly independent, at times su perior attitude towards its owner.128
It is clear that there are many points of resemblance to the thymos, noos, and menos, but Hultkrantz's definition does not suggest the richness and variety of the Greek material. Also, Hultkrantz's own material does not correspond com pletely with his definition, since his "pure" form is evidently an abstraction nowhere encountered in reality. Every tribe he studied appears to have had its own variants.129 In addition to thymos, noos, and menos there are a num ber of organs with both physical and psychological attri butes. These organs may be called rudimentary ego poten cies.1 3 0 The gradual disappearance of the physical associations of these terms seems to have led to the greater development of the ego soul.131 The most important of these are the phrenes, the location of the emotions of joy and grief, fear and anger.132 The phrenes also have an intellectual attribute partially overlapping with noos but different "in that noos is more concerned with noticing present facts or picturing future ones, phrenes with reasoning about them."133 When

Menelaos wanted to take Adrastos prisoner, Agamemnon strongly objected and "he persuaded the phrenes of his brother" (vi.61); Agamemnon is described in the prologue of the Doloneia as "pondering many things in his phrenes" (x.4). Scholars used to suppose that the phrenes meant the dia phragm, but strong arguments can be made that Homer must also have meant the lungs.134 It is certain, however, that later on the phrenes were understood as the diaphragm, although this meaning does not seem to fit everywhere.135 The different location has baffled scholars, but can perhaps be understood i f we look to the breath as common factor in emotions such as joy and grief and in organs such as the lungs and the diaphragm. When we feel good, euphron, or "with a good phren, cheerful," our breath stays even, but feelings of anxiety or unrest change our normal way of breathing to panting, for example; in such a case we feel the breath near our diaphragm. The Greeks would have learned the connection of the breath with the lungs early on through their many sacrifices and through injuries on the battlefield. The prapides are of far less importance; they are the seat of intelligence (1.6Ο8), desire (xxiv.514), and grief (x.43). Their exact location is unclear, but they have been ex plained as being the l u n g s . 1 3 6 In a number of passages Homer uses the word choios, or "gall," for w r a t h . 1 3 7 The physical attribute usually dominates as in the following outburst of Achilles when he quotes the words of his own Myrmidons: "Hard son of Peleus, your

mother reared you on cholos" (xvi.203). The psychological aspect is prominent in vi.335 where Paris says to Hector that he did not sit down "from cholos against the Trojans." Finally, there are kardia, kêr, or "heart," and êtor that is usually translated to mean "heart" but that originally might have meant "vein."138 These words denote a whole spectrum of feelings, like thymos, but do not have an intellectual content and are rarely the seat of desire or hope. When Aias has rebuked Achilles, he answers him: "my kardia swells with cholos" (ix.646); the Greeks buried their dead in si lence, "mourning in their kêr" (vn.428); Odysseus' "êtor quivered with eagerness" (v.670). Kêr seems to be evolving away from its physical origin, the reason perhaps why kardia was formed, which is never located in another place. Hector tells Paris: "my kêr is mourning in my thymos" (vi.523f.); Alkinoos answers Odysseus: "Stranger, this kêr of mine in my chest is not such as to be angered without reason" (7.308f.); Odysseus' "feër pondered in his phrenes" (18.344). Êtor is the least physical of these organs; it is located in the chest (n. 188), the phrenes (vni.413) and the kardia (xx. 169).
The Soul Animals
The free soul was sometimes imagined in the shape of an animal. This puzzling phenomenon is not easy to un derstand. Hultkrantz gives the following explanation:
The most important of the non-human forms in which the freesoul is manifested is without doubt the theriomorphic one. The conception of the theriomorphic free-soul constitutes in a way a

T H E SOUL OF T H E LIVING
link towards the belief in the transmigration of souls. Not that the deceased person in the shape of an animal is to be understood as a continuation of the form assumed by his free-soul during his life-time. But the free-soul in animal form and the deceased person in animal form have presumably the same psychological (hallu cinatory, illusionary, incidentally associative) cause. In both cases it is practically impossible to distinguish between the animal as the form in which the soul or the ghost is manifested and the animal as the dwelling of the soul or the ghost. The notions here merge insensibly into each other.139
Hultkrantz's explanation is not completely satisfactory. The soul's appearance in the shape of a bear or a raven is more likely to be a case of transmigration, since the body cannot contain these animals. It is more plausible to see in a soul animal of small dimensions a manifestation of the soul rather than an indication of a transmigrating soul since the soul usually leaves the body through the mouth or the nose. Furthermore, Hultkrantz's explanation does not sufficiently stress the fleeting nature of these small animals. Their tran sitory nature does not point to hallucinations or illusions, relatively restricted phenomena, but to dreams: the fleeting nature of the dreams reflects itself in the fleeting nature of the animals. There is a great variety in the small soul animals. In Central Europe the mouse was by far the most dominant; farther to the east insects played a more prominent role, and in Siberia the mouse did not occur as a soul animal at all. The nature of the insects varied by country. In Japan the bee, the wasp, and the dragonfly functioned as soul animal, in Estonia the dung-beetle, and in Ireland the but terfly. Yet the evidence is still very incomplete for Europe and Asia, and virtually absent for the rest of the w o r l d . 1 4 0

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
Tentatively, we may distinguish between two categories of soul animals.141 On the one hand there are the bee, the wasp, the fly, and similar small insects that in antiquity and later were often not sharply distinguished. In European leg ends these animals are not bound to the body and they represent the owner in his full identity. We may consider these as representing the free soul. On the other hand there are the animals that, originally, were supposed to exist in side the living body, like the mouse, which seems to have been considered by some peoples as the carrier of life. For example, people in some parts of Finland held that the twitching of the eye or the moving of a muscle (from the Latin musculus, or "little mouse") was caused by the elohiiri, or "life-mouse," whose presence guaranteed the con tinuation of l i f e . 1 4 2 The mouse may also be compared to those animals that seem to have come into existence only at the hour of death such as the snake i n Greece or the butterfly in Estonia. These animals seem to represent the body souls. This distinction creates at least some order in a seemingly chaotic world of insects, reptiles, and small mammals. How ever, the distinction is largely a theoretical one, for among many peoples contaminations between the two categories have taken place. When other ideas concerning the per sonality and the causes of life originated, the boundaries between the two categories became blurred. In ancient Greece we do not find the soul of a living person imagined as an insect. It has been suggested that the soul

of Herrnotimos appeared as a fly because he is discussed i n Lucian's Panegyric to the Fly (7), but this can hardly be called a convincing argument.143
Conclusion
What exactly was the early Greek concept of the soul? Greek soul belief of the Archaic Age was dualistic: it still separated two elements, the free soul and the body souls that together constitute the modern concept of the soul. The word psyche corresponds most with Arbman's concept of the free soul, although the activity of the soul in trance and dream, which we should have expected in the light of Arbman's definition, is only evident in post-Homeric times. Considering the fragmentary state of the sources we could perhaps hardly have expected this to be otherwise. The Greeks, then, displayed in the earliest stages of their soul belief the same broad categories that Arbman and his pupils came across in their research. However, the com plexity in the Homeric epic of the free soul psyche and the body souls thymos, noos, and menos shows that Arbman's description of the soul as dualistic is limited, as one of Arb man's critics rightly observed.144 Instead Greek soul belief might best be characterized as multiple. The Greeks sep arated where other traditions do not and a unitary soul can only be found i n the period after the Archaic Age. Finally, the early multiple nature of the soul offers a new perspective from which to view the debate about the Greek conception of the psychic whole. Bruno Snell has main tained that the early Greeks did not yet know any concept denoting the psychic whole (see Chapter One). Opponents of Snell's thesis have rightly argued that the early Greeks could easily say " I wish" or " I thought" and, consequently,

must have had a general sense of psychic coherence and, at least, an imperfect notion of the unity of the personality.145 Snell also neglected the importance of the individual's name: Homer speaks of a named individual's psyche, thymos, and noos,146 On the other hand, i n Homer's time the individual did not yet know of the will as an ethical factor, nor did he distinguish between what was inside and outside himself as we d o . 1 4 7 When referring to themselves, the early Greeks, like other Indo-European peoples, did not primarily consider themselves to be independent individuals but rather mem bers of a group.148 Yet, this argument can also be carried too far. Greek mythology presents numerous heroes who defy the norms of gods and men, such as Ajax, Achilles, and Bellerophon; these heroes are often depicted as mar ginal figures,149 but their prominence shows that early Greece

must have known numerous independent individuals. How ever, it is beyond the scope of this investigation to discuss problems concerning the notion of the unity of the self; still, the fact remains that the Greeks perceived the attributes of their personalities to be structured differently than we per ceive ours today.150 It is only in fifth-century Athens that we start to find the idea that the citizen can determine his own, independent course of action.151 By the end of that century psyche became the center of consciousness, a de velopment not yet fully explained but upon which, most likely, a strong influence was exerted by the rise of literacy and the growth of political consciousness.152 And it seems likely that the systematic reflection on the soul started pre cisely at the end of that century because the psyche had become the center of consciousness and for that reason would have provoked a much stronger interest than be fore.153

THE SOUL OF T H E LIVING
After the end of that century there is no longer the whole complex of the dualistic concept of the soul: a free soul representing the individuality in sleep, swoons, and trance without any contact with the ego souls, thymos, noos, and menos. This does not mean to say that in some parts of Greece elements of "primitive1' soul belief could not have lingered on. In modern Europe, too, elements of primitive soul belief persist in tales of bilocation and the soul wan dering off during sleep (see Appendix Two). It does mean, however, that i f these elements lingered on, they existed alongside a different concept of the soul, the unitary one, a concept absent in the period before systematic reflection on the soul began.

T H E S O U L of the dead has not recently received the same systematic attention as the soul of the living. The great monographs on soul belief in North America and Oceania have discussed it only i n short chapters,1 and Ivar Paulson, Arbman's pupil, who intended to investigate this question systematically on a scale similar to his great study of the soul of the living i n North Eurasia, died before finishing the project. However, he did publish some prehminary ar ticles that give an indication of how he intended to proceed with his analysis of the soul of the dead.2 By identifying the elements of the complex forming the soul and correspond ing with the Western concept of the soul that survived and represented the individual after death he showed that in many instances the free soul of the hving continues as the soul of the dead.3 To give two examples, the word for the

free soul among the Mordvins, a tribe in the Altai, is ort. Since the soul of the dead is also called ort, the conclusion can be drawn that the idea of the soul of the dead was derived generically from the soul of the living. Among the Japanese Ainu the original ego soul ramat developed into a secondary free soul, which is the soul of the dead who are also called ramat. Paulson's method of investigation has its hmitations. His approach is much influenced by the Western concept of the soul since he accepted as universal a common Western belief that, after death, the soul represents the individual. But there are other peoples for whom either the body sur vives, or the deceased are said to become theriomorphic beings, spirits, or revenants. In some places, too, the ter minology for the soul of the dead is completely different from that of the living.4 Paulson also purposely abstained from discussing the connection between the soul of the dead and the dead body. Consequently he was able to avoid dis cussing the actual content of man's idea about the soul of the dead. Since it is the body that is a living force i n the community, it is likely that ideas about the dead body have some influence on the representation of the soul.5

5 The transmigration of the soul is a relatively late, speculative doctrine that originally did not belong to Greek religion and will not be discussed here. On the other hand I cannot help agreeing with Burkert that the existence of this doctrine presupposes that in living beings, be they man or animal, there is an individual and permanent "something" preserving its own identity independently from the body. The body may decay, but this "something" keeps itself intact. The existence of such a "something," the psyche, becomes, I suggest, much more understandable against the background of my interpretation of psyche as the Greek version of the

Other scholars such as Nilsson have believed that soul belief can be inferred from a consideration of funeral rites.6 Rites and customs can indeed express corresponding con cepts, but the concept that once corresponded to the rite can also change or be lost. In different cultures similar rites correspond to different concepts. A rite can be performed because it is considered traditional, and there may or may not have been an earlier concept explaining it; invading peoples may have taken over rites from the earlier inhab itants without accepting the corresponding beliefs. Postu lating beliefs only on the basis of the funeral rites then must be done very carefully. It seems safe to make postulates only when these rites are accompanied by contemporary expla nations. These explanations do not need to be right, but they will at least indicate a current belief. Yet, however cautious we must be, the funeral rites can certainly not be left out of account, for already in 1907 Robert Hertz dem onstrated that among the peoples of Indonesia and many others funeral rites were thought to aid the transition of the soul from the world of the living to the world of the world of the dead.7

THE SOUL OF T H E DEAD
Taking these prehminary considerations into account, in this chapter we shall develop in detail the following outline of the early Greek views of the soul of the dead. Of all the elements of the soul described earlier for the soul of the living, it is the free soul in the form of psyche that becomes identified as the soul of the dead. The soul of the dead was not dual or multiple and lacked the psychological traits as sociated with thymos, noosy and menos. And the develop ment toward a unitary soul for the soul of the living does not correspond with a change in the concept of the soul of the dead. The psyche leaves the body at the moment of death and begins an afterlife. After death, however, the deceased is presented not only as psyche but also as an eidolon or compared to shadows. Occasionally the body itself repre sents the deceased in an afterlife and there are reports as sociating the dead with the snake. It is the physical attributes of the soul that have some importance for the Greeks rather than the psychological. The descriptions of the eidolon suggests that the Greeks believed the dead soul looked like the living being. And they described the physical actions of the souls of the dead in two opposite ways: they believed both that the dead souls moved and spoke like the living and that the soul of the dead could not move or speak but instead flitted and squeaked. The funeral rites of the Greeks functioned as a rite of passage for the soul from the world of the living to the afterlife. Souls of those who died without being full mem bers of the social order such as criminals, children, and adolescents were not given full funeral rites and were not thought to enter fully into the world of the dead. Yet, as we shall see, there is little evidence that those who died outside

THE SOUL OF T H E DEAD
the ordered social world remained to haunt the living as ghosts or revenants.
The Soul at the Moment of Death
Of all the elements of the soul only the psyche continues in an afterlife and represents the individual. And of all these elements it is precisely the psyche which, as shown above, corresponds most closely to Arbman's definition of the free soul. This suggests that for the Greeks as for many other peoples the free soul of the living was the same as the soul of the dead. The souls of the dead, however, lacked the psychological elements associated with the ego souls of the soul of the living. In Homer when someone dies, the psyche leaves and does not return. After Hyperenor had been fatally hit, his psyche quickly left him (xiv.518). In the cases of Patroclus (xvi.856), Hector (xxu.362), and Elpenor (10.560 and 11.65) Homer adds that the psyche went to Hades. In these cases the psyche always leaves the body under its own power. Only in the case of Andromache's swoon is it said that she blew forth her psyche (xxn.467). When Pandaros was killed by Diomedes, his psyche and menos were 'loosened" (v.296). It seems that here the act of being "loosened," which is more appropriate to menos (see below), has been transferred to psyche.
In the actual epic descriptions of the moment of death the axon is never mentioned, yet death must have been closely connected with the absence of the axon because death is expressed as the departure of the axon (v.685; 7.224) or the deprivation of the axon (xxn.58). Achilles is afraid that the maggots will defile the dead body of Patroclus "for the axon has been slain out" (xix.27). At the moment of death the individual also loses his thymos. This process can be expressed in different ways. After
74



T H E SOUL OF T H E DEAD
Dioreus had been fatally hit "he fell backwards i n the dust . . . while he blew forth his thymos" (xin.654). Sometimes the thymos departs under its own power. Ajax hit Sarpedon's comrade-in-arms Epikles, who "like an acrobat fell down from the high wall, and the thymos left his bones" (xn.386). Sometimes it is said that the thymos is taken out of or away from the body. Diomedes slew the sons of Phaenops and "took out the thymos from both" (v. 155). Later on he killed Axylos and his servant and "from both he took away the thymos" (vi.17). What happens to the thymos once it has left the body remains completely obscure. Unlike psyche it never goes to Hades, with which it is connected only once. Nestor lets Peleus wish "that his thymos might go from his limbs into the house of Hades" (vn.131). This expression, though, seems to be a rhetorical wish and not a reflection of normal belief.8 Finally, it is not without importance to observe that when someone is killed, or the wish to kill is expressed, it is more often the thymos than the psyche which is men tioned as having left the body. This supports our earlier analysis of the role and place of the psyche of the living: when an individual is normally active the psyche is hardly thought of.9 Although today there exists great interest in the presence or absence of the mind at the moment of dying, the noos is never mentioned in Homeric descriptions of death. The poet always characterizes death by describing the departure of the psyche, thymos, or menos. Since the noos was con

(Gottingen 1974) 21 considers it a case of later poetic contamination. 9 This becomes very apparent from the ratio of thymos and psyche in the Homeric epic which is 9.3:1 (the counting is based on the Concord ances of Prendergast and Dunbar). This ratio is even rather distorted in favor of psyche by the high occurrence of psyche in Odyssey 11 and 24.
75



T H E SOUL OF T H E DEAD
nected more vaguely with the body than the other "souls," such as the thymos and menos, this is hardly surprising. Death naturally puts an end to the activity of the menos, but unlike -psyche and thymos, menos is never said to leave the body. Its activity is invariably said to be "loosened, un harnessed," a metaphor comparing the collapsing of the dead with the collapsing of horses when they are unhar nessed after a tiring ride (the verb used, lyo, is especially used for the unharnessing and unyoking of horses, oxen etc.). After Pandaros had fallen from his chariot, his horses became frightened by his shining armor and "from him straightway his psyche and menos were loosened" (v.296). Homer uses the same expression to describe the end of Eniopeus (vni.123) and Archeptolemos (vin.315). The ego potencies are of less interest. Excluding the ref erences where a clear physical meaning is indicated, only etor is mentioned, the least physical of the ego potencies. Achilles left Xanthus lying in the sand "since he had taken away his etor" (xxi.201). The same expression is used for the dead Hector (xxiv.50) when Achilles drags him round Patroclus1 grave. It is not surprising that after death nothing is said of the body souls. Their connection with the body is the cause of their disappearance. Outside Greece it sometimes does hap pen, though, that a body soul survives after death. In the case of those peoples with a thoroughly dualistic soul belief the body soul never represents the person's real personality but turns, for example, into a spook.
Human and Theriomorphic Manifestations of the Deceased
As we have seen, psyche represented the identity of the deceased; the dead in the afterlife are indeed often called
76



T H E SOUL OF T H E DEAD
psychai (11.84, 90 etc.).10 However, psyche is not the only term in use for the dead, nor is the moment of death ex pressed only in terms of a psyche leaving the body. In Homer the body sometimes represents the individual; the dead are compared to shadows, and the term eidolon is used to de scribe the soul of the deceased. There is some evidence, too, to indicate that the Greeks believed the soul of the dead to be embodied in the snake. After Agamemnon had killed the sons of Antenor, Iphidamas and Koön, "they went into the house of Hades" (xi.263). Here, then, it is not psyche but the persons them selves who are said to have gone to Hades. A similar idea may be behind those expressions where the dead are re ferred to as "menos-less heads of the dead" (10.521; 11.29, 49), for the head sometimes functioned as pars pro toto. Although the idea is rare in Homer, the phenomenon is not uncommon elsewhere. Hultkrantz has written: "Various pronouncements by Indians from different parts of America testify to the fact that the souls' identification with the de ceased has not been self-evident and immediately given: we are told that the person survives, and if there are the be ginnings of an indication of the roles played by the souls in the transition to the new existence opinion is not infrequendy divided, confused and contradictory."11 In some areas of Oceania, too, it was not the free soul but the homo totus that became the soul of the dead.12 Given the paucity of material on the period it is impossible to draw a firm con clusion, but it seems that in Homeric times, too, traces of such a belief were still visible.13
1 0 It is therefore very striking that in a papyrus fragment (P. Köln 3.125), which probably derives from Aeschylus' Psychagogoi, the psychai of the dead are called apsychoi, or "life-less," see H. Lloyd-Jones, ZP£ 42 (1981) 21; J . S. Rüsten, ZP£ 45 (1982) 36 n. 10.

THE SOUL OF T H E DEAD
Among a number of peoples the dead are called "shad ows." However, Homer only compares the dead to a shadow. After Circe had told Odysseus that Teiresias was the only one i n Hades with a rcoos, she added: "but the others (i.e. the other people in Hades) flit like shadows (10.495),14 And when Odysseus wanted to embrace his mother i n the Un derworld, she flew away "like a shadow or a dream" (11.207f). The relationship between the soul of the dead and the shadow is still i n need of a systematic discussion based upon large-scale exploitation of the anthropological material.15 Hultkrantz observes that in some quarters it is stressed that the physical shadow becomes a ghost after death, but as a rule there is no such identity. I n most cases in which the dead person is represented as a shadow there is no conti nuity between the shadow of the living individual and the "shade" of the deceased, and so the term "shadow" is only a metaphor. These observations of Hultkrantz are fully sup ported by the (admittedly scarce) Homeric material.16 Sometimes the word eidolon is used.17 Patroclus com
M Onians, The Origins of European Thought, 95 and G. van der Leeuw, Phänomenologie der Religion, 2nd ed. (Tubingen 1956) 325 identify the dead with the shadow, but in that case it would be suggested that Teiresias was not a skia, or "shadow." 1 5 For the shadow, see E . L.

plained to Achilles that the "eidola of those who have been worn out" prevented him from entering the gates of Hades ( X X I I I . 72, 11.476, 24.14). During his visit to Hades Odys seus spoke with the eidolon of his friend Elpenor (11.83). And after the bloody end of the suitors, the seer Theoclymenos saw the doorway to the court filled with eidola (20.355). The meaning of eidolon becomes clear from two passages. After Apollo had taken Aeneas away to a temple to be healed after a fight against Diomedes, "he made an eidolon like Aeneas himself' (v.450). Athena sent Penelope an eidolon which she made like Iphthime (4.796). From these passages it appears that an eidolon is a being that looks exactly like a person. This becomes especially clear in the case of Achilles when he is visited by the psyche of Patroclus i n a dream. When Patroclus departs, Achilles tries to embrace him, but Patroclus' psyche vanishes without Achilles succeeding. He then realizes that it was a "psyche and eidolon" although "it was wondrous like h i m " ( X X I I I . 104-107). The word ei dolon, thus, originally stressed the fact that for the ancient Greeks the dead looked exactly like the living. Democritus, however, could already use the word for ghosts with a super natural appearance.18 In Homer the term eidolon is never used for the souls of the living.19 It is found only for the hving i n the fragment of Pindar cited in Chapter One. In the dirge to which this fragment belongs Pindar is naturally concerned with the fate of the dead.20 It is therefore not surprising that he uses

eidolon for the soul i n general, first for that part of the individual that survives death "for this alone has come from the gods," then for the same part already manifesting itself during lifetime. The divine origin of the eidölori will have been Pindar's explanation for the continuity of the soul of the living—if he did not derive the idea from the doctrines of the transmigration of the soul.21 The deceased was occasionally thought to assume the form of an animal, and in the first decades of this century there existed a lively interest i n these theriomorphic man ifestations that led to the identification (more often than not untenable) of all kinds of ammals with the soul of the dead. It is the great merit of Nilsson to have radically rejected all these identifications, since for virtually none of them was there convincing evidence that a soul of the dead was really meant. The only animal retained by Nilsson, and that un equivocally can be considered to have been a soul animal in Archaic Greece, is the snake. As a soul animal it was especially connected with the grave and above all with the grave of the hero.22 This particular function of the snake developed from its position as protector of the house, al though the Greeks themselves sometimes suggested that the marrow of a dead body changed into a snake.23 The snake probably already functioned as the protector of the house in Neolithic times. It was still regarded in this way

in large parts of northern and southern Europe in the early part of this century.24 The classical discussions of the snake as the soul of the dead are not quite satisfactory for this investigation, since they use the term "soul" without reflecting on the relation ship between the psyche as the soul of the dead and the snake. I f the deceased was normally thought to be repre sented by the psyche in the underworld, what then was the position of the snake? Was a person perhaps at one time thought to have a double existence after death? The only possible example of such an existence is Her acles, whose eidolon was seen by Odysseus in the under world but who himself was living among the immortal gods (11.602-604). However, this passage looks like a late con struction, set up in order to explain different traditions about Heracles, and can hardly be considered as an expression of original soul belief since, as Hultkrantz observes,
The deceased in the realm of the dead is always considered to continue the existence and consciousness of the dead person. . . . The same person can thus, in genuine belief, not at the same time figure in two realms of the dead (1 am here of course thinking of the belief held by one and the same individual). In naive belief the ghost remaining at the grave or other places in the vicinity of the living may be taken as the adequate form of expression for the deceased himself, especially as the dead person is sometimes con ceived as returning to the living. If, however, the connection be tween soul and spook-ghost be emphasized, the latter appears as a distorted by-product, a remote echo of the departed individual,

not as his real ego, his personality. About the same applies to the other forms of the deceased as to the spook-ghost: according to the degree of reflection and to the occurrence of definite associ ations to one of the souls of the living individual they are under stood as being more or less identical with him.25
Unfortunately our sources are not very informative about the cult of the dead and we simply do not know what or even i f the Greeks of the Archaic Age thought about the precise connection of the snake with the soul and body of the dead, although in naive belief the snake was evidently taken as the deceased himself Aristotle (Historia Animalium 551 A) indicates that the word psyche also meant "butterfly.'1 Curiously, this seems to be the only word for butterfly known by the Greeks—a fact that has been insufficiently taken into account by Nilsson;26 consequendy, the meaning will be older than its first occurrence suggests. Unfortunately, there are no other in dications of a possible connection between the butterfly and the soul of the living and the dead. It seems that in Minoan times—but the evidence is debated—the butterfly stood in some relationship to the dead, but this of course does not prove that the butterfly was indeed conceived of as a soul of the dead in the period under investigation.27 The possi bility should not be excluded, however.
The Relation Between the Soul and the Body of the Dead

this transition, for it is the person himself who goes on living in the new existence."28 Hultkrantz is only partially right, at least regarding the Greek material. It is certainly true that there is a corollary of this idea i n the Nekuia where Heracles (11.601 -627) and Orion (11.572-575) are depicted as continuing their earthly activities, but there are also other representations that are not so easy to understand if we follow Hultkrantz, The dead, for example, i n Homer cannot speak i n a normal manner, neither do they move i n the normal way. How can these features be reconciled with Hultkrantz's definition of the deceased as a memory image of an earlier existing person? Here, Hultkrantz's analysis is somewhat deficient, i n so far as he has failed to identify the factors constituting the memory image of the deceased and to take into account the difference between the memories of a living person and a dead one. Memories of the dead are not only influenced by, for example, the way they spoke, moved, or laughed when still alive but also by the way they were at the moment of death when they did not speak, move, or laugh. I n fact, both memories seem to have created the memory image of the deceased for the early Greeks. The great importance of the moment of death is very much apparent in the description of the appearance of the dead with wounds exactly as they received them just before they died. Homer describes the warriors at the entrance to Hades still dressed in their bloody armor (11.41). Similar descriptions can also be found after Homeric times; Aes chylus has the eidolon of Clytemnestra display her death wounds (Eumenides 103), and Plato elaborately explains this idea, but refines it i n a way by adding that the soul also retains the scars of its former existence.29 The same theme

is found on vases, where the dead are regularly shown with their wounds, sometimes still bandaged.30 Among the Ro mans descriptions of the souls of the dead with their wounds became a very popular topos.31 The great importance of the soma, or "dead body," for the representation of the soul of the dead is also apparent in other descriptions.32 The souls of the dead lacked the psy chological attributes of the souls of the living. Since the thymos left the individual at the moment of death it is un derstandable that we never hear of any soul of the dead with a thymos. Neither do the dead possess a noos (10.494-495) or a menos—the dead are called "menos-less heads" (10.493495, 521, 536).33 The only exception is Teiresias (10.493496). As a seer he fell outside the normal community of the living, as has recently been convincingly argued; for that reason he also stands outside the community of the dead.34 Not only do the souls of the dead lack the "souls" and organs connected with an inner life, but other faculties and qualities are also absent. They are unable to speak prop

erly.35 When the soul of Patroclus left Achilles, he disap peared squeaking ( x x m . l O l ) . The same sound was made by the souls of the suitors when they were guided by Hermes to the underworld and for that reason they were compared with bats (24.5, 9). Pythagoras was supposed to have seen Hesiod "bound fast to a bronze pillar and squeaking" (Di ogenes Laertius 8.21). A different sound is attributed to them by Sophocles who writes, "Up comes the swarm of the dead h u m m i n g . " 3 6 This miserable sound of the souls of the dead is obviously caused by their inability to speak. Death is indeed called "voice-robbing" by Hesiod (Shield 131), and Theognis (569) says that he will be as a "voice less stone" when he lies under the earth. This theme of the silent dead is repeatedly met i n later poetry, and the Ro mans, too, called their souls of the dead "keeping silence" or "mute."37 The dead move in a different way. While the individual at the moment of death no longer moves, and alive moves normally, the souls of the dead are described as "flitting" (10.495): they have a surplus of movement. Here, the living being occupies a mediating position between the dead body and the soul of the dead. Finally, we may wonder if in the Archaic Age souls of the dead were supposed to be able to laugh. It is a widespread belief that the dead do not laugh, and that visitors to the underworld and those who have encountered shades can

no longer laugh.38 Laughter is still a highly underresearched subject from an anthropological and historical point of view, but recently scholars have noted the significance of laughter for constituting a group identity, and its relevance for the establishment of the level of bodily control in a particular group or culture.39 The latter point is not without interest for the ancient world, since the fact that ascetics such as Pythagoras (Diogenes Laertius 8.20) and Christian monks did not laugh at all, or only sporadically, fits in well with the observation of the British anthropologist Mary Douglas that narrow groups with a high threshold for bodily control have difficulty in allowing themselves to laugh and so relax their control over the body.40 Folklorists, on the other hand, long ago noted that among many peoples laughter is a sign of life; its absence belongs

to times and places where normal life is not present.41 This observation is especially important for the interpretation of ritual laughter. For example, during the Roman Lupercalia the foreheads of two young men were touched with a blood stained knife—most likely a case of symbolical killing—and they were then cleaned with wool that had been steeped in milk; finally they had to laugh. The succession from "death" to laughter strongly suggests that in this case laughter was indeed a sign of life and, possibly, even implied the incor poration into the community, since the Lupercalia seems to have developed from an ancient puberty ritual.42 Another case of ritual laughter took place in Western Europe, where Easter Sunday used to be the occasion for all kinds of laugh ter and merriment, the risus vaschalis. The laughter can hardly be separated from Jesus' return from the dead, but it will also have had a liberating effect after the serious days of Lent.43 In Greece evidence regarding the absence of laughter can

only be found in the period after the Archaic Age. It was reported that those who had consulted the oracle of Trophonios i n Lebadeia had completely lost the power to laugh during their visit. The loss was explained, at least according to Pausanias (9.39.13), by the impressive experience of the visitor, but the oracle was connected with an entrance to the Underworld; its visitors were carried out of the hole of the oracle feet first, as were corpses.44 Since it seems un likely that the idea of the loss of laughter was newly de veloped or derived from other cultures, it seems a plausible hypothesis that this notion also occurred i n the Archaic Age. The ideas, then, concerning the soul of the dead were strongly influenced by memories of the dead body. However, not all these negative qualities, such as the absence of the noos or a proper voice, were thought to be inherent in the souls of the dead always at one and the same time. In real life it must have been impossible to remember the dead, with whom one had been acquainted, only in this way. In these cases there must have always been memories of ac tivities of the deceased during life that would also determine the memory image. For that reason Patroclus, who has only just died, can be described as appearing to Achilles exactly as he was during his life. And as long as he has contact with Achilles he speaks like a normal mortal; only when the contact is over does he leave squeaking. With the passing of time the precise memories of a spe cific deceased person fade away, and it is understandable that the more personal traits gradually withdraw behind a

more general idea of the dead as the opposite of the living.45 In literature, be it oral or written, there is rarely a personal tie between the dead and the living, and so the negative qualities are stressed. But, here, too this is not kept up consistently, and Achilles (11.467-540) and Ajax (11.543567) behave as i f they were still alive.
Funeral Rites and The Soul
Although the inference of soul belief from funeral rites must be made carefully, there are some clear indications of the Archaic Greek ideas on the function of the funeral rites. The evidence from Homer and other sources suggests that a proper funeral functions as a rite of passage for the dead into an afterlife. I n the Archaic period a funeral was not simply the burial or cremation of the body; there were a series of rites that were thought to aid the dead soul in its passage from the world of the living to the world of the dead. In addition the sources for the period indicate that some of the souls of the dead, including those of children, adoles cents, and criminals, were thought to have a special status. Some of them in fact were thought to remain outside the world of the dead and not to participate fully in the tran sition. When the dead Patroclus appears in a dream to Achilles, he asks to be cremated, because he may not cross the river to Hades in his unburied state (xxin. 72-76). In the Odyssey only Elpenor, who is still unburied, does not need to drink blood to be able to speak. Obviously he is dead but has not

yet become a full shade (11.51-83). And the same belief clearly underlies the story of Sisyphus, who instructed his wife not to perform the proper funeral rites after death so he could persuade Persephone to let him return to the land of the living.46 The connection between the lack of burial and the refusal of admittance to Hades is also a contributing factor to the often expressed fear of death at sea, the throwing of bodies of criminals and enemies of the state into the sea, and the denial of burial as punishment for serious crimes.47 The most famous example of this latter punishment is of course Polyneices in Sophocles' Antigone, but Polyneices evidently was not the only such case since Bion says that anguish over burial was the subject of many tragedies.48 In Attica traitors and those guilty of sacrilege might ex pect to be thrown unburied over the border. This was the fate of Antiphon, the strategoi who did not pick up those who drowned after the battle at the Arginusae in 406, and Phocion and his friends.49 A refusal of burial for those who

Here too the problem arises as to the connection between the mode of behavior and the motivation behind it. Un doubtedly fear of pollution was a powerful factor but a dis cussion in the work of the Cynic philosopher Teles explicitly states that the dead were removed from the space occupied by the living in order to ensure that they were refused entry into Hades.55 In more cosmopolitan times the refusal of burial in one's home ground was looked upon with contempt by philosophers, as indeed appears from the writings of Teles, Epictetus (Arrian Emcteti Dissertationes 4.7.31), and the famous Cynic Diogenes who, according to one tradition, even wanted to be thrown forth after his death.56 A proper funeral in one's own area, then, was thought to be necessary for the final transition from the community of the living to Hades.57 As such, the funeral is part of the larger complex of funeral rites which, in turn, belong to the general complex of the rites of passage, as has been dem onstrated by Arnold van Gennep. This French folklorist and anthropologist showed that the changes an individual undergoes in his life cycle at birth, puberty, marriage, or death, in status such as becoming a priest or a king, in activity such as war, or in location, are often accomplished according to a set pattern. First there is a rite of separation, then a liminal period, and finally a rite of incorporation. The funeral rites belong to the rites of incorporation: they help the transition of the dead from the community of the living to the underworld, and, especially, the transition of the liv

ing to the new situation after the departure of one of their members.58 In rites of passage there is also often an element of delay and resistance. Society and/or the individual has, or pre tends to have, great difficulty i n changing status or position: in some countries bridegrooms used to hide away before being dragged by their friends to the wedding ceremony, people would only hand over the dead body of a beloved to the undertakers after a token resistance, and even today people who are offered an important position usually refuse first—only to accept eagerly afterwards.59 We find such an element of delay in the case of the soul. The soul changes from being part of a living body to being incorporated into Hades, In Homer this process is not par ticularly marked but we have seen that the transition takes place only after the funeral rites proper were completed, that is to say after some days. Between the separation from the body and the incorporation into Hades the soul remained briefly i n a liminal state: it was neither part of the world of the living nor part of the world of the dead. Hertz also noted that the soul did not begin an afterlife immediately after death; i n Oceania, for example, the soul is often believed to stay near the body for a while.60 The same belief appar ently also occurred in Archaic Greece for on black-figured vases of the end of the sixth century Patroclus' soul in the shape of an armored homunculus (the word psyche is ac tually written near the homunculus) is pictured near his

dead body, and on the white lekythoi these often winged souls are pictured near the bier or the tomb, although usu ally not displaying the characteristic features of the de ceased.61 The bereaved evidendy could not accept that the soul of the deceased would go to Hades immediately: there had to be some delay i n the transition. The function of the funeral rites i n facihtating the tran sition of the soul also helps explain the difference between inhumation and cremation among the Greeks. The Greeks used the means of disposal of the dead to differentiate be tween people according to their status: suicides, children, adolescents, and slaves were often buried and not cremated, which was the normal way of disposal. Concomitant with this differentiation went an infranormal status for these cat egories i n Hades, although people who died an untimely death sometimes occupied a supranormal position. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries scholars attached especially great importance to the difference be tween cremation and burial.62 Each practice was thought to correspond to a different idea about an afterlife, even though written sources did not support this view. Anthro pological research has shown that among the North Amer

ican Indians in California and elsewhere the two methods of disposal of the body have coexisted in the same tribe, and that the same method has held a different significance in different tribes.63 In the Roman empire, too, cremation and burial coexisted, and succeeded each other without any cor responding change in ideas about the afterlife. In this re spect the Romans were not unique among the Indo-Euro pean peoples, and there is now overwhelming evidence from all parts of the world that the presence or absence of burial, the change from burial to cremation and vice versa, or the gifts of burial goods, do not in themselves indicate beliefs in an afterlife. As Nock has observed, commenting on Ep icurus, who denied the afterlife but provided for perpetual offerings for his immediate family: "Funerarary ritual is associated in the main with the tomb and not with after life as theoretically conceived. " 6 4 Even though, then, the relevance of contrasting inhu mation and cremation per se has to be rejected, it would have been strange i f the Greeks, with their polar way of thinking,65 had not used the two modes of disposal to dif ferentiate between people according to their age and the manner of their death. Indeed literary and archeological data testify to such a practice. Our earliest example of such

a differentiation is the case of Ajax who, after his suicide, was not cremated but inhumed. According to the Ilias Parva this happened "because of the anger of the king,11 but it may well be wondered if that is not a later explanation, since suicides belonged to the class of the "dead without status" (below).66 Suicides did not receive any honor in Thebes, and in Cyprus they had to be thrown unburied over the borders according to the laws of Demonassa.67 I n Athens one of their hands was cut off (Aeschines 3.244), and Plato, in his Laws (873 D), allowed suicides a burial only on the boundaries between the twelve districts, meaning on a piece of land falling outside the ordered, social world.68 Archeological data reveal that the same opposition could already be found around 700 B.C. i n contemporary Eretrian graves, where a clear distinction existed between cremated adults and inhumed children and adolescents. This dis tinction must have corresponded with the social status of the deceased: only people with the proper civil status were cremated.69 This practice is not surprising for children. Nearly every where in the world the bodies of dead children have been disposed of i n a simple or often careless way.70 However,

this does not occur universally.71 Aristotle mentions that on the isle of Keos children were mourned for one year, and from the excavations it appears that great care was lavished on the young Eretrian dead, a care for which some Paleo lithic graves of young children are silent witnesses.72 Nor were children always inhumed. Especially in Athens and the surrounding districts there is much evidence for the cremation of children.73 The differences in practice suggest varying degrees of affection on the part of the parents or varying economic circumstances for the family. Some schol ars want to explain the inhumation of babies by the idea of rebirth;7*1 however, this is hardly probable. Since a simple inhumation without the accompanying idea of rebirth is often found, the idea of rebirth for ancient Greece cannot be inferred without direct statements from our sources.

ological evidence indicates that for children a proper funeral with all the accompanying rites was absent but that the body was properly disposed of.76 Dead children were treated similarly in ancient Rome. Children less than forty days old were buried in a niche in the wall of the house; they were not cremated unless they had reached the age when their teeth had come through.77 A special burial for the adolescent is much more surpris ing. Adolescents who died during their initiation were often buried in a secret way, and the same custom may once have existed in ancient Greece. In Ilion two maidens of the best families of Locri had to spend one year in the temple of Athena Ilias. During this period they were barefoot, their hair was cut short, they had only one dress to wear, and they had to keep the temple clean. Even though this ritual is not an initiation proper, its closest parallels are the puberty rituals, and it is most easily understood as a transformation of a former tribal initiation. When one of these maidens happened to die during the year she had to be buried in
Dajak, has stressed, the manner of disposal, whether cremation or burial, only forms part of a greater complex, and it has been the great mistake of Rohde and others to isolate one detail, an approach that does not at all do justice to the function of the funeral rites as a whole. 7 6 Plutarch Moralia 612 A, B states that according to the "ancestral and ancient usages and laws" funeral rites are absent for children. Unfortu nately, we do not know anything about the precise content or age of these laws, but it does not seem improbable that the usage goes back to the Archaic Age. 7 7 For Rome, see J. E .

secrecy. Does this special burial during the initiation explain the evidence for adolescent burial? The sources do not give a definite answer to this question but i n Rome too the ad olescent was buried i n the same way as the child.78 If children and adolescents are seen as people without a full place i n the community, it will not be surprising to find that their disposal strongly resembled those of slaves,79 It is true that, at least i n Athens, the master had the obligation to dispose of his dead slave ([Demosthenes] 43.58), but we hear of no funeral rites.80 This separation between free cit izens and slaves is also evident i n the treatment of those who had fallen at Marathon, where the slaves who had been released before the battle were not buried in the same grave as the free Athenians but together with the Plataeans (Pausanias 10.20.2). Moreover, they were buried and not cre mated, which was by far the cheaper method. Similarly, the Spartans buried their dead separately from the Helots after the battle at Plataea (Herodotus 9.85). And when we hear of released slaves and free men buried together on the Kerameikos (Pausanias 1.29.7), it is not certain that they were buried i n the same grave.81

THE SOUL OF T H E DEAD
Since one of the functions of the funeral rites was to help the transition of the soul into the afterlife, it may be rea sonably assumed that such a transition did not take place fully in the case of suicides, slaves, children, and adoles cents. Unfortunately we have no explicit data for the first two categories in the period under investigation, but it may well be that the refusal of Charon to ferry over the slave Xanthias i n Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs (190f.) is due to this idea about the slave's position after death.82 For chil dren and adolescents, however, there are clearer indications that their souls did not receive a normal status in the af terlife. There is widespread evidence that children, adolescents, and others who died an untimely death have a special status after death. Because of their abnormal death they have been thought to roam about as revenants, become vampires, or have an inferior position in an afterlife.83 In Africa those who die prematurely or violently, who aie killed in war, by accident or by their own hand, and those to whom a funeral has been denied are all considered to die an abnormal death. The same categories exist in Indonesia as i n Africa, but with the addition of those who have died of a particularly grave disease, and the unknown dead. In Western Europe the untimely dead also have a special status and have be come incorporated into the arme Seelen; and in modern Greece they become the vrikolakes, the revenants, although

enriched with the impious, bad mayors, and custom offi cers.84 There are some indications that the souls of those who ; died an untimely (ahöroi) or violent death (biaiothanatoi) in ancient Greece were supposed by some people, but cer tainly not all, to have had a different fate from those who had died a normal death.85 In the Archaic period, too, there are traces of such a separate fate. For the souls of children this is apparent from the traditions surrounding the Lesbian Gello, since she was supposed to have died in childhood and then to have become a ghost who frightened children.86 Gello is related to bogies such as Akko, Alphito (Plutarch

Moralia 1040 B), and Morrno, bogies, like masks (!), used by the Greeks, who of course did not yet have a Benjamin Spock, to frighten children.87 Following Von Sydow we may call these bogies "nets" because they do not belong to the world of adult belief.88 Rites, myths, and memorates con nected with them do not exist. They have been explained as spirits with a diminished status but there is no evidence for a former higher status, and it should be remembered that the situations which cause the mentioning of fictschildren being naughty or careless—always exist, even when there are no such spirits.89 It does seem, however, that Gello is not identical with these bogies since the content of her traditions—when and where we are able to reach a more precise idea about them, and it is only possible to do this from the Byzantine Age onwards—is much richer; a differ ent fate in a somewhat later period can most probably also be inferred from the remark of Er (Plato Republic 615 C) that "about those who had just been born and lived but a short time he related other things not worth mentioning." The special fate for the souls of adolescents is revealed in a passage in the Odyssey relating Odysseus' visit to the underworld. The first person to speak to Odysseus was El

penor, who was still unburied at the time. Since he had not yet been properly buried he still belonged to the special category of the abnormal dead, but before him Odysseus saw:
Brides and youths unwed, and old men of many and evil days, and tender maidens with grief yet fresh at heart; and many there were, wounded with bronze-shod spears, men slain in fight with their bloody mail about them90
The persons here enumerated, as has repeatedly been observed, exactly fit the categories of akoroi and biaiothanatoi.91 The only category we have not yet met are the old people, but they also belong to those who are often buried without any ritual.92 I n ancient Greece there existed tra ditions about a voluntary suicide of old people, a practice that points to the custom of eliminating the aged. This cus tom was once widespread outside and, probably, inside Eu rope,93 and the Greeks ascribed it to the Trogodytes (Diodorus Siculus 3.33.5), Tibarenoi (Porphyrius On Abstinence 4.21), Hyrcanians (ibidem), Scythians (ibidem), Heruli (Procopius The Gothic Wars 2.14), Bactrians (Onesikritus by Strabo 11.11.3) Sogdians (Plutarch Moralia 328 C), Der

bices (Strabo 11.11.8), and Massagetes (Herodotus 1.216; Strabo 11.8.6); in the case of the latter two peoples the killing was even coupled with endocannibalism, this too being a not uncommon practice.94 The historical truth of the matter cannot be ascertained and we must make allow ance for the tendency of the Greeks to ascribe to the peoples surrounding them a certain degree of primitive behavior to contrast them favorably with themselves.95 For Greece it self, these traditions all circle around the isle of Keos, but there are some legends collected in modern times on the mainland suggesting that this custom was once perhaps more widely practiced than appears from the historical sources.96 Since, then, these persons were the first to be met in the underworld by Odysseus, at one time they may have been believed to reside at the outskirts of the underworld without actually entering it, and so to form a special category of the dead with an infranormal status.97

Warriors, too, had a special fate in post-Homeric times. According to Heraclitus, "Gods and man honour those slain in battle" which "most probably alludes to a posthumous or eschatological reward by gods of those slain in battle."98 The warriors who fell at Marathon were worshipped as heroes, as were those who fell at Plataea.99 This heroization assured them a supranormal status in contrast with the infranormal one in the Odyssey (above). The warriors were not the only ones with a special fate. In ancient Greece there are other examples of ahöroi and biaiothanatoi being elevated to a higher status. The worship of the well-known heroes constitutes a different problem, even though they also often died an untimely death.100 Greek

mythology records a number of cases of people who were killed by lightning and, subsequently, honored as gods or heroes, although there are many other peoples who consider those killed by lightning as having an infranormal status.101 Near Epidaurus was the grave of the heroine Hyrnetho who was killed during a pregnancy (Pausanias 2.28.3). Near Arcadian Kaphyai was a temple of Artemis where each year offerings were burnt for children who according to the myth had been killed unjustly (Pausanias 8.23.7). The dead suit ors of Hippodameia were buried by Oenomaos without much ado but Pelops later made sacrifices to them as heroes (Pau sanias 6.21.9-11). In Lucanian Temesa, according to the legend, the in habitants had stoned to death one of Odysseus' sailors who had violated one of their virgins. Since Odysseus did not care for him—which must mean that he did not perform the proper funeral rites—the ghost of the sailor wandered and did not come to rest until after the people of Temesa had set apart an area of sacred ground for him and built a temple. Besides this they had to give him, each year, the most beautiful virgin. All this clearly implies an elevation to a higher plane for the dead sailor. The story is not yet finished, however; the ritual of sacrificing a virgin was stopped by the Olympian victor Euthymos who defeated the ghost of the hero i n a fight after which he, naturally, married the

girl (Pausanias 6.6.7-11). At the end of his life Euthymos simply disappeared and was worshipped as a hero. Here, too, the abnormal death is clearly connected with heroization.102 With Euthymos we have reached more historical times. Here the best example is Kleomedes. This great athlete caused the death of a number of children in his town of Astypalaea. Because the Astypalaeans were trying to catch him, he hid in a chest in the temple of Athena; when the chest was finally opened no one was found, and Kleomedes was subsequently honored as a hero.103 Not only did the absence of a body cause such an honor. The inhabitants of Amathus had to sacrifice to Onesilus as a hero after a bee swarm had settled in his skull, which they had hung up at the gates (Herodotus 5.114); and in Cyprus, during a fam ine, the gods ordered the inhabitants of Kition to pay honor to Cimon who, according to some, had died of wounds dur ing the siege of that town (Plutarch Cimon 19). Is not the most plausible explanation in these last two cases also, that something about their death caused these unnatural things to happen?104 A supranormal status, then, for the abnormal dead is not

uncommon. Hertz had already noted the ambiguous posi tion of the abnormal dead and observed that they became either elect or damned.105 To judge from the literary and archeological evidence it seems, however, that in the period under investigation deceased children and adolescents usu ally received an infranorrnal status and consequently were not normally given the full funeral rites accorded the normal dead and were thought to remain as souls outside or at the outskirts of the world of the dead.
A Return of the Dead?
In the Archaic period revenants and ghosts are virtually unheard of, although somewhat later Plato (Phaedrus 81 C, D) mentions the existence of ghosts wandering around tombs and graveyards.106 The reason for this near-absence may be due to the fragmentary state of our sources, but one cannot exclude the possibility that the belief in ghosts was stronger on the mainland than i n Ionia and the Greek islands, the area from which the greater part of our earliest sources derive. In these areas emigration from the mainland may well have had a diminishing influence on the role ascribed to ancestors and, consequently, to ghosts.107

Considering this near-absence of testimonia, we will re strict ourselves to a discussion of the problem of whether the Archaic Age Greeks believed ghosts appeared during the Athenian festival of the Anthesteria. Since this festival was common to Athens and the Ionians, it must reach back into the period before the Ionian emigration. Some scholars have thought that the proverb "Out of the door, you Kares, the Anthesteria are over" (Zenobius 4.33) originated to ex pel the spirits of the dead, who appeared within the city during the celebrations. Although in some societies the topsy turvy nature of ceremonies like the Anthesteria is associated with a return of the dead, this festival recalled for its par ticipants, among other events, the threat of strangers who could destroy the social fabric. The proverb expressed this fear.108 The festival took place i n the spring on the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth days of the month Anthesterion; it was dedicated to Dionysos and received its name from the flowering of the vine tendrils. On the first day, the Pithoigia, or "Jar-opening,'1 the Athenians brought their new wine to the sanctuary of Dionysos of the Marshes where they mixed it with water, poured a libation to the gods, and took their first taste. After the grape harvest in the late summer the grape juice had been stored i n earthenware jars for the fermenting process and the jars had been left unopened. In Greece wine mixed with water was the main drink of Greek males (wine was often forbidden to females) and

drinking wine played an important role in the most impor tant gathering of Greek males, the symposium.109 The Greeks even distinguished between themselves and neighboring peoples by ascribing to the neighbors the drinking of water or unmixed wine—the opposite of drinking mixed w i n e . 1 1 0 Given the importance of wine for their way of life the Greeks must have anxiously awaited the day of the Pithoigia, and once the jars were opened they could relax and happily enjoy the wine. Such a relaxation also occurred after the harvest had changed a period of scarcity into one of plenty, and there is a large amount of ethnological evidence dem onstrating that this relaxation, which usually manifested itself during first-fruit festivals, found expression i n the con sumption of large amounts of food and drink, and i n a gen eral suspension of the normal rules of society. Similarly in Western Europe, new wine was often consumed in large quantities on St. Martin's Day, a day which was i n addition the scene of rites of reversal and the carrying of masks.111 This suspension of the normal social order is also perfectly illustrated by the second and central day of the festival called

Choes, or "Wine-jugs." It was considered an uncanny day; all the temples were closed with ropes, except for the sanc tuary of Dionysos of the Marshes that was closed for the rest of the year. This meant that no oaths could be wit nessed, no business transactions completed, no wedding ceremonies performed.112 It was in agreement with the topsy turvy character of the feast that the priestesses of Dionysos' temple, the Gerarai, were probably older women in whom males normally had lost all interest.313 Free men and slaves participated in the festival equally, and on that day even a misanthrope would feel obliged to dine with at least one other person.114 Yet, "anarchy" was not total since the pro hibition of wine for women was not lifted; it remained strictly the privilege of the Athenian males.115 The day started with the chewing of leaves of the buck- . thorn, a rather unappetizing plant, reputed to be good for ! warding off apparitions (phantasmata).116 The scholars, who j see the festival as a time when ghosts appear, always men tion this quality of the plant, but in that case it is less clear why it was chewed only in the morning, whereas the ghosts supposedly roamed the city for the whole day.

aration for the great meal to come. Similarly, during firstfruit festivals elsewhere i n the world, people started the day by swallowing bitter concoctions i n order to purify them selves before they tasted the new food.117 I n the late after noon the Athenians gathered for a banquet and drinking bout that was organized in such a way as to make it the exact opposite of a normal banquet. The guests brought their own food, except for the dessert, and the wine i n their own jug; they were seated at separate tables instead of shar ing couches. After a trumpet had given the starting sign each banqueteer tried to empty his j u g as fast as possible, which must have been quite a feat, since a j u g contained about three liters of wine! The drinking took place in com plete silence, another contrast to the convivial nature of the symposium. The silence has been interpreted as a sign of "communitas," a term introduced by Victor Turner for the bond that can originate in a liminal situation when the normal rules of society are absent, but society is not totally atomized.118 Silence, like laughter, is a subject that has not yet received the attention it deserves, and "communitas" can sometimes be a helpful concept for its interpretation but not in this particular case.119 According to Turner, the bonds of "com

munitas" are "undifferentiated, egalitarian, direct, extant, nonrational, existential, I-Thou (in Buber's sense)."120 It is hard to recognize those qualities in a group of Athenians trying to gulp down their wine as fast as possible. The Athenians explained the strange nature of this drink ing party by the arrival of Orestes in Athens on the eve of the Anthesteria before his purification from the murder of his mother Clytemnestra. The Athenian king feared that Orestes would pollute the other guests at the festival i f he participated, but did not want to be inhospitable, and or dered therefore that all the temples should be closed and that all the guests should drink their wine at separate tables. In this way Orestes could still participate i n the feast but would not contaminate the other guests. The myth explains the ritual by focusing on a marginal stranger; the same theme is also apparent in other myths connected with the festival. A Greek proverb from the period also presents the theme of the marginal stranger: "Out of the door, you Kares, the Anthesteria are over" (Zenobius 4.33). Unfortunately, there is no certainty about the origin of the saying; in Greek it constitutes an iambic trimeter, and it seems reasonable therefore to assume that it derives from a comedy. However, whether the comedy adopted a ritual saying from the An thesteria or whether the trimeter was afterwards introduced in some way into or connected with the festival seems equally possible. According to tradition the proverb was repeated whenever people became obtrusive and tried repeatedly to take liberties that had been permitted on only one occa sion.121 Tradition recounted that it was either originally said

to Carian slaves who had not yet gone back to work after the festival was over or to Carians who had been invited to Athens ony for the time of the festival. The proverb is nor mally quoted as reading "Kares," but some sources add that there existed a variant reading "Keres": "as if the souls went through the city during the Anthesteria." It is hardly sur prising that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen turies when scholars saw souls of the dead everywhere the latter reading was pronounced to be the original one and the Keres interpreted as "souls of the dead," since a visit of ancestors had been abundantly demonstrated for "primi tive" and Indo-European peoples.122 More recently, how ever, it has been demonstrated that the reading "Kares" is certainly as old as "Keres," i f not older, and there is now near unanimity that the evidence for a meaning "souls of the dead" for "Keres" is too slight to be accepted;123 the mention of these souls may well have been caused by a misinterpretation of the word "Keres" by a later scholar. Despite this philological objection, some scholars still try to save the interpretation of "souls of the dead" for "Keres."124

It has been argued that the Greeks, being not as courteous as the Slavs who treated the returning souls well, applied the word "Keres," or "demons of death," to the souls, but this solution is hardly convincing.125 Neither is the sugges tion that the Keres are the destructive spirits of the crops and fields; there is no evidence to support this contention, just as there is no evidence that the Keres were spooks.126 No convincing arguments, therefore, have hitherto been adduced i n support of a connection of the Keres with the souls of the dead. Much more convincing is Burkert's discussion of the an cient explanations of the reading Kares. The first expla nation—the Carians were slaves who feasted and did not work—must derive, Burkert argues, from the circumstance that slaves were allowed to join in the drinking and feasting on the Choes. The other explanation runs as follows: "Once the Carians were masters of a part of Attica and when the Athenians celebrated the Anthesteria, they concluded a treaty with them and received them into the city and their homes. When after the festival some Carians were left behind in Athens, whoever met them said jokingly: "Out of the door
suggesting that the Keres, or "spooks" and Kares or "primeval inhabitants" are in fact identical but were called Kares in Attica. The difference would have been caused by an old declension *Ker, *Karos, which developed differently in various dialects: in Attica it became Kares, in Ionia Keres. However, it seems that this ingenious solution of an old declension can be rejected on linguistic grounds, and our sources give no support for a dialectic variation, see R.S.P.

you-Kares ['Carians'], the Anthesteria are over" (Zenobius 4.33). Burkert compares this explanation with a report of the Anthesteria in Marseilles.127 On that day the gates were closed and the city acted as i f it were at war. This was because, it was said, a few years after the foundation of the city the Ligurian king Comanus wanted to surprise the city on the Anthesteria by smuggling into it soldiers on wag ons—probably the wagons with the casks of new wine as Burkert persuasively suggests—which were entering the city on that day. The conspiracy was detected because a Ligurian girl told the plan to her Greek lover and the in vaders were caught and killed, as were the king and seven thousand of his men (Justinus 43.4.6). Both explanations of the customs during the Anthesteria show a structural resemblance. On a certain day strange men, the primeval inhabitants, are allowed to enter the city. When their time is over, they have to leave again. This belief finds it proper place, as Burkert has seen, i n the customs associated with the wearing of masks as it could still be observed i n this century in remote valleys of the Swiss Alps, where at certain times of the year—usually around the New Year—masked men would enter the houses and request to be entertained, a request that could not be refused. Here, too, though, Burkert tries to harmonize "Kares" and "Keres" by explaining that the respect shown to the intruders de rived from the idea that the intruders are the ancestors or former inhabitants of the country.128

A different approach seems preferable. Mourning periods as well as the periods marking the transition from the old to the new year and from abundance to Lent are liminal periods, periods between an old situation and a new one. One of the characteristics of these periods is a reversal of status; prominence is given to people who, i n normal cir cumstances, fall into the interstices of social structures, live at the margin of society, or are looked upon as the scum of the earth, as Victor Turner has shown in a number of stud ies.1 2 9 This prominence will have been the reason for the "CariarT explanation, since the Kares lived, according to the legend, at the margin of Athenian society. During the Anthesteria, though, they were allowed into the city in order to play their special role at the festival. Besides the visits of these marginals, the liminal periods also know the intrusion of supernatural beings, like the manes during the Roman Lemuria, the elves on May Day, or the witches during Walpurgis n i g h t ; 1 3 0 the Keres as demons of death fit into these times as well. For this reason the Keres do not need to be identified with the souls of the dead; from a structural point of view Kares, Keres, elves, and witches are all represent atives of a demonic, nonsocial, and unstructured world who
important people among "primitive'' peoples. Here is one of those typical reductionist assumptions that can occasionally be found in the work of Meuli, whose whole scientific opus circled round the customs associated with the deaths of men and animals. The weak point is that Meuli's ex planation does not make clear how and why this transference from a mourning custom to a calendrical rite occurred, and why the transference did not go the other way around. 1 2 9 See especially the following studies: The Forest of Symbols (London 1967) 93-111; The Ritual Process (London 1969); Dramas, Fields and Metaphors (Ithaca and London 1974); "Process, System and Symbol: New Anthropological Synthesis," Daedalus 1977, no. 3, 61-80; Process, Performance and Pilgrimage (New Delhi 1979).

are absent in normal times.131 Although the historical re• lation between the readings "Kares" and "Keres" remains I
uncertain, they are structurally equivalent i n this particular case, since both are entities that are normally absent from the world of the free Athenians. When the normal structure of society is broken up, the situation becomes potentially dangerous, and people begin to feel insecure. This accounts for the special behavior i n Marseilles during the Anthesteria. The festival's aetiological legend and the ritual have a striking parallel in modern Swiss tradition that seems not to have yet been noticed. In a number of Swiss cities it was related that long ago the city was almost surprised by soldiers whom the enemy tried to smuggle into the city in casks or barrels. Fortunately, they were detected by children or by a stroke of luck and the attack was foiled. Since then the night watchman has to go around on that particular evening with his familiar warnings, and a special cry connected with the detection of the enemy. These "murdernights" (Mordnachte) were all supposed to have happened—and consequently were re membered—on days in typically liminal periods such as the days in the middle of November, around Christmas, or Shrove Tuesday.132 The seemingly ancient legends were obviously reinforced by the fact that these liminal periods in the cal endar were indeed often occasions for revolution and re bellion.133

So, with Burkert we see in the "Carian" reading of the proverb a reflection of a custom in which persons who are perhaps masked enter the houses and ask to be feasted. The proverbial application of the saying to obtrusive people can be best accounted for by this explanation. Finally, it should be noted that this explanation presupposes the entering of real people, whereas Rohde and other scholars still thought of imaginary visitors.134 It is unknown when the saying was
passim. Hans Georg Wackernagel (1895-1967), son of the great philologist Jacob Wackernagel, grandson of the well-known Germanic scholar Wilhelm Wackernagel, a friend of the late Karl Meuli (see F. Jung in Meuli, Gesammelte Sckriften, 2: 1164, 1201 n. 3), collected in Altes Volkstum most of his studies on ancient Swiss history. These are of great importance for the history of the relation between festival and revolution, and for the history of the place of the young men in society, but during his lifetime they did not gain him the recognition he deserved, and they are unduly neglected in present discussions. A full bibliography of Wackernagel's writings has been published by T. Buhler, Basher Zeitschrift fur Geschichte una Altertumskunde 68 (1968) 237-245. In this context I would like to thank Dr. iur.

pronounced during the festival, but it may well have been after the drinking bout was over, for after the match the jugs and the symposium wreaths were brought to Dionysos' sanctuary. Aristophanes' Frogs (211-19) went "rambling in drunken revelry," and their behavior may well have been typical for the average Athenian. It had been a happy day, and it must have been happy memories that made Themistocles celebrate the Choes in exile, just as the Athenian Pollis did not forget the festival in faraway Egypt, and the philosopher Xenocrates showed his prowess in drinking at the Choes at the Sicilian court of Dionysius.135 The return to the normal structure of society took place on the last day of the festival called Chytroi, or "Pots," from the panspermia, a dish consisting of all kinds of grain, boiled in an earthen pot and sweetened with honey.136 It was the major food of the Choes, and in keeping with the character of that day it was not prepared in the customary way; it made no use of the normal cooking techniques of milling and baking.137 During the Chytroi the celebrants remem

For Xenokrates, see Diogenes Laertius 4.8; it is tempting to think that this Sicilian drinking bout was organized for, or perhaps by, Plato during his stay at Dionysius1 court. This "happy" evidence has been insufficiendy taken into account by those scholars who believe in a return of the dead during the Anthesteria. For example, Versnel, "Destruction, Devotio and Despair," 590f. tells us that the dead "were regaled in awe and terror," but this is pure fiction; our sources say nothing of the sort. Neither do we know that in Athens the deluge (below) was connected with "the unspeakable crimes of murder and cannibalism"; the Athenian Flood legend is virtually unknown. M. P. Nilsson, Eranos 15 (1915) 182, reprinted in his Opuscula, vol. 1 (Lund 1951) 147, already warned against these somber pictures. 1 3 6 The hieros gamos, which was probably celebrated at the end of the Choes, may have been another sign of the return to the normal social order, see Versnel, "Destruction, Devotio and Despair," 589, 591. 1 3 7 A similar technological regression took place in Eretria during the Thesmophoria, when the women did not fry the meat but dried it in the sun; the Thesmophoria were also a festival that changed the normal cul

bered the survivors of the mythological Flood as having eaten this special dish as their first food. It is noteworthy that the survivors were not supposed to have eaten their food prepared in the normal Greek manner—similarly, the survivors of the Flood in Argos ate wild pears—but in a more primitive way: the transition from the chaos of the Flood into an ordered society had to happen gradually, as so often i n important transitions.138 The Flood was associated with the social chaos of the Choes on the mythological level, and the restoration of the social order on the Chytroi is therefore appropriately con nected with the survivors of the Flood.139 In Greece, as elsewhere, the Flood was often thought to have preceded the origin or foundation of important constituents of the cosmic and social order, such as the course of the sun, sacrifice, the founding of a city, and, interesting in con nection with our festival, even the mixing of wine: one of the inventors of mixed wine was Amphictyon, the son of Deucalion.140 The emergence of an ordered society also ex pressed itself in the celebration of games on this day; sim ilarly, in aristocratic milieus mourning periods came to an end with games—like the funerary games for Patroclusin which the males once again could demonstrate their prowess and skill after a period of inactivity.141 In the games

on the Chytroi the young men played an important role, as was suitable; the new order was exemplified by the prom inence of the new generation. Not only the new generation of males was active, though; the maidens too had their festival, the Aiora, and the connection of the feast with the general theme of the Anthesteria was illustrated by one of the aetiological myths of that festival telling of the horrors of drinking unmixed wine.142 There is one other festival that should be mentioned in connection with the theme of the return of the dead. In Thessaly the main festival was called Peloria, which was characterized by great dinners, temporary freeing of pris oners, the invitation of strangers, and a status reversal of masters and slaves; like the Anthesteria, this festival was also connected with a Flood legend.143 Meuli has connected the name of the festival, Peloria, with the adjective pelorios,

meaning "monstrous, huge, terrible," and suggests that the etymology of the name points to the impressive ancestors; Nilsson, too, associated the name of the festival with the giants of the hoary past but these giants are not necessarily ancestors.144 I n the time of our source Baton, the third cen tury B.C., the name was evidently connected with the epithet Pelor for Zeus,145 and our source does not mention any visit by ancestors nor the wearing of masks which could be in terpreted (as Meuli does) as ancestors. It is possible that in earlier times the Thessalians believed in a visit of the ances tors, but this has to remain a matter of conjecture. It seems certain that, so far, it has not been convincingly proved that the Greeks in historical times beheved in a periodic return of the dead.
Conclusion *
What was the early Greek concept of the soul of the dead? When we survey our material it is not difficult to draw a conclusion. The Greeks, like many other peoples, consid ered the soul of the dead to be a continuation of the free soul of the living. However, psyche was not the only man ifestation of the deceased. The individual could also be rep resented as the body itself, as eidolon, snake, and, perhaps, butterfly. In the transitional state between its stay in the body and in the afterlife the soul was thought to remain in the vicinity of the body where it is sometimes represented as a homonculus. As particularly indicated by the funeral rites of the period persons who died abnormally were con sidered to occupy an infranormal or supranormal status in

the life hereafter. Ghosts are as good as absent during the Archaic period and the saying "Out of the door, you Kares/ Keres, the Anthesteria are over" cannot be adduced as evi dence for the return of the dead. Unfortunately, the frag mentary state of the sources does not yet allow us to estab lish the mutual relation of the manifestations of the deceased. Were there perhaps occasions on which the deceased was only represented as a snake or only as eidolon? Here, there still remain questions that cannot as yet (if ever) be an swered. When we compare the soul of the living with the soul of the dead, we are struck by the negative way the souls of the dead are characterized. On the whole they are witless shades who lack precisely those qualities that make up an individual. This characterization corresponds with the type of society in which this particular collective attitude toward the dead developed. Homeric beliefs reflect the life of the small, closely knit communities of the Dark Ages where the life of the community was more important than the survival of the individual. In these communities death was not yet so much the end of one person's life but rather an episode in the history of the community and the life cycle. However, the sweeping changes in Greek society in the eighth century and after promoted an individualization that created indi vidual concern for death and survival. In the new constel lation the representation of the dead as witless shades lost much of its influence but it never disappeared completely.146

Appendix One
The Soul of Plants and Animals
M O D E R N U R B A N C U L T U R E has removed most of us so far from the world of nature that the attribution by many peoples of a soul to plants or animals comes as a surprise. Yet, in North Eurasia a few tribes ascribed a life soul to plants.1 I n Melanesia, as in North America, plants were even thought to have a free soul, although understandably there was no suggestion that plants could dream or swoon.2 I n the Archaic period such a belief is not explicitly mentioned, but Pythagoras thought that in the chain of reincarnations the psyche also entered plants.3 The same belief was es poused by Empedocles who specifically forbade the chew ing of laurel leaves, since he regarded the laurel as the highest form of plant incarnations, and even claimed to have been a bush himself in a previous existence.4 A similar belief also existed among the Manichaeans, whose doctrines of metempsychosis had been influenced by Indian represen tations. The relevant evidence of Augustine, which once

used to be doubted, has now been confirmed by the newly discovered Cologne Mani Codex, in which a palm tree threat ens revenge, and vegetables weep and cry with human voices.5 The documentation is much richer on a soul for animals. In Melanesia a free soul has been attributed to animals, although since this particular soul, like the soul of plants, was not mentioned as leaving the body during dreams, it must be only partially similar to the human free soul.6 In North America there is a proper dualistic soul belief; in some areas the inhabitants have even thought that animals pos sess an ego soul. It remains obscure, however, exactly which animals are thought to have such a soul.7 On this point our North Eurasian evidence is much more informative, since it appears that here domestic animals, especially the horse and the ox, were believed to possess a surviving free soul.8 A comparison of the animal soul with the human soul reveals that for the early Greeks the two souls had much in common, the main points of distinction being the absence of the noos and the absence of any mention of the psyche going to Hades.9 Yet unlike the soul concept of other areas of the world, the Greek concept of the animal soul is no ticeable for the near-absence of the free soul. The psyche is mentioned only once in Homer. After Eumaios had killed a swine for Odysseus, "the psyche left i t "

(14.426). However, no mention is made of this psyche going to Hades. Since this was not always mentioned in the case of the human psyche either, this absence does not neces sarily indicate that the animal soul was not believed to go to Hades; we just do not know. There are, though, reasons to assume, as presented below, that the animal free soul was not believed to go to Hades. After Homer, the only animal that is said to possess a psyche in Archaic poetry is the snake. Hesiod describes the sloughing of a snake's skin with the words "Only the psyche remains," and Pindar men tions the psyche twice in the case of the death of a snake. The attribution of a psyche to the snake may well have been influenced by the snake's uncommon power of renewing its skin.10 Many animals are said to possess a thymos. It is ascribed to oxen (XIII.704; 3.455), swine (xn.150; xvn.22), horses (xvi.468; xvn.451), wolves and lambs (xxn.263), a hare (xvn.678), and a bird (xxm.880). In the majority of these cases the thymos is mentioned at the moment of dying, but in such descriptions there is no differentiation between the death of animals and the death of man. A noos is not ascribed to animals. Only once is the verb noein, "to perceive," con nected with an animal—when the dog Argus perceives Odysseus (17.301)—but from this passage we can hardly infer that animals were believed to possess a noos. A menos is ascribed to a panther and a lion (xvn.20), a wild boar (xvii.21), horses (xvn.451, 456, 476; xxm.468), mules (xvu. 742) and an ox (3.450). Ego potencies were also as cribed to animals. Fawns (iv.245) and wolves (xvi. 157) had

The near-absence of the animal free soul i n early Greece has been explained by an indifference to the continued ex istence of animals after death.11 Such an explanation does not, however, explain why the Greeks were indifferent in the first place. The reason for this lack of interest may well have been lack of a connection between hunting and the animal free soul such has been established for North Eur asia. The animal most often mentioned for that area as hav ing a free soul is the bear.12 It was the biggest game that hunters could hope for and around its killing an elaborate ritual developed, i n which the hunters dissimulated their responsibility for the k i l l i n g . 1 3 It was particularly important that the bones of the game remained undamaged, since the damage would reflect on the free soul of the animal. This care for the bones, and indirecdy for the free soul, cannot be separated from the idea of the rebirth of the killed game.14
Among a number of peoples there exists a close connec tion between the animal free soul and a protector of all animals or sometimes those of a certain species. When the animal is killed, the free soul goes to the protector, who then insures the rebirth of the animal. The existence of the idea of such a protector, the Lord or Lady of the Animals, has

been demonstrated for America, Africa, Asia, and the an cient Near East.15 The idea was even alive until this century i n Western Europe.16 I n ancient Greece Artemis had de veloped from such a Lady of the Animals.17 As long as the hunting tribes kept their faith in the protector they were careful to avoid overkilling the game, since they believed they would incur the wrath of the god i f they did not. Once missionaries or secularization eroded this faith the equilib rium between men and animals was disturbed, and the damage done affected both the animals and human society.

the fur trade on the Indians of Eastern Canada. Throughout this area widespread secularization occurred following white contact and the hunters started to kill the game indiscrim inately, whereas before they often preferred to live on the brink of famine rather than to kill too many animals. Once the sanctions against overkilling were gone, the way was opened to a more convenient life style, but the consequences of this new way of living, alcoholism, and venereal diseases, exerted a devastating effect on the traditional Indian cul ture.18 Since hunters believed that the free soul returned to the protector of the animals, it is clear that the idea of an animal free soul functioned in a specific context, in a world where the rebirth of the killed game was anxiously expected. It may well be that here we find a key to the paucity of data about an animal free soul i n ancient Greece. The Greeks were well aware that they were living in the era of agri culture and that they had left behind them the times when they had been hunters.19 Consequently they may not have been particularly interested any longer i n the continued existence of the animal free soul. In post-Homeric times the doctrine of metempsychosis again ascribed a psyche to the animals and created the word empsychon, or 'That in which there is a psyché" to denote living beings.20 Empedocles considered that sacrificial slaughter was murder, and in his writings the human souls of the sacrificial victims protested against being killed,21 but

Pythagoras, according to Iamblichus (Life of Pythagoras 85), denied a human soul to sacrificial animals. When Aristoxenos mentions that Pythagoras only refused to eat the ploughing ox and the ram, the implication seems to be that he ascribed a soul only to these animals.22 Unfortunately, the fragmentary state of our sources does not permit an investigation of whether this is a revival of an older belief in which, as in North Eurasia, a free soul was ascribed to domestic animals.

Appendix Two
The Wandering Soul in Western European Folk Tradition
A N I N V E S T I G A T I O N into Old Saxon and Old High Ger man literature clearly shows that in the early Middle Ages the dualistic concept of the soul still existed in Western Europe.1 This concept expressed itself in many versions of one type of folktale, in which the soul leaves the body in the shape of a small animal or homunculus and later returns to it. Versions of this tale have been recorded since the eighth century A.D. until modern times, especially from the more remote and rural areas of Western Europe. This strongly suggests that in these areas the dualistic concept of the soul continued to exist, whereas the cities and the élite had a unitary concept of the soul. I shall give two examples that are not mentioned in the authoritative survey of this type of folktale.2 The Danish folklorist Feilberg has recorded the following story;3 it is a good illustration of the motif involved and the themes that sometimes become attached to it.
Once, in the haytime, some people went to sleep in the afternoon

in a heap of grass. Among them was a girl who had a strange dream. At a short distance a man with a spade was grubbing about near a brook. Suddenly a tiny white mouse appeared which wanted to cross the litde watercourse and was very distressed because it could not find a place to ford. When the man saw how confused the mouse was he laid his spade across the watercourse and the mouse forded it. He realised that he had never seen such a beau tiful tiny mouse, so he followed and observed it. Near a big stone the mouse crept down and remained hidden for some time; it then returned and went back to the brook along the route it had come. The man put down the spade by which the mouse had crossed, and followed the mouse until it reached a heap of grass. There it vanished, but it seemed to the man that it had slipped into the mouth of the girl who lay sleeping there. At the same moment the girl woke up and said: "Oh, what a strange dream I had. I thought I came into a forest which seemed to have no end until I reached a big river. I could not find a crossing but at last I came to a strange, peculiar bridge, the first part of which was made of iron and the rest of wood. Here I crossed safely and then I reached a big, grey stone castle which I entered through a very small door. There was no one to be seen, but gold and silver lay about in large amounts. After inspecting all the rooms I went back home and returned by the same bridge which now lay the other way round." The man told the girl what he had seen and both agreed that the treasure must have some meaning. They lifted the stone and found so much silver and gold that they were never poor again.
This Danish folktale clearly shows how, during sleep, the soul represents its owner; the girl dreams what the mouse performs. It also shows two other motifs that frequently occur in this type of folktale: the crossing of water by the soul and the finding of treasure.4

THE WANDERING SOUL
The same motif occurs in a Dutch tale.5
Over a hundred years ago a farmer lived with his two daughters on a farmstead called Blijendaal, in the immediate neighborhood of St. Annaland. The girls were no beauties but a country lad from Brabant, Jan Marinusse, was courting one of the girls. One Sat urday night about 8 o'clock he went to the farm to woo the girl. When they had been sitting for a while in a room the girl became so sleepy that the boy said "Just lean on my shoulder." So she did and soon she fell asleep. Suddenly he saw a bumble-bee creeping out of her mouth and flying away. He became worried and thought his girlfriend was a witch. He therefore took his handkerchief and spread it over her face. After she had been sleeping for twenty minutes the bee returned. The girl then became so short of breath that she got blue in the face, and the boy, afraid that she would suffocate, took the handkerchief off her face. Immediately the bee crept into her mouth, disappeared into her body, and she awoke.
The oldest example of this type of folktale occurs in Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards (3.34), where the Frankish king Guntram has an experience very similar to that of the Danish girl; in Guntram's case the event is even supported by the "fact" that he donated to the grave of the martyr St. Marcellus a canopy adorned with precious gems from the discovered treasure. The literary form of the tale strongly suggests that the eighth-century historian adapted an oral version,6 but this is naturally very difficult to prove. The authoritative survey of the tale found only a few me dieval parallels, all of which were clearly inspired by Paul, as are many of the others that can be found in increasing numbers since the sixteenth century.7 Yet, despite this re sult, it seems certain from a source that the authoritative
5 J.R.W. Sinninghe and M. Sinninghe, Zeeuwsch Sagenboek (Zutphen, Holland 1933) 118f I have quoted only the first part of the tale as Jan's further adventures are not relevant here. 6 So Lixfeld, "Die Guntramsage," 86. 7 Lixfeld, ibidem, 65ff.

THE WANDERING SOUL
survey did not consider that oral versions were widely cur rent in the Middle Ages. Oral traditions are on the whole ignored by medieval sources. It is only very recendy that medievalists have started to interest themselves in the oral culture of the nonliterate classes. By using hagiographical sources, exemvla, and rec ords of the Inquisition, imaginative historians are increas ingly successful in lifting at least a tip of the veil that covers the world of the subordinate classes.8 The most successful of these recent investigations centers on Vatican records for the village of Montaillou in the Pyrenees where the Inqui sition interrogated all the inhabitants in its crusade against the Cathars around 1300. In these records we find an oral version with anonymous characters and without discovery of the treasure.9 The occurrence of the tale in such a remote part of Western Europe suggests that oral versions must have been much more widespread than our written sources would lead us to believe. Admittedly, this example does not constitute proof that Paul the Deacon did adapt an oral version, but it certainly shows that oral versions independ ent from Paul the Deacon's example were current during the Middle Ages.
In Western Europe, then, we can trace the endurance of the concept of the free soul. It may well be that we would have found the same i n the more remote areas of ancient Greece, if only more sources had been available.
