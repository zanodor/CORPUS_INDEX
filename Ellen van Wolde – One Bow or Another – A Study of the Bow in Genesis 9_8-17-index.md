Abstract
Because Gen. 9:8-17 uses the word qĕšĕt in relation to the deity and to the clouds, the inference has been made in biblical scholarship that the text refers to a rainbow. The plausibility of this inference is tested in this article. Attention is given to the various linguistic aspects of this word in the Hebrew Bible and to the specifijic textual composition of Gen. 9:8-17 as well as to the broader ancient Near Eastern framework established by comparative literary and iconographic evidence. The conclusion is reached that the word qĕšĕt designates in Gen. 9:8-17 a warrior’s bow which represents both the deity’s might and power as well as his willingness to transfer his power over the earth to those living on it.

The positive appreciation of the rainbow may well be based on its colourful appearance in the sky, but is as often grounded on the view that it is a sign of God’s covenant with or protection of the earth. The latter idea is carved in our brains as the result of long Jewish and Christian reading traditions of Genesis 9:8-17. Thus one can fijind on the internet an astonishing number of religious websites with rainbow references that all take their starting point in Genesis 9. This article’s intention is to examine the plausibility of this long-held rainbow interpretation. In order to reach this goal, attention will be given to specifijic linguistic and textual aspects of usage of the word qĕšĕt in this text and in the Hebrew Bible, and in relevant literary and iconographic ancient Near Eastern

sources.1 Thus, in the end, I will be able to reach a conclusion about the meaning of qĕšĕt in Genesis 9:8-17.
The Word qĕšĕt in Genesis 9:8-17: a Rainbow?
The word qĕšĕt is generally understood to designate a rainbow in Gen. 9:8-17.2 Textual arguments provided to support the rainbow option are (1) God sets the bow in the clouds in v. 13, (2) the bow appears in the clouds in v. 14, and (3) God sees the bow in the clouds in v. 16. Intertextual support for this view is found in Ezek. 1:28, where the bow is said to shine in the clouds on a day of rain, and in Ben Sira 43:12-13 and 50:7 where the Greek word toxon ‘rainbow’ functions analogously to the word qĕšĕt in Ezek. 1:28. According to this view this word expresses the notions of [arc], [colours], and [sky],3 while including the notions of [sunshine] and [rain]; it fijigures in the cognitive domain of [meteorology].4
1) Since every investigation is influenced by the applied method of analysis, it should be mentioned that cognitive linguistics stands behind the research presented here. The theory and method are adapted from Ronald Langacker, Foundations of Cognitive Grammar (2 vols; 1987, 1991) and elaborated and applied to biblical concepts and texts in more detail in Ellen van Wolde, Reframing Biblical Studies: When Language and Text Meet Culture, Cognition and Context (2009). The goal of a cognitive linguistic approach is to study meaning embedded in language, culture, and cognition by exploiting verifijiable semantic methods for the analysis of linguistic expressions. In contrast to other, non-cognitive types of semantic research which is lexicographically (language-internally) oriented, cognitive linguistics examines words, concepts, and texts (1) as embedded in cognition, that is to say, in semantic relationships (i.e. language-internally), in cognitive confijigurations (i.e. fijiguring in experiential, conceptual, and social routines) and in metonymical and metaphorical networks of meaning; (2) in relation to the world views and cultural categories of the times in which they functioned; (3) in relation to the communicative contexts of use. These basic tenets explain why cognitive linguistics cannot accept a dictionary-view of meaning, but takes an essentially encyclopaedic view of meaning in which even the meaning of common, everyday terms is seen as supported by a vast network of interrelated knowledge. The cultural concerns of cognitive linguistics are obvious: the study of dictionary and encyclopaedia as closely related phenomena is, in fact, a study of the rich repository of cultural knowledge. 2) See BDB (906), HALOT (III: 1155); NIDOTTE (III: 1004); TWAT (VII: 223); Jacob (1934/74: 255); Cassuto (1964: 136); Westermann (1974: 632-635); Hamilton (1990: 317). See also Fabry (1993, in TWAT VII) for a description of the long tradition of Judaic and Christian interpretations in which the word qĕšĕt in Gen. 9:12-17 is understood as a rainbow. 3) Conceptual contents are conventionally expressed by terms in small capital letters in between square brackets. 4) In cognitive terminology, the word ‘rainbow’ profijiles the conceptual entities of [arc], [sky] and [colours]; this is called its ‘profijile’. At the same time, the word ‘rainbow’ cannot be

Since Julius Wellhausen many scholars have wondered about the word’s meaning as ‘rainbow’. The reason for doubt is the fact that out of its 76 occurrences in the Hebrew Bible, the word qĕšĕt 72 times designates unequivocally a warrior’s bow (or, rarely, a hunter’s bow). De Boer (1974/1991: 134) also poses another pressing question, namely why the Hebrew Bible does not have a distinctive term for a rainbow, and he suggests that it is because rainbows in the ancient Near East, or in the present day Middle East, occur very rarely. Bioclimatically Israel is divided into three zones: a subhumid zone with an annual rainfall of between 1000-400 mm, a semiarid zone in which the annual rainfall ranges between 400 and 200 mm, and an arid zone with 200-25 mm of rain.5 Assuming that many biblical texts were formed, edited and transmitted in the semiarid zone of ancient Israel, the low annual rainfall would indeed explain the rarity of the meteorological phenomenon of a rainbow. Israel’s geographical latitude of 31o30 ́ N, in which the sun is positioned high in the sky, would also account for the fact that a rainbow is seldom perceivable. Does the rarity of the appearance of a rainbow in (ancient) Israel and in the Near East provide a plausible explanation for its infrequency in the language and literature and in the iconography6 of the Middle East? That is quite possible. The only thing we know for sure, however, is that the collocation qĕšĕt-beʿānān occurs only twice in the Hebrew Bible, namely here in Gen. 9:14-16, where it is fijirst introduced by God as ‘my bow that I set in the clouds’ in v. 13. So, it certainly is not a conventional or fijixed-word combination in the Hebrew Bible. Furthermore, apart from the rarity of the meteorological phenomenon and of the linguistic collocation of the terms qĕšĕt and beʿānān, both conceptual and textual elements seem to exclude the rainbow option. The conceptual content of words depends on the linguistic construal of meaning expressed in lexical items and on their cultural and communicative contexts of use.
conceptualized without reference to weather conditions. If there were no sunshine or rainy weather, there would be no rainbow. Consequently, the word ‘rainbow’ inherently, intrinsically, and obligatorily invokes the notions of [rain] and [sunshine]; this is called its ‘base’. The profijilebase relation is what constitutes the semantic value of a word, which itself presupposes the broader cognitive domain of [meteorology], in which a ‘cognitive domain’ is defijined as any knowledge confijiguration that provides the context for the conceptualization of a semantic unit (for an extensive description and examples see Van Wolde 2009: 51-103). 5) http://www.science.co.il/reports/biological-diversity-israel-1997.pdf, p. 20. 6) Scenes picturing thunder and rain on Syrian and Mesopotamian seals abound, but images of the rainbow have so far not been found. ‘The rainbow is a natural phenomenon that one would expect to encounter on the monuments of Western Asia, but that has remained elusive so far.’ (van Loon 1992: 149).

All languages construe experiences, ideas, artifacts et cetera diffferently. The optic meteorological phenomenon that is called in English ‘rainbow’, in German ‘Regenbogen’, in Swedish ‘regnbåge’ and in Italian ‘arcobaleno’, all build their linguistic expressions on the shape of this phenomenon as an arc and on its relation to rainy weather. French, modern Hebrew and Greek, on the other hand, designate the same phenomenon as ‘arc-en-ciel ’, קשת בשמים and ουράνιο τόξο, respectively. These languages base their linguistic expressions on the shape of an arc and on its place in the heaven or sky. Another Greek term ίριδα, Spanish ‘arco iris’ and Portuguese ‘arco-íris’ construe this phenomenon in relation to its shape as an arc and in relation to its colours. Thus it becomes clear that linguistic expressions in diffferent languages may be based on distinct elements and have diffferent motivations. Still the conceptual contents of these linguistic expressions is the same: they all designate the concepts of [arc], [colours], and [sky] and include the notions of [sunshine] and [rainy weather] and understand it in the cognitive domain of [meteorology].7 In addition, language users will employ these linguistic units (i.e., fijixed combinations of linguistic expression and semantic content) in various contexts in distinct ways. For example, the conceptual meaning attributed to a ‘rainbow’, ‘Regenbogen’, ‘arco iris’ on many Christian websites represent God’s peaceful covenant with the world, whereas in the name-giving customs of primary schools in the Netherlands—of 123 schools De Regenboog is the most common name for a primary school in the Netherlands [2009]—the rainbow represents an open climate for all ethnic and cultural groups, for all pupils with diffferent talents and characters. In short, the conceptual content of [rainbow] expressed in French arc-en-ciel, modern Hebrew קשת בשמים and English ‘rainbow’ is partly determined by language conventions which select some conceptual characteristics in their combination with linguistic expressions, and is partly based on a vast complex of experience and (culture-based) knowledge that resonates in the minds of language users. Returning to Biblical Hebrew, the conceptual content of the words qĕšĕt and ʿānān are [bow] and [clouds], in which [bow] might metonymically be extended to [arc]. The meaning of the word ʿānān and the question whether or not it may entail the concept of [rain] should be briefly considered. Scott (1952: 24-25) gives a survey of all words used to designate clouds in the Hebrew Bible, demonstrating that the word ʿānān expresses cloud or mist in general,
7) That is to say, someone who perceives and conceptualizes a rainbow will always include the notions of [arc], [colours], and [sky], but will express it according to the linguistic conventions of the language he or she uses.

cloud mass, cloud cover or cloud-stufff as extended rather than defijined, but not ‘a cloud’ and seldom if ever cloud-bringing rain. The word ʿāb (or its plural form ʿābîm) on the other hand is used to designate a distinct cloud, in most cases a rain-cloud. Sutclifffe (1953: 99-103) demonstrates that the word ʿābîm is used for water-carrying clouds. And fijinally, Futato (1996) confijirms the previous conclusions that only the term ʿāb or ʿābîm is used to refer to rain clouds, whereas the word ʿānān designates the cloud mass, cloud cover or undiffferentiated cloud.8 Therefore, the conceptual content of the word ʿānān can be described as [clouds] and [cloud cover], while including the notions of [vastness of space] and [expanse].9 This makes it implausible that the word ʿānān in Gen. 9:13-16 entails the content of [rain], and therefore it cannot have this element in common with qĕšĕt. In sum, the lexical items qĕšĕt and qĕšĕt-beʿānān designate in Gen. 9:13-16 the concepts of [bow] and [clouds], whereas the notion of [colours], [rain] and [sunshine] are neither present nor implicated by the text. This makes it, from a conceptual point of view, unlikely that qĕšĕt or qĕšĕt-beʿānān designates a rainbow. Textual elements confijirm this conclusion. First it should be pointed out that people who tend to think that ‘rainbow’ makes sense in this text because it follows after rain and flood, should be aware that the ‘rainbow’ follows quite a long time after the raining. The rain begins in Gen. 7:12 and ends in Gen. 8:2. The flood is referenced in Gen. 9:11 and Gen. 9:15. However, according to the narrative, about a year elapsed from the end of rain in Gen. 8:2 to the
8) In ancient Mesopotamia rain is related to the Higher Heaven and Anu the god of High Heaven is responsible for falling of the rain; the Middle Heaven or Ešarra is the level of the winds and the storms of Marduk, and the Lower Heaven or visible sky contains the sun, moon and stars and constellations. Hence, the winds in the Middle Heaven are considered to blow on a higher level than the level of the stars, that form the Lower Heaven (see Horowitz 1998). Also in the Hebrew Bible rain is connected with the highest heaven and with the Hebrew God who is responsible for the falling of the rain. Two texts seem to imply that rain clouds (ʿābîm) are considered to be positioned above the sky or cloud cover (ʿānān), namely Job 26:8, ‘He [God] wrapped up the waters in his clouds (ʿābîm); yet the cloud cover (ʿānān) does not burst under their weight’, and Nahum 1:3, ‘His [God’s] way is in the storm and the whirlwind and clouds (ʿānān) are the dust of his feet’. 9) In cognitive terminology, the word ʿānān profijiles the conceptual entity of [clouds] and [cloud cover]; further research may elucidate whether it can also express the notion of [sky]. At the same time, this word ‘clouds’ or ‘cloud-cover’ cannot be conceptualized without the notions of [vastness of space] and [expanse]; this is its ‘base’. The profijile-base relation [clouds], [cloud cover]/[vastness of space], [expanse] is what constitutes the semantic value of the word ʿānān which itself presupposes the broader cognitive domain of [ancient meteorology].

display of the qĕšĕt-beʿānān in Gen. 9:13.10 Also in the immediate context, only the flood is mentioned. Second, in Gen. 9:8-17 God sets the bow in the sky as a sign for himself, a sign of the covenant between him and all life on earth: ‘when it appears, I will remember my covenant’ (vv. 14-15), ‘when the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the covenant’ (v. 16). The text does not say that this bow is a sign for humanity or even that it is visible to human beings. Since the story is narrated in two direct discourses introduced by ‘God said’ in v. 12 and by ‘God said to Noah’ in v. 17, we share God’s perspective only. And while sharing his point of view, we come to know that God sees the bow as a reminder of his covenant (three times ʾôt-habberît in vv. 12, 13 and 17). Third, if the word qĕšĕt expressed the idea of a rainbow and if this bow functioned as a token that in the future would remind God of his covenant, what then is the conceptual connection between his bow, i.e. his rainbow, and his covenant? What distinctive features cognitively link these items together? That is to say, in order to function as a sign one might expect the rainbow to have some element in common with a covenant. Not the colours, the rain, or the sunshine, because they do not fijigure in the text. The only element that comes to mind is the arc-like shape, but what does this arc-like form have in common with the covenant? And an even more pressing question, why would a rainbow be called ‘his’ rainbow?11 To conclude this section on the possibility of the word qĕšĕt meaning ‘rainbow’, we must acknowledge that its common meaning in the Hebrew Bible is ‘warrior’s bow’ and that there would have to be strong evidence in Gen. 9:8-17 to read qĕšĕt otherwise. However, the above mentioned meteorological, linguistic, conceptual, and textual issues do not confijirm this exceptional or unconventional meaning in Gen. 9:8-17 and make it implausible that qĕšĕt or qĕšĕt-beʿānān designates a rainbow in this text.
10) If we escape a little from the narrative to the real world, imagine a rainbow appearing a year after the rain stopped! 11) Another question might be posed. Today we know that a rainbow does not actually exist at a particular location in the sky, but depends on the observer’s location and the position of the sun. All raindrops refract and reflect the sunlight in the same way, but only the light from some raindrops that reach the observer’s eye constitute the rainbow for that observer. (For further information see: http://eo.ucar.edu/rainbows.) As a result, a deity who is envisioned as living above the atmosphere would be unable to see a rainbow at all. Although people in the ancient Near East did not have this scientifijic knowledge, they would have been aware of the fact that the perception of a rainbow is dependant on the observer’s location and the position of the sun. If the deity is thought of as living above the heavenly expanse (compare Ezek. 1:26), and the sun, moon and stars are conceived as moving below the heavenly vault, then it would be impossible for the deity to see a rainbow.

The Word qĕšĕt in Genesis 9:8-17: A Warrior’s Bow?
Linguistics and Biblical Occurrences of qĕšĕt
Some scholars have opted for the meaning of qĕšĕt as a warrior’s bow in Genesis 9.12 Linguistically, the argumentation that the word qĕšĕt expresses a warrior’s or a hunter’s bow is a strong one. Out of its 76 uses in the Hebrew Bible, this meaning is obvious in 72 texts (DCH VII: 339-340). Apart from the three uses in the text under analysis and the use of qĕšĕt in Ezek. 1:28 in relation to a rainy day (followed by Ben Sira in 43:11 and 50:7), all other uses of the word qĕšĕt in the Hebrew Bible clearly indicate the meaning of a warrior’s bow (rarely hunter’s bow). In the context of fijighting or war this word appears in the Hebrew Bible with its prototypical meaning of [warrior’s bow], and this meaning necessarily includes the notions of [arrows], [weapon of attack], and [enemy] and is functioning in the cognitive domain of [war]. In Genesis the word qĕšĕt occurs seven times: three times in our text, twice in the sense of a warrior’s bow, and once in the meaning of a hunter’s bow, namely Gen. 27:3, (Isaac says to Esau) ‘Take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go into the open and hunt me some game’. In addition, in Gen. 21:16, [Hagar] ‘went and sat down at a distance a bowshot away’, qĕšĕt can refer to either a warrior’s bow or a hunter’s bow; this is equally true for Gen. 21:20, where Ishmael is called a qaššāt, an archer or bowman. The two clear uses of qĕšĕt ‘warrior’s bow’ are Gen. 48:22 and 49:24. In Gen. 48:22 the dying father Jacob speaks to Joseph saying: ‘And now, I assign to you one portion more than to your brothers, which I wrested from the Amorites with my sword and bow’ (NJPS translation). Literally the text speaks of ‘taking (lāqaḥ) from the hands of the Amorites’ and together with the word combination of ḥarabî ‘my sword’ and qaštî ‘my bow’ it is obvious that the context is one of fijighting or war, that the described weapons are weapons of attack, and that these weapons are closely connected with its possessor who defeats his enemies. As a consequence of his powerful victory Jacob was able to apportion the land to Joseph’s sons. In Gen. 49:23-24 Jacob continues his speech to Joseph saying, ‘Archers bitterly assailed him [ Joseph]; they shot at him and harried him. Yet his bow stayed taut, and his arms were made fijirm by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob’ (NJPS translation). The word qaštô ‘his bow’ is used here in combination with the verb yāšab ‘to stay, abide, sit’ plus the adverb beʾêtān ‘permanent, enduring’: his bow abode as an enduring, fijirm one, and the arms of his hands

(zerōê yādaw) were made fijirm by the hands of the Mighty One (ʿābîr) of Jacob. So here again, the bow is closely linked to its owner as a representation of his enduring power. We may conclude that in Genesis’ two uses of the word qĕšĕt ‘warrior’s bow’, this word fijigures in the cognitive domains of [war] and [dominion] and designates a [warrior’s bow] while including the notions of the warrior’s [victorious power] and [might].13 Culture, place and time-bound information related to the way wars are fought, the structure of an army or troop, the person and function of an archer, the production and use of weapons, the development of warfare, and so on, might enlighten us about the confijiguration of knowledge in which this bow functions. From texts in the Hebrew Bible we learn that the bow, bowstring and arrows are used as a weapon of attack by powerful fijighters—mainly kings, commanders or other powerful persons—and often fijigure in a war-winning situation (Fabry 1993: 222). In the conventional conceptualization of the series of actions and events in ancient warfare (i.e., in the prototypical scenario of warfare)14 the bow-strike seems to mark the decisive blow in the fijinal stage of war. This is visible in the books of Samuel and Kings, because here the bow is used by kings or their archers when describing their victory over the enemies.15 A comparable use of the word qĕšĕt is noticeable in the Psalms, where metaphors depict God as a heavenly warrior who fijights with warrior attributes. Based on a close study of these Psalms, Klingbeil (1999) shows how God is characterized as being actively involved in the actual attack on an enemy in a warwinning situation and how this functions as an expression of his might and
13) Hence, the word qĕšĕt profijiles in these two Genesis texts a person’s [warrior’s bow] and includes in its base the concepts of [victorious power] and [might]. 14) A ‘prototypical scenario’ is defijined as the most representative series of actions, events, or behaviours in a culture that constitutes the content of an idea. Such a scenario is a reflection of the conventional behavioural sequences in a culture, of the patterns of actions, situations or events. 15) See: 1 Sam. 31:3 and its description of the fijinal blow the Philistine archers strike on Saul when hitting him with their bow; 2 Sam. 1:18-27 and David’s ‘Song of the Bow’ or qĕšĕt, a song of military power and glory of Israel; 2 Sam. 22, where David praises Yhwh who has saved him from the hand of his enemies, saying in v. 35, ‘who trained my hands for the battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze’. Here the bow represents the victory of David as a warrior. Similar war-winning situations are expressed by strikes of victorious bows in 1 Kg. 22:34 (the bow of an archer of the king of Aram kills Ahab, so that he dies of its wounds); 2 Kg. 9:24 ( Jehu kills king Joram and thus becomes king); 2 Kg. 13:14-18 (Elisha tells King Joash of Israel to take his bow to defeat Aram, which he does while exclaiming in v. 17: ‘An arrow of victory for Yhwh! An arrow of victory over Aram!’).



132 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
supremacy.16 And he concludes: ‘Although Yahweh acts as a warrior he never becomes the warrior-god exclusively, he rather remains the supreme god displaying warrior characteristics, but not in the form of mere emblem which would designate him as the war-god.’ (Klingbeil 1999: 302). Because the bow is such a distinctive mark of warfare and of the winner who demonstrates his rule and dominion, it comes as no surprise that the end of the war is represented by the ‘breaking of the bow’. See, for example, in Ps. 46:10-11: ‘He puts a stop to wars throughout the earth, breaking the bow, snapping the spear, consigning weapons to flames. “Desist! Realize that I am God! I dominate the nations; I dominate the earth”.’ (NJPS translation). Also in Isa. 41:2-3, where Cyrus’ bow defeats the enemies and brings them down to dust, the text refers to both Cyrus’ sword and bow, his might, as well as to Yhwh who has helped him in his victory. We can, therefore, draw the conclusion that throughout the Hebrew Bible the word qĕšĕt designates prototypically a [warrior’s bow], while including the notions of [weapon of attack], [arrows], and [enemy] as well as those of [power], [might] and [supremacy]. Thus it becomes clear that it fijigures not in one, but in two cognitive domains, namely [war] and [dominion].17 It is used in a prototypical scenario of fijighting events in which the bow strike marks the decisive blow in the fijinal stage of war, and thus comes to stand for the [victorious weapon] of the winning warrior.
Iconography: ANE Pictures of a Deity and His or Her Warrior’s Bow
Iconographic information may help us to build up a mental image of ancient Near Eastern people and their visualizations of gods or goddesses with a bow. The iconographic data presented in this section are based on Klingbeil (1999) who examined ninety three ANE pictures that visualize God as warrior or as God of heaven. He distinguishes four motif groups in the images of gods as warrior: (1) the smiting god, (2) the god in archer scenes, (3) the god with the spear, and (4) the god in arms. He concludes: ‘It is interesting to note that the active warrior scenes, i.e. images on which the god is actively involved in warrior
16) See, for example, Ps. 21:13 where God as a warrior with his bowstring (mêtār) takes aim against the faces of the enemies. 17) In the Hebrew Bible the bow is not used with a connotation of [protection]. This conceptualization of the bow stands in sharp contrast to that of a shield (māgen), a weapon of defence that fijigures in the cognitive domains of [war] and [protection]. See, among others, Ps. 18:35-36: ‘[the God] who trained my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. You have given me the shield of your protection; your right hand has sustained me, your care has made me great.’ (NJPS translation).

activities like smiting, shooting, thrusting, are largely limited to the end of the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. (. . .) The passive warrior scenes, i.e., the god in arms motif, have been limited to the Neo-Assyrian period, while only one sample comes from the Syro-Palestinian region.’ (Klingbeil 1999: 195-196). Seven Neo-Assyrian cylinder seals which could be dated to the late 9th and early 8th century B.C.E. offfer scenes that show either the gods Ninurata and Adad or the goddess Ištar carrying bows crosswise over their shoulders or pointing a bow.18 All of them show worshippers facing the god or goddess who are raising their hands in adoring gestures toward the god. On one seal, Ištar holds the bow in her hand, while facing a female adorant.19 On another seal an armed bearded god (Ninurta or Adad) is holding a bow in his hand.20 Klingbeil describes another series of fijive pictures with the weather-god in arms or the sun-god in arms. The fijirst is a limestone stela from Babylon (dated 823-811 B.C.E.) that presents a scene with three fijigures.21 On the left, the goddess Ištar raises her one hand in a gesture of blessing, while the other hand is extended toward the front, holding the tip of a bow and ring. In the middle, the god Adad is holding a bundle of lightning in both hands. On the right, a worshipper who is dressed like an Assyrian king is facing him. The relief on the famous ‘broken obelisk’ from Nineveh shows a personifijication of the winged sundisk and is dated to the 10th century B.C.E.22 The scene shows the Assyrian king (?) holding ring and rod in one hand, while the other is open in a gesture of receiving adoration. In front of him four enemies are visible in a submissive posture, having raised their hands in a gesture of adoration. They have a ring through their nose to which a rope is attached which is held by the king. However, the most interesting aspect of the image is the top part of the scene. Above the captives a winged sundisk is visible. From the wings two hands are coming forth, one holding a bow as if to hand the weapon to the king, while the other is extended with an open palm toward the king in a blessing gesture. The god represented by the image is the Assyrian solar deity Šamaš. In presenting the bow to the king he is aiding the monarch in warfare and the conquest of his enemies, thus transferring military power to the ruler.

A more anthropomorphized variant of the motif can be found on a bronze disk with unknown provenance which can be dated to the 9th century B.C.E.23 The center image consists of three fijigures: two atlants are kneeling on stylized mountains supporting the wings of a sundisk from which the upper body of a male god is emerging. The god is holding a bow in front of him, while the other hand is raised and extended toward the front in a blessing gesture. The connection of the sundisk with the god with a bow appears to identify him as a solar deity with military connotations which is especially apparent with the association of the motif with scenes of war and victory. The fourth picture is the well-known glazed tile from Aššur, found in the Anu-Adad-Temple, dating to the time of Tikulti-Ninurta II (890-884 B.C.E.), now in the British Museum (BM: 115706).24 The sundisk is depicted as encompassing the winged god completely, while there are rays or flames of fijire depicted within the sun nimbus. With his hand the god is holding a bow which he has stretched to its limits, pointing at an imaginary or at least unseen enemy, since the scene has been broken offf on the right side. A chariot scene is visible below, of which only the head of the charioteer and the upper part of the horse’s head are visible. Around the winged sundisk there are stylized clouds with raindrops suspended from the upper border below an inscription. The association of the god with rain-clouds demonstrates his identifijication with a storm- and weather-deity, while the wide wings symbolize the dark thundering heaven. A rather intricate combination of warrior and god of heaven attributes is present in this scene. It creates a complex image of the god fijighting from heaven with meteorological weapons. As for the identifijication of the winged god in the sundisk, we would follow Mayer-Opifijicius who has convincingly shown that the god represents Šamaš rather than Aššur. A relief from Nimrud from the North-West palace of Aššurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.) shows another solar god with a bow and arrow.25 Here the winged sundisk is depicted as a ring which has been placed over god’s upper body and the god is aiming a bow toward the right side at an enemy, while bowstring and arrow are clearly distinguishable.
23) Klingbeil (1999: 259) only reproduces the center image in the line drawing of Figure 89 and describes it on pp. 259-260. The design is mostly Assyrian but exhibits also Urartian elements, e.g., the form of the chariots and dress of the drivers. 24) This tile has been repeatedly published: in black-and-white in Pritchard 1969: 536, in colour in Andrae 1925: Plate 8, p. 27, which is reproduced in Parrot 1961: Figure 282.

This ancient Near Eastern pictographic material gives us additional information on how people may have thought of a warrior god. If they had viewed him in images comparable to those of the solar deity (Šamaš) who is holding a bow in front of him while the other hand is blessing, or who presents his bow to the king and is thus aiding the monarch in warfare and the conquest of his enemies, they might have thought of the deity in terms of someone who is in charge and who is transferring his power to the ruler. Or if they had viewed him in images comparable to those of the weather-god Adad, the god Ninurta, or of the goddess Ištar who are represented as powerful deities carrying bows crosswise over their shoulders, they might have thought of them as deities whose weapons testify to their power. The conceptual content that all these pictures share with each other is that the god with the warrior’s bow expresses [victorious power] and [might] in the cognitive domain of [dominion]. In addition, some pictures of the sun-god with a bow indicate a [transfer of power], whereas other pictures of Adad, Ninurta and Ištar with a bow apparently function in the cognitive domain of [cult] as is clearly visible in the depicted adorant-worshippers.
Intertextuality: Mesopotamian Texts and Astronomy
Intertextual relationships of the biblical flood story with Mesopotamian texts are equally instructive. Anthonioz (2010) demonstrates that in the available ancient Near Eastern flood stories, the flood is described as a great battle between divine beings and the winds of the flood in which the bow is the crucial instrument with which the deity or flood hero defeats the dangerous and bad powers of nature. In The Myth of Anzû, Ninurta is the hero who fijights seven fijights and defeats all seven bad winds. At the heart of the story describing the turning point in the fijight (Tablet II 53-60), the text describes how Ninurta defeated the flood. The powerful deity ‘drew his bow (qaštu) and armed it with an arrow, from the middle of the bow he sent his arrow’.26 Thus he calmed the flood and made it powerless. In Ninurta and the Stones a similar fijight against the winds and the monster of the deluge is pictured, in which a long bow again takes up a crucial position. In Enuma Elish (IV 35-50), Marduk’s fijight against Tiamat is described (translation by Talon 2005 cited by Anthonioz 2010: 197):
35 Il façonna l’arc, révéla son arme, 36 Il fijit chevaucher la flèche, il plaça la corde,
26) See Annus (2001: 23-24) and Anthonioz (2010: 191).



136 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
37 Il brandit la masse, (la) saisit de sa droite, 38 Il suspendit à son côté l’arc et le carquois, 39 Il plaça l’éclair devant lui, 40 Il emplit son corps de flammes ardentes, 41 Il fijit le fijilet (pour y mettre) Tiamat intacte au-dedans, 42 Il prit les quatre vents, rien d’elle ne (pourra s’en) sortir, 43 Le vent du sud, . . .
Marduk’s competency as an archer brings Tiamat to an end, and his victory is marked by the verb nâḥu: it is not the sea that is brought to rest, but the hero, the Lord himself. Anthonioz concludes that the story of the flood with the protagonist and hero Noah opens and closes the story with this same concept of [rest]. In the section immediately following our text in vv. 12-17, Noah receives the rest of a warrior who gets a vineyard after fijinishing his active service as the hero of the flood (Anthonioz 2010: 199). Various Mesopotamian texts narrate how the bow, after being used by deities as a successful weapon of attack, becomes a victorious sign of the war won over the enemies and how it is set in the sky as the Bow Star, qaštu. The most important testimony of this view is Enuma Elish VI 80-94, where Anu, the deity of the Upper Heavens, presents his bow to the other gods and praises its power; he calls the bow his daughter and gives it three names: ‘long bow’, ‘conqueror’, and ‘Bow Star’ and he lets it appear in the sky as a constellation. Finally, he gives this bow a place in the assembly of the gods.
80 Les grands dieux, à cinquante, prirent place 81 les dieux des destins, à sept, fijixèrent les sentences. 82 Le Seigneur présenta alors l’Arc, son arme, et le jeta devant eux, 83 ils virent le fijilet qu’il s’était fait, les dieux, ses pères. 84 Ils virent l’Arc, combien était parfaite sa forme, 85 ses pères louèrent les actes qu’il avait accomplis. 86 Anu l’éleva et prit la parole dans l’assemblée des dieux, 87 ayant embrassé l’Arc, (il dit): « C’est bien ma fijille! »
88 De l’Arc, il nomma ainsi les noms: 89 « Long bois », que ce soit le premier; que le deuxième soit « Conquérant », 90 son troisième nom est «Etoile de l’Arc», il la fijit apparaître dans le ciel, 91 il fijixa sa position parmi les dieux, ses frères.
92 Après qu’Anu eut décrété les destins de l’Arc,



E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149 137
93 il instaura un trône royal, élevé parmi les dieux, 94 et Anu le fijit s’asseoir, lui, dans l’assemblée des dieux. <. . .>? (Talon 2005: 101)
Enuma Elish VI 80-94 shows us the process of metaphorical conceptualization of qaštu, ‘bow’. This word begins its life in the cognitive domain of [war] where it expresses a [warrior’s bow]. It is then extended to signify a [sign of victory], still fijiguring in the same domain. Finally it is transferred to the target domain of [astronomy] and [deities], and comes to express a bow or an arclike constellation, the [Bow Star]. Based on this text, Horowitz (1998: 124) describes the Bow Star as the fijinal addition to the universe in Enuma Elish and explains that in Astrolabe B (KAV 218 B I 14-16) the Bow Star is identifijied with Ištar of Elam and is called the daughter of Anu. Also the astronomical text 5R 46 23 identifijies the Bow Star as Ištar of Babylon. In Mesopotamian iconography the bow is clearly the standard attribute of Ištar. Walker (1983:146) mentions an Old Babylonian prayer to the ‘gods of the night’ which contains a list of stars, and qaštum the Bow Star is one of them. Rochberg (2004: 56) mentions the Babylonian namburbû ritual, which is a ritual against the ‘evil of the bow’, which includes offferings to be made to the god Ea and the goddess Ištar. Therefore, the semantic content of [warrior’s bow] is valid here, but it is metaphorically extended to the constellation Bow Star.27 The Bow Star Qaštu is identifijied by Reiner and Pingree (1981: 11) as Canis Maior. This conspicuous constellation lies mainly just south of the Milky Way between Orion and the long train of bright stars from the old Argo Navis. The constellation is dominated by the bright star Sirius, the brightest appearing star in the sky. It is also known that the ancient Egyptians based their calendar on its yearly motion around the sky, so that it is certain that both in ancient Mesopotamia and in ancient Egypt this Bow Star was an important constellation.28
27) Horowitz (1998) and Rochberg (2004) extend therefore the meaning of the word qĕšĕt in Gen. 9:12-17 from ‘warrior’s bow’ to the constellation Bow Star. 28) According to Rochberg (2004: 56, n. 31) a new identifijication of Qaštu as Canis Minor (with Procyon, the eighth brightest star in the sky) by Hunger and Pingree (1999) replaces the earlier identifijication.

Arguments Given so Far for the Word Qĕšĕt ‘Warrior’s Bow’
Let me evaluate the arguments in favour of the view that the word qĕšĕt in Gen. 9:8-17 designates a [warrior’s bow]. The fijirst argument is a linguistic one. In 72 out of 76 occurrences in the Hebrew Bible, qĕšĕt certainly designates a weapon of attack while including the notions of the warrior’s [victorious power] and [might]. The word qĕšĕt in its common, prototypical meaning of a warrior’s bow fijigures in the cognitive domains of [war] and [dominion]. The second argument is a textual one. In the biblical texts with qĕšĕt,29 the word qĕšĕt is used in a prototypical scenario of fijighting-events in which the bow strike expresses the decisive blow in the fijinal stage of war, and thus comes to stand for the [victorious weapon] of the winning warrior. The third argument is a cultural one. In the ancient Near Eastern mind, a bow may be carried by humans or deities. Iconography has elucidated how deities are pictured with bows. It thus became clear that all discussed pictures are sharing the same conceptual content: the scene with a god with a warrior’s bow all express [victorious power] and [might] and stands out against the cognitive domain of [dominion]. In addition, some scenes with the solar god with a bow also express a [transfer of power], whereas others with the deities Adad, Ninurta and Ištar with a bow predominantly function in the cognitive domain of [cult] as is clearly visible in the depicted adorantworshippers. The fourth argument is an intertextual one. Various Mesopotamian texts narrate how the bow, after being used by deities as a successful weapon of attack, becomes a victorious sign of the war won over the enemies of the flood. Here again, the conceptual content of the deity’s warrior-bow is [victorious power] and [might] and fijigures in the cognitive domains of [war against the flood] and [dominion]. The fijinal argument is based on astronomy. In various Babylonian texts it is told how the divine bow as a victorious sign of the war won over the enemies is set in the sky as the Bow Star, qaštu. Thus this constellation, which is equally important in Mesopotamian and Egyptian astronomy, represents [victorious power] and [might] and fijigures in the cognitive domain of [dominion]. These distinct data sets demonstrate that the prototypical meaning of a warrior’s bow which might be carried by humans or deities is a weapon of attack,

E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149 139
and they also illustrate which ideas are closely connected with it, namely [victory], [enduring power], and [might], concepts that not only fijigure in the cognitive domain of [war] but also in the cognitive domain of [dominion].
The Composite Meaning Structure in Genesis 9:8-17
So far I have examined the meaning potentials of the word qĕšĕt. In every text words that originate in diffferent settings have been combined and integrated into one new complex of meaning. Thus a word’s wide range of meaning potentials becomes restricted and contextualized. This contextualization of meaning can be explained in more detail. The internal structure of a word is made up of various components which determine the vast range of potential combinations with other words. Each word has a valence or a disposition to combine with other words in that they can share meaning components.30 A study of the semantic substructures and composite meaning structure in Gen. 9:8-17 might enlighten us further.
Correspondences between Semantic Substructures
A crucial term in this text is the verb nātan which occurs twice, once in the participial clause ʾanî nōtēn ʾôt-habberît in v. 12 ‘I am setting the sign of the covenant’ and once in the verbal clause ʾĕt-qaštî nātatî beʿānān, ‘I have set my bow in the clouds’ in v. 13. Semantically the verb nātan qal designates ‘to hold out or extend one’s hand in order to set/put something in a place or to place/put someone in the possession of something’ (Lipiński 1986: 694).31 Both meanings (spatial transfer and deliverance) are in the Hebrew bible not conceived
30) Langacker (1987: 277-278): ‘In chemistry it has long been recognized that the valence properties of atoms—their combinatory potential—can only be understood and explained with reference to their internal structure. (. . .) Valence relations between atoms are based on the sharing of electrons. The valence relations uniting linguistic expressions depend in similar fashion on the sharing of elements. It is only by virtue of having certain substructures in common that two component expressions can be integrated to form a coherent composite expression.’ (Langacker 1987: 277). The concept of ‘valence’ can help us to bridge the gap between language and text, between linguistics and literary studies. (For an more elaborate description and application, see Van Wolde 2009.) 31) Lipiński (1986: 694): “Im bibl. Hebr. begegnet ntn qal etwas 1900mal. Es drückt einen besonders weiten Begrifff aus, dessen Grundbedeutung nicht „geben“, „ein Geschenk machen“ ist, sondern die Hand ausstrecken, um einen Gegenstand an einen bestimmten Platz zu stellen oder um es einer anderen Person als Eigentum zu übergeben, gegen oder ohne Entgelt. Das Ergebnis der Aktion wird meistens als bleibend and defijinitiv angesehen.”



140 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
mutually exclusive but inclusive.32 The collocation nātan be expresses primarily the spatial action ‘to place something in’ (Labuschagne 1976: 119 and Grisanti 1996: 205-211). The participle clause in v. 12 describes an atemporal relation and thus creates the perception of duration in which the end point is not included; it characterizes the deity relative to the sign of the covenant, which he is setting or handing over. Conversely, the verbal clause in v. 13 with the fijinite qatal form narrate God’s actual setting of the specifijic lexical unit qaštî (specifijic because of the pronominal sufffijix ‘my’ in ‘my bow’) to the word ʿānān which appears to be a general, unrelated, and extensive cloud mass or cloud cover, and expresses the temporal process in which the beginning and the endpoint of the action are included. God performs a spatial movement on his bow along a path, which takes the place in his hand or the place where God is localized as the starting point and the clouds as the fijinal position to which the subject orientates his movement that culminates inside the clouds. In vv. 14 and 16 the bow is not moved anymore, but is defijined by its place in the clouds. Verse 14 presents the unique word combination beʿanenî ʿānān ʿal-hāʾārĕṣ. Nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible is it stated that God ‘clouds clouds’ or ‘brings in clouds’, and it stands out as extraordinary. What does it mean? First, it is God who is bringing the cloud mass, ‘my clouding clouds’. Second, God’s bringing of clouds is explicitly related to the appearance of the bow, ‘my bow and my bringing of clouds’. Third, these clouds are related to the earth: ‘my bringing of clouds over the earth’. The conceptual content of the word ʿānān which was described as [clouds] and including the notions of [vastness of space] and [expanse], is now contextually specifijied: it derives its specifijication from the clouds’ position ʿal-hāʾārĕṣ ‘over the earth’. In other words, the base meaning components [vastness of space] and [expanse] in the word ʿānān enter into a valence relation with the base meaning components [surface] and [vastness of space] in ʿal-hāʾārĕṣ ‘over the earth’, and indicate that the clouds are conceived relative to the entire earth. The correspondences between the semantic components of verses 13 and 14 build up into a more complex meaning structure. The divine actions of ‘setting’ and ‘clouding’ are both spatially oriented. The setting of his bow in the clouds in v. 13 shows that God separates from his bow and that he places it somewhere between his dwelling place (the heaven) and the earth. Verse 14 shows that this
32) See for example Gen. 16:3 ‘Sarai gave her maid to Abram (wattitēn ʾôtâ leʾavram)’ and Sarai’s summary of the same event in 16:5: ‘I placed my maid in your bosom (nātattî beḥêqekā)’. Cf. also Gen. 41: 42 where ‘Pharaoh puts it [his signet ring] on Joseph’s hand (wayyitēn ʾôtâ ʿal-yad yōsef )’; this text shows that Pharao’s spatial gesture entails ‘putting in possession’.



E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149 141
place is the clouds that are presented as covering the entire earth. Therefore, the bow is spatially positioned in the intermediate space between the deity and the entire earth. And it is this bow that is said to represent God’s covenant between himself and the earth. An even wider network of semantic relations becomes visible when we take into account the entire section of Gen. 9:8-17 and the correspondences between the meaning components of the individual words (see Figure 1). The following correspondences between the meaning components form a clear combinatory pattern: (1) There are only two subjects of action, viz. ‘I’ in vv. 9-13a, 14a, 15, 16b, 17a, and ‘my bow’ in v. 13b or ‘the bow’ in vv. 14b and 16a, suggesting that ‘my bow’ or ‘the bow in the clouds’ is the representative of the deity who is speaking in the fijirst person. (2) There is the fijivefold use of the preposition with pronominal sufffijix ʾitkĕm ‘with you’. The deity relates his action to Noah, his family and his descendants; this is the main partner, while the other partners are conceived in relation to them. (3) The verbs qûm and nātan (be) share the same spatial concept of ‘setting up’ or ‘establishing’ and are set in similar syntactic constructions (vv. 9a and 12a are participle clauses, vv. 11a and 13a fijinite verbal clauses). (4) The verbs rāʾâ and zākar share the similar concepts of seeing directly with the eyes or indirectly in the mind, both in the fijirst person. All four verbs in (3) and (4) represent the spatial, conceptual, and perceptual perspective of God. (5) The repetitive use of the preposition ‘between’ is striking: it is used with regard to the covenant of one partner with another partner (expressed by bên u-bên in vv. 13, 16 and 17) or with two other partners (expressed by bên u-bên u-bên in vv. 12 and 15), so that the total sum of the preposition bên amounts to twelve. In case of a partnership between two partners, these are ‘Me’/‘God’ and ‘(all life on) earth’; in case of three partners, it is between ‘Me’ and ‘you’ and ‘all life with you’. The preposition bên designates [intermediate space]. The covenant and the bow as the sign of the covenant are localized in space between ‘Me’/‘God’ and ‘(all life on) earth’ or between ‘Me’ and ‘you’ and ‘all life with you’. (6) The phrases ʿānān ʿalhāʾārĕṣ and kol ašer hāʾārĕṣ share the concept of [earth] as well as [extensiveness] and a certain vagueness, which also explains why the term ʿānān is used to designate the extensiveness of the cloud covering the earth. Note also the sevenfold usage of kol ‘all’ and ‘entire’ in vv. 12 (once), 15 (three times), 16 (twice), and 17 (once), and the double usage of ʿōlām ‘everlasting’ in vv. 12 and 16. This meaning structure explains why v. 14a explicitly states that God is bringing the clouds ‘over the earth’. It is the individuality of the bow and the individuality of the covenant as well as the superiority of the powerful party that stands over against the extensive earth as a whole. When the deity sees his



142 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
powerful weapon set in the clouds, he will remember his covenant with all those covered by the clouds.
Composite Meaning Structure
All these correspondences together build up into a composite meaning complex which is made possible by the sharing of base components. Figure 2 summarizes the meaning components and the bold print refers to the shared base components. A short explanation will follow. Verses 9, 10 and 11 contain three main elements, ʾanî mēqîm / haqimôtî, berîtî and ʾitkem. The word berît ‘covenant’ (used twice) expresses a bond between a superior party and an inferior party, a partnership between a lord and his vassals. It designates [hierarchy] and [supremacy] as well as [bond] and [sharing of power], while it functions in the cognitive domains of [dominion] and [peace]. The verb qûm expresses the spatial concept of [setting up] or

[establishing] and indicates the start of this bond. The preposition ʾĕt ‘with’ (fijive times) describes [proximity] and [togetherness]. Thus it becomes clear that these three elements share the base components of [sharing] and [togetherness] in relation to power. Verse 12 combines the three elements nôtēnʾanî, ôt-habberît, and bên, in which the verb nātan expresses the initialisation, the [setting up] of the sign, and the term berît potentially expresses the concepts of [hierarchy] and [bond]. Whereas vv. 9-11 collocate habberît with the preposition ʾĕt and thus expresses the togetherness of the covenant partners, the preposition bên in v.12 includes the notion of distance between the covenant partners who are positioned vis-à-vis the space that separates them. The three elements nôtēnʾanî, ôt-habberît, and bên share, therefore, the base component of [mediation]. In v. 13a, the verb nātan is collocated with the preposition be ‘in’, so that nātan beʿānān ʾĕt qaštî describes a spatial movement. The word ānān designates [clouds] and [cloud cover] and includes the notion of [intermediate space] between heaven and earth. In v. 14 these clouds are defijined vis-à-vis the earth. So, what started as a position in-between-heaven-and-earth is subsequently defijined as a position related to the earth. In addition, the notion of [extensiveness] included in the word ʿānān [cloud cover] corresponds with that of [expanse] in ʾĕrĕṣ. God moves his bow along a path, while taking his hand or at least his place in the (upper) heavens as its starting point, and the clouds are localized as the fijinal position to which he orientates his movement that culminates inside the clouds. Therefore, these words express the [spatial transfer] of God’s [bow]. In v. 13b the bow set at a distance becomes ‘the sign of the covenant between me and the earth’. The word qĕšĕt prototypically designates a [warrior’s bow] used in the cognitive domains of [war] and [dominion] in relation to the victorious winner of that war, and entails meaning components such as [victorious weapon of attack], [enemy], [victory], as well as [power], [might] and [supremacy]. The covenant designates [hierarchy] and [supremacy] as well as [bond] and [sharing of power]. The word ʾôt designates [mediation] and the preposition bên [intermediate space]. It thus becomes clear that all these words share the base components of [spatial transfer] and [power]. From v. 14 onwards the time frame of the narration changes. The events in vv. 14-17 are told from a point in the future in which the seeing of the sign of the covenant makes God realize what actually happened in the past. Verse 14a fijirst depicts the circumstances (‘whenever I bring clouds over the earth’) in which ʿānān shares with ʾĕrĕṣ the base component of [expanse]. The appearance of the bow in v. 14b shows that God is already separated from his weapon and that

it has already been spatially transferred to the clouds which are defijined vis-àvis the earth. Therefore, the words in this verse share the base component of [spatially transferred], a transport in place that is situated in the past. In v. 15 we get access to God future thoughts. The word zākar ‘remember’ designates [mediation] between present and past which takes place in someone’s mind. The bow in the clouds God is seeing makes the past present, so that he realizes that he did share his power with the partners on earth. The word berît expresses [hierarchy] and [supremacy] as well as [bond] and [sharing of power], and the word bên designates [intermediate space], so that we can conclude that the base components shared by zākar, berît and bên amount to God’s realization of his sharing of power in the past, hence [power shared]. The same future standpoint is shared in v. 16, but now the lens is zooming out, presenting a kind of overall view, in which God for the fijirst time does not speak about ‘I’ and ‘you’, but the text describes the covenant partners as ‘God’ and ‘the earth’. Verse 16 opens with the presence of the bow in the clouds and God’s perception of it. The bow’s place in the clouds entails that it has been set at a distance from God, and since the clouds have previously been defijined in relation to the earth, this position in the clouds relates the bow to the earth too. God’s warrior-bow represents his enduring power, so that the event in which the bow has been transferred from him to the clouds indicates that his power (over the earth) is transferred to the earth’s inhabitants. Finally, in v. 17 the verb qûm occurs again. Whereas in vv. 9-11 the preposition ʾĕt is collocated with the covenant in order to express the togetherness of the covenant partners, the preposition bên in v.17 includes the notion of distance between the covenant partners while they are positioned vis-à-vis the space that separates them. God’s remembrance of the sign of the covenant brings to mind both the distance and the bridging of this distance by the sign, thus representing the actual [transfer of power] that took place in the past. Above I asked what the conceptual connection would be between God’s rainbow and his covenant, and now I ask the same question about his warrior’s bow. The correct answer is that the distinctive features that link God’s fijighting bow and his covenant are the conceptual contents of [power] and [sharing of / transfer of power].
The Context of Genesis
One can raise the question how God’s transfer of power represented by the bow in the clouds may fijit the textual context of Genesis 9 and other texts in Genesis it is referring to. Due to space reasons my answer must be short.



146 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
In Gen. 9:1-7, prior to mention of the covenant, three topics are presented: (1) at the beginning and the end of the episode God blesses Noah and his sons, which he describes as being fertile and fijilling the earth; (2) closely linked to this blessing and spreading over the earth are the fear (môrāʿ) and dread (ḥat) of the other living beings on earth toward humans; (3) these living beings are said to be ‘delivered into your hands’ (nātan beyadkĕm).33 Clearly God gives the human race the power to monitor the earth, although their dominion is restricted by some rules: they are not allowed to eat flesh with its life-blood in it or to shed the blood of a human being. Regardless these restrictions, from now on all animal life will fall under human control, and all green plant life will too. The reason for this is given in v. 6: ‘For in his image did God make human beings’. This ‘image of God’, as well as the blessing and multiplication on earth, and the dominion of the earth in Gen. 9:1-7 refer back to Gen. 1: 26-28, where the rule over the earth is expressed by the verb rādâ be.
In the idiom of v. 26b (rādâ be), humankind will both rule and dominate with an enormous power. (. . .) as ‘image’, the human race will embody and assert the power of its referent over the natural world. Rādâ itself is an evocative verb. One nuance bears upon mastery, especially as an expression of victory or punishment. (. . .) rādâ implies a relationship between victor and vanquished. Another nuance bears upon the identity of the victorious party. (. . .) That part is often royal; rādâ can express the power that a king wields over his subjects (. . .). In this sense, it is a royal prerogative (. . .). For the reading of rādâ in Gen 1:26, then, these two nuances suggest that humankind is empowered to hold dominion over the world and rule its inhabitants as a king. Through its ‘image’, the human race will master the world as a majestic, executive, and triumphant power. (Garr 2003: 155-157)
The topic our text shares with Gen. 1:26-28 and 9:1-7 is human dominion over the earth. However, what was expressed symbolically as ‘the image of God’ and ‘dominion’ in Gen. 1:26-28 and 9:1-7 is expressed metonymically in Gen. 9:8-17.34 Metonyms can be either real or fijictional concepts representing other concepts either real or fijictional, but they must serve as an efffective and widely understood second name for what they represent, which is unquestionably true for the private weapon of God. The bow, the entity that is intimately associated
33) See also Gen. 9:3 ‘I give you everything’ (nātattî lākĕm ʾĕt-kol ). 34) Cf. Taylor’s (2003: 590) defijinition of metonymy: “The process by which an expression which ‘basically’ designates entity e, comes to be used of an entity closely associated with e, within a given domain, as in I (=my name and phone number) am in the telephone book.”

with God, represents God’s might and enduring power, and his transport of the bow in the clouds over the earth represents his transfer of power over the earth to the living beings on earth. This bow is not a weapon of protection, but a weapon of attack of a victorious fijighter and God’s abdication from his weapon can serve as an efffective metonymic concept of his handing over power.
Conclusion: The Bow in Genesis 9
Because Gen. 9:8-17 uses the word qĕšĕt in relation to the deity and to the clouds, the inference has been made in biblical scholarship that the text refers to a rainbow. The plausibility of this inference is tested in this article. Linguistic, textual, iconographic, intertextual, and comparative literary data and arguments are given in favour of the view that the word qĕšĕt designates a [warrior’s bow] and fijigures in the cognitive domains of [war] and [dominion], while including conceptual components such as [weapon of attack], [arrow], [enemy], [victorious weapon of a winning warrior] and [power]. The analysis of the composite semantic structure of Gen. 9:8-17 showed that God’s qĕšĕt is closely linked to its owner as the victorious deity and his weapon represents his enduring power. God’s establishing of his covenant with those living on earth and his berît in combination with the preposition ʾĕt express [bond], [sharing] and [togetherness]. The positioning of his warrior’s bow in the clouds that are covering the earth and its function as the ʾôt-habberît collocated with the preposition bên describe the [distance] between God and the earth as well as the [transfer of power]. In other words, the establishing of the covenant stands for God’s willingness to share his rule over the earth with those living on it, while his setting of the bow in the clouds stands for God’s actual transfer of his power over the earth to those living on earth. Whether or not God’s setting a bow at a distance implies the notion of [bow star] is impossible to say. It might indicate that God places his weapon-bow in the sky so that it has become the constellation Canis Maior (or Canis Minor), as in Mesopotamian literature, or it may not. No further indications are found in the text of Genesis 9. It is the individuality of the bow and the individuality of the covenant as well as the superiority of the powerful party that stands over against the extensive earth as a whole that characterizes this text. The powerful deity transports his weapon of attack into the clouds over the earth as a sign of his covenant with the human beings and the other living beings on earth, as a sign of his abdication of his weapon of attack and a transfer of power. With the handing



148 E. van Wolde / Vetus Testamentum 63 (2013) 124-149
over of his mighty weapon he demonstrates that he will never again attack and destroy all living beings on earth. He will never again use a flood to exercise power. From now on, the descendants of Noah, the human race and the living beings with them, are made responsible for the dominion over the earth.
