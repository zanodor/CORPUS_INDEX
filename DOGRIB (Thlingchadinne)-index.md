DOGRIB (Thlingchadinne)
Dogrib legend has it that the tribe originated from the union of a
woman and a sorcerer, who was a man in day
Thlingchadinne, meaning “dog-flank people.” The Dogrib First Nation
is also now known by the shortened form Tli Cho or Tlicho.
The various Dogrib bands inhabited a vast region between Great
Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake in the present-day Northwest
Territories of northern Canada. They are classified as northern
ATHAPASCANS based on language and as SUBARCTIC INDIANS
based on location and lifeways. The CHIPEWYAN living to their
southeast, the YELLOWKNIFE (tatSANOTTINE) to their east, and the
SLAVEY (etCHAREOTTINE) to their south—all Athapascans—were
their rivals. The Dogrib also fought with the CREE to the south, who
were Algonquian-speaking, and the INUIT to the east and northeast.
The Dogrib lived in autonomous nomadic bands, each with a
headman and a hunting and fishing territory. Caribou, moose, musk
ox, hare, and birds were their primary foods. They preferred meat
over fish, but they caught whitefish, trout, and other species in
willow bark nets. Caribou also provided clothing and coverings
for portable cone-shaped tents similar to those of the Chipewyan.
Some Dogrib bands instead used poles and brush to make winter
huts that resembled the dwellings of the hare (kawchotTINE) and
other Athapascans to the north. Dogrib canoes of spruce bark, or
birch bark when it was available, unlike those of neighboring
tribes, had decking at the bow and stern, at least by
postcontact times.
Among many of the northern Athapascans, it was customary for a
father to drop his name after the birth of his first child, becoming



known thereafter as “father of. . . .” Dogrib fathers, however,
changed their names following the birth of each child. Their women
enjoyed better status than women of other Subarctic tribes, but the
old and sick were abandoned in times of hardship. Shamans healed
the sick and prophesized the future. The Dogrib believed that spirits
resided in nature, and, as was the case with many Native Americans,
guardian spirits were sought in dreams and visions. Like other
Subarctic peoples, they buried their dead on scaffolds. Family
and even band members destroyed their property in mourning;
women cut themselves. A year after the funeral, a memorial feast
was held.
The Dogrib had contact with non-Indian traders as early as 1744,
despite efforts by the Chipewyan to prevent their access to non
Indian trading posts. In the late 18 th century and part of the 19th
century, the Dogrib were dominated by the Yellowknife. In 1823, a
Dogrib war party attacked the Yellowknife near Great Bear
Lake, forcing them to withdraw from the region and leading to their
absorption by the Chipewyan. Some Dogrib merged with Hare and
Slavey around Great Bear Lake, becoming known as Sahtu Dene, or
Bear Lake Indians, who traded regularly with Hudsonʼs Bay Company
representatives at Fort Franklin, founded in 1825. Fort Rae, founded
by the Hudsonʼs Bay Company in 1852 on the northern arm of the
Great Slave Lake, became the center of trading activity for most
Dogrib bands, who collected muskrat, mink, fox, and other furs in
exchange for European trade goods. The Dogrib remained an
isolated people until the mid-20th century, at which
time improvements in transportation and communication led to
increased contacts with other Canadians.
In August 2003, the Dogrib signed a land-claims agreement with the
Canadian government in which the various Dogrib bands
collectively known as Tli Cho First Nation—received some 25,000



square miles north of Yellowknife between the Great Bear Lake and
Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. The new Tli Cho
government will also receive $152 million in payments over 15 years.
Four legislative bodies govern the regionʼs communities; the chiefs
must be Tli Cho, although anyone may run for councillor and vote.
The Tli Cho have control over their language and culture as well as
taxation, resource royalties, social services, liquor laws, licensing
healers, and land management, including hunting, fishing, and
industrial development. The central government controls criminal
law, and the territorial government controls services such as health
care and education. Unlike in the case of Nunavut, created in 1999,
and the homeland mostly of Inuit, the Tli Cho land settlement does
not create a new territory.
