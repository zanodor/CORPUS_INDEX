Astrotheology and how to know thyself
A summary of the lectures of Santos Bonacci By Jacqueline Tull and Johan Oldenkamp
Astrotheology is the holy science that combines astrology, astronomy and theology. This holy science shows that in fact all myths, all story's, the bible and all other holy scriptures, and even nursery rhymes are based on the movement and interaction of the seven lights we see in the sky. These seven lights we know as the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They are the lights our eyes can see wandering in front of the fixed background of the stars. These are the main characters that create patterns in the sky, which have an effect on our lives here on Earth or Terra. “As above, so below”.
The brightest of these seven lights is the Sun also know as “Helios” in Greece and as “Helios Atum” in ancient Egypt. “Atum” sounds like “atom” and it is in fact the same because the sun is an atom. It has an electric light core and electron bodies floating around it.
Plato said that the Sun is “the cause of our knowledge, without it we cannot see”. So the Sun is the teacher of the sense of the sight and the ruler of our eyes. The Sun is the “lucent” one, or “Lucifer”.
In ancient Egyptian mythology, the name of the “Sun” god was “Ra”, the one who “ra”diates. In churches, you will often see the letters “IHS” on books, altars, baptismal fonts etc. always pictured with a symbol of the sun around it. IHS stands for the Greek letters “iota”, “eta” and “sigma”. Writing in our alphabet, “IHS” equals “JHS” or “JHC”. The pronunciation of this word is “JES”, which is a shorthand for “Jesus”. Jesus and the sun are the same. Jesus is the sun! Jesus Christ is God’s sun. The sun is the risen savior. So this “IHS” is a Christogram, a monogram which is an abbreviation of the name of “Jesus”. The early Christians were called: “Helionostics” which means “Those who have knowledge of the Sun”.
In Hebrew “yes”, or “jes” means fire or the sun! The name of the sun in Hebrew is Michael, or Emanuel. In India, it is: Krishna, Brahma, Shiva or Jes-Christna. In Egypt, it is: Ra, Horus, Seth, Atum, Aman. In the “Nag Hammadi” teachings is written that: “Christ is the true life and the sun of life”.
St Patrick (390 AD): “The true Christ is the sun “. Predulian (363 AD): “The sun is the center of the solar system”. Eraneus: “The Gnostics really declared that all the supernatural transactions in the gospels were counterparts of what took place in the sky and heavens”.
Leonardo Davinci: “I could wish that I had such power of language as should avail me to assure those who would set the worship of man above that of the sun. Those who wish to worship man (an historical Christ) make a huge error! “
In the bible, Jesus says: “I'm the light of the world, every eye will see me”. Bible - Simon: “For the Lord God is a sun and a shield”. Bible - Psalm 48: 11: “The Lord is a shield and a sun”. Bible - John 4: 8: “God is love”. Bible - John 1: 5: “God is light: . Bible - Hebrews 12: 12: “For our God is a consuming fire”.

The sun is also called the “seven-ray God”, because of the seven colors of the rainbow. The planets are the atoms of the sun and so are we, that's why we call are children “youngsters”, meaning young stars. All planets reflect the light of the sun. The sun is the only light which gives us direct light and photons, the other lights are reflectors.
Through astrotheology, it will become very clear that the biggest lie ever told in history (“his story”) is that Jesus Christ was an historical person.
All the story's, the bible and all myths, they all mean the same thing. They describe the relation between the Sun and the Earth, the day and the night, the summer and the winter, storm and calm, good and evil. All characters in these stories are the characters of the solar system. Astrotheology is the source of all of them and our true religion is the natural cycle of nature.
These seven characters are the Sun (Helios or Jesus), the Moon (Luna, Selene), Mercury (Hermes, Thoth), Venus (Aphrodite), Mars (Ares), Jupiter (Zeus) and Saturn (Chronos). The seven days of the week are named after these seven lights or characters.
In the bible the relationship between for example Abraham and Sarah and Jesus and Maria Magdalene both represent the interaction between the sun and the moon.
The seven lights also have a connection with the seven energy wheels, the chakra's in our body. The seven light are also known as the Elohim. In the bible, we can read that the Elohim say: “let us make man after our image”.
A lot of stars are called, when translated: “the one who's coming”, because they keep moving, coming and going in a year’s time. Illustrating examples of this are Perseus in Aries and Herculus.
The moon connects with our first chakra, Mercury with our second, Venus with our third, the Sun with our fourth, which is in the middle, our hart chakra, Mars with our fifth, Jupiter with our sixth and Saturn with our seventh chakra, which is our crown chakra. Our purpose in life is to activate these seven powers.
The moon is closest to the Earth and has an orbit of approximately 291⁄2 days while Saturn is the furthest away from Earth and orbits the Sun in approximately 291⁄2 years. In other words, Saturn “rules”. “Chronos” is the personification of time, the man turning the Zodiac Wheel, also known as Aeon (eternal time).
Saturn is the ruler of the ears because when there is minimum sunlight we depend on our hearing more than on our eyes. Saturn is the “God of law”. In court, they use a lot of “Latin language”, this is the language of Satan/Saturn.
The three wheels of time are: o The Day (the Latin word is “Deis”), ruled by the God of day which is the Sun. o The Year: which comes from the name of the Sun: IHS, JHS, jes, Yes, Yeah, Year. o The Great Year: a time cycle of 24000 – 26000 years.
The Moon gives us the month and the minute. “Hours” comes from Horus, which is the name of the Sun when it rises: “Where is Horus?” meaning “what hour is it?”.

The Day, the Year and the Great Year can all be divided into 4 parts. The day: morning, midday, afternoon, and night. The Year: winter, spring, summer, and fall. The Great Year: Iron, Bronze, Silver and Golden age.
By understanding these cycles, we understand why history went from good to bad and from bad to good. Day-night, winter-summer, Iron-Golden age, all these cycles dominate us!
Astrophysics and astronomy have proven that almost 90% and probably 100 % of all stars are in a binary. All stars need a dual. Our Sun Helios (Horus or Jesus) is also in a binary with another star. The star Sirius, which is in the constellation of Canis Major (the big dog), is in a binary with our sun, or “follows” our sun. Our year starts at January the first because of the alignment of the Sun, Sirius and the Earth.
It takes between 24000 and 25920 years for Sirius and Helios (Horus, Jesus) to complete one circle. The Pyramids in Egypt also indicate that there is a binary between Sirius and the Sun. One of the shafts in the great pyramid points directly to Sirius.
George R. Goodman (early 1900): “Our entire solar system with all its planets and moons describes a huge circle around another sun in space, the star Sirius”.
Albert Churchwood: our sun was thrown of from another sun”.
Sirius is also known by the Egytians as “the star of Isis”. The goddes Isis is embodied by the star of Sirius, like her son Horus is embodied by our sun Helios. This means in fact that our sun was born from Isis or Sirius, and that is why they are in a binary together. Therefore, Isis and Horus are the same characters as Jesus and Mary and are in fact the Sun and Sirius moving away from each other and moving towards each other in their binary.
All heavenly bodies in our solar system have relationships with each other. Also do planets and star constellations harmonize with our bodies. The Zodiac Wheel shows us how this holy science works. The life of Jesus represents the sun moving through the 12 signs of the Zodiac.
The 12 signs are the 12 potential energies which harmonize with the five basic energies or elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Aether. The 12 signs also harmonize with the seven chakra's. Each of the 12 star signs represents a part of our body. The 12 star signs also represent the 12 apostles in the bible.
When you study ancient maps of the world, you'll see a wave in the middle of the earth moving around the equator, this is called a sine-wave. It is the path of the sun moving through the 12 constellations. This is a fractal of everything. It is the “man in the sky”.
The “man in the sky” is Adam Kadmon, the first being to emerge with the creation of the Cosmos. His body is the body of the world. “As above so below”, so it also represents our human bodies.
When you place the sine-wave over the body of Adam Kadmon, you'll see the relation of the body with each star sign. For instance, the constellation of Aries rules the head, the constellation of Tauries rules the neck, the constellation of Gemini rules the shoulders and lungs and so on. By knowing this and by knowing your birth chart, you'll know yourself (see also this paper of the Pateo Academia: http://www.pateo.nl/PDF/Astrotheology.pdf).

Traditional Christans, and especially the Vatican, call this holy science or knowledge “from the devil” and do everything they can to keep you away from these insights. The reason for this is obvious: when we start to know ourselves, we become more conscious of our rights and they can no longer control us the way they did for centuries, and they will lose their power.
The catholic church is the church of Christ (the sun) but also the church of Peter (Jupiter, JuPeter) and the church of Satan (Saturn). It is in fact a Saturnian church, a Latin Church, they use a lot of Latin words in their rules and laws.
The Sun and Saturn are Jesus and Satan, and they are at war with each other like all twins in the bible; Cain and Abel, Jacob and Ezau, Horus and Seth.
The Sun is the hottest and Satan (Saturn) is the coldest. The sun is our savior. Satan represents the wintertime, the Iron age and the night. The Sun Jesus brings us light, love and life, and spring and summer.
There is also a war going on for a very long time now between religion and science. Religion = theology, and Science = philosophy. Theos = god = male. Sophia = goddess = female.
Theology is about “morals, “ignorance” and “doctrine”. In fact it tells you to ‘just believe” and then you will be saved, that is if you “don't question anything”. In philosophy (love of wisdom) we see “logic” (how do I know the world?), “ethics” (how do I live in it?) and “physics” (how is the world made?).
“The bible is there to enslave fools and to enlighten the wise ones.” (Santos Bonacci).
Giordano Bruno (killed brutally by “Christians” in 1600) who was a philosopher, said: “we have to go back to the real Christianity, the religion of Egypt”. “The bible must not be taken literally”.
In the time cycle of the Year on the 21st of March, when the sun enters the constellation of Aries, the sun is “Horus” or Jesus on his way to the “enthronement”. On June 21st, where it will be “Ra”, because then it radiates the most light.
In the time cycle of the Day, Horus represents the moment of sunrise around 6 am. At noon, the sun will be Ra since the sun then radiates the most light.
In the time cycle of the Great Year, the sun is about to leave the period of the Iron Age to enter the Golden Age. Then we will also move into the Age of Aquarius and at the same time leave the age of Pisces after about 2000 years.
In everything, we see the principle of resistance: night and day, good and evil, winter and summer, Jesus and Satan, male and female, electric and magnetic. This duality is necessary!
Everything in the Universe is electric or magnetic. Electricity radiates and magnetism contracts.
The Sun (Jesus) is electric and Saturn (Satan) is magnetic. The sun is the religion of seeing (without the sun you cannot see) and Saturn is the religion of hearing (teaches you about the sixth sense and intuition). Saturn represents the night in which we have to depend more on our

hearing than on our seeing, therefore he's also called “the black Sun”. Saturn is the ruler of the ears (earrings, lord of the rings), the god of law, the king (the longest cycle around the sun). In court, they use the Latin language, the language of Saturn. We live in the age of Saturn or Chronos (which means time), because we live in the age of time. Time eats of its children like Chronos in Greek mythology ate his children.
Saturn does to the sun what the moon does to the Earth. The moon orbits the Earth in 29,5 days and Saturn orbits the sun in 29,5 years. The moon pulls the Earth and Saturn pulls the sun. That is why Saturn and the Sun are twin brothers.
Astrotheology tells you how these principles work, about “the gospel in the sky”, about the agricultural year, what season it is, what weather is, what parts of your body you need to give attention, what type of character you are and how to raise your consciousness.
The year actually starts at March 21st,when the sun is leaving the dark, the wintertime, to climb the mountain in order to be enthroned at June 21st at its highest point of radiation (Ra). On March 21st, we celebrate going into the promised land (like Abraham and Sarah) or heaven. We now have longer days and shorter nights. We can grow things and harvest.
The sine wave in the Northern hemisphere is the part where we see the sun walking through the constellations of Aries, Taurus and Gemini. In Aries the sun is a little boy, in Taurus he is the 'rock', and Gemini represents the duality of the sun/Jesus. On June 21st, he will be crowned. The bible tells the story of Jesus entering Jerusalem on this day riding the backs of two donkeys. In the constellation of Cancer, we see two stars “Asselus Borealis” and “Asselus Australis”, also know as “the two donkey's”. So when the sun enters the constellation of Cancer on June 21st, he is in conjunction with or “riding” the two donkeys.
Jesus, the sun, eventually will be betrayed, it has to move sideways (like a crab, cancer) through the constellations of Cancer, Leo and Virgo, moving away from summer, the day or life, and will be going through “fall”(or autumn /atom) as it “falls” from Virgo to Libra. When the “fall”, the autumn, starts at September 21st, all leaves, trees and earth will turn red and the sun (Jesus/Horus) gets betrayed because we now have shorter days and longer nights! Horus, the sun, is now his brother Seth, the sun is setting. This is the “Red Sea”, Moses (or Jesus) will have to go through in order to reach the promised land again. The Red Sea is represented by the Zodiac signs: Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. Our bloodstream also can be seen as the “red sea”, and actually there is no difference between our human blood and ocean water, it's the same structure.
When the Israelites were passing the Red Sea, it means our bodies are passing the “red blood” (our soul is in our blood). It also means that we are walking through blood and we are having a blood experience.
The 12 signs of the Zodiac are the 12 tribes of Israel. Is Ra El; Isis-Ra-Saturn.
On September 21st, it is Jewish Judgement day.Then the sun is entering the constellation of Libra, the scales of justice. On this day, we will be judged. Before this happens, the sun is in the constellation of Virgo (the holy virgin). Virgo is holding a sheaf of grain in her hands, it is now time for harvesting (The bread of Christ). The opposite sign is that of the constellation of Pisces, which represents the fish of Christ. Christianity for the past 2000 years has used as main symbols “fish and bread”.

When the sun is in Libra, the wine season starts. Virgo and Libra represent the wine and the bread. The equinoxal point of the Zodiac on September the 21st is also called “the tree of knowledge of good and evil”. On this point, we have vision to the promised land and we also are entering and seeing the winter time in which it is cold and dark. We see both good and evil.
September the 21st is an equinoxial day, the day and night are equally long. March 21st is the other equinoxial day. The solstice days are June 21st and December 21st. The sun will “stand still or dies” for 3 days on those days. The two equinoxal days and the two solstices embody the “cross” on which Jesus, the sun died. On December the 21st, the sun dies: it is midnight and he is born again on December the 25th, on “Christmas day”. The sun begins his path to the Promised Land again from this point where Jesus (or Moses) is going through the “red sea”. He is the unconquered sun. He dies at December the 21st, but stays unconquered!
March 21st is the door to the “Kingdom of Heaven”. September 21st is the door to the “Kingdom of Hell”. On March 25th, Gabriel told Mary: “thou shall conceive”. Nine months further, the sun is born on December the 25th in the constellation of Capricorn. In this constellation we find two stars “Al Shat” and “Nashira” meaning “the sheep” or the “flock'” and the “shepherd”.
Gabriel is in fact Mercury who is nearest to the sun. He is the messenger. Bible - Luke 1: 19: “I am Gabriel who stands in Gods presence and has been sent to speek to you to bring this good news.” Verse 38: Virgo calls herself “the handmaid of God”. Mary or Virgo is always next to the cross (the equinoxes - solstices cross). The MI symbol of the zodiac Virgo means “Isis”.
In the bible Elizabeth told Mary (Virgo) “blesses is the fruit of your womb”. Which is strange, since why didn't she say child? Probably because the Virgo season is about bread and wine.
The equinoxes are also called “trees” or “pillars”. (Think about Eve when the serpent tempted her to eat from the tree of good and evil knowledge, in the bible book of Genesis.)
The constellation of Ophuicius is the snake barer or the serpent that talks to Eve (which is Virgo) and says: “eat of the tree”. This is actually the sun going through Virgo. If you eat from the tree you'll die, which the sun does after September 21st. In other words; it has to be !
We enter different worlds all the time. We go from electricity to magnetism, from day to night, from good to bad, exactly like a sine wave.
So you can say that Satan kills his twin brother Jesus on December 21st. This story of the twin brothers is literalized in the bible. December the 21st is also known as St Thomas Day. Thomas is Osiris or Satan. Saturn/Satan rules Capricorn and when the Sun/Jesus enters this sign he will be killed.. The Sun always dies in “hell” (= heal of Achilles) or in “inferno” (inverno means winter in Greek) by the arrow of Sagittarius.
There are four gospels in the bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, like there are four seasons, four elements, four blood types, etc. All gospels are based on the star constellations of the Zodiac !

When the sun “passes” over on March 21st from the red sea, we eat the lam in order to free us from the sin of man (sun enters Aries) and celebrate Pesach, Passover, Pasen in Dutch or Eastern because the sun is in the East.
Bible - Genesis 1: verse 12: “..and I have placed the stars in the sky for signs and seasons..”
Albertius Magnus (1200 bc, catholic church doctor): “all the mysteries of the incarnation of our savior Christ and all circumstances of his marvelous life from the conception to his ascension are to be traced out in the constellations and are figured in the stars.”
The sun gives us life, love, light, he is the lord. The Sun/Jesus synchronizes with our hart chakra in which is our “Christ consciousness” as Christ is the Sun. Our hart chakra is the center chakra like the sun is the center of our solar system.
“El”or “Al” is Saturn. A lot of Christian words and names begin or start with “el”or “al”, like chapel, Israel, cathedral, evangel, angel, elite, elohim, Michael, Rafael, elder, Elizabeth, (e)Louis, Helen, Selene, Elaine, Emanuel, Ramona, Daniel, Michael, Don etc. Everyone wants to call themselves after the sun like Ramses (from Ra), Napoleon, Seti (means “Sun”) who is the father of Ramses. Royal comes from Ra. In fact more than 60% of all historian names go back to one of the seven lights !
A lot of cities are named after one of the stars or planets; for example Rome is named after “Ra”. It’s ancient name is Saturnia, after Saturn. Paris is “Isis” (Sirius) and London starts with an El meaning Saturn.
Plato: “The Milky Way is the Nile in the Sky, that is where we come from.” The Milky Way is also the “Feathered Serpent” for whom the Mayans built there Kulkulkan pyramid in Chitzén Itza. When you view certain pictures of the center of the Milky Way galaxy you'll see a serpent biting its own tail, the Ouro Bouros.
Macrobius, in his book commentary on Scipio’s Dream, 12th chapter: “Our souls come from the Milky Way, the milk, the mother, our Milky Way galaxy is Isis. It is femine and her partner is Andromeda our next door galaxy (“andro” means husband in the Greek language).
“Jacob’s ladder” is the ladder from which our souls descend into this Earth to have a human experience. We enter the solar system via the rings of Saturn and via Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury we will be born from the womb of the moon into our physical bodies. So you could say we are all baptized here on Earth with a body. The Christ “that came into the flesh”is the consciousness that mankind posesses.
When we go from the age of Pisces into the age of Aquarius, we will get a higher doses of this “Christ” consciousness. We will then go from “mutable Water” (Pisces) to “fixed Air” (Aquarius). The fifth element “Aether” is the course. All other four elements come from Aether. The element “Fire” is the first born from Aether which means “the fires in the sky” or electricity. From “Fire” comes “Air”, from “Air” comes “Water”, and from “Water” comes “Earth”.
Walter Russel: “Electricity is the only source God uses to create the Universe”.

If we know who through studying Astrotheology and know that the seven lights are directly connected to our chakra's and we know how to lift our kundalini energy, then we will be (one of) the 144.000 (the number that shows up in almost all religions).
The chakra's correspond with numbers. The 1st chakra is number 4, the 2nd chakra is number 6, the 3rd chakra is number 10, the fourth / hart chakra is number 12, the 5th chakra is number 16, the 6th chakra is number 96. Adding up these numbers gives the number 144. The 7th chakra is a 1000 times that number which gives the total number 144.000.
Bible - Revelation chapter 14: “Next in my vision, I saw mount Zion and standing on it a lam who had with it a 144.000 people all with his name and his fathers name an their foreheads.”
On the jade mask of Maya king Pacal you'll also find the number of 144.000 on its forehead (book: The supergods by Maurice Cotterel).
The 7 chakra's are equivalent to the 10 Sephiroth of the Kabbalistic tree. The tree of life is in you ! You are the Christ ! That is what the apostle Paul talks about when he says “the Christ within”.
We have to know who we are and where we come from, in order to know our real rights on this planet! The Catholic Church, and especially the Vatican and its cardinals, have poisoned us with a lot of lies about an historical Christ, false religion, false science and false law. The Vatican is a corporation.
Our birth certificate is in fact our “baptism” into the Catholic Church! We are all baptized. We must realize that we ourselves are the shareholder of our own cooperation via our birth certificate. We need to reclaim that position in order to bring real justice to the world !
By practising Astrotheology, you'll know who you are. You have to know your ruling sign an your ascendant and these are in fact the “gods” you have to devote yourself to. When you know the stars, then you know what “the stars” on Earth are doing.
“Know thyself”...
