Abstract
According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book ‘The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective’ published by the OECD Development Center in Paris in 2001, India had the world’s largest economy in the 1st century and 11th century and in the 18th century, with a 32.9% share of the world GDP in the 1st century and 28.9 % in the 1000 AD, and in 1700 AD with 24.4% .India was always perceived in the western world as a country known for spiritualism and philosophy, art and letters. Its material development and pursuit of science, technology and business were systematically ignored in western treaties on the
subject. The present paper aims at having an understanding of the ancient roots of modern business practices in India.



The present paper is extracted from the ongoing research project on “Indigenous
Management: Insights from Traditional Knowledge, Culture and Heritage” (2012-2017) by Sunita Singh Sengupta on behalf of VFIM (A unit of ISOL Research Foundation).
Wealth and Prosperity in Ancient India
The highly flourishing trade and commerce made the country enormously wealthy and the reputation of the riches of India spread far and wide. Hiuen Tsang says with regard to Valabhi that “there are some hundred houses (families) or so who possesses a hundred lakhs. The rare and valuable products of distant regions are here stored in great quantities.” Similar accounts of the enormous wealth of India are given by the Muhammadan writers. ‘The immense wealth,’ ‘plenty of gold’ etc. of India are referred in to in general terms by the Arab travellers of the ninth and following centuries.
Again the Arab historians refer to the enormous quantity of wealth plundered by the Muhammadan conquerors from India. Thus we are told that after the fall of Multan, Muhammad Ibn Qasim obtained a treasure amounting to thirteen thousand and two hundred manas weight of gold in one temple alone. Again, when Sultan Mahmood conquered Bhim Nagar (Kangra), a contemporary writer records that the “treasures and precious jewels accumulated in it had attained such an amount that the backs of camels would not carry it, nor vessels contain it, nor writer’s hand record it, nor the imagination of an arithmetician conceive it.” Coming to details he says: “The Treasures were laden on the backs of as many camels as they could procure and the officers carried away the rest. The stamped coins amounted to seventeen thousand thousand royal dirhams, and the gold and silver ingots amounted to seven hundred thousand four hundred manas in weight.” The Sultan on reaching Ghazni spread his booty on a carpet in the courtyard of his place, and the foreign ambassadors assembled to see the wealth which they had never yet even read of in books of ancients, and which had never been accumulated by kings of Persia or of Rum, or even by Karun who had only to express a wish and God granted it.” Such is the description of the wealth of a single temple which was by no means the richest in India, for the same writer says with regards to the riches plundered at Thaneshwar that “it is impossible to recount them.” Similar stories of riches untold are narrated with regard to the stack of other cities. By the treaty between Alauddin Khilji and Yadava king of Devagiri, the latter paid, among other things, “600 maunds of pearls, two of jewels and 1000 of silver.” These accounts may be exaggerated to some extent, but they suffice to give a general idea of the immense riches of the country (Majumdar, 1977, p.456-457).
Economic History of Ancient India



The known economic history of India begins with Indus Valley Civilization that was the first known permanent and predominantly urban settlement that flourished between 2800BC to 1800 BC and had an advanced and thriving economic system.The cultural heritage of India can be primarily sensed through her philosophy and religion and the sources of her philosophical ideas and religious beliefs lie in the Vedas and the Upanishads. According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book ‘The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective’ published by the OECD Development Center in Paris in 2001, India had the world’s largest economy in the 1st century and 11th century and in the 18th century, with a 32.9% share of the world GDP in the 1st century and 28.9 % in the 1000 AD, and in 1700 AD with 24.4% .
Ancient Indian Corporate Entities: Structure and Functioning
Corporate life was in vogue in India since Vedic times. Rig Vedic society was well organized. Economic life centered rounds the cattle. As for trade and money, we find the Vanik, the trader in the Vedas. Barter system was in vogue. Contracts and haggling were known. Indebtedness was also there. There are also references to sea- borne trade. We find references of the word ganathat meant community and head of the group, or corporate body, was known as ‘Ganapati’. Mention of corporate bodies is found as back as 800 –1000 B.C. Caravans (Sarthas, Sarthavahanas), of merchants that toured the entire sub – continent do find mention in good numbers in early centuries. Guilds were known as srenis or nigamas and these elected mercantile bodies controlled trade and commerce of various commodities. The 50 volumes of the book entitled, “The Sacred Books of the East” edited by F. Max Muller provides an excellent insight into the ancient corporate entities and its functioning in Vedic and post Vedic era.
The co-operation of traders is as old as the time depicted to us in the Jatakas and the general consensus of opinion refers it about 7th Century B.C., if not earlier still. But the institution may probably be traced back to a still earlier period. The term ‘Pani’which occurs several times in the Rig Veda has been differently interpreted by different scholars (Vedic Index, p.471). TheSt.
Petersburgh Dictionary derives it from the root pan ‘to barter’ and explains it as merchant, trader. Ludwig thinks that these “references to fights with Panis are to be explained by their having been aboriginal traders who went in caravans- as in Arab and Northern Africa repaired to fight, if need be, to protect their goods against attacks which the Aryans would naturally deem quite justified.” If we accept this meaning we have necessarily to presume a corporation of merchants, strong enough to defy their opponents and carry on fight against them. Thus the institution of which the existence at about 7 century B.C is proved by the Jatakas may be traced back to the period represented by the hymns of Rigveda. The corporate activity was also manifested, possibly in a far greater degree among the artisans. The frequent reference to the artisans’ guild occurs in several passages of the Brahamanas.
After what has been said above, it seems probable, as Macdonell remarks “that the word may already have the sense of the headman of a guild.” The corporate activity seems to be quite a common feature in the ancient economical system. A close study of ancient literature seems



to indicate that men following similar means of livelihood usually formed themselves into a corporation with definite rules to guide themselves. Thus we find it stated in Gautama X. 49 (Sacred books of the East Series II. P.232) that the additional (occupations) of a Vaisya are, agriculture, trade, tending cattle and lending money at interest. This list must be taken to include at least all the important occupations of the people at large, which were within the purview of the writer, and so it becomes significant when he says in the very next chapter (XI, 21) that “ cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders and artisans (have authority to lay down rulers) for their respective classes. Having learned the (state of) affairs from those who in each case have authority (to speak he shall give) the legal decision” (XI – 20.21 Sacred Books of the East series II. 237). This would mean that practically all the different branches of occupation mentioned above had some sort of definite organisation. This organisation must be looked upon as an important one in as much as its rules were recognised as valid in the eyes of the law and its representatives had a right to be consulted by the king in any affair that concerned it.
The particular term used to denote the corporation of tradesmen or mechanics is Sreni. This is defined as a corporation of people, belonging to the same or different caste but following the same trade and industry. This organisation corresponds to that of the “Guilds” in mediaeval Europe and may be freely rendered by that term. The ancient literature both Buddhist and Brahmanical as well as ancient inscriptions contain frequent references to those guilds, and this corroborates the inference we have deduced from Gautama that nearly all the important branches of industry formed themselves into guilds. Their number must have differed considerably not only in different periods but also in different localities. In the Muga Pakkha Jataka (No 533) the king, while going out in the full splendour of state, is said to have assembled the four castes, the eighteen guilds, and his whole army. This would indicate that the conventional number of different kinds of guilds in a state was set down as eighteen (ct. Also Jataka.VI, 427) It is not possible to determine what these conventional 18 guilds were, but we get a considerably greater number by collecting together all the scattered references in literature and inscriptions.
The following list compiled in this way shows at once the widespread nature of the organisation:
1. Workers in wood (The carpenters, including cabinet makers, wheel wrights, builders of houses, builders of ships and builders of vehicles of all sorts.) (Jataka.VI.427)

Historical Account of Organization and Functioning of Guild in Ancient India
We do not have historical materials to describe the above guilds in detail; however, there is sufficient evidence that supports the prevalence of organisation among each of the above groups leading to the application of the term corporation applicable to it. Below is a successive historical account of the same (Source: Corporate Life in Ancient India by R.C.Majumdar 1994):
1. From Jataka Stories (7th and 6th century B.C) Dr. Richard Fick observes, as quoted by R.C Majumdar (1994, p.5) that there was a clear difference, so far as organisation is concerned, between the traders and merchants on one side and the artisans on the other side. As regard the former, the hereditary families pursuing certain branches of trade no doubt formed themselves into a corporation with a Jetthaka (elder man) at its head, but there is nothing in the Jatakas to show that there was a highly developed organisation among them. Far different was however the case with the artisans. Here the heredity of the profession was a more marked feature than in the case of the traders and merchants; the son was apprenticed to the craft of his father from his early youth, and the manual skill and talent for a particular industry was thus an inheritance of the family from generation to generation. The adoption by an artisan of any occupation other than his hereditary one has never been mentioned in the Jatakas while they contain frequent reference to the son of an artisan following the occupation of his father. The localisation of industry was another important factor in this respect. Streets in the town and sometimes whole villages were inhabited by one class of artisans (cf, dantakara vithi in Jataka.I.320, II.I97; maha vaddhakigamo IV.159, Kammara gamo I11, 281). These villages were sometimes quite large, the Mahavaddhakigamo, for instance consisted of 1000 families of dealers in wood and the Kamma ragamo, the same number of smith huts. Several passages in the Jatakas indicate the importance of these institutions during the period. Jataka Nos. 154 & 387 show that heads of guilds sometimes held high posts in the state and were favourite of the king. Reference is also made to a state officer, the Bhandagarika (Treasurer or Superintendent of Stores) whose office carried with its judgeship of all the merchant guilds.
2. From the Early Dharmasutras (5th Century B.C. to 3rd Century B.C.) The verse 21 of the 11th chapter of Gautama Dharma Sutras, “Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders and artisans (have authority to lay down rules) for their respective classes.” Further in Verse 21 in the same chapter we are further told that “Having learned the (state of) affairs from those who (in each class) have authority (to speak he shall give) legal decision. (The Sacred Book Of East Vol. II, p. 237)
This indicates a further stage of development in the organization of guild. The corporations of traders and artisans are now recognized by the constitution as an important factor in the state, and invested with the highly important power of making laws for themselves.



Kautilya’s Arthashastra (Shamasastra, 1915) throws much interesting light upon the guild organization of ancient period:
- The superintendent of accounts had to regularly enter in prescribed registers, the history of customs, professions and transactions of the corporations (p. 69 ).
- Three Commissioners or three ministers enjoying the confidence of the guild were appointed to receive their deposits which could be taken back in times of distress (p. 253 ).
- Special concessions were made regarding the lawsuits between trade guilds (p.190).
- Special privileges were accorded to a merchant belonging to a trade guild (p. 228)
- The importance of a guild in those days is further indicated by the fact that in an ideal scheme of a city places are reserved for the residents of the guild and corporations of work men. (p. 61).
- The taxes paid by them are included among the most important sources of revenue (p. 66).
- The Village guilds were protected by the regulations that no guilds of any kind other than local cooperative guilds shall find interest into the village. (p. 54)
- The reputed wealth of the guilds and the way in which they were sometimes exploited by unscrupulous kings may be gathered from the Machiavellian policies unfolded.
3. From the Early Dharmasutras (2nd Century B.C. to 4th Century A.D.). The ManuSamhita (VIII 41) refers to Srenidharma or ‘usages of the guild’ as having the force of law. It further lays down that,
If a man belonging to a corporation inhabiting a village or a district (grama desa Samgha) after swearing to an agreement, breaks it through avarice (the king) shall banish him from his realm (VIII- 219).
The Yajnavalkya Samhita also prescribes that if a man steals the property of a guild or any other corporation or breaks any agreement with it, he shall be banished from the realm and all his property confiscated (II.187, 192).



Similar injunctions are also found in the Institutes of Vishnu (Vishnu Samhita 168): He who violates their established rule (shall) also (be banished) (The Sacred Book of East, Volume VII).
Shortly after Christian era these guild organization developed into highly important factor of state politics. Not only is it now recognized as a definite part of the state fabric, but its authority is upheld by that of the state, and its prestige and status considerably enhanced, by the definite proclamation of the state policy to guarantee its successful existence by affording it all timely need and assistance.
The result of this happy state of things was a further development of these organizations on the one hand and an increased confidence of the public in their utility, on the other (Majumdar, 1994, p.8).
There are altogether five inscriptions belonging to this period which distinctly refer to the guilds and their activities:
1. An inscription in a cave at Nasik (Luder’s list of Brahm Inscriptons in Epigraphia Indica. Vol X. Appendix 1133) dated in the year 42 (=120 A.D.) records the donation of 3000 Karshapanas by Ushavadata, son – in- law of the Saka Chief Nahapana. The gift was intended for the benefit of the Buddhist monks dwelling in the cave and the entire sum was invested in the guilds dwelling at Govardhana in the following manner:
(a) 2000 in a weavers’ guild, the rate of interest being one per cent per month.
(b) 1000 in another weavers’ guild at the rate of 3⁄4 per cent per month. It is clearly stated that these Kahapanas are not to be repaid, their interest only to be enjoyed. The object of the gift is also laid down as follows:
The 2000 Kahapanas at 1 per cent per month are the cloth money; out of them is to be supplied, to every one of the twenty monks who keep the Vassa or retreat in the cave, a cloth money for Kusana, a term the precise significance of which is uncertain.
In conclusion we are told that all this has been proclaimed (and) registered at the town’s hall, at the record office, according to custom. (Epigraphia Indica.VIII P.82 ff)



2. Another Inscription at Nasik (Luder’s list of Brahm Inscriptons in Epigraphia Indica. Vol X. Appendix. II37) dated in the 9th years of king Isvarasena, who ruled in the 3rd C.A.D (Rapson Andhra coins P. xxxiv) records the investment of a similar perpetual endowment with the guilds dwelling at Govardhana, as follows:
“In the hands of the guilds of Kularikas (probably potters) one thousand Karshapanas of the guild of odayantrikas (probably workers fabricating hydraulic engines, water clocks or others) two thousand. The last portion of the inscription is mutilated, but enough remains to show that an amount was also invested with the guild of oil millers, and the sum of 500 Kathapanas with another guild. The object of this endowment was to provide medicines for the sick of the Samgha of moks dwelling in the monastery on mount Trisami (Epigraphia Indica. VIII. P.88)
3. An inscription at Junnar (Luder’s list of Brahm Inscriptons in Epigraphia Indica. Vol X. Appendix. II62) records the investment of the income of two fields with the guild at Konachika respectively for planting Karanja Trees and Banyan trees.
4. Another inscription at Junnar (Luder’s list of Brahm Inscriptons in Epigraphia Indica. Vol X. Appendix.1165) records the investment of money with the guild of bamboo workers and the guild of braziers.
5. A third inscription at Junnar (Luder’s list of Brahm Inscriptons in Epigraphia Indica. Vol X. Appendix. 1180) records the gift of a cave and a cistern by the guild of corn dealers.
The five inscriptions quoted above throw abundance light on the function and organization of the ancient guild. The inscription quoted from nos. 1-4 conclusively show that the guilds in ancient days received deposits of public money and paid regular interest on them. They must have been serving the function of modern banks.The inscription no. 1 shows that the rate of interest which they paid varied between 12 and 9 percent. The guild which thus operated as a net-work of banks throughout the length and breadth of the country must have possessed a coherent organisation, sufficient to induce the public to trust large sums of money with them. They must have been of long standing and their operations characterised by honesty and fair dealing, for otherwise men would scarcely have made perpetual endowments with them. The concluding portions of no. 1 suggests that they were recognised as an important factor in the municipal government of ancient cities and were responsible to the corporations of the town for the due discharge of their duties as trusties of public money. They received not merely deposits in cash, but also endowment of property as is clear from the inscription no.3.



The object with which these endowments were made seemed to be manifold and hence the due performance of them must have required extra professional skills. The last inscription no. 5 shows that the guilds did not only receive the gifts but also made gifts in the name of corporation.
Some injunctions laid down in the early dharmashastras give us some insights about the working of these guilds. The Yagnavalkya Samhita (Cp 11) reports that the guilds could possess corporate property, and lay down rules and regulations corresponding to the “Articles of Association” of the present day, which it was high treason to violet.The representatives often transacted business with the court in their name and were held in high respect their. Some pure and virtuous men were appointed as their executive officers (Karyachintakkah). It is clear from the line “Karttavyam vachanam tesham samuhahitava linam” that these officers possess executive authority over the members of the corporation and could visit with punishment anyone who disobeyed their decisions. They were bound, however, by the laws and usages of the corporation and if they violated them in the exercise of their authority and there was dissension between them and the general members, the king had to step in and make both parties conform to the established usage. The executive officer, though vested with considerable authority could not thus be autocrats by any means, and there ultimate responsibility to the law and custom was assured, by the instrumentality of the assembly (Majumdar, 1994, p. 12).
Although no mention is made here of the President of the guild, the frequent reference to Sresthin in the contemporary inscriptions shows that there was one; but the real power seems now to have devolved upon the executive officers. Thus the constitution of the guild during this period presented a very modern appearance with a chief and other executive officers responsible to the assembly. The corporate spirit of the guild is most strikingly manifested in the verse 190 which lays down that everything acquired by a man while engaged in the business of the guild (apparently including even gifts from king or other persons) must be paid to the guild itself and anyone failing to do this of his own accord, will have to pay a fine amounting to 11 times its value.
The importance which was attached to guilds and other corporations at this period is best illustrated by the two following facts:
i. The violation of agreements laid down by the corporations (Samvidvyatikrama) is already recorded in YajnaValkya and Manu as one of the recognized titles of law (Manu Samhita viii. 5, Yajnavalkya Samhita, ii § 15).
ii. YajnaValkya lays down the general maxim (Verse 186) that the duties arising from the rules and regulations of the corporation (Samayika), not in consistent with the injunctions of the Sacred Texts, as well as the regulations laid down by the king must be observed with care, thus placing the duty towards the state on an equal footing with that towards the guild.



A few passages may be quoted from Mahabharata that indicates the high importance enjoyed by the guilds in general estimation. Thus, sowing dissensions among the heads of guilds or inciting them to treason is looked upon as a recognized mean of injuring the enemies
kingdom (Santiparva §59 Verse 49 also § 141, Verse 64). The guilds are described as one of the principal supports of the royal power (Asramavasika Parva§ 7 Verses 79). Duryodhana, after his defeat by the Gandharvas, refuses to go back to his capital, for humiliated as he was, he dared not face the heads of the guilds, “What will the heads of guilds (and others)say to me and what shall I tell them in reply?” (Vana Parva § 248, 16). The
Verse in Santi Parva (§ 36 Verse 19) lays down that no amount of expiation can remove the sins of those who forsake their duties to the guild to which they belong.
Thus, the foundations of ancient Indian management was exclusively on moral values and ethics and adherence to it was strongly emphasized and followed.
4. From the Later Dharmasutras (5th – 7th Century A.D.). The progressive advancement of the guild organizations is continued during this period. In Narada Sammhita as well as in Brihaspati Sutra, separate chapters are devoted to the title of law arising out of the transgression of compact (SamvidVyatikrama). Narada
explicitly states that “The king must maintain the usages of the guilds and other
corporations.” “Whatever be their laws, their (religious) duties, (the rules regarding) their attendance, and the (particular mode of) livelihood prescribed for them, that the king shall approve of” (x,2, 3). We are further told that “those who cause dissension among the members of an association shall undergo punishment of a specially severe kind; because they would prove extremely dangerous, like an (epidemic) disease, if they were allowed to go free (X.6)”. These injunctions of the Dharmashastras show in a general way the high importance attached to the guild – organizations as an important factor in society.
Hence, it was fully realized that the value of co-operation lay in the facilities it affords for preventing common dangers and performing common good. It must be a deep rooted consciousness in the public mind about this utility of co-operation that accounts for the growth and development of these guild organizations.
We also learn from the same texts some of the formalities which accompanied the formation of a new guild. According to Brihaspati Sutra the first step towards the organization of a guild was to inspire mutual confidence among the intending members. This was done by one of the following:
i. Kosha. This no doubt refers to the ordeal described in detail in Narada Samhita 1.326-331 and Yajnavalkya 11.114-115. The person to be tested was to drink three mouthfuls of water in which (an image of) ‘the diety whom he holds sacred has been bathed and worshipped. If he should meet himself with any calamity within a week or a fortnight (after having undergone this ordeal) it shall be regarded as proof of his



guilt (Sacred Book of East, Volume XXXIII, p. 116) and otherwise he would be considered pure and of course a worthy member of the guild.
ii. Lekha-Kriya. This probably refers to a convention or agreement laying down the rules and regulations of the guild, to which all must subscribe.
iii. Madhyastha. It is difficult to understand what this really means. It may refer to the practice of a well known man having stood guarantee for the faithful conduct of another.
After having inspired mutual confidence by one or other of these means they set themselves to work. The list of works included various other things besides the strictly professional business and these were probably inserted in a document to which each of the members had to subscribe. Brihaspati contains that the activity of the guilds was extended to a variety of objects of public utility such as the construction of a house of assembly, of a shed for (accommodating travellers with) water, a temple, a pool, and a garden. They also helped the poor people to perform the “Samskaras” or sacrificial acts enjoined by the sacred texts.
The executive machinery which enabled the guilds to perform these multifarious works is also described in some detail in Brihaspati. These was a chief or President, assisted by two, three or five executives officers (XVII 9, 10). Brihaspati says that only the persons who are honest, acquainted with the Vedas and duty, able, self – controlled, sprung from noble families, and skilled in every business, shall be appointed as the executive officers (XVII 9).
Joint Stock Company Functioning in Ancient Guild
The permanent organization of guilds represents the corporate activity in the ancient economic life at its best. The same activity was however displayed in other forms which require to be noticed in some detail, in order to gain a comprehensive idea of the whole thing. Trade carried on on Joint Stock Principles may be mentioned first under this head. This form of corporate activity seems to have been very ancient and we find examples in Jataka stories. For illustration in Chullakasetthi Jataka, (Jataka. I. p. 114) we read about how a young man purchased the contents of a ship, which had just touched at the port, by the deposit of his ring. Shortly afterwards 100 merchants from Benares came for the same purpose, but having been told of the previous transaction they paid him a thousand each and obtained a share of the merchandise along with him. Later they paid him another thousand each, and got the whole merchandise, for themselves, the young man having gone away with 200,000.
In Kutavanijja Jataka (No.98, 1.p. 404) we read of two merchants who entered into partnership and took five hundred wagons of merchandise from Benares to the country districts. The Suhantu Jataka (No. 158, 11.p. 30) refers to ‘the horse dealers of the north’ who apparently carried on their business jointly. In the Introduction to Kuta-Vanija-Jataka No.2 (No. 218.11.p.181) we read of two traders of Sravast who joined partnership and loaded five hundred wagons full of wares, journeying from east to west for trade. The Baveru Jataka (No. 339, III, p. 126) refers to merchants who jointly carried on their trade, and sold



strange Indian birds, at fabulous price, in the kingdom of Baveru. The Maha Vanija – Jataka (No. 493, IV, p. 350) relates this story of a number of merchants who entered into a temporary partnership.
Thus we read,
“Merchants from many a kingdom came, and altogether met. Chose them a chief, and a straight set out a treasure for to get” (Jataka, IV, Translated by Rouse, p.222).
These references from Jataka stories clearly point towards the prevalence of joint transaction of business and shed light on the corporate activities of the traders and merchants in ancient India.
The references of joint stock business are also found in Kautilya’s Arthasastra (p.185), ancient Dharmasastra and Narada. Narada expounds the fundamental principles of this system as, “ The essence of the system thus consisted in the transaction of business, for the purpose of gain, jointly by a number of persons, each of whom contributed towards the common fund that served as the capital of the Company. As this individual contribution formed the real basis of the whole system, Narada declares that the ‘loss, expenses, and profit of each partner are proportioned to the amount contributed by him towards the Joint Stock Company (Narada, p. 133).
Brihaspati Sutra also supports this view but Kautilya’s Arthasashtra and Yajnavalkya Samhita lay down that the profit may be either in proportion to the amount contributed by each or as originally agreed among the partners.
It thus appears that an agreement was drawn up among the partners, intending to carry on business together, in which the general principles upon which the business would be managed were clearly laid down. By virtue of this agreement some of the partners, probably on account of their greater skill and special knowledge, might enjoy a greater share of the profit, than was warranted by the amount of money contributed by them.
It is interesting to note that these essential principles of business were also fully understood in the period represented by the Jataka stories. It is apt to quote references from Kuta Vanija Jataka (No. 98, 1, p.404) where two merchants called ‘Wise’ and ‘Wisest’ entered into partnership and took five hundred wagons of merchandise from Benares to the country districts. There they disposed of their wares, and returned with the proceeds to the city. When the time for dividing came, Wisest said, “I must have a double share”, “Why so?”,
asked Wise. “Because while you are only Wise I am Wisest and Wise ought to have only one share to Wisest’s two”. “But we both had an equal interest in the stock – in – trade and in the oxen and wagons. “Why should you have two shares? “Because I am Wisest.” And so they talked away till they fell to quarrelling. The rest of the story shows how the Wisest tried to impose upon the other but failed, and at last, the two merchants made an equal division of the pafflicted by an illness, ill – fated, or destitute.



The story clearly indicates that while it was accepted as a general principle, that profits should be proportionate to the share that one contributes to the stock-in-trade, the idea of awarding special share for greater skill in business was not altogether unknown.
The success of any Joint Stock Business depends on the individuals that form the Company. Clear injunctions for the selection of partners are laid down in Smiritis. The Brihaspati Sutra contains:
1. Trade or other occupations should not be carried on by prudent men jointly with incompetent or lazy persons, or with such as are afflicted by an illness, ill – fated or destitute.
2. A man should carry on business jointly with persons of noble parentage, clever, active, intelligent, familiar with coins, skilled in revenue and expenditure, honest, and enterprising (The Sacred Book of East, XXXIII – XIV – 1.2)
An idea of the corporate spirit with which the business was carried on may be formed from the following:
Whatever property one partner may give (or lend) authorised by many, or whatever contract he may cause to be executed, all that is considered as having been done by all.
The relation of the individual to the corporate body was also clearly laid down:
1. When a single partner acting without the assent of the other partners or against their express instructions, injures the joint property through his negligence, he must by himself give a compensation to all his partners (also cited in Narada Samhita, IIIp.5; Yajnavalkya Samhita, II,p.253).
In Brihaspati Sutra Section XIV it is mentioned,
2. When any one among them is found out to have practised deceit in a purchase or sale, he must be cleared by oath or ordeal.
3. They are themselves pronounced to be arbitrators and witnesses for one another in doubtful cases, and when a fraudulent act has been discovered, unless a previous feud should exist between them.
Thus the individual was responsible to the corporate body for his negligent acts and his other partners sat in judgement over him or gave evidence in the case. If a charge of fraud was brought against any person, he must be cleared by an ordeal or other tests (Brihaspati Sutra, XIV – 7) and if his guilt was established he should be paid his capital and expelled from the company – his profits being forfeited to it (Yajnavalkya Samhita, II, p. 268).
The Brihaspati Sutra says - On the whole the matter was decided by the corporate body itself, and the guilty individual was not liable to the jurisdiction of any outside authority for his misdeeds. On the other hand his virtue was also rewarded by the same corporate body. That



partner, on the other hand, who by his own efforts preserves the common stock from a danger apprehended through fate or the king shall be allowed a tenth part of it as a reward (Brihaspati Sutra, XIV – 10. Also cited in Narada Samhita, III.6; Yajnavalkya Samhita, II,p. 263).
Further, it states that - Should any such partner in trade happen to die through want of proper care, his goods must be shown and delivered to officers appointed by the king (Brihaspati Sutra, XIV – II; Narad Samhita, III,p.7; Yajnavalkya Samhita, II,p.267).
The comments of Chandesvara on the fourth verse of Narada as quoted above add further, that a partner, if necessary, could draw from the common fund, the amount ofcourse being regulated by the share he paid.
We get sufficient evidences of same principles of partnership being operative in various other arts and crafts. However, the basis of partnership in these cases was the skills and technical knowledge which the partners brought to work.
The Brihaspati Sutra highlights:
1. When goldsmiths or other artists, i.e. workers in silver, thread, wood, stone or leather practise their art jointly they shall share the profits in due proportion, corresponding to the nature of their work (XIV-28).
2. The headman among a number of workmen jointly building a house or temple, or digging a pool or making articles of leather, is entitled to a double share of the remuneration (XIV -29).
3. Among the musicians he who knows how to beat the time shall take a share and half but the singers shall take equal shares (XIV – 30).
It is worthy to note that the priests carried on sacrificial acts and ceremonies on the same principle of partnership (Brihaspati Sutra, XIV – 15; Narad Samhita, III, p. 8-9; Yajnavalyaka Samhita, II, p.268).
Overseas Business in Ancient India
We find several references in Jataka stories about the organization of sea – going merchants. To cite:
1. The Valahassa Jataka (No. 196, 11, p. 127) talks about the story of five hundred merchants with a chief at their head who charted a vessel for trading in Ceylon.
2. The Pandara – Jataka (No. 518, Vishnu Samhita, p.75) refers to the chartering of a vessel by five hundred trading folk.



3. The Supparaka Jataka (No. 463, IV, p. 136) tells us about how 700 merchants got ready a ship and engaged a skipper and the treasure that was gained in course of the voyage was divided amongst them.
We have plenty of references from Jataka stories relating to organizied business in land and overseas. Trade and commerce seemed to be in a flourishing condition as reported by various historians.
R.C. Majumdar, the noted historian quotes, “...Not only was there a coasting trade between different parts of India, but a regular mercantile traffic was carried on between India on the one hand and the Eastern and Western countries on the other. Ships plied between ports on the Bay of Bengal and those in further India, islands in the Indian Archipelago and China. Tamralipti represented by modern Tamluk in Bengal was a famous port and we read of many voyages to it from the Chinese ports. The people of Kalinga and the Tamil States had also a great share in this traffic and there was a regular commercial intercourse between the eastern coast of India and the Indian colonies beyond the sea. Similarly there was a brisk trade between the western coast of India and the western countries such as Western Asia, Africa and Europe” (1977, p.455).
We also have references of foreign travellers. For example, Fa – Hien, who came to this country in the 5th century A.D., sailed from Tamralipti to Java via Ceylon and again from Java to China in Indian merchantmen. Hiuen – Tsang also refers to both inland and foreign trade of India. Referring to Surashtra he says, “the men all derived their livelihood from the sea and engage in commerce and exchange of commodities.” Of the people of another kingdom in the west he says, “Commerce is their principal occupation.” From ninth century A.D. we get accounts of Indian trade from the Arab writers, for at this period the Arabs took a leading part in the trade of the Western world. Numerous clay seals discovered in the ruins of the ancient city of Vaishali bear the names of a large number of traders, bankers and merchants an refer to their corporate organization.
Dr. Bloch (as cited by S.K.Maity in his book The Economic Life of Northern India in Gupta Period, 1957) who discovered them, concludes that “something like a modern Chamber of Commerce existed in Northern India, at some big trading centre, perhaps at Pataliputra.” Similarly the merchants of Southern India were also distinguished for their corporate organizations.
In a Nutshell
The corporate organizations of traders had a rapid growth and in course of two centuries they displayed activities which have a surprisingly modern appearance. Thus Kautilya in his Arthasastra refers to traders who unite in causing rise and fall in the value of articles and live by making profits cent per cent. The corporate organization of the traders survived to a late period in ancient India. An inscription in a temple at Tirumuruganpundi refers to a union of traders in the time of Vikramchola (Government Epigraphist’s Report, 1916, p.121).
Modern Business Corporation and Ancient Corporate Entities



Currently, the modern business corporation is the dominant type of corporation. In addition to its legal personality, the modern business corporation has at least three other legal characteristics as identified by Cooke (1950) and quoted by Singh Sengupta (2011):
(1) Transferable shares
(2) Perpetual succession capacity and
(3) Limited liability
If we consider the characteristics of ancient corporate entities with those of modern organization we find that Sreni had all. Table 1 presents the summary of comparisons.
Table 1 to be here
The sreni was a separate legal entity which had the ability to hold property separately from its owners, construct its own rules for governing the behavior of its members, and for it to contract, sue and be sued in its own name (Quoted in Laws of Manu & Chanakya’s Arthsastra). Some ancient sources have rules for lawsuits between two or more sreni and some sources make reference to a government official (Bhandagarika) who worked as an arbitrator for disputes
Table 1 Summary of The Characteristics of The Sreni
Characteristics of Modern Organization Present in Ancient Indian Sreni
Separate Entity Yes
Centralized Management Yes
Transferability of Interest Probably Yes
Limited Liability Probably Not
Agent has power to bind entity? Yes
Management elected? Yes (though at times appears hereditary)
Can management be removed? Yes
Duty of loyalty Probably Yes
Duty of Care Yes
Liability Insulation Yes (though apparently not very detailed)



Screens on shareholder suits and internal enforcement activity
Yes (though apparently not very detailed)
Internal rules have binding effect Yes
Some reimbursement for legal defense Yes
Formation is easy Yes
Register with state Yes
State approval needed Yes
Use of incentive payments Yes (though apparently not very detailed)
Entry is easy Some conditions, but no caste bars
Sharing of assets and liabilities Terms of agreement and additional rules
Exit is easy Yes, but with obligations potentially
Board / Committee Independence Probably Yes
Other board qualifications Yes (though apparently not very detailed)
Voting Regulation Yes (though apparently not very detailed)
Open debate in meetings and shareholder resolutions
Yes with some limits (though apparently not very detailed)
Transparency is valuable and disclosure is encouraged
Yes (though apparently not very detailed)
Source: Khanna, 2005
amongst sreni from at least the 6th century BC onwards (as quoted in Jataka IV). There were between 18 to 150 sreni at various times in ancient India covering both trading and craft
activities. This level of specialization of occupations is indicative of a developed economy in which the sreni played a critical role. Some sreni could have over 1000 members as there were apparently no upper limits on the number of members (Khanna, 2005).
The sreni had a considerable degree of centralized management. The headman of the sreni represented the interests of the sreni in the king’s court and in many official business matters. The headman could also bind the sreni in contracts, set the conditions of work within the sreni, often received a higher salary, and was the administrative authority within the sreni (Khanna, 2005). The headman was often selected via an election by the members of the sreni, who could also be removed from power by the general assembly. The headman often ran the enterprise with two to five executive officers, who were also elected by the assembly (Khanna, 2005).



The scholars have reported prevalence of Sreni - dharma and the law books containing recommendations to the king that he should enforce these rules. “... In the West the king is believed to be source of all laws. In India the source of law is the Sruti and the Smriti and no human agency can change it” (Vaidya, 1979, p.128). This suggests that the governance of the Sreni is something that people had spent time thinking about by this stage and came up with spiritual foundations of economic development of the state. This also provides us an indication of the prevalence of moral order in managing the guild (Singh Sengupta, 2011).
Characteristics of Ancient Indian Economy
The general characteristics of ancient Indian economics may be stated as twofold:
1. The entire State or the society is more important than the individual. Hence, the individual good may have to be, sometimes, sacrificed for the good of the society as a whole.
2. Economic policies should not generally go against the principles of dharma though it may not always be possible to follow all them strictly.
There are quite a few special characteristics too. They are, according to the Arthasastra of Kautilya (300 B.C) as cited by Swami Harshananda (1998, p.52):
Though the State as a whole should be given supreme importance vis-à-vis the subjects, it was obligatory on its parts to:
1) Treat the subjects as its children and device welfare schemes for them;
2) Help them in periods of crises like war and natural calamities like famine, floods, earthquake etc.
3) Moderate the prices of commodities so that people are not exploited;
4) Control the quality of goods;
5) Help trade and commerce by providing means of transport, communication, security, tax-concessions in foreign trade and so on;
6) Protect agriculture in all its aspects;
7) Create job-opportunities for the people.



The ancient Indian economy, thus, had all the important aspects of a modern welfare state.
According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book ‘The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective’ published by the OECD Development Center in Paris in 2001, India had the world’s largest economy in the 1st century and 11th century, with a 32.9% share of the world GDP in the 1st century and 28.9 % in the 1000 CE (Singh Sengupta, 2011).
The following extract from Hiuen Tsang a foreign and unbiased writer is relevant in this connection
“As the government is honestly administered and the people live together on good terms the criminal class is small”
(Watters,Vol. 1, p.171; quoted by Vaidya, 1979 in p. 112)
The observations of a Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang and the data quoted by a western scholar (Angus Maddison) suggest that Indian economy flourished by practicing moral values. The point to remember is that both are not Indians.
To Conclude
History is full of examples to show that structures, systems, or for that matter, civilizations, without ethico-moral content as their foundation, are sooner rather than later bound to collapse.Thedawnof the newcentury has witnessed anemergingandexponentiallyacceleratingforcefor global societalandorganizationalchange. Most Modern organizations need ideas, inputs and feedback from its employees to sustain and grow in highly competitive environment that they face but various research in past have found that employees frequently remain silent in moments that call for voice- whether about matters relating to employee treatment, patient care, organizational functioning and performance, or the outbreak and spread of corporate scandals and information about illegal and unethical behaviors - all of which suggest that contemporary organizations face considerable counterproductive silence (Singh Sengupta, 2001, 2002).There is an urgent and dire need to address these issues to create a morally healthy business environment for sustainable individual, social and economic growth.
The present paper is a humble effort to search the alternative paradigms in management and leadership by going back to our roots – ancient Indian culture and traditions.
