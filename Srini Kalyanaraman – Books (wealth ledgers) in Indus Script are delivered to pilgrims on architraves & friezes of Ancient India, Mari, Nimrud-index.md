Books (wealth ledgers) in Indus Script are delivered to pilgrims on architraves & friezes of Ancient India, Mari, Nimrud
Indus Script pottige, 'books' are delivered on ப ோதிகை pōtikai 'architraves' of doorways, pillarsand on friezes of processions for pilgrims to see, read, understand meanings and enjoy the documented, written details of heritage of wealth shared and handed down.
ப ோதிகை pōtikai 'architraves' rebus: pottage, pottige 'books'.
Some examples of architraves and friezes with Indus Script meaningful messages are presented in this monograph. Classic examples are
1.Mari marble frieze 2.Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk 3.Sanchi torana
1. Mari Marble frieze 2500 to 2400 BCE (Source: Louvre Museum https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/frieze-mosaic-panel

"In Classical architecture an architrave (/ˈɑːrkɪtreɪv/; from Italian: architrave "chief beam", also called an epistyle; from Greek ἐπίστυλον epistylon "door frame") is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of the columns.The term can also apply to all sides, including the vertical members, of a frame with mouldings around a door or window. The word "architrave" is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings (or other elements) framing the top of a door, window or other rectangular opening, where the horizontal "head" casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join (forming a butt joint, as opposed to a miter joint)." (Ching, Francis D.K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pp. 179, 186)
"In mathematics, a frieze or frieze pattern is a design on a two-dimensional surface that is repetitive in one direction. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. A frieze group is the set of symmetries of a frieze pattern, specifically the set of isometries of the pattern, that is geometric transformations built from rigid motions and reflections that preserve the pattern. The mathematical study of frieze patterns reveals that they can be classified into seven types according to their symmetries." (Coxeter, H. S. M. (1969). Introduction to Geometry. New York: John Wiley & Sons. pp. 47–49. loc.cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze_group)

Paterae are also usually used to decorate friezes. Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed, on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave ("main beam") and is capped by the moldings of the cornice. A frieze can be found on many Greek and

"The Rampurva capitals are the capitals of a pair of Ashoka Pillars discovered in c. 1876 by A.C.L. Carlleyle.The archaeological site is called Rampurva, and is located in the West Champaran district of the Indian state of Bihar, situated very close to the border

Indus Script hypertexts seen on Rampurva Aśoka pillars, copper bolt (metal dowel), bull & lion capitals are proclamations, ketu -- yajñasya ketu-- of Soma Yāga performance.
All the pillars of Ashoka are built at Buddhist monasteries. “The pillars have four component parts in two pieces: the three sections of the capitals are made in a single piece, often of a different stone to that of the monolithic shaft to which they are attached by a large metal dowel. The shafts are always plain and smooth, circular in cross-section, slightly tapering upwards and always chiselled out of a single piece of stone. The lower parts of the capitals have the shape and appearance of a gently arched bell formed of lotus petals. The abaci are of two types: square and plain and circular and decorated and these are of different proportions. The crowning animals are masterpieces of Mauryan art, shown either seated or standing, always in the round and chiselled as a single piece with the abaci.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Ashoka#cite_ref-7

Frieze of the lost capital of the Allahabad pillar, with two lotuses with multiple calyx, framing a "flame palmette" surrounded by small rosette flowers, over a band of beads and reels. John Murray, 1876 - Illustration for History of Indian and Eastern Architecture by James Fergusson (John Murray, 1876). "The palmette is a motif in decorative art which, in its most characteristic expression, resembles the fan-shaped leaves of a palm tree. It has a far-reaching history, originating in ancient Egypt with a subsequent development through the art of most of Eurasia, often in forms that bear relatively little resemblance to the original. In ancient Greek and ancient Roman uses it is also known as the anthemion (from the Greekανθέμιον, a flower)." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmette

"From the 5th century, palmettes tended to have sharply splaying leaves. From the 4th century however, the end of the leaves tend to turn in, forming what is called the "flame palmette" design. This is the design that was adopted in Hellenistic architecture and became very popular on a wide geographical scale. This is the design that was adopted by India in the 3rd century BCE for some of its sculptural friezes, such as on the abaci of the Pillars of Ashoka, or the

The pillars upholding the capital are Indus Script hypertexts: skambha 'pillar' rebus: kampaṭṭam, kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage'.
Thus, these pillars with animal capitals of Rampurva are proclamations of metal- and mint-work by artisans of Rampurva. The tradition of mounting a pillar as a proclamation of performance of Soma Yāga is a tradition documented in R̥ gveda which refers to an octagonal pillar
as ketu. aṣṭāśri yūpa, a ketu to proclaim a somasamsthā yāga. The expression used describe the purport of the yūpa is: yajñasya ketu (RV 3.8.8).

"According to Cunningham, who wrote about the pillars says, that he excavated the surrounding of the site and disconnected its broken Capital from the shaft. The Capital was fastened to the shaft by a solid barrel shaped bolt of pure copper, measuring two and a half feet long and 5-5/16 inches in diameter at the centre and tapered slightly towards the ends where its circumference was 3-5/8 inches. The bolt projected exactly half its length or 1-1/4 inches from the shaft, and the projecting portion received the Capital; both ends were beautifully fitted into the stone, thus dispensing with any cement substance to firmly hold it together. The copper bolt was an exquisite piece of work, created into shape apparently with a hammer. The bolt is now kept in the Indian Museum, Kolkata and weighs 79 1⁄2 lbs."

The bolt is apparently forged into form by hammer after being cast. This is confirmed by the inscription on the bolt written in Indus writing. The lexeme is: koṭe ‘forging (metal)(Munda)
The use of the Indus script glyphs on
Rampurva copperbolt*** reinforce the decoding of smithy repertoire.
***Rampurva copper bolt “The starting place for the inquiry is the Rampurva copper bolt at
present in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. This was discovered in 1880 by Cunningham and H.B. Garrick. It was buried beside the fallen southerly pillar on which was engraved a set of Asoka’s pillar edicts. The pillar and its lion capital were subsequently fully excavated by Daya Ram Sahni. The more northerly Rampurva pillar is that associated with the famous bull capital. The bolt was examined by Cunningham who concluded that there could be n doubt of its being original and that it must have served to hold the lion capital in place upon its pillar. It is probable that other Asokan pillars and capitals bear mortises for similar bolts. This one is described as barrel shaped, of pure copper measuring 2 ft. 1⁄2 in. in length, with a diameter of 4 5/16 in. in the centre, and 3 5/8 in. at each end. Cunningham makes no mention of any marks upon the bolt, but Durga Prasad published an impression of four marks. They are made of lines of impressed dots and include the hill-with-crescent, the taurine or Nandipada, and the open cross:



21
Here these signs occur upon an object which must have been made by craftsmen working for
Asoka or one of his predessors.” (F.R. Allchin, 1959, Upon the contextual significance of certain groups of ancient signs, School of Oriental and African Studies, London.)
goṭ 'seed' Rebus: koṭe ‘forging (metal)(Munda); khoṭ 'alloy ingot'. खोट (p. 212) [ khōṭa ] f A mass of metal (unwrought or of old metal melted down); an ingot or wedge. (Marathi) kanda 'fire-altar' Rebus: khaṇḍa 'metal implements'. goṭ 'round object' Rebus: khoṭ 'alloy ingot' PLUS bhaṭa 'rimless pot' Rebus: bhaṭa 'furnace'; dhanga 'mountain-range' Rebus: dhangar 'metalsmith' PLUS bhaṭa 'rimless pot' Rebus: bhaṭa 'furnace'. Thus, the inscription on the Rampurva copperbolt provides technical specification on the metal object, the copper bolt: that it was made of an alloy ingot (from) furnace, (made by) metal implements metalsmith.
Alternative: goṭ 'round object' Rebus: khoṭ 'alloy ingot' PLUS dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS ayo 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal'PLUS khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' rebus: Ta. kampaṭṭam coinage, coin. Ma. kammaṭṭam, kammiṭṭam coinage, mint. Ka. kammaṭa id.; kammaṭi a coiner. (DEDR 1236)
Thus, the Indus Script hypertext on the Rampurva copper alloy bolt is a message of the professional competence of metalsmiths of the Bronze Age at Rampurva: alloy metal castings, metal furnaces, ingots, metalsmithy, mintwork. Hieroglyphs on the two-and-a-half feet long Rampurva copper bolt which joinss the bull capital to the pillar: 1. goṭ 'seed' Rebus: koṭe ‘forging (metal) 2. kanda 'fire altar' rebus: khaṇḍa 'metal implements'. 3. goṭ 'round, stone' Rebus: khoṭ 'alloy ingot' PLUS aya khambhaṛā 'fish fin' Rebus: aya kammaṭa 'iron mint' 4. ḍanga 'mountain range' rebus: ḍangar 'blacksmith' PLUS bhaṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: bhaṭa 'furnace'.
Thus, the hypertext on the Rampurva copper bolt is 1. a professional calling card of the metalsmithy/forge artisan with competence in forging metal implements, with iron mint and furnace and 2. proclamation of the performance of a Soma Yāga.
Thus, Indus Script hypertexts seen on Rampurva Aśoka pillars, copper bolt, bull & lion capitals are proclamations, ketu -- yajñasya ketu-- of Soma Yāga performance.
Surprising confirmation of Bronze Age Linguistic Doctrine comes from a copper alloy bolt which holds the Rampurva Capital to the Asokan pillar.
The copper bolt is inscribed with hieroglyphs of Indus writing attesting to two facts: 1. hieroglyphic writing system as a continuum in Indian sprachbund; 2. hieroglyphs denote metallurgical processing. Rampurva pillar edict text:



22
• Thus saith king Priyadarsi, Beloved of the Gods. Twelve years after my coronation, records relating to Dharma were caused to be written by me for the first time for the welfare and happiness of the people, so that, without violation thereof, they might attain the growth of Dharma in various respects.
• Thinking: “Only in this way the welfare and happiness of the people may be secured.” I
scrutinize as to how I may bring happiness to the people, no matter whether they are my relatives or residents of the neighborhood of my capital or of distant localities. And I act accordingly. In the same manner, I scrutinize in respect of all classes of people. Moreover, all the religious sects have been honored by me with various kinds of honors. But what I consider my principal duty is meeting the people of different sects personally. This record relating to Dharma has been caused to be written by me twenty-six years after my coronation.
A solid copper bolt (24 1⁄2” in length and a circumference of 14” at the center and 12” at the ends),
was found in the Rampurva Asoka Pillar near Nepal border.Indus Script hypertext, hieroglyphs n the two-and-a-half feet long Rampurva copper bolt which joinss the bull capital to the pillar:
On some cast copper coins coming out of mints, in addition to these four hieroglyphs, two additional hieroglyphs are inscribed:



23
All these six hieroglyphs are a continuum of the legacy of Indus writing. The language is Meluhha (mleccha) of Indian sprachbund. The rebus readings of these six hieroglyphs evolved in the context of Bronze Age are as follows, the readings validate the Bronze Age Linguistic Doctrine which should replace the 'Aryan invasion' Linguistic Doctrine which is the ruling paradigm in language studies.
The Asur are found in the districts of Gumla, Lohardaga, Palamau and Latehar of Jharkhand state. They have been iron-smelters. The modern Asur vanavasi are divided into three subextended family divisions, namely Bir(Kol) Asur, Birjia Asur and Agaria Asur. Rebus readings L: to R. are:
1. kōṭai mountain (Tamil) Rebus: kōṭṭam = temple (Tamil) koṭe ‘forging (metal)(Mu.) koḍ
‘workshop’ (G.) खोट [ khōṭa ] f ‘A mass of metal (unwrought or of old metal melted down); an ingot or wedge’ (Kashmiri) baṭa = rimless pot (Kannada) Rebus: baṭa = furnace (Santali) 2. Glyph: dulo ‘hole’ (N.); rebus: dul ‘to cast metal in a mould’ (Santali) baṭa = rimless pot (Kannada) Rebus: baṭa = furnace (Santali)
3. gaṇḍa ‘four’ (Santali) Rebus: kaṇḍ = fire-altar (Santali); kan = copper (Tamil) 4. Pali. kuṭila— ‘bent’, n. ‘bend’; Prakrit. kuḍila— ‘crooked’ Rebus: kuṭila, katthīl = bronze (8 parts copper and 2 parts tin) Thus, the inscription on Rampurva copper bolt describes the metallurgical processes of makiing the bolt: 1. a mass of khōṭa metal melted down in furnace; koṭe ‘forged' 2. the metal cast (dul) in a mould 3. ingot subjected to fire-altar (kaṇḍ) furnace 4. Bronze (8 parts copper and 2 parts tin) used in casting the alloy, kuṭila Rimless-pot glyph is ligatured to two glyphs: 1. mountain; 2. circle
baṭa = rimless pot (Kannada) Rebus: baṭa = furnace (Santali) bhrāṣṭra = furnace (Skt.)
kōṭu summit of a hill, peak, mountain; kōṭai mountain (Tamil) kūṭa = peak (Telugu)
kūṭam = workshop (Tamil);

Bharhut, Besnagar sculptural Makara hieroglyphs ayo kammaṭa 'iron mint' -- expression used in Mahavams'a validates Indus Script proclamation Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/gq2x67q
Two pillars with capitals of Besnagar (ca. 2nd cent.BCE) signify two proclamations of services offered in the city workshop complex: ayo 'fish' rebus:" aya 'metal, iron' PLUS khambhaṛā 'fin' rebus: kammaTa 'mint'; hence, ayo kammaTa 'iron mint' and kāraṇikā 'pericarp of lotus' rebus: karaṇī 'scribe, supercargo'. Supercargo is a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale. Hieroglyphs as hypertexts on the two capitals: Capitl 1: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi
'smithy' kāraṇikā 'pericarp of lotus' rebus: karaṇī 'scribe, supercargo', kañi-āra 'helmsman'. capital 2: ayo 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'metal' PLUS khambhaṛā 'fin' rebus: kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage' PLUS karA 'crocodile' rebus: khAr 'blacksmith'.



28
kambha 'pillar' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage' as a semantic determinative. Ta. kampaṭṭam coinage, coin. Ma. kammaṭṭam, kammiṭṭam coinage, mint. Ka. kammaṭa id.; kammaṭi a coiner. (DEDR 1236) kammaTa is also a Pali word with the same meaning, attested by Mahavams'a.
Thus, these two pillars with hieroglyph hypertexts in Indus Script tradition, are two proclamations of services provided by artificers at the workshops of Besnagar.
Confirmation for this decipherment is provided by Mahaavams'a, XXV, 28, which uses an expression: ayo-kammata-dvAra, translated as "iron studded gate" (of a city), but more accurately should translate as: iron mint gate.
[quote]Ayas: not in the Dictionary. This word is always used for iron (see loha, below). Mahavamsa, XXV, 28, ayo-kammata-dvara, "iron studded gate " (of a city) ; ib., 30, ayo-gulath, " iron balls "; ib., XXIX, 8, ayo-jala, an iron trellis used in the foundations of a stfipa. Reference might have been made to the iron pillars at Delhi and Dhar, and the use of iron in building at Konarak. [unquote] (Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Indian Architectural terms, in: American Oriental Society, Vol. 48, 1928, pp.250-275).

A hieroglyph which signifies kambha 'pillar' is kambha 'wing'. Thus, the sculptural frieze with winged tigers can be read rebus: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' PLUS kambha 'wing' rebus: khambha 'pillar'. kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus, ironworker smithy pillar
The winged tiger hieroglyphs: khambha 'wing' rebus: kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage' kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron'. Thus, iron mint. The tw garlands surmounded below the parasol and above the spokedwheel signify: dAma 'garland' rebus: dhAu 'mineral'. Lakshmi flankedby two elephants signifies medhA 'dhanam, wealth.' The word also means 'Sarasvati'. The lotuses are: tAmarasa rebus: tAmra 'copper'.

broken; the open mouth, filled with saw teeth, is bordered by ridged lips. The eyes are bulging and have thick curling eyebrows. The finlike ears are adorned with pendants, each consisting of four strands of beads held together by a rectangular plaque. The flat modeling of the curled tail, the top and side surfaces of which meet almost at right angles, are strongly reminiscent of Bharhut sculpture of the 2nd century B.C. The makara probably crowned a votive column (dhvaja stambha) before a temple or site sacred to Pradyumna, one of the Pancavrsnis. An image of the same period has also been discovered at Besnagar, ancient Vidisa."
http://museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/record/alh_ald-AM-SCL-59-3541 This is makaradhvaja. "Pradyumna (Sanskrit: ुम्नप्रध्य ) is the name of a character in the Srimad Bhagavatam. He was the son of Lord Krishna andRukmini. Pradyumna is considered as one of the four vyuha avatar of Vishnu. According to some accounts, Pradyumna was an incarnation of Kama, the god of love. Pradyumna is also a name of the Hindu god Vishnu. He is one in 24 Keshava Namas (names), praised in all pujas. It is also the only name in Sanskrit with all the 3 letters joint (referred as जोडाक्षर ) The Harivamsa describes intricate relationships between Krishna Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha that would later form a Vaishnava concept of primary quadrupled expansion, or avatar." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradyumna

Makara Bharhut, c. 100 BC Indian Museum, Calcutta Something of the origin of the makara, or at least its early composition in India, can be seen here. The water beast, confined beneath a ledge with kneeling rams that represent the realm of land, is pictured here with the snout of a crocodile, the head and forequarters of an elephant, the body of a snake, and the fins and tail of a fish. http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/calcutta/cm13.html

Cargo were products out of khambhaṛā 'fish fin' rebus: kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage', made by karA 'crocodile' rebus: khAr 'blacksmith'; karibha 'elephant trunk' ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'. Makara is the quintessential proclamation of the life-work of artisans of the Bronze Age revolution. These artisans created the Bharhut, Sanchi stupa and other temples as monuments, celebrating their life-activities signified by these metaphors, these Indus Script hieroglyphs as rebus metonymy (sculptural or orthographic metaphors of a writing system).



45
The continuum of the Indian writing system is demonstrated by the continued use of glyphs of elephant and sun’s rays on Mauryan and later-day punch-marked coins. The glyphs had significance in the context of the coinmaker, kammaTi (signified by the glyph of bow, kammaTa – as shown on a punchmarked coin of the imperial first series). Elephant glyph also gets ligatured to crocodile glyph to create the unique composite glyph of makara which gets represented on the entry steps of many temples during the historical periods and also in Bharhut sculptures.

Makara Disgorging a Warrior
Architectural decoration. Late XIth early XIIth century Chành Lô style, Thu Thiên group. Sandstone. H. 86.4 cm. Norton Simon Art Foundation, Pasadena, CA, M1977. 20 a. S.
A makara disgorging human figures, frequently a warrior, is a recurring theme in the history of Cham art. An early example cornes from the reredos of the Dông Du'o'ng temple (Boisselier 1963 a : Fig. 56). We find it here some two centuries later, where the makara head accentuates the pointed and spiky features, with a row of sharp teeth continued by a row of similarly shaped foliage decorations. The makara 's elephantine nose has been made into a towering curved spike that exactly mimics the animal's huge fangs. The drapery of the garment and the pointed headgear of the warrior brandishing a weapon, place the composition in the Thu Thiên group of the Chành Lô style.

“Makaradhvaja is a popular Kupipakwa Rasayana, prepared with the Swarna (gold), Parada (mercury) and Gandhaka (sulfur) in a specified ratio. It was first described by Rasendra Chintamani[1] by the name ofChandrodaya Rasa, although the word Makaradhvaja was first coined by Rasaratnakara. The term Makaradhvaja is composed of two words, i.e. Makara and Dhvaja. The term Makaradhvaja is also a synonymous of Kamadeva,[2] the God of beauty.” (Khedekar S, Patgiri BJ, Ravishankar B, Prajapati PK., 2011, Standard manufacturing process of Makaradhvaja prepared by Swarna Patra - Varkha and Bhasma.

"As the most common source of mercury in nature,cinnabar has been mined for thousands of years, even as far back as the Neolithic Age.During the Roman Empire it was mined both as a pigment,[14][15] and for its mercury content.To produce liquid mercury (quicksilver), crushed cinnabar ore is roasted in rotary furnaces. Pure mercury separates from sulfur in this process and easily evaporates. A condensing column is used to collect the liquid metal, which is most often shipped in iron flasks." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar

Hematite is a more reddish variety of iron oxide, and is the main ingredient of red ochre. When limonite is roasted, it turns partially to the more reddish hematite and becomes red ochre or burnt sienna. "Ochre (/ˈoʊkər/ oh-kər; from Greek: ὠχρός, ōkhrós , (pale yellow, pale), also spelled ocher, see spelling differences) is a natural earth pigment containing hydrated iron oxide, which ranges in color from yellow to deep orange or brown.

The ritual of applying the sindoor as part of a Hindu Indian wedding "Modern sindoor mainly uses vermilion, an orange-red pigment. Vermilion is the purified and powdered form of cinnabar, which is the chief form in which mercury sulfide naturally occurs." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindoor
Cinnabar from Almaden District, Ciudad Real, Castile-La Mancha, Spain
Cinnabar, mercury ore from Nevada, USA
" The largest natural source of mercury is cinnabar, its only known ore, and the richest deposits are found in Spain and Italy. This reddish mineral containing mercury and sulfur has been used as a pigment since prehistoric times. Cinnabar dating from 500 BC has been identified at a Mayan site in Guatemala, and prehistoric skulls painted with cinnabar have been found in Italy...In the ancient art of alchemy, mercury, sulfur, and salt were the Earth's three principle substances. The Hindu word for alchemy is "Rasasiddhi", meaning "knowledge of mercury." Believing that mercury was at the core of all metals, alchemists supposed that gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron were all mixtures of mercury and other substances. While alchemists in different cultures had different beliefs, one of the central themes to European alchemy was the belief that the correct combination of mercury and other ingredients would yield riches of



83
gold...The line between alchemy and medicine was not always clear. In 2nd century China, the study of mercury centered on a search for an elixir of life to confer longevity or immortality. The prominent Chinese alchemist Ko Hung, who lived in the 4th century, believed that man is what he eats, and so by eating gold he could attain perfection. Yet, he reasoned, a true believer was likely to be poor, and so it was necessary to find a substitute for the precious metal. This, in his
estimation, could be accomplished by making gold from cinnabar." Ko Hung, Alchemist http://www.dartmouth.edu/~toxmetal/mercury/history.html

Daradas were a people who lived north to the Kashmir valley. Their kingdom is identified to be the Gilgit region in Kashmir along the river Sindhu or Indus. They are often spoken along with the Kambojas. The Pandava hero Arjuna had visited this country of Daradas during his northern military campaign to collect tribute forYudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice. Herodotus and Strabo also connect the Daradas with the gold producing area located in the west of Tibet. There is an evidence that the Daradas, in ancient times, had their colonies located inBaltistan and Leh also. Darada king is mentioned as a Bahlika ruler in the Bahlika region in the Mahabharata.

Hence, Soma Skanda as S'iva, the aSTAs'ri yupa (octagonal pillar of light and fire), an object of veneration and puja.

The snout is broken; the open mouth, filled with saw teeth, is bordered by ridged lips. The eyes are bulging and have thick curling eyebrows. The finlike ears are adorned with pendants, each consisting of four strands of beads held together by a rectangular plaque. The flat modeling of the curled tail, the top and side surfaces of which meet

almost at right angles, are strongly reminiscent of Bharhut sculpture of the 2nd century B.C. The makara probably crowned a votive column (dhvaja stambha) before a temple or site sacred to Pradyumna, one of the Pancavrsnis. An image of the same period has also been discovered at Besnagar, ancient Vidisa. http://nmma.nic.in/nmma/antiquity_search.do?
"The four hands of the God are damaged so that none of the attributes can be seen. On top, just above the crown, is an image of Yogasana Visnu with the fish and turtle avataras and Maladharadevas on either side. The pilasters flanking the god support niches with images of Brahma and Siva to his right and left respectively; and at their base are female and male attendant figures in front of whom are small seated figures of Buddha and Kalki on a horse. The offset to the right has, from top to bottom, a small figure of Varaha, a makara, a vyala motif, a large figure of Rama holding a bow, and a seated figure of Vamana. Similarly, to the gods' left, we have a mutilated image of Narasimha, and at the base the serpent hooded Balarama leaning on a club in front of whom is a seated image of Parasurama. The central projection of the pancaratha pedestal carries a male and female figure in anjalimudra at the sides." http://nmma.nic.in/nmma/antiquity_search.do?method=explore_antiquity_search&id_link _mat=22&?w=&pager.offset=2300

Published on Mar 18, 2016 Makaradhvaja is the famous Ayurvedic medicine made up of Gold Bhasma and Mercury. The particular heating sequence is the most crucial factor in preparation of Makaradhvaja. Rasashastra is the pharmaceutical specialty of Ayurveda that describes the method of pharmaceutical preparation of Makaradhvaja. The category of Makaradhvaja id Kupipakwa Rasayana . Makaradhvaja is prepared by two methods, Antardhum and Bahirdhum. Bahirdhum method is much faster, but the product obtained is sublimed hence does not contain any Gold. Whereas Antardhum method requires 72 hours of heating and product obtained contains high quality medicated gold. This medicine is very potent yet not toxic at therapeutic dose. Dr. Pranit Ambulkar (MD, PhD Ayurveda) gives brief introduction of preparation of Makaradhvaja in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_50S-brl9Ic

The story of Makardhvaja and Hanuman has several versions...Makaradhvaja claimed that he was the son of Hanuman. Hanuman was amused at this and said that he himself was Hanuman, but he could not be his son, as he was born celibate. A duel between Hanuman and Makaradhvaja took place. Hanuman defeated Makaradhvaja in the duel and proceeded further. Finally, Hanuman killed Ahiravana and rescued Srirama and Lakshmana.
Later, on the advice of Srirama, Hanuman installed Makaradhvaja, as the King of Patala and all the three returned to Lanka, to continue the war with Ravana." "

The hieroglyphs or metaphors which adorn the toraṇa and the temple precincts are a declaration of the smithy as temple for dharma-dhamma. The semantics of the temple architecture are a reaffirmation of the message of good work, of virtuous conduct, sanatana dharma-dhamma.
The hieroglyph multiplex of crocodile, elephant, tiger, fish is celebrated as mahAkara, makara
and makara toraṇa as a sculptural metaphor is explained in the context of veneration of Ganga as Ma Ganga, mother Ganga. This association of the Gavialis gangeticus – gharial with River Ganga is related to the life-activity of the people of the Gangetic plain as Bharatam Janam, metalcaster folk working with iron. This has been attested archaeologically by the discovery of iron smelters and iron work at Malhar, Raja-nal-ki-tila and Lohardiwa on the Ganga River basin.

1. trefoil
2. garland, rope as on a toraṇa in the Hindu tradition of temple arch or architrave architecture.

The sculptural metaphors speak, declare *saṁhati, *saṅghati, through mlecchita vikalpa hieroglyphs of kole.l 'smithy, temple'.
Just as Indus Script Corpora embody speech, Meluhha speech, the metaphors of ancient temples are a continuum in the mlecchita vikalpa tradition of writing, engraving, carving, sculpting.
The messaging cipher, mlecchita vikalpa, of Meluhha artisan explains the grammar of dharmadhamma sanatana: dharmasamkathA pl. pious conversation; dhamakArya 'any act of duty or religion, good work, virtuous conduct (Samskritam)
Meluhha artisan emerges out of Makara. Ganga fish-eating ghara 'snout of crocodile', aya 'fish'; āhan gar,ayakara 'metalsmith'; ayo meḍh 'goat-fish' 'iron merchant'.
Molluscs and Makara hieroglyphs. The iron worker, blacksmith āhan gar, ayakara has created a smithy, a temple: kole.l 'smithy'; kole.l 'temple'.
Makara composition and Makara toraṇa hieroglyph multiplex in the semantics messaging traditions of Indian sprachbund is rebus-metonymy-layered cipher in Meluhha.
The toraṇa which emerges out of the snout of the makara is thus a chord, a garland which carries the mesage like the waves of an ocean, dama rebus: dhamma 'virtuous conduct'.

"Makara Torana: The ornate Makara Torana (Capricorn Arch or festoon) carved out of a single stone with four opposed fierce makara-heads (crocodile heads) adorns above the entrance of the sanctum. It reminds us the Pallava style Makara torana at the Satrumallesvara rock-cut cave temple at Dalavanur and Draupadi ratha at Mamallapuram. Two opposing capricon heads, (facing north and south) are carved at the center of the door lintel and they appear spitting warriors (in miniature size) holding swords and shields. A male image seated on lotus flower flanked by two chauris is shown within the floral ring located at the center between two makara heads. The parallel pair of opposing makara heads are placed one each in the southern and northern corners of the festoon. The intricately coiled feathers appear spread across the entire door lintel." http://know-your-heritage.blogspot.in/search/label/Architecture

Makara Angkor Complex, Cambodia.
Makara metaphor is so central to the artists' message that the makara torana (architrave) is an abiding image to support sculptural friezes of many divinities. In this composition, Indra on Airavata elephant is supported by the makara ensemble ligatured with kIrtimukha. So, karA becomes mahA karA, makara in the writing tradition which started from the mlecchita vikalpa cipher of Indus Script Corpora. Out of the snouts of the makara emerge the garlands, an offering of puja to the paramaatman. Kamadeva sports the makara-dhvaja.

Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is only a fish-eater. Gharial is one of three crocodilians (apart from the mugger crocodile and the saltwater crocodile) native to India and once inhabited all the major Himalayan glacier river systems of the Indian Subcontinent, from the Irrawaddy River in the east to the Sindhu River in the west. "They inhabit foremost flowing rivers with high sand banks that they use for basking and building nests. They usually mate in the cold season. The young hatch before the onset of the monsoon." (Whitaker, R., Members of the Gharial Multi-Task Force, Madras Crocodile Bank (2007). "The Gharial: Going Extinct Again" /Iguana 14 (1): 2433.) http://www.ircf.org/downloads/Iguana14_1%20Gharial%20Going%20Extinct%20Again.pd f) The average body weight of the species is from 159 to 250 kg (350 to 550 lb). Males commonly attain a total length of 3 to 5 m (9.8 to 16 ft), while females are smaller and reach a body length of up to 2.7 to 3.75 m (8.9 to 12.3 ft). http://crocodileworld.blogspot.in/2012_11_01_archive.html
In 2009, gharial occurrences were reported at Sabujdwip and Balagarh of Hooghly district; Nabadwip; Patuli-Agradwip; and Ketugram II block of Burdwan District in Ganga River, West Bengal.http://innovativeindiatours.com/conservation/

However, the flat obverse of both of these broken tablets does not show the spearing of a buffalo, rather it depicts the more well-known scene showing a tiger looking back over its shoulder at a person sitting on the branch of a tree. Several other flat or twisted rectangular terracotta tablets found at Harappa combine these two narrative scenes of a figure strangling two tigers on one side of a tablet, and the tiger looking back over its shoulder at a
figure in a tree on the other side.” (JM Kenoyer, 1998, Ancient cities of the Indus Valley, Oxford University Press, p. 115.)
Set 2: crocodile + person seated on branch of tree + tiger looking back and up + rhinoceros + tiger in procession.
The following glyphics of m1431 prism tablet show the association between the tiger + person on tree glyphic set and crocile + 3 animal glyphic set.

Mohenjo-daro m1431 four-sided tablet. Row of animals in file (a one-horned bull, an elephant and a rhinoceros from right); a gharial with a fish held in its jaw above the animals; a bird (?) at right. Pict-116: From R.—a person holding a vessel; a woman with a platter (?); a kneeling person with a staff in his hands facing the woman; a goat with its forelegs on a platform under a tree. [Or, two antelopes flanking a tree on a platform, with one antelope looking backwards?]
One side (m1431B) of a four-sided tablet shows a procession of a tiger, an elephant and a rhinoceros (with fishes (or perhaps, crocodile) on top?).

One side of a triangular terracotta tablet (Md 013); surface find at Mohenjo-daro in 1936. Dept. of Eastern Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.
Hieroglyph: kamaḍha 'penance' (Prakrit) kamaḍha, kamaṭha, kamaḍhaka, kamaḍhaga, kamaḍhaya = a type of penance (Prakrit)
Rebus: kamaṭamu, kammaṭamu = a portable furnace for melting precious metals; kammaṭīḍu = a goldsmith, a silversmith (Telugu) kãpṛauṭ jeweller's crucible made of rags and clay (Bi.); kampaṭṭam coinage, coin, mint (Tamil)

+ kamaṭa 'portable furnace'; kampaṭṭam 'coinage, coin, mint'. Thus, what the tablet conveys is the mint of a blacksmith. A copulating crocodile hieroglyph -- kāru 'crocodile' (Telugu) + kamḍa, khamḍa 'copulation' (Santali) -- conveys the same message: mint of a blacksmith kāru kampaṭṭa 'mint artisan'.

Kashmiri glosses:
khār 1 खार् । लोहकारः m. (sg. abl. khāra 1 खार; the pl. dat. of this word is khāran 1 खारन्, which is to be distinguished from khāran 2, q.v., s.v.), a blacksmith, an iron worker (cf. bandūkakhār, p. 111b, l. 46; K.Pr. 46; H. xi, 17); a farrier (El.). This word is often a part of a name, and in such case comes at the end (W. 118) as in Wahab khār, Wahab the smith (H. ii, 12; vi, 17). khāra-basta khāra-basta खार-बस् ््ि । चमणप्रसेतवका f. the skin bellows of a blacksmith.
büṭhü -ब&above;ठू &below; । लोहकारतिततः f. the wall of a blacksmith's furnace or hearth. -bāy

hammer, a sledge-hammer. -gȧ ji or -güjü - लोहकारचुल्लः f. a blacksmith's furnace or hearth.
hāl -हाल् । लोहकारकनदुः f. (sg. dat. -höjü -हा&above;जू&below;), a blacksmith's smelting
furnace; cf. hāl 5. -kūrü लोहकारकन्या f. a blacksmith's daughter. -koṭu - लोहकारपुत्रः m. the son of
a blacksmith, esp. a skilful son, who can work at the same profession. -küṭü लोहकारकन्या f. a blacksmith's daughter, esp. one who has the virtues and qualities properly belonging to her father's profession or caste. -më ̆ʦü 1 - लोहकारमृततका f. (for 2, see [khāra 3] ), 'blacksmith's

wānवान् । लोहकारापणः m. a blacksmith's shop, a forge, smithy (K.Pr. 3). -waṭh -वठ् ।
आघािाधारतशला m. (sg. dat. -waṭas -वतट), the large stone used by a blacksmith as an anvil.
Thus, kharvaṭ may refer to an anvil. Meluhha kāru may refer to a crocodile; this rebus reading of the hieroglyph is.consistent with ayakāra ‘ironsmith’ (Pali) [fish = aya (G.); crocodile = kāru (Telugu)]

JH Lindsay provides a chronological framework for analyzing orthography of Makara:
“At Amaravati, in South India, about the second century CE, on the great Buddhist stupa there were many carvingsof a marine animal with a recurved upper lip, holding lotus flower in its mouth, the wll-known Indianmakara. The Makara has a long history in Indian Buddhist art, which has been describedby Professor J.Ph. Vogel in Revue des Arts Asiatiques, tome vi,no. iii, pp. 133-147, ‘LeMakara dans la Sculpture de ‘l’Inde'. The earliest known portrayal of the
Makara is as a crocodile in the corner of a carved panel over the entrance to the Lomas Rishi cave in Bihar, North India, constructedin the time of Asoka, the third century BCE. The crocodile has a recurved upper lip. At Bharhut, in Central India, at themiddle of the second century BCE, themakara is carved with a scaly tail curled back on itself and with a small fin behind the leg. In the first century CE, it is portrayed at Mathura, in the United Provinces, with a fish tail and a small fin behind the leg. At Amaavati, in South India, in work of the second and

third century CE, aremany carvingsof the creature with the body and tail of a fish, but sometimes the head carries a large horn like a ram’s. As Professor Vogel wrote, real animals hardly change down the ages but the imaginary Makara changes continuously under the urge of artistic imagination and from the needto create each time something richer and more artistic. In all these Indian ariationsl, theskin of scales, the head of the crocodile with g\aping mouth well furnished with teeth, the recurved upper lip and the feet of the crocodile are constant....It is at Amaravati, in South India, that there can be found the use of Makara heads as decorations on the throne on which Buddha was seated.It was commonly at the ends of the cross-bar at the back of the throne, and this time the Makara heads point outwards. Sometimes the Makara heads had beside them slender animal figures standing on their hind legs, calledby Professor Vogel leogryphs or vyAlaka. This combination of makar and leogryph at the side of the Buddha figure persisted for several hundred years in India. In the famous Sarnath Buddha (Gupta work nearly contemporary with the early work at Yun-kang) can be found this combination of makara and leogryph....The combination appearsalso in the Buddhist carvings of the ttenth century Pala dynasty of Bengal...Makara heads are also to be found in the carvings on the great Buddhist monument at Barabudur, in Java, which date from the ninth century CE. They adorn the ends of the back of the throne on which the Buddha sits exactly as at Amaravati 700 years before...”(pp.135-137)
The portrayal of makara on the throne of the Buddha is to affirm the makara was a hieroglyph representing the people who adored the Buddha.
The pattern of forming a composite animal as a hypertext is a continuum from Indus Script tradition.
This hypertext on Amaravati panel has the following hieroglyphs:

Flanked by two ladies in karaNa poses is a kalas'a (vessel of plenty) above a hypertext of ram's horn. The narrativeshows four men carrying three strands of a rope, which are also hieroglyphs. These hieroglyphs as hypertexts signify:
dhAu 'strand' rebus: dhAu, dhatu 'mineral' tri-dhAtu 'three strands' rebus: tri-dhAtu 'three minerals' meDDa 'ram' rebus: medha 'yajna' medhA 'dhanam' meD 'iron' med 'copper' (Slavic)
This hypertext of Amaravati sculptural panel shows a makara attached to a leogryph. The rebus renderings are: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' PLUS makara 'artificer, double-canoe': karA 'crocodile' rebus: khAr 'blacksmith' karibha 'trunk of elephant' rebus: karba 'iron'. Thus the hypertext signifies artificers,workers in iron and smithy and seafaring merchants..
The hyoertext on this pillar clanked by adorants is composed of two tigers surmounted by a capital, a spoked wheelo. The rebus readings are: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting' Ara 'spoke' rebus: arA 'brass' eraka 'nave of wheel' rebus: eraka 'moltencast' arka 'copper'. Thus, the hypertext signifies artisans working in iron and brass.
