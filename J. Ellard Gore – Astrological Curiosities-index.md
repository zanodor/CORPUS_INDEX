FLAM MARION'S POPULAR
ASTRONOMY
Translated from the French by J. ELLARD GORE, F.R.A.S. With 3 Plates and 288 Illustrations.
" The six books into which the book is divided give a very lucid and accurate
description of the knowledge which has been acquired of the moving bodies of space,
both as respects their motions and physical constitutions. Of the translation we can
only speak in terms of praise. Not only does it well represent the original, but
Mr. Gore has added useful notes for the purpose of bringing the information up to
date, and has also increased the number already very considerable of the excellent
illustrations, so that the work is likely to become as popular in England as it has
been in France." ATHENAEUM. "The work which Mr. J. E. Gore has translated into English has made for itself
a name and reputation in France . . . and has gone into general circulation to the
number of a hundred thousand copies. This last fact is proof how well within the
bounds of possibility it is to make the latest discoveries of science comprehensible
and fascinating to the common mind. M. Flammarion has attained this triumph
through the grasp of his knowledge, the lucidity of his style, and his power of
bringing home the most stupendous and complicated of the things revealed to us in
the depths of space. M. Flammarion's pages should find almost as great acceptance
in this country as in his own. Simplicity of arrangement and of statement are part
of his charm and of his success." SCOTSMAN.
" M. Flammarion's latest volume, if it does not displace its English rivals, may
well take a high place in the rank to which they belong. It is full } lucid, and, thanks
to Mr. Gore's careful revision, well up to date. . . . Mr. Gore's edition is so carefully
brought abreast of the latest discoveries that the English student may now con
gratulate himself on being in an even better position than the countrymen of
M. Flammarion." DAILY CHRONICLE.
"Young students of astronomy who wish to obtain a general idea of the most
wonderful and fascinating of all sciences will find precisely what they seek in
M. Flammarion's eloquent and poetic chapters. . . . There are many illustrations
in this able and attractive treatise." SPEAKER.
"It is a fascinating work, extending to nearly seven hundred pages, and dealing
in popular language with some of the most interesting of the discoveries and specu
lations of astronomers." DAILY NEWS.
" M. Flammarion is a sound practical astronomer ; he has rendered good and
laborious service to the science, and he possesses a valuable faculty of popular
exposition. . . . The volume is profusely and well illustrated, some of the best plates
making here their first appearance." SATURDAY REVIEW.
"A high place must be accorded to Flammarion's ' Popular Astronomy.' Never
before has the science of the heavens been treated with such fulness and interest as
in this fascinating book ; for Flamraarion is a man of letters as well as a man of
science a man of letters, too, endowed with the wondrous gifts of lucidity and
charm which distinguish the best French writers. . . . Flammarion's book is much
more absorbing than most novels, more romantic than most romances, more poetic
than most poems, yet strictly and scientifically accurate." LUDGATE MONTHLY.
" It must be confessed that M. Flammarion not only arrests the attention, but
assists the reader to grasp astronomical theories a task in which less popular writers
often fail when they make the attempt." LITERARY WORLD.
" The book is a most fascinating one, and holds the reader from start to finish.
... As a manual for those who wish to obtain a good general knowledge of
astronomy this work will be found unsurpassed." SCIENCE GOSSIP.

ASTRONOMICAL
CURIOSITIES
CHAPTER I
The Sun
SOME
observations recently made by Prof. W.
H. Pickering in Jamaica, make the value of
sunlight 540,000 times that of moonlight.
This makes the sun's " stellar magnitude " minus
2()'83, and that of moonlight minus 12'5. Prof. Pickering finds that the light of the full moon is
equal to 100,000 stars of zero magnitude. He finds
that the moon's " albedo " is about 0-0909 ; or in
other words, the moon reflects about one-tenth of the light which falls on it from the sun. He also
finds that the light of the full moon is about twelve times the light of the half moon : a curious
and rather unexpected result.
M. C. Fabry found that during the total eclipse
of the sun on August 30, 1905; the light of the corona at a distance of five minutes of arc from the
sun's limit, and in the vicinity of the sun's equator,
was about 720 candle-power. Comparing this B



2 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
with the intrinsic light of the full moon (2600
candle-power) we have the ratio of 0*28 to 1. He finds that the light of the sun in the zenith, and at its mean distance from the earth, is 100,000 times greater than the light of a " decimal candle " placed at a distance of one metre from the eye.1
He also finds that sunlight is equal to 60,000 million times the light of Vega. This would make
the sun's " stellar magnitude " minus 26*7, which
does not differ much from Prof. Pickering's result,
given above, and is probably not far from the truth.
From experiments made in 1906 at Moscow, Prof. Ceraski found that the light of the sun's
limb is only 31*4 to 38'4 times brighter than the
illumination of the earth's atmosphere very near
the limb. This is a very unexpected result ; and
considering the comparative faintness of the sun's
corona during a total eclipse, it is not surprising that all attempts to photograph it without an
eclipse have hitherto failed. 2 From Paschen's investigations on the heat of
the sun's surface, he finds a * result of 5961
(absolute), " assuming that the sun is a perfectly black body." 3 Schuster finds that "There is a
stratum near the sun's surface having an average
temperature of approximately 5500 C., to which about 0*3 of the sun's radiation is due. The
1 Comptes Rendus, 1903, December 7. Nature, April 11, 1907. 3 Astrophysical Journal, vol. 19 (1904), p. 39.



THE SUN 3
remaining portion of the radiation has an
intensity equal to that due to a black body having a temperature of about 6700 C." The above results agree fairly well with those found by the late Dr. W. E. Wilson.1 The assumption of
the sun being " a black body " seems a curious
paradox ; but the simple meaning of the statement is that the sun is assumed to act as a
radiator as if it vvere a perfectly black body heated
to the high temperature given above. According to Prof. Langley, the sun's photosphere is 5000 times brighter than the molten metal in a " Bessemer converter." 2 Observations of the sun even with small tele
scopes and protected by dark glasses are very dangerous to the eyesight. Galileo blinded himself in this way ; Sir William Herschel lost one of his eyes ; and some modern observers have also
suffered. The present writer had a narrow escape
from permanent injury while observing the transit of Venus, in 1874, in India, the dark screen before
the eyepiece of a 3-inch telescope having blistered that is, partially fused during the observation.
Mr. Cooper, Markree Castle, Ireland, in observing
the sun, used a " drum " of alum water and dark
spectacles, and found this sufficient protection
against the glare in using his large refracting telescope of 13%3-inches aperture.

4 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Prof. Mitchell, of Columbia University (U.S.A.), finds that lines due to the recently discovered
atmospherical gases argon and neon are present in the spectrum of the sun's chromosphere. The evidence for the existence of krypton and xenon
is, however, inconclusive. Prof. Mitchell suggests
that these gases may possibly have reached the earth's atmosphere from the sun. This would agree with the theory advanced by Arrhenius
that " ionised particles are constantly being
repulsed by the pressure of light, and thus journey from one sun to another." 1 Prof. Young in 1870, and Dr. Kreusler in June,
1904, observed the helium line D3 as a dark line
" in the spectrum of the region about a sun-spot." a This famous line, from which helium was originally discovered in the sun, and by which it was long
afterwards detected in terrestrial minerals, usually
appears as a bright line in the spectrum of the solar chromosphere and "prominences." It has also been seen dark by Mr. Buss in sun-spot
regions. 3 The discovery of sun-spots was claimed by Hariotte, in 1610, and by Galileo, Fabricius, and Schemer, in 1611. The latter wrote 800 pages on
them, and thought they were small planets revolving round the sun ! This idea was also held by
Tarde, who called them Astra Borbonia, and by
*

THE SUN 5
C. Malapert, who termed them Sydera Austricea. But they seem to have been noticed by the ancients. Although in modern times there has been no
extraordinary development of sun-spots at the epoch of maximum, it is not altogether impossible that in former times these spots may have
occasionally increased to such an extent, both
in number and size, as to have perceptibly
darkened the sun's light. A more probable
explanation of recorded sun-darkenings seems, however, to be the passing of a meteoric or nebulous cloud between the sun and the earth. A remarkable instance of sun-darkening recorded in Europe occurred on May 22, 1870, when the sun's light was observed to be considerably reduced in a cloudless sky in the west of Ireland, by the late John Birmingham ; at Greenwich on the 23rd ; and on the same date, but at a later hour, in North-Eastern France " a progressive
manifestation," Mr. Birmingham says, " that seems to accord well with the hypothesis of moving
nebulous matter." A similar phenomenon was
observed in New England (U.S.A.), on September 6, 1881.
One of the largest spots ever seen on the sun was
observed in June, 1843. It remained visible for
seven or eight days. According to Schwabe the discoverer of the sun-spot period its diameter was 74,000 miles, so that its area was many times



6 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
that of the earth's surface. The most curious
thing about this spot was that it appeared near a mjnwium of the sun-spot cycle ! and was therefore rather an anomalous phenomenon. It was suggested by the late Daniel Kirkwood that this
great spot was caiised by the fall of meteoric matter into the sun ; and that it had possibly some connection with the great comet of 1843, which approached the sun nearer than any other recorded comet, its distance from the sun at
perihelion being about 65,000 miles, or less than one-third of the moon's distance from the earth. This near approach of the comet to the sun occurred about three months before the appear
ance of the great sun-spot ; and it seems probable that the spot was caused by the downfall of a large meteorite travelling in the wake of the comet. 1 The connection between comets and meteors is well known.
The so-called blackness of sun-spots is merely
relative. They are really very bright. The most brilliant light which can be produced artificially looks like a black spot when projected on the
sun's disc.
According to Sir Robert Ball a pound of coal
striking a body with a velocity of five miles a second would develop as much heat as it would
produce by its combustion. A body falling into the sun from infinity would have a velocity of
1 Nature, June 29, 1871.



THE SUN 7
450 miles a second when it reached the sun's surface. Now as the momentum varies as the
square of the velocity we have a pound of coal
developing 902
( = ^-Y, or 8,100 times as much
heat as would be produced by its combustion. If the sun were formed of coal it would be consumed in about 3000 years. Hence it follows that the contraction of the sun's substance from
infinity would produce a supply of heat for
3000 x 8100, or 24,300,000 years. The late Mr. Proctor and Prof. Young believed " that the contraction theory of the sun's heat is
the true and only available theory.'* The theory is, of course, a sound one; but it may now be
supplemented by supposing the sun to contain a certain small amount of radium. This would
bring physics and geology into harmony. Proctor thought the " sun's real globe is very much smaller than the globe we see. In other words the process of contraction has gone on further than, judging
from the sun's apparent size, we should suppose it to have done, and therefore represents more sun
work " done in past ages.
With reference to the suggestion, recently made, that a portion, at least, of the sun's heat may be due to radium, and the experiments which have been made with negative results, Mr. R. T. Strutt the eminent physicist has made some
calculations on the subject and says, " even if all



8 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
the sun's heat were due to radium, there does not
appear to be the smallest possibility that the
Becquerel radiation from it could ever be detected at the earth's surface." l
The eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius, while admitting that a large proportion of the sun's heat is due to contraction, considers that it
is probably the chemical processes going on in the sun, and not the contraction which constitiite
the chief source of the solar heat.2 As the centre of gravity of the sun and Jupiter lies at a distance of about 460,000 miles from the
sun's centre, and the sun's radius is only 433,000 miles, it follows that the centre of gravity of the
sun and planet is about 27,000 miles outside the
sun's surface. The attractions of the other
planets perpetually change the position of the centre of gravity of the solar system; but in
some books on astronomy it is erroneously stated that the centre of gravity of the system
is always within the sun's surface. If all the planets lay on the same side of the sun at
the same time (as might possibly happen), then the centre of gravity of the whole system would
lie considerably more than 27,000 miles outside the sun's surface.
With reference to the sun's great size, Carl
Snyder has well said, " It was as if in Vulcan's
1 Nature, October 15, 1903. 2 The Life of the Universe (1909). vol. ii. p. 209.



THE SUN 9
smithy the gods had moulded one giant ball, and the planets were but bits and small shot which
had spattered off as the glowing ingot was cast and set in space. Little man on a little part of a
little earth a minor planet, a million of which
might be tumbled into the shell of the central
sun was growing very small ; his wars, the con
vulsions of a state, were losing consequence. Human endeavour, human ambitions could now
scarce possess the significance they had when men could regard the earth as the central fact of the
universe." ' With reference to the late Prof. C. A. Young
(U.S.A.) a great authority on the sun an American writer has written the following
lines :
" The destined course of whirling worlds to trace, To plot the highways of the universe, And hear the morning stars their song rehoarse, And find the wandering comet in his place ; This is the triumph written in his face,
And in the gleaming eye that read the sun Like open book, and from the spectrum won The secrets of immeasurable space." 2

CHAPTER II
Mercury
A
the elongation of Mercury from the sun seldom exceeds 18, it is a difficult object,
at least in this country, to see without a
telescope. As the poet says, the planet
" Can scarce be caught by philosophic eye Lost in the near effulgence of its blaze."
Tycho Brahe, however, records several observations of Mercury with the unaided vision in Denmark.
It can be occasionally caught with the naked
eye in this country after sunset, when it is
favourably placed for observation, and I have so seen it several times in Ireland. On February 19,
1888, I found it very visible in strong twilight near
the western horizon, and apparently brighter than an average star of the first magnitude would be in
the same position. In the clear air of the Punjab
sky I observed Mercury on November 24-29, 1872, near the western horizon after sunset. Its appear
ance was that of a reddish star of the first magni
tude. On November 29 I compared its brilliancy



MERCURY 11
with that of Saturn, which was some distance above it, and making allowance for the glare near the horizon in which Mercury was immersed, its
brightness appeared to me to be quite equal to that of Saturn. In June, 1874, I found it equal to
Aldebaran, and of very much the same colour. Mr. W. F. Denning, the famous observer of meteors, states that he observed Mercury with the naked eye about 150 times during the years 1868 to
1905. 1
He found that the duration of visibility after sunset is about lh 40m when seen in March, lh 30m in April, and lh 20m in May. He thinks that the
planet is, at its brightest, " certainly much brighter than a first magnitude star. 2 In February, 1868, he found that its brightness rivalled that of
Jupiter, then only 2 or 3 distant. In November, 1882, it seemed brighter than Sirius. In 1876 it was more striking than Mars, but the latter was then " faint and at a considerable distance from the earth." In 1878, when Mercury and Venus were in the same field of view of a telescope, Nasmyth found
that the surface brightness (or " intrinsic bright
ness," as it is called) of Venus was at least twice as great as that of Mercury ; and Zollner found that from a photometric point of view the surface
of Mercury is comparable with that of the moon.

12 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
With reference to the difficulty of seeing
Mercury, owing to its proximity to the sun, Admiral Smyth says, " Although Mercury is never in opposition to the earth, he was, when in the house of Mars, always viewed by astrologers as a most malignant planet, and one full of evil influences. The sages stigmatized him as a false
deceitful star (sidus dolosum), the eternal torment
of astronomers, eluding them as much as terrestrial mercury did the alchemists ; and Goad, who in 1686 published a whole folio volume full of
astro-meteorological aphorisms, unveiling the choicest secrets of nature, contemptuously calls
Mercury a * squinting lacquey of the sun, who seldom shows his head in these parts, as if he was
in debt.' His extreme mobility is so striking that
chemists adopted his symbol to "denote quick
silver." 1
Prof. W. H. Pickering thinks that the shortness
of the cusps (or " horns ") of Mercury's disc indicates that the planet's atmosphere is of small density even rarer than that of Mars. The diameter of Mercury is usually stated at about 3000 miles ; but a long series of measures
made by Prof. See in the year 1901 make the real diameter about 2702 miles. This would make the planet smaller than some of the satellites of the
large planets, probably smaller than satellites III.
and IV. of Jupiter, less than Saturn's satellite
1 Cycle of Celestial Objects, p. 96.



MERCURY 13
Titan, and possibly inferior in size to the satellite
of Neptune. Prof. Pickering thinks that the
density of Mercury is about 3 (water = 1). Dr.
See's observations show " no noticeable falling off
in the brightness of Mercury near the limb." There is therefore no evidence of any kind of
atmospheric absorption in Mercury, and the observer " gets the impression that the physical condition of the planet is very similar to that of our moon." l '
Schroter (1780-1815) observed markings on Mercury, from which he inferred that the planet's
surface was mountainous, and one of these mountains he estimated at about 11 miles in
height !
2 But this seems very doubtful.
To account for the observed irregularities in the motion of Mercury in its orbit, Prof. Newcomb
thinks it possible that there may exist a ring or
zone of " asteroids " a little " outside the orbit of Mercury" and having a combined mass of " one fiftieth to oiie-three-hundredth of the mass of
Venus, according to its distance from Mercury." Prof. Newcomb, however, considers that the
existence of such a ring is extremely improbable, and regards it " more as a curiosity than a
reality." 3 M. Leo Brenner thinks that he has seen the

U ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
dark side of Mercury, in the same way that the dark side of Venus has been seen by many
observers. In the case of Mercury the dark side
appeared darker than the background of the sky. Perhaps this may be due to its being projected on the zodiacal light, or outer envelope of the
sun. 1 Mercury is said to have been occulted by Venus in the year 1737.3 But whether this was
an actual occultation, or merely a near approach does not seem to be certain.
The first transit of Mercury across the sun's disc was observed by Gassendi on November 6, 1631, and Halley observed one on November 7, 1677, when in the island of St. Helena.
Seen from Mercury, Venus would appear brighter than even we see it, and as it would be
at its brightest when in opposition to the sun, and seen on a dark sky with a full face, it must
present a magnificent appearance' in the midnight sky of Mercury. The earth will also form a
brilliant object, and the moon would be distinctly
visible. The other planets would appear very
much as they do to us, but with somewhat less brilliancy owing to their greater distance. As the existence of an intra-Mercurial planet
(that is a planet revolving round the sun within the orbit of Mercury) seems now to be very

improbable, Prof. Perrine suggests that possibly " the finely divided matter which produces the zodiacal light when considered in the aggregate
may be sufficient to cause the perturbations the orbit of Mercury." l Prof. Newcomb, how
ever, questions the exact accuracy of Newton's law, and seems to adopt Hall's hypothesis that gravity does not act exactly as the inverse square of the distance, and that the exponent of the distance is not 2, but 2'0000001574.2 Voltaire said, " If Newton had been in Portugal, and any Dominican had discovered a heresy in his
inverse ratio of the squares of the distances, he would without hesitation have been clothed in a
san benito, and burnt as a sacrifice to God at an auto da /<." 3 An occultation of Mercury by Venus was observed with a telescope on May 17, 1737.4
May transits of Mercury across the sun's disc
will occur in the years 1924, 1957, and 1970 ; and November transits in the years 1914, 1927, and
1940. 5 From measurements of the disc of Mercury
during the last transit, M. R. Jonckheere concludes
that the polar diameter of the planet is greater

16 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
than the equatorial! His result, which is very
curious, if true, seems to be supported by the observations of other observers.1
The rotation period of Mercury, or the length of its day, seems to be still in doubt. From a series of observations made in the years 1890 to
1909, Mr. John McHarg finds a period of 1-0121162 day, or l d Oh 17m 26S'8. He thinks that "the
planet possesses a considerable atmosphere not
so clear as that of Mars "
; that " its axis is very
considerably tilted "
; and that it " has fairly large sheets of water." 2

CHAPTER III
Venus

was naturally owing to its brightness the first of the planets known to
the ancients. It is mentioned by Hesiod,
Homer, Virgil, Martial, and Pliny ; and Isaiah's remark about "Lucifer, son of the morning"
(Isaiah xiv. 12) probably refers to Venus as a " morning star." An observation of Venus is found on the Nineveh tablets of date B.C. 684.
It was observed in daylight by Halley in July, 1716. In very ancient times Venus, when a morning
star, was called Phosphorus or Lucifer, and when
an evening star Hesperus ; but, according to Sir
G. C. Lewis, the identity of the two objects was known so far back as 540 B.C.
When Venus is at its greatest brilliancy, and appears as a morning star about Christmas time
(which occurred in 1887, and again in 1889), it has been mistaken by the public for a return of the " Star of Bethlehem." l But whatever " the star

18 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of the Magi" was it certainly was not Venus.
It, seems, indeed absurd to suppose that " the wise
men " of the East should have mistaken a familiar
object like Venus for a strange apparition. There seems to be nothing whatever in the Bible to lead us to expect that the star of Bethlehem will
reappear. Mr. J. H. Stockwell has suggested that the " Star of Bethlehem " may perhaps be explained
by a conjunction of the planets Venus and Jupiter which occurred on May 8, B.C. 6, which was two years before the death of Herod. From this it would follow that the Crucifixion took
place on April 3, A.D. 33. But it seems very doubtful that the phenomenon recorded in the
Bible refers to any conjunction of planets. Chacornac found the intrinsic brightness of Venus to be ten times greater than the most luminous parts of the moon. 1 But this estimate
is probably too high. When at its brightest, the planet is visible in
broad daylight to good eyesight, if its exact position in the sky is known. In the clear air of
Cambridge (U.S.A.) it is said to be possible to see it in this way in all parts of its orbit, except when the planet is within 10 of the sun.2 Mr.
A. Cameron, of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, has, however, seen Venus with the naked eye three

VENUS 19
days before conjunction when the planet was only 61 from the sun.1 This seems a remarkable
observation, and shows that the observer's eyesight must have been very keen. In a private
letter dated October 22, 1888, the late Rev. S. J. Johnson informed the present writer that he saw Venus with the naked eye only four days before
conjunction with the sun in February, 1878, and February, 1886. The crescent shape of Venus is said to have been seen with the naked eye by Theodore Parker in America when he was only 12 years old. Otherobservers have stated the same thing ; but the possibility of such an observation has been much
disputed in recent years. In the Chinese Annals some records are given of Venus having been seen in the Pleiades. On
March 16, A.D. 845, it is said that " Venus eclipsed
the Pleiades.'* This means, of course, that the
cluster was apparently effaced by the brilliant light
of the planet. Computing backwards for the above date, Hind found that on the evening of March 16, 845, Venus was situated near the star Electra ;
and on the following evening the planet passed close to Maia ; thus showing the accuracy of
the Chinese record. Another " eclipse " of the Pleiades by Venus is recorded in the same annals
as having occurred 011 March 10, A.D. 1002.2

When Venus is in the crescent phase, that is
near " Inferior conjunction " with the sun, it will be noticed, even by a casual observer, that the crescent is not of the same shape as that of the crescent moon. The horns or "cusps" of
the planetary crescent are more prolonged than in the case of the moon, and extend beyond the
hemisphere. This appearance is caused by refraction of the sun's light through the planetary atmosphere, and is, in fact, a certain proof that Venus has an atmosphere similar to that of the earth. Observations further show that this
atmosphere is denser than ours. Seen from Venus, the earth and moon, when
in opposition, must present a splendid spectacle. I find that the earth would shine as a star about
half as bright again as Venus at her brightest appears to us, and the moon about equal in
brightness to Sirius! the two forming a superb
" naked eye double star " perhaps the finest
sight of its kind in the solar system.1
Some of the earlier observers, such as La Hire,
Fontana, Cassini, and Schroter, thought they saw evidence of mountains on Venus. Schroter estimated some of these to be 27 or 28 miles in
height! but this seems very doubtful. Sir William Herschel severely attacked these supposed discoveries. Schroter defended himself, and was supported by Beer and Madler, the famous

VENUS 21
lunar observers. Several modern observers seem to confirm Schroter's conclusions ; but very
little is really known about the topography of Venus. The well-known French astronomer Trouvelot a most excellent observer saw white spots on Venus similar to those on Mars. These were well
seen and quite brilliant in July and August, 1876, and in February and November, 1877. The observations seem to show that these spots do not (unlike Mars) increase and decrease with the
planet's seasons. These white spots had been
previously noticed by former observers, including
Biaiichini, Derham, Gruithuisen, and La Hire; but these early observers do not seem to have
considered them as snow caps, like those of Mars. Trouvelot was led by his own observations to conclude that the period of rotation of Venus is short, and the best result he obtained was
23h 49 m 28s
. This does not differ much from the
results previously found by De Vico, Fritsch, and
Schroter. 1 A white spot near the planet's south pole was seen on several occasions by H. C. Russell in May
and June, 1876. 2 Photographs of Venus taken 011 March 18 and
April 29, 1908, by M. Quenisset at the Observatory of Juvissy, France, show a white polar spot. The

22 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
spot was also seen at the same observatory by M. A. Benoit on May 20, 1903.
The controversy on the period of rotation of
Venus, or the length of its day, is a very curious one and has not yet been decided. Many good observers assert confidently that it is short (about 24 hours); while others affirm with equal con
fidence that it is long (about 225 days, the period of the planet's revolution round the sun). Among the observers who favour the short period of
rotation are : D. Cassini (1667), J. Cassini (1730),
Schroter (1788-93), Madler (1836), De Vico (1840?) Trouvelot (1871-79), Flammarion, Leo Brenner, Stanley Williams, and J. McHarg; and among those who support the long period are : Bianchini
(1727), Schiaparelli, Cerulli, Tacchini, Mascari, and Lowell. Some recent spectroscopic observa
tions seem to favour the short period. Flammarion thinks that "nothing certain can be descried upon the surface of Venus, and that whatever has hitherto been written regarding its period of rotation must be considered null and
void"; and again he says, "Nothing can be affirmed regarding the rotation of Venus, inas
much as the absorption of its immense atmosphere certainly prevents any detail on its surface from
being perceived." 1 The eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius thinks,
however, that the dense atmosphere and clouds
1 Knowledge, November 1, 1897, pp. 200, 2G1.



VENUS 23
of Venus are in favour of a rapid rotation 011 its
axis. 1 He thinks that the mean temperature of Venus may " not differ much from the calculated
temperature 104 F." " Under these circumstances
the assumption would appear plausible that a very considerable portion of the surface of Venus,
and particularly the districts about the poles, would be favourable to organic life." 2
The " secondary light of Venus," or the visibility of the dark side, seems to have been first mentioned
by Derham in his Astro Theology published in 1715. He speaks of the visibility of the dark part of the planet's disc "by the aid of a light of a somewhat dull and ruddy colour." The date of Derham's observation is not given, but it seems to have been previous to the year 1714. The light seems to have been also seen by a friend
of Derham. We next find observations by
Christfried Kirch, assistant astronomer to the
Berlin Academy of Sciences, on June 7, 1721, and March 8, 1726. These observations are found in
his original papers, and were printed in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 1586. On the
first date the telescopic image of the planet was "rather tremulous," but in 1726 he noticed that the dark part of the circle seemed to belong to a smaller circle than the illuminated portion of the disc.3 The same effect was also noted by
1 Worlds in the Making, p. 61. 2 Ibid., p. 48. 3 Nature, June 1, 1876.



24 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Webb.1 A similar illusion is seen in the case of
the crescent moon, and this has given rise to the saying, " the old moon in the new moon's arms."
We next come, in order of date, to an observa tion made by Andreas Mayer, Professor of Mathematics at Griefswald in Prussia. The observation was made on October 20, 1759, and the dark part of Venus was seen distinctly by Mayer. As the planet's altitude at the time was not more than 14 above the horizon, and its apparent distance from the sun only 10, the phenomenon as Professor Safarik has pointed out " must have had a most unusual intensity." Sir William Herschel makes no mention of
having ever seen the " secondary light " of Venus, although he noticed the extension of the horns
beyond a semicircle.
In the spring and summer of the year 1793,
Von Hahii of Remplin in Mecklenburg, using excellent telescopes made by Dollond and
Herschel, saw the dark part of Venus on several
occasions, and describes the light as "grey verging upon brown." Schroter of Lilienthal the famous observer
of the moon saw the horns of the crescent of
Venus extended many degrees beyond the semicircle on several occasions in 1784 and 1795, and
the border of the dark part faintly lit up by a
dusky grey light. On February 14, 1806, at
1 Cel, Object*, vol. i. p. CC (5th Edition).



VENUS 25
7 P.M. he saw the whole of the dark part visible with an ash-coloured light, and he was satisfied
that there was no illusion. On January 24 of
the same year, 1806, Harding at Gottingen, using a reflector of 9 inches aperture and power 84, saw the dark side of Venus " shining with a pale
ash-coloured light," and very visible against the
dark background of the sky. The appearance was seen with various magnifying powers, and he thought that there could be no illusion. In
fact the phenomenon was as evident as in the
case of the moon. Harding again saw it on February 28 of the same year, the illumination
being of a reddish grey colour, " like that of the
moon in a total eclipse."
The " secondary light " was also seen by Pastorff in 1822, and by Gruithuisen in 1825. Since 1824
observations of the " light" were made by Berry,
Browning, Guthrie, Langdon, Noble, Prince, Webb, and others. Webb saw it with powers of 90 and
212 on a 9*38-inch mirror, and found it " equally
visible when the bright crescent was hidden by a
field bar." l
Captain Noble's observation was rather unique. He found that the dark side was " always dis
tinctly and positively darker than the background upon which it is projected." The "light" was also seen by Lymaii in America in 1867, and by Safarik at Prague. In
1 Celestial Objects, vol. i. p. 63 (5th Edition).



26 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
1871 the whole disc of Venus was seen by Professor Winnecke.1 On the other hand, Winnecke
stated that he only saw it twice in 24 years ; and the great observers Dawes and Madler never saw
it at all !
2
Various attempts have been made to explain
the visibility at times of the " dark side " of Venus. The following may be mentioned 3
: (1) Reflected earth-light, analogous to the dark side of the crescent moon. This explanation was advo
cated by Harding, Schroter, and others. But,
although the earth is undoubtedly a bright object in the sky of Venus, the explanation is evidently quite inadequate. (2) Phosphorescence of the planet's atmosphere. This has been suggested
by some observers. (3) Visibility by contrast, a theory advanced by the great French astronomer
Arago. (4) Illumination of the planet's surface
by an aurora borealis. This also seems rather
inadequate, but would account for the light being sometimes visible and sometimes not. (5) Luminosity of the oceans if there be any on Venus.
But this also seems inadequate. (6) A planetary surface glowing with intense heat. But this
seems improbable. (7) The Kunstliche Feuer
(artificial fire) of Gruithuisen, a very fanciful theory. Flammarion thinks that the visibility of
the dark side may perhaps be explained by its
1 Ast. Nacli. No. 1863. 2 Nature, June 1, 1876. 3 Ibid., June 8, 1876.



VENUS 27
projection 011 a somewhat lighter background, such as the zodiacal light, or an extended solar
envelope. 1 It will be seen that none of these explanations
are entirely satisfactory, and the phenomenon, if real, remains a sort of astronomical enigma. The
fact that the "light" is visible on some occasions and not on others would render some of the
explanations improbable or even inadmissible. But the condition of the earth's atmosphere at
times might account for its invisibility on many occasions.
A curious suggestion was made by Zollner, namely, that if the secondary light of Venus could be observed with the spectroscope it would
show bright lines ! But such an observation would be one of extreme difficulty.
M. Hansky finds that the visibility of the
"light" is greater during periods of maximum solar activity that is, at the maxima of sun spots.
This he explains by the theory of Arrhenius, in
which electrified " ions emitted by the sun cause
the phenomena of terrestrial magnetic storms
and auroras." " In the same way the dense atmosphere of Venus is rendered more phos
phorescent, and therefore more easily visible by the increased solar activity." 2 This seems a very
plausible hypothesis. On the whole the occasional illumination of the

28 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
night side of Venus by a very brilliant aurora
(explanation (4) above) seems to the present writer to be the most probable explanation. Gruithuisen's hypothesis (7) seems utterly im
probable. There is a curious apparent anomaly about the motion of Venus in the sky. Although the planet's period of revolution round the sun is 224'7 days, it remains on the same side of the sun, as seen from the earth, for 290 days. The reason of this is that the earth is going at the same time
round the sun in the same direction, though at a slower pace ; and Venus must continue to appear on the same side of the sun until the excess of her daily motion above that of the earth amounts to
179, and this at the daily rate of 37' will be about
290 days/ Several observations have been recorded of a
supposed satellite of Venus. But the existence of such a body has never been verified. In the
year 1887, M. Stroobant investigated the various accounts, and came to the conclusion that in several at least of the recorded observations the
object seen was certainly a star. Thus, in the observation made by Rcedickcer and Boserup on
August 4, 1761, a satellite and star are recorded as having been seen near the planet. M.
Stroobant finds that the supposed " satellite "
was the star x* Orionis, and the " star " %. Orionis.
1 Cekstial Cycle, p. 107.



VENUS 29
A supposed observation of a satellite made by
Horrebow 011 January 3, 1768, was undoubtedly Librae. M. Stroobant found that the supposed motion of the " satellite " as seen by Horrebow is
accurately represented by the motion of Venus itself during the time of observation. In most of the other supposed observations of a satellite
a satisfactory identification has also been found. M. Stroobant finds that with a telescope of inches aperture, a star of the 8th or even the
9th magnitude can be well seen when close to Venus. 1
On the night of August 13, 1892, Professor Barnard, while examining Venus with the great
36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory, saw a star of the 7th magnitude in the same field with the planet. He carefully determined the exact position of this star, and found that it is not
in Argelander's great catalogue, the Durchmusterung. Prof. Barnard finds that owing to elongation of Venus from the sun at the time of observation the star could not possibly be an
intra-Mercurial planet (that is, a planet revolving round the sun inside the orbit of Mercury) ; but
that possibly it might be a planet revolving between the orbits of Venus and Mercury. As
the brightest of the minor planets Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were not at the time near the
position of the observed object, the observation

30 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
remains unexplained. It might possibly have been a nova, or temporary star.1 Scheuten is said to have seen a supposed satellite
of Venus following the planet across the sun at the end of the transit of June 6, 1761.2
Humboldt speaks of the supposed satellite of Venus as among " the astronomical myths of an
uncritical age." 3 An occultation of Venus by the moon is mentioned in the Chinese Annals as having occurred on March 19, 361 A.D., and Tycho Bralie observed another on May 23, 1587.*
A close conjunction of Venus and Reguhi3 (a Leonis) is recorded by the Arabian astronomer, Ibii Yunis, as having occurred on September 9, 885 A.D. Calculations by Hind show that the planet and star were within 2' of arc on that night, and
consequently would have appeared as a single star to the naked eye. The telescope had not then been invented.5
Seen from Venus, the maximum apparent distance between the earth and moon would vary from about 5' to 31'.6

general did not seem indifferent, when he himself, with his piercing eyes, remarked the radiant body." The " star" in question was Venus. 1

CHAPTER IV
The Earth
THE
earth being our place of abode is, of
course, to us the most important planet in the solar system. It is a curious
paradox that the moon's surface (at least the visible portion) is better known to us than the
surface of the earth. Every spot on the moon's
visible surface equal in size to say Liverpool or
Glasgow is well known to lunar observers, whereas there are thousands of square miles on
the earth's surface for example, near the poles and in the centre of Australia which are wholly unknown to the earth's inhabitants ; and are
perhaps likely to remain so. Many attempts have been made by "para
doxers " to show that the earth is a flat plane and not a sphere. But M. Ricco has found by actual
experiment that the reflected image of the
setting sun from a smooth sea is an elongated
ellipse. This proves mathematically beyond all doubt that the surface of the sea is spherical ; for
the reflection from a plane surface would be



THE EARTH 33
necessarily circular. The theory of a " flat earth" is therefore proved to be quite unten
able, and all the arguments (?) of the "earth flatteners" have now been like the French Revolution " blown into space."
The pole of minimum temperature in the
northern hemisphere, or "the pole of cold," as it has been termed, is supposed to lie near Werchojansk in Siberia, where a temperature of nearly 70 has been observed. From a series of observations made at Annapolis
(U.S.A.) on the gradual disappearance of the blue of the sky after sunset, Dr. See finds that the
extreme height of the earth's atmosphere is about 130 miles. Prof. Newcomb finds that meteors first
appear at a mean height of about 74 miles.1
An aurora seen in Canada on July 15, 1893, was observed from stations 110 miles apart, and from these observations the aurora was found to lie at a height of 166 miles above the earth's
surface. It was computed that if the auroral "arch maintained an equal height above the earth its ends were 1150 miles away, so that the
magnificent sight was presented of an auroral belt in the sky with 2300 miles between its two extremities." 2 " Luminous clouds " are bright clouds sometimes seen at night near the end of June and beginning

34* ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of July. They appear above the northern horizon
over the sun's place about midnight, and evidently lie at a great height above the earth's surface. Observations made in Germany by Dr. Jesse, and
in England by Mr. Backhouse, in the years 1885-91, show that the height of these clouds is nearly constant at about 51 miles. 1 The present writer has seen these remarkable clouds on one or two
occasions in County Sligo, Ireland, during the period above mentioned. M. Montigny has shown that " the approach of violent cyclones or other storms is heralded by an
increase of scintillation" (or twinkling of the
stars). The effect is also very evident when such storms pass at a considerable distance. He has
also made some interesting observations (especially on the star Capella), which show that, not only does scintillation increase in rainy weather,
but that "it is very evident, at such times, in stars situated at an altitude at which on other occasions it would not be perceptible at all ; thus confirming the remark of Humboldt's with regard to the advent of the wet season in tropical
countries." 2
In a paper on the subject of " Optical Illusions "
in Popular Astronomy, February, 1906, Mr.

clouds " to light reflected from the dust of the Krakatoa eruption

THE EARTH 35
Arthur K. Bartlett, of Batter Creek, Michigan
(U.S.A.), makes the following interesting remarks :
" The lunar halo which by many persons is
regarded as a remarkable and unexplained
luminosity associated with the moon, is to
meteorological students neither a mysterious nor
an anomalous occurrence. It has been frequently
observed and for many years thoroughly under
stood, and at the present time admits of an easy
scientific explanation. It is an atmospheric ex
hibition due to the refraction and dispersion of
the moon's light through very minute ice crystals
floating at great elevations above the earth, and it is explained by the science of meteorology, to
which it properly belongs ; for it is not of
cosmical origin, and in no way pertains to
astronomy, as most persons suppose, except as
it depends on the moon, whose light passing
through the atmosphere, produces the luminous
halo, which as will be seen, is simply an optical
illusion, originating, not in the vicinity of the
moon two hundred and forty thousand miles
away but just above the earth's surface, and
within the aqueous envelope that surrounds it 011
all sides. ... A halo may form round the sun as
well as the moon . . . but a halo is more fre
quently noticed round the moon for the reason
that we are too much dazzled by the sun's light
to distinguish faint colours surrounding its disc,
and to see them it is necessary to look through
smoked glass, or view the sun by reflection from
the surface of still water, by which its brilliancy
is very mvich reduced." . . .
" A ' corona ' is an appearance of faintly coloured ings often seen around the sun and moon when



36 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
a light fleecy cloud passes over them, and should not be mistaken for a halo, which is much larger and more complicated in its structure. These
two phenomena are frequently confounded by inexperienced observers." With these remarks the present writer fully concurs. Mr. Bartlett adds
"As a halo is never seen except when the
sky is hazy, it indicates that moisture is ac
cumulating in the atmosphere which will form
clouds, and usually result in a storm. But the
popular notion that the number of bright stars
visible within the circle indicates the number of days before the storm will occur, is without
any foundation whatever, and the belief is almost
too absurd to be refuted. In whatever part of
the sky a lunar halo is seen, one or more bright
stars are always sure to be noticed inside the
luminous ring, and the number visible depends
entirely upon the position of the moon. More
over, when the sky within the circle is examined
with even a small telescope, hundreds of stars are
visible where only one, or perhaps two or three,
are perceived with the naked eye."
It is possible to have five Sundays in February
(the year must of course be a " leap year "). This occurred in the year 1880, Sunday falling on
February 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. But this will not
happen again till the year 1920. No century year (such as 1900, 2000, etc.) could possibly have five Sundays in February, aud the Rev. Richard
Campbell, who investigated this matter, finds



THE EARTH 37
the following sequence of years in which five Sundays occur in February: 1604, 1632, 1660,
1688, 1728, 1756, 1784, 1824, 1852, 1880, 1920, 1948,
1976. 1 In an article on "The Last Day and Year of
the Century: Remarks on Time Reckoning," in
Nature, September 10, 1896, Mr. W. T. Lynn, the
eminent astronomer, says, " The late Astronomer
Royal, Sir George Airy, once received a letter
requesting him to settle a dispute which had
arisen in some local debating society, as to which would be the first day of the next century. His
reply was, 'A very little consideration, will suffice to show that the first day of the twentieth
century will be January 1, 1901.' Simple as the matter seems, the fact that it is occasionally brought into question shows that there is some
little difficulty connected with it. Probably,
however, this is in a great measure due to the
circumstance that the actual figures are changed
on January 1, 1900, the day preceding being
December 31, 1899. A century is a very definite word for an interval respecting which there is no possible room for mistake or difference of opinion. But the date of its ending depends upon that of its beginning. Our double system of backward and forward reckoning leads to a good deal of
inconvenience. Our reckoning supposes (what we know was not the case, but as an era the date

does equally well) that Christ was born at the end
of B.C. 1. At the end of A.D. 1, therefore, one year had elapsed from the event, at the end of A.D. 100, one century, and at the end of 1900, nineteen
centuries. ... It is clear, then, that the year, as we call it, is an ordinal number, and that 1900 years from the birth of Christ (reckoning as we do
from B.C. 1) will not be completed until the end of December 31 in that year, the twentieth century
beginning with January 1, 1901, that is (to be
exact) at the previous midnight, when the day commences by civil reckoning." With these re
marks of Mr. Lynn I fully concur, and, so far as I know, all astronomers agree with him. As the
discussion will probably again arise at the end of the twentieth century, I would like to put on record here what the scientific opinion was at the
close of the nineteenth century.
Prof. E. Rutherford, the well-known authority
on radium, suggests that possibly radium is a source of heat from within the earth. Traces of radium have been detected in many rocks and soils, and even in sea water. Calcula
tion shows that the total amount distributed
through the earth's crust is enormously large, although relatively small " compared with the annual output of coal for the world." The
amount of radium necessary to compensate for the present loss of heat from the earth "corre
sponds to only five parts in one hundred million



THE EARTH 39
millions per unit mass," and the " observations of
Elster and Gertel show that the radio-activity
observed in soils corresponds to the presence of
about this proportion of radium." 1 The earth has 12 different motions. These are
as follows :
1. Rotation 011 its axis, having a period of 24 hours. 2. Revolution round the sun ; period 365J days.
3. Precession ; period of about 25,765 years.
4. Semi-lunar gravitation ; period 28 days.
5. Nutation ; period 18J years. 6. Variation in obliquity of the ecliptic ; about 47" in 100 years.

years.

system. 11. General motion of solar system in space.

With reference to the force of gravitation, on the earth and other bodies in the universe, Mr. William B. Taylor has well said, "With each revolving year new demonstrations of its absolute precision and of its universal domination serves only to fill the mind with added wonder and with added confidence in the stability and the supremacy of the power in which has been found no variableness neither shadow of turning, but
which the same yesterday, to-day and for ever

this mystery, and you have forgotten it," ' 2 This was written in the year 1899, and probably the

42 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
phenomenon of the aurora remains nearly as
great a mystery to-day. In 1839, MM. Bravais and Lottin made observations on the aurora in Norway in about N. latitude 70. Bravais found the height to be between 62 and 93 miles above the earth's surface.
The cause of the so-called Glacial Epoch in
the earth's history has been much discussed. The
Russian physicist, Rogovsky, has advanced the
following theory
" If we suppose that the temperature of the
sun at the present time is still increasing, or at
least has been increasing until now, the glacial
epoch can be easily accounted for. Formerly
the earth had a high temperature of its own,
but received a lesser quantity of heat from
the sun than now ; on cooling gradually, the
earth's surface attained such a temperature as
caused a great part of the surface of the northern
and southern hemispheres to be covered with ice ;
but the sun's radiation increasing, the glaciers
melted, and the climatic conditions became as
they are now. In a word, the temperature of the
earth's surface is a function of two quantities:
one decreasing (the earth's own heat), and the
other increasing (the sun's radiation), and conse
quently there may be a minimum, and this
minimum was the glacial epoch, which, as shown
by recent investigations, those of Luigi de Marchi
(Report of G. Schiaparelli, Meteorolog. Zeitschr.,
30, 130-136, 1895), are not local, but general for
the whole earth "

THE EARTH 43
Prof. Percival Lowell thinks that the life of
geological palaeozoic times was supported by the earth's internal heat, which maintained the ocean
at a comparatively warm temperature. 1 The following passage in the Book of the Maccabees may possibly refer to an aurora
" Now about this time Antiochus made his
second inroad into Egypt. And it so befell that
throughout all the city, for the space of almost
forty days, there appeared in the midst of the
sky horsemen in swift motion, wearing robes
inwrought with gold and carrying spears, equipped
in troops for battle ; and drawing of swords ; and
on the other side squadrons of horse in array ;
and encounters and pursuits of both armies ; and
shaking of shields, and multitudes of lances, and
casting of darts, and flashing of golden trappings,
and girding on of all sorts of armour. Wherefore
all men besought that the vision might have been
given for food." 2
According to Laplace "the decrease of the mean heat of the earth during a period of 2000
years has not, taking the extremist limits, diminished as much as ^th of a degree Fahrenheit." 3 From his researches on the cause of the Preces
sion of the Equinoxes, Laplace concluded that " the motion of the earth's axis is the same as if the

whole sea formed a solid mass adhering to its surface." l
Laplace found that the major (or longer) axis of the earth's orbit coincided with the line of
Equinoxes in the year 4107 B.C. The earth's perigee then coincided with the autumnal equinox. The epoch at which the major axis was perpen
dicular to the line of equinoxes fell in the year
1250 A.D. 2
Leverrier has found the minimum eccentricity of the earth's orbit round the sun to be 0*0047 ; so
that the orbit will never become absolutely
circular, as some have imagined.
Laplace says
"Astronomy considered in its entirety is the
finest monument of the human mind, the noblest
essay of its intelligence. Seduced by the illu
sions of the senses and of self-pride, for a long
time man considered himself as the centre of
the movement of the stars ; his vain-glory has
been punished by the terrors which his own
ideas have inspired. At last the efforts of
several centuries brushed aside the veil which
concealed the system of the world. We discover
ourselves upon a planet, itself almost imperceptible
in the vast extent of the solar system, which in
its turn is only an insensible point in the immen
sity of space. The sublime results to which this
discovery has led should suffice to console us for
our extreme littleness, and the rank which it assigns to the earth. Let us treasure with

solicitude, let us add to as we may, this store
of higher knowledge, the most exquisite treasure of thinking beings." l
With reference to probable future changes in
climate, the great physicist, Arrhenius, says
" We often hear lamentation that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present genera
tion without any thought of the future, and we
are terrified by the awful destruction of life and
property which has followed the volcanic erup
tions of our days. We may find a kind of consola
tion in the consideration that here, as in every
other case, there is good mixed with evil. By the
influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic
acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy
ages with more equable and better climates,
especially as regards the colder regions of the
earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much
more abundant crops than at present, for the
benefit of rapidly propagating mankind." 2
The night of July 1, 1908, was unusually bright. This was noticed in various parts of England and Ireland, and by the present writer in Dublin.
Humboldt states that " at the time of the new
moon at midnight in 1743, the phosphorescence was so intense that objects could be distinctly recognized at a distance of more than 600 feet." 3
An interesting proof of the earth's rotation on
its axis has recently been found.

46 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
" In a paper in the Proceedings of the Vienna
Academy (June, 1908) by Herr Tumlirz, it is shown
mathematically that if a liquid is flowing outwards
between two horizontal discs, the lines of flow will
be strictly straight only if the discs and vessel be
at rest, and will assume certain curves if that vessel
and the discs are in rotation, as, for example, due
to the earth's rotation. An experimental arrange
ment was set up with all precautions, and the
stream lines were marked with coloured liquids
and photographed. These were in general accord
with the predictions of theory and the supposition
that the earth is rotating about an axis." l
In a book published in 1905 entitled The
Rational Almanac, by Moses B. Cotsworth, of York, the author states that (p. 397), "The ex
planation is apparent from the Great Pyramid's Slope, which conclusively proves that when it was built the latitude of that region was 7'l more than at present. Egyptian Memphis now near Cairo was then in latitude 37'l, where Asia Minor now ranges, whilst Syria would then be where the Caucasus regions now experience those
rigorous winters formerly experienced in Syria." But the reality of this comparatively great change of latitude in the position of the Great Pyramid
can be easily disproved. Pytheas of Marseilles who lived in the time of Alexander the Great, about 330 B.C. measured the latitude of Marseilles by means of a gnomon, and found it to be about 42 56'f. As the present latitude of Marseilles is

43 17' 50", no great change in the latitude could have taken place in over 2000 years.1 From this we may conclude that the latitude of the Great
Pyramid has not changed by 7'l since its con
struction. There is, it is true, a slow diminution
going on in the obliquity of the ecliptic (or inclination of the earth's axis), but modern observations show that this would not amount to as much as one degree in 6000 years. Eudemus of Rhodes a disciple of Aristotle (who died in 322 B.C.) found
the obliquity of the ecliptic to be 24, which differs but little from its present value, 23 27'.
Al-Sufi in the tenth century measured the latitude
of Schiraz in Persia, and found it 29 30'. Its
present latitude is 29 36' SO",2 so that evidently
there has been no change in the latitude in 900
years.

CHAPTER V
The Moon
THE
total area of the moon's surface is about equal to that of North and South America. The actual surface visible at any one time is about equal to North America.
The famous lunar observer, Schroter, thought that the moon had an atmosphere, but estimated
its height at only a little over a mile. Its density he supposed to be less than that of the vacuum in
an air-pump. Recent investigations, however, seem to show that owing to its small mass and attractive force the moon could not retain an
atmosphere like that of the earth.
Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard (U.S.A.), finds
from a study of the moon (from a geological point of view) with the 15-inch refractor of the Harvard
Observatory, that our satellite has no atmosphere nor any form of organic life, and he believes that
its surface " was brought to its present condition before the earth had even a solid crust." l
There is a curious illusion with reference to the
1 Monthly Notices, B.A.S., February, 1905.



THE MOON 49
moon's apparent diameter referred to by Proctor.1 If, when the moon is absent in the winter months, we ask a person whether the moon's diameter is greater or less than the distance between the stars 8 and e, and e and Orionis, the three well-known stars in the " belt of Orion," the answer will probably be that the moon's apparent diameter is about equal to each of these distances. But in reality the apparent distance between S and c Orionis (or between c and , which is about the same) is more than double the moon's apparent diameter. This
seems at first sight a startling statement ; but its truth is, of course, beyond all doubt and is not
open to argument. Proctor points out that if a person estimates the moon as a foot in diameter,
as its apparent diameter is about half a degree, this would imply that the observer estimates the circumference of the star sphere as about 720 feet (360 x 2), and hence the radius (or the moon's distance from the earth) about 115 feet. But in
reality all such estimates have 110 scientific (that
is, accurate) meaning. Some of the ancients, such
as Aristotle, Cicero, and Heraclitus, seem to have estimated the moon's apparent diameter at about a foot.2 This shows that even great minds may make serious mistakes. It has been stated by some writer that the
moon as seen with the highest powers of the great

E



50 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Yerkes telescope (40 inches aperture) appears "just as it would be seen with the naked eye if it were suspended 60 miles over our heads." But
this statement is quite erroneous. The moon as seen with the naked eye or with a telescope shows
us nearly a whole hemisphere of its surface. But if the eye were placed only 60 miles from the
moon's surface, we should see only a small portion
of its surface. In fact, it is a curious paradox that
the nearer the eye is to a sphere the less we see of its surface! The truth of this will be evident
from the fact that on a level plain an eye placed
at a height, say 5 feet, sees a very small portion indeed of the earth's surface, and the higher we ascend the more of the surface we see. I find that at a distance of 60 miles from the moon's
surface we should only see a small portion of its
visible hemisphere (about ^th). The lunar features would also appear under a different aspect. The view would be more of a landscape than that seen in any telescope. This view of the
matter is not new. It has been previously pointed out, especially by M. Flammarion and Mr. Whit
mell, but its truth is not, I think, generally recognized. Prof. Newcomb doubts whether with any telescope the moon has ever been seen so well as it would be if brought within 500 miles of the
earth. A relief map of the moon 19 feet in diameter
was added, in 1898, to the Field Columbian



THE MOON 51
Museum (U.S.A.). It was prepared with great care from the lunar charts of Beer and Madler, and Dr. Schmidt of the Athens Observatory, and it shows the lunar features very accurately. Its construction took five years.
On a photograph of a part of the moon's surface near the crater Eratosthenes, Prof. William
H. Pickering finds markings which very much resemble the so-called "canals" of Mars. The
photograph was taken in Jamaica, and a copy of it is given in Prof. Pickering's book on the Moon, and in Popular Astronomy, February, 1904. Experiments made in America by Messrs. Stebbins and F. C. Brown, by means of selenium cells, show that the light of the full moon is about nine times that of the half moon ;
* and that " the
moon is brighter between the first quarter and
full than in the corresponding phase after full
moon." They also find that the light of the full moon is equal to "0*23 candle power," 1 that is, according to the method of measurement used in
America, its light is equal to 0*23 of a standard candle placed at a distance of one metre (39'37
inches) from the eye.2 Mr. H. H. Kimball finds that no less than 52 per
cent, of the observed changes in intensity of the
" earth-shine " visible on the moon when at 01 near the crescent phase is due to the eccentricity

52 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of the lunar orbit, and " this is probably much greater than could be expected from any increase or diminution in the average cloudiness over the
hemisphere of the earth reflecting light to the moon." l v The "moon maiden" is a term applied to a fancied resemblance of a portion of the Sinus Iridum to a female head. It forms the " pro
montory " known as Cape Heraclides, and may be looked for when the moon's "age" is about 11
days. Mr. C. J. Caswell, who observed it on
September 29, 1895, describes it as resembling " a beautiful silver statuette of a graceful female
figure with flowing hair." M. Landerer finds that the angle of polarization of the moon's surface about 33 agrees well
with the polarizing angle for many specimens of igneous rocks (30 51' to 33 46'). The polarizing angle for ice is more than 37, and this fact
is opposed to the theories of lunar glaciation advanced by some observers.2 Kepler states in his Somnium that he saw the moon in the crescent phase on the morning and evening of the same day (that is, before and after
conjunction with the sun). Kepler could see 14 stars in the Pleiades with the naked eye, so his
eyesight must have been exceptionally keen.
Investigations on ancient eclipses of the moon show that the eclipse mentioned by Josephus as
1 Nature, September 5, 1901. "
Ibid., July 31, 1890.



THE MOON 53
having occurred before the death of Herod is
probably that which took place 011 September 15, B.C. 5. This occurred about 9.45 p.m. ; and probably about six months before the death of Herod
(St. Matthew ii. 15).
The total lunar eclipse which occurred 011 October 4, 1884, was remarkable for the almost
total disappearance of the moon during totality. One observer says that " in the open air, if one had not known exactly where to look for it, one might have searched for some time without discovering
it. I speak of course of the naked eye appearance." * On the other hand the same observer,
speaking of the total eclipse of the moon on
August 23, 1877, which was a bright one, says
" The moon even in the middle of the total phase
was a conspicuous object in the sky, and the
ruddy colour was well marked. In the very
middle of the eclipse the degree of illumination
was as nearly as possible equal all round the edge
of the moon, the central parts being darker than
those near the edge."
In Roger de Hovedin's Chronicle (A.D. 756) an
account is given of the occultation of " a bright
star," by the moon during a total eclipse. This is confirmed by Simeon of Durham, who also dates
the eclipse A.D. 756. This is, however, a mistake, the eclipse having occurred on the evening of November 23, A.D. 755. Calvisius supposed that
1 Nature^ October 16, 1884.



54. ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
the occulted " star " might have been Aldebaran.
Pingre, however, showed that this was impossible,
and Struyck, in 1740, showed that the planet
Jupiter was the " star " referred to by the early observer. Further calculations by Hind (1885)
show conclusively that Struyck was quite correct, and that the phenomenon described in the old
chronicles was the occultation of Jupiter by
a totally eclipsed moon a rather unique phenomenon.1 An occultation of Mars by the moon is recorded
by the Chinese, on February 14, B.C. 69, and one of Venus, on March 30, A.D. 361. These have
also been verified by Hind, and his calculations show the accuracy of these old Chinese records. It has been suggested that the moon may
possibly have a satellite revolving round it, as the moon itself revolves round the earth. This
would, of course, form an object of great interest. During the total lunar eclipses of March 10 and
September 3, 1895, a careful photographic search was made by Prof. Barnard for a possible lunar satellite. The eclipse of March 10 was not very
suitable for the purpose owing to a hazy sky, but
that of September 3 was " entirely satisfactory," as the sky was very clear, and the duration of
totality was very long. On the latter occasion " six
splendid " photographs were obtained of the total phase with a 6-inch Willard lens. The result
1 Nature, February 19, 1885.



THE MOON 55
was that none of these photographs " show any
thing which might be taken for a lunar satellite,"
at least any satellite as bright as the 10th or
12th magnitude. It is, of course, just possible that the supposed satellite might have been behind
the moon during the totality. With reference to the attraction between the
earth and moon, Sir Oliver Lodge says
" The force with which the moon is held in its orbit would be great enough to tear asunder a steel
rod 400 miles thick, with a tenacity of 30 tons to
the square inch, so that if the moon and earth
were connected by steel instead of gravity, a
forest of pillars would be necessary to whirl the
system once a month round their common centre
of gravity. Such a force necessarily implies
enormous tensure or pressure in the medium.
Maxwell calculates that the gravitational stress
near the earth, which we must suppose to exist in
the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than
what the strongest steel can stand, and near the
sun it should be 2500 times as great as that." x
With reference to the names given to " craters "
on the moon, Prof. W. H. Pickering says,2 " The system of nomenclature is, I think, unfortunate.
The names of the chief craters are generally those
of men who have done little or nothing for
selenography, or even for astronomy, while the men who should be really commemorated are
1 Nature, January 14, 1909, p. 323.
Photographic Atlas of the Moon, Annah of Harvard Observatory vol. li. pp. 14, 15.



56 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
represented in general by small and unimportant
craters," and again
"A serious objection to the whole system
of nomenclature lies in the fact that it has
apparently been used by some selenographers,
from the earliest times up to the present, as a
means of satisfying their spite against some of
their contemporaries. Under the guise of pretend
ing to honour them by placing their names in
perpetuity upon the moon, they have used their
names merely to designate the smallest objects
that their telescopes were capable of showing.
An interesting illustration of this point is found
in the craters of Galileo and Riccioli, which lie
close together on the moon. It will be remembered
that Galileo was the discoverer of the craters on the moon. Both names were given by Riccioli,
and the relative size and importance of the craters
[Riccioli large, and Galileo very small] probably
indicates to us the relative importance that he
assigned to the two men themselves. Other
examples might be quoted of craters named in
the same spirit after men still living. . . . With
the exception of Maedler, one might almost say,
the more prominent the selenographer the more
insignificant the crater."
The mathematical treatment of the lunar theory
is a problem of great difficulty. The famous mathematician, Euler, described it as incredibile
studium atque indefessus labor.1 With reference to the "earth-shine" on the moon when in the crescent phase, Humbolclt says, " Lambert made the remarkable observation
1 Nature, January 18, 1906.



THE MOON 57
(14th of February, 1774) of a change of the ashcoloured moonlight into an olive-green colour, bordering upon yellow. The moon, which then stood vertically over the Atlantic Ocean, received
upon its night side the green terrestrial light, which
is reflected towards her when the sky is clear by the forest districts of South America." 1 Arago
said, "II n'est done pas impossible, malgre tout ce qu'un pareil resultat exciterait de surprise au
premier coup d'ceil qu'un jour les meteorologistes aillent puiser dans 1' aspect de la Lune des notions
precieuses sur Vetat moyen de diaphanite de
1' atmosphere terrestre, dans les hemispheres qui successivement concurrent a la production de la lumiere cendree." 2 The " earth-shine " on the new moon was success
fully photographed in February, 1895, by Prof. Barnard at the Lick Observatory, with a 6-iiich
Willard portrait lens. He says
"The earth-lit globe stands out beautifully round, encircled by the slender crescent. All
the ' seas ' are conspicuously visible, as are also
the other prominent features, especially the region
about Tycho. Aristarchus and Copernicus appear
as bright specks, and the light streams from
Tycho are very distinct." 3
Kepler found that the moon completely disappeared during the total eclipse of December 9,

1601, and Hevelius observed the same phenomenon
during the eclipse of April 25, 1642, when " not a vestige of the moon could be seen." l In the total
lunar eclipse of June 10, 1816, the moon during totality -was not visible in London, even with a
telescope ! l The lunar mountains are relatively much higher than those on the earth. Beer and Madler found
the following heights : Dorfel, 23,174 feet ; Newton,
22,141 ; Casatus, 21,102 ; Curtius, 20,632 ; Callippus, 18,946 ; and Tycho, 18,748 feet.2 Taking the earth's diameter at 7912 miles, the
moon's diameter, 2163 miles, and the height of Mount Everest as 29,000 feet, I find that

From which it follows that the lunar mountains
are proportionately about three times higher than those on the earth.
According to an hypothesis recently advanced by Dr. See, all the satellites of the solar system,
including our moon, were " captured " by their
primaries. He thinks, therefore, that the " moon came to earth from heavenly space." 3

CHAPTER VI
Mars
MARS
was called by the ancients " the
vanishing star," owing to the long periods during which it is practically invisible from the earth. 1 It was also called
Trupo'ei? and Hercules. I have seen it stated in a book on the " Solar System" by a well-known astronomer that the
axis of Mars " is inclined to the plane of the orbit "
at an angle of 24 50' ! But this is quite erroneous.
The angle given is the angle between the plane of the planet's equator and the plane of its orbit, which is quite a different thing. This angle, which may be called the obliquity of Mars' ecliptic, does not differ much from that of the earth. Lowell finds it 23 13' from observations
in 1907. 2
The late Mr. Proctor thought that Mars is " far the reddest star in the heavens ; Aldebaran and Antares are pale beside him." 3 But this does not
1 Nature, October 7, 1875. 2 Mars as an Abode of Life (1908), p. 281. 3 Knoioledge, May 2, 188G.



60 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
agree with my experience. Antares is to my eye quite as red as Mars. Its name is derived from two Greek words implying " redder than Mars." The colour of Aldebaran is, I think, quite com
parable with that of the " ruddy planet." In the telescope the colour of Mars is, I believe, more yellow than red, but I have not seen the planet very often in a telescope. Sir John Herschel suggested that the reddish colour of Mars may possibly be due to red rocks, like those of the Old
Red Sandstone, and the red soil often associated with such rocks, as I have myself noticed near Torquay and other places in Devonshire.
The ruddy colour of Mars was formerly thought to be due to the great density of its atmosphere. But modern observations seem to show that the
planet's atmosphere is, on the contrary, much rarer than that of the earth. The persistent
visibility of the markings on its surface shows that its atmosphere cannot be cloud-laden like ours ; and the spectroscope shows that the water
vapour present is although perceptible less than that of our terrestrial envelope. The existence of water vapour is clearly shown
by photographs of the planet's spectrum taken by Mr. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory in 1908. These show that the water vapour bands a and
near D are stronger in the spectrum of Mars than in that of the moon at the same altitude. 1
1 Nature, March 12, 1908.



MARS 61
The dark markings on Mars were formerly
supposed to represent water and the light parts land. But this idea has now been abandoned.
Light reflected from a water surface is polarized
at certain angles. Prof. W. H. Pickering, in his
observations on Mars, finds no trace of polariza
tion in the light reflected from the dark parts of the planet. But under the same conditions he finds that the bluish -black ring surrounding the white polar cap shows a well-marked polarization
of light, thus indicating that this dark ring is
probably water. 1 Projections on the limb of the planet have frequently been observed in America. These are known not to be mountains, as they do not reappear under similar conditions. They are sup
posed to be clouds, and one seen in December,
1900, has been ^explained as a cloud lying at a height of some 13 miles above the planet's surface and drifting at the rate of about 27 miles an hour. If there are any mountains on Mars they
have not yet been discovered.
The existence of the so-called " canals " of Mars is
supposed to be confirmed by Lowell's photographs of the planet. But what these "canals" really
represent, that is the question. They have certainly an artificial look about them, and they form one of the most curious and interesting problems in the heavens. Prof. Lowell says
1 Bulletin, Ast. Soc. de France, April, 1899.



62 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
" Most suggestive of all Martian phenomena are
the canals. Were they more generally observ
able the world would have been spared much
scepticism and more theory. They may of course
not be artificial, but observations here [Flag
staff] indicate that they are ; as will, I think,
appear from the drawings. For it is one thing to
see two or three canals and quite another to have
the planet's disc mapped with them on a most
elaborate system of triangulation. In the first
place they are this season (August, 1894) bluish
green, of the same colour as the seas into which the longer ones all eventually debouch. In the
next place they are almost without exception
geodetically straight, supernaturally so, and this in spite of their leading in every possible direc
tion. Then they are of apparently nearly
uniform width throughout their length. What
they are is another matter. Their mere aspect,
however, is enough to cause all theories about
glaciatioii fissures or surface cracks to die an
instant and natural death." l
Some of the observed colour-changes on Mars are very curious. In April, 1905, Mr. Lowell observed that the marking known as Mare
Erythrseurn, just above Syrtis, had "changed from a blue-green to a chocolate-brown colour." The season on Mars corresponded with our
February. Signor V. '
Cerulli says that, having observed Mars regularly for ten years, he has come to the conclusion that the actual existence of the
" canals " is as much a subject for physiological
1 Astronomy and Astrophysics (1894), p. C49.



MARS 63
as for astronomical investigation. He states that " the phenomena observed are so near the limit of
the range of the human eye that in observing them one really experiences an effect accompanying * the birth of vision.' That is to say, the eye sees more and more as it becomes accustomed, or strained, to the delicate markings, and thus the joining up of spots to form * canals ' and the
gemination of the latter follow as a physiological effect, and need not necessarily be subjective phenomena seen by the unaccustomed eye." l
The possibility of life on Mars has been recently much discussed ; some denying, others asserting. M. E. Rogovsky says
" As free oxygen and carbonic dioxide may
exist in the atmosphere of Mars, vegetable and
animal life is quite possible. If the temperature
which prevails upon Mars is nearer to 36 C.
than to 73 C., the existence of living beings
like ourselves is possible. In fact, the ice of
some Greenland and Alpine glaciers is covered
by red algse (Sphcerella nivalis) ; we find there
also different species of rotaloria, variegated
spiders, and other animals on the snow fields
illuminated by the sun; at the edges of glacier
snows in the Tyrol we see violet bells of
Soldanella pusilla, the stalks of which make
their way through the snow by producing heat
which melts it round about them. Finally the
Siberian town Verkhociansk, near Yakutsk, exists, though the temperature there falls to 69*8 C.
and the mean temperature of January to 51'2,
and the mean pressure of the vapour of water is
1 Nature, April 20, 1905.



64 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
less than 0*05mm. It is possible, therefore, that
living beings have become adapted to the con
ditions now prevailing upon Mars after the lapse
of many ages, and live at an even lower tem
perature than upon the earth, developing the
necessary heat themselves."
M. Rogovsky adds, " Water in organisms is mainly a liquid or solvent, and many other
liquids may be the same. We have no reason
to believe that life is possible only under the same conditions and with the same chemical
composition of organisms as upon the earth, although indeed we cannot affirm that they actually exist on Mars." l With the above views the present writer fully concurs. Prof. Lowell thinks that the polar regions of Mars, both north and south, are actually warmer
than the corresponding regions of the earth, although the mean temperature of the planet is probably twelve degrees lower than the earth's
mean temperature.2
A writer in Astronomy and Astrophysics (1892,
p. 748) says
" Whether the planet Mars is inhabited or not
seems to be the all-absorbing question with the
ordinary reader. With the astronomer this
query is almost the last thing about the planet

astronomer claims to know whether the planet is inhabited or not."
Several suggestions have been made with reference to the possibility of signalling to Mars. But, as Mr. Larkin of Mount Lowe (U.S.A.) points
out, all writers on this subject seem to forget the fact that the night side of two planets are never turned towards each other. " When the sun is between them it is day on the side of Mars which is towards us, and also day on the side of the earth Avhich is towards Mars. When they are on the same side of the sun, it is day on Mars when night on the earth, and for this reason they could never see our signals. This should make it apparent that the task of signalling to Mars is a
more difficult one than the most hopeful theorist has probably considered. All this is under the
supposition that the Martians (if there are such)
are beings like ourselves. If they are not like us, we cannot guess what they are like." l These views seem to me to be undoubtedly correct, and
show the futility of visual signals. Electricity might, however, be conceivably used for the purpose ; but even this seems highly improbable. Prof. Newcomb, in his work Astronomy for
Everybody, says with reference to this question, " The reader will excuse me from saying nothing
in this chapter about the possible inhabitants of
1 Popular Astronomy, vol. 12 (1904), p. 679.

Mars. He knows just as much about the subject
as I do, and that is nothing at all."
It is, however, quite possible that life in some form may exist on Mars. As Lowell well says,
" Life but waits in the wings of existence for its cue to enter the scene the moment the stage is
set." x With reference to the " canals " he says
" It is certainly no exaggeration to say that they
are the most astonishing objects to be viewed
in the heavens. There are celestial sights more
dazzling, spectacles that inspire more awe, but
to the thoughtful observer who is privileged to
see them well, there is nothing in the sky so
profoundly impressive as these canals of Mars." 2
The eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius thinks that the mean annual temperature on Mars may
possibly be as high as 50 F. He says, " Sometimes the snow-caps on the poles of Mars dis
appear entirely during the Mars summer ; this never happens on our terrestrial poles. The mean temperature of Mars must therefore be above zero,
probably about + 10 [Centigrade = 50 Fahrenheit]. Organic life may very probably thrive, therefore, on Mars." 3 He thinks that this excess of mean temperature above the calculated temperature may be due to an increased amount of
carbonic acid in the planet's atmosphere, and
says "any doubling of the percentage of carbon

MARS 67
dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth's surface by 4 ; and if the carbon
dioxide were increased fourfold, the temperature would rise by 8." l
Denning says, 2
" A few years ago, when christening celestial
formations was more in fashion than it is now,
a man simply had to use a telescope for an
evening or two on Mars or the moon, and spice
the relation of his seeings with something in the
way of novelty, when his name would be pretty
certainly attached to an object and hung in the
heavens for all time! A writer in the Astro
nomical Register for January, 1879, humorously
suggested that 'the matter should be put into
the hands of an advertising agent,' and 'made
the means of raising a revenue for astronomical
purposes.' Some men would not object to pay
handsomely for the distinction of having their
names applied to the seas and continents of Mars
or the craters of the moon."
An occultation of Mars by the moon is recorded
by Aristotle as having occurred on April 4,
357 B.C. 3 Seen from Mars the maximum apparent distance between the earth and moon would vary from 3^'
to nearly 17'. 4

CHAPTER VII
The Minor Planets
UP to 1908 the number of minor planets (or
asteroids) certainly known amounted to over 650. From an examination of the distribution of the
first 512 of these small bodies, Dr. P. Stroobant finds that a decided maximum in number occurs between the limits of distance of 2'55 and 2*85
(earth's mean distance from sun = 1), " 199 of the
asteroids considered revolving in this annulus." He finds that nearly all the asteroidal matter is concentrated near to the middle of the ring in the neighbourhood of the mean distance of 2*7, and the smallest asteroids are relatively less numerous in the richest zones. 1
There are some " striking similarities " in the
orbits of some of the asteroids. Thus, in the
small planets Sophia (No. 251 in order of dis
covery) and Magdalena (No. 318) we have the mean distance of Sophia 3*10, and that of
Magdalena 3*19 (earth's mean distance = 1).
1 Nature, May 2, 1907.



THE MINOR PLANETS 69
The eccentricities of the orbits are 0'09 and 0'07 ;
and the inclinations of the orbits to the plane of
the ecliptic 10 29' and 10 33' respectively.1 This
similarity may be and probably is merely accidental, but it is none the less curious and
interesting. Some very interesting discoveries have recently been made among the minor planets. The orbit of Eros intersects the orbit of Mars ; and the following have nearly the same mean distance from the sun as Jupiter :
Achilles (1906 TG), No. 588, Patrocles (1906 XY), No. 617,
Hector (1907 XM), No. 624,
and another (No. 659) has been recently found. Each of these small planets " moves approximately in a vertex of an equilateral triangle that it forms with Jupiter and the sun." 2 The minor planet
known provisionally as HN is remarkable for the
large eccentricity of its orbit (0*38), and its small perihelion distance (1'6). When discovered it had
a very high South Declination (61J), showing that the inclination of the plane of its orbit to
the plane of the ecliptic is considerable.3
Dr. Bauschinger has made a study of the minor planets discovered up to the end of 1900.
1 Nature, May 30, 1907. 2 Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, August, 1908. 3 Monthly Notices, R.A.S., 1902, p. 291.



TO ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
He finds that the ascending nodes of the orbits show a marked tendency to cluster near the
ascending node of Jupiter's orbit, a fact which agrees well with Prof. Newcomb's theoretical
results. There seems to be a slight tendency for
large inclinations and great eccentricities to go
together ; but there appears to be no connection between the eccentricity and the mean distance
from the sun. The longitudes of the perihelia of these small planets "show a well-marked
maximum near the longitude of Jupiter's perihelion, and equally well-marked minimum near
the longitude of his aphelion," which is again in good agreement with Newcomb's calculations. 1 Dr. Bauschinger's diameter for Eros is 20 miles.
He finds that the whole group, including those
remaining to be discovered, would probably form a sphere of about 830 miles in diameter. The total mass of the minor planets has been
frequently estimated, but generally much too high. Mr. B. M. Roszel of the John Hopkins University (U.S.A.) has made a calculation of the probable mass from the known diameter of Vesta (319 miles, Pickering), and finds the volume of the first 216 asteroids discovered. From this
calculation it appears that it would take 310
asteroids of the 6th magnitude, or 1200 of the 7th to equal the moon in volume. Mr. Rosxel concludes that the probable mass of the whole
1 Monthly Notices, K.A.S., February, 1902, p. 291.



THE MINOR PLANETS 71
asteroidal belt is between ^th and r^th of that of the moon. 1 Subsequently Mr. Roszel extended his study to the mass of 311 asteroids,2 and found a combined mass of about ^th of the moon's mass.
Dr. Palisa finds that the recently discovered
minor planet (1905 QY) varies in light to a considerable extent.3 This planet was discovered
by Dr. Max Wolf on August 23, 1905 ; but it was subsequently found that it is identical with
one previously known, (167) Urda.4 The light variation is said to be from the llth to the 13th magnitude.5 Variation in some of the other
minor planets has also been suspected. Prof. Wendell found a variation of about half a magni
tude in the planet Eunomia (No. 15). He also found that Iris (No. 7) varies about a quarter of a
magnitude in a period of about 6h 12m.
6 But these variations are small, and perhaps doubtful. The variability of Eros is well known.
The planet Eros is a very interesting one. The perihelion portion of its orbit lies between the
orbits of Mars and the earth, and the aphelion part is outside the orbit of Mars. Owing to the great variation in its distance from the earth the
brightness of Eros varies from the 6th to the 12th
magnitude. That is, when brightest, it is 250

72 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
times brighter than when it is faintest.1 This
variation of light, is of course, merely due to the variation of distance ; but some actual variation in
the brightness of the planet has been observed. It has been shown by Oeltzen and Valz that
Cacciatore's supposed distant comet, mentioned
by Admiral Smyth in his Bedford Catalogue, must have been a minor planet.2 Dr. Max Wolf discovered 36 new minor planets
by photography in the years 1892-95. Up to the latter year he had never seen one of these
through a telescope ! His words are, " Ich selsbt habe noch nie einen meinen kleinen Planeten
am Himmel geseheii." 3 These small bodies have now become so numerous that it is a matter of much difficulty to follow them. At the meeting of the Royal
Astronomical Society on January 8, 1909, Mr. G. F. Chambers made the following facetious remarks
" I would like to make a suggestion that has
been in my mind for several years past that
it should be made an offence punishable by fine
or imprisonment to discover any more minor
planets. They seem to be an intolerable nuisance,
and are a great burden upon the literary gentle
men who have to keep pace with them and record
them. I have never seen, during the last few

years at any rate, any good come from them,
or likely to come, and I should like to see the
supply stopped, and the energies of the German
gentlemen who find so many turned into more
promising channels."
Among the minor planets numbered 1 to 500, about 40 " have not been seen since the year of
their discovery, and must be regarded as lost." ]
1 Monthly Notices, R.A.S., February, 1909.



CHAPTER VIII
Jupiter
THIS
brilliant planet only inferior to Venus
in brightness was often seen by Bond (Jun.) with the naked eye in "high and
clear sunshine "
; also by Denning, who has very keen eyesight. Its brightness on such occasions
is so great, that like Venus it casts a distinct shadow in a dark room.1
The great " red spot " 011 Jupiter seems to have been originally discovered by Robert Hooke on May 9, 1664, with a telescope of 2 inches aperture and 12 feet focus. It seems to have existed ever since ; at least the evidence is, accord
ing to Denning, in favour of the identity of Hooke's spot with the red spot visible in recent
years. The spot was also observed by Cassini
in the years 1665-72, and is sometimes called '* Cassini's spot." But the real discoverer was Hooke. 2 The Orbit of Jupiter is so far outside the earth's
1 Celestial Objects, vol. i. p. 163. - Nature, December 29, 1898.



JUPITER 75
orbit tliat there can be little visible in the way of "phase" as in the case of Mars, where the
" gibbous " phase is sometimes very perceptible. Some books on astronomy state that Jupiter
shows no phase. But this is incorrect. A dis
tinct, although very slight, gibbous appearance is visible when the planet is near quadrature.
Webb thought it more conspicuous in twilight
than in a dark sky. With large telescopes, Jupiter's satellites II. and III. have been seen
in consequence of Jupiter's phase to emerge from occultation "at a sensible distance from
the limb." l
According to M. E. Rogovsky, the high " albedo of Jupiter, the appearance of the clear (red) and dark spots on its surface and their continual
variation, the different velocity of rotation of the
equatorial and other zones of its surface, and
particularly its small density (1*33, water as unity), all these facts afford irrefragable proofs of the high
temperature of this planet. The dense and opaque atmosphere hides its glowing surface from our
view, and we see therefore only the external surface of its clouds. The objective existence of
this atmosphere is proved by the bands and lines
of absorption in its spectrum. The interesting photograph obtained by Draper, September 27, 1879, in which the blue and green parts are more
brilliant for the equatorial zone than for the

76 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
adjacent parts of the surface, appears to show that
Jupiter emits its proper light. It is possible that the constant red spot noticed on its surface by
several observers, as Gledhill, Lord Rosse, and Copeland (1873), Russel and Bredikhm (1876), is the summit of a high glowing mountain. G. W. Hough considers Jupiter to be gaseous, and A. Ritter inferred from his formulae that in this
case the temperature at the centre would be
600,000 C." l The four brighter satellites of Jupiter are
usually known by numbers L, II., III., and IV. ; I. being the nearest to the planet, and IV. the
farthest. III. is usually the brightest, and IV.
the faintest, but exceptions to this rule have been
noticed. With reference to the recently discovered sixth and seventh satellites of Jupiter, Prof. Perrine has
suggested that the large inclination of their orbits
to the plane of, the planet's equator seems to indicate that neither of these bodies was originally
a member of Jupiter's family, but has been
" captured by the planet." This seems possible as the orbits of some of the minor planets lie near
the orbit of Jupiter (see "Minor Planets"). A similar suggestion has been made by Prof, del Marmol.2 Many curious observations have been recorded
1 Aatrophysical Journal, vol. 14 (1901), pp. 248-9. * Nature, August 27, 1908.



JUPITER 77
with reference to Jupiter's satellites ; some very
difficult of explanation. In 1711 Bianchini saw satellite IV. so faint for more than an hour that it was hardly visible ! A similar observation was
made by Lassell with a more powerful telescope on June 13, 1849. Key, T. T. Smyth, and Denning
have also recorded unusual faintness.1 A very remarkable phenomenon was seen by Admiral
Smyth, Maclear, and Pearson on June 26, 1828.
Satellite II., "having fairly entered on Jupiter, was found 12 or 13 minutes afterwards outside the
limb, where it remained visible for at least 4 minutes, and then suddenly vanished." As Webb says, " Explanation is here set at defiance ; demon
strably neither in the atmosphere of the earth, nor Jupiter, where and what could have been the cause ? At present we can get no answer." 3
When Jupiter is in opposition to the sun that is, on the meridian at midnight satellite I. has been
seen projected on its own shadow, the shadow
appearing as a dark ring round the satellite.
On January 28, 1848, at Cambridge (U.S.A.) satellite III. was seen in transit lying between the shadows of I. and II. and so black that it
could not be distinguished from the shadows, " except by the place it occupied." This seems to
suggest inherent light in the planet's surface, as the satellite was at the time illuminated by full
1 Webb's Celestial Objects, vol. i. p. 177. 2 Ibid., vol. i. p. 187.



78 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
sunshine ; its apparent blackness being due to the effect of contrast. Cassini on one occasion failed
to find the shadow of satellite I. when it should have been on the planet's disc,1 an observation
which again points to the glowing light of Jupiter's surface. Sadler and Trouvelot saw the shadow of
satellite I. double ! an observation difficult to
explain but the same phenomenon was again seen on the evening of September 19, 1891, by Mr. H. S. Halbert of Detroit, Michigan (U.S.A.). He says that the satellite "was in transit nearing
egress, and it appeared as a white disc against the dark southern equatorial belt; following it was the usual shadow, and at an equal distance from this was a second shadow, smaller and not so dark as the true one, and surrounded by a faint
penumbra." 2
A dark transit of satellite III. was again
seen 011 the evening of December 19, 1891, by two observers in America. One observer noted that the satellite, when on the disc of the planet, was intensely black. To the other observer
(Willis L. Barnes) it appeared as an ill-defined
dark image.3 A similar observation was made on October 9 of the same year by Messrs. Gale
and Innes.4

JUPITER 79
A " black transit " of satellite IV. was seen by several observers in 1873, and by Prof. Barnard on May 4, 1886. The same phenomenon was observed
011 October 30, 1903, in America, by Miss Anne S. Young and Willis S. Barnes. Miss Young says
" The ingress of the satellite took place at 8h 50|n
(E. standard time) when it became invisible upon
the background of the planet. An hour later it
was plainly visible as a dark round spot upon
the planet. It was decidedly darker than the
equatorial belt." x
The rather rare phenomenon of an occultation of one of Jupiter's satellites by another was observed by Mr. Apple, director of the Daniel Scholl
Observatory, Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa. (U.S.A.), on the evening of March 16, 1908. The satellites in question were I. and II., and they were so close that they could not be
separated with the 11 '5-inch telescope of the
Observatory.2 One of the present writer's first observations with a telescope is dated May 17,
1873, and is as follows : " Observed one of
Jupiter's satellites occulted (or very nearly so) by
another. Appeared as one with power 133 " (on
3-inch refractor in the Punjab). These satellites
were probably I. and II. Jupiter has been seen on several occasions
apparently without his satellites; some being

80 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
behind the disc, some eclipsed in his shadow, and some in transit across the disc. This phenomenon
was seen by Galileo, March 15, 1611 ; by Molyneux, on November 12, 1681 ; by Sir William Herschel,
May 23, 1802; by Wallis, April 15, 1826; by Greisbach, September 27, 1843 ; and by several observers on four occasions in the years 1867-1895.1 The phenomenon again occurred on October 3,
1907, No. 1 being eclipsed and occulted, No. 2 in transit, No. 3 eclipsed, and No. 4 occulted.2 It
was not, however, visible in Europe, but could have been seen in Asia and Oceania.2 The
phenomenon will occur again on October 22, 1913.3
On the night of September 19, 1903, a star of magnitude 6J was occulted by the disc of Jupiter. This curious and rare phenomenon was photo
graphed by M. Lucien Rudaux at the Observatory of Donville, France.4 The star was Lalande
45698 (=BAC8129).5 Prof. Barnard, using telescopes with apertures from 5 inches up to 36 inches (Lick), has failed to
see a satellite through the planet's limb (an observation which has been claimed by other
astronomers). He says, "To my mind this has

JUPITER 81
been due to either poor seeing, a poor telescope, or an excited observer." 1 He adds
"I think it is high time that the astronomers
reject the idea that the satellites of Jupiter can be
seen through his limb at occultation. When the
seeing is bad there is a spurious limb to Jupiter
that well might give the appearance of trans
parency at the occultation of a satellite. But
under first-class conditions the limb of Jupiter is
perfectly opaque. It is quibbling and begging the
question altogether to say the phenomenon of
transparency may be a rare one and so have
escaped my observations. Has any one said that
the moon was transparent when a star has been
seen projected on it when it ought to have been
behind it?"
Prof. Barnard and Mr. Douglass have seen white polar caps 011 the third and fourth satellites
of Jupiter. The former says they are "exactly like those on Mars." "Both caps of the fourth
satellite have been clearly distinguished, that at
the north being sometimes exceptionally large, covering a surface equal to one-quarter or onethird of the diameter of the satellite." 2 This was confirmed on November 23, 1906, when Signor J. Comas Sola observed a brilliant white spot surrounded by a dark marking in the north polar region of the third satellite. There were other
dark markings visible, and the satellite presented the appearance of a miniature of Mars.8

82 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
An eighth satellite of Jupiter has recently been discovered by Mr. Melotte at the Greenwich
Observatory by means of photography. It moves in a retrograde direction round Jupiter in an orbit inclined about 30 to that of the planet. The period of revolution is about two years. The
orbit is very eccentric, the eccentricity being about one-third, or greater than that of any other satellite of the solar system. When
nearest to Jupiter it is about 9 millions of miles from the planet, and when farthest about 20
millions. 1 It has been suggested by Mr. George
Forbes that this satellite may possibly be identical with the lost comet of Lexell which at its return
in the year 1779 became entangled in Jupiter's system, and has not been seen since. If this be the case, we should have the curious phenomenon
of a comet revolving round a planet ! According to Humboldt the four bright satellites
of Jupiter were seen almost simultaneously and quite independently by Simon Marius at Ausbach on December 29, 1609, and by Galileo at Padua on
January 7, 1610.2 The actual priority, therefore, seems to rest with Simon Marius, but the
publication of the discovery was first made by Galileo in his Nuncius Siderius (1610). 3 Grant,
however, in his History of Physical Astronomy,

!
(p. 79).
M. Dupret at Algiers saw Jupiter with the naked eye on September 26, 1890, twenty minutes before sunset. 1 Humboldt states that he saw Jupiter with the naked eye when the sun was from 18 to 20 above the horizon.2 This was in the plains of South America near the sea-level.

CHAPTER IX
Saturn
TO show the advantages of large telescopes
over small ones, Mr. C. Roberts says that "with the 25-inch refractor of the
Cambridge Observatory the view of the planet Saturn is indescribably glorious ; everything I had ever seen before was visible at a glance, and an enormous amount of detail that I had never
even glimpsed before, after a few minutes' observation." l Chacornac found that the illumination of
Saturn's disc is the reverse of that of Jupiter,
the edges of Saturn being brighter than the centre of the disc, while in the case of Jupiter as in that of the sun the edges are fainter than
the centre.2 According to Mr. Denning, Saturn
bears satisfactorily "greater magnifying power than either Mars or Jupiter." 3 At an occultation of Saturn by the moon, which occurred on June 13, 1900, M. M. Honorat
1 Journal, B.A.A., June, 1896. 2 Celestial Objects, vol. i. p. 191. 3 Nature, May 30, 1901.



SATURN 85
noticed the great contrast between the slightly yellowish colour of the moon and the greenish tint of the planet. 1 In the year 1892, when the rings of Saturn had
nearly disappeared, Prof. L. W. Underwood, of the Underwood Observatory, Appleton, Wisconsin (U.S.A.), saw one of Saturn's satellites
(Titan) apparently moving along the needlelike appendage to the planet presented by the rings. " The apparent diameter of the satellite so far exceeded the apparent thickness of the ring
that it gave the appearance of a beautiful golden
bead moving very slowly along a fine golden thread." 2 In 1907, when the rings of Saturn became
invisible in ordinary telescopes, Professor Campbell, observing with the great Lick telescope, noticed " prominent bright knots, visible . , . in Saturn's rings. The knots were symmetrically placed, two being to the east and two to the west." This was confirmed by Mr. Lowell, who says, " Condensations in Saturn's rings confirmed
here and measured repeatedly. Symmetric and permanent." This phenomenon was previously seen by Bond in the years 1847-56. Measures of these light spots made by Prof. Barnard with the 40 -inch Yerkes telescope show that the outer
one corresponded in position with the outer edge
1 Bulletin, Ast. Soc. de France, August, 1900. 2 Astronomy and Astrophysics, 1892.



86 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of the middle ring close to the Cassini division, and the inner condensation, curious to say, seemed to coincide in position with the "crape ring." Prof. Barnard thinks that the thickness of the rings "must be greatly under 100 miles,
and probably less than 50 miles," and he says
"The important fact clearly brought out at
this apparition of Saturn is that the bright rings
are not opaque to the light of the sun and this
is really what we should expect from the nature
of their constitution as shown by the theory of
Clerk Maxwell, and the spectroscopic results of
Keeler." 1
Under certain conditions it would be theo
retically possible, according to Mr. Whitmell, to see the globe of Saturn through the Cassini division in the ring. But the observation would
be one of great difficulty and delicacy. The effect would be that, of the arc of the division Avhich
crosses the planet's disc, "a small portion will appear bright instead of dark, and may almost
disappear." 2
A remarkable white spot was seen on Saturn on
June 23, 1903, by Prof. Barnard, and afterwards by Mr. Denning.3 Another white spot was seen
by Denning on July 9 of the same year.4 From numerous observations of these spots, Denning found a rotation period for the planet of about

SATURN 87
10h 39 m 21s
. 1 From observations of the same spots
Signer Comas Sola found a period 10h 38m<4, a close
agreement with Denning's result. For Saturn's
equator, Prof. Hill found a rotation period of
10h 14m 23S>8, so that as in the case of Jupiter
the rotation is faster at the equator than in the
northern latitudes of the planet. A similar
phenomenon is observed in the sun. Mr. Denning's
results were fully confirmed by Herr Leo Brenner, and other German astronomers. 2
Photographs taken by Prof. V. M. Slipher in America show that the spectrum of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter. None of the bands
observed in the planet's spectrum are visible in the spectrum of the rings. This shows that if the
rings possess an atmosphere at all, it must be much rarer than that surrounding the ball of the
planet. Prof. Slipher says that " none of the
absorption bands in the spectrum of Saturn can be identified with those bands due to absorption
in the earth's atmosphere," and there is no trace
of aqueous vapour.3 In September, 1907, M. G. Fournier suspected the existence of a " faint transparent and luminous
ring " outside the principal rings of Saturn. He
thinks that it may possibly be subject to periodical fluctuations of brightness, sometimes being visible

and sometimes not. 1 This dusky ring was again
suspected at the Geneva Observatory in October, 1908.2 M. Schaer found it a difficult object with a
16-inch Cassegraiii reflector. Prof. Stromgen at
Copenhagen, and Prof. Hartwig at Bamberg, however, failed to see any trace of the supposed
ring.3 It was seen at Greenwich in October, 1908. A "dark transit" of Saturn's satellite Titan across the disc of the planet has been observed on several occasions. It was seen by Mr. Isaac W.
Ward, of Belfast, on March 27, 1892, with a 4 '3-inch Wray refractor. The satellite appeared
smaller than its shadow. The phenomenon was also seen on March 12 of the same year by the
Rev. A. Freeman, Mr. Mee, and M. F. Terby ; and again on November 6, 1907, by Mr. Paul Chauleur and Mr. A. B. Cobham.4
The recently discovered tenth satellite of Saturn,
Themis, was discovered by photography, and has never been seen by the eye even with the largest
telescopes ! But its existence is beyond all doubt, and its orbit round the planet has been calculated.
Prof. Hussey of the Lick Observatory finds that
Saturn's satellite Mimas is probably larger than Hyperion. He also finds from careful measurements that the diameter of Titan is certainly

overestimated, and that its probable diameter is about 2500 miles.1
The French astronomer, M. Lucien Rudaux, finds the following variation in the light of the
satellites of Saturn :
Japetus from 9th magnitude to 12th Ehea 9 10-6 Dione 9'5 10'5 Tethye 9'8 10-5 Titan 8 8'6
The variation of light is, he thinks, due to the fact that the period of rotation of each satellite is equal to that of their revolution round the planet ; as in the case of our moon. 2 The names of the satellites of Saturn are derived from the ancient heathen mythology. They are given in order of distance from the planet, the nearest being Mimas and the farthest Themis. 1. Mimas was a Trojan born at the same time as Paris. 2. Enceladus was son of Tartarus and Ge.
3. Tethys was wife of Oceanus, god of ocean currents. She became mother of all the chief
rivers in the universe, as also the Oceanides or sea
nymphs. 4. Dione was one of the wives of Zeus. 5. Rhea was a daughter of Uranus. She married Saturn, and became the mother of Vesta,
Ceres, Juno, and Pluto.

6. Titan was the eldest son of Uranus.
7. Hyperion was the god of day, and the father of sun and moon.
8. Japetus was the fifth son of Uranus, and
father of Atlas and Prometheus. 1 9. Phcebe was daughter of Uranus and Ge. 10. Themis was daughter of Uranus and Ge,
and, therefore, sister of Phoebe. In a review of Prof. Comstock's Text Book of
Astronomy in The Observatory, November, 1901,
the remark occurs, " We are astonished to see that Mr. Comstock alludes with apparent serious
ness to the nine satellites of Saturn. As regards the ninth satellite, we thought that all astronomers
held with Mrs. Betsy Prig on the subject of this astronomical Mrs. Harris." This reads curiously now (1909) when the existence of the ninth
satellite (Phoebe) has been fully confirmed, and a tenth satellite discovered.

CHAPTER X
Uranus and Neptune
FROM
observations of Uranus made in 1896, M. Leo Brenner concluded that the planet rotates on its axis in about 8^ hours
(probably 8h 27 m
). This is a short period, but
considering the short periods of Jupiter and Saturn there seems to be nothing improbable about it.
Prof. Barnard finds that the two inner
satellites of Uranus are difficult objects even
with the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick
Observatory ! They have, however, been photographed at Cambridge (U.S.A.) with a 13-inch lens, although they are " among the most difficult objects known." l
Sir William Huggins in 1871 found strong
absorption lines (six strong lines) in the spectrum of Uranus. One of these lines indicated the
presence of hydrogen, a gas which does not exist in our atmosphere. Three of the other lines seen were situated near lines in the spectrum of atmospheric air. Neither carbonic acid nor sodhim

92 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
showed any indications of their presence in the
planet's spectrum. A photograph by Prof. Slipher of Neptune's spectrum " shows the spectrum of this planet to contain many strong absorption bands. These bands are so pronounced in the part of the spectrum between the Fraunhofer lines
F and D, as to leave the solar spectrum unrecog
nizable. . . . Neptune's spectrum is strikingly different from that of Uranus, the bands in the
latter planet all being reinforced in Neptune. In this planet there are also new bands which have not been observed in any of the other planets.
The F line of hydrogen is remarkably dark . . . this band is of more than solar strength in the
spectrum of Uranus also. Thus free hydrogen
seems to be present in the atmosphere of both these planets. This and the other dark bands
in these planets bear evidence of an enveloping
atmosphere of gases which is quite unlike that which surrounds the earth." l
With the 18-inch equatorial telescope of the
Strasburgh Observatory, M. Wirtz measured the diameter of Neptune, and found from forty-nine measures made between December 9, 1902, and March 28, 1903, a value of 2"'303 at a distance of 30*1093 (earth's distance from sun = l). This given
a diameter of 50,251 kilometres, or about 31,225 miles,2 and a mean density of 1*54 (water=l;

earth's mean density = 5'53). Prof. Barnard's
measures gave a diameter of 32,900 miles, a
fairly close agreement, considering the difficulty of measuring so small a disc as that shown by
Neptune. The satellite of Neptune was photographed at the Pulkown Observatory in the year 1899. The name Triton has been suggested for it. In the old Greek mythology Triton was a son of Neptune, so the name would be an appropriate one. The existence of a second satellite of Neptune
is suspected by Prof. Schaeberle, who thinks he once saw it with the 36-inch telescope of the Lick
Observatory "on an exceptionally fine night " iii 1895.1 But this supposed discovery has not yet been confirmed. Lassell also thought he had
discovered a second satellite, but this supposed discovery was never confirmed. 1 The ancient Burmese mention eight planets, the
sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and another named Rahu, which is in
visible. It has been surmised that " Rahu " is
Uranus, which, is just visible to the naked eye, and may possibly have been discovered by keen eyesight in ancient times. The present writer has seen it several times without optical aid in the West of Ireland, and with a binocular field- glass
of 2 inches aperture he found it quite a con
spicuous object.

94 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
When Neptune was visually discovered by Galle, at Berlin, he was assisted in his observation by Prof, d'Arrest. The incident is thus described by Dr. Dreyer, " On the night of June 14,
1874, while observing Coggia's comet together, I reminded Prof, d' Arrest how he had once said in the course of a lecture, that he had been present
at the finding of Neptune, and that * he might say it would not have been found without him.' He then told me (and I wrote it down the next day), how he had suggested the use of Bremiker's map
(as first mentioned by Dr. Galle in 1877) and con
tinued, * We then went back to the dome, where there was a kind of desk, at which I placed myself
with the map, while Galle, looking through the
refractor, described the configurations of the stars he saw. I followed them on the map one by one, until he said : " And then there is a star of the
8th magnitude, in such and such a position," whereupon I immediately exclaimed : " That star is not on the map," ' x This was the planet. But it seems to the present writer that if Galle or
d' Arrest had access to Harding's Atlas (as they
probably had) they might easily have found the planet with a good binocular field-glass. As a matter of fact Neptune is shown in Harding's Atlas (1822) as a star of the 8th magnitude, having been mistaken for a star by Lalande on May 8 and 10, 1795 ; and the present writer has

URANUS AND NEPTUNE 95
found Harding's 8th magnitude stars quite easy objects with a binocular field- glass having objectglasses of two inches diameter, and a power of about six diameters. SUPPOSED PLANET BEYOND NEPTUNE. The
possible existence of a planet beyond Neptune has been frequently suggested. From considerations on the aphelia of certain comets, Prof. Forces
in 1880 computed the probable position of such a body. He thought this hypothetical planet would be considerably larger than Jupiter, and probably revolve round the sun at a distance of about 100 times the earth's mean distance from the sun. The place indicated was between R.A. llh 24m and 12h 12m
, and declination 0' to 6 0' north. With a view to its discovery, the late Dr. Roberts took a
series of eighteen photographs covering the region indicated. The result of an examination of these
photographs showed, Dr. Roberts says, that " no planet of greater brightness than a star of the 1 5th magnitude exists on the sky area herein
indicated." Prof. W. H. Pickering has recently revived the question, and has arrived at the
following results : Mean distance of the planet
from the sun, 51'0 (earth's mean distance = 1);
period of revolution, 373J years ; mass about twice the earth's mass ; probable position for
1909 about R.A. 7h 47m
, north declination 21, or about 5 south-east of the star * Geminorum.
The supposed planet would be faint, its brightness



96 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
being from 11 J to 13J, according to the " albedo"
(or reflecting power) it may have. 1 Prof. Forbes has again attacked the question of
a possible ultra-Neptunian planet, and from a consideration of the comets of 1556, 1843 I, 1880 I, and 1882 II, finds a mean distance of 105*4, with
an inclination of the orbit of 52 to the plane of
the ecliptic. This high inclination implies that
"during the greatest part of its revolution it is
beyond the zodiac," and this, Mr. W. T. Lynn
thinks, "may partly account for its not having hitherto been found by observation.2
From a consideration of the approximately
circular shape of the orbits of all the large planets
of the solar system, Dr. See suggests the existence
of three planets outside Neptune, with approximate distances from the sun of 42, 56, and 72
respectively (earth's distance = 1), and recommends a photographic search for them. He says, "To
suppose the planetary system to terminate with an orbit so round as that of Neptune is as absurd
as to suppose that Jupiter's system terminates with the orbit of the fourth satellite." 3
According to Grant, even twenty years before the discovery of Neptune the error of Prof.
Adams' first approximation amounted to little more than 10.4

CHAPTER XI
Comets
WE learn from Pliny that comets were
classified in ancient times, according
to their peculiar forms, into twelve
classes, of which the principal were : Pogonias, bearded ; Lampadias, torch-like ; Xiphias, sword
like ; Pitheus, tun-like ; Acontias, javelin-like ; Ceratias, horn-like ; Disceus, quoit-like ; and Hippias, horse-mane-like.1 Of the numerous comets mentioned in astrono
mical records, comparatively few have been visible to the naked eye. Before the invention of the tele
scope (1610) only those which were so visible could, of course, be recorded. These number about 400. Of the 400 observed since then, some 70 or 80 only have been visible by unaided vision ; and most of these now recorded could never have been seen
without a telescope. During the last century, out of 300 comets discovered, only 13 were very visible to the naked eye. Hence, when we read in the newspapers that a comet has been discovered the

H



98 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
chances are greatly against it becoming visible to the naked eye.1
Although comparatively few comets can be seen without a telescope, they are sometimes bright enough to be visible in daylight ! Such were those
of B.C. 43, A.D. 1106, 1402, 1532, 1577, 1744, 1843,
and the " great September comet " of 1882.
If we except the great comet of 1861, through the tail of which the earth is supposed to have passed, the comet which came nearest to the earth was
that of 1770, known as Lexell's, which approached us within two millions of miles, moving nearly in
the plane of the ecliptic. It produced, however, no effect on the tides, nor on the moon's motion, which shows that its mass must have been very
small. It was computed by Laplace that if its mass had equalled that of the earth, the length of our year would have been shortened by 2 hours
47 minutes, and as there was no perceptible change Laplace concluded that the comet's mass did not exceed ^otn of tne earth's mass. This is the comet which passed so near to Jupiter that its period was reduced to 5J years. Owing to another near approach in 1779 it became invisible
from the earth, and is now lost. 2 Its identity with
the recently discovered eighth satellite of Jupiter has been suggested by Mr. George Forbes (see under
" Jupiter "). At the near approach of Lexell's comet
to the earth in 1770, Messier, " the comet ferret,

COMETS 99
found that its head had an apparent diameter of 2J, or nearly five times that of the moon ! Another case^of near approach to the earth was
that of Biela's comet at its appearance in 1805. On the evening of December 9 of that year, the comet approached the earth within 3,380,000 miles. 1
The comet of A.D. 1106 is stated to have been seen in daylight close to the sun. This was on
February 4 of that year. On February 10 it had a tail of 60 in length, according to Gaubil.2 The comet of 1577 seems to have been one of the
brightest on record. According to Tycho Brahe, it was visible in broad daylight. He describes the
head as " round, bright, and of a yellowish light," with a curved tail of a reddish colour.3 The comet of 1652 was observed for about three weeks only, and Hevelius and Comiers state that
it was equal to the moon in apparent size ! This
would indicate a near approach to the earth. An
orbit computed by Halley shows that the least distance was about 12 millions of miles, and the diameter of the comet's head rather less than
110,000 miles, or about 14 times the earth's diameter.
According to Mr. Denning, " most of the periodical comets at perihelion are outside the
earth's orbit, and hence it follows that they escape

observation unless the earth is on the same side of the sun as the comet." l
It was computed by M. Faye that the volume of the famous Donati's comet (1858) was about 500 times that of the sun ! On the other hand, he calculated that its mass (or quantity of matter it
contained) was only a fraction of the earth's mass. This shows how almost inconceivably tenuous the material forming the comet must have been
much more rarefied, indeed, than the most perfect vacuum which can be produced in an air-pump. This tenuity is shown by the fact that stars were seen through the tail "as if the tail did not
exist." A mist of a few hundred yards in thick
ness is sufficient to hide the stars from our view, while a thickness of thousands of miles of cometary matter does not suffice even to dim their
brilliancy ! At the time of the appearance of the great comet of 1843, it was doubtful whether the comet
had transited the sun's disc. But it is now known, from careful calculations by Prof. Hubbard, that
a transit really took place between llh 28m and 12h 29m on February 27, 1843, and might have been observed in the southern hemisphere. The distance of this remarkable comet from the sun at
its perihelion passage was less than that of any
known comet. A little before 10 p.m. on Feb
ruary 27, the comet passed within 81,500 miles of

COMETS 101
the sun's surface with the enormous velocity of 348 miles a second ! It remained less than 2 hours
north of the ecliptic, passing from the ascending
to the descending node of its orbit in 2h 13m*4.1
The great comet of 1882 transited the sun's disc
on Sunday, September 17, of that year, the ingress taking place at 4h 50m 58s
, Cape mean time. When
on the sun the comet was absolutely invisible, showing that there was nothing solid about it. It was visible near the sun with the naked eye a little before the transit took place.2 This great
comet was found by several computers to have
been travelling in an elliptic orbit with a period of about eight centuries. Morrison found 712
years ; Frisby, 794 ; Fabritius, 823 ; and Kreutz,
843 years.3 The great southern comet of 1887 may be described as a comet without a head ! The popular idea of a comet is a star with a tail. But in this case there was no head visible to the naked eye at least. Dr. Thome of the Cordoba Observatory its discoverer describes it as " a beautiful object
a narrow, straight, sharply denned, graceful tail, over 40 long, shining with a soft starry light against a dark sky, beginning apparently without a head, and gradually widening and fading as it extended upwards." 4

102 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
The great southern comet of 1901 had five tails
on May 6 of that year. Two were fairly bright, and the remaining three rather faint. Mr. Gale
saw a number of faint stars through the tails. The light of these seem to have been "undimmed." Mr. Cobham noticed that the stars Rigel
and /5 Eridani shone through one of the faint tails,
and " showed no perceptible difference." * Prof. W. H. Pickering says that " the head of a
comet, as far as our present knowledge is concerned, seems therefore to be merely a meteor swarm containing so much gaseous material that
when electrified by its approach to the sun it will
be rendered luminous" (Harvard Annual, vol. xxxii. part ii. p. 295) "... if the meteors and their
atmospheres are sufficiently widely separated from one another, the comet may be brilliant and yet transparent at the same time." In the case of Swift's comet of 1892 some
periodical differences of appearance were due, according to Prof. W. H. Pickering, to a rotation
of the comet round an axis passing longitudinally through the tail, and he estimated the period of rotation at about 94 to 97 hours. He computed that in this comet the repulsive force exerted by the sun on the comet's tail was " about 39' 5 times
the gravitational force." 2 The comet known as 19026 approached the

UNIVERSITY
COMETS 103
planet Mercury within two millions of miles on
November 29 of that year. Prof. O. C. Wendell, of
Harvard Observatory, made some observations on the transparency of this comet. He found with the aid of a photometer and the 15-inch telescope of the observatory that in the case of two faint stars over which the comet passed on October 14,
1902, the absorption of light by the comet was insensible, and possibly did not exceed one or two hundredths of a magnitude,1 an amount quite imperceptible to the naked eye, and shows con
clusively how almost inconceivably rarefied the substance of this comet must be. The comet known as Morehouse (1908c) showed some curious and wonderful changes. Mr. Borelly
found that five tails are visible on a photographic plate taken on October 3, 1908, and the trail of an
occulted star indicates a slight absorption effect.
According to M. L. Rabourdin, great changes took place from day to day, and even during the course of an hour ! Similar changes were recorded
by G. M. Gauthier; and Prof. Barnard, who photographed the comet on 30 nights from September 2 to October 13, states that the photo
graphs of September 30 "are unique, whilst the transformation which took place between the taking of these and the taking of the next one on October 1 was very wonderful." The spectrum

10* ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
showed the lines of cyanogen instead of the
hydrocarbon spectrum shown by most comets. Prof. Barnard has suggested that all the
phenomena of comets' tails cannot be explained
by a repulsive force from the sun. Short tails issuing from the comet's nucleus at considerable
angles with the main tail point to eruptive action
in the comet itself. The rapid changes and dis
tortions frequently observed in the tails of some
comets suggest motion through a resisting medium ; and the sudden increase of light also
occasionally observed points in the same direction. 1 It was computed by Olbers that if a comet having a mass of j^^h of the earth's mass which would form a globe of about 520 miles in diameter and of the density of granite collided with the
earth, with a velocity of 40 miles a second, our globe would be shattered into fragments.2 But that any comet has a solid nucleus of this size seems very doubtful; and we may further say that the collision of the earth with any comet is
highly improbable. It seems to be a common idea that harvests are affected by comets, and even " comet wines " are sometimes spoken of. But we know that the earth receives practically no heat from the
brightest comet. Even in the case of the brilliant
comet of 1811, one of the finest on record, it was
1 Nature, December 7, 1905. 2 Celestial Cycle, p. 259.



COMETS 105
found that " all the efforts to concentrate its
rays did not produce the slightest effect on the blackened bulb of the most sensitive thermometer."
Arago found that the year 1808, in which several comets were visible, was a cold year, "and 1831, in which there was no comet, enjoyed a much
higher temperature than 1819, when there were three comets, one of which was very brilliant." 1
We may, therefore, safely conclude that even a large comet has no effect whatever on the weather.
From calculations on the orbit of Halley's comet, the next return of which is due in 1910, Messrs. Cowell and Crommelin find that the identity of the comet shown on the Bayeux
Tapestry with Halley's comet is now " fully established." They find that the date of perihelion
passage was March 25, 1066, which differs by only 4 days from the date found by Hind. The imposing aspect of the comet in 1066 described in European chronicles of that time is confirmed by the Chinese Annals. In the latter records the
brightness is compared to that of Venus, and even with that of the moon ! The comparison
with the moon was probably an exaggeration, but the comet doubtless made a very brilliant show.
In the Bayeux Tapestry the inscription on the wall behind the spectators reads: "isti mirant
stella." Now, this is bad Latin, and Mr. W. T.
1 Celestial Cycle, p. 260.



106 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Lynn has made the interesting suggestion that some of the letters are hidden by the buildings in
front and that the real sentence is " isti mirantur stellam." 1 The present writer has examined the copy of the Bayeux Tapestry which is in the Dublin Museum, and thinks that Mr. Lynn's
suggestion seems very plausible. But the last letter of stellam is apparently hidden by the comet's tail, which does not seem very probable ! The conditions under which the comet will appear in 1910 are not unlike those of 1066 and 1145. " In each year the comet was discovered as
a morning star, then lost in the sun's rays ; on its emergence it was near the earth and moved
with great rapidity, finally becoming stationary in the neighbourhood of Hydra, where it was lost
to view." 2 In 1910 it will probably be an evening star before March 17, and after May 11, making a near approach to the earth about May 12. About this time its apparent motion in the sky will be
very rapid. As, however, periodical comets such as Halley's seem to become fainter at each
return, great expectations with reference to its appearance in 1910 should not be indulged in.
The appearance of Halley's comet in A.D. 1222 is thus described by Pingre a great authority on comets (quoting from an ancient writer)
" In autumn, that is to say in the months of
> Journal, B.A.A., April, 1907. 2 Monthly Notices, R.A.S., March, 1908.



COMETS 107
August andSeptember,'a star of the first magnitude
was seen, very red, and accompanied by a great tail
which extended towards the top of the sky in the
form of a cone extremely pointed. It appeared to
be very near the earth. It was observed (at
first ?) near the place of the setting sun in the
month of December."
With reference to its appearance in the year 1456, when it was of " vivid brightness," and had a tail of 60 in length, Admiral Smyth says,1 " To
its malign influence were imputed the rapid successes of Mahomet II., which then threatened all Christendom. The general alarm was greatly
aggravated by the conduct of Pope Callixtus III.,
who, though otherwise a man of abilities, was a poor astronomer; for that pontiff daily ordered the church bells to be rung at noon-tide, extra
Ave-Marias to be repeated, and a special protest and excommunication was composed, exorcising equally the Devil, the Turks, and the comet." With reference to this story, Mr. G. F. Chambers
points out 2 that it is probably based on a pas
sage in Platina's Vitce Pontificum. But in this passage there is no mention made of excommunication or exorcism, so that the story, which has
long been current, is probably mythical. In confirmation of this view, the Rev. W. F. Rigge has
shown conclusively 3 that no bull was ever issued
1 Celestial Cycle, p. 231. 2 Journal, B.A.A., July, 1908. 3 Popular Agronomy, October, 1908.



108 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
by Pope Callixtus III. containing a reference to any comet. The story would therefore seem to be
absolutely without foundation, and should be consigned to the limbo of all such baseless myths.
With reference to the appearance of Halley's comet, at his last return in 1835, Sir John Herschel, who observed it at the Cape of Good
Hope, says
"Among the innumerable stars of all magni
tudes, from the ninth downwards, which at
various times were seen through it, and some
extremely near to the nucleus (though not exactly
on it) there never appeared the least ground for
presuming any extinction of their light in traver
sing it. Very minute stars indeed, on entering
its brightest portions, were obliterated, as they
would have been by an equal illumination of the
field of view ; but stars which before their entry
appeared bright enough to bear that degree of
illumination, were in no case, so far as I could
judge, affected to a greater extent than they
would have been by so much lamp-light artificially
introduced." 1
It is computed by Prof. J. ^Holetschak that, early in October, 1909, Halley's comet should have the brightness of a star of about 14^ magnitude.3 It should then if not detected before be dis
coverable with some of the large telescopes now
available.
According to the computations of Messrs. Cowell and Crommelin, the comet should enter Pisces

from Aries in January, 1910. "Travelling westward towards the star y Piscium until the begin
ning of May, and then turning eastward again, it will travel back through the constellations Cetus,
Orion, Monoceres, Hydra, and Sextans." From this it seems that observers in the southern hemisphere will have a better view of the comet than those in northern latitudes. The computed
brightness varies from 1 on January 2, 1910, to 1112 on May 10. But the actual brightness of a comet does not always agree with theory. It is sometimes brighter than calculation would
indicate.
According to Prof. O. C. Wendell, Halley's comet will, on May 12, 1910, approach the earth's orbit within 4*6 millions of miles ; and he thinks that possibly the earth may " encounter some meteors," which are presumably connected with
the comet. He has computed the " radiant point " of these meteors (that is, the point from which
they appear to come), and finds its position to be
R.A. 22h 42m -9, Decl. N. 1 18'. This point lies a
little south-west of the star /3 Piscium.
According to Dr. Smart, the comet will, on June 2, " cross the Equator thirteen degrees south
of Regulus, and will then move slowly in the direction of </> Leonis. The comet will be at its
descending node on the ecliptic in the morning of May 16, and the earth will pass through the node on the comet's orbit about two and a half



110 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
days later. The comet's orbit at the node is about 13 million miles within that of the earth. Matter repelled from the comet's nucleus by the sun with a velocity of about 216,000 miles per hour, would just meet the earth when crossing the comet's orbit plane. Matter expelled with a
velocity of 80,000 miles per hour, as in the case of Comet Morehouse, would require seven days for the journey. Cometary matter is said to
have acquired greater velocities than this, for
(according to Webb, who quotes Chacornac) Comet II., 1862, shot luminous matter towards
the sun, with a velocity of nearly 2200 miles per second. It is therefore possible that matter thrown off by the comet at the node may enter our atmosphere, in which case we must hope that
cyanogen, which so often appears in cometary spectra, may not be inconveniently in evidence." 1 Cyanogen is, of course, a poisonous gas, but cometary matter is so rarefied that injurious effects on the earth need not be feared. If we can believe the accounts which have been handed down to us, some very wonderful comets
were visible in ancient times. The following may be mentioned : B.C. 165. The sun is said to have been "seen for several hours in the night." If this was a comet
it must have been one of extraordinary brilliancy.2

COMETS 111
B.C. 146. " After the death of Demetrius, king of Syria, the father of Demetrius and Antiochus,
a little before the war in Achaia, there appeared
a comet as large as the sun. Its disc was first
red, and like fire, -spreading sufficient light to
dissipate the darkness of night; after a little
while its size diminished, its brilliancy became
weakened, and at length it entirely disappeared." l B.C. 134. It is recorded that at the birth of Mithridates a great comet appeared which
"occupied the fourth part of the sky, and its
brilliancy was superior to that of the sun." (?) 2
B.C. 75. A comet is described as equal in size to the moon, and giving as much light as the sun
on a cloudy day. (!) 3 A.D. 531. In this year a great comet was observed in Europe and China. It is described
as " a very large and fearful comet," and was visible in the west for three weeks. Hind thinks
that this was an appearance of Halley's comet,4 and this has been confirmed by Mr. Crommelin.
A.D. 813, August 4. A comet is said to have
appeared on this date, of which the following curious description is given: "It resembled two
moons joined together ; they separated, and having taken different forms, at length appeared like a man without a head." (!)

A.D. 893. A great comet is said to have
appeared in this year with a tail 100 in length, which afterwards increased to 200 !
l
A.D. 1402. A comet appeared in February of
this year, which was visible in' daylight for eight
days. " On Palm Sunday, March 19, its size was prodigious." Another comet, visible in the daytime, was seen from June to September of the
same year.
When the orbit of the comet known as 1889 V
was computed, it was found that it had passed
through Jupiter's system in 1886 (July 18-21). The calculations show that it must have passed within a distance of 112,300 miles of the planet itself or less than half the moon's distance from the earth and " its centre may possibly have
grazed the surface of Jupiter." 2 Sir John Herschel thought that the great comet of 1861 was by far the brightest comet he had ever seen, those of 1811 and 1858 (Donati's) not
excepted.3 Prof. Kreutz found its period of revolution round the sun to be about 409 years, with
the plane of the orbit nearly at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic.
On November 9, 1795, Sir William Herschel saw the comet of that year pass centrally over

a small double star of the llth and 12th magnitudes, and the fainter of the two com
ponents remained distinctly visible during the comet's transit over the star. This comet' was an appearance of the comet now known as Encke's.1 Struve saw a star of the 10th magni
tude through nearly the brightest part of Encke's comet on November 7, 1828, but the star's light was not dimmed by the comet. Sir John Herschel saw a cluster of stars of
the 16th or 17th magnitude through Biela's
comet, although the interposed cometary matter must have been at least 50,000 miles in thickness. 2
Bessel found that on September 29, 1835, a star of the 10th magnitude shone with undimmed lustre through the tail of Halley's comet within 8 seconds of arc of the central point of the head.
At Dorpat (Russia) Struve saw the same star " in
conjunction only 2""2 from the brightest point of the comet. The star remained continuously
visible, and its light was not perceptibly diminished whilst the nucleus of the comet seemed to be almost extinguished before the radiance of the
small star of the 9th or 10th magnitude." 3
Webb says
" Donati saw a 7 mg. star enlarged so as to show
a sensible disc, when the nucleus of comet III.,

1860, passed very near it. Stars are said to
have started, or become tremulous, during occulta
tions by comets. Birmingham observed the comet
of Encke illuminated by a star over which it
passed, August 23, 1868; and Klein, in 1861,
remarked an exceptional twinkling in 5 mg. stars involved in the tail." l
The comet of 1729 had the greatest perihelion distance of any known comet ;
2 that is, when nearest to the sun, it did not approach the central luminary ;within four times the earth's distance from the sun I
Barnard's comet, 1889 I., although it never became visible to the naked eye, was visible with
a telescope from September 2, 1888, to August 18, 1890, or 715 days the longest period of visibility
of any comet on record. When last seen it was 65 times the earth's distance from the sun, or
about 580 millions of miles, 3 or beyond the orbit
of Jupiter !
Messier, who was called " the comet ferret," discovered " all his comets with a small 2-foot
telescope of 2J inches aperture, magnifying 5 times, and with a field of 4." 4 It is a very curious fact that Sir William
Herschel, " during all his star-gaugings and sweeps for nebulae, never discovered a comet ;
" 5 that is

COMETS 115
an object which was afterwards proved to be a
comet. Possibly, however, some of his nebulae which are now missing, may have been really comets. Sir William Herschel found the diameter of the head of the great comet of 1811 to be 127,000 miles. The surrounding envelope he estimated to be at least 643,000 miles, or about three-fourths of the sun's diameter.
On a drawing of the tails of the great comet
of 1744 given in a little book printed in Berlin in that year, no less than 12 tails are shown !
These vary in length and brightness. A copy of this drawing is given in Copernicus. 1 The observations were made by " einen geschichten
Frauenzimmer," who Dr. Dreyer identifies with Christian Kirch, or one of her two sisters, daughters of the famous Gottfried and Maria
Margaretta Kirch (Idem, p. 107). Dr. Dreyer
thinks that the drawing " seems to have been
carefully made, and not to be a mere rough sketch
as I had at first supposed " (Idem, p. 185). The tails of some comets were of immense length. That of the comet of 1769 had an absolute length of 38 millions of miles. That of 1680, 96
million of miles, or more than the sun's distance
from the earth. According to Sir William Herschel, the tail of the great comet of 1811 was over 100 millions of miles in length. That of the

116 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
great comet of 1843 one of the finest in history
is supposed to have reached a length of 150 millions of miles !
l
In width the tails of comets were in some cases
enormous. According to Sir William Herschel, the tail of the comet of 1811 had a diameter of
15 millions of miles I Its volume was, therefore, far greater than that of the sun !
l
According to Hevelius the comet of 1652 was of such a magnitude that it " resembled the moon when half full ; only it shone with a pale and
dismal light." 2
Halley's comet at its next appearance will be examined with the spectroscope for the first time
in its history. At its last return in 1835, the spectroscope had not been invented.
For the great comet of 1811, Arago computed a period of 3065 years ; and Eiicke found a period of 8800 years for the great comet of 1680.3
The variation in the orbital velocity of some comets is enormous. The velocity of the comet
of 1680 when passing round the sun (perihelion) was about 212 miles a second ! Whereas at its
greatest distance from the sun (aphelion) the velocity is reduced to about 10 feet a second !

CHAPTER XII
Meteors
MR.
DENNING thinks that the meteor shower of the month of May, known
as the Aquarids, is probably connected with Halley's comet. The meteors should be looked for after 1 a.m. during the first week in
May, and may possibly show an enhanced display in May, 1910, when Halley's comet will be near the sun and earth.1 On November 29, 1905, Sir David Gill observed
a fireball with an apparent diameter equal to that of the moon, which remained visible for 5
minutes and disappeared in a hazy sky. Observed from another place, Mr. Fuller found that the meteor was visible 2 hours later! Sir David Gill stated that he does not know of any similar
phenomenon. 2 Mr. Denning finds that swiftly moving meteors become visible at a greater height above the earth's surface than the slower ones. Thus, for the Leonids and Perseicls, which are both swift,
1 Nature, April 30, 1908. 2 Bulletin, AsL Soc. de France, Mny, 190G.



118 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
it has been found that the Leonids appear at an
average height of 84 miles, and disappear at a height of 56 miles ; and the Perseids at 80 and 54 miles respectively. " On the other hand, the mean height of the very slow meteors average about 65 miles at the beginning and 38 miles at the end
of their appearance." 2 During the night of July 21-22, 1896, Mr. William Brooks, the well-known, astronomer, and director of the Smith Observatory at Geneva
(New York), saw a round dark body pass slowly across the moon's bright disc, the moon being nearly full at the time. The apparent diameter of the object was about one minute of arc, and the duration of the transit 3 or 4 seconds, the direction of motion being from east to west. On August 22 of the same year, Mr Gathman (an American observer) saw a meteor crossing the sun's disc, the transit lasting about 8 seconds.2
A meteor which appeared in Italy on July 7, 1892, was shown by Prof, von Niessl to have had
an ascending path towards the latter end of its
course ! The length of its path was computed to
be 683 miles. When first seen, its height above the earth was about 42 miles, and when it disappeared its height had increased to about 98
miles, showing that its motion was directed
upwards ! 3

METEORS 119
In the case of the fall of meteoric stones, which occasionally occur, it has sometimes been noticed that the sound caused by the explosion of the
meteorite, or its passage through the air, is heard before the meteorite is seen to fall. This has
been explained by the fact that owing to the
resistance of the air to a body moving at first
with a high velocity its speed is so reduced that it strikes the earth with a velocity less than that of sound. Hence the sound reaches the earth before
the body strikes the ground. 1 The largest meteoric stone preserved in a museum is that known as the Anighita, which weighs 36^ tons, and was found at 'Cape York in Greenland. It was brought to the American Museum of Natural History by Commander R. E.
Peary, the Arctic explorer. The second largest known is that of Bacubirito in Mexico, the weight of which is estimated at
27J tons. The third largest is that known as the Willianiette, which was found in 1902 near the town of that name in Western Oregon (U.S.A.).
It is composed of metallic nickel-iron, and weighs about 13^ tons. It is now in the American Museum of Natural History.
A large meteorite was actually seen, from the deck of the steamer African Prince, to fall into the Atlantic Ocean, on October 7, 1906! The captain

120 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of the vessel, Captain Anderson, describes it as having a train of light resembling " an immense broad electric-coloured band, gradually turning
to orange, and then to the colour of molten metal. When the meteor came into the denser
atmosphere close to the earth, it appeared, as nearly as is possible to describe it, like a molten mass of metal being poured out. It entered the
water with a hissing noise close to the ship." l
This was a very curious and perhaps unique phenomenon, and it would seem that the vessel had a narrow escape from destruction. In Central Arizona (U.S.A.) there is a hill called Coon Butte, or Coon Mountain. This so-called " mountain " rises to a height of only 130 to 160
feet above the surrounding plain, and has on its top a crater of 530 to 560 feet deep ; the bottom
of the crater which is dry being thus 400 feet
below the level of the surrounding country. This
so-called " crater " is almost circular and nearly three-quarters of a mile in diameter. It has been
suggested that this " crater " was formed by the fall of an enormous iron meteorite, or small
asteroid. The " crater " has been carefully
examined by a geologist and a physicist. From the evidence and facts found, the geologist
(Mr. Barringer) states that " they do not leave, in my mind, a scintilla of doubt that this moun
tain and its crater were produced by the impact

METEORS 121
of a huge meteorite or small asteroid." The
physicist (Mr. Tilglmiann) says that he "is justified, under due reserve as to subsequently
developed facts, in announcing that the formation at this locality is due to the impact of a meteor of enormous and unprecedented size." There are numerous masses of meteoric iron in the vicinity
of the " crater." The so-called Canyon Diabolo meteorite was found in a canyon of that name about 2J miles from the Coon Mountain. The investigators estimate that the great meteoric fall took place " not more than 5000 years ago, perhaps much less." Cedar trees about 700 years old are now growing 011 the rim of the mountain.
From the results of artillery experiments, Mr.
Gilbert finds that " a spherical projectile striking solid limestone with a velocity of 1800 feet a
second will penetrate to a depth of something less than two diameters,' and from this Mr. L. Fletcher concludes "that a meteorite of large
size would not be prevented by the earth's
atmosphere from having a penetration effect sufficient for the production of such a crater." * The meteoric origin of this remarkable
" crater " is strongly favoured by Mr. G. P. Merrill, Head Curator of Geology, U.S. National Museum. The Canyon Diabolo meteorite above referred to was found to contain diamonds ! some black,
others transparent. So some have said that " the

diamond is a gift from Heaven," conveyed to earth in meteoric showers. 1 But diamondbearing meteorites would seem to be rather a freak of nature. It does not follow that all
diamonds had their origin in meteoric stones.
The mineral known as periodot is frequently found in meteoric stones, but it is also a constituent of
terrestrial rocks. In the year 1882 it was stated by Dr. Halm and Dr. Weinhand that they had found fossil sponges, corals, and crinoids in meteoric stones ! Dr. Weinhand thought he had actually determined three
genera !
2 But this startling result was flatly contradicted by Carl Vogt, who stated that the
supposed fossils are merely crystalline conformations.3
Some meteorites contain a large quantity of
occluded gases, hydrogen, helium, and carbon oxides. It is stated that Dr. Odling once " lighted
up the theatre of .the Royal Institution with
gas brought down from interstellar space by
meteorites "

On February 10, 1896, a large meteorite burst over Madrid with a loud report. The concussion was so great that many windows in the city were broken, and some partitions in houses were shaken down !

METEORS
A very brilliant meteor or fireball was seen in
daylight on June 9, 1900, at 2h 55ra p.m. from various places in Surrey, Sussex, and near London. Calculations showed that " the meteor began 59 miles in height over a point 10 miles east of Valognes, near Cherbourg, France. Meteor ended
23 miles in height, over Calais, France. Length of
path 175 miles. Radiant point, 280, 12." l It was decided some years ago " in the
American Supreme Court that a meteorite, though a stone fallen from heaven, belongs to the owner of the freehold interest in the land 011 which it
falls, and not to the tenant." 2 With reference to the fall of meteoric matter on the earth, Mr. Proctor says, " It is calculated by Dr. Kleiber of St. Petersburg!! that 4250 Ibs. of meteoric dust fall on the earth every hour that is, 59 tons a day, and more than 11,435 tons a
year. I believe this to be considerably short of
the truth. It sounds like a large annual growth, and the downfall of such an enormous mass of meteoric matter seems suggestive of some degree of danger. But in reality, Dr. Kleiber' s estimate
gives only about 25 millions of pounds annually, which is less than 2 ounces annually to each
square mile of the earth's surface," 3 a quantity
which is, of course, quite insignificant.

124 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
According to Humboldt, Chladiii states that a Franciscan monk was killed by the fall of an
aerolite at Milan in the year 1660. 1 Humboldt also mentions the death by meteoric stones of a monk at Crema on September 4, 1511, and two Swedish sailors on board ship in 1674.2
It is a curious fact that, according to Olbers, " no fossil meteoric stones " have ever been dis
covered.3 Considering the number which are supposed to have fallen to the earth in the course of ages, this fact seems a remarkable one. On May 10, 1879, a shower of meteorites fell at
Eitherville, Iowa (U.S.A.). Some of the fragments found weighed 437, 170, 92^, 28, 10J, 4 and 2 Ibs.
in weight. In the following year (1880) when the prairie grass had been consumed by a fire, about
" 5000 pieces were found from the size of a pin to
a pound in weight." 4 According to Prof. Silvestria of Catania, a shower of meteoric dust mixed with rain fell on the night of March 29, 1880. The dust contained
a large proportion of iron in the metallic state. In size the particles varied from a tenth to a hundredth of a millimetre.5 It is sometimes stated that the average mass of
a " shooting star " is only a few grains. But from

comparisons with an electric arc light, Prof. W.
II. Pickering concludes that a meteor as bright as
a third magnitude star, composed of iron or stone, would probably have a diameter of 6 or 7 inches.
An average bright fireball would perhaps measure 5 or 6 feet in diameter.1 In the Book of Joshua we are told "that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon
them unto Azekah, and they died " (Joshua x. 11).
In the latter portion of the verse " hailstones " are
mentioned, but as the original Hebrew word
means stones in general (not hailstones), it seems very probable that the stones referred to were
aerolites.2 The stone mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, from which was found " the image which fell
down from Jupiter " (Acts xix. 35), was evidently a meteoric stone.2 The famous stone in the Caaba at Mecca, is probably a stone of meteoric origin.3

CHAPTER XIII
The Zodiacal Light and Gegenschein
ACCORDING
to Gruson and Brugsch, the Zodiacal Light was known in ancient
times, and was even worshipped by the Egyptians. Strabo does not mention it; but Diodorus Siculus seems to refer to it (B.C. 373), and he probably obtained his information from
some Greek writers before his time, possibly from Zenophon, who lived in the sixth century B.C.1 Coming to the Christian era, it was noticed
by Nicephorus, about 410 B.C. In the Koran, it is
called the " false Aurora "
; and it is supposed to be
referred to in the " Rubaiyat " of Omar Khayyam, the Persian astronomical poet, in the second stanza
of that poem (Edward Fitzgerald's translation)
" Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky,2 I heard a voice within the Tavern cry, Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup, Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."
It was observed by Cassini in 1668,* and by

128 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Hooke in 1705. A short description of its appearance will be found in; Childrey's Britannia
Baconica (1661), p. 183.
The finest displays of this curious light seem to occur between the middle of January and the
middle of February. In February, 1856, Secchi found it brighter than he had ever seen it before. It was yellowish towards the axis of the cone, and it seemed to be brighter than the Milky Way
in Cygnus. He described it as " un graiide
spectacle." In the middle of February, 1866, Mr. Lassell, during his last residence in Malta, saw a remarkable display of the Zodiacal Light. He
found it at least twice as bright as the brightest part of the Milky Way, and much brighter than he had previously seen it. He found that the character of its light differed considerably from that of the Milky Way. It was of a much redder hue than the Galaxy. In 1874 very remarkable
displays were seen in the neighbourhood of London in January and February of that year ; and in 1875 on January 24, 25, and 30. On January 24 it was noticed that the "light" was
distinctly reddish and much excelled in brightness
any portion of the Milky Way. Humboldt, who observed it from Andes (at a
height of 13,000 to 15,000 feet), from Venezuela and from Cumana, tells us that he has seen the
Zodiacal Light equal in brightness to the Milky
Way in Sagittarius.



THE ZODIACAL LIGHT 129
As probably many people have never seen the
" light," a caution may be given to those who care to look for it. It is defined by the Rev.
George Jones, Chaplain to the " United States'
Japan Expedition" (1853-55), as "a brightness that appears in the western sky after sunset, and
in the east before sunrise ; following nearly or
quite the line of the ecliptic in the heavens, and stretching upwards to various elevations according to the season of the year." From the
description some might suppose that the light is visible immediately after sunset. But this is not
so ; it never appears until twilight is over and
" the night has fully set in."
The " light " is usually seen after sunset or
before sunrise. But attempts have recently been made by Prof. Simon Newcomb to observe it north of the sun. To avoid the effects of
twilight the sun must be only slightly more than 18 below the horizon (that is, a little
before or after the longest day). This condition limits the place of observation to latitudes not much south of 46; and to reduce atmospheric absorption the observing station should be as
high as possible above the level of the sea. Prof. Newcomb, observing from the Brienzer Rothorn in
Switzerland (latitude 46 47' N., longitude 8 3' E.), succeeded in tracing the "light" to a distance of 35 north of the sun. It would seem, therefore, that the Zodiacal Light envelops the sun on all K



130 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
sides, but has a greater extension in the direction of the ecliptic. 1 From observations at the Lick
Observatory, Mr. E. A. Fath found an extension of 46 north of the sun.2 From observations of the "light" made by Prof. Barnard at the Yerkes Observatory during the summer of 1906, he finds that it extends to at
least 65 north of the sun, a considerably higher value than that found by Prof. Newcomb.3 The
difference may perhaps be explained by actual variation of the meteoric matter producing the
light. Prof. J. H. Poynting thinks that possibly the Zodiacal Light is due to the "dust of long dead comets." 4
From careful observations of the "light," Mr.
Gavin J. Burns finds that its luminosity is " some
40 or 50 per cent, brighter than the background of the sky. Prof. Newcomb has made a precisely similar remark about the luminosity of the Milky
Way, viz. that it is surprisingly small." This agrees with my own observations during many years. It is only on the finest and clearest nights
that the Milky Way forms a conspicuous object
in the night sky. And this only in the country. The lights of a city almost entirely obliterate it. Mr. Burns finds that the Zodiacal Light

THE ZODIACAL LIGHT 131
appears " to be of a yellowish tint ; or if we call
it white, then the Milky Way is comparatively of a bluish tint." During my residence in the Punjab
the Zodiacal Light seemed to me constantly visible in the evening sky in the spring months. In the west of Ireland I have seen it nearly as
bright as the brightest portions of the Milky Way visible in this country (February 20, 1890). The
" meteoric theory " of the " light " seems to be
the one now generally accepted by astronomers, and in this opinion I fully concur. From observations made in Jamaica in the years 1899 and 1901, Mr. Maxwell Hall arrived at the conclusion that " the Zodiacal Light is caused by reflection of sunlight from masses of meteoric
matter still contained in the invariable plane, which may be considered the original plane of the solar system." l According to Humboldt, Cassini believed that the Zodiacal Light "consisted of
innumerably small planetary bodies revolving round the sun." 2 THE GEGENSCHEIN, or COUNTER-GLOW. This is a faint patch of light seen opposite the sun's place in the sky, that is on the meridian at mid
night. It is usually elliptical in shape, with its longer axis lying nearly in the plane of the ecliptic. It seems to have been first detected by Brorsen (the discoverer of the short-period comet
1 Nature, August 30, 1906. - Cosmos, vol. i. p. 131, footnote.



132 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of 1846) about the middle of the nineteenth
century. But it is not easy to see, for the famous Heis of Munster, who had very keen eyesight, did not succeed in seeing it for several years after Brorsen's announcement. 1 It was afterwards
independently discovered by Backhouse, and Barnard.
Prof. Barnard's earlier observations seemed to
show that the Gegenschein does not lie exactly
opposite to the sun, but very nearly so. He found its longitude is within one degree of 180, and its latitude about 1'3 north of the ecliptic. 2 But from subsequent observations he came to the conclusion that the differences in longitude and
apparent latitude are due to atmospheric absorption, and that the object really lies in the ecliptic
and exactly opposite to the sun.3 Barnard finds that the Gegenschein is not so
faint as is generally supposed. He says " it is best seen by averted vision, the face being turned
60 or 70 to the right or left, and the eyes alone turned towards it." It is invisible in June and

Searle of Harvard attributes it to a number of

asteroids too small to be seen individually. When in " opposition " to the sun these would be fully illuminated and nearest to the earth. Its distance from the earth probably exceeds that of the moon. Dr. Johnson Stoney thinks
that the Gegenschein may possibly be due to a "tail" of hydrogen and helium gases repelled
from the earth by solar action ; this " tail " being
visible to us by reflected sunlight.
It was observed under favourable circumstances
in January and February, 1903, by the French astronomer, M. F. Quenisset. He found that it was better seen when the atmosphere was less
clear, contrary to his experience of the Zodiacal Light. Prof. Barnard's experience confirms this.
M. Quenisset notes that as in the case of the Zodiacal Light the southern border of the
Gegenschein is sharper than the northern. He found that its brightness is less than that of the Milky Way between Betelgeuse and y Geminorum ;
and thinks that it is merely a strengthening of the Zodiacal Light. 1
A meteoritic theory of the Gegenschein has been advanced by Prof. F. R. Moulton, which
explains it by light reflected from a swarm of meteorites revolving round the sun at a distance of 930,240 miles outside the earth's orbit. Both the Zodiacal Light and Gegenschein were observed by Herr Leo Brenner on the evening of

March 4, 1896. He found the Zodiacal Light on
this evening to be "perhaps eight times brighter than the Milky Way in Perseus." The " Gegen
schein distinctly visible as a round, bright, cloudlike nebula below Leo (Virgo), and about twice the brightness of the Milky Way in Monoceros between Canis Major and Canis Minor." *
Humboldt thought that the fluctuations in the
brilliancy of the Zodiacal Light were probably due to a real variation in the intensity of the phenomenon rather than to the elevated position of the observer.2 He says that he was " astonished
in the tropical climates of South America, to observe the variable intensity of the light."

says that Hipparchus " ventured to count the stars, a work arduous even for
the Deity." But this was quite a mistaken idea. Those visible to the naked eye are
comparatively few in number, and the enumeration of those visible in an opera-glass which of course far exceed those which can be seen by un
aided vision is a matter of no great difficulty.
Those visible in a small telescope of 2| inches
aperture have all been observed and catalogued ; and even those shown on photographs taken with
large telescopes can be easily counted. The present writer has made an attempt in this direction, and taking an average of a large number of counts in various parts of the sky, as shown on stellar
photographs, he finds a total of about 64 millions for the whole sky in both hemispheres. 1 Probably the total number will not exceed 100
millions. But this is a comparatively small

136 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
number, even when compared with the human
population of our little globe. With reference to the charts made by photography in the International scheme commenced some years ago, it has now been estimated that the charts will probably contain a total of about
9,854,000 stars down to about the 14th magnitude
(13-7). The "catalogue plates" (taken with a
shorter exposure) will, it is expected, include about
2,676,500 stars down to 11J magnitude. These numbers may, however, be somewhat increased when the work has been completed. 1 If this estimate proves to be correct, the number of stars visible down to the 14th magnitude will be con
siderably less than former estimates have made it. Prof. E. C. Pickering estimates that the total
number of stars visible on photographs down to
the 16th magnitude (about the faintest visible
in the great Lick telescope) will be about 50
millions.2 In the present writer's enumeration, above referred to, many stars fainter than the
16th magnitude were included. Admiral Smyth says, with reference to Sir William Herschel perhaps the greatest observer that ever lived "As to Sir William himself, he
could unhesitatingly call every star down to the
6th magnitude, by its name, letter, or number." 3

This shows great powers of observation, and a wonderful memory.
On a photographic plate of the Pleiades taken with the Bruce telescope and an exposure of 6
hours, Prof. Bailey of Harvard has counted " 3972
stars within an area 2 square, having Alcyone at its centre." l This would give a total of about
41 millions for the whole sky, if of the same
richness.
With an exposure of 16 hours, Prof. H. C. Wilson finds on an area of less that 110' square a
total of 4621 stars. He thinks, " That all of these
stars belong to the Pleiades group is not at all
probable. The great majority of them probably lie at immense distances beyond the group, and
simply appear in it by projection." l He adds,
" It has been found, however, by very careful measurements made during the last 75 years
at the Konigsbergh and Yale Observatories,
that of the sixty-nine brighter stars, including those down to the 9th magnitude, only eight show any certain movement with reference to
Alcyone. Since Alcyone has a proper motion or drift of 6" per century, this means that all the
brightest stars except the eight mentioned are
drifting with Alycone and so form a true cluster, at approximately the same distance from the earth. Six of the eight stars which show relative
drift are moving in the opposite direction to the

138 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
movement of Alycone, and at nearly the same rate, so that their motion is only apparent. They
are really stationary, while Alycone and the rest of the cluster are moving past them." l This tends to show that the faint stars are really behind the cluster, and are unconnected with it.
It is a popular idea with some people that the Pole Star is the nearest of all the stars to
the celestial pole. But photographs show that there are many faint stars nearer to the pole than the Pole Star. The Pole Star is at present at a distance of 1 13' from the real pole of the
heavens, but it is slowly approaching it. The minimum distance will be reached in the year 2104. Prom photographs taken by M. Flammarion
at the Juvisy Observatory, he finds that there are at least 128 stars nearer to the pole than the Pole Star ! The nearest star to the pole was, in
the year 1902, a small star of about 12J magnitude, which was distant about 4 minutes of arc from the pole.2 The estimated magnitude shows
that the Pole Star is nearly 10,000 times brighter than this faint star !
It has been found that Sirius is bright enough to cast a shadow under favourable conditions.
On March 22, 1903, the distinguished French astronomer Touchet succeeded in photographing

the shadow of a brooch cast by this brilliant star.
The exposure was lh 5m. Martinus Hortensius seems to have been the
first to see stars in daylight, perhaps early in the seventeenth century. He mentions the fact in a letter to Gassendi dated October 12, 1636, but does not give the date of his observation. Schickard saw Arcturus in broad daylight early in 1632. Morin saw the same bright star half an
hour after sunset in March, 1635. Some interesting observations were made by Professors Payne and H. C. Wilson, in the
summer of 1904, at Midvale, Montana (U.S.A.), at a height of 4790 feet above sea-level. At this
height they found the air very clear and transparent. " Many more stars were visible at a glance, and the familiar stars appeared more
brilliant. ... In the great bright cloud of the
Milky Way, between /? and y Cygni, one could count easily sixteen or seventeen stars, besides the bright ones TJ and x> while at Northfield it is
difficult to distinctlyw see eight or nine with the naked eye." Some nebulae and star fields were
photographed with good results by the aid of a
2J-inch Darlot lens and 3 hours' exposure.2
Prof. Barnard has taken some good stellar photo
graphs with a lens of only 1J inches in diameter,

and 4 or 5 inches focus belonging to an ordinary
" magic lantern "
! He says that these " photographs with the small lens show us in the most striking manner how the most valuable and important information may be obtained with the
simplest means." l With reference to the rising and setting of the stars due to the earth's rotation on its axis, the
late Sir George B. Airy, Astronomer Royal of
England, once said to a schoolmaster, "I should like to know how far your pupils go into the first
practical points for which reading is scarcely necessary. Do they know that the stars rise and set? Very few people in England know it. I
once had a correspondence with a literary man of the highest rank on a point of Greek astronomy, and found that he did not know it !
"2
Admiral Smyth says, " I have been struck with the beautiful blue tint of the smallest stars visible
in my telescope. This, however, may be attributed to some optical peculiarity." This bluish colour of small stars agrees with the conclusion arrived
at by Prof. Pickering in recent years, that the
majority of faint stars in the Milky Way have
spectra of the Sirian type and, like that brilliant
star, are of a bluish white colour. Sir William Herschel saw many stars of a redder tinge than other observers have noticed. Admiral Smyth

THE STARS 141
says, "This may be owing to the effect of his
metallic mirror or to some peculiarity of vision, or
perhaps both." l The ancient astronomers do not mention any coloured stars except white and red. Among the
latter they only speak of Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pollux, Antares, and Betelgeuse as of a striking red colour. To these Al-Sufi adds Alphard
(a Hydrse). Sir William Herschel remarked that no decidedly green or blue star "has ever been noticed un
associated with a companion brighter than itself." An exception to Herschel's rule seems to be found in the case of the star ft Librae, which Admiral Smyth called " pale emerald." Mr. George Kiiott
observed it on May 19, 1852, as " beautiful pale
green " (3*7 inches achromatic, power 80), and on May 9, 1872, as "fine pale green" (5*5 inches achromatic, power 65). The motion of stars in the line of sight, as shown
by the spectroscope should theoretically alter their brightness in the course of time ; those ap
proaching the earth becoming gradually brighter, while those receding should become fainter. But the distance of the stars is so enormous that
even with very high velocities the change would not become perceptible for ages. Prof. Oudemans found that to change the brightness of a star by only one-tenth of a magnitude a quantity barely

perceptible to the eye a number of years would
be necessary, which is represented by the formula

for a star approaching the earth, and for a receding star
6195 years
pXm
This is in geographical miles, 1 geographical mile being equal to 4*61 English miles. Reducing the above to English miles, and taking an average for both approaching and receding stars, we have
27,660 years
pXm
where p = parallax in seconds '\ of arc, and
m = radial velocity in English miles per second. Prof. Oudemans found that the only star which
could have changed in brightness by one-tenth of
a magnitude since the time of Hipparchus is Aldebaran. This is taking its parallax as 0"*52.
But assuming the more reliable parallax 0"*12
found by Dr. Elkin, this period is 4J times longer.
For Procyon, the period would be 5500 years.1 The above calculation shows how absurd it is to
suppose that any star could have gained or lost in
brightness by motion in the line of sight during
historical times. The " secular variation " of stars
1 Nature, December 13, 1894.



THE STARS 143
is quite another thing. This is due to physical changes in the stars themselves. The famous astronomer Halley, the second
Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, says (Phil.
Trans., 1796), " Supposing the number of 1st magnitude stars to be 13, at twice the distance from the sun there may be placed four times as many, or 52 ; which with the same allowance would nearly represent the star we find to be of the 2nd magnitude. So 9 x 13, or 117, for those at three times the distance; and at ten times the
distance 100 X 13, or 1300 stars ; of which distance
may probably diminish the light of any of the stars of the 1st magnitude to that of the 6th,
it being but the hundredth part of what, at their
present distance, they appear with." This agrees
with the now generally accepted " light ratio " of 2'512 for each magnitude, which makes a first
magnitude star 100 times the light of a 6th
magnitude. On the 4th of March, 1796,1 the famous French astronomer Lalande observed on the meridian a star of small 6th magnitude, the exact position of which he determined. On the 15th of the same month he again observed the star, and the places found for 1800 refer to numbers 16292-3 of the
reduced catalogue. In the observation of March 4 he attached the curious remark, " Etoile singu
liere " (the observation of March 15 is without

144 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
note). This remark of Lalande has puzzled observers who failed to find any peculiarity about
the star. Indeed, " the remark is a strange one for the observer of so many thousands of stars to
attach unless there was really something singular in the star's aspect at the time." On the evening of April 18, 1887, the star was examined by the
present writer, and the following is the record in his observing book, " Lalande's etoile singuliere (16292-3) about half a magnitude less than rj Cancri. With the binocular I see two streams of small
stars branching out from it, north preceding like the tails of comet." This may perhaps have something to do with Lalande's curious remark. The star numbered 1647 in Baily's Flamsteed Catalogue is now known to have been an observation of the planet Uranus.1
Prof. Pickering states that the fainter stars
photographed with the 8-inch telescope at Cambridge (U.S.A.) are invisible to the eye in the
15-inch telescope.2 Sir Norman Lockyer finds that the lines of
sulphur are present in the spectrum of the bright
star Rigel (/? Orionis). 3 About 8J south of the bright star Regulus
(a Leonis) is a faint nebula (H I, 4 Sextaiitis). On or near this spot the Capuchin monk De Rheita fancied he saw, in the year 1643, a

group of stars representing the napkin of S. Veronica "sudarium Veronicas sive faciem Domini
maxima similitudina in astris expressum." And
he gave a picture of the napkin and star group. But all subsequent observers have failed to find
any trace of the star group referred to by De Rheita !
l
The Bible story of the star of the Magi is also told in connection with the birth of the sun-gods
Osiris, Horns, Mithra, Serapis, etc.2 The present writer has also heard it suggested that the
phenomenon may have been an apparition of Halley's comet! But as this famous comet is known to have appeared in the year B.C. 11, and as
the date of the Nativity was probably not earlier
than B.C. 5, the hypothesis seems for this (and
other reasons) to be inadmissible. It has also
been suggested that the phenomenon might have been an appearance of Tycho Brahe's temporary
star of 1572, known as the " Pilgrim star "
; but there seems to be no real foundation for such an hypothesis. There is no reason to think that
" temporary " or new stars ever appear a second time. Admiral Smyth has well said, " It checks one's pride to recollect that if our sun with the whole
system of planets, asteroids, and moons, and comets were to be removed from the spectator

146 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
to the distance of the nearest fixed star, not one of them would be visible, except the sun, which would then appear but as a star of perhaps the
2nd magnitude. Nay, more, were the whole system of which our globe forms an insignificant member, with its central luminary, suddenly annihilated, no effect would be produced on those unconnected and remote bodies; and the only annunciation of such a catastrophe in the Sidereal "Times" would be that a small star once seen in a distant quarter of the sky had ceased to shine." l
Prof. George C. Comstock finds that the average
parallax of 67 selected stars ranging in brightness between the 9th and the 12th magnitude, is of the value of 0"*0051.2 This gives a distance repre
senting a journey for light of about 639 years ! Mr. Henry Norris Russell thinks that nearly
all the bright stars in the constellation of Orion
are practically at the same distance from the earth. His reasons for this opinion are : (1) the
stars are similar in their spectra and proper
motions, (2) their proper motions are small, which
suggests a small parallax, and therefore a great distance from the earth. Mr. Russell thinks that
the average parallax of these stars may perhaps be 0"-005, which gives a distance of about 650
" light years." 3

THE STARS 147
According to Sir Norman Lockyer's classifica
tion of the stars, the order of increasing tempera
ture is represented by the following, beginning with those in the earliest stage of stellar evo
lution : Nebulae, Antares, Aldebaran, Polaris, a Cygni, Rigel, c Tauri, ft Crucis. Then we have
the hottest stars represented by e Puppis, y Argus, and Alnitam (c Orionis). Decreasing temperature is represented by (in order), Achernar, Algol, Markab, Sirius, Procyon, Arcturus, 19 Piscium, and the "Dark Stars." 1 But other astronomers
do not agree with this classification. Antares and Aldebaran are by some authorities considered
to be cooling suns. According to Ritter's views of the Constitution
of the Celestial Bodies, if we "divide the stars
into three classes according to age corresponding to these three stages of development, we shall
assign to the first class, A, those stars still in the nebular phase of development ; to the second
class, B, those in the transient stage of greatest
brilliancy ; and to the class C, those stars which have already entered into the long period of slow extinction. It should be noted in this classifica
tion that we refer to relative and not absolute
age, since a star of slight mass passes through the successive phases of its development more rapidly than the star of greater mass." 2 Ritter
1 Journal, B.A.A., June, 1899. Astrophysical Journal, vol. 8 (1898), p. 314.



148 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
conies to the conclusion that "the duration of the period in which the sun as a star had a
greater brightness than at present was very short in comparison with the period in which it had and will continue to have a brightness
differing only slightly from its present value." l In a valuable and interesting paper on "The Evolution of Solar Stars," 2 Prof. Schuster says that " measurements by E. P. Nichols on the heat of Vega and Arcturus indicated a lower
temperature for Arcturus, and confirms the conclusion arrived at on other grounds, that the
hydrogen stars have a higher temperature than the solar stars." "An inspection of the ultra
violet region of the spectrum gives the same result. These different lines of argument, all
leading to the same result, justify us in saying that the surface temperature of the hydrogen stars is higher than that of the solar stars. An extension of the same reasoning leads to the
belief that the helium stars have a temperature
which is higher still." Hence we have Schuster,
Hale, and Sir William Huggins in agreement that the Sirian stars are hotter than the solar stars ;
and personally I agree with these high authorities.
The late Dr. W. E. Wilson, however, held the opinion that the sun is hotter that Sirius ! Schuster thinks that Lane's law does not apply
1 AstropJtysical Journal, vol. 8, p. 213. 2 Ibid., vol. 17, January to June, 1902.



THE STARS 149
to the temperature of the photosphere and the absorbing layers of the sun and stars, but only to the portions between the photosphere and the
centre, which probably act like a perfect gas. On this view he says the interior might become "hotter and hotter until the condensation had reached a point at which the laws of gaseous condensation no longer hold."
With reference to the stars having spectra of
the 3rd and 4th type (usually orange and red
in colour), Schuster says
" The remaining types of spectra belong to lower temperature still, as in place of metallic lines, or
in addition to them, certain bands appear which
experiments show us invariably belong to lower
temperature than the lines of the same element.
" If an evolutionary process has been going on,
which is similar for all stars, there is little doubt
that from the bright-line stars down to the solar
stars the order has been (1) helium or Orion
stars, (2) hydrogen or Sirian stars, (3) calcium
or Procyon stars, (4) solar or Capellan stars."
My investigations on "The Secular Variation
of Starlight" (Studies in Astronomy, chap. 17, and Astronomical Essays, chap. 12) based on a
comparison of Al-Sufi's star magnitudes (tenth century) with modern estimates and measures, tend strongly to confirm the above views.
With regard to the 3rd-type stars, such as Betelgeuse and Mira Ceti, Schuster says, " It has been already mentioned that observers differ as



150 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
to whether their position is anterior to the
hydrogen or posterior to the solar stars, and there are valid arguments on both sides."
Scheiner, however, shows, from the behaviour of the lines of magnesium, that stars of type I.
(Sirian) are the hottest, and type III. the coolest, and he says, we have " for the first time a direct proof of the correctness of the physical inter
pretation of Vogel's spectral classes, according to which class II. is developed by cooling from I.,
and III. by a further process of cooling from II." l Prof. Hale says that " the resemblance between
the spectra of sun-spots and of 3rd-type stars is so close as to indicate that the same cause is
controlling the relative intensities of many lines
in both instances. This cause, as the laboratory
work indicates, is to be regarded as reduced
temperature." 2 According to Prof. Schuster, "a spectrum of bright lines may be given by a mass of luminous
gas, even if the gas is of great thickness. There
is, therefore, no difficulty in explaining the existence of stars giving bright lines." He thinks
that the difference between "bright line" stars
and those showing dark lines depends upon the rate of increase of the temperature from the
surface towards the centre. If this rate is slow,
bright lines will be seen. If the rate of increase
1 Astronomy and Astrophysics, 1894, pp. 5G9-70. 2 The Study of Stellar Evolution (1908), p. 171.



THE STARS 151
is rapid, the dark-line spectrum shown by the
majority of the stars will appear. This rate,
he thinks, is regulated by the gravitational force. So that in the early stages of condensation bright
lines are more likely to occur. " If the light is
not fully absorbed," both bright and dark lines of the same element may be visible in the same star. Schuster considers it quite possible that if we could remove the outer layers of the Sun's
atmosphere, we should obtain a spectrum of bright lines.1
M. Stratonoff finds that stars having spectra
of the Orion and Sirian types supposed to represent an early stage in stellar evolution tend to congregate in or near the Milky Way. Star
clusters in general show a similar tendency, " but to this law the globular clusters form an excep
tion." 2 We may add that the spiral nebulae which seem to be scattered indifferently over all
parts of the sky also seem to form an exception ; for the spectra of these wonderful objects seem
to show that they are really star clusters, in
which the components are probably relatively small; that is, small in comparison with our sun.
If we accept the hypothesis that suns and systems were evolved from nebulae, and if we consider the comparatively small number of
1 Astrophysical Journal, January, 1905. 2 Journal, B.A.A., June, 1901.



152 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
nebulae hitherto discovered in the largest tele
scopes about half a million ; and if we further consider the very small number of red stars, or those having spectra of the third and fourth
types usually considered to be dying-out suns we seem led to the conclusion that our sidereal system is now at about the zenith of its life
history; comparatively few [nebulae being left to consolidate into stars, and comparatively few stars having gone far on the road to the final extinction of their light.
Prof. Boss of Albany (U.S.A.) finds that about
forty stars of magnitudes from 3J to 7 in the
constellation Taurus are apparently drifting
together towards one point. These stars are included between about R.A. 3h 47 m to 5h 4m
, and
Declination -f- 5 to 4- 23 (that is, in the region sur
rounding the Hyades). These motions apparently converge to a point near R.A. 6h
, Declination -f- 7
(near Betelgeuse). Prof. Boss has computed the velocity of the stars in this group to be 45*6
kilometres (about 28 miles) a second towards the " vanishing point," and he estimated the
average parallax of the group to be 0"*025 about 130 years' journey for light. Although the motions are apparently converging to a point, it does not follow that the stars in question will, in the course
of ages, meet at the " vanishing point. " On the contrary, the observed motions show that the
stars are moving in parallel lines through space.



THE STARS 153
About 15 kilometres of the observed speed is due
to the sun's motion through space in the opposite
direction. Prof. Campbell finds from spectroscopic measures that of these forty stars, nine are
receding from the earth with velocities varying from 12 to 60 kilometres a second, and twentythree others with less velocities than 38 kilo
metres. 1 It will be obvious that, as there is a
" vanishing point," the motion in the line of sight must be one of recession from the earth. It has been found that on an average the parallax of a star is about one-seventh of its " proper motion." 2
Adopting Prof. Newcomb's parallax of 0"*14 for
the famous star 1830 Groombridge, the velocity
perpendicular to the line of sight is about 150 miles a second. The velocity in the line of sight
as shown by the spectroscope is 59 miles a
second approaching the earth. Compounding these two velocities we find a velocity through space of about 161 miles a second !

some bright stars, made by Dr. E. F. Nicholls in America with a very sensitive radiometer of his
own construction, he finds that "we do not receive from Arcturus more heat than we should from a candle at a distance of 5 or 6 miles."
With reference to the progressive motion of light, and the different times taken by light to reach the earth from different stars, Humboldt
says, " The aspect of the starry heavens presents to us objects of unequal date. Much has long ceased to exist before the knowledge of its presence reaches us ; much has been otherwise
arranged." 1 The photographic method of charting the stars, although a great improvement on the old system, seems to have its disadvantages. One of these is that the star images are liable to disappear from the plates in the course of time. The reduction
of stellar photograph plates should, therefore, be carried out as soon as possible after they are taken. The late Dr. Roberts found that on a
plate originally containing 364 stars, no less than 180 had completely disappeared in 9 years ! It has been assumed by some writers on
astronomy that the faint stars visible on photographs of the Pleiades are at practically the same distance from the earth as the brighter stars of the
cluster, and that consequently there must be an enormous difference in actual size between the
1 Cosmos, vol. iv. p. 567 (Otte's translation).



THE STARS 155
brighter and fainter stars. But there is really no
warrant for any such assumption. Photographs of the vicinity show that the sky all round the
Pleiades is equally rich in faint stars. It seems, therefore, more reasonable to suppose that most of the faint stars visible in the Pleiades are really
far behind the cluster in space. For if all the
faint stars visible on photographs belonged to the
cluster, then if we imagine the cluster removed,
a " hole " would be left in the sky, which is of course utterly improbable, and indeed absurd. An examination of the proper motions tends to confirm this view of the matter, and indicates that
the Pleiades cluster is a comparatively small one
and simply projected on a background of fainter
stars. It has long been suspected that the famous star 61 Cygni, which is a double star, forms a
binary system that is, that the two stars composing it revolve round their common centre of
gravity and move together through space. But measures of parallax made by Herman S. Davis and Wilsing seem to show a difference of parallax between the two components of about 0*08 of a
second of arc. This difference of parallax implies
a distance of about 2f " light years " between the
two stars, and "if this is correct, the stars are
too remote to form a binary system. The proper motions of 5"*21 and 5"*15 seem to show that they
are moving in nearly parallel directions ; but are



156 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
probably slowly separating. Mr. Lewis, however, thinks that a physical connection probably exists.1
Dante speaks of the four bright stars of the Southern Cross as emblematical of the four
cardinal virtues, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence ; and he seems to refer to the stars Canopus, Achernar, and Foomalhaut under the
symbols of Faith, Hope, and Charity. The so
called " False Cross " is said to be formed by the
stars K, 8, c, and t of the constellation Argo
Navis. But it seems to me that a better (although larger) cross is formed by the stars a Centauri and
a, /?, and y of Triangulum Australis. Mr. Monck has pointed out that the names of
the brightest stars seem to be arranged alphabetically in order of colour, beginning with red and ending with blue. Thus we have Aldebaraii,
Arcturus, Betelgeuse, Capella, Procyon, Regulus, Rigel, Sirius, Spica and Vega. But as the origin of these names is different, this must be merely a
curious coincidence.2 And, to my eye at least,
Betelgeuse is redder than Arcturus.

THE STARS 157
Observing at a height of 12,540 feet on the Andes, the late Dr. Copeland saw Sirius with the naked eye less than 10 minutes before sunset. 1 He
also saw Jupiter 3m 4.7s before sunset; and the
following bright stars Canopus, Om 523 before sunset ; Rigel (/3 Orionis) 16 m 32s after sunset ;
and Procyon llm 28s after sunset. From a height
of 12,050 feet at La Paz, Bolivia, he saw with the naked eye in February, 1883, ten stars in the Pleiades in full moonlight, and seventeen stars
in the Hyades. He also saw o- Tauri double.2 Humboldt says, "In whatever point the vault of heaven has been pierced by powerful and
far-penetrating telescopic instruments, stars or luminous nebulae are everywhere discoverable, the former in some cases not exceeding the 20th
or 24th degree of telescopic magnitude." 3 But this is a mistake. No star of even the 20th
magnitude has ever been seen by any telescope. Even on the best photographic plates it is doubtful that any stars much below the 18th magnitude
are visible. To show a star of the 20th magnitude
if such stars exist would require a telescope of 144 inches or 12 feet in aperture. To show a
star of the 24th magnitude if such there be an
aperture of 33 feet would be necessary 1

158 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
It is a popular idea that stars may be seen in the daytime from the bottom of a deep pit or high chimney. But this has often been denied.
Humboldt says, "While practically engaged in
mining operations, I was in the habit, during
many years, of passing a great portion of the day in mines where I could see the sky through deep shafts, yet I never was able to observe a star." 1
Stars may, however, be seen in the daytime with even small telescopes. It is said that a
telescope of 1 inch aperture will show stars of the 2nd magnitude; 2 inches, stars of the 3rd
magnitude ; and 4 inches, stars of the 4th magnitude. But I cannot confirm this from personal observation. It may be so, but I have not tried
the experiment. Sir George Darwin says
" Human life is too short to permit us to watch
the leisurely procedure of cosmical evolution, but
the celestial museum contains so many exhibits
that it may become possible, by the aid of
theory, to piece together, bit by bit, the processes
through which stars pass in the course of their
evolutions." 2
The so-called " telluric lines " seen in the solar
spectrum, are due to water vapour in the earth's atmosphere. As the light of the stars also
passes through the atmosphere, it is evident that these lines should also be visible in the spectra

of the stars. This is found to be the case by Prof. Campbell, Director of the Lick Observatory, who has observed all the principal bands in the spectrum of every star he has examined.1 The largest " proper motion " now known is that of a star of the 8J magnitude in the southern hemisphere, known as Cordoba Zone V. No. 243. Its proper motion is 8*07 seconds of arc per annum, thus exceeding that of the famous "runaway
star," 1830 Groombridge, which has a proper motion of 7'05 seconds per annum. This greater
motion is, however, only apparent. Measures of parallax show that the southern "runaway" is much nearer to us than its northern rival, its
parallax being 0"*32, while that of Groombridge 1830 is only 0"'14. With these data the actual
velocity across the line of sight can be easily computed. That of the southern star comes out 80 miles a second, while that of Groombridge 1830 is 148 miles a second. The actual velocity of
Arcturus is probably still greater. The poet Barton has well said
" The stars ! the stars ! go forth at night, Lift up thine eyea on high,
And view the countless orbs of light,
Which gem the midngiht sky.
Go forth in silence and alone,
This glorious sight to scan, And bid the humbled spirit own The littleness of man."

CHAPTER XV
Double and Binary Stars
PROF.
R. G. AITKEN, the eminent American observer of double stars, finds that of all
the stars down to the 9th magnitude
about the faintest visible in a powerful bino
cular field-glass 1 in 18, or 1 in 20, on the
average, are double, with the component stars less than 5 seconds of arc apart. This proportion of double stars is not, however, the same for all
parts of the sky; while in some regions double
stars are very scarce, in other places the proportion rises to 1 in 8. For the well-known binary star Castor (a Geminorum), several orbits have been computed with
periods ranging from 232 years (Madler) to 1001 years (Doberck). But Burnham finds that " the orbit is absolutely indeterminate at this time, and likely to remain so for another century
or longer." l Both components are spectroscopic binaries, and the system is a most interesting one. The well-known companion of Sirius became
1 Burnham's General Catalogue of Double Stars, p. 494.



DOUBLE AND BINARY STARS 161
invisible in all telescopes in the year 1890, owing
to its near approach to its brilliant primary. It
remained invisible until August 20, 1896, when it was again seen by Dr. See at the Lowell Obser
vatory.1 Since then its distance has been increasing, and it has been regularly measured. The maximum distance will be attained about the
year 1922.
The star ft Cephei has recently been discovered
to be a spectroscopic binary with the wonderfully short period of 4h 34m 11s
. The orbital
velocity is about 10J miles a second, and as this velocity is not very great, the distance between
the components must be very small, and possibly the two component bodies are revolving in actual
contact. The spectrum is of the " Orion type." 2
According to Slipher the spectroscopic binary y Geminorum has the comparatively long period
(for a spectroscopic binary) of about 3| years. This period is comparable with that of the
telescopic binary system, 8 Equulei (period about 5*7 years). The orbit is quite eccentric. I have shown elsewhere 3 that y Geminorum has probably increased in brightness since the time of Al-Sufi
(tenth century). Possibly its spectroscopic duplicity may have something to do with the variation
in its light.

162 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
With reference to the spectra of double stars, Mr. Maunder suggests that the fact of the com
panion of a binary star showing a Sirian spectrum while the brighter star has a solar spectrum may
be explained by supposing that, on the theory of
fission, " the smaller body when thrown off consisted of the lighter elements, the heavier
remaining in the principal star. In other words, in these cases spectral type depends upon original chemical constitution, and not upon the stage of stellar development attained." l
A curious paradox with reference to binary
stars has recently come to light. For many years it was almost taken for granted that the
brighter star of a pair had a larger mass than the fainter component. This was a natural
conclusion, as both stars are practically at the same distance from the earth. But it has been
recently found that in some binary stars the
fainter component has actually the larger mass ! Thus, in the binary star c Hydrae, the "magnitude " of the component stars are 3 and 6, indi
cating that the brighter star is about 16 times
brighter than the fainter component. Yet calculations by Lewis show that the fainter star has 6 times the mass of the brighter, that is, contains 6 times the quantity of matter ! In
the well-known binary 70 Ophiuchi, Prey finds that the fainter star has about 4 times the
1 Knowledge, June, 1891.



DOUBLE AND BINARY STARS 163
mass of the brighter^! In 85 Pegasi, the brighter star is about 40 times brighter than its companion, Avhile Furner finds that the mass of the fainter star is about 4 times that of the brighter ! And there are other similar cases. In fact, in these remarkable combinations of suns the
fainter star is really the "primary," and is, so
far as mass is concerned, " the predominant partner." This is a curious anomaly, and cannot be well explained in the present state of our
knowledge of stellar systems. In the case of
a Centauri the masses of the components are about equal, while the primary star is about 3 times
brighter than the other. But here the discrepancy
is satisfactorily explained by the difference in character of the spectra, the brighter component having a spectrum of the solar type, while the fainter seems further advanced on the downward road of evolution, that is, more consolidated and
having, perhaps, less intrinsic brightness of surface. In the case of Sirius and its faint attendant, the mass of the bright star is about twice the
mass of the satellite, while ; its light is about
40,000 times greater ! Here the satellite is either
a cooled-down sun or perhaps a gaseous nebula. There seems to be no other explanation of this
curious paradox. The same remark applies to
Procyon, where the bright star is about 100,000 times brighter than its faint companion, although its mass is only 5 times greater.



164 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
The bright star Capella forms a curious anomaly
or paradox. Spectroscopic observations show that it is a very close binary pair. It has been
seen "elongated" at the Greenwich Observatory with the great 28-inch refractor the work of Sir Howard Grubb and the spectroscopic and visual measurements agree in indicating that its mass is about 18 times the mass of the sun. But
its parallax (about 0"*08) shows that it is about 128 times brighter than the sun! This great
brilliancy is inconsistent with the star's computed
mass, which would indicate a much smaller brightness. The sun placed at the distance of
Capella would, I find, shine as a star of about 5J
magnitude, while Capella is one of the brightest stars in the sky. As the spectrum of Capella's
light closely resembles the solar spectrum, we seem justified in assuming that the two bodies
have pretty much the same physical composition. The discrepancy between the computed and actual brightness of the star cannot be
explained satisfactorily, and the star remains an astronomical enigma. Three remarkable " double-star systems have been discovered by. Dr. See in the southern
hemisphere. The first of these is the bright star
a Phcenicis, of which the magnitude is 2'4, or only very slightly fainter than the Pole Star. It is attended by a faint star of the 13th magnitude
at a distance of less than 10 seconds (1897). The



DOUBLE AND BINARY STARS 165
bright star is of a deep orange or reddish colour, and the great difference in brightness between
the component stars " renders the system both
striking and difficult." The second is /x Velorum, a star of the 3rd magnitude, which has a com
panion of the llth magnitude, and only 2f" from its bright primary (1897). Dr. See describes this
pair as "one of the most extraordinary in the
heavens." The third is rj Centauri, of 2 magitude,
with a companion of 13J magnitude at a distance of 5"'65 (1897) ; colours yellow and purple. This
pair is " extremely difficult, requiring a powerful telescope to see it." Dr. See thinks that these
three objects " may be regarded as amongst the most splendid in the heavens." The following notes are from Burnham's
recently published General Catalogue of Double Stars. #
The Pole Star has a well-known companion of about the 9th magnitude, which is a favourite object for small telescopes. Burnham finds that
the bright star and its faint companion are
"relatively fixed," and are probably only an "optical pair." Some other companions have been suspected by amateur observers, but Burn
ham finds that " there is nothing nearer " than the known companion within the reach of the great
36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory (Cat.,
p. 299). The well-known companion to the bright star



166 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Rigel (/3 Orionis) has been suspected for many years to be a close double star. Burnham con
cludes that it is really a binary star, and its
" period may be shorter than that of any known
pair" (Cat., p. 411). Burnham finds that the four brighter stars in the trapezium in the great Orion nebula (in the
" sword ") are relatively fixed (Cat., p. 426). y Leonis. This double star was for many years considered to be a binary, but Burnham has shown that all the measures may be satisfactorily
represented by a straight line, and that consequently the pair merely forms an " optical double."

which the orbit plane passes nearly through the earth. The period is about 25J years, and Burn
ham says the orbit "is as accurately known as that of any known binary." or CoronsB Borealis. Burnham says that the
orbits hitherto computed with periods ranging
from 195 years (Jacob) to 846 years (Doberck) are "mere guess work," and it will require the measures of at least another century, and perhaps
a much longer time, to give an approximate period (Cat., p. 209). So here is some work left for
posterity to do in this field. 70 Ophiuchi. With reference to this well
known binary star, Burnham says, " the elements
of the orbit are very accurately known." The



DOUBLE AND BINARY STARS 167
periods computed range from 86*66 years (Doolittle) to 98-15 years (Powell). The present writer found a period of 87'84 years, which cannot be far from the truth. Burnham found 87'75 years
(Cat., p. 774). In this case there is not much left
for posterity to accomplish. 61 Cygni. With reference to this famous star Burnham says, "So far the relative motion
is practically rectilinear. If the companion is moving in a curved path, it will require the measures of at least another half-century to make this certain. The deviation of the
measured positions during the last 70 years from
a right line are less than the average errors of
the observations."
Burnham once saw a faint companion to Sirius
of the 16th magnitude, and measured its position with reference to the bright star (280'6 : 40"-25 : 1899-86). But he afterwards found that
it was "not a real object but a reflection from
Sirius " (in the eye-piece). Such false images are
called " ghosts." With reference to the well-known double (or rather quadruple) star e Lyrae, near Vega, and
supposed faint stars near it, Burnham says, " From time to time various small stars in the vicinity have been mapped, and much time wasted
in looking for and speculating about objects which only exist in the imagination of the observer." He believes that many of these faint



168 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
stars, supposed to have been seen by various
observers, are merely "ghosts produced by
reflection.'*
The binary star Bootis, which has long been
suspected of small and irregular variation of light, showed remarkable spectral changes in the year 1905,1 somewhat similar to those of a nova, or
temporary star. It is curious that such changes should occur in a star having an ordinary Sirian
type of spectrum !
A curious quadruple system has been discovered by Mr. R. T. A. Innes in the southern hemisphere. The star K Toucani is a binary star with com
ponents of magnitudes 5 and 7*7, and a period of revolution of perhaps about 1000 years. Within
6' of this pair is another star (Lacaille 353), which
is also a binary, with a period of perhaps 72 years. Both pairs have the same proper motion
through space, and evidently form a vast quadruple system ; for which Mr. Innes finds a possible
period of 300,000 years. 2 It is a curious fact that the performance of a
really good refracting telescope actually exceeds what theory would indicate ! at least so far as
double stars are concerned. For example, the famous double-star observer Dawes found that the distance between the components of a double

star which can just be divided, is found by
dividing 4"'56 by the aperture of the object-glass in inches. Now theory gives 5"*52 divided by
the aperture. " The actual telescope if a really good one thus exceeds its theoretical requirements. The difference between theory and
practice in this case seems to be due to the fact
that in the * spurious ' star disc shown by good telescopes, the illumination at the edges of the
star disc is very feeble, so that its full size is not
seen except in the case of a very bright star '

that interesting work A Cycle of Celestial
Objects, Admiral Smyth says (p. 275), "Geminiaiio Moiitanari, as far back as 1670, was so struck with the celestial changes, that he
projected a work to be intituled the Instabilities
of the Firmament, hoping to show such alterations
as would be sufficient to make even Aristotle
were he alive reverse his opinion on the incor
ruptibility of the spangled sky: * There are now wanting in the heavens,' said he, * two stars of the 2nd magnitude in the stem and yard of the ship Argo. I and others observed them in the year 1664, upon occasion of the comet that
appeared in that year. When they first dis
appeared I know not ; only I am sure that on
April 10, 1668, there was not the least glimpse of
them to be seen.' " Smyth adds, " Startling as this account is and I am even disposed to question the fact it must be recollected that Montanari was a man of integrity, and well
versed in the theory and practice of astronomy ;



VARIABLE STARS 171
and his account of the wonder will be found in
good set Latin in page 2202 of the Philosophical Transactions for 1671." There must be, I think as Smyth suggests some mistake in Montanari's observations, for it is quite certain that of the stars mentioned by
Ptolemy (second century A.D.) there is no star of the 2nd magnitude now missing. It is true that Al-Sufi (tenth century) mentions a star of the
third magnitude mentioned by Ptolemy in the
constellation of the Centaur (about 2 east of
the star e Centauri) which he could not find. But this has nothing to do with Montanari's stars.. Montanari's words are very clear. He says, " Desunt in Ccelo duce stellce Secundse Magnitudinis

Sir William Herschel thought that " of all stars
which are singly visible, about one in thirty are
undergoing an observable change." 1 Now taking the number of stars visible to the naked eye at 6000, this would give about 200 variable stars
1 Smyth's Celestial Cycle, p. 223.



172 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
visible at maximum to the unaided vision. But this estimate seems too high. Taking all the
stars visible in the largest telescopes possibly about 100 millions the proportion of variable
stars will probably be much smaller still. The theory that the variation of light in the
variable stars of the Algol type is due to a
partial eclipse by a companion star (not necessarily a dark body) is now well established
by the spectroscope, and is accepted by all astronomers. The late Miss Clarke has well said
" to argue this point would be enforcer une porte ouverte.
According to Dr. A. W. Roberts, the components
of the following " Algol variables " " revolve in
contact "
: V Puppis, X Carinse, /3 Lyrae, and
v Pegasi. Of those V Puppis and /3 Lyrae are known spectroscopic binaries. The others are
beyond the reach of the spectroscope, owing to their faintness.
A very curious variable star of the Algol type
is that known as R R Draconis. Its normal magnitude is 10, but at minimum it becomes
invisible in a 7J-inch refracting telescope. The variation must, therefore, be over 3 magnitudes, that is, at minimum its light must be reduced to about one-sixteenth of its normal brightness. The period of variation from maximum to minimum is about 2*83 days. The variation of
light near minimum is extraordinarily rapid, the



VARIABLE STARS 173
light decreasing by about 1 magnitude in half an hour. 1 A very remarkable variable star has been
recently discovered in the constellation Auriga.
Prof. Hartwig found it of the 9th magnitude on March 6, 1908, the star " having increased four
magnitudes in one day, whilst within eight days it was less than the 14th magnitude." 2 In other words its light increased at least one-hundred
fold in eight days ! The period of the well-known variable star
/3 Lyrse seems to be slowly increasing. This Dr. Roberts (of South Africa) considers to be due
to the component stars slowly receding from each other. He finds that " a very slight increase of one-thousandth part of the radius of the orbit
would account for the augmentation in time,
30m in a century." According to the theory of stellar evolution the lengthening of the period
of revolution of a binary star would be due to
the " drag " caused by the tides formed by each
component on the other.3 M. Sebastian Albrecht finds that in the short
period variable star known as T Vulpeculse (and
other variables of this class, such as Y Ophiuchi),
there can be no eclipse to explain the variation of light (as in the case of Algol). The star is a
spectroscopic binary, it is true, but the maximum

174 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of light coincides with the greatest velocity of approach in the line of sight, and the minimum
with the greatest velocity of recession. Thus the
light curve and the spectroscopic velocity curve are very similar in shape, but one is like the other turned upside down. "That is, the two curves
have a very close correspondence in phase in addition to correspondence of shape and period."
The star now known as W TJrsae Majoris (the variability of which was discovered by Mtiller and Kempf in 1902), 'and which lies between the
stars and v of that constellation, has the
marvellously short period of 4 hours (from maximum to maximum). Messrs. Jordan and
Parkhurst (U.S.A.), find from photographic plates that the star varies from 7 '24 to 8*17 magnitude." The light at maximum is, therefore, more than
double the light at minimum. A sun which loses more than half .its light and recovers it again in
the short period of 4 hours is certainly a curious and wonderful object. In contrast with the above, the same astronomers have discovered a star in Perseus which seems to vary from about the 6th to the 7th
magnitude in the very long period of 7^ years !
It is now known as X Persei, and its position for 1900 is R.A. 3h 49m 8s
, Dec. N. 30 46', or
about one degree south-east of the star Persei.

VARIABLE STARS 175
It seems to be a variable of the Algol type, as the star remained constant in light at about the
6th magnitude from 1887 to 1891. It then began to fade, and on December 1, 1897, it was reduced to about the 7th magnitude.
On the night of August 20, 1886, Prof. Colbert, of Chicago, noticed that the star Cassiopeiae
increased in brightness " by quite half a magnitude, and about half an hour afterwards began to return to its normal magnitude." x This curious
outburst of light in a star usually constant in
brightness is (if true) a very unusual phenomenon. But a somewhat similar fluctuation of light is recorded by the famous German astronomer Heis.
On September 26, 1850, he noted that the star
" Lyrse became, for a moment, very bright, and then again faint." (The words in his original
observing book are : " Lyrse wurde einen Moment sehr hell und hierauf wieder dunkel.") As Heis was a remarkably accurate observer of star brightness, the above remark deserves the highest confidence.2
The variable star known as the V Delphini was
found to be invisible in the great 40-inch telescope
of the Yerkes Observatory on July 20, 1900. Its
magnitude was, therefore, below the 17th. At its
maximum brightness it is about 7J, or easily visible in an ordinary opera-glass, so that its

176 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
range of variation is nearly, or quite, ten magnitudes. That is, its light at maximum is about 10,000 times its light at minimum. That a sun should vary in light to this enormous extent is
certainly a wonderful fact. A variable discovered by Ceraski (and numbered 7579 in Chandlers'
Catalogue) "had passed below the limit of the
40-inch in June, 1900, and was, therefore, not brighter than 17 mag." l The late Sir C. E. Peck and his assistant, Mr. Grover, made many valuable observations of
variable stars at the Rousden Observatory during
many years past. Among other interesting things noted, Peck sometimes saw faint stars in the field of view of his telescope which were at other times
invisible for many months, and he suggested that these are faint variable stars with a range of
brightness from the 13th to the 20th magnitude. He adds, " Here there is a practically unemployed
field for the largest telescopes." Considering the enormous number of faint stars visible on stellar
photographs the number of undiscovered variable
stars must be very large. Admiral Smyth describes a small star near
|8 Leonis, about 5' distant, of about 8th magnitude, and dull red. In 1864 Mr. Knott measured a faint
star close to Smyth's position, but estimated it only 11-6 magnitude. The Admiral's star would thereupon seem to be variable.2

VARIABLE STARS 177
The famous variable star rj Argus, which Sir John Herschel, when at the Cape of Good Hope in 1838, saw involved in dense nebulosity, was in April, 1869, "seen on the bare sky," with the
great Melbourne telescope, "the nebula having disappeared for some distance round it." Other changes were noticed in this remarkable nebula. The Melbourne observers saw "three times as
many stars as were seen by Herschel." But of
course their telescope is much larger 48 inches
aperture, compared with Herschel's 20 inches. Prof. E. C. Pickering thinks that the fluctuations
of light of the well-known variable star R Coronse (in the Northern Crown), " are unlike those of
any known variable." This very curious object one of the most curious in the heavens sometimes remains for many months almost constant
in brightness (just visible to the naked eye), and
then rapidly fades in light by several magnitudes ! Thus its changes of light in April and May, 1905, were as follows :
1905, April 1 6'0 magnitude 11 7-3 12 8-4 Mayl 11-4 7 12-5
Thus between April 1 and May 1, its light was reduced by over 5 magnitudes. In other words, the light of the star on May 1 was reduced to less
than one-hundredth of its light on April 1. If our N



178 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
sun were to behave in this way nearly all life would soon be destroyed on the face of the earth.
M. H. E. Lau finds that the short-period variable star 8 Cephei varies slightly in colour as well as in light, and that the colour curve is parallel to the light curve. Near the minimum of light the colour is reddish yellow, almost as red
as Cephei ; a day later it is pure yellow, and of about the same colour as the neighbouring
e Cephei.1 But it would not be easy to fully establish such slight variations of tint.
A remarkably bright maximum of the famous variable Mira Ceti occurred in 1906. In December
of that year it was fully 2nd magnitude. The present writer estimated it 1*8, or nearly equal to the brightest on record 1'7 observed by Sir William Herschel and Wargentinin the year 1779.
From photographs of the spectrum taken by Mr. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory in 1907, he finds strong indications of the presence of the rather
rare element vanadium in the star's surroundings.
Prof. Campbell finds with the Mills spectrograph attached to the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick
Observatory that Mira is receding from the earth at the apparently constant velocity of about 38 miles a second.2 This, of course, has nothing to do with the variation in the star's light. Prof.
Campbell failed to see any trace of the green line

other lines of the hydrogen series " glowed with
singular intensity." Mr. Newall has found evidence of the element
titanium in the spectrum of Betelgeuse (a Orionis) ; Mr. Goatcher and Mr. Lunt (of the Cape
Observatory) find tin in Antares (and Scorpii). If the latter observation is confirmed it will be the first time this metal has been found in a star's
atmosphere. 1 It is a curious fact that Al-Sufi (tenth century) does not mention the star Aquilse, which lies
closely north-west of Aquilse, as it is now quite
conspicuous to the naked eye. It was suspected of variation by Sir William Herschel. It was first recorded by Tycho Brahe about 1590, and he
called it 3rd magnitude. Bayer also rated it 3, and since his time it has been variously estimated
from 3 to 4. If it was anything like its present
brightness (4'21 Harvard) in the tenth century it seems difficult to explain how it could have escaped
Al-Sufi's careful scrutiny of the heavens, unless it is variable. Its colour seems reddish to me. Mr. W. T. Lynn has shown and I think con
clusively that the so-called " new star " of A.n.
389 (which is said to have appeared near Altair in
the Eagle) was really a eomet.2 Near the place of Tycho Brahe's great new star

of 1572 (the " Pilgrim Star "), Hind and W. E. Plummer observed a small star (No. 129 of d'Arrest's catalogue of the region) which seemed to
show small fluctuations of light, which " scarcely include a whole magnitude." This may possibly be identical with Tycho Brahe's wonderful star, and should be watched by observers. The place
of this small star is (for 1865) R.A. Oh 17 m 18s
,
N.P.D. 26 37'*1. The region was examined by Prof. Burnham in 1890 with the 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory. " None of the faint
stars near the place presented any peculiarity worthy of remark, but three double stars were found." l With reference to the famous Nova (T) Coronse
the " Blaze Star " of 1866 Prof. Barnard finds
from careful comparisons with small stars in its
vicinity that " the Nova is now essentially of the same brightness it was before the outburst of
1866 . . . there seems to be no indication of motion in the Nova" With reference to the cause of "temporary" stars, or novce, as they are now called by astro
nomers the late Prof. H. C. Vogel said
" A direct collision of two celestial bodies is not
regarded by Huggins as an admissible explanation
of the Nova ; a partial collision has little proba
bility, and the most that can be admitted is perhaps
the mutual penetration and admixture of the outer

gaseous envelopes of the two bodies at the time of
their closest approach. A more probable explana
tion is given by an hypothesis which we owe to
Klinkerfues, and which has more recently been further developed by Wilsing, viz. that by the very
close passage of two celestial bodies enormous tidal
disturbances are produced and thereby changes in
the brightness of the bodies. In the case of the
two bodies which form the Nova, it must be
assumed that these phenomena are displayed in
the highest degree of development, and that
changes of pressure have been produced which
have caused enormous eruptions from the heated
interior of the bodies ; the eruptions are perhaps
accompanied by electrical actions, and are com
parable with the outbursts in our own sun,
although they are on a much larger scale." l
It will be noticed that this hypothesis agrees with the fundamental assumption of the " Planet
esimal Hypothesis " advocated by Professors Chamberlin and Moulton (see my Astronomical
Essays, p. 324). The rush of a comparatively small body through a mass of gaseous matter seems also a very
plausible hypothesis. This idea was originally advanced by Prof. Seeliger, and independently by Mr. Monck. With reference to the nebula which was observed round the great new star of 1901 Nova
Persei Prof. Lewis Bell supports the theory of Seeliger, which accounts for the apparent movements of the brightest portions of the nebula by

182 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
supposing that the various parts of the highly tenuous matter were successively lighted up by the effects of a travelling electro-magnetic wavefront, and he shows that this theory agrees well with the observed phenomenon. 1 The " collision
theory " which explained the sudden outburst of
light by the meeting of two dark bodies in space, seems to be now abandoned by the best astro
nomers. The rapid cooling down of the supposed bodies indicated by the rapid decrease of light is
quite inconsistent with this hypothesis. The rapid diminution in the light of some of
these " new stars " is very remarkable. Thus the new star which suddenly blazed out near the nucleus of the great nebula in Andromeda in August, 1885, faded down in 5 months from " the limit of visibility to the naked eye to that of a
26-inch telescope "
! A large body could not cool
in this way.
Mr. Harold K. Palmer thinks that the " complete
and astonishingly rapid changes of spectral type observed in the case of Nova Cygni and Nova Aurigce, and likewise those observed in Nova
Normce, Nova Sagittarii and Nova Persei, leave little doubt that the masses of these objects are
small." 2 No less than 3748 variable stars had been discovered up to May, 1907. Of these 2909 were

VARIABLE STARS 183
found at Harvard Observatory (U.S.A.) chiefly by means of photography.1 The star 14. 1904 Cygni has a period of only 3 hours 14 minutes, which is the shortest period known for a variable star.
A very interesting discovery has recently been made with reference to the star p Herculis. It has
been long suspected of variable light with a period of 35 or 40 days, or perhaps irregular. Frost and Adams now find it to, be a spectroscopic binary, and further observations at Harvard Observatory show that it is a variable of the Algol (or perhaps
ft Lyrae) type. The Algol variation of light was suggested by MM. Baker and Schlesinger. The period seems to be about 2*05 days.2
The northern of the two " pointers " in the
Plough (so called because they nearly point to the Pole Star) is about the 2nd magnitude, as AlSufi rated it. It was thought to be variable in
colour by Klein, Konkoly, and Weber ; and M.
Lau has recently found a period of 50 days
with a maximum of "jaune rougeatre " on April 2> 1902.
The famous variable star 17 Argus did "not
exceed the 8th magnitude" in February, 1907, according to Mr. Tebbutt.3 This is the faintest ever recorded for this wonderful star.

184 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
It is stated in Knowledge (vol. 5, p. 3, January 4, 1884) that the temporary star of 1876 (in the constellation of Cygnus) " had long been
known and catalogued as a telescopic star of the 9th magnitude with nothing to distinguish it from the common herd." But this is quite erroneous.
The star was quite unknown before it was discovered by Schmidt at Athens on November 24
of that year. The remark apparently refers to
the " Blaze Star " of 1866 in Corona Borealis, which
was known previously as a star of about the 9th magnitude before its sudden outburst on May 12 of that year.
This "new star" of 1866 T Coronse, as it is
now called was, with the possible exception of Nova Persei (1901), the only example of a nova which was known to astronomers as a small star
previous to the great outburst of light. It is the
brightest of the novce still visible. It was the
first of these interesting objects to be examined with the spectroscope. It was observed by Burnham in the years 1904-1906 with the great
40-inch telescope of the Yerkes Observatory
(U.S.A.). He found its colour white, or only slightly tinged with yellow. In August and September, 1906, he estimated its magnitude at
about 9*3, and " it would seem therefore that the
Nova is now essentially of the same brightness it was before the outburst in 1866." It shows no indication of motion. Burnham found no



VARIABLE STARS 185
peculiarity about its telescopic image. A small and very faint nebula was found by Burnham a
little following (that is east of) the nova.1
The following details of the great new star of 1572 the "Pilgrim Star" of Tycho Brahe are
given by Delambre.2 In November, 1572, it was
brighter than Sirius, Vega, and Jupiter, and almost equal to Venus at its brightest. During December it resembled Jupiter in brightness. In
January, 1573, [it was fainter and only a little brighter than stars of the 1st magnitude. In
February and March it was equal to 1st magnitude stars,"and in April and May was reduced to the 2nd magnitude. In June and July it was
3rd magnitude; in September of the 4th, and at the end of 1573 it was reduced to the 5th magni
tude. In February, 1574, it was 6th magnitude, and in March of the same year it became invisible to the naked eye. From this account it will be seen that the decrease in light of this curious object was much slower than that of Nova Persei (1901) (" the new
star of the new century"). This would suggest
that it was a much larger body. There were also changes in its colour. When
it was of the brightness of Venus or Jupiter it shone with a white light. It then became golden, and afterwards reddish like Mars, Aldebaran, or
1 Astropliysical Journal, May, 1907. 2 Histoire de V Astronomic Moderne, vol. i. pp. 1S5-G.



186 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Betelgeuse. It afterwards became of a livid white
colour like Saturn, and this it retained as long as
it was visible. Tycho Brahe thought that its apparent diameter might have been about 3^ minutes of arc, and that it was possibly 361 times smaller than the earth (!) But we now know that these estimates were probably quite erroneous.
Temporary stars were called by the ancient
Chinese " Ke-sing," or guest stars.1
A temporary star recorded by Ma-tuan-lin
(Chinese Annals) in February, 1578, is described as
" a star as large as the sun." But its position is
not given.3 About the middle of September, 1878, Mr. Greely, of Boston (U.S.A.), reported to Mr. E. P. Sawyer (the eminent'observer of variable stars) that, about the middle of August of that year, he had seen the famous variable star Mira Ceti of about the 2nd
magnitude, although the star did not attain its usual maximum until early in October, 1878. Mr. Greely stated that several 'nights after he first saw Mira it had faded to the 4th or 5th magnitude. If there was no mistake in this observation (and
Sawyer could find none) it was quite an unique phenomenon, as nothing of the sort has been observed before or since in the history of this famous star. It looks as if Mr. Greely had
observed a new or " temporary " star near the

VARIABLE STARS 187
place of Mira Ceti; but as the spot is far from the Milky Way, which is the usual seat of such
phenomena, this hypothesis seems improbable. In the so-called Cepheid and Geminid variables
of short period, the principal characteristics of the light variation are as follows :
" 1. The light varies without pause.
" 2. The amount of their light variation is
usually about 1 magnitude.
" 3. Their periods are short a few days only.
" 4. They are of a spectral type approximately
solar ; no Orion, Sirian or Arcturian stars having
been found among them.
" 5. They seem to be found in greater numbers
in certain parts of the sky, notably in the Milky
Way, but exhibit 110 tendency to form clusters.
" 6. All those stars whose radial velocities have been studied have been found to be binaries whose period of orbital revolution coincides with that of their light change.
" 7. The orbits, so far as determined, are all
small, a sin i being 2,000,000 kilometres or less.
"8. Their maximum light synchronizes with
their maximum velocity of approach, and mini
mum light with maximum velocity of recession.
" 9. No case has been found in which the spectrum of more than one component has been
bright enough to be recorded in the spectrograms." l
It is very difficult to find an hypothesis which
will explain satisfactorily all these characteristics, and attempts in this direction have not proved very successful. Mr. J. C. Duncan suggests the

188 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
action of an absorbing atmosphere surrounding the component stars. On March 30, 1612, Schemer saw a star near
Jupiter. It was at first equal in brightness to Jupiter's satellites. It gradually faded, and on April 8 of the same year it was only seen with
much difficulty in a very clear sky. " After that
date it was never seen again, although carefully looked for under favourable conditions."
An attempted identification of Schemer's star was made in recent years by Winnecke. He found
that its position, as indicated by Schemer, agrees with that of the Bonn Durchmusterung star 15, 2083 (8J magnitude). This star is not a known variable. Winnecke watched it for 17 years, but found 110 variation of light. From Schemer's recorded observations his star seems to have
reached the 6th magnitude, which is considerably brighter than the Durchmusterung star watched by Winnecke.1 With reference to the colours of the stars, the
supposed change of colour in Sirius from red to white is well known, and will be considered in the
chapter on the Constellations. The bright star Arcturus has also been suspected of variation in colour. About the middle of the nineteenth century
Dr. Julius Schmidt, of Athens, the well-known observer of variable stars, thought it one of the
reddest stars in the sky, especially in the year

1841, when he found its colour comparable with that of the planet Mars.1 In 1852, however, he was surprised to find it yellow and devoid of any reddish tinge ; in colour it was lighter than that of Capella. In 1863, Mr. Jacob Ennis found it
"decidedly orange." Ptolemy and Al-Sufi called it red.
Mr. Ennis speaks of Capella as " blue " (classing it with Rigel), and comparing its colour with that
of Vega !
2 But the present writer has never seen
it of this colour. To his eye it seems yellowish or
orange. It was called red by Ptolemy, El Pergani, and Riccioli ; but Al-Sufi says nothing about its
colour.
Of /3 Ursae Minoris, Heis, the eminent German astronomer said, "I have had frequent opportunities of convincing myself that the colour of
this star is not always equally red ; at times it is
more or less yellow, at others most decidedly
red." 3 Among double stars there are many cases in which variation of colour has been suspected. In some of these the difference in the recorded colour
may possibly be due to " colour blindness " in some of the observers ; but in others there seems to be
good evidence in favour of a change. The following may be mentioned :

pale lilac.
On October 13, 1907, Nova Persei, the great new star of 1901, was estimated to be only 11*44
magnitude, or about 11|. When at its brightest this famous star was about zero magnitude ; so that it has in about 6 years faded about 11{T
magnitudes in brightness ; in other words, it has
been reduced to ^--3 of its greatest brilliancy !



CHAPTER XVII
Nebulae and Clusters
IN
his interesting and valuable work on "The
Stars," the late Prof. Newcomb said
"Great numbers of the nebulae are therefore thousands of times the dimensions of the earth's orbit, and most of them are thousands
of times the dimensions of the whole solar
system. That they should be completely trans
parent through such enormous dimensions shows
their extreme tenuity. Were our solar system
placed in the midst of one of them] it is probable
that we should not be able to find any evidence
of its existence "
!
Prof. Perrine thinks that the total number of
the nebulas will ultimately be found to exceed a
million. 1 Dr. Max Wolf has discovered a number of small
nebulae in the regions near Algol and Nova Persei
(the great "new star" of 1901). He says, "They
mostly lie in two bands," and are especially numerous where the two bands meet, a region
of 12 minutes of arc square containing no less
than 148 of them. They are usually " round with

central condensation," and form of Andromeda nebula. 1 Some small nebulae have been found in the
vicinity of the globular clusters. They are described by Prof. Perrine as very small and like
an " out of focus " image of a small star. " They appear to be most numerous about clusters which are farthest from the galaxy." Prof. Perrine
says, " Practically all the small nebulae about the
globular clusters are elliptical or circular. Those
large enough to show structure are spirals. Doubt
less the majority of these are spirals." 2 This seems further evidence in favour of the "spiral nebular hypothesis" of Chamberlin and Moulton.
A great photographic nebula in Orion was discovered by Prof. Barnard in 1894. In a draw
ing he gives of the nebula,3 it forms a long streak
beginning a little south of y Orionis (Bellatrix), passing through the star 38 Orionis north of 51 and south of 56 and 60 Orionis. Then turning south it sweeps round a little north of K Orionis ; then over 29 Orionis, and ends a little to the west
of rj Orionis. There is an outside patch west of Rigel. Barnard thinks that the whole forms a
vast spiral structure; probably connected with
the " great nebula " in the " sword of Orion," which it surrounds.

NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 193
From calculations of the brightness of surface
(" intrinsic brightness ") of several " planetary " nebulae made by the present writer in the year
1905, he finds that the luminosity is very small compared with that of the moon. The brightest of those examined (h 3365, in the southern hemisphere, near the Southern Cross) has a surface
luminosity of only ~ of that of the moon.1 The great nebulae in Orion and Andromeda seem to
have " still smaller intrinsic brightness."
Arago says
"The spaces which precede or which follow
simple nebulae, and a fortiori groups of nebulae,
contain generally few stars. Herschel found this
rule to be invariable. Thus every time that,
during a short interval, no star appeared, in
virtue of the diurnal motion, to place itself in the
field of his motionless telescope, he was accustomed
to say to the secretary who assisted him (Miss
Caroline Herschel), ' Prepare to write ; nebulae are
about to arrive.' " 2
Commenting on this remark of Arago, the late
Herbert Spencer says
" How does this fact consist with the hypothesis
that nebulae are remote galaxies ? If there were
but one nebula, it would be a curious coincidence
were this one nebula so placed in the distant
regions of space as to agree in direction with a
starless spot in our sidereal system ! If there
were but two nebulae, and both were so placed,
the coincidence would be excessively strange.

What shall we say on finding that they are
habitually so placed ? (the last five words replace
some that are possibly a little too strong). . . .
When to the fact that the general mass of nebulae
are antithetical in position to the general mass of
the stars, we add the fact that local regions of
nebulae are regions where stars are scarce, and
the further fact that single nebulae are habitually
found in comparatively starless spots, does not
the proof of a physical connection become over
whelming?" 1
With reference to the small elongated nebula discovered by Miss Caroline Herschel in 1783 near the great nebula in Andromeda, Admiral Smyth says, "It lies between two sets of stars, consist
ing of four each, and each disposed like the
figure 7, the preceding group being the smallest." 2
Speaking of the " nebula " Messier 3 a globular cluster in Canes Venatici Admiral Smyth says,
" This mass is one of those balls of compact and
wedged stars whose laws of aggregation it is so
impossible to assign ; but the rotundity of the figure gives full indication of some general attractive bond of union." 3 The terms " compact and
wedged" are, however, too strong, for we know that in the globular clusters the component stars must be separated from each other by millions of miles !
Prof. Chamberlin suggests that the secondary
nebula (as it is called) in the great spiral in Canes

3 Ibid., p. 307.



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 195
Venaticij' (Messier ] 51) may possibly represent the body which collided with the other (the
chief nucleus) in a grazing collision, and is now escaping. He considers this secondary body to
have been " a dead sun " that is,' a dark body.1
This would be very interesting if it could be proved. But it seems to me more probable that
the secondary nucleus is simply a larger portion of the ejected matter, which is now being gradually detached from the parent mass.
Scheiner says "the previous suspicion that the spiral nebulae are star clusters is now raised
to a certainty," and that the spectrum of the Andromeda nebula is very similar to that of the
sun. He says there is "a surprising agreement of the two, even in respect to the relative intensity
of the separate spectral regions." 2 In the dynamical theory of spiral nebulae, Dr. E. J. Wilczynski thinks that the age of a spiral nebula may be indicated by the number of its
coils ; those having the largest number of coils being the oldest, from the point of view of evolution.3 This seems to be very probable.
In the spectrum of the gaseous nebula?, the F line of hydrogen (H/3) is visible, but not the C line (Ha). The invisibility of the C line is ex
plained by Scheiner as due to a physiological

196 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
cause, " the eye being less sensitive to that part of
the spectrum in which the line appears than to
the part containing the F line." l An apparent paradox is found in the case of the gaseous nebulae. The undefined outlines of these
objects render any attempt at measuring their
parallax very difficult, if not impossible. Their distance from the earth is therefore unknown,
and perhaps likely to remain so for many years to come. It is possible that they may not be farther from us than some of the stars visible
in their vicinity. On the other hand, they may lie far beyond them in space. But whatever
their distance from the earth may be, it may be easily shown that their attraction on the sun
is directly proportioned to their distance that
is, the greater their distance, the greater the attraction! This is evidently a paradox, and rather a startling one too. But it is nevertheless
mathematically true, and can be easily proved. For, their distance being unknown, they may be of any dimensions. They might be comparatively small bodies relatively near the earth, or they may be immense masses at a vast distance from
us. The latter is, of course, the more probable.
In either case the apparent size would be the same. Take the case of any round gaseous
nebula. Assuming it to be of a globular form, its real diameter will depend on its distance from
1 Ast. Nach., No. 3476.'



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 197
the earth the greater the distance, the greater the diameter. Now, as the volumes of spheres
vary as the cubes of their diameters, it follows that the volume of the nebula will vary as the cube of its distance from the earth. As the mass
of an attracting body depends on its volume and density, its real mass will depend on the cube of
its distance, the density (although unknown) being a fixed quantity. If at a certain distance its mass is m, at double the distance (the apparent diameter being the same) it would have a mass
of eight times m (8 being the cube of 2), and at treble the distance its mass would be 27 m, and
so on, its apparent size being known, but not its real size. This is obvious. Now, the attractive
power of a body varies directly as its mass
the greater the mass, the greater the attraction. Again, the attraction varies inversely as the
square of the distance, according to the wellknown law of Newton. Hence if d be the un
known distance of the nebula, we have its attractive power varying as d3 divided by d\
or directly as the distance d. We have then the
curious paradox that for a nebula whose distance from the earth is unknown, its attractive power
on the sun (or earth) will vary directly as the distance the greater the distance the greater the
attraction, and, of course, conversely, the smaller the distance the less the attractive power. This
result seems at first sight absurd and incredible,



198 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
but a little consideration will show that it is quite
correct. Consider a small wisp of cloud in our
atmosphere. Its mass is almost infinitesimal and its attractive power on the earth practically nil.
But a gaseous nebula having the same apparent size would have an enormous volume, and,
although probably formed of very tenuous gas, its mass would be very great, and its attractive
power considerable. The large apparent size of the Orion nebula shows that its volume is probably enormous, and as its attraction on the sun is not
appreciable, its density must be excessively small, less than the density of the air remaining in the receiver of the best air-pump after the air has
been exhausted. How such a tenuous gas can shine as it does forms another paradox. Its
light is possibly due to some phosphorescent or electrical action.
The apparent size of "the great nebula in
Andromeda " shows that it must be an object of vast dimensions. The nearest star to the earth,
Alpha Centauri, although probably equal to our sun in volume, certainly does not exceed onehundredth of a second in diameter as seen from the earth. But in the case of the Andromeda
nebula we have an object of considerable apparent size, not measured by seconds of arc, but showing an area about three times greater than that of the full moon. The nebula certainly lies in the region of the stars much farther off than



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 199
Alpha Centauri and its great apparent size shows
that it must be of stupendous dimensions. A moment's consideration will show that whatever its distance may be, the farther it is from the
earth the larger it must be in actual size. The
sun is vastly larger than the moon, but its
apparent size is about the same owing to its greater distance. Sir William Herschel thought the Andromeda nebula to be "undoubtedly the nearest of all the great nebulae," and he estimated its distance at 2000 times the distance of Sirius.
This would not, however, indicate a relatively
near object, as it would imply a " light journey " of over 17,000 years! (The distance of Sirius is
about 88 " light years.") It has been generally supposed that this great nebula lies at a vast distance from the earth, possibly far beyond most of the stars seen in the
same region of the sky; but perhaps not quite so far as HerscheFs estimate would imply. Recently, however, Prof. Bohlin of Stockholm has found from three series of measures made in
recent years a parallax of O"'!?. 1 This indicates a distance of 1,213,330 times the sun's distance from the earth, and a "light journey" of about 19 years. This would make the distance of the nebula more than twice the
distance of Sirius, about four times the distance
of a Centauri, but less than that of Capella.
1 AstronomiscJie Nachrichten, No. 4213.



200 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Prof. Bohlin's result is rather unexpected, and
will require confirmation before it can be accepted.
But it will be interesting to inquire what this parallax implies as to the real dimensions and probable mass of this vast nebula. The extreme length of the nebula may be taken to represent
its diameter considered as circular. For, although
a circle seen obliquely is always foreshortened
into an ellipse, still the longer axis of the ellipse
will always represent the real diameter of the
circle. This may be seen by holding a penny at various angles to the eye. Now, Dr. Roberts found that the apparent length of the Andromeda nebula is 2| degrees, or 84:00 seconds of arc. The diameter in seconds divided by the parallax will give the real diameter of the nebula in terms of the sun's distance from the earth taken as unity. Now,
8400 divided by 0"'17 gives nearly 50,000, that is, the real diameter of the Andromeda nebula would
be on Bohlin's parallax nearly 50,000 times the sun's distance from the earth. As light takes about 500 seconds to come from the sun to the
earth, the above figures imply that light would take about 290 days, or over 9 months to cross the
diameter of this vast nebula.
Elementary geometrical considerations will show that if the Andromeda nebula lies at a greater distance from the earth than that indicated by
Bohlin's parallax, its real diameter, and therefore
its volume and mass, will be greater. If, therefore,



NEBULAE AND CLUSTERS 201
we assume the parallax found by Bolilin, we shall probably find a minimum value for the size and mass of this marvellous object.
Among Dr. Roberts' photographs of spiral nebulae (and the Andromeda nebula is undoubtedly a spiral) there are some which are
apparently seen nearly edgeways, and show that these nebulae are very thin in proportion to their
diameter. From a consideration of these photo
graphs we may, I think, assume a thickness of about one-hundredth of the diameter. This would give a thickness for the Andromeda nebulae of about 500 times the sun's distance from the earth. This great thickness will give some idea of the
vast proportions of the object we are dealing with. The size of the whole solar system large
as it is is small in comparison. The diameter and thickness found above can easily be converted into miles, and from these dimensions the actual volume of the nebula can be compared with that
of the sun. It is merely a question of simple mensuration, and no problem of " high mathe
matics " is involved. Making the necessary calculations, I find that the volume of the Andromeda nebula would be about 2*32 trillion times
(2*32 x 1018
) the sun's volume ! Now, assuming that the nebulous matter fills only one-half of the
apparent volume of the nebula (allowing for
spaces between the spiral branches), we have the
volume = 1'16 x 1018
. If the nebula had the same



202 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
density as the sun, this would be its mass in terms
of the sun's mass taken as unity, a mass probably
exceeding the combined mass of all the stars visible
in the largest telescopes ! But this assumption is, of course, inadmissible, as the sun is evidently
quite opaque, whereas the nebula is, partially at
least, more or less transparent. Let us suppose that the nebula has a mean density equal to that of atmospheric air. As water is about 773 times
heavier than air, and the sun's density is 1*4
(water = 1) we have the mass of the nebula equal to 1-16 X 1018 divided by 773 x|l'4, or about 1015
times the sun's mass, which is still much greater than the probable combined mass of all the visible stars. As it seems unreasonable to suppose that the mass of an individual member of our sidereal system should exceed the combined mass of the remainder of the system, we seem compelled to further reduce the density of the Andromeda nebula. Let us assume a mean density of, say, a
millionth of hydrogen gas (a sufficiently low estimate) which is about 14*44 times lighter than air, and we obtain a mass of about 8 x 107 or 80 million times the mass of the sun, which is still an enormous mass. As possibly 1 may have assumed too great a thickness for the nebula, let us take a thickness of one-tenth of that used above, or one thousandth of the length of the nebula. This gives a mass of 8 million times the sun's mass. This seems



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 203
a more probable mass if the nebula is as
Bohlin's parallax implies a member of our sidereal
system. If we assume a parallax of say 0"'01 or onehundredth of a second of arc which would still keep the nebula within the bounds of our sidereal system we have the dimensions of the nebula increased 17 times, and hence its mass nearly 5000
times greater (173
) than that found above. The mass would then be 40,000 million times the sun's
mass ! This result seems highly improbable, for
even this small parallax would imply a light
journey of only 326 years, .whereas the distance of the Milky Way has been estimated by Prof.
Newcomb at about 3000 years' journey for light. In Dr. Roberts' photograph many small stars are seen scattered over the surface of the nebula ; but these do not seem to be quite so numerous as
in the surrounding sky. If the nebula lies nearer to us than the fainter stars visible 011 the photograph, some of them may be obscured by the denser portions of the nebula ; some may be visible
through the openings between the spiral branches ; while others may be nearer to us and simply pro
jected on the nebula.
To add to the difficulty of solving this celestial
problem, the spectroscope shows that, the Andromeda nebula is not gaseous. The spectrum is, according to Schemer, very similar to that of the sun, and " there is a surprising agreement of



204 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
the two, even in respect to the relative intensities
of the separate spectral regions." 1 He thinks that " the greater part of the stars comprising the nucleus of the nebula belong to the second
spectral class" (solar), and that the nebula "is
now in an advanced stage of development. No trace of bright nebular lines are present, so that
the interstellar space in the Andromeda nebula,
just as in our stellar system, is not appreciably
occupied by gaseous matter." l He suggests that the inner part of the nebula [the " nucleus "]
" corresponds to the complex of those stars which do not belong to the Milky Way, while the latter corresponds to the spirals of the Andromeda nebula." l On this view of the matter we may
suppose that the component particles are small bodies widely separated, and in this way the mean density of the Andromeda nebula may be very small indeed. They cannot be large bodies, as
he largest telescopes have failed to resolve the
nebula into stars, and photographs show no sign of resolution. It has often been suggested, and sometimes definitely stated, that the Andromeda nebula may
possibly be an " external " universe, that is an universe entirely outside our sidereal system, and comparable with /it in size. Let us examine the
probability of such hypothesis. Assuming that the nebula has the same diameter as the Milky
1 Attropliyncal Journal, vol. 9, p. 149.



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 205
Way, or about 6000 "light years," as estimated by Prof. Newcomb, I find that its distance from
the earth would be about 150,000 "light years." As this is about 8000 times the distance indicated by Bohlin's parallax, its dimensions would be 8000 times as great, and hence its volume and mass
would be 8000 cubed, or 512,000,000,000 times greater than that found above. That is, about 4
trillion (4 x 1018
) times the sun's mass ! As this
appears an incredibly large mass to be compressed into a volume even so large as that of our sidereal
system, we seem compelled to reject the hypothesis that the nebula represents an external universe. The sun placed at the distance corresponding to
1 50,000 light years would, I find, shine as a star of less than the 23rd magnitude, a magnitude which
would be invisible in the largest telescope that man could ever construct. But the combined
light of 4 trillion of stars of even the 23rd magnitude would be equal to one of minus 23*5 magni
tude, that is, 23J magnitude brighter than the zero magnitude, or not very much inferior to the sun in brightness. As the Andromeda nebula shines only as a star of about the 5th magnitude
the hypothesis of an external universe seems to be untenable.
It is evident, however, that the mass of the Andromeda nebula must be enormous ; and if it
belongs to our sidereal system, and if the other
great nebulee have similar masses, it seems quite



206 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
possible that the mass of the visible universe may
much exceed that of the visible stars, and may be
equal to 1000 million times the sun's mass as supposed by the late Lord Kelvin or even much more.
With reference to the small star which suddenly blazed out near the nucleus of the Andro
meda nebula in August, 1885, Prof. Seeliger has investigated the decrease in the light of the star
on the hypothesis that it was a cooling body which had suddenly been raised to an intense heat by the shock of a collision, and finds a fair agreement between theory and observation. Prof. Auwers points out the similarity between this outburst and that of the "temporary star"
of 1860, which appeared in the cluster 80 Messier, and he thinks it very probable that both phenomena were due to physical changes in the nebulae in which they appeared.
The appearance of this temporary star in the Andromeda nebula seems to afford further evi
dence against the hypothesis of the nebula being an external universe. For, as I have shown above,
our sun, if placed at a distance of 150,000 light years, would shine only as a star of the 23rd
magnitude, or over 15 magnitudes fainter than the temporary star. This would imply that the star shone with a brightness of over a million times that of the sun, and would therefore
indicate a body of enormous size. But the rapid



NEBULAE AND CLUSTERS 207
fading of its light would, 011 the contrary, imply
a body of comparatively small dimensions. We
must, therefore, conclude that the nebula, whatever it may be, is not an external universe, but forms a member of our own sidereal system,
In Sir John Herschel's catalogue of Nebulae and
Clusters of Stars, published in 1833, in the Philo
sophical Transactions of the Royal Society, there are many curious objects mentioned. Of these I
have selected the following : No. 496 is described as " a superb cluster which
fills the whole field ; stars 9, 10 . . . 13 magnitude and none below, but the whole ground of the sky on which it stands is singularly dotted over with
infinitely minute points." This is No. 22 of Sir William Herschel's 6th class, and will be found about 3 degrees south and a little east of the triple star 29 Monocerotis.
No. 650. This object lies about 3 degrees north of the star ft Leonis, the most northern of the
bright stars in the well-known " Sickle," and is
thus described by Sir John Herschel : " A star 12th magnitude with an extremely faint nebulous atmosphere about 10" to 12". It is between a star
8-9 magnitude north preceding, and one 10th magnitude south following, neither of which are
so affected. A curious object."
No. 1558. Messier 53. A little north-east of
the star a Comae Berenices. Described as "a
most beautiful highly compressed cluster. Stars



208 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
very small, 12th . . . 20tli magnitude, with scat
tered stars to a considerable distance ; irregularly round, but not globular. Comes up to a blaze in the centre ; indicating a round mass of pretty
equable density. Extremely compressed. A most
beautiful object. A mass of close-wedged stars 5' in diameter ; a few 12th magnitude, the rest of the smallest size and innumerable." Webb says, " Not very bright with S~ inches ; beautiful with
9 inches." This should be a magnificent object
with a very large telescope, like the Lick or Yerkes. No. 2018. "A more than usually condensed portion of the enormous cluster of the Milky Way. The field has 200 or 300 stars in it at once." This lies about 2 south-west of the star 6 Aquilse, which is near the northern edge of
the bright spot of Milky Way light in "Sobi
eski's Shield " one of the brightest spots in the
sky.
No. 2093. " A most wonderful phenomenon. A
very large space 20' or 30' broad in Polar Distance,
and lm or 2m in Right Ascension, full of nebula and stars mixed. The nebula is decidedly attached
to the stars, and is as decidedly not stellar. It forms irregular lace-work marked out by stars,
but some parts are decidedly nebulous, wherein no star can be seen." Sir John Herschel gives a
figure of this curious spot, which he says represents its " general character, but not the minute

details of this object, which would be extremely
difficult to give with any degree of fidelity." It lies about 3 degrees west of the bright star
Cygni. Among the numerous curious objects observed by Sir John Herschel during his visit to the Cape of Good Hope, the following may be mentioned : h 2534 (H iv. 77). Near r4 Eridani. Sir John
Herschel says, "Attached cometically to a 9th magnitude star which forms its head. It is an exact resemblance to Halley's comet as seen in a
night glass." ... "A complete telescopic comet; a perfect miniature of Halley's comet, only the
tail is rather broader in proportion." 1 h 3075. Between y Monocerotis and y Canis
Majoris. " A very singular nebula, and much like
the profile of a bust (head, neck, and shoulders) or a silhouette portrait, very large, pretty well defined, light nearly uniform, about 12' diameter. In a crowded field of Milky Way stars, many of

h 3315 (Dunlop 323). In the Milky Way; about 3 east of the Eta Argus nebula. Sir John
Herschel says, "A glorious cluster of immense
magnitude, being at least 2 fields in extent every

elegant double stars, and many orange-coloured stars." l This should form a fine object in even
a comparatively small telescope, and may be recommended to observers in the southern hemi
sphere. A telescope of 3-inches aperture should show it well.
Among astronomical curiosities may be counted
" clusters within clusters." A cluster in Gemini
(N.G.C. 2331) has a small group of " six or seven stars close together and well isolated from the
rest."
Lord Rosse describes No. 4511 of Sir John
Herschel's General Catalogue of Nebulae and
Clusters (Phil. Trans., 1864) as " a most gorgeous cluster, stars 12-15 magnitude, full of holes." 2
His sketch of this cluster shows 3 rings of stars
in a line, each ring touching the next on the outside. Sir John Herschel described it as " Cluster ;
very large; very rich; stars 11-15 magnitude (Harding, 1827)," but says nothing about the rings. This cluster lies about 5 degrees south of 8 Cygni.
Dr. See, observing with the large telescope of the Lowell Observatory, found that when the
sky is clear, the moon absent, and the seeing
perfect, " the sky appeared in patches to be of a brownish colour," and suggests that this colour owes its existence to immense cosmical clouds,
which are shining by excessively feeble light!
1 Cape Observations, p. 98. 2 Transactions, Royal Dublin Society, vol. 2.



NEBULAS AND CLUSTERS 211
Dr. See found that these brown patches seem to
cluster in certain regions of the Milky Way.1
From a comparison of Trouvelot's drawing of the small elongated nebula near the great nebula in Andromeda with recent photographs, Mr. Easton infers that this small nebula has probably rotated
through an angle of about 15 in 25 years. An examination I have made of photographs taken in different years seems to me to confirm this
suspicion, which, if true, is evidently a most interesting phenomenon. Dr. Max Wolf of Heidelberg finds, by spectrum
photography, that the well-known " ring nebula "
in Lyra consists of four rings composed of four
different gases. Calling the inner ring A, the
next B, the next C, and the outer D, he finds that
A
is the smallest ring, and is composed of an un
known gas ; the next largest, B, is composed of hydrogen gas ; the next, C, consists of helium
gas ; and the outer and largest ring, D, is composed
like A of an unknown gas. As the molecular
weight of hydrogen is 2*016, and that of helium is 3'96, Prof. Bohuslav Brauner suggests that the molecular weight of the gas composing the inner
ring A is smaller than that of hydrogen, and the molecular weight of the gas forming the outer
ring D is greater than that of helium. He also
suggests that the gas of ring A may possibly be
identical with the " coronium " of the solar
1 Ast. Nach., 3628, quoted in The Observatory, April, 1900.



ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
corona, for which Mendelief found a hypothetical atomic and molecular weight of 0'4. 1
With reference to the nebular hypothesis of
Laplace, Dr. A. R. Wallace argues that " if there
exists a sun in a state of expansion in which our sun was when it extended to the orbit of Neptune,
it would, even with a parallax of ^jth of a second, show a disc of half a second, which could be seen
with the Lick telescope." My reply to this objection is, that with such an expansion there would
probably be very little " intrinsic brightness," and if luminous enough to be visible the spectrum would be that of a gaseous nebula, and no known
star gives such a spectrum. But some planetary nebulae look like small stars, and with high
powers on large telescopes would probably show a disc. On these considerations, Dr. Wallace's objection does not seem to be valid.
It is usually stated in popular works on
astronomy that the spectra of gaseous nebulae show only three or four bright lines on a faint con
tinuous background. But this is quite incorrect.
No less than forty bright lines have ..been seen
and measured in the spectra of gaseous nebulas.2
This includes 2 lines of " nebulium," 11 of
hydrogen, 5 of helium, 1 of oxygen (?), 3 of nitrogen (?), 1 of silicon (?), and 17 of an unknown substance. In the great nebulas in Orion 30
bright lines have been photographed.3

NEBULAE AND CLUSTERS
D'Arrest found that " gaseous nebulas are rarely met with outside the Milky Way, and never at a considerable distance from it." l Mr. A. E. Fath thinks that "no spiral nebula
investigated has a truly continuous spectrum." He finds that so feeble is the intensity of the light
of the spiral nebulae that, while a spectrogram of Arcturus can be secured with the Mills spectro
graph " in less than two minutes," " an exposure of about 500 hours would be required for the great nebula in Andromeda, which is of the same spectral type." 2 Mr. Fath thinks that in the case of the Andromeda nebula, the " star cluster " theory seems to be the only one that can at all
adequately explain the spectrum obtained." 3 Prof. Barnard finds that the great cluster in
Hercules (Messier 13) is " composed of stars of
different spectral types." This result was confirmed by Mr. Fath.4 From observations with the great 40-inch
telescope of the Yerkes Observatory (U.S.A), Prof. Barnard finds that the nucleus of the
planetary nebula H. iv. 18 in Andromeda is variable to the extent of at least 3 magnitudes. At its brightest it is about the 12th magnitude ; and the period seems to be about 28 days. Barnard says, " I think this is the first case in
1 Copernicus, vol. iii. p. 55. 2 Lick Observatory Bulletin, No. 149. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid.



ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
which the nucleus of a planetary or other nebula
has been shown to be certainly variable." " The normal condition seems to be faint the nucleus
remaining bright for a few days only. In an ordinary telescope it looks like a small round disc of a bluish green colour." He estimated the brightness of the nebula as that of a star of 8' 2 magni
tude. 1 Even in a telescope of 4 Inches aperture,
this would be a fairly bright object. It lies about 3 degrees south-west of the star t Andromedse.
The so-called "globular clusters" usually
include stars of different brightness ; compara
tively bright telescopic stars of the 10th to 13th magnitude with faint stars of the 15th to 17th
magnitude. Prof. Perrine of the Lick Observatory finds that (a) " the division of the stars in globular
clusters into groups, differing widely in bright
ness, is characteristic of these objects "
; (6) " the
globular clusters are devoid of true nebulosity "
;
and (c) "stars fainter than 15th magnitude pre
dominate in the Milky Way and globular clusters,
but elsewhere are relatively scarce." He found that " exposures of one hour or thereabouts showed as many stars as exposures four to six times as
long ; the only effect of the longer exposures being in the matter of density." This last result confirms the late Dr. Roberts' conclusions. Perrine
finds that for clusters in the Milky Way, the faint stars (15th to 17th magnitude) "are about as
1 Monthly Notice*, R.A.S., April, 1008, pp. 465-481.



NEBULA AND CLUSTERS 215
numerous in proportion to the bright stars (10th to 13th magnitude) as in the globular clusters themselves." This is, however, not the case with globular clusters at a distance from the Milky Way. In these latter clusters he found that "in the regions outside the limits of the cluster there are usually
very few faint stars, hardly more than one-fourth
or one-tenth as many as there are bright stars "
;
and he thinks that " this paucity of faint stars "
in the vincity of these clusters " gives rise to the
suspicion that all regions at a distance from the Galaxy may be almost devoid of these very faint
stars." The late Prof. Keeler's series of nebular
photographs " in or near the Milky Way " tend to confirm the above conclusions. Perrine finds the northernmost region of the Milky Way "to
be almost, if not entirely, devoid of globular clusters." l
According to Sir John Herschel, " the sublimity
of the spectacle afforded " by Lord Rosse's great
telescope of 6 feet in diameter of some of the
" larger globular and other clusters " " is declared by all who have witnessed it, to be such that no
words can express." 2 In his address to the British Association at
Leicester in 1907, Sir David Gill said
"Evidence upon evidence has accumulated to
show that nebulae consist of the matter out of

216 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
which stars have been and are being evolved. . . .
The fact of such an evolution with the evidence before us, can hardly be doubted. I most fully
believe that, when the modifications of terrestrial spectra under sufficiently varied conditions of
temperature, pressure, and environment, have
been further studied, this connection will be greatly strengthened."



CHAPTER XVIII
Historical
THE grouping of the stars into constellations
is of great antiquity. The exact date of their formation is not exactly known, but an approximate result may be arrived at from
the following considerations. On the celestial
spheres, or " globes," used by the ancient astronomers, a portion of the southern heavens of a roughly circular form surrounding the South Pole was left blank. This space presumably contained the stars in the southern hemisphere which
they could not see from their northern stations. Now, the centre of this circular blank space most probably coincided with the South Pole of the heavens at the time when the constellations were first formed. Owing to the "Precession of the
Equinoxes " this centre has now moved away from the South Pole to a considerable distance.
It can be easily computed at what period this centre coincided with the South Pole, and calculations show that this was the case about 2700 B.C.
The position of this circle also indicates that the



218 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
constellations Avere formed at a place between 36 and 40 north latitude, and therefore probably somewhere in Asia Minor north of Mesopotamia. Again, the most ancient observations refer to
Taurus as the equinoxial constellation. Virgil
says
" Candidus auratis aperit cum cornibus annum Taurus." l
This would indicate a date about 3000 B.C.
There is no tradition, however, that the constella
tion Gemini was ever seen to occupy this position, so that 3000 B.C. seems to be the earliest date
admissible. 2 Prof. Sayce thinks that the "signs of the
Zodiac " had their origin in the plains of Mesopotamia in the twentieth or twenty-third century
B.C., and Brown gives the probable date as 2084
B.C. 3
According to Seneca, the study of astronomy among the Greeks dates back to about 1400 B.C. ;
and the ancient constellations were already classical in the time of Eudoxus in the fourth
century B.C. Eudoxus (408-355 B.C.) observed the
positions of forty-seven stars visible in Greece, thus forming the most ancient star catalogue which has been preserved. He was a son of
1 Georgics, i. 11. 217-18.

HISTORICAL 219
Eschinus, and a pupil of Archytas and probably Plato.
The work of Eudoxus was put into verse by the
poet Aratus (third century B.C.). This poem describes all the old constellations now known, except Libra, the Balance, which was at that time included in the Claws of the Scorpion. About
B.C. 50, the Romans changed the Claws, or Chelae, into Libra. Curious to say, Aratus states that the constellation Lyra contained no bright star! 1
Whereas its principal star, Vega, is now one of the brightest stars in the heavens 1
With reference to the origin of the constellations, Aratus says
" Some men of yore
A nomenclature thought of and devised And forms sufficient found."
This shows that even in the time of Aratus the
constellations were of great antiquity.
Brown says
"Writers have often told us, speaking only
from the depths of their ignorance, how ' Chaldean '
shepherds were wont to gaze at the brilliant
nocturnal sky, and to imagine that such and such
stars resemble this or that figure. But all this
is merely the old effort to make capital out of
nescience, and the stars are before our eyes to prove the contrary. Having already certain fixed
ideas and figures in his mind, the constellation
former, when he came to his task, applied his

figures to the stars and the stars to his figures
as harmoniously as possible." * " Thus e.g. he
arranged the stars of Andromeda into the repre
sentation of a chained lady, not because they
naturally reminded him (or anybody else) of such
a figure, but because he desired to express that idea."
A coin of Manius Aquillus, B.C. 94, shows four
stars in Aquila, and seems to be the oldest representation extant of a star group. On a coin r of B.C. 43, Dr. Vencontre found five stars, one of which was much larger than the others, and concludes
that it represents the Hyades (in Taurus). He attributes the coin to P. Clodius Turrinus, who
probably used the constellation Taurus or Tauri
nus as a phonetic reference to his surname. A coin
struck by L. Lucretius Trio in 74 B.C., shows the
seven stars of the Plough, or as the ancients called
them Septem Triones. Here we have an allusion
to the name of the magistrate Trio.2 In a work published in Berne in 1760, Schmidt contends that the ancient Egyptians gave to the constellations of the Zodiac the names of their
divinities, and expressed them by the signs which were used in their hieroglyphics.3
Hesiod mentions Orion, the Pleiades, Sirius, Aldebaran, and Arcturus ; and Homer refers to
Orion, Arcturus, the Pleiades, the Hyades, the
1 Primitive Constellation*, vol. ii. p. 225. 2 Nature, October 2, 1890. 8 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. i. pp. 243-4.



HISTORICAL
Great Bear (under the name of Amaxa, the
Chariot), and the tail of the Little Bear, or
" Cynosura." Hipparchus called the constellations Asterisms
(doreptoTAos), Aristotle and Hyginus So/mra (bodies), and Ptolemy ^xw*- (figures). By some they
were called , Mop^wo-cts (configurations), and by others Merewpe. Proclus called those near the ecliptic ZwSia (animals). Hence our modern name Zodiac.
Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Al-Sufi referred the
positions of the stars to the ecliptic. They are now referred to the equator. Aboul Hassan in the
thirteenth century (1282) was the first to use Right Ascensions and Declinations instead of Longitudes and Latitudes. The ancient writers described the
stars by their positions in the ancient figures. Thus they spoke of "the star in the head of
Hercules," "the bright star in the left foot of Orion " (Rigel) ; but Bayer in 1603 introduced the
Greek letters to designate the brighter stars, and these are now universally used by astronomers.
These letters being sometimes insufficient, Hevelius
added numbers, but the numbers in Flamsteed's
Catalogue are now generally used. Ptolemy and all the ancient writers described the constellation figures as they are seen 011
globes, that is from the outside. Bayer in his
Atlas, published in 1603, reversed the figures to show them as they would be seen from the interior



222 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of a hollow globe and as, of course, they are seen in the sky. Hevelius again reversed Bayer's figures to make them correspond with those of
Ptolemy. According to Bayer's arrangement, Betelgeuse (a Orionis) would be on the left shoulder of Orion, instead of the right shoulder
according to Ptolemy and Al-Sufi, and Rigel
(ft Orionis) on the right foot (Bayer) instead of the left foot (Ptolemy). This change of position has led to some confusion; but at present the
positions of the stars are indicated by their Right
Ascensions and Declinations, without any reference to their positions in the ancient figures.
The classical constellations of Hipparchus and
Ptolemy number forty-eight, and this is the number described by Al-Sufi in his "Description
of the Fixed Stars " written in the tenth century
A.D.
Firminicus gives the names of several constellations not mentioned by Ptolemy. M. Freret thought that these were derived from the
Egyptian' sphere of Petosiris. Of these a Fox was placed north of the Scorpion ; a constellation called Cynocephalus near the southern constellation of the Altar (Ara); and to the north of
Pisces was placed a Stag. But all these have long since been discarded. Curious to say neither the
Dragon nor Cepheus appears on the old Egyptian
sphere. 1
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. i. pp. 242-3.



HISTORICAL 223
Other small constellations have also been formed by various astronomers from time to
time, but these have disappeared from our modern star maps. The total number of con
stellations now recognized in both hemispheres
amounts to eighty-four. The first catalogue formed was nominally that
of Eudoxus in the fourth century B.C. (about 370
B.C.). But this can hardly be dignified by the
name of catalogue, as it contained only fortyseven stars, and it omits several of the brighter
stars, notably Sirius ! The first complete (or nearly complete) catalogue of stars visible to the naked eye was that of Hipparchus about 129 B.C. Ptolemy informs us that it was the sudden appearance of
a bright new or "temporary star" in the year 134 B.c. in the constellation Scorpio which led
Hipparchus to form his catalogue, and there seems to be no reason to doubt the accuracy of
this statement, as the appearance of this star is recorded in the Chinese Annals. The Cata
logue of Hipparchus contains only 1080 stars ; but as many more are visible to the naked eye, Hipparchus must have omitted those which are not immediately connected with the old constellation figures of men and animals. ,
Hipparchus' Catalogue was revised by Ptolemy in his famous work the Almagest. Ptolemy reduced the positions of the stars given by
Hipparchus to the year 137 A.D. ; but used a



224 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
wrong value of the precession which only corre
sponded to about 50 A.D. ; and he probably
adopted the star magnitudes of Hipparchus without any revision. Indeed, it seems somewhat doubtful whether Ptolemy made any observations of the brightness of the stars himself. Ptolemy's
catalogue contains 1022 stars.
Prof. De Morgan speaks of Ptolemy as "a splendid mathematician and an indifferent
observer "
; and from my own examination of Al-Sufi's work on the Fixed Stars, which was based on Ptolemy's work, I think that De
Morgan's criticism is quite justified. Al-Sufi's Description of the Fixed Stars was written in the tenth century and contains 1018
stars. He seems to have adopted the positions
of the stars given by Ptolemy, merely correcting them for the effects of precession ; but he made a very careful revision of the star magnitudes of
Ptolemy (or Hipparchus) from his own observations, and this renders his work the most valu
able, from this point of view, of all the ancient
catalogues. Very little is known about Al-Sufi's life, and the few details we have are chiefly derived from the
works of the historians Abu'-l-faradji and Casiri, and the Oriental writers Hyde, Caussin, Sedillot, etc. Al-Sufi's complete name was Abd-al-Rahman Bin Umar Bin Muhammad Bin Sahl Abu'l-husain
al-Sufi al-Razi. The name Sufi indicates that he



HISTORICAL 225
belonged to the sect of Sufis (Dervishes), and the name Razi that he lived in the town of Ra'i in Persia, to the east of Teheran. He was born on December 7, 903 A.D., and died on May 25, 986, so
that, like many other astronomers, he lived 'to a
good old age. According to ancient authorities,
Al-Sufi as he is usually called was a very learned man, who lived at the courts of Schiraz and Baghdad under Adhad-al-Davlat of the dynasty of the Buides who was then the ruler of Persia. Al-Sufi was held in high esteem and
great favour by this prince, who said of him,
" Abd-al-Rahman al-Sufi taught me to know the names and positions of the fixed stars, Scharif Ibn al-Aalam the use of astronomical tables, and
Abu Ali al-Farisi instructed me in the principles of grammar." Prince Adhad-al-Davlat died on
March 26, 983. According to Caussin, Al-Sufi also wrote a book 011 astrology, and a work entitled Al-Ardjouze, which seems to have been written in verse, but its subject is unknown. He also seems to have determined the exact length of the year, and to have undertaken geodetic measurements. The al-Aalam mentioned above was also an able astronomer, and in addition to
numerous observations made at Baghdad, he determined with great care the precession of the equinoxes. He found the annual constant of
precession to be 51"'4, a value which differs but
little from modern results.
Q



226 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
In the year 1874, the late M. Schjellerup, the eminent Danish astronomer, published a French translation of two Arabic manuscripts written by
Al-Sufi and entitled " A Description of the Fixed
Stars." One of these manuscripts is preserved in
the Royal Library at Copenhagen, and the other in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburgh.1 Al-Sufi seems to have been a most careful and
accurate observer, and although, as a rule, his estimates of the relative brightness of stars are in
fairly good agreement with modern estimates and photometric measures, there are many remarkable
and interesting differences. Al-Sufi's observations
have an important bearing on the supposed
" secular variation " of the stars ; that is, the slow variation in light which may have occurred in the
course of ages in certain stars, apart from the periodical variation which is known to occur in the so-called variable stars. More than 900 years
have now elapsed since the date of Al-Sufi's observations (about A.D. 964) and over 2000 years
in the case of Hipparchus, and although these periods are of course very short in the life-history
of any star, still some changes may possibly have taken place in the brightness of some of them.
1 There are three copies of Al-Sufi's work in the Imperial Library at Paris, but these are inaccurate. There is also one in the British Museum Library, and another in the India Office Library ; but these are imperfect, considerable portions of the original work being missing.



HISTORICAL
There are several cases in which a star seems to
have diminished in light since Al-Sufi's time.
This change seems to have certainly occurred in
the case of Eridani, ft Leonis, Piscis Australis, and some others. On the other hand, some stars
seem to have certainly increased in brightness,
and the bearing of these changes on the question
of " stellar evolution " will be obvious.
In most cases Al-Sufi merely mentions the magnitude which he estimated a star to be ; such
as "third magnitude," "fourth," "small third magnitude," "large fourth," etc. In some cases, however, he directly states that a certain star is a little brighter than another star near it. Such cases unfortunately not numerous are very valuable for comparison with modern estimates and measures, when variation is suspected in the
light of a star. The estimates of Argelander, Heis, and Houzeau are based on the same scale as
that used by Ptolemy and Al-Sufi. Al-Sufi's
estimates are given in thirds of a magnitude.
Thus, " small third magnitude " means 3|, or 3*33 magnitude in modern measures ;
" large fourth," 3| or 3' 66 magnitude. These correspond with the estimates of magnitude given by Argelander, Heis, and Houzeau in their catalogues of stars visible to the naked eye, and so the estimates can
be directly compared. I have made an independent identification of all the stars mentioned by Al-Sufi. In the



228 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
majority of cases my identifications concur with
those of Schjellerup ; but in some cases I cannot agree with him. In a few cases I have found
that Al-Sufi himself, although accurately describing the position of the stars observed by him,
has apparently misidentified the star observed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. This becomes evident
when we plot Ptolemy's positions (as given by Al-Sufi) and compare them with Al-Sufi' s descriptions of the stars observed by him. This I have done in all cases where there seemed to be any doubt ; and in this way I have arrived at some
interesting results which have escaped the notice of Schjellerup. This examination shows clearly, I think, that Al-Sufi did not himself measure the
positions of the stars he observed, but merely adopted those of Ptolemy, corrected for the effect
of precession. The great value of his work, however, consists in his estimates of star magnitudes, which seem to have been most carefully made,
and from this point of view, his work is invaluable. Prof. Pierce says, "The work which
the learning of M. Schjellerup has brought to light is so important that the smallest errors of
detail become interesting." 1 Although Al-Sufi' s work is mentioned by the writers referred to above, no complete translation of his manuscript was made until the task was undertaken by Schjellerup, and even now Al-Sufi's
1 Harvard Annals, vol. ix. p. 51.



HISTORICAL 229
name is not mentioned in some popular works on
astronomy ! But lie was certainly the best of all
the old observers, and his work is deserving of the most careful consideration.
Al-Sufi's descriptions of the stars were, it is
true, based on Ptolemy's catalogue, but his work is not a mere translation of that of his pre
decessor. It is, on the contrary, a careful and
independent survey of the heavens, made from
his own personal observations, each of Ptolemy's stars having been carefully examined as to its
position and magnitude, and Ptolemy's mistakes corrected. In examining his descriptions,
Schjellerup says, "We soon see the vast extent
of his labours, his perseverance, and the minute accuracy and almost modern criticism with which he executed his work." In fact, Al-Sufi has given
us a careful description of the starry sky as it appeared in his time, and one which deserves the
greatest confidence. It far surpasses the work of Ptolemy, which had been without a rival for
eight centuries previously, and it has only been equalled in modern times by the surveys of
Argelander, Gould, Heis, and Houzeau. Plato remarked with reference to the catalogue of
Hipparchus, Ccelam posteris in hereditatem relictum, and the same may be said of Al-Sufi's work. In addition to his own estimates of star
magnitudes, Al-Sufi adds the magnitudes given by Ptolemy whenever Ptolemy's estimate differs



230 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
from his own ; and this makes his work still more
valuable, as Ptolemy's magnitudes given in all the editions of the Almagest now extant are quite
untrustworthy. In the preface to his translation of Al-Sufi's work, Schjellerup mentions some remarkable dis
crepancies between the magnitudes assigned to certain stars by Ptolemy and Argelaiider. This comparison is worthy of confidence as it is
known that both Al-Sufi and Argelander adopted
Ptolemy's (or Hipparchus') scale of magnitudes. For example, all these observers agree that /? Ursse
Minoris (Ptolemy's No. 6 of that constella
tion) is of the 2nd magnitude, while in the case
of y Ursse Minoris (Ptolemy's No. 7), Ptolemy
called it 2nd, and Argelander rated it 3rd ;
Argelander thus making y one magnitude fainter than Ptolemy's estimate. Now, Al-Sufi, observing over 900 years ago, rated y of the 3rd magni
tude, thus correcting Ptolemy and agreeing with Argelander. Modern photometric measures confirm the estimates of Al-Sufi and Argelander.
But it is, of course, possible that one or both stars may be variable in light, and /? has actually
been suspected of variation. Almost all the constellations afford examples of this sort. In
the majority of cases, however, Al-Sufi agrees well with Argelander and Heis, but there are in
some cases differences which suggest a change
in relative brightness.



HISTORICAL
Among other remarkable things contained in Al-Sufi's most interesting work may be mentioned the great nebula in Andromeda, which was first noticed in Europe as visible to the naked eye by
Simon Marius in 1612. Al-Sufi, however, speaks of it as a familiar object in his time.
Schjellerup says
" For a long time many of the stars in Ptolemy's
catalogue could not be identified in the sky.
Most of these discordances were certainly due to mistakes in copying, either in longitude or lati
tude. Many of these differences were, however,
corrected by the help of new manuscripts. For
this purpose Al-Sufi's work is of great importance.
By a direct examination of the sky he succeeded
in finding nearly all the stars reported by
Ptolemy (or Hipparchus). And even if his
criticism may sometimes seem inconclusive, his
descriptions are not subject to similar defects,
his positions not depending solely on the places
given in Ptolemy's catalogue. For, in addition to
the longitudes and latitudes quoted from Ptolemy,
he has described by alignment the positions of
the stars referred to. In going from the brightest
and best known stars of each constellation he
indicates the others either by describing some
peculiarity in their position, or by giving their
mutual distance as so many cubits (dzird), or a
span (schibr), units of length which were used at
that time to measure apparent celestial distances.
The term dzird means literally the fore-arm from
the bone of the elbow to the tip of the middle
finger, or an ell. We should not, however, con
clude from this that the Arabians were so un
scientific as to measure celestial distances by an
ell, as this would be quite in contradiction to



232 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
their well-known knowledge of Geometry and Trigonometry."
With reference to the arc or angular distance
indicated by the "cubit," Al-Sufi states in his
description of the constellation Auriga that the
dzird (or cubit) is equal to 2 20'. Three cubits,
therefore, represent 7, and 4 cubits 9 20'. In Al-Sufi's own preface to his work, after
first giving glory to God and blessings on "his elected messenger Muhammed and his family," he proceeds to state that he had often "met with many persons who wished to know the fixed
stars, their positions on the celestial vault, and the constellations, and had found that these persons may be divided into two classes. One followed the method of astronomers and trust
to spheres designed by artists, who not knowing, the stars themselves, take only the longitudes and latitudes which they find in the books, and
thus place the stars on the sphere, without being able to distinguish truth from error. It then follows that those who really know the stars in
the sky find on examining these spheres that many stars are otherwise than they are in the sky. Among these are Al-Battani, Atarid and others."
Al-Sufi seems rather hard on Al-Battani (or
Albategnius as he is usually called) for he is generally considered to have been the most



HISTORICAL 233
distinguished of the Arabian astronomers. His real name was Mohammed Ibn Jaber Ibn Senaii Abu Abdallah Al-Harrani. He was born about
A.D. 850 at Battan, near Harran in Mesopotamia, and died about A.D. 929. He was the first to
make use of sines instead of chords, and versed
sines. The ALphonsine Tables of the moon's motions were based on his observations. After some severe criticisms on the work of Al-Battani and Atarid, Al-Sufi goes on to say that the other class of amateurs who desire to know the fixed stars follow the method of the Arabians in the science of Anva 1 and the mansions of the moon and the books written on this subject. Al-Sufi found many books on the anva, the best being those of Abu Hanifa alDinavari, This work shows that the author knew the Arabic tradition better than any of the other writers on the subject. Al-Sufi, however, doubts that he had a good knowledge of the stars themselves, for if he had he would not
have followed the errors of his predecessors. According to Al-Sufi, those who know one of these methods do not know the other. Among these is Abu-Hanifa, who states in his book that the names of the twelve signs (of the Zodiac)
did not originate from the arrangement or
1 The science of the risings and settings of the stars was called Urn el-anwa (Caussin, Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la
Bibliotheque due Hoi, tome xii. p. 237).



ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
configuration of the stars resembling the figure from which the name is derived. The stars, Abu
Hanifa said, "change their places, and although the names of the signs do not change, yet the arrangement of the stars ceases to be the same. This shows that he was not aware of the fact
that the arrangement of the stars does not change, and their mutual distances and their
latitudes, north and south of the ecliptic, are neither increased nor diminished." "The stars,"
Al-Sufi says, "do not change with regard to
their configurations, because they are carried
along together by a physical motion and by a motion round the poles of the ecliptic. This is why they are called fixed. Abu-Hanifa supposed that they are termed fixed because their motion is
very slow in comparison with that of the planets." "These facts," he says, "can only be known to those who follow the method of the astronomers and are skilled in mathematics." Al-Sufi says that the stars of the Zodiac have a certain movement following the order of the
signs, which according to Ptolemy and his predecessors is a degree in 100 years. But according to the authors of al-mumtahan and those
who have observed subsequently to Ptolemy, it is a degree in 66 years. According to modern measures, the precession is about 50"*35 per annum, or one degree in 71J years. Al-Siifi says that the Arabians did not make



HISTORICAL 235
use of the figures of the Zodiac in their proper
signification, because they divided the circumference of the sky by the number of days which the moon took to describe it about 28
days and they looked for conspicuous stars at intervals which, to the eye, the moon appeared to describe in a day and a night. They began
with al-scharatain, " the two marks " (a and
/3 Arietis) which were the first striking points following the point of the spring equinox. They then sought behind these two marks another
point at a distance from them, equal to the space described by the moon in a day and a night. In this way they found al-butatn (e, 3, and
p Arietis) ; after that al-tsuraija, the Pleiades ;
then al-dabaran, the Hyades, and thus all the
" mansions " of the moon. They paid no attention to the signs of the Zodiac, nor to the extent of the figures which composed them. This is why they reckoned among the "mansions" al
Jiaka (A Orionis) which forms no part of the signs
of the Zodiac, since it belongs to the southern
constellation of the Giant (Orion). And similarly for other stars near the Zodiac, of which Al
Sufi gives some details. He says that Begulus
(a Leonis) was called by the Arabians al-maliki, the Royal Star, and that al-anva consists of
five stars situated in the two wings of the Virgin.
These stars seem to be /?, 17, y, 8, and c Virginis,
which form with Spica (a Virginis) a Y-shaped



236 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
figure. Spica was called simak al-azal, the unarmed simak ; the " armed simak " being Arcturus, simak al-ramih. These old Arabic names seem
very fanciful.
Al-Sufi relates that in the year 337 of the
Hegira (about A.D. 948) he went to Ispahan with Prince Abul-fadhl, who introduced him to an inhabitant of that city, named Varvadjah, well known in that country, and famous for his astronomical acquirements. Al-Sufi asked him the names of the stars on an astrolabe which he
had, and he named Aldebaran, the two bright
stars in the Twins (Castor and Pollux), Regulus, Sirius, and Procyon, the two Simaks, etc. Al-Sufi also asked him in what part of the sky Al-fard
(a Hydrse) was, but he did not know ! After
wards, in the year 349, this same man was at the court of Prince Adhad-al-Davlat, and in the presence of the Prince, Al-Sufi asked him the name of a bright star it was al-nasr al-vaki,
the falling Vulture (Vega), and he replied, " That
is al-aijuk " (Capella) ! thus showing that he only knew the names of the stars, but did not know them when he saw them in the sky. Al-Sufi adds that all the women "who spin in
their houses" knew this star (Vega) by the
name of al-atsafi, the Tripod. But this could not be said even of "educated women" at the
present day. With reference to the number of stars which



HISTORICAL 237
can be seen with the naked eye, Al-Sufi says, " Many people believe that the total number of fixed stars is 1025, but this is an evident error.
The ancients only observed this number of stars,
which they divided into six classes according to
magnitude. They placed the brightest in the 1st magnitude ; those which are a little smaller in the 2nd ; those which are a little smaller again in the 3rd ; and so on to the 6th. As to those which are below the 6th magnitude, they found that their number was too great to count ; and this is why they have omitted them. It is easy
to convince one's self of this. If we attentively fix
ourgaze on a constellation of which the stars are
well known and registered, we find in the spaces between them many other stars which have not been counted. Take, for example, the Hen
[Cygnus] ; it is composed of seventeen internal
stars, the first on the beak, the brightest on the tail, the others on the wings, the neck and the breast ; and below the left wing are two stars which do not come into the figure. Between these different
stars, if you examine with attention, you will perceive a multitude of stars, so small and so crowded that we cannot determine their number.
It is the same with all the other constellations." These remarks are so correct that they might have been written by a modern astronomer. It
should be added, however, that all the faint stars referred to by Al-Sufi and thousands of



238 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
others still fainter have now been mapped down
and their positions accurately determined. About the year 1437, Ulugh Beigh, son of Shah Rokh, and grandson of the Mogul Emperor Tamerlane, published a catalogue of stars in which he corrected Ptolemy's positions. But he
seems to have accepted Al-Sufi's star magnitudes without any attempt at revision. This is unfortu
nate, for an independent estimate of star magnitudes made in the fifteenth century would now
be very valuable for comparison with Al-Sufi's work and with modern measures. Ulugh Beigh's
catalogue contains 1018 stars, nearly the same number as given by Ali-Sufi.1

to say, Al-Sufi rated tke Pole Star
as 3rd magnitude ; for it is now only slightly less than the 2nd. At present it is about the same brightness as ft of the same constellation (Ursa Minor) which Al-Sufi rated
2nd magnitude. It was, however, also rated 3rd magnitude by Ptolemy (or Hipparchus), and it may possibly have varied in brightness since ancient times. Admiral Smyth says that in his
time (1830) it was " not even a very bright third
size "

2 Spectroscopic measures show that it is approaching the earth at the rate of 16 miles a
second ; but this would have no perceptible effect
on its brightness in historical times. This may
seem difficult to understand, and to some perhaps

240 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
incredible ; but the simple explanation is that its distance from the earth is so great that a journey of even 2000 years with the above velocity would
make no appreciable difference in its distance !
This is undoubtedly true, as a simple calculation will show, and the fact will give some idea of the vast distance of the stars. The well-known 9th
magnitude companion to the Pole Star was seen
by day in the Dorpat telescope by Struve and Wrangel ; and " on one occasion by Encke and
Argelander." x The star /? Ursse Minoris was called by the Arabians Kaiikab al-shamdli, the North Star, as
it was owing to the precession of the Equinoxes nearer to the Pole in ancient times than our
present Pole Star was then.
The " Plough " (or Great Bear) is supposed to
represent a waggon and horses. " Charles' Wain "
is a corruption of "churl's wain," or peasant's cart. The Arabians thought that the four stars
in the quadrilateral represented a bier, and the
three in the " tail " the children of the deceased
following as mourners ! In the Greek mythology,
Ursa Major represented the nymph Callisto, a daughter of Lycaon, who was loved by Jupiter, and turned into a bear by the jealous Juno. Among the old Hindoos the seven stars represented the seven Rishis. It is the Otawa of the great Finnish epic, the " Kalevala." It was also called

" David's Chariot," and in America it is known as
"The Dipper." Closely north of the star 6 in Ursa Major is a small star known as Flamsteed 26. This is not
mentioned by Al-Sufi. but is now, I find from
personal observation, very visible, and indeed
conspicuous, to the naked eye. I find, however,
that owing to the large " proper motion " of the
bright star (1"*1 per annum) the two stars were much closer together in Al-Sufi's time than they
are at present, and this probably accounts for
Al-Sufi's omission. This is an interesting and curious fact, and shows the small changes which occur in the heavens during the course of
ages. Close to the star , the middle star of the " tail "
of Ursa Major (or handle of the " Plough "), is a
small star known as Alcor, which is easily visible
to good eyesight without optical aid. It is mentioned by Al-Sufi, who says the Arabians
called it al-suha, " the little unnoticed one." He says that " Ptolemy does not mention it, and it
is a star which seems to test the powers of
the eyesight." He adds, however, an Arabian proverb, " I show him al-suha, and he shows me the moon," which seems to suggest that to some
eyes, at least, it was no test of sight at all. It
has, however, been suspected of variation in light. It was rated 5th magnitude by Argelander, Heis, and Houzeau, but was measured 4*02 at Harvard R

Observatory. It has recently been found to be
a spectroscopic binary. The constellation of the Dragon (Draco) is probably referred to in Job (chap. xxvi. v. 13), where it is called " the crooked serpent." In the Greek
mythology it is supposed to represent the dragon which guarded the golden apples in the Garden
of the Hesperides. Some have suggested that it represented the serpent which tempted Eve. Dryden says, in his translation of Virgil
" Around our Pole the spiry Dragon glides,
And like a wand'ring stream the Bears divides."
The fact that the constellation Bootis rises
quickly and sets slowly, owing to its lying
horizontally when rising and vertically when setting, was noted by Aratus, who says
" The Bearward now, past seen, But more obscured, near the horizon lies ; For with the four Signs the Ploughman, as he sinks,
The deep receives ; and when tired of day At even lingers more than half the night, When with the sinking sun he likewise sets These nights from bis late setting bear their name." l
The cosmical setting of Bootis that is, when he sets at sunset is stated by Ovid to occur on March 5 of each year. With reference to the constellation Hercules, Admiral Smyth says
" The kneeling posture has given rise to

momentous discussion ; and whether it represents
Lycaoii lamenting his daughter's transformation,
or Prometheus sentenced, or Ixion ditto, or
Thamyrus mourning his broken fiddle, remains
still uncertain. But in process of time, this figure
became a lion, and Hyginus mentions both the
lion's skin and the club ; while the right foot's
being just over the head of the Dragon, satisfied
the my thologists that he was crushing the Lernsean
hydra. . . . Some have considered the emblem as
typifying the serpent which infested the vicinity
of Cape Tsenarus, whence a sub-genus of Ophi
dians still derives its name. At all events a poet,
indignant at the heathen exaltation of Hevelius,
has said
" To Cerberus, too, a place is given
His home of old was far from heaven.' " l
Aratus speaks of Hercules as " the Phantom whose name none can tell." There were several heroes of the name of Hercules, but the most famous was Hercules the Theban, son of Jupiter and Alcmene wife of
Amphitryon, King of Thebes, who is said to have lived some years before the siege of Troy, and
went 011 the voyage of the Argonauts about
1300 B.C. According to some ancient writers, another Hercules lived about 2400 B.C., and was a contemporary of Atlas and Theseus. But according to Petau, Atlas lived about 1638 B.C., and
Lalande thought that this chronology is the more
probable. The small constellation Lyra, which contains
1 Bedford Catalogue, p. 385.



244 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
the bright star Vega, is called by Al-Sufi the Lyre, the Goose, the Persian harp, and the Tor
toise. In his translation of Al-Sufi's work,
Schjellerup suggests that the name " Goose " may perhaps mean a plucked goose, which somewhat resembles a Greek lyre, and also a tortoise. The
name of the bright star Vega is a corruption of the Arabic vdki. Ptolemy and Al-Sufi included
all the very brightest stars in the " first magni
tude," making no distinction between them, but it is evident at a glance that several of them, such as Arcturus and Vega, are brighter than an
average star of the first magnitude, like Aldebaran. The constellation Perseus, which lies south-east
of " Cassiopeia's Chair," may be recognized by the festoon formed by some of its stars, the bright star a Persei being among them. It is called by
Al-Sufi " barschdnsch, Ilepo-evs, Perseus, who is hamil rds al-gul, the Bearer of the head of al-gul'
According to Kazimirski, " Gul was a kind of demon or ogre who bewilders travellers and devours them,
beginning at the feet. In general any mischievous
demon capable of taking all sorts of forms." In
the Greek mythology Perseus was supposed to be the son of Jupiter and Danse. He is said to have been cast into the sea with his mother and saved
by King Polydectus. He afterwards cut off the head of Medusa, one of the Gorgons, while she slept, and armed with this he delivered Andromeda from the sea-monster.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 245
The constellation Auriga lies east of Perseus
and contains the bright star Capella, one of the
three brightest stars in the northern hemisphere
(the others being Arcturus and Vega). Theon, in his commentary on Aratus, says that Bellerophon invented the chariot, and that it is represented in the heavens by Auriga, the celestial coachman.
According to Dupuis, Auriga represents Phaeton, who tried to drive the chariot of the sun, and
losing his head fell into the river Eridanus. The setting of Eridanus precedes by a few minutes that of Auriga, which was called by some of the ancient writers Amnis Phai-tontis.1 Auriga is called by Al-Sufi numsick al-ainna He who
holds the reins, the Coachman ; also al-indz, the She-goat. M. Dorn found in Ptolemy's work, the Greek name 'Hw'oxoi, Auriga, written in Arabic characters. Al-Sufi says, "This constellation is
represented by the figure of a standing man behind 'He who holds the head of al-gtiV [Perseus], and between the Pleiades and the Great
Bear."
Capella is, Al-Sufi says, " the bright and great star of the first magnitude which is on the left
shoulder [of the ancient figure] on the eastern edge of the Milky Way. It is that which is marked
on the astrolabe as alaijilk" The real meaning
of this name is unknown. Schjellerup thought, contrary to what Ideler says, that the name is
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. iv. p. 529.



246 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
identical with the Greek word 'A'i (a goat). Capella was observed at Babylon about 2000 B.C., and was then known as Dilgan. The Assyrian name was Icu, and the Persian name colca. It
was also called Capra Hircus, Cabrilla, Amalthea, and Olenia. In ancient times the rising of
Capella was supposed to presage the approach of
storms. Ovid says, " Olenia sidus pluviale Capellse." The constellation Aquila is called by Al-Sufi
al-ukdb, the Eagle, or al-nasr al-td'ir, the flying vulture. According to the ancient poets the eagle carried nectar to Jupiter when he was hidden in a cave in Crete. This eagle also assisted
Jupiter in his victory over the Giants and contributed to his other pleasures. For these reasons the eagle was consecrated to Jupiter, and was placed in the sky. Al-Sufi says, " There are in this
figure three famous stars [y, a, and /? Aquilae], which are called al-nasr al-tdir." Hence is derived
the modern name Altair for the bright star a Aquilse. Al-Sufi says that the " common
people " call " the three famous stars " al-miz&n, the Balance, 011 account of the equality of the
stars." This probably refers to the approximately equal distances between y and a, and a and /?,
and not to their relative brightness. He says "Between the bright one of the tail [ Aquilse and the star in the beak of the Hen [ft Cygni] in the thinnest part of the Milky Way, we see the figure of a little earthen jar, of which the



THE CONSTELLATIONS 247
stars begin at the bright one in the tail, and extend towards the north-west. [This seems to
refer to e Aquilse and the small stars near it.] They then turn towards the east in the base of the jar, and then towards the south-east to a
little cloud [4, 5, etc. Vulpeculse, a well-known group of small stars] which is found to the north of the two stars in the shaft of the Arrow [a and

/? Sagittae]. The cloud is on the eastern edge
of the jar, and the bright one 011 the tail on the western edge ; the orifice is turned towards the flying Vulture [Aquila], and the base toAvards the north. Among these are distinguished some of
the fourth, fifth, and sixth magnitudes [includ
ing, probably, 110, 111, 112, 113 Hercules, and 1 Vulpeculse] and Ptolemy says nothing of this figure, except the bright star in the tail of the



248 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Eagle " (see figure). The above is a good example of the minute accuracy of detail in Al-Sufi's
description.
The southern portion of Aquila was formerly called Antinous, who was said to have been a
young man of great beauty born at Claudiopolis in Bithynia, and drowned in the Nile. Others
say that he sacrificed his life to save that of the
Emperor Hadrian, who afterwards raised altars
in his honour and placed his image on coins.1
The constellation Pegasus, Al-Sufi says, "is
represented by the figure of a horse, which has the head, legs, and forepart of the body to the end of the back, but it has neither hind quarters nor
hind legs." According to Brown, Pegasus was the horse of Poseidon, the sea god. Half of it was supposed to be hidden in the sea, into which the river Eridanus flowed.2 In the Greek mythology
it was supposed to represent the winged horse produced by the blood which fell from the head of Medusa when she was killed by Perseus !
Some think that it represents Bellerophoii's horse, and others the horse of Mmrod. It was also
called Sagmaria and Ephippiatus, and was sometimes represented with a saddle instead of wings.
In describing the constellation Andromeda, Al
Sufi speaks of two series of stars which start from the great nebula in Andromeda ; one series

going through 32 Andromedse, *, 8, and e to and T] ; and the other through v, /*, ft Andromedse into the constellation Pisces. He says they
enclose a fish-shaped figure called by the Arabians

and diverging meet again at x Persei, forming another "fish-like figure." The eastern stream
starts from r and passes through 55, y, 60, C2, 04, and 65 Andromedae ; and the western stream
from v through x 51, 54, and g Persei up to



250 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
X Persei. The head of the first " fish," al-lnM, is turned towards the north, and that of the second towards the south (see figure). Al-Sufi says that the stars a Persei, y, /?, 8, and
a Andromedae, and /3 Pegasi form a curved line.
This is quite correct, and this fine curve of bright stars may be seen at a glance on a clear night
in September, when all the stars are high in
the sky. The first constellation of the Zodiac, Aries, the Ram, was called, according to Aratus and Eratosthenes, Kpibs. It is mentioned by Ovid under the
name of Hellas. It4was also called by the ancients the Ram with the golden horns. Manilius
(fourth century B.C.) called it " The Prince." It is
supposed to have represented the god Bel.
Among the Accadians the sign meant " He who
dwells on the altar of uprightness." It first
appears on the Egyptian Zodiac; and it was sacred to Jupiter Ammon. In the Greek
mythology it was supposed to represent the ram, the loss of whose fleece led to the voyage
of the Argonauts. In the time of Hipparchus, about 2000 years ago, it was the first sign of the Zodiac, or that in which the sun is situated
at the Vernal Equinox (about March 21 in each
year). But owing to the precession of the equinoxes, this point has now moved back into
Pisces.
The brightest star of Aries (a) is sometimes



THE CONSTELLATIONS 251
called Hamal, derived from the Arabic al-hamal, a name given to the constellation itself by *A1Sufi. In the Accadian language it was called
Dilkur, " the dawn proclaimer." Ali-Sufi says that close to a, " as if it were attached to it," is a small star of the 6th magnitude, not mentioned
by Ptolemy. This is clearly K Arietis. The fact of Al-Sufi having seen and noticed this small star, which modern measures show to be below the 5th magnitude, is good evidence of his keen
eyesight and accuracy of observation.
According to Al-Sufi, the stars ft and y Arietis were called by the Arabians al-scharatain, "the two marks." They marked the "first mansion of the moon," and c, S, and p the second mansion. With reference to these so-called "mansions of the moon," Admiral Smyth says
"The famous Manazil al-kamar, i.e. Lunar
mansions, constituted a supposed broad circle in
Oriental astronomy divided into twenty-eight
unequal parts, corresponding with .the moon's
course, and therefore called the abodes of the
moon. This was not a bad arrangement for a
certain class of gazers, since the luminary was
observed to be in or near one or other of these parts, or constellations every night. Though
tampered with by astrologers, these Lunar
mansions are probably the earliest step in
ancient astronomy." x
Taurus, the second constellation of the Zodiac,

ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
was in ancient times represented by the figure of a bull, the hinder part of which is turned towards the south-west, and the fore part towards the east. It had no hind legs, and the head was turned to one side, with the horns extended towards the east. Its most ancient name was
Te, possibly a corruption of the Accadiaii dimmena, " a foundation - stone." The Greek
name is aOwp (0wwp, Eusebius). In the old Egyptian mythology Taurus represented the god Apis. According to Dupuis it#lso represented the 10th " labour of Hercules," namely, his victory over the cows of Geryon, King of Spain.1 It
was also supposed to represent the bull under the form of which Jupiter carried off Europa,
daughter of Agenor, King of the Phoenicians. It
may also refer to lo or Isis, who is supposed to have taught the ancient Egyptians the art
of agriculture. Aldebaraii is the well-known bright red star
in the Hyades. It was called by Ptolemy Fulgur succularum. Ali-Sufi says it was marked on the
old astrolabes as al-dabaran, " the Follower " (because it follows the Hyades in the diurnal
motion), and also ain al-tsaur, the eye of the bull. It may be considered as a standard star
of the 1st magnitude. Modern observations show
that it has a parallax of 0"'107. It is receding
from the earth, according to Vogel, at the rate
1 Lalande's Astronomie, vol. iv. p. 492.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 253
of about 30 miles a second ; but even with this
high velocity it will take thousands of years
before its brightness is perceptibly diminished. It has a faint companion of about the 10th magnitude at the distance of 118", which forms
a good " light test " for telescopes of 3 or 4 inches aperture. I saw it well with a 4-inch Wray
in the Punjab sky. The Hyades were called Succulce by the Romans, and in the Greek mythology were said to be children of Atlas.
The star ft Tauri, sometimes called Nath, from
the Arabic al-ndtih, the butting, is a bright star
between Capella and y Orionis (Bellatrix). It is on the tip of the horn in the ancient figure of
Taurus, and " therefore " (says Admiral Smyth)
" at the greatest distance from the hoof ; can this have given rise to the otherwise pointless sarcasm
of not knowing B from a bull's foot ? " l Al-Sufi
says that an imaginary line drawn from the star
now known as A Tauri to r Tauri would pass
between v and K Tauri, which is quite correct,
another proof of the accuracy of his observations. He also says that the star o> Tauri is exactly
midway between A and c, which is again correct.
He points out that Ptolemy's position of w is incorrect. This is often the case with Ptolemy's
positions, and tends to show that Ptolemy adopted the position given by Hipparchus without attempting to verify their position in the sky.
1 Bedford Catalogue, p. 120.



254 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Al-Sufi himself adopts the longtitudes and
latitudes of the stars as given by Ptolemy in
the Almagest, but corrects the positions in his
descriptions, when he found Ptolemy's places erroneous.
The famous group of the Pleiades is well known ;
but there is great difficulty in understanding AlSufi's description of the cluster. He says, "The 29th star (of Taurus) is the more northern of the anterior side of the Pleiades themselves, and the 30th is the southern of the same side ; the
31st is the following vertex of the Pleiades, and is in the more narrow part. The 32nd is situated outside the northern side. Among these stars, the
32nd is of the 4th magnitude, the others of the
5th." Now, it is very difficult or impossible to
identify these stars with the stars in the Pleiades
as they are at present. The brightest of all, Alcyone (77 Tauri), now about 3rd magnitude, does not seem to be mentioned at all by Al-Sufi ! as he
says distinctly that " the brightest star " (No 32 of Taurus) is "outside" the Pleiades "on the
northern side." It seems impossible to suppose that Al-Sufi could have overlooked Alcyone had it the same brightness it has now. The 32nd
star seems to have disappeared, or at least
diminished greatly in brightness, since the days of Al-Sufi. More than four stars were, however, seen by Al-Sufi, for he adds, " It is true that the stars of the Pleiades must exceed the four



THE CONSTELLATIONS 255
mentioned above, but I limit myself to these four because they are very near each other and the
largest [that is, the brightest] ; this is why I have
mentioned them, neglecting the others." A full examination of the whole question is given by Flammarion in his interesting work Les Etoiles
(pp. 289-307), and I must refer my readers to this
investigation for further details.
According to Brown, Simonides of Keos (B.C. 556-467) says, " Atlas was the sire of seven
daughters with violet locks, who are called the heavenly Peleiades" l The name is by some supposed to be derived from the Greek TrAetW, full. The Old Testament word Kimah (Job ix. 9 and xxviii. 31) and Amos (v. 8) is derived from
the Assyrian Kimta, a " family." Aratus describes the Pleiades in the following lines :
" Near his 2 left thigh together sweep along The flock of Clusterers. Not a mighty span Holds all, and they themselves are dim to see,
And seven paths aloft men say they take, Yet six alone are viewed by mortal eye. These seven are called by name Alkyoni Kelaini, Meropi and Steropi Taygeti, Elecktri, Maia queen. They thus together small and faint roll on Yet notable at morn and eve through Zeus." 3
The Pleiades are mentioned by Ovid. Accord
ing to the ancient poets they were supposed to

256 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
represent the children of Atlas and Hesperus, and on this account they were called Atlantids or Hesperides. From the resemblance in sound to
the word TrXctas, a pigeon, they were sometimes called " the doves," and for the same reason the
word TrAeu/, to navigate, led to their being called the "shipping stars." The word TrXctas was also
applied to the priestesses of the god Zeus (Jupiter) at Dordona, in the groves of which temple there were a number of pigeons. This is, perhaps, what Aratus refers to in the last line of the
extract quoted above. According to Neapolitan legends, the name of Virgil's mother was Maia. The mother of Buddha, the Hindoo avatar, was also named Maia. In Italy the Pleiades were
called Gallinata, and in France poussiniere, botli of which mean the hen and chickens, a term also given to them by Al-Sufi. The old Blackfoot
Indians called them " The Seven Perfect Ones." The Crees and Ojibway Indians called them the
" Fisher Stars." The Adipones of Brazil and some other nations claimed that they sprang from the Pleiades ! The Wyandot Indians called them " The Singing Maidens."
Photographs show that the brighter stars of the Pleiades are involved in nebulosity. That surrounding Maia seems to be of a spiral form. Now, there is a Sanscrit myth which represents
Maia as "weaving the palpable universe," for which reason she was " typified as a spider."



THE CONSTELLATIONS 257
This seems very appropriate, considering the web of nebulous light which surrounds the stars of the group. Maia was also considered as a type
of the universe, which again seems appropriate, as probably most of the stars were evolved from spiral nebulae.
The name Hyades is supposed to be derived from the Greek word veiv, to rain, because in ancient times they rose at the rainy season. In ancient Egypt, Aldebaran was called ary ; and the Pleiades chooa, a word which means " thousands." The name Aldebaran seems to have been originally applied to the whole of the Hyades group. Aldebaran was also called by
the Arabians al-fanik, the great Camel, and the Hyades al-kilas, the young Camels. The two close stars v and K Tauri were called al-kalbain, the dogs of Aldebaran. La Condamine states that the Indians of the Amazon saw in the Hyades the
head of a bull.
Gemini, the Twins, is the third constellation of
the Zodiac. It was also called Gemelli, etc.
According to Dupuis it represents the llth " labour of Hercules "his triumph over the dog Cerberus. 1 But some of Dupuis' ideas seem very
fanciful. The Twins are usually called Castor
and Pollux, but they were also called by the ancient writers Apollo and Hercules ; Jason and
Triptolemus ; Amphion and Zethus ; and Theseus
1 Lalande's Astronomie, vol. iv. p. 493,
S



258 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
and Peritheus. In Egypt they represented the deities Horus and Hippocrates. Brown thinks that
the " Great Twins " were originally the sun and
moon, " who live alternately. As one is born the other dies ; as one rises the other sets." l This applies to the full moon, but does not seem
applicable to the other lunar phases. Gemini was the constellation to which Dante
supposed himself transported when he visited the stellar heavens.2 He says he was born under the influence of this " sign."
Cancer, the Crab, is the next sign of the Zodiac.
In the Greek mythology it was supposed to have been placed in the sky by Juno to commemorate the crab which pinched the toes of Hercules in the Lernsean marsh. The Greek name was rvftL.
According to Dupuis it represents the 12th
" labour of Hercules " his capture of the golden
apples in the Garden of the Hesperides, which
were guarded by a Dragon. This Dragon is Draco, which was also called Custos Hesperidum.3 But the connection between a crab and the myth of the golden apples is not obvious unless some
reference to " crab apples " is intended ! Among the Romans, Cancer was consecrated to Mercury, and by the ancient Egyptians to their god Anubis. The well-known cluster in Cancer called the
1 Primitive Constellations, vol. i. p. 292. 2 Paradiso, xxii. 111. 3 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. iv. p. 493.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 259
P_raesape, Al-Sufi says, is " a little spot which resembles a cloud, and is surrounded by four stars, two to the west [77 and 6 Cancri] and two to
the east "
[y and 8]. This cluster is mentioned by
Aratus, who calls it the "Manger." The word Praesape is often translated " Beehive," but there can be no doubt that it really means " Manger," referring to the stars y and 8 Cancri, which the ancients called Aselli, the ass's colts. These were
supposed to represent the asses which in the war
of Jupiter against the Giants helped his victory by their braying ! Admiral Smyth says in his Bedford Catalogue (p. 202) that he found y and 8 Cancri both of 4th
magnitude ; but the photometric measures show that 8 is now distinctly brighter than y. An occultation of 8 Cancri by the moon is recorded as
having occurred on September 3, B.C. 240.
The fine constellation Leo, the Lion, is the next
" sign " of the Zodiac, and is marked by the well
known "Sickle." According to Dupuis, it represents the first " labour of Hercules " the killing of the Nemselian lion. Manilius called it Nemaeus.
It was also called Janonus sidus, Bacchi sidus,
etc. The Greek name was ^xtp, pfX V> or A^X *In ancient Egypt, Leo was sacred to Osiris, and many of the Egyptian monuments are ornamented with lions' heads. It is stated in the Horapolla
that its appearance was supposed to announce the annual rising of the Nile.



260 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Regulus (a Leonis) is the brightest and moat
southern of the stars in the " Sickle." Al-Sufi
says " it is situated in the heart and is of the 1st
magnitude. It is that which is called al-maliki, the royal star. It is marked on the astrolabe as
kalb al-asad, the Heart of the Lion " (whence the name Cor Leonis). Modern photometric measures
make it about 1'3 magnitude. It has an 8^ magnitude companion at about 177" distance
(Burnham) which is moving through space with the bright star, and is therefore at probably the same distance from the earth as its brilliant
primary. This companion is double (8*5, 12'5 : 3"'05, Burnham). The spectroscope shows that
Regulus is approaching the earth at the rate of
5J miles a second. Its parallax is very small about 0"'022, according to Dr. Elkin which indicates that it is at a vast distance from the
earth ; and its brightness shows that it must be a
sun of enormous size. Ptolemy called it /foo-iAto-Kos, whence its Latin name Regulus, first used by Copernicus as the diminutive of rex. 1
The next constellation of the Zodiac is Virgo,
the Virgin. It was also called by the ancients
Ceres, Isis, Erigone, Fortuna, Concorda, Astrsea, and Themis. The Greek name was <a/xeVo>#. Ceres was the goddess of the harvest. Brown thinks
that it probably represents the ancient goddess Istar, and also Ashtoreth. According to Prof.
1 Bedford Catalogue, p. 225.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 261
Sayce it is the same as the Accadiaii sign of " the errand of Istar, a name due to the belief that it was in August that the goddess Astarte descended into Hades in search of her betrothed, the sun god Tammuz, or Adonis, who had been slain by the boar's tusk." l The ear of corn (Spica) is
found on the ancient Egyptian monuments, and
is supposed to represent the fertility caused by the annual rising of the Nile. According to
Aratus, the Virgin lived on earth during the golden age under the name of Justice, but that in the bronze age she left the earth and took up her abode in the heavens.
" Justice, loathing that race of men, Winged her flight to heaven."
The Sphinx near the Great Pyramid has the
head of a virgin on the body of a lion, representing the goddess Isis (Virgo) and her husband
Osiris (Leo). Al-Sufi's 5th star of Virgo is Flamsteed 63
Virginis. Al-Sufi says it is a double star of the
5th magnitude. In Al-Sufi's time it formed a
" naked-eye double " with 61 Virginis, but owing to large proper motion, 61 has now moved about 26 minutes of arc towards the south, and no
longer forms a double with 63. This interesting fact was first pointed out by Flammarion in his work Les EMles (p. 373).

262 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Libra, the Balance, is one of the " signs " of the Zodiac, but originally formed the claws of the Scorpion. It was called Juguna by Cicero, and Mochos by Ampelius. The Greek name was
<f>apiJ,ovO. Virgil suggests that it represented the justice of the emperor Augustus, honoured by the name of a constellation; but probably this refers to the birth of Augustus under the sign of
Libra, as Scaliger has pointed out. According to Brown, "the daily seizing of the dying western sun by the claws of the Scorpion of darkness is
reduplicated annually at the Autumnal Equinox, when the feeble waning sun of shortening days falls ever earlier into his enemy's grasp ;
" l and
he says, " The Balance or Scales (Libra), which it will be observed is in itself neither diurnal nor
nocturnal, is the only one of the zodiacal signs
not Euphratean in origin, having been imported
from Egypt and representing originally the balance of the sun at the horizon between the upper and under worlds ; and secondarily the
equality of the days and nights at the equinox." 2 According to Houzeau, Libra was formed at the
beginning of the second century B.C., and it does not appear in any writings before those of Geminus and Varron.3

THE CONSTELLATIONS 263
Milton says in Paradise Lost :
" The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray, Hung forth in heaven his golden scales, yet seen Betwixt Astrsea and the Scorpion's sign."
(Here Astraea is Virgo.) It is worth noticing that both Ptolemy and Al-Sufi rated the star K Librae as two magnitudes
brighter than A. Librae. The two stars are now
practically of equal brightness (5th magnitude), and it seems impossible to believe that this could
have been the case in Al-Sufi's time. Surely a careful observer like Al-Sufi, who estimated the
relative brightness of stars to a third of a
magnitude, could not possibly have made an error
of two magnitudes in the brightness of two stars near each other! It should be stated, however, that K Librae was rated 5th magnitude by
Argelander and Heis, and A, 6th magnitude by the same excellent observers.
The next "sign" of the Zodiac, Scorpion, was consecrated by the Romans to Mars, and by the
Egyptians to Typhon. 1 It was called Nepa by Cicero, Martis sidus by Manilius, and Fera magna by Aratus. The Greek name was Tra^oov. Mr. E. B. Knobel has called attention to a curious remark of Ptolemy with reference to the bright star Antares (a Scorpii), " Media earum quae tendit ad rapinam quae dicitur Cor Scor
pionis "
; and he made a similar remark with
1 Lalande'a Astronomie, vol. i. p. 296.



264 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
reference to Betelgeuse (a Orionis) and others. But Mr. Robert Brown 1 explains the remark by the fact that in ancient times these stars rose in the morning at a time when caravans were ex
posed to dangers from robbers. Thus the term had nothing to do with the aspect or colour of these stars, but was merely a reference to their
supposed astrological influence on human affairs.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Silkit was a goddess who assumed the form of a scorpion in
the sky. She was supposed to be the daughter of Ra.
With reference to stars " outside " the ancient
figure of Scorpio, the first, Al-Sufi says, " is a star
which immediately follows al-schaulat " [A] and K,
" it is of small 4th magnitude ; Ptolemy calls it
i/e^eAoa'Sr/s
" [nebulous], Schjelerup, in his translation of Al-Sufi's work, does not identify this
object; but it is very evidently y Telescopii, which lies exactly in the position described by
Al-Sufi. Now, it is a very interesting and curious fact that Ptolemy called it nebulous, for in the same telescopic field with it is the nebula h 3705
(= Dunlop 557). Dunlop describes it as a " small well-defined rather bright nebula, about 20" in
diameter; a very small star precedes it, but is not involved; following y Telescopii." Sir John Herschel at the Cape found it fairly resolved into
very faint stars, and adds, " The whole ground
1 Primitive Constellations, vol. i. p. 74.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 265
of the heavens, for an immense extent is thickly
sown with such stars. A beautiful object." l This perhaps accounts for the nebulous appearance of the star as seen by Ptolemy. Several novce or temporary stars are recorded
as having appeared in Scorpio. One in the year B.C. 134 is stated by Pliny to have induced
Hipparchus to form his catalogue of stars. This star was also observed in China. Its exact position is unknown, but Flammarion thinks it may possibly have appeared about 4 north of the star ft Scorpii. Another new star is said to have
appeared in A.D. 393, somewhere in the Scorpion's tail. One in A.D. 1203 and another in 1584 are
also mentioned, the latter near ir Scorpii.
The constellation Scorpio seems to be referred
to by Dante in his Purgatorio (ix. 4-6) in the lines
" De gemma la sua fronte era lucenta Poste in figura del fredda animale Che con la coda percota la genta,"
perhaps suggested by Ovid's remark
" Soorpius exhibit caudaque menabitur unca." 2
Next to Scorpio comes Sagittarius, the Archer. It is said to have been placed in the sky as a symbol of Hercules, a hero who was held in the greatest veneration by the ancient Egyptians.

266 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
The horse, usually associated with this constella
tion, was a symbol of war. It was also called
by the ancients Chiron, Arciteiiens, Minotaurus,
Croton, etc. The Greek name was Trawi, or Tracovt. Chiron was supposed to be the son of Saturn and
Phillyra, and first taught men to ride on horses. The name is derived from the Greek x t/P> a hand. Some writers, however, think that Chiron is
represented by the constellation of the Centaur,
and others say that Sagittarius represents the Minotaur loved by Persephone. According to Dupuis, Sagittarius represents the 5th "labour of Hercules," which consisted in hunting the birds of the lake Stymphalus, which ravaged the neighbouring countries. These birds are perhaps
represented by Cygnus, Altair, and the Vulture (Lyra). The Lyre probably represents the musical instrument which Hercules used to
frighten the birds. 1
According to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called the
stars 7, 8, c, and rj Sagittarii which form a quadrilateral figure, "the Ostrich which goes to the
watering place," because they compared the Milky Way to a river. They compared the stars o-, <, T, and Sagittarii, which form another quadrilateral, to an ostrich which has drunk and returns from the " watering place." He says that the star A Sagittarii forms with these two "ostriches" a
tent, and certainly the figure formed by A, <, , e,
1 Lalande's A&tronomie, vol. iv. p. 487.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 267
and 8 is not unlike a tent. Al-Sufi says more
about these " ostriches "
; but the ideas of the old Arabians about the stars seem very fanciful.
A " temporary star " is recorded in the Chinese Annals of Ma-touan-lin as having appeared in
May, B.C. 48, about 4 distant from /x Sagittarii. Another in the year 1011 A.D. appeared near the
quadrilateral figure formed by the stars <r, T, , and <f> Sagittarii. This may perhaps be identified with the object referred to by Hepidannus in the
year 1012, which was of extraordinary brilliancy, and remained visible "in the southern part of the heavens during three months." Another is mentioned near the same place in A.D. 386 (April to
July).1 The number of " temporary stars " recorded in this part of the heavens is very remarkable.
According to Brown, Sagittarius is depicted on a stone, cir. B.C. 1100, found at Babilu, and now in the British Museum.2
The next of the "signs of the Zodiac" is Capricornus, the Goat. In the Arabo- Latin edition
of Ptolemy's Almagest it is called Alcaucurus. It
is supposed to represent Amalthea, the goat which nursed Jupiter. According to Dupuis it represented the 6th " labour of Hercules," which was the cleaning out of the Augean stables.3 a.2 Capricorni is the northern of two stars of the
1 Monthly Notices, R.A.S., April 14, 1848. - Prim. Co7ist., vol. ii. p. 45. 3 Lalande's Astronomic, pp, 472-3.



268 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
4th magnitude (a and ft Capricorni). It really consists of two stars visible to the naked eye. The second of these two stars (c^) is not mentioned
by Al-Sufi, but I find that, owing to proper motion, they were nearer together in his time
(tenth century), and were evidently seen by him as one star, ft Capricorni (about 3rd magnitude) is a very wide double star (3J, 6 ; 205"), which may be seen with any small telescope. The fainter star was found to be a close double by
Burnham. At present ft is brighter than a, although rated of the same brightness by Al-Sufi.
Aquarius is the next " sign of the Zodiac." It
is supposed to represent a man pouring water out of an urn or bucket. Other names given to this
constellation were Aristaeus, Ganymede, Cecrops, Amphora, Uriia, and Aqua tyrannus. According to Dupuis it represents the 7th "labour of Hercules," which was his victory over the famous bull which ravaged Crete. 1 But the connection between a bull and a bucket is not obvious.
Aquarius is represented in several places on the Egyptian monuments. Some of the ancient poets
supposed that it represented Deucalion (the Noah of the Greek story of the Deluge) ; others thought
that it represented Cecrops, who came to Greece
from Egypt, built Athens, and was also called
Bifornis. Others say that he was Ganymede, the
cup-bearer of the gods.
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. iv. p. 485,



THE CONSTELLATIONS 269
There is some difficulty about the identification
of some of Al-Sufi's stars in Aquarius. His sixth
star (Fl. 7) is nearly 10 south-west of ft Aquarii, and is, Al-Sufi says, " the following of three stars
in the left hand, and precedes the fourth [/?]
... it is of the 6th magnitude. Ptolemy calls it
third, but in reality it is very faint " [now about 6th magnitude]. The seventh [//,] is the middle one of the three and about 4J magnitude, although
Al-Sufi calls it "small fifth " [Ptolemy rated it 4].
The eighth star, e, is the preceding of the three
and about 3*8, agreeing closely with Al-Sufi's 4*3. Ptolemy rated it 3. This star is mentioned under the name nou in the time of Tcheou-Kong in the twelfth century B.C. Al-Sufi says, " These three stars are followed by a star of the 5th magnitude which Ptolemy has not mentioned. It
is brighter than the sixth star" [Fl. 7], This
is evidently v Aquarii. If, however, we plot Ptolemy's positions as given by Al-Sufi, it seems probable that Ptolemy's sixth star was really v, and that either /u, or Fl. 7 was not seen by him.
As Ptolemy called his seventh star 4th magni
tude, and his sixth and eighth stars 3rd magnitude, some considerable change of brightness seems to
have taken place in these stars ; as v is now only
4J and Fl. 7 only a bright sixth. Variation was
suspected in Fl. 7 l by Gould. I found it very

reddish with binocular in October, 1892. Burnham
found it to be a close double star, the companion
being about 12th magnitude at a distance of only
2". It is probably a binary. According to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called the second and third stars of the figure (a and o Aquarii) sad al-malik (malk or mulfc), " the Good Fortune of the king." They called the fourth and fifth stars
(ft and Aquarii) with the twenty-eighth star of Capricornus (c) sad al-sund, " the Good Fortune of the Happy Events/' " This is the 24th mansion of the moon." These stars rose at the time of year when the cold ends, and they set at the time the heat ends. Hence, Al-Sufi says, " when they rise the
rains begin, and when they set the unhealthy winds
cease, fertility abounds, and the dew falls." Hence probably the Arabic names. This, of course, applies to the climate of Persia and Arabia, and not to the British Isles. Al-Sufi says, " They call the 6th, 7th, and 8th stars sad bula, ' The Good Fortune which swallows up !
' This is the 23rd mansion of the moon. They say that it is so called because that at the time of the Deluge it rose at the moment when God said, * O earth !
absorb the waters ' (Koran, chap, xi., v. 46). They called the stars y, TT, , and 17 Aquarii sad alachbija, ( the Good Fortune of the tents '
; this is the 25th mansion of the moon, and they give them this name because of these four stars, three form a triangle, the fourth [] being in the



THE CONSTELLATIONS 271
middle." The three were considered to form a tent.
The Arabians called the bright star Fomalhaut "in the mouth of the southern fish al-dhifda
al~auval, the first Frog,' as the bright one on the
southern point of the tail of Kitus [Cetus] is called
al-dhifda al-tsani [ft Ceti], * the second Frog.' " Fomalhaut was also called al-zhalim, "the male ostrich."
Al-Sufi says, " Some of the Arabians state that a ship is situated to the south of Aquarius." The stars in the Southern Fish (Piscis Australis) seem to be here referred to.
The constellation Pisces, the Fishes, is the last of the " signs of the Zodiac." The Fishes appear on an ancient Greek obelisk described by Pococke. Among the Greeks this sign was consecrated to Venus ; and in Egypt to Nepthys, wife of Typhon and goddess of the sea. Pisces is said to end the Zodiac as the Mediterranean Sea terminated Egypt.
This idea was suggested by Schmidt, who also
conjectured that the Ram (Aries) was placed at the beginning of the Zodiac because Thebes, a town sacred to Jupiter t Ammon, was at the beginning of Egypt in ancient times ; and he thought
that the constellation Triangulum, the Triangle,
represented the Nile Delta, Eridanus being the Nile.1 The constellation was represented in
ancient times by two fishes connected by a cord
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. i. p. 247.



272 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
tied to their tails. The southern of these " fishes "
lies south of the " Square of Pegasus," and the northern between Andromeda and Aries. Accord
ing to Manilius, the origin of these fishes is as
follows : Venus, seeing Typhon on the banks of
the river Euphrates, cast herself with her son into the river and they were transformed into fishes ! Some of the Arabians substituted a swallow for the northern of the two fishes the one below Andromeda. The swallow was a symbol of
Spring. According to Dupuis, Pisces represents the 8th "labour of Hercules," his triumph over the mares of Diomed which emitted fire from their nostrils.1 But the connection between fishes and mares is not obvious, and some of Dupuis' ideas seem very fanciful. Here he seems to have found
a " mare's nest."
The constellation Cetus, the Whale, represents, according to ancient writers, the sea monster sent by Neptune to devour Andromeda when she was chained to the rock. Aratus calls Cetus the " dusky monster," and Brown remarks that " the
* Dusky Star ' would be peculiarly appropriate to Mira (the wondrous o Ceti)." 2 Cetus was also called Canis Tritonis, or Dog of the Sea, Bayer in his Atlas (1603) shows a dragon instead of a whale,
finding it so represented on some ancient spheres.
Al-Sufi calls it Kitus or K^TOS, the whale. He says,
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. iv. p. 489. 2 Primitive Constellations, vol. i. p. 91.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 273
"it "is" represented by the figure of a marine animal, of which the fore part is turned towards the east, to the south of the Ram, and the hinder part towards the west behind the three ' extern '
stars of Aquarius." Al-Sufi does not mention the variable star
o Ceti, now called Mira, or the " wonderful," nor does he refer to any star in its immediate vicinity.
We may, therefore, conclude that it was near a minimum of light at the time of his observation of the stars of Cetus.
The constellation of Orion, one of the finest in
the heavens, was called by Al-Sufi al-djabbar, " the
Giant," and also al-djauza, " the Spouse." The poet Longfellow says
" Sirius was rising in the east
And, slow ascending one by one,
The kindling constellations shone Begirt with many a blazing star Stood the great giant Al-gebar Orion, hunter of the beast ! His sword hung gleaming at his side
And on his arm, the lion's hide Scattered across the midnight air The golden radiance of its hair."
Al-Sufi says it " is represented by the figure of a standing man, to the south of the sun's path. This constellation very much resembles a human figure with a head and two shoulders. It is called
al-djabbar, ' the Giant,' because it has two thrones, holds a club in his hand, and is girded with a sword." Orion is supposed to have been a son of T



274 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Neptune ; but there are many stories of the origin of the name. It is also said to be derived from the Greek word wpa, because the constellation was used to mark the different times of the year.
According to the ancient fable, Orion was killed by a scorpion, and was placed in the sky at the request of Diana. According to Houzeau, the name comes from oriri, to be bom. Scorpio rises when Orion sets, and he thinks that the idea of the ancients was that the Scorpion in this way
kills the giant Orion. In ancient Egypt Orion was called Sahu. This name occurs on the monuments of the Ptolemies, and also on those of the Pharaohs. It is also mentioned in the Book of the Dead. It seems to have been considered of great importance in
ancient Elgypt, as its heliacal rising announced that of Sirius, which heralded the annual rising
of the Nile.
The constellation Eridanus lies south of Taurus, east of Cetus, and west of Lepus. In ancient times it was supposed to represent the Nile or the
Po. Ptolemy merely calls it liora^ov do-Tcpwr/ios, or asterism of the river. It was called Eridanus by the Greeks, and Pluvius by the Romans. It appears to correspond with the Hebrew Shicor.
Al-Sufi calls it al-nahr, " the River."
One of the most interesting points in Al-Sufi' s
most interesting work is the identity of the bright star known to the ancient astronomers as



THE CONSTELLATIONS 275
aohir al-nahr, " the End of the River," and called
by Ptolemy 'Eo^a-ros roO Trora/xov, " the Last in the River." Some astronomers have identified this
star with a Eridani (Achernar), a bright southern star of the 1st magnitude, south of Eridanus.
But Al-Sufi's description shows clearly that the star he refers to is really Eridani; and the
reader will find it interesting to follow his description with a star map before him. Describing
Ptolemy's 34th star of Eridanus (the star in
question), he says, " the 34th star is found before
[that is west of] these three stars [the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd, which are v2
, Du, and v' in Proctor's Atlas], the distance between it and that of the three which is nearest being about 4 cubits [9 20'].
It is of the first magnitude; it is that which is marked on the southern astrolabe, and called twhir al-nahr, ' the End of the River.' There are
before this bright one two stars, one to the south, [s Eridani, not shown in Proctor's small Atlas], the other to the north [t Eridani] ; Ptolemy does not mention these. One of these stars is of the 4th magnitude, the other of the 5th. There is
behind the same [that is, east of it] a star of the 4th magnitude distant from it two cubits [c Eridani]. To the south of the three stars which follow the bright one there are some stars of the
4th and 5th magnitudes, which he [Ptolemy] has not mentioned."
Now, a glance at a star map of this region will



276 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
show clearly that the bright star referred to by
Al-Sufi is undoubtedly Eridani, which is there
fore the star known to the ancients as the " End of the River," or the " Last in the River."
The position given by Ptolemy agrees fairly well with Al-Sufi' s description, although the place
is slightly erroneous, as is also the case with
Fomalhaut and ft Ceiitauri. It is impossible to suppose that either Ptolemy or Al-Sufi could have seen a Eridani, as it is too far south to be
visible from their stations, and, owing to the
precession of the equinoxes, the star was still further south in ancient times. Al-Sufi says
distinctly that the distance between Ptolemy's
33rd star (which is undoubtedly h Eridani, or
Proctor's v) and the 34th star was " 4 cubits," or 9 20'. The actual distance is about 9 11', so
that Al-Sufi's estimate was practically correct.
Halley, in his Catalogus Stellarium Australium, identifies Ptolemy's star with 6 Eridani, and Baily agreed with him.1 Ulugh Beigh also identifies the "Last in the River" with 6 Eridani. The Arabic observer Mohammed AH Achsasi, who observed in the seventeenth century, called Eri
dani Achr al-nahr, and rated it first magnitude.2 To argue, as Bode and Flammarion have done, that Ptolemy and Al-Sufi may have heard of a Eridani from travellers in the southern
1 Memoirs, R.A.S., vol. xiii. 61. 2 Monthly Notices, R.A.S., June, 1895.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 277
hemisphere, is to beg the whole question at issue. This is especially true with reference to Al-Sufi,
who says, in the preface to his work, that he has described the stars " as seen with my own eyes." a Eridani is over 11 "cubits" from h Eridani
instead of " 4 cubits " as Al-Sufi says. This shows
conclusively that the star seen by Al-Sufi was
certainly not a Eridani. The interest of the
identification is that Al-Sufi rated 6 Eridani of
the first magnitude, whereas it is now only 3rd magnitude ! It was measured 3*06 at Harvard
and estimated 3*4 by Stanley Williams, so that it
has evidently diminished greatly in brightness since Al-Sufi' s time. There is an interesting
paper on this subject by Dr. Anderson (the discoverer of Nova AurigaB and Nova Persei) in Knowledge for July, 1893, in which he states that
the " Last in the River," according to the statements of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, did rise above their horizon at a certain time of the year, which a Eridani could not possibly have done. This seems sufficient to settle the question in favour
of 6 Eridani. Dr. Anderson says, " It is much to
be regretted that Professor Schjellerup, the able and industrious translator of Sufi, has allowed
this to escape his notice, and helped in the preface and note to his work to propagate the delusion that a Eridani is Ptolemy's ' Last in the River ' "
;
and in this opinion I fully concur. Al-Sufi's clear
account places it beyond a doubt that the star



278 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
known to Hipparchus, Ptolemy, Al-Sufi, and Ulugh Beigh as the "Last in the River" was Eridani. must have diminished greatly in
brightness since Al-Sufi's time, for in ranking it as 1st magnitude he placed it in a very select list. He only rated thirteen stars in the whole
heavens as being of the 1st magnitude. These
are : Arcturus, Vega, Capella, Aldebaran, Regulus,
/3 Leonis, Fomalhaut, Rigel, 6 Eridani, Sirius, Procyon, Canopus, and a Centauri. All these stars were actually seen by Al-Sufi, and described from his own observations. He does not mention a Eridani, as it was not visible from his station in
Persia.
6 Eridani is a splendid double star (3'40, 4'49 :
8"'38, 1902, Tebbutt). I found the components white and light yellow with 3-inch refractor in the Punjab. Dr. Gould thinks that one of the
components is variable to some extent. This is
interesting, considering the brilliancy of the star in Al-Sufi's time. The brighter component was
found to be a spectroscopic binary by Wright, so that on the whole the star is a most interesting
object. The small constellation Lepus, the Hare, lies
south of Orion. Pliny calls it Dasypus, and Virgil
Auritus. In ancient Egypt it was the symbol of
vigilance, prudence, fear, solitude, and speed.1 It
may perhaps represent the hare hunted by Orion ;
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. i. p. 274.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 279
but some say it was placed in the sky to commemorate a terrible plague of hares which
occurred in Sicily in ancient times.
A
little north-west of the star p. Leporis is Hind's " crimson star" (R.A. 4h 53m
, S. 11 57', 1900) described by him as " of the most intense crimson,
resembling a blood drop on the background of the sky; as regards depth of colour, no other star visible in these latitudes could be compared with it." It is variable from about the 6th to the 8th magnitude, with a period of about 436 days from maximum to maximum.
The constellation Canis Major, the Great Dog,
is remarkable for containing Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens. In the Greek mythology
it was supposed to represent a dog given by Aurora to Cephalus as the swiftest of all dogs.
Cephalus wished to match it against a fox
which he thought surpassed all animals for speed. They both ran ;for so long a time, so the story goes, that Jupiter rewarded the dog by placing it among the stars. But probably the dog comes
from Anubis, the dog-headed god of the ancient Egyptians. According to Brown, Theogirius (B.C. 544) refers to the constellation of the Dog.1 He
thinks that Canis Major is probably "a reduplication" of Orion; Sirius and ft Canis Majoris corresponding to a and y Orionis ; 8, 22, and c Cards
Majoris to the stars in Orion's belt (8, , and
1 Primitive Constellation*, vol. i. p. 143.



280 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Orionis) ; and -rj and K Canis Majoris with K and
ft Orionis. 1 The Arabic name of Sirius was al-schira, which
might easily be corrupted into Sirius. The Hebrew name was Sihor. According to Plutarch, the Ethiopians paid regal honours to the Celestial
Dog. The Romans vised to sacrifice a dog in its
honour at the fetes called Robigalia, which were held on the seventh day before the Calends of
May, and nine days after the entry of the sun
into Taurus. Pliny says, "Hoc tempus Varro determinat sole decimam partem Tauri obtinenti
quod canis occidit, sidus per se vehemens," etc.'2 Owing to some remarks of Cicero, Horace, and Seneca, it has been supposed that in ancient times
Sirius was of red colour. Seneca says, "Nee mirum est, si terra omnis generis et varia evaporatio est; quam in coelo quoque 11011 unus
appareat color rerum, sed acrior sit Caiiiculse
rubor, Nartis remissior, Jovis nullus, in lucem puram nitore perducto." 3 It is now brilliantly white with a bluish tinge. But this change of colour is somewhat doubtful. The remarks of
the ancient writers may possibly refer to its great brilliancy rather than its colour. Al-Sufi
says nothing about its colour, and it was probably

3 Queest. Nat., Lib. 1, Cap. I. 6; quoted by Dr. See. " Cani
cula" is Sirius, and " Nartis," Mars.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 281
a white star in his time. If it were red in his day he would most probably have mentioned the fact, as he does in the case of several red stars.
Brown, however, quotes the folloAving from Ibn Alraqqa, an Arabian observer :
"I recognize Sirius shining red, whilst the morning is becoming white.
The night fading away, has risen and left him, The night is not afraid to lose him, since he follows her."
Schjellerup thinks that it is very doubtful that
Sirius was really red as seen by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. But in an exhaustive inquiry made by
Dr. See on the supposed change of colour,1 he comes to the conclusion that Sirius was really red
in ancient times. Seneca states distinctly that it was redder than Mars (see extract above), and other ancient writers refer to its red colour. It has been generally supposed that the Arabian astronomer Alfraganus, in his translation of
Ptolemy's Almagest, refers to only five red stars observed by Ptolemy, namely, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Betelgeuse, Antares,, and Pollux. But Dr. See shows that this idea is due to a mistranslation of Alfraganus by Plato Tibertinus in 1537, and that Ptolemy did not speak of "five red stars," but five nebulous stars, as stated by Christmann and
Golius. Ptolemy described Sirius as vVoVippo?,
"fiery red," the same word used with reference to the other stars mentioned above. The change
1 Astronomy and Jttfap&jftfar, vol. 11, 1892.



282 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
of colour, if any, probably took place before Al-Sufi's time. Dr. See says
"Prof. Newcomb rejects the former wellauthenticated redness of Sirius, because he
cannot explain the fact. But the ink was
scarcely dry on his new book on the stars, in
which he takes this position, when Nova Persei
blazed forth in 1901 ; and observers saw it change
colour from day to day and week to Aveek. Could
any one explain the cause of these numerous and
conspicuous changes of colour? Shall we, then,
deny the changes of colour in Nova Persei, some
of which were noticed when it was nearly as
bright as Sirius?" 1
On the ceiling of the Memnonium at Thebes the
heliacal rising of Sirius is represented under the form and name of Isis. The coincidence of this rising with the annual rising of the Nile is mentioned by Tibullus and Aclian. About 4000 B.C.
the heliacal rising of Sirius coincided with the
summer solstice (about June 21) and the beginning of the rising of the Nile. The festival in honour of this event was held by the Egyptians
about July 20, and this marked the beginning of the sacred Egyptian year. On the summit of Mount Pelion in Thessaly there was a temple dedicated to Zeus, where sacrifices were offered at the rising of Sirius by men of rank who were chosen for the purpose by the priests and wore
fresh sheepskins.

THE CONSTELLATIONS 283
Sirius seems to have been worshipped by the ancient Egyptians under the name of Sothis, and
it was regarded as the star of Isis and Osiris. The last name without the initial O very much resembles our modern name.
According to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called Sirius
al-schira al-abur, " Sirius which has passed across," also al-schira al Jamdnija, " the Sirius of Yemen."
He says it is called al-abtir, " because it has passed across the Milky Way into the southern region."
He relates a mythological story why Sirius " fled towards the south" and passed across the Milky Way towards Suhail (Canopus). The same story
is told by Albufaragius l (thirteenth century). (The story was probably derived from Al-Sufi.) Now, it seems to me a curious and interesting fact that the large proper motion of Sirius would have carried it across the Milky Way from the eastern to the western border in a period of
60,000 years. Possibly the Arabian story may be based on a tradition of Sirius having been seen
on the opposite, or eastern, side of the Milky Way
by the men of the early Stone Age. However this may be, we know from the amount and direction of the star's proper motion that it must have passed across the Milky Way from east to west within the period above stated. The Arabic
name al-abrtr is not, therefore, a merely fanciful
1 Houzeau, Bibliographie Generate de VAstronomic, vol. i., Introduction, p. 129.



284 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
one, but denotes an actual fact. The proper motion of Sirius could not possibly have been
known to the ancients, as it was only revealed by accurate modern observations.
The little constellation Cams Minor, the Little Dog, lies south of Gemini and Cancer. Small as
it is, it was one of the original forty-eight con
stellations of Ptolemy. In the Greek mythology it was supposed to represent either one of Diana's hunting dogs, or one of Orion's hounds. Ovid calls
it the dog of Icarus. Others say it was the
dog of Helen, who was carried off by Paris.
According to the old poets, Orion's dog, or the dog of Icarus, threw himself into a well after seeing
his master perish. The name Fovea, given to the constellation by Bayer, signifies a pit where corn was deposited. This comes from the fact that
the rising of the star Procyoii (a Canis Minoris) indicated the season of abundance. But Lalande
thought it more probable that the idea of a pit came from the Greek o-etpos, which means a corn store, and that it was confounded with Sirius.
The name of the bright star Procyon (a Canis Minoris) is derived from the Greek TrpoKtW, " the
advanced day," because it appeared in the morning
sky before Sirius. Procyon was called by the Hindoos Hanouman after their famous monkey god, from whose tail a bridge is said to have been formed to enable the army of Rama to pass from
India to Ceylon. Al-Sufi says that the star was



THE CONSTELLATIONS 285
marked on the old astrolabes as al-schira al
schamia, " the Syrian Sirius." It was also called,
he says, al-schira al-gumaisa, " the Sirius with
blear eyes"(!) from weeping because Sirius had
passed across the Milky Way, Procyon remaining on the eastern side. Here we have the same
legend again. The proper motion of Procyon (about the same in amount and direction as that of Sirius) shows that the star has been on the eastern side of the Milky Way for many ages
past. About 60,000 years hence, Procyon wrill be near the star Canis Majoris, and will then like
Sirius have passed across the Milky Way.
Argo, the Ship, is a large constellation south of
Hydra, Monoceros, and Canis Major. It is called by Al-Sufi al-safina, " the Ship." It is supposed to represent the first ship ever built. The name is derived from the builder Argo, or from the Greek
word 'Apyos. This ship is said to have been built
in Thessaly by order of Minerva and Neptune, to
go on the expedition for the conquest of the golden fleece. The date of this expedition, com
manded by Jason, is usually fixed at 1300 or 1400 B.C. With reference to the position of
this supposed ship in the sky, Proctor says, " It is noteworthy that when we make due
correction for the effects of precession during the
past 4000 years, the old constellation Argo is
set on an even keel, instead of being tilted
some 45 to the horizon, as at present when



286 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
due south." He connects Argo with Noah's Ark.
The brightest "star of Argo is Canopus, called Suha'il by Al-Sufi. It is the second brightest starin the heavens ; but it is not visible in northern latitudes. The Harvard photometric measures make
it nearly one magnitude brighter than the zero magnitude, about two magnitudes brighter than Aldebaran, and about half the brightness of Sirius.
This fine star has been suspected of variable light.
Webb says, "It was thought (1861) in Chili brighter than Sirius." Observing it in the
Punjab, the present writer found it on several occasions but little inferior to Sirius, although very low on the southern horizon. From recent observations by Mr. H. C. McKay in Australia, he believes that it is variable to the extent of at least
half a magnitude.1 But it is difficult to establish
variations of light in very bright stars. The
parallax of Canopus is very small, so its distance from the .earth is very great, and it must be a sun
of gigantic size. According to Al-Fargani, Canopus was called the star of St. Catherine by the
Christian pilgrims in the tenth century,
a It
was called Suhail by the old Arabians, a name
apparently derived from the root sahl, " a plain "
;
and Schjellerup suggests that the name was probably applied to this and some other southern
1 English Mechanic, March 25, 1904, p. 145. 2 Humboldt's Cosmos, vol. iii. p. 185, footnote (Otte's translation).



THE CONSTELLATIONS 287
stars because they seem to move along a plain near the southern horizon. Al-Sufi says that he measured the latitude of Schiraz in Persia, where he observed, and found it to be 29 36' ; and hence
for that place Canopus, when on the meridian, had an altitude of about 9. Canopus was the ancient name of Aboukir in Egypt, and is said to have derived its name from the pilot of Menelaus, whose name was Kanobus, and who died there from the bite of a snake. The star is supposed to have
been named after him, and it was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. Al-Sufi does not mention the famous variable
star 77 ArgCis, which, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, he might possibly have seen close to the horizon, if it had been a bright star in his day. It lies between <j> Velorum and a Crucis. Both of these stars are mentioned by Al-Sufi, but
he says nothing of any bright star (or indeed any star) between them. This negative evidence tends to show that i; Argus was not visible to the naked
eye in Al-Sufi's time. This extraordinary star has in modern times varied through all degrees
of brightness from Sirius down to the 8th magni
tude I Schonfeld thought that a regular period is
very improbable. It seems to be a sort of connecting link between the long period variables and the
novce or temporary stars. It is reddish in colour,
and the spectrum of its light is very similar to
that of the temporary stars. Whether it will



288 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
ever become a brilliant object again, time alone
can tell ; but from the fact that it was presumably faint in Al-Sufi's time, and afterwards increased
to the brightness of Sirius, it seems possible that its light may again revive. The long constellation Hydra lies south of
Cancer, Leo, Crater, Corvus, Virgo, and Libra. It was also called Asina, Coluber, Anguis, Sublimatus, etc. In the Greek mythology it was
supposed to represent the Lernsean serpent killed by Hercules. According to Ovid, who fixed its
acroiiycal rising for February 14, it had a common origin with Corvus and Crater. Apollo, wishing to sacrifice to Jupiter, sent the Crow with a cup to fetch water. On his way to the well the Crow stopped at a fig tree and waited for the fruit to
ripen I Afterwards, to excuse his delay, he said that a serpent had prevented him from drawing the water. But 'Apollo, to punish the Crow for
his deception, changed his plumage from white to black, and ordered the serpent to prevent the Crow from drinking.1 Hydra WSLS called by Al
Sufi al-schudja, " the Serpent, or Hydra." He says
that " it contains twenty-five stars in the figure and two ' outside,' and its head is to the south of the southern scale of the Balance" (a Librse). But this is clearly a mistake (one of the very few
errors to be found in Al-Sufi's work), for he goes on
to say that the head is composed of four stars
1 Lalande's Astronomic, vol. i. p, 277 4



THE CONSTELLATIONS 289
forming a figure like the head of a horse, and he adds, "This head is in the middle between al-shira al-guniaisa [Procyon] and Kalb al-asad
[Regulus] the Heart, inclining from these two stars a little to the south." This clearly indicates
the stars 8, c, 17, and a- Hydrse which, with
Hydrse, have always been considered as forming the Hydra's head. These stars lie south of a and
/? Cancri, not south of Libra as Al-Sufi says (doubtless by a slip of the pen). Ptolemy's 12th star of Hydra (a Hydrse) is,
Al-Sufi says, " the bright red star which is found at the end of the neck where the back begins ; it is of the 2nd magnitude. It is that which is marked 011 the astrolabe as unk al-schudja, 'the neck
of the serpent,' also al-fard, ' the solitary one.' " Al-Sufi's estimate of its brightness agrees well with modern measures ; but it has been suspected of variable light. Sir John Herschel's estimates
at the Cape of Good Hope varied from 1*75 to 2*58
magnitude. He thought that its apparent variation might be due to its reddish colour, and com
pares it to the case of a Cassiopeise. But as this
latter star is now known to be irregularly variable it seems probable that a Hydrse may be variable
also. Gemmill found it remarkably bright on
May 9, 1883, when he thought it nearly equal to
Pollux (1*2 magnitude). On the other hand, Franks thought it nearer the 3rd than the 2nd
magnitude en March 2, 1878. On April 9, 1884, the
u



290 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
present writer found it only slightly less than
Regains (1'3 magnitude). On April 6, 1886, however, it was considerably less than Regulus, but half a magnitude brighter than ft Canis Minoris, or about 2J magnitude. In the Chinese Annals it is called the " Red Bird." In a list of thirty stars
found on a tablet at Birs-Nimroud, it is called
" The son of the supreme temple." Although to the naked eye deserving the name of Alphard or " the solitary one," it is by no means an isolated star when examined with a telescope. It has a faint and distant companion, observed by Admiral Smyth ; and about 25' to the west of it Ward saw a small double star (8, 13 : 90 : 50"). With a 3-inch
refractor in the Punjab, I saw a small star of about 8J magnitude to the south and a little east
of the bright star, probably identical with Smyth's companion. Farther off in the same direction I saw a fainter star, and others at greater distances
in the field. There is also a faint star a little to the north. I also saw Ward's double with the
3-inch telescope. There is some difficulty in identifying the stars numbered by Ptolemy 13, 14, and 15 in Hydra.
Having plotted a map 'from Ptolemy's positions (as given by Al-Sufi), I have come to the conclu
sion that Ptolemy's stars are 13 = K Hydrae ;
14 = v ; and 15 = A Hydrse, probably. From the clear description given by Al-Sufi of the stars
observed by him, I find that his stars are 13 = v, ;



THE CONSTELLATIONS 291
14 = v.2 ; and 15 = A. Hydras. We must, therefore, conclude that Ptolemy and Al-Sufi saw only three stars where now there are four,1 and that
K HydrsB was not seen, or at least is not men
tioned by Al-Sufi. K is, therefore, probably vari
able. It was rated 4 by Tycho Brahe, Bayer, and
Hevelius; it is at present about 5th magnitude. If Ptolemy did not see v2 it is probably variable
also, and, indeed, it has been suspected of variable
light. 2 The small constellation of Crater, the Cup, lies north of Hydra, and south of Leo and Virgo.
Al-Sufi calls it al-batija, "the Jar, or Cup." He
says the Arabians called it al-malif, " the Crib, or Manger." According to Brown, the stars of Crater exactly form a Bakhiaii KavOapos, with its two handles rising above the two extremities of the circumference.3 An Asia Minor legend " connected Crater with the mixing of human blood with wine
in a bowl." Crater is referred to by Ovid in the
lines
" Dixit et antiqui monumenta perenuia facti Anguis, Avis, Crater sidera, juncta micunt."
The star a Crateris was rated 4th magnitude by

292 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Al-Sufi and all other observers, and the Harvard
measures make it 4*20, a satisfactory agreement. It has three companions noted by Admiral Smyth. One of these he called " intense blood colour."
This is R Crateris, now known to be variable from above the 8th magnitude to below the 9th.
Sir John Herschel called it an " intense scarlet
star, a curious colour." With 3-inch refractor in
the Punjab I found it " full scarlet." It is one of an open pair, the further of the two from a. There is a third star about 9th magnitude a little
south of it. Ward saw a 13th magnitude star
between a and R with a 2f-inch (Wray) refractor.
This I saw " readily " with my 3-inch. Smyth does not mention this faint star, although he
used a much larger telescope. Corvus, the Crow, is a small constellation, north of Hydra. Aratus says "the Crow form seems to peck the fold of the water snake" (Hydra). The victory which Valerius Corvinus is said to have owed to a crow has given it the name of
Pomptina, because the victory took place near
the Pontine marshes.1 A quadrilateral figure is
formed by its four brightest stars, y, S, /?, and e Corvi. This figure has sometimes been mistaken for the Southern Cross by those who are not familiar with the heavens. But the stars of the Southern Cross a re much brighter.
The constellation Ceiitaurus, the Centaur, lies
1 Lalaflde's Astronomic, vol. i. p. 278.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 293
south of Hydra and Libra, and north of the
Southern Cross. According to Dupuis, Centaurus represents the 3rd "labour of Hercules," his triumph over the Centaurs.1 The Centaurs were
supposed to be a people living in the vicinity of
Mount Ossa, who first rode on horses. The con
stellation was also called Semivir, Chiron, Phobos,
Minotaurus, etc. Al-Sufi says it " is represented by the figure of an animal, of which the forepart is the upper part of a man from the head to end of the back, and its hinder part is the hinder part of a horse, from the beginning of the back to the tail. It is to the south of the Balance [Libra] turning its face towards the east, and the hinder part of the beast towards the west."
Al-Sufi describes very clearly the four bright stars of the famous " Southern Cross." Owing to precession these stars were some 7 further north in the tenth century than they are at present, and they could have been all seen by Al-Sufi, when on the meridian. In the time of
Ptolemy and Hipparchus, they were still further north, and about 5000 years ago they were visible in the latitude of London. Dante speaks of these four stars as emblematical of the four cardinal
virtues, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence. Closely south-east of a and /? Crucis is the dark spot in the Milky Way known as the " Coal Sack,'

294 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
which forms such a conspicuous object near the Southern Cross. It was first described by Pinzon
in 1499 ; and afterwards by Lacaille in 1755.
Although to the naked eye apparently black, photographs show that it contains many faint
stars, but, of course, much less numerous than
in the surrounding regions. The dark effect is chiefly caused by contrast with the brilliancy
of the Milky Way surrounding it. Al-Sufi also mentions the bright stars a and /? Centauri which follow the Southern Cross. He
says that the distance between them " is four
cubits," that is about 9 20', but it is less than this
now. a has a large " proper motion " of 3"'67 per
annum, and was farther, from /3 in Al-Sufi's time
than it is at present. This, however, would not wholly account for the difference, and Al-Sufi's over-estimate is probably due to the well-known effect by which the distance between two stars
is apparently increased when they are near the horizon. Several of Al-Sufi's distances between
southern stars are over-estimated, probably for the same reason. The constellation Lupus, the Wolf, is south of
Libra and Scorpio. It lies along the western border of the Milky Way. According to ancient
writers it represents Lycaon, King of Arcadia, a contemporary of Cecrops, who is said to have sacrificed human victims, and 011 account of his cruelty was changed into a wolf. Another fable



THE CONSTELLATIONS 295
is that it represents a wolf sacrificed by the
Centaur Chiron. According to Brown, Lupus appears on the Euphratian planisphere discovered by George Smyth in the palace of Sennacherib. Al-Sufi called it al-sabu, "the Wild Beast." It
was also called al-fand, "the Leopard," and al
asada, " the Lioness."
Ara, the Altar, lies south of Scorpio. According to ancient writers it represents an altar built by
Vulcan, when the gods made war against the Titans. It is called by Al-Sufi al-midjman, " the
Scent Box," or "the Altar."
The little constellation Corona Australis, the
Southern Crown, lies south and west of Sagittarius,
east of Scorpio, and west of Telescopium. Aratus refers to the stars in Corona Australis as
" Other few Before the Archer under his forefeet Led round in circle roll without a name." 2
But the constellation was known by the names
Caduceus, Orbiculus, Corona Sagittarii, etc. The ancient poets relate that Bacchus placed this crown in the sky in honour of his mother Semele.3 Others say that it represents the crown conferred on Corinne of Thebes, famous as a poet. The small constellation Piscis Australis, or the

Southern Fish, lies south of Capricornus and Aquarius. In the most ancient maps it is represented as a fish drinking the water which flows from the urn of Aquarius.
A good many constellations have been added to the heavens since the days of Al-Sufi, and notes on some of these may be of interest. CAMELOPABDALIS. This constellation first
appears on a celestial planisphere published by Bartschius in the year 1624. It was not formed
by Bartschius himself, but by the navigators of the sixteenth century. It lies south of Ursa
Minor, north of Perseus and Auriga, east of
Draco, and west of Cassiopeia. It contains no
star brighter than the 4th magnitude. LYNX. This constellation is south of Camelopardalis and Ursa Major, and north of Gemini and Cancer. It was formed by Hevelius in 1660,
and he called it the Lynx, because, he said, it contained only faint stars and " it was necessary
to have the eyes of a lynx " to see them ! Some
of them were, however, observed by Ptolemy and Al-Sufi, and are mentioned by the latter under
Ursa Major. CANES VENATICI, or the Hunting Dogs. This was formed by Hevelius in 1660. It lies south of the Great Bear's tail, north of Coma Berenices, east
of Ursa Major, and west of Bootis. Its brightest stars a (12) and /3 (8) were observed by Al-Sufi,



THE CONSTELLATIONS 297
and included by him in the " extern " stars of Ursa
Major. COMA BERENICES. This constellation lies be
tween Canes Venatici and Virgo. Although it was not included among the old forty-eight
constellations of Ptolemy, it is referred to by
Al-Sufi as the Plat, or Tress of Hair, and he included its stars Flamsteed 12, 15, and 21 in the
" extern " stars of Leo. It was originally formed by the poet Callimachus in the third century B.C.,
but was not generally accepted until reformed by Hevelius. Callimachus lived at Alexandria in the
reigns of Ptolemy Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes, and was chief librarian of the famous library of Alexandria from about B.C. 260 until his death in B.C. 240. Eratosthenes was one of his
pupils. The history of the constellation is as
follows : Berenice, wife of Ptolemy Euergetes, made a vow, when her husband was leaving her on a
military expedition, that if he returned in safety she would cut off her hair and consecrate it in the temple of Mars. Her husband returned, and she fulfilled her vow. But on the next day the hair
had disappeared stolen from the temple and Conon the mathematician showed Ptolemy seven stars near the constellation of the Lion which did
not belong to any constellation. These were
formed into a constellation and called Berenice's
Hair. Conon is referred to by Catullus in the lines



298 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
" Idem me ille Conon coeleste numine vidit E. Berenice vertice Caesariem."
Coma Berenices first occurs as a distinct con
stellation in the catalogue contained in the
Rudolphine Tables formed by Kepler (epoch 1600) from the observations of Tycho Brahe. 1 Bayer substituted a sheaf of corn, an idea derived from
an ancient manuscript. LEO MINOR. This small constellation lies between Ursa Major and Leo, and east of the Lynx. It was formed by Halley about the year 1660 ; but is referred to by Al-Sufi, who includes
one of its stars (PI. 41) in the " extern " stars of
Leo. There are, however, several brighter stars
in the group. The brightest, PI. 46, was measured 3-92 at Harvard. The star PI. 37 was called
prcecipua (or brightest) by Tycho Brahe, and rated 3, but as it was measured only 4'77 at Harvard it may possibly have diminished in
brightness. SEXTANS. This constellation lies south of Leo,
and north and east of Hydra. It was formed by
Hevelius about the year 1680. According to the
Harvard photometric measures its brightest star
is PI. 15 (4-50). MONOCEROS, or the Unicorn, lies south of Gemini
and Canis Minor, north of Canis Major and Argo, east of Orion, and west of Hydra. It appears on the planisphere of Bartschius, published in
1 W. T. Lynn in The Observatory, vol. 22, p. 236.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 299
1624. According to Scaliger it is shown on an
old Persian sphere. One of its stars, Fl. 22, is
mentioned by Al-Sufi among the " extern " stars
of Canis Major (No. 1). Another, Fl. 30, is given
under Hydra (" Extern " No. 1) and Fl. 8, 13, and
15 are apparently referred to in Gemini. The star
15 Monocerotis is a little south of Geminorum, and was measured 4*59 magnitude at Harvard. It was at one time supposed to be variable with
a short period (about 3| days), but this variation has not been confirmed. The spectrum is of the
fifth type with bright lines a very rare type
among naked-eye stars. It is a triple star (5, 8-8, 11-2: 2"'9, 16"'3) and should be seen with a
4-inch telescope. It has several other small
companions, one of which (139*2 : 75"*7) has been suspected of variation in light. It was estimated
8J by Main in 1863, but only 12 by Sadler in 1875.
Observing it on March 28, 1889, with 3-inch
refractor, I found it about one magnitude
brighter than a star closely preceding, and esti
mated it 8 or 8| magnitude. It is probably variable and should be watched. SCUTUM SOBIBSKI. This is, or was, a small
constellation in the southern portion of Aquila, which was formed by Hevelius in 1660 in honour of the Polish hero Sobieski. Its principal stars, which lie south-west of X Aquilae, were mentioned by Al-Sufi and are referred to by him under that
constellation. It contains a very bright spot of



300 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
Milky Way light, which may be well seen in the month of July just below the star A. Aquilse. Closely south of the star 6 Aquilae is a remarkable
variable star R Scuti (R.A. 18 h 42nu 2, S. 5 49'). It
varies from 4'8 to 7*8 with an irregular period. All the light changes can be observed with a good
opera-glass. VULPECULA, the Fox. This modern constella
tion lies south of Cygnus, north of Sagitta and
Delphinus, east of Hercules, and west of Pegasus. It was formed by Hevelius in 1660. One of its
stars, 6 Vulpeculae, is mentioned by Al-Sufi in
describing the constellation Cygnus. Closely
north-west of 32 Vulpeculae is the short-period variable T Vulpeculae. It varies from 5*5 to 6'2
magnitude, and its period is 4*436 days. This is
an interesting object, and all the changes of light can be observed with an opera-glass.
LACEBTA. This little constellation lies south
of Cepheus and north of Pegasus. Its formation
was first suggested by Roger and Anthelm in 1679,
and it was called by them " The Sceptre and the Hand of Justice." It was named Lacerta by Hevelius in 1690, and this name it still retains.
Al-Sufi seems to refer to its stars in his description
of Andromeda, but does not mention any star
in particular. It brightest star Fl. 7 (a Lacertse) is about the 4th magnitude. About one degree
south-west of 7 is 5 Lacertse, a deep orange star
with a blue companion in a fine field.



THE CONSTELLATIONS 301
There are some constellations south of the
Equator which, although above Al-Sufi's horizon when on the meridian, are not described by him, as they were formed since his time. These are as
follows : SCULPTOR. This constellation lies south of
Aquarius and Cetus, and north of Phoenix. Some of its stars are referred to by Al-Sufi under
Eridanus as lying within the large triangle
formed by /? Ceti, Fomalhaut, and a Phosnicis. The brightest star is a, about 12 south of /? Ceti
(4*39 magnitude Harvard). About 7 south-east
of a is the red and variable star R Sculptoris ;
variable from 6*2 to 8*8 magnitude, with a period
of about 376 days. Gould describes it as "in
tense scarlet." It has a spectrum of the fourth
type. PHCENIX. This constellation lies south of
Sculptor. Some of its stars are referred to by
Al-Sufi, under Eridanus, as forming a boat-shaped
figure. These are evidently a, *, /*, /?, v, and y. a is at the south-eastern angle of Al-Sufi's triangle
referred to above (under "Sculptor"). (See Proctor's Atlas, No. 3.)
FORNAX, the Furnace, lies south of Cetus, west of Eridanus, and east of Sculptor and Phoenix.
It was formed by Lacaille, and is supposed to represent a chemical furnace with an alembic
and receiver! Its brightest star, a Fornacis, is identical with 12 Eridani. j



302 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
C^ELUM, the Sculptor's Tools, is a small constellation east of Columba, and west of Eridanus. It
was formed by Lacaille. The brightest stars are a and y, which are about 4-J magnitude, a has a faint companion ; and y is a wide double star to the naked eye.
ANTLIA, the Air Pump, lies south of Hydra, east and north of Argo, and west of Centaurus. It was formed by Lacaille. It contains no star
brighter than 4th magnitude. The brightest, a, has been variously rated from 4 to 5, and Stanley
Williams thinks its variability " highly probable." NOBMA, the Rule, lies south of Scorpio. It contains no star brighter than the 4th magnitude. TELESCOPIUM. This modern constellation lies south of Corona Australis, and north of Pavo. Its stars a, 8, and , which lie near the northern
boundary of the constellation, are referred to by Al-Sufi in his description of Ara. MICBOSCOPIUM. This small constellation is south
of Capricornus, and west of Piscis Australis. Its
stars seem to be referred to by Al-Sufi as having been seen by Ptolemy, but he does not specify their exact positions. It contains no star brighter
than 4-| magnitude.
South of Al-SufTs horizon are a number of
constellations surrounding the south pole, which, of course, he could not see. Most of these have been formed since his time, and these will now be

considered; beginning with that immediately surrounding the South Pole (Octans), and then following the others as nearly as possible in order of Right Ascension. OCTANS. This is the constellation surrounding the South Pole of the heavens. There is no bright star near the Pole, the nearest visible to
the naked eye being <r Octantis, which is within one degree of the pole. It was estimated 5*8 at
Cordoba. The brightest star in the constellation
is v Octantis (a, Proctor), which lies about 12
degrees from the pole in the direction of Indus and Microscopium. The Harvard measure in
3*74 magnitude. HYDRUS, the Water-Snake, is north of Octans in the direction of Achernar (a Eridani). The brightest star is /?, which lies close to Octantis. The Harvard measure is 2*90. Gould says its
colour is " clear yellow." It has a large proper motion of 2"-28 per annum. Sir David Gill found
a parallax of 0"*134, and this combined with the
proper motion gives a velocity of 50 miles a second at right angles to the line of sight,
y Hydri is a comparatively bright star of about the 3rd magnitude, about 15 J degrees from the
South Pole. It is reddish, with a spectrum of the
third type. HOROLOGIUM, the Clock, is north of Hydra, and south of Eridanus. Three of its stars, a, 8, and ^, at the extreme northern end of the constellation,



304 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
seem to be referred to by Al-Sufi in his descrip
tion of Eridanus, but he does not give their exact
positions. Most of the stars forming this constel
lation were below Al-Sufi' s horizon.
RETICULUM, the Net, is a small constellation
to the east of Hydrus and Horologiurn. The brightest star of the constellation is a (3'36
Harvard, 3'3 Cordoba, and "coloured"). DORADO, the Sword Pish, lies east of Reticulum and west of Pictor. It contains only two stars
brighter than the 4th magnitude. These are a (3*47 Harvard) and ft '(3*81 Harvard, but suspected of variation). About 3 east of a Reticuli is the
variable star R Doradus. It varies from 4*8 to
6'8, and its period is about 345 days. Gould calls
it " excessively red." It may be followed through
all its fluctuations of light with an opera-glass.
MENSA, or Mons Mensa, the Table Mountain, lies between Dorado and the South Pole, and represents the Table Mountain of the Cape of Good Hope. It contains no star brighter than the 5th
magnitude. PICTOR, the Painter's Easel, lies north of Doradus, and south of Columba. It contains no
very bright stars, the brightest being a (3*30
Harvard). VOLANS, the Flying Fish, is north of Mensa, and south and west of Argo. Its brighter stars, with
the exception of a and (3, form an irregular six
sided figure. Its brightest star is ft (3'65) according



THE CONSTELLATIONS 305
to the Harvard measures. The Cordoba estimates,
however, range from 3*6 to 4'4, and Gould says its colour is " bright yellow." Williams rated
it 3-8.
CHAM^LION. This small constellation lies south of Volans, and north of Mensa and Octans. None
of its stars are brighter than the 4th magni
tude, its brightest being a (4'08 Harvard) and
y (4-10). ARGO. This large constellation extends much further south than Al-Sufi could follow it. The most southern star he mentions is e Carinae, but
south of this are several bright stars, ft Carinse
is T80 according to the Harvard measures; v Carinse, 3'08 ; 0, 3'03 ; <o, 3*56 ; and others. A
little north-west of t is the long-period variable
R Caring (9h 29'7, S. 62 21', 1900). It varies from 4*5 at maximum to 10 at minimum, and the period
is about 309*7 days. A little east of R Carinse is another remarkable variable star, I Carinae
(R.A. 9h 42m '5, S. 62 3'). It varies from 3'6 to 5'0
magnitude, with a period of 35| days from maximum to maximum. All the light changes can be observed with an opera-glass, or even with the naked eye. It was discovered at Cordoba. The spectrum is of the solar type (G).
MUSCA, the Bee, is a small constellation south of the Southern Cross and Centaurus. Its
brightest stars are a (2'84 Harvard) and /3 (3*26). These two stars form a fine pair south of
x



306 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
a Crucis. Closely south-east of a is the short
period variable R Muscse. It varies from 6*5 to
7*6 magnitude, and its period is about 19 hours. All its changes of light may be observed with a
good opera-glass. APUS, the Bird of Paradise, lies south-east of
Musca, and north of Octans. Its brightest star
is a, about the 4th magnitude. Williams calls it " deep yellow." About 3 north-west of a, in the
direction of the Southern Cross, is 6 Apodis, which was found to be variable at Cordoba from 5J to
6|-. The spectrum is of the third type, which includes so many variable stars. TBIANGULUM AUSTBALIS, the Southern Triangle, is a small constellation north of Apus, and south
of Norma. A fine triangle, nearly isosceles, is
formed by its three bright stars, a, /?, y, the brightest a being at the vertex. These three stars form with a Centauri an elongated cross. The
stars ft and y are about 3rd magnitude. /3 is
reddish, c (4*11, Harvard) is also reddish, and is nearly midway between {$ and y, and near the
centre of the cross above referred to. a is a fine
star (1*88 Harvard) and is one of the brightest stars in the sky No. 33 in a list of 1500 highest
stars given by Pickering. About 1 40' west of c
is the short-period variable R Trianguli Australis (R.A. 15h 10m'8, S. 66 8') discovered at Cordoba in
1871. It varies from 6*7 to 7'4, and the period is

object and all its light changes may be well seen
with an opera-glass. A little south-east of ft is
another short-period variable, S Trianguli Australis (R.A. 15h 52m'2, S. 63 30'), which varies from 6'4 to
7*4, with a period of 6'3 days ; and all its fluctua
tions of light may also be observed with a good
opera-glass. CIRCINUS, the Compass, is a very small constellation lying between Triangulum and
Centaurus. Its brightest star, a, is about 3J magnitude, about 4 south of a Centauri.
PAVO, the Peacock, lies north of Octaiis
and Apus, and south of Telescopium. Its brightest star is a, which is a fine bright star
(2*12 Harvard). K is a short-period variable. It varies from 3*8 to 5*2, and the period is about 9
days. This is an interesting object, as all the fluctations of light can be observed by the naked eye or an opera-glass, c Pavonis was measured 4*10 at Harvard, but the Cordoba estimates vary
from 3'6 to 4'2. Gould says " it is of a remarkably
blue colour." INDUS. This constellation lies north of Octans,
and south of Sagittarius, Microscopium, and Grus. One of its stars, a, is probably referred to by
Al-Sufi in his description of Sagittarius ; it lies
nearly midway between (3 Sagittarii and a Gruis, and is the brightest star of the constellation. The
star Indi (4*74 Harvard) has a remarkably large



308 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
proper motion of 4"'68 per annum. Its parallax is
about 0"'28, and the proper motion indicates a velocity of about 49 miles a second at right angles
to the line of sight.
TOUCAN. This constellation lies north of Octans, and south of Phoenix and Grus, east of Indus, and
west of Hydrus. Its brightest star is a, of about
the 3rd magnitude.
There are seven " celestial rivers " alluded to by the ancient astronomers : 1. The Fish River, which flows from the urn of
Aquarius. 2. The " River of the Bird," or the Milky Way
in Cygiius. 3. The River of the Birds 2, including Aquila. 4. The River of Orion Eridanus. 5. The River of the god Marduk perhaps the Milky Way in Perseus.
6. The River of Serpents (Serpens, or Hydra). 7. The River of Gaii-gal (The High Cloud) probably the Milky Way as a whole. There are four serpents represented among the constellations. These are Hydra, Hydrus, Serpens, and Draco. According to the late Mr. Proctor the date of
the building of the Great Pyramid was about 3400

THE CONSTELLATIONS 309
Taurus, and this is referred to by Virgil. But this was not so in Virgil's time, when on account
of the precession of the equinoxes the equinoctial point had already entered Pisces, in which constellation it still remains. At the date
8400 B.C. the celestial equator ran along the whole
length of the constellation Hydra, nearly through Procyon, and a little north of the bright red star Antares.
The star Fomalhaut (a Piscis Australis) is interesting as being the most southern 1st magnitude star visible in England, its meridian altitude
at Greenwich being little more than eight
degrees. 1 With reference to the Greek letters given to the
brighter stars by Bayer (in his Atlas published in 1603), and now generally used by astronomers, Mr. Lynn has shown that although "Bayer did uniformly designate the brightest stars in each constellation by the letter a," 2 it is a mistake to
suppose as has often been stated in popular books on astronomy that he added the other
Greek letters in order of brightness. That this
is an error clearly appears from Bayer's own
" Explicatio " to his Atlas, aud was long since pointed out by Argelander (1832), and by Dr. Gould in his Uranometria Argentina. Gould says,
1 The Observatory, November 1907, p. 412. 2 This is* not, however, invariably the case, as pointed out by Mr. Denning in The Observatory, 1885, p. 340.



310 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
" For the stars of each order, the sequence of the letters in no manner represents that of their
brightness, but depended upon the positions of the
stars in the figure, beginning usually at the head, and following its course until all the stars of that order of magnitude were exhausted." Mr. Lynn says, "Perhaps one of the most remarkable instances in which the lettering is seen at a glance not to follow the order of the letters is that of the three
brightest stars in Aquila [Al-Sufi's * three famous
stars'], 7 being evidently brighter than /?. But there is no occasion to conjecture from this that
any change of relative brightness has taken place. Bayer reckoned both of these two of the third
magnitude, and appears to have arranged ft before 7, according to his usual custom, simply because fi is in the neck of the supposed eagle, and 7 at the root of one of the wings." l Another good example is found in the stars of the " Plough," in which the
stars are evidently arranged in the order of the
figure and not in the order of relative brightness. In fact, Bayer is no guide at all with reference to
star magnitudes. How different Al-Sufi was in
this respect ! The stars Aldebaran, Regulus, Aiitares, and Fomalhaut were called royal stars by the ancients. The reason of this was that they lie roughly about 90 apart, that is 6 hours of Right Ascension. So, if through the north and south poles of the

heavens and each of these stars we draw great
circles of the sphere, these circles will divide the
sphere into four nearly equal parts, and the ancients supposed that each of these stars ruled
over a quarter of the sphere, an idea probably connected with astrology. As the position of Aldebaran is R.A. 4h 30m
, Declination North 16 19', and that of Antares is R.A. 16h 15m
, Declina
tion South 25 2', these two stars lie at nearly
opposite points of the celestial sphere. From this it follows that our sun seen from Aldebaran would lie not very far from Antares, and seen from Antares it would appear not far from Aldebaran. The following may be considered as representative stars of different magnitudes. For those of
first magnitude and fainter I have only given those for which all the best observers in ancient and modern times agree, and which have been confirmed by modern photometric measures. The Harvard measures are given :

CHAPTER XX
The Visible Universe
SOME
researches on the distribution of stars in the sky have recently been made at
the Harvard Observatory (U.S.A.). The principal results are : (1) The number of stars on any " given area of the Milky Way is about twice as great as in an equal area of any other
region." (2) This ratio does not increase for
faint stars down to the 12th magnitude. (3) " The Milky Way covers about one-third of the sky and contains about half of the stars." (4)
There are about 10,000 stars of magnitude 6'6 or
brighter, 100,000 down to magnitude 8*7, one million to magnitude 11, and two millions to magnitude 11*9. It is estimated that there are about 18 millions of stars down to the 15th
magnitude visible in a telescope of 15 inches
aperture. 1 According to Prof. Kapteyn's researches 011
stellar distribution, he finds that going out from
the earth into space, the " star density" that is,
1 Harvard College Observatory Annals, vol. xlviii. No. 5



314 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
the number of stars per unit volume of space is fairly constant until we reach a distance of
about 200 "light years." From this point the density gradually diminishes out to a distance of
2500 " light years," at which distance it is reduced to about one-fifth of the density in the sun's
vicinity. 1 In a letter to the late Mr. Proctor (Knowledge,
November, 1885, p. 21), Sir John Herschel suggested that our Galaxy (or stellar system) " contained within itself miniatures of itself." This beautiful idea is probably true. In his account
of the greater " Magellanic cloud," Sir John Herschel describes one of the numerous objects
it contains as follows :
" Very bright, very large ; oval ; very gradually
pretty, much brighter in the middle ; a beautiful
nebula ; it has very much the resemblance to the
Nubecula Major itself as seen with the naked eye,
but it is far brighter and more impressive in its
general aspect as if it were doubled in intensity.
Note July 29, 1837. I well remember this obser
vation, it was the result of repeated comparisons
between the object seen in the telescope and the
actual iiubecula as seen high in the sky on the
meridian, and no vague estimate carelessly set
down. And who can say whether in this object,
magnified and analysed by telescopes infinitely
superior to what we now possess, there may not
exist all the complexity of detail that the nubecula
itself presents to our examination ? " 2

THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE 315
The late Lord Kelvin, in a remarkable address delivered before the Physical Science Section of the British Association at its meeting at Glasgow
in 1901, considered the probable quantity of matter contained in our Visible Universe. He
takes a sphere of radius represented by the distance of a star having a parallax of onethousandth of a second (or about 3000 years'
journey for light), and he supposes that uniformly distributed within this sphere there exists a mass of matter equal to 1000 million times the sun's mass. With these data he finds that a body
placed originally at the surface of the sphere would in 5 million years acquire by gravitational force a velocity of about 12J miles a second, and after 25 million of years a velocity of about 67 miles a second. As these velocities are of the same order as the observed velocities among the stars, Lord Kelvin concludes that there is probably as much matter in our universe as would be
represented by a thousand million suns. If we assumed a mass of ten thousand suns the velocities would be much too high. The most probable estimate of the total number of the visible stars is about 100 millions ; so that if Lord Kelvin's calculations are correct we seem bound to assume
that space contains a number of dark bodies.
The nebulae, however, probably contain vast masses of matter, and this may perhaps account
partially, at least for the large amount of



316 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
matter estimated by Lord Kelvin. (See Chapter
on"Nebulge.") In some notes on photographs of the Milky Way, Prof. Barnard says with reference to the
great nebula near p Ophiuchi, "The peculiarity of this region has suggested to me the idea that the apparently small stars forming the ground work of the Milky Way here, are really very
small bodies compared with our own sun "
; and
again, referring to the region near ft Cygni, " One is specially struck with the apparent extreme smallness of the general mass of the stars in this
region." Again, with reference to x Cygni, he
says, " The stars here also are remarkably uniform
in size." l
Eastman's results for parallax seem to show that "the fainter rather than the brighter stars are
nearest to our system." But this apparent paradox is considered by Mr. Monck to be very misleading ;
2
and the present writer holds the same opinion. Prof. Kapteyn finds " that stars whose proper motions exceed 0"*05 are not more numerous in
the Milky Way than in other parts of the sky ;
or, in other words, if only the stars having proper motions of 0"*05 or upwards were mapped, there
would be no aggregation of stars shoAving the existence of the Milky Way." 3

THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE 317
With reference to the number of stars visible on photographs, the late Dr. Isaac Roberts
says
" So far as I am able at present to judge, under the atmospheric conditions prevalent in this
country, the limit of the photographic method
of delineation will be reached at stellar, or nebular, light of the feebleness of about 18th
magiiitude stars. The reason for this inference
is that the general illumination of the atmosphere
by starlight concentrated upon a film by the
instrument will mask the light of objects that are
fainter than about 18th-magnitude stars." l
With reference to blank spaces in the sky, the late Mr. Norman Pogson remarked
" Near S Ophiuchi we find one of the most re
markable vacuities in this hemisphere an elliptic
space of about 65' in length in the direction of
R.A., and 40' in width, in which there exists no
star larger than the 13th magnitude ... it is im
possible to turn a large telescope in that direction
and, if I may so express it, view such black dark
ness, without a feeling that we are here searching
into the remote regions of space, far beyond the
limits of our own sidereal system." 2
Prof. Barnard describes some regions in the
constellation Taurus containing "dark lanes" in
a groundwork of faint nebulosity. He gives two beautiful photographs of the regions referred to, and says that the dark holes and lanes are
1 Photographs of Star-Clusters and Nebulx, vol. ii. p. 17. 2 Monthly Notices, K.A.S., May 9, 1856.



318 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
apparently darker than the sky in the immediate
vicinity. He says, "A very singular feature in this connection is that the stars also are absent in general from the lanes." A close examination
of these photographs has given the present writer the impression that the dark lanes and spots are in
the nebulosity, and that the nebulosity is mixed up with the stars. This would account for the fact that the stars are in general absent from the
dark lanes. For if there is an intimate relation between the stars and the nebulosity, it would follow that where there is no nebulosity in this
particular region there would be no stars. Prof.
Barnard adds that the nebulosity is easily visible
in a 12-inch telescope.1 With reference to the life of the universe, Prof. P. R. Moulton well says
" The lifetime of a man seems fairly long, and
the epoch when Troy was besieged, or when the
Pharaohs piled up the pyramids in the valley of
the Nile, or when our ancestors separated on the
high plateaux of Asia, seems extremely remote,
but these intervals are only moments compared
to the immense periods required for geological
evolutions and the enormously greater ones con
sumed in the developement of worlds from widely
extended nebulous masses. We recognize the
existence of only those forces whose immediate
consequences are appreciable, and it may be that
those whose effects are yet unseen are really of
the highest importance. A little creature whose

life extended over only two or three hours of a
summer's day might be led, if he were sufficiently
endowed with intelligence, to infer that passing
clouds were the chief influence at work in chang
ing the climate instead of perceiving that the
sun's slow 'motion across the sky would bring
on the night and its southward motion the
winter." *
In a review of my book Astronomical Essays
in The Observatory, September, 1907, the following words occur. They seem to form a good
and sufficient answer to people who ask, What is there beyond our visible universe? "If the
stellar universe is contained in a sphere of
say 1000 stellar units radius, what is there beyond ? To this the astronomer will reply that
theories and hypotheses are put forward for the purpose of explaining observed facts ; when there
are no facts to be explained, no theory is required. As there are no observed facts as to what exists
beyond the farthest stars, the mind of the astronomer is a complete blank on the subject.
Popular imagination can fill up the blank as it pleases." With these remarks I fully concur. In his address to the British Association, Prof.
G. H. Darwin (now Sir George Darwin) said
" Man is but a microscopic being relatively to
astronomical space, and he lives on a puny planet
circling round a star of inferior rank. Does it not,
then, seem futile to imagine that he can discover

the origin and tendency of the Universe as to
expect a housefly to instruct us as to the theory
of the motions of the planets ? And yet, so long .
as he shall last, he will pursue his search, and will
110 doubt discover many wonderful things which
are still hidden. We may indeed be amazed at all
that man has been able to find out, but the
immeasurable magnitude of the undiscovered will
throughout all time remain to humble his pride.
Our children's children will still be gazing and
marvelling at the starry heavens, but the riddle
will never be read."
The ancient philosopher Lucretius said
" Globed from the atoms falling slow or swift I see the suns, I see the systems lift Their forms ; and even the system and the suna Shall go back slowly to the eternal drift." 1
But it has been well said that the structure
of the universe " has a fascination of its own for
most readers quite apart from any real progress which may be made towards its solution." 2
The Milky Way itself, Mr. Stratoiioff considers
to be an agglomeration of immense condensations, or stellar clouds, which are scattered round the
region of the galactic equator. These clouds, or masses of stars, sometimes leave spaces between
them, and sometimes they overlap, and in this way he accounts for the great rifts, like the Coal
Sack, which allow us to see through this great

circle of light. He finds other condensations of stars ; the nearest is one of which our sun is a
member, chiefly composed of stars of the higher magnitudes which " thin out rapidly as the Milky Way is approached," There are other condensations : one in stars of magnitudes 6*5 to 8*5 ; and
a third, farther off, in stars of magnitudes 7 '6 to 8.
These may be called opera-glass, or field-glass stars.
Stratonoff finds that stars with spectra of the
first type (class A, B, C, and D of Harvard) which include the Sirian and Orion stars, are principally situated near the Milky Way, while those of type
II. (which includes the solar stars) " are principally
condensed in a region coinciding roughly with the terrestrial pole, and only show a slight increase, as compared with other stars, as the galaxy is
approached." 1 Prof. Kapteyn thinks that " undoubtedly one
of the greatest difficulties, if not the greatest of all, in the way of obtaining an understanding of the real distribution of the stars in space, lies in our uncertainty about the amount of loss suffered by the light of the stars on its way to the
observer." 2 He says, " There can be little doubt
in my opinion, about the existence of absorption in space, and I think that even a good guess as to the order of its amount can be made. For, first

322 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
we know that space contains an enormous mass of meteoric matter. This matter must necessarily
intercept some part of the star-light."
This absorption, however, seems to be comparatively small. Kapteyn finds a value of 0*016 (about ^th) of a magnitude for a star at a distance
corresponding to a parallax of one-tenth of a
second (about 33 " light years "). This is a quantity almost imperceptible in the most delicate photometer. But for very great distances such as 3000
" light years " the absorption would evidently become very considerable, and would account
satisfactorily for the gradual " thinning out " of the fainter stars. If this were fully proved, we
should have to consider the fainter stars of the
Milky Way to be in all probability fairly large suns, the light of which is reduced by absorption. That some of the ancients knew that the Milky
Way is composed of stars is shown by the following lines translated from Ovid :
" A way there is in heaven's extended plain Which when the skies are clear is seen below And mortals, by the name of Milky, know ; The groundwork is of stars, through which the road Lies open to great Jupiter's abode." 1
From an examination of the distribution of the
faint stars composing the Milky Way, and those shown in Argelander's charts of stars down to the

THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE 325
9J magnitude, Easton finds that there is "a real connection between the distribution of 9th and
10 th magnitude stars, and that of the faint stars of the Milky Way, and that consequently the
faint or very faint stars of the galactic zone are at a distance which does not greatly exceed that
of the 9th and 10th magnitude stars." 1 A similar
conclusion was, I think, arrived at by Proctor many years ago. Now let us consider the mean
ing of this result. Taking stars of the 15th
magnitude, if their faiiitiiess were merely due to
greater distance, their actual brightness if of the same size would imply that they are at 10
times the distance of stars of the 10th magnitude. But if at the same distance from us, a 10th
magnitude star would be 100 times brighter than
a 15th magnitude star, and if of the same density
and " intrinsic brightness " (or luminosity of surface) the 10th magnitude w^ould have 10 times the diameter of the fainter star, and hence its volume would be 1000 times greater (10 3
), and this
great difference is not perhaps improbable. The constitution of the Milky Way is not the
same in all its parts. The bright spot between
ft and y Cygiii is due to relatively bright stars. Others equally dense but fainter regions in Auriga and Monoceros are only evident in stars of the
8th and 9th magnitude, and the light of the wellknown luminous spot in "Sobieski's Shield,"

ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
closely south of X Aquike, is due to stars below
magnitude 9J. The correspondence in distribution between the
stars of Argelander's charts and the fainter stars
of the Milky Way shows, as Easton points out, that Herschel's hypothesis of a uniform distribu
tion of stars of approximately equal size is quite untenable. It has been suggested that the Milky Way may
perhaps form a ring of stars with the sun placed nearly, but not exactly, in the centre of the ring. But were it really a ring of uniform width with
the sun eccentrically placed within it, we should expect to find the Milky Way wider at its nearest
part, and gradually narrowing towards the oppo
site point. Now, Herschel's " gages " and Celoria's counts show that the Galaxy is wider in Aquila than in Monoceros. This is confirmed by Easton,
who says, "for the faint stars taken as a ivhole, the Milky Way is widest in its brightest part" (the italics are Easton' s). From this we should conclude that the Milky Way is nearer to us in the direction of Aquila than in that of Monoceros. Sir John Herschel suggested that the southern parts of the galactic zone are nearer to us on
account of their greater brightness in those
regions.1 But greater width is a safer test of
distance than relative brightness. For it may be
easily shown than the intrinsic brightness of an

THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE 325
area containing a large number of stars would be the same for all distances (neglecting the sup
posed absorption of light in space). For suppose any given area crowded with stars to be removed to a greater distance. The light of each star would be diminished inversely as the square of the distance. But the given area would also be
diminished directly as the square of the distance, so we should have a diminished amount of light on an equally diminished area, and hence the
intrinsic brightness, or luminosity of the area per unit of surface, would remain unaltered. The
increased brightness of the Milky Way in Aquila is accounted for by the fact that Herschel's
" gages " show an increased number of stars, and
hence the brightness in Aquila and Sagittarius does not necessarily imply that the Milky Way is nearer to us in those parts, but that it is richer in
small stars than in other regions.
Easton is of opinion that the annular hypothesis of the Milky Way is inconsistent with our present
knowledge of the galactic phenomena, and he suggests that its actual constitution resembles
more that of a spiral nebula. 1 On this hypothesis the increase in the number of stars in the regions above referred to may be due to our seeing one branch of the supposed "two-branched spiral" projected on another branch of the same spiral. This seems supported by Sir John Herschel's
1 Astrophyaical Journal, vol. 12, p. 13G.



326 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
observations in the southern hemisphere, where he found in some places " a tissue as it were of
large stars spread over another of very small
ones, the immediate magnitudes being wanting." Again, portions of the spiral branches may be richer than others, as photographs of spiral nebulae seem to indicate. Celoria, rejecting the
hypothesis of a single ring, suggests the existence of two galactic rings inclined to each other at an
angle of about 20, one of these including the
brighter stars, and the other the fainter. But
this seems to be a more artificial arrangement
then the hypothesis of a spiral. Further, the complicated structure of the Milky Way cannot be well explained by Celoria' s hypothesis of two distinct rings one inside the other. From analogy
the spiral hypothesis seems much more probable. Considering the Milky Way to represent a colossal spiral nebula viewed from a point not far removed from the centre of the spiral
branches, Easton suggests that the bright region between /? and y Cygni, which is very rich in
comparatively bright stars, may possibly repre
sent the " central accumulations of the Milky
Way," that is, the portion corresponding to the nucleus of a spiral nebula. If this be so, this portion of the Milky Way should be nearer to us than others. Easton also thinks that the so
called "solar cluster" of Gould, Kapteyn, and
Schiaparelli may perhaps be " the expression of



THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE
the central condensation of the galactic system
itself, composed of the most part of suns comparable with our own, and which would thus embrace most of the bright stars to the 9th or
10th magnitude. The distance of the galactic streams and convolutions would thus be com
parable with the distances of these stars." He thinks that the sun lies within a gigantic spiral,
"in a comparatively sparse region between the central nucleus and Orion." Scheiner thinks that "the irregularities of the
Milky Way, especially in streams, can be quite well accounted for, as Easton has attempted to
do, if they are regarded as a system of spirals,
and not as a ring system." Evidence in favour of the spiral hypothesis of the Milky Way, as advocated by Easton and Scheiner, may be found in Kapteyn's researches on the proper motions of the stars. This eminent astronomer finds that stars with measurable
proper motions and therefore in all probability
relatively near the earth have mostly spectra of the solar type, and seem to cluster round " a point
adjacent to the sun, in total disregard to the position of the Milky Way," and that stars with little or no proper motion collect round the
galactic plain. He is also of opinion that the Milky Way resembles the Andromeda nebula,
"the globular nucleus representing the solar cluster, and the far spreading wings or whorls the



328 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
compressed layer of stars enclosed by the rings of the remote Galaxy." With reference to the plurality of inhabited worlds, it has been well said by the ancient writer Metrodorus (third century B.C.), "The idea that there is but a single world in all infinitude would be as absurd as to suppose that a vast field had been formed to produce a single blade of wheat." l With
this opinion the present writer fully concurs.

achievements of Hipparchus in
astronomy were very remarkable, considering the age in which he lived. He found the amount of the apparent motion of the
stars due to the precession of the equinoxes (of which he was the discoverer) to be 59" per annum. The correct amount is about 50". He measured the length of the year to within 9 minutes of its true value. He found the inclina
tion of the ecliptic to the plane of the equator to be 23 51'. It was then 23 46' as we now know by modern calculations so that Hipparchus'
estimation was a wonderfully close approximation to the truth. He computed the moon's parallax to be 57', which is about its correct value.
He found the eccentricity of the sun's apparent orbit round the earth to be one twenty-fourth, the real value being then about one-thirteenth. He determined other motions connected with the
earth and moon ; and formed a catalogue of 1080 stars. All this work has earned for him the
Avell-merited title of " The Father of Astronomy." l

The following is a translation of a Greek passage
ascribed to Plotemy : " I know that I am mortal and the creature of a day, but when I search out
the many rolling circles of the stars, my feet touch the earth no longer, but with Zeus himself
I take my fill of ambrosia, the food of the gods." l
This was inscribed (in Greek) on a silver loving
cup presented to the late Professor C. A. Young, the famous American astronomer.2
Some curious and interesting phenomena are recorded in the old Chinese Annals, which go
back to a great antiquity. In 687 B.C. " a night " is mentioned "without clouds and without
stars "
(!) This may perhaps refer to a total
eclipse of the sun ; but if so, the eclipse is not mentioned in the Chinese list of eclipses. In the year 141 B.C., it is stated that the sun and moon
appeared of a deep red colour during 5 days, a phenomenon which caused great terror among the people. In 74 B.C., it is related that a star as large as the moon appeared, and was followed in its motion by several stars of ordinary size. This
probably refers to an unusually large " bolide *'
or " fireball." In 38 B.C., a fall of meteoric stones is recorded " of the size of a walnut." In A.D. 88,
another fall of stones is mentioned. In A.D. 321,
sun-spots were visible to the naked eye.

GENERAL 331
Homer speaks of a curious darkness which occurred during one of the great battles in the last year of the Trojan war. Mr. Stockwell
identifies this with an eclipse of the sun which
took place on August 28, 1184 B.C. An eclipse referred to by Thucydides as having occurred dur
ing the first year of the Pelopomiesiaii War, when the darkness was so great that some stars were
seen, is identified by Stockwell with a total eclipse
of the sun, which took place on August 2, 430 B.C.
A great eclipse of the sun is supposed to have occurred in the 'year 43 or 44 B.C., soon after the death of Julius Caesar. Baron de Zach and Arago
mention it as the first annular eclipse on record.
But calculations show that no solar eclipse what
ever, visible in Italy, occurred in either of these
years. The phenomenon referred to must therefore have been of atmospherical origin, and indeed
this is suggested by a passage in Suetonius, one of the authors quoted on the subject. M. Guillaurne thinks that the ninth Egyptian
plague, the thick "darkness" (Exodus x. 21-23),
may perhaps be explained by a total eclipse of the sun which occurred in 1332 B.C. It is true that the account states that the darkness
lasted " three days," but this, M. Guillaume thinks, may be due to an error in the translation.1 This
explanation, however, seems very improbable. According to Hind, the moon was eclipsed on

the generally received date of the Crucifixion, A.D. 33, April 3. He says, " I find she had
emerged from the earth's dark shadow a quarter of an hour before she rose at Jerusalem
(6h 36m p.m.) ; but the penumbra continued upon her disc for an hour afterwards." An eclipse could not have had anything to do with the "darkness over all the land" during the Cruci
fixion. For this lasted for three hours, and the
totality of a solar eclipse can only last a few minutes at the most. As a matter of fact the
" eclipse of Phlegon," a partial one (A.D. 29, November 24) was " the only solar eclipse that could have been visible in Jerusalem during
the period usually fixed for the ministry of Christ." It is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that a total eclipse of the sun took place in the year after King Alfred's great battle with the Danes. Now, calculation shows that this
eclipse occurred on October 29, 878 A.D. King
Alfred's victory over the Danes must, therefore, have taken place in 877 A.D., and his death probably occurred in 899 A.D. This solar eclipse is also mentioned in the Annals of Ulster. From this it will be seen that in some cases the dates of
historical events can be accurately fixed by astronomical phenomena.
It is stated by some historians that an eclipse of the sun took place on the morning of the battle of



GENERAL 333
Crecy, August 26, 1346. But calculation shows that there was no eclipse of the sun visible in England in that year. At the time of the famous battle the moon had just entered on her first
quarter, and she was partially eclipsed six days afterwards that is on the 1st of September. The mistake seems to have arisen from a mistranslation of the old French word esclistre, which means lightning. This was mistaken for esclipse. The account seems to indicate that there was a heavy thunderstorm on the morning of the battle.
A dark shade was seen on the waning moon by Messrs. Hirst and J. C. Russell on October 21, 1878, " as dark as the shadow during an eclipse of the
moon." 1 If this observation is correct, it is
certainly most difficult to explain. Another curious observation is recorded by Mr. E. Stone
Wiggins, who says that a partial eclipse of the sun by a dark body was observed in the State of
Michigan (U.S.A.) on May 16, 1884, at 7 p.m. The
" moon at that moment was 12 degrees south of the equator and the sun as many degrees north of it." The existence of a dark satellite of the
earth has been suggested, but this seems highly
improbable. The sun's corona seems to have been first noticed in the total eclipse of the sun which occurred at the death of the Roman emperor

Doniitian, A.D. 95. Philostratus in his Life of
Apollonius says, with reference to this eclipse, " In the heavens there appeared a prodigy of this
nature : a certain corona resembling the Iris surrounded the orb of the sun, and obscured its light." * In more modern times the corona seems to have been first noticed by Clavius during the
total eclipse of April 9, 1567. 2 Kepler proved that
this eclipse was total, not annular, so that the ring seen by Clavius must have been the corona. With reference to the visibility of planets and
stars during total eclipses of the sun ; in the
eclipse of May 12, 1706, Venus, Mercury, and Aldebaran, and several other stars were seen.
During the totality of the eclipse of May 3, 1715, about twenty stars were seen with the naked eye. '
At the eclipse of May 22, 1724, Venus and Mercury, and a few fixed stars were seen.4 The corona was
also noticed. At the eclipse of May 2, 1733,

During the total eclipses of February 9, 17G6, June 24, 1778, and June 16, 1806, the corona was again noticed. But its true character was then unknown.
At the eclipse of July 8, 1842, it was noticed by

Betelgeuse (a Orionis), which are usually red. *' appeared quite white." 1 There will be seven eclipses in the years 1917,
1935, and 1985. In the year 1935 there will be five
eclipses of the sun, a rare event ; and in 1985 there will be three total eclipses of the moon, a most unusual occurrence.2
Among the ancient Hindoos, the common people believed that eclipses were caused by the interposition of a monstrous demon called Raha. This
absurd idea, and others equally ridiculous, were based on declarations in their sacred books, and no pious Hindoo would think of denying it.
The following cases of darkenings of the sun are given by Humboldt : According to Plutarch the sun remained pale for
a whole year at the death of Julius Caesar, and gave less than its usual heat.3
A sun-darkening lasting for two hours is recorded on August 22, 358 A.D., before the great
earthquake of Nicomedia.
In 360 A.D. there was a sun-darkening from early
morn till noon. The description given by the historians of the time corresponds to an eclipse of the sun, but the duration of the obscurity is
inexplicable. In 409 A.D., when Alaric lay siege to Rome,

"there was so great a darkness that the stars were seen by day."
In 536 A.D. the sun is said to have been darkened for a year and two months !
In 626 A.D., according to Abul Farag, half the sun's disc was darkened for eight months !
In 934 A.D. the sun lost its brightness for two
months in Portugal. In 1090 A.D. the sun was darkened for three hours.
In 1096, sun-spots were seen with the naked eye on March 3.
In 1206 A.D. on the last day of February, " there
was complete darkness for six hours, turning the day into night." This seems to have occurred in
Spain. In 1241 the sun was so darkened that stars could be seen at 3 p.m. on Michaelmas day. This happened in Vienna.1 The sun is said to have been so darkened in the
year 1547 A.D. for three days that stars were visible at midday. This occurred about the time
of the battle of Miihlbergh. 2
Some of these darkenings may possibly have been due to an enormous development of sun
spots ; but in some cases the darkness is supposed by Chladni and Schnurrer to have been caused by
" the passage of meteoric masses before the sun's disc."

The first observer of a transit of Venus was Jeremiah Horrocks, who observed the transit of
November 24 (O.S.), 1639. He had previously corrected Kepler's predicted tune of the transit from 8h 8m a.m. at Manchester to 5h 57m p.m. At the end of 1875 a marble scroll was placed on the pedestal of the monument of John Conduitt

338 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
The transit of Venus which occurred in 1761 was observed on board ship(!) by the famous but unfortunate French astronomer Le Gentil.
The ship was the frigate Sylphide, sent to the help of Pondicherry (India) which was then being besieged by the English. Owing to unfavourable winds the Sylphide was tossed about from March 25, 1761, to May 24 of the same year. When, on the later date, off the coast of Malabar,
the captain of the frigate learned that Pondicherry had been captured by the English, the vessel returned to the Isle of France, where it arrived on June 23, after touching at Point de Galle 011 May 30. It was between these two places that Le Gentil made his observations of the transit of Venus under such unfavourable conditions.
He had an object-glass of 15 feet (French) focus, and this he mounted in a tube formed of " four
pine planks." This rough instrument was fixed
to a small mast set up on the quarter-deck and worked by ropes. The observations made under
such curious conditions, were not, as may be
imagined, very satisfactory. As another transit was to take place 011 June 3, 1769, Le Gentil made the heroic resolution of remaining in the southern
hemisphere to observe it! This determination was duly carried out, but his devotion to astronomy was not rewarded ; for on the day of the long waited for transit the sky at Pondicherry (where he had gone to observe it) was clouded over



GENERAL 339
during the whole phenomenon, " although for many days previous the sky had been cloudless.'*
To add to his feeling of disappointment he heard that at Manilla, where he had been staying some
time previously, the sky was quite clear, and two of his friends there had seen the transit without
any difficulty.1 Truly the unfortunate Le Gentil
was a martyr to science. The famous German astronomer Bessel once said " that a practical astronomer could make observations of value if he had only a cart-wheel
and a gun barrel "
; and Watson said that " the most important part of the instrument is the person at the small end." 2 With reference to Father Hell's supposed forgery of his observations of the transit of Venus in 1769, and Littrow's criticism of some of
the entries in Hell's manuscript being corrected with a different coloured ink, Professor Newcomb ascertained from Weiss that Littrow was colour blind, and could not distinguish between the colour of Aldebaran and the whitest star." Newcomb adds, " For half a century the astronomical world had based an impression on the innocent but mistaken evidence of a colour-blind man
respecting the tint of ink in a manuscript." It is recorded that on February 26, B.C. 2012,
the moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn,

were in the same constellation, and within 14
degrees of each other. On September 14, 1186 A.D., the sun, moon, and all the planets then known, are said to have been situated in Libra.1
In the Sanscrit epic poem, " The Ramaya," it is stated that at the birth of Rama, the moon was
in Cancer, the sun in Aries, Mercury in Taurus,
Venus in Pisces, Mars in Capricornus, Jupiter in Cancer, and Saturn in Libra. From these data, Mr. Walter R. Old has computed that Rama was
born on February 10, 1761 B.C.2
A close conjunction of Mars and Saturn was observed by Denning on September 29, 1889, the bright star Regulus (a Leonis) being at the time only 47' distant from the planets.3 An occultation of the Pleiades by the moon was observed by Timocharis at Alexandria on
January 29, 282 B.C. Calculations by Schjellerup show that Alcyone (>; Tauri) was occulted; but the exact time of the day recorded by Timocharis
differs very considerably from that computed by Schjellerup.4 Another occultation of the Pleiades is recorded by Agrippa in the reign of
Domitian. According to Schjellerup the phenomenon occurred on November 29, A.D. 92. " Kepler states that on the 9th of January, 1591,

Maestlin and himself witnessed an occultation of
Jupiter by Mars. The red colour of the latter on that occasion plainly indicated that it was the inferior planet." l That is, that Mars was nearer
to the sun than Jupiter. But as the telescope had not then been invented, this may have been
merely a near approach of the two planets. According to Kepler, Msestlin. saw an occultation of Mars by Venus on October 3, 1590. But this
may also have been merely a near approach.1
A curious paradox is that one can discover an
object without seeing it, and see an object without
discovering it ! The planet Neptune was discovered by Adams and Leverrier by calculation before it was seen in the telescope by Galle ; and
it was actually seen by Lalande on May 8 and 10, 1795, but he took it for a star and thus missed the
discovery. In fact, he saiv the planet, but did not discover it. It actually appears as a star of the
8th magnitude in Harding's Atlas (1822). The great " new star " of February, 1901, known as
Nova Persei, was probably seen by some people before its discovery was announced ; and it was actually noticed by a well-known American
astronomer, who thought it was some bright star with which he was not familiar! But this did
not amount to a discovery. Any one absolutely ignorant of astronomy might have made the same observation. An object must be identified as a

new object before a discovery can be claimed. Some years ago a well-known Irish naturalist
discovered a spider new to science, and after its discovery he found that it was common in nearly every house in Dublin ! But this fact did not
detract in the least from the merit of its scientific
discovery. There is a story of an eminent astronomer who
had been on several eclipse expeditions, and yet was heard to remark that he had never seen a total eclipse of the sun. " But your observations
of several eclipses are on record," it was objected. " Certainly, I have on several occasions made
observations, but I have always been too busy to look at the eclipse." He was probably in a dark
tent taking photographs or using a spectroscope during the totality. This was observing an
eclipse without seeing it ! Humboldt gives the credit of the invention of
the telescope to Hans Lippershey, a native of Wesel and a spectacle-maker at Middleburgh ; to Jacob Adreaansz, surnamed Metius, who is also said to have made burning-glasses of ice ; and to Zachariah Jansen.1
With reference to the parabolic figure of the
large mirrors of reflecting telescopes, Dr. Robinson remarked at the meeting of the British Association at Cork in 1843, " between the spherical and parabolic figures the extreme difference is so

slight, even in the telescope of 6-feet aperture [Lord Rosse's] that if the two surfaces touched
at their vertex, the distance at the edge would
not amount to the foiooth ^ an inch, a space which few can measure, and none without a
microscope." 1 In the year 1758, Roger Long, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, constructed an
"orrery" on a novel principle. It was a hollow metal sphere of about 18 feet in diameter with
its fixed axis parallel to the earth's axis. It was rotated, by means of a winch and rackwork. It
held about thirty persons in its interior, where astronomical lectures were delivered. The con
stellations were painted 011 the interior surface;
and holes pierced through the shell and illumi
nated from the outside represented the stars
according to their different magnitudes. This ingenious machine was much neglected for many years, but was still in existence in Admiral
Smyth's time, 1844. 2
A " temporary star " is said to have been seen
by Hepidanus in the constellation Aries in either
1006 or 1012 A.D. The late M. Schonfeld, a great authority 011 variable stars, found from an Arabic and Syrian chronicle that 1012 is the correct year (396 of the Hegira), but that the word translated Aries would by a probable emendation mean

Mr. Heber D. Curtis finds that the faintest stars
mentioned in Ptolemy's Catalogue are about 5*38 magnitude on the scale of the Harvard Photometric Durchmustering. 2 Heis and Houzeaii saw stars of 6-7 magnitude (about 6'4 on Harvard scale). The present writer found that he could
see most of Heis' faintest stars in the west of
Ireland (Co. Sligo) without optical aid (except short-sighted spectacles). With reference to the apparent changes in the
stellar heavens produced by the precession of the
equinoxes, Humboldt says
" Canopus was fully 1 20' below the horizon
of Toledo (39 54' north latitude) in the time of
Columbus ; and now the same star is almost as
much above the horizon of Cadiz. While at Berlin, and in northern latitudes, the stars of the
Southern Cross, as well as a and fi Centauri, are
receding more and more from view, the Magellamc
Clouds are slowly approaching our latitudes.
Canopus was at its greatest northern approxi
mation during last century [eighteenth], and is
now moving nearer and nearer to the south,
although very slowly, owing to its vicinity to the
south pole of the ecliptic. The Southern Cross
began to become invisible in 52 30' north latitude
2900 years before our era, since, according to
Galle, this constellation might previously have
reached an altitude of more than 10. When it

With reference to the great Grecian philosopher
and scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene, keeper of
the Alexandrian Library under Ptolemy Euergetes, Carl Snyder says, " Above all the Alexanders,
Caesars, Tadema-Napoleons, I set the brain which
first spanned the earth, over whose little patches
these fought through their empty bootless lives.
Why should we have no poet to celebrate so great
a deed ? " 2 And with reference to Aristarchus he
says, "If grandeur of conceptions be a measure of the brain, or ingenuity of its powers, then we must rank Aristarchus as one of the three or four most acute intellects of the ancient world." 3

greatest mathematical geniuses of ancient or
modern times. In this respect he is worthy of
a place with Archimedes or Newton, although
he was far from possessing the sagacity in
physical enquiries which distinguished these
illustrious sages. From the very outset of his
career he assumed a commanding position among
the mathematicians of the age, and during the
course of nearly half a century previous to his
death, he continued to divide with Laplace the
homage due to pre-eminence in the exact sciences.
His great rival survived him fourteen years,
during which he reigned alone as the prince of
mathematicians and theoretical astonomers." x
A writer in Nature (May 25, 1871) relates the following anecdote with reference to Sir John Herschel : " Some time after the death of Laplace,
the writer of this notice, while travelling on the continent in company with the celebrated French
savant Biot, ventured to put to him the question, not altogether a wise one, * And whom of all the
philosophers of Europe do you regard as the most worthy successor of Laplace ? ' Probably no man was better able than Biot to form a correct con
clusion, and the reply was more judicious than the question. It was this, If I did not love him
so much I should unhesitatingly say, Sir John
Herschel.' " Dr. Gill (now Sir David Gill), in an
address at the Cape of Good Hope in June, 1898, spoke of Sir John Herschel as " the prose poet of science ; his popular scientific works are models of

passages of surpassing beauty. His life was a pure and blameless one from first to last, full of the noblest effort and the noblest aim from
the time when as a young Cambridge graduate he registered a vow * to try to leave the world wiser than he found it' a vow that his life amply
fulfilled." x
Prof. Newcomb said of Adams, the co-discoverer
of Neptune with Leverrier, "Adams' intellect was one of the keenest I ever knew. The most
difficult problem of mathematical astronomy and the most recondite principles that underlie the theory of the celestial motions were to him
but child's play." Airy he regarded as "the most commanding figure in the astronomy of our time." 2 He spoke of Delaunay, the great French astronomer, as a most kindly and attractive man,
and says, "His investigations of the moon's
motion is one of the most extraordinary pieces of mathematical work ever turned out by a single
person. It fills two quarto volumes, and the reader who attempts to go through any part of the calculations will wonder how one man could
do the work in a lifetime." 3

1892, and the latter on January 22 of the same
year. It is known from the parish register of Burstow
in Surrey that Flamsteed (Rev. John Flamsteed), the first Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, was buried in the church at that place on January 12, 1720 ; but a search for his grave made by Mr. J.
Carpenter in 1866 and by Mr. Lynn in 1880 led to no result. In Mrs. Flamsteed's will a sum of
twenty-five pounds was left for the purpose of erecting a monument to the memory of the great astronomer in Burstow Church; but it does not appear that any monument was ever erected. Flamsteed was Rector of the Parish of Burstow. 1 He was succeeded in 1720 by the Rev. James Pound, another well-known astronomer. Pound died in 1724. 2
Evelyn says in his Diary, 1676, September 10, " Dined with Mr. Flamsteed, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new Observatory in Greenwich Park furnished with the choicest instruments. An honest sincere man." 3 This shows that in
those days the term " astrologer " was synonymous with " astronomer."

"Behind the artisan is a chemist, behind the

nor in what direction to head his ship in order
to reach a desired harbour. Think what this

In his interesting book, Reminiscences of an Astronomer, Prof. Simon Newcomb says with reference to the calculations for the Nautical
Almanac (referred to in the above extract)
" A more hopeless problem than this could not be
presented to the ordinary human intellect. There
are tens of thousands of men who could be successful in all the ordinary walks of life,
hundreds who could wield empires, thousands
who could gain wealth, for one who could take
up this astronomical problem with any hope of

in intellect the select few of the human race an aristocracy ranking above all others in the scale
of being. The astronomical ephemeris is the last
outcome of their productive genius."



350 ASTRONOMICAL CURIOSITIES
In a paper on the " Aspects of American
Astronomy," Prof. Newcomb says, " A great telescope is of no use without a man at the end of it, and what the telescope may do depends more upon this appendage than upon the instrument itself. The place which telescopes and observatories have taken in astronomical history are by
no means proportional to their dimensions. Many a great instrument has been a mere toy in the hands of its owner. Many a small one has become famous. Twenty years ago there was
here in your city [Chicago] a modest little instru
ment which, judged by its size, could not hold up its head with the great ones even of that day.
It was the private property of a young man holding no scientific position and scarcely known to the public. And yet that little telescope is
to-day among the famous ones of the world, having made memorable advances in the astronomy of double stars, and shown its owner to be a worthy successor of the Herschels and Struves in that
line of work." 1 Here Prof. Newcomb evidently refers to Prof. Burnham, and the 6-inch telescope with which he made many of his remarkable discoveries of double stars. With reference to Burnham's work, Prof. Barnard says
" It represents the labour of a struggling
amateur, who during the day led the drudging
life of a stenographer in the United States court

in Chicago, and at night worked among the stars
for the pure love of it. Such work deserves an
everlasting fame, and surely this has fallen to Mr
Buriiham."
Admiral Smyth says
" A man may prove a good astronomer without
possessing a spacious observatory : thus Kepler
was wont to observe on the bridge at Prague ;
Schroter studied the moon, and Harding found
a planet from a gloriette ; while Olbers discovered
two new planets from an attic of his house." x
It is probably not generally known that " some of the greatest astronomers of modern times, such
as Kepler, Newton, Hansen, Laplace, and Leverrier, scarcely ever looked through a telescope." 2 Kepler, who always signed himself Keppler in German, is usually supposed to have been born on December 21, 1571, in the imperial town of
Weil, but according to Baron von Breitschwert,3 he was really born on December 27, 1571, in the
village of Magstadt in Wurtemberg. According to Lieut. Winterhalter, M. Perrotin of the Nice Observatory declared " that two hours' work with a large instrument is as fatiguing as eight with a small one, the labour involved in
creasing in proportion to the cube of the aperture, the chances of seeing decreasing in the same ratio,

while it can hardly be said that the advantages
increase in like proportion." l The late Mr. Proctor has well said
" It is well to remember that the hatred which many entertain against the doctrine of develop
ment as applied to solar systems and stellar
galaxies is not in reality a sign, as they imagine,
of humility, but is an effort to avoid the recog
nition of the nothingness of man in the presence
of the infinities of space and time and vitality
presented within the universe of God." 2
Humboldt says
"That arrogant spirit of incredulity, which
rejects facts without attempting to investigate
them, is , in some cases almost more injurious
than an unquestioning credulity. Both are alike
detrimental to the force of investigations." 3
With reference to the precession of the
equinoxes and the changes it produces in the position of the Pole Star, it is stated in a recent book on science that the entrance passage of the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh is inclined at an
angle of 30 to the horizon, and therefore points to
the celestial pole. But this is quite incorrect.
The Great Pyramid, it is true, is situated close to the latitude of 30. But the entrance passage
does not point exactly to the pole. The inclination was measured by Col. Vyse, and found to be

26 45'. For six out of the nine pyramids of Gliizeh, Col. Vyse found an average inclination ~of 26 47',
these inclinations ranging from 25 55' (2nd, or
pyramid of Mycerinus) to 28 0' (9th pyramid).1 Sir John Herschel gives 3970 B.C. as the probable date of the erection of the Great Pyramid. 1 At that time the distance of a Draconis (the Pole Star of that day) from the pole was 3 44' 25", so that when on the meridian beloiv the pole (its lower
culmination as it is termed) its altitude was
30 - 3 44' 25" = 26 15' 35", which agrees fairly well with the inclination of the entrance passage. Letronne found a date of 3430 B.C. ; but the earlier date agrees better with the evidence derived from
Egyptology. Emerson says
" I sin brother to him who squared the pyramids By the same stars I watch."
' From February 6 to 15, 1908, all the bright planets were visible together at the same time. Mercury was visible above the western horizon

Laplace's original Nebular Hypothesis being true,
Dr. See says, " We may calculate from the preponderance of small bodies actually found in the

to unity. This figure is so very large that we shall content ourselves with illustrating a decillion
decillion, and for this purpose we avail ourselves of a method employed by ARCHIMEDES to illustrate his system of enumeration. Imagine sand so fine that 10,000 grains will be contained in
the space occupied by a poppy seed, itself about the size of a pin's head ; and then conceive a sphere described about our sun with a radius of 200,000 astronomical units 1 (a Centauri being at a dis

. All these grains of sand against one is the
probability that a nebula devoid of hydrostatical pressure, such as that which formed the planets
and satellites, will lead to the genesis of such small bodies revolving about a greatly predominant

central mass." l In other words, it is practically certain that the solar system was not formed from
a gaseous nebula in the manner originally proposed by Laplace. On the other hand, the evolution of the solar system from a rotating spiral nebula seems very probable.
Some one has said that " the world knows
nothing of its greatest men." The name of Mr. George W. Hill will probably be unknown to many of my readers. But the late Prof. Simon Newcomb
said of him that he " will easily rank as the greatest master of mathematical astronomy during the

New splendour to the dead.' " 2
Sir David Brewster has well said,3 " Isaiah
furnishes us with a striking passage, in which the occupants of the earth and the heavens are
separately described, * I have made the earth, and created man upon it : I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded' (Isaiah xlv. 12). But in addition to these obvious references to life and things
pertaining to life, we find in Isaiah the following remarkable passage :
4 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens ; God Himself that formed the earth and made it ; He hath established
it, He created it not IN VAIN, He formed it to be
inhabited ' (Isaiah xlv. 18). Here we have a
distinct declaration from the inspired prophet that the earth would have been created IN VAIN if it had not been formed to be inhabited; and hence we draw the conclusion that as the Creator cannot be supposed to have made the worlds of

GENERAL 357
our system and those in the sidereal system in vain, they must have been formed to be inhabited." This seems to the present writer to be a good and
sufficient reply to Dr. Wallace's theory that our earth is the only inhabited world in the Universe !
*
Such a theory seems incredible.
The recent discovery made by Prof. Kapteyn, and confirmed by Mr. Eddington, of two drifts
of stars, indicating the existence of two universes, seems to render untenable Dr. Wallace's hypothesis
of the earth's central position in a single universe.1

NOTE ADDED IN THE PRESS.
While these pages were in the Press, it was announced, by Dr. Max Wolf of Heidelberg, that he found Halley's
comet on a photograph taken on the early morning of September 12, 1909. The discovery has been confirmed at Greenwich Observatory. The comet was close to the position predicted by the calculations of Messrs. Cowell and
Crommelin of Greenwich Observatory (Nature, September 1C, 1908).
