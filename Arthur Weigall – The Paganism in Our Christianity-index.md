but the non -partisan layman , unless he has
chanced to be by habit a church -goer, has found
it no simple matter to decide which of the two
delivers the greater insult to his secular intelligence
-the bigoted Evangelical “ Fundamentalist,” or
the strange and subversive Sacramentalist. In
this dilemma, therefore, his interest has been
directed rather to the matter of keeping the
Church as national as possible, in which endeav

attacking practices considered to be of a Roman
Catholic character; for the average Englishman

Professor George Santayana has said ," that any

In England, in fact, the layman finds himself
in control of the ecclesiastical situation ; but, in
making use of his powers, he is mainly concerned
with this matter of the national character of the
State Church , and he is inclined to give little
thought to the intellectual questions involved.
The whole fight, however, in its doctrinal aspect,
is relatively unimportant, because it is over
shadowed by the much more serious fact of the
growing indifference of educated people through
out the world to church -going at all. On all sides
one hears it said that the dogmas of Christianity
can no longer be accepted by the modern mind,
there being such a woof of nonsense interwoven
across the warp of Christian belief that the intel
ligent layman must needs weave his own reli

in England, but the whole scheme of Christian
theology as taught throughout the world by the
various sects and churches, is now under criticism ;

the really important question to -day is one which
is not local nor factional, but is being asked all
over the Christian world in all denominations,
namely, whether or not the entire creed is obsolete.
The fear that Christianity will collapse before the
dread tribunal of modern rationality is widespread;
and it is perhaps for this reason that the layman
in England shrinks from investigating too closely

Prayer Book dispute, and confines himself, as I

I believe that much of the generally accepted

things it does are in accord with modern thought,
are credible and acceptable to the critical mind of
to-day, and have the authority of the Founder of
the Faith, then all is well, and the Christian religion need have no fear of extinction; but if these things are not credible, and neither appeal to moder 12

CHAPTER II
THE QUESTION AS TO THE HISTORICITY OF JESUS
DURING the frank and unbiassed examination of
the theology and customs of our Faith which I
propose to make, I shall have to question certain
dogmas and beliefs the truth of which will be
thought by the orthodox to be beyond doubt; and
to those who are not familiar with theological
criticism it may seem that an attempt is being
made to destroy the whole structure of Chris
tianity. My object, however, is, as I have said,
precisely the reverse . There is a widespread crit
ical school which , seeing only the old gods grouped
about the Christian altar, thinks that Jesus never
existed at all, but that His life is a myth invented
during the First Century A.D.; and it is with this
powerful school that I wish to do battle.

Let me therefore briefly summarise the results 26



COMPOSITION OF NEW TESTAMENT
of the labours of modern scholars in regard to
the dates at which the books of the New Testa
ment were written, so that the unprejudiced reader
may judge of their historical value or liability to
error by considering the length of time which
elapsed between the days of Jesus and those of
their composition .'
The earliest known Christian documents are
the Epistles of Paul, who died, it would seem ,
about the year A.D. 64, and whose first letter was
written at least a dozen years before that date,
that is to say, some twenty years after the Cruci
fixion . Some of these Epistles have been regarded
as not genuine Pauline writings, but the extreme
views of Bauer and others in this regard have
found little support ; and it is now generally
thought that the authenticity of Galatians, I and

of the labours of modern scholars in regard to
the dates at which the books of the New Testa
ment were written, so that the unprejudiced reader may judge of their historical value or liability to error by considering the length of time which
elapsed between the days of Jesus and those of their composition.*
The earliest known Christian documents are
the Epistles of Paul, who died, it would seem,
about the year A.D. 64, and whose first letter was written at least a dozen years before that date,
that is to say, some twenty years after the Crucifixion. Some of these Epistles have been regarded as not genuine Pauline writings, but the extreme views of Bauer and others in this regard have
found little support; and it is now generally
thought that the authenticity of Galatians, I and
II Corinthians, and Romans, is unquestionable,
and that Philippians and I Thessalonians are

though the great critic, Dr. Rashdall, Dean of
Carlisle, accepted them with reserve . '
Certain critics regard I Thessalonians as the
earliest Epistle, and place its date at about A.D. 52
(Lightfoot) or even earlier (Harnack ). It is im
portant, however, to notice that nowhere in the
Epistles is there any reference to written records
of the life of Jesus ; and it seems pretty certain ,
therefore, that nothing in the nature of a Gospel
was then in existence - a fact which is not sur
prising, since His Second Coming and the end of
the world were then believed to be imminent.
Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis, who wrote in about
the year 140, and who is quoted by Eusebius,
says that Mark , the interpreter and follower of
Peter, wrote down all that he could remember of
the words and acts of Jesus as related by Peter,
although he had not himself known Jesus in the

Finally, there are the non -Pauline epistles.
Of these the First Epistle of St. Peter is generally

Jesus had been “ conceived by the Holy Ghost,"

on the contrary,St. Paul speaksof Jesus as " made
of the seed of David according to the flesh ,"': that
is to say, of the seed of Joseph, David's
dant. The earliest Gospel, that' of St. Mark,
dating between A.D. 70 and 100, does not mention
it ; nor does the Gospel of St. John, dating from
some time not earlier than A.D. 100. The Book
of Revelation ,' written between A.D. 69 and 93,
is silent on the subject, though had the Virgin
Birth then been an important tenet of the faith
it would undoubtedly have figured in the mystical
symbolism of that composition. The story ap
pears for the first time in the Gospel of St. Luke,
which may have been written as late as A.D. 100 ;
and there we are told that Mary had conceived
her child by the Holy Ghost before the consum

Some critics have been worried by these unbeliev

pretty certainly incorrect; for no such census is
known to have been made in any year which can
be regarded as a likely date of the birth of Jesus,
if we assume that He was somewhere about thirty
at the beginning of His ministry. It is obviously
impossible, also, that citizens should have been

of mankind in the Deluge lasted forty days; there
were forty nights of mourning in the mysteries of
the pagan Proserpine; there were forty days of
sacrifice in the old Persian " Salutation of Mithra " ;
and so forth .
In regard to the miraculous events which took
place at the death of Jesus, the Gospel of St. John
says nothing, and those of St. Mark and St. Luke
speak only of the rending of the veil of the temple
and of the darkness or overcasting of the sky for
three hours. The story of the earthquake, the
upheaval of the rocks, the bursting open of the
graves, and the appearance of the dead, is alone
related in St. Matthew's Gospel, written nearly
eighty years after the event, therefore not
certainly authentic. Of course there is no reason

features
about
it which
distinguished it from
the
usual
execution
upon
the

. Five
of these
peculiarities
may
here
be
mentioned
.
Firstly
,
this
death
by
crucifixion was
inflicted
upon
a
man
whose
crime
was
that
of
blasphemy and
heresy
,
but
the
punishment
for
such
a crime
was
death
by
decapitation
or
stoning
. Secondly
, the
execu
tion
took
place
on
the
eve
of
the
Passover
; and
since
crucifixion was
a slow
torture
, often
lasting
several
days
before
death
released
the
sufferer
, an
ordinary
crucifixion
would
have
been
held
over
until
after
the
festival
.
Thirdly
, in
spite
of
it
being
the
day
before
the
Passover
, two
malefactors
were
also
crucified
. Fourthly
, the
victim
in
this
case
was
first
dressed
up
as a King
, a mock
crown
being
placed
on
His
head
, and
a mock
sceptre
in
His
hand
; and
in
the
inscription
affixed
to
the
cross
He
was
described
as " the
King
of the
Jews
.”.
And
, finally
, the
execution
of Jesus
was
preceded
by
the
release
of
a condemned
criminal
called
Barabbas

Now the sacrifice of a lamb or kid at the great
Jewish festival of the Passover undoubtedly had
its origin in a human sacrifice, the Passover being
really a spring festival very much older than the
days of the Exodus; for in the story of Abraham

as playing the part of the sacrificial lamb, and fi

for the good of the nation ; and it would also
explain the curiousGospel story of Barabbas.
Frazer has pointed out that “ Barrabas" was
certainly not the personal name of any one crim
inal, but was the traditional name for the victim
in an annual human sacrifice, or rather in the
execution into which the sacrifice had deteriorated ;
and there is evidence that the use of this name
survived even later than the time of Christ, for
Philo Judæus, 3 writing in the days of Agrippa,
about A.D. 40, tells us that the mob at Alexandria
dressed up a crazy old man , putting a sham crown
on his head, a sceptre in his hand, and a purple
robe over his body, and hailing him as Karabbas,
an obvious miswriting for Barabbas, and as Maris,
the Syrian word for a royal personage.
In the Gospel story Pilate seems to have been
asked by the Jews to release to them the con
demned criminal chosen to be the Barabbas for
that year in this case the leader in some for

CHAPTER VIII
OTHER FEATURES OF THE CRUCIFIXION
In the previous chapter I attempted to show that
the Gospel story of the Crucifixion relates certain
details which can best be accounted for on the
supposition that Jesus was crucified in the guise
of the annual Bar Abbas. But since this Bar Abbas
victim appears to have been at that time always
a condemned criminal, the disgrace of the execu
tion was not mitigated, nor was the sacrificial
character of His death at first any comfort to the
disciples. The crucifixion of evil-doers, preceded
by scourging, was, at the time of Christ, the usual
Roman form of execution in the case of slaves or
particularly rascally criminals; and its ignominy
must have been bitterly felt, in spite of the fact
that the Jews had given it this sacrificial aspect.
But gradually the believers began to attribute
a symbolical meaning to these events ; and though

A clear instance of the worship of the cross, or
tree, as itself a god is to be found in the half -pagan,
half-Christian poem inscribed upon the early
Anglo -Saxon cross at Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire."
In this poem the cross is made to say : " I lifted up
Heaven's great lord, and they reviled us both
together; me, stained with the blood poured from
the man's side, and Christ who was on the cross .
Then came nobles to Him in grief; and I, who
beheld all, I was stricken with sorrow ." Indeed ,
on the early church crucifixes Jesus is represented
not as a nude and dying or dead man , but as a
glorified divinity, alive and clothed in a robe:
which suggests that, through the persistence of
the pagan tradition, He was in some sense identi
fied with the older divinity of the cross or tree
itself .
In the previous chapter it has been shown that
crucifixion was practised in several lands in the
sacred ceremony of human sacrifice, as though it
had a special religious significance ; and to the in
stances there cited I may add that of Cyrus, who

this theory it is to be observed that He had not
been much hurt
by
being crucified
. It was not
the custom to drive nails through the feet,
the victim usually stood upon a block projecting
from the cross ; and the Gospel of St. John speaks
of His hands being wounded but not His feet.
The victim's arms were generally tied to the cross
beam , and if the hands were nailed it was only as
an added insult, a small nail being driven through
the flesh of each hand, between the fingers, with
out causing a serious wound. A soldier had
pricked our Lord's side to see if He were dead,

CHAPTER X
THE ASCENSION AND THE MESSIAHSHIP
THE earliest Christians had a story of their
Master to tell which, when cleared of the colouring
and embellishments put upon it in the fervour of
their excitement and love, was somewhat as fol
lows. The adored and revered Jesus had gone
about the country preaching and healing the sick
in a most godlike manner, and in the end had
admitted that He was the promised Messiah. He
had been acclaimed by his followers as the national
Saviour, but, to their bitter disappointment, His
entry into Jerusalem had failed to impress the bulk
of the populace; and He had been arrested and
crucified on the eve of the Passover, thereby
changing their hopes into despair and perplexity.
They had seen Him die upon the cross on that
Friday afternoon ; but on the third day, the Sunday

the Christian of to -day is entitled to declare that
our Lord then passed away from this life, though
nobody can say when or in what manner His
passing occurred. The words “ ascended into

him sacrosanct; and the kings of Israel, for exam

the Christian of to-day is entitled to declare that our Lord then passed away from this life, though
nobody can say when or in what manner His passing occurred. The words ‘‘ascended into

or Adonis ultimately became confused in men's
minds with Jesus Christ.
This god was believed to have suffered a cruel
death , to have descended into Hell or Hades, to
have risen again , and to have ascended into
Heaven ; and at his festival, as held in various
lands, his death was bewailed, an effigy of his dead
body was prepared for burial by being washed with
water and anointed, and, on the next day, his
resurrection was commemorated with great rejoic

being used. The celebration of his ascension in
the sight of his worshippers was the final act of
the festival.
These ceremonies were held in some countries
in the summer, but in the neighbourhood of Pales

appearance of the planet Venus as the Morning

closely with that of the death and resurrection
of Jesus that the coincidence could hardly have
been overlooked by the early Christians; and in
certain parts of Christendom the Good Friday
and Easter ceremonies of the present day appear
to carry on the Adonis rites, as, for example,
in Sicily and parts of Greece, where an effigy of
the dead Christ is prepared for burial amidst the
wailing of the people, which continues until mid

was taken over from paganism , but because He
was put to death at that time in the guise of the
Bar Abbas sacrifice, which probably took place at
that date; and His resurrection is recorded as
following shortly afterwards, not because Adonis
and other gods were supposed to have come back
to life in that manner, but because He did revive
and come out of the tomb alive. It was, I think,
largely due to this very coincidence that the

named Rhampsinitus, and his return to earth .
At this festival, which seems to have been con
nected with Osiris, the priests wrapped a man in a
shroud and led him to the temple of Isis outside
the city, where they left him , he being afterwards
led back by two priests playing the parts of the
two divine guides of the dead. A significant
feature of this account is that the man , on his
return , carried a napkin which was supposed to
have been given to him in the regions below ; and
one is reminded thus of the story , which only
occurs in the late Gospel of St. John, of how those
who came to the tomb of Jesus saw the napkin
· lying in one place and the shroud in another, and
beheld two celestial figures. This Egyptian inci
dent has the effect of raising a doubt in regard to
the napkin -story in St. John ; but it is perhaps only

named Rhampsinitus, and his return to earth. At this festival, which seems to have been con
nected with Osiris, the priests wrapped a man ina
shroud and led him to the temple of Isis outside the city, where they left him, he being afterwards
led back by two priests playing the parts of the
two divine guides of the dead. A significant feature of this account is that the man, on his
return, carried a napkin which was supposed to
have been given to him in the regions below; and one is reminded thus of the story, which only
occurs in the late Gospel of St. John, of how those
who came to the tomb of Jesus saw the napkin lying in one place and the shroud in another, and
beheld two celestial figures. This Egyptian inci
dent has the effect of raising a doubt in regard to
the napkin-story in St. John; but it is perhaps only important as an instance of the caution with which
one has to examine the Gospel accounts.

Church of England at the Reformation, and is
only now gradually coming back into favour under
the auspices of the Anglo-Catholics. It is cele
the
brated on August 13th; but that was the date of
the great festival of Diana or Artemis, with whom
Isis was identified, and one can see, thus, how
Mary had gradually taken the place of the
goddess.
Artemis was, in one aspect, identified with
Selene, the Moon -goddess, in which capacity the
crescent moon was her symbol; and Isis, similarly,
was identified with the moon . This accounts for
the presence of the crescent moon in so many
paintings of the Virgin Mary. Isis was also
identified with Venus or Aphrodite; and the mourn
ing of Isis for the slain Osiris was thus assimilated
to the mourning of Venus for the slain Adonis.
But Aphrodite was born of the foam of the sea ,
and thus Isis gradually came to be the patron
goddess of the sea, and of seamen ; and when the
Madonna took the place of Isis she also took over

only now gradually coming back into favour under the auspices of the Anglo-Catholics. It is cele
brated on August 13th; but that was the date of
the great festival of Diana or Artemis, with whom
Isis was. identified, and one can see, thus, how
Mary had gradually taken the place of the goddess.
Artemis was, in one aspect, identified with Selene, the Moon-goddess, in which capacity the ,-¢fescent moon was her symbol; and Isis, similarly,
oe
was identified ‘with the moon. This accounts for
” ‘the presence of the crescent moon in so many
paintings of the Virgin Mary. Isis was also
identified with Venus or Aphrodite; and the mourn
ing of Isis for the slain Osiris was thus assimilated
to the mourning of Venus for the slain Adonis.
But Aphrodite was born of the foam of the sea,
and thus Isis gradually came to be the patron
goddess of the sea, and of seamen; and when the
Madonna took the place of Isis she also took over
the title Stella Maris, “Star of the Sea,” by which
"she is’So often called in Roman Catholic countries. 132



INFLUENCE OF OSIRIS AND ISIS

of Isis, ship in hand, is carved upon an ivory panel
of pagan times which, without any sense of
incongruity , was inserted in mediæval times into
the side of the ambo in the cathedral of Aix , where
it may now be seen . ' I may mention that in the
church of St. Ursula at Cologne a statue of Isis
was adapted in the middle ages for one of the
capitals of the pillars.
Isis was also identified with the goddess Astarte,
or Ashtoreth ( the Ashtaroth of the Bible), Queen
of Heaven ; and just as we learn from Jeremiah 3
that the Hebrew women made offerings to her, so,
right down to modern times at Paphos in Cyprus,
the women make offerings to the Virgin Mary as
Queen of Heaven in the ruins of the ancient temple
of Astarte.

December 25th was really the date, not of the

THE INFLUENCE OF MITHRA
DURING the first three and a half centuries A.D.
the increasingly powerful rival of Christianity
was the religion known as Mithraism , that is to
say, the worship of the solar god Mithra or Mithras
which had been introduced into Rome by Cilician
seamen about 68 B.C., and later on spread through
out the Roman world , until, just before the final
triumph of Christianity, it was the most powerful
pagan faith in the Empire. It was suppressed by
the Christians in A.D. 376 and 377 ; but its collapse
seems to have been due rather to the fact that by
that time many of its doctrines and ceremonies
had been adopted by the Church, so that it was
practically absorbed by its rival, Jesus Christ
supplanting Mithra in men's worship without the
need of any mental somersaults.

Tertullian’ states that the worshippers of
Mithra practised baptism by water, through which they were thought to be redeemed from
sin, and that the priest made a sign upon the fore
head of the person baptised; but as this was also
a Christian rite, Tertullian declares that the Devil
must have effected the coincidence for his wicked

ends. “ The Devil," he also writes, " imitates

even the main parts of our divine mysteries," and
" has gone about to apply to the worship of idols
those very things of which the administration of
Christ's sacraments consists."
In
this
he
must
be
referring
both
to
the

also
to

to

.
The
ceremony
of
eating
an

and
drinking

blood
is
,
of

,
of

,
and
there
are

think
,
it
was

ceremony
by
Jesus
;
but
its
connection
with
the
Mithraic
rite
is
the
most
apparent.
The worshippers of Mithra were called " Soldiers
of Mithra," which is probably the origin of the
term " Soldiers of Christ” and of the exhortation to

the Mithraic rite is the most apparent.
The worshippers of Mithra were called ‘‘Soldiers
of Mithra,” which is probably the origin of the term ‘‘Soldiers of Christ’’ and of the exhortation to

THE INFLUENCE OF MITHRA
Christians to " put on the armour of light,"
Mithra being the god of Light. As in Christianity ,
they recognised no social distinctions, both rich
and poor, freemen and slaves, being admitted into
the Army of the Lord . Mithraism had its aus
terities, typified in the severe initiation rites en
dured by a " Soldier of Mithra " ; and the Epistle
to Timothy, similarly, exhorts the Christian to
" endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
Christ ." . It had also its nuns and its male
celibates; 3 and one of its main tenets was the
control of the flesh and the repudiation of the
world, this being symbolised in the initiation cere
mony, whereat a crown was offered to the novice,
who had to reject it, saying, as did the Christians,
that it was to a heavenly crown that he looked.
We hear, too, of hymns which could be used with
equal propriety by Christians and Mithraists
alike.

Now the early Christians, openly and for no
reasons of secrecy or security, employed those
subterranean rock chambers known as catacombs
both for their burials and for public worship .
Like the Mithraic caves, these catacombs were
decorated with paintings, amongst which the
subject of Moses striking the rock, which, as I
have said above, has a Mithraic parallel, is often
represented. The most frequent theme is that of
Christ as the Good Shepherd; and although it is
generally agreed that the figure of Jesus carrying
a lamb is taken from the statues of Hermes
Kriophoros,' the kid -carrying god, Mithra is
sometimes shown carrying a bull across his
shoulders, and Apollo, who, in his solar aspect
and as the patron of the rocks,' is to be iden

Shepherd.” At the birth of Mithra the child
was adored by shepherds, who brought gifts to

THE INFLUENCE OF MITHRA
The Hebrew Sabbath having been abolished by
Christians, the Church made a sacred day of
Sunday, partly because it was the day of the
resurrection, but largely because it was the weekly
festival of the sun ; for it was a definite Christian
policy to take over the pagan festivals endeared
to the people by tradition, and to give them a
Christian significance. But, as a solar festival,
Sunday was the sacred day of Mithra; and it is
interesting to notice that since Mithra was ad
dressed as Dominus, " Lord," Sunday must have
been “ the Lord's Day ” long before Christian times.
I may again mention here, in passing, a subject to
which I have already referred and will return in a
later chapter, namely, that of the origin of our
Christmas. December 25th was the birthday of
the sun -god, and particularly of Mithra, and was
only taken over in the Fourth Century as the
date, actually unknown, of the birth of Jesus.
The head of the Mithraic faith was called Pater

THE ORIGIN OF THE EUCHARIST
In the previous chapter I pointed out that a
sacramental eucharist was a feature of the rites
of Mithraism ; and the reader will recall that the
elements were bread and water, not bread and
wine. I want now to show that in the First Cen
tury the Christian celebration was simply a cere
mony of “ remembrance" forming part of a real
meal, the second element in those days being
wine; but that in the Second Century the cere
mony became a sacrament, and at the same time
water took the place of wine, which seems to
show that the Mithraic rite influenced the Chris

faithful were wont to meet and to celebrate the
Lord's Supper by eating a meal together, appar
ently from a common stock of provisions, but that
this had degenerated into an unseemly affair in
which some ate and drank too much or too quickly,
and others did not get enough. St. Paul therefore
enjoins them to restrain themselves and to wait
for one another, adding that since this is a sacred
meal, in which the body of Jesus is to be discerned,
those who are hungry should have something to
eat at home before coming. He then reminds
them of the origin of the ceremony, which he
relates thus: " The Lord Jesus on the night in
which he was betrayed took bread, and having
given thanks brake it and said, This is my body
which is broken for your sake; this do in remem

The

And
he
warns
the

he
describes

meal,
thus,
was
a
sacred

,
akin
to

in

religions,

perhaps
copied
to
some

from

of life, the living bread; that His flesh is meat
indeed, and: His blood drink indeed; and that
unless men eat His flesh and drink His blood they
shall not have eternal life. This Gospel, in fact, which was not recognised as authoritative by the
early Church, is the only one wherein Jesus is spoken of as ‘‘bread” or ‘‘water” at all. Then
comes the latest Synoptic Gospel, that of St.
Matthew? (A.D. 100-110), in which, after the words ‘‘This is my blood of the new covenant
which is shed for many,” somebody has added
‘‘for the remission of sins,’’ an acknowledged interpolation, giving a sacrificial interpretation to the passage. Now at about the same time that the original
communal meal and ‘‘remembrance ceremony”’ was
changed into a sacramental rite, water was sub
stituted for wine; and Justin Martyr, writing

The doctrine as it is understood by conservative Christians is simply this: Owing to the dis
obedience of Adam in eating the symbolical apple "?
which God had forbidden him to eat, sin and death
entered the world, and every human being was
henceforth born under a curse and was debarred
from heaven's bliss, except in certain privileged
cases. God, however, wishing at last to end this situation and to restore normal relations with
mankind, sent His Son into the world so that He
might suffer a sacrificial death which could be
regarded by the Creator as full satisfaction for
Adam’s crime; and the result has been that the
Christian is not now prevented by Original Sin
from entering heaven. This restoration of normal
relations between God and man is the “‘at-one
ment” (the original meaning of atonement), that
is to say, the great reconciliation, and it was thus brought about by the propitiatory value of the sufferings and death of Jesus. 161



PAGANISM IN OUR CHRISTIANITY
It should be explained at the outset that in
these days, when the recognition of the descent
of man from lower forms of life has eliminated
Adam and Eve from history, and has relegated
them to the province of mythological legend,
our ideas of Original Sin have had to be adjusted.
By this term the Christian now means the ten
dency of every man towards sinfulness, due to his
animal or lower nature. This adjustment, how
ever , is very easily made; and no man , however
much he may smile at the absurdity of the legend
of the Garden of Eden, will deny that he enters
upon life with a load of potential evil upon his
shoulders which may still very fittingly be de
scribed as Original Sin.
In that respect modern thought does not clash
with primitive Christian ideas ; but in regard to
the propitiation for these evil inclinations the case
is different. We can no longer accept the appall
ing theological doctrine that for some mystic
reason a propitiatory sacrifice was necessary. It
outrages either our conception of God as almighty
or else our conception of Him as all-loving. The

seems to have been an accepted custom. In the famous fifty-third chapter of Isaiah the
prophet had developed the idea of a national figure, distinct from the Messiah, who, by his
sufferings and death, should atone for the sins
of the nation; and in later Judaism great stress
was laid on the idea that Israel made atonement for its iniquities by the blood of the righteous.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE

In the last chapter I showed that the idea of a
propitiatory sacrifice as an explanation of the
" scandal" of the cross presented itself to the minds
of the earliest Christians owing to the fact that
both in Judaism and in many pagan faiths such
an idea was already well known. The sacrificial
sufferings and deaths of gods on behalf of mankind,
let me repeat, were commonplaces of pagan
theology; and though the Jews had never thought
of the Messiah as one who would have to suffer,
they believed that the sufferings of representatives
of Israel in atonement for sin were demanded by
the scriptures. Therefore, as I said before, as
soon as the Jewish followers of Jesus Christ came

divinity was gloriously confirmed ; and, since such
an atonement was so well understood by pagans
also, the Gentile converts found in it the most
convincing factor in the whole argument.
Now , Jesus Himself had never said anything
which could be interpreted with certainty as

man , were to be the consequences of His death ;

Force which holds the world , you will find it hard

THE TRINITY
Being beyond human ideas of bulk , and outside
our three- dimensional conception of position , He
might as well be said to be contained in thesmallest
point in space as in the largest range of it; for
bigness and smallness have no meaning in spiritual
thought. All that the critic cares to say, in fact,
is that He is timeless, formless, unlimited by space,
position, size, number, or any other material con
sideration ; and that He is at once the Whole and
all the fractions, aspects, and parts of that Whole.
The idea of a co -equal Trinity, however, offers
a reasonable means of expressing the inexpressible;
but it must not be forgotten that Jesus Christ
never mentioned such a phenomenon, and nowhere
in the New Testament does the word " Trinity"
appear. The idea was only adopted by the
Church three hundred years after the death of
our Lord; and the origin of the conception is
entirely pagan .

Spirit being co -equal with God was not generally

Century A.D. The school of Arius held the view
that the Son was created by the Father and had
not always been co -eternal with Him ; and this led
to the opposing party not only emphasising the
equality of the Father and Son ( just as Mithra in
the great rival religion, Mithraism , was both son
of Ormuzd , the Creator, and at the same time co
equal with him ), but also emphasising the co

clearly that the departure of Jesus must have been

Epistles are most probably to be dated to this early period, but since it is just possible that they
were written by later hands, they must not be cited here.
Now Paul, like Peter, speaks of Jesus, in these unquestioned documents, as being about to return
in glory to judge mankind;* but this fervent belief
that the Second Coming was imminent shows
clearly that the departure of Jesus must have been
recent, and must have been to him an established
fact. Moreover, he is able to say that he knew Peter and had met James, the brother of Jesus;* he
can speak of other persons being still alive who
had seen Him;’ he can speak of His parentage;

Thus, from these early Epistles we obtain
sufficient evidence not only to establish the
historicity of Jesus, but also to reveal to some
extent His character. The beauty of His life
was such that Peter, who knew Him , and Paul,
who knew His brother, could deem Him a man
without sin , one who to them was obviously the
Son of God. I cannot recall in history a well
authenticated instance, like this, of a leader inspir
ing his immediate followers with such utter adora
tion .
Such , then , is the Jesus revealed by these first
documents; but besides the Epistles we have the
Synoptic Gospels, wherein a clear basis of fact is to
be observed under the legendary matter. The
character of Jesus as it appears in these books is
to be relied on as authentic, on the whole, because,
as I have explained in an earlier chapter, Bishop
Papias, writing about A.D. 140, tells us that
Matthew made a collection of the sayings of our
Lord, which was pretty certainly used in the com
position of the Gospels, and that Mark, Peter's
pupil, collected notes of His sayings and acts,

THE outstanding characteristic of the teaching
of Jesus was its simplicity . He reduced religion
almost to two principles - the love of God and the
brotherhood of man ; and often He said that the
whole doctrine was capable of being understood
by a child, and, indeed , that it was necessary to
its understanding that the novice should become a
child again, which means to say that he should
recover that clear gaze of childhood which was his
before his mental vision became veiled by the
perplexities of accepted sacerdotalism . The entire
theology of Jesus may be summed up in four

faith on his death-bed in A.D. 337, but Julian, who reigned from A.D. 361 to 363, rounded upon them for the persecutions which they, in their turn, were now inflicting upon the other faiths. Their power, however, was by this time too tremendous
to be overthrown, and in A.D. 391 Theodosius the
Great established Christianity as the sole religion
of the State. “
The Christian doctrine had now defined itself,
not without riot and bloodshed, along the lines of
that extraordinary composition still, unfortunately, having a place in the Anglican Prayer Book,
namely, the Athanasian Creed, traditionally at
tributed to Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, in Egypt, A.D. 293-373, but, although exactly word

the Fifth Century. In this creed the faith is seen
to have developed into the recognition of three Persons in One God, the first of these Persons being

SUNDAY OBSERVANCE
In the early Christian Church there were no
festivals, holy days, or Sabbaths, for, as Chrysos
tom says, " the whole of time is a festival unto
Christians, because of the excellency of the good
things which have been given " ; or , as Origen puts
it, “ to the perfect Christian all his days are the
Lord's." : Socrates, the ecclesiastical historian,
also tells us that " the apostles had no thought of
appointing festival days, but only of promoting
a life of blamelessness and piety." When the
Church had become a State institution , however,
the need of holy days and festivals began to be
felt, and, indeed, it was essential to give a Chris
tian significance to those of pagan origin which
could not be suppressed. The clergy, for example,
could not prevent the people in various countries

the origin of this custom of keeping one day in the
week as a Sabbath , or " day of rest," and to show
that the practice was forcefully opposed by Jesus
Christ.
The origin of the seven - day week , which was
used by the Jews and certain other peoples, but
not till later by the Greeks or Romans, is to be
sought in some primitive worship of the moon ,
for the custom of keeping the day of the new
moon and that of the full moon as festivals, which
is widely found in antiquity, implies the recogni
tion of a cycle of about 14 days, of which a week
of 7 days is the half, the actual length of a week
thus determined being 7% days. Now the Baby
lonians had early adopted the seven -day week ,
and their calendars contain directions for the
abstention from certain secular acts on stated
days which seem to correspond to seventh days,

where a seven -day week was in use there is reason

to the sun, which was the most important of the

It seems more likely, in fact, that they were
influenced here, as in so many other matters, by
pagan custom , and that Sunday came to be
celebrated because the Mithraists and other sun
worshippers regarded it as a sacred holiday, and
the habit could not be suppressed.
In the year 321 the Emperor Constantine, who
was not yet a declared Christian, but was still
hovering between paganism and Christianity, is
sued a decree making Sunday a compulsory day
of rest ; but the fact that he speaks of Sunday as
"the venerable day of the Sun" shows that he was
thinking of it as a traditional sun -festival at the
same time that he thought of it as a Christian
holy -day. This decree, however, was not popular,
and finally it was repealed by the Emperor Leo in
the Ninth Century. But, in the West, Charle

By the Fourth Century the custom was wide
spread, and at Antioch in the year 386 the two
great Christian festivals are stated to have been
Easter and Epiphany, the latter being held on
January 6th, and being celebrated by the blessing
of all rivers and springs, and by the drawing of
water for use at baptisms throughout the year.
This word " Epiphany" means in Greek the " Ap
parition " or "Manifestation" of a deity, for Christ
was deemed to have manifested Himself first at
His baptism in the Jordan; but since He was said
to have performed at Cana the same miracle of
turning water into wine performed annually by
Dionysos on this date, and since this was the first
manifestation of His miraculous powers, the word
" Epiphany " gradually came to refer also to the
Cana miracle, which was likewise commemorated

PAGANISM IN OUR CHRISTIANITY
shepherds, who brought gifts to him , which
incident seems to have been the origin of the tale
of the shepherds adoring the infant Jesus given
in St. Luke ;' and therefore there is no reason why
the story of the Magi should not also have been
borrowed from Mithraism . Mithra's birthday
was always celebrated on December 25th , the date
afterwards adopted as the anniversary of the birth
of Jesus; and if the legend of the Magi is Mithraic,
it may be that these wise men were there said to
have arrived at Mithra's cradle twelve days after
the actual birth, that is to say , on January 6th.
But this is a guess, and the reason why the coming
of thesė Magi was assigned to this day is really
quite obscure.
At any rate the Christian Epiphany came to be

fact, seems to have been forced upon the Christians
owing to the impossibility either of suppressing so
ancient a custom or of preventing people from
identifying the birth of Jesus with the birth of the
sun ; and it was necessary , therefore, to resort to
the artifice so frequently employed and so openly

Christian significance to an irrepressible pagan

definitely says that “ the reason why the Fathers

work of the Christian is work in this world un
hampered by terrors about the next. There is no
time to waste in kneeling in fear before an angry
Deity, in telling Him what a splendid God He is,
in imploring Him to do us no harm now or here
after, in performing endless rites at His altars for
our safety: the churchman has a better thing than
that to do in church , namely, to pray for strength
to obey Christ instead of merely worshipping Him .
It is a Christian's business, by his thoughts and
actions in everyday life, to get on with the improve

of society, preached by Jesus, shall in due course

work of the Christian is work in this world unhampered by terrors about the next. There is no time to waste in kneeling in fear before an angry
Deity, in telling Him what a splendid God He is, in imploring Him to do us no harm now or hereafter, in performing endless rites at His altars for
our safety: the churchman has a better thing than
that to do in church, namely, to pray for strength
to obey Christ instead of merely worshipping Him. It is a Christian's business, by his thoughts and
actions in everyday life, to get on with the improve
ment of social.conditions, so that that ideal state
of society, preached by Jefts, shall in due course
be brought into existence. But this is not the
