Harappan-Era Seal Found In Rajasthan
2/04/2014
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) last week unearthed a Harappan seal from Karanpura in the Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan.
“The seal consists of two Harappan characters, with a typical unicorn as the motif and a pipal leaf depicted in front of an animal. There is a knob behind the seal,”
says VN Prabhakar, superintending archaeologist, who led the ASI team.
Maintaining that the discovery ‘confirms’ that the site belongs to the mature
Harappan period, the time when the civilization was at its peak (2600 BC to 1900
BC), he said: “A cubicle chert weight was also unearthed in a different house

complex. Both the seal and the weight establishes that the people of this area participated in commercial transactions.”
We are collecting charcoal sample to date the habitation through radio carbon dating, he said. The excavation at Karanpura, which started in 2012, had earlier brought to light two broad cultural levels, namely the early and the mature Harappan age. Besides artefacts, house complexes built of mud bricks of early Harappan and mature Harappan periods were also unearthed.
